Can you tell me how to uninstall Linux from my computer?  I could just
cry because it wiped everything off my hard drive.  Is there any way to
recover any of the things I had on my hard drive?  Thank you for any
help you can give me.

Probably your best bet would be to reinstall your old OS and applications,
then restore your data from the backups that you made before embarking on
significant changes to your computing landscape. Unfortunately, you seem
to imply from your above missive that you didn't make backups.
</p>

<p>
I don't think I can remember a single piece of documentation about
installing ANY version of Linux that didn't include statements about
backing up your system first. If you didn't back up the data, and you
didn't understand what you were doing when you made selections during your
"Linux" install, then it's entirely possible that you (YOU, not Linux)
wiped out your data. If you had a contractor or consultant doing the work
for you, they may carry some liability for the loss, but that certainly
won't bring the data back.
</p>

<p>
That's sad. I wish I had a better answer for you, but there isn't one. No
backups, drive formatted? Someone like OnTrack (<a href="http://www.ontrack.com/">http://www.ontrack.com/</a>)
might be able to recover your overwritten data for you, or some of it,
anyway. But that's going to be expensive.
</p>

<p>
Good luck!
