&gt; 
&gt;   * Mailbag
&gt;   * Talkback
&gt;   * NewsBytes, by Howard Dyckoff
</pre>

<p>
There was something I annotated at the time of my svn checkin of
lg_bytes -- but just realised I should have ALSO put into the STATUS
notes.  (I'll bet in retrospect that nobody pays attention to svn
checkin comments.)
</p>

<p>
Howard had:
<pre>
  Red Hat Adds Business Solutions to Open Source RHX
 
  RHX launch partners include Alfresco, CentricCRM, Compiere,
  EnterpriseDB, Groundwork, Jaspersoft, Jive, MySQL, Pentaho, Scalix,
  SugarCRM, Zenoss, Zimbra, and Zmanda.
</pre>
Problem:  A bunch of those are JUST NOT OPEN SOURCE.  Zimbra, SugarCRM,
Compiere, Groundwork, and Scalix are classic "badgeware", which is under
MPL-variant software with some restrictions -- while with CentricCRM,
there's not even any room for controversy, since <em>their</em> licence doesn't
even permit code redistribution.  Jive Software (which I'd not heard of,
before) turns out to be equally bad.
</p>

<p>
I have brought this matter, several times, to Red Hat's attention, and
the presence of actively misleading wording on the Red Hat Exchange
site, such as this at the top of
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285:">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285:</a>  
<pre>
  Red Hat Exchange helps you compare, buy, and manage open source
  business applications. All in one place and backed by the open source
  leader. We've collaborated with our open source software partners to
  validate that RHX applications run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and are
  delivered through the Red Hat Network. At RHX, Red Hat provides
  customers with a single point of contact for support.
</pre>
There has been no response and no correction of this error, but the very
bottom of that page now has this "FAQ" item:
<pre>
  Are you only accepting open source ISVs into RHX?
 
  The initial set of participating ISVs all have an open source focus. We
  realize that there is debate about which companies are truly open
  source. To make it transparent to users, RHX includes information about
  each ISV's license approach. Longer term, we may introduce proprietary
  applications that are friendly with open source applications.
</pre>
That is, of course, anything but a straight answer.  First, it's
nonsense to speak of <em>companies</em> being open source or not -- and the
above paragraph in general ducks the question.  The issue is whether
software is.  Second, even if there were debate about the badgeware
offerings allegedly being open source, there could be absolutely none
about Jive Software's Clearspace or CentricCRM 4.1, which are
unambiguously proprietary.
</p>

<p>
I'm surprised that this Red Hat's deceptive characterisation got past
Howard without comment, given that the matter's been extensively covered
in recent _Linux Gazette_ issues.
</p>

<p>
At the time I noticed this error, it was late at night and I delayed
dealing with the matter because I needed to chase down which of the
named offerings were under which licence, and I hadn't done so when I
suddenly started helping run the Westercon (which is still ongoing).
</p>

<p>
Any chance you'd like to append a footnote and republish?

top-posting and html of new faces to LG, as part of the price of having
fresh voices, but I'd <strong>really</strong> appreciate not having to do this for

<p>
I'd be happy to do a small rewrite about this....
</p>

<p>
I have to say that I put much more attention into the General News
section and for this last issue corresponded with Mark ShuttleWorth and
Kevin Carmony, their spokespeople, et al.  I also tried to get comments
from folks I've met from what is currently referred to as Microsoft's
Open Source Labs [no debate on that is implied....  '-) ].
</p>

<p>
I did wonder about a few of the companies in the list, but at the
webinars and conferences I've attended of late, there is a very
expansive use of the term Open Source.   The discussion is usually not
how open a company is but rather which license they are using.   And
there certainly has been a lot of discussion about GNU vs BPL vs Apache,
etc.  
</p>

<p>
When it comes to product-oriented stories, I just summarize the press
release and do little followup.   So, if we want to police the use of
the term 'open source' a bit in all News Byte stories, I can try to do
that.   Or perhaps we could create a phrase equivalent to saying :
</p>

<p>
"Red Hat calls these companies Open Source partners and we may beg to
differ."
</p>

<p>
Rick seems to have more creds in this area and I could, with his
permission, ping him about any such claim in future NB columns.
</p>

<p>
So on this one, Ben, do you want a disclaimer or a summary of the Open
Source licenses those listed companies DO or DO NOT USE???  Or both??
