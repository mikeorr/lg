I'm trying to do something pretty simple, I thought, and am near the
"tear out my hair" stage ... All I want to do is to create a symbolic
link to an existing directory:
</strong></p>

<pre><strong>bob$ ln -s tmp foo
bob$ ls -l foo
lrwxrwxrwx  1 bob bob 3 Dec  1 15:21 foo -&gt; tmp/
</strong></pre>
<p><strong>
No, foo is not a link to tmp. Well, it sort of is:
</strong></p>

<pre><strong>bob$ file foo
foo: symbolic link to `tmp'
</strong></pre>
<p><strong>
But,
</strong></p>

<pre><strong>bob$ ls foo
foo@
</strong></pre>

It looks like you're somehow passing -F -d to the ls command.
What does 'alias ls' tell you?

Oh, that was easy! Here I've been struggling trying to get the *&amp;*(^ ln
command to work and it was working all along! Yup, ls was aliased:
</strong></p>

<pre><strong>alias ls
alias ls='ls -F --color=auto'
</strong></pre>
<p><strong>
Guess how quickly I'm going to fix that! Dumb, dumb, dumb. Don't know
who .. the packager who snuck in the -F or me :)

Moral: always check for aliases.

For some of us - those who have their "mv", "cp", and
"rm" aliased to automatically use "-i", for example - it's the automatic
response (sticking, say, 'rm' into a 'for' loop doesn't work too well if
you're going to get asked "Are you sure?" for a couple hundred files.)
However, there's other stuff of this ilk in shells that can really drive
you nuts. In the past, I've been tripped up by looking for programs that
didn't exist (they turned out to be functions that the sysadmin put in
<tt>/etc/profile</tt>), have been driven almost insane by CDPATH ('cd foo' would
go to '<tt>/usr/local/foo/bar/zotz/qux/argle/bargle/will/this/never/end/foo</tt>'
instead of <tt>./foo</tt>), and have become Quite Annoyed by per-directory source
files - although '.exrc' isn't really a shell-related gadget. But still.

will be well. Intoxicants and computing do NOT mix well... remember,
never drink and derive.

Fedora Core 3 (in a fit of complete brain-death) shipped with
vi <em>  unconditionally  </em> aliased to <tt>/usr/bin/vim.</tt>

Gaah! I've run into similar idiot's handiwork on a Solaris system -
although, to be fair, it was the local sysadmin who perpetrated this
one. He had set root's $SHELL to "<tt>/usr/bin/bash</tt>" - 'cause, y'know, "sh"
is just <em>so</em> annoying (and .profile is just some stupid thing that
nobody ever uses anyway, right?) The, one fine morning, the "<tt>/usr</tt>" slice
failed to mount...

I've just taken another look at this -- at some point Fedora fixed the
bug. <tt>/etc/profile.d/vim.sh</tt> now looks like this:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" -o -n "$KSH_VERSION" -o -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ];
then
 [ -x /usr/bin/id ] || return
 [ `/usr/bin/id -u` -le 100 ] &amp;&amp; return
 # for bash and zsh, only if no alias is already set
 alias vi &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 || alias vi=vim
fi
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote>
which is much more reasonable behavior. As originally shipped the
two tests after then were missing.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"
	> [Breen] 
Which doesn't matter much until you're trying to repair a
system which doesn't have <tt>/usr/</tt> mounted (because you borked
<tt>/etc/fstab</tt> when tweaking your partitioning scheme).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Remembering to type <tt>/bin/vi</tt> is easier when you're not sweating
bullets.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>

doesn't give me a listing of the contents of tmp. Ummm, what am I doing
wrong here?????

Nothing.  Although you should qualify <em>which</em> directory you created the
link in.  Indeed, what does:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>ls -l ./foo
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote>
produce as output?  Indeed, did you do that the right way around?
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>% ln -s /tmp foo &amp;&amp; ls ./foo
</pre></blockquote>
