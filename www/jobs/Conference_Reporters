This is a task that will give you lots of expensive goodies in exchange for
doing it! Reporters get free entrance to conferences (some of which cost
thousands of dollars otherwise), as well as the standard benefits of
attending: learning about the latest technologies, getting the cool
handouts at various booths, etc. All you have to do is drink the champagne,
munch the iced shrimp, wander about, keep good notes, and organize them
into a good, readable form afterwards. :)

However, there are several firm, serious requirements:

1) You have to live, or be willing to regularly travel to, a major area
where conferences are held (e.g., San Francisco in the US.)

2) Any expenses other than the entrance fee are out of your own pocket.
Not that there are any hidden costs, but LG is purely a volunteer
organization - you're on your own when it comes to money.

3) You need to present at least a reasonably professional appearance.
You'll be representing LG in a public venue, and although we don't require
a tuxedo and spats, casual business wear is appropriate, while raggedy
shorts and a ripped "SCREW THE CORPORATIONS!!!" t-shirt are not.

4) You have to have published at least one article with LG before we can
get you in. That's not one of our rules - conference organizers always
require a recent article on a publication's masthead. This presumes at
least reasonable writing ability on your part; frankly, we're going to be
somewhat choosy about this.


Time commitment:
	We'd like to have at least one con report per month. Obviously, if
	none are happening in your area in a given month, then that's how it
	goes - but if you can reliably turn in a dozen reports a year, we're
	satisfied.
