<h1>USB thumb drive RAID</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/weiner.html">January Weiner</a></b></p>

<p>I have a database that I'm working on, and sometimes I need to work
on it on my laptop. However, the database is really demanding, and it is just too
slow on my laptop's hard disk. I quickly found out that the limitation was the
speed of the hard drive, and not so much the CPU. What I needed was a fast
external hard drive. Anyway, I always wanted to play with a RAID system.</p>

<h3>Hard Disk Performance</h3>

<p>There are three parameters of drive speed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read speed</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Write speed</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Access time</strong> - this is the time needed by the
drive to find the place it should read the information from (or write
to) <em>before</em> it starts reading or writing. For example, in your
average hard drive, the head has to move to the physical location on the
magnetic disk.</li> 
</ul>

<p>I do not need fast read/write speed, as the amount of information that
I retrieve from the database is tiny and the db is almost entirely
read-only. However, I do need fast access time: the database is huge, and I
need to retrieve information from different positions in the database very
quickly. That is, I need <em>very low access times</em>, acceptable reading
speed, and I do not care about writing.</p>


<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>It is well known that the so-called "solid-state disks" (SSD) have
very low access times. I could have tried to buy an SSD, but being a tinkerer,
I decided for another option. Thumb drives / flash drives / pen drives are
also a kind of SSDs, one could say - but they have lousy transfer
rates. In the end, I decided to create a software RAID using four 2GB USB
drives. I bought</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 USB drives, 2GB each</li>
  <li>1 USB hub</li>
</ul>


<h3>Setting up the Software RAID</h3>

<p>Prerequisites: you need the mdadm tool (in Debian, simply run
<tt>apt-get install mdadm</tt>).</p>

<p> Insert the drives into the hub, and attach the hub to the computer.
<em>Note: if GNOME or whatever mounts the disks automatically, unmount
them before continuing.</em> First, it is necessary to find out the
names of the devices that were attached:</p>

<pre>
dmesg | grep "Attached SCSI"
sd 56:0:0:0: [sde] Attached SCSI removable disk
sd 57:0:0:0: [sdf] Attached SCSI removable disk
sd 58:0:0:0: [sdg] Attached SCSI removable disk
sd 59:0:0:0: [sdh] Attached SCSI removable disk
</pre>

<p>OK, the devices are /dev/sde, /dev/sdf, /dev/sdg/, /dev/sdh. I want a
RAID-0; that is, no redundancy, and 4x2GB=8GB of space. Creating the RAID
is simple:</p>

<pre>mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sd{e,f,g,h}</pre>

<p>This way, we have a new block device that can be formatted. I use ext2,
since reliability / journaling plays no role:</p>

<pre>
mkfs.ext2 /dev/md0
tune2fs -c 0 -j 0 /dev/md0
mount /dev/md0 /mnt
</pre>

<p>The first command creates the filesystem ("formats" the device); the
second disables regular checks. Finally, the third command mounts the
RAID on the filesystem so we can write data to it and read from it.</p>

<h3>Stopping and Starting the Array</h3>

<h4>Stopping the Array</h4>

<p>Before you stop the array, run the following (and save the output somewhere):</p>

<pre>mdadm --detail /dev/md0</pre>

<p>To stop the array that is running, first unmount the directory (umount /mnt) and then stop the array:</p>

<p>mdadm --stop /dev/md0</p>

<p>Now, you can safely remove the disks and, for example, plug them into
another machine.</p>

<h4>Starting the Array, Again</h4>

<p>Before you can use your RAID again, you need to "assemble" it. This
is easy if you have not removed the disk and try the assembly on the
same machine. In that case, you can just type:</p>

<p>mdadm --verbose -A /dev/md0 /dev/sd{e,f,g,h}</p>

<p>However, what if the device letters have changed (e.g. not e-h, but
i,j.k,l)? Well, you could find out again what the letters are. But there
is a better solution. Remember I told you to save the output from
"mdadm --detail"? It contained a line like that:</p>

<pre>           UUID : d7ea744f:c3963d02:982f0012:7010779c</pre>

<p>Based on this UUID, we can easily "assemble the array" on just any
computer :</p>

<pre>mdadm --verbose -A /dev/md0 -u d7ea744f:c3963d02:982f0012:7010779c</pre>

<p>You can also enter this information in the config file /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</p>

<h3>Performance Tests</h3>

<table border='1'><tbody>
<tr><th>Test</th><th>Description</th><th>Results</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>hdparm</b></td><td>reading</td><td>52 MB/s</td><td>This is twice as good as my laptop, and worse than the 70MB/s of my SATA disk in my workstation</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>dd</b></td><td>writing</td><td>28 MB/s</td><td>Half of what my workstation disk can do</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>seeker</b></td><td>random access</td><td>0.8-1ms</td><td>This is 10-20 times better than an ordinary hard disk</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4>Notes for the Tests</h4>

<ul>

  <li>hdparm: this is a standard Linux utility (in Debian, install with <code>apt-get install hdparm</code>). The command line is as follows: 
  <pre>hdparm -t /dev/md0</pre>

  <li>dd: full command line: <pre>dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test2.bin bs=1M count=1024 conv=fsync</pre></li>

  <li>seeker: I have taken this utility from <a href="http://www.linuxinsight.com/how_fast_is_your_disk.html">this</a>page on disk performance tests. It makes purely random seeks on the device, thus simulating the worst-case scenario when small chunks of data need to be read from all over the place. Command line: <pre>seeker /dev/md0</pre></li>

  <li>furthermore, I have tested the performance of the whole setup with my specific app. It was great! Not as good as the RAM disk that I use for a part of it, but still very, very fast.</li>

  <li>ever since I have set it up a few days ago, I've been using it constantly with a heavy read load and have noticed no problems or errors (like the ones reported <a href="http://www.bigbruin.com/reviews05/thumbraid_1">here</a>).</li>

  <li>Note that the connection speed will be limited by the maximum connection speed of the USB, since 480Mbps (USB 2.0) gives you roughly 60MB/s at most.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Alternatives and Outlook<br></h3>

<p>I have explained here how to create a RAID-0 from four USB thumb drives.
However, most of what I was explaining here applies also to other RAID
types and other disk drives. Even more so! You can combine just about
<em>any</em> devices into a RAID. Well, it only makes sense if the devices
have similar sizes, but (i) you can create a RAID out of RAIDs (e.g., join
two 2GB USB sticks into a RAID0 /dev/md0, then join /dev/md0 with a 4GB USB
stick to get a RAID0 of the size of 8GB...) and (ii) you can combine
devices of different sizes using LVM (the logical volume manager).</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>Apart from some mistakes I made because I did not know 'mdadm', there
were no problems. If you run into any, generally two things are of an
immense help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reading the documentation :-) specifically "man mdadm" and the
links below, and</li>
  <li>studying the kernel messages. This is best done with <pre>tail -f
  /var/log/messages</pre></li>
</ul>
