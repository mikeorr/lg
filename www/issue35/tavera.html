<P> <HR> <P>  

I'm not a hacker, or a computer genius, I'm just a common mortal who
has a computer at home, work with computers at the office and usually
do the same things mortals do on their home and work computers; well,
almost the same things, I really don't like much playing computer games.
<P> 
As many others, I began using computers with commercial software (all
right, let's admit it, I've been using the wintel type platform for
years) and I thought there was nothing better. I can't say anything
about a Mac, maybe some day I'll try one, but, few months ago, reading
some messages on a bbs I found someone saying "....and here I am,
happy with Linux...".
<P> 
-Linux?, What's that?- I thought, -maybe another game...- and I wasn't
really interested on that, so I forgotten at all... almost.
One fine day I asked him about that "Linux" thing, and the answer was
a short explanation about the OS and some of the advantages on using it.
<P> 
My first impression was thinking that UNIX was for a super computer (I
own an AMD K6/166, 32Mb RAM), for strange scientific applications or
big companies, I thought I didn't need it, and after all, most people
say that it's really hard to learn how to use it. I'm not a
programmer, a scientist or so, no, I don't need that. But my curiosity
was increasing and I was asking more people about Linux and I was
surprised on the amount of people using it (I found a Linux users
Group in my home city). The answers and stories were amazing and
exciting, maybe I could give it a try.
<P> 
I bought a book that included a Slackware distribution CD. After
reading the installation section, making a backup of my important
information, learning (on the same book) how to use the fdisk program
(I never thought I had to re-partition my hard disk, so I didn't care
on learning how to do that) and a lot of pray and courage, installed
the new OS in a second partition. All went really well and I've been
learning about Linux and system administration since that day. I have
installed and re-installed different distributions several times
(Slackware, RedHat and S.u.S.E), having success on some items, but
having to read more documentation and information sources on other
ones to make things work. Sometimes I had frustrations (couldn't use
my CD-ROM drive, graphic user interface, sound, printer, modem,
floppy. etc.), I had to read a lot and make questions to the Users
Group. At the end, the results really worth the effort.
<P> 
Frankly, I didn't abandon the wintel side, I was working with the well
known commercial office suite on making documents, commercial graphic
programs, sound applications, using my printer, etc..., the Linux side
was only for navigating on the net, but, two months ago, my computer
refused to start windows, I even couldn't start DOS. I started it from
a floppy, looked for the C:\ drive and found it.  What happened?, I
ran the scandisk program getting a message about a sector damage and
that the disk couldn't be repaired by the program, Oh no!, my hard
disk was dead... 
<P> 
-I still can take the guaranty and the vendor can repair or replace
the hard disk...-, well, the damage was caused by a powercut during a
storm, and they don't support that on the guaranty, so the solution
could be a low-level formatting, but doing that could let the disk
completely useless, so I took the computer back home, thinking that I
would have to wait to have the money to buy a new disk.
<P> 
-Hey, wait a minute!, I didn't try Linux, It may works- and it really
did perfectly so I had to decide, and I did it, save my information to
floppy disks and use the hole disk space (2.1Gb) for Linux.
<P> 
Maybe some superior mind was trying to take me to the light. I've been
learning more on using The OS and its applications. Now, I can print
in full color with my Epson stylus 400 (ghostscript, ghostview,
apsfilter), play sounds, midi files and CD-music with my pnp Yamaha
soundcard (oss/linux sound driver), work with my .doc, .xls, .wks,
.dbf, ... documents (StarOffice 4.0), manipulate, use and print a lot
of graphic files (the Gimp), and of course, get connected to the
world, sending and receiving email, faxes, files, etc. (Netscape,
efax, ncftp), even I play some games.
<P> 
I can change the look and feel of the X Window environment every time
I want, keep my secret and important information away and safe from
intruders (kids), render some strange 3D scene while I compile a new
program to work on my system and update my shares portfolio on the
spreadsheet, taking the data directly from the internet, and receiving
another new application from an ftp site.
<P> 
Next is learn on TV-cards, I have one and want to see my WallStreet
News (MTV, Bay Watch and the Nanny too) on my home computer again, but
using Linux.
Also I want to learn how to set-up a LAN using TCP/IP, for a little
home network (experimental purposes), and maybe for a later small
business.
<P> 
I don't worry about the prices (all the applications I use came with
the distributions or I got them from the net) and the legal stuff,
almost everything I have installed is free software (mostly GNU Public
License).
<P> 
Now I can solve a lot of problems in the office, and have nice talks
with the systems guys, I can understand all what they say (as I said,
I'm not a programmer or a hacker, I buy and sale shares, screaming and
pushing people all day, but we use computers to get the orders and
register the trades). As the post on the bbs said, ...and here I am,
happy, with Linux...
<P> 
I'm still saving for another hard disk (and a UPS to prevent surprise
powercuts)..., I admit it, I'm going to install (maybe) a win95
portion on that disk (it's easier to use for my wife, by now), but I
can take my time, because my good old HDD was dead, and now, It's
again alive.
