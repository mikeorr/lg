<h1>Gmail on Home Linux Box using Postfix and Fetchmail</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/chirico.html">Mike Chirico</A></b></p>

<p>

<h3>Gmail on your Home Linux Box using Postfix and Fetchmail</h3>

<p>
Do you have a Gmail account? In that case, you'll want to read this step
by step tutorial for configuring and installing the latest version
of <a href="http://www.postfix.com">Postfix</a> with SASL
authentication and TLS encryption necessary for connecting and
relaying Gmail to smtp.gmail.com. Plus, I'll walk you through
configuring <a href=
"http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/">fetchmail</a> (with
STARTTLS), which will grab (fetch) Gmail to your local system. But
it does not stop there. You'll learn how to forward mail to other
computers you have in the house, plus how to automatically backup
copies of email.
</p>

<h3>Quick Background</h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.postfix.com">Postfix</a> is a mail server, or
MTA (Mail Transfer Agent). It accepts messages and delivers them.
In contrast, <a href=
"http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/">fetchmail</a> is a
remote-mail retrieval system, providing home users like you (and
me), who don't have corporate accounts, the ability to pull down
mail from an ISP, or in this case Gmail, to our local Linux box.
All examples are done and tested with the fake domain name
"squeezel", which is my 4 year old's word for the concatenation of
"squeeze" and "wheezel" (weasel). You should choose a unique, fake,
domain name, or one that you do not anticipate going to on the
Internet.
</p>


<h3>Safety First: Configure fetchmail with STARTTLS</h3>
<p>
It is very important to setup <a href=
"http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/">fetchmail</a> with some type
of encryption; otherwise, your Gmail password will be broadcast
over the Internet every time the fetchmail daemon tries to pick up
mail. In addition, this tutorial will walk you through building and
configuring the latest version of Postfix with TLS and SASL support.
</p>


<h3>Getting Postfix Source: Latest Version, More Toys</h3>

<h4>1. Downloading Postfix Source</h4>

<p>
Get the latest version of Postfix. As of this writing, the
latest version is 2.2.3, which was released on May 3, 2005. You can
find out what version you have with the following command.
</p>

<pre>
  $ postconf mail_version
   mail_version = 2.2.3
</pre>

<p>
Download the latest version from the <a
href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix Home Page</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.ncftp.com/ncftp/">NcFTP</a> is a popular
alternative to ftp. If you don't have it, ftp or wget both work fine.
This example is done with postfix-2.2.3 - Again, check for
updates.
</p>

<pre>
    $ ncftpget ftp://mirrors.loonybin.net/pub/postfix/official/postfix-2.2.3.tar.gz
    $ ncftpget ftp://mirrors.loonybin.net/pub/postfix/official/postfix-2.2.3.tar.gz.sig
    $ ncftpget ftp://mirrors.loonybin.net/pub/postfix/wietse.pgp

</pre>

<p>
Next, import the PGP key.
</p>

<pre>
    $ gpg --import wietse.pgp
    gpg: key C12BCD99: public key "Wietse Venema &lt;wietse@porcupine.org&gt;" imported
    gpg: key D5327CB9: public key "wietse venema &lt;wietse@porcupine.org&gt;" imported
    gpg: Total number processed: 2
    gpg:               imported: 2  (RSA: 2)
</pre>

<p>
Verify that the source is valid:
</p>

<pre>
    $ gpg --verify postfix-2.2.3.tar.gz.sig postfix-2.2.3.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
The next step is to unpack the file.
</p>

<pre>
    $ tar -xzf postfix-2.2.3.tar.gz
</pre>
<br>

<h3>2. Compiling Postfix with TLS and SASL support</h3>

<p>
Okay, you're connecting to Google's Gmail, so you'll need to
compile Postfix with TLS (for encryption) and SASL (for
authentication). You cannot send mail to your Gmail account without
these.
</p>


<h4>2.1 First Upgrade OpenSSL and SASL</h4>
<p>
Special note: some older versions of Red Hat 8 and 9 may not have
an updated version of <a href=
"http://www.openssl.org/source/">openssl</a>. Check to see what
version you have with the following command:
</p>

<pre>
    $ openssl version
    OpenSSL 0.9.7g 11 Apr 2005
</pre>

<p>
If you need to upgrade openssl, find out where the current
<code>openssl</code> directory is located. The default settings for openssl
put it in <code>/usr/local/ssl</code>, but Red Hat and Fedora users have the
following directory instead: <code>/usr/share/ssl</code>. Since my computers
are Red Hat 9.0 and Fedora Core 2 and 3, the executable is
<code>/usr/bin/openssl</code> and the related directories are <code>/usr/share/ssl</code>.
Therefore, I'll compile it with the following settings:
</p>

<pre>
    $ ./config --prefix=/usr  --openssldir=/usr/share/ssl
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install
</pre>


<h4>2.2 Upgrading Cyrus SASL</h4>
<p>
You may have authentication problems without the latest upgrade.
I had the following error in my <code>/var/log/maillog</code> with the default
Fedora 3 install; however, the cyrus-sasl package from source fixed
the problem.
</p>

<pre>
    Authentication failed: cannot SASL authenticate to server smtp.gmail.com[64.233.163.109]:
    no mechanism available
</pre>

<p>
You can get the latest "cyrus-sasl" package from
<a href="ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/">ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/</a>; make sure you search
for the latest one. As of this writing, the latest version is 2.1.20.
</p>

<pre>
    $  ncftpget ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/cyrus-mail/cyrus-sasl-2.1.20.tar.gz
</pre>

<p>
You will probably want to upgrade this package, as
it provides new tools for creating certificates.  Some older
versions may cause problems when Postfix is compiled due to an
outdated "ssh.h" file.
</p>


<h4>2.3 Add Postfix User (postfix) and Group (postdrop)</h4>
<p>
So, at this stage, you've upgraded openssl and sasl, correct? If
you have authentication failures, then upgrade those packages. I
had problems with Fedora Core 3 "rpm" installs, so I had to go back
and upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Next, you will add "postfix" as a user. You don't want this user to have a
home directory ("-M"), or login capability ("-s /sbin/nologin"). So, we
create it like this:
</p>

<pre>
    # useradd -M -s /sbin/nologin postfix
    # groupadd postdrop
</pre>


<h4>2.4 Make Options</h4>
<p>
You do not need to add "postfix" to the group "postdrop" - it lives alone.
</p>

<p>
Now you are ready to run 'make'. If you need to re-run 'make', you
should first issue the "make tidy" command to clean up the old files.
</p>

<p>
Choose "Option 1" below if you don't have MySQL. Postfix can
work with MySQL tables, so it may be something you want to try
later, after you get your Gmail working.
</p>


<strong>Cleaning Up Everything if Needed</strong>

<pre>
    $ make tidy
</pre>

  <h4>Option 1: TLS and SASL2. You need at least these for Gmail.</h4>

<pre>
    $ make makefiles CCARGS="-DUSE_TLS -DUSE_SASL_AUTH -I/usr/include/sasl" \
          AUXLIBS="-lssl -lcrypto -lsasl2"
</pre>


<h4>Option 2: TLS, SASL2 and MySQL.</h4>

<pre>
    $ make makefiles CCARGS="-DUSE_TLS -DUSE_SASL_AUTH -I/usr/include/sasl  -DHAS_MYSQL \
    -I/usr/local/include/mysql" AUXLIBS="-lssl -lcrypto -L/usr/local/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient \
    -lz -lm -lsasl2"
</pre>

<strong>Or, if MySQL libs are in "/usr/lib/mysql", then, something like this:</strong>

<pre>
    $ make makefiles CCARGS="-DUSE_TLS -DUSE_SASL_AUTH -I/usr/include/sasl  -DHAS_MYSQL \
    -I/usr/include/mysql" AUXLIBS="-lssl -lcrypto -L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lz -lm \
    -lsasl2"
    $ make
    $ make install

</pre>

<h4>2.5 Install Questions</h4>
<p>
After the "make install" you will be asked questions on where to
place files. Unless you need to do otherwise, <strong>take the
defaults</strong>. This will make it easy to follow the directions
later.
</p>

<p>
There are questions prompted when running 'make install':
</p>

<pre>
        Warning: if you use this script to install Postfix locally,
        this script will replace existing sendmail or Postfix programs.
        Make backups if you want to be able to recover.

        Before installing files, this script prompts you for some definitions.
        Most definitions will be remembered, so you have to specify them
        only once. All definitions should have a reasonable default value.

    Please specify the prefix for installed file names. Specify this ONLY
    if you are building ready-to-install packages for distribution to other
    machines.
    install_root: [/]

    Please specify a directory for scratch files while installing Postfix. You
    must have write permission in this directory.
    tempdir: [/home/src/postfix/postfix-2.2.2]

    Please specify the final destination directory for installed Postfix
    configuration files.
    config_directory: [/etc/postfix]

 ... [SNIP] ...

    pages. You can no longer specify "no" here.
    manpage_directory: [/usr/local/man]

    Please specify the destination directory for the Postfix README
    files. Specify "no" if you do not want to install these files.
    readme_directory: [no]
</pre>

<h4>2.6 What Libraries are Linked in?</h4>
<p>
Once you are done, as a check to see if ssl has been compiled
into postfix, you can "ldd" the "postfix" file as follows, which
will show the linked libraries.
</p>

<pre>
    $ ldd /usr/sbin/postfix
        libssl.so.4 =&gt; /lib/libssl.so.4 (0x007ae000)
        libcrypto.so.4 =&gt; /lib/libcrypto.so.4 (0x006bb000)
        libmysqlclient.so.14 =&gt; /usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.so.14 (0x00b28000)
        libz.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x00bf1000)
        libm.so.6 =&gt; /lib/tls/libm.so.6 (0x00afd000)
        libsasl2.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libsasl2.so.2 (0x005f6000)
        libpcre.so.0 =&gt; /lib/libpcre.so.0 (0x00d46000)
        libdb-4.2.so =&gt; /lib/tls/i686/libdb-4.2.so (0x00201000)
        libnsl.so.1 =&gt; /lib/libnsl.so.1 (0x007e4000)
        libresolv.so.2 =&gt; /lib/libresolv.so.2 (0x00d30000)
        libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/tls/libc.so.6 (0x009d1000)
        libgssapi_krb5.so.2 =&gt; /usr/lib/libgssapi_krb5.so.2 (0x006a5000)
        libkrb5.so.3 =&gt; /usr/lib/libkrb5.so.3 (0x0061b000)
        libcom_err.so.2 =&gt; /lib/libcom_err.so.2 (0x005f1000)
        libk5crypto.so.3 =&gt; /usr/lib/libk5crypto.so.3 (0x00682000)
        libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00b22000)
        libcrypt.so.1 =&gt; /lib/libcrypt.so.1 (0x032cb000)
        /lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x009b7000)
        libpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib/tls/libpthread.so.0 (0x00c13000)
</pre>

<p>
Looks like they're all installed. Above the first line with "libssl.so"
shows that I have "ssl" installed; then, 6 lines down after the command you
will see "libsasl2.so.2". So, in my version, did I choose MySQL? The best
way to tell is with the "postconf -m" option. But, yes, some of you may
have a sharp eye and noticed the "libz" and "libm" linked in, which goes
with the MySQL install.
</p>


<h4>2.7 Accessible Shared Libraries</h4>
<p>
By the way, if you get odd MySQL errors during the "make
install", and your mysql libraries live in "/usr/local/lib/mysql",
then you may need to add an entry in your "/etc/ld.so.conf" file
to include "/usr/local/lib/mysql" as follows:
</p>

<pre>
     $ cat /etc/ld.so.conf
     ...
     /usr/local/lib/mysql
</pre>

<p>
After adding this line, you must run the "ldconfig" command.
Now, all those odd mysql libraries will be found. It's good technique
if you install a lot of software from source.
</p>

<p>
At this stage, there are still some postfix configuration
settings. You'll get back to them; but first, it makes sense to
generate the "Certificates".
</p>


<h3>3. Generating Certificates</h3>

<p>
Again, before getting started, make sure you have the latest
version of <a href="http://www.openssl.org/source/">openssl</a>. As
of this writing, 0.9.7g is the latest version. See the steps above if
you decide to upgrade.
</p>

<pre>
    $ openssl version
    OpenSSL 0.9.7g 11 Apr 2005
</pre>


<h4>3.1 Creating Your Own Certificate Authority (CA)</h4>
<p>
You can get signed certificates from Thawte and VeriSign; but
you don't have to for your home system. Instead, you will become
your own "Certificate Authority", and sign your own SSL
certificates.
</p>

<p>
This is the command to create your own CA. Hit 'return' for the
first prompt to create the CA. It will prompt you for a password, and
prompt to confirm. Remember the password. Also, it's important that the
"Organization Name" match, when you create the "server" certificate. Below
I have shown you my answers in bold, so you can see how they will match
when creating and signing certificates.
</p>

<pre>
    $ /usr/local/ssl/misc/CA.pl -newca
      CA certificate filename (or enter to create)

      Making CA certificate ...
      Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
      .......++++++
      ...................++++++
      writing new private key to './demoCA/private/cakey.pem'
      Enter PEM pass phrase: <strong>password123</strong>
      Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: <strong>password123</strong>
      -----
      You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
      into your certificate request.
      What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
      There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
      For some fields there will be a default value,
      If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
      -----
      Country Name (2 letter code) [US]:<strong>US</strong>
      State or Province Name (full name) [Pennsylvania]:<strong>Pennsylvania</strong>
      Locality Name (eg, city) []:<strong>Elkins Park</strong>
      Organization Name (eg, company) []:<strong>Chirico_Widgets</strong>

     ...
</pre>

<p>
By the way, if after doing the above command you find that you
want to extend the key - say you didn't change the "default_days =
3650", or you did and want to change it back, then, you can issue
the following command.
</p>

<pre>
  Manual method to go back and change days value

    $ openssl x509 -in demoCA/cacert.pem -days 1024 -out cacert.pem -signkey \
    demoCA/private/cakey.pem
    $ cp cacert.pem demoCA
</pre>

<p>
Or, you could hard-code these values in "/usr/openssl.cnf", if you
find that you're doing this over and over for testing. However, as
you can see from the above command, it is easy enough to change the
values.
</p>


<h4>3.2 Generate the Server Certificate</h4>
<p>
This is the server certificate request that will be signed by
the CA Authority.
</p>

<p>
Note, below that the "-nodes" option is used so that the
certificate will not require a pass phrase each time the secure
daemon is started. Below I have also added my fake domain name
"squeezel.squeezel.com", and
</p>

<pre>
    $ openssl req -new -nodes \
      -subj '/CN=squeezel.squeezel.com/O=Chirico_Widgets/C=US/ST=Pennsylvania/L=Elkins Park' \
       -keyout FOO-key.pem -out FOO-req.pem -days 3650
</pre>

<p>
Note above that "/0=Chirico_Widgets" must match the name given
in the the original CA. For example, "/0=Widgets co." will not
work, because it doesn't match. It must be exact.
</p>


<h4>3.3 Sign the Server Certificate</h4>
<p>
The following steps will sign the certificate.
</p>

<pre>
    $ openssl ca -out FOO-cert.pem -infiles FOO-req.pem
</pre>


<h4>3.4 Copy Signed Certificates to /etc/postfix/certs</h4>
<p>
The next step copies over all the required certificates to where
Postfix can find them. In addition, the correct rights are enforced
on each file.
</p>

<pre>
   $ cp demoCA/cacert.pem FOO-key.pem FOO-cert.pem /etc/postfix
   $ chmod 644 /etc/postfix/FOO-cert.pem /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
   $ chmod 400 /etc/postfix/FOO-key.pem
</pre>


<h3>4. Configuring Postfix</h3>
<p>
The file "/etc/postfix/main.cf" and "/etc/postfix/master.cf" are
the two basic Postfix configuration files.
</p>

<p>
Postfix is particular about the hostname of your computer. You can
have a fake hostname. In fact, the fake hostname that I am using is
"squeezel.squeezel.com". Pick a name and set it up as follows. By
the way you can actually use "squeezel.squeezel.com" if you want,
since it's not a real domain name; but, you might want to use
something more descriptive. The point here is it doesn't have to be
registered to you; but it does have to be unique.
</p>


<h4>4.1 Configure the Hostname</h4>
<p>
The computer that these examples are taken from is
"squeezel.squeezel.com", and it exists on IP address 192.168.1.81.
The short name is just "squeezel". Another computer, on IP address
"192.168.1.155" is "tape.squeezel.com".
</p>

<pre>
     /etc/hosts

    # Do not remove the following line, or various programs
    # that require network functionality will fail.
    127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain           localhost
    192.168.1.81    squeezel.squeezel.com           squeezel
    192.168.1.155   tape.squeezel.com               tape
</pre>

<p>
You may also want to edit "/etc/sysconfig/network" and add or
check the following.
</p>

<pre>
    HOSTNAME=squeezel.squeezel.com
</pre>

<p>
Finally, to put all changes into effect now, run the following
command with root privileges.
</p>

<pre>
   $ hostname squeezel.squeezel.com
</pre>

<p>
Some of the settings in the postfix main.cf file depend upon the
hostname.
</p>


<h4>4.2 main.cf</h4>
<p>
The following settings can be added to the end of the
"/set/postfix/main.cf" file. Postfix reads this file from top to
bottom, taking the last values assigned in this file.
</p>

<pre>
    ##   Add these lines to the bottom on main.cf
    ##
    ##


    ## TLS Settings
    #
    smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
    smtp_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/FOO-cert.pem
    smtp_tls_key_file = /etc/postfix/FOO-key.pem
    smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:/var/run/smtp_tls_session_cache
    smtp_use_tls = yes
    smtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
    smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/FOO-cert.pem
    smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/postfix/FOO-key.pem
    smtpd_tls_received_header = yes
    smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:/var/run/smtpd_tls_session_cache
    smtpd_use_tls = yes
    tls_random_source = dev:/dev/urandom

    ##  SASL Settings
    # This is going in to THIS server
    smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = no
    # We need this
    smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
    smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
    smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $myhostname
    smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
    #smtp_sasl_security_options =
    smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous
    smtpd_sasl_application_name = smtpd


    ## Gmail Relay
    relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]

    ## Good for Testing
    # sender_bcc_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/bcc_table

    # Disable DNS Lookups
    disable_dns_lookups = yes
    #
    # Great New feature Address Mapping
    #  for example may mchirico@localhost to mchirico@gmail.com
    smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
    #
    #
    transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
</pre>

<p>
The TLS settings are pretty standard, and the above code is
taken from the <a href=
"http://www.postfix.com/TLS_README.html">documentation</a>, which
is worth a read. Note the "*.pem" files would appear to be listed
twice; however, notice the difference between "smtp" and "smtpd".
One is for client connectivity and the other is for connecting to
this server.
</p>

<h4>4.3 sasl_passwd</h4>
<p>
In the above "main.cf" file, there are several hashed files, or
<a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/">Berkeley DB</a> files which
will have to be created. Look again at the recommended entries in
"main.cf", and you will notice "hash:" in front of these values.
For example "hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd".
</p>

<p>
Below is a sample sasl_passwd file. This will login to
smtp.gmail.com with username mchirico, using the password
<strong>pa33w0r8</strong>.
</p>

<pre>
    # Contents of sasl_passwd
    #
    [smtp.gmail.com]              mchirico@gmail.com:pa33w0r8
</pre>

<p>
Next, this file must be converted to hash format, with the
following command.
</p>

<pre>
    $ cd /etc/postmap
    $ postmap sasl_passwd
</pre>

<p>
The "postmap" command must be run anytime "sasl_passwd" is changed, because
this creates the "sasl_passwd.db" that postfix reads.
</p>

<p>
After you have run the above command, run this simple "hash"
key test.
</p>

<pre>
    $ postmap -q [smtp.gmail.com] sasl_passwd
      mchirico@gmail.com:pa33w0r8
</pre>


<h4>4.4 generic</h4>
<p>
The file "/etc/postfix/generic" contains the following
entries.
</p>

<pre>
    chirico@squeezel.squeezel.com         mchirico@gmail.com
</pre>


<h4>4.5 transport</h4>
<pre>
    # Contents of /etc/postfix/transport
    #
    # This sends mail to Gmail
    gmail.com               smtp:[smtp.gmail.com]
    #
    # Except mail going to the tape and closet server
    tape.squeezel.com        relay:[tape.squeezel.com]
    closet.squeezel.com      relay:[closet.squeezel.com]
</pre>

<p>
The transport file sends all email to Gmail or "smtp.gmail.com", but
internal mail on my network is relayed to the appropriate servers. From
above, sending an email to "root@tape" does not route it to the google
account. The return address is "chirico@squeezel.squeezel.com" because
of the following entry in "master.cf".
</p>


<h4>4.6 master.cf</h4>
<p>
This file must be owned by root. Whenever changes are made to
this file, postfix should be reloaded with "postfix reload"
command.
</p>

<pre>
   smtp      unix  -       -       n       -       -       smtp
   relay     unix  -       -       n       -       -       smtp
        -o smtp_generic_maps=
</pre>

<p>
Note the empty "smtp_generic_maps=" with nothing after the
equals sign. This means anything relayed, anything going to
"tape.squeezel.com" or "closet.squeezel.com" will not have an
address translation - only the email going out to Gmail. What about mail
from "squeezel.squeezel.com" to itself? No address translation
either, which is a feature of "smtp_generic_maps".
</p>

<p>
That is it for the server certificate. Postfix will still have
to be configured to connect to your ISP.
</p>


<h4>4.7 Postfix setup - utilizing "postconf -n"</h4>
<p>
To see if all the changes went into effect, here is the output of
the "postconf -n" command.
</p>

<pre>
    [root@squeezel ~]# postconf -n
    command_directory = /usr/sbin
    config_directory = /etc/postfix
    daemon_directory = /usr/libexec/postfix
    debug_peer_level = 2
    disable_dns_lookups = yes
    html_directory = no
    mail_owner = postfix
    mailq_path = /usr/bin/mailq
    manpage_directory = /usr/local/man
    newaliases_path = /usr/bin/newaliases
    queue_directory = /var/spool/postfix
    readme_directory = no
    relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]
    sample_directory = /etc/postfix
    sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail
    setgid_group = postdrop
    smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic

    smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
    smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous
    smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
    smtp_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/FOO-cert.pem

    smtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/cacert.pem
    smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/FOO-cert.pem
    smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/postfix/FOO-key.pem
    smtpd_tls_received_header = yes

    smtpd_use_tls = yes
    tls_random_source = dev:/dev/urandom
    transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport
    unknown_local_recipient_reject_code = 550
</pre>


<h4>4.8 Common Postfix Commands</h4>
<pre>
    $ /etc/init.d/postfix restart   # restarts postfix needed for inet_interfaces changes
    $ postfix reload                # reloads most changes in main.cf
    $ postfix check                 # checks postfix configuration
    $ postconf -n                   # dumps setting that went into effect
    $ postconf -m                   # shows the map types: mysql, hash, regexp ...
    $ postmap &lt;filename&gt;            # creates a map file for transports, sender_canonical etc.
    $ postqueue -p                  # checks the queue
    $ postsuper -d ALL              # deletes all messages in the queue
    $ postsuper -d AC8231EDA2D      # deletes message AC8231EDA2D
    $ postconf mail_version         # this tells you what version of Postfix you are using
</pre>


<h4>4.9 MySQL</h4>
<p>
Instead of using the hash type, you can leverage MySQL. Below is
a sample "smtp_generic_maps" configuration for converting
addresses. The text below is the "/etc/postfix/generic_mysql" file.
Note, that is contains the MySQL username, password for MySQL, and
the database "dbname" in this file. The comments show how this
table was created in MySQL.
</p>

<pre>
    #  The entry in main.cf is
    #    smtp_generic_maps = mysql:/etc/postfix/generic_mysql
    #
    # This is the MySQL table definition
    # create table smtpg_maps (
    #  pkey int NOT NULL auto_increment,
    #  address varchar(50),
    #  smtp_address varchar(50),
    #  timeEnter timestamp(14),
    #  PRIMARY KEY (pkey));
    #
    #  insert into smtpg_maps (address,smtp_address) values ('chirico@squeezel.squeezel.com',
    #  'mchirico@gmail.com');
    #  insert into smtpg_maps (address,smtp_address) values ('lpayne@squeezel.squeezel.com',
    #  'payne.lisa@gmail.com');
    #  insert into smtpg_maps (address,smtp_address) values ('root@squeezel.squeezel.com',
    #  'mike.chirico@gmail.com');
    #
    # Test this with
    #  $ postmap -q "root@squeezel.squeezel.com" mysql:/etc/postfix/generic_mysql
    #
    hosts = localhost
    user = mysqlmail
    password = S0m3paSSw0r9
    dbname = mail
    query = SELECT smtp_address  FROM smtpg_maps WHERE address = '%s'
</pre>


<h4>4.10 Additional Items</h4>
<p>
If you are using Fedora Core, which defaults to Sendmail, you
may need to make a few configuration changes. For example, you may
be picking up the incorrect version of sendmail.
</p>

<pre>
     $  alternatives --config mta

      There are 2 programs which provide 'mta'.

      Selection    Command
      -----------------------------------------------
      *+ 1           /usr/sbin/sendmail.sendmail
      2           /usr/sbin/sendmail.postfix

      Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number:
</pre>

<p>
You will want to select 2, above. If you now do an "ls" on
'sendmail', you will see the following results:
</p>

<pre>
$ ls -l /usr/sbin/sendmail
  lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 21 Jan 13 20:53 /usr/sbin/sendmail -&gt; /etc/alternatives/mta
  [root@squeezel ~]# ls -l /etc/alternatives/mta
  lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 26 Apr 28 10:23 /etc/alternatives/mta -&gt; /usr/sbin/sendmail.postfix
</pre>

<p>
Now try sending email. The "correct" sendmail will build a
report that you can view with "mutt" or any other email client. Below is
an example of a test:
</p>

<pre>
    $ sendmail -bv zmchirico@yahoo.com
</pre>


<h4>4.10.1 Backups with bcc</h4>
<p>
Any mail sent out from "gmchirico@squeezel.squeezel.com" can be
blind copied to another server. In this case the server is
"chirico@tape".
</p>

<pre>
    Contents in /etc/postfix/main.cf
      sender_bcc_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/bcc_table
</pre>

<p>
Remember to "postmap bcc_table" after editing the bcc_table
file.
</p>

<pre>
    Contents of  /etc/postfix/bcc_table
     gmchirico@squeezel.squeezel.com chirico@tape
</pre>

<p>
If you want to get copies of everything coming in and going out,
then use the "always_bcc" option. I normally create a special user
for this "allmail", that way I can forward email easily if
needed.
</p>

<pre>
    Setting in /etc/postfix/main.cf
     always_bcc = allmail
</pre>

<p>
It's not a completely blind copy, since it will show up when
users on the system do a "sendmail -bv" test.
</p>


<h3>Fetchmail</h3>


<h4>Why Fetchmail?</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/fetchmail/">Fetchmail</a>
pulls the email down from Google's Gmail, since for a home user
with a fake domain and changing IP address, their email server will
not forward the email.
</p>


<h4>5. Safety First: Configure fetchmail with STARTTLS</h4>
<p>
Again, it is very important to setup fetchmail with some type of
encryption. STARTTLS encryption works well, since you have already
installed the necessary openssl files. You just need to pick up the
necessary keys and put them in the proper format.
</p>


<h4>5.1 Google Gmail Certificates</h4>
<pre>
    $ openssl s_client -connect smtp.gmail.com:995 -showcerts
</pre>

<p>
The command above will return the certificate from Google's
Gmail as follows:
</p>

<pre>

<h4>5.2 Extract Certificate</h4>
<p>
Next, you need to copy the certificate part, which is everything
between the "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" part and "END CERTIFICATE" part,
and save this to a file.
</p>

<pre>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  d3RlLmNvbTAMBgNVHRMBAf8EAjAAMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBBAUAA4GBAD4f2AcBn4WD
  eF07St93dsdbqGYdlMrCquN6yd6WvYoNRosX0N4nMtKTJN6CNAgs2lvfL1qSChYf

  L83QaTlPJVKkwLgKVGM8Yk349y32Nr9D
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
</pre>

<p>
However, notice above that the CA for this certificate is
thawte.com, which means you need that certificate as well. This is
a very common certificate. Normally you can cut and paste them from
<a href=
"http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/cert.pem">"/usr/share/ssl/cert.pem"</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you look closely at that file you'll see the certificate. Or,
you can copy it from below.
</p>

<h4>5.3 Certificate of the CA - Thawte</h4>
<pre>

-----END CERTIFICATE-----

</pre>

<p>
To recap: you should have the two certificates saved to separate
files. In my case I've labeled them <a href=
"http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/googlepop.pem">googlepop.pem</a>
and <a href=
"http://ftp1.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/thawte.pem">thawte.pem</a>
</p>


<h4>5.4 Rehash or Creating Symlinks</h4>
<p>
Once you have created these files, you will need to run the
"c_rehash" command to create the necessary sym-links. I've copied
the files in "/home/chirico/certs/.certs". Then, shown below the
running the "c_rehash" command.
</p>

<pre>
    [chirico@squeezel certs]$ c_rehash .certs
    Doing .certs
    googlepop.pem =&gt; 34ceaf75.0
    thawte.pem =&gt; ddc328ff.0
</pre>


<h4>5.5 Checking the Certificate</h4>
<p>
It's possible to check the certificates as with the "openssl
s_client" command as follows:
</p>

<pre>
    $  openssl s_client -connect pop.gmail.com:995 -CApath /home/chirico/certs/.certs/
    CONNECTED(00000003)
    depth=1 /C=ZA/ST=Western Cape/L=Cape Town/O=Thawte Consulting cc/OU=Certification Services
    Division/CN=Thawte Server CA/emailAddress=server-certs@thawte.com
    verify return:1
    depth=0 /C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google Inc/CN=pop.gmail.com
    verify return:1
    ---
    Certificate chain
     0 s:/C=US/ST=California/L=Mountain View/O=Google Inc/CN=pop.gmail.com
       i:/C=ZA/ST=Western Cape/L=Cape Town/O=Thawte Consulting cc/OU=Certification Services 
       Division/CN=Thawte Server CA/emailAddress=server-certs@thawte.com
    ---
    Server certificate
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    ... [SNIP] ...
    ---
    +OK Gpop ready.
</pre>


<h4>5.6 The Fetchmail config .fetchmailrc</h4>
<p>
Note that the fetchmail option <strong>sslcertck</strong>, seen
below in the ".fetchmailrc" file, causes fetchmail to strictly
check the server certificate against a set of local trusted
certificates.
</p>

<p>
Below is a sample ".fetchmailrc" file, the file that should be
stored in your home directory.
</p>

<pre>
    #
    #
    # Sample /home/chirico/.fetchmailrc file for Gmail
    #
    # Check mail every 90 seconds
    set daemon 90
    set syslog
    set postmaster chirico
    #set bouncemail
    #
    # Google Gmail  is mchirico but on computer it is chirico
    #  To keep mail on the server use the you would put keep at the end.
    # user 'mchirico@gmail.com' with pass "pa33w0r8"  is 'chirico' here options ssl sslcertck
    # sslcertpath '/home/chirico/certs/.certs' keep
    #
    poll pop.gmail.com with proto POP3 and options no dns
	 user 'mchirico@gmail.com' with pass "pa33w0r8"  is 'chirico' here options ssl
	 sslcertck  sslcertpath '/home/chirico/certs/.certs'
         smtphost localhost
    # You would use this to by-pass Postfix
    # mda '/usr/bin/procmail -d %T'
</pre>

<p>
Normally you would want to start fetchmail with the "-v" option and take a
look at the "/var/log/maillog" files for any problems.
</p>


<h4>5.7 Fetchmail Commands</h4>
<p>
Below are some of the more common fetchmail commands.
</p>

<pre>
    $ fetchmail -q    # quits fetchmail daemon
    $ fetchmail -v    # start fetchmail daemon in verbose mode
    $ fetchmail -c    # checks for email only
    $ fetchmail -S localhost # delivers mail to you Postfix server
</pre>
