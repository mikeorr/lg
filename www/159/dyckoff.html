<h1>Away Mission: 2008 in Review - part 1</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>


<p>
The past year saw a number of conference trends.  Many formerly large
conferences have layered related topics and sub-conferences in order to
hold on to their audiences. LinuxWorld, for example, added mobility tracks
and the "Next Generation Data Center" conference for the last two years and
now has changed its name to OpenSource World for 2009. USENIX events also
had many overlapping related conferences occurring alongside its major
events.
</p>  

<p>
But 2008 generally saw established conferences shrinking due to tighter
budgets, increasing travel costs, and the deepening recession. Balancing
this trend, there were many more tightly focused events springing out of
the myriad of Open Source Communities. There were also many more on-line
"virtual" conferences that could satisfy keynote attendees (although, in
this reporter's opinion, the limited expo venues associated with these
virtual events just can't replace the sights, sounds, and swag of a real
expo.)
</p>

<p>
An example of such a virtual conference was the SOA and Virtualization
events by TechTarget, IDG and ZDnet. Here's a recent one:
<a href="http://datacenterdecisions.techtarget.com/seminars/AEV-virtualseminar.html">http://datacenterdecisions.techtarget.com/seminars/AEV-virtualseminar.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Along the same lines, certain conferences added or expanded video coverage,
often for a lower fee than full conference attendance, allowing people to
attend 'on-line'. Several USENIX events had live video feeds provided by <a
href="http://Linux-Magazin.de">Linux-Magazin.de</a>, and these are
available as an archive for review by attendees. This approach means no
conference bag or networking opportunities, but definitely is easier on
both the budget and the body.
</p>

<p>
Many newer conferences such as QCon and Best SD Practices for SW developers
and project managers saw modest growth.
</p>  

<h3>The Leviathan - Oracle OpenWorld</h3>

<p>
One of the largest events just keeps getting larger: Oracle OpenWorld (OOW). It
had over 42,000 attendees with multliple overlapping sub-conferences such
as Oracle Develop and the JDEdwards, Siebel, and BEA conferences. In fact
it shifted into the September timeframe that BEA used for its annual user
conference, abandoning Oracle's traditional early November timeframe.
</p> 

<p>
New this year was a comprehensive video and session material archive. This
was a joint venture between Oracle and Altus Learning Systems, which
provides digital media production services to companies for internal and
external use.
</p>

<p>
There were 1900 technical and general sessions and these are all archived.
Additionally, all Open Oracle World (OOW) keynotes are fully archived, with
searchable text transcripts and all slides timed and reposted.   This
allows a user to search for a phrase in the transcript, then view the
accompanying slide and hear the associated audio.   This could be a good
way to jog one's memory months after attending the conference, as well as
exploring sessions not attended by quickly scanning for desired content.
Altus is hoping this makes access and repurposing of content easier for users
of their service.
</p>

<p>
I was given an opportunity to discuss the multimedia archive with some of
the principals before Oracle OpenWorld. One of the key points of the
discussion was that only a limited sampling of sessions would be available
as a teaser to the public; most of these would be the keynote sessions that
are usually available on-line after a conference. I had specifically asked
about having one or two of these sample sessions being about Linux or
Oracle Open Source collaborations and was assured at least one such session
would be available for preview. But, as fate is fickle, my contact spoke to
me shortly after Oracle OpenWorld (OOW) and said the chosen Linux session
would only be available for a short time, not past LG's next publication
date in October.
</p>  

<p>
Here is the Aldus OOW preview page, which also hosts most of the OOW
keynotes: <a href="http://ondemandpreview.vportal.net/">http://ondemandpreview.vportal.net/</a> 
</p>

<p>
Now the flip side of this: Apparently, if you did not attend the 2008
event, you can get all media at the Oracle OpenWorld OnDemand portal but
have to pay US$700. OOW-08 attendees can use the OOW 'course catalog' to
get only the slides for most presentations - or pay $400 to access the
portal. This is very different from previous years where slides were
made available to the public on the Oracle Technical Network (OTN).
</p>

<p>
However, in a publicly viewable thread, the following information is
available:

Use this for login and for accessing each presentation.
</p>

<p>
Using that info, you can download a presentation on the Coherence

<p>
To get a multi-media view of this material, this video covers Oracle
Coherence Data Grid - formerly the Tangorsol product line:<br>

</p>

<p>
To access the Linux-oriented presenatations from the OOW catalog, go to the
portal link, login, and then select "Linux and Virtualization" from only
the focus area pull-down, set the other pull-downs to "All".
</p>

<p>
Here is a link to the rather extensive OOW "Unconference" listed on the OOW
wiki: <a href="http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+OpenWorld+Unconference?t=anon">http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+OpenWorld+Unconference?t=anon</a> 
</p>


<p>
The big event at OOW was the announcement of the Oracle-HP eXaData database
machine.  Jet black in its rack and wearing the new "X" logo, it was
pretty and powerful with an impressive set of specs.  But it also sported a
huge price tag, over a million dollars for starters, which effectively meant it
competed with the high end SMP boxes like Convex and Teradata.  It is very
fast on very, very big databases, just the kind of thing that services like
NASDAQ need and can afford.
</p>  

<p>
The magic came from blending disks with Intel Xeon multi-core processors
and an Oracle secret sauce that ran a lite version of Oracle to produce
parallel query processing. That also meant the new hardware needed to talk
to an Oracle-like DB as the controller, and there were a lot of Oracle
licenses included for the disk-and-CPU array. I believe some of the newer
storage arrays, coupled with FOSS databases, can produce decent performance
at similar or lower costs per transaction. (Check out Sun's ZFS-based storage
devices, running with Postgres or MySQL.)
</p>  

<p>
Another major announcement was the new Oracle Beehive collaboration suite.
The goal is to help organizations secure communications and add
collaboration into business processes. Oracle Beehive is an open-standards
based enterprise collaboration platform, with integrated workspaces,
calendar, instant messaging, and e-mail.
</p>

<p>
This is a link to the PDF for the session introducing Beehive:<br>
<a href="http://gpjco.edgeboss.net/download/gpjco/oracle/course_html/2008_09_22/S298423.pdf">http://gpjco.edgeboss.net/download/gpjco/oracle/course_html/2008_09_22/S298423.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
One great change is that the bigger Oracle Develop sub-conference was at
the Marriot Hotel, just two blocks from the Moscone Convention Center. That
allowed attendees to pick either regular conference sessions or the more
technical developer curriculum with only a five minute transit time. In 2007,
Oracle Develop was at the Hilton with a fifteen to twenty minute wait and bus ride (and at
least a twelve minute walk) away. That had me swearing under my breath.
</p>   

<p>
This year the exec conference and the partner events were at the more
distant Hilton. The food may have been a little better at the Hilton, but
the session rooms are easier to find at the Marriott, and it's only a one
long block from SF mass transit.  Congrats to the conference organizers for
getting these details right in 2008 and hopefully future OOW conferences as
well.
</p>


<h3>The Minnow: eComm</h3>

<p>
One very small but very focused event is the new eComm (emerging
Communications) conference that was first held last year in Silicon Valley,
California. eComm actually started as a community effort to replace
O'Reilly's ETel Conference when that 2008 event was cancelled.
</p>

<p>
eComm organizers view the venue as "a forum to understand the radical
restructuring in how humanity connects, communicates and collaborates". The
first conference, in 2008, broke a lot of new ground and attracted 300 people
and 80 speakers from 15 countries. The tagline for the event was "The
Trillion Dollar Industry rethink" and it did make significant inroads on
that goal.  The '09 event in March hopes to build on that and create
a forum on a post-telecom era built on open standards and open APIs.
</p> 

<p>
Major topics of eComm '09 include the expected cloud computing and social
computing tracks, but will also include tracks on "Open Handsets &amp; the Open
Ecosystem", "The Fight for Open Spectrum", "New Forms of Contactability" and
more.
</p>  

<p>
Use of the Computer History Museum as a conference venue in 2008 was a good
choice, due to its closeness to Highway 101 and its facilities. But it was
the wealth of exciting and innovative speakers that made this a great
conference with a lot of buzz in the hallways and at the breaks.
</p> 

<p>
Here is the archive of eComm 08 videos:<br>

<p>
The eComm 2009 site is here:<br>
<a href="http://ecommconf.com/2009/">http://ecommconf.com/2009/</a>
</p>

<p>
eComm 2009 is coming up next month, March 3-6, at the San Francisco Airport Marriott.
</p>

<p>
Founder and main organizer Lee Dryburgh told LG that "the 2008 event was
the first conference to cover both iPhone and Android. These signify that
the trillion dollar telecommunications industry has already started down
the path that homebrew computing took three decades ago. ...eComm tracks,
highlights, and promotes both the people and the technologies driving the
democratization of communications."
</p>

<p>
Lee hopes that eComm and other community-driven events will break the
telephony model of telecommunications and drive new forms of innovation.
"Telecoms [used to be] linked to telephony. But telephony is being displaced
by other modes of communication, and what telephony was will be reinvented.
You're going to see a lot of companies at eComm 2009 who are building
exciting applications with voice. We are just coming out of the "Henry Ford"
stage of telephony, where you can have any colour as long as it's black."
</p>


<p>
I'd like to highlight Brian Capouch's practical presentation on building a
people's wireless and telephony network in rural areas with old Wi-Fi
routers and 12 volt batteries. Unfortunately, a lot of what he said is not
captured in the slides available here:<br>

</p>

<p>
You also need to see a video of the presentation here:<br>

<p>
Dryburgh has an interesting interview with Sasha Meinrath on Telcom 2.0

He also talks with Andreas Constantinou on Mobile OS's and NaaS (Network as
a Service) here :
