Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I have become confused about the domain name handling in debian. I have
a suse box too. It is very easy to set the domain name in suse box "
domainname &lt;example.com&gt; ". Similarly to set FQDN in suse " hostname
&lt;hostname&gt;.&lt;example.com&gt;"
</p>

<p>
How to achieve this in debian ? No domainname command is there in debian
(lenny). There are /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname but where can I save
<strong>domain</strong> name ? and where to save FQDN ? I am really confused here.
Please enlighten me. Thanks.  
</p>

<p>
PS: Kindly CC me
</p>

&gt; Dear list,
&gt; I have become confused about the domain name handling in debian. I
&gt; have a suse box too. It is very easy to set the domain name in suse
&gt; box " domainname &lt;example.com&gt; ". Similarly to set FQDN in suse "
&gt; hostname &lt;hostname&gt;.&lt;example.com&gt;"
</pre>

<p>
The hostname in Debian is set by a combination of files. My workstation
is called "agamemnon" which is also the content of /etc/hostname. It
belongs to the luchs.at network so therefore my /etc/resolv.conf looks
like this:
</p>

<pre>
domain luchs.at
search luchs.at
nameserver a.b.c.d
nameserver a.b.c.e
</pre>

<p>
According to the hostname command the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
gets determined like this:
</p>

<pre>
"The address families hostname tries when looking up the FQDN, aliases
and network addresses of the host are determined by the configuration
of your resolver. For instance, on GNU Libc systems, the resolver
can be instructed to try IPv6 lookups first by using the inet6 option in
/etc/resolv.conf."
</pre>

<p>
Whenever I configure systems I usually verify that /etc/hosts,
/etc/hostname and /etc/resolv.conf is set correctly.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
Ren&eacute;.
</p>

<p>
To add to Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer answer, "domainname" often is used to set or
query your NIS domain name - this is not your dns domain name.
</p>

<p>
As Ren&eacute; says what determines your dns domain name is really what is
configured in your name resolution setup - DNS is you have a DNS server,
or more usually what is is your /etc/hosts file. The domain is anything
after the host name. On my home network I have a DNS server, and a site
/etc/hosts file, which is (update then) copied to any new machine I
setup.
</p>

<p>
Make sure the first name is the fully qualified domain name of your
host, followed by any aliases or short names e.g.
</p>

<p>
10.0.1.1   host.domain.local host
</p>

You can certainly use the command
<pre>
  hostname host.dom.a.in
</pre>
to set the FQDN  on most GNU/Linux systems.
</p>

<p>
However, this is better done by editing /etc/hostname so that the
change is ensured each time at boot. In addition, you should make an
appropriate entry in /etc/hosts so that your host can resolve its own
name!
</p>

<p>
You will find the current values for this according to your kernel in
/proc/sys/kernel/{hostname,domainname}.
</p>

<p>
As others have pointed out there are other contexts where the domain
name is used such as NIS, DNS resolution, Mail domain etc. Each of
these has its own configuration. If that configuration is empty it is
set to the kernel's default.
</p>

<p>
Thanks Kapil, Jim and  Ren&eacute;,
</p>

<p>
After reading your clarifications; I am in a better position now. I'll
configure it accordingly using /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts
</p>

<p>
many many thanks.
