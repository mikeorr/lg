<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>After returning in early
April from a month long trek through New Zealand, I found myself with a
slew of work to catch up on.&nbsp; Aside from the mountain of email, I
had three articles and some cover art for the Linux Journal, a new issue
of TheGimp.com, and some things I've been sworn to secrecy on.&nbsp; I
also bought a new camera, so I could stop rumaging around for affordable
stock photography and just go take the pictures myself.&nbsp; I find photography
as much an artistic outlet as my Gimp galleries, and plan to merge the
two immediately.&nbsp; Just as soon as I finish the classes that explain
what all the knobs do on that thing.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Of course, I also had lots
of laundry to do when I got back.&nbsp; But thats an article for my HouseCleaning

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This years <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s99">SIGGRAPH</a>
in Los Angeles runs from August 8-13. The exhibit days are Tuesday throughThursday.
August 10-12.&nbsp; Calvin Williamson is organizing a Gimp SIG for the
conference.&nbsp; Here is his announcment:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I've made some enquiries
and we can have a Gimp SIG (special interest group) meeting without paying
any money. (The conference costs though). I have a form we have to submit
to reserve a spot.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It would be nice if we made
this for any and all gimp users/developers and would basically be a reserved
room that we can meet in for a couple of hours.&nbsp; If we get our form
in soon, it will probably be listed in various programs/schedules.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Anyway we're free to organize
our SIG anyway we want.&nbsp; I'm sure we can do that fine.&nbsp; But what
I wanted to find out was a guess at how many people we might get, and what
times would be best. I need this for the forms to send in to set this up.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Heres some considerations:</font></font>
<blockquote>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The exhibits/papers/courses
usually run to about 5 or 6 each day.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Exhibit is Tuesday -Thursday.&nbsp;
Papers are Wednesday - Friday.&nbsp; Courses are Sunday -Tuesday.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In my humble opinion, a good
time might be something like 5:30-7:30 PM on Tuesday or Wednesday, which
reduces the chance that it will actually overlap with anything else you
might want to do.</font></font></li>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>As for number, Yosh "guessed"
that we wouldnt get more than 40 people.&nbsp; If all this sounds good,
I'll fill out the forms accordingly and send them in a week or so.&nbsp;
If not let me know what you think.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Yosh has set up an account
(gimpsiggraph@gimp.org) we can use for logistics /suggestions/comments
about the upcoming meeting. If you have an organizational issue or have
a request of some sort, please email that account. It will help us keep
things under control as time nears.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In case your interested in
conference costs:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.siggraph.org/s99/registration/catNfees.html">http://www.siggraph.org/s99/registration/catNfees.html.&nbsp;</a>
($25 for exhibit only, but other stuff is pretty expensive.)&nbsp; Last
year the Linux3D group had a good meeting I think. (I missed it cause I
didnt know about it though...)</font></font>

Did You Know?</h2>

<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>...<a href="http://www.dv.com">Digital
Video</a> magazine's March 1999 print issue has a terrific article on color
spaces, written by Ben Waggoner.&nbsp; If you've ever wondered about what
the different color spaces are and why you might use them (and which programs
and industries use which color spaces), check out this article.&nbsp; A
PDF version of this article is available online at <a href="http://www.dv.com/magazine/1999/0399/">http://www.dv.com/magazine/1999/0399/</a>.

<h2>
Q and A</h2>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Q:&nbsp; Perhaps there's
a question you can answer.&nbsp; I scanned most of my pictures at 75dpi
using a Windows program.&nbsp; But I did a few at 150dpi.&nbsp; For some
reason, when I retouched the latter, they looked fine in the GIMP, but
when I later used display or another viewer, they were twice as big (both
directions) as I expected, and they took up much more disk space than they
should.&nbsp; It's like the GIMP had somehow gotten into a mode where it
was showing me things at half the real size they were, without telling
me.</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A:&nbsp; Gimp will rescale
the visual display of the image to fit your screen but the actual image
size remains the same.&nbsp; A 150DPI scanned image would look twice as
large on a computer as the 75dpi image.&nbsp; Each "d" is a pixel, essentially.&nbsp;
Gimp scaled it down so you could work on it.&nbsp; But the other programs
don't know about "inches" (the "i" in DPI), just about total number of
pixels in the image.&nbsp; So those other programs displayed all the pixels
it read, one image pixel per one screen pixel.</font></font>

<h2>
The Macromedia Flash Plugins for Linux</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Animations on the Web, for me
at least, have been limited to what you can squeeze out of a really good
multi-image GIF file.&nbsp; For the most part, those haven't been very
exciting or creative, and they really were limited to small spots within
the browser window.&nbsp; I haven't seen too many MPEG&nbsp;movies online
but even those would be a little limited in a browser.&nbsp; As for audio,
well, I mostly just listen to the various tech news sites. and those only
a couple times a day at most.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>So I was rather interested
to see two versions of a Macromedia Flash plugin for Netscape recently
announced.&nbsp; One comes directly from Macromedia in binary format only,
the other is an Open Source version which includes source code.&nbsp; Since
I'd never seen a Flash site in action (I run Linux - and only Linux - at
home and work normally revolves around the various commercial Unix systems),
I decided I'd grab these and take a look at what I'd been missing.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Wow.&nbsp; I'm stunned.&nbsp;
Apparently there was a whole other world out there.&nbsp; Sites with full-window
animation accompanied by driving electronica-style soundtracks.&nbsp; My
Graphics Muse site seems rather dull all of a sudden (maybe it already
did to some of you, but I don't get out much).&nbsp; Maybe the "Wow factor"&nbsp;(as
one site put it) will wear off eventually, but I'm rather excited about
this format.&nbsp; Although I can't author the Flash files on Linux yet
(you still need the Macromedia Flash 3 authoring software, which only runs
on non-Linux systems), at least now I can visit Flash sites and not stare
at those blank boxes with notes about where to download a player for Windows.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The two plugins I looked
at are:</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&P2_Platform=Linux&P3_Browser_Version=Netscape4">Macromedia
Flash plugin</a>, available from <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/">Macromedia's</a>
Web site</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Open Flash plugin by Olivier
Debon, available from <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/5084/flash.html">http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Labyrinth/5084/flash.html</a></font></font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I found links to both on the
linuxartist.org site, which is how I got the idea for this article in the
first place.&nbsp; I jumped to their respective Web sites, downloaded binaries
for both (plus the source for the Open Flash version) and installed them.&nbsp;
Installation of both plugins is easy enough - just copy the plugins (files
with .so suffices) to your $HOME/.netscape/plugins directory.&nbsp; If
you don't have a plugins directory under $HOME/.netscape, just create it:</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>% cd $HOME/.netscape</font></tt>
<br><tt><font size=-1>% mkdir </font></tt>plugins</blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Don't put both into the plugins
directory at the same time.&nbsp; Its not clear which one will get run
if you do this, although I suspect the first matching plugin wins.&nbsp;
After you copy the plugin into its directory, and if you already have Netscape
running, you can type the following in the Location field:</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><tt>javascript:navigator.plugins.refresh</tt></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>That will get Netscape to
update its plugins list.&nbsp; You can verify this</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>worked by typing</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><tt>about:plugins</tt></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>in the same Location field.&nbsp;
If for some reason this doesn't work, exit and restart Netscape and you
should see the plugins listed when you use the "about" command.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Note:&nbsp; There is a Linux-based
Flash Generator available from <a href="http://www.swift-tools.com/">http://www.swift-tools.com/</a>.&nbsp;
This doesn't create the Flash file, it only allows you to manage it <i>after</i>
its created, such as to modify it to generate on-the-fly weather maps.&nbsp;
You still need the Macromedia Flash 3 authoring tool to create the original
Flash 3 file.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Both of these are Flash 3.0
plugins, although they don't both support the complete 3.0 specification
yet.&nbsp; The test system was a Cyrix 200, 64Mb memory, running Netscape
4.51 with an Xi Graphics AcceleratedX X server on a stock Red Hat 5.2 (Linux
2.0.36) system.&nbsp; Sound on my system is run through the commercial
version of the Open Sound System driver from <a href="http://www.4front-tech.com">4Front
Technologies.</a>&nbsp; I restarted Netscape between invokations of each
plugin, to make sure there weren't memory leak problems in one that might
cause the other to fail.&nbsp; In testing these, I picked out a set of
Flash 3.0 web sites that were linked from either the Open Flash site or
the Macromedia gallery site, or both.</font></font>

<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Vector Drawing on Linux - XFig, TGIF and friends</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Over the past year we've heard
a lot about the killer app for Linux - Gimp, the Photoshop-like tool for
graphic arts work.&nbsp; By now many of you may even be sick of hearing
about it.&nbsp; Especially if what you really need isn't a raster-based
effects package, but a vector-based drawing tool.&nbsp; For the past several
years you really only had two choices:&nbsp; XFig and TGIF.&nbsp; Recently,
a number of new projects have sprung up that aim to provide more modern
interfaces and features for vector-based tools.&nbsp; Despite the abundance
of enthusiasm from the developers of those projects, none is quite ready
for the average Joe Newbie, particularly because few of them are as easy
to build and install as the two grandfathers in this category of applications.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The first thing I did was
try to find what vector tools are currently available.&nbsp; A new site,
<a href="http://www.linuxartist.org">linuxartist.org</a>,
has several listed.&nbsp; A couple aren't tools for creating vector graphics.&nbsp;
The Flash plug-ins are only for viewing images, so I didn't look at them
for this article (but see this months <a href="#webwonderings">Web Wonderings)</a>.&nbsp;
The other tools I did look at were</font></font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>xfig</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>tgif</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>sketch</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>killustrator</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>GILT</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>ipad/xebot</font></font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There are also vector based
drawing tools available in the <a href="http://www.applix.com">ApplixWare</a>
and <a href="http://www.stardivision.com">StarOffice</a> commercial packages.&nbsp;
The ApplixWare version is a little limited in features, but very stable
and easy to use.&nbsp; Installation of ApplixWare was quite simple as well.&nbsp;
I haven't used StarOffice's StarDraw package so can't speak of its ease
of installation, stability, or feature set, although the specifications
for it on the StarDivision web site seem fairly impressive.&nbsp; Core's
CorelDraw package is also due out sometime this year, I believe.&nbsp;
I don't know anything about it, however.&nbsp; I'll save a head-to-head
review of these commercial packages for a later date.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>By far the easiest vector
tool to build and install was <b><font color="#993300">tgif</font></b>,
which required only an "xmkmf; make" for Linux systems.&nbsp; No editing
of any configuration files was necessary.&nbsp; <b><font color="#993300">XFig</font></b>
was probably the next easiest, although it had quite a few configurable
items to set in the Makefile if you wanted to get things optimized and
looking their best.&nbsp; Of the rest, I was only able to get XEBOT running
under a limited environment.&nbsp; The others required extra packages that
were not already available on my Red Hat system or that were not complete
enough on my system in order to build or install the drawing tool.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">Sketch</font></b>
is based entirely on the Python intepreted language.&nbsp; Along with the
interpreter and libraries, you also need an additional image library called
PIL - the Python Imaging Library.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this doesn't build
with my RPM-based Python that was installed when I installed Red Hat 5.2.&nbsp;
This library expects some other parts which I could only get if I built
Python itself and installed it.&nbsp; I tried to build Python without installing
it to see if I could tell PIL where that was, but it became too much work&nbsp;
in the long run.&nbsp; Sketch, therefore, is more of a developers toy than
an artists (or average users) tool.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">KIllustrator</font></b>
turned out to be much like Sketch, at least for me and from an installation
point of view.&nbsp; Its tied to KDE, which means I need to install KDE
just to get it to work (not to mention the Qt libraries).&nbsp; I glanced
through the KDE web site and decided there were far too many packages to
try to install just to get KIllustrator running.&nbsp; Red Hat 6.0 is supposed
to include KDE so maybe I'll try it then, when I have less work to do in
order to get it running.&nbsp; Personally, I think applications should
be KDE and GNOME aware, but they shouldn't be tied to those environments.&nbsp;
Not if you want to reach the largest possible audience.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">GILT</font></b>
simply didn't compile.&nbsp; It does include a "configure" script-based
build process, but apparently its not quite ready for the average Joe's
use.&nbsp; I sent email to the author but really didn't give him much time
to respond (Muse deadlines, once again, running up against work that pays).&nbsp;
In fairness, GILT is listed as being in very early development so its not
unexpected that this particular tool isn't ready for the average user.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">IPAD/XEBOT
</font></b><font color="#000000">required
an 8-bit display to function.&nbsp; I tried XEBOT first, which is supposed
to contain all of the features of IPAD, plus a few more.&nbsp; Even when
I switched to 8-bit mode (which was a bit of a pain because my FVWM environment
doesn't look correct in that mode) I wasn't able to do anything useful.&nbsp;
The UI is very user unfriendly.&nbsp; It uses an interface that is obviously
platform inspecific and drops it inside of a generic X window.&nbsp; It
just wasn't what I was looking for, especially since I'm not concerned
with usability on non-Unix platforms.&nbsp; IPAD looked and worked about
the same as XEBOT.</font></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When it came right down to
it, I was back to the old favorites, XFig and TGIF.&nbsp; Since I couldn't
really get the others to work very well, I thought I'd do a little side
by side comparison of these two.&nbsp; A little head to head competition,
if you will.&nbsp; If you don't like these two, and are up to the challenge
of getting one of the others to work, you at least have a choice these
days.</font></font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>TGIF vs XFig</font></font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The easiest to learn to use
was probably TGIF, but both TGIF and XFIG have so many features its easy
to get lost in them.&nbsp; I'd have to say TGIF's interface is more intuitive,
using familiar menu configurations (File is on the left of the menu bar,
for example).&nbsp; TGIF is a little easier to use initially.&nbsp; Its
seems more intuitive to be able to draw a shape, then select it to edit
its points.&nbsp; XFig allows this, but the method to get to editing the
points seems a little harder to figure out.&nbsp; For example, with TGIF
you select an object to edit by clicking on it while in selection mode.&nbsp;
In XFig you select "Move Points" and all the points for all visible objects
are shown.&nbsp; You then click on one to move it.&nbsp; The hard part
was finding the hotspot for the points in XFig.&nbsp; You really have to
get right on the little boxes (which represent the points) to grab them.&nbsp;
In TGIF, however, the hot spots are larger and you only mess with the objects
you specifically selected.</font></font>

<td COLSPAN="3" NOSAVE><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Sure,
the problem here may be my unfamiliarity with using XFig.&nbsp; But I'm
also a GUI designer by trade so I understand about usability issues.&nbsp;
XFig's buttons across the top are either discreet features or menus, with
the menus on the right side of that set of buttons.&nbsp; This is counter
to standard UI design styles, where menus are on the left, especially the
File menu.&nbsp; Additionally, TGIF uses standard layouts for most of its
dialogs.&nbsp; XFig does not.&nbsp; For example, look for the Cancel button
on the File Selection dialog in XFig versus where its located on any other
dialog.&nbsp; Seldom the same twice.&nbsp; TGIF's dialogs are more standardized,
which makes them easier to learn.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One feature which both tools
have is a visual display of what the mouse buttons do for any selected
feature.&nbsp; In TGIF this is along the bottom of the window.&nbsp; In
XFig it is in the upper right corner.&nbsp; I like XFig's implementation
of this better because its simpler - three buttons side by side, with text
to the sides or above the buttons.&nbsp; TGIF's is cute - the icons for
the mouse are more realistic - but visually it takes a moment to get your
bearings on which text goes with which button.&nbsp; Its not difficult,
mind you, I just prefer XFigs implementation.</font></font></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One feature which both tools
have is a visual display of what the mouse buttons do for any selected
feature.&nbsp; In TGIF this is along the bottom of the window.&nbsp; In
XFig it is in the upper right corner.&nbsp; I like XFig's implementation
of this better because its simpler - three buttons side by side, with text

the mouse are more realistic - but visually it takes a moment to get your
bearings on which text goes with which button.&nbsp; Its not difficult,
mind you, I just prefer XFigs implementation.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Rulers are handled differently
in the two programs too.&nbsp; In TGIF you have the traditional slider
bars to move the page around.&nbsp; The bottom slider is rather small,
it doesn't expand the width of the visible page.&nbsp; In XFig you click
and drag within the rulers themselves to move around the page.&nbsp; This
one is a toss up.&nbsp; TGIF's method is familiar, but XFig makes the rulers
serve a dual purpose and thus saves a little screen space.&nbsp; I like
both methods equally well.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>TGIF imports XBM, XPM, GIF,
and EPS files and has an interface for adding other import filters.&nbsp;
XFig imports the same, plus JPEG and PCX files.&nbsp; The difference is
that TGIF calls this "Import", while you have to know to click on the camera
icon to import a "Picture" in XFig.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>XFig easily wins on the file
export side.&nbsp; If you're into Latex then you're in luck because XFig
supports a wide range of Latex export options.&nbsp; Additionally, it supports
all the well supported Web image formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, XBM, etc.&nbsp;
TGIF supports GIF and a few others, but its export capabilities aren't
quite as extensive as XFig's.&nbsp; TGIF also exports via its print function,
which isn't the obvious place to put it.&nbsp; Both tools support export
to Postscript.&nbsp; Strangely enough, I wasn't able to get XFig to export
to any file format.&nbsp; I also wasn't able to print because XFig said
it couldn't open a temporary file.&nbsp; I think my installation wasn't
quite correct and may have been the cause of these problems.&nbsp; Still,
the print features of both appear fairly decent, with both making use of
the basic print facilities on your Linux box.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>All this talks about fairly
mundane issues.&nbsp; What about real feature comparison?&nbsp; Well, both
support a wide range of drawing primitives:&nbsp; circles and ovals, boxes,
freehand drawings, polygons, polylines, and arcs.&nbsp; TGIF has a few
other canned shapes that may or may not be useful.&nbsp; XFig provides
a few different methods for doing splines (closed or open curves).&nbsp;
Both provide text input, with XFig providing far more fonts.&nbsp; However,
neither makes use of your complete set of installed fonts - they each have
their own font support.&nbsp; I have to say, although XFig offers far more
font options, the dialog which provides it is rather, well, unusual looking.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Summary:</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>When I first started looking
at XFig I thought it was pretty nifty.&nbsp; This was even after having
used TGIF in the past.&nbsp; But when I compared the two side by side I
found I much preferred TGIF.&nbsp; Its just simpler to use.&nbsp; Looking
at the rating chart you might think I'd recommend XFig over TGIF.&nbsp;
Not necessarily.&nbsp; In my case I'm concerned with ease of use and the
time it takes to get to doing productive work.&nbsp; Here, TGIF is a better
choice.&nbsp; XFig wins points for extensive documentation (and should
be applauded loudly for this considering how many Open Source products
come with so little, and/or so poor, documentation) and a large collection
of examples that come directly with the source distribution.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>There may be a few more features
in XFig that TGIF doesn't have that some users will need.&nbsp; If thats
the case then definitely check out XFig.&nbsp; In fact, I recommend you
take a look at both of them anyway.&nbsp; You may find the problems I see
in the XFig UI just don't bother you as much.&nbsp; Both tools are quite
extensive in basic drawing features and I'm sure one of them will provide
at least some measure of satisfaction for your vector-based needs.</font></font>
