<H2>Yet Another Window Manager</H2>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>Marco Macek, a Slovenian computer-science student, has been developing a
quite powerful and configurable editor called FTE for the past couple of
years.  FTE is a multi-platform folding editor, available for Linux, OS/2, DOS, and
Windows; I wrote a short review of an earlier beta in issue 7 of LG.  Lately
Marco has turned his hand to developing a new window-manager.  Unlike some
Linux projects, which are released to the FTP sites in the early stages of
development, the Ice window-manager seems to have been under development as a
non-public project throughout the early beta versions.  It just showed up one
day in the Sunsite incoming directory in a remarkably complete and usable
form.

<h3><center>Differences and Features</center></h3>

<p>Lately window-managers seem to be proliferating, with offshoots and variants
of fvwm predominating.  Icewm is in large part inspired by the OS/2 Workplace
Shell interface.  Though OS/2 has been never gained the market acceptance its
adherents have hoped for, the Workplace Shell is a remarkably advanced
object-oriented GUI, and Macek has attempted to adapt some of its
"look-and-feel" to the Linux environment.  Another influence is the common
Windows 95 interface, which does have some useful features worth emulating.

<p>Win95's bottom-of-the-screen icon bar , with its cascading menus and dynamic
window indicators, has been nicely reproduced in Icewm.  The equivalent of
the "Start" menu (which functions much like Win95's) has a "Linux" label with
a penguin icon.<br>

<p>The general appearance of the windows (borders, titlebars, et al) is very
reminiscent of OS/2.  Various types of "X" kill buttons are available, but the 
general appearance of the window-borders seems to be hard-coded;  that is, not
configurable.  Here's a screenshot of a typical window:<br>

<p>I liked the cascading mouse button menus, with a different menu shown for
each mouse button.  The Enlightenment window-manager has a similar feature.
These menus are hierarchical and behave like their OS/2 equivalents.<br>

<hr>
<p>This window-manager really doesn't have such compellingly new features that 
many long-time Fvwm2 or AfterStep users would want to adopt it, but for new Linux
users more familiar with Win95 or OS/2, the similarities might serve to ease
the transition.  It compiled easily on my 2.0.30 system, and it seemed to be
stable and dependable.

<p>The source archive is available from
<a href="http://ixtas.fri.uni-lj.si/~markom/icewm/">the icewm home-page</a>, as well 
as the sunsite FTP site.  Icewm's home page also has Redhat RPM's of the source.
