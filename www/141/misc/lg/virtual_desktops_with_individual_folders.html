&gt; I have searched the net (google, newsgroups ...) to find an answer to
&gt; this question .- but without success.
&gt; 
&gt; In KDE (for example) you can get individual desktops backgrounds for
&gt; each virtual desktop.
&gt; Well - i am used to a utility for M$-Windows called Xdesk that also
&gt; can set the the desktops to have individual icons / folders.
&gt; 
&gt; I know that in the windows world they change a regkey that tells where
&gt; the desktop belongs for each switch so such a 'true virtual desktop'
&gt; 
&gt; I have also in M$-Windows created bathc-files to use with less
&gt; intelligence window-managers, theese batch-files separately update the
&gt; regkey to get my own way to create 'true virtual desktops'
&gt; 
&gt; Is there any program that i can get to have different desktops-folders
&gt; or is there any way  to trick either  kde / gnomw / idesk to have
&gt; different desktops?
</pre>

<p>
I have very little experience with it myself, but based on what I do
know, FVWM can probably accomodate you. You would, however, need to
learn to write config files for it. I have no doubt that it has some
kind of a "DetectDesktopSwitch" function, as well as either the
capability of hiding the icons or allowing you to script such a
function.

Here's an example of a very complicated (but still readable) FVWM config

Readable, yes.  Portable?  Alas not.  Plus the author does some questionable
things with function.  But this is not a witch hunt.  See also:

OK, OK.  I'll bite.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  FVWM is a window manager.  It has no concept of
anything other than managing windows.  Things that fall on the periphery,
such as icons to launch programs, file managers, etc., fall outside of its
remit.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental problem is that programs such as idesk or rox-filer, etc.,
need some level of munging to work with the window manager.  Because the
icons supplied by such programs aren't individual (i.e., they're not part of
the icon you can assign individual programs to have) you can't manage any
one icon, only all of them en masse.
</p>

<p>
In the case of rox-filer though you can toggle the pinboard by simply doing:
</p>

<pre>
rox -p=
rox -p some_name
</pre>
There's any number of ways you can do that from within FVWM.  You might have
a shortcut for it via a key-binding:
</p>

<pre>
Key I A CM ToggleRoxIcons
</pre>
Which just tells FVWM that when the combination ALT-CTRL-I is pressed that
it is to run 'ToggleRoxIcons'.  What this is can only be one of three things
as FVWM is concerned (and in this order):
</p>

<pre>
Internal command
Function
Module
</pre>
It's not an internal command, nor is it a module.  It would be a function
which looked like this:
</p>

<pre>
DestroyFunc ToggleRoxIcons
AddToFunc   ToggleRoxIcons
+ I PipeRead `[ -n "$(pidof rox)" ] &amp;&amp; echo "Exec exec rox -p=" \
|| echo "Exec exec rox -p someProfile"`
</pre>
What's happening here is that PipeRead spawns a shell, and information is
sent back to FVWM in a synchronous manner.   Thus what we're doing here is
checking to see if rox is running, and if it is, to clear the pinboard, else
if not, start it up and use the specified pinboard profile, which would then
load up the various sets of icons.
</p>

<p>
You could do something similar with idesk, but that program is just
confusing, IMO.
</p>

<p>
There is a more... FVWM-centric approach you could use, involving
FvwmButtons, the details of which are here:

I was hoping you'd step up, since you're as close as we can get to an
in-house FVWM expert. For all I know, other WMs can do the same thing as
well, but since you've spent so much time writing up the features of
FVWM, that's what comes up in my mind when somebody mentions an
easily-programmable WM. So it's all your fault no matter how you look at
it. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Hmm, I had lost track of the fact that icons weren't part of the WM. Oh
well.
</p>

<p>
(I wonder if the OP would be satisfied with launching all the apps that
he wants open and having them minimized on a given desktop? That sounds
like all-WM territory.)

Actually, having played with "idesk" quite a bit, I can suggest an
approach in that direction:
</p>

<p>
1) Make up multiple versions of the "~/.idesk" subdirectory - say,
"~/.idesk1", "~/.idesk2", etc.
</p>

<p>
2) As you switch desktops, have the WM fire off a script that does an
"ln -sf ~/.idesk$DESKTOP_NUM ~/.idesk".
</p>

<p>
3) restart "idesk".
</p>

<p>
This would be a little wasteful of resources as well as a bit slow -
although "idesk" restarts rather quickly - but it would do what's
requested.

Heh.  I spend more time with it than I ought to.

<p>
Yes, it is.  It's a two-stage process with FVWM.  First of all you'd have to
set some style lines for those applications:
</p>

<pre>
Style programA StartsOnPage 0 1, StartIconic, SkipMapping
Style programB StartsOnDesk 1, StartIconic, SkipMapping
</pre>
Note that I've used StartsOnPage for programA, and StartsOnDesk for
programB.  SkipMapping tells the window manager not to switch to the page
the program appears on when it is mapped (displayed, if you will) to the
screen.  This is useful if you want to continue doing stuff without being
disturbed.
</p>

<p>
There is a difference between a desk and a page.  A Desk contains N number of
pages (at least one -- there's no choice in that).  A Page is simply one
"window" within that desk.  The numbers of those desks are dependant on the
layout of the DesktopSize.  So for instance, I have this in my
~/.fvwm/config file:
</p>

<pre>
DesktopSize 3x3
</pre>
That means that for each desk I define, I have nine pages, and they'd look
like this:
</p>

<pre>
+------+------+------+
|      |      |      |
| 0 0  | 1 0  | 2 0  |
|  B   |      |      |
+------+------+------+
|      |      |      |
| 0 1  | 1 1  | 2 1  |
|  A   |      |      |
+------+------+------+
|      |      |      |
| 0 2  | 1 2  | 2 2  |
|      |      |      |
+------+------+------+
</pre>
I've put the numbers in for reference.  In the case of programA above
starting in page 0 1, it would place it in square 'A'.
</p>

<p>
programB is a bit different though in that it's being told to start in a
specific desk.  Desk 1, in fact.  Naming desks is a way of defining them,
starting at 0 (which FVWM will take as being the default desk anyway),
hence:
</p>

<pre>
DesktopName 0 Main
DesktopName 1 Games
DesktopName 2 Work
</pre>
Because all we've said is for programB to startup on desk 2, it will default
to placing that window on page 0 0.  What gets even more interesting though
is that the StartsOnPage command can accept three arguments as well as one.
So you could use this to specify not only the desk programB is to start up
onm but the page also (the first number is the desk):
</p>

<pre>
Style programB StartsOnPage 1 2 2
</pre>
I said this was a two-stage process.  You now have to tell FVWM to launch
your programs.  You do this from the StartFunction:
</p>

<pre>
DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc   StartFunction
+ I Exec exec programA
+ I Exec exec programB
</pre>
As an example.  StartFunction is special in FVWM in that it is always read
across startups (what we call 'Init), and restarts of FVWM.  This would mean
that across restarts of FVWM both programA and programB would get started
again.  Limiting this to just init is done like this:
</p>

<pre>
DestroyFunc StartFunction
AddToFunc   StartFunction
+ I Test (Init) Exec exec programA
+ I Test (Init) Exec exec programB
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; Actually, having played with "idesk" quite a bit, I can suggest an
&gt; approach in that direction:
&gt; 
&gt; 1) Make up multiple versions of the "~/.idesk" subdirectory - say,
&gt; "~/.idesk1", "~/.idesk2", etc.
&gt; 
&gt; 2) As you switch desktops, have the WM fire off a script that does an
&gt; "ln -sf ~/.idesk$DESKTOP_NUM ~/.idesk".
</pre>

<p>
This is why I rambled on about desks and pages earlier -- the act of switch
from page to page, or desk to desk, are two separate operations.  Confining
this to either having just one desk with nine pages (as per my example) is
easier, eince you can then do this:
</p>


<pre>
DestroyModuleConfig FE-idesk
*FE-idesk: Cmd Function
*FE-idesk: new_page RestartIdesk
</p>

<p>
AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmEvent FE-idesk
</pre>
Which just sets up an FvwmEvent alias and tells it that each time we switch
a page, we're going to be calling some function called RestartIdesk.  Here's
what that would look like:
</p>

<pre>
DestroyFunc RestartIdesk
AddToFunc   RestartIdesk
+ I PipeRead `case "$[page.nx] $[page.ny]" in \
"0 0") ln -sf "~/.idesk$[page.nx]$[page.ny]" ~/.idesk &amp;&amp; \
doWhateverYouDoToRestartIDesk ;; \
"0 1") ln -sf "~/.idesk$[page.nx]$[page.ny]" ~/.idesk &amp;&amp; \
doWhateverYouDoToRestartIDesk ;; \
esac`
</pre>
But then you don't need to check which page you're on.  So we can simplify
this more:
</p>

<pre>
DestroyFunc RestartIdesk                                                        
AddToFunc   RestartIdesk
+ I PipeRead `[ -d "$HOME/.idesk$[page.nx]$[page.ny]" ] || echo "Break"`
+ I PipeRead `ln -sf "$HOME/.idesk$[page.nx]$[page.ny]" $HOME/.idesk &amp;&amp; \
doWhateverYouDoToRestartIDesk`
</pre>
We instead break (end running this function) if the directory we're trying
to link to for the page we're on doesn't exist.  I have no idea what you
need to do to restart idesk, so I will leave "doWhateverYouDoToRestartIDesk"
to someone who knows.
