<p>
...a most sincere "thank you"!
</p>

<p>
This month, a number of new volunteers came aboard - and, in a word,
<em>revitalized</em> LG. Some came in and cleaned up the dusty phrasing,
straightened up the crooked grammar, and replaced the broken spelling;
others brought their technical expertise and poked into the complicated
corners of articles. Yet others looked at LG with fresh eyes and pointed
out a few broken phone cords and the bumps under the carpet (which
turned out to be broken stuff hastily swept under in the past.) All who
contributed have left their mark.
</p>

<p>
As Editor-in-Chief, I took great pleasure from seeing all this activity;
in coordinating all of this [1], I got to meet a number of smart,
energetic, <em>capable</em> individuals - people whom, as a group, I'm proud to
know, and ones whom I hope I may come to call my friends.
</p>

<p>
Because of all of you, - even during this first month while everybody
"settled in" and got familiar with the tasks needed to keep LG moving -
my end of the production process has shifted focus, in large and
positive ways. Just in case anyone missed it, this month we published
the largest Mailbag (mailbag, talkbacks, and 2-cent tips) ever, by a
large factor (over 620k, as contrasted against, say, 45k in LG#113.) In
large part, this is due to our fearless Mailbag Editor, who also happens
to be my fearless wife <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> - but in part, it is due to the fact that I
had the time and the energy to 1) rethink the Mailbag process and
presentation, and 2) write a script which automated/relieved a great
percentage of the drudgery that Mailbag used to be.
</p>

<p>
My best hope for the future is to revisit and revise every part of LG to
shift that work/fun ratio toward the fun end by leaving the repetitive
work to the machines as much as possible - and leaving the fun,
interesting, challenging efforts to us humans.
</p>

<p>
I'm very, very glad that all of you are here to share this with me.
Thanks again, and I hope that our interaction continues and improves
with time.
</p>



<p>
[1] To the extent that a herd of cats can be coordinated, of course. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
Part of my enjoyment in all of this was seeing people indepently grab a
hunk of work and make it by-damn <strong>behave</strong> without much input from me.
</p>

<p>
I'd mentioned, in an email exchange with René Pfeiffer, that I don't
<em>want</em> to tie people down to process details. I've written or tweaked
every LG FAQ to define <em>results;</em> the implementation is mostly left
undefined, or stated in general terms. What I want is for everyone to do
their piece the way the think best; if they get stuck, I'm always here
to troubleshoot the process along with them. The way <em>I</em> do things is
only <em>my</em> way; it's not <em>the</em> way - and if you do them better than I do,
then I'll happily learn what you have to teach. That, to me, is one of
the best benefits that cooperation offers.

Not <em>just</em> Perl, dear sir; not just Perl. There's More Than One Way To
Do It.
