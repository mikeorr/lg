Thanks. I have to admit I have not yet taken your
advice, though they sound like good suggestions. I
did, however, find Marcel Gagne's book Moving to Linux
at the library. He mentioned Mandrake. I went to their
site, now Mandriva, and downloaded Mandriva One, a
free release (I'm willing to pay, but my needs are
light...no gaming, just music, video, word
processing.) However, when I try to open it, Microsoft
says it can't find the file to open it, and I get lost
after that. I've had MS Windows for 5 years, which I
installed, and I have downloaded a dozen or two
programs, but I'm still a newbie, I need specific
instructions in some cases. Like this one. Any help
would be most appreciated. The "Blue screen of Death"
is killing me! Thanks. John

Hi, John
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I can help a bit...

/Excellent/ choice. Marcel writes well and covers the basics to a "tee". It 
sounds like you got the 1st edition of M2L from the library; the 2nd edition 
is more up to date, and Marcel has come out with "Moving to Ubuntu Linux" 
just recently. All these books come with a "live boot" cdrom (although, it 
sounds like your library removed the one in M2L) that makes learning and 
migration a lot easier. 
</p>

<p>
For what it's worth, Marcel also runs an internet-based user group (the 
WFTL-LUG), with webpage, email and IRC support. You are always welcome to 
come over to <a href="http://www.marcelgagne.com/wftl-lug/index.html">http://www.marcelgagne.com/wftl-lug/index.html</a> or email 
wftl-lug at salmar.com, or even stop in for an IRC chat at chat.marcelgagne.com, 
channel #wftlchat. Marcel is usually around, and there are lots of us (you 
might have gathered that I'm involved <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> ) to help.

OK, I guess that this is the first problem we have to address. What you 
downloaded will be a file that, when burnt to CDROM or DVD, will be an entire 
CDROM's worth of files. Have you burnt the file to CDROM? (Note, you burn it 
as a "CDROM image", not as a file)
</p>

<p>
Most of those downloadable Linux systems (or "distributions", as we call them) 
are meant to be burnt directly to CDROM first. Installation (or "live boot" 
execution) is done from the CDROM. If you don't have a burner, or can't get 
the download to burn properly, then there are places that will sell you (for 
low dollars) a CDROM (cheapbytes.com, iirc) and some distributions (like 
Ubuntu) even offer a CDROM mailed to you for free (absolutely no cost, 
neither purchase nor postage, see https://shipit.ubuntu.com/ )
</p>

<p>
There /are/ a few downloadable distributions that are small enough to be 
unzipped to a floppy (tomsrtbt, for instance), but these distributions don't 
have the GUI tools that a beginner might feel more comfortable with. They are 
for hard-core commandline junkies, or people who want a "rescue" disk.
