The goal of <i>A Methodology for Developing and Deploying Internet &
Intranet Solutions</i> is to be a ``guide'' for project managers.
Almost all situations a project manager can
face--from project members to backup media to making time lines--are
described herein. The book consists of 11 chapters, plus appendices. Everything is
written as a story from the authors, who combined have more than 20 years of computer
experience. Every chapter contains small tips for the project manager.
<p>
In Chapter 1, the reader is introduced to employees of
a company that is used as a study case throughout the book.
<p>
In the next chapter a proposal is put forth, and all facets of handling
it from kick-off meeting to support organization to signing the contract are
described. In this book, the project manager makes use of the WBS (work
breakdown structure) model. This model breaks the project into phases and
sub-phases so that each can reach its own milestone.
<p>
Chapter 3 puts the reader into the place of a successful project
manager, who has convinced the ``customer'' to sign the contract.
The customer could be either internal (a department) or
external--imagine yourself as the consultant. This chapter begins with the internal kick-off
meeting. Roles and activities are assigned and given deadlines, so everyone
knows what to do when.
<p>
Discussion of the software development cycle begins in Chapter 4 with writing
an approach document. This chapter explains to the project manager what the
document must and must not contain--from requirements to education.
Also, some development methodologies are discussed.
<p>
Next, we get to the fun part (only 20 pages)--development. This is
familiar stuff which I face each working day with the Internet/Intranet.
The authors discuss creating HTML pages, internal, unit and system
testing and, last but not least, a checklist to see if everything is working.
<p>
The remaining six chapters (6 to 11) are short, averaging eight pages each.
Implementation is handled in Chapter 6; networking and backup are discussed
in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 covers the various applications and system testing at
a high level, so that you get a complete picture of how everything fits into the project.
The last three chapters are about putting the project on the user desk.
Also, two appendices are included, the first of which
is better: it is technical and briefly explains the
operating system layers and the Internet. While this information is not
presented in great detail,
what is here is quite interesting. The other appendix deals with project
management.
<p>
The book did not live up to my expectations. Too much of it is written in
the form of a diary or personal anecdotes for my tastes; not enough is
related to actual technical details of the Internet/Intranet.
<i>A Methodology for Developing and Deploying Internet & Intranet
Solutions</i> will bring no added value for persons who have already been
working for some years in the IT area. However, I do think it is a good
book for people who are new to the IT business, and who want to know more about
project management in order to become a project leader.
