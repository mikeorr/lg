<h1>Deividson on Databases: Views</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dokopnik.html">Deividson Luiz Okopnik</a></b></p>

<p>
PostgreSQL -
<em>"The world's most advanced open source database"</em> as stated at <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>
- is packed with features that can help you immensely when
developing applications. In this series, we will see three very
important, often under-utilized options that have a broad range of uses.
They are called <em>Views</em>, <em>Stored Procedures</em>, and <em>Triggers</em>.
</p>

<p>
We will use real-world examples, with lots of code to help you understand
those features.
</p>

<h3>Views</h3>
<p>
A View is a pre-selection of data that can be accessed by an SQL query.  It
minimizes the need for complex (sometimes very complex) SQL in your
application and is often used to retrieve data for standard reports or
other regularly-fetched data sets.
</p>

<p>
As an example, let's assume that you have the following tables in your
database (you can use these SQL commands to create your own test suite):
</p>

<pre class="code">create table cpu (
cpu_id serial primary key, 
cpu_type text );
	
create table video (
video_id serial primary key, 
video_type text );
	
create table computer (
computer_id serial primary key,
computer_ram integer,
cpu_id integer references cpu(cpu_id),
video_id integer references video(video_id)
);</pre>

<p>
And the following data inside it:
</p>

<pre class="code">insert into cpu(cpu_type) values('Intel P4 Dual Core D');
insert into cpu(cpu_type) values('AMD Athlon');

insert into video(video_type) values('Geforce 8600GT'); 
insert into video(video_type) values('Radeon 9550'); 

insert into computer values (0, 512, 1, 2);
insert into computer values (1, 1024, 2, 1);
insert into computer values (2, 512, 2, 2);</pre>

<p>
That's a pretty simple database with 3 tables - CPUs, video types, and
computers, tied up with Foreign Keys. Now let's say you need to fetch
the computer data from those tables - but you don't want the CPU and
Video IDs, just the description. You can use the following SQL:
</p>

<pre class="code">select a.computer_id, a.computer_ram, b.cpu_type, c.video_type 
from computer a, cpu b, video c 
where (a.cpu_id=b.cpu_id) AND (a.video_id=c.video_id);</pre>

<p>
That will return the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">0     512     "Intel P4 Dual Core D"     "Radeon 9550"
1    1024     "AMD Athlon"               "Geforce 8600GT"
2     512     "AMD Athlon"               "Radeon 9550"</pre>

<p>
Now if you use that same SQL a lot, you can simplify calling it by
defining a view, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">create or replace view computer_full(computer_id, computer_ram, cpu_type, video_type) as (
select a.computer_id, a.computer_ram, b.cpu_type, c.video_type 
from computer a, cpu b, video c 
where (a.cpu_id=b.cpu_id) AND (a.video_id=c.video_id)
);</pre>

<p>
That's <code>"create [or replace] view (view name) [(returned field aliases)]
as (sql)"</code>. The <code>"or replace"</code> is useful for testing: it
replaces the view if it already exists, so you don't need to DROP it
before re-creating. The field aliases are optional, and if omitted the
view will return the field names.
</p>

<p>
Now anywhere you need that same data, you can have it by executing
</p>

<pre class="code">select * from computer_full;</pre>

<p>
The result will be the same we have above. You can even use WHERE
clauses too, like:
</p>

<pre class="code">Select * from computer_full where computer_id=1</pre>

<p>
The result will be:
</p>

<pre class="code">1     1024     "AMD Athlon"     "Geforce 8600GT"</pre>

<p>
That helps, not only by simplifying your queries, but also makes it easier
in case you find a bug on your code, or a better way to do it - you simply
change the View, and in every place that you called it, the new code will
be executed. Let's change our view to a more professional way of selecting
data - <em>junctions</em>. Junctions are a better way of fetching data from
multiple tables, being faster than the labeling tables method we used
above. There's several ways of doing junctions, and on our example we can
choose between 2 of them:
</p>

<pre class="code">create or replace view computer_full as (
select computer_id, computer_ram, cpu_type, video_type from computer a
right join cpu b on (a.cpu_id=b.cpu_id)
right join video c on (a.video_id=c.video_id)
);</pre>

<p>
and
</p>

<pre class="code">create or replace view computer_full as (
select computer_id, computer_ram, cpu_type, video_type from computer
natural right join cpu
natural right join video
);</pre>

<p>
The first option, using "on" is used when the Column name you are
using to connect the two tables are different ('on
computer_cpu_id=cpu_id'), and the second one (natural join) is used when
both column names are identical. That's the reason we had to label our
tables (computer a, cpu b, video c) in our first example - using 'on
cpu_id=cpu_id' would be ambiguous. Try to always use Natural Joins
whenever possible - they are easier to understand and usually faster.
</p>

<strong>Temporary Views</strong>

<p>
Temporary Views are, just as the name says, temporary views. You can use
then just like views, but they are not supposed to be static (i.e., always
in your database.) A quick example of a temp view is:
</p>

<pre class="code">create temp view products (model, price) as
select model, price from pc union
select model, price from laptop union
select model, price from printer</pre>

<p>
and dispose of it with
</p>

<pre class="code">drop view test</pre>

<p>
Temporary views can be useful for storing the code of dynamic reports or
similar tasks.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Views are more of a convenience than a speed feature, but using them can be
helpful when developing systems.
</p>
<p>
There's a small .sql file
<a href="misc/dokopnik/test.sql">attached</a>
to this article - if you open it in PGAdmin, there's code to create test
data for our sample tables (50000 CPUs and Videos, 500000 computers).
You can use it to see how Views and normal SQL commands behave, speed-
wise, with a large dataset.
</p>
<p>
Well, that's it for this article, I hope it was useful - next
month, we'll cover Stored Procedures!
</p>
<p>
A special thanks goes out to teacher Saulo Benvenutti, great Database
teacher - it was a pleasure to be in your classes.
