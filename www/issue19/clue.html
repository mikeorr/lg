<h4>Welcome to installment 6 of Clueless at the Prompt:
a new column for new users.</h4>
<P><HR><P>
This time let's take a quick look at
the XF86Setup utility. at X window managers, concentrating on FVWM, adding
popup menus, adding and subtracting apps from existing popups and other
relatively easy ways to get a custom appearance and feel. 
<hr>
 <h4>Using XF86Setup to configure X</h4><p>
Judging from the posts I've seen on the usenet, a lot of people aren't
aware that there's an easier way to get X up and running than configuring
it the old confusing way(at least I found it to be that way), using a
tcl/tk script called XF86Setup. While it doesn't totally eliminate the
need to manually edit your XConfig, it does provide a method of getting a
usable configuration for most common video cards and monitors.  XF86Setup
first appeared in the XFree86 3.2 distribution, and uses the lowest common
denominator VGA 16 color mode server and a tcl/tk(corrections welcome)
script to start the config process in X and by using the graphical nature
of this utility script you can be almost certain to have X running in a
couple of tries, and if worst comes to worst you can have it running in 16
color mode until you can get the details to optimize it to your video
hardware. Current downloads of Xfree86 all seem to have this included, and
if your CDROM diskribution has X 3.2 or better you already have it
available to install to your HD. If you download it from xf86.org, be sure
to read the Relnotes for the component files necessary to insure a
successful install. You'll need :<ul>
<li>preinst.sh      Pre-installation script
<li>postinst.sh     Post-installation script
<li>X3?bin.tgz      Clients, run-time libs, and app-defaults files
<li>X3?doc.tgz      Documentation
<li>X3?fnts.tgz     75dpi, misc and PEX fonts
<li>X3?lib.tgz      Data files required at run-time
<li>X3?man.tgz      Manual pages
<li>X3?set.tgz      XF86Setup utility
<li>X3?VG16.tgz     16 colour VGA server (XF86Setup needs this
server)</ul>, where ?=the level of the distribution you're using, ie.3.2,
3.3 etc.,
for all installations, read the relnotes for any oher files your specific
hardware might need.
Since the 3.3 version just came out, if you are just getting around to
setting up X you will most likely want to get this distribution, since
every successive version has support for more hardware and often better
support for hardware already supported.
<p>OK, you have the files you need, that is the ones listed above, and the
server for your particular video card, in my case the SVGA server, you may
need to do a little detective work to determine which server to use.
If you are using the X version that comes on your CDROM, you can probably
install all the servers(assuming there's space on your HD)and let the
XF86Setup prog make the choice. To install,type:
<pre>
       cd /usr/X11R6
</pre>
Next, copy the preinst.sh and postinst.sh scripts to /var/tmp, then go to
/usr/X11R6 and type:
<pre>

        cd /usr/X11R6
        sh /var/tmp/preinst.sh
</pre>
the script will remove some symbolic links, and check to see that all the
files you need are available, and may output a message asking for those
files that are needed but not present. But assuming that you have followed
the above, everything should be in place, and you should get a generally
encouraging message on exit from the script.
<p>
Now for the installation itself,type:
<pre>
       tar -zxvf /wherever/you/have/X3?files.tgz
</pre>
you'll have to repeat this step with each of the required files, although
if you have these files in a directory by themselves, you may be able
to type:
<pre>
       tar -zxvf /wherever/youhavethem/*.tgz
</pre>
although it's been awhile, and I can't recall if it works, it won't hurt
anything to try, since the alternative is to unpack each tgz file
separately.
<p> Next you run the postinst.sh script in the same manner as the
preinst.sh above, this will make sure that you have all the X components
in the correct places.Run ldconfig something like:
<pre>
       ldconfig -m /usr/X11R6/lib
</pre>
or reboot to run ldconfig automatically. This links the libraries
necessary to run X. At this point you should be able to start the actual
setup by typing, naturally:
<pre>
       XF86Setup
</pre>
which will present a dialog box asking if you want to start in graphical
mode or tell you it will start momentarily.
At this point you'll be in X, using the 16 color VGA server.Read all the
instructions, and follow the routine, which I found to be pretty
self-explanatory. You will probably have the most trouble finding the
right mouse device and protocol, but try each one in turn if you aren't
sure. You'll probably also want to change the keyboard to 102key  US
International keyboard. Specify the video card, and monitor info, don't
worry if you don't know the salient monitor inf, you cna start at the top
of the list and work your way down the list until you reach a good
setting.Much easier if you have your monitor manual available, so have it
on hand if you can. Finish the routine when you think it's right and that
should do it. Congratulations on your hopefully valid Xconfiguration. If
you muff it just try again using slightly different settings until you do
get it right.
<hr>
<h4>Window Managers</h4>
Most Linux distributions that i'm familiar with use the FVWM window
manager as default and the rest of them should have it present, unless you
downloaded the files directly from xf86.org, in which case the default is
TWM.
<p>
FVWM is highly configurable by editing the 
/var/X11R6/lib/fvwm/system.fvwmrc file.You can use the file as it is,
since it has the most common installed features already configured, but
you can comment out those programs that you don't have installed by adding
a "#" at the beginning of the lines you wish to drop, change colors, add
popup menus, and more just by following the examples. Just be sure to save
the system.fvwmrc by typing:
<pre>
       cp /var/X11R6/lib/fvwm/system.fvwmrc
/var/X11R6/lib/fvwm/system.fvwmrc.old
</pre>
or something similar, so if you do mess up on your customization you can
always start from scratch by cp'ing .old to the original system.fvwmrc.A
couple of months ago The Weekend Mechanic column had some very cool ideas
on wallpapering the root window, so you might want to check them out.
<p>I made "Internet" and "PPP" popup menus to include lynx, Netscape and a
couple of telnet sites, as well as an IRC client, and to use the chat
script from X. you may have other ideas more to your liking, don't be
afraid to try, you can always start over again if you don't like the
results.
<p>
Take a look at my <a href="cluelist">system.fvwmrc</a>, nothing too
sophisticated, but if you compare it to the original you should get the
idea. I commented the changes that I made so you can see some of the
ways in which you can customize yours.
