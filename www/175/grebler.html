<h1>Pixie Chronicles: Part 3 PXE boot</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>


<h3>The Story So Far</h3>

<p>
In Part 1 I outlined my plans: to build a server using network
install. However, I got sidetracked by problems. In Part 2 I made some
progress and dealt with one of the problems. Now I'm going to detail
what I did when I got it right.
</p>

<h3>Quick Overview</h3>

<p>
The task is to install Fedora 10 on a machine (the target
machine) which will become a web and email server. I'm not going to
use CDs; I'm going to install from a network. So, somewhere on the
network, I need a machine to supply all the information normally
supplied by CDs or a DVD.
</p>

<h3>How booting from a disk works</h3>

<p>
When a machine is (re)started, the BIOS takes control. Typically, a
user configures the BIOS to try various devices in order (DVD/CD,
Floppy, HDD). If there is no removable disk in any drive, the boot
proceeds from the hard drive. The BIOS typically reads the first block
from the hard drive into memory and executes the code it finds
(typically GRUB). This leads to more reading and more executing.
</p>

<h3>How PXE works</h3>

<p>
When a machine using PXE is (re)started, it behaves like a DHCP
client. It broadcasts a request on a NIC using the <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address</A> (aka
Ethernet address) of the NIC as an identifier.
</p>

<p>
If the machine is recognised, the DHCP server sends a reply. For PXE,
the reply contains the IP address and a file name (the PXE boot Linux
kernel). The PXE client uses tftp to download the specified file into
memory and execute it. This leads to more reading and more executing.
</p>

<h3>Get the software for the PXE server</h3>

<p>
You'll need <tt>tftp-server</tt>, DHCP, <tt>syslinux</tt>.
</p>

<p>
I was already running <tt>dnsmasq</tt> as a DHCP server, so I didn't need to
install anything. There are many packages which can act as DHCP
servers. If you are already running DHCP software, you should be able
to use that. 
</p>

<p>
I didn't have tftp. Getting it on a Fedora machine is just:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	yum install tftp-server
</pre>

<p>
PXELINUX is part of the syslinux RPM (which came as part of my
server's Fedora distribution), but it's also available on the
installation images.
</p>

<h3>Configure DHCP</h3>

<p>
Since I was already running <tt>dnsmasq</tt> as a DHCP server, I just needed
to add a couple of lines:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	dhcp-host=00:D0:B7:4E:31:1B,b2,192.168.0.60
	dhcp-boot=pxelinux.0
</pre>

<p>
These lines say: if the host with MAC address
<strong>00:D0:B7:4E:31:1B</strong> asks, tell him his hostname is
<strong>b2</strong>, he should use IP address <strong>192.168.0.60</strong>
and tell him to boot the file <strong>pxelinux.0</strong> (by
implication, using <tt>tftp</tt>).
</p>

<pre>
	NB I'm using a non-routable IP address from the subnet
	<strong>192.168.0/24</strong> during the build of the server. Later,
	I will configure different IP addresses in preparation
	for using this server on a different subnet.
</pre>

<pre>
	NB Although I can specify a hostname here, in this case it
	acts merely as documentation because the install process will
	require that the name be specified again.
</pre>

<p>
	In other words, at this stage, these are interim values which
	may or may not be the same as final values.
</p>

<p>
Having made changes to the config file, I restart the DHCP server:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/dnsmasq restart
</pre>

<h3>Configure tftp</h3>

<p>
By default, <tt>tftp</tt>, which runs from <tt>xinetd</tt>, is
turned off. Edit <strong>/etc/xinetd.d/tftp</strong>

<pre class="code">
	< disable = yes
	---
	> disable = no
</pre>

<p>
Restart <tt>xinetd</tt>:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart
</pre>

<p>

If you examine <strong>/etc/xinetd.d/tftp</strong>, you will see that
the default configuration wants to serve <strong>/tftpboot</strong>. I
don't like to have such directories on my root partition, so I created
<strong>/tftpboot</strong> as a symlink pointing to the directory
which contained the requisite data.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	mkdir /Big/PXEBootServer/tftpboot
	ln -s /Big/PXEBootServer/tftpboot /
</pre>

<p>
Note that the use of a symlink keeps the path short. There are
limits; and it means there is less to type.
</p>

<p>

Either I wasn't thinking too clearly, or perhaps I was concerned that
I might not be able to get the net install to work, because I
downloaded 6 CD images instead of a single DVD. Knowing what I know
now, if I had to do it over, I would download just the DVD image. (The
old machine on which I want to install Fedora 10 only has a CD drive, not
DVD.)
</p>

<h3>Populate /Big/PXEBootServer/tftpboot:</h3>

<p>
One of the CD images which comes with Fedora 10 is called
<strong>Fedora-10-i386-netinst.iso</strong>; it has a copy of
<strong>pxelinux.0</strong> and some other needed files.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	mount -o loop -r /Big/downloads/Fedora-10-i386-netinst.iso /mnt2
	cp /mnt2/isolinux/vmlinuz /mnt2/isolinux/initrd.img /tftpboot
	cp /usr/lib/syslinux/pxelinux.0 /tftpboot
</pre>

<p>
(Note: I could also have typed
</p>

<pre class="code">
	cp /usr/lib/syslinux/pxelinux.0 /Big/PXEBootServer/tftpboot
</pre>

<p>
but using the symlink saves typing.)
</p>

<h3>Configure pxelinux</h3>

<pre class="code">
	mkdir /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg
</pre>

<p>
What do we have so far?
</p>

<pre class="code">
	ls -lA /tftpboot/.
total 19316
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  17159894 Nov 20 11:50 initrd.img
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root     13100 Feb  9  2006 pxelinux.0
drwxrwxr-x 3 root staff     4096 Nov 27 15:42 pxelinux.cfg
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root   2567024 Nov 20 11:50 vmlinuz
</pre>

<pre class="code">
	cd /tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg
</pre>

<p>
Most of the documentation says to create (<tt>touch</tt>) a whole
stack of files, but I prefer to make just two: one called
<strong>default</strong> as a backstop, and one with a name like
<strong>01-00-d0-b7-4e-31-1b</strong>. What is this?
</p>

<p>
Get the MAC address of the NIC to be used. This is nowhere near as
easy as it sounds. My PC has 2 NICs. Which is the one to use? It's
probably the one that corresponds to <strong>eth0</strong>. I
discovered which one was <strong>eth0</strong> by first booting into
the Knoppix CD - a very good idea for all sorts of reasons (see Part
2). Once booted into Knoppix, <strong>ifconfig eth0</strong> will give
the MAC address. In my case it was <strong>00:40:05:58:81:2F</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Now convert the colons to hyphens and upper- to lower-case:
</p>

<pre class="code">
        echo 00:D0:B7:4E:31:1B | tr ':A-Z' '-a-z'
00-d0-b7-4e-31-1b
</pre>

<p>
The required filename is this string preceded by <strong>01-</strong> ie
<strong>01-00-d0-b7-4e-31-1b</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
	NB Many documents disagree with me. They indicate that the
	file name should be in upper-case. Possibly different PXE
	clients operate in different ways, but my PXE client
	explicitly looks for lower-case.
</li>

<li>
	The <strong>01</strong> represents "ARP type 1" ie Ethernet.
</li>

<li>
	See <strong>/usr/share/doc/syslinux-3.10/pxelinux.doc</strong>.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
I chose to be very specific. I figured if the net install is
successful, I can use the same technique for other target machines. To
achieve that, each machine would be distinguished by its MAC address.
Consequently, I did not think it was a good idea to use
<strong>default</strong> for a specific machine. Rather, I configured
<strong>default</strong> to contain generic parameters to handle the
possible case of an as yet unconfigured machine performing a PXE boot.
<strong>default</strong> would also handle the case where I got the
MAC address wrong (for example while I was trying to figure if the
other file should be in upper-case or lower-case). Of course, the PXE
boot would behave incorrectly, but at least it would show that there
was some life in the system.
</p>

<p>
Here are the contents of the <strong>/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default</strong>:

<pre>
prompt 1
default linux
timeout 100

label linux
kernel vmlinuz
append initrd=initrd.img ramdisk_size=9216 noapic acpi=off
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Readers familiar with GRUB or LILO will recognise this as a boot
config file.
</p>

<p>
<strong>default</strong> is a generic config file. I could use it for
the installation, but I'd have to type a lot of extra args at
<strong>boot: </strong> time, for example
</p>

<pre class="code">
	boot: linux ks=nfs:192.168.0.3:/NFS/b2
</pre>

<p>
To save typing and to provide me with documentation and an audit
trail, I've tailored a config file specifically for my current server.
And how better to tie it to the target machine than by the target
machine's MAC address? (In the absence of user intervention, MAC
addresses are unique.)
</p>

<p>
<strong>/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/01-00-d0-b7-4e-31-1b</strong>:

<pre>
prompt 1
default lhd
timeout 100
display help.txt
f1 help.txt
f2 help.txt
f3 b2.cfg

# Boot from local disk (lhd = local hard drive)

label lhd
localboot 0

label linux
kernel vmlinuz
append initrd=initrd.img ramdisk_size=9216 noapic acpi=off

label b2
kernel vmlinuz
append initrd=initrd.img ramdisk_size=9216 noapic acpi=off ksdevice=eth0 ks=nfs:192.168.0.3:/NFS/b2
</pre>

</p>

<pre>
        NB It may look ugly, but the <strong>append</strong> line must be a single
        line. The kernel cannot handle any mechanism which attempts to
        split the text over more than one line.
</pre>

<p>
See <strong>/usr/share/doc/syslinux-3.10/syslinux.doc</strong> for
info on the items in the config file.
</p>

<p>
Please note that this is vastly different from the first file I used
(the one that got me into trouble). By this stage, the config file has
been refined to within an inch of its life.
</p>

<p>
Here are the little wrinkles that make this config file so much
better:
</p>

<pre>
<strong>default lhd</strong>
	tells the PXE client to use the entries under the label <strong>lhd</strong>
	by default

<strong>ksdevice=eth0</strong>
	forces the install to use <strong>eth0</strong> and avoids having <tt>anaconda</tt> (the
	Linux installer) ask the user which interface to use

<strong>ks=nfs:192.168.0.3:/NFS/b2</strong>
	tells <tt>anaconda</tt> where to find the kickstart file
</pre>

<p>
When the target machine is started, the PXE client will eventually
come to a prompt which says
</p>

<pre class="code">
	boot:
</pre>

<p>
If the user presses <tt>Enter</tt>, the machine will attempt to boot
from the local hard drive. If the user does not respond within 10
seconds (<strong>timeout 100</strong> has units of 1/10 of a second),
the boot will continue with the default label (<strong>lhd</strong>).
Alternatively, the user can enter <strong>linux</strong> (with or
without arguments) for different behaviour. In truth, I used this
label earlier in the development of this config file; I would lose
little if I now removed this label.
</p>

<p>
If the user presses function-key 1 or function-key 2 , help is
displayed. If the user presses function-key 3, the actual boot config
file is displayed (on the PXE server <strong>b2.cfg</strong> is just a
symlink pointing to
<strong>/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/01-00-d0-b7-4e-31-1b</strong>). I added
the <strong>f3</strong> entry largely for debugging and understanding
- there's nothing the user can do but choose menu options which are
displayed by <strong><A HREF="#details">help.txt</A></strong>.
</p>

<p>
This completes this part of the exercise. This is the point at which
you can try out the PXE process.
</p>

<h3>Try it out</h3>

<p>
Machines differ and I daresay PXEs differ. I will describe how my
machine behaves and what to expect.
</p>

<p> 
When turned on, my machine, a Compaq Deskpro EP/SB Series,
announces its own Ethernet (aka MAC) address and that it is trying
DHCP. The MAC address indicates which NIC is being used. This machine
will present this MAC address to the DHCP server, which hopefully will
respond with the offer of an IP address. It is also used at PXE
boot time when searching the TFTP directory for its config file.
</p>

<p>
If the DHCP server responds, then a series of dots appear as my
machine downloads the PXE boot Linux kernel. When the kernel is given
control it announces itself with the prompt <strong>boot:</strong>.
</p>

<p>
If you get to this point, then the PXE server has been configured
correctly, and the client and server are working harmoniously. In Part
4 I'll discuss the rest of the install.
</p>

<h3>It didn't work for me!</h3>

<p>
You might recall that in Part 1 Lessons from Mistakes I discussed this
subject. I will also confess that the first few times I tried to get
things going, I was not successful.
</p>

<p>
Here's what to do if things don't behave as expected.
</p>

<pre>
	This terminology is misleading. As much as you might like
	things to work first time, if you're human, chances are they
	don't. Consequently, you should <i>expect</i> things to <i>not</i> work.
	(You can feel that you are batting better than average when
	they do work.)
</pre>

<p>
Here's what to do when things go wrong. First, the target machine is
in a very primitive state so it is not likely to be of much help.
Since the process under investigation involves a dialogue between 2
machines, you would like to monitor the conversation (A said U1, then
B said U2, then A said U3, ... ). Who was the last to speak? What did
he say? What did I expect him to say?
</p>

<p>
Ideally, you would have a third machine on the same subnet as the 2
machines (the target machine and the PXE server). But that's unlikely,
and adds very little. Clearly, the place to monitor the conversation
is on the PXE server. Use <tt>tcpdump</tt> and <tt>tshark</tt> and/or
<tt>ethereal</tt>).
</p>

<p>
As my notes from the exercise say,
</p>

<pre>
	This gave me the opportunity to try and try, again and again,
	turning on tcpdump and tshark, and fiddling and fiddling until
	about the 15th time I got it right.
</pre>

<p>
Here's the expected conversation:
</p>

<pre class="code">
PXE client	sends broadcast packet with its own MAC address
PXE server	sends BOOTP/DHCP reply
</pre>

<p>
I see the above repeated another 3 times. Then,
</p>

<pre class="code">
PXE client	arp enquiry
PXE server	arp reply
</pre>

<p>
The arp enquiry comes from an IP address (earlier packets have an IP
address of 0.0.0.0), and confirms that the DHCP server has sent the
client an IP address and that the client has used the value specified.
</p>

<pre class="code">
PXE client	sends a RRQ (tftp read request) specifying <strong>pxelinux.0</strong>
PXE server	sends the file
</pre>

<p>
There should be many packets, large ones from the server (containing
the file data); small (length 4) acks from the client.
</p>

<pre class="code">
PXE client	sends a RRQ specifying <strong>pxelinux.cfg/01-00-d0-b7-4e-31-1b</strong>
</pre>

<p>
This is where you find out what <i>exactly</i> your PXE client is asking for.
</p>

<p>
I guess there are zillions of other ways that things could go wrong,
but the above covers pretty much everything I can think of.
</p>

<p>
Here's a complete conversation:

<em>
<p>
Henry has spent his days working with computers, mostly for computer
 manufacturers or software developers. His early computer experience
 includes relics such as punch cards, paper tape and mag tape. It is
 his darkest secret that he has been paid to do the sorts of things he
 would have paid money to be allowed to do. Just don't tell any of his
 employers. 
</p>

<p>
He has used Linux as his personal home desktop since the family got its
 first PC in 1996. Back then, when the family shared the one PC, it was a
 dual-boot Windows/Slackware setup. Now that each member has his/her own
 computer, Henry somehow survives in a purely Linux world.
</p>

<p>
He lives in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia.
