<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3>SCO may return from the Dead</h3>

<p>
Like a graveyard scene from an old B-movie, SCO is again rising as one of the UnDead.
</p>

<p>
A new cash infusion from a new set of partners will keep SCO from becoming
moribund. The funds, up to $100 million, are coming from New York-based
Stephen Norris Capital Partners and an undisclosed Middle Eastern investor.
This gives SCO additional funds for the upcoming trial date but at the cost
of privatizing the company and its assets.  This is a better attempt at
reorganization than the previous York Group proposal, which was deficient
on legal grounds. It also ejects the former CEO Darl McBride, with a tidy
sum and liability protection. Some comments on Slashdot and elsewhere have
suggested the arrangement may help hide any past links to Microsoft,
assuming there were any.
</p>

<p>
According to a February 15 posting on Groklaw, the new deal may better
provide for the "...avoidance of any antitrust worries Microsoft might
conceivably face from airing of linen." The Groklaw posting adds the
following concerns about the new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):
</p>

<p>
"Suitably insured, assuming they can find an insurance company stupid
enough to take on these liabilities, the company will go private and then
give its full and aggressive attention to raping and pillaging the FOSS
community some more with SCO's bogo lawsuits against Linux. Well, that's
how I read it. It is, of course, at least in part also a shot across the
bow of IBM. Still not interested in settling, the MOU fairly screams?"
</p>

<p>
But SCO doesn't actually have a $100M "War chest" from its new partners.
It's really a $5 million dollar deal with a $95 million line-of-credit,
subject to due diligence and discovery by the lenders. And the 'credit'
comes at a high interest rate.
</p>

<p>
Jim Zemlin, the president of the Linux Foundation, puts down the financial
threat more succinctly:
</p>

<blockquote>
"The terms of the proposal are publicly available with the court, and what
they show is that SCO would receive only $5 million dollars in cash - the
rest could only be drawn down at an exorbitant rate of more than 17%. Not a
very efficient cost of capital..."
</blockquote>

<p>
And if Novell and IBM prevail in court, SCO will owe a lot more than that.
</p>

<p>
See Groklaw on the MOU: <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080215072706542">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080215072706542</a>

<h3>HP Promotes Open Source Software Governance</h3>

<p>
In an announcement regarding FOSSology and FOSSBazaar, HP will help
companies address the legal, financial and security risks faced when
adopting free and open source software (FOSS). To help enterprise customers
mitigate these kinds of risks and realize the full business benefits of
free and open source software, HP has introduced FOSSology and FOSSBazaar -
the industry's first open source initiatives dedicated to these goals. 
</p>

<p>
FOSSology is based on the tools HP uses to effectively manage its own use
of free and open source software. It is designed to help users address
deployment issues such as the acquisition, tracking and licensing of FOSS.
This toolset is free and downloadable from <a
href="http://FOSSology.org">FOSSology.org</a> for immediate use under the
General Public License (GPL) version two.
</p>

<p>
FOSSBazaar makes HP's expertise freely available to the software community
as part of a collaborative effort with industry-leading software vendors
and the Linux Foundation. Coverity, DLA Piper, Google, Novell, Olliance
Group, OpenLogic and SourceForge have joined HP to offer online resources,
educational documentation and community interaction to address FOSS
business issues and promote best FOSS governance practices.
</p>


<h3>INTEL Spearheads Fibre Channel over Ethernet</h3>
<p>
Intel has released a developer software initiator kit to create Fibre
Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) solutions for the Linux. FCoE is a
specification proposed by Cisco that will allow Fibre Channel SAN traffic
to run over Ethernet. Consolidating LAN and SAN traffic onto a single
fabric can simplify network infrastructure and reduce data center costs.
</p> 

<p>
As part of the package, Intel has included a target simulator, so Linux
developers can test and modify the FCoE software stack. <a
href="http://Open-FCoE.org">Open-FCoE.org</a> is open to all FCoE
developers for source code download, code contribution and feedback. (Click
<a href="misc/dyckoff/FibreChan-Ethernet-encapsulation.png">here</a> to see
a diagram.)
</p>

<p>
Layers above FC-2 remain unchanged so the same FC fabric and traffic
management are used to link existing SAN switches.
</p> 

<p>
Intel is leading the Ethernet Enhancements efforts in the IEEE Intel to
create a lossless Ethernet fabric. Intel expects that FCoE will be quickly
become an industry standard for network storage.
</p>

<p>
Jordan Plawner, Intel Storage Product Planner, told the Linux Gazette: "We
are taking Fibre Channel and putting it on top of an Ethernet transport so
the server and target only see Fibre Channel. Our approach is very
evolutionary, not revolutionary, and makes for a nice deployment."
</p> 

<p>
All major Linux distros have iSCSI initiators. Intel wants all OS's in the
future to ship with a stack that supports both iSCSI and FCoE.
</p> 

<p>
"Server virtualization, database growth and compliance requirements have
created a greater need for network storage," said Pat Gelsinger, senior
vice president and general manger of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group.
"FCoE makes it easier and less expensive to connect servers to the SAN.
... We expect the Open Source community to use this initiator stack to
create reliable, standards-based FCoE solutions for their customers."
</p>

<p>
The FCoE software package is now available for download at
<a href="http://www.Open-FCoE.org">http://www.Open-FCoE.org</a> and can be
modified according to the terms of the GPLv2 license. The FCoE
specification is expected to be completed in 2008.

<h3>Products</h3>

<h4>Sun to Acquire VirtualBox Developer innotek</h4>

<p>
Sun Microsystems has announced that it will purchase innotek, the provider
of the open source virtualization software called VirtualBox. By enabling
developers to more efficiently build, test, and run applications on multiple
platforms, VirtualBox will extend the Sun xVM platform onto the desktop and
strengthen Sun's leadership in the virtualization market.
</p>

<p>
With over four million downloads since January 2007, innotek's open source
VirtualBox product has been established as a leading developer desktop
virtualization platform. VirtualBox enables desktop or laptop PCs running
the Windows, Linux, Mac, or Solaris operating systems to run multiple
operating systems side-by-side, switching between them with just
a click of the mouse.
</p>

<p>
"VirtualBox provides Sun with the perfect complement to our recently
announced Sun xVM Server product," said Rich Green, executive vice
president, Sun Software. "Where Sun xVM Server is designed to enable
dynamic IT at the heart of the datacenter, VirtualBox is ideal for any
laptop or desktop environment and will align perfectly with Sun's other
developer focused assets such as GlassFish, OpenSolaris, OpenJDK and soon
MySQL as well as a wide range of community open source projects, enabling
developers to quickly develop, test, and deploy the next generation of
applications."
</p>

<p>
VirtualBox is open source, and can be freely downloaded without the hassle
of payment or frustrating license keys at <a
href="http://virtualbox.org">http://virtualbox.org</a> or <a
href="http://openxvm.org">http://openxvm.org</a>.
The download is less than 20 megabytes and is easily installed on any
modern x86 architecture laptop or desktop system running Windows, Linux,
Mac, or Solaris operating systems. Supported guest operating systems include
all versions of Windows from 3.1 to Vista, Linux 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 kernels,
Solaris x86, OS/2, Netware, and DOS.
</p>

<p>
The Sun xVM family of products integrates virtualization and management to
help customers better manage both physical and virtualized assets across
heterogeneous environments. Previously announced products in the Sun xVM
line include Sun xVM Server and Sun xVM OpsCenter. Sun xVM Server is a
datacenter grade, bare-metal virtualization engine that can consolidate
Windows, Linux and Solaris operating system instances. Sun xVM Ops Center
is a unified management infrastructure for both physical and virtual assets
in the datacenter. More information about Sun xVM solutions can be found
at <a href="http://www.sun.com/xvm">http://www.sun.com/xvm</a>.
</p>

<h4>VMware Adds Virtualization Offerings with Acquisition of Thinstall, Foedus </h4>

<p>
VMware will acquire Thinstall, an application virtualization software
company in San Francisco. VMware is acquiring Thinstall to expand its
desktop virtualization capabilities to better provision, deploy, and update
desktop environments.
</p> 

<p>
Thinstall decouples applications from underlying operating systems,
improving isolation and portability for applications across desktop
environments. Thinstall's agentless approach to application virtualization
requires no pre-installed software on physical or virtual PCs and no new
deployment infrastructure or management tools. Thinstall's architecture
integrates into existing application management systems to deliver
virtualized applications across a variety of operating system versions and
enables applications to move with users as needed. Thinstall significantly
decreases the time to value of a software application and reduces the
overhead of costly integrations. For more information about Thinstall
please visit <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/Thinstall">http://www.vmware.com/go/Thinstall</a>.
</p>

<p>
VMware also will acquire services-related assets from Foedus. VMware
intends to leverage Foedus' application and desktop virtualization services
expertise to help VMware partners.
