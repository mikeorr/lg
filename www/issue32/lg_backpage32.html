Larry lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

<P>
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">David Bandel</H4>
David is a Computer Network Consultant specializing in Linux,
but he begrudgingly works with Windows and those ``real'' Unix
boxes like DEC 5000s and Suns. When he's not working, he can be found
hacking his own system or enjoying the view of Seattle from 2,500 feet up
in an airplane. He welcomes your comments, criticisms, witticisms, and will
be happy to further obfuscate the issue.

<P>

became a favorite in Austin's "Tech Connected" magazine.
The Dweebspeak Primer exists today in the form of an
email newsletter and website.  His articles have been
reprinted in places like IBM Personal Systems Magazine,
the legendary e-zine phrack, and the Manchester Guardian.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Ron Jenkins</H4>
Ron is the self taught, fairly unstable, and hopelessly
unskilled proprietor of Blackwing Communications.
He welcomes your comments, questions, and
corrections. When he's not giving out crummy advice, he can usually be
found warping young and old minds with what little expertise he has
managed to retain.

<P>

Vincent is a programmer, Unix/network administrator, and avid
Linuxer who goes snow skiing every chance he gets.  The day he

<P>

employed as a research professor at the Finnish Geodetic Institute.
His first UNIX experience was in 1984 with OS-9, running on a Dragon
MC6809E home computer (64k memory, 720k disk!). He is a relative newcomer
to Linux, installing RH4.0 February 1997 on his home PC and, encouraged,
only a week later on his job PC. Now he runs 5.0 at home, job soon to 
follow.
Special Linux interests: LyX, Pascal (p2c), tcl/tk.
