Well, Rick will make that issue however big he makes it, and if
I think it's excessive I'll cut it down again.  He gets brownie points
for actually citing specific instances.  That makes it less likely that I'll
delete the whole topic. :)

"Sluggo"?

I got tired of Iron, comrade.  It was s'posed to be a pun on Iron Orr.
A friend in college made it up.  (No, not the girl who always said 
"Mike Or What?") Then somebody turned it around to Iron Mike (Tyson), which I
did *not* intend.

I actually had to look up mechants.  The gist of it is obvious
from context but the real meaning is: "wicked" or "bad."

<P><STRONG>Sluggo wrote:</STRONG><BR>

It's not so much "easy" as that French and English have so many words in
common.  Plus the Unix terms (root, /bin) are borrowed from English.  I
found that reading a simple introductory grammar book (the paperback
Penguin one is good) to fill in "je", "&ccedil;a", "le", "de", "est", "cette",
"pour" goes a very long way.  It may not help you speak French or write
an answer, but it helps you understand short paragraphs of French you
may encounter.  I've never studied French formally, but it gave me 
enough to manage in Belgium.  (Where is the train station?  Which bus
goes to Verviers?)  

<P> Or to read the ATM messages.  That was a trip.  My friend and I 
decided to go to Li&egrave;ge for the weekend from Germany.  I was American
and he was Russian, and neither of us spoke French.  I went to the ATM
and withdrew the smallest amount: 100 franks.  I had no idea how much
100 franks was but the large number was ominous.  Still, I reasoned the
smallest amount the ATM gives must be around $20.  Eventually I realized
it was $33.

i have a 1996 4runner at times when i park i can smell
hot oil there are no leaks nowhere. the motor is
excellent clean. where could this be coming from. it
doesn't happen all the time. thanks

Please, please do not waste my time with pointless
questions!!! This is not Linux specific (or LWM
specific).

<P><STRONG>Ben wrote:</STRONG><BR>

Oh, c'mon, Thomas. You know what the answer is - the querent is running
Wind*ws. It's only Linux that creates no muss, no fuss, and no greasy
aftertaste.


<P><STRONG>Thomas wrote:</STRONG><BR />

&lt;I roll my eyes&gt; Silly me!! That must be it.

<P><STRONG>Ben wrote:</STRONG><BR>

Any 4runner of the latest version of the kernel should be upgraded -
particularly if it goes as far back as 1996, even if the motor, I mean
kernel is "excellent clean" (e.g., "make clean" was run before
compilation.) The hot oil smell is the poor machine trying to get some
work done and bogging down in warmfuzzy "Wind*ws Will Not Harm You,
Little Human!" themes, automatic MSN installations, and "Wind*ws has
detected that your wire-haired terrier has peed in the corner. Please
wait while we download the appropriate 147.3Gb driver" messages.

<P><STRONG>Thomas wrote:</STRONG><BR>

LOL....not to mention the classic BSOD "screensaver".

<P><STRONG>Ben wrote:</STRONG><BR>
What most people never realize is that it _is_ a screensaver. I mean,
who's going to believe that an operating system can actually *crash?*
Who do they think they're kidding, anyway?

The only problem with the BSOD screensaver is that you have to enter the
Micr*s*ft EULA in Linear B (don't forget the breathing marks) as the
password...

<P><STRONG>Thomas wrote:</STRONG><BR>
I say screensaver -- it might as well now be
synonymous with it :-)

<P><STRONG>Ben wrote:</STRONG><BR>

&lt;shrug&gt; It was *obvious*, and I'm shocked - shocked, I tell you - that
you tried to dodge answering such a simple, and above all _relevant_
question.
	
<P><STRONG>Thomas wrote:</STRONG><BR>
Oh, but, Ben -- when we team up like this.............

<P><STRONG>Ben wrote:</STRONG><BR>

Tune in next week for our next thrilling episode of The Answer Gang,
when Thomas and I explain the benefits of sharpening a chainsaw while
it's running (the same precautions as for using Wind*ws apply [1], so
it's absolutely safe! Oh, here - this tourniquet will help. Don't get
any on my nice chainsaw.)


[1] Let someone else do it. Oh, wait - friends don't let friends sharpen
running chainsaws...

I write the recently-revived series "The Linux Weekend Mechanic", which was
started by John Fisk (the founder of Linux Gazette) in 1996 and continued
until 1998.  I'm also a member of The Answer Gang.

<P> I was born in Hammersmith (London UK) in 1983.  When I was 13, I moved to
the sleepy, thatched roofed, village of East Chaldon in the county of Dorset.
I am very near the coast (at Lulworth Cove) which is where I used to work.

<P> I first got interested in Linux in 1996 having seen a review of it in a
magazine (Slackware 2.0). I was fed up with the instability that the then-new
operating system Win95 had and so I decided to give it a go.
Slackware 2.0 was great. I have been a massive Linux enthusiast ever
since.  I ended up with running SuSE on both my desktop and laptop computers.

<P> While at school (<A HREF="www.purbeck.dorset.sch.uk">The Purbeck
School</A>, Wareham in Dorset), I was actively involved in setting up two
Linux proxy servers (each running Squid and SquidGuard).  I also set up
numerous BASH scripts which allowed web-based filtering to be done via
e-mail, so that when an e-mail was received, the contents of it were added to
the filter file. (Good old BASH -- I love it)

<P> I am now 18 and studying at University (Southampton Institute, UK), on a
course called HND Business Information Technology (BIT). So far, it's great.

<P> Other hobbies include reading. I especially enjoy reading plays (Henrik
Ibsen, Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw), and I also enjoy literature (Edgar Allan
Poe, Charles Dickens, Jane Austin to name but a few).

<P> I enjoy walking, and often go on holiday to the Lake District, to a place
called Keswick. There are numerous "mountains", of which "Great Gable" is my
most favourite.

<P> I am also a keen musician. I play the piano in my spare time. 

<P> I listen to a variety of music. I enjoy listening to
Rock (My favourite band is "Pavement" (lead singer:
Stephen Malkmus). I also have a passion for 1960's
psychedelic music (I hope to purchase a copy of
"Nuggets" reeeeaaall soon).
