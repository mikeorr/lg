<center><h3>Window-Manager News</h3></center>

<center><h4><a href="mailto: layers@vax2.rainis.net">by Larry
Ayers</a></h4></center>


<p>Window-managers seem to be unique to unix-derived operating systems.
Rather than assuming all windowing/GUI tasks, the X-server confines itself
to the basic grunt-work of facilitating communications between the graphics
hardware and the kernel.  This is typical unix behavior, in which complex
tasks are broken up into sub-tasks performed by separate programs.  This is
beneficial to the end-user.  If something goes wrong in such a system it is
easier to place blame and isolate the problem; flexibility and
configurability are also much greater than in systems in which the graphic
interface duties are intertwined inextricably with basic kernel
functions.

<p>The end result of this is that if you start the X-server ``bare'' (without a
window manager) you will see borderless windows on a gray and black stippled
background.  Few people want this appearance, so over the years a wide variety
of window-managing software has been developed.  Some are proprietary, but in
the free software world there are several active projects, a few of which I'll
discuss in this article.

<hr>

<center><h4>FVWM</h4></center>

<p>The F(?) Virtual Window Manager is, for several good reasons, the most
commonly used Linux window manager.  It was originally an offshoot of an early
manager called Twm, but has evolved considerably in recent years.

<p>Rob Nation, who was also partially responsible for top and rxvt, was the
maintainer of the 1.xx versions of Fvwm.  This series reached a developmental
plateau a few years ago and a new group of developers adopted the program and
initiated the 2.xx series.  The 1.xx versions are stable and reliable and are
still being used by many people, though they aren't actively maintained.

<p>I won't go into the basic features of Fvwm, as this topic has been
well-covered (by John Fisk and others) in past issues of the Gazette.  Since
those articles appeared there have been many new features and modules added to
Fvwm, a few of which I'll describe.

<p>By the way, don't be put off by the beta status of the 2.xx versions;
since about version 2.0.37 the program has been relatively easy to compile and
free of any but very minor bugs.  Version 2 is asymptotically approaching a
major release which will be version 2.1.

<p><center><b>New Features</b></center>

<p>I can't help but think that the developers working on Fvwm2 are keeping an
eye on the upstart Afterstep window-manager, which is based on Fvwm2 code.
The newest Fvwm2 release (as of Jan 24,1997) is 2.0.45; patches have been
incorporated which give Fvwm2 some of the nicer decorative features of
Afterstep.  These include tiled pixmaps for window-borders and title bars, as
well as gradient-shading of the title bar from one color to another.  Another
addition is the ability to use mini-icons for title bar buttons.  If you're not
interested in such decorative elaborations they can be easily disabled by
editing the <i>fvwm.tmpl</i> file before compilation.  The new release is
worth obtaining even if you don't care about the new visible features, as many
bugs have been fixed.  The man-page has also been expanded and updated to
cover these changes.

<p>It's now possible to write Fvwm modules in either Perl or Python.  Several
examples of each are included in the distribution, which is available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2">this Hawaiian site.</a>

<center><h4>Afterstep</h4></center>

<p>If you are fond of the appearance of the NExtstep operating system, you'll
probably like Afterstep.  This is an offshoot of Fvwm2 development which has
attracted much attention recently in the Linux community, to the point where
it is being included (despite its beta status) in some newer distributions.

<p>Afterstep pioneered the use of pixmaps and mini-icons in borders and
title-bars, as mentioned in the Fvwm2 section above.  But the major difference
is the Wharf module, a very configurable tool bar which uses larger-than-normal
icons (64x64).  The supplied icons are very stylish, and can be configured to
have gradient-shaded backgrounds.  As with the Fvwm2 Buttons module, the Wharf
(NExt calls it a ``dock'') can ``swallow'' applications and other modules.  Lately
modules designed to be swallowed by the Wharf have become available from the
Afterstep web-sites.  Among these are a PPP dialer, a CD-player, and a mixer.

Home Page</a> for the latest news and releases.

<center><h4>Wm2</h4></center>

Possibly as a reaction to the growing number of unnecessary features in the
other window-managers, <a href="mailto:cannam@zands.demon.co.uk">Chris
Cannam</a> has written a minimalist window-manager called Wm2.  This small and
fast window-manager was inspired by the Plan 9 manager, which is part of the
experimental Plan 9 operating system.  There are no icons, virtual desktops,
or configuration files, in stark contrast to the other managers discussed
here, just nicely framed windows and a simple menu which starts an xterm and
lists active and hidden windows.  The windows are framed in a distinctive
manner, with no top title bar.  Instead a shaped tab protrudes from the top of
the left side of the window with the title displayed vertically.

<p>Rather than include a screen shot of Wm2 in action, here are links to the
Wm2 web page which has links to both a screen shot and the source itself:<br>

<p><a href="wm2.html">The Wm2 Page (local)</a><br>

<p><a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~cannam/wm2.html">
The Wm2 Page (WWW)</a>

<p>Wm2 is still relatively new; I have noticed that it stresses the X-server
more than would be expected of such a small application, possibly because of
its use of the shaped-window X-extension.  Screen refreshes seem to be slow.
Nonetheless in this third version it seems to be stable, and it provides a
refreshing contrast to the complexity of the other window-managers. The only
configuration involved comes before compilation of the source.  The various
colors and preferred terminal emulator can be set in the <i>Config.h</i> file;
after installation the only way to change these settings is to re-edit and
recompile.

<p>If you'd like more information on these as well as several other
window-managers, visit<br> <a href="http://www.PLiG.org/xwinman">this excellent
site</a>, which has many links and screen shots.<br>
