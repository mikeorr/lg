<h1>Codeweavers vs. Cedega, Commercial Wine Product Comparison</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/hoogland.html">Jeff Hoogland</a></b></p>


<p>
Most people who use Linux for desktop use are well aware of the one of
the largest issues facing the platform: Lack of commercial software. Now in
most cases this is not an issue, no MS Office - use OpenOffice, no Internet
Explorer - use FireFox. However one thing which there is currently no
replacement for is gaming. Try as they might there are just not enough
Open-Source game developers (or even closed-sourced ones) that bring the
level of gaming quality, as of yet, to Linux that Windows enjoys.
</p>

<p>
Enter the world of Win-on-Lin. The Wine Project, was started in 1993 and
has slowly come into maturity over the course of the last sixteen years.
Wine is a compatibility layer, or more precisely a reimplementation of the
Windows API, that allows Windows applications to run under Linux. While the
Wine project does a wonderful job of what it is designed to do (run Windows
applications on Linux) how ever it sorely lacks in the means of a GUI front
end for easy configuration/calibration.
</p>

<p>
Which brings me to my topic at hand - Cedega &amp; Codeweavers. What are
Cedega and Codeweavers? They two (closed source) programs both based off of
the Wine Project to create what it lacks - a user friendly interface.
Designed to help you get your Windows games working with ease on Linux.
They both have their ups and downs and today I am going to look at each
program and see how they compare.  I currently have both Cedega and
Codeweavers licenses so all the information given is from first hand
experience working with both products. I'm going to be judging based on
following criteria:


<ol>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong> - How well do they do what they are
suppose to do?</li>
<li><strong>GUI Front End</strong> - How do the front-ends between the two
compare?</li>
<li><strong>Website</strong> - Being able to find information is
everything, how do the websites compare?</li>
<li><strong>Customer Service/Support</strong> - If you are paying for a
product you want to know you can get help with it if it doesn't work
properly.</li>
<li><strong>Fees &amp; Licensing</strong> - How much do they cost and what
are you paying for?
</li>
</ol>
</p>


<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p>
Cedega does a fairly good job of helping the user get their programs up
and running. Upon selecting install it auto-detects any disc drives on the
system for known game discs it can install. If it does not find any (or
finds the wrong one) it is easy enough to direct it to the proper file/disc
via the GUI. One of the things I really like about Cedega is the large
number of pre-defined profiles it contains for different game titles (and
just because you game isn't listed doesn't mean it will not work).
Basically what this means is when you install a game that has a profile it
automatically uses what are known to be the "best Wine settings" to get the
optimum performance out of your game.
</p>

<p>
While Cedega does a great job at actually running the important parts of
your games it is obvious that certain aspects of some programs have been
neglected, Steam for instance works fine for loading and playing games but
the friends network does not work in the slightest and installing flash for
it is difficult at best.
</p>

<p>
Also worth noting here is that while Cedega started off as a fork of the
Wine project (version 4.0 and earlier of Cedega was known as WineX or Wine
Extreme) initially, it is no longer associated with it. Because of this of
this fact the Windows API behind Cedega is also now different from that
which powers Wine and as such there are a few applications that will not
function under Wine (or things powered by Wine) that perform with out a
hick-up under Cedega.
</p>

<p>
All in all I'm giving Cedega a 9 out of 10 points for functionality - it
is a good software.
</p>

<p>
<em>    Functionality</em> 9/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 9/10
</p>

<p>
Upon opening the Codeweavers program installer you are presented with a
small list of applications that it will auto install and configure for you.
I say small list because by comparison to the amount of game profiles
listed under Cedega it feels somewhat incomplete. How ever as with Cedega
just because the game you want to run is not on the list does not mean that
it will not work. Also like Cedega, Codeweavers will auto detect any disc
drives you have when you go to install a piece of software, one thing I
also really like is that when detecting disc drives it also detects mounted
iso files you may want to install from.
</p>

<p>
While the given list of games that are pre-configured in Codeweavers is
small compared to the games list present in Cedega, it is very obvious that
most of the games on the list have been worked on extensively to get them
working to a optimum level with a careful attention to detail. Using Steam
as my example again upon installation Codeweavers downloads and configures
flash, in addition to other things, to help it work almost as good as it
does natively on Windows (the only issue currently with the Steam UI is a
small scroll bar issue).
</p>

<p>
Codeweavers is based directly off the Wine project, as such if a program
works poorly under Wine odds are it is going to work just as poorly under
Codeweavers. As such this also means that any performance you see with an
application under Codeweavers can be replicated under just a standard Wine
install (how ever it may take you several hours to get everything just
right).
</p>

<p>
I'm giving Codeweavers an 8 out of 10 on functionality. It is good
software but it needs to expand its games list some.
</p>

<p>
<em>    Functionality</em> 8/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8/10
</p>

<h4>GUI Front End</h4>
<p>
One of the most important things about both these pieces of software is
their GUI. One of the wonderful things about Linux is how alot of things
"just work" and having a front end to install Windows applications through
is a nice addition to have.
</p>

<p>
The Cedega GUI does a nice job of giving you a centralized location to
house all of your Games/Windows applications. (You can add launchers for
your favorite native Linux apps/games to it as well) Also present in Cedega
that Codeweavers does not have is a "diagnostic test". Basically it checks
over your hardware and configuration for anything that may cause issues
when running your games. In addition to being able to check your
configuration the diagnostic tool also allows for an easy copy and paste of
your system specifications which is useful if you are unsure of your setup
(or too lazy to type it out) when trying to debug an issue.
</p>

<p>
Lacking in the Cedega GUI how ever are native menu entries. Applications
installed under Cedega often times feel foreign as you have to open a
separate program to launch them or create your own custom menu entry (and
hunting down the correct icon for you game can be a headache). Also worth
noting with netbooks becoming more and more popular is that the Cedega GUI
is obviously designed for a resolution of at least 768 pixel height, parts
of it get cut off on most netbook screens. The Cedega GUI as a whole is
good but it could stand a few changes - 8 out of 10
</p>

<p>
<em>    GUI Front End</em> 8/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 8.5/10
</p>

<p>
While Codeweavers does not give you a centralized location for all your
install applications like Cedega does, however it is still well done.
Codeweavers does a beautiful job of integrating with your local menus
(Gnome, KDE, ect) when installing applications. In fact if Codeweavers
would simply add the games you install to the games section of your menu
instead of its own section I do not think most users would be able to tell
the difference between a natively installed game and one installed via
Codeweavers. Same as Cedega here 8 of 10, fully functional but could still
be slightly better.
</p>

<p>
<em>    GUI Front End</em> 8/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8/10
</p>

<h4>Website</h4>
<p>
Knowledge is power as they say, one of the most important things about
any piece of software you may have is that you fully understand how to use
it. Often times these days ones of the best resources for learning such
information is an application's homepage.
</p>

<p>
Cedega's home page is relatively horrid to say the least. It does
provide the basic information on the product and pricing but that is about
it. Many parts of the website have been 100% non-functional for the last
months I have had my subscription and it really takes from the product as a
whole. Voting for which applications you wish to be supported is one key
feature that is lacking for example. On top of this another "feature" of
the page is that you cannot view certain data if you do not have a current
subscription - meaning if you are someone looking into Cedega to see if it
will run a certain game you will have to pony up the cash to give it a try.
Also horrid is the Cedega rating system for applications which has three
options: "Certified, Works, and Known not to Work". Certified means you are
able to contact customer service in order to get help with said application
should an issue arise and well the other two kind of explain them self.
Also, and this is not Cedega's fault per-say but odds are is due to a small
user base, but the information about many application in their listing is
rather lacking by comparison to others.
</p>

<p>
Cedega's website needs some HUGE improvements, as of now it is
functional. So I'll give it a 4 out of 10.
</p>

<p>
<em>    Website</em> 4/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 6.7/10
</p>

<p>
Codeweaver's website is a refreshing change from that of Cedega. It is
obviously that of a professional company, the layout is nice and everything
is clearly labeled. Everything is accessible with or with out a user login.
If you are a member they have a nice system for allowing you to "vote" for
which applications you would like to see better support for (So they know
what they should be spending time working on). The user forums are slightly
non-standard but not necessarily in a bad way, they just take some getting
used to. Also a feature worth noting is Codeweavers ticketing system, you
can browse past support tickets that yourself or other people have posted
for solutions to past issues.
</p>

<p>
I really do not have anything bad to say about the Codeweavers website,
it is well done and fully functional - 10 out of 10
</p>

<p>
<em>    Website</em> 10/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8.5/10
</p>

<h4>Customer Service/Support</h4>
<p>
So one of the most important things to know when you are buying
something is that you are going to be able to get support for the product
if it does not work as it is suppose to.
</p>

<p>
Cedega's customer support is decent. They give you a good response and
help you solve any issues you may be having to a satisfactory amount. How
ever also worth noting is that the only way to get customer support is via
Email. And they only provide official support for their list of forty or so
"certified" games and if you are running certain hardware configuration
(they only support nVidia gfx cards and certain distros). And I feel I
should also mention that their customer service is rather slow to return
emails.
</p>

<p>
They also how ever have community powered message boards (which they
link from their website) where there are a few very dedicated people who
work hard to help people solve their problems, I found these boards to be a
much faster response than the official email support.
</p>

<p>
Cedega customer support isn't bad per-say but it also is not anything
exceptional - 7 out of 10
</p>

<p>
<em>Customer Service/Support</em> 7/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 7/10
</p>

<p>
Codeweaver's provides two different channels of customer support, one
through their wonderful ticket/email system and on their official message
boards. The response time for a ticket I have filed has never been less
than a day, often times if I filed the ticket during normal business hours
I would see a response within a few hours. Their forums also have a few
helpful individuals as well as good number of staff that watch over and do
their best to help out with any issues that may arise while using the
software.
</p>

<p>
No customer support is perfect but Codeweaver's is darn good to say the
least 9 out of 10
</p>

<p>
<em>Customer Service/Support</em> 9/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8.75/10
</p>

<h4>Fees and Licensing</h4>
<p>
I've spent time talking about the ups and downs of these two pieces of
software now - how do you get it? And more importantly how much does it
cost?
</p>

<p>
Cedega starts at $15 for a three month subscription with varying prices
if you buy for an extended length of time ($45 for a year for instance).
Cedega is yours to install so long as you keep paying for it (after the
subscription runs out you will no longer be able to download Cedega anymore
- meaning if you format you are SOL). Also worth mentioning here is that
the only "demo" Cedega provides is for a single game - Spore. And as I said
above you cannot see the full games data base unless you also pay for it.
So unless you know someone else with a subscription you may very well pay
for it to try a game only to find out doesn't work well. Too be fair though
it's only $15 for the three months, not truly expensive. I personally do
not care for how Cedega licensing works - 6 out of 10.
</p>

<p>
<em>Fees and Licensing</em> 6/10 - <strong>Cedega Total</strong> 6.8/10
</p>

<p>
Codeweaver's CXGames costs $40 for the product and a year's worth of
support and updates. After that it is $35 for a following year of
support/updates and even if you do not renew you still get to continue
using the Codeweavers software you had paid for initially. Now $40 is a
fair bit of cash if you are unsure if something is going to work for you -
however Codeweavers offers a 7 day demo of the full software so you can use
it and see if it works for your needs. Also worth noting is that while
Codeweavers is closed source software they are powered directly by the Wine
project - and as such they give back to it (with code and money). I don't
mind paying a reasonable cost for good software and the fact that they give
some of it back to the Wine project also makes me feel good - 9/10
</p>

<p>
<em>Fees and Licensing</em> 9/10 - <strong>Codeweavers Total</strong> 8.8/10
</p>

<p>
<strong>Final Scores - </strong>Cedega 6.8 &amp; Codeweavers 8.8
</p>

<h4>Follow Up</h4>
<p>
Obviously no piece of software is perfect - these two included - and
while Wine technology has come a long way in the last decade (or so) it
still has a long way to go. As you can see from the numbers and the above
information I prefer Codeweavers to Cedega, come the end of the year I do
not think I will be renewing my Cedega license Which of the two is right
for you is your choice, I just hope my little comparison here may have
presented you with some information on each of them you had not known
before.
