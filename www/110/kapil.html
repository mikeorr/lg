<h1>A Knight's Tour on OCaml (when a Python fails to digest it)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

The story begins<sup><a name="text1" href="#note1">1</a></sup>
when my daughter's teacher, who is then busy grading the
end-term examination papers, wanted to give the class
some busy work. So the teacher asked the children to find a ``Knight's
tour''---make a knight jump around on a chess board starting and ending at
the same square and landing on each other square exactly once. Naturally,
this problem landed on my doorstep at the end of the school day---the
teacher happens to know that I do mathematics!

<p> I have heard that this problem has a solution but don't know one---typical
Mathematician---stops at the point where ``solution exists''. So why not
write a program to solve the problem? While the going is good, I could
also use this opportunity to learn to use another programming language.

<p> 

<h2><a name="htoc1"></a>The quick and the dirty</h2>

Let's start by writing a program in a scripting language like
<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>---it <em>is</em> fun writing a program in
a new language when you are reasonably sure that the code will not
be longer than about a 100 lines!

<p> The key pseudo-code can be stated as follows:
<pre class="code">
      extension of a partial solution =
            if (Length of the partial solution is 64) then
                  if (the solution closes on itself) then
                        return the solution
                  else
                        return false since this is not a solution
            else
                  for each position in available moves
                   that has not already been occupied
                     try  extension of the new partial solution
                           obtained by extending the current solution
                           by this move
</pre>We then start with any position on the chess-board and find an extension of
it by 63 more moves.

<p> This is programmed in Python quite easily. We use the Python ``workhorse''
data structure---the list. A partial solution is a list of positions which
we think of as the sequence of moves.
<pre class="code">
def   extend(soln):
      if len(soln) == 64:
            if soln[-1] in moves(soln[0]):
                  return soln
            else:
                  return False
      else:
            for newpos in moves(soln[0]):
                if newpos in soln:
                   continue
                sol=extend([newpos]+soln)
                if not sol:
                   continue
                else:
                   return sol
            return False
</pre>There is a nasty tail to this Python program fragment (the tail consists of 63
returns) but that should not be serious if we have enough stack space.
For us quicky-types ``optimization'' is a dirty word.

<p> We also need to write routines that will generate the list of all possible
moves at a given position.

<p> If we represent positions on the board as pairs then the moves that a
knight can make are given by
<pre class="code">
   [(-1,-2), (-2,-1), (1,-2), (-2,1), (-1,2), (2,-1), (1,2), (2,1)]
</pre>then the code fragment for this looks like
<pre class="code">
knightsmoves = [(-1,-2), (-2,-1), (1,-2), (-2,1), \
                (-1,2), (2,-1), (1,2), (2,1)]

def add(pos1,pos2):
      return (pos1[0] + pos2[0], pos1[1] + pos2[1])

def onboard(pos):
      return (pos[0] &gt;= 0) and
             (pos[0] &lt; 8)  and
             (pos[1] &gt;= 0) and
             (pos[1] &lt; 8)

def moves(pos):
       return [newpos for newpos in
                          [add(pos,move) for move in knightsmoves]
                      if onboard(newpos)]
</pre>Unfortunately, as it stands this program has no hope of producing an
answer in reasonable time. The reason is that we are trying <em>all</em>
possible moves in succession whereas we should be <em>first</em> going to
the square which cannot be easily reached from elsewhere. This means that
we need some new functions.
<pre class="code">
def filmoves(pos,soln):
      return [newpos for newpos in moves(pos)
                     if not (newpos in soln)]

def compval(pos1,pos2,soln):
      return len(filmoves(pos1,soln)) - len(filmoves(pos2,soln))

def sortedmoves(soln):
      list = filmoves(soln[0],soln[1:])
      list.sort(lambda x,y: compval(x,y,soln))
      return list
</pre>The first function filters out moves already ``used up''.
The second uses this to compare two squares based on number of moves
currently available. The last function uses this comparison to sort the
moves. Note that we must also make a minor change to the <tt>extend</tt> function
to make it use <tt>sortedmoves</tt> (<b>Warning</b>: Only use <tt>sortedmoves</tt>
in the second call!).

<p> According to
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KnightsTour.html">authoritative sources</a>
(authoritative at least
according to Google!) this particular algorithm was proposed by Warnsdorff
in 1823. The above program is simple enough that we can ``see'' that it is
correct and do not need any fancy verification procedure. Why then does
is fail to give an answer when we start at the corner (0,0)? Surely a
modern computer can beat a man born in 1823 in calculating things! What's
wrong?!

<p> If you don't believe me or believe that your computer is faster then
just <a href="misc/kapil/knights.py.txt">copy</a> the code or type it in yourself and give it a whirl!
<pre class="code">
      $ python
      Python 2.3.4 (#2, Sep 24 2004, 08:39:09)
      [GCC 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-12)] on linux2
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for
         more information.
      &gt;&gt;&gt; from knights import *
      &gt;&gt;&gt; extend([(0,0)])
</pre>The program now appears to go sleep...!

<p> Perhaps the reason is that Python is <em>interpreted byte-code</em>. A
compiled language would be better. So we can set about downloading and
installing <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net">psyco</a>---a just-in-time
native code compiler for Python.
Meanwhile, we could try a ``real'' functional language---perhaps its
implementation of lists is better. Maybe we can fit in time for a few
functional programming tricks and see if tail-recursion is possible.
(If you want a preview of the <em>real</em> answer, then jump to
the <a href="#denouement">Denouement</a>.)

<p> 

<h2><a name="htoc2"></a>A humpy ride on OCaml</h2>

(I do happen to know that there is a more famous camel that appears more
often in the pages of the Linux Gazette.) A nice candidate for our next
choice of language is <a href="http://caml.inria.fr">OCaml</a> (this is
also talked about in an <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue99/stellingwerff.html">article</a> in an
earlier Gazette). It is claimed that the optimizing native-code compiler
for OCaml can beat even C in certain tasks. I have actually used the DVI
previewer <tt>advi</tt>, the L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X to HTML converter
<tt>hevea</tt><sup><a name="text2" href="#note2">2</a></sup> and the file
synchronizer <tt>unison</tt>; all these are written in OCaml and are quick
and do the job well.  Secondly, it <em>would</em> be a pain to sit and
implement all the data structure management for lists in C just for this.
So the knight must try to tour again---this time atop OCaml<sup><a
name="text3" href="#note3">3</a></sup>.

<p> Just to clarify some of the differences
<tt>let</tt> plays the role of <tt>def</tt> and lists are constructed in
the form <code>[a;b;c;d]</code>. The syntax is also a little more arcane
but should be clear from the programs below.

<p> While we are at it we can also introduce a tweak that avoids computing the
length of a list all the time. Here is <tt>extend</tt> written in OCaml
(the <tt>rec</tt> indicates a recursive definition):
<pre class="code">
let rec extend1 start len soln =
      if (len == 64)
      then
        if List.mem start (moves (List.hd l))
        then soln
        else []
      else
        do_until (fun b -&gt; extend1 start (len+1) (b::soln))
                 (sortedmoves soln);;

let extend start = extend1 start 1 [start];;
</pre>where <tt>do_until</tt> applies a function to a list until it produces an answer
or is empty:
<pre class="code">
let rec do_until f = function
      | [] -&gt; []
      | h::t -&gt; match f h with
                | [] -&gt; do_until f t
                | answer -&gt; answer;;
</pre>The <code>|</code> is used to introduce a pattern to match.

<p> As before we need to define the functions that will produce the list
of available moves.
<pre class="code">
let knightsmoves = [(-1,-2); (-2,-1); (1,-2); (-2,1);
                   (-1,2); (2,-1); (1,2); (2,1)];;

let add (a,b) (c,d) = (a+c,b+d);;
 
let onboard (a,b) =
 (a &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (a &lt; 8) &amp;&amp;
 (b &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (b &lt; 8);;

let moves pos =
     List.filter (onboard)
                 (List.map (add pos) knightsmoves);;

let filmoves pos soln = 
     List.filter (fun b -&gt; not (List.mem b soln)) (moves pos);;

let compval soln pos1 pos2 =
     (List.length (filmoves pos1 soln)) -
      (List.length (filmoves pos2 soln));;

let sortedmoves soln =
     List.sort (compval soln)
               (filmoves (List.hd soln) (List.tl soln));;
</pre>As you can see the ``pattern matching''-way of defining things in OCaml
really simplifies definitions.

<p> We can string all these together - with the caveat that one
<em>must</em> define a term before using it. So the later definitions have
to come before the earlier ones. Programming languages which require
declarations to come in order are best programmed ``bottom-up'' unless one
can sort out all the details in one's head before putting a finger to the
keyboard.

<p> Now one can run the program by entering the interpreted mode of OCaml
<pre class="code">
      $ ocaml
       Objective Caml version 3.08.2

      # #use "knights.ml";;
      val knightsmoves : (int * int) list =
      [(-1, -2); (-2, -1); (1, -2); (-2, 1); (-1, 2); (2, -1); (1, 2);
      (2, 1)]
      val add : int * int -&gt; int * int -&gt; int * int = &lt;fun&gt;
      val onboard : int * int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
      val moves : int * int -&gt; (int * int) list = &lt;fun&gt;
      val filmoves : int * int -&gt; (int * int) list -&gt; (int * int) list
      = &lt;fun&gt;
      val compval : (int * int) list -&gt; int * int -&gt; int * int -&gt; int =
      &lt;fun&gt;
      val sortedmoves : (int * int) list -&gt; (int * int) list = &lt;fun&gt;
      val do_until : ('a -&gt; 'b list) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'b list = &lt;fun&gt;
      val extend1 : int * int -&gt; int -&gt; (int * int) list -&gt; (int * int)
      list = &lt;fun&gt;
      val extend : int * int -&gt; (int * int) list = &lt;fun&gt;
      # extend (0,0)
</pre>But then the system goes to sleep as before .... The whole reason
for trying OCaml was to compile the code in the hope of a faster
response! So we need to run the native code compiler.

<p> Before we do that however we need to have some way to do input and
output, so a little more programming is involved. Our program
produces output as a list of moves in order, what we want to output
is the position of each square in this list. Since output happens
only once we don't need to be particularly efficient.
<pre class="code">
let rec indexadd n pos soln =
      match (List.hd soln) with
      | pos -&gt; n
      | _   -&gt; indexadd (n-1) pos (List.tl soln);;

let index pos soln = indexadd 64 pos soln;;

let printsoln soln =
      (* Print the top line *)
      for i = 1 to 8 do
            Printf.printf "-----";
      done;
      Printf.printf "-\n";

      for i = 0 to 7 do
            for j = 0 to 7 do
                  Printf.printf "| %2i " (index (i,j) soln);
            done;
            Printf.printf "|\n";
            (* Print a line below *)
            for j = 1 to 8 do
                  Printf.printf "-----";
            done;
            Printf.printf "-\n";
      done;;
</pre>Finally, the input procedure. For some strange reason OCaml uses <tt>!pointer</tt> to reference the contents - so the <code>!</code> sign below is not
a ``not''.
<pre class="code">
if (!Sys.interactive)
then
      (* If we are loaded in the interpreter do nothing *)
      ()
else
      if (Array.length Sys.argv) &gt; 2
      then
        print_soln
          (extend
             (int_of_string Sys.argv.(1), int_of_string Sys.argv.(2))
          )
      else
        Printf.printf "Usage: %s x y\n" (Sys.argv.(0));;
</pre>Now we are all set. The compilation
<pre class="code">
       $ ocamlopt -o knights knights.ml
</pre>produces a standalone program <tt>knights</tt>. So here goes
<pre class="code">
$ ./knights 0 0
</pre>...and nothing happens!

<p> Again, if you don't believe me, or you believe your computer is faster,
you can <a href="misc/kapil/knights.ml.txt">download</a> the OCaml source, compile
it, and try it for yourself!

<p> 

<h2><a name="htoc3"></a>Denouement</h2>
<a name="denouement"></a>
Home for the day and I don't have OCaml on my home machine so I 
wrote the program afresh in Python. This time I felt too lazy to
type in the knights moves again so I added:
<pre class="code">
knightsmoves = [((-1)**y*(1+x), (-1)**z*(2-x)) \
                         for x in [0,1] \
                         for y in [0,1] \
                  for z in [0,1]]

</pre>When I ran the program again I got
<pre class="code">
         $ python
         Python 2.3.4 (#2, Sep 24 2004, 08:39:09)
         [GCC 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-12)] on linux2
         Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more
         information.
         &gt;&gt;&gt; from knights import *
  &gt;&gt;&gt; extend([(0,0)])
  [(2, 1), (0, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (6, 5),
  (7, 7), (5, 6), (3, 5), (1, 4), (3, 3),
  (5, 4), (4, 2), (3, 4), (4, 6), (2, 7),
  (0, 6), (2, 5), (0, 4), (1, 6), (3, 7),
  (4, 5), (5, 3), (6, 1), (7, 3), (5, 2),
  (4, 0), (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3), (2, 2),
  (1, 0), (3, 1), (5, 0), (7, 1), (6, 3),
  (7, 5), (6, 7), (5, 5), (7, 4), (6, 6),
  (4, 7), (2, 6), (0, 7), (1, 5), (0, 3),

  (4, 1), (6, 0), (7, 2), (6, 4), (7, 6),
  (5, 7), (3, 6), (1, 7), (0, 5), (1, 3),
  (0, 1), (2, 0), (1, 2), (0, 0)]
  &gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>Surprise! Here is a solution at last!

<p> At this point, a bell somewhere had gone ``dung''... and I wasn't sure
it was OCaml that did it---perhaps it was the prunes!

<p> Then my daughter came over and said she had followed the
algorithm <em>by hand</em> and come up with a solution. Her solution
started at the square (4,4) so I tried that with the <tt>knights</tt>
program compiled with OCaml.
<pre class="code">
$ ./knights 4 4
-----------------------------------------
|  9 |  6 | 11 | 44 | 27 |  4 | 29 | 34 |
-----------------------------------------
| 12 | 43 |  8 |  5 | 46 | 33 | 26 |  3 |
-----------------------------------------
|  7 | 10 | 45 | 48 | 55 | 28 | 35 | 30 |

-----------------------------------------
| 40 | 15 | 58 | 51 | 38 | 17 | 20 | 23 |
-----------------------------------------
</pre>I decided then to check the authoritative source via Google once
more. What it really says is that Warnsdorff's algorithm is for a
Hamiltonian <em>path</em>---a path that takes a knight through each
square exactly once---it is not necessary to return to the starting
square.

<p> What my experience with these programs shows is that Warnsdorff's
algorithm is <em>can</em> find a Hamiltonian <em>circuit</em> reasonably
quickly in <em>some</em> cases.
Perhaps unsurprisingly it's success depends on the order in
which one looks at the moves of the knights. For example, the above
Python code to generate <tt>knightsmoves</tt> actually gives
<pre class="code">
[(1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2), (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1)]
</pre>Perhaps a little more surprising (since the final solution is circular)
is the fact that the running time depends on the starting point. Indeed
I got running times of a few milliseconds, a few seconds and a few hours
(one process has been running for more than a couple of days!) for
different inputs to the same program!

<p> This may be rather typical of ``hard'' problems. There are a number
of ``cheap'' instances and a number of truly ``hard'' instances but
this distinction depends on where one starts---pure dumb luck decides
whether one can solve the problem or not. (Actually it appears that the
knights tour is not really a ``hard'' problem as one increases the
size of the board (see <a href="#better">Exercise 4</a>, just below).)


<h2><a name="htoc4"></a>Exercises</h2>

Here are some things that suggest themselves:
<ol type=1><li>
 	Try to find some real way to prove that the Python is
 		better than OCaml or vice versa. Or more generally
 		settle the great wars between functional and
 		procedural programming!
	<li>Try to randomize the choice from amongst the lowest
		valency vertices if there is more than one. This
		may result in shorter average times for all starting
		points.
	<li>Try to add an extra weight to ensure that vertices
 		further away from the start are taken up sooner than
 		other vertices of the same valency. Perhaps this will
 		be more efficient.
 	<li><a name="better"></a>There is apparently a better algorithm than
 		Warnsdorff's for the Hamiltonian circuit. Find it and
 		implement it.
</ol>

Kapil Hari Paranjape has been a ``hack''-er since his punch-card days.
Specifically, this means that he has never written a ``real'' program.
He has merely tinkered with programs written by others. After playing
with Minix in 1990-91 he thought of writing his first program---a
``genuine'' *nix kernel for the x86 class of machines. Luckily for him a
certain L. Torvalds got there first---thereby saving him the trouble
(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those
days---much to the dismay of many around him who think he should
concentrate on mathematical research---which is his paying job. The
interplay between actual running programs, what can be computed in
principle and what can be shown to exist continues to fascinate him.
