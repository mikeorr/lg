  Mark A. Horton (mah@netmha.com) passed away Friday September 7, 1996.
Cause currently unknown, but poor health is suspected. he did have a lot of
health problems, although he never let them keep him down long, in so many 
ways he was such an inspiration!
<P> 
  Having been through the rest of the *nixes, and knowing the subject well, 
he was one of the greatest proponents of Linux.  His enthusiasm and 
willingness to help anyone at any time were his greatest gifts to the Linux 
community.
<P> 
  His kindness, willingness to help others in many ways including Linux and 
his generosity will be missed by those of us that knew him and an example 
for all of us to strive for. For me personally, he was my best friend and 
mentor.  He taught myself and *MANY* others much about the nuts and bolts 
of Linux in a joyous way that was informative and instructive and often 
most pleasantly humorous.  Most any interaction with Mark was a good time.
<P> 
  Having spent a great many hours with him personally as well as on the 
phone, he made is very clear that he didn't want any morose happenings 
should anything ever happen to him, There will be a party by his friends to 
honor that request sometime in the near future.  Will plan on celebrating 
his contributions and the many wonderful things that there are to be 
remembered about him.  He was one of the true good guys and his joyous, 
creative, tenacious, encouraging spirit will be missed by those that knew 
him.  To the many that knew Mark and to the many who didn't, hoist one to 
one of the greats!  He will be missed.
<P> 
Thanks & Take care, Vikki.<BR>
