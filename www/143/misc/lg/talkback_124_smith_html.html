I just need to figure out which is easier:
</p>

<p>
- modifying a Live CD/DVD installation -- probably not the easiest to
change on the fly
or
- get a big enough flash drive to hold a reasonalbly functional
installation

Since you mention a live CD/DVD, I suppose you want a "run anywhere"
installation. There have been a number of LG articles on this
problem, for example:
<pre>
	LG 87 -- Sunil Thomas Thonikuzhiyil -- I Built a Custom Debian CD from Knoppix
	<a href="../../../87/sunil.html">http://linuxgazette.net/87/sunil.html</a>
	LG 113 -- Kapil Hari Paranjape -- Roll your Desktop into a USB stick/CD
	<a href="../../../113/kapil.html">http://linuxgazette.net/113/kapil.html</a>
</pre>
A different approach was also written up:
</p>

<pre>
	LG 140 -- Kapil Hari Paranjape -- Setting up an Encrypted Debian System
	<a href="../../../140/kapil.html">http://linuxgazette.net/140/kapil.html</a>
</pre>
Take a "standard" Debian installation which has the following
additional characteristics:
<pre>
	- starts the vesa frame buffer at boot time
	- uses the vesa frame buffer for X
	- uses DHCP for configuring the network
	- uses LVM and/or disk labels in /etc/fstab
</pre>
This kind of installation should work on 90% of hardware without
additional configuration. (Modulo Wi-Fi).
</p>

<p>
Install this on a USB hard disk as suggested in my article in (LG #140)
You can skip the encryption part if you like.
</p>

<p>
This will give you a run 90% of places installation with "permanence".
</p>

<p>

</p>

A quick look at the "Requirements" section of the article says "For six

completely.

The requirement is probably not separate cards, but separately addressable
display buffers -- My work laptop, a Lenovo T60  (running Win XP... work's
decision, not mine) supports dual displays -- different windows on the LCD
vs the back connector.

That's a reasonable distinction to make for theoretical purposes,
certainly - but in the case of using a laptop to "drive" six displays
and keyboards, one of the requirements is six video output connectors,
one per monitor. I don't know of any laptops that have such a thing - no
matter how many display buffers they have.

Now that you mention it, that might be very useful: a two-computer
network for not much more than the price of one might be quite appealing
to a number of people. E.g., you could essentially halve the amount of
money necessary to set up a small network, as long as pairs of these
"workstations" were close to each other. I wish I had the hardware and
the leisure to experiment with that... maybe one of our readers who has
the equipment and the enthusiasm will volunteer - and write an article
about the process. Shouldn't be very difficult...

And now that you keep mentioning it, I've seen some drivers in the
kernel's USB section that drive a VGA display via USB (one is for LCD
display AFAIK). More than one keyboard and mouse might probably
connected by using USB, too. This calls for some experiments and
probably volunteers. ;)
