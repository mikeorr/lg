A quick way to show current month's calendar is by executing "cal"
command. By default, it will show current month calendar.
</p>

<p>
Should you need to show calendar of certain month and year, simply
type it as parameter. For example:
<pre>
$ cal 1 1979
</pre>
will show you calendar of January 1979
</p>

<p>

'gcal' does the above plus much more:
</p>

<pre>
  Gcal displays  hybrid  and  proleptic  Julian  and  Gregorian  calendar
  sheets,  respectively, for one month, three months or a whole year.  It
  also displays eternal holiday  lists  for  many  countries  around  the
  globe,  and  features a very powerful creation of fixed date lists that
  can be used for reminding purposes.  Gcal can calculate various  astro‚Äê
  nomical  data  and  times  of  the Sun and the Moon for at pleasure any
  location, precisely enough for most civil purposes.  Gcal supports some
  other  calendar systems, for example the Chinese and Japanese calendar,
  the Hebrew calendar and the civil Islamic calendar, too.
 
  If Gcal is started without any options or commands, a calendar  of  the
  current month is displayed.
</pre>

<p>
One thing I've always liked about it is that today's date is
highlighted.
</p>

FWIW, that happens with plain "cal", too.

Interesting. As I recall, the reason that I started using 'gcal' over
'cal' is that, at the time, it was a distinct difference between the
two.

<p>
Yeah I remember that too. But now the only difference I see is gcal's 
current month is indented by a space, whereas cal is flush upto the left

</p>

<p>
I have tried to come to grips with the gcalrc configuration for 
diary/events etc. But I've found the documentation to be difficult and not 
always matching what actually happens. Of course it may just be me being 
thick. But if anyone knows of a good tutorial, I'd love to retry.

Unfortunately, I have to agree: gcal's documentation demonstrates the
pitfalls of the Unix "here-a-doc, there-a-doc, everywhere-a-doc" method
(this is, fortunately, a very rare case; most packages are nowhere
nearly this confusing.) The man page is misleadingly short, and the doc
directory (/usr/share/doc/gcal) is mind-bendingly irrelevant. I.e.,
unless you already know how the .gcalrc files work, you will <em>not</em> learn
it from there - and any hints on where to search for that information
have been carefully destroyed and their corpses buried in the deepest
forest at darkest midnight.
</p>

<p>
'info gcal' is - ta-daa! - full of stuff. And I mean FULL. After you
wade through a huge list of seemingly useless entries, you'll get to
juicy-sounding bits like "Resource file configuration"... only to find
out that you can't make any sense of it without <strong>all</strong> of the foregoing
(a mass of documentation read only by those for whom "War and Peace"
seemed too laconic and devoid of detail.)
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that the author had good intentions when writing all of that,
but between the hyper-verbose style, the scattered and fractured nature
of the docs, and his somewhat non-standard English, it's difficult to
say the least. Add in the fact that 'gcal' really is capable of some
unbelievably complicated stuff - i.e., requires tons of complex options
- and you're instantly swimming with the sharks.
</p>

<p>
Despite all of that, I still like it for the small subset of features
that I use.

Haha.  Of course.  The letter "g" does not stand for "generally known
locations for information", you know.  It stands for Gfree Gsoftware

And we love their "info" fixation.  We really do.

I'll admit, it took me a while to remember that I could look there -
even though I've been guilty of recommending it as an information source
in the past... despite the fact that it's used only by Venusians on
left-handed Tuesdays during riots caused by falling coffee prices. In
this one case, it was the right place to look - but only by accident.

And I'm really glad of the comments below (sorry for sort of top posting). 
I really did think it was just me not getting it. Good to know I'm not on 
my own.
