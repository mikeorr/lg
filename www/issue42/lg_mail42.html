Subject: <font color="navy">Any inetd wizards out there?</font>
<P>
I have been digging for the past several months to try and find any way
to bind inetd to one IP / interface.  I have a machine with several
virtual hosts, and had originally intended for only the main IP /
interface to respond to telnet, ftp, etc.  The virtuals would only
respond via httpd.  Unfortunatly, this doesn't seem to be the way it's
working - not only can I telnet / ftp to all addresses, it seems like
every inetd connection shows up on the LAST IP interface for some
reason.
<P>
I've looked thru manpages, NAG, websites, and while I know a lot more
than when I started looking, I was never able to solve this binding
problem.
<P>
Anyone have the answer?

Subject: <font color="navy">LILO Lock</font>
<P>
I have a Dell PII-450 with an STB4400 Riva TNT video board, 128M RAM.  I 
dual boot Windows (for the kids and some games) and RedHat5.2.  I use LILO
to 
handle the booting, with Windows being the default.  Occasionally, Windows
will 
lockup (big surprise), especially when playing more recent, graphics
intensive,  
games.  When this happens, a reset is required and the magic reset button is
<P>
pressed.  Most of the time, on the LILO screen, the boot locks, displaying
"LIX".  A 
second reset is required to get things moving again.
<P>
I'm looking for two things:
<P> 
1) Possible explanations for what would cause LILO to hang (I suspect the
video 
drivers, but I've tried the ones that shipped with the PC, the latest and
even the 
Detonator drivers from nVidia - no change in the frequency of lockups or the
LILO 
hang.
<P> 
2) Where can I find out what (if anything) LILO is trying to tell me by
displaying 
"LIX".  I have a feeling it's trying to tell me something useful, if I new
how to decode 
it.  And I would like to know the source of this information.  I have pretty
good luck 
find the answers myself, but this one has eluded me.
<P>
Other possible details: SB16 for sound, 13.6G IDE HD.

Hi, I wonder if anyone can help me out here with my
partitions. I have a P100 with 16RAM, i recently 
changed my HDD 'cause it died, i replaced it with a
6.4Gb WesternDigital HDD. When i was installing it
using EZ-Drive, the setup program detected that my
bios wasn't going to support large drives so it
installed EZ-Bios, EZ-Drive also partitioned the
drive into four partitions (right now one has win95
and the others are free).....when i tried to install
debian 1.3.1 the setup insisted in trying to go
through the partitioning process but it detected "bad
logical partitions".
<P>
What can i do to install linux in two of the existing
partitions without losing my data (i'd like to run
dual boot). One more thing, the D:, E: and F:
partitions have recycle bins and i can't get rid of
them even when formating them, what's going on here.

<P>
Question: How do I make a bootable OpenLinux 2.2 floppy?  I have Windows 
95 on my PC right now. I already installed OpenLinux 2.2 on my HDD.  I 
put Linux (Root & Swap) on my Second HDD - D: drive.  I did a Full 
install & works great.  But I can't seem to boot to the Linux anymore.
I boot straight to Windows 95 (with no problems).  I don't know if LILO
will work?  On my PC (Acer Open - P133) I have EZ-Drive installed in theDC
BIOS (my BIOS couldn't handle the 6.4MB WD HDD).  I've tried PM's
BootMagic, it won't work because of the EZ-Drive.  That's why I want to
know if it's possible to Boot to Linux from a Floppy?  I tried these 
methods from a Web Site:
<P> 
I have these 3 files in my C: root drive:<BR> 
-> Loadlin.exe<BR> 
-> Vmlinux<BR> 
-> Linux.bat (Below is what's inside of LINUX.BAT file)....<BR> 
<pre>
@echo off
cls
echo.
echo.

c:\windows\command\choice /t:y,5 "Do you wish to boot Linux?"
if errorlevel 2 goto End
c:\loadlin.exe c:\vmlinuz root=3D/dev/hdb4 ro
:End
</pre>
I also made this Boot Floppy (According to the Web Site) & it has these
2 files:<BR> 
-> autoexec.bat (Below is what's inside of AUTOEXEC.BAT file)....
<PRE> 
goto %config%
:win95=20

menudefault=3DLinux, 15

[linux]
shell=3Dc:\loadlin.exe c:\vmlinuz root=3D/dev/hdb4 ro

[win95]
</PRE> 
When I Do Boot With The Floppy In The A: Drive, I Receive This Error
Message:
<PRE>
Invalid System Disk
Replace The Disk, And Then Press Any Key
</pre>
I Take Out Floppy & It Boots To Windows 95.  Am I Doing Something Wrong
Here?  I Did Exactly What The Web Site Said To Do. I Know It's Something
In One OF These Files Or There All Wrong?  Or do you know a better
alternative?

Subject: <font color="navy">Conversation with Craig Burton</font>
<P>
I think Mr Burton has a lack of imagination on how Linux can take over
a lot of desktops.  He claims
<blockquote> <font color="navy">
	Windows growth would have to go to zero and Linux would have
	to grow exponentially for the next eight to ten years before
	it would even begin to gain on Microsoft. And until Linux is
	at 20% market share, no serious developer is going to give it
	any respect.
</font></blockquote> 
It might be so if the hundreds of millions of Windows PCs in use now
would still be in use eight to ten years from now.  But PCs will be
replaced several times during that period.  Each replacement is
another opportunity for Linux.
<P>
Most people use Windows for Office file compatibility and games.
StarOffice, ApplixWare, and Word Perfect already offer almost complete
Word compatibility, and games are beginning to appear.  In a year or
two, Linux will be reasonable for a majority of uses.  A few early
adaptors will smuggle Linux into offices, its viability will become
evident under practical conditions, and managers will realize they can
save money, downtime, and headaches by installing Linux.
<P>
Internet compatibility requirements, and resentment over expensive
upgrades, will prevent MS from force feeding many more incompatible
Office file format "upgrades".  Cheaper and cheaper hardware will make
the cost of MS software more apparent.  Just as MS Works was developed
as a cheaper alternative to Office, people will "settle" for Linux for
their kids.
<P>
Linux doesn't have to replace existing Windows machines.  It only has
to be a proven viable alternative when people replace old PCs.  Faced
with forced upgrades by MS's short sighted policies, people will
choose inexpensive compatible standards-friendly Linux over expensive
incompatible Redmond-protocols Microsft.

I use W98 for most of my essential tasks and also use it for "GAMES". I own a

<P>
HOWEVER i recently started to use Linux as an alternative operating system. 
It has a steep learning curve , ( at least for me, because I don't seem to 
own the hardware that it comes ready for and have had to hunt down drivers on 
the net, and also learn to install them properly.)
<P>
The current state of Linux reminds me of OS/2 when it first came out. I liked 
OS/2 (I had the 3.0 ). BUT . I stopped using it because there were very few 
(almost none) programs for OS/2 at the time. I considered it a superior OS to 
Windoze. It actually worked.But you had to learn how to make it work.
 <P> 
I will be really glad if Linux makes it in the market, Be assured that Bill 
Gates with all of his money is not going to let an Operating System that's 
essentially FREE take over his market share ( probably he thinks of it as his 
domain).
Good Luck Linux!!

<P>
I read an article in <I>Linux Gazette</I> about netled and the comment about not
prepending /dev/ to any of the command line arguments intrigued me so I
thought I'd look at the source code:
<P>
From netled.c:
<pre>
char tty[10] = "/dev/";
[snip]
strcat(tty,argv[1]);
if((ttyfd = open(tty,O_RDWR)) < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr,"Error opening keyboard %s\n ",tty); 
    exit(1);
}
[snip]
</PRE> 
<P>
I'm not an expert in these matters but this would appear to be prone to
a buffer-overflow/stack-smashing attack. The fact that it's part of
main() and not some subroutine might have some bearing on the matter as
I'm not too sure whether exit() will look for some sort of return
address on the stack (and no libc source handy to check) but either way
it looks like something that needs fixing ...
<P>
I'd recommend a
<PRE>
if (strlen(argv[1]) >= 5) {
	fprintf(stderr, "argument too long");
	exit (1);
}
</pre>
be added before the strcat. This is especially relevant since you recommend
running the program SUID root. Actually a size of 10 for tty is too low as a
size since you want argv[1] to be "console" ...
<P>
I've cc'ed the author of the article, linux-gazette too and one of the
security mailing lists maintainers who is probably far more
knowledgeable than me about stack overflows to shed some light on the
matter.
Thank you,
<P>

<P>
I wish to make a request to the editor of the LG and hope others in my
category will support me. I was prompted to do this after reading mail in
your journal. The letter in April <BR> 
From: "Michael J. Hammel", mjhammel@graphics-muse.org <BR> 
Subject: Re: a newbie's grief : Erik Refner & Clara Lundqvist: "<BR> 
is one such example.
(I must admit that in my debut I created a partition with FIPS and installed
RedHat Linux ver 2.1 on my PC in 1995 with only few problems. So it is not
THAT bad really..But I could not get my modem to work!)
<P>
Linux is more than a BIG OS for developers and programmers. It has a great
future for ordinary PC DESKTOP users like me. Many people in the world
cannot afford Microsoft software. The OS and their Offfice suite is very
expensive. The restrictions of a single PC means if you have more than one
PC the cost increases.
Linux is affordable. One copy of the latest version in a library can be
shared by many. In poorer countries this will be a great boon. People will
learn to manage with the free software that is there to use. Going on the
internet will be easy as Netscape, familiar to everyone is available. A
simple x-based email client allowing multiple users will be all that is
needed, as Netscape does not allow multiple addresses on the same PC.
Also viruses are not a problem in linux, as yet!!! :-)
I read in the news in lg that Corel was going to build a desktop PC version
for ordinary PC users in MAY lg news...
<P>
"Ottawa, Canada - April 21, 1999 - Corel Corporation (NASDAQ: COSFF, TSE:
COS) today announced an alliance with
two major Open Source developer communities to advance the development of
its proposed Linux distribution; a user-friendly
Linux installation and graphical user interface (GUI) for the desktop PC."
<P>
But this may be costly. In the April news there was some hope...
"Project Independence: Linux for the Masses,
http://independence.seul.org/distribution/ "
<P>
Therefore my request.
Could you please reserve a little section of your lg for simple desktop uses
of Linux, as opposed to programmers, LAN users, Server users etc.? News as
well as software reviews specially of value to us  could be great!
Thanks
<P>

Subject: <font color="navy">Re: KDE is bloated and slow (not</font>)
<P>
I keep hearing all this stuff about KDE is bloated, KDE is slow, KDE
put a nasty stain on my favorite T-shirt and I can't get it clean,
you get the idea....
<P>
I run Linux part-time on a Mac G3/266 (the beige box, "only" 32MB of
RAM), with KDE as my standard GUI, and I don't see what people are
complaining about.  Maybe I'd feel different if I had to run it on
a Pentium, or on a Mac IIsi running NetBSD or Linux-68k, but KDE
responds well to decent hardware. I recently updated from a beta
to 1.1, and it does feel a bit snappier.
<P>
I'll admit to shutting down X to compile large projects, but only
because of my current RAM limits. Once I add more RAM, I'll probably
change the runlevel to 5 and have X + KDE running all the time.
<P>
Besides, my wife would kill -9 me if I removed KDE -- she learned how
to boot into Linux & start X just so she can play kmahjongg and a couple
of the other games. This by itself is a reason to have KDE available;
you can spend a few minutes showing newbies a comfortable interface
and blunt the irrational fear of not-Windows.
<P>

Subject: <font color="navy">MTBF for Craig Burton</font>
<P>
Craig Burton said "Show me the MTBF figures"
<P>
I am used to a hardware background, where we calculate MTBF figures
before releasing systems. If nothing else, they give a rougth guide to
how many spares you need;-)
 <P> 
BUT, basicly speaking, this calculation is done by taking an MTBF figure
for each element (This type of component employed in this manner has
this MTBF), which are text book figures derived from statistical
analysis, and then you add them all together.
 <P> 
This means if system A has 10 widgets and 6 doofas, whilst system B has
15 widgets and 12 doofas, then system A will have a much lower MTBF.
<P>
It may seem a harsh way to calculate reliability, but generaly speaking
it works, and one always regards system reliability as being inversely
proportional to system complexity. Most of us are not able to review the
NT source, but it is believed to be far more complex than Linux, which
would suggest that the MTBF is proportionatlely lowwer.
<P>
Of course in software there are many other parameters, but nontheless
complexity is a major parameter. Another biggie is the language used for
development, C programming is far more vulnerable than higher level
languages for obscure bugs such as memory leaks, but for performance
reasons so low level languages are considered essential for OS work, and
so both have the same vulnerability (in fact one can easily find
disaster tales of e.g. memory leaks on both platforms).
<P>
Another major factor is using tried and trusted methods (or re-using
well proven code). Much of the reason for NT's additional complexity is
that it has to support so many MS invented protocols designed to render
it incompatible with the rest of the world. This is particularly so when
one get's out of kernel space into userland, Linux makes heavy (re)use
of legacy *nix software such as sendmail which has a very long history.
<P>
In a nutshell, there are sound scientific arguments as to why Linux may
be more relaible than NT, indeed one of Linus's rallying cries is to
keep things simple, and he resists attempts to over complicate the
kernel. MS (IMHO) appear to have tied themselves in knots with all thier
attempts to do things in a proprietry manner.
<P>
I think Craigs comments that imply that people who say Linux never goes
down are talking shit and are just Linux worshippers are a bit
excessive. Of course Linux does go down, but these people are just
reflecting a common appearence that Linux boxes do seem to go months
before re-boots (so one forgets when one last re-booted), wheras NT
reboots tend to be common enougth to be frustrating (...but we re-booted
just a couple of weeks ago). It is a subtle difference, but Linux by
being a little better appears to cross the memory threshold.
<P>
All I will add is that at work I use both a Linux and NT server, neither
are particularly loaded, and both are doing file and print sharing
(allthougth the Linux box does handle a mega printer which often has
100's of megabytes in the queue, it was moved from the NT box because it
did not work there). The Linux box has only ever gone down during power
outages (no UPS), whilst the NT box (which does has a UPS), has gone
down several times in the two year period I have been in this
environment. Note that the Linux server was just loaded and set up on
the fly by ourselves, whilst the NT box was set up, and is maintained,
by an outside firm with MS certified personel.
<P>
Am I a religious nut for pointing this out? 
<P>
I think Craigs comments that imply that people who say Linux never goes down are talking shit and are just Linux worshippers are a bit excessive.
