<h1>Linux Console Scrollback</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a></b></p>


<p>
We refer here to the GNU/Linux text console - which is not
what you have in a terminal window of a X windows manager
or desktop environment. There is so much confusion on this
point that I'm going to go into trivially-nitpicky detail: a text
console is what you get when you press 'Alt-Ctrl-F1' or 'F2'
and so on while the focus is on the desktop.
</p>


<h3>0. What are we talking about?</h3>

<p>
You are in a text console and text flies by. There is a way to recall it
and have a look by pressing 'Shift-PgUp' or 'Shift-PgDn' or possibly other
keys if you have modified the default keymap (no, not the X keymap.) You
are then using the <em>scrollback buffer</em> (scrollbuffer, for short.) 
</p>

<p>
When trying to put the scrollbuffer to good use, a couple
of things quickly become apparent:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>   only part of the boot messages can be recalled
    <li>   the file /var/log/messages catches a lot less of what
        you are looking for
</ul>

<p>
At this point, the web search starts and preliminary results
emerge:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>   scrollback issues are very old in Linux, they are
        traceable to the early 90s.
    <li>   You can forget everything published prior to kernel
        version 2.6.x.
</ul>

<p>
Indeed, you have to be selective with what you read: if you find any advice
prior to 2.6.x it is likely to confuse you and lead you astray.  Believe
me - I have put in the time so you don't have to.
</p>

<p>
The scrollback behaviour is determined in 'vc.c', a nasty little file in
the kernel source, where 'vc' stands for virtual console.
</p>

<p>
First, note that when you switch consoles, the scrollbuffer is
lost - so the entire size of the scrollbuffer is available for
the current console. (Here especially, there is a pile of
junk from pre-2.6.x times.)
</p>

<p>
The default scrollbuffer size is 32K. With that, you get 4 key presses -
each scrolling half a screen, 25 lines per screen. Figure it
out: that's about 50 lines. You will not get more than that,
even if you have 30 or 50 lines per screen.
</p>

<p>
However, 50 lines are just a small fraction of what flies
by at boot time. So two questions need to be answered:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>  How can the scrollbuffer be increased?
    <li>  Why are the log files not catching some of the messages
          you see at boot time?
</ol>


<h3>1. How can the scrollback buffer be increased?</h3>

<p>
One solution to (1) would be to change the default size in
the kernel source and recompile. Let me assume you are as
inclined to do so as I am (NOT) and would rather look for something
more flexible.
</p>

<p>
Well, there is a way - and it goes through a device called
framebuffer console, 'fbcon' for short. This device has a
documentation file by the name of 'fbcon.txt'; if you have
installed the kernel documentation, you have it. Sniff it out
somewhere in the '/usr/share' branch (I am not stating a path
because it may differ from distro to distro.) Anyway, you can
get it here as a single file:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt">http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/fb/fbcon.txt</a>
</p>

<p>
At this point, sorry: detour! We have <em>got</em> to talk briefly
about the framebuffer.
</p>

<p>
A framebuffer is a buffer between the display and the
graphic adapter. The beauty of it is that this buffer can
be manipulated: it allows for tricks that would be
impossible with the adapter acting directly on the display.
</p>

<p>
One of the tricks concerns the scrollbuffer; for instance,
you can tell the framebuffer to allocate more memory for it.
</p>

<p>
This is done via the kernel boot parameters. First, you request
a framebuffer; then you request a bigger scrollbuffer.
</p>

<p>
The following example refers to GRUB but can be easily
adapted to LILO. In GRUB's 'menu.lst', find the appropriate kernel line,
and:
</p>

<ol type="a">
<li> delete option 'vga=xxx', if present
<li> append option 'video=vesabf' or whatever fits your hardware
<li> append option 'fbcon=scrollback:128'
</ol>

<p>
The kernel line would then look something like the following;
</p>

<pre>
    kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/sdb5 video=radeonfb fbcon=scrollback:128
</pre>

<p>
Why are we deleting the option 'vga=xxx'? Because it may
conflict with the video option. On my ATI adapter, I cannot
change the scrollbuffer if 'vga=xxx' is present. This may not
apply in your case.
</p>

<p>
The options just listed do work but what if you want more
lines and a smaller font on the screen? You used to have that with
the 'vga=xxx' option - and that option is gone.
</p>

<p>
Take heart - it can still be done with fbcon parameters as detailed in
'fbcon.txt' (but not detailed here.) Under Ubuntu and Debian
there is a more comfortable way:
</p>

<pre>
    dpkg-reconfigure console-setup
</pre>

<p>
It makes sense to use this command because it also adjusts
the initial ram disk (initrd) to your new settings.
</p>


<h3>2. Pushing up the cap</h3>

<p>
The option 'fbcon=scrollback:128' gives you 12-13 key
presses to traverse the scrollbuffer. That is approx. 150
lines - quite a bit, but possibly still not enough to catch all
the boot messages. Can we say more than 128, e.g. 256?
</p>

<p>
The cap of 128 is set in 'vc.c'. If you want more, you can
edit it and recompile.
</p>

<p>
For myself, I decided that it is not worth it. Before that
I almost believed that I found a higher cap - I quote from
'fbcon.txt':
</p>

<pre>
    fbcon=scrollback:&lt;value&gt;[k]
    ...
        The 'k' suffix is optional, and will multiply
        the 'value' by 1024.
</pre>

<p>
I rushed to try it out... and whatever the author was thinking,
rest assured that 128 and 128k will give you exactly the same result.
The default cap is 128KB of memory and that's the end of it.
</p>

<p>
Finally, note that using an extended scrollbuffer implies writes
to both the graphic adapter hardware and the buffer in memory.
If you use the default of 32KB, there is only a write to the
hardware. In practice, I was unable to notice any slowdown.
</p>


<h3>3. What's missing in the logs?</h3>

<p>
In Ubuntu and Debian and other distros all system messages
are logged to the file '/var/log/messages'. This applies
even if the log service (daemon) is not the old syslog but
syslog-ng ('ng': "new generation").
</p>

<p>
In both cases, you can view the messages by issuing 'dmesg' at the command
prompt.  It still doesn't help, though: you saw messages at boot time and
they are certainly not in the log. How come?
</p>

<p>
It is a <strong>feature</strong>, not a bug! The messages logged to the
file come from various subsystems of the operating system. The contributing
subsystems are referred to as 'facilities', and there are 8 of them. If, at boot
time, scripts or applications are run that do not belong to any facility,
you will see their messages rushing past your eyes - but nothing will be
written to the log file!
</p>

<p>
As an example you will not see the messages produced by
'loadkeys' (openSUSE) or 'consolechars' (Ubuntu and Debian) when
loading keymaps at boot time. Another example: when
running a text console editor you can scroll back its
display (including colour) using the scrollbuffer but what the
editor produced will never go to the system log file. The
reason is, of course, that 'loadkeys', 'consolechars', and
the editor do not belong to any facility.
</p>

<p>
Can this be changed? Yes - "just" customize and recompile those
applications you want logged. And/or modify the boot
scripts. And force logging of messages outside the system
facilities.
</p>

<p>
My bet is you are not going to do it.
</p>

<p>
(And your most likely response is: "nothing is missing from <em>my</em> log files." Oh
well...)
