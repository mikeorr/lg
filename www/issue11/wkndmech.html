<font size="+4">Y</font>ou've made it to the weekend and things have finally slowed down.
You crawl outa bed, bag the shave 'n shower 'cause it's Saturday, grab
that much needed cup of caffeine (your favorite alkaloid), and shuffle
down the hall to the den.  It's time to fire up the Linux box, break out
the trusty 'ol Snap-On's, pop the hood, jack 'er up, and do a bit of
overhauling!

<h2><a name="welcome"><img src="../gx/fisk/attndant.gif" width=129 height=99> And 
Just What <i>Is</i> the Linux Weekend Mechanic...?</a></h2>

<p>
Glad you asked... :-)

<p>
After a very busy year creating, writing, editing, proofing, and producing the
first eight issues of the <b>Linux Gazette</b> I'm happy to say that it's been
turned over to the kind folks at the <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/">Linux
Journal</a> who will be continuing its production.  My special thanks to
<b>Phil Hughes</b>, the producer of the Linux Journal who first broached the
subject of taking over the Gazette when the time commitment was getting out of
hand, AND to <b>Marjorie Richardson</b>, the new editor of the Gazette whose
wit and wisdom should ensure that the LG will continue to flourish.

<p>
And now that someone else is doing the day to day management of the Gazette
I'm back to reading, writing, and tinkering -- and this is what the <b>Weekend
Mechanic</b> is all about.

<p>
I'd like to try to put together a monthly column for the Gazette that deals
with customizing and running Linux on a personal, stand-alone (<i>i.e.</i>,
not directly networked) PC.  The scope of topics may include things such as:

<ul>
	<li>Shell Programming
	<li>Shell Customizations
	<li>Program Reviews
	<li>Useful Utilities
	<li>Simple Tcl/Tk Scripting
	<li>Dial-Up PPP Setup and Tips
	<li>And so forth...
</ul>

<p>
Basically, it covers the topics that I've found interesting using Linux on my
PC at home -- I've got a shiny new Cyrix P-166+ machine as of August of this
year and have 'Net access via a dial-up PPP connection.  So, since I'm writing
from my own experiences, you can anticipate the types of topics I'd likely be
covering.  I should add one important proviso:  <i>Keep in mind that many of
the suggestions and ideas are NOT useful or recommended in a networked or
multi-user setting in which security is an issue!!</i>

<p>
Let me say this another way:

<p>
<i>Caveat Emptor!</i>

<p>
Because I have a stand alone box and a wife who absolutely hates using
computers I'm the only one that has physical access to my machine.  For this
reason, security is not something that I've had to deal with.  However, at
<a href="http://www.mtsu.edu/">MTSU</a>, where I'm currently in school, we use
both HP-UX machines and a number of P-133 machines running Red Hat 3.0.3 Linux
with the 2.0 kernel upgrade.  Security on these Linux boxes has been a VERY
REAL issue of late -- if you're running Linux and someone else has potential
access to your machine you'd be well advised to think twice before trying
everything I might suggest.  That's not to put a damper on anyone's
enthusiasm, but having one's system hacked is a serious bummer.

<p>
And now that that's been said, I really do hope that the information here will
be useful or helpful.  The more I use Linux the more I'm amazed at its depth
and breadth and the range of tools and programs that are available.  It is
seriously fun!  

<p>
For this reason, I've decided to use the &quot;Weekend Mechanic&quot; motif.
Thing is, if you're running Linux you've undoubtedly discovered that it takes
more time to set up, configure, and fine-tune than most shrink-wrapped OS's.
It's a &quot;high needs&quot; OS.  Now, you could use one of those
fancy-shmancy off-the-shelf Brand X OS's, but the question you have to ask
yourself is...

<p>
<i>Do you really want to be see hanging around an OS that looks like it comes
with training wheels...?!!</i>

<p>
I don't <i>think</i> so... ! ;-)

<p>
So, if you're one of those &quot;<i>I'd rather have a '68 Pontiac with a big
block V8, Rochester QuadraJet, Dualies, and a box of Snap-On's than anything
else&quot;</i> kind of folks...

<p>
<b>Relax, you're in the right place.  Welcome aboard :-)</b>

align=bottom>The Talk About Town...</a></h2>

<p>
For anyone who's been regularly reading the comp.os.linux.* hierarchy you'll
realize that there's been a LOT happening recently within the Linux community.
Here's just a smattering of some things that you might find interesting as
well as other odds-n-ends.

<p>
Oh, and BTW...

<p>
<img src="./gx/fisk/pumpkin1.gif" width=138 height=98 align=middle>
<font size="+4">Happy Halloween!</font>
<img src="./gx/fisk/pumpkin2.gif" width=119 height=94 align=middle>

<p>
And now, back to the news...

<p>


<h3><img src="../gx/text.gif" width=60 height=45 align=bottom>Caldera to
release source code for DR DOS, CP/M, Novell DOS, and PalmDOS</h3>

<p>
Yup, you read that right!

<p>
Caldera has <a href="http://www.caldera.com/news/">announced</a> that it is
in the process of a planned release of source code for DR DOS, CP/M, Novell DOS, 
and PalmDOS AND the beginning of a project which they are calling
<b>OpenDOS</b>.  The announcement stated a tentative date of the first quarter of
1997 for this to occur.  Drop by and have a look.  I think you'll find it
interesting.

<p>
If you've got the hard drive space and want to do a bit of hacking away at
something new, here's an interesting opportunity.



<h3><img src="../gx/text.gif" width=60 height=45 align=bottom>Did you know that
there's a &quot;FreeDOS&quot; Project underway...?</h3>

<p>
Yup, there's a group working on a freely available version of a DOS-like OS.
You can find out more on what they're doing, how to get a copy of the current
version, and how to contribute to this effort by checking out the 
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/freedos.html">FreeDOS
home page at sunsite.unc.edu/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/freedos.html</a>.

<p>
And speaking of new toys...



<h3><img src="../gx/text.gif" width=60 height=45 align=bottom>StarOffice and
Adobe beta software for Linux!</h3>

<p>
StarOffice, a German software developer, has recently announced a freely
available beta version of its <b>StarOffice</b> suite of productivity
applications for the Linux OS.  This is a seriously cool application suite
that has a LOT of high end features.  One caveat:  <b>you'll need a copy of
the Motif libraries</b> in order to run these applications.  If you don't have
motif, then you might want to try some gentle arm-twisting to see whether the
folks at StarOffice would release a statically-linked version.

<p>
For those of you with Motif, you can get the installation &quot;disk
sets&quot; at any sunsite mirror such as:

<p>
<a href="ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/linux/apps/staroffice/"> GA Tech's 
FTP Linux Archive</a>

<p>
in their /pub/linux/apps/staroffice/ directory.  Also, Adobe has just
announced a beta version of their <b>Adobe Acrobat 3.0</b> reader for
the Linux OS.  You can find out the particulars of how to obtain a copy
at:

<p>
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/readstep.html">ADOBE's WWW site
</a>

<p>
in their /acrobat/readstep.html page.  I just got a copy of this and the
installation was a breeze.  At least on my system, load time was about
what all motif-based apps tend to be (read: &quot;somewhat slow&quot;)
but performance thereafter was really quite good.

<p>
If you're interested in having a peek at a screen shot with one of the
distributed pages, here's a look at it:

<p>
<a href="./gx/fisk/acrobat.gif">ADOBE Acrobat 3.0 screen dump (~40K) 810x630</a>

<p>
Keep in mind that the official stance is that it is only supported under the
<b>Yggdrasil Fall '95</b> Linux distribution.  However, under my 'ol
<b>Slackware '96</b> it runs just fine...  Also, you'll notice the subtle
subliminal message in the titlebar... :-)

<p>
And speaking of distributions...


<h3><img src="../gx/text.gif" width=60 height=45 align=bottom>Slackware '96 is
out and Red Hat Rembrandt is on its way!</h3>

<p>
Now that the Linux kernel 2.0 is out and, for most folks, ELF is in, you'll
find a number of much-awaited distributions with the 2.0 kernel and necessary
development utilities.  If you've been waiting to upgrade then now's the time!

<p>
There is a growing number of very good Linux distributions available, many of
which now incorporate the recent kernel and development set upgrades.  I've
just installed Slackware '96 (<i>AKA</i> Slackware 3.1</i>) which I received
from the folks at

<p>
<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/">Walnut Creek</a>

<p>
who are the official distributors of Slackware Linux.  Since it was also my
birthday recently my wife just got me a copy of the August, 1996 Linux
Developer's Resource 6-CD Set from

<p>
<a href="http://www.infomagic.com/">InfoMagic</a>

<p>
Both of these are VERY nice sets that run in the $25 - $40 range and include a
boatload of program sources from the usual linux FTP archive sites
(sunsite.unc.edu, tsx-11.mit.edu, prep.ai.mit.edu, and so forth).  Those of
you who are on the monthly Mo' Linux mailing from

<p>
<a href="http://www.pht.com/">Pacific HiTech</a>

<p>
will have just gotten a copy of the Slackware '96 CD with the September
edition of Mo' Linux.  Pacific HiTech (PHT) has a VERY nice service which
offers a monthly CD full of all kinds of goodies including the most recent
kernel sources, new programs and updates from Sunsite's Incoming dir, the
latest GNU stuff including GCC and its accessories, and so forth.  They take
special requests and have recently included things such as the huge Perl
archives, Tcl/Tk archives, Python archives, the Java Development Kit (JDK),
and so forth.  Also, there are regular Red Hat RPM and SRPM updates each month
for those running Red Hat systems.

<p>
And keep in mind that Red Hat's Rembrandt just hit beta release!  This is their
kernel 2.0 version and should be ready for regular release soon!  You can get
a copy of Rembrandt beta at the

<p>
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat WWW site</a>

<p>
as well as find all kinds of nifty info and links in their &quot;Linux
Info&quot; page.

<p>
Since Christmas is just around the corner, I'm thinking about writing up a
small &quot;Wish List&quot; of tools and toys that you might want to put on
your Beloved's &quot;Get For Me List&quot;.  The small hoard of books and CD's
on the bookshelf is growing -- next month I'd like to do a short piece on
things that I've found useful.  *YMMV.

<p>
<font size="-2">*YMMV: &quot;Your Mileage May Vary&quot;</font>


<h3><img src="../gx/text.gif" width=60 height=45 align=bottom>Here's the patch
for the sysklog bug in Slackware '96</h3>

<p> Those of you who've just installed Slackware 3.1 may have run into
the same rather frustrating bug in the <b>sysklog</b> package that I
did.  After a recent installation, I found that syslogd would dump core
after running pppd.  About that time, postings to comp.os.linux.setup
and misc suggested that this was a problem with the distribution and not
with the hardware I was running.

<p>
So, after a request for help to <b>Dr. Greg Wettstein</b>, the maintainer of
the sysklog package, I received the following patch from him that remedied
the situation.  For those of you needing this, you can get a copy of the
message which Greg sent.  Just load it and save it to disk as a text file.
You'll also need a copy of the sysklog sources to recompile the program.
Here's what you'll need:

<p>
<a href="./misc/sysklog.patch">Sysklog patch from G. Wettstein (~70K)</a>

<p>
MANY thanks to Greg W. and the rest of the folks who've worked on this
program.


<p>
I mentioned in the above announcement about StarOffice that you'll need a copy
of the motif libraries to run this product (at least while it is distributed
as shared-library executables).  I really want to put in a good word for the
folks at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat Software Inc.</a> and for
their version of <b>Red Hat Motif 2.0</b>.

<p>
When I went to the <b>Linux Expo '96</b> this past April, I had a seriously
fun time meeting folks, chatting, perusing the various book and vendor tables,
and sitting in on the various talks.  If you missed it this past year and you
can drive, fly, Amtrak, run, jog, walk, or crawl your way to Raleigh, North
Carolina next Spring, then you won't want to miss it!!  I don't know for sure
if they're planning another Expo, but if so, you really don't want to miss it.

<p>
Anyway, while I was there I bought a copy of <b>Red Hat Motif 2.0</b> and have
been using it ever since.  Now, I know that one of the FAQ's to the various
comp.os.linux.**** groups is &quot;HELP! Which Motif should I get?!!&quot;, or
something to that effect.  There usually ensues a modestly impassioned
discussion about the merits and drawbacks of one's recent Motif purchase.

<p>
For the record, I'd like to say that I've been extraordinarily pleased with
this product.  It comes with a very complete User's Manual which covers
installation and configuring the Motif Window Manager (mwm).  The CD also
contains the Motif libraries, development tools, and documentation in both
*.tar.gz format and as RPM's.  

<p>
Installation was a breeze using rpm version 2.0 and I've been compiling motif
stuff without a hitch ever since.  This includes programs such as mosaic,
plan, llnlXFtp, llnlXDir, xtar, xmcalendar, xmdiary, XEmacs, GVim, and so
forth.  Compiling with the Motif libs has been completely transparent and
using shared, pre-compiled binaries (such as StarOffice) has been flawless.

<p>
At a time when there has been a LOT of negative press towards a variety of
individuals and institutions, let me offer a very heartfelt positive comment:

<p>
To the folks at Red Hat, thanks for a VERY nice product!

<p>
(FYI, I just got a copy of the most recent flyer from <b>Surplus Direct</b>, a
distributor of, you guessed it..., surplus hardware and software.  On page 17
of the flyer they offer the <b>Red Hat's MOTIF for LINUX V2.0 CD</b> for
$99.99.  Not a bad deal... :-)  You can call them at 1-800-753-7877 U.S. or
541-387-6000 International.  They even have a nifty web page which you can
check out at <a href="http://www.surplusdirect.com/">

<p>
OK, ready for a quiz...? Close your books, put away your notes, and answer the
following question:

<p>
Without looking at the <i>man</i> page, (a) What does the following command
do? and (b) Why on earth would you use it in the first place?

<pre>
	tar -tvzf file.tar.gz |tr -s ' ' |cut -d ' ' -f8 |less

Figured it out?

If you guessed that it uses <b>tar</b> to do an archive listing on a tar'd and

<p>
If you guessed that it uses <b>tar</b> to do an archive listing on a tar'd and

which would translate multiple instances of the space character into a single
space character, then you'd be even warmer.

all of that to the <b>less</b> pager so that you could view, search, edit, and
optionally print the output, then you, my friend get to...

<p>
<b>Go to the head of your class! :-)</b>

<p>
Actually, I wouldn't have been able to guess this without peeking a bit, so
don't feel bad if you didn't guess all of it correctly.  But this answer only
gives the answer to part (a).  The real question you have to ask yourself is,
&quot;Why on earth would you do this in the first place?&quot;

<p>
Good question.

<p>
I'll get to that in a moment, but first, let me ask a simple question:
&quot;How do you know what's actually inside a tar or tar+gzip archive
<i>without</i> actually unarchiving it?&quot;  Now, you can always unarchive a
tar.gz file and have a look at things but what if you really only wanted to
see what was in it or just look at a single file in the archive.  What do you
do then?

<p>
The answer lies, at least in part, with our funky little command line above.

<p>
Let's see what we can do with this.

<p>
The first thing you've all probably realized is that tar has a bazillion or so
command line arguments so you can do almost anything with it.  As you've
guessed, using the &quot;-t&quot; option displays a listing of the files in
the archive.  If the archive has been compressed, then using the
&quot;-z&quot; option will automatically uncompress the archive.

<p>
So far, so good.

<p>
Thing is, what you want to do is actually look at one of the files in that
archive.  Say you wanted to have a peek at the README file that came with some
program.  Seems silly to have to unarchive an entire (potentially HUGE) file
just to see one item.  Those of you who've used tar for a while will realize
where I'm going with this.  You see, another one of tar's nifty little options
is the &quot;-O&quot; (which can also be invoked as --to-stdout) which causes
tar to send the output directly to standard output:  generally, your computer
terminal.  This is what we need to use to get a look at some file in the
archive -- we'll have tar send it to stdout so we can view it.  That way, we
won't need to unarchive the file.

<p>
The other piece of the puzzle involves how you get tar to unarchive a specific
file within an archive.  Again, you manual page readers will know that this is
done by simply appending the filename(s) to the end of the argument.  Now in
case I'm starting to lose any of you, here's an example which should help
clear things up.

<p>
Say that I have some archive such as the <b>a2ps</b> program (which does ASCII
-&gt; PostScript conversion, BTW).  To get a listing of the files in the
archive all I have to do is:

<pre>
	tar -tvzf a2ps-4.5.23.src.tar.gz
</pre>

and this gives me the following output:

<pre>
drwxr-xr-x 11714/117         0 Sep  5 11:38 1996 a2ps-4.5.23/
-rw-r--r-- 11714/117      7721 Sep  5 11:38 1996 a2ps-4.5.23/INSTALL
-rw-r--r-- 11714/117      2281 Sep  5 11:38 1996 a2ps-4.5.23/README

-rwxr-xr-x 11714/117      4773 Sep  5 11:38 1996 a2ps-4.5.23/install-sh
-rw-r----- 11714/117      3576 Sep  5 11:38 1996 a2ps-4.5.23/Makefile.in

-rw-r--r-- 11714/117     10482 Sep  5 11:38 1996 a2ps-4.5.23/a2ps.man
</pre>

So now, let's say that I want to have a look at what's in the README or the
INSTALL file; well, now that you know that you send the output of tar to
stdout you know you're golden!  All you'd need to do is something like:

<pre>
	tar -xvzOf a2ps-4.5.23.src.tar.gz a2ps-4.5.23/README
</pre>

And, <i>voila!</i>, there's your file.  The astute will immediately comment
that piping <i>that</i> output to a pager such as <b>more</b> or <b>less</b>
makes a lot more sense because now you can actually read more than just the
last screen full of text.

<p>
Note, too, that the basic command line was (in <i>pseudocode</i>):

<pre>
	tar -options archive.tar.gz path/fileToView
</pre>

Notice that you have to include the &quot;a2ps-4.5.23/&quot; portion and NOT
just the name of the file.

<p>
So, now we're getting somewhere!

<p>
You can use the <kbd>tar -tvzf FILENAME.tar.gz</kbd> command line to get a
directory listing of a tar archive and then use something like:

<pre>
	tar -xvzOf a2ps-4.5.23.src.tar.gz a2ps-4.5.23/README |less
</pre>

to actually view the file -- the tar file is intact, nothing is unarchived to
disk, and you fingers never leave your hand!

<p>
And now, let's pick up on our original question once again.  Here's where that
funky little command line becomes useful to use once again.

<p>
Those of you who've done a bit of shell programming know that, fundamentally,
every programmer is lazy at heart.  That is to say, shell scripts are a VERY
convenient way of saving yourself the bother of typing the same commands over
and over again -- and this is one of those places where this is handy.

<p>
Now that you know how to view a file from within a tar file without ever
unarchiving the entire file, wouldn't it be handy to set up a shell script to
do just that...?

<p>
You know I wouldn't have asked this if I didn't already have an answer in
mind... eh?

<p>
Well, this is one of those things that I've started toying around with in the
past couple days and while I haven't gotten anything written yet, that nifty
little tar command at the top is part of the solution.  You see, it would be
quite handy to be able to do a listing of a tar archive, select one or more of
the files, and then view them.  The thing is, as I mentioned before, you have
to give tar the full name of the file you wish to view -- including any path
information.  That is, if you'd tried to do:

<pre>
	tar -xvzOf a2ps-4.5.23.src.tar.gz README |less
</pre>

you'd have gotten an error message because there's no README file in the
archive -- there <i>is</i> the file a2ps-4.5.23/README.  See the difference?
You have to have the a2ps-4.5.23/ prefix for tar to work correctly.

<p>
So, can you think of a way to take the output of tar -- the file listing --
and generate a listing of just the filenames which you can pass back to tar.
Again, remember that it has to include the entire path+name but cannot be the
entire line, such as:

<pre>
-rw-r--r-- 11714/117      2281 Sep  5 11:38 1996 a2ps-4.5.23/README
</pre>

Somehow, we've got to strip away all the leading stuff and get only to the
a2ps-4.5.23/README entry.  So let's cut to the chase.

<p>
One way to do this is using the method I mentioned above:  using tar with the
&quot;-t&quot; option displays a file listing.  Next, you can use <b>cut</b>
to access a single a column of data because, as you've all noticed, there are
8 fields of information in the above listing:

<pre>
PERMISSIONS GROUP/USER SIZE MONTH DAY HR:MIN YEAR PATH/FILENAME
</pre>

Now, you'll also notice that these are separated by a space and so you should
be able to use this as a field separator.  But if you try something like:

<pre>
	tar -tvzf a2ps-4.5.23.src.tar.gz |cut -d ' ' -f8
</pre>

what you end up with is:

<pre>
7721
2281
1429
4773
3576

Sep
1415
Sep
Sep
Sep
Sep
</pre>

So what went wrong!?

<p>
Well, we used a space character as the field delimiter which was the correct
thing to do.  But have a look at the actual file listing.  Notice that there
is a single space between <i>most</i>, but not all, of the fields.  Between
the group/user field and the size field there is a variable number of spaces
and there appears to be two spaces between SEP and 5.  So, <b>cut</b>
dutifully used a single space character as the field separator, but the
result wasn't' what we expected.

<p>
Hmmm... now what...?

<p>
Well, there's another little mentioned but VERY useful utility called
<b>tr</b>.  It's a seriously handy little item that does, among other things,
character translation.  In this case, we can use it to <i>truncate</i> a
series of one or more spaces into a single space (and THEN, cut should work
correctly!).

<p>
Now, is the light dawning? :-)

<p>
We use tar to get the file listing, tr to truncate all the extraneous spaces
into a single space character, and then pipe the whole thing through cut to
get just the fields that we want.  Doing this on the a2ps file, we get:

<pre>
a2ps-4.5.23/
a2ps-4.5.23/INSTALL
a2ps-4.5.23/README
a2ps-4.5.23/TODO
a2ps-4.5.23/install-sh
a2ps-4.5.23/Makefile.in
a2ps-4.5.23/config.h.in
a2ps-4.5.23/configure
a2ps-4.5.23/configure.in
a2ps-4.5.23/a2ps.c
a2ps-4.5.23/a2ps.h
a2ps-4.5.23/afm.h
a2ps-4.5.23/a2ps.man
</pre>

<p>
Pretty slick, eh?

<p>
Now, we can pick any of these entries and if we pass them to tar using the
&quot;-O&quot; option then the file gets printed to stdout.  Pipe this output
to <b>less</b> and we're golden!

<p>
A tar file viewer!

<p>
So why mention all of this?

<p>
Well, first, because I'm toying around with ideas for a shell script that will
do just this -- write a small program that will let me view individual files
from a tar.gz archive.  I've got a couple ideas floating around and may try
using the <b>dialog</b> program for a console UI, or I might just go ahead and
try this using tcl/tk.  

<p>
Second, I do this to point out one of the beauties of using Linux (or any UNIX
type OS) and that is the use of pipes to connect any number of the myriad of
utilities together into a powerful command.  Using four programs and a bunch of
pipes, we've seen how we can easily ready any file within a tar archive
without having to uncompress the entire thing.

<p>
That is seriously cool!

<p>
Anyway, I've just started playing with this.  Let me quickly mention, for
those of you who already know and are waving your cyberhands in the air, that
there <i>is</i> a very easy way to manipulate tar.gz files already -- and it's
with a program that MOST Linux distributions already install:  <b>Midnight
Commander</b>.

<p>
I cannot say enough good things about this program.  I'm honestly not much of
a file manager type user -- I really do prefer the command line for most file
and directory operations.  But, mc is different.  I have absolutely fallen in
love with this.  It's very well designed, is quite mature, has a boatload of
nifty features, AND it'll let you easily view and copy files from a tar.gz
archive using its VFS (virtual file system).  

<p>
I've been wanting to do a write up on MC now for, quite literally, months and
just haven't had the time to write a decent article -- one that really does it
justice.  Anyway, for those of you who are interested, all you have to do to
access a tar.gz file is fire up mc, select the tar.gz file and either double
click on it (if you're running gpm and have mouse support) or hit RETURN and
it'll automatically unarchive the file into a VFS from which you can browse
the archive just as though it were installed on your harddrive.

<p>
The other application that'll let you do this is the <b>xtar</b> program -- a
motif based app that I recently came across at the ftp.x.org archive.  I
honestly haven't seen this at sunsite or tsx-11 and I don't know that I've
seen it any of the usual Linux distributions either.  It's a VERY nice little
app that let's you browse and view tar.gz archives.

<p>
Anyway, try out mc or xtar if you want tar.gz browsing right now.  But, let's
see if we can't figure out a way to do something like this using shell
scripting or tcl/tk.  I'll let the interested work on this and, if I have any
successes myself, I'll write this up in next month's issue.

<p>
Til then, Happy Scripting!

<h2><a name="fileinfo"><img src="../gx/fisk/toolchest.gif" width=122 height=97
align=bottom>Basic File Information</a></h2>

<p>
OK, quick question:

<p>
Can you name 5 tools or utilities which you can use to get information about a
file?

<p>
I'm sure you can if you give it a bit of thought.  You see, most of the time,
if you've installed a system yourself then you have a pretty good idea about
what's on it and (hopefully...) where things are.  But what if you come across
a cryptically named file (Hmmm... fancy that on a UNIX system... :-) in your
/usr/bin directory and want to get a bit of information about it.  Or, what if
you know what it is that you're looking for, but just can't find it!

<p>
Ok, so let's talk about a couple tools you can work with to get basic file
information.

<p>
The one's that I was thinking about included:

<b>
<ul>
	<li>ls
	<li>file
	<li>type &amp; which
	<li>find &amp; locate
	<li>ldd
</ul>
</b>

<p>
Now, there are others, I'm sure, but these five basic utilities (seven if
you count similar ones) will go quite a ways towards helping you get a handle
on what's on your system.

<h3>A look at <i>ls</i></h3>

<p>
Anyone's who's used Linux for more than..., Hmmm... about a day or so, has run
across <b>ls</b> which does a directory listing.  And, if you've ventured a
peek at its manual page, your first reaction may have been one of incredulity
at the bewildering number of command line options.  Fear not.  You really only
need a couple of these on a routine basis (these are your friends) and the
rest of these let you do all kinds of groovy and interesting things when you
have nothing else to do but play with your directory listings (these are you
great Aunt Fanny's half-sister's double cousin, twice removed... you know
they're around, you just have no earthly idea as to what they do).

<p>
So, you know that if you want to get basic information about a file, then the
best place to start is with a directory listing.  Using the &quot;-l&quot;
option gives you a <b>long</b> listing which includes the file type (regular,
directory, fifo, block, and so forth), number of hard links, user name, group
name, size in bytes, timestamp (generally, the modification time), and the
file name itself.

<p>
You also know, I'm sure, that adding the &quot;-a&quot; displays <b>all</b>
files, including all the so-called dot-files which begin with a period (.) and
which are normally not displayed in a directory listing.

<p>
Many Linux distributions also configure ls to use the &quot;-F&quot; option
which print a suffix after each file to indicate what its basic type is:

<ul>
	<li>&quot;*&quot; for regular files which are executable
	<li>&quot;/&quot; for directories
	<li>&quot;@&quot; for symbolic links (&quot;symlinks&quot;)
	<li>&quot;|&quot; for FIFO's (&quot;pipes&quot; or &quot;First In
		First Out&quot;)
	<li>&quot;=&quot; for sockets
	<li> nothing for regular files
</ul>

<p>
So, just using humble 'ol ls can give you quite a bit of information about
your files.  A couple of the more useful things that you can do with ls
include using the &quot;-t&quot; option which sorts the directory contents by
time.  This is very useful if you happen to be in a directory such as /usr/bin
that has a LOT of files and you're looking for something which you've recently
added but can't recall the name.  Using &quot;ls -lt&quot; causes all the
newest files to, as it were, rise to the top of the list.  If, however, you
want to list the latest files <i>last</i>, no problem, mon, just add the
&quot;-r&quot; option to the soup and you'll get a <b>reversed</b> listing by
time (<i>i.e.</i>, &quot;ls -ltr&quot;).

<p>
Yet another handy little option will let you find out when a file's
<i>status</i> was last changed.  The status includes things such as owner or
group information or permissions.  You can change these things without
actually modifying the file itself.  Generally, the time stamp indicates when
a file was last modified, but if what you want to see is when a file's
<i>status</i> was last changed, then use the &quot;-c&quot; option.  Now, if
you're wondering whether permissions or user/group information has been
changed recently, then use &quot;ls -ltrc&quot; command to display the files
which have changed status most recently at the end of the listing.

<p>
Those are just a few of the things that you can do with ls.  So, if you're
stuck at home on some rainy Saturday afternoon and are tired of the <i>Laverne
And Shirley</i> reruns, go amuse yourself -- read the ls manual page, write
down all the options, and try them all out.  At least there won't be
commercial interruptions... :-)

<h3>Using <i>file</i></h3>

<p>
Besides using <i>ls</i> with the &quot;-F&quot; option, there's another very
handy utility called <b>file</b> which gives you a indication of what a file
actually is.

<p>
Every now and then, someone posts a message to one of the comp.os.linux groups
asking about how they can determine whether a file is a.out or ELF (or
something else, for that matter).  If you really do have a mysterious file,
then <b>file</b> is the utility for you.

<p>
So, let's say that you've come across a file in your /usr/local/bin directory
called &quot;d2utxt&quot; and it beats the pants off of you what this thing
is.  Well, you could try something like:

<pre>
	file /usr/local/bin/d2utxt
</pre>

I've actually got that file on my system and when I run this (from within VIM
of course -- notice that my fingers never leave my hand... :-) I get:

<pre>
/usr/local/bin/d2utxt: Linux/i386 executable or impure executable (OMAGIC)
</pre>

OK, that lets me know that it's some kind of executable.  So is it ELF or not?
Well, let's run this on a file which I know is ELF and see what happens:

<pre>
	file /usr/bin/vi
	/usr/bin/vim: ELF 32-bit LSB executable i386 (386 and up) Version 1
</pre>

So, there's your answer!  It seems that the d2utxt program was, in fact, a.out
format and vim is in our now familiar ELF format.  So, if you're wondering
what kind of executable format a file is in, this is your solution.  And keep
in mind that <b>file</b> recognizes a LOT more than simply executables.  As an
exercise, try running it on a plain text file, a shell script, a *.dvi file, a
postscript file, a shared library file, and so forth.  I won't go into the
specifics of how file works its magic (no pun intended... honest!) but if
you're interested, the manual page gives those details.

<blockquote>

	<p><img src="./gx/fisk/droplite.gif" width=36 height=93 align=bottom>
	Keep in mind that the <b>file</b> utility is a VERY useful tool to
	have at your disposal when you're writing shell programs that depend
	on knowing what a file's type is.

	<p>
	For example, suppose that you decide to write a shell script to
	automate file printing.  One of the things that your script will need
	to know is what type of file you are working with.  Tex, DVI,
	PostScript, and plain text files get printed using quite different
	programs.  Here's an ideal situation in which the <b>file</b> program
	will give you that information.

	<p>
	Again, convince yourself of this by running file against several
	different file formats -- pretty impressive, eh?

</blockquote>

<h3>Finding Executables with <i>type &amp; which</i></h3>

<p>
The next bit of information about a file that can often be quite useful is
a rather simple one:  &quot;Where is it??!!&quot;

<p>
If you're trying to find an executable then this task is greatly eased by use
of either <b>which</b> or <b>type</b> (if you're using the BASH shell).
Either one of these will print the path to a give executable -- assuming, that
is, that it is in your PATH statement.  So, let's say that you wanted to find
out where xdvi was located.  Now, you could probably guess, but let's just say
that you really were clueless and wanted to know.  Well, if you tried
something like the following you could find out:

<pre>
	which xdvi
	/usr/X11/bin/xdvi

	type xdvi
	xdvi is /usr/X11/bin/xdvi
</pre>

Hmmm... that was pretty easy now, wasn't it?  Both of these found our file in
the /usr/X11/bin/ directory and the output was pretty similar.  But before we
call this an even draw, suppose that you try to do something like this:

<pre>
	type tarx
	tarx is aliased to `tar -xvzf'

	type exec
	exec is a shell builtin
</pre>

Hmmm... interesting.

<p>
I won't give you the output that happens when I run <b>which</b> on either of
these because what happens is it prints an error message that states that it
couldn't find it in... and then prints the <i>entire</i> search PATH.  I'll
let you try this one at home.  Suffice it to say that if you're running the
BASH shell, then using <b>type</b> gives you the added benefit of recognizing
shell aliases and builtins in addition to executables.

<p>
Very handy.

<p>
Another useful little item that <b>type</b> can do for you is find
<i>duplicate</i> executables.  Now before you go scoffing, consider the fact
that it is VERY easy to do a bit of &quot;Do-It-Yourself&quot; system
upgrading and install a few programs.  If you don't know that the program
which you are installing has already been installed (but in a different
directory) then you end up with two copies.  So which one gets executed?

<p>
Good question.

<p>
Presuming that you don't use absolute path names for executables
(<i>e.g.</i>/usr/bin/vim) every time you want to start a program, then
whichever executable is found first in your PATH statement.  So, if you have
two copies of <b>elvis</b> (one from an original installation and one from a
new compile and install) then the one that is found first is executed.  

<p>
And how, do you suppose, I know this...?

<p>
Believe me, I've done it :-)

<p>
And the results can be impressively frustrating.

<p>
Specifically, I had upgraded a version of Tcl/Tk a while back and when I ran
all my favorite tcl/tk apps I started getting weird messages about version
incompatibilities and so forth.  So I recompiled and reinstalled and
<i>still</i> got those annoying error messages.  It was driving me crazy.
Finally, I tried running <b>type</b> and noticed that the <b>wish</b>
executable wasn't where I thought I'd installed it.  The breakthrough came when
I tried:

<pre>
	type -a wish
	wish is /usr/local/bin/wish
	wish is /usr/bin/wish
</pre>

Ah Ha!!

<p>
You see, there had been an old copy of a previous version lying around and I
had simply forgotten to delete/rename it.  The old version was being found
first but it was incompatible with the tcl scripts I was using.  Renaming the
old version cleared things up.

<p>
So the moral of the story is that if want to ensure that you have only one
copy of a program in the search PATH, then use <kbd>type -a</kbd>.

<h3>Finding Files with <i>find &amp; locate</i></h3>

<p>
OK, so now you know how to find executables... what if what you're looking for
is NOT an executable?  What then?

<p>
Well, these next two utilities deserve an entire article (and, in fact, got
just that in one of the recent issues of the <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/">
Linux Journal</a>.  Both <b>find</b> and <b>locate</b> will allow you to
search anywhere in your system for a given file.  For the time being, I'm
going to use a simple example.

<p>
Suppose that I'm looking for a certain configuration file for the <b>lynx</b>
program.  I've discovered that lynx has a config file that will let me set
various options -- but I don't know where this is located except that I have
a hunch that it is somewhere in /usr/local/.  Great!  To find it, all we have
to do is:

<pre>
	find /usr/local -name lynx* -print
	/usr/local/bin/lynx
	/usr/local/lib/lynx
	/usr/local/lib/lynx/lynx.cfg
	/usr/local/lib/lynx/lynx.hlp
	/usr/local/lib/lynx/lynx.man
	/usr/local/lib/lynx/lynx_help_main.html
	/usr/local/lib/lynx.cfg
	/usr/local/lib/lynx.cfg.color
	/usr/local/man/man1/lynx.1
	/usr/local/src/INSTALLED/lynx2-5FM.color.ELF.tgz
	/usr/local/src/Incoming/lynx2-6.tar.gz
	/usr/local/src/Incoming/lynx2-6.color.ELF.tgz
	/usr/local/doc/lynx
</pre>

Yow!  Bonanza!

<p>
So there we go... <b>find</b> not only located our lynx configuration file but
also found that there were duplicates!  Interesting :-)  So how do we do this
for <i>any</i> file?  Well, the basic pattern is:

<pre>
	find <directory> -name <pattern> -print
</pre>

That is, the first argument is the directory from which to START looking.
Find will automatically traverse all the subdirectories beneath this.  So, if
you wanted to scour your entire system, you just invoke find as:

<pre>
	find / -name lynx* -print
</pre>

<p>
The second argument is &quot;-name&quot; followed by the pattern of the file
name you're looking for.  And finally, the &quot;-print&quot; option specifies
that find should print the results to stdout.  Keep in mind, though, that the
GNU version of find doesn't need the &quot;-print&quot; option -- it defaults
to printing to standard out (your terminal :-).

<p>
The other handy-dandy little tool is <b>locate</b>.  If this has been set up
correctly (that is, that the database of files is routinely updated) then it
is a LOT faster to use than find if all you are looking for is a particular
file name!

<p>
To use it just invoke it as:

<pre>
	locate lynx

YIKES!!

<p>
On my system, this took about 1 second to display and it printed the location
of EVERY instance of &quot;lynx&quot;.  Now, for some reason which I haven't
figured out yet why this doesn't work the way the manual page indicates that
it should.  Maybe your system works better than mine... :-)

<p>
The way that it <i>should</i> work is that you give locate a filename
<i>pattern</i> which it searches for.  Such as:

<pre>
	locate lynx*
</pre>

<p>
However, when I tried this on my system, it simply returned nothing.  Using
<kbd>locate lynx</kbd> worked like a charm.

<p>
Got me.

<p>
Keep in mind, too, that <b>find</b> is a seriously powerful search tool that
has all kinds of options that let you do sophisticated searches.  You really
do need to check out the article that recently appeared in the Linux Journal.
I'm sorry that I can't recall offhand which issue it was in, but the LJ has
put a number of articles online on the Web and so you might try looking at
their <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/">web site</a> for information.

<h3>Finding Shared Library Information with <i>ldd</i></h3>

<p>
Finally, here's a nifty little trick that let's you see what shared libraries
a file is linked against.  If you've ever wondered whether a file was
statically or dynamically linked, then here's your answer!

<p>
Just invoke <b>ldd</b> with the name of the executable and it will print out a
listing of all the libraries that it is linked against AND where these
libraries are located on your system.

<p>
So, for example, running ldd against <b>gvim</b> (Graphical VIM), I get the
following output:

<pre>
	libXm.so.2 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXm.so.2
	libXt.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXt.so.6
	libSM.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libSM.so.6
	libICE.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libICE.so.6
	libXext.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXext.so.6
	libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.so.6
	libncurses.so.3.0 => /lib/libncurses.so.3.0
	libc.so.5 => /lib/libc.so.5.3.12
	libXpm.so.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so.4
</pre>

<p>
pretty nifty, eh?

<p>
Anyway, if you've ever picked up a pre-compiled binary and it just simply won't
execute, try running ldd against it to ensure that all the needed libraries
are being found.

<p>
So, that should do it!

<p>
I'm sure that there are many other tricks and means for prying information out
of an obscure file.  As a parting note, if you've ever wondered just exactly
what a file does then you can try a couple things.  The first is to see
whether there is a manual page for the program.  That's usually a good source
of information.  The other maneuver you can try is simply something like:

<pre>
	prog --help
</pre>

<p>
Presuming the program's name was &quot;prog&quot;, then frequently using a
command line option such as &quot;--help&quot; will print a help message.
Also, a number of programs will, if they don't recognize a command line
option, go ahead and print a short usage statement anyway.  If you're in the
dark, give it a whirl!
