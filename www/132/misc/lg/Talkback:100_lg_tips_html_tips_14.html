I recently read a tip you submitted to linuxgazette.net back in December
of 2003:
</p>

</p>


<p>
I'm using scponly for one of my users and recently he asked for the
public key to bypass password prompt. Did you create the user as normal
and then add them to scponly? Or did you add them using scponly's script
(setup_chroot.sh) first?

I just re-read Carol's original tip, and I'm not really clear on what
you're asking here (perhaps this is the reason for the general silence
in response. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Are you saying that your user wants you to add his
public key to his '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' so he can use 'scp' without
having to enter a password? This is usually a reasonable thing to do; in
fact, many sites use <em>only</em> pubkey-based authentication and disable
password-based access.
</p>

<p>
It's been a few years since I last used 'scponly', but I've just
refreshed my memory by re-reading the docs. If I've forgotten something,
I hope that someone here - or perhaps Carol - will correct me.
</p>

<p>
Building a chroot jail, or a group of them for multiple users, is in
general not a bad idea - although you need to decide whether your
situation warrants doing this, since it involves a bit of work. On the
other hand, the author of 'scponly' (Joe Boyle) has done a great job of
automating this often-complex process via a well-written shell script.
In any case, the answer to the question that I see implied in what
you've asked ("where do I put this public key if I do/don't have a
chroot jail configured?") is "whatever your top-level '/etc/passwd' has
as the user's home directory plus '/.ssh/authorized_keys'". That is, if
'/etc/passwd' for the user in question says
</p>

<p>
<pre>
foobar:x:1000:1001:Foobar Q. Zotz:/home/foobar:/usr/bin/scponly
</pre>
then the key goes into '/home/foobar/.ssh/authorized_keys'. If, however,
you've done the 'chroot' installation, then your '/etc/passwd' will look
more like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
foobar:x:1000:1001:Foobar Q. Zotz:/ALTROOT//home/foobar:/sbin/scponlyc
</pre>
where ALTROOT is the path to the top of your chroot tree. Note the '//',
above: 'scponlyc' uses those to determine the chroot point. In this
case, the key would be copied into
'/ALTROOT//home/foobar/.ssh/authorized_keys'.
</p>

<p>
In this latter case, by the way, do take note of the strongly-worded
warning in the 'scponly' documentation:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
	Unless you are !absolutely! sure of your sshd configuration, the
	users home directory should be empty and owned by root and not
	writeable by the user.
</pre>
This is a very good idea, and is part of the critical path to a secure
chroot jail.

Thanks for the response Ben,
</p>

<p>
I was able to accomplish what I needed by manually creating the .ssh
dir in the users home.
</p>

<p>
My problem was that I couldn't figure out where the .ssh dir existed
for an SCPONLY user. When I created the SCPONLY user using the supplied
script, it didn't create a .ssh in their home. I'm still not sure where
the ssh keys for an SCPONLY user are held.
</p>

<p>
After I added the .ssh dir their home and added their pub key to the
authorized_keys file, problem solved.
</p>

<p>
I really like SCPONLY, but wish their documentation was a bit more 
complete. Maybe I'll summarize what I learned and put it out on the
web....

<p>
As far as I know, no application does that; you have to create it
yourself, just as you mention doing.
</p>


<p>

In their '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' - exactly as I described.

<p>
Or you could always write an article for us. That's a way to get it out
on the Web <em>and</em> instantly publicized. If you're interested, take a look
at our Author Guide: '<a href="../../../faq/author.html">http://linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html</a>'.
