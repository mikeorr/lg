Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
One of my co-workers runs sco unixware 7.  Under X he can switch off
between the GUI and GUI by alt F1 F2 etc ... he can also startx in thos
terms if he wants. Can this be done under Linux right now.  If not is any
one working on it?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks

	>This is a fairly common source of confusion for new Linux users.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can use [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Fx] to do this using XFree86 (the
free X server for Linux, <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, 
etc).  I presume you could also remap your [Alt]+[Fx] keys to do it, 
probably using '<tt>xmodmap</tt>'
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can also use an '<tt>xterm</tt>' command, menu entry or icon
to do this --- using the '<tt>chvt</tt>' command that's included with
most distributions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: You can usually also "back out of" XFree86 using
[Ctrl]+[Alt]+[BackSpace].  This basically provides a "vulcan
nerve pinch" or "three finger salute" for the X windowing
system, without having to reset the rest of the OS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Speaking of "three finger salutes" there are some neat
options in the 2.1 kernels if you enable the "Magic SysRq"
option when you build you new kernels.  These give you
various commands using [Alt]+[SysRq/Print Screen]+? options.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For example you can use "Magic SysRq"+[s] to "Sync all
filesystems."  There are other combinations to restore you
keyboard from "raw" mode, kill all processes that are
attached to the current virtual console, remount your
filesystems in "read-only" mode, dump tasklists, and
register or memory status to your console, and to
set various signals to all processes below 'init.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These is supposed to work <em>no matter what else the kernel
is doing</em>.  You can read more about these in:
<tt>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/sysrq.txt</tt>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(It's a fairly obscure fact that the 2.0 kernels had
some similar console keyboard features.  You could
invoke register, memory, and task list dumps using
[Alt]+[ScrollLock], [Shift]+[ScrollLock], and [Ctrl]+[ScrollLock]
respectively).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition most versions of the Linux kernel (back to 1.2
or earlier) would allow you to use [Shift]+[PgUp] to view
a small backscroll buffer for the current VC.  This buffer
gets wiped on a virtual console switch (unlike the FreeBSD
[ScrollLock] feature which is maintained for every VC).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another key binding that many Linux users don't know about
is the [Alt]+[Left Cursor] and [Alt]+[Right Cursor] bindings,
which will cycle among your virtual consoles (VC's).  In
other words if you are on VC4 and you use [Alt]+[Left Cursor]
you'll be switched to VC3 while [Alt]+[Left Cursor] would
move you to VC5.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you reconfigure your system to provide logins on more
than 12 virtual consoles (just edit <TT>/etc/inittab</TT> in the
obvious way --- and make sure you have the corresponding
<TT>/dev/tty*</TT> nodes) --- you can get to the second "bank" of VCs
using the <EM>other</EM> [Alt] key (the right one).  If you had
more than 24 you'd presumably have to use the [Alt]+{cursor
keys} to get at them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course you can customize most of these to your heart's
content.  Look for the following man pages for
more details:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote><pre>		loadkeys (1)
		dumpkeys (1)
		showkey (1)
		keytables (5)
</pre></blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
... and look through the whole "kbd" package for '<tt>chvt</tt>'
and other commands.  There's also supposed to be an improved
set of console tools (the "console" package?) which should
be at Sunsite (<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux"
>http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux</A>) somewhere.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So you can customize your console's keyboard bindings without even having
to patch a kernel.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Incidentally, I get around the lack of real console
backscroll buffers by just running '<tt>screen</tt>' --- which also
allows me to detach my processes from one terminal and
re-attach to them in another.  This is very handy when I'm
working on a VC (as I usually do) and I need to look
something up in Netscape  --- if I think that Lynx just
isn't getting what I need.  I detach my '<tt>screen</tt>' session,
switch to my X session (which stays on VC13 for me, and
VC14 for my wife's session), then I re-attach from any
available 'xterm'  I can then cut and paste between my X
applications and the emacs that I've been running all along.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'screen' also give me keyboard driven cut-and-paste between
console/text/curses applications.  I personally prefer this
to '<tt>gpm</tt>' old 'selection' features --- though I tend to use
both occasionally.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, does that list of options block the sockets off of SCO?

Jim,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank You for the help - I don't care for sco, however that
co-worker kept coming at me w\ can it do this and that.  I was stumped on
this one.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks Again,

I figured.  About the only things the SCOldies can hold over
us right now are "journal file support" and "Tarantella."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Just  SCOld him with an observation that engineers from
SCO were making much ado about their recent addition of
Linux binary compability support --- the ability of SCO to
run Linux binaries; at last years USENIX in Louisiana.  Then
ask if Microsoft has sold off the last of their SCO stock
yet &lt;g&gt;.
