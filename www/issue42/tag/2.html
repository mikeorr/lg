Hi,

Got your email address from:

Wow!  Someone who actually tells me where their
they found me!  I've always thought that any e-mail
to someone you've never met should include some passing
reference of this sort.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, there are cases where it might be superfluous. If
you were to e-mail Linux Torvalds he'd have a pretty good
idea where you got his address; it's in the <TT>/usr/src/linux</TT>
tree on millions of computers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, linuxvalley.com looks like an interesting site ---
if you read Italian.  I've seen quotes of myself translated
into Italian, Portugese and a couple of other languages
--- it's amusing.  (I just feel sorry for the interpreters
--- any of you out there?  I owe you each a beer!).

Do you know of any websites with general hard drive info. More
specifically, and I'm quite happy just with a web page reference if you
like, I wonder if, like dos, unix requires executable code in the boot
sector, if it even has a boot sector. I've tried alta vista, but found
mostly junk. Thanks.

Well I don't know about general hard drive info.  Many
of the hard drive manufacturers put technical information
about their drives up on the web.  Of course you usually
have to hunt through quite alot of marketing fluff that
clogs many corporate sites to get to the good stuff.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I can answer the question regarding boot code.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The PC BIOS requires that your OS, any OS be loaded from
somewhere.  Your mainstream choices are: hard drive, floppy,
network and (most recently) CD-ROM.  There are some devices
which emulate drives (sold under names like "ROMDisk" et
al.).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When loading from a hard drive the BIOS loads the first
sector (512 bytes) on track zero.  This is called the
MBR.  It contains two parts: some boot loader code and
a partition table.  The partition table is in the last
66 bytes of the MBR.  Actually there are 4 primary
partition entries of 16 bytes each, and there's a
pair of "signature" bytes which indicate whether or not
the drive has ever been initialized.  The other 446 bytes
of the MBR contains the primary bootloader code.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As you mentioned, MS-DOS provides its own bootloader.  That
just looks for the active partition and loads a secondary
bootloader from the first sector of that partition.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
OS/2, NT, and the various PC implementations of UNIX each
provide their own bootloaders.  These load code from a
"boot manager" (usually a one track partition somewhere
on the primary drive).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Linux offers a number of alternatives for loading the
kernel.  The most common is to use the LILO package.  This
consists of a program, <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT>, that reads a
configuration file (<TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT>, by default), and builds
a set of primary and secondary boot blocks, and a set of
"maps"  and writes the primary boot code and the pointers
to the secondary blocks and maps into the MBR.  LILO is a
very flexible utility.  You can store information on
up to 16 different boot images, you can pass parameters to
the Linux kernel (which can set various boot time
options in the kernel, or be passed along to init, and
thence to the master environment and to the rc startup
scripts).  You can password restrict some or all of your
LILO boot stanzas, define messages to be displayed at
boot time, issue a command that sets an automatic "one time"
set of boot parameters (<TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> -R), etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another option is GRUB, the GNU "grand unified bootloader."
This is slated to be the bootloader for the GNU HURD (a free
microkernel based operating system which has been under
development since before Linus started on the Linux kernel).
I've heard that GRUB can be be used now with the HURD betas
and with Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One thing that's interesting about Linux, in contrast to
other operating systems, is that you can load it in
alternative ways.  So you can load the PC Linux kernel using
LOADLIN.EXE (an MS-DOS program) or directly from Win '9x
using the updated LinLoad '95 (??? derived from LOADLIN?).
So you can have copies of your kernel in any MS-DOS
directory and "run them" from MS-DOS. You can put a Linux
kernel straight on a floppy (starting at the first block
thereon) and it will be directly loaded.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can also use SYSLINUX to put a Linux kernel on an MS-DOS
formatted floppy and load it from there.  (If you mount up a
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> installation floppy you'll see a copy of the
SYSLINUX.CFG file that the SYSLINUX boot loader reads).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's also possible to load Linux over a network (given a
suitable bootp PROM, installed in a NIC, for example).
There is nothing to prevent a computer manufacturer from
installing a Linux kernel in their own ROMs --- loading it
with initrd (initialization RAM disk) support.  There are
some people doing this for "embedded" systems already (seems
to be primarily in specialized systems, not in commodity
PCs).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Igel has been making Linux based Xterminal/etherterminal
systems using "Disk on a Chip" drivers for
years. (<A HREF="http://www.igelusa.com"

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for finding "mostly junk" .... Yeah!  I get that,
too.  However, a big part of "The Answer Guy's" success
is that I sift through enough of that junk to (usually)
come up with what I'm looking for.  (Sometimes it's even
what my correspondents were asking about!)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I hope that helps.
