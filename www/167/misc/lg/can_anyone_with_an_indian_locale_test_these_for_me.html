Hi Jimmy,
</p>


<pre>
&gt; One of our users is complaining that our transliterator doesn't work;
&gt; the few of us who have tested it all find that it works for us. Now,
&gt; he says it only works because our locales are wrong(?). I'm just
&gt; wondering if anyone other than him can get the incorrect result: i.e.,
&gt; that 'ा' fails to transliterate to 'ા' -- I reproduced the same test
&gt; using standard tools belo, because they do the same thing as our
&gt; transliterator.
</pre>

<p>
Just saw this email, so tried it out on my system. This is what I got:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
suramya@Wyrm:/usr/lib/locale$ echo $LANG
en_IE.UTF-8
suramya@Wyrm:/usr/lib/locale$ echo राम|tr 'राम' 'રામ'
રામ
suramya@Wyrm:/usr/lib/locale$ echo राम|sed -e 's/र/ર/g'|sed -e 's/ा/ા/g' 
|sed -e 's/म/મ/g'
રામ
suramya@Wyrm:/usr/lib/locale$ echo राम|perl /home/suramya/Temp/test.pl
રામ
suramya@Wyrm:/usr/lib/locale$
</pre>

<p>
It seems to be working fine for me... Hope this helps.
</p>

Thanks. We got to the bottom of it eventually - I think I forwarded
the mail, after I saw this month's mailbag? - but in the end, the
problem was that in the i18n database, matras were incorrectly defined
as punctuation. Anyone who does experience the problem should probably
just upgrade their locales package.

I didn't see your mail that the problem was resolved. Glad you managed 
to get to work though.
