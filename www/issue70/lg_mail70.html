Many years ago, before the Web when terminals mattered a lot more, I
spent many hours combing through kernel code and experimenting to
figure out process groups, sessions, controlling terminals, job
control, SIGINT, SIGHUP, and the like. I could write a long article on
it, but I think it's really arcane information.

Hi,
</P>
<P>
I read the article written by Bryan Anderson in August 2001 Linux
Gazette titled 'Make your Virtual Console Log In Automatically'. The
last section about process groups and controlling terminal was too short
for me.
</p><p>
I would be happy if Bryan could write a technical article about this
subject as it's suggested by him and the editor.
I'm wondering his knowledge could help me.
</p><p>PS: my currently knowledge is based on a approxmilty reading of bash
source code and the GNU libc manual (info).

I just look at your issue 41 (I know that is not really recent ...) but
in the article of Christopher Lopes which is talking about CUP, there is
a mistake...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tested it and I see that it didn't walk correctly for all the cases. In
fact it is necessary to put a greater priority to the operator ' - ' if
not, we have 8-6+9 = -7 because your parsor realizes initially (6+9 = 15)
and after (8-15= -7). To solve this problem it is enough to create a
state between expr and factor which will represent the fact that the
operator - has priority than it +.

You do NOT want to give the minus operator a greater priority than the
plus operator, because then expressions like a+b-c would parse as a+(b-c),
which generally is not what you want.  (Algebraically, plus and minus are
usually given the same priority, so a+b-c means (a+b)-c.)
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In fact, giving the minus operator a higher priority in the CUP file
(using CUP's priority capability) will not change anything given the
grammar as written in the original article, since the grammar is
unambiguous with regard to plus and minus.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The problem is that the lines in the grammar
</STRONG></P>
<Pre>
expr ::= factor PLUS expr
       | factor MINUS expr
</Pre>
<P><STRONG>
cause the plus and minus operators to be right-associative, when we want
them to be left-associative.

<P><STRONG>
The fix is to changes the lines to be
</STRONG></P>
<Pre>
expr ::= expr PLUS factor
       | expr MINUS factor
</Pre>

This will make the grammar associate the plus and minus operators in the
usual way.

<P>
Michael is right...
The fix is just to transform the rules of expr for PLUS and MINUS become
left-associative. Thing which I had made in my preceding fix, but it's true
that to give a higher priority to MINUS is, in fact, totaly useless...

Why don't you just remove all  the  factor productions  (which is
clearly school boy junk ...)
and  leave nothing between  &lt;expressions&gt; and &lt;terms&gt; so that the
precedence directives
can  work freely, and there will be no problem :
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>

<P><STRONG>
precedence left MINUS, PLUS;
precedence left  TIMES, DIVIDE;

and

<Pre>
expr ::= term
       |  expr  MINUS expr
       |  expr  PLUS  expr
       |  expr   TIMES expr
       |  expr  DIVIDE expr

Generally the examples given along  with developement

<br>Reply from Ben Okopnik

<STRONG>
<P>
I was reading your article in the Linux Gazette about programming perl
and I have a little problem in a simple script.
This is the script that should open <TT>/var/log/messages</TT> and search for
some text:
</P>
<Pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict

open(MESS, "&lt;/var/log/messages") or die "Cannot open file: $!\n";
while(&lt;MESS&gt;) {
    print "$_\n" if /(fail|terminat(ed|ing)|no)/i;
}
close MESS;
</pre>
<P>
when I run the script the result is the following:
<p><code>
$ ./logs.pl
<br>syntax error at ./logs.pl line 4, near ") or"
<br>Execution of ./logs.pl aborted due to compilation errors.
</code></P>
<P>
Do you have a clue about what's going on?
</P>
<P>
I have a RedHat Linux with perl 5.6.0
</P>
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I believe I've actually mentioned this type of error in one of the
articles. It's a very deceptive one... and yet shared by <EM>all</EM> languages
that ignore whitespace, due to the way the parser has to look at the
code.
</P>
<P>
Look at line 4 carefully. Look at it again. Can't find anything wrong?
That's because there isn't anything. Instead, take a look at the
previous line of code, line 2 - it's missing a semicolon at the end!
When that happens, Perl figures that you simply continued your statement
further down - so, what it sees is
</P>
<P><tt>use strict open(MESS, "&lt;/var/log/messages")</tt></P>
<P>
at which point it realizes "Uh-oh. We've gone past anything that looks
like valid syntax for the 'use' function - PANIC TIME!"
</P>
<P>
The lack of a terminator on a previous line is always an error on the
<EM>current</EM> line.
</P>
