<h2>Petition to Cancel Filed Against Linux Trademark</h2>
</center>

<p>Members of the LINUX community have been up in arms during
the past six months over the efforts of an individual named William
R. Della Croce, Jr. from the Boston area to collect 10% royalties on
sales from businesses marketing Linux products.  He bases his written
demands on a US trademark which he claims to hold on the name
"LINUX" for a computer operating system.  He, in fact, holds such a
registered trademark, based on his claim made under penalty of
perjury that he is the owner and first user of the mark for operating
systems, and that he was not aware in 1994 or 1995 of any other
person who might claim or be using this name and mark for an
operating system.  This claim is absurd on its face.

<p>WorkGroup Solutions, Yggdrasil Computing, Linux International,
SSC/<I>Linux Journal</I>, and Linus
Torvalds have retained an internationally known software industry
attorney, G. Gervaise Davis III, of the Davis & Schroeder law firm
in Monterey, CA to seek cancelation of this registration on the
grounds that it is fraudulent and obtained under false pretenses. Mr. 
Davis and his firm are handling the case on a vastly reduced fee 
basis, because of their long standing relationship with the U.S. 
software industry.  Davis was the original attorney for Gary Kildall 
and Digital Research of CP/M fame in the 1980s.

<p>A Petition to Cancel was in fact filed with the Trademark Trial and
Appeals Board in Washington, DC. on November 27, 1996, detailing the
improper actions of Della Croce and setting out the true facts with
a number of exhibits and attachments.  Mr. Davis advises us that we
can expect to have further steps taken by TTAB, under their complex
procedural rules over the next few months.  TTAB will first notify
Della Croce of the filing and permit him time to respond, then
evidence can be collected and depositions taken, and then the
parties can file briefs and other responses.  Often these cases take
more than a  year to be resolved by a TTAB decision.

<p>All of our industry is fully aware that Linus Torvalds developed 
Linux and that it has become one of the world's most popular 
operating systems during the past six years. The participants in this 
proceeding expect the TTAB to cancel the registration, after hearing 
and seeing the massive evidence demonstrating that Della Croce had no 
conceivable legal basis for his claim to the mark.

<p>The petition itself was available on our website
and on 
the websites of each of the petitioners and Mr. Davis' law firm.
We urge that interested persons read it, and 
distribute it and this message to all members of the LINUX community 
so that they will be aware of what is being done about this 
outrageous trademark claim.  We will try to keep everyone posted on 
developments in the case through user groups and webpages.

<p>We will continue to keep you updated on the happenings in this action.
