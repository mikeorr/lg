<h1>Writing PostgreSQL Functions in C</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/peterson.html">Ron Peterson</a></b></p>

<h3 id="prereq">Introduction</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL is a powerhouse in its own right, but it is also
extensible.  You have a lot of options when it comes to extending
PostgreSQL.  You can use SQL, PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl, PL/Perl, PL/Python, and
more.  Each option has its advantages.  C has the advantage of speed, of
course.  Because PostgreSQL itself is written in C, writing C code also
allows you to leverage some of PostgreSQL's own internal code.  Your C
code can also readily leverage any number of other programming
libraries.  C functions are also a stepping stone toward defining your
own new PostgreSQL base types. Ready to get started?  Great!  Because 
instead of trying to butter you up with a witty preamble, I'm going to 
take you straight to work.</p>

<hr><h3 id="prereq">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>You'll need a fairly recent version of PostgreSQL to follow along.
I'm not going to discuss PostgreSQL's older Version 0 calling
convention.  I'm also using the PGXS build system, which was introduced
in PostgreSQL version 8.0.  The packaged version of PostgreSQL included
with Debian Sarge or Redhat AS4 is older than that.  I have compiled and
used the code below on Debian Etch's packaged version, Fedora Core 6's
packaged version, and on my own compiled from source installation of
PostgreSQL 8.2.4.</p>

<p>If you are using your distribution's packaged version of the
PostgreSQL server, rather than rolling your own; you need to make sure
that you install the corresponding development package, for example:</p>

<pre>
Debian Etch:
  apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-8.1 postgresql-8.1
Fedora Core 6:
  yum install postgresql-server postgresql-devel
</pre>

<p>I'm going to assume you know the basics of how to configure and run
PostgreSQL.  If not, there are plenty of <a
href="#resources">resources</a> to help you get going. I also included
an example build script at the end of this article.</p>

<p>Obviously you'll also need a C compiler.  Make also comes in handy.
Unless, like Alan Cox, you are able to directly manipulate the bits
inside of your computer with your mind, you will also appreciate the use
of a keyboard and monitor.  I think we're ready now.</p>

<hr><h3 id="hello">Hello, World!</h3>

<p>This month I'll present a simple example, and follow-up with some
explanations.  We're going to write a function that takes a single text
argument, and appends it to the the string 'Hello, '.</p>

<p><pre>
prompt&gt; select hello( 'World!' );
     hello
---------------
 Hello, World!
</pre></p>

<p>Using your favorite editor (**cough**<a
href="#emacs">emacs</a>**cough**), create a file called example.c as
follows:</p>

<p><pre>
#include "postgres.h"
#include "fmgr.h"
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#ifdef PG_MODULE_MAGIC
PG_MODULE_MAGIC;
#endif

Datum hello( PG_FUNCTION_ARGS );

PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1( hello );
Datum
hello( PG_FUNCTION_ARGS )
{
   // variable declarations
   char greet[] = "Hello, ";
   text *towhom;
   int greetlen;
   int towhomlen;
   text *greeting;

   // Get arguments.  If we declare our function as STRICT, then
   // this check is superfluous.
   if( PG_ARGISNULL(0) ) {
      PG_RETURN_NULL();
   }
   towhom = PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(0);

   // Calculate string sizes.
   greetlen = strlen(greet);
   towhomlen = VARSIZE(towhom) - VARHDRSZ;

   // Allocate memory and set data structure size.
   greeting = (text *)palloc( greetlen + towhomlen );
   VARATT_SIZEP( greeting ) = greetlen + towhomlen  + VARHDRSZ;

   // Construct greeting string.
   strncpy( VARDATA(greeting), greet, greetlen );
   strncpy( VARDATA(greeting) + greetlen,
            VARDATA(towhom),
            towhomlen );

   PG_RETURN_TEXT_P( greeting );
}
</pre></p>

<p>Now let's build this program, install it, and use it.  <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/xfunc-c.html#DFUNC">Section
33.9.6</a> of the official PostgreSQL documentation explains the
details.  Unless you're doing something complicated, the
PostgreSQL Extension Building Infrastructure, aka PGXS, will probably
suffice.  Create the following Makefile in the same directory as your
code:</p>

<p><pre>
MODULES = example
PGXS := $(shell pg_config --pgxs)
include $(PGXS)
</p></pre>

<p>Run 'make' and then 'make install' as a user with permission to write
the example.so file you just made to the PostgreSQL server's lib
directory.</p>

<p>With the module in place, all that's left to do is to bind our
'hello' function inside of our example.so module to a SQL function that
we can use inside our database.  The following SQL will do the trick.
Put the following text in a file called 'example.sql'.</p>

<p><pre>
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  hello( TEXT )
RETURNS
  TEXT
AS
  'example.so', 'hello'
LANGUAGE
  C
STRICT
IMMUTABLE;
</p></pre>

<p>Open a database with the PostgreSQL interactive command line editor
'psql' as a user with permission to create new functions
(i.e. superuser).  Create your new 'hello' function by loading the
example.sql code above.  For example:

<p><pre>
prompt&gt; \i example.sql
CREATE FUNCTION

=&gt; CREATE TEMP TABLE test( name ) AS
-&gt; VALUES ('Xavier'), ('Yari'), ('Zack');

=&gt; SELECT hello( name ) FROM test;
    hello     
--------------
 Hello, Xavier
 Hello, Yari
 Hello, Zack
(3 rows)
</pre></p>

<hr><h3 id="review">What We Did</h3>

<p>What could possibly be cooler than that?!  Now let's review what we
did.</p>

<p>I'll begin by noting that there are actually two PostgreSQL C
language calling conventions: an older 'Version 0' convention and the
newer 'Version 1' convention.  I'm focusing exclusively on the Version 1
convention.</p>

<p>We begin by including postgres.h and fmgr.h.  There are other
PostgreSQL header files that you will need if you begin developing more
complicated code, but you can pretty much expect that you'll always need
at least these two.  The include statements are followed by a "magic
block".  This block is required as of PostgreSQL version 8.2.  This
statement ensures that the database doesn't load improperly
versioned object files.  The magic block is followed by our C function
declaration.  We can have as many functions in a single object file as
we like.  In this example, we only declare and define one function,
called 'hello'.  I like to put forward declarations of all my C
functions at the beginning of my code to avoid annoying compiler
warnings.  A quiet compiler is a happy compiler.  The
PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1 macro is required for all dynamically loaded Version
1 functions.  I actually have no idea what it does, but I know what
happens when you leave it out: nothing good.</p>

<p>And now at the beginning of our actual function
definition, we can see in the variable declarations that we're using a
PostgreSQL defined type: 'text'.  Of course there are other PostgreSQL
types worth knowing about as well.  <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/xfunc-c.html#XFUNC-C-TYPE-TABLE">Table
33-1</a> in the official PostgreSQL documentation enumerates the C types
corresponding to built-in SQL types.  You should use PG_GETARG_xxx() and
PG_RETURN_xxx() functions to retrieve and return these values from your
function.  A few examples:</p>

<p><pre>
int32    PG_GETARG_INT32(0)     PG_RETURN_INT32(arg)
bytea *  PG_GETARG_BYTEA_P(0)   PG_RETURN_BYTEA_P(arg)
text *   PG_GETARG_TEXT_P(0)    PG_RETURN_TEXT_P(arg)
</pre></p>

<p>The argument to the GETARG functions indicates the position of the
argument in the function call.  The argument to the RETURN functions is
a variable containing data to be returned.  The _P suffix means
'pointer'.  Let's get our input.  Again, the GETARG arguments indicate
position.  So PG_ARGISNULL(0) refers to our first (and only) argument.
If that argument is NULL, we return NULL, and we're done.  Later, when
we look at the SQL we use to import our function, we'll see that
declaring our SQL function STRICT makes this NULL check superfluous, but
I like to include it anyway.  If our argument is not NULL, then we drop
through and use the PG_GETARG_TEXT_P macro to assign the first argument
(they are zero indexed) to our 'towhom' variable.</p>

<p>Variable length types such as bytea or text are always passed by
reference.  We then use macros to set and retrieve the data within our
variable length data types.  Let's take a quick look at the 'varlena'
data structure used internally by PostgreSQL to represent variable
length data structures.  This will help us understand how some of the
other macros we use operate.  (As an aside, the name of this structure
is where A. Elain Mustain <a
href="http://www.varlena.com/GeneralBits/68.php">got the name</a> for
her online PostgreSQL newsletter.)</p>

<p><pre>
struct varlena
{
  int32 vl_len;
  char  vl_dat[1];
};
</pre></p>

<p>The value vl_len member of this structure indicates how much data the
structure is holding.  The vl_dat member holds the data.  Pretty simple,
huh?  However, there's no reason to go poking at this structure
directly.  In fact, we should not assume that this structure even
exists.  Instead, we get and set variable length data with macros.  The
VARSIZE macro tells us the total size of our 'towhom' text.  The
VARHDRSZ macro is a constant, and represents the overhead consumed by
the vl_len member of our varlena structure.  So VARSIZE(towhom) -
VARHDRSZ gives us the number of octets in our text string.  We use the
VARATT_SIZEP macro to set the vl_len member of our 'greeting' text equal
to the size of the text string it's going to store.  Note that
PostgreSQL text strings are not null terminated.  The varlena data
structure obviates the need for an end of string delimiter.  The VARDATA
macro returns a pointer to the data member of our 'greeting' string.</p>

<p>Again: while it's educational to understand what's happening under
the hood, don't go poking around at PostgreSQL internals when you don't
have to.  Use the provided macros instead.</p>

<p>One last note about our C code.  Use 'palloc', not 'malloc'.
PostgreSQL's memory allocation function automatically takes care of
certain cleanup operations that would otherwise be impossible.  How
would you free the memory pointed to by a pointer that's returned from
our function, for example?  PostgreSQL takes care of this for us.
That's not to say we shouldn't free memory when we can.  Use the palloc
function's corresponding 'pfree' function to free memory when it's no
longer needed.</p>

<hr><h3 id="sql">Our SQL Function Definition</h3>

<p>Our CREATE FUNCTION call maps our C function to a corresponding SQL
function, which we will also call 'hello'.  Our SQL function is defined
to take a single TEXT argument, and to return a TEXT result.  We can
include more than one function inside a single object file, but for
today, our example.so file only includes our single 'hello'
function.</p>

<p>Our function is declared to be STRICT, meaning that it will return
NULL on NULL input.  This saves processing overhead (and makes our
functions's NULL checking superfluous, as already mentioned).  Our
function is also declared IMMUTABLE, which means that our function does
not modify the database, and that for any given input, the function will
always return the same output.</p>

<p>See the PostgreSQL documentation for <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/sql-createfunction.html">CREATE
FUNCTION</a> for more details about this statement.</p>

<hr><h3 id="summary">Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>In my next article, I'll expand on this introduction to PostgreSQL C
programming.  I'll show how to use PGXS when you want to link against
external libraries, and I'll explain how to process tuple arguments.
I'll also show how to use the 'ereport' function to provide diagnostic
output while debugging C code that's running inside of a database.</p>

<p>Until then, you might want to take a look in the PostgreSQL
distribution's 'contrib' directory for more examples.  Even if you don't
understand all the code there, you'll almost certainly find something
you can use.  There's a lot of really excellent work in there.</p>

<hr><h3 id="install">Hasty PostgreSQL Installation HOWTO</h3>

<p>Here's the script I use to build PostgreSQL.  You'll need to make
sure you have the development versions of required libraries
installed, e.g. on Debian Sarge you'll need libpam-dev, libperl-dev,
etc.</p>

<p><pre>
NAME=postgresql
VER=8.2.4
APP=${NAME}-${VER}
SRCDIR=/usr/get/src/${NAME}/${APP}
INSTALLDIR=/local/apps/versioned/$APP
LOGFILE=/local/data/build/${APP}.log

[ -d $INSTALLDIR ] &amp;&amp; rm -rf $INSTALLDIR
cd ${SRCDIR}
[ -f config.cache ] &amp;&amp; rm -f config.cache
# make clean
./configure \
    --prefix=$INSTALLDIR \
    --with-pgport=5432 \
    --with-pam \
    --with-perl \
    --with-python \
    --with-openssl \
    --with-readline \
    --enable-thread-safety \
    &gt; $LOGFILE 2&gt;&amp;1

RETVAL=$?
[ ! $RETVAL -eq 0 ] &amp;&amp;
make &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE 2&gt;&amp;1

ETVAL=$?
[ ! $RETVAL -eq 0 ] &amp;&amp;
make install &gt;&gt; $LOGFILE 2&gt;&amp;1

RETVAL=$?
exit $RETVAL
</pre></p>

I like to symlink my versioned installation to /local/apps/postgresql
(so I can quickly change between minor version numbers by changing a
single symlink); then I symlink the binaries in /local/apps/postgresql
to a bin directory on my search path, somewhere where
ldconfig will find them (see /etc/ld.so.conf), and so on.

Create a PostgreSQL superuser and group (Typically 'postgres' &amp;
'postgres').  Create a directory for log files and for the database
which are owned by this user, and give that user write permission.

Here's a simple init script.  Use the 'init' function to create an empty
database.

<p><pre>
#!/bin/sh

VER=8.2
PGACCOUNT=postgres
POSTBIN=/local/bin
PGCTL=${POSTBIN}/pg_ctl
INITDB=${POSTBIN}/initdb
DATADIR=/db/postgres/${VER}
LOGFILE=/var/log/postgres/pg_ctl.log
ENCODING="SQL_ASCII"

# Set postgresql options in postgresql.conf

[ -f ${PGCTL} ] || exit 0

init () {
    echo -n "Initializing PostgreSQL database"
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${INITDB} -D ${DATADIR} -E $ENCODING"
    echo
}

start () {
    echo -n "Starting PostgreSQL..."
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${PGCTL} start -D ${DATADIR} -l ${LOGFILE}"
    echo
}

stop () {
    echo -n "Stopping PostgreSQL..."
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${PGCTL} stop -D ${DATADIR} -m smart"
    echo
}

restart () {
    echo -n "Restarting PostgreSQL..."
    echo
    stop
    sleep 5
    start
}

reload () {
    echo -n "Reloading PostgreSQL configuration..."
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${PGCTL} reload -D ${DATADIR}"
    echo
}

status () {
    echo -n "Checking PostgreSQL status..."
    echo
    su - postgres -c "${PGCTL} status -D ${DATADIR}"
}

case "$1" in
  init)
    init
    ;;
  start)
    start
    ;;
  stop)
    stop
    ;;
  restart)
    restart
    ;;
  reload)
    reload
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: $0 {init|start|stop|restart|reload|status}"
    exit 1
esac

exit 0
</pre></p>

<p>I also like to give myself and root, ident authorization to run as the
'postgres' superuser (i.e. I like to be able to run 'psql -U postgres'
when I'm doing development work so I can get into the database quickly).
Append something like the following to
${your_db_directory}/pg_ident.conf:</p>

<p><pre>
amap          myusername          iddb
amap          myusername          myusername
amap          myusername          postgres
amap          postgres            postgres
amap          root                postgres
</pre></p>

<p>This presumes you have enabled ident authentication in pg_hba.conf,
like so:</p>

<p><pre>
local all all ident amap
</pre></p>

<p>That's a pretty hasty PostgreSQL installation HOWTO.  It's a little
off-topic, but I thought it might help jump start a potential proselyte
or two.</p>

<hr><h3 id="emacs">Emacs Errata</h3>

<p>I'm a big fan of SQL Mode for Emacs (see <a
href="#resources">Resources</a> below).  I run split windows, and use
keyboard shortcuts to run bits of the SQL I'm editing in my *SQL*
buffer.  However, I've always found that sql.el needs a little tweak.
The problem is that when you run 'M-x sql-postgres', it won't prompt you
for a user name.  Unless you always want to connect to the database as
your shell account username, or unless you exclusively use ident
authentication, you'll want to fix this.  Find sql.el on your system,
and edit the PostgreSQL section as follows:</p>

<p><pre>
< (sql-get-login 'database 'server)
> (sql-get-login 'database 'user 'server)

> (if (not (string= "" sql-user))
>   (setq params (append (list "-U" sql-user) params)))
</pre></p>

<p>Run 'byte-compile-file' to create sql.elc.  If you enter nothing at
the 'User:' prompt, you will connect as the current user.  If you want
to use PostgreSQL's ident authentication (assuming you have this
configured in PostgreSQL's pg_hba.conf and pg_ident.conf), leave the
'Server:' prompt blank.  Enter a server name and a password if you are
doing host based authentication.</p>
