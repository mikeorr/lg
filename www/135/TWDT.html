&gt; Hi all!

</pre>
Hi.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I recently installed FC5 and FC6 on a newly acquired AMD 2800+ Sempron
&gt; processor(64-bit). There are a few things i would like to get cleared
&gt; 
&gt; 1. While the packages were being copied, I noticed the i386 extension
&gt; packages being copied. Isnt i386 supposed to mean intel 80386?
</pre>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386</a>
</p>

<p>
"IA-32, sometimes generically called x86-32, is the instruction set architecture
of Intel's most successful microprocessors.
This is a 32-bit extension of the original Intel x86 processor architecture.
The term means Intel Architecture, 32-bit, distinguishing it from the preceding
16-bit x86 processors, and the later 64-bit architecture IA-64, also known as the Itanium architecture.
IA-32 has had such longevity partially because of full backwards compatibility.
The non-proprietary, generic name for this 32-bit architecture is x86-32."
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; 2. The FC5 and FC6 that i installed on my 64-bit AMD was also installed on
&gt; my 32-bit celeron. That means i am using 32bit OS on my 64-bit machine
&gt; right? Will i gain performance by using FC5 for 64-bit?
</pre>

<p>
Not FC5/FC6, but should give you some idea: 
"Ubuntu i386 &amp; x86_64 Compared"
</p>

<p>
Personally, I would take dual/quad core processor over 64-bit one any day <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; Which is the best distro to use on AMD sempron 2800+ ?

<p>
Define 'best'.

<h3>RealPlayer not playing well with others</h3>
<p>
<b>Mike Orr [sluggoster at gmail.com]</b><br />

</p>

<p>
I just set up a Kubuntu system with RealPlayer 10.0.8.805, and it
refuses to squack simultaneously with another noisemaker.  It sulks
silently if kaffeine/kscd/kmix is open, and silences them when it's
playing.  It's opening /dev/dsp directly rather than going through the
sound system.
</p>

<p>
The setup wizard says, "Alsa and esound drivers are not included in
this build.  The OSS device used for playback can be set using the
AUDIO environment variable. eg export AUDIO=/dev/dsp2."  But I've used
Real on Kububtu and Gentoo before without this problem.
</p>

<p>
I looked in the dialogs for an output device setting but didn't see
any.  KDE's sound system is usisng the "autodetect" audio device, and
KInfoCenter says, "Installed drivers: type 10 ALSA emulation.  Audio
devices: VIA 8237 (DUPLEX)".
</p>

<p>
gxine and kaffeine will play RealAudio files, but gxine distorts the
sound in an annoying way, and kaffeine crashes so frequently I forget
I'm not on Windows.  (It even hung the system once with gray vertical
bars on the screen.  I haven't seen that on Linux for years.)
</p>

<p>
Interestingly, when KMix is open Reaplayer is silent until I close
KMix and restart the audio clip a few times.  But if RealPlayer is
running and I open KMix from the volume control in the tray, I can
adjust the volume with KMIx's PCM slider.

<p>
I've been having problems with my SATA disk for some time and I've moved back 
to working off my old IDE disk, while I investigate the problem. I'm assuming 
the problem is hardware, but I don't have any suitable hardware to swap 
around to prove the point. I think my next step is to buy another SATA 
controller and swap that, but first I thought I'd see if the gang's 
collective wisdom had any pointers to offer.

Here's another error I've been getting on all my Kubuntu installs:

<p>
<pre class="code">

</pre>
This happens whenever an X application starts, and sometimes when it
opens a new window.  Apparently it retries a couple times and
succeeds, because I found one application that just gave up and
wouldn't start at all.  I don't remember which one now, not one of the
X apps I'm currently using

here is the actual situation which I like to share with you.
I have a Suse10 box with 2 lan card.  I also have a 10 port
HUB.
Now I like to dial my ISP with one lan card and another lan
will be connected with the HUB. hence the other PCs can
share the net connection from the HUB.  I like to implement
this. Could any one suggest any tutorial or suggest me to do
this ??

Dear list,

<p>
I am facing a really critical problem since last one weak. 
My server is running XAMPP for linux. 
Now the users are accessing the server and doing their
project work using dreamweaver from win PC.
</p>

<p>
but frequently they see the message "This file has been
modified outside of Dreamweaver. Do you want to reload it"
</p>

<p>
I am 100% confirm that there is no one elese who is working
on a particular file. if they accept yes all their
modification has been lost.
Is there any problem in the Linux server or Xampp ?
</p>

<p>
has any one experienced such a problem ? please suggest.
thanks.

<pre>
&gt;From a recent Risks-Forum Digest (Monty Solomon, "Cybercrooks Deliver Trouble"):
</pre>

<pre>
One of the best measures of the rise in cybercrime is junk e-mail, or spam,
because much of it is relayed by computers controlled by Internet criminals,
experts said. More than 90 percent of all e-mail sent online in October was
unsolicited junk mail, according to Postini, an e-mail security firm in San
Carlos, Calif. Spam volumes monitored by Postini rose 73 percent in the past
two months as spammers began embedding their messages in images to evade
junk e-mail filters that search for particular words and phrases. In
November, Postini's spam filters, used by many large companies, blocked 22
billion junk-mail messages, up from about 12 billion in September.
</pre>
Gosh, who could possibly have predicted that content-based filtering
wouldn't work?

about SPF here, and I strongly suspect elsewhere as well. So have many
other people. It's just that now, the problem is coming to roost in a
big way, and all these people are now scrambling in panic.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps - one day, after the human race grows up - we'll all have a
reflex that causes us to do the obvious things that prevent problems
instead of focusing all our energies on emergency management. The latter
makes you look like a hero if you pull it off... but the chances of
failure, with attendant chances of damage or death, are high and not
very controllable. For now, we just get to watch the frenzied scrabbling
for a way out, with its usual outcome of mostly-wrong answers.

I have a critical problem with my net setting and searching
for some kind guidance.
</p>

<p>
well, I have 2 ISP and a load balancing router ( Linksys
RV042).
My one ISP, say ISP1 is based on ADSL technology. The modem
to dialup ISP1 is
smartATX MT841 and it has inbuilt dialing feature. so a
connection from this 
smartATX MT841 direcly comes to WAN1 port the of the load
balancing router.
</p>

<p>
another ISP, say ISP2. now there is a PC with 2 lan card for
this isp2. one lan dialups
ISP2 and another lan card from this same machine fed this
connection to the WAN2 port
of the load balancing router.
</p>

<p>
till now there is no problem at all and the load balancing
feature is running great.
</p>

<p>
BUT the problem is with the PC which dialups the ISP2 and
fed the connection to 
the load balancing router. it actually behaves like a modem.
so the user in that machine
can't share the local lan resources and we can't share the
resources of that PC.
</p>

<p>
could any one kindly suggest any solution please ?
thanks for the support.

It's recognizing the user option but ignoring the uid,gid,fmask, and
dmask options.
</p>

<p>
I set the unmounted directory to mode 777 owned by myself because I
remembered hearing that has some effect on the mount's permissions,
but it didn't make a difference.

<p>
I tried mounting it with sudo and without, and removing the uid/gid or

<p>
Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I am running a PC having suse 10.  I have 2 lan card here
and like to configure 2 cards with different setting.
I have tried to configure the cards using Yast, but the
problem is ; 2 cards taking the same DNS, gateway etc from
the configuration which 
I make latter.  I think there may be some problem in yast,
so I like to do it manually. could any one suggest me the
file in suse 10 where I can 
write configuration for eth0 and eth1 and could any one
kindly provide an example configuration <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
thanks in advanced.

of online office suites.
</p>

<p>
The interesting part is that Slashdot also mention Docvert[1]
(<a href="http://holloway.co.nz/docvert/index.html">http://holloway.co.nz/docvert/index.html</a>), an open source, web based
document converter - not an office suite, but at least the "host my
own" crowd have an option to view word processor documents (if they're
willing to run public-facing software that's based on OpenOffice or
Abiword...)
</p>

<p>
It's interesting that 3 of the 4 support importing and exporting
OpenOffice files (although ajaxPresents from Ajax13 gives nothing but
errors when you try to export openoffice, though their "own" .appt

<h3>Followup: opening VA FullON 2230 (LG134)</h3>
<p>
<b>Rick Moen [rick at linuxmafia.com]</b><br />
<b>Tue, 2 Jan 2007 00:38:53 -0800</b>
</p>

<p>
(This is a response to your request for help, opening VA FullON 2230
just printed in Linux Gazette's issue #134.)
</p>

<p>
The article you read is correct, that it's necessary to remove the
CD-ROM / floppy assembly before getting to the HDs.  Here's how:
</p>

<p>
Unscrew the two Philips screws on either side of the floppy drive.  
Now, remove the top cover that is atop the rear 3/4 of the chassis's
top surface, so that you can reach the back of the CD drive.  Reaching
inside the chassis, push the CD drive towards the front.  This will
dislodge the six-inch-wide faceplate that houses the CD and floppy
drives, allowing it to slide forward.
</p>

<p>
A flange on that faceplate projecting sideways towards the hard drives 
is the main obstacle to removing the twelve-inch faceplate in front of
the hard drives, which you now should be able to likewise dislodge
forwards.  That faceplate contains two very noisy, small fans:  FYI,
I've replaced those fans on my unit with quiet aftermarket fans, each
with a slide switch letting you select one of three speeds, making my
house a great deal quieter.
</p>

<p>
Once you have the twelve-inch faceplate removed, you can reach in from
the front to the four drive bays, a vertical pair on the left and a
similar vertical pair next to that.  Each bay can accomodate a drive
sled that is fastened from the front with a Philips screw in the upper
left.  Once you've removed the screw, the sled and attached drive should
slide forwards.  (You'll want to detach any cables from the drive,
first.)
</p>

<p>
Speaking for the former staff of VA Linux Systems, I hope you get many
long years of enjoyment from your model 2230.
</p>

<p>

Rick Moen

<p>
Hi list!
i need your advice. The situation is like this
</p>

<p>
We have a situation where we have a DEC Alpha Server with a Concurrent
Server which spawns a child to every process that we connect to. On a
Linux box on the same network, we have built a client which connects
to the server ,we see the connection and every things is good. At this
time we try to invoke another instance of the this client, at this
point it kills the first connection and the second one connects. We
are passing the Internet address of the server to connect.
</p>

<p>
If we have the client on the same server we can spawn multiple
instances and every instance connects, in this case though the address
127.0.0.1 or the local host.
</p>

<p>
Any pointers as to how we can have multiple client using the same socket.

Perhaps I should wait for the next bit but I think the problem may be in the 
published section. In particular the unpacking phase.
</p>

<p>
I can't unpack the file . I tried to attach it but not allowed  , it should 
have 50 files or so  on it and does ,I can see them during the unpacking 
phase but I can't extract them at least not to  the same computer. What have 
I done wrong please? I'm playing on the one computer only atm so I used 
the --yes option.
</p>

<p>
Attached the file ScriptUSB.pl but my provider won't send it unless I name 
it ".text" Took out the first line too just in case

The fuse page <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems">http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems</a> that
lists all known fuse projects was changed a few weeks ago.
</p>

<p>
All network filesytstems are are now listed in a separate page. Follow the
link NetworkFileSystems at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
That's just a link so that should be obvious but, frankly, it took me a
while to figure out why some well known projects such as sshfs or fusesmb
were not listed anymore in that page. Even now that I know I still dont
find it obvious.
</p>

<p>
Some very cool projects I would like to mention are
</p>

<pre>
  - sshfs to mount a remote ssh account. I use it a lot to manage my web site:
    sshfs user@hostname: localdir
 
  - encfs to create an encrypted directory.

Maybe you have heard about this before, but in case you haven't... Puppy 
Linux is desiged to support booting from a USB flash drive, as well as 
Live-CD/DVD (with multi-session data saves, even to CD-R!) and more 
traditional types of installations.  If you are not familiar with Puppy 
LInux, you should take a look!  A few links:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.puppyos.com/">http://www.puppyos.com/</a>
  <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/user/viewpage.php?page_id=1">http://www.puppylinux.org/user/viewpage.php?page_id=1</a>
  <a href="http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/">http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/</a>
</p>

<p>
Puppy LInux would make a good base for experimenting with the 
highly-mobile form factors mentioned in the article.  To really get to 
the point of roll-up screens and cell-phone-sized CPU units, we might be 
better with a non-x86 platform (closer to a PDA CPU and chipset).  Linux 
might be still a good software base, but it will not be a standard PC 
platform at that point, making it easier to have a "clean" hardware and 
software architecture.  Just my thoughts.  I'd like to see to see the 
ultra-portable kit described in th article in reality!

I think fuse is something like KDE's kio system.
</p>

<p>
For example, type ftp://ftp.iitm.ac.in in Konqueror's location bar,then 
Konqueror will open that ftp site as a filesystem, just like curlftpfs did.

Subject: Jbilling:  Possible unauthorised use of OSI Certified service mark
</pre>
Dear OSI Board members:
</p>

<p>
Please see <a href="http://www.jbilling.com/?q=node/7&amp;pl=pr">http://www.jbilling.com/?q=node/7&amp;pl=pr</a> 
Note OSI Certified logo. 
</p>

<p>
The company in question, Sapienter Billing Software Corporation, is yet
another Web 2.0 company using MPL 1.1 + an "Exhibit B" badgeware
addendum, calling it "open source".  However, this firm takes one step
further the stance characteristic of Socialtext, SugarCRM, Alfresco,
Zimbra, Qlusters, Jitterbit, Scalix, MuleSource, Dimdim, Agnitas AG,
Openbravo, Emu Software, Terracotta, Cognizo Technologies, ValueCard,
KnowledgeTree, OpenCountry, and 1BizCom, by using OSI's certification
mark in outright violation of OSI's licensing terms -- or, at least, I'd
be surprised to learn otherwise.  Therefore, I'm mentioning that use, in
case corrective action is needed.
</p>


<p>
I'd suggest Sapienter illustrates why "Exhibit B" licences (though
certainly <em>not</em> badgeware licences generically) have become, in my view,
a serious problem:  
</p>

<p>
o  Substantively all (probably literally all 19) of the above-listed firms 
   already have considerable history of claiming in public to be open source.
</p>

<p>
o  Few if any mention their licences' lack of OSI approval.  Many
   imply otherwise; one (Sapienter) outright claims approval (as noted).
</p>

<p>
o  Not ONE has applied for OSI approval, though many are demonstrably 
   aware of OSI's approval process.  It's also notable that 
   many of their modified-MPL licences were reportedly written by OSI
   General Counsel Mark Radcliffe in his private capacity -- so it's 
   doubtful many are unaware.
</p>

<p>
o  Several of those firms' officers have already turned a deaf ear
   (so far) to suggestions on OSI license-discuss that they make their
   licences comply with OSD#10 ("License Must Be Technology-Neutral" --
   the main problem) by adding "if any" qualifiers to their licences'
   requirements concerning "each user interface screen".

Aside from Sapienter's outreach breach of trademark law, some might
object that OSI simply cannot do anything, to correct this situation.  I
beg to differ, and ask that OSI take appropriate, measured, and
constructive action:  Please consider issuing a formal statement
deploring use of "modified MPL" licenses in circumvention of OSI
scrutiny, and especially their use without clearly disclosing lack of

<h2>News in General</h2>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Open Source Development Labs and Free Standards Group
Merge; form the Linux Foundation</h3>

<p>The big news in January was the merger of Open Source Development
Labs and Free Standards Group. The new
organization hopes to accelerate Linux growth by providing
a comprehensive set of services to compete effectively with proprietary
platforms. Founding platinum members of Linux Foundation include
Fujitsu, Hitachi, HP, IBM, Intel, NEC, Novell, and Oracle. Jim Zemlin,
Free Standards Group's former executive director, leads the Linux
Foundation. Other members include every major
company in the Linux industry, including Red Hat, as well as numerous
community groups, universities, and industry end-users.</p>

<p>Of course, Linus Torvalds need not fear, since the new
foundation announced that it will continue to sponsor his work. The
Foundation's major goals include protecting Linux by sponsoring key
Linux developers, and providing legal services. The press release states:
"It is vitally important that Linux creator Linus Torvalds and other key
kernel developers remain independent. Linux Foundation sponsors them
so they can work full time on improving Linux. Linux Foundation also
manages the Linux trademark (<a href="http://www.linuxmark.org">http://www.linuxmark.org</a>) and offers developers
legal intellectual property protection through such initiatives as the
Open Source as Prior Art project (<a href="http://www.osapa.org">http://www.osapa.org</a>), the Patent Commons
<a href="http://www.patent-commons.org">http://www.patent-commons.org</a>), and sponsorship of the Linux Legal Defense
Fund."</p>

<p>Other major goals are standardizing Linux and improving it as a
platform for software development, and providing a neutral forum for
collaboration and promotion.</p>

<p>The merger is pending ratification by the two organizations'
respective memberships, and is expected to be completed in early
February. For more information, please visit <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Fedora Summit Offers
Road Map for Community-Wide Changes</h3>

<p>The Fedora Group recently held a three-day summit to establish short-
and long-term plans for future Fedora Projects. The summit drew 10 top
Red Hat and Fedora team members to the table, including Jesse Keating,
Fedora's release engineer; Fedora developer Jeremy Katz; engineer and
original Fedora Project founder Warren Togami; Greg DeKoenigsberg,
community development manager for Red Hat; and Fedora Project Leader Max
Spevack. The meeting was also transcribed live to an IRC channel, where
more that 100 members of the community contributed.</p>

<p>The summit resulted in a road map that will lead to changes for the
community as a whole. The most important change is the merging of Fedora
Core and Fedora Extras. It is hoped that this will lead to lowering a
barrier for community involvement, and increase the contributions made
by Red Hat and members of the Open Source community as a whole.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Jeremy Allison Resigns From Novell</h3>

<p>The legendary Jeremy Allison (of Samba fame) has resigned from Novell
in protest over the Microsoft-Novell patent agreement. He felt that the
deal was "a mistake" that will be "damaging to Novell's success in the
future." His main issue with the deal, though, was "that even if it does
not violate the letter of the licence, it violates the intent of the GPL
licence the Samba code is released under, which is to treat all
recipients of the code equally." He was quickly snapped up by Google,
and has begun working there in the new year.</p>

Novell.</p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Microsoft Hands out
16,000 SUSE Linux Subscriptions</h3>

<p>Undeterred by harsh criticism over their controversial
interoperability and patent protection agreement, Microsoft has managed
to hand out over 16,000 subscription certificates for SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server. Several large enterprise customers such as Deutsche
Bank AG, Credit Suisse, and AIG Technologies have been amongst the first
to take advantage of the new-found interoperability between Windows
Server and SUSE Linux.</p>

<p>As part of the deal between the two companies, Microsoft said it would
distribute 70,000 coupons a year for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, so
that customers could benefit from the use of an interoperable version of
Linux with patent coverage, as well as the collaborative work between
the two companies.</p>

<p>According to <a
href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/microsoft_starts_handing_out_suse_linux_subscriptions.html?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">eWeek</a>,
some of these seats might have come at Red Hat's expense. The Forrester
Research group had earlier suggested that this might be the case, and, if
these reports are true, Red Hat might be getting worried.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Will Sun's Solaris
Trump Red Hat Support?</h3>

<p>Sun Microsystems is following Oracle in attacking Red Hat, claiming
that the leading open source Linux company is under-serving customers,
and that Solaris can do the job better. "The big take-away is that it is
not just the [Solaris] technology," said Rich Green, executive
vice-president of software at Sun. "There is a vacuum that is not being
served by Red Hat or served by Microsoft. We are well positioned and
fully intend to fill the gap."</p>

<p>Sun offers free access to Solaris 10 as well as support that the company
claims is 20 to 50 percent cheaper than Red Hat support, and is priced
competitively with Oracle Red Hat support. Sun has always said that
Solaris is superior (more robust, secure, and supportable) to Red Hat
Linux or other distributions for enterprises as well as smaller
businesses and startups, and there is some evidence of this.</p>

<p>Sun's attack on Red Hat might sound good on paper, but the actual
success of this campaign will only be seen in a few months. Yahoo
Finance has a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />EU Commission Study Finds OSS Saves Money</h3>

<p>The EU Commission's Final Report on its "Study on the Economic Impact
of Open Source Software on Innovation and the Competitiveness of the
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector in the EU" has
just been released. The study was done by an international consortium,
led by the United Nations University/University of Maastricht's
department of innovation. The 287 page report is <a
href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/ict/policy/doc/2006-11-20-flossimpact.pdf">freely
available.</a></p>

<p>This study categorically debunked the idea that total cost of
ownership will rise if a company or a government switches to open source
software. Section 12.7 of the study states: "Our findings show
that, in almost all the cases, a transition toward open source reports
of savings on the long term -- costs of ownership of the software
products." Of course, training costs and other costs are a factor, but
the study has taken these into account before coming to this
conclusion.</p>

<p>This study should give an added impetus to the attempts of various EU
members to switch to open source software.</p>



<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Audi engineering luxury cars on Linux</h3>

<p>
Over the past several years, Audi AG, a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group,
has been migrating its engineering systems to Linux. The company has
been upgrading to 64-bit Linux for its Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)
servers, whose simulation software allows designers to craft automobile
components, engineers to run crash-test simulations, and other 3D
visualizations. The move to X86_64 and Itanium 2 has allowed for better
runtimes for CAE's power-hungry processes, using the architectures'
larger caches.  </p>

<p>
Audi's migration is not limited to its servers, using Linux for its
workstations, WebCenter intranet and Web applications, and public and
private servers, using the array of publicly available packages. By
cutting the number of operating systems employed, Audi cut IT costs.
However, because machines became cheaper to employ, the number of
machines grew, causing operating costs to remain relatively the same.
</p>

<p>
These considerations and others are outlined in the <a
href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/12/21/1640241">original
article</a>, along with quotations from Florian Kienast, Audi's spokesman.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Fab@Home: Another Mainframe to PC Story?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.fabathome.org">Fab@Home</a> is an open source
project that provides a low-cost solution to desktop manufacturing. This
self-assembled device fabricates 3D objects by layering liquid or
powdered material, a process that was previously not feasible for
individuals due to its high cost. Unlike many commercial machines of its
kind, Fab@Home's fabricators can use different building materials:
everything from silicone to chocolate. The fabricator is plugged into
the user's computer, using software to control its mechanical functions.
</p>

<p> Users of Fab@Home have contributed basic and advanced 3D designs to
the community, allowing new users to climb a potentially steep learning
curve more quickly; a catalog of these designs is hosted on <a
href="http://www.fabathome.org/wiki/index.php?title=Fab%40Home:Design_Library">Fab@Home's
web site</a>. Users of the fabricator are also encouraged to modify the
design, hopefully contributing their ideas to the community.  </p>

<p>
Even the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fabathome/">software
client</a>, which interfaces between the user and the fabricator, is
open source; the source code was posted on 1/17/07.  </p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Gentoo/FreeBSD on Hold Due to Licensing Issues</h3>

<p>Flameeyes (a Gentoo/FreeBSD developer) recently discovered serious
licensing issues in the various *BSD projects who use BSD-4 licensed
code. In a post on his <a
href="http://farragut.flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/articles/2007/01/07/gentoo-freebsd-license-problems-requires-a-development-pause">blog</a>,
he states how he discovered the license problems with libkvm and
start-stop-daemon. "libkvm is a userspace interface to FreeBSD kernel,
and it's licensed under the original BSD license, BSD-4 if you want, the
one with the nasty advertising clause." The good news is that the
University of California/Berkeley has given people permission to drop the
advertising clause. The bad news is that libkvm has code from many other
sources, and each of them needs to give their permission for the license
to be changed.</p>

<p>Linux.com has an 
<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/01/08/224251">article</a>

informative, funny, and off-topic 
<a href="http://bsd.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/08/1219254">comments</a> 
on the subject.
The problem seems to have been temporarily resolved, but could crop up
again in different code.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Sun To License
OpenSolaris Under GPLv3?</h3>

<p>Sun Microsystems is set to license OpenSolaris under the upcoming GNU
General Public License Version 3 in addition to the existing Common
Development and Distribution License, according to a 
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2084284,00.asp">story in
eWeek</a>. OpenSolaris currently is licensed only under Sun's CDDL. The
article quotes sources as saying that this is very likely to happen
after the release of that version of the GPL, which currently is being
rewritten and is expected to be made final soon.</p>

<p>The <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Fedora 6 Zod Live CD Released</h3>

<p>After lots of feedback, bug fixing, and testing, the Fedora Project is
pleased to announce the first official Fedora live CD. This live CD is
based on packages from the Fedora Core 6 and Fedora Extras package
collections, and comprises 100% free software. The live CD features
ver 2.6.18 of the kernel, GNOME 2.16, AIGLX and Compiz, and the usual
plethora of desktop applications. Some notable features are the
inclusion of VPN connectivity through vnpc and OpenVPN, a R/W 
filesystem that allows you to install software on the running live CD, and
the ability to run completely from RAM, if you have 1GB or more.</p>

<p>The CD can be downloaded <a
href="http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/projects/live/FC-6-i386-livecd-1.iso">
here</a>. Currently, the CD is only available for i386 architectures,

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Linspire opens up CNR</h3>

<p>Linspire announced plans to expand its popular Click 'N Run digital
download and software management service to support several of the most
popular desktop Linux distributions in 2007. Previously available only
for Linspire and Freespire desktop Linux users, the CNR service will
begin providing users of other desktop Linux distributions a free and
easy way to access over 20,000 desktop Linux products, packages, and
libraries.</p>

<p>Initially, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu will be supported,
using both .deb and .rpm packages. More distributions will be added,
later this year. Linspire CEO Kevin Carmony goes into more detail about

released, with this statement from the developers: "This release is the
culmination of 3 years of work, starting with Hideya-san who originally
conceived of a bold, new type of window system, through the initial
shake down of the proof-of-concept demo by an internal Sun community,
followed by the open sourcing of the technology, which generated such
enormous interest that it brought down the java.net servers several
times. From that point on, many people from around the globe have
contributed to the project; contributing to the core, contributing
applications, performing testing, writing and translating documentation,
etc. The project owners (Hideya, Paul, Krishna and I) are very
grateful for all of the great contributions we have received from you,
the LG community."</p>

<h1>Nomachine NX server</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/knaggs.html">Peter Knaggs</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
In this article, I'm going to describe my first attempt at installing and
trying out CentOS's packages on RHEL4 for Nomachine's NX server. I never
had time to do it before, but it was well worth the journey of discovery.
</p>

<p>
Compared to VNC, it's amazingly fast, and quite straightforward to set up
using the CentOS packages for RHEL4, so you can make all your "hosted" C
developers much happier by giving them speedy access to the desktop of
their RHEL4 hosted box, right from their "standard-issue" Microsoft Windows
desktop machines. As I understand it, the NX client that Nomachine make
available for free download is still proprietary; however, Nomachine makes
the sources for Linux available under GPL, so I'm not quite sure how all
that works out.
</p>

<p>
I have stumbled across NX server briefly a year ago when I used Kanotix,
because at the time I was surprised to find an unexpected <code>authorized_keys</code>
file sitting in "nx" user's home directory. I thought that some wiley hacker had
been fiddling with my laptop, but on closer inspection it turned out to be
the standard way NX package is installed (will be explained in more
detail at the end of this article).
</p>

<p>
In the following writeup, I use the term "Linux hosted box" to mean a Linux
box hosted far away in a datacenter somewhere.
</p>

<h3>Benefits of the Nomachine NX server</h3>

<ul>
<li> very fast, full graphical desktop (even over dial-up modem)
<li> much faster than VNC
<li> far more secure than VNC
<!-- <li> simple and reliable configuration leveraging OpenSSH -->
<li> simple and reliable configuration, based on OpenSSH
<li> source code available under GNU Public License (GPL)
<li> free support from the Linux Community
<li> enterprise-level paid support available from Nomachine and CentOS
</ul>

<h3>NX Server/Client Installation</h3>

<p>
<strong>1. Server side (your RHEL4 Linux hosted box)</strong><br>
Download the NX and FreeNX packages from the CentOS4 repository.
CentOS is Community Enterprise Linux, a "whitebox" rebuild of RHEL,
so it is fully compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, and
supported to the same level.
</p>

<p>
<a href="wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/4/extras/i386/RPMS/nx-1.5.0-1.centos4.i386.rpm">wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/4/extras/i386/RPMS/nx-1.5.0-1.centos4.i386.rpm</a><br>
<a href="wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/4/extras/i386/RPMS/freenx-0.5.0-10.c4.noarch.rpm">wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/4/extras/i386/RPMS/freenx-0.5.0-10.c4.noarch.rpm</a>
</p>

<p>
Install NX and FreeNX packages as follows:
</p>

<pre>
sudo rpm -Uvh nx-1.5.0-1.centos4.i386.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh freenx-0.5.0-10.c4.noarch.rpm
</pre>

<p>
This also adds a new user called "nx" to your Linux hosted box (extract
from /etc/passwd follows):
</p>

<pre>
nx:x:499:11::/var/lib/nxserver/home:/usr/bin/nxserver
</pre>

<p>
Note that the "shell" of this new "nx" user is "/usr/bin/nxserver", so it is
dedicated to the purpose of serving NX clients, and isn't a general-purpose
user account.
</p>

<p>
The package installation also generates a new OpenSSH keypair in the home
directory of the new "nx" user. Please make sure the permissions are as follows
after the install, in order to to allow OpenSSH work properly:
</p>

<pre>
bash-3.00# ls -l /var/lib/nxserver/home/.ssh
total 16
-r--------  1 nx root 602 Dec 16 10:33 authorized_keys2
-rw-------  1 nx root 668 Dec 16 09:50 client.id_dsa.key
-rw-r--r--  1 nx root 220 Dec 16 09:50 known_hosts
-rw-------  1 nx root 602 Dec 16 09:50 server.id_dsa.pub.key
</pre>

<p>
<strong>2. Client side for Microsoft Windows</strong><br>
A nice guide can be found here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://wiki.centos.org/FreeNX">http://wiki.centos.org/FreeNX</a>
</p>

<p>
After installing the NX server as shown in Section 1., copy
<code>/var/lib/nxserver/home/.ssh/client.id_dsa.key</code> to your
Microsoft Windows client machine.  This is the key you'll need to gain
access to the nxserver you installed in section 1.
</p>

<p>
Download the NX client from Nomachine's website:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.nomachine.com/download.php">http://www.nomachine.com/download.php</a>
</p>

<p>
Click on the green arrow next to "NX Client for Windows"; now
click the same arrow again, and then click the "Download package" button.
Install it as usual, then start it up.
</p>

<p>
Click on "Configure", and under the "General" tab, click on the "Key..."
button; then, click on "Import" to read in contents of
<code>client.id_dsa.key</code> that was mentioned above.
</p>

<p>
For "Host", enter name of your Linux hosted box; for "Port", enter
"22"; for "Desktop", choose "Unix" "GNOME".
</p>

<p>
Make sure to select "GNOME" as the window manager, as the default ("KDE") is
missing KDE panel, making it awkward to use. Looks like a bug, but
GNOME window manager is preferred by Red Hat, so it is fine for now.
</p>

<p>
For the network speed setting, the default "ADSL" is suitable if you're
working from home, but for working from office "WAN" might be better.
</p>

<p>
Set "Display" setting to suit your needs, depending on your client
machine's current desktop resolution. Start with 1024x768. Once things are
working properly, you can go back, choose "Custom" and enter 1280x1024,
as this will give you a larger desktop.
</p>

<p>
On "Advanced" tab, make sure to select the option
<pre>
[x] Enable SSL encryption on all traffic
</pre>
It's important because not only is the traffic encrypted, but then NX
client-server connection uses <strong>only</strong> that port you have
configured above. No ports need to be open on your client box (or on any
firewall in between).
</p>

<p>
In the "Services" tab, printing and audio (multimedia) support can be
configured, but that's somewhat more involved to explain; I suggest
experimenting with it if you're interested.
</p>

<p>
Click [OK] once you've finished configuration. When you're prompted to
save it, click [Yes].
</p>

<p>
Now enter your regular username and password that you use
to log in to your Linux hosted box.
</p>

<p>
Note that once the desktop has started up, <code>/usr/NX/bin/nxclient</code>
exits. In order to be able to reconnect to your desktop session later,
click "X" in the top-right-corner to "kill" the NXclient window.
A dialog box will pop up within the desktop session as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  Press the suspend button to disconnect the running session.
  You will be able to resume the session at later time. Press the
  terminate button to exit the session and close all the running
  programs.
    (Suspend)  (Terminate)  (Cancel)
</pre>

<p>
Click on "Suspend".
</p>

<p>
The next time you log in via NXclient, you will see this message:
<pre>
  "Resuming the suspended session"
</pre>
and your desktop will be just where you left it earlier.
</p>

<p>
<strong>3. Client side for Ubuntu Linux (Dapper Drake 6.06LTS)</strong><br>

A nice guide can be found here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://wiki.centos.org/FreeNX">http://wiki.centos.org/FreeNX</a>
</p>

<p>
After installing the NX server as shown in Section 1, copy
<code>/var/lib/nxserver/home/.ssh/client.id_dsa.key</code>
to your client machine in order to gain access to the nxserver.
</p>

<p>
Copy the key where it should be on client machine:
</p>

<pre>
cp $HOME/client.id_dsa.key $HOME/.ssh/id_dsa
</pre>

<p>
Test whether you can use OpenSSH to gain access to the nxserver you installed
on your Linux hosted box. Essentially, just do a plain 'ssh' login to your
Linux hosted box as user "nx" (no password should be necessary, because
you will be using your private client key from <code>$HOME/.ssh/id_dsa</code>),
and what you should see is the "shell" of the "nxserver":
</p>

<pre class="code">
ssh nx@linux_hosted_box
Last login: Sat Dec 16 18:48:53 2006 from client.your.domain
which: no xauth in (/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin)
HELLO NXSERVER - Version 1.5.0-50-SVN OS (GPL)
NX&gt; 105
</pre>

<p>
Now install the client package for Ubuntu Linux. The source for this
package is not available, it's a proprietary NX client from the Nomachine
company (with the logo "!M"). You can do this straight from the command
line:
</p>

<pre>
  wget http://64.34.161.181/download/2.1.0/Linux/nxclient_2.1.0-9_i386.deb
  sudo dpkg -i nxclient_2.1.0-9_i386.deb
</pre>

<p>
Or, if you're a fan of doing things GUI way, you can go to <a
href="http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-linux.php">http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-linux.php</a>,
search for "NX Client DEB for Linux", click on the green arrow, and then
click the "Download package" button.
</p>

<p>
Launch the client using command
</p>

<pre>
  /usr/NX/bin/nxclient
</pre>

<p>
and configure it as described in Section 2.

<p>
Note that cut-and-paste works properly between the nxclient
environment and your client's desktop, so it is a much
cleaner working experience than what you get when using VNC
viewer to remotely control your Linux hosted box.
</p>


<h3>Understanding the security aspects of NX server</h3>
<p>
The OpenSSH key is only used to gain access to the NX server which
runs as a "shell" of "nx" user. It is the NX server that performs
actual PAM authentication using your supplied username and password.
</p>

<p>
The <code>client.id_dsa.key</code> is actually an additional layer of precaution,
which secures access to the "shell" of "nx" user, i.e. to
NX server itself, in case NX server had any security holes in
its PAM authentication layers.
</p>

<p>
This is why <code>client.id_dsa.key</code> isn't usually further secured
with a passphrase; however, if you are familiar with use of 'ssh-agent',
you may feel it worthwhile to add a passphrase to <code>client.id_dsa.key</code>.

</pre>

<hr />

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Perhaps it's just my strong editorial preferences - or maybe my somewhat
naive expectation that technical material will be edited for accuracy - but
this book managed to hit the bottom of my personal rating system with a
solid "THUNK" in the first couple of pages. Misspellings, a clear absence
of post-production review (e.g., "At least one Network Interface Card NIC
is required..."), endless errors of basic grammar and diction, confusion in
the usage of conventions that are defined in the book's own preface - all
these added up to a nearly-instant impression of second-rate, amateur
publishing. (The "Errata" section was particularly amusing, stating as it
does that any errors reported will "save other readers from frustration";
the implementation of this would be fascinating, since it would require the
ability to reverse the flow of time.) Although I was still willing to be
convinced (after all, the preface may have been copied from boilerplate),
the problems remained and grew in scope as the book went on.
</p>

<p>
It is possible the authors are experts in networking and firewall
configuration; I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. If so,
that fact would be impossible to divine from this book: the statements made
about networking in general are often near-quotations of textbook material
that are only peripherally applicable to the subject at hand, and are
occasionally incorrect, outdated, or made with an obvious lack of
understanding of the underlying issues.
</p>

<p>
As a consultant and a professional technical instructor, I have on
occasion been required to teach in situations where I knew the student
materials to be poorly written. At those times, I advised the students to
arm themselves with pens - preferably red ones - and had them correct the
errors in the book as we worked through it. In retrospect, I believe that
those students learned more (<strong>and</strong> had a lot more fun in the
process) than the ones who had excellent materials from the start. Perhaps
this book would make an excellent foil for that sort of usage, as long as
it is taught by a competent professional with a sharp eye for errors - but
for a new user who is unfamiliar with the actual details of networking,
this book would be a poor start indeed.
</p>

<pre>
"If you learn it right, you'll do it right the rest of your life. If you
learn it wrong, you'll do it wrong and spend the rest of your life trying
to learn to do it right."
 -- Sgt. Steve Prazenka
</pre>

<p>
Although I'm sure that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hackworth">Hack's</a> old platoon
sergeant never read this book, his oft-stated dictum applies in full
here. This is not a book for those who want to learn it right.
</p>

<h3>Diving In Head-First</h3>

<p>
In the first chapter - in theory, the chapter that introduces firewalls and
the basic concepts of networking - the second paragraph contains a
statement that runs as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Don't worry if you don't understand all of the concepts we discuss -
equally, readers more comfortable with networking concepts should be able
to skip ahead. IPCop makes explicit understanding of many of these concepts
irrelevant, as it attempts to make administration simple and automated
wherever possible."
</pre>

<p>
I agree with the above in principle: the readers who are comfortable with
networking concepts <em>should</em> skip ahead - unless they want
entertainment. Readers who are not comfortable with networking concepts
should <em>also</em> skip ahead - all the way to the end of the book. Then
they should skip over to their computer, and thence to
<a href="http://www.ipcop.org/">http://www.ipcop.org/</a> where they can
click on the "Docs" tab - an excellent, detailed series of documents
written in plain English and addressing the specific issues and questions
of dealing relevant to IPCop. They'll have an easier time reading the
material, a better chance of understanding the concepts, and waste less
time on non-pertinent issues.
</p>

<h3>The Other Bits</h3>
<p>
The rest of the book is of much the same quality as the above, and consists
essentially of installation and configuration instructions without - as far
as I can tell - any expansion on or amplification of the material available
on the IPCop.org site. In all truth, a recap of the included material would
be tedious and would serve no one; consequently, you won't find it here.
</p>

<p>
Just for contrast, by the way: I spent about 10 minutes poking around in
the "Docs" section of the IPCop site, and was uniformly impressed with
everything I saw; when it came to this book, I was disillusioned within 2
minutes and became progressively more disappointed over the (approximately)
90 minutes that I spent conscientiously poring over its tortuous byways and
blind alleys.
</p>

<p>
In short, I wish I had my 90 minutes back.
</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I can say, with a clear heart, that I had no axe to grind as I went about
doing this review; the opposite, if anything. Kshipra Singh, the
representative of PACKT Publishing who contacted me, was most friendly and
cooperative, the book was in my hands very quickly after he offered to send
it to me for review, and the graphical design of the book cover is quite nice.
The end result, however, has caused me to underscore, in my mind, the old
truism: the Open Source community, at its best, performs far better work
than its commercial competitors. The contrast - as in this case - can be
glaringly obvious.

<h1>TCP and Linux' Pluggable Congestion Control Algorithms</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Many months ago I had a few drinks with some fellow hackers. The discussion
touched on the inevitable
"my-Linux-is-better-than-your-*BSD-and-vice-versa" topic.  I tried to
argue in favour of Linux because it knows multiple TCP variants. They
corrected me and said that there is only one TCP and that *BSD speaks it
very well. Days after the side effects of the drinks were gone, I
remembered the discussion and felt a sense of <a
href="http://wordsmith.org/words/esprit_d_escalier.html"><em>l'esprit
d'escalier</em></a>. Of course, there is a clear definition what the famous
Tricky Communication Protocol (TCP) looks like, but there are many ways of
dealing with situations in Wide Area Networks (WANs) where congestion,
round-trip times, and packet loss play a major role. That's what I wanted
to say. Enter Linux's pluggable congestion control algorithms.  </p>

<h3>
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
</h3>

<p>
Every time you wish to transport data in a reliable way, you probably use TCP
(or your car, but let's stick to networks). 
TCP is able to transport large amounts of data in the correct order over
unreliable network links. The protocol keeps track of sent data, detects lost
packets, and retransmits them if necessary. This is done by acknowledging every packet to the
sender. Basically, this is how TCP works. My article would end here were it not
for some parameters of TCP connections that make things very interesting and
complicated. (To some, those attributes are the same.) The first
perturbation stems from the network itself, and materialises in the form
of three parameters that pertain to every TCP connection.

<ol>
<li> Bandwidth<br>
     The bandwidth indicates how many bits per time frame the link can
     transport. It is usually denoted by <em>Mbit/S</em> or <em>kbit/S</em> and limited
     by the hardware.
     Most people think that this indicates solely the performance of the network link.
     This is not quite true, as I will explain shortly.</li>
<li> Round-Trip Time (RTT)<br>
     Consider a network link between points A and B. The time a packet needs
     to travel from A to B and then back to A is called the Round-Trip Time. The
     RTT is highly variable, especially when a node on the way experiences
     congestion. Typically, you have an RTT from milliseconds to seconds (in the
     worst case).</li>
<li> Packet loss<br>
     Packets of a network transmission can get dropped. The ratio of lost
     packets to transported packets is called packet loss. There are many
     reasons for packet loss. A router might be under heavy load, a frame might
     get corrupted by interference (wireless networks like to drop packets this
     way), or an Ethernet switch may detect a wrong checksum.
     </li>
</ol>

So, you see that a 1000 Mbit/s link will get you nowhere if it has 25% packet loss
and an RTT of several seconds. The overall speed of your transmission depends on
all three parameters. Your local Ethernet is (with luck) fine, because it has
100 Mbit/s, 0% packet loss and RTTs below 1 millisecond. As soon as the RTT
rises, the management of the packets "in flight", i.e., the ones sent but not yet
acknowledged by the receiver, determine the real throughput of the data.
RTT and bandwidth are often combined and multiplied into the <em>bandwidth-delay product</em>.
</p>
<p>
How does TCP manage the parameter settings? Fortunately the protocol has some auto-tuning
properties. One important parameter is the <em>TCP window</em>. The window is
the amount of data the sender can send before receiving
an acknowledgement. This means that, as long as the window is "not full", the sender
can blindly keep sending packets. As soon as the window is filled, the sender stops
sending, and waits for acknowledgement packets. This is TCP's main mechanism of
flow control, that enables it to detect bottlenecks in the network during a
transmission. That's why it's also called the <em>congestion window</em>.
The default window size varies. Usually Linux starts at 32 kB.
<!-- I did not find a good source for the default window size. 32 kB seems to be common. -->
The window size is flexible, and can be changed during the transfer. This mechanism is
called <em>window scaling</em>. Starting with Linux kernel 2.6.17, the window can
be up to 4 MB. The window can grow only as long as there is no packet loss.
That's one of the reasons why data throughput is reduced on lossy network links.
</p>
<p>
TCP has some more interesting features, but I won't go into more details. We now know
enough, for the features of the Linux kernel I wish to describe.

<h3>
Always look on the WAN side of life
</h3>

<p>
The right size of the TCP window is critical to efficient transmission. The
tricky part is to find that right size. Either a too-small and a too-big window
will degrade throughput. A good guess is the use the bandwidth-delay product.
Furthermore, you can base estimates on periodically measured RTT or packet
loss, and make it dynamic. This is why several researchers have explored algorithms to help TCP
tune itself better, under certain circumstances. Beginning with 2.6.13, the Linux kernel 
supports plugins for the TCP stack, and enables
switching between algorithms depending on what the system is connected to. The
first strategy on the Internet was TCP Tahoe, proposed in 1988. A later variant was TCP Reno, now
widely implemented in network stacks, and its successor TCP NewReno.
Currently, the Linux kernel includes the following algorithms (as of kernel 2.6.19.1):
<ul>
<li> High Speed TCP<br>
     The algorithm is described in RFC 3649. The main use is for connections with
     large bandwidth and large RTT (such as Gbit/s and 100 ms RTT).</li>
<li> H-TCP<br>
     H-TCP was proposed by the Hamilton Institute for transmissions that recover more
     quickly after a congestion event. It is also designed for links with high bandwidth and RTT.</li>
<li> Scalable TCP<br>
     This is another algorithm for WAN links with high bandwidth and RTT. One of its design goals
     is a quick recovery of the window size after a congestion event. It achieves this goal by
     resetting the window to a higher value than standard TCP.</li> 
<li> TCP BIC<br>
     BIC is the abbreviation for Binary Increase Congestion control. BIC uses a unique window
     growth function. In case of packet loss, the window is reduced by a multiplicative factor.
     The window size just before and after the reduction is then used as parameters for a binary
     search for the new window size. BIC was used as standard algorithm in the Linux kernel.
     </li>
<li> TCP CUBIC<br>
     CUBIC is a less aggressive variant of BIC (meaning, it doesn't steal as much throughput from
     competing TCP flows as does BIC).
     </li>
<li> TCP Hybla<br>
     TCP Hybla was proposed in order to transmit data efficiently over satellite links
     and "defend" the transmission against TCP flows from other origins.
     </li>
<li> TCP Low Priority<br>
     This is an approach to develop an algorithm that uses excess bandwidth for TCP flows.
     It can be used for low priority data transfers without "disturbing" other TCP
     transmissions (which probably don't use TCP Low Priority).
     </li>
<li> TCP Tahoe/Reno<br>
     These are the classical models used for congestion control. They exhibit the typical slow start
     of transmissions. The throughput increases gradually until it stays stable. It is decreased as
     soon as the transfer encounters congestion, then the rate rises again slowly. The window is
     increased by adding fixed values. TCP Reno uses a multiplicative decrease algorithm for 
     the reduction of window size. TCP Reno is the most widely deployed algorithm.
     </li>
<li> TCP Vegas<br>
     TCP Vegas introduces the measurement of RTT for evaluating the link quality. It uses additive increases and
     additive decreases for the congestion window.
     </li>
<li> TCP Veno<br>
     This variant is optimised for wireless networks, since it was designed to handle random packet loss better. It tries
     to keep track of the transfer, and guesses if the quality decreases due to congestion or random packet errors.
<li> TCP Westwood+<br>
     Westwood+ addresses both large bandwidth/RTT values and random packet loss together with dynamically changing
     network loads. It analyses the state of the transfer by looking at the acknowledgement packets. Westwood+ is a
     modification of the TCP Reno algorithm.
     </li>
</ul>
This is only a rough outline of the modules. In case you want to understand what the algorithms do, you should
read the authors' publications. I have given links to most of them at the end of this article. While
investigating the algorithms and hunting for publications, I also came across
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?type=Technical%20Report&id=940">CTCP</a>, created
by Microsoft Research Asia. I wonder if this will make its way into the Linux kernel, some day.
</p>
<p>
Switching between the different algorithms can be easily done, by writing text to a <tt>/proc/</tt> entry.
<pre>
nightfall:~# echo "westwood" &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_congestion_control 
nightfall:~# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_congestion_control 
westwood
nightfall:~# 
</pre>
A list of available modules can be found here:
<pre>
nightfall:~# ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/net/ipv4/
ip_gre.ko  netfilter   tcp_cubic.ko      tcp_htcp.ko   tcp_lp.ko        tcp_vegas.ko
ipip.ko    tcp_bic.ko  tcp_highspeed.ko  tcp_hybla.ko  tcp_scalable.ko  tcp_veno.ko
nightfall:~# 
</pre>
When writing to <tt>/proc/</tt>, you can skip the <tt>tcp_</tt> prefix. If you compile your own 
kernels, you will find the modules in the <em>Networking -&gt; Networking options -&gt; TCP:
advanced congestion control</em> section. Since some of the algorithms affect only the sender's side,
you may not notice a difference when enabling them. In order to see changed behaviour,
you have to create a controlled setup, and measure the parameters of TCP transmissions.
</p>

<h3>
Testing congestion situations
</h3>

<p>
Now that we know how to control the congestion algorithms, all we need is a bottleneck. As long
as your Linux box(es) are connected to the local Ethernet with 100 Mbit/s or more, all packets
will be sent immediately, and your local queues are always empty. The queues end up on your
modem or gateway, which may treat them differently 
from the way Linux does. Even if you use a Linux gateway, there won't be a queue there, because very often
this gateway connects via Ethernet to another device that handles the Internet connection. If you want
to know what Linux does with queues, you need to set up a controlled bottleneck between two or more
Linux boxes. Of course, you can try to saturate your LAN, but your core switch and your colleagues
might not be impressed.
</p>
<p>
<img src="misc/pfeiffer/bottleneck.png" alt="Artificial bottleneck between networked Linux systems." width="468" height="159">
</p>
<p>
You can use two separate routers and connect them with serial crossover cables. You can set up two
Linux boxes as routers, and create the bottleneck link with USB 1.1 crossover cabling, serial links,
Bluetooth devices, 802.11b/g WLAN equipment, parallel links, or slower Ethernet cards
(10 Mbit/s, for example). You could also do traffic shaping in-between,
and reduce the bandwidth or increase the latency. The Linux kernel has a nice tool for doing this.
It's called <em>netem</em>, which is short for Network Emulator. Recent distributions have it. In case
you compile your own kernels, you'll find it here:
<pre>
 Networking --&gt;
   Networking Options --&gt;
     QoS and/or fair queuing --&gt;
        Network emulator
</pre>
Additionally, you need to enable the <em>Advanced Router</em> config option. netem can be activated by the 
<tt>tc</tt> tool from the <em>iproute</em> package. It allows you to
<ul>
<li> emulate WAN links,</li>
<li> create packet loss,</li>
<li> create packet duplication,</li>
<li> reorder packets as they are routed,</li>
<li> and corrupt packets.</li>
</ul>
So, let's say you have a Linux router, and wish to simulate a WAN environment by increasing the RTT, adding
packet reordering and some corruption of bits. You do this by entering the following commands:
<pre>
tc qdisc add dev eth1 root netem corrupt 2.5% delay 50ms 10ms
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem delay 100ms reorder 25% 50%
</pre>
This means that network device <tt>eth1</tt> corrupts 2.5% of all packets passing through it. Additionally,
all packets get delayed by 50ms 10ms. Device <tt>eth1</tt> introduces a delay of at least 100 ms for reordered
packets. 25% of the packets will be sent immediately. The 50% indicates a correlation between random reordering
events. You can combine different <a href="http://linux-net.osdl.org/index.php/Netem">netem options</a>. Make sure
that you enter only one <tt>tc</tt> command for every network device with all options and parameters attached.
<tt>netem</tt> is a network queue, and can only be installed once for every network device. You can remove it
any time you want, though.
</p>

<h3>
Creating traffic and measuring TCP
</h3>

<p>
After your new and shiny bottleneck works, you can start moving data from one end to the other. Every
program that speaks TCP can be used for that. <tt>iperf</tt>, <tt>netpipe</tt>, any FTP client, <tt>netcat</tt>,
or <tt>wget</tt> are good tools. Recording the network flows with <tt>wireshark</tt> and to postprocess them
with <tt>tcptrace</tt> is also an option. <tt>wireshark</tt> has some features that allow you to analyse
a TCP connection such as creating a graph of RTT values, sequence numbers, and throughput -- though a real
evaluation for serious deployment must use a finer resolution and a better statistic than simple progress bars.
</p>
<p>
You can also do in-kernel measurement by using the module <em>tcpprobe</em>. It is available when the kernel
is compiled with kernel probes that provide hooks to kernel functions (called Kprobe support). <em>tcpprobe</em>
can be enabled by loading it with <em>modprobe</em> and giving a TCP port as module option. The documentation
of <em>tcpprobe</em> features a simple example:
<pre>
# modprobe tcpprobe port=5001
# cat /proc/net/tcpprobe &gt;/tmp/data.out &amp;
# pid=$!
# iperf -c otherhost
# kill $pid
</pre>
<em>tcpprobe</em> gets loaded and is bound to port 5001/TCP. Reading <tt>/proc/net/tcpprobe</tt> directly
gives access to the congestion window and other parameters of the transmission. It produces one line of 
date in text format
for every packet seen. Using port 0 instead of 5001 allows measuring
the window of all TCP connections to the machine. The Linux network people have more tips for
<a href="http://linux-net.osdl.org/index.php/TCP_testing">testing TCP</a> in their wiki. Also, be sure
to familiarise yourself with the methods and tools, in case you plan to do some serious testing.

<h3>
I'm on ADSL. Does it really matter?
</h3>

<p>
Most of the new TCP algorithms incorporated into the Linux kernel were designed for very specific 
purposes. The modules are no magic bullet. If you are connected to a 56k modem, then no congestion algorithm
in the Universe will give you more bandwidth than your modem can handle. However, if multiple TCP flows have to share 
the same link, then some algorithms give you more throughput than others. The best way to find out is to
create a test environment with defined conditions, and make comparisons on what you see. My intention was
to give you an overview of what's going on in the kernel, and how flexible Linux is when dealing with
variable network environments. Happy testing!

Author's footnote
</h3>

<p>
The only reason that I mentioned the religious Linux/*BSD discussion is the fact of being
at a party and talking with friends. I don't wish to imply that one OS is better than the
other. You can solve and create all your problems with both systems. Keep in mind that TCP
really is a can of worms that get very complex, and that the developers of all Free operating
systems deserve a lot of recognition and thanks for dealing with these issues.

<h3>It Works For Me</h3>

<p>Don't you hate it when you have a problem, only to be told, "On my
machine, it just works"? I know I do. So when Ben Okopnik wrote in
Linux Gazette #127:</p>

<pre>
 [ I do a lot of travelling, and connect to a wide variety of
   strange WLANs. In my experience, at least, connecting to a
   wireless LAN with Linux is usually just as simple as Edgar
   describes. -- Ben ]
</pre>

<p>This motivated me to solve a long-standing problem: I could not
connect to "open" wifi access points.  I had no trouble at all with
closed access points; someone gives me the ESSID and the WEP key, and
I'm on.  But plop me down at a hotel, airport, or coffee shop, and no
amount of fiddling would get me connected.</p>

<p>So, being determined, I wrote to Ben and offered to write this
article, if The Answer Gang would help me troubleshoot my problem.  Ben
and the Gang held up their end of the bargain, so here is my tale.</p>

<h3>The Approach</h3>

<p>First, a word about my specific configuration, so you'll have a shot at
changing things to suit your particular setup.  I am running on a Dell
C600 laptop, with an unsupported wifi card built in.  I therefore use
a PCMCIA card, a Microsoft MN-520.  The machine boots into Debian
Sarge, with all current updates.</p>

<p>Since I could easily connect to any closed access point (AP), I knew
that the hardware, driver, and networking layers were all working.  My
problem was almost certainly a configuration issue.</p>

<p>The main config file for Debian is the /etc/network/interfaces file.
My work configuration included the ESSID and WEP key, which should not
be needed for an open AP.  So I stripped the config file down to a
minimum:</p>

<pre>
    iface wlan0 inet dhcp
	wireless-mode managed
</pre>	

<p>Now, a trip to the coffee shop, and see what we get in /var/log/messages:</p>

<pre class="code">
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 6
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 12
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 11
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 21
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 7
localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on wlan0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 4
localhost dhclient: No DHCPOFFERS received.
localhost dhclient: No working leases in persistent database - sleeping.
</pre>

<p>Not much of use to me here.  A bit of googling shows that my machine
is broadcasting a request for an address, but is not getting any
answers.</p>

<p>In Ben's first email to me, he included a sample of successful IP
address negotiation:</p>

<pre class="code">
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: starting at (uptime 0 days, 2:43:09)
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: PUMP: sending discover
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: got dhcp offer

Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: next server: 10.0.0.1

Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: dnsServers[0]: 10.0.0.1
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: numDns: 1
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: broadcast: 10.0.0.255
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: intf: network: 10.0.0.0
Fenrir pumpd[4711]: configured interface wlan0
</pre>

<p>Ben uses "pump" rather than "dhcpd", but you can clearly see his
machine sending a "discover" request, which is answered by the AP with
a "dhcp offer".  This is simply a suggested address, which your
machine is free to reject. (I don't know why you would, though.)</p>

<p class="editorial">[ It might taste a little strange, or smell 
sorta funky. Or perhaps you might already have an interface mapped to
that IP. One never knows. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> -- Ben ]</p>

<h3>When In Doubt, Use Brute Force</h3>

<p>Ken Thompson's aphorism is handy here.  I couldn't get a connection
via the automated tools, so I switched to a manual configuration.  I
knew I needed the ESSID for the AP network, so I started looking for
tools that could discover this without a connection.</p>

<p>First, I tried the <code>iwlist</code> command.  This tool uses the radio in the
WiFi card, and listens for what are known as "beacon" frames.  These
are simply broadcast messages that advertise the presence of an AP.
One problem with <code>iwlist</code> is that it's a one-shot tool; you get a list
of whatever happens to be broadcasting at the moment it listens.
While you can simply repeat the <code>iwlist</code> command, I felt more
comfortable with a tool that listens continuously.</p>

<p>That tool was Kismet.  I used APT to install it, but still had to
edit the config file (/etc/kismet/kismet.conf) to tell it to use my
HostAP-driven card.  Once configured, Kismet showed me a continuously
updated list of APs in my vicinity, and told me which ones were open
and which were masked (usually done simply by not broadcasting the
network ID, known as the SSID or ESSID).  Sure enough, one of the open
APs used the name of the coffee shop as its ESSID.</p>

<p>So, this means my machine can see the shop's AP.  Even the signal
strength looked good.  Why, then, couldn't I get any response to the
DHCPDISCOVER?</p>

<p>This meditation brings enlightenment: wifi is a radio system, and just
because I can hear the AP just fine does not mean that the AP can hear
me.  After all, an AP usually has a strong transmitter, but there's
only so much power a PCMCIA transmitter (like the one in my wifi card)
can send.</p>

<h3>Running Blind</h3>

<p>Since I can't change the power transmitted by my card, I moved closer
to the AP.  Now, I get:</p>

<pre class="code">
localhost pumpd[1275]: PUMP: sending discover 
localhost pumpd[1275]: got dhcp offer 
localhost pumpd[1275]: PUMP: sending second discover
localhost cardmgr[1068]: + Operation failed.
localhost cardmgr[1068]: + Failed to bring up wlan0.
</pre>

<p>(As you can see, I switched from dhcpd3 to pump, based on the Gang's
suggestions.)  This looks promising, since I now get an offer, but
now there's a "second discover" that fails.  What's that all about?</p>

<p>My guess is that the first discover is used to gather the AP
information (ESSID, etc.), which is then used to do the actual IP
address negotiation.</p>

<p>At this point, I was somewhat frustrated by the lack of information
contained in the logs.  But one reason I run Linux is because the
system keeps no secrets; you can always get more information, even if
you have to recompile the kernel.  It was time to stop running blind.</p>

<h3>TCPDUMP To The Rescue</h3>

<p>At this point, The Answer Gang was as starved for information as I
was.  They wanted to see <code>tcpdump</code> traces.  Tcpdump is a very low-level
network tool.  It monitors the underlying physical medium (ethernet,
radio, carrier pigeon, whatever is carrying the actual bits).</p>

<p>Tcpdump is normally run against an existing network interface, but
in my case I not only didn't have one yet, but also couldn't get one.
This was the whole object of my quest.  So the Gang shared the
incantation necessary: <code>tcpdump -vvv -i any</code>.  (You can use
more or fewer 'v' flags, for more or less detail.)</p>

</div>

<p>So now my sequence was: bring up the machine, start capturing the log
files, start tcpdump and save the output to a file, then insert the
card.</p>

<p>Having captured the failed traffic, I passed it along to the Gang.
(Ben wanted me to be sure and mention that copy and paste is the
preferred method for this; too often they get hand-transcribed data
that was corrupted by a fat finger.)  Since they did such a good job
of walking through the tcpdump data, I'm just going to copy and paste
it right here.</p>

<h3>The Gang Speaks</h3>

<p>The TCPDUMP output is indented by a '&gt;'; Ben Okopnik's explanation follows.</p>

<table summary="quote" border="1" style="background-color: lightgray">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
&gt; 15:08:58.385577 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 300
</pre>

<p>OK, there goes your "all stations" broadcast for DHCP.</p>

<pre>
&gt; 15:08:58.395954 arp who-has 169.254.1.51 tell 169.254.1.1
&gt; 15:08:58.397085 arp who-has 169.254.1.51 tell 169.254.1.1
&gt; 15:08:58.398200 arp who-has 169.254.1.51 tell 169.254.1.1
</pre>

<p>Wait a minute - I've just smelled a rat. 169.254.X.X? That's an IP
that's auto-assigned to an interface that requested a DHCP assignment
but failed; note that it's not assigned by the server but by your kernel
(google for 'APIPA' for more info; this is ridiculously common Windows
behavior, and I should have spotted it earlier.) The ARP request is the
standard "Before I assign this IP to this interface, is anyone else
using it?" check.</p>

<p>In other words, it looks like your system <em>never</em> acknowledges any
communication with the DHCP server other than the ESSID assignment. Even
that's probably being assigned by your own system, based on nothing more
than beacon detection.</p>

<p>Or... OK, this is silly - but could it be that the coffee shop server's
IP is actually set to be 169.254.1.1? In that case, your machine could
just be rejecting that assignment, and properly so: that /16 is a
reserved address range. Not 'reserved' as in '10.x.x.x' or
'192.168.x.x', but as in 'do not use for anything but failed DHCP
requests.'</p>

<p>It's a weird but possible explanation. Let's see if it holds up:</p>

<pre>
&gt; 15:09:02.080455 IP 169.254.1.1.bootps &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootpc: BOOTP/DHCP, Reply, length: 293
</pre>

<p>Well, <strong>something</strong> with an address of 169.254.1.1 actually does reply to you. <em>Tres</em> weird...</p>

<pre>
&gt; 15:09:02.083702 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 548
&gt; 15:09:06.083860 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 548
&gt; 15:09:13.082798 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 548
&gt; 15:09:19.895539 IP 169.254.1.31.53127 &gt; 255.255.255.255.2222: UDP, length: 106
</pre>

<p>...and something with <strong>another</strong> IP in the reserved
range (169.254.1.31) answers. Yeah, it's beginning to look like a
seriously misconfigured network.</p>

<pre>
&gt; 15:09:21.896457 IP 0.0.0.0.bootpc &gt; 255.255.255.255.bootps: BOOTP/DHCP, Request from 00:02:2d:74:4a:fa, length: 548
</pre>

<p>These are all replies from your machine - possibly saying "nope, can't
use that IP. How about something else?" - and that request never gets
honored. I'm not certain of this, but it seems likely.</p>
</td>

</table>

<p>I want to thank The Answer Gang for this analysis; I'd have spent
weeks looking up all these packets in the RFCs and other specs.</p>

<h3>Zeroconf</h3>

<p>At this point, it appears that the AP I'm trying to use is
misconfigured.  It is using an IP address range that is not supposed
to be used by anyone.  But stop and think; if this configuration is
invalid, how come other people can use the AP without error.  (I even
had a friend try it with his SUSE laptop and: "On that machine, it
just works".)</p>

<p>We need to dig some more.  At this point, I somehow dropped off the
email list for this issue, so I'll pick up the Gang's deliberations in
progress.  Kapil Hari Paranjape thought my tcpdump was capturing a
"zeroconf" session.  Here's his explanation:</p>

<pre> 
   Under "zeroconf" (RFC 3927) two machines can network if they use
   addresses in the range 169.254.0.0/16. So what may be happening here:

   1. The access point tries to communicate with you, using zeroconf.
   2. Provided you establish a zeroconf link, it then requires
   authentication information.
   3. Upon authentication, it provides a "real" DHCP address.

   So, you should allow DHCP to fail and then establish a zeroconf
   address picked "at random". (The zeroconf package in Debian does
   this.)
</pre>

<p>The bit about "authentication" seems to apply to systems that are not
truly open; airports, for example, often require that you pay for
connectivity via a Web page.  So you'd get a temp IP via zeroconf,
then go anywhere with your browser.  This request is redirected to the
"pay first" page.  Once you've paid, you get a "real" IP address and
are on the Net.</p>

<p>At this point, I started looking at Debian support for Zeroconf.  It
turns out that full zeroconf is only in "unstable", and I prefer not
to use that.  Debian stable includes a "zcip" tool which is supposed
to handle exactly this problem, so I installed that.</p>

<p>But to no avail.  I was able to get a bit further, and had a "real" IP
address, but I was not able to get to the outside world.  So close...</p>

<h3>Worldcon</h3>

<p>At this point, the opinion of the Gang was that this was a seriously
broken coffee shop, and that I should take my trade elsewhere.  Also
at this point, I took a vacation to the World Science Fiction
Convention in Anaheim, California.  My first stop was the Salt Lake
City airport, which has an open wifi network.  You are required to pay
for it, but I thought I could at least test the connectivity portion.</p>

<p>And guess what?  "On my machine, it just worked right out of the box."
I hate that answer.</p>

<p>I tried this experiment again with the hotel wifi network, and it just
worked again.</p>

<p>At this point, I realized that my goal was achieved: I could
connect to open wifi AP's.  True, I could not connect to that lone
coffee shop, but that appeared to be their problem.  Or, perhaps just
incomplete zeroconf support in Debian.</p>

<p>I was also able to enlist the help of a local network engineer, who
took his Linux laptop down to the coffee shop.  When he, too, failed
to connect, I felt confident that this was just a problem with the AP.
While it might be educational to keep after that AP until I figure out
what's going on, that was not my original goal.</p>

<h3>The Proof of the Pudding ...</h3>

<p>... is in the tasting.  My friend the network guy recommended another
coffee shop that he used regularly.  And guess what?  It just worked.</p>

<p>So here are the log file captures showing my final result:</p>

<p>From /var/log/daemon.log:</pre>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Initially, I had been unable to connect to any of several APs that
I had tried.  Then, the one I picked for a concentrated debug session
turned out to be misconfigured.  But I finally got it all working, and
the next time an open AP fails me, I'll know it's not my fault.  More
important, I'll know how to see what's going on, and have a good
chance of fixing it.</p>

<p>But this does illustrate some things that are unique to the Linux
community and Free Software in general.  The most obvious benefit is
the existence of such groups as The Answer Gang.  While there's no
guarantee that anyone will help you with your specific problem, it is
much more likely to happen than with any proprietary product, even if
you pay for a support contract.</p>

<p>The next important difference is how transparent Linux is.  I could
easily trace the kernel activity from the moment I inserted the PCMCIA
card until I had my real IP address.  I also have confidence that this
level of transparency is always available, since I have the source
code to every bit of software involved.  Access to source might not
help a non-programmer, but simply adding some "kprintf" statements to
a driver is really not that hard a task.  That freedom allows me to
add transparency where none may have existed before.</p>

<p>And last, I think you have to recognize how powerful choice is when
debugging.  At each step, I had several choices of tools to use.  When
<code>iwlist</code> wasn't working for me, I could easily swap in Kismet.</p>

<p>I can't thank The Answer Gang enough for their help.  Robert Heinlein
told people to "pay it forward".  So, I hope the next person with this
sort of trouble will find my article and get the help they need.</p>

<em>
<p>
Samuel Kotel Bisbee-vonKaufmann was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA
area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age
of 10, Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science
and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a
href="http://www.oftc.org">http://www.oftc.org</a>), had his first article
published, and became more involved in various communities and projects.
</p>

<p>
Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?
</p>

<p>
Sam prefers programming in C++ and Bash, is fluent in Java and PHP, and while
he can work in Perl, he hates it. If you would like to know more then feel free
to ask.
