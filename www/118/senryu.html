<p>Many moons ago we published <a href="../issue46/orr.html">excerpts</a> from a
Salon contest for computer-related haiku.  I read them again recently and
they're still as hilarious as ever.  To make Linux a little more fun, I'd like
to start a column of reader-submitted senryu and haiku.  (The difference is
explained below.)  Here's my own mediocre set of
poems to start things off, with some help from The Answer Gang.</p>

<p> If you seek fame and fortune (or at least fame), send your Linux-related
haiku to <img alt="mso at oz.net" src="../gx/authors/email/orr.png"> and you
may see them in the next issue.  Read on for background and guidelines.</p>

<h2>Senryu vs. haiku, and the syllable myth</h2>

<p> Astute readers will notice these are really senryu rather than haiku.  A <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">haiku</a>  is traditionally about a
season of the year.  A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senryu">senryu</a>
has the same form but is dark humor.  Most of what has been called haiku in the
Unix and Perl worlds is senryu.</p>

<p> The second thing to note is, the 5-7-5 syllable thing you learned in
school is rubbish.  I was taught that a haiku is a poem with five syllables in
the first line, seven in the second, and five in the third.  That was just a
trick to get us to learn syllables.  In the original Japanese form the 5-7-5
are not syllables but 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mora%2C_linguistics">morae</a>.
A mora is a linguistic unit smaller than a syllable, which doesn't apply in
English well.  'cat' has two morae, does that make sense?  So haikus with 5-7-5
syllables end up being longer than the form intended.  To keep to the spirit of
the original, author William Higginson and others <A
HREF="http://www.haiku.insouthsea.co.uk/form.htm">recommend</a> approximately
eleven syllables total for American English, and six stressed syllables for
British English.  (The difference is because American speakers "give fuller
value to each syllable than British speakers do. Their tone is more even.
British speakers emphasise some syllables, swallow others to nothing, and their
sentences come out with lifts and dips like the flight of a sparrow. In
consequence, American poets can make successful use of syllabics as the basis
of a rhythm, and many have done so, but British poets have not.  British
speakers use a stress-patterned prosody.")  Note that 11 suggests 3-5-3
syllables, and 5+7+5 = 17.</p>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p> Here are some general guidelines for LG senryu/haiku:</p>

<ul style="padding-bottom:10px">
<li> The main goal is to be short and sweet, to express a
complete thought in as few words as possible.
<li> Poems should have three lines of <em>approximately</em> eleven syllables
total / six stressed syllables total.</li>
<li> Line breaks should be at natural pauses.  <em>Do not</em> add filler words
to reach the magic 5-7-5 number, or worse, break the sentence in an awkward
place.</li>
<table style="margin: 10px 40px 10px 40px">
<tr><td>
Poems that break in<br />
awkward places suck ass.  This<br />
would be rejected.
</td></tr></table>
<li> It's better to delete words than add them.</li>
<li> The most important thought (the climax) normally goes on the last line.
The other two lines set the stage.
</ul>

<p> To add elements of traditional haiku:</p>

<ul>
<li> Include a season word (spring, summer, fall, or winter) or a word
associated with a season (awakening, suntan, harvest, snow).</li>
<li> Make line 1 or 3 very different, so that two consecutive lines go
together, with a greater pause around them.  In Japanese there would be a
grammatical particle at the break (like verbal punctuation), but English has no
such thing.</li>
<li> Include some Zen philosophy.</li>
<li> Often line 1 sets the scene, line 2 introduces the character, and line 3
shows the action.
</ul>
