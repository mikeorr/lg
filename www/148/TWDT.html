Hello Ben,
</p>

<p>
I thought you might be interested in the information below on a
six-year-old virus that is still causing problems for Linux users.  In
fact, the problem is so common that 70 percent of Linux infections are
because of the virus.  In response to this problem, Sophos has made
available a free detection tool for Linux users to determine if they are
infected by the virus. 
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in discussing this virus with Sophos, don't hesitate
to contact me.  
</p>

<p>
Best,
</p>

<p>

<p>
      Six Year Anniversary for Linux Virus Rst-B - Are You Infected?
</p>

<p>
          Sophos Makes Available Detection Tool for Linux Users
</p>

<p>
IT security and control firm Sophos is warning Linux users of the
importance of properly securing their Linux systems, following findings
from SophosLabs(TM) that a long established threat, known as Linux/Rst-B,
is still infecting computers and servers.
</p>

<p>
Analysis of malware has shown almost 70 percent of the infections are due
to this six-year-old malicious program. Today, SophosLabs has made freely
available a small detection tool to help Linux users find out whether they
are unwittingly infected with this virus.
</p>

<p>
Linux servers are very valuable to hackers, according to SophosLabs
experts. Servers, by their nature, are rarely turned off and often found
to be running no or insufficient protection against malware attacks. This
makes the Linux systems ideal candidates for the role of controller in a
botnet - the central control point when creating and managing an army of
infected computers, known as bots or zombies. Where Linux systems are most
often found to be running as a server, Windows machines are more
frequently used at home or as a desktop machine in an office, and these
computers are regularly switched off. This makes them less attractive as
controllers, but ideal as bots or zombies.
</p>

<p>
Hackers typically gain control via weak SSH password or some other
vulnerability. Once in, they install IRC based malware and use IRC
channels to control their bots.
</p>

<p>
"The number of malware in existence is around 350,000, and while only a
teeny number of these target Linux, it seems as though hackers are taking
advantage of this false sense of security," said Carole Theriault, senior
security consultant at Sophos. "It was very surprising to see that a
six-year-old virus seems to be responsible for a large proportion of the
malware collating in our Linux honeypot, and we hope that Linux users who
aren't running security will at least run this tool to find out if they
are infected with this granny virus."
</p>

<p>
Information on the Linux/Rst-B detection tool is available on the
SophosLabs blog. Sophos underlines that running the detection tool will
only detect versions of Linux/Rst-B.

Quoting Mike Orr (sluggoster@gmail.com):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Found this in the EULA for MSN Messenger accounts:
&gt; 
&gt; """
&gt; Potentially Unwanted Software
&gt; 
&gt; If you remove or disable "spyware", "adware"  and other potentially
&gt; unwanted software ("potentially unwanted software"), it may cause
&gt; other software on your computer to stop working, and it may cause you
&gt; to breach a license to use other software on your computer (such as
&gt; where the other software installed the potentially unwanted software
&gt; on your computer as a condition for your use of the other software).
&gt; By using the features of the service intended to help you remove or
&gt; disable potentially unwanted software, it is possible that you will
&gt; also remove or disable  software that is not potentially unwanted
&gt; software. If a feature of the service prompts you before removing or
&gt; disabling potentially unwanted software, you are solely responsible
&gt; for selecting which potentially unwanted software the service removes
&gt; or disables.  Before authorizing the removal of any potentially
&gt; unwanted software, you should read the license agreements for the
&gt; potentially unwanted software.
&gt; """
&gt; 
&gt; LICENSE AGREEMENTS for spyware???  I'm supposed to recognize what kind
&gt; of spyware has been surreptitiously been installed on my computer, and
&gt; know where its license agreement is?
&gt; 
&gt; Fancy Microsoft discouraging people from eradicating spyware, and
&gt; threatening them with a potential license violation if they do.
</pre>

<p>
You're misreading what they're saying, here, and in consequence being a
bit unfair to our Redmondian friends.
</p>

<p>
They're saying that MSN Messenger service includes some <em>anti-spyware</em>
features that might, in the process of doing its job, might accidentally
disable some process you <em>want</em> to have continue to run.  It says that
the anti-spyware system monitor will pop up a screen asking you to vet 
what it wants to disable, and the responsibility's totally on you if you
say "yes" and end up turning off something you later regret having
disabled.
</p>

<p>
This reflects, in part, the pernicious way in which legitimate
MS-Windows software has become at best poorly distinguishable from
adware/spyware, and it's not unknown for the one to come bundled with
the other, and for various (nominally legitimate) proprietary software
packages to "phone home" information about the user, permission for
which chicanery the user usually but not always has "consented to"
(nominally) via misleadingly worded clauses in their licence agreements.
</p>

<p>
For perspective, it's also not unknown for this sort of treacherous
behaviour to occur in proprietary applications for Linux.  That's why,
for example, my nameserver resolves the "remoteapproach.com" domain
locally, because, even though I wouldn't touch Adobe Acrobat Reader with
a ten-foot pole or an 11-foot Swede, visitors to my house sometimes do.

<a href="https://thomas.apestaart.org/thomas/trac/wiki/projects/savon">https://thomas.apestaart.org/thomas/trac/wiki/projects/savon</a> has:
<pre class='code'>
  What is Savon? 
 
  Savon is a program that allows you to store parts of a file system in
  Subversion. It manages file contents, permissions, owner and group (by
  name, not by id), and even SELinux security context. Layers allow re-use
  of files among different hosts.
 
  The command-line tool, savon, tries to follow svn in spirit as closely
  as possible in expected behaviour, output, ... Of course, there are
  different commands for the additional functionality, but your knowledge
  of svn will carry over into your use of savon. (One important exception
  is the add command, which is non-recursive by default. svn chose to make
  this recursive, in contrast to CVS, and many a user has made the mistake
  of adding a whole subtree to subversion when they just wanted one
  directory added.)
 
  What can I use it for? 
 
      * Use it to store configuration files, scripts, and other local
        modifications for your one or more Unix hosts
      * Use it to manage clusters of machines that share roles and can
        thus share configuration from one central repository
      * Use it to store the same type of information from your user
        directory, again allowing you to share parts of these directory
        layouts among multiple machines 
 
  High-level overview 
 
  Savon allows you to manage a part of your file system in an overlay.
  This part can be the whole filesystem or root, or your home directory,
  or something else.
 
  This overlay is split up into one more more layers. The layers are
  stacked top to bottom to represent the tree of revisioned nodes. If a
  node is present in more than one layer, the version in the top-most
  layer is used.
 
  Typically, you would use a separate overlay for each host, and then
  share common files in a layer. For example, on my home network, but also
  on hosts of family and friends I maintain, I use the bottom-most layer
  for files that should be the same on all hosts. This includes for
  example authorized_keys for ssh, so that I can log in to every machine.
  The layer above that is used for files that are related to the local
  network configuration; for example, yum configuration files pointing to
  local directories.
 
  The top-level layer gets used for the host-specific files, including
  interface definitions, a host ChangeLog, ...
 
  Having separate layers thus makes it easy to share configuration and
  files between machines. 
</pre>

<p>
A fellow Linux user group mailing list member speculated that Savon
might be more suitable than Joey Hess's etckeeper for non-.deb-based
systems such as RHEL / CentOS / Mandrake / PCLinuxOS / Gentoo / etc.,
because etckeeper is hooked into apt/dpkg so as to capture changes to /etc
resulting from package operations.  Having not tried etckeeper on a non-.deb
system, I couldn't speak to that, but pass along his comment.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Joey has merged patches that permit etckeeper to be
back-ended by Mercurial, so one can now elect that version control
system rather than git, if one prefers.

I usually leave file names as they are unless I have reason to suspect
something nasty in them (like a forward slash, which is the only
character that's not allowed in filenames - at least in Unix). If I'm
going to process them at all, I make it simple:
</p>

<pre>
tr/A-Za-z0-9/_/cs;
</pre>

<p>
This replaces any characters that don't appear in the first list with an
underscore, and squashes any repeated underscores. If I'm feeling
especially energetic, I might add the following:
</p>

<pre>
s/^_?(.*?)_?$/$1.html/;
</pre>

<p>
This will remove any leading/trailing underscores from the result. It's
also a good place to add the '.html' extension.

<p>
This last line may be standard practice in C, etc., but it's unnecessary
(and deprecated) in Perl. The same is true for the parens in your
'open', 'close', and 'rename' calls: punctuation that doesn't have a
specific reason for being there should be omitted.

Hello,

<p>
I have a directory named "Book Reviews", so when I try to CD to it using:

<pre>
$ cd /media/sda5/Writings\ \&amp;\ Presentations/Book Reviews

<p>
I get:

<p>
of course, I do not have a directory named 'Book'

I then come across this
<a href="http://librenix.com/?inode=7041">http://librenix.com/?inode=7041</a>

I got away with it after using:

Is there any other way other to deal with spaces?

Sir,

<p>
	I have visited your web-site for squid configuration reference. It's
really helpful for me. Because i'm new to squid. Also i'm having a doubt
regarding squid. The main purpose of the squid is load-balancing &amp;
security which hides our webserver from outside world. I'm going to put
a two web server behind my squid. Where can I mention my web servers in
squid configuration. and how I can test that my squid is refering my two
servers if it's not having the cache. Please let me to know about it.
I'm using squid 2 as my reverse proxy and Apache as my web servers with
platform RHEL 4 u 4.  Thanking you,

<p>
I have done a fair bit of my own "second guessing of the user" in the 
past, and where it comes to the g++ folks they generally get it right.  
Be that as it may, there is a rather irritating  and dangerous 
compile-time warning in g++ version 4.1.2.  that is to me, an ideal 
example of where acting with the best intention to protect the user from 
his own stupidity can backfire.
</p>

<p>
A pure virtual base class, or interface class definition is used when 
one would like to use the class definition without having access in any 
way to the implementation.  Typically, a factory function creates 
objects of this type, and another factory function may be used to 
destroy them.  One cannot use the 'new' keyword to create, or the 
'delete' keyword to destroy objects of this type, as the object 
definition has no public constructor or destructor, and no base 
implementation for the virtual methods.  However, one may call the 
objects methods; since they are all pure virtual declarations, one is 
guaranteed of their implementation in the subclass.
</p>

<p>
The following header is used to provide a pure virtual interface class 
and functions to create or delete instances of the class:
</p>

<pre>
class abc {
  public :
     virtual void if_method1()=0;
     virtual long if_method2()=0;
     virtual bool if_method3()=0;
     ...
};
 
abc *abc_factory_new();
void abc_factory_delete(abc *);
</pre>

<p>
when compiled, this emits the warning:
   ``  warning: 'class abc' has virtual functions but non-virtual 
destructor''
</p>

<p>
which is only partially true, as there is no declaration for a 
destructor at all (either virtual or non-virtual).  One might expect the 
following code to emit warnings both for the attempt to create an 
instance of 'abc' as well as the attempt to delete 'abc':
<pre>
int main() {
  abc *a = new abc();
  delete a;
}
</pre>

<p>
As it happens, we are warned when we try to create an instance of 'abc' 
(because of all the pure virtual functions) , but not warned at all when 
we delete the object directly.  It would appear that g++ assumes that 
the coder has made a mistake, and creates a default (public non-virtual) 
destructor for the class anyway, regardless that we excluded definitions 
for the destructor to prevent accidental deletion.  To add insult to 
injury, g++ then warns the coder that his [automatic] destructor is not 
virtual.
</p>

<p>
Just as well that it does warn you, since the destructor it 
automatically creates is not virtual, and therefore invoking delete 
against the virtual base class (which should have failed with a compiler 
error) would result in a potential memory leak.
</p>

<p>
The above warning is not a new one, and previous versions of the 
compiler would emit the warning when a destructor was declared as 
non-virtual in a class with virtual method declarations.  For example,

Good morning,
</p>

<p>
I am using Firefox 2.0.0.11 with Newsfox 0.8.3 to track your RSS feed at
&lt;<a href="../lg.rss&gt;">http://linuxgazette.net/lg.rss&gt;</a>. Since I know that updates only happen
once a month, I don't include LG in the regular refresh list, but check
it manually the first few days of each month until I get the update.
</p>

<p>
However, for the past four months, there have not been any dates on the
items in that feed. Therefore I have a mixed list with items from
multiple months and no useful way to sort it by date. Is that an issue
with the feed, or something on my end?
</p>

<p>
I do enjoy the Gazette. Although I started with SLS 1.02, I have been
using Slackware at home since '93, and Red Hat/Fedora at work for the
past two years. Unfortunately, we only have one small department using
Linux and have to struggle with MS-Windows for company wide tools.
</p>

<p>
Thank you,
</p>

Hey Everyone,
  A friend of mine asked the following question and as far as I know its 
not possible but if I am wrong please correct me.
</p>

<p>
  Basically what he wants to do is share files with windows systems over 
samba (with write/delete access) and restrict the number of files a user 
can delete at a time. So if a user (suramya) wanted to delete 2 files 
the system would let him delete it, but if he tried to delete 50 files 
it would stop it.
</p>

<p>
  What do you think? Is it possible? What I told him was that either you 
give a user delete access or not but you can't limit by the number of files.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way I have found to remove delete access is to remove the 
write access to the parent directory containing the files. But the 
downside of this is that the users can't add new files. In this case 
since the users are programmers they have to have the ability to add new 
files to the directory.
</p>

<p>
So what are his options?
</p>

Hi Ramon,
</p>

<p>
I didn't get round to discuss much of what you wrote with Daniel (Main
Admin around here). He keeps himself busy with fixing multiseat
machines  which got broken by upgrades....
 
As a first decision we are going to put out an order for a large
disk-raid system (max 24TB, initially 18 for budget reasons) which
we'll run as NFS fileserver and it will have to double as
backupsystem (two independent raid controllers) backing itself up,
configs from all clients and some smaller data amounts on local disks
plus homes on the then old fileserver.
</p>

<p>
If that disk space runs full we'll have hopefully new budget and can
think about tape solutions etc. Right now raw disc space is getting
scarce. 
</p>

<p>
The number crunchers are still not quite certain --- the Multicore AMD
is still on the wishlist, but delivery seems to be postponed and
postponed again. 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; If you're willing, we could also set up a call to discuss or 
&gt; alternatively use IRC ?
&gt; There's way too many options depending on setup discussion etc.
</pre>

<p>
Yes, I certainly would like to discuss a few things to see what might
be optimal solutions. 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; We've been through 4 generations of storage architecture including 
&gt; on-line but off-site backup.
</pre>


<p>
that "off-site" part is starting to worry me a bit. We have some
off-site backup but not everything by far. Mostly homes and the most
important written stuff (Programs, papers, etc.). Original measurement
data are just to huge for that off-site backup (*non* GB ethernet
doesn't help there).
</p>

Hi TAG,
I really enjoyed this article, just what I need! But there's only one
problem, the DMA on the hard-disk. I've always used a very
similar approach to the one mentioned in the article to set DMA
on on my disks, the problem is INIT doesn't actually start when
waking up from hibernation and so DMA is not set which makes
reading the image (and booting, therefore) a very painfully long
process. Any ideas on other ways to set DMA that don't involve
INIT?

There still not any good device mapper documentation out there, you page was

</p>

<p>
I am trying to do this.
</p>

<p>
 I have a loopback filesystem, that I am trying to snapshot.
</p>

<p>
so
</p>

<p>
myfile--------/dev/loop0
</p>

<p>
cow1--------/dev/loop1
cow2--------/dev/loop2
cow3--------/dev/loop3
cow4--------/dev/loop4
</p>

<p>
you document allowed me to a snapshot of /dev/loop0, and cow the changes to
/dev/loop1
</p>

<p>
can, I do the same with loop2,3,4?
</p>


<p>
i.e. I have 4 file system cow, from the same filesystem?
</p>

<p>
hope you can help, thanks for a great article.

&gt; I,ve read your article about measuring tcp congestion window. Maybe I
&gt; can ask you, how to use tcp_info structure in my Apache code (more
&gt; specifically in sendfile_it_all function in core_filters.c. I want to
&gt; get the time to transfer last byte sent in order to schedule the
&gt; packet sent to client according to that metric), cause I really realy
&gt; confused with the Apache source code. Or, do you know what part in
&gt; Apache that provide the time to transfer last by sent to client.
</pre>

<p>
The tcp_info structure contains statistics derived from an active TCP
connection. getsockopt() fills the structure with data. An example
function call from my article in #136 looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
getsockopt( tcp_work_socket, SOL_TCP, TCP_INFO, (void *)&amp;tcp_info,
&amp;tcp_info_length );
</pre>

<p>
I looked into the code for core_filters.c in a httpd 2.2.8 distribution.
Basically the sendfile_it_all() function reads a file and sends it to
the network by using sendfile(). There's not much you can tune there
since sendfile() does most of the buffering. You could periodically call
getsockopt() with the TCP_INFO option, but you'd only get the TCP
parameters. You cannot influence the TCP connection when it transfers
date, it is handled by the kernel. You can only use one of the TCP
congestions algorithms and set some parameters of the TCP stack (either
through /proc/sys/net/... or by using socket options such as TCP_CORK).
</p>

<p>
If you want to do any timing you have to do the buffering yourself, send
chunks of data and take the time after every buffer transmit. That's
what I did in my example code, but that's not what you want to do in
production code. The Linux kernel has the TCP stack and should deal with
the details. The kernel also keeps track of TCP parameters used with
recent clients. An application usually doesn't see all of this.
</p>

<p>
As far as the Apache code is concerned, I don't know where or whether
Apache stores the time of transfers. There are some options for the
socket code, so I'd look for the persistant connections (KeepAlive,
etc.) or all things that deal with the socket handling.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.

I usually leave file names as they are unless I have reason to suspect
something nasty in them (like a forward slash, which is the only
character that's not allowed in filenames - at least in Unix). If I'm
going to process them at all, I make it simple:
</p>

<pre>
tr/A-Za-z0-9/_/cs;

<p>
This replaces any characters that don't appear in the first list with an
underscore, and squashes any repeated underscores. If I'm feeling
especially energetic, I might add the following:
</p>

<pre>
s/^_?(.*?)_?$/$1.html/;
</pre>

<p>
This will remove any leading/trailing underscores from the result. It's
also a good place to add the '.html' extension.

&gt;         rename($_, "$title") or die "rename $_: $!\n";
&gt;     }
&gt; }
&gt; 
&gt; exit(0);
</pre>

<p>
This last line may be standard practice in C, etc., but it's unnecessary
(and deprecated) in Perl. The same is true for the parens in your
'open', 'close', and 'rename' calls: punctuation that doesn't have a
specific reason for being there should be omitted.

Hello,
</p>

<p>
This is a nice intro to screen.
</p>

<p>
As you might expect ... some additional pointers from a long time
screen user <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<pre>
1. Your method of binding the C-\ key to command might cause you
   grief. The suggested method is "escape ^\\".
 
   You can also bind a "function key" to the screen command with
   something like "bindkey -k &lt;keyname&gt; command". The list of
   &lt;keyname&gt;s can be found in "man -s5 termcap" under the section
   "String Capabilities". I use "F1" which is the F11 key. (It should
   have been F12 but that is for the window manager).
 
   You can also use some command like "escape ^^^" to
   override the default C-a being bound to the escape key.
   There currently seems to be no way to specify "no escape key" to
   screen which is a bit unfortunate!
 
2. You can also use "C-a '&lt;initial char(s) of window name&gt;" to switch
   to a window for example "C-a 'Eli" followed by enter will switch
   to that window.
</pre>

<p>
Some other things to have fun with in screen are "nethack mode" and
more seriously cut-and-paste and multi-user mode.
</p>

<p>
Regards,

Kapil.

Sir,
   
  I am a student of BE Electronics and communication, As a part of final
year cirriculum we have a subject in which we have to make a project. so
we choose to make a project in which we will measure performance of
various TCP variants like TCP tahoe, reno, new reno, sack etc with help
of netword emulator tool NISTnet. we have faced a problem that current
version of linux (fedora) uses sack but we want to use older version of
TCP like tahoe and reno etc so what should we do is there kernel
available where we could get this version and could install  them or is
that we just have to modify the codes in networkstack please tell us the
solution which is possible and also state that through which link will
we get the required kernels and the name of kernel if possible.
   
  Thanking you.
   
  H Jebaliya.

Loved the article, but what if you have DHCP and Linux Mint still doesn't
find the Internet (so no updates of new programs;{
Went to Network and filled in workgroup and machine names, my router hands
out IPs...System see's the hardware...do I have to Mount the eth0, and if so
how does one do that.
Thanks for the great web page, and in advance for your help. This is the 4th
Linux I've tried over the years, looks ALMOST easy enough for me!
This machine dual boots to Xp and that can see the Internet, home built
Athlon 1700 machine, multiple hard drives, wired to the router, and through
that to cable.

Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer [lynx at luchs.at]

</p>

<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>
While getting in touch with some colleagues who had a slight misfortune
with the dd command and image files, Google directed me to the "Right To
Your Own Devices" article in LG #114. The device mapper is indeed very,
very useful.
</p>

<p>
Image you have a big dump file created with dd from a whole disk.
</p>

<pre>
dd if=3D/dev/hda of=3D/mnt/usb/big_dump.img
</pre>

<p>
Now imagine your /dev/hda device was a disk with multiple partitions.
How can you access the partitions individually? Try the device mapper.
By using the dmsetup command directly you have to use offsets to get
to the right partition(s). There's an easier way. The command kpartx
can automatically create device mapper devices from a dumpfile. kpartx
is part of the "multipath-tools" package (at least on Debian, Ubuntu and
Gentoo). Create a loopback device backed by the image file and use
kpartx:
</p>

<pre>
losetup /dev/loop0 /mnt/usb/big_dump.img
kpartx -a /dev/loop0
</pre>

<p>
After that you will find the mapped devices for every partition in
/dev/mapper/. You can remove the devices by using the following command:
</p>

<pre>
kpartx -d /dev/loop0
</pre>

<p>
"kpartx -l /dev/loop0" gives you a list of the partitions with lines
that can be used in a dmsetup description table.
</p>

<p>
Make sure that your kernel and your device mapper utils match. Best use
recents versions or the ones from your distribution.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.
</p>

<p>

<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3>SCO may return from the Dead</h3>

<p>
Like a graveyard scene from an old B-movie, SCO is again rising as one of the UnDead.
</p>

<p>
A new cash infusion from a new set of partners will keep SCO from becoming
moribund. The funds, up to $100 million, are coming from New York-based
Stephen Norris Capital Partners and an undisclosed Middle Eastern investor.
This gives SCO additional funds for the upcoming trial date but at the cost
of privatizing the company and its assets.  This is a better attempt at
reorganization than the previous York Group proposal, which was deficient
on legal grounds. It also ejects the former CEO Darl McBride, with a tidy
sum and liability protection. Some comments on Slashdot and elsewhere have
suggested the arrangement may help hide any past links to Microsoft,
assuming there were any.
</p>

<p>
According to a February 15 posting on Groklaw, the new deal may better
provide for the "...avoidance of any antitrust worries Microsoft might
conceivably face from airing of linen." The Groklaw posting adds the
following concerns about the new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):
</p>

<p>
"Suitably insured, assuming they can find an insurance company stupid
enough to take on these liabilities, the company will go private and then
give its full and aggressive attention to raping and pillaging the FOSS
community some more with SCO's bogo lawsuits against Linux. Well, that's
how I read it. It is, of course, at least in part also a shot across the
bow of IBM. Still not interested in settling, the MOU fairly screams?"
</p>

<p>
But SCO doesn't actually have a $100M "War chest" from its new partners.
It's really a $5 million dollar deal with a $95 million line-of-credit,
subject to due diligence and discovery by the lenders. And the 'credit'
comes at a high interest rate.
</p>

<p>
Jim Zemlin, the president of the Linux Foundation, puts down the financial
threat more succinctly:
</p>

<blockquote>
"The terms of the proposal are publicly available with the court, and what
they show is that SCO would receive only $5 million dollars in cash - the
rest could only be drawn down at an exorbitant rate of more than 17%. Not a
very efficient cost of capital..."
</blockquote>

<p>
And if Novell and IBM prevail in court, SCO will owe a lot more than that.
</p>

<p>
See Groklaw on the MOU: <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080215072706542">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20080215072706542</a>

<h3>HP Promotes Open Source Software Governance</h3>

<p>
In an announcement regarding FOSSology and FOSSBazaar, HP will help
companies address the legal, financial and security risks faced when
adopting free and open source software (FOSS). To help enterprise customers
mitigate these kinds of risks and realize the full business benefits of
free and open source software, HP has introduced FOSSology and FOSSBazaar -
the industry's first open source initiatives dedicated to these goals. 
</p>

<p>
FOSSology is based on the tools HP uses to effectively manage its own use
of free and open source software. It is designed to help users address
deployment issues such as the acquisition, tracking and licensing of FOSS.
This toolset is free and downloadable from <a
href="http://FOSSology.org">FOSSology.org</a> for immediate use under the
General Public License (GPL) version two.
</p>

<p>
FOSSBazaar makes HP's expertise freely available to the software community
as part of a collaborative effort with industry-leading software vendors
and the Linux Foundation. Coverity, DLA Piper, Google, Novell, Olliance
Group, OpenLogic and SourceForge have joined HP to offer online resources,
educational documentation and community interaction to address FOSS
business issues and promote best FOSS governance practices.
</p>


<h3>INTEL Spearheads Fibre Channel over Ethernet</h3>
<p>
Intel has released a developer software initiator kit to create Fibre
Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) solutions for the Linux. FCoE is a
specification proposed by Cisco that will allow Fibre Channel SAN traffic
to run over Ethernet. Consolidating LAN and SAN traffic onto a single
fabric can simplify network infrastructure and reduce data center costs.
</p> 

<p>
As part of the package, Intel has included a target simulator, so Linux
developers can test and modify the FCoE software stack. <a
href="http://Open-FCoE.org">Open-FCoE.org</a> is open to all FCoE
developers for source code download, code contribution and feedback. (Click
<a href="misc/dyckoff/FibreChan-Ethernet-encapsulation.png">here</a> to see
a diagram.)
</p>

<p>
Layers above FC-2 remain unchanged so the same FC fabric and traffic
management are used to link existing SAN switches.
</p> 

<p>
Intel is leading the Ethernet Enhancements efforts in the IEEE Intel to
create a lossless Ethernet fabric. Intel expects that FCoE will be quickly
become an industry standard for network storage.
</p>

<p>
Jordan Plawner, Intel Storage Product Planner, told the Linux Gazette: "We
are taking Fibre Channel and putting it on top of an Ethernet transport so
the server and target only see Fibre Channel. Our approach is very
evolutionary, not revolutionary, and makes for a nice deployment."
</p> 

<p>
All major Linux distros have iSCSI initiators. Intel wants all OS's in the
future to ship with a stack that supports both iSCSI and FCoE.
</p> 

<p>
"Server virtualization, database growth and compliance requirements have
created a greater need for network storage," said Pat Gelsinger, senior
vice president and general manger of Intel's Digital Enterprise Group.
"FCoE makes it easier and less expensive to connect servers to the SAN.
... We expect the Open Source community to use this initiator stack to
create reliable, standards-based FCoE solutions for their customers."
</p>

<p>
The FCoE software package is now available for download at
<a href="http://www.Open-FCoE.org">http://www.Open-FCoE.org</a> and can be
modified according to the terms of the GPLv2 license. The FCoE
specification is expected to be completed in 2008.

folders, location bar that uses an algorithm based on site visit recency
and frequency (called 'frecency') to provide better matches against your
history and bookmarks for URLs and page titles, ability to register web
applications as protocol handlers, and better customization of download
actions for file types.
<li> Improved platform features such as: new graphics and font rendering
architecture, JavaScript 1.8, major changes to the HTML rendering engine to
provide better CSS, float-, and table layout support, native web page form
controls, colour profile management, and offline application support.
<li> Performance improvements such as: better data reliability for user
profiles, architectural improvements to speed up page rendering, over 350
memory leak fixes, a new XPCOM cycle collector to reduce entire classes of
leaks, and reductions in the memory footprint
</ul>

<p>
(You can find out more about all of these features in the "What's New"
section of the release notes.)

<h4>Sun to Acquire VirtualBox Developer innotek</h4>

<p>
Sun Microsystems has announced that it will purchase innotek, the provider
of the open source virtualization software called VirtualBox. By enabling
developers to more efficiently build, test, and run applications on multiple
platforms, VirtualBox will extend the Sun xVM platform onto the desktop and
strengthen Sun's leadership in the virtualization market.
</p>

<p>
With over four million downloads since January 2007, innotek's open source
VirtualBox product has been established as a leading developer desktop
virtualization platform. VirtualBox enables desktop or laptop PCs running
the Windows, Linux, Mac, or Solaris operating systems to run multiple
operating systems side-by-side, switching between them with just
a click of the mouse.
</p>

<p>
"VirtualBox provides Sun with the perfect complement to our recently
announced Sun xVM Server product," said Rich Green, executive vice
president, Sun Software. "Where Sun xVM Server is designed to enable
dynamic IT at the heart of the datacenter, VirtualBox is ideal for any
laptop or desktop environment and will align perfectly with Sun's other
developer focused assets such as GlassFish, OpenSolaris, OpenJDK and soon
MySQL as well as a wide range of community open source projects, enabling
developers to quickly develop, test, and deploy the next generation of
applications."
</p>

<p>
VirtualBox is open source, and can be freely downloaded without the hassle
of payment or frustrating license keys at <a
href="http://virtualbox.org">http://virtualbox.org</a> or <a
href="http://openxvm.org">http://openxvm.org</a>.
The download is less than 20 megabytes and is easily installed on any
modern x86 architecture laptop or desktop system running Windows, Linux,
Mac, or Solaris operating systems. Supported guest operating systems include
all versions of Windows from 3.1 to Vista, Linux 2.2, 2.4 and 2.6 kernels,
Solaris x86, OS/2, Netware, and DOS.
</p>

<p>
The Sun xVM family of products integrates virtualization and management to
help customers better manage both physical and virtualized assets across
heterogeneous environments. Previously announced products in the Sun xVM
line include Sun xVM Server and Sun xVM OpsCenter. Sun xVM Server is a
datacenter grade, bare-metal virtualization engine that can consolidate
Windows, Linux and Solaris operating system instances. Sun xVM Ops Center
is a unified management infrastructure for both physical and virtual assets
in the datacenter. More information about Sun xVM solutions can be found
at <a href="http://www.sun.com/xvm">http://www.sun.com/xvm</a>.
</p>

<h4>VMware Adds Virtualization Offerings with Acquisition of Thinstall, Foedus </h4>

<p>
VMware will acquire Thinstall, an application virtualization software
company in San Francisco. VMware is acquiring Thinstall to expand its
desktop virtualization capabilities to better provision, deploy, and update
desktop environments.
</p> 

<p>
Thinstall decouples applications from underlying operating systems,
improving isolation and portability for applications across desktop
environments. Thinstall's agentless approach to application virtualization
requires no pre-installed software on physical or virtual PCs and no new
deployment infrastructure or management tools. Thinstall's architecture
integrates into existing application management systems to deliver
virtualized applications across a variety of operating system versions and
enables applications to move with users as needed. Thinstall significantly
decreases the time to value of a software application and reduces the
overhead of costly integrations. For more information about Thinstall
please visit <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/Thinstall">http://www.vmware.com/go/Thinstall</a>.
</p>

<p>
VMware also will acquire services-related assets from Foedus. VMware
intends to leverage Foedus' application and desktop virtualization services
expertise to help VMware partners.

&gt; Wikipedia article on the future of Zimbra:
&gt;  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro_2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FoxPro_2</a> 
</pre>

<p>
(Will forward this post to Dick, whom I think I've known even longer than
you have, Don. I've [also] asked Dick Morrell's permission to publish any
remarks he might have in response. Will forward, if he has anything to say
and is willing.)
</p>

<p>
The true, functional acid test of whether a codebase is genuinely open
source as claimed is <em>forking</em>:  It must be possible, when push comes to
shove (e.g., the company producing it being bought out by Microsoft) to
fork off a copy, independently develop it, and continue to use it for
any purpose and redistribute it without charge (or with charge, if the
redistributor prefers).
</p>

<p>
So: Questions about whether Zimbra is really open source may soon get
resolved -- the hard way.
</p>

<p>
The right to fork includes the right to create arguably foolish, annoying
forks for bad reasons, e.g., the IPcop fork of Dick's Smoothwall project.
It's natural that developers like Dick would inherently feel ambivalent
about the right to fork, feeling the attraction of licensing
restrictions that "would have stopped IPcop in their tracks" (Dick's
wording).  It's only when <em>you</em> need to fork that the right to use code
in any fashion, including removing runtime advertising, can become
essential.
</p>

<p>
I have a feeling that Dick assumes, as I did, that Zimbra's still under
the "Zimbra Public Licence" aka ZPL (MPL 1.1 + a mandatory runtime
advertising clause often called "Exhibit B").  It's not.  I've only
recently caught up on this myself:  It's now under an even newer licence
called Yahoo Public License (YPL) v. 1.0.
</p>

<p>
ZPL was one of about two dozen clones of SugarCRM's MPL 1.1 + runtime
advertising clause[0], each deployed by about the same number of thinly
capitalised Web 2.0 startups, many of them with interlocking Board of
Directors and Advisers<a id="moen.html_1_back"></a><a
href="#moen.html_1">[1]</a>.  Each such licence required that "each user
interface screen" of the application bear the company's trademarked logo,
advertising text, and linkback -- and at the same time specifically denied
recipients a trademark licence.  Each such licence was loudly proclaimed to
be open source, but, if you asked why the firm was consistently failing to
submit it for OSI certification, you got silence or evasion.
</p>

<p>
The truth of the matter was:  They were all carefully avoiding so doing,
because they knew their licences <em>would be rejected</em> as violating (at
least) OSD provisions #3 (derived works), #6 (discrimination against
particular fields of endeavour), and #10 (technological neutrality).
</p>

<p>
Advocates asserted that they were merely trying to ensure "attribution" --
which was transparent rubbish: The right to retention of author
attribution in software <em>source code</em> is already automatic in
copyright law and doesn't require any licence provision<a
id="moen.html_2_back"></a><a href="#moen.html_2">[2]</a>, but SugarCRM,
Zimbra, et alii actually wanted something more than, and different from,
that: They wanted to require that all derivative works retain their
<em>runtime</em> advertising displays, placed in front of the user's
eyeballs on "each user interface screen".  These firms then made the
non-sequitur claim that their licence was automatically open source because
its terms were the result of combining two OSI-approved licence, MPL 1.1
and the extremely obscure "Attribution Assurance License" aka AAL.<a
id="moen.html_3_back"></a><a href="#moen.html_3">[3]</a>
</p>

<p>
They called their aim merely "attribution" and implied that it was a just
claim.  Bruce Perens, an early critic, politely called it a "badgeware"
restriction.  I, covering the issue for <em>Linux Gazette</em>, became over
time rather more blunt, and characterised it as mandatory runtime
advertising.
</p>

<p>
One of the more cooperative of the firms, Socialtext, finally set up a
rather tentative trial balloon with OSI, something called the "Generic
Attribution Provision" aka GAP<a id="moen.html_4_back"></a><a
href="#moen.html_4">[4]</a>, a paragraph they asked OSI to certify as open
source if appended to some unspecified subset of the 65-odd OSI-approved
licences.<a id="moen.html_5_back"></a><a href="#moen.html_5">[5]</a>  Note
that, as usual, Socialtext did <em>not</em> submit the "Socialtext Public
License" that it was in fact <em>using</em> for its commercial wiki-software
product:  It wanted OSI to commit to a different licence it did not use, to
test the waters.
</p>  

<p>
OSI's outside advisors, including me, unanimously found the "GAP" proposal
to fail OSI standard by a country mile<a id="moen.html_6_back"></a><a
href="#moen.html_6">[6]</a> -- and the firms using modified-MPL licensing
for their Web apps started feeling more public heat over their questionable
claim of producing public source, and their evasion of the OSI.
</p>

<p>
About this time, I also started pointing out an even more peculiar aspect
of this situation:  The firms obviously had been attempting to do copyleft,
i.e., requiring that third parties deploying derivatives of their Web apps
share back code, but had picked MPL, a totally unsuitable licence lacking
an "ASP clause" to enforce code shareback on hosted applications.<a
id="moen.html_7_back"></a><a href="#moen.html_7">[7]</a>  Leaving aside OSI
approval for a moment, I asked, "What the Hell <em>are</em> you guys trying
to accomplish?  You go out of your way to pick a copyleft licence to
modify, but then pick one (MPL) whose copyleft clause doesn't work in your
market.  You claim you just want "attribution", but ignore people who point
out that preservation of <em>real</em> attribution (in source code and
docs) is already mandated by law, and all you've really done is ensure that
third-party commercial users need to carry your advertising and live in
fear you'll sue them for trademark violation. <em>That</em> sort of
impaired usability you call open source?"<a id="moen.html_8_back"></a><a
href="#moen.html_8">[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Quite a long time later, to their and attorney Mark Radcliffe's credit,
Socialtext <em>did</em> come up with a <em>much</em> more modest (still MPL
1.1-based) mandated runtime advertising licence, Common Public Attribution
License 1.0 (CPAL).<a id="moen.html_9_back"></a><a
href="#moen.html_9">[9]</a>  CPAL's runtime encumbrance is so very mild,
and so careful to avoid the earlier problems with OSD #3, 6, and 10 that it
easily passed OSI approval, and was adopted by most of those couple-dozen
Web 2.0 firms -- but not Zimbra.
</p>

<p>
Zimbra got bought by the same Yahoo that is now Microsoft's daily
blue-plate special, which somewhere along the line changed the Zimbra
codebase to YPL 1.0 -- which turns out to have gratuitously different 
wording from SugarCRM/Socialtext/etc.'s original and problematic MPL
1.1 + mandated runtime advertising licence, but manages to replicate 
and perpetuate all of its problems, including the implied threat of
trademark suits.<a id="moen.html_10_back"></a><a href="#moen.html_10">[10]</a>
</p>

<p>
If Dick thought ZPL was open source, it's likely he considers YPL to
qualify, too.  Getting back to the original point, I figure we'll find
out who's right, within the next year or two.
</p>  

<p>
My prediction:  The noxiousness of the "attribution" (in English:
mandated runtime advertising) requirement, combined with the trademark
threat that will now be backed by Microsoft Corporation's cash, will
kill any forking efforts, and (unless a miracle happens and Microsoft
continues to back it, or sells its rights, or fails to acquire Yahoo at
all) the Zimbra project will die -- or at least all YPL-covered code
will have to get rewritten from scratch before it can live again.
</p>

<p>
(So, Dick, you're wrong.  Nyah-nyah.  ;-&gt;  )
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_1"></a><a href="#moen.html_1_back">[1]</a> I won't name
any names, but I've seen a couple of these people writing in the IT
industry press to, for example, tout the alleged buyout market value of
firms with which they had insider status (and that they didn't see fit to
mention).
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_2"></a><a href="#moen.html_2_back">[2]</a> Well, sort of.
That is absolutely true in most of the world.  Most EU member states and
Australia, for example, recognise that right as what is called "authors'
moral rights" in the European civil law tradition.  One major
industrialised country's copyright statute lacks such a specific clause:
the USA.
</p>

<p>
The Visual Artists Rights Act (1990) amended the USA's Federal copyright
statute (title 17 of the United States Code) to create 17 U.S.C.
106(a), creating an explicit right of correct author attribution for
<em>visual</em> works only (e.g., film, television).  Software is considered a
"literary work" for purposes of US Federal copyright law.  (Until
recently, I'd misread section 106(a), failing to notice its scope
restriction.)
</p>

<p>
The international Berne Convention treaty (article 6bis) mandates
protection of "moral rights" for in-copyright works, but the USA,
although a signatory, declined to enact any such explicit protection at
the level of Federal copyright law, on the extremely shaky theory that
the matter is adequately covered in other applicable law.
</p>

<p>
That is <em>not</em> to say that authors to whose works others wrongly claim
authorship have no recourse:  It just means that it's a weak point in
US <em>copyright</em> law.  Authors would have to use other theories of law.
For example, The SCO Group sued Novell in Utah state court for the
business tort of "slander of title" (and is still in the process of
massively losing).  Here is Pamela Jones of Groklaw, four years ago,
explaining that tort:
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2004021116125699&query=slander+of+title">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=2004021116125699&query=slander+of+title</a>
</p>

<p>
In short, there <em>is</em> an automatic right to retain author attribution
in most countries copyright statutes.  The USA is an exception, in
which software authors can protect that right, but by methods outside of
copyright law.
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_3"></a><a href="#moen.html_3_back">[3]</a> This claim was
widely accepted until I bothered to <em>compare</em> SugarCRM's (and other
similar firms') mandatory-advertising clause with AAL and found that this
widespread claim of having merely reused AAL's wording was, in fact,
obviously wrong.
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_4"></a><a href="#moen.html_4_back">[4]</a><a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4124">http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4124</a><br> 
<a href="http://crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?3:mss:11896:200611:jfkjkakegkfbihlhcbbn">http://crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?3:mss:11896:200611:jfkjkakegkfbihlhcbbn</a>
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_5"></a><a href="#moen.html_5_back">[5]</a> Some licences
specifically do not permit modification of their terms by licensors.
Socialtext apparently never noticed this and a number of other fundamental
problems, including the fact that OSI certifies only actual licences, and
what they'd submitted was a patch.
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_6"></a><a href="#moen.html_6_back">[6]</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070219093912/http://www.buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/GAP_Against">http://web.archive.org/web/20070219093912/http://www.buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/GAP_Against</a> 
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_7"></a><a href="#moen.html_7_back">[7]</a> Hosted Web apps
intruded the novelty that you can fully exploit their use without
distributing them to their users.  Therefore, terms in conventional
copyleft licences like GPL (v. 2 or 3) <em>or</em> MPL that require code
shareback do not have the intended effect for hosted aka ASP (Application
Service Provider) aka SaaS (Software as a Service) aka Web 2.0 apps.  (FSF
and other copyleft licence authors assumed that substantive usage would
entail distribution, and so tied the copyleft shareback obligation to the
distribution right.)  However, several other licences <em>would</em> have
met their needs, Funambol's (Fabrizio Capobianco's) Honest Public License,
Affero Public License, Apple Public Software Licence (APSL), and Open
Software Licence (OSL).
</p>

<p>
Questioned as to why they used a licence that lacked an ASP clause, and
so completely failed to meet their business needs, advocates stammered
quite a bit and said all existing ASP-oriented licences lacked OSI
certification, and so they'd cobbled together the best one they could by 
combining to OSI-approved licences, MPL and AAL.  I responded that (1) 
actually, both ASPL and OSL <em>are</em> OSI-approved, and (2) no, their
assertion of having merely reused AAL's wording had, to put it politely,
turned out not to be the case.  (Basically, they screwed up -- shooting
their own copyleft aim in the foot by omitting one type of clause, and 
torpedoing their claim to open source by including the usage-encumbering
one.)
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_8"></a><a href="#moen.html_8_back">[8]</a> Until
SugarCRM's SugarCRM Public License aka SPL 1.1.3 (the first mandatory
runtime advertising licence) came out, and SugarCRM, Inc, claimed it to be
open source, nobody had even considered banning usage restrictions in the
Open Source Definition, because it never occurred to us that anyone would
have the effrontery to try, those being so obviously alien to the intended
concept.  However, that proved sufficiently well implied by OSD provisions
#3, 6, and 10 (see footnote 6) to block GAP and similar proposals.
</p>

<p>
Most recently, SugarCRM, Inc. has switched from SPL to GPLv3 --
ironically, <em>also</em> a copyleft licence whose copyleft wording is
non-functional in SugarCRM's market segment, for lack of an ASP clause.
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_9"></a><a href="#moen.html_9_back">[9]</a><a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpal_1.0">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpal_1.0</a> 
</p>

<p>
<a id="moen.html_10"></a><a href="#moen.html_10_back">[10]</a> Some would
say that the requirement to use trademark-encumbered logos creates an
implied trademark licence, and that's what defendants would argue in court.
They might win; they might lose.  Point is, the clause specifically denying
a trademark licence raises that concern, and one cannot help suspecting
that such instilling such fears in third-party commercial users, to deter
them, is a deliberate aim.

<a href="https://www.cmpevents.com/SDw7/a.asp?option=C">https://www.cmpevents.com/SDw7/a.asp?option=C</a>
</p>

<p>
First, you didn't need a full conference pass to enjoy many of the sessions
and events at SD West. Many vendors - including Adobe, Amazon, Intel, and
Sun - hosted free technical sessions in separate rooms during the expo days
and many were worth driving down to the Expo without the promise of free
beer at an Expo party. The Intel presentation, "Performance Tuning for
Multi-Core Processors", focused on Threading Building Blocks, a new library
that enables use of task patterns instead of threads by mapping logical
tasks into physical threads.
</p> 

<p>
Here's a list of the free tech sessions for SD West 2008:
<a href="http://sdexpo.com/2008/west/tech_sessions.htm">http://sdexpo.com/2008/west/tech_sessions.htm</a>
</p> 

<p>
Social and networking activities abounded. There were the 2007 Jolt Awards
and the Dr. Dobb's Awards for excellence in programming. SD West has a
history of great match-ups with its Developer Bowl quiz-show in which teams
from the top technology companies are tested on their knowledge of
the history, technology, and traditions of software development. 
</p>

<p>
There is also the usual party with food and libations for the opening of
the Expo. This past year, the fine Expo event transitioned into a later
party hosted by Google. However, Google booked the space rather late and
had only one third of a main ballroom. The lines were long and the food
scant because of other demands at the hotel. It was a near disaster for
Google and left several developers grumbling, since Google is legendary for
the fine food and snacks at its campuses.
</p> 


<p>
This is a mid-sized conference and notably smaller than it was in the go-go
1990's. But it gets A-level presenters and has a wide range of tracks. That
can make it a little hard to target the best sessions because interesting
sessions in C++ or Java or Ruby or Security may be happening at the same
time. The conference CD has many of the sessions, but never all of the ones
you might consider and the hottest topics are the ones least likely to have
presentations submitted early enough for the conference CD. This is why I
prefer getting a jump drive with most sessions on it and having locations
to update the jump drive as presentations become available - this is what
you get at EclipseCon.
</p>

<p>
This is also a pricey conference, with early-bird rates from the $1695 and
$1895 (conf and tutorials) to the $2395 conference and tutorials rate at
the door. All conference registration includes a one-year subscription to
Dr. Dobb's Journal. There is also the $95 'SD On Demand' add-on that
provides access to conference session audio and PowerPoint (a so-called
$595 value) for 365 days after the event. There are good sessions, but not
all of them are on the conference CD or in the post-conference archive.
</p> 

<p>
Speaking of good sessions, the folks from SPI Dynamics usually give a good
security presentation and Dennis Hurst did not disappoint on the last day
of SD West. His presentation, "The Hackers Goldmine: Methodologies and
Automation for Gaining Access to Confidential Information Through Defects
in Web Applications" had a long title but was succinct in reviewing the
spectrum of Web app deficiencies, especially emerging threats. Topics
covered included SQL injection, cross-site scripting, parameter
manipulation, and session hijacking.
</p>

<p>
The presentation was given at the last hour of the conference on the last
day but was heavily attended, showing the growing importance of securing
Web applications. You can view the entire presentation here:
<a href="http://portal.spidynamics.com/blogs/dennis//attaqchemenets/27960.aspx">http://portal.spidynamics.com/blogs/dennis//attaqchemenets/27960.aspx</a>
</p>

<p>
Geof Hoglund presented "Exploiting Online Games". His thesis was that games
represent a showcase of cutting-edge tech and also have the financial
motivation to bring out the best and worst in skillful programmers. He
discussed memory cloaking, hyper-spacing threads, shadow branching and
kernel-to-user code injection. This was very scary stuff and he repeatedly
suggested that advanced techniques used to subvert multi-player games would
find its way into the exploits of tomorrow. (This idea came up again at IT
SEC World, reviewed below.)
</p>

<p>
I was disappointed to discover that these presentations and a few others I
was interested in did not make it into the archive for SDWest 2007 even
after months of waiting. Fortunately, some authors post their presentations
to public Web sites afterwards, sometimes to guarantee they are not locked
away.
</p>

<p>
And that offers a segue of sorts to a review of security-themed conferences.
</p>


<h3>
IT Security World 2007
</h3>


<p>
MIS Training Institute (MISTI) offers audit and information security
services and training and puts on conferences and symposia for the
information security industry.
</p> 

<p>
Currently, MISTI puts on the CIO Summit, the CSO Forum, InfoSec World, and
IT Sec World, along with 10 other venues. The sessions are mainly focused
on security, auditing and governance and regulatory issues. IT Sec World is
an annual conference aimed at IT security professionals.
</p>

<p>
The two AM keynotes at IT SEC
were stimulating and informative. These were the kickoff
keynote with Peter Coffee, former Technology Editor at eWeek, now with
Salesforce.com, "A Truly World Wide Web: Security on the
Inter(national)net", and the second morning keynote with Gary McGraw, Chief
Technology Officer at Cigital, and a co-author of the recent book on the
subject, <title>Exploiting Online Games</title>.
</p>

<p>
Coffee's main point was that we live connected to a global Internet, and the
threat profile is now also global. He noted that Chinese is second most used
language on the net and its use is growing fast.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, Coffee emphasized that the real payoff for IPv6 was not
address range, it was IPSec and source authentication as part of network
forensics. Coffee also focused on the explosion of personal data and
storage: "<em>there's way too much storage, making it as easy to lose a major
database as losing a stick of gum....</em>" He also noted that 1GB jump drives
are now given out as trade show swag and a lot of these are lost,
misplaced, or stolen.
</p>

<p>
In summary, Coffee thinks there is too much data on too many devices with
way too much access from anywhere. Coffee looks to Identity Management and
forensics in depth to counter the efforts of hackers and crackers.
</p>


<p>
There were several excellent presentations on the technical side,
particularly if you skipped most of the case studies. There were also
industry-specific tracks (Healthcare, Banking, etc.) which may or may not
have been everyone's cup of tea.
</p> 

<p>
I found "Top 10 Web Attacks" by Jeremiah Grossman interesting and up to
date on current exploits. It was Grossman who made the suggestion to
segregate and compartmentalize Web browser use as a major defense against
zero-day attacks - and I want to widely encourage this. Simply put, do
casual browsing with one browser and do financials with a different one
(and employment work with a third perhaps) to minimize the risk for malware
vulnerabilities. It's a kind of a free firewall at the application level.
</p>

<p>
DNS SEC was a technical topic presented by Steve Pinkham and David Rhodes,
both of Maven Security. An updated version of the presentation (for SD West
2008) is now posted in the resources section of the Maven Security Web
site. There are also several other excellent presentations on security
tools, wireless hacking, and Web application security, so
please visit
<a href="http://www.mavensecurity.com/presentations">http://www.mavensecurity.com/presentations</a>.
</p>

<p>
IT SEC World 2007 had a modest Expo with under 50 vendors, many of them
leaders in their vertical niche. Most contributed to the end of conference
drawing so over 30 items were given away to a crowd of under 300 (at least
half of the attendees had already left for local offices or the SFO airport.)
</p>

<p>
The next MISTI IT Security World 2008 Conference Expo will be held on
September 15-17, 2008, at the San Francisco Marriott, near the Moscone
Convention Center. Last year, this conference was at the famous Fairmont
hotel, a breathless walk up to the top of Nob Hill. The new venue is more
accessible and much faster to get to.
</p>

<p>
Next time, we'll take up Digital IDs and the Identity Management (IdM) universe.

<h3>2-cent tip: Getting the "true" transfer rate during disk I/O benchmark</h3>

<p>
So say you want to test how fast your disk does writing operation. You
might do this:
<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mount/point/of/your/partition/testfile bs=4K count=256M
</pre>

<p>
It will write 1GB file to the target partition. But one thing you
might don't know is that the filesystem system do it in so called
"write back" style. In this mode, data actually transit in temporary
cache before actually being flushed to the disk. As the result, you
get faster I/O speed.
</p>

<p>
How to get the real number then? Try to add "oflag=sync" as the option
of dd. Then repeat the test, possibly by combining "dd" and "time" to
get real/sys/user time statistic. This way, writing will be done
synchronously i.e a block of data will be pushed to the disk before
next blocks are going to be written.
</p>

<p>
Other benchmark program also provide you the same mode. Check the
related documentations so you really know the meaning of the numbers
you get. Also, as the rule of thumb, write something bigger than your
L2 (or L3, if you have it) cache size, so I/O is done mostly between
RAM and the disk, not originated CPU cache. Cache is thousands time
faster than RAM, which also gives you another layer of "speed
illusion".

The longer I use Vim, the more ways I find to make my life easier. This
tip comes courtesy of Andy Lester's entry in the "Mechanix" blog
(<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/mechanix/2008/01/vim-tricks-for-perl.html">http://perlbuzz.com/mechanix/2008/01/vim-tricks-for-perl.html</a>), where
he shows a nifty trick for looking up Perl documentation for both
functions and modules. I used to have it set up for just the former, but
my lookup method is a little fancier - I open a scratch buffer in
another window so you can look at both the docs and your code at the
same time. So, combining the two results in the following:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
autocmd FileType perl nmap K "zyiw&lt;c-W&gt;n:set buftype=nofile&lt;CR&gt;:r!
    \perldoc -tf '&lt;c-R&gt;z' 2&gt;/dev/null &lt;bar&gt;&lt;bar&gt; perldoc '&lt;c-R&gt;z'&lt;cr&gt;gg
</pre>

<p>
(Yes, the 'escape' slash does go on the second line.)
</p>

<p>
Now, whenever your cursor is on a perl function or a module name, simply
hit 'shift-k' (the standard vi/vim "lookup" key), and you'll get the
docs.

<h3>2-cent tip: Convert your mp3 files into ogg</h3>

</p>

<p>
First, why? Easy, because mp3 is a patented format and ogg is an open
source format. So, to guarantee your peace of mind (like what Cattano
said to Frank Lucas in "American Gangster" <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> ), use ogg.
</p>

<p>
To do it, first I assume you have mpg123 (<a href="http://www.mpg123.de/">http://www.mpg123.de/</a>)
installed and the binary is located in searchable path (check your
$PATH).
</p>

<p>
Your mp3 files probably contain spaces, so use this script:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
 
for b in *; do (  cd $b; for a in *; do mv -v "$a" $(echo $a | sed s/\
/\_/g); done ) ; done
</pre>

<p>
The script assumes your working directory has subdirectories that
holds the mp3 files (think of it as albums). Outer loop lists the
directories and inner loop "cd" into them and rename the files inside
so they don't contain spaces anymore.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the real piece of work:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
 
for b in *;
do ( cd $b;
     for a in *;
            do test=$(echo $a | cut -f1 -d\.).wav ;
            mpg123 -v -w $test "$a";
            oggenc  $test ;
            rm -fv $test ;  rm -fv "$a" ;
     done );
done
</pre>

<p>
In short, the script loops over your collections. It uses mpg123 to
convert your mp3s into wavs. Then, oggenc converts it as ogg. The wav
is then deleted since we don't need it anymore. Why create wav 1st,
you might ask? Well, i tried to pipe mpg123 directly to oggenc but
somehow it didn't work (at least in my case), so that's my workaround.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi.

<h1>Joey's Notes: Logical Volume Creation and Expansion</h1>

<strong>Joey's Notes</strong> is a new column by Joey
Prestia, intended to introduce Linux users to basic and essential Linux
tasks and skills. Joey's current work toward a degree in Linux
networking, his daily experiences as a member of the RedHat Academy staff
on campus, and his knowledge as a programmer in a number of languages
provide him with an excellent list of qualifications for this task, and we
hope that our readers will benefit from his expertise and enjoy these fun
articles.<br>
 -- Ben
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Information on Logical Volume configuration is somewhat sparse - at least
if you want to use the command line. There is a Logical Volume Manager tool
on RHEL 5, but it requires a GUI - and most servers only provide a console
interface. I tried to find a quick start guide for the CLI (command line
interface) and came up with nothing, so I wrote this little guide to help
people like me gain a quick insight into the basics.
</p> 

<p>
The hardest part about creating Logical Volumes is knowing which one must
be created first; from that point on it's pretty straightforward. First, we
have to create Physical Volumes on our hard disk; then, based on those
Physical Volumes, we will create our Volume Groups; and finally, we'll set
up our Logical Volumes. Let's start with a hard drive that's unpartitioned
- say, one that we just added to our system. Start up <code>fdisk -l</code>
to see how the device was assigned (we'll use '/dev/sdb' in this example.)
While in <code>fdisk</code>, create 2 partitions of the same size (500M),
then make sure to set their type to '8e' (LVM).
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# fdisk /dev/sdb

Disk /dev/sdb: 120.0 GB, 120034123776 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 14593 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1               1         200     1020096   8e  Linux LVM
/dev/sdb2             201         400     1020096   8e  Linux LVM
</pre> 

<p>
Write your changes and exit 'fdisk', then use the 'partprobe' command to
re-read the partition table.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# partprobe
</pre>

<p>
Now that we have re-read the partition table, we can get on with the actual
creation of the Physical Volumes on our hard disk partitions - the ones
that we tagged as Linux LVM while in 'fdisk'. We'll use 'pvcreate' for this
task. We can also specify both hard disk partitions on one line; 'pvcreate'
doesn't mind.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# pvcreate /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2
	Physical volume "/dev/sdb1" sucessfully created
	Physical volume "/dev/sdb2" sucessfully created
</pre>

<p>
Ok, now we have two Physical Volumes, and we can create Volume Groups from
these. We'll use the 'vgcreate' command to do this, and this time we'll
specify a name for the volume group that we are creating. We'll use just
one partition, and reserve the other for later.
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# vgcreate VolumeGroup_1 /dev/sdb1
	Volume group "VolumeGroup_1" successfully created
</pre>

<p>
So far, so good. Let's get a look at the stats on this Volume Group - we'll
use 'vgdisplay'. We need to pay close attention to the sections labeled 'VG
Size' and 'Total PE'. PE is the number of <em>physical extents</em> that we
have available. We want to avoid ever running out of physical extents,
because that would prevent us from being able to resize our LVMs -
something we'll be doing a little later.
</p>

<pre class="code">
 [root@localhost ~]# vgdisplay
    --- Volume group ---
  VG Name           	 	  	 VolumeGroup_1
  System ID             
  Format               			 lvm2
  Metadata Areas       	 		 1
  Metadata Sequence No 	 		 1
  VG Access            			 read/write
  VG Status            			 resizable
  MAX LV             			 0
  Cur LV               			 0
  Open LV               		 0	
  Max PV                		 0
  Cur PV                		 1
  Act PV                		 1
  VG Size               		 476.00 MB
  PE Size               		 4.00 MB
  Total PE              		 119
  Alloc PE / Size       		 0 / 0
  Free  PE / Size       		 119 / 476.00 MB
  VG UUID                  	     BCkPP1-2CM1-1hxW-7B2J-yfSt-mEMJ-7fMwNL
</pre>
  
<p>
This says that we've done everything correctly; it also tells us the number
of physical extents we have. In this case, it's 119 - and we'll need 5%-12%
of our available physical extents to perform resizing operations on LVMs.
</p>

<p>
Okay, then - let's create a Logical Volume out of this Volume Group so we
can put a file system on it.  We'll be using - you guessed it - the
'lvcreate' command. It's similar to 'vgcreate', but we must specify more
details on the command line to set things up correctly. The switches we
will be using are '-l' to specify the number of extents to utilize and '-n'
to assign a name to our logical volume. We will also have to specify it by
'/dev/VolumeGroup_1' now rather than the physical designation (/dev/sdb1)
as before.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# lvcreate -l 50 -n LogicalVolume_1 /dev/VolumeGroup_1 
	Logical volume "LogicalVolume_1"  created
</pre>

<p>
We have used 50 extents in this example, so about 200 MB worth of actual
file system can be used on it. Run 'lvdisplay' to see the results. Now,
let's put a file system on it so we can mount it and put it to use.
</p> 
 
<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# mkfs.ext3 /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1
</pre>

<p>
Let's label it as '/data':
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# e2label /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 /data
</pre>

<p>
Now, we'll make a '/data' directory and mount our Logical Volume on it.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# mkdir /data
[root@localhost ~]# mount /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 /data 
[root@localhost ~]# ls /data 
lost+found
</pre>

<p>
Let's use that new space up so we can really see what all this logical
volume resizing stuff is about:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# cd /data
[root@localhost data]# dd if=/dev/zero of=crap bs=1000k  count=190
190+0 records in 
190+0 records out
194560000 bytes (195 MB) copied, 16.2202 seconds, 12.0 MB/s
</pre>

<p>
That should push us to the limit of room on that logical volume. You can
see this via 'df -h':
</p> 

<pre class="code">

                      194M    192M      0  100%      /data
</pre>

<p>
First, let's increase our size a little. A simple way to do this is 'lvresize':
</p> 

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost data]# lvresize -l 100 /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1
	Extending logical volume LogicalVolume_1 to 400.00 MB
	Logical volume Log_1 successfully resized
</pre>

<p>
Now this looks good - but we still can't utilize the added room. You must
first extend the file system onto the newly added area - remember, it's
still kinda "raw". We can do this by using 'resize2fs'. The file system can
be mounted while this is done, but I would recommend stopping all
filesystem activity on this partition while this is being performed. If you
have critical data on this partition, you will want to actually unmount it
before resizing. I did a 'live' resize in this example because our
partition does not contain any critical data.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost data]# resize2fs /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 
resize2fs 1.39 (29-May-2006)
Filesystem at /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 is mounted on /data; on-line resizing required
Performing an on-line resize of /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 to 409600 (1k) blocks 
The filesystem on /dev/VolumeGroup_1/LogicalVolume_1 is now 409600 blocks long.

                      388M    193M   175M   53%      /data
</pre>

<p>
As a last exercise, we'll add the other physical volume to this one. Let's
assume that we need to add some more room to that logical volume; since we
have a physical volume left over (/dev/sdb2), that's what we'll use. For
this operation, we'll need the 'vgextend' and 'lvextend' commands. We'll
need to remember the order in which we created them: Physical first, then
the Volume group, and Logical Volume last of all. This order is very
important, and is reversed for the removal of these logical devices.
Here, we add the '/dev/sda2' physical volume area to our volume group
VolumeGroup_1:
</p>  
 
<pre class="code">
[root@localhost data]# vgextend /dev/VolumeGroup_1 /dev/sdb2
	Volume group "VolumeGroup_1" successfully extended

[root@localhost data]# vgdisplay 
    --- Volume group ---

</pre>
  
<p>
That's it; we've created Physical Volumes, Volume Groups, and Logical
Volumes and resized them. There's a lot more that can be done to and with
these; I would recommend lots of practice before doing anything involving
critical data and making sure you have a backup/snapshot of your data.

<h1>Taking control of system logs -- How to install Logger</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/darin.html">Mar Matthias Darin</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
This is a HOWTO for installing Logger, a Linux-based logging utility, and
taking control of your system logs. System logs can be overwhelming and are
most often overlooked; many users simply do not know what to do with them
or how to maintain them. Log maintenance can be a daunting task,
especially if Web or mail server applications are also involved in the
maintenance schedule. My goal here is to provide a simple methodology that
anyone running Linux can use.
</p>

<p>
The classic programs like <code>syslogd</code> and <code>klogd</code> are,
at the very least, old and outdated for most modern system requirements. In
extreme situations, they can be flat outright hostile. I wrote Logger to
address these and other issues.
</p>

<p>
Let's begin by describing these classic programs and exactly what they do.
<code>klogd</code>, the kernel logging daemon, is responsible for
collecting all messages from the kernel and passing them to
<code>syslogd</code>, the system logging daemon. One question comes to mind
immediately: why two different processes?
</p>

<p>
This is a good question indeed. The current school of thought is that it is
easier and more accurate to have a dedicated program for logging kernel
messages. This does make sense - but at the same time is completely
irrational, since <code>klogd</code> simply passes the messages to
<code>syslogd</code>. To me, this seems like double the work and wasted
resources. With that being said, let's have a look at <code>syslogd</code>.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned earlier, this is the system logging daemon. It is responsible
for logging all message from programs like <code>bind</code>,
<code>wuftp</code>, <code>proftp</code>, <code>ident</code>,
<code>telnet</code>, most user space drivers, many antispam tools, and so
on. A very diverse list of software relies on <code>syslogd</code>.
</p>

<p>
With such important software, one wants to ask, why re-invent the wheel or
mess with something that isn't broken? The short and simple answer is there
are many modern programs that can break <code>(sys|k)logd</code> - and
every ounce of system performance really matters. Two-gigabyte file limits
and sending log data as plain text are just a couple of very good reasons
why you may want to replace these venerable programs.
</p>

<p>
I run a small server with seven domains. Each domain has its own Web,
email, FTP, and domain name server along with the base kernel and system
logs. That's six logs per machine for a total of 42 different logs I have
to maintain on a daily basis. I did not include proxy, cache, email
scanning logs, and so forth for simplicity - but these are typical to any
basic server. With all this log data to be handled, where would I get time
for my other administrator responsibilities, like answering my email?
</p>

<p>
There is one other issue I haven't touched on yet: excessive log writing
can thrash even the most high-end servers, causing anything from massive
slowdowns to down time. Excessive logging can also cause hard drives to
heat up and wear out faster. I know this from personal experience. My
logging drive was running at a whopping 125F before I started using
Logger; now, it's at a comfortable 95F and I have no more server
crashes caused by overheating. Laptops and desktops are also affected,
though on a smaller scale.
</p>

<p>
This is the very reason why I wrote Logger: to take control of this mess
and save my hardware from such thrashing as well as heat problems. So, with
all that being said, let's move on to the installation of Logger.
</p>

<p>
The Logger package must be installed on the hard drive. It can be
downloaded from <a href="http://tanaya.net/Logger/Logger.tgz">here</a>. I
recommend putting the Logger archive in the '/usr/src' area for convenience
and security (remember, writing to this directory requires root permissions.)
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ There are a number of schemes for installing
software that is not a part of the distribution tree; generally, these
involve using some flavor of '/usr/local' or '/opt', which are designated
for those purposes. There are also programs such as <code>stow</code>,
which are designed to support easy installation and removal of such "alien"
programs; installing it and learning to use it may be a worthwhile
investment of time if you're going to do this on a regular basis.
</p>

<p class="editorial">The question of whether to install software that
requires root access and does not come from the standard distribution tree
should also be considered at length. If you are a programmer, are expert in
the language used to write the program, and are certain that it is neither
malicious nor contains any vulnerabilities - or can have the above sort of
verification from someone you trust implicitly - then you may be in the
clear. If the above is not the case, you are, in my opinion, taking an
unwarranted risk. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
The Logger tarball should be unpacked into a directory called 'Logger' and
the path should be changed to that folder:
</p>

<pre>
             mkdir /usr/src/Logger
             mv Logger.tgz /usr/src/Logger
             cd /usr/src/Logger
             tar xvzf Logger.tgz
</pre>

<p>
Logger must then be compiled by typing:
</p>

<pre>
             ./COMPILE
</pre>
<p class="editorial">[ The <code>COMPILE</code> script contains flags for
the C compiler affecting the code generation. The script assumes that
it will run on IA32 systems and uses the "-march=i686 -mtune=i686"
flags. This won't work on x86_64 (AMD64/EM64T) systems. Use
"-mtune=generic" or pick suitable flags from the
<a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/Safe_Cflags">Gentoo Safe CFLAGS Wiki</a>. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<p>
If no errors occurred, then the files need to be installed:
</p>

<pre>
             mv Logger /sbin
             mv LogPipe /usr/local/bin
</pre>

<p>
Now, it's time to write the Logger configuration file. This is simply a
flat text file called 'Logger.conf' and it's saved in the '/etc' directory.
The instruction set is rather simple and easy to use; here is a very basic
'Logger.conf' file that will work with any machine (an example is included
in the Logger tarball):
</p>

<pre class="code">
          1. ###
          2. ### Logger configuration file
          3. ###
          4.
          5. ### Queues needed
          6.
          7. Queue Klog       0 0 0600 1 /var/log/Klog.log
          8. Queue Slog       0 0 0600 25 /var/log/Syslog.log
          9.
          10.### Sys/KLog Entries
          11.
         12.Kernel MyCPU Klog
         13.SysLog MyCPU Slog
</pre>

<p>
Lines 1-3, 5, and 10 are comments. Any line that starts with a pound sign (#) is a
comment and is ignored by Logger. Blank Lines (4, 6, 9, and 11) are also ignored. The
first actual command to Logger is line 7.
</p>

<p>
The first command Logger encounters is Queue. Here is a detailed breakdown of line
7:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Queue lines must always start with the word Queue. To Logger, a Queue
   is a section of memory that is used to keep all the log data before it is
   written to disk. These are created and maintained by Logger
   automatically when Logger sees the Queue command.
<li> This is the Queue Name or Identity and must be unique to each Queue.
   This is how Logger knows where to put the log data from a specific log
   source.
<li> Owner - this is the numeric UID of the owner and can be gotten from the
   Linux 'stat' command or '/etc/passwd'. For example, root has a
   numeric value of 0.
<li> Group - this is the numeric value of the group and can be gotten from the
   Linux stat command. For example, root has a numeric value of 0.
<li> Permissions, leading ZERO (0) must be present - this sets the access
   right to the file and can be gotten from the Linux stat command. For
   example, owner access only has a numeric value of 0600.
<li> This is the number of lines of log data you want to Queue to hold before
   the information gets saved. The minimum is one line. There is no
   maximum limit, but the number should be practical.
<li> Prefix to entry (* = no prefix).
<li> Output File(s)/TCP Connections (Logs can be sent via TCP only as well,
   just omit the file).
</ol>

<p>
With the above example as a starting point, we'll now add a laptop. Add the
following two lines to the 'Logger.conf' on the desktop (the above example):
</p>

<pre>
         1. TCP 3900 * Klog
         2. TCP 3901 * Slog
</pre>

<p>
Logger will now need to be restarted. The above two lines tell Logger to
set up TCP servers on ports 3900 and 3901 whereby kernel and system data
will be received accordingly. It should be noted that any number of
computers can now use this log server. Be sure to set your firewall rules
appropriately.
</p>

<p>
Now for the 'Logger.conf' settings for the laptop (remember that Logger has
to be installed first):
</p>

<pre class="code">
         1.  ###
         2.  ### Logger configuration file
         3.  ###
         4.
         5.  ### ALL ENTRIES PER LINE ARE REQUIRED.
         6.
         7.  ### Output Queues - MUST be listed first
         8.
         9.  Queue Klog       0 0 0600 1 @10.0.100.0:3900
         10. Queue Slog      0 0 0600 25 @10.0.100.0:3901
         11. 
         12. ### Sys/KLog Entries
         13. 
         14. Kernel Laptop Klog
         15. SysLog Laptop Slog
</pre>

<p>
The 10.0.100.0 is an example used to identify the IP addresses of the desktop
computer. It needs to be the actual desktop computer IP address. Also, notice that
the ports in the desktop example match the order and sequence on the laptop
computer.
</p>

<p>
Below is a slightly more complex example:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="misc/darin/network.png" width="588" height="171">
</p>

<p>
For this example, the above diagram will be the basis on which a small network
will be established with these assumptions:
</p>

<pre>
         1. Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Omega are servers.
         2. IP address will be assumed as follows:
            (a) Alpha - 10.0.100.0
            (b) Beta - 10.0.100.1
            (c) Delta - 10.0.100.2
            (d) Gamma - 10.0.100.3
            (e) Omega - 10.0.200.0
         3. The server layout will be as follows:
            (a) Alpha, Beta, and Delta are Web servers running Apache.
            (b) Delta is an email server.
            (c) Omega is the dedicated log server.
         4. All servers have Logger installed.
         5. Apache and Exim have been configured as follows:
            (a) Apache will save log data to:
                i. /tmp/logger/ApacheLog for general log data
                ii. /tmp/logger/ApacheErr for log errors
            (b) Exim will save log data to:
                i. /tmp/logger/EximMain
                ii. /tmp/logger/EximReject
                iii. /tmp/logger/EximPanic
</pre>

<p>
With the above layout, here are the various 'Logger.conf' files for each machine:
</p>

<p>
For Alpha, Beta, and Delta:
</p>

<pre class="code">
            ###
            ### Logger configuration file for Alpha, Beta, and Delta
            ###
            ### The prefix will need to change for each machine.

            ### Output Queues - MUST be listed first

            Queue   Klog            0   0   0600   1      @10.0.200.0:3900
            Queue   Slog            0   0   0600   25     @10.0.200.0:3901
            Queue   ApacheLog       0   0   0644   1000   @10.0.200.0:3902
            Queue   ApacheErr       0   0   0644   1      @10.0.200.0:3903

            ### Sys/KLog Entries

            Kernel Alpha Klog
            SysLog Alpha Slog

            ### Apache entries

            Pipe /tmp/logger/ApacheLog Alpha ApacheLog
            Pipe /tmp/logger/ApacheErr Alpha ApacheErr
</pre>

<p>
Notice that Exim is not listed here at all and doesn't need to be.
</p>

<p>
For Gamma:
</p>

<pre>
            ###
            ### Logger configuration file for Gamma
            ###

            ### Output Queues - MUST be listed first

            Queue Klog              0 0 0600 1            @10.0.200.0:3900
            Queue Slog              0 0 0600 25           @10.0.200.0:3901
            Queue EximLog           0 0 0640 500          @10.0.200.0:3904

            ### Sys/KLog Entries

            Kernel Gamma Klog
            SysLog Gamma Slog

            ### Exim Entries

            Pipe /tmp/logger/EximMain   Main   EximLog
            Pipe /tmp/logger/EximPanic Panic EximLog
            Pipe /tmp/logger/EximReject Reject EximLog
</pre>

<p>
Notice that Apache is not listed here and doesn't need to be. Also notice that the
three Exim logs are consolidated into one single file. Each Exim file can be saved
separately by simply providing a Queue for each.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Omega:
</p>

<pre class="code">

<p>
Restart Logger, Exim, and Apache on each of the machines, and all log data will be
written to the Omega machine. An important point to note: Logger must be started first
on Omega, then the other machines. Restart applications, such as Apache and Exim, last.
</p>

<p>
The examples above are just the beginning of where Logger can be used.
Applications/Servers like Apache, Exim, Sendmail, Postfix, Maildrop, Squid,
Snort, and such (including any piece of Linux software that writes log data
in plain text) can benefit from Logger. Implementations can range from a
simple single computer to a large multi-layered corporation consolidating
all log data to a central security point. Logger's versatility and
flexibility can dramatically open the doors to new possibilities and
performance improvements on any system.

<h1>Writing Portable Code in Linux - Three Different Approaches</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dokopnik.html">Deividson Luiz Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>Considering the number of different platforms and Operating Systems used
today, writing code that runs only on a single system, configuration, or
platform can drastically decrease the number of people that might get to
use your program. To me, that's a waste of good coding.</p> 

<p>To avoid this problem, there are several approaches one can take. In
this article, we will be presenting three of them: Mono (with MonoDevelop),
Lazarus, and Java (with NetBeans). We will see how to do a basic "Hello
World" application in each of the methods, and how to run it on Linux and
Windows.</p> 

<h3>Mono: </h3> 
<p><em> "Mono is a software platform designed to allow developers to easily
create cross platform applications." </em> - <a
href="http://www.mono-project.com/">http://www.mono-project.com/</a> </p> 

<p>Mono is an Open Source software platform developed as an implementation
of Microsoft's .Net Framework. It provides the possibility of executing
.Net applications on platforms unsupported by Microsoft; it also gives you
the ability to develop .net-independent Mono applications that run on
every system Mono supports (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, etc.) </p> 

<p>The main IDE for developing Mono applications is called MonoDevelop -
it's an open-source IDE, developed using the Mono platform. It is primarily
available for Linux, but can also be compiled and used on Windows and OS/X.
</p> 

<p>
<h4>Pros: </h4> 
<ul>
<li>A single executable can be used on several systems, without the 
need for recompilation
<li>Frequent updates
</ul>

<h4>Cons: </h4> 
<ul>
<li>.Net is not 100% ported; some applications might require small changes 
to work
<li>Needs Mono to be installed on the target machine
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Developing a simple Mono application with MonoDevelop: </h4>

<p>Start up MonoDevelop, and in the Welcome screen select <code>"Start a
New Project"</code>. Then, select <code>"GTK# 2.0 Project"</code>, give it
a name, select a location where the project will be saved, and click
<code>"Next"</code>. On the next screen, press <code>"OK"</code> and you
will be given an empty project with an empty form.</p>

<p>MonoDevelop interface is pretty simple - on the left of the screen you
have a list of the files in your projects, and to the right the contents 
of the selected file. If you press 'F5', your project will be compiled and 
executed - if you do that now, you will see a simple, empty form.</p>

<p>Let's try developing our 'Hello World' application. In the file
list, double-click "MainWindow.cs" - that will show your empty form 
and a list of components you can add to it. To add a component, drag it 
from the list to your form.</p>

<p>Start by adding "Fixed" from the "Container" component group - that will
allow you to add normal components, like buttons, to your form.  After
adding the Fixed Container, add a "Button" and a "Label".</p>

<p>Change the form title to "Hello World", the button text to "Hello", and
erase the label text. To do that, first select the form (by clicking on its
title), and in the properties panel (just below the components list) click
to expand the "Window Properties". Then, select the "Window Title" property
and change it to "Hello World".</p>

<p>Now do the same with the button, by changing its "Caption" property
(in the "Button Properties" group) to "Hello", and with the label, by
changing its "Caption" property to "" (just erase everything that's there).</p>

<p>Now that all the properties ready, let's create the code to make "Hello
World!!!" appear when the user clicks the button. Select the button, click
on "Signals" (just above the properties list), expand the "Button Signals"
group, and double-click on the "Clicked" signal to have the procedure
created for you, then double-click on it again to go to it. </p>

<p>You will see the following code:</p>

<pre class="code">
protected virtual void OnButton1Clicked (object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
}</pre>

<p>Change it to the following (note that the button and the label names
might change - mine are 'label1' and 'button1', but if you added more than
one they might be called 'label2', 'button3', etc. Be sure to change it in
the code to reflect your component names):</p>

<pre class="code">
protected virtual void OnButton1Clicked (object sender, System.EventArgs e)
{
 label1.LabelProp = "Hello World!!!";
}</pre>

<p>Now, our test application is ready to run - just press 'F5' to check it
out. If you want to compile it, press 'F8' and a .exe file will be generated 
inside the 'bin/Debug' folder, where your project was saved. That .exe can be
executed on any platform Mono is installed in without any porting. To execute
it in Windows, use the following command:</p>

<pre class="code">mono "file_name_here.exe"</pre>

<h3>Lazarus: </h3> 
<p><em> "Write once, Compile everywhere." </em> - 
<a href="http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/">http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/</a> </p> 

<p>Lazarus is a free, Open-Source IDE for the <code>'free-pascal'</code>
compiler (also free and Open Source), that compiles Pascal and
Object-Pascal (including Delphi, in most cases) code. The IDE is currently
ported to Linux, Windows, and FreeBSD; the compiler runs in many other
OSes, including Windows CE and Mac OS/X.</p> 

<p>
<h4>Pros: </h4> 
<ul>
<li>The same code can be compiled in several different systems
<li>Works with many graphical libraries (GTK, GTK2, Win32, Carbon, etc.)
<li>Needs no external libraries to be installed on the user machine
</ul>

<h4>Cons: </h4> 
<ul>
<li>Missing a few components (MaskEdit, Panels)
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Developing a simple Lazarus application: </h4>
<p>
When you open Lazarus for the first time, you will be presented 
with an empty project containing an empty form. You can press 'F12' 
to toggle the form/code view. On the top of the interface, there's 
a list with all the currently installed components which you can 
use to design your program.</p> 

<p>Let's start our example by placing a button and a label in the form. To
do this, you can double-click the "Ok" button in the component list - that
will create a Button on your empty form. Create a Label in the same way -
the label is the little white box with an "A" inside it. You can drag the
components around on the form to change their locations, or resize
them.</p>

<p>Next, we will change some properties for the controls we are using. To
do that, click the Button inside the form to select it. When you've done
that, its properties will be shown in the Properties List window (by
default, it's on the left side of the screen). That window contains all the
properties of the currently selected control, and allows you to change
their values. Find the "Caption" property of our button and change it to
"Hello".</p>

<p>Next, do the same with the Label, and change the "Caption" property 
to empty (just delete what's in there). Finally, select the form itself 
(by clicking in an empty space in it) and change its "Caption" property 
to "Hello World".</p>

<p>Now, with all the properties configured, we can add the code to make
things work on our Form. What we will do is make "Hello World!!!" appear in
the label when the user clicks the button. To add code to our button,
double click on it - that will take you to the code window and create the
function that will be run when the user double clicks the button
- you just need to add the code for what you want it to do.</p>

<p>To do that, double-click the button on our form - that will bring you
to the form's code and will create an empty procedure called 
TForm1.Button1Click that will be called when the user clicks the button 
on your form. Change it to something like this (note that the button and 
the label names might change - mine are label1 and button1, but if you 
added more than one they might be called label2, button3, etc - change it 
on the code to reflect your component names):</p>

<pre class="code">
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
  Label1.Caption:='Hello World!!!';
end; </pre>

<p>That is all the code we need, and all it does is setting the Caption 
property of "Label1" to "Hello World!!!". You can now press F9 to execute
the program and see your form in action. To run it on other systems, 
you just need to download and install Lazarus there, open the project and
compile it - simple as that.</p>

<p>To compile your application you can use the Build option, in the Run 
menu.</p>

<p>Please note that if you are on Ubuntu and install Lazarus from the
"Add/Remove Programs" option, you will need to download the fpc-source
package (you can find it <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/fpc-source">here</a> ) and
install it manually, and then configure Lazarus ( Environment\Environment
Options, set FPC Source Directory to /usr/share/fpcsrc/ ) for it to work
properly.</p>

<h3>Java: </h3> 
<p><em>"Mature, extremely robust, and surprisingly versatile Java
technology has become invaluable in allowing developers to write software
on one platform and run it on practically any other platform.  . ."</em> -
<a
href="http://www.java.com/en/about/">http://www.java.com/en/about/</a></p>

<p>Java is the result of a combination of two different "things": The Java
Runtime Environment (JRE, containing the Java Platform and the Java Virtual
Machine) and the Java programming language.</p> 

<p>The Java language is a high-level, object oriented programming language
that needs to be compiled to what is called Java Bytecode.  The JRE is
responsible for running the compiled Java code - turning it into the
platform's native executable code - and is ported to several different
platforms.</p> 

<h4>Pros: </h4> 
<ul>
<li>The same compiled code can anywhere the Java Runtime can be installed 
<li>Easy to port to the Web.</ul> 

<h4>Cons: </h4> 
<ul>
<li>Needs the Java Runtime Environment to be installed on the clients machine 
<li>Usually not as fast as standard, compiled applications </ul>

<h4>Developing a simple Java application: </h4>

<p>To develop our Java application on Linux, we will be using an IDE called
NetBeans - a very professional IDE that's free and open-source, runs on
Linus, Windows, OSX and Solaris - and they even send you a free DVD if you
ask ( <a
href="http://www.netbeans.org/about/media.html">http://www.netbeans.org/about/media.html</a>) .
Just be sure to install the Java SDK before installing NetBeans, so it gets
detected during the installation.</p> 

<p>To start our sample application, open up NetBeans, start a new project ( File/New 
Project ), select "Java Desktop Application", give our project a name ("hello") and 
click "Finish". That will give you a new project, with a form that contains a menu and 
a status bar. </p> 

<p>You can now add a button and a label that we will be using in this project - do that
by dragging from the components list to the panel.</p> 

<p>Now let's change the button and the label text properties - to do that, first select 
the Button, find the "Text" property in the list on the right of the interface and 
change it to "Hello". Then select the Label, find the Text property, and erase 
everything that's written there.</p> 

<p>With that done, it's time to add code on our form to make it work. To do that, select 
the button, click on the "Events" button (just above the button properties), and click 
once in the "Mouse Clicked" event. That will create an empty procedure that will be
executed when the user clicks the button. To make "Hello World!!!" appear in the label
when the user clicks the button, change the empty procedure so it's like this (note that 
the button and the label names might change - mine are jLabel1 and jButton1, but if 
you added more than one they might be called jLabel2, jButton3, etc - change it on the 
code to reflect your component names): </p> 

<pre class="code">
    private void jButton1MouseClicked(java.awt.event.MouseEvent evt) {
        jLabel1.setText("Hello World!!!");
    } </pre>

<p>With that done, you can press F6 to run your application. To build the .jar file 
you can use F11, and to execute your .jar file do</p>

<pre class="code">java -jar "file_name_here.jar"</pre>

<p>That will work anywhere the JRE is installed.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3> 
<p>All of the presented methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, 
and it's up to you, the developer, to choose which one is the best for 
your needs, for the software you are developing, and the systems you want 
it to run on. </p> 

<p>It is also important to note that two of the three tools presented here,
MonoDevelop and Lazarus, are quite new and may be missing some useful
features, but are in constant development, being fixed and improved daily.

<h1>Introducing strace - a System call tracing and Signal reporting tool</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/saha.html">Amit Kumar Saha</a> and <a href="../authors/ghosh1.html">Sayantini Ghosh</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>It's Cool to Know More Stuff</h3>

<p>It is always fun to know how things actually work. All C programmers
know that during the input-process-output cycle of their C codes, a number
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call"><i>System
calls</i></a> are invoked. Wouldn't be cool to to actually "see" what
system calls are invoked by your program? This is the topic of interest
here. Let's get started.</p>

<h3>What is 'strace'?</h3>

<p><b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/strace/">'strace'</a></b> is
a tool which enables tracing the System calls made by a process during its
execution. It also reports the <a
href="http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~alanjawi/cs449/code/shell/UnixSignals.htm">signals</a>
(or software interrupts) that are recieved by the process. </p>

<p>According to the Linux manual page, in the simplest case <i>'strace runs
the specified command until it exits. It intercepts and records the system
calls which are called by a process and the signals which are received by a
process. </i>.</p>

<p>You can have a look at the various switches and options by typing in
'strace' on your terminal:</p>

<pre>
$ strace
usage: strace [-dffhiqrtttTvVxx] [-a column] [-e expr] ... [-o file]
              [-p pid] ... [-s strsize] [-u username] [-E var=val] ...
              [command [arg ...]]
   or: strace -c [-e expr] ... [-O overhead] [-S sortby] [-E var=val] ...
              [command [arg ...]]
-c -- count time, calls, and errors for each syscall and report summary

[[[etc.]]]

</pre>


<h3>Tracing System calls</h3>

<p>Let us start with a very simple demonstration of its working. Consider
the following C code (Listing 1):</p>

<pre class="code">
/* Listing 1*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
return 0;
}
          
</pre>

<p>Assume that the object file is 'temp.o'. Execute it with:</p>

<pre>
$strace ./temp.o
</pre>

<p>You will get the following trace:</p>

<pre class="code">
execve("./temp.o", ["./temp.o"], [/* 36 vars */]) = 0
brk(0)                                  = 0x804a000
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
mmap2(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xb7fba000
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY)      = 3
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=68539, ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 68539, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0xb7fa9000
close(3)                                = 0
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
open("/lib/tls/i686/cmov/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY) = 3
read(3, "\177ELF\1\1\1\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\3\0\3\0\1\0\0\0\0`\1\000"..., 512) = 512
fstat64(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=1307104, ...}) = 0
mmap2(NULL, 1312164, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0) = 0xb7e68000
mmap2(0xb7fa3000, 12288, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x13b) = 0xb7fa3000
mmap2(0xb7fa6000, 9636, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xb7fa6000
close(3)                                = 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xb7e67000
set_thread_area({entry_number:-1 -&gt; 6, base_addr:0xb7e676c0, limit:1048575, seg_32bit:1, contents:0, read_exec_only:0, limit_in_pages:1, seg_not_present:0, useable:1}) = 0
mprotect(0xb7fa3000, 4096, PROT_READ)   = 0
munmap(0xb7fa9000, 68539)               = 0
exit_group(0)                           = ?
Process 8909 detached
</pre>

<p>Let us now try to correlate our theoretical understanding with the
'trace' produced here.</p>

<p>As we know, when the user types in a command or a object file to be
executed, the shell spawns a 'child' shell and and this child shell
performs the execution. This is done with the System call 'execve'. Thus,
the first line that we have in the trace is:</p>

<pre>
execve("./temp.o", ["./temp.o"], [/* 36 vars */]) = 0
</pre>


<p>This is followed by calls to 'brk()', 'open','access', 'open', 'close'
and finally the process is detached from the shell which also exits using
'exit_group(0)'.</p>

<p>As is apparent, the trace shows all the system calls along with the
arguments and the return value.</p>


<h2>Signal reporting via strace</h2>

<p>
I shall now demonstrate the signal reporting capabilities of 'strace'.
Consider the C- code (Listing 2):
</p>

<pre class="code">
/*Listing 2*/

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
int i;

for(i=0;i&gt;=0;i++)
        printf("infinity\n");
return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Assume, that the object file is 'temp-1.o'. Run it using:</p>

<pre>
$ strace -o trace.txt ./temp-1.o
</pre>

<p>NB: the '-o' switch will save the trace results to the file
'trace.txt'.</p>

<p>You will see that it shows you the 'write()' system call being called
infintely. Now end the process using 'ctrl + c'</p>

<pre class="code">

[[[...]]]

write(1, "ty\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfinity\nin"..., 1024) = 1024
write(1, "nity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfinity\n"..., 1024) = 1024
write(1, "finity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfinit"..., 1024) = 1024
write(1, "infinity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfin"..., 1024) = 1024
write(1, "y\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninf"..., 1024) = 1024
write(1, "ity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ni"..., 1024) = 1024
write(1, "inity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfinity"..., 1024) = 1024
write(1, "nfinity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfini"..., 1024) = 1024
write(1, "\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfinity\ninfi"..., 1024) = 1024

[[[etc.]]]

</pre>

<p>Now, open the file 'trace.txt':</p>

<pre>
$cat trace.txt
</pre>

<p>The last couple of lines will be:</p>

<pre>
--- SIGINT (Interrupt) @ 0 (0) ---
+++ killed by SIGINT +++
</pre>

<p>Since we interrupted the process execution using 'ctrl + c', this caused
the signal - SIGINT to be passed to the process and hence was reported by
'strace'.</p>

<h3>Gathering statistics about the system calls</h3>
 
<p>Using 'strace', it is also possible to gather some basic statistics
regarding the system calls traced. This is achieved with the '-c' switch.
For example:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ strace -o trace-1.txt -c ./temp-1.o # run the above object code 'temp-1.o'
$ cat trace-1.txt 

% time     seconds  usecs/call     calls    errors syscall

<p>Among others, an useful piece of information that comes out from the
above is that the process spends the maximum (100%) time calling 'write()'
system call (called 46702) times.</p>


<h3>End notes</h3>

<p>This article provided a short introduction to some basic functionalities
of 'strace'. This tool is most helpful in cases when you have only the
binary of a bug-ridden, crash-prone program. Using this tool you can narrow
down to the most likely cause of the crash.</p>

<p>Together with <a href="http://sourceware.org/gdb/">'GNU Debugger'
(gdb)</a> and <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ltrace/">'ltrace'</a>,
'strace' gives a lot of debugging powers to the Linux programmer.</p>

<h1>Camera review: Kodak V1253/Ubuntu Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/knaggs.html">Peter Knaggs</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
This is just a quick explanation of the Kodak V1253 camera, from the point
of view of interoperability with Linux.
</p>

<p>
A full review written by <a href="http://www.osnews.com/"
target="_top">OSNews</a> contributor (and former editor) <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/editor/1" target="_top">Eugenia Loli-Queru</a>
can be found <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19052/Kodak_V1253_12MP_and_720p_HD_Camera"
target="_top">here</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I'll just mention some of the quirks when using this camera with Linux.
</p>

<p>
This camera comes with an empty SD card slot. It also has 32MB of internal
(built-in) flash memory. The internal memory doesn't appear to Linux as a
USB device, so I initially thought that this camera might not be a good
choice for Linux users seeking to avoid using the camera with an additional
SD memory card. 
</p>

<p>
Without using an SD card, I thought that the internal memory would only be
accessible using the "EasyShare" drivers for the Microsoft operating system 
(these are apparently only supported in Microsoft Windows XP or later, but
I didn't try them, for obvious reasons). But it turns out that by using
<code>gphoto2</code> and <code>gtkam</code> on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon, the
camera's memory is accessible over USB (see below).
</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
Charging the battery is the first puzzle.
</p>

<p>
The camera comes with 
</p>

<ul>
<li> a fairly unusual USB connector cable
</li>
<li> a little "dock" gizmo connector block 
</li>
<li> a power adapter with a USB socket on one end and a 110V AC connector
on the other end.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
All of the above items must be used together, simply to charge the camera
battery.
</p>

<p>
While the battery is charging in this way, the unit can't be used as a
camera.  The little blue "heart" light on the leftmost button on top of the
camera will flash while the camera is charging.  When charging is
completed, the lights on all three of the leftmost buttons on top of the
camera will be lit.
</p>

<p>
The camera also has an ordinary power adapter connector, but no power
connector is shipped for this.
</p>

<p>
Units are available to recharge the battery outside of the camera, but none
is shipped with the camera.
</p>

<h3>Getting the captures out over USB using <code>gphoto2</code> and <code>gtkam</code></h3>

<p>
Initially, I didn't know about <code>gphoto2</code> and <code>gtkam</code> for Linux.
</p>

<p>
In Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon), <code>gtkam</code> is able to see the camera,
save photos from it, and upload photos to it.
</p>

<p>
It took a little trial and error to find the proper sequence to get the
camera's USB interface to show up in Linux.
</p>

<p>
After plugging in the USB connector, I pressed the "ON/OFF" button on the
top of the camera (pressing any of the four leftmost buttons on the top of
the camera appears to have the same effect). After that, the screen comes
"on" (i.e. the backlight comes on) but doesn't display anything.
</p>

<p>
After the above sequence, the camera shows up in the <code>lsusb</code>
output and the <code>dmesg</code> output looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
[84101.432818] usb 5-6: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 7
[84101.565396] usb 5-6: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
</pre>

<p>
The <code>lsusb</code> output contains the following additional line,
indicating that the camera's USB interface is detected:
</p>

<pre>
Bus 005 Device 007: ID 040a:05b6 Kodak Co. 
</pre>

<p>
In <code>gtkam</code>, clicking on the menu item <code>Camera</code> and
selecting the <code>Add Camera</code> menu item, I selected <code>Kodak
V705</code> (you can select any of the cameras that use a USB interface
rather than a Serial interface, e.g. the first in the list is <code>AEG
Snap 300</code>), click on <code>Detect</code> and click <code>OK</code>.
After clicking <code>OK</code>, <code>gtkam</code> detected the camera as a
<code>USB PTP Class Camera</code>.
</p>

<p>
Downloading and uploading photos works OK. Downloading videos works OK (and
quite fast too, full USB 2.0 speed).
</p>

<p>
Uploading videos seems to be a little hit-and-miss at the moment.
Sometimes it works, but sometimes the transfer appears to go through but
hits a "PTP I/O error" right at the end.  After such an error,
nothing works, even downloading photos which downloaded successfully before
also fails with the same "PTP I/O error".  To recover, I have to go through
the USB disconnect/reconnect sequence (see below). So I haven't had
complete success with videos yet, and would recommend using the SD card
approach (see the next section) as it seems to be very reliable.
</p>

<p>
To disconnect the camera from the USB, pressing the <code>ON/OFF</code>
button on the top of the camera does the trick.  If you disconnect the USB
cable before doing this, the camera powers on, which isn't very nice.
</p>

<p>
The USB disconnection should looks something like this in the
<code>dmesg</code> output, and of course <code>lsusb</code> should no
longer list the camera.
</p>

<pre>
[84863.752847] usb 5-6: USB disconnect, address 7
</pre>

<p>
After pressing the <code>ON/OFF</code> button on the top of the camera, the
little blue "heart" button will usually begin to flash (after a short
time).  This means that the camera is disconnected. You can then press the
<code>SCN</code> button to connect it again. This is all without unplugging
or plugging in the USB connector (just leave it attached and plugged in).
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, <code>gtkam</code> gets stuck starting up, so I found that
removing the <code>$HOME/.gphoto/settings</code> file, unplugging the
camera, plugging it back in and re-doing the camera detection steps helped
get it going again.
</p>

<h3>Getting the captures out using an SD card</h3>

<p>
To get the photos (and videos) out of the camera, I used an additional SD
card (not included).
</p>

<p>
The camera has one SD card slot (which is SDHC compatible). 
</p>

<p>
I tried the camera with a SanDisk 4GB (SDSDRH-4096-AC11) card (this SD card
comes with a USB card reader, making it very convenient for use on older
Linux machines). The camera apparently accepts SDHC cards up to 8 GB,
although the packaging and manuals make no mention of this, and I didn't
try an 8GB card.  The camera does allow the images (and small videos) to be
copied from the internal flash to the SD card. When the SD card is
installed, if you choose "auto" it becomes the default location for the
captures.
</p>

<h3>Photo Capture (JPG)</h3>
<p>
The camera captures still images in a variety of aspect ratios. The camera
uses JPEG/EXIF v 2.21. This table lists them in order of decreasing size.
The lens unit has "Schneider - KREUZNACH" and "VARIOGON 37-111mm (Equiv.)
AF 3X Opt." written on it. The aperture can vary from f/3.4 to f/5.3. The
shutter speed can vary from 8s to 1/2000s. It uses TTL autofocus, there's
no manual focus control.
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> Megapixels </td><td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> Aspect Ratio </td><td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> Dimensions </td></tr>

</table>

<p>
It has a clear bright 3.1" LCD screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio, but no viewfinder.
</p>

<p>
It can capture 9 megapixel images in the 16:9 aspect ratio, and up to 12
megapixel images in the 4:3 aspect ratio, perhaps useful if you're planning
on printing the pictures. Most computer monitors and HDTVs nowadays are
only be able to display around 2 megapixels (1920 x 1080).  The still
images the Kodak V1253 captures look comparable to a 4 megapixel camera
(not noticeably clearer, despite the much higher "12 megapixel" number).
</p>

<p>
It has a convenient sensor (which can be switched off for either video or
photos or for both) to detect when you have rotated the camera vertically.
</p>

<h3>Video Capture - MPEG-4 Part 2 at 1280x720 (720p) </h3>

<p>
The Kodak V1253 can capture video. The codecs is uses are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> video: MPEG-4 Part 2 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_2" target="_top">ffodivx</a>).
</li>
<li> audio: uLaw, 16kHz, 2-channel.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A raw sample direct from the camera can be found <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/img/19052/v1253.MOV" target="_top">here</a>. It
can capture in these resolutions:
</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> Resolution </td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> Name </td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> Bitrate </td></tr>

<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 1280 x 720 (HD720p) HQ </td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 13mbps </td></tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 1280 x 720 </td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 1280 x 720 (HD720p) </td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFCC"> 10mbps </td></tr>
<tr>

<tr>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 320 x 240 </td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> 320 x 240 (QVGA) </td>
<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> todo </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The camera has two microphones, so it's able to record in stereo mode.
Audio quality is fine.
</p>

<p>
When recording video, a bright green LED light shines out from the front of
the camera.  Perhaps this is needed by the autofocus? Remember that it will
show up in the recording, if you're taking video of reflective surfaces.
</p>

<p>
Remember that video files will be cut off at 2 GB because of the FAT
filesystem limitation. That's about 16 minutes of 720p HQ video.
</p>

<p>
The codec Kodak used is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_2"
target="_top">ffodivx</a>, not the more efficient <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264" target="_top">H.264</a> (AVC).
</p>

<h3><a name="Video_Playback"> </a> Video Playback </h3>
<p>
The <code>ffodivx</code> ".mov" video files play back at 1280x720
resolution using <code>vlc</code>, <code>totem</code>, <code>xine</code> or
<code>mplayer</code>.
</p>

<p>
Under Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon), the default video player
(<code>totem</code>) does a very good job (both audio and video work fine
by default).
</p>

<p>
The audio runs too fast and breaks up in <code>xine</code>, on both the <a
href="http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LinuxHardwareInfoDellDimensionXPS"
target="_top">3.4GHz P4 box</a> and the <a
href="http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LinuxHardwareInfoAppleiMac24"
target="_top">iMac</a>. Not sure why, yet.
</p>

<p>
Playback with <code>mplayer</code> and the <code>-vo xv</code> flag tends
to jam up after playing back for a little while.  When playing back using
<code>mplayer</code> with the <code>-vo x11</code>, the video doesn't jam,
but of course the video can't go full-screen when using the <code>-vo
x11</code> flag.  An alternative, if you have OpenGL support on your
graphics card, is to use the <code>-vo gl2</code> flag, which works quite
smoothly. The audio is OK in mplayer. 
</p>

<p>
You can try video playback on your system using this sample <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/img/19052/v1253.MOV" target="_top">video</a>
from the <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/story/19052/Kodak_V1253_12MP_and_720p_HD_Camera"
target="_top">review</a> article.
</p>

<p>
To get the video playback to look as smooth as real 720p from ATSC sources,
you have to hold the camera very steady. If you are doing any "panning",
you have to do it quite slowly, to avoid slight jagged jitters during
playback.

<p>
Using the provided RCA cable, you can playback (at NTSC resolution) to a TV or VCR. 
</p>

<p>
To playback 720p from the camera directly to a 720p HDTV, a separate "dock"
would be needed. But of course, you don't need a HDTV if you already have a
computer running Linux, and the playback of 720p in Linux is quite smooth
(not as smooth as playing back 720p ATSC captures using XVmc, but close). 
</p>

<h3><a name="Converting_to_MPEG2_using_mencod"> </a> Converting to MPEG2 using <code>mencoder</code> </h3>

<p>
To be able to playback video on most DVD players, as well as being able to
playback using XVmc, we'd need to be able to convert the video into MPEG2.
One way to do this is to use <code>mencoder</code> as follows (see <a
href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-vcd-dvd.html"
target="_top">here</a> for a guide to all the options).  The resulting file
is about 70% smaller, but the process takes a lot of CPU resources to
preserve the high quality, and runs at only around 6fps on a 2GHz <a
href="http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/LinuxHardwareInfoAppleiMac24"
target="_top">iMac</a>. It takes around one minute for an 11 second video.
Let's try it with the sample <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/img/19052/v1253.MOV" target="_top">here</a>:
</p>

<pre>
wget http://www.osnews.com/img/19052/v1253.MOV

mencoder -oac lavc -ovc lavc \
-of mpeg -mpegopts format=dvd:tsaf \
-vf harddup -srate 48000 -af lavcresample=48000 \
-lavcopts vcodec=mpeg2video:vrc_buf_size=1835:vrc_maxrate=9800:vbitrate=8000:\
keyint=15:trell:mbd=2:precmp=2:subcmp=2:cmp=2:dia=-10:predia=-10:cbp:mv0:\
vqmin=1:lmin=1:dc=10:vstrict=0:acodec=ac3:abitrate=192 \
-ofps 30 -o output.m2v v1253.MOV
</pre>

<h3>Converting to MPEG2 using <code>transcode</code></h3>

<p>
The <code>transcode</code> input works OK, but audio is lost.  Remember to
use <code>-g</code> to specify the  video stream frame size, otherwise
transcode crashes.  Here, we'll just use the default ffmpeg encoding
settings, which are lower quality but quicker to encode.  This <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/img/19052/v1253.MOV" target="_top">sample</a>
takes only about 4.5s to encode, and the resulting file is only about one
seventh of the size of the original (3MB compared to 21MB).
</p>

<pre>
  wget http://www.osnews.com/img/19052/v1253.MOV
  transcode -i v1253.MOV -g 1280x720 -x mov  -y ffmpeg -F mpeg2video -o output
</pre>

<p>
Using <code>mplayer</code> as the input to <code>transcode</code> works OK,
but audio is lost.  Again, remember to use <code>-g</code> to specify the
video stream frame size, otherwise the resulting video is just a blur of
colors.  For example, we can use ffmpeg to encode to mpeg2 using this
command:
</p>

<pre>
  wget http://www.osnews.com/img/19052/v1253.MOV
  transcode -x mplayer -i v1253.MOV -g 1280x720  -y ffmpeg -F mpeg2video -o output
</pre>

<h3>lsusb -v</h3>
<p>
This is the output of <code>sudo lsusb -v</code>.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Given the lowish price, the large bright screen and well thought out
user-interface, it's a useful camera.
</p>

<p>
The video quality is surprisingly good, although <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_2" target="_top">ffodivx</a>
does fill up the precious flash memory more quickly than <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264" target="_top">H.264</a> would.
</p>

<p>
Kodak also make an even lower-priced camera (model number Z1275) which also
records 720p, albeit at "medium" quality (10Mbps) instead of 13Mbps.

<hr>

<p>
This book started its life, as many things do these days, as a <a
href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2004/20040405/badger.shtml">page on
the Web</a>; the consequent Slashdotting convinced the author to "go
public" by adding more material in a similar vein and releasing it as a
real-life, "dead-tree" version. The resulting pages are aswarm with dead
animals, zombies, vampires, faery cats, pixies, trolls, greasemonkey
computer gurus, and drugged-out frat boys (who, I suspect, qualified as
fitting matter due to being brain-dead.) As a friend of mine would say,
"it's a real hoot!"
</p>

<p>
There's a lot of good, geeky (<em>can I say "down to earth"? How about
"deadpan"? Can I, please? Oh, thank you</em>) humor and fun packed into this
little booklet - but it's not quite as smooth as an oleaginous eulogy for a
deceased specimen of <em>meles meles</em> of the well-known Mustelidae
family (sorry... I've been playing a lot of Scrabble lately.) Of the dozen
chapters in the book, perhaps two-thirds are wickedly funny, creative, and
demonstrate that the author's imagination should be locked in a
maximum-security prison when it's not being carefully supervised. As for the
rest... well, the editors clearly wanted to hit a certain minimum number of
pages and were unwilling to clip anything, no matter how repetitive. In
fact, even the good chapters - pretty much all of them - suffer from the
same problem on a smaller scale: the funny bits are repeated, and repeated,
and repeated again until they're worn thin - and then repeated again for
good measure, just to make sure that you Get It, ha-hah.
</p>

<p>
Humor, by its nature, is not a very robust creature: just a little abuse
will kill it dead and beyond all hope of resurrection (<strong>no</strong>, it
cannot be brought back by the techniques described in this book) - and rough
usage of this sort pretty much defines that kind of abuse. That's
unfortunate, because Lucy Snyder's work is witty, eloquent, and mordantly,
morbidly funny underneath all the goo, gribble, and glop that nearly
obscures it.
</p>

<p>
If you're one of those persnickety detail-oriented unfortunates like me,
you may find the editorial misfeasance more grievous than any entertainment
value possessed by the book can remedy; if so, mutter a quick <em>"Requiem
aeternum dona eis"</em> and leave it on its shelf. On the other hand, if
you have the kind of selective vision that lets you pick the one remaining
good <em>hors d'oeuvre</em> from a large tray after a long drunken party,
you may well enjoy this book for the good bits and let the other stuff go
straight to <code>/dev/null</code> where it belongs.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I'll be watching for further output from this author -
hopefully, with better editing. "Zomb(ie emp)loyees", root-compromised dead
badgers, and squid-shaped alien White Knights riding to the rescue of a
princess currently employed as a waitress in a diner... there's much good
craziness here, and hopefully much more to come in the future.

<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.

He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.

&gt;  I am afraid my latin is paltry at best, so I had to rely on machine translation:
&gt;
&gt;  I to value highly both intention , nothwithstanding I wind a green twig very a
&gt;  thin margin. Give thanks you for rendered this! How can I send you some
&gt;  pertaining to a journey when to place your expenses?
</pre>

<p>
I was stunned that some of it looked exactly like Esperanto:
</p>

<p>
tamen : however
ventus: would have vented (though "ventumus" is traditional for this)
virga: virgin (adjective)
per: by means of
pro: because of
transporto: transportation
-is : (past tense verb)
-us: (conditional tense verb)
vesti (dropping r): to clothe
tenis (dropping u): held
</p>

<p>
I've heard that "tamen" came from Latin but this here's proof.  I
think "sed" (but) also comes from Latin.
</p>

<p>
Taking the English and making it grammatical results in this Esperanto:
</p>

<p>
Mi tre sxatas ambaux intencojn, tamem mi volvas verdan brancxeton
mallargxe margxene. Dankon pro prezenti tion cxi!  Kiel mi povos sendi
al vi monon por via viagxo?
</p>

<p>
Translating that back into English makes:
</p>

<p>
I much value both intentions, however I wind a green twig
narrow-marginly [1].  Thanks for rendering this!  How can I send you
money for your journey?
</p>

<p>
[1] That means as little in Esperanto as it does in English, but I
don't know what else "very a thin margin" means.
</p>

<p>
I had some trouble with "render" in the computer sense because there
was no obvious equivalent.
realize: realigi
draw: desegni
make: fari
present/introduce: prezenti
But these didn't sufficiently express "make a copy from prepared
instructions" as opposed to making something original.  But one of
Webster's definitions for "render" is "to reproduce or represent by
artistic or verbal means : depict", which is one of the meanings of
"prezenti" so I went with that.

Just a few minutes ago, I set my 6-month old son, Michael, on the table
in front of my laptop; several moments later, when I looked at the
'xterm', the commandline said
</p>

<pre>
perl -wle'print chr(rand(95) + 33) for 1..40'
</pre>

<p>
"Dear Ghod," I thought to myself. "They certainly do inherit bad habits
at a young age!"

(Yes, he was leaning on the 'up-arrow' cursor key while staring at the
screen. But he did stop at that particular entry... that's my boy.)

Quoting Ben Okopnik (ben@linuxgazette.net):

<pre>
&gt; When you consider the mutually-unintelligible varieties of English -
&gt; e.g., Brooklynese vs. Louisiana "lazy mouth", or Chicano vs. Ebonics -
&gt; it becomes less startling. Unlike the varieties of Arabic, the base
&gt; words are (mostly) the same, but watching the 300-car pileup when people
&gt; try to communicate across those divides can be horrifying and amusing.
</pre>

<p>
Yes, we're sort of in a silent conspiracy to make (other) foreigners
believe we actually understand the Australians when they say, e.g.,
"Jareedna piper wairtsed abat the bushfires?  Eiche nardly bleevit."

&gt; But I <strong>like</strong> keeping people in suspense, Faber. It often has pleasant

"Arrgh!  Curse you, Okopnik!"  Faber wraps his cloak around him and
slinks off into the shadows....

&gt; Since you have asked, though, here it is:

A few minutes later, a bat is seen flying into the rafters carrying
a sheet of green-bar paper.
