<P>
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/rose.gif">
Thanks to my wonderful husband, Riley, for the hard work he has done
the last three months to help get <I>LG</I> out. He has, however, decided that
he no longer wishes to take
full responsibility for <I>Linux Gazette</I> so I am once more in the
driver's seat. Whether or not I decide to outsource it again remains to be
decided.
<P> 
In the meantime, I'm having fun and enjoying all the mail and good articles
that you guys have been sending in. Lots of you have subscribed to our
announcement service and it seems to be working well -- no complaints!
<P> 
<I>Linux Journal</I> has redesigned its <A
HREF="http://www.linuxresources.com/">Linux Resources Page</A>. 
Check it out and give us your comments and suggestions. We'd like these
pages to be community effort and will provide space for discussion groups
and Linux projects. Just get in touch with our <A
HREF="mailto:webmaster@ssc.com">webmaster</A>.
<P> 
Have fun!
