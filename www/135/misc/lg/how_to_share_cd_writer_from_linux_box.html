Ok . now I have a little bit of problem with linux. my linux
server has a cd writer and
a DVD writer. the server already has samba. now what can I
do in my smb.conf file 
so that windows clients can use both the writers of the
linux server ?
</p>

As far as I am aware -- you can't. At least not via samba. On the other
hand there is a remote-daemon from cdrecord (see Joerg Schillings
webpage) and -- probably quite close to what you want -- webCDcreator
(webCDwriter it seems its called now):

This lets you collect your files in a platform-independent java-program,
sends them through to the target computer and burns the stuff. 
</p>

<p>
In my experience better from Win than from Linux because Debian et al do
not have the right java engines and its a pain in the ass to get them to
work in Linux. In windows you just need some working java installation
it seems.
