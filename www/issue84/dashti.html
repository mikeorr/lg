<p>I was reading a fascinating article in LinuxGazette#77, 
<A HREF="../issue77/krishnakumar.html">Writing Your Own Toy OS-Part I</A>
 by Krishnakumar [1]; where I saw an strange thing, 
two last bytes of boot sector should be 0x55AA! And as the paper's talk 
back proves I wasn't the only one to play with this magic number. Any 
way, I rewrote Krishnakumar's boot sector with nasm [2] (I don't know as86) and 
removed 0x55AA insertion line from write.c. Guess what happened? My PC 
booted up! So why Krishnakumar wrote that piece? Or more generally who will 
read and decide boot sector? The answer was straight, BIOS does! And 
another interesting fact was that IBM had published its XT BIOS's source 
code in XT Technical Reference [3]. So lets have a look at it: (I've made 
some changes to it, so it's not complete and original)
<PRE>

</PRE>
<p>OK! everything got clear. that 0x55AA is checked only if boot sector is 
loaded from fixed disk, so Krishnakumar used it to ensure compatibility. 
Also notice that any random bit string in sector 0 of a floppy is considered as boot 
sector and system runs it!<p>But I use a Windows 2000 besides my Linux and my floppies 
have always msdos (fat 12) file system so that both OSs can read them. Now 
setup a simple experiment: format a floppy using Windows (or any DOS based 
OS) and let the system boot up with your floppy. You'll see a message that 
indicates it's not a boot floppy and asks you to change it and press 
any key. This is the case when you format the floppy in Linux and put an 
msdos file system on it too (mkfs -V -t msdos /dev/fd0, could be the 
command or if you use KDE its floppy formatter utility can do the same). 
And things get more strange when you put an ext2 filesystem on the floppy (#mkfs -V -t ext2 /dev/fd0) . Your PC simply passes the floppy and control 
is transferred to fixed disk boot sector (e.g. LiLo). So what's the 
difference between these two formats and with our own boot floppy? I changed Krishnakumar's write.c and this <a href="misc/dashti/read.c.txt"> read.c </a> reads boot sector of a floppy and saves it in boot.sec file; also dumps it in a fairly formatted manner.
If you want you can use Linux's own tools to do the same thing: to write your
boot sector on the floppy (#dd if=boot.sec of=/dev/fd0 bs=1 count=512) and to
read floppy's boot sector (#dd if=boot.sec of=/dev/fd0 bs=1 count=512 skip=0).
<p>Have a look at ext2's boot sector. It's pure zero! but msdos's boot 
sector contains some commands. Lets disassemble it (I use ndisasm[2]):&nbsp;
<p>
1. insert an msdos-formatted floppy.
<p>2. run "./read"
<p>3. run "ndisasm boot.sec | more"&nbsp;
<p>
4. the first instruction is a jump to 0x3e but code is not aligned 
correctly.&nbsp;
<p>
5. run "ndisasm -s 0x3e boot.sec | more" to see aligned code.&nbsp;
<p>
OK, so in this case we have a tiny boot loader, it simply shows a message 
(the message is OS dependent, and you may change it with any binary editor 
such as KDE's. For example change boot.sec to display a funny message 
and then rewrite it using Krishnakumar's write.c on the floppy!) then waits 
for a key and invokes int 0x19 (BIOS's boot_starp procedure) again. In 
fact, MS DOS used to store some information (FAT) in the gap between jmp 
0x3e and 0x3e itself and this fashion is followed by its successors; that's 
why there is a jump there. You may find some information about MS DOS file 
system on the net or consult [4]. 
<p>Up to this point everything is logical, BIOS simply runs what ever it 
sees on the boot sector, it may be our toy "show A and halt" or an elegant 
boot sector such as msdos's. But when I disassembled ext2's boot sector, 
nothing was clear. it's full of zeros that means a lot of silly ADD 
instructions! why does the BIOS passes it simply and doesn't get stuck there? The answer 
is that the BIOS changed from XT to AT! and I could find an AT BIOS source 
on the net (unfortunately it doesn't have reference, but probably IBM AT Technical Reference includes
this boot_strap's code too.)

<p>Two new tests are added to floppy's boot sector:&nbsp;
<p>
1. It's first byte should be more than 0x6! it means that the first 
instruction can't be ADD (OpCode 0 to 5 are for different modes of ADD). 
Why? it's logical, because no wise programmer would add almost unknown 
values of the register at the start up. And if it is so (as the ext2 case) 
a message is shown and PC waits for a reset. puzzle got solved partially!
In my PC, control is simply passed to fixed disk's boot sector. Of course
it's better, these days almost every PC has a fixed disk. Perhaps that's a 
change in BIOS after early AT.&nbsp;
<p>
2. It's first 8 words can't be the same. why? I don't know. It seems to be 
just a decision. you may test it easily, add 16 NOPs (0x90) to 
Krishnakumar's boot 
sector, and then it won't boot your PC!<p>Now you may use these tools (read.c and
write.c) or Linux's own tools (e.g. lovely 'dd' command) for more investigation
in the structure of boot sectors. As an interesting experiment for anybody who has
Windows along with their Linux and uses LiLo as their boot loader (so it resides
on MBR): make a recursive boot menu! Needed steps are as:<p>1. use 'dd' or 'read.c'
to read MBR: #dd if=/dev/hda of=mbr.sec bs=1 count=512 skip=0<p>2. some how copy
mbr.sec to your Windows' boot partition (almost always c:\). you may use <a href="http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/index.htm">these</a>
elegant programs by John Newbigin when all your solutions fail.<p>3. edit
boot.ini and add such a line at its end: c:\mbr.sec = &quot;LiLo Again!&quot;<p>And
this is how boot process goes on...<h3>References:</h3>
