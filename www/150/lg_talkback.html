</pre>
   hello, this is directed towards Ben, i just read his review of how the
   5400 series worked with linux, honestly most of it was over my head, i
   didnt really know what he was talking about with all the technical stuff.
   having said that, i own an averatec 5400 series laptop, and have had it
   for 3.5 years and i love it. i am interested in starting to use linux and
   have tried several distros and cant get them to work. which one would he
   recommend to a non technophile like me who just hates windows and is
   willing to learn to program if i have to, but dont really have the time. i
   used to program in machine language, basic, and fortran77, but was a
   beginner. i have long since forgotten those things a lifetime ago.im
   looking for a distro i can install and be relatively easy to use and will
   function well on this machine. i want to set up a dual boot system with
   windows/linux. any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

&gt; Hi Rene,
&gt;
&gt; I read some of your Linux Gazette articles, specifically the one on TCP's 
&gt; pluggable congestion control and maybe you can give me a little push in the 
&gt; right direction.
&gt;
&gt; I'm in a startup doing streaming video over TCP (rather than UDP with 
&gt; forward error correction), but TCP is giving me some latency headaches. To 
&gt; ensure uninterrupted playback, we use a chunky client-side playback buffer, 
&gt; but in its relentless quest for throughput-optimization, often under high 
&gt; bandwidth and transcontinental RTT's, TCP manages to introduce enough 
&gt; latency to underrun any buffer.
&gt;
&gt; With streaming video, keeping latency within bounds is often more important 
&gt; than squeezing out a few percent extra throughput. I've looked at the 
&gt; pluggable congestion control algorithms which are great, but pretty much all 
&gt; of them focus on high throughput, rather than latency.
</pre>

<p>
Yes, most of the algorithms deal with increasing throughput on fat pipes
and high latency. Only the algorithms TCP Veno and Westwood deal with
other scenarios (frequent packet loss on wireless links). Apart from
that maybe Interactive TCP (iTCP) seems to be interesting, but this
isn't available as module (yet).
<a href="http://www.medianet.kent.edu/itcp/main.html">http://www.medianet.kent.edu/itcp/main.html</a>
</p>


<pre>
&gt; TCP maintains the dynamic send buffer between user- and kernel-space and in 
&gt; order to minimize context switches, Linux seems to have a tendency to making 
&gt; these really large. On high-latency, transcontinental connections, I often 
&gt; get 1MB+ send buffers that can easily contain over 10 seconds of video. From 
&gt; what I see, the kernel modules mostly seem to tune only the size of the cwnd 
&gt; within the send buffer, rather than the send buffer as a whole, but since 
&gt; this is probably the main cause for increased latency, I'm looking for a way 
&gt; to tune this and always keep it as small as possible. Linux already seems to 
&gt; increase the send buffer's capacity when the cwnd increases, but never seems 
&gt; to shrink it again.
&gt;
&gt; Would you have any tips for a Linux-based startup when it comes to 
&gt; low-latency TCP tuning?
</pre>

<p>
The only thing I noticed are the following settings in /proc.

&gt; Hi there
&gt;
&gt; I am new to Linux, but with a big desire to become better. I have recently
&gt; read your article "2-cent tips: convert the collection of your mp3 files

&gt; in Linux Gazzete. I have found it very interesting, and I wanted to try it
&gt; out for myself. Everything went fine, except the script for replacing the "
&gt; " (blanks) with "_".
&gt;  After a little digging, and study of sed command, I have found out that the
&gt; problem came from this line of code:
&gt;
&gt; do mv -v "$a" $(echo $a | sed s/\/\_/g);
&gt;
&gt; So I have replaced it with:

<p>
This article may give me a start, but I am looking for something a
little closer to my requirements. I need to emulate a network of
embedded devices, preferably by creating a pseudo-router with something
that acts like those devices behind it. Every article I have seen
suggests putting the target devices into virtual machines with a router
VM in front. But the embedded devices I need to emulate are neither PCs
nor OS based. We buy the primary device from another company, and it
comes with a Rabbit 2000 and Ethernet interface. That company provides
us with firmware to our specifications, which we simply write into flash
memory with utilities they also provide. I need to emulate a network of
2000 of these devices to do a decent load test on our servers. This
emulation needs to duplicate the behavior of the TCP/IP stack as well as
initiate socket connections, data requests and transactions just as the
target devices do. Some of this behavior will have to be characterized
by analyzing Wireshark traces and some experimentation.
</p>

<p>
Any suggestions?
</p>

Thank you,

&gt; Hi Rene.
&gt;
&gt; My name is Pawel and firstly I'd like to thank you for your contribution
&gt; into open source, for sharing knowledge.
</pre>

<p>
My pleasure, thanks.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I've read your article on as in subject of this email. Ihave to mention
&gt; don't know much about ldap and postfix much,
&gt; I do my best to change that state of affairs. I wonder if you could
&gt; briefly advise, put me on right line of thought.
&gt; This is a problem I've come across:
&gt; when I run your script:
&gt;
&gt; ../cgate_migrate_ldap.pl --source ubuntu --target localhost --verbose 4
&gt; Connected to source server :   ubuntu
&gt; Connected to target server :   localhost
&gt; account has been moved to a remote system at ./cgate_migrate_ldap.pl
&gt; line 174, &lt;DATA&gt; line 228.
</pre>

<p>
I just saw that there is a password hardcoded into the script. I wanted
to avoid that but fortunately the old server got decommissioned after
the migration. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> You have to use the matching password for access to
the LDAP tree on the source server. Usually you use a privileged
password on the source LDAP server for that since you want to read
everything from the source tree.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I'm not sure if I understand it correctly when in the article you say:
&gt; "...
&gt; We use the LDAP tree of our organisation dc=example,dc=net and create a
&gt; subtree for all our accounts.
&gt; Then we create another subtree for the Postfix settings... "
&gt;
&gt; Do you mean here the actual creation of the structure you mention just
&gt; just after, creation with help of
&gt; ldap client tools like, ldapadd, ldapmodify. And I get above error
&gt; because I did not do it?
</pre>

<p>
No, I think you got the error simply because of the hardcoded password
in the script (which is hopefully wrong to access your server).
</p>

<p>
Of course apart from that you can prepare any structures in your LDAP
tree with the clients tools if you like. However the
cgate_migrate_ldap.pl script will overwrite existing structures, so be
careful. 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; In case that is not the reason for the error I get, here is some info on
&gt; systems I work on:
&gt; cgpro 4.1.8 on ubuntu 2.6.20-16-server and target machine is fedora 8
&gt; 2.6.24.3-12.fc8 with openLdap 2.3.39
</pre>

<p>
Should work fine, we also migrated from a 4.1.x CommuniGate Pro server.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Sorry if I got so straight to the point, I hope you don't find it impolite.
</pre>

<p>
No, I like direct questions so I can give direct answers. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<pre>
&gt; 1 matter eludes me - i do not understand -
&gt; Where is the info to tell the program where to find a dir of images.
</pre>

<p>
the inbuilt mini-help says:
</p>

<pre>
  img2ooImpress.pl
  Usage:
  img2ooImpress.pl ImageFileList [outputfile.odp]
  ImageFileList is a file containing all images to import
</pre>

<p>
and yes, the script expects a filename containing all images, each on
its own line. You can easily create a file like that by following the
examples in the original linux-gazette article.
</p>

<p>
essentially, after making sure your files are sorted properly by ls
something like:
</p>

<pre>
ls image*.jpg &gt; filelist
</pre>

<p>
will write all jpg-images starting with "image" into the file "filelist".
<pre>
running img2ooImpress.pl filelist
</pre>

<p>
will then create the output odp file (default odp name, if you pass a
second parameter it will be used as output file).
</p>


<pre>
&gt; i see this
&gt; my $imgFileList=shift;how is this imagefile list made? I am expecting
</pre>

<p>
no -- it simply fetches the first commandline argument into
$imgFileList -- and subsequently opens that file (or fails).
</p>


<pre>
&gt; to see a path to a dir of images....I have just reread your code
&gt; before sending this and Think I might understand now.the usage
&gt; img2ooImpress.pl ImageFileList [outputfile.swi]the perl prog     then
&gt; a txtfile   [ and this is optional? ]and then should the
&gt; imageFileList be in the same dir with the perl?
</pre>


<p>
No -- you can keep the perl script in ~/bin (and add ~/bin to your
PATH). Also the given file-name for the file-list can contain a full
path -- so no need to have it lokal in the the same directory as the
perl script OR the images.
