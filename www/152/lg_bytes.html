<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Nokia on Open Cell Phone Systems</h3>

<p>After acquiring full ownership of Symbian, an operating system for cell
phones, Nokia changed the product to a royalty-free model, following the
market trend away from closed systems, contributing the operating system to
Symbian Foundation, a newly-created open source Community.</p>

<p>Several cell phone providers, including AT&amp;T, Sony Erickson, LG
Electronics, Motorola and Samsung Electronics have already shown interest
in the single platform, signing up to form the Symbian Foundation.</p>

<p>More information about Symbian OS can be found here: <a
href='http://www.symbian.com/'>http://www.symbian.com/</a><br /> and on the
Symbian Foundation Web page: <a
href='http://www.symbianfoundation.org/'>http://www.symbianfoundation.org/</a> .</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">HP Open-sources AdvFS</h3>

<p>HP announced on June 23 that it is releasing the Tru64 Unix Advanced
File System source code free to the Linux community, providing a reference
implementation for an enterprise Linux file system.</p>

<p> More information about the AdvFS can be found at HP's page, at <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Kernel Developers Sign up a Letter Against Closed-Source Drivers</h3>

<p>Several of the Linux Kernel Developers signed a letter directed to
hardware vendors, showing several disadvantages of closed-source drivers to
the Linux Community. The letter says, among other things, "We have
repeatedly found them [closed source drivers] to be detrimental to Linux
users, businesses, and the greater Linux ecosystem. Such modules negate the
openness, stability, flexibility, and maintainability of the Linux
development model and shut their users off from the expertise of the Linux
community." It was signed by 170 kernel developers.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Openmoko's Linux-based
cell phone started shipping</h3>

<p>Openmoko's Neo Freerunner is an open hardware design cell phone that
runs a Linux-based operating system, which users are free to modify (and
encouraged to do so!). This is the first official release of OpenMoko to
the market, as the phone was mostly sold to mobile phone software
developers before. The hardware consists of a 500MHz Samsung processor,
128MB of RAM, 256MB of flash memory, and a 4.3-inch 640x480 VGA touch
screen LCD. It runs on the open source mobile phone software stack,
maintained by the OpenMoko project, along with the open source Jalimo Java
Virtual Machine.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LinuxWorld Partners on Global Installfest for Schools</h3>

<p>
IDG World Expo announced it will partner with Untangle, a pioneer in open
source network gateway platforms, to host an Installfest for Schools at
this year's LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo. Installfest is an event that
drives the refurbishment of older, discarded computers, with Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS) and then donates the restored computers to schools
in need. LinuxWorld is scheduled to take place August 4-7, 2008, at San
Francisco's Moscone Center.
</p>

<p>
Building on the success of the first Installfest for Schools, which
refurbished 350 computers with Ubuntu 7.10 for schools in March of 2008,
the LinuxWorld event will have local and global components. LinuxWorld
attendees will be able to participate by hacking older hardware and
installing the operating systems at work stations set up on the show floor.
In addition, LinuxWorld will host a collection site by the Alameda County
Computer Resource Center (ACCRC) to collect old computers donated by
LinuxWorld attendees. The Installfest will go global by posting the
scripts, ISO images, tips, and collateral online for Linux users groups
(LUGs) to host Installfest for Schools in their own neighborhoods.
Volunteers in Bellingham WA, and Portland OR, have already signed up to
organize Installfests for Schools in their neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
"Installfest is a tremendous effort that brings the Linux community
together for a great cause, by providing computers to underprivileged
schools, and promoting the use of open source software to new users," said
Melinda Kendall, Vice President and General Manager of LinuxWorld
Conference &amp; Expo.  "Installfest also keeps tons of toxic electronic
waste from entering our landfills so it's a win-win situation for the
event, the community, the schools, and the environment. We are really
excited to have the opportunity to play a role in this endeavor." 
</p>

<p>
Volunteers can help the effort by donating an old computer, helping to
refurbish computers on site at LinuxWorld, or by helping to organize an
event in their neighborhood. For more information or to learn how you can
help, please visit:<br> <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LinuxWorld to host Free Community Days at SF Expo</h3>

<p>
IDG has announced several open Community Days slated for the upcoming
LinuxWorld conference and expo. Registrants for a Community Day can attend
community sessions, keynotes and community BOFs for free.
</p>

<p>
Currently there are four community conferences scheduled on separate days
at
LinuxWorld:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Ubucon, for the Ubuntu community
<li> openSUSE
<li> Moblin World Tour focusing on Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs)
<li> PostgreSQL
</ul>

</p>

<p>
In another new item for LinuxWorld, The Open Voting Consortium (OVC) has
teamed-up with LinuxWorld to host a demonstration of open source voting at
this summer's LinuxWorld event. Attendees will have a unique opportunity to
use an open source voting system to cast a mock ballot for the 2008
Presidential election, as well as witness how the votes are tallied and
available for recount using this system.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">oCERT keeps Open Source Secure</h3>

<p>
A volunteer-based open source security clearinghouse for security
vulnerabilities helps large and small FOSS efforts. The Open Source
Computer Emergency Response Team, or oCERT, provides security support to
Open Source projects affected by security incidents or vulnerabilities, in
the same way that national CERTs offer security services for their
respective countries.
</p>

<p>
While open source code is assumed to be more secure because more eyeballs
get to look at it, not all projects have the requisite security experience
to understand infrastructure level security concerns. oCERT can help
smaller FOSS projects with security vulnerability research and assessment.
The oCERT effort has attracted organizations such as Google and the Open
Source Lab as sponsors.
</p>

<p>
From their website:
</p>

<blockquote>
"The service aims to help both large infrastructures, like major
distributions, and smaller projects that can't afford a full-blown security
team and/or security resources. This means aiding coordination between
distributions and small project contacts. The goal is to reduce the impact
of compromises on small projects with little or no infrastructure security,
avoiding the ripple effect of badly communicated or handled compromises,
which can currently result in distributions shipping code which has been
tampered with."
<br>
"oCERT also provides security vulnerability mediation for the security
community, having reliable security contacts between registered projects
and reporters that need to get in touch with a specific project regarding
infrastructure security issues. "
</blockquote>

<p>
Since their March launch,  oCERT has issued 5 security advisories, the most
recent in June.<br>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Breaks Into Top 5 on Supercomputer List</h3>

<p>
The Top 500 Supercomputers list was released at the International
Supercomputing Conference (ISC) in Dresden, Germany in June. Sun took the
#4 position with its deployment of the Sun Constellation System at the
Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin.
</p>

<p>
New additions to the Sun Constellation System family announced at ISC are
the Sun Blade X6450 server module which features 2 or 4 quad core Intel
Xeon processors, providing up to 7.37 TFlops in a single Constellation
System Rack and the Sun Datacenter Switch 3x24 (a smaller version of the
Sun Datacenter Switch 3456), which features 72 DDR 4X Infiniband ports.
Together, these new additions to the Sun Constellation System allow
customers to build mid-size clusters using the same architecture as that
deployed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).
</p>

<p>
The Lustre File System is an open source solution for easy aggregation of
tens of thousands of cluster nodes and petabytes of storage into one file
system. Lustre can achieve &gt;90% of raw bandwidth I/O.
</p>

<p>
Other key Sun note-worthies:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Based on the Sun Constellation System, TACC's Ranger supercomputer is
the highest ranking system built on an open architecture.
<li> Sun's Lustre File System manages 6 of the top 10 systems and nearly
half of the top 50 systems.
<li> Nearly half of the top 50 systems are archiving data on Sun storage.
</ul>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Canonical Showcases 'Ubuntu Netbook Remix'</h3>

<p>
At the Computex conference in Taiwan, Canonical announced a reworked
desktop image of Ubuntu built specifically for a new category of
ultra-portable Internet devices netbooks. These are affordable,
power-efficient, small screen devices, based on low-power architectures
like the Intel Atom processor. This version of Ubuntu allows consumers to
send e-mail and instant messages, and to surf the Internet with small and
lightweight devices.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu Netbook Remix is built to provide a great user experience leveraging
Ubuntu's reputation for delivering operating systems that "just work" in
the desktop environment. The Remix is based on the standard Ubuntu Desktop
Edition with a faster access launcher allowing users to get online more
quickly. It will also enable device manufacturers to get to market rapidly
with netbooks. Canonical is also working with ISVs to ensure that popular
desktop applications are certified on Ubuntu, and will run on the Ubuntu
Netbook Remix. Canonical is already working with a number OEMs to deliver
the software on devices later in 2008.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu Netbook Remix leverages Moblin technologies optimized for the Intel
Atom processor. Intel and Canonical are working to create a next generation
computing experience across a new category of affordable Internet-centric,
portable devices including Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs), netbooks,
nettops and embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
OEMs looking to ship Ubuntu Netbook Remix should contact
netbooks@canonical.com. More information on the product can be found here:

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Firefox 3</h3>

<p>Firefox 3 is officially out with great fanfare and an attempt to enter
the Guinness Book for most downloads on a single day, with the amazing mark
of over eight million downloads in 24 hours. The Guinness World Records has
been asked to certify this result; this may take until sometime in July.
Log files are being audited at Open Source Labs at Oregon State University
to remove duplicates and failed downloads.</p>

<p>
The peak rate claimed was 17,000 downloads a minute. The download servers
were overwhelmed in the first few hours, but they were able to meet the
demand after some reconfiguration.
</p>

<p>
A web research firm, Xiti, reported in March that Firefox had about a 30%
share of the European browser market.  With the latest version out, and
many local languages supported, that percentage should climb.
</p>

<p>New features of this release includes better overall performance,
integrated phishing protection, a smart location bar with better auto
complete functions, anti-virus software integration, a re-designed download
manager that supports resuming downloads, and much, much more.</p>

<p>
One long-sought feature now in FireFox 3 is the ability directly send an
e-mail from on-line services such as Yahoo Mail by clicking on a "mailto"
link.  Previously, "mailto" links would open desktop programs.
</p>

<p>
In his ZDnet blog, Adrian Kingsley-Hughes ran the SunSpider JavaScript
benchmark against FireFox 3 RC1 and RC3 and compared this to his results
with Opera 9.5, Safari 1.5, IE 7 and the IE 8 beta. All tests were done on
the same hardware.  FireFox 3 swept the Javascript benchmark.  Here's the
test result chart:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat's new oVirt Virtualization Platform</h3>

<p>
In mid-June announcements at the Red Hat Summit, the company reported on a
new stand-alone hypervisor offering and a virtualization management
platform. The core technology was developed by the Red Hat's sponsored
oVirt open source project.
</p>

<p>
Red Hat's oVirt management platform delivers a cross-platform management
solution allowing customers to centrally manage their entire virtual
infrastructure, crossing hypervisor and vendor boundaries to provide a
solution that eliminates the complexity of managing virtualization across
the enterprise.
</p>

<p>
oVirt uses Red Hat's open source libvirt management framework that provides
hypervisor-agnostic management interfacing, allowing the same tools to
manage multiple different hypervisors. Libvirt already supports six
hypervisors: Xen, KVM, QEMU, OpenVZ, Linux Containers (LVX) and Solaris
LDoms and the list is growing. The libvirt standard has been embraced by
leading OEMs, ISVs and operating system vendors.
</p>

<p>
The beta can be downloaded from <a
href="http://ovirt.org/">http://ovirt.org/</a>.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss in the Cloud</h3>

<p>
Red Hat also announced that the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform has
become the first supported Java application server available on Amazon EC2,
joining Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Developers, enterprises and startups can
now use JBoss Enterprise Application Platform on Amazon EC2 for on-demand
compute processing.  This is currently in Beta.
</p>

<p>
JBoss Enterprise is the second Red Hat solution to be offered through
Amazon EC2. Red Hat Enterprise Linux was made available on-demand on EC2 in
November 2007.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun VirtualBox Breaks Five Million Downloads; Supports All Major

first free hypervisor to support all major host operating systems,
including Mac OS X, Linux, Wind0ws, Solaris and OpenSolaris. The software
can be downloaded free of charge at www.virtualbox.com and www.openxvm.org
.
</p>

<p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Red Hat Middleware Architecture</h3>

<p>
Red Hat has created a new middleware architecture for their
internally-developed applications that further casts a unique Red Hat
development strategy.
</p>

<p>
The new middleware architecture is broadly based on JBoss technology. It
includes an Enterprise Service Bus implementing a Services Oriented
Architecture (SOA); Seam, of course, the JBoss integration framework; the
JBoss Business Process Modeling suite (JBPM); and Drools, the JBoss rules
processing environment. The entire stack runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
taking advantage of the operating system tools for virtualization,
provisioning, configuration, and other functionality. The full technical
architecture incorporates Cobbler/Koan for network booting,JBoss SOA, Xen,
LVM, Git for distributed, offline source code management, Maven, and more.
</p>

<p>
According to Lee Congdon, Chief Information Officer at Red Hat : "Cobbler
is a provisioning and update server that supports deployments via network
booting, virtualization, and reinstalls of existing systems. A significant
advantage of Cobbler is that it integrates multiple technologies and
reduces the need for the user to understand the details of each. The update
features of Cobbler integrate yum mirroring and kickstart."
</p>

<p>
"Koan, which is an acronym for 'Kickstart over a Network', is an emerging
technology that configures machines from remote Cobbler servers. Koan also
enables the use of virtualization and re-installs from a Cobbler server.
When launched, it requests install information from the server and creates
a virtual guest or replaces the machine it is running on. "
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Announces Carrier Grade MySQL Cluster 6.3 at NXTcomm</h3>

<p> At NXTcomm, Sun announced the latest version of its open source
database platform for carrier grade telecommunications environments: MySQL
Cluster Carrier Grade Edition 6.3. MySQL Cluster is a high availability
"shared nothing" database and is at the heart of subscriber data management
systems for leading network equipment providers including Alcatel-Lucent,
Nokia, Siemens Networks, and Nortel.  </p>

<p> Sun Chairman Scott McNealy took the stage at NXTcomm to deliver a
keynote address which touched upon the arrival of convergence in the
telecom space and the importance of sharing in this new environment.  His
main charge for network operators was that they should strive harder to
package and offer services and content directly to customers, rather than
offering them network access and connectivity alone.  "Become a destination
site, or the destination site will become you," McNealy told the audience.
</p>

<p> During a private lunch with press and industry analysts later that
afternoon, McNealy expounded upon the potential for open source software to
be a "game-changer" in the communications market as it has in other
markets. As the industry becomes more software-driven, he said, more
players in the space need to take advantage of the technical and cost
advantages of free, open source software. McNealy repeated the point many
times during his NXTcomm keynote saying, "Did we mention it's free?" </p>

<p> MySQL Cluster 6.3 includes geographical replication, 'five nines'
(99.999%) availability, online schema management, and disk-based data
capability that allows for storage of both highly transactional and
persistent data.  </p>

<p> MySQL Cluster is available under the open source GPL license for a
range of popular operating systems, including Solaris, RHEL and SUSE Linux,
and Mac OS X. Sun also offers commercial licensing, expert consulting, and
technical support for MySQL Cluster. More information is available at <a
href="http://www.mysql.com/cluster/">http://www.mysql.com/cluster/</a>.
