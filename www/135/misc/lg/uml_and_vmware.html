Hi list,
</p>

<p>
Hope everyone is well here <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
I am little bit confused and seeking your guidance. I like to run a virtual 
machine for experiment with different S/W. Both UML and vmware are there. I 
like the S/W which gives less overhead to the CPU. occupies less Ram. 
Provides faster speed and performance. In this scenario which will be 
better ? could any one suggest ?
</p>

<p>
PS: Assume that both the virtual machines running with exactly same number of 
applications.
</p>

<p>
Please CC to me.
</p>

<p>
thanks...

Ah, subjectivity is what you want.  I use both VMWare and UML at work.
 We're just switching over to using UML since that's less strain on
the box that the VMWare server runs.  We found that testing our own
software inside VMWare to be a little hit and miss -- notably that
VMWare crashes a lot, and doesn't always emulate the hardware aspects
as best it might.
</p>

<p>
So far UML is working out for us great.
</p>

<p>
Apart from a "me too" reply, was there anything specific you wanted to know?

Thanks a lot Thomas for the discussion. Based on this
discussion I like to try UML <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
thanks once again.

between UML and VMware, maybe I tend to pick UML. To get the best of 
UML, I suggest to patch your host kernel with the latest SKAS3 patch. I 
heard the patch is already merged with mainline kernel, but I am not so 
sure. You can also grab the Blaisorblade patchset, this patchset 
includes all the latest patch for UML to be applied on host and the 
guest. Basically UML <strong>may</strong> works better because there is less 
instruction translation involved, it just intercepts the system calls 
and throw it back to UML kernel. On the contrary, VMWare intercepts 
privileged instructions and simulate the work with other unpriviledged 
instruction. So we can say, UML is lighter compared to VMWare, but maybe 
the situation can change if both support the Intel VT/ AMD pacifica 
technology flawlessly
</p>

<p>
But if you somehow are unable to patch the host kernel, you can try 
SKAS0 mode. It performs less than SKAS3, but still better than the old 
TT mode.
</p>

<p>
Besides them, I also suggest you to take a look on Linux Vserver, 
Qemu+kqemu/kvm, Xen and openVZ. We can't talk much about them within 
this short e-mail, so I just encourage you to see in case one of them 
fits better with your need.

Thanks a lot for your suggestive discussion.  Most of the
users have voted for UML, so I think I should
go for UML. and yes I have also heard about Xen but don't
have any idea about how superior xen is than UML.
thanks.

The Xen site and the wikipedia have some nice tables explaining some
of the differences between the different virtualisations available.
Here is a brief summary:
</p>

<p>
1. chroot: Shares process space. File system access is restricted.
   Further restrictions can be imposed by the use of capabilities.
   Does not need kernel changes.
</p>

<p>
2. vserver: Access to process space is restricted. The use of
   capabilities and contexts is made simpler by vserver-utils.
   Needs kernel changes.
</p>

<p>
3. UML: run linux as a separate process with a mix of virtual and
   real hardware. Can optimize this process as it is also "linux".
   Does not need root privilege to run. Kernel changes not required
   but are useful.
</p>

<p>
4. Qemu, VMWare etc.: Run any O/S as a separate process with a mix of
   virtual and real hardware. Harder to optimize but due to some
   recent changes to CPU support for virtualisation this can be run a
   bit faster than it could be before. Does not need root privilege to run.
</p>

<p>
5. Xen: run linux and other O/S's as separate processes with lower overhead
   by means of the Xen virtualisation interface. This can also make
   use the CPU support for virtualisation. Needs changes to "base"
   kernel to run.
</p>

<p>
In the case of 3-5 the "process" kernel version can be different from
the "base" kernel.
</p>
