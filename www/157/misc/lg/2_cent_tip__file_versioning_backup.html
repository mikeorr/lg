[For some reason, I thought I'd submitted this ages ago; searching LG
shows that I was apparently wrong.]
</p>

<p>
There are lots of times - e.g., when you're editing a critical file, or
want to keep multiple versions of a script that you're developing - that
you want to take a snapshot of your current directory, or at least of
some of the files within it. I've been using the following script for
the past several years, and it's proven to be flexible, powerful, and
fully sufficient for the task.
</p>

<p>
Note that you can also define a ".backup" file within the directory
(this should contain the names of the files to be backed up, one per
line) so you can run "backup" without any arguments and still have it
snapshoot the right files. Enjoy!
</p>

Usage:
	$name -h
	$name [-a] [file[s]]
	
	-h	Show this help
	-a	Back up all specified files unconditionally
	
	The list of files to be backed up can be defined either in a
	.backup file in the current directory, on the command line, or as a
	combination of the two. The files will be saved in a "backup"
	subdirectory, with a timestamp extension appended to their
	filenames.
 
	If the latest archived copy of a specified file does not differ
	from the current version, the file will not be backed up unless the
	"-a" option is used.

My solution to a similar need. I use a wrapper for vi which backs up 
every file edited. I've been using this for many years...

So, do you go in there once in a while and clean out the old files? It
seems like, after a while, you'd have a lot of stuff in there including
some huge files that would eat up all your disk space.
</p>

<p>
Also, have you looked at all the backup-related functionality that Vim
provides? Try ':help backup'; there are lots of flexible options to do
this, including time-stamped extensions. E.g. (in ~/.vimrc):
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
" Use a timestamp as a backup extension
au BufWritePre * let &amp;bex = '-' . strftime("%Y-%b-%d-%X") . '~'
" Save backups in ~/tmp; fail over to /tmp in case of problems
set backupdir=~/tmp,/tmp
set backup
</pre>

Neat. 
</p>

<p>
Emacs provides numbered backups and automatic cleanup. My .emacs includes:
</p>

<pre>
(setq version-control 't)		; make numbered backups
(setq vc-make-backup-files 't)		; keep backups for files in version control
(setq delete-old-versions 't)		; delete excess backups without asking
(setq kept-old-versions 2)		; keep the 2 oldest backups
(setq kept-new-versions 3)		; keep the 3 newest backups
</pre>

Yes I clean it periodically but not very often. Right now there are ~3k
files in my vibak dating back ~3 years and totaling ~700MB.
</p>

<p>
No I didn't know about the backup functions I'll check it out. Thanks.
