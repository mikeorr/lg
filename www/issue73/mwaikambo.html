<P> I'm sure the vast majority of sysadmins out there have occasionally acquired
new server hardware that their latest Linux distribution
does not support. This is usually not a problem because
as long as you can install the base system you can then graft the other bits in
once it's running. The only exception is when your root device
isn't supported; that's when the excitement begins.

<P> The key here is that the hardware is not distro supported.  Most of the time you'll
may find that the most recent kernels <EM>do</EM> support your hardware and hence, upgrading to
the newer kernel would solve your problem. But it's a chicken-and-egg situation
since you don't have a running system yet. With this article I hope to
alleviate some of the headaches of these problematic installations so that you
can get on with your usual duties sooner. The distribution i shall use as an
example is Red Hat 7.1 (hereupon referred to as RH7.1), and the server root device
is a RAID device on an Adaptec 2100 host adapter, but of course I will try to
generalise so that you will be able to adapt this advice for just about any
unsupported device (e.g. IDE RAID controllers or other SCSI HBAs).

<P> The kernel shipped with RH7.1 is 2.4.2-2, a 2.4.2-ac based kernel with extra
patches by Red Hat. My target kernel will be 2.4.10-ac1. I recommend "-ac" since
Alan Cox incorporates lots of experimental drivers in his kernels for testing
and hence usually has support for various devices first before the mainstream
Linus kernel , which he merges to later. In order to build the kernels you will
require an additional Linux box to do the compilations on (you might want to
read the kernel-HOWTO if you're a bit rusty) and to prepare the bootdisks. When
creating the bootdisk kernel image you can make good guesses based on the
kernel ring buffer output from <CODE>dmesg</CODE>). Size is the objective here since we have
to be able to fit the new kernel into the same space the original took, there
really isn't much leeway so we have to pick carefully. Here is a rough outline
of our new configuration with explanations. (Parts removed.)

After the kernel compilation is done, it's time to move the new kernel to the
previous installation kernel's location, we do this by mounting the bootdisk
used by the installation. You will require loopback block device support to do
this.

<PRE>
# cd /tmp
# cp /cdrom/boot/boot.img .
# mkdir bootdisk
# mount -t msdos boot.img bootdisk -o loop
# cp /usr/src/linux-2.4.10-ac11/arch/i386/boot/bzImage bootdisk/vmlinuz
</PRE>
An rdev isn't required because syslinux passes the appropriate root device (ie
 initrd)
<PRE>
# umount bootdisk
# dd if=boot.img of=/dev/fd0
</PRE>

Lets compare sizes for this particular kernel build.
<PRE>
Original installation kernel : 652k
Custom installation kernel : 632k
Custom "normal" kernel : 951k
</PRE>
We obviously wouldn't be able to fit in a full-featured kernel onto our
bootdisk.

<P> Once that's done, we have a "new" installation disk with support for our root
device. We now use the bootdisk to start the installation. I recommend using
text-based installs since we removed framebuffer and mouse support to minimise
the kernel size. Upon completion of the installation you will have an installed
system but still won't be able to boot from the device. The reason
is that your distribution will install the kernel packages from its
installation medium, and not the one used during installation. We have to now go
back to the compile box and do the following to create a bootdisk.

<PRE>
# rdev bzImage /dev/sda1
# dd if=bzImage of=/dev/fd0
</PRE>

(Use your actual root device instead of /dev/sda1.)

<P> When that's done and you've booted to a shell, you can then unpack a new tarball
on your target computer/server and configure as required. You may want to take
the distribution config file and build on that by doing.

<PRE>
# cd /usr/src/linux-2.4.10-ac11
# cp /home/zwane/config-2.4.2-2 .config
# make oldconfig
</PRE>
Answer the prompted questions, then go through menuconfig to check the final
configuration before compilation:
<PRE>
# make menuconfig
# make dep bzImage modules modules_install
</PRE>

Copy the resulting image to your kernel location (e.g /boot/vmlinuz) and edit
your lilo configuration (or skip lilo if you're using grub ;) You will have to
do a final rdev to your new kernel, since the kernel build process "detects"
your current root device when compiling and sets it in kernels you build in
that session. Or you can edit the toplevel Makefile (e.g.
/usr/src/linux-2.4.10-ac11/Makefile) and change ROOT_DEVICE to your device.

<PRE>
# rdev /boot/vmlinuz /dev/sda1
</PRE>

You should be able to reboot now and enjoy the fruits of your labour!
