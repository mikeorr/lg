   MI/X for Macintosh
   A Professional, Free X Server.
</p>

<p>
   Mac computers run the TNT products <a href="http://www.microimages.com/index.htm">http://www.microimages.com/index.htm</a>
   through the unique MicroImages X Server (MI/X), which MicroImages supplies
   with every TNT product for Macintosh.
</p>

<p>
   MicroImages is also pleased to make this X Server freely available for
   Macintosh users who do not have any of the TNT products. You may want to
   use your Power Macs as X terminals in a network environment -- MI/X works
   fine as an X terminal emulator. You may also want to make your PC a true X
   Server and run multiple X clients from your desktop. MI/X works fine
   there, too -- after all, that's why MicroImages developed MI/X in the
   first place.
</p>

<p>
   If you can configure a telnet session, you know enough to use MI/X. Since
   MI/X for the Macintosh is made freely available, MicroImages cannot
   respond to individual user requests for technical support. However,
   MicroImages maintains MI/X as the X Server for its line of TNT
   professional products <a href="http://www.microimages.com/index.htm">http://www.microimages.com/index.htm</a>, so you will
   find MI/X a stable and robust performer.
</p>

<p>
   If you have any questions comments or suggestions regarding MI/X for
   Macintosh contact us at mix@microimages.com

   User Reviews
</p>

<p>
   A free X Window server for Power Macs. It's got all the requisite features
   - host allow/deny, background configurability, etc. - and comes with twm,
   although you can use any other window manager.
</p>

<p>
   "Although it was not as easy to configure as come commercial X server
   software, I was connecting to our UNIX server relatively effortlessly.
   It's a great tool to have in our computer lab to connect to the
   workstation for one of our research projects." - Jiro Fujita
</p>

<p>
   "This is an amazing piece of software - especially considering the price.
   MI/X performs well on my 7200/90 and is very much easier to set up and use
   than MacX or its reincarnation, Xoftware. I noted a few minor bugs with
   screen redrawing when using the backing store but on first impression this
   seems to be a useful and usable X-server." - David Robertson, Programmer,
   Department of Computer Science, University of Otago
</p>

<p>
   "Works very well, even on older Macs. Used within a primary school to
   control a Linux gateway from a number of PowerMacs ranging from PM6250 to
   Rev B iMacs. Currently using it on a 9.2 iBook2 to interact with my x86
   Linux server at home." - Brad Macpherson
