I've been working on some scripts recently that spawn extra windows, and
kill them off for the purposes of displaying images.  What I can't
figure out is how to programatically lower a window after I've opened
it, without delving deeply into some C programming against X that would
necessitate a major learning curve.

xwit is likely your friend here:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
xwit -lower -names somewindowname
</pre>

<p>
Of course, if you used a proper window manager such as FVWM this can
be achieved canonically as:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
DestroyModuleConfig FE:*
*FE: add_window "ThisWindow (SomeWindowName|OtherWindowName) Lower"
 
AddToFunc StartFunction I Module FvwmEvent FE
</pre>

<p>
Which would cause windows with "SomeWindowName" or "OtherWindowName"
as either their window name, resource or class to be matched and
lowered.
</p>

<p>
Using recent FVWM 2.5.X version I added an "InitialMapCommand" style
option, which reduces the above to:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
Style SomeWindowName InitialMapCommand Lower
</pre>

Is it bare X or is some window manager, such as TWM, involved?
