<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P class=LG>This article is intended to help those new to either Linux or Java
set their machines up to run Java applications, as well as providing
an effective environment for developing new Java applications. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Specifically I shall explain
 how to set up Sun's <B>1.1.x JDK</B> and other related
packages. This is not the only way to run Java on Linux. 
</P>
<P class=LG><A HREF="http://www.blackdown.org/">Blackdown.org</A> now offers
the new <B>1.2.x JDK</B> for Linux (at the time of writting this is still a pre-release version). I only recommend using this if
you are also using the new 2.2.x Linux kernel. If you choose to
install the <b>1.2.x JDK</b> then please note that you do not need to obtain
the <b>Swing</b> and <b>JSDK</b> packages, since they are already included. Also you
may find some compatibility problems if you use older Java
applications with the <b>1.2.x JDK</b>. In particular if you intend to
implement the <B>javapache</B> extensions to <B>Apache</B> you will
need to use <B>JDK 1.1.x.</B> 
</P>
<P class=LG>In addition there exist other third party Java environments and
Java compilers such as IBM's <B>jikes</B>. Use these at your own
peril! IMHO Sun have defined and developed the Java language so I
expect their Java environments to be the most standard. Other
environments may be of interest, but I cannot cover them here. 
<p class=LG>
Unfortunately the development of the Java language for Linux lags the development for other operating systems.   Having said that there are still many advantages to using Java on Linux, not least of which is the easy availability of sophisticated development tools.  If you have not seen a recent version of <b>DDD</b> (The Dynamic Display De-bugger), you may not realise that it now supports Java.  If you write any programs under Linux <b>DDD</b> is a <i><b>must have</b></i> utility.
<p class=LG>
<b>Why use Java at all?</b>
<p class=LG>
Java's greatest advantage is also its greatest disadvantage.  For reasons given below, the fact that the same Java code can be run on any platform without re-compiling is responsible for the fact that Java applications can appear slow.  It is this slowness that has lead some to question the need to use Java at all.
<p class=LG>
It is true that if speed in loading and running an application is the only criteria for choosing a programming language then I would never consider using Java at all.  Although applications such as <b>jedit</b> and the Java cd player described in earlier editions of this e-zine are functionaly equivalent to applications written in C they are very slow to start up and I am loath to use them when I have much faster alternatives.
<p class=LG>
But Java is not meant for such applications. Java excells in what it was originally designed for, which is to provide a means of making applications available over the Internet.   Over the Internet the speed of loading an application is not really important when compared to the time it takes to download the application.
<p class=LG>
Now consider your friendly ISP, and the servers that provide you with Internet access.   Your ISP (even your local Intranet) needs the fastest machines possible given certain criteria (cost etc).  The cost of the actual server may not be important when compared to the software investment of server-side applications.  Using Java to implement server-side applications leaves your ISP free to choose the best machine architecture and operating system without having to worry about the cost and feasibility of re-implementing such applications.  They can simply be copied from one machine to another.   Perhaps one day Microsoft will develop a reliable operating system that is superior to a *NIX operating system.  If that day ever comes I will want to change from Linux, using Java will allow me to do that and keep exactly the same server-side applications I am running now.
<p class=LG>
If you only want to use a stand-alone computer, with no network access, either locally or over the Internet, then you probably do not need or want to consider using Java.   But if your machine is going to be part of a local network or the Internet then the use of Java should be taken very seriously.  Java is not the only way to develop network applications. For instance Perl can be used in a very similar way. But Java is a very attractive option.
</P>
<a name="jd1"></a><H2>Obtaining the JDK</H2>
<P class=LG>Please <B>do not</B> obtain your JDK directly from Sun. They
provide support only for Microsoft Windows, Solaris etc.
Instead go to <A HREF="http://www.blackdown.org/">Blackdown.org</A>
and find the version you require. 
</P>
<P class=LG>All other packages mentioned here <B>should</B> be obtained from
Sun. 
</P>
<P class=LG>The Linux port of the JDK can either be found on a Linux
distribution disk, or can be found at http://blackdown.org. You will
find you have a bewildering choice of files to install. There is the
JRE as well as the JDK. I recommend you get the full JDK package
since it contains everything in the others. 
</P>
<a name="jd2"></a><H2>Kernel Support For Java</H2>
<P class=LG>Linux was possibly the first operating system to provide direct
kernel support for Java. This allows Linux to run both Java
applications and Java applets directly, without the need for a
browser such as Netscape. But if you think direct kernel support
means that the kernel has anything to do with actually running Java
code you are sadly mistaken. 
</P>
<P class=LG>To understand what is happening you need to realize that Java is
really only one step removed from running interpreted programs rather
than compiled programs. In the early days of computing, it was common
to use an interpreted language, such as GW-BASIC, to write simple
applications. The code that was written was never compiled into a
program, rather the code would be parsed by an interpreter which
would perform the actual execution of instructions. This is a very
inefficient way of doing things and the results will always be slow. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Java differs from an interpreted language, such as early versions
of BASIC, in that the source code is compiled. But the source is not
compiled into something a computer can directly execute as would be
the case if you compiled a C program with gcc. Instead the source
code is <I>byte-compiled</I> into a standard format. The reason that
the same Java application can be run on any platform is precisely
because this <I>byte-code</I> is in a standard format. The programs
<B>java</B> and <B>appletviewer</B>, provided by Sun or Blackdown.org
perform the function of parsing this <I>byte-code</I> and executing
the instructions. This is the reason Java applications can appear
slow, the <I>byte-code</I> must be parsed by an interpreter before it
can be executed, though the situation is not nearly as bad as it was
with early BASIC programs, since the <I>byte-code</I> has already
been optimized by the java compiler. 
</P>
<P class=LG>When you compile Java support into the Linux kernel what you are
really doing is telling the operating system to invoke either <B>java</B>
or <B>appletviewer</B> when a request is made to execute a java
application. Linux is simply giving you a shorthand way of saying
'<B>appletviewer <I>myapplication</I></B>'. 
</P>
<P class=LG>For this reason you need to tell the kernel where your Java
executables are kept. If you obtain the JDK from Blackdown.org then
the chances are that java and appletviewer will be placed in
/usr/local/java/bin. If you install the JDK from a S.u.S.E.
distribution disk then they will be in /usr/lib/java/bin. Of course
you might have installed the JDK to some non-standard location. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Before you re-compile your Linux kernel, edit the file
/usr/src/linux/fs/binfmt_java.c to reflect the situation you actually
have. 
<p class=LG>
<PRE>
     #include &lt;linux/malloc.h&gt;
     #include &lt;linux/binfmts.h&gt;

     #define _PATH_JAVA      &quot;<font color="red">/usr/local/java/bin/java</font>&quot;          // Replace with correct location for your system.
     #define _PATH_APPLET    &quot;<font color="red">/usr/local/java/bin/appletviewer</font>&quot;  // Replace with correct location for your system.
     #define _PATH_SH        &quot;/bin/bash&quot; 

     char binfmt_java_interpreter[65] = _PATH_JAVA; 
     char binfmt_java_appletviewer[65] = _PATH_APPLET; </PRE>
<P class=LG>
Please note that the references to <B>java</B> and <B>appletviewer</B>
should be to the actual location of the binaries and not to any
<I>symbolic link</I> you might have created. In the example above the
directory /usr/local/java might be a symbolic link to
/usr/lib/java-1.1.7, but the actual file refereed to is not a
symbolic link, it actually exists in /usr/lib/java-1.1.7/bin. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Now you can decide if you want to compile Java support directly
into the kernel, or have it as a module. I choose to use a module.
The only comment I feel necessary is that when I try to execute a
<B>html</B> file kernld will not automatically load the binfmt_java
module, so I must &quot;<B><I>insmod binfmt_java</I></B>&quot; first.

</P>
<P class=LG><B>Execute a HTML file?</B> 
</P>
<P class=LG>Yes, Linux will allow you to execute certain HTML files as though
they are applications. To understand why you would want to do this
you need to understand the difference between a Java applet and a
full blown Java application. Whilst a Java application provides all
the resources it needs itself, an applet does not. Normally an applet
needs to be included in a web page which is viewed by a Java enabled
browser such as Netscape or HotJava because it has no top level
window of its own. An alternative is to use the <B>appletviewer</B>
program to view the applet. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Linux gives you a further option. if you add the line 
</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.50cm">        &lt;!--applet--&gt;</PRE>
<P class=LG>
to a HTML file (and '&lt;' <B><I>must</I></B> be the first character
in the file), and <B>chmod</B> the file to be executable, then you
will be able to launch the applet(s) embedded in the file directly. 
</P>
<P class=LG>In a similar manner a Java application is made up of one or more
<B><I>class</I></B> files. To make the application executable by
linux simply <B>chmod</B> the top level <B><I>class</I></B> file so
it is executable. 
</P>
<a name="jd3"></a><H2>JDK</H2>
<P class=LG>Reading the documentation that comes with the <B>JDK</B>, we find
that there is no need to set the <B>CLASSPATH</B> or <B>JDK_HOME</B>
environments. Whilst this is true for the <B>JDK</B> itself, I have
found that there are some applications that expect these environments
to be set. In any case setting them will not cause you any harm and I
recommend you take the following steps to install the <B>JDK</B>
correctly: 
</P>
<OL>
	<LI>export
	PATH=$PATH:<I>{JDK_HOME}</i>/bin
	<LI>export JDK_HOME=<I>{JDK_HOME}</I>
        <li>export JAVA_HOME=<i>{JDK_HOME}</i>
	<LI>export CLASSPATH=./:<i>{JDK_HOME}</i>/lib/classes.zip
</OL>
<P class=LG>Where <I>{JDK_HOME}</I> is the top-level directory to which you
installed the <B>JDK</B>. 
</P>
<a name="jd4"></a><H2>Java Beans</H2>
<P class=LG>The JavaBeans API allows you to create component software in the
Java programming language. Components are complete, self-contained,
reusable software items that can be visually linked into any Java
program, applet or servlet. Such software items are refereed to as
Beans. Many Java IDE's are available, such as NetBeans or Visarj,
that use this technology to provide application builder tools.
Included in the package is <b>BeanBox</b>, a simple JavaBean IDE to get you
started. 
</P>
<P class=LG>When you startup <B>BeanBox</B>, by running <I>bin.sh</I> in the
<B><I>BDK/beanbox</I></B> sub-directory, three windows will open for
you: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The <B>BeanBox</B> window 
	</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="BeanBox.gif" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=550 BORDER=0></BLOCKQUOTE>
	<LI><P>A <B>ToolBox</B> window 
	</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="ToolBox.gif" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=136 HEIGHT=376 BORDER=0></BLOCKQUOTE>
	<LI><P>A <B>Properties</B> window 
	</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="Properties.gif" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=284 HEIGHT=76 BORDER=0></BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<P class=LG>The <B>ToolBox</B> initially contains a number of example beans,
you can add your own to create your own visual programming
environment. Select a bean by clicking your mouse on it. Then click
somewhere in the <B>BeanBox</B>. The javaBean will appear and a list
of its properties will appear in the <B>Properties</B> window. You
may then use the <B>Properties</b> window to customize the <b>JavaBean</B>
for your application. When you have finished adding Beans, and are
happy with the appearance of your application in the <B>BeanBox</B>
you can select <I>File/Make applet</I> from the <B>BeanBox</B>
windows menu and an applet complete with example html file will be
generated for you. 
</P>
<P class=LG>As should now be clear, JavaBeans provide a means to develop
applications without writing a single line of code. Of course you
need to write the Beans themselves but many third party vendors make
Beans available and the Internet is a fine place to look for new
components. 
</P>
<P class=LG>A feature of <B>JavaBeans</B> is that they are packed into the <B><I>JAR</I></B>
file format. This format has many advantages over java class files
including: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>File Compression</B> A JAR file may optionally be
	compressed for more efficient storage and faster download times. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Decreased Download Times</B> An entire <B>applet</B> may
	be bundled into a single JAR file. This means a users browser only
	needs to open a single connection to download your applet rather
	than a connection for each class file your applet requires. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Security</B> A JAR file can be digitally signed. This
	gives users the opportunity to grant your software security
	privileges it would not normally have, so long as the user is able
	to recognize your signature.
	</P>
</UL>
<P class=LG>Additional features are included in <B>JDK</B> 1.2.x including
package versioning, package sealing and packaging for extensions. 
</P>
<p class=LG><b>INSTALLATION</b>
<oL>
	<LI>Obtain the <B>BDK</B> from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/beans">http://java.sun.com/beans</A>
	
	<LI>Unpack the archive to a subdirectory, e.g. /usr/lib/BDK 
	<LI>Optionally add the new classes to your <B>CLASSPATH</B>. e.g.
	export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/lib/BDK/beanbox/classes 
	<LI>Enter the demo sub-directory and run &quot;make -f
	GNUMakefile&quot; 
	<LI>Enter the demo/html directory and make the files executable
	in the manner described above and try them out. 
	<LI>Enter the beanbox sub-directory and run &quot;run.sh&quot;. 
</ol>
<a name="jd5"></a><H2>Swing</H2>
<p class=LG>
Not all Java applications are equal! Some look better than others.  <b>Swing</b> provides several enhancements to the Java language.

Whilst you do not need <b>Swing</b> to develop and run Java applications and applets, you may well need it to compile or run certain Java applications (such as <b>jedit</b>) that are freely available on the Internet.
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="Swing.gif" NAME="Graphic1" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=790 HEIGHT=550 BORDER=0></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=LG>The Java Foundation Classes (<B>JFC</B>, this is included in the
Swing package), together with Swing, provide a set of &quot;lightweight&quot;
components that work the same on all platforms. Effectively they
provide GUI extensions to the Java language that can provide many
enhancements to the look and feel of your applications.
</P>
<P class=LG>The screen-shot above shows the initial screen when you start the
<B>swingset</B> application. This can be used to demonstrate the
enhancements Swing provides. by selecting a category such as <B><I>ListBox</I></B>
you will be able to display and alter the various options that are
available and so become familiar with the effects that Swing can
provide.
</P>
<P class=LG>An application I can recommend that makes full use of Swing is
<A HREF="http://www.gjt.org/~sp/jedit.html"><B>jedit</B></A>, a very
nice editor. This is available in full source code, and is suitable
for editing plain text files such as HTML, Java source, Perl scripts,
LaTeX documents, etc. The editor supports the inclusion of plug-ins
and a couple of trivial examples are included to get you started.
</P>
<P class=LG><b>INSTALLATION</b>
<p class=LG>
<ol>
<li>Unpack the Swing package (I recommend version 1.1) to the directory of your choice. e.g. <i>/usr/local/Swing</i>
<li>export SWING_HOME=<i>{SWING_HOME}</i>
<br>
<br>
optionally,
<li>Add the <i>.jar</i> files and <i>src.zip</i> under <i>{SWING_HOME}</i> to your <b>CLASSPATH</b>.
</ol>
<p class=LG>Where <i>{SWING_HOME}</i> is the directory under which you unpacked Swing.
</P>

<a name="jd6"></a><H2>Java Accessibility Utilities</H2>
<P class=LG>Actually, there are two packages here: <B>The Java Accessibility
API</B> and the <B>Java Accessibility Utilities</B> themselves. 
</P>
<P class=LG>The Java Accessibility API defines a contract between individual
user-interface components that make up a Java application and an
assistive technology that is providing access to that Java
application. If a Java application fully supports the Java
Accessibility API, then it should be compatible with, and friendly
toward, assistive technologies such as screen readers, screen
magnifiers, etc. With a Java application that fully supports the
Java Accessibility API, no off screen model would be necessary
because the API provides all of the information normally contained
in an off screen model. 
</P>
<P class=LG>In order to provide access to a Java application, an assistive
technology requires more than the Java Accessibility API: it also
requires support in locating the objects that implement the API as
well as support for being loaded into the Java virtual machine,
tracking events, etc. The Java Accessibility utility classes provide
this assistance. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="jaccess.gif" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=680 HEIGHT=500 BORDER=0></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=LG>As you may have guessed from the screen-shot above, the Java
Accessibility Utilities require that you have installed the Swing
package. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Several example utilities are
provided in the package. The screen-shot above shows the <B>Java
Monitor</B> which allows you to obtain information about objects
being displayed on the screen by a Java Virtual Machine. Also
included are: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><B>AWT Monitor</B> This is the same as the <B>Java Monitor</B>
	but does not require or support the Java Foundation Classes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Explorer</B> Explorer uses the Java Accessibility
	Utilities to examine accessible information about the objects in
	the Java Virtual Machine. It allows the user to select different
	methods for selecting the object to be examined: by following
	focus, by following the mouse, by following caret position, or by
	pressing the F1 when the pointer is over an object. Once an object
	has been selected for examination, Explorer displays the results of
	calling Java Accessibility API methods on that object. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Monkey</B> Like a monkey, Monkey &quot;swings&quot;
	through the component trees in a particular Java Virtual Machine
	and presents the hierarchy in two different ways. The first is the
	actual Component hierarchy and the second is the hierarchy viewed
	as Accessible objects. In addition, if the user clicks the right
	mouse button over a tree node in Monkey, Monkey will present the
	user with a pop-up menu containing options for manipulating the
	object. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Accessibility Monitor</B> Accessibility Monitor will
	monitor all accessible property change events on all of the
	non-transient objects in the virtual machine. In addition, if the
	user clicks the right mouse over the events presented in the table
	provided by AccessibilityMonitor, AccessibilityMonitor will present
	the user with a pop-up menu containing options for manipulating the
	associated object. 
	</P>
	<LI><P><B>Linker</B> Linker captures the Accessible hypertext
	information contained in the object underneath the mouse (the user
	the presses the F1 key), and displays a list of the the Accessible
	hyperlinks within that object in a table. Selecting one of the
	links and clicking &quot;Activate Selected Link&quot; will cause
	the hypertext object to follow the link selected (to update the
	display, move the mouse over the object and press F1 again). 
	</P>
</UL>
<p class=LG><b>INSTALLATION</b>
<p class=LG>This is a little different to the other packages mentioned here, since the different utilities included have to be explicitly enabled by you.
<p class=LG>
When you start any Java application you will also be able to automatically stat one of the utilities mentioned above by following the steps below:
<ol>
<li>Unpack the packace to the directory of your choice. e.g. /usr/local/jaccess
<li>Install the <b>Swing</b> package as described above.
<li>Add the new jar files to your CLASSPATH e.g. export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:<i>{jaccess_home}</i>/jaccess.jar:<i>{jaccess_home}</i>/jaccess-examples.jar
<li>Edit the <i>JDK_HOME/lib/awt.properties</i> file to enable <b>jaccess</b> by adding the following line:
<pre>
       AWT.EventQueueClass=com.sun.java.accessibility.util.EventQueueMonitor
</pre>
<li>Decide which utitility(s) you want to enable and add a line for each one to the awt.properties file.  For example to enable the <b>JavaMonitor</b> add the line:
<pre>
       AWT.assistive_technologies=JavaMonitor
</pre>
</ol>
<a name="jd7"></a><H2>JSDK</H2>
<P class=LG>The Java Servlet API is a standard extension to the Java
Development Kit. Servlet's are bodies of code that run inside
servers to extend their functionality. For example, servlet's offer
an efficient platform-independent replacement for CGI scripts.
Servers that can host servlet's are java-enabled servers that
respond to client requests. 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="model.gif" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=414 HEIGHT=145 BORDER=0>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P class=LG>The diagram above shows a typical use of a Java servlet. A HTTP
server is running a servlet that is responsible for taking data from
a HTML order-entry form and applies a companies rules for updating
their order database. Simply put, a java servlet is a servers
version of a java applet. As one might expect, since the server will
be running remotely and unattended (from a users viewpoint at least)
servlet's have no graphical user interface. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Servlet's provide a way to generate dynamic documents that is
both easier to write and faster to run. Servlet's also address the
problem of doing server-side programming with platform-specific
APIs: they are developed with the Java Servlet API, a standard Java
extension. 
</P>
<P class=LG>So use servlet's to handle HTTP client requests. For example,
have servlet's process data POSTed over HTTP using an HTML form,
including purchase order or credit card data. A servlet like this
could be part of an order-entry and processing system, working with
product and inventory databases, and perhaps an on-line payment
system. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Amongst the many other possible
uses for servlet's are the following: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Allowing collaboration between people. A servlet can handle
	multiple requests concurrently, and can synchronize requests. This
	allows servlet's to support systems such as on-line conferencing. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Forwarding requests. Servlet's can forward requests to other
	servers and servlet's. Thus servlet's can be used to balance load
	among several servers that mirror the same content, and to
	partition a single logical service over several servers, according
	to task type or organizational boundaries. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P class=LG>If you use Apache then you will be interested in the <B>javapache</B>
project, available from <A HREF="http://java.apache.org/">http://java.apache.org</A>.
To use this you will need to use the 1.1x JDK, and must use version
2.0 of the <B>JSDK</B>. Next month I hope to make an introduction to
this project available. 
</P>
<P class=LG>The JSDK is available for download from
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-server/servlets">http://java.sun.com/products/java-server/servlets</A>

</P>
<P class=LG>If you are using the newer 1.2.x JDK please remember you do not
need to download this package, since the JSDK is already included. 
</P>
<p class=LG><b>INSTALLATION</b>
<oL>
	<LI>Unpack the JSDK to your preferred location (e.g.
	/usr/lib/JSDK) 
	<LI>Add the <B>JSDK</B> /bin directory to your path. The best
	way to do this is to place a line 
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.50cm">        export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/JSDK/bin</PRE>
	to your <I>/etc/profile</I> file. 
	<LI><P>Add the JSDK Classes to your <B>CLASSPATH</B>, e.g. 
	<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.50cm">        export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:/usr/lib/JSDK/lib/jsdk.jar</PRE>
	<P>Again you can add this line to your <I>/etc/profile</I> file.

Each package includes its own documentation in HTML format. However, since you need to get your <b>JDK</b> from Blackdown.org, rather than from Sun, the documentation for the <b>JDK</b> will be missing from the package.

<P class=LG>Sun provides full documentation for both 1.1.x and 1.2.x versions
of the <B>JDK</B>. Documentation for the 1.1.x version exists for
version 1.1.3. I do not think it has been updated since then. 
</P>
<P class=LG>In the <B>demo</B> sub-directory you will find many examples.
Find the HTML files that launch java applets and make them
executable in the manner I have described above so you can run them
as conventional programs. 
</P>
<P class=LG>The <B>docs</B> subdirectory contains a complete programmers
guide to the <B>Java</B> language. This is further enhanced by the
<B>Java Tutorial</B>.

<P class=LG>Sun have a comprehensive Java tutorial which can get you up to
speed programming in Java very quickly. Both the entire tutorial and

<a name="jd10"></a><H2>Sun's HotJava Browser</H2>
<P class=LG>This is a web browser written entirely in Java. For that reason
even on a 133Mhz pentium class processor it is very slow. Its
advantage is that it is one of the very few browsers available for
Linux that can run Java applets. It is also very interesting for
other reasons. 
</P>
<P class=LG>HotJava is highly modular, the user interface is easily
customizable and has a small footprint (does not take up a large
amount of system resources). Well that is what Sun claims. I find in
practice that if I try loading java applets whilst running other
applications the browser will die on me. I would have thought that
if it does have a small footprint this would not happen - whatever. 
</P>
<P class=LG>Sun further claim that the browser is ideal for a variety of
devices - such as screen phones as well as desktop PC's. All I can
say is that until the browser can perform faster (on my pentium
class box with 32Meg ram it takes about three minuets to start up
and load the default screen), and is more reliable, then it is
unlikely to be of much use unless you have a very fast processor. 
</P>
<P class=LG>The heart of HotJava is the <B>HotJava HTML Component</B>. This
is a JavaBean that parses and renders HTML. This can be embedded
into your own applications, anything from a newsreader to a
microwave oven (yes there are microwaves and even fridges that give
you Internet access now), can make use of it to display information.

</P>
<P class=LG>HotJava supports the following

<a name="jd11"></a><H2>Next Month</H2>
<P class=LG>Last month I explained how to set up the Apache HTTP server. Next
month I intend to tie these two articles together by showing you how
to incorporate the <B>javapache</B> extensions to Apache so you can
use Java to create dynamic HTML pages and server side applications
to enhance your web site. 
</P>
<P class=LG>In a future article I shall give an overview of the available
Netscape Plug-ins and show how <I>simple</I> it is to develop your
own plug-ins. In the meantime I welcome your comments and
suggestions for future articles.
