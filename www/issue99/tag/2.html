I'm hunting for new desktop hardware and getting confused and somewhat

The best German computer magzine (c't) has of course plenty

profiles. My problem is, I want a decent performing raid 5 (burned to
often by sudden drive failure).

Do you expect to be so incredibly short of disk space that RAID1 isn't
an option?

Funny you should mention that; I met someone recently who got burned by
sudden drive failure on a RAID 1 system - and to their horror, while the
other drive was fine contents-wise, it was also in a state where it
couldn't be brought up normally to be looked at - expected a twin to be
present, and nobody wanted to risk it considering a "mew" drive the
master and wiping it.  It needed a visit to the drive recovery shop.

RAID is not a panacea - a cure-all - against hardware failure; it merely
helps. Usually, a lot.  But it's specifically <EM>not</EM> a solution against
slow corruption via software failure.  Anyone working with oversized
disks should seriously consider their backup-and-recovery plans too.

no -- raid1 would be an option. If some 50GB actual space are there that
should be enough for some time, (temp) video data won't need raid1.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
With recent consumer boards I seem to have the option of using IDE
drives, sure. Cheap huge drive space and all. If I understand the board
details right all of the regular ATA interfaces are on the PCI bus -- so
a raid with 3 or 4 drives there is hogging the PCI bus.
There are SATA interfaces which are <EM>not</EM> going through the PCI
interface but have a separate one -- just Linux seems not to happy with
SATA yet and most boards have 2 SATA drives -- not enough for raid5. If
I could be sure that a raid1 is running stable and at full speed in
Linux with SATA drives hat might be an optin, as SATA brings plenty of
disk space for a reasonable price).

Correct.  However, there is non-libata support for several SATA chipsets

long ways back in 2.4.x.)

Nvidia nforce3 is <em>also</em> not an SATA chipset, but rather a motherboard

awful Promise R20378 SATA <TT>/</TT> software-RAID chip.  The sound is indeed
provided by a really dreadful Realtek ALC650 chip.

There are driver tar packages from nvidia for download (at least partly

Best quality:  Adaptec 24x0, 3Ware Escalade -- in that order.  But you
won't find those built into motherboards.  Usually, what you find inside
motherboard chipsets is Intel ICH5.  Which is basically OK.

OK, I don't <em>have</em> sata drives but I read something about it. It seems (see
latest c't) that all the upcoming athlon 64 boards have sata (since it's in
their north|southbride) and quite a lot of them already have hardware raid0
and 1.

Yes -- the hardware is there -- but as far as I know none of the
hardware raids are supported in Linux, and booting Linux off SATA drives
which run actually as SATA and not in some IDE-emulation mode is
difficult. What I do not know if once a Lniux kernel takes over if they
are running as real SATA? Performance penalty for IDE emulation mode?
And the boards tested in latest c't all have two SATA connectors, i.e.
to few for raid5. Of course I could plug in 1 or 2 additional SCSI
disks on the PCI bus with them.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Alternatively I've already plenty of SCSI hardware in the old one, so I
would maybe even prefer a decent SCSI setup -- but I can't find a
chipset with onboard SCSI controllers -- and if I plug PCI cards I'm
again hogging the PCI bus.

Are there any other chipsets besides nforce2/3, i875,....?

Well -- right now I've some 32% CPU at full whopping 9MB/s (bonnie  8892
kB/s  31.8 %CPU) from the SCSI raid5 in a Pent. classic board running a
K6II-366MHz. Since I am hunting for new hardware I am thinking of
getting something decent which I (again) can keep for some time. The old
system is running since 1997 after all, with occasional low cost
upgrades(like the K6).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My original idea was: Ok upgrade is necessary, IDE is still not what I
want (performance trouble with my existing Lap and a DVD burner in the
desktop put me off; that cdrecord mess, ide-scsi or not, DMA only with
the right block size,...). So how about some new SCSI drives (3 for
raid5) and a nice new card (U160 one channel should do as I still have
a 2940UW for CD, scanner, etc.) and be done. Well-- the lowest
grade (new) SCSI drives I can locate are some 10k rpm 18 or 36GB drives
which sustain easily 30+MB/s and peak at 70 MB/s. A PCI bus is getting
very much the limiting factor as there are probably more cards in there
as well  and I'm looking for a way to avoid building a bottleneck into
the new thing right from the start. Thats why I tried to ask for info's
on boards/chipsets  which might have SCSI onboard, preferrably
circumventing the PCI bus.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But you are probably right, just ignore the bottleneck and let 100MB/s
be good enough. In a year the SATA support will be there and offers a
non-PCI extension anyway if needed.

The SATA 1.0 spec claims a 150MB/sec limit on bus transfers.  Of course,
the fastest ATA hard drive manufactured today can, under contrived,
artificially ideal conditions, read data at maybe 50 MB/sec, so
saturating ATA/100 or ATA/133 sounds very farfetched for a long time to
come.  (Remember, only one ATA device per bus can be active at any
specific time.  SATA changes this only by permitting <em>connection</em> of
only one ATA device on the chain.

2.  Using Linux software RAID (md driver) for redundancy, you typically
won't even notice the load relative to (say) a hugely expensive Mylex
SCSI hardware RAID adapter <em>except</em> during RAID volume rebuilds (if you
ever have to do that).  In such a case, expect the system to very, very
seriously bog down during the rebuild.  With the Mylex card, all of that
would be handled entirely within the array, with basically no system
loading.

we use a 400Mhz Celi for the (software) raid 5 and it works like a charm.
Sometimes my flat-mate and I both stream stuff from there and no clogging or
anything.
Regarding timeshift: if you use dvb you can easily capture the stuff since
it's already in mpeg2 format. No processor usage then. And any recent
platter should be able to both record and play mpeg2 streams simultaneously.
