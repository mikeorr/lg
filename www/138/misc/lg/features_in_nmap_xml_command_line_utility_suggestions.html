Hi all
I am working on a command-line utility to put nmap's XML output to
some great and frutiful use. Please suggest some features that could
be incorporated to make it Uber Cool.
</p>

<p>
Thanks

Why are you writing such a program, if you don't have any uses for it?
What is it about the current output of nmap that even needs to be
wrapped up in a rather large meta-markup subset?

<p>
I guess you are referring to nmap's XML output, the one generated by
-oX option?
