Hi Everyone,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have another problem and I was hoping that you will be able to help me
solve this one too. I am hosting my website on a <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> Sarge system on
a LVS (Linux Virtual Server) with 64 MB RAM and 64MB swap using <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>,
PHP and MySQL. The problem I have is that every so often the Apache and
MySQL process start taking 100% of the CPU and RAM and after a few mins
of which the system runs out of RAM and the kernel starts killing
processes (MySQL is usually the victim) which means my site goes down
till I restart that process.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there some way I can optimize MySQL and Apache and tell it not to use
so much RAM/CPU? I tried searching on the web but didn't find anything
relevant. I am running Apache2, PHP 5, MySQL 4.1.10 on this box.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Apache was compiled with:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>--enable-ssl --enable-cgi --with-ssl --enable-module=so
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
PHP With:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>--with-bz2 --enable-ftp --with-gd --enable-exif --with-jpeg-dir
--with-png-dir --with-ttf --with-freetype-dir
--with-imap=/usr/local/imap --with-mcrypt --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql/
--with-openssl --with-cpdflib --enable-soap --with-zlib
--with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
and MySQL with:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>--with-mysqld-user=mysqld --with-openssl
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
The website gets about a 1000 - 2000 hits a day and I have 2 blogs(Using
Serendipity Ver 0.8.1) running on this system. I also run Sendmail on
the box but is only used locally to send mails from Serendipity and my
guestbook. I don't allow any external connections to port 25.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The error I see in the <TT>/var/log/messages</TT> when a process is killed is:
</STRONG></P>

Any suggestions on how to reduce the load and prevent the system from
dying every few hours?

Well, there is.  If it is <em>  really  </em> a problem, you could compile your own
kernel, and not compiling the OOM-killer into it.  That would stop the
kernel's divine intervention, at any rate.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
More practical purposes though would be to limit the amount of RAM that
the processes can use.  Recent versions of PAM allow for this through
the file:  <TT>/etc/security/limits.conf</TT>  For example, on Debian, Apache
runs via the user 'www-data'.  In that file, you could add an entry
thus:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>www-data  soft     cpu       6000
www-data  hard     memlock   700000
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The difference between hard and soft is almost analogous to how quota
enforces them -- soft is a graceful enforce, while hard is a complete
cut-off.  The values above are examples only -- you should change them
to suit your needs, at any rate.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The use of limits.conf via PAM is really much more applicable to
daemon-based tools, although it can be applicable to anything.  It used
to be the case that you'd have to do:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>ulimit -l &lt;some_value&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
.. and you still can.  It's great to do that for login shells, etc.  The
problem with that is for daemon processes that do not spawn a shell when
the process starts, makes it invalid.  Not to mention the user that the
daemon runs at doesn't have a shell.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You can apply a similar methodology for MySQL.

Just an observation, stop being so miserly with your RAM.  64MB is very
little ram for a DB and a web server and your scripts,

Really?  I refute that, given the tools available to limit things.  I
have 64MB on a P166 which runs:  Exim, Squid, Apache, MySqL,
Ruby-on-Rails.  It has no problems whatsoever.  64MB is not miserly at
all -- and there's <em>  nothing  </em> to say one needs $MASSIVE_RAM for
applications to run -- if you believe that, you'll believe anything.

Really, interesting and you're right.  But this isn't an embedded system
we're talking about, it's a linux VLS, which is running on a real Linux
box, so he must have access to more resources causes he's already paying
the overhead of VLS and it's already thrashing the CPU so it's
stealing cycles from the rest of the system because it's thrashing.

Its an LVS being run by a hosting company. If I want to increase the
available RAM I have to pay extra and thats something I want to avoid
till I have exausted all other options. Its not that much more expensive
but why pay more when some small config changes will fix the problems,
right? :)

MySQL 4.1 is the latest greatest and it's a bit of pig,  usually eats up
16-32mb.  What are you running 3.23 ?  That's miserly in comparison.
Squid in non caching mode is pretty small agreed, but then it's only a
proxy.  Apache 1 or 2, Apache 2 takes up more room, just did a quick
check on my system and it's resident at Virtual 20MB, resident at 9MB.
What version of Linux 2.2 or 2.4 ?  2.4 is comfortable at low memory,
2.6 is less so.

What does your my.cnf look like, I think that would be useful for the
person who posted.

I just look at MySQL 4.0.20 and it's 30MB virtual and 10MB resident with
default settings, i.e. an empty my.cnf.

I am using the default settings for mysql, if you have a config setting
that is more lightweight then I am willing to try it out.

And I'm not talking $MASSIVE_RAM.  I'm talking 96MB.  By todays
standards that's nothing.  This is 2005, a barebones system is 1GHz with
256MB of RAM.  A P166 was state of the art 10 years ago, though I'm glad
to see you're recycling it.

:) I have spare machines at home but don't have the bandwidth to support
my site so I have to stick with this server until I can either convince
my boss to let me host my site on an office server or convince my wallet
to pay for a bandwidth upgrade at home.

increase your LVS
to 96MB and re-test.  The other thing to do is try and run the MySQL
database on another machine/virtual server over the network.

MySQL is <EM>NOT</EM> slow over the network, that's a complete myth.  It's not
as fast as running it over a Unix socket, but it's not slow by any
means, especially compared to the slow down of a P166
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) " 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  Try doing a
benchmark between your P166 running mysql and a faster machine over the
network running MySQL.  Any query of decent complexity will still run
faster on the network machine.  Plus if his VLS is crashing all the time
he'll spend more time running myisamchk on it than he would just moving
it to a stable box.

I was considering hosting the DB on my home machine but thats connected
to the net using a cable modem so I don't know how feasible that would
be. Will try out some tests and see how that looks.

The site wasn't doing too bad till 2 days ago then suddenly for some
reason the processes started dying every few hours. Maybe my traffic
shot up or the blog software went nuts.

He also stated he's running an app he didn't write, a blog.  So who
knows what's it's doing with memory or SQL queries.  Perhaps it has some
configuration knobs that can be used to minimize it's footprint.

Yeah, I think the blog is the biggest resource consumer. Anyone know a
more lightweight blog thats not horibly ugly looking?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have put in the changes Thomas suggested on the system and so far it
seems to be stable. I am waiting till tomorrow and see how it works out
overnight but so far that one change seems to be working great.

You can edit the <TT>/etc/my.cnf</TT> and cut it to the bone, but you're really
trading RAM for performance.  The less RAM, the lower your performance.
Go to mysql.com and look at the variables you can set and set them to
the bare minimum.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Also, configure apache to not load so many modules.  You can control
that from your httpd.conf.  But honestly, the amount of effort to get
this to work vs just adding more RAM or swap, I'd say it isn't worth it.

It's a 300k download, looks nice (subject to personal opinion) and isn't as
resource-hungry as serendipity. If you don't like the default look it has
extensive theming features and css support.
