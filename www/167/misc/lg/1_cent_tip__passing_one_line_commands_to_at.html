&gt; Don't worry, you don't need to use GUI automation tool such as dogtail
&gt; for doing so. Simply use gnome-power-cmd.sh command to do that. Note:
&gt; make sure atd daemon is running first. Then do:
&gt; $ at now + 10 minutes
&gt; at&gt; gnome-power-cmd.sh suspend
&gt; at&gt; (press Ctrl-D)
</pre>

This post reminded me that at(1) reads it's commands from stdin. Not that I 
had forgotten that fact, but that I usually avoid it. I rarely need to enter 
multi-line commands into at-scripts, and avoid having to cope with at's stdin 
by using the echo command.
</p>

<p>
For instance, I would have written the above at(1) invocation as
<pre>
  echo gnome-power-cmd.sh suspend | at now + 10 minutes
</pre>


<p>
Trivial, I know. That's why I called it a "1 cent tip" <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
