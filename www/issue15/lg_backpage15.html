Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. And, of course, thanks to Michael Montoure for all his
help with graphics and HTML checking.

<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./gx/bee3.gif">
This month has been a very busy one for me. I've been discovering just
how much more work there is to managing a print magazine, <I>Linux Journal</I>,
as opposed to
an electronic one. I'm afraid I've had much less time for <I>LG</I> than before.
If you've written and didn't get a response, this is the reason. It also
means that I'm too close to time to post <i>LG</i> and too little
of it is together -- maybe half as I write this message.
<P> 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="./gx/bee3.gif">
However, I have hired an Administrative Assistant, Amy Kukuk, to help
with <I>LJ</I> correspondence and article tracking. She's also going to
help me with <I>LG</I> by reading the news groups and writing the News
Bytes column. So with her good help, I expect the pace to slow
considerably.
<P> 
While <I>Linux Gazette</I> is free for all our readers, it is not free
for its publisher, SSC -- they do pay me for the time I spend putting
it together. In order to help pay for these costs, we've decided to
make <I>LG</I> the PBS of online ezines by having sponsors from the
Linux community. As I am
sure most of you noticed, the Front Page now has a Sponsor section.
We appreciate very much the financial contribution that InfoMagic, our
first sponsor, has made to help us defray our costs.
<P> 
Sorry to be late, I haven't been able to get to our web server since
last Wednesday (almost a whole week!).
<P> 
Have fun!
