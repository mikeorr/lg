<h1>Words, Words, Words</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</a></b></p>

<p>
Here's all you probably want to know about <em>Linux Gazette's</em>
copyediting staff &mdash; short version:  There are a few of us, we disagree
on many things, there are good and compelling reasons why we'll 
never agree, our job is to make your articles as good as possible while
doing no harm, and we not only don't mind authors who disagree with our
policies but think it's healthy and natural.  
</p>

<p>
The rest of this article details tidbits about our editing that yr.
humble author, <em>LG's</em> Proofreading Coordinator, thinks he can
make interesting.  (Contentious points will get stressed,
disproportionately: They're more interesting.  Also, be warned that
you're not guaranteed to hear anyone's opinion but the author's, but,
hey, it's my article.)  Note:  Please don't think this article aims to
change how you write.  Our mamas having raised no fools, we don't expect
that:  This piece just describes how we<a id="nonstyleguide.html_1_back"></a><a href="#nonstyleguide.html_1">[1]</a>
edit.  
</p>

<h3>
Where You Can Stuff Your Chicago Manual of Style
</h3>

<p>
There are good reasons why <em>Linux Gazette</em> neither follows your
favourite house-style writing manual nor has one of its own.  Mainly, it's
because we're (1) international, and (2) not anyone's employer.  Because
we accept pieces from, and publish to, the entire planet, good Australian,
Indian, Irish, Zambian, Fijian, Canadian, and Kiribatian English need
to be respected as much as, say, UK and US English are. Because we don't
fund anyone's daily bread, we wouldn't dream of imposing top-down
rulesets like the <em>Chicago Manual of Style's</em> absurdities about
"open style" reversing everything else in that book. We wouldn't put up
with that sort of arbitrary regimentation for zero money; why would you?
</p>

<p>
We've read your <em>AP Stylebook</em>, <em>New York Times Manual of
Style and Usage</em>, <em>Fowler's</em>, <em>Cambridge Guide</em>, 
<em>Follett's</em>, and <em>Garner's</em>, and think their foibles are
pretty funny (but that the <em>Merriam-Webster</em> guide's free of 
such inadvertent comedy) &mdash; but, more important, that they're 
a poor tool for our mission: That mission is simply to help you
express yourself well and clearly, in your own way of speaking, by
making minimal tweaks to your articles so that, with luck, you're 
pleased with how well you wrote but can't even tell we touched anything.  
</p>

<h3>
The Gazette Is People
</h3>

<p>
It might be nice if we could say what copyediting will and will not
occur, but that's not how the world works.  In the real world, policy 
doesn't get work done; people do.  If the final staffer to touch
your article prior to publication abhors the word "utilize", he/she
will change it to "use" (and who can blame such a staffer, right?).
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, the staff are in cheerful ongoing disagreement on many
key points.  E.g., most of the staff think "website" is a perfectly fine
English word, but the Proofreading Coordinator doesn't, and cares more, so he 
corrects it to "Web site", every time.  That's just the way it works:
Those who put in time and effort get to have their way (but try to use 
that power, such as it is, wisely, and to improve, never to annoy).
</p>

<p>
This article, in fact, basically tells you what corrections are likely
to be done to correct articles by people, notably the Proofreading
Coordinator, in the absence of a house style &mdash; but also
acknowledging the truth that outcome depends on who does the work, because
of the staff's disagreement on significant points.  
</p>

<h3>
The Argument Clinic's That-a-Way
</h3>

<p>
Feel very welcome to tell us why our editing is horribly evil and a sign
of the impending Apocalypse (not to mention that an English teacher once 
mugged you and stole your lunch):  We don't mind, but don't promise to 
take your objection seriously, especially if it's one of the Obnoxious Three: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>"But Chaucer did it."  Poor Geoffrey Chaucer, here, is a placeholder
for any and all historical writers:  The argument in question is that 
[historical writer X] wrote in some questionable way (using "gender" for 
a biological category, mixing "which" and "that", singular "they", 
"quote" as a noun, confusing "imply" with "infer", confusing "nauseous"
with "nauseated"), so it's OK for you, too.</li>
<li>"The English language should be allowed to change."  This is a non-sequitur,
irrelevant point.  Just because LASER became a common noun in ten years
doesn't mean <em>your</em> bizarre neologism is automatically OK.</li>
<li>"[Person X] disagrees with you."  Noted, and so what?  We won't take the 
Appeal to Authority fallacy seriously, nor are we running a popularity
contest or putting our editing practices up for modification by public poll.
Sorry, it just doesn't work that way.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We won't be offended if you send in junk arguments &mdash; on the contrary,
at least it shows you care about writing (and what would the Internet
do without opinions?) &mdash; but you might want to avoid wasting your time.
</p>


<h3>
Flamewar Issues Cannot Be Avoided, So We Just Deal with Them
</h3>

<p>
There's a good reason we don't aim at perfect, pure English:
It doesn't exist and never has, having after all resulted from an
unfortunate collision between mediaeval Norman French and lowland German
(loosely speaking).  Many structures in English remain badly broken, and
the ability to speak precisely in it is only thanks to tireless efforts
by many countries to bridge or rope off its crevasses.  Thus the old
joke about a rancher trying to deal with his snake problem: "Dear sirs,
I'd like to order two mongooses."  (He frowns, crosses that out.)
"Dear sirs, I'd like to order two mongeese."  (Frowns, crosses out, tries 
again.)  "Dear sirs, I'd like to order a mongoose.  While you're at it,
please send a second one."
</p>

<p>
Among the numerous eternal and inescapable flamewars about English
revolves around its lack of a generally usable, non-peculiar
third-person singular pronoun that isn't gendered.  Yes, we know this is
a big problem (and part of an even bigger one whereby the language
encourages sexist bias), can quote Douglas Hofstadter's "Person Paper on
Purity in Language" fluently, and (I think I can speak for the staff,
here) agree wholeheartedly with him.  The fact remains, and the fact is
that using "they" (as is often done, these days) to fill the gap tends
to destroy that word's ability to clearly distinguish between singular and
plural.  Most on the staff think this damage is perfectly OK; the
Proofreading Coordinator politely and firmly disagrees (and, e.g., 
doesn't care whether Chaucer used it).  So, don't be surprised if your 
singular "they" becomes "he or she" (one of many imperfect solutions, 
but one that is at least grammatical).  
</p>

<p>
Our copyeditors' most important principle, in that and other areas, is
rather like that of medical schools' maxim of "Primum non nocere"
("First, do no harm").  I call our version Rule Zero:  "Ignore any rule,
rather than doing anything peculiar that will tend to call attention to
itself."
</p>

<p>
Another inescapable flamewar is correction (or not) of quoted text.  The
stilted alleged quotations festooned around many "News Bytes" columns
are a case in point: 
</p>

<blockquote>
"Launchpad accelerates collaboration between open source projects," said
Canonical founder and CEO Mark Shuttleworth. "Collaboration is the
engine of innovation in free software development, and Launchpad
supports one of the key strengths of free software compared with the
traditional proprietary development process. Projects that are hosted on
Launchpad are immediately connected to every other project hosted there
in a way that makes it easy to collaborate on code, translations, bug
fixes, and feature design across project boundaries. Rather than hosting
individual projects, we host a massive and connected community that
collaborates together across many projects. Making Launchpad itself open
source gives users the ability to improve the service they use every
day."
</blockquote>

<p>We of the editorial staff would be thunderstruck, and also dismayed,
if Mark Shuttleworth had <em>actually</em> uttered that mouthful of stilted 
marketing bafflegab (quoted in issue 166).  He seems like a pleasant and
intelligent fellow, so the smart money's on that prose emerging from
someone in Canonical, Ltd.'s corporate PR department (or hired PR agency),
working from a generic press release template.  More to the immediate
point, you should have seen how dreadful these press releases were
before we fixed them.  But, you ask, "How dare you fix a direct quotation?
Isn't it presumptuous to change what someone said?" 
</p>

<p>
You have part of the answer already:  In corporate PR, what you say is
often not what <em>you</em> say.  Accordingly, we have few qualms about
fixing some marketing ghostwriter's bad grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
As to the rest, if a quoted person ever complains "Hey, <em>Linux
Gazette</em> presumed to make me sound literate.  The bastards!" we
will be looking forward to the novelty and to apologising winningly if
insincerely.
</p>

<h3> 
A Few Guidelines Peculiar to the Magazine, Itself
</h3>

<ul>

<li><p><em>Square brackets:  Not yours.</em>  Sorry, but <em>Linux
Gazette</em> generally reserves square brackets for visually indicating 
comments inserted into (or, better yet, at the bottom of) someone else's 
article by the editors themselves.  If we end up speaking rubbish, we 
don't want you to take the blame.  So, you as an author may not use
square brackets (with obvious exceptions such as code where syntax
requires it); it would be confusing.  If you try, we'll change them to
parentheses every single time.  (I'm talking to you, Howard.)</p></li>

<li><p><em>Legal clutter need not apply.</em>  Yes, you want
everyone to put an R-in-circle after your company name Yoyodyne, to
render obeisance to your trademark.  We know.  We don't care.  "TM",
"R", and all of that stuff gets stripped out.  We actually have bothered
to learn the law, and know that we have no obligation to replicate your
marking of your corporate territory, only to avoid infringing your
property rights, which is not the same thing.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Weird lettercase will be ironed out.</em>  Over the
years, corporate branding has asked people to do some extremely peculiar
things with lettercasing of company and product names.  We tend to
politely say "no".  You can write "nVIDIA" or "NVIDIA" all you want,
but in our magazine it's Nvidia &mdash; and "CorelDRAW!" is Right Out.</p>

<p>There are debatable cases; the world isn't perfect.  Novell's
preferred lettercase is "openSUSE", which is only slightly peculiar:
We'd probably change it to "OpenSUSE" because it's a proper noun, 
but maybe not.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Physical styling HTML tags ("i", "bold", "underscore",
"strike") are almost always inappropriate</em> and will be removed. 
Appropriate logical styling will be used where appropriate 
("em", "strong"...).</p></li>

<li><p><em>Strong-text ("strong") HTML tags are viewed skeptically</em>, 
often being typographical excess, and may in those cases be 
amputated.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Tuck punctuation inside a quotation only if it's part of the
quotation.</em>  Generations of editors have imposed the "'Zounds,' Tom
expostulated" convention on authors; we do not, because of the risk of 
ambiguity it creates in technical English.  Consider a sentence 
ending with a reference to "string."  The contents of that text string
might be "string" or might be "string."; it's impossible to tell.</p>

<li><p><em>Consistency, lack of:</em>  Spelling from either side of the 
Atlantic, sneakers vs. trainers, program vs. programme, parka vs.
anorak, quarter note vs. crochet is fine by us.  All we ask is that you
pick <em>one</em>.  If you piece wanders between two otherwise
acceptable usage, spelling, or punctuation patterns concerning the same
thing, one of them is by definition wrong and will be fixed.  We get to
pick which one.</p>

</ul>


<h3>These Are a Few of Our Favourite Peeves</h3>

<p>Here's a grab-bag of the most-encountered blunders (that we imagine
might be interesting):
</p>

<p><em>"spell check":</em>  Unless you mean something that checks
spells (and J.K. Rowling will be jealous, if you do), you should write 
"spelling check".</p>

<p><em>"vice president":</em>  This term is correct if you're referring
to a president in charge of vice (an enviable career option), but not
otherwise.  More than likely, the intended term is "vice-president".</p>

<p><em>"web":</em>  Wrong.  It's a proper noun, "Web" (unless you're
talking about spider extrusions or analogous woven structural meshes, or
a type of offset printing machine).  Note that "webmaster", "weblog",
"webcam", etc. are not proper nouns, so they're lowercase.</p>

<p><em>"website":</em>  Wrong.  It's two words, "Web site".  (But why,
we hear people asking, is "website" an impermissible coinage if
"webmaster", "weblog", and "webcam" aren't?  Because new words were
needed for those concepts.  We already had "Web site"; it works just
fine.  Don't tell us it's too exhausting to include the space character
and lean on your shift key:  We won't buy that.)</p>

<p><em>(lack of) serial comma:</em>  The "a, b, and c" pattern is
preferred over "a, b and c" by many of our editors.  It improves
clarity, and avoids the accidental perception of b and c being a grouped
pair or otherwise having more in common with each other than they do
with a.</p>

<p>In case you doubt this, consider the classic example of a sentence
that really, <em>really</em> needs the serial comma (quoted by Teresa
Nielsen Hayden from a probably apocryphal book dedication):  "I'd like
to thank my parents, Ayn Rand and God."</p>

<p><em>"Free Software":</em>  Sorry, no.  It's just not a proper noun
(except when used as part of an actual name such as Free Software
Foundation or Free Software Definition), so the correct usage is "free
software" as a noun, and "free-software" as a (compound) adjective.</p>

<p>Sure, we know some folks try to draw a distinction between "Free
software" (meaning free as in freedom) and "free software" (meaning free
as in cost).  However, that doesn't work, sorry.  Your readers still
won't get it.</p>

<p><em>"Open Source":</em>  Sorry, no.  It's just not a proper noun
(except when used as part of an actual name, such as Open Source
Initiative or Open Source Definition), so the correct usage is "open
source" as a noun and "open-source" as a (compound) adjective.</p>

<p><em>"email" vs. "e-mail":</em>  The Proofreading Coordinator prefers
the spelling "e-mail" over "email", even though many others on our staff
consistently feel otherwise:  The rationale for the hyphen is that
"email" is too easy to misparse as a one-syllable word, and also is in
fact identical to a somewhat obscure synonym for "enameled" (taken from
the French word for that concept).  This is probably a lost cause, but
don't be surprised if the word does get hyphenated in your article.</p>

<p><em>Apostrophes on plurals of acronyms (and initialisms):</em>  Don't.
It should be 1950s rather than 1950's, 100s rather than 100's, and
BASICs rather than BASIC's (for the plural forms).  Think of it this
way:  That apostrophe serves no purpose and creates confusion with the
possessive case, so Rule Zero dictates leaving it out.  (If you don't,
we will.)</p>

<p><em>Speaking of possessives:</em>  The possessive of "emacs" (a
singular noun) is "emacs's", not "emacs'".  Similarly, the possessive of
"Xandros" (a singular noun) is "Xandros's", not "Xandros'".  Get it?</p>

<p>We could go on.  We shouldn't.  And we know all of the above
will keep on needing correction.  That's OK, really.</p>


<h3>Don't Take It Too Seriously</h3>

<p>The English language is a train-wreck.  Don't sweat it.  We just aim
for it to be a well-swept, orderly train-wreck &mdash; solely so that
<em>your</em> work as authors gets displayed as well as we can
manage.</p>

<p>There's an old joke among copy-editors:  "Q:  Should the phrase
'anal-retentive' be hyphenated?  A:  Always when it's used as a compound
adjective. Never when it's a compound noun."  If you found that amusing,
you might just be one of us.</p>

are covered by the middle fork of Mark Twain's dictum that the "editorial
we" is permitted only to kings, editors, and people with the tapeworm.

<hr>

<p class="editorial">
[ "The Devil", as someone once noted, "is in the details." The general
thrust of this article is indeed spot-on; there's much disagreement on
editing technique, but it's not a problem, since the edits are serially
applied. The individual editors and proofers styles, though, can vary quite
a lot: e.g., while Rick's focus may be on good grammar, mine is more
about clarity and readability of the entire piece.  He prefers a light touch,
while I don't hesitate to hack'n'slash mercilessly in the service of making
an article as comprehensible as possible (and, much like him, I'm still yet
to hear from an outraged author whose work I've "damaged" with this
treatment.) We do our best to leave the style of the writing alone, though;
the author's voice is is indeed an important and valuable part of the
whole, and deserves to be heard.
</p>

<p class="editorial">The important point here - the really important
point - is that this is how true cooperation works. Rick and I are not
competing with each other, nor are we competing against the other editors
or proofreaders; we are all fellow contributors, with each adding their
effort into the common pot. The end result, the work that we produce,
benefits not only from our combined effort, but from the synergy that
results from intentional cooperative efforts of a group. This, folks, is
Open Source in action. -- Ben ]

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/cabal/os-suck.html">sucked less</a>, he blew
away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and
support.  He helped plan the LINC Expo (which evolved into the first
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access
to a card-walloping IBM mainframe at Stanford (1969).  A glutton for
punishment, he then moved on (during high school, 1970s) to early HP
timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer
sessions, and so on.  He's thus better qualified than most, to know just
how much better off we are now.

<P> When not playing Silicon Valley dot-com roulette, he enjoys
long-distance bicycling, helping run science fiction conventions, and
concentrating on becoming an uncarved block.
