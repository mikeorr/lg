<P> FIRST, I MUST SOLICIT YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS TRANSACTION...  YOU HAVE
BEEN RECOMMENDED BY AN ASSOCIATE WHO ASSURED ME IN CONFIDENCE OF YOUR ABILITY
AND RELIABILITY TO PROSECUTE A TRANSACTION OF GREAT MAGNITUDE INVOLVING A
PENDING BUSINESS TRANSACTION REQUIRING MAXIMUM CONFIDENCE.

<P> WE ARE TOP OFFICIALS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACT REVIEW PANEL WHO
ARE INTERESTED IN IMPORTATION OF GOODS INTO OUR COUNTRY WITH FUNDS WHICH ARE
PRESENTLY TRAPPED IN [West African country].  

<P> THE SOURCE OF THIS FUND IS AS FOLLOWS : DURING THE  REGIME OF OUR LATE HEAD
OF STATE, [name], THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS SET UP COMPANIES AND AWARDED
THEMSELVES CONTRACTS WHICH WERE GROSSLY OVER-INVOICED IN VARIOUS MINISTRIES...
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A LOT OF INFLATED CONTRACT FUNDS WHICH ARE 
PRESENTLY FLOATING IN THE CENTRAL BANK OF [that country].

<P> HOWEVER, DUE TO OUR POSITION AS CIVIL SERVANTS AND MEMBERS OF THIS PANEL,
WE CANNOT ACQUIRE THIS MONEY IN OUR NAMES. I HAVE THEREFORE, BEEN DELEGATED AS
A MATTER OF TRUST BY MY COLLEAGUES OF THE PANEL TO LOOK FOR AN OVERSEAS PARTNER
INTO WHOSE ACCOUNT THE SUM OF US$25,000,000.00 (TWENTY  FIVE MILLION UNITED
STATES DOLLARS) WILL BE PAID BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. HENCE WE ARE WRITING YOU
THIS LETTER. 
   
<P> WE HAVE AGREED TO SHARE THE MONEY THUS:<BR>
1.  70% FOR US (THE OFFICIALS)<BR>
2.  20% FOR THE FOREIGN PARTNER (YOU)<BR>
3.  20% TO BE USED IN SETTLING TAXATION AND ALL LOCAL AND FOREIGN EXPENSES. 
   
<P> IT IS FROM THIS 70% THAT WE WISH TO COMMENCE THE IMPORTATION BUSINESS. 

<P> PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% SAFE AND WE HOPE THAT THE FUNDS 
CAN ARRIVE YOUR ACCOUNT IN LATEST TEN (10) BANKING DAYS FROM THE DATE OF 
RECIEPT OF THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION . A SUITABLE NAME AND BANK ACCOUNT 
INTO WHICH THE FUNDS CAN BE PAID. 

<P> THE ABOVE INFORMATION WILL ENABLE US WRITE LETTERS OF CLAIM AND JOB
DESCRIPTION RESPECTIVELY. THIS WAY WE WILL USE YOUR COMPANY'S NAME TO APPLY FOR
PAYMENTS AND RE-AWARD THE CONTRACT IN YOUR COMPANY NAME.

	[Now let me get this straight.  You expect the total taxes and fees
to add up to only 20%?  But the US government will want 50% or more in taxes;
where will the other 30% come from?  
And 70 + 20 + 20 adds up to 110%, not 100%.
Where will <EM>that</EM> money come from?  And I'm supposed to put my 
business' reputation on the line for you?  What do you want to import anyway,
drugs?  And finally, whose money is this anyway?  If it was government 
overpayment then the money belongs to the taxpayers of your country and should
be returned to them.  It's not there for you skim the pork off your civil
service job and get rich on the backs of your countrymen.]

Microsoft Windows?  Your office staff will love the familiar user
