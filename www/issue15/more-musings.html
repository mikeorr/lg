Scanner Report

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In December my brother called me to let me know he had a possible Christmas
gift for me:  a Compaq Keyboard Scanner.  He works for Compaq and they had
a special for employees.  Knowing I might not have a Linux driver for this he
called to ask.  I didn't know, so I started to investigate.  I checked the
one place I knew I could ask questions like this and get reasonably accurate
answers - the Gimp Developer and User mailing lists.  I posted a message
asking if anyone knew about scanners and this scanner in particular.
Quite a few people answered.  It turns out this particular scanner is
actually an OEM'd version of the Visioneer keyboard scanner.  The protocol
this scanner uses in not publicly available and apparently its rather
difficult to get on the developers list to get the information.  So much
for getting support for this little device.
However, the amount of information I gathered about other scanner devices,
about 14 pages of printed material, turned out to be a real windfall.
I decided to summarize it here in the Muse.
<P>
First, lets list the set of scanners known to have support.  This list is a
compilation based on what the drivers say they support and what individuals
have said they are specifically using.

The HP scanners appear to all require a generic SCSI interface, such as an
Adaptec AHA 152x board and its associated driver, and the hpscanpbm user
level driver.  The SCSI board that comes with some (or possibly all, I'm
not sure) of the HP scanners is not supported at this time.

<BR clear=both>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Knowing which scanners are supported is one thing.  Now you need to find a
driver that goes with them.  The information I got was provided by the
son of a coworker of my brother.  Apparently he had some free time and had
gone out and gathered this list on his own.  
Not all the information was complete and I filled in the rest by perusing
the sunsite and tsx-11 archives.  I also received information on some of
the drivers from the developers.

I don't know what the difference between the pbmscan and logiscan packages is
but suspect the pbmscan package is a front end to the logiscan package.
The logiscan package has a front end called gifscan that uses SVGALIB 
(not an X interface) and saves the input into GIF files.  The pbmscan
package scans directly into PBM formatted files.

Commercial Scanner Products

<BR clear=both>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
There is only one commercially available product for scanners - XVScan
from <A HREF="http://www.tummy.com/">Tummy.com</A>,
which contains a graphical front end and supports a number of scanners.
XVScan runs for about $50US which includes the $30 registration for XV.
<UL>
	<LH>Supported Devices (that I know of, there may be others)</LH>
	<LI>IIp 
	<LI>IIc 
	<LI>IIcx
	<LI>3c (reported to work) Note: According to the HP ScanJet 4c web page
			the 3c and 4c 10-bit and 30-bit scanning modes are INTERNAL only. 
			This combined with X and XVs inability to handle other than
			8-bit and 24-bit images means that you can't scan or display a
			10/30-bit image. 
	<LI>4c (seems to be the same scanner as the 3c) 
	<LI>HP ScanJet Plus
	<LI>HP ScanJet 4P (reported by a user, Tummy.com doesn't list it)

<A HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/sane/">
SANE v0.42</A> - http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/sane/ -
is a project to create a Universal Scanner Interface.  SANE, which stands
for Scanner Access Now Easy, supports the following backends (device
drivers):
<UL>
	<LH>Supported Devices</LH>
	<LI>Mustek flatbed scanners using a generic SCSI interface
	<LI>PBM-Pseudo-Driver (demo implementation)
	<LI>DL-Meta-Backend for multiple-scanner support
	<LI>A Network based backend to support scanners across a network
	<LI>Connectix Color QuickCam
</UL>
<UL>
	<LH>Work in Progress or Planned</LH>
	<LI>UMAX scanners
	<LI>Linux Handscanner ioctl interface bridge 
	<LI>HP scanner support (might be a port from xvscan) 
	<LI>MicroTek (aka mTek) scanners
</UL>
There are a couple of front ends to this tool as well:
<UL>
	<LI>xcam - a front end to the Color QuickCam driver
	<LI>a Gimp plug-in front end, which can also be compiled as a
		standalone GTK application (GTK is the X Toolkit used by
		the upcoming version of the Gimp)
	<LI>a command line interface
</UL>
<P>
This package makes use of the GNU Configure mechanism.  Unfortunately it
doesn't quite build right out of the box (there are some linking options
which aren't supported by the Linux ld program).
I couldn't test the programs or drivers out, unfortunately
since I don't have a QuickCam or any scanners yet.
Feel free to donate either, of course.
<P>
There are notes in the distribution about ongoing work for support for
non-Unix platforms, but I have little interest in that so didn't really
read through it.

What people are saying

<BR clear=both>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
And of course, what would a scanner review be without some user
testimonials.  These are taken from the discussions on scanners in the Gimp
User and Gimp Developer mailing lists.  I didn't keep track of email
addresses so all I have are the first names of the respondents.  As with
any unverifiable testimonials, take these with a grain of salt.

	I've been using XVScan with my
	ScanJet 4P and Linux for about 9 months, and I'm very happy with it.
	It worked perfectly out of the box, no tweaking or anything.
	XVScan costs $50, but that includes the $30 registration fee for XV
	and is produced by Tummy.com.  Their web site is, of course,

	I'm using an HP Scanjet IIC (predecessor to the CX) with Linux and Gimp,
	and am very pleased with the results.  I've a feeling (unsubstantiated),
	that not much changed between the two models other than the driver
	software that HP shipped with each.
	There's a good HP scanner driver for Linux called 'hpscanpbm' - available
	from the usual sources.  It's command-line driven, but offers very good
	control over resolution, brightness, contrast etc.  Output format is pbm
	only, unfortunately. So far, it's the only HP driver for Linux that I've
	seen.

	I'm using a Mustek Paragon 600II-SP, and it works quite well (just don't

	I'm using a HP Scanjet IIcx, with the Adaptec AHA152x driver and 
	the "generic" SCSI
	interface. No changes to the driver were necessary. Currently using the
	hpscanpbm program to do all scanning.

	I'm using an HP IICX with hpscanpbm.  Installation was completely
	painless.  I added it to my scsi bus, rebooted and once I figured out
	which generic scsi device it was and set the permissions appropriately
	it worked.  Probably 10-15 minutes, including compiling hpscanpbm.

	I have a Microtek ScanMaker E3, which is a 24-bit flatbed scanner with a
	300x600dpi optical resolution, that can be had for right around $300. It
	comes with some pretty decent image editing software for the Mac and for
	Windows, and there's a (command-line-driven) driver available for Linux
	(mtekscan). With any luck, the SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) project will
	have a driver available in the not-too-distant future (if I ever find time
	to write the driver, that is. :) The SANE driver will allow standalone
	scanning as well as a GIMP plug-in. The driver will probably work with
	other Microtek scanners as well (mtekscan was actually written for a
	ScanMaker E6 but works with my E3). - name unknown

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	As for Musteks, I was considering a 30-bit, 400x800dpi Mustek scanner (I
	don't remember the model), until I read a review which compared that
	scanner to a few other scanners (mostly 24-bit). The Mustek wasn't
	particularly impressive; I finally decided to go with the Microtek--even
	though inferior "on paper" it still received a much better review.
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	In any case, you can't go wrong with a Microtek, I think. I've also read
	good things about the UMAX (which are also rather inexpensive), a Canon (a
	little more expensive), and of course HP scanners are generally top-notch,
	although they also command premium prices. If you have the bucks, go for
	an HP, but if you want to save a few dollars and still get an excellent
	quality product, there are other options. - name unknown

Other OS's
</B>
<BR clear=both>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
A few people responded to my request for information on the Gimp mailing
lists with information for non-Linux systems.  I normally don't write about
these, but I'll go ahead this one time.  Note that I don't want to write
about other OS's - not because they aren't any good, but because Linux
works for me and I don't have the time to wander around the OS world
looking for yet another OS.
<UL>
	<LI>FreeBSD - apparenatly has a port called <I>hpscan</I> that
			needs a link to /dev/scanner from the device the scanner
			uses.  <I>hpscan</I> saves images in JPEG format.
</UL>

<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thats it.  Hopefully this information will help you get started looking for
a scanner and the appropriate software to use with it.  I have high
expectations for the SANE project to be the primary interface for low-level
and user-level drivers for all scanners in the future.  Once a generic
interface is defined it should be easier to develop applications that can
make real use of the scanners.
