<p>
Is there a way to switch the VT of a linux box remotely?
</p>

<p>
Specifically, I have X running on my desktop, and have trained my wife 
to click the KDE "switch user" to log in herself (and get her email), 
which allocates another VT for her.
</p>

<p>
This works really well -- I can leave myself logged in on VT7, and she 
can use VT8.  Unfortunately, she doesn't know how to switch it back to 
VT7 when she's done (Ctrl-Alt-F7).
</p>

<p>
I have a VNC server installed as an X module, that allows me to remotely 
VNC to my X session (on VT7), but due to X quirks, I can only VNC to it 
if VT7 is "selected" -- ie, if she's left the machine sitting on VT8, I 
can't VNC in.
</p>

<p>
So, I would like to know if there is a way for me to switch which VT is 
"selected" remotely (ie, SSH in, su to root, and do something to switch 
VTs).
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance! ;-)

Thanks!

OK, now I feel pretty stupid -- somehow I managed to miss the (in 
retrospect) obvious, after using apropos, esearch, and Google...

You should be able to handle that via the 'chvt' command executed via
SSH. Something like
</p>

<pre>
ssh your_wifes_username@host 'chvt 7'
</pre>
should do it.

&gt; Thanks!  Yours is the second response that said the same thing...
&gt; 
&gt; And I now feel very stupid for the amount of Google searches, etc that I 
&gt; did and still managed to miss this very obvious command... ;-)

Dave, don't let it throw you; there are more Unix commands out there
than are dreamt of in <strong>anyone's</strong> philosophy.

Just recently, while teaching an introductory Unix class in Milwaukee,
I saw a short presentation done by one of the client's sysadmins; in it,
he discussed using the 'groups' command to show which groups your
current UID belongs to. [shrug] As obvious a command as it is - and as
obvious of a function as it serves - I had never heard of it before (I
always just used 'id', myself.)
