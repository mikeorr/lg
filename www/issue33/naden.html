	<H2><A name="intro"></A><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">INTRODUCTION</FONT></H2>
	
	<HR>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">I am a Mechanical Engineer and an owner 	of a small business, <A href="mailto:ldtech@istar.ca">L&amp;D Technologies</A>, specializing in mechanical design and drafting and project management of small to medium size projects in mechanical engineering field. As any small business owner knows, the cost of start-up can be quite high, especially in the field where high end workstation and 3-D software are very important. I knew that I couldn't afford the <A href="http://www.sgi.com/">SGI(TM)</A> or <A href="http://www.sun.com/">UltraSPARC2(TM)</A> machine (even though that would have been perfect), so my options were down to which operating system I would be running my PC under.</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">I had two options:</FONT></P>
	
		<UL>
		
		<LI><A href="http://www.microsoft.com/">WindowsNT(TM)</A>- which I use at my other, daytime job, and thus already have a very good understanding of the CAD software available on this platform ( <A href="http://www.cadkey.com/">CADKEY(TM)</A> and <A href="http://www.ptc.com/">Pro/E(TM)</A>)
				
		<LI><A href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian/GNU Linux OS</A>- which I use on my home computer
				
		</UL>
		
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Doing the preliminary cost estimate comparison between these two options, I quickly ruled out Windows(TM)-based system.</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">And so my search began for a production
 quality mechanical CAD system that would run under Linux, and be reasonably priced.</FONT></P>
	
	<HR>
	
	<H2><A name="search"></A><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">SEARCH</FONT></H2>

	<HR>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">I have used Linux for three years, and all
				that time the available applications and their quality have
				constantly been improving. I have felt that the only field where
				Linux was thin in available applications was mechanical
				engineering. True, there have been some CAD apps out there, but
				they either required too much programming (very powerfull <A href="http://www.microform.se/">VARKON</A>,
				for example) or were too simplistic for production drafting
				(otherwise very good xfig/transfig combo). I have also looked
				into <A href="http://www.bentley.com/academic">Bentley's Microstation (TM)</A>( 
				for Linux, but they only offered educational licences at the time
				( a move I will <U>never</U> understand: who would get an
				educational licence for a piece of software they can not continue
				using after graduation- at least not under the same OS-?). Just
				for the record, I think the Microstation(TM) could blow away
				anything offered for Linux in this field, if they had some
				management vision and interest in developing for Linux community.
				One other site is worth mentioning, if for nothing else but for
				more exposure of this project to other Linux users- <A href="http://pw2.netcom.com/~iamcliff/FREEdraft.html">FREEDraft project</A>. It is an attempt
				to bring to life a GNU drafting package, and I wish those people
				the best of luck in future development.</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Then I have noticed two new entries in the
				software arena, LinuxCAD and VariCAD. I have almost purchased
				LinuxCAD (at $75, it seemed like a great deal), but didn't like
				the fact they had no demo available, and their E-mail reply to my
				preliminary inquiry had amounted to a little more than
				self-promoting junk mail. Only a couple of days later there was a
				usenet discussion about LinuxCAD and result was a <A href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue30/wuest.html">page posted here</A>, which comletely turned me away from LinuxCAD. I went to <A href="http://atlanta.varicad.com/">VariCAD's USA site</A> instead, and quickly found out there is a working demo (without Save features) available for a download.</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">If you are interested in doing a search for
				available apps for Linux on your own, I recommend following sites
				as a good starting point:</FONT></P>
				
		<UL>
		
		<LI><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">very good for scientific applications:<A href="http://SAL.KachinaTech.COM/"> Kachina Technologies site</A></FONT> 
		
		<LI><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">for general linux application: <A href="http://tsikora.tiac.net/linapps">linux applications mirror site</A></FONT> 
				
		</UL>
	
	<HR>
	
	<H2><A name="varicad"></A><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">VariCAD FOR LINUX</FONT></H2>

	<HR>
	
	<H3><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Obtaining And Installing The Software</FONT></H3>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Download
				consisted of getting four tarred files, and amounted to about
				5Mb, which is very reasonable for a CAD system, along with the
				installation script. Available for the download is also RPM
				package, which must be downloaded as a roughly 5Mb single file,
				and it represents a nice touch for people running <A href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> distribution of Linux.</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Installation instructions, for people who
				choose to get the plain tarred files, are very simple and clearly
				stated at the download site. I have simply followed those
				instructions, and it worked like a charm with version 6.1. As of
				a Aug. 29 1998, they have released new version, 6.2-0.3, and in
				my experience, there is a small glitch in installation script
				inst.sh which requires one to log in as root for it to work. On
				my system trying to execute the inst.sh script under su did not
				work; only 'true' root login managed to install the program.
				Also, the tarred files had been deleted in the installation
				process, so if you want to have a backup on the floppies, be sure
				to copy tarred files someplace else first, before executing the
				inst.sh script. This didn't happen with the version 6.1, though.
				On the other hand, new version (6.2-0.3) seems to be more robust,
				and it adds a drop-down menu for Internet access, which I haven't
				tested yet.</FONT></P>
				
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Since I'm running the Debian distribution, I
				would have liked to see the option in the installation process
				for choosing the target directory, and would have rather placed
				the VariCAD under /usr/local tree than under the default /usr
				tree. On the other hand, after installation script had completed,
				executing varicad command for the very first time in the rxvt
				resulted in a flawless start. I'm running the <A href="http://www.xfree86.org/">Xfree86</A> windowing system, with xserver-mach64 running in the 1152x864
				resolution and 32 bpp, and VariCAD didn't seem to have a problem
				with those settings. After I have been playing with the software
				for a week, I decided it was worth the price they are asking for
				it and, after I have mailed in the cheque, received a small file
				in an E-mail which enables the save feature. As per instructions
				in the E-mail I copied the file to the /usr/lib/Varicad tree and
				at the next start of the program, the pop-up message about demo
				nature of the program went away, and I could happily save files
				and settings</FONT></P>
				
	<H3><FONT face="">Using The VariCAD</FONT></H3>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Before going any further, I would like to say that my exposure to <A href="http://www.autodesk.com/">AutoCAD (TM)</A> has been limited to version 10, way, way back, and if
				you are expecting the direct comparison between Mechanical
				Desktop (TM) and VariCAD, I'm afraid you will be dissappointed.
				If you are using AutoCAD and have given VariCAD a try, please <A href="mailto:ldtech@istar.ca">E-mail me</A> your short review in an
				HTML format, and I'll post it here or send me an URL pointer to
				your page.</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Because VariCAD does not use the Motif
				libraries, the executable is rather small and efficient. Fired up
				and having a rather simple 2-D drawing running, VariCAD toll on
				the system's resources is rather small ( output from ps on my
				system running VariCAD):</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="courier">~$ ps aux</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="courier">USER PID %CPU %MEM SIZE RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="courier">dnaden 2406 11.4 2.7 4844 1760 1 S 22:16 0:02 /usr/bin/varicad</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">The interface is very plain which is a plus
				in my opinion. Starting with ver. 6.2-0.3, the 'tool-tip' style
				description is available for all the buttons of the toolbar,
				which is a very important feature if you are just strarting to
				use the software. On-line manual is available from the drop-down
				menu, and it is very complete. Some parts suffer from
				less-than-optimum english translation, but I haven't found that
				to be in a way of getting the gist of the information through.
				Then again, my english is not perfect, either...</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Sytem starts up in a 2-D mode, and switching
				into the 3-D mode is a matter of simple click on the icon in the
				top right-hand corner. Default toolbar features the icons for
				drafting functions, and paging through the toolbars for other
				functions ( dimensioning, for example) is done by clicking on the
				respective icon in the bottom part of the toolbar. All toolbars
				seem to be of the tear-off variety, but I haven't tested that
				extensively ( I like my interface clean). And all the functions
				are available through the drop-down menus as well.</FONT></P>
				
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">First thing I have noticed is that panning
				and zooming back and forth is done fast. A simple subjective
				comparison between very similar machines running CADKEY (TM)for
				Windows(TM) v.7.5 (under WinNT(TM)) and VariCAD v6.2-0.3 under
				Debian/GNU Linux v.2.0 would suggest that VariCAD is slightly
				faster in redrawing the screen. Another feature I like is the way
				zooming and panning work (users of Pro/E should feel at home
				here): dragging the mouse ( and having the Shift+LMB pressed) up
				and down zooms in and out, respectively, and dragging the mouse,
				having the Control+LMB pressed, does the panning. It is very
				convenient feature when you get used to it. And if you get lost
				in all this zooming and panning, there is a feature called Aerial
				View, which brings up a small window with the overview of the
				entire drawing area and highlights the square you are in at that
				moment in the main window ( I believe I have seen same feature in
				AutoCAD Lite(TM)...). Other noticeable feature ( for me at least)
				enables one to highlight the feature when the mouse cursor is
				over it. If you ever worked with lots of lines spaced close to
				each other, you will learn to appreciate this. It can also
				highlight feature's significant points (i.e. end- or mid- point
				of the line, center of the circle and so on) by popping up a
				small code when your cursor is on top of it. I haven't had that
				in CADKEY(TM), so it will take me some time before I can remember
				all the symbols and their meaning, but AutoCAD(TM) users should
				be familiar with them ( for example, @ for the center of the
				circle...).</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Otherwise, VariCAD seems to have all the
				drafting, geometric tolerancing and dimensioning functions one
				would expect to find in a decent CAD package. In addition to
				that, there is a macro language, which I haven't had a chance to
				try yet, rather complete 3-D kernel (see some screenshots from
				VariCAD's site) and ability to import DXF and IGES formats. I
				have imported a 1.2Mb DXF file from CADKEY(TM) without a lost
				line, but dimension text was angled, and it could not be edited.
				But, as I said, I used CADKEY (TM)to export the file, and
				therefore the file is being translated twice, and it is hard for
				me to determine which one is &quot;wrong&quot; translation. I
				haven't tried to optimize the translator in VariCAD either.
				Translation itself is transparent, which means that as soon as
				you read the DXF or IGS file, VariCAD produces its native (dwb)
				file on which you continue to work. To translate the file to DXF
				from within the VariCAD, just save the file with a DXF extension.
				As simple as that.</FONT></P>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Developers have been smart enough to include
				in the &quot;core&quot; software a database of Parts, consisting
				of nuts, bolts, washers, pins and SKF bearings. Also a part of
				the package is a calculation program for calculating spur and
				straight bevel gears, splines, shafts, bearings and compression
				and extension springs, as well as the V-belt drives. ( I have
				probably missed some other elements in here. Check out <A href="http://www.varicad.com/gallery.htm">their site</A> for full
				description...) There is also a possibility of creating the
				information needed for making the BoMs, although I haven't
				touched that yet myself. I also haven't had the need to print
				anything as of yet; most of my jobs are being sent in a DXF
				format on a floppy.</FONT></P>
				
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">The only gripe I have with the software is
				that I can't seem to be able to find out how to dimension to or
				from &quot;imagined&quot; intersection. I frequently need to use
				the dimension from this or that edge to the intersection of the
				chamfered or radiused corner, and I can not get VariCAD to
				recognize that I want to use the point where two lines would have
				intersected each other, had it not been for the radius for
				example, as one of the references for the dimension. If anyone
				knows how to do it, please let me know.</FONT></P>
	<H3><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">People Behind The Software (Support)</FONT></H3>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">I have found people at VariCAD to be knowledgable and courteous.
				Everyone, from sales rep in Canada to their HQ in Checz Republic,
				had answered my e-mails within 24 hours. As an example: in the
				6.1 version, there was a bug in vertical dimensioning when using
				the toleranced dimension (the dimension line would not break
				around the text, but go right through the text). I have written
				an E-mail about it to their tech support, and within 12 hours, I
				had an answer- they were aware of it, and it happened only in
				inch drawings, not in metric ones, and will fix it in upcoming
				6.2 version. Fair enough, I thought... About a month later, on
				the very day of the new version release, I have received an
				E-mail (from the same tech support guy) notifiying me that the
				new version is available for download, and the bug I have asked
				about had been squashed. That is what I consider a good customer
				service.</FONT></P>
	
	<H3><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">Other User's Opinions On VariCAD</FONT></H3>
	
	<P><FONT face="Lucida,Helvetica">In a couple ow weeks my mCAd page was up, I have already received a couple of E-mail responses from other VariCAD users. Thanks for your input. Keep it coming...
	<BR>
	One user had a problem with too much mousing (not enough command line input) in the earlier (but don't know which) version of variCAD and didn't try it since. I know there is a command line input, but as I said, it is not straight *utoCAD copy, so some commands may need re-learning. And also the quality of the help files was questioned, but I maintain that is mainly a language barrier. We English speaking folks take the fact that everyone knows English too much for granted.
	<BR>
	The other E-mail was regarding the inconsistent volume calculator. I
can not attest or deny that, as I didn't use 3-D enough as of yet, and VariCAD
allegedly claims they have had no such problems.</font>
