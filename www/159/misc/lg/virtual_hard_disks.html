Hi, I was wondering what are the possibilities of creating and using virtual
disks for. I understand I can use dd to create it then mkfs.ext3 or
something like it to format the disk. What purpose could they be used for
besides serving as a foundation for creating a live cd?
</p>

<p>
I want to do this from the cli so no gui.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

<p>

I've used this "virtual hard disk" on occasion, for spot fixes to problems. I 
can't think of a "permenant" use for it, though, although others might be 
able to.
</p>

<p>
The biggest use I have is for "virtual cdroms". I take a dd image of a cdrom 
or data dvd, and save it on a hard disk. This gives me a library of images 
that I can pick and choose from; I can install Windows XP into a virtual 
machine without having to find the original CDROM, I can mount my Slackware 
install DVD and install new software (or upgrade old software), etc.
</p>

<p>
The second use I have for "virtual hard disks" is to place a Unixish file 
system (any one of the Linux fs that support unix file attribute bits, 
uid/gid, and mtime/ctime/utime) onto a USB thumb drive. Rather than reformat 
the drive (and thus make it unavailable to Windows machines), I create a VFAT 
file on the drive, and populate it with a Linux fs. On Linux, I can mount 
this file as a fs and have all the features you expect in a linux file 
system, and on MSWindows, I can run Linux in a VM, and give it access to the 
file through Windows.

<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/vfs/file bs=1024 count=&lt;number of Kbytes in fs&gt;
mkfs -t &lt;filesystemtype&gt; /path/to/vfs/file
mount -t &lt;filesystemtype&gt; -o loop /mount/point /path/to/vfs/file
... do your work...
umount /mount/point

The term "virtual disk" is misleading here -- what you're referring to
are essentially loopback files, a la:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
dd if=/dev/zero of=/somefile bs=1024 count=300000
</pre>

<p>
That will create a 30GiB zero-filled file called "somefile".
</p>

<p>
Then what you want to do with that is attach a loopback device to the file:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
losetup /dev/loop0 /somefile
</pre>

<p>
(It may well be that /dev/loop0 is in use -- there are up to 8 loopback devices:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
/dev/loop{1,2,3,4}
</pre>

<p>
Use whichever is available.)
</p>

<p>
Then create a filesystem on it:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
mkfs -t ext3 -m 1 -v /dev/loop0
</pre>

<p>
(Replacing "/dev/loop0 if applicable with the above.)
</p>

<p>
Then you can mount it somewhere:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
mount -t ext3 /dev/loop0 /mnt
</pre>

<p>
(Replacing "/dev/loop0 if applicable with the above.)
</p>

<p>
Do stuff under /mnt as you would with a normal directory then when you're done:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
umount /mnt
losetup -d /dev/loop0
</pre>

<p>
(Replacing /dev/loop0 if applicable.)
</p>

<p>
Disk images are also widely used in forensics; it's the recommended
practice in data recovery to work with a copy of the hard drive you
want to recover from; PC emulators use virtual disks out of necessity
(generally, whole disk images, but qemu for one can use 'partition'
images, like this, coLinux uses them by default); if your kernel has
support, you can use NB (<a href='http://nbd.sourceforge.net/'>http://nbd.sourceforge.net/</a>) to serve disk
images to diskless clients, who can then use them as though they were
real disks; the list of possible uses is only limited by the
imagination <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; '''
&gt; 
&gt; That will create a 30GiB zero-filled file called "somefile".
</pre>

<p>
This command will really write 30 GiB to disk. If you just want to
create a file that can store up to 30 GiB "on demand", you can use this:
</p>

<pre>
dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=1 count=0 seek=30GB
</pre>

<p>
disk.img will show have a size of 30 GB, but it will only use the blocks
that are actually used (when using it as a disk image for example). The
file produced is called a sparse file.
</p>

<p>
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file</a>
</p>

<p>
Sparse files are quite handy when you store the disks of virtual
machines.
