<P>
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
I've been slightly ill the past week, and as a result, I have been
more than slightly grumpy. My fellow employees are avoiding me like the 
plague, and I don't blame them. Illness should be declared illegal, so this
sort of alienation doesn't go on. :-)
<P> 
I went to see <I>Titanic</I> for the second time--this time with my
husband Riley. We saw it at the local Cinerama--that big curved screen is
just awesome for "larger than life" films such as this one. It was fun
seeing the February cover of <I>Linux Journal</I> sail by.
<P> 
I'm planning to set up a page for translations of <I>LG</I> into languages
other than English. If you have such a site or know of one, please let me
know.
<P> 
Have fun!
