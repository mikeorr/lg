<h2 align=center>Some theory...</h2>

<b>Introduction</b><p>

LinuxThreads 
is a Linux library for multi-threaded programming. LinuxThreads
provides kernel-level 
threads: threads are created with the <em>clone()</em> system call and
all scheduling is done in the kernel. It
implements the Posix 1003.1c 
API (Application Programming Interface) for threads and runs on any
Linux system with kernel 2.0.0 
or more recent, and a suitable C library.

<p>
<b>What are threads?</b>
<p>

A thread is a sequential flow of control through a
program. Thus multi-threaded programming is a 
form of parallel programming where several threads of control are
executing concurrently in the program. 
<p>
Multi-threaded programming differs from Unix-style multi-processing in
that all threads share the 
same memory space (and a few other system resources, such as file
descriptors), instead of running in 
their own memory space as is the case with Unix processes.
So a context switch between two threads in a single process is
considerably cheaper than a context 
switch between two processes
<p>
There are two main reasons to use threads:
<OL>
	<LI> Some programs reach their best performance only expressed as
several threads that communicate together (i.e. servers), rather than
a single flow of instructions.<P>
	<LI> On a multiprocessor system, they can run in parallel on
several processors, allowing a single program to divide its work
between different processor. Such programs run faster than a single-thread 
program which can exploits only a CPU at a time.<P>
</OL>


<b>Atomicity and volatility</b>
<p>

Accessing the memory shared from threads require some care, because 
your parallel program can't access shared memory
objects as they were in ordinary local memory.<p>

<em>Atomicity</em> refers to the concept that an operation on an object is
  accomplished as an indivisible, uninterruptible, sequence.

Operations on data in shared memory can occur not atomically,
and, in addition of that, GCC compiler will often performs some
optimizations, buffering values of shared variables in registers,
avoiding the memory operations needed to ensure that all processors
can see the changes on shared data. <p>   

  To prevent GCC's optimizer from buffering values of shared memory
  objects in registers, all objects in shared memory should be declared
  as having types with the <em>volatile</em> attribute, since
volatile objects reads and writes that require just one word access will
  occur atomically.<p>  

<b>Locks</b>
<p>
 The load and store of the result are
  separate memory transactions: ++<em>i</em> doesn't  always work to
 add one to a variable <em>i</em> 
  in shared memory because other processors could access <em>i</em>
  between these two transactions.  So, having two processes
  both perform ++<em>i</em> might only increment <em>i</em> by one,
 rather than by two. 
<p>
  So you need a system call that prevents a thread to work
  on a variable while another one is changing its value. This
  mechanism is implemented by the lock scheme, explained just below.<br>

Suppose that you have two threads running a routine which change the
value of a shared variable. 
To obtain the correct result the routine must:

<ul>
<li> assert a lock on variable <em>i</em>
<li> modify the value of the locked variable
<li> remove the lock
</ul>

When a lock is asserted on a variable only the thread which locked the
variable can change its value. Even more the flux of the other thread
is blocked on the lock assertion, since only one lock at a time is
allowed for a variable. Only when the first thread remove the lock the
second one can restart asserting its own lock.<p>

Consequently using shared variables may delay memory activity from other
  processors, whereas ordinary references may use local cache.


<h2 align=center>... and some practice</h2>
<p>

<b>The header pthread.h</b>
<p>

The facilities provided by LinuxThreads are available trough the
header /usr/include/pthread.h which declare the prototypes of the
thread routines.<p>
Writing a multi-thread program is basically a 2 step process:
<ul>
<li> use the pthread routines to assert locks on shared variables and
generate the threads.
<li> create a structure for all the parameters you must pass to the
thread subroutine
</ul>

Let's analyze the two steps starting from a brief description of
some basic pthread.h routines.<p>
 

<b>Initialize locks</b>
<p> 

One of the first actions you must accomplish is initialize all the locks.
POSIX locks are declared as variables of type <em>pthread_mutex_t</em>; 
to initialize each lock you will need, call the routine:

<pre>
int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t  *mutex,   
                       const pthread_mutexattr_t *mutexattr);
</pre>

as in the costruction: 

<pre>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
...
 pthread_mutex_t lock;
 pthread_mutex_init(&amp;lock,NULL);
...
</pre>

The function
<em>pthread_mutex_init</em> initializes the mutex object pointed to
by  mutex  according  to the mutex attributes specified in
mutexattr.  If mutexattr is NULL, default  attributes  are
used instead.<p>

In the continuation is shown how to use this initialized locks.<p>

<b>Spawning threads</b>
<p>

POSIX requires the user to declare a variable of type
     <em>pthread_t</em>  to identify each thread. <br>
A thread is generated by the call to:

<pre> 
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, pthread_attr_t *attr, 
                   void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg);
</pre>

On success, the identifier of the newly created thread  is
       stored in the location pointed by the thread argument, and
       a 0 is returned.  On  error,  a  non-zero  error  code  is
       returned.<p>

To create a thread running the routine <em>f()</em> and pass to <em>f()</em>
a pointer to the variable <em>arg</em> use:

<pre>
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
...
 pthread_t thread;
 pthread_create(&amp;thread, NULL, f, &amp;arg).
...
</pre>

The routine <em>f()</em> must have the prototype:

<pre>
void *f(void *arg);
</pre>

<b>Clean termination</b>
<p>

As the last step you need to wait for the termination of all the
threads spawned before accessing the result of the routine
<em>f()</em>. The call to:

<pre>  
int pthread_join(pthread_t th, void **thread_return);
</pre>

suspends the execution of the calling thread
until the thread identified by th  terminates.<br>

If  thread_return  is  not NULL, the return value of th is
stored in the location pointed to by  thread_return. <p>

<b>Passing data to a thread routine</b>
<p>
There are two ways to pass informations from a caller routine to a
thread routine:

<ul>
<li> Global variables
<li> Structures
</ul>

The second one is the best choice in order to preserve the modularity
of the code.<br>
The structure must contain three levels of information; first of all
informations  about the shared variables and locks, second
informations about all data needed by the routine; third an
identification index distinguishing among threads and the number of
CPU the program can exploit (making easy to provide this information
at run time).<p>

Let's inspect the first level of that structure; the information passed
   must be shared among every threads, so you must use pointers to the
   needed variables and locks. To pass a shared variable <em>var</em> of
   the type <em>double</em>, and its lock, the structure must
   contain two members:

<pre>
  double volatile *var;
  pthread_mutex_t *var_lock;
</pre>

Note the use of the volatile attribute, specifying that not pointer
itself but <em>var</em> is volatile.<p>

<b>Example of parallel code</b>
<p>
An example of program which can be easily parallelized using threads  is the
  computation of the scalar product of two vectors. <br>
The code is shown below with comments inserted.  


<pre>
/* use gcc <progname> -D_REENTRANT -lpthread to compile */

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;pthread.h&gt;

/* definition of a suitable structure */ 
typedef struct
{
  double volatile *p_s;       /* the shared value of scalar product */
  pthread_mutex_t *p_s_lock;  /* the lock for variable s */
  int n;                      /* the number of the thread */
  int nproc;                  /* the number of processors to exploit */
  double *x;                  /* data for first vector */
  double *y;                  /* data for second vector */
  int l;                      /* length of vectors */
} DATA;

void *SMP_scalprod(void *arg)
{
  register double localsum;   
  long i;
  DATA D = *(DATA *)arg;

  localsum = 0.0;
  
/* Each thread start calculating the scalar product from i = D.n 
   with D.n = 1, 2, ... , D.nproc.
   Since there are exactly D.nproc threads the increment on i is just
   D.nproc */ 
  
  for(i=D.n;i&lt;D.l;i+=D.nproc)
     localsum += D.x[i]*D.y[i];
  
/* the thread assert the lock on s ... */
  pthread_mutex_lock(D.p_s_lock);

/* ... change the value of s ... */
  *(D.p_s) += localsum;

/* ... and remove the lock */
  pthread_mutex_unlock(D.p_s_lock);

  return NULL;
}

#define L 9    /* dimension of vectors */

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  pthread_t *thread;    
  void *retval;
  int cpu, i;
  DATA *A;
  volatile double s=0;     /* the shared variable */ 
  pthread_mutex_t s_lock; 
  double x[L], y[L];
  
  if(argc != 2)
    {  
      printf("usage: %s  &lt;number of CPU&gt;\n", argv[0]);
      exit(1);
    }
	
  cpu = atoi(argv[1]);
  thread = (pthread_t *) calloc(cpu, sizeof(pthread_t));
  A = (DATA *)calloc(cpu, sizeof(DATA));

 
  for(i=0;i&lt;L;i++)
    x[i] = y[i] = i;

/* initialize the lock variable */
  pthread_mutex_init(&amp;s_lock, NULL);
  
  for(i=0;i&amp;lt;cpu;i++)
    {
/* initialize the structure */
      A[i].n = i;            /* the number of the thread */
      A[i].x = x;
      A[i].y = y;
      A[i].l = L;
      A[i].nproc = cpu;      /* the number of CPU */
      A[i].p_s = &amp;s;
      A[i].p_s_lock = &amp;s_lock;

      if(pthread_create(&amp;thread[i], NULL, SMP_scalprod, &amp;A[i] ))
	{
	  fprintf(stderr, "%s: cannot make thread\n", argv[0]);
	  exit(1);
	}
    }

  for(i=0;i&lt;cpu;i++)
    {
      if(pthread_join(thread[i], &amp;retval))
	{
	  fprintf(stderr, "%s: cannot join thread\n", argv[0]);
	  exit(1);
	}
    }

  printf("s = %f\n", s);
  exit(0);
}
