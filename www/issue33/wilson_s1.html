<h3>Origins of Generic NQS</h3>
<p>
NQS was originally developed for NASA back in 1985; the source code
was sold to many companies, including Silicon Graphics, Cray Research
and Monsanto Company. SG developed their own variant for use in IRIX 4,
although it was discontinued before IRIX 5. Cray has enjoyed
good commercial success with its NQE product, which features many
enhancements over the original NQS.
<p>
Monsanto chose to place ``Monsanto NQS'' under the GNU GPL 
and provided enhancements for IRIX and ports to several versions of UNIX,
including SunOS and DEC OSF/UNIX, culminating in NQS v3.36 in 1994.
<p>
In 1994, the University of Sheffield began a two-year funded program
to provide all of UK academia with a robust and portable UNIX batch
processing system. The University built on the excellent work of John
Roman at Monsanto, releasing ``Generic NQS'' with new features, fixed
bugs and support for over twenty versions of UNIX, including Linux.
<p>
Today, Generic NQS continues to be supported by Stuart Herbert in his spare
time, using machines running Linux and FreeBSD.
