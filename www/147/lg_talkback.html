<p>
The US Distributor of this product appears to be Hightech Global (
<a href="http://www.hitechglobal.com/Boards/Armadillo9.htm">http://www.hitechglobal.com/Boards/Armadillo9.htm</a>), who is selling it for
$645.  In my humble opinion, that price is substantially too high.  For
comparison, the apparently much more powerful, physically much smaller
Gumstix Verdex XL6P (
<a href="http://gumstix.com/store/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=27&amp;products_id=178">http://gumstix.com/store/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=27&amp;products_id=178</a>)
costs $169, plus perhaps another $100 for various expansion boards--you'd
want at least the $24 VX Breakout board, which has the host USB port on it.
(I'm not affiliated in any way with Gumstix, nor have I ever purchased any
of their products.  I'm thinking seriously about it, though.)
</p>

<p>
Just thought folks should know.

   My apologies for sending an email to a thread that I only saw on the web
   site, and not being a member of the mailing list and all...
</p>

<p>
   But in response to the above subject, I thought someone should mention
   that LZMA is the compression algo behind 7ZIP.  Never mind what it says
   about 7-ZIP not being good for backups, because 7ZIP is the archive
   format, not the compression algo.
</p>

<p>
   So, the usual "tar ... | lzma &gt;some.file" will always work.
</p>

<p>
   Also see <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/260459/">http://lwn.net/Articles/260459/</a> if possible.

<p>
Hey, all.
I've recently downloaded a bunch of HTML files, and wanted to name
them by their title.  I remembered the scripts in the Perl One-Liner
of the Month: The Adventure of the Misnamed Files (LG 84), and thought
that they would be useful, as they seemed to be what I needed.
</p>

<p>
I first tried the one-liner, and instead of the zero, I got 258
(which, btw, is the number of files in the directory I was in)  So I
copied the "expanded" version of the script, and saved it as
../script1.pl.  Ran it, it came up with 0 as output (which, according
to the story, is a Good Thing), so I then tried the second one liner.
Laptop thought for a second, then gave me a command line again.  So, I
run ls, and lo and behold!  No changes.  Tried it with the expanded
version, saved as ../script2.pl.  Same result.
</p>

<p>
I was wondering if you might know of an updated version that I could
try to use?  I'm not well enough versed in Perl to figure it out all
on my own, and I'm not usre what (or where) I should be looking...
</p>

<p>
Also, for reference, the files are all html, and about half named with
an html extension, and the other half have no extension.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.  I'd hate to have to do the task manually.
</p>

Hi,
</p>

<p>
Having read your ipsec articles (125/126) I've been attempting to get a
similar system going.
 
I wonder if you can help? I'm trying to setup an ipsec VPN (tunnel mode)
between two networks which are both behind DSL routers. I've managed to get
it going successfully without the modems, but once they're in place it
doesn't appear to work. Is such a thing possible? The modems both have ports
500/4500 open to allow NAT-T through (and AH/ESP passthrough).

&gt; Suppose you have recorded your console session with "script" command.

&gt; How do you make these "strange" characters to appear as color? Use less 
&gt; -r &lt;your script file&gt; and you'll see colors as they originally appear.

<p>
Which is only half the intention.  You're <strong>still</strong> going to have to run the
result via col(1) first:

col -bx &lt; ./some_file &gt; ./afile &amp;&amp; mv ./afile ./some_file

I had to edit a file to add myself to the folks including cups who

<pre>
&gt; [...]
&gt; Some more questions for you, if you do not mind.
&gt;
&gt; # Indices to maintain
&gt;
&gt; You have mailLocalAddress, mailRoutingAddress and memberUid being
&gt; maintained (in your example slapd.conf). What is calling upon them in
&gt; your example?
</pre>

<p>
These attributes were supposed to be used in a future project, that's
the main reason. I took the slapd.conf from a live server and anonymised
the critical part of the configuration.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; You also have mail listed, isn't mail and mailLocalAddress
&gt; the same thing?
</pre>

<p>
No, we only used the mail attribute in our setup, we ignored
mailLocalAddress.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Also, mailQuotaSize, mailQuotaCount,mailSizeMax; I
&gt; understand mailQuotaSize but did you restrict a user by the # of
&gt; messages in their account (mailQuotaCount) and how did you use
&gt; mailSizeMax?
</pre>

<p>
These attributes are used by the quota management system, which I didn't
describe in the article. It is basically a web-based GUI where
administrators can change these values. Some scripts read the quota
values from the LDAP directory and write it to the Cyrus server by using
the Cyrus Perl API. mailSizeMax isn't used in the setup, but again it
was supposed to be.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Doesn't imap.conf and main.cf hold those values?
</pre>

<p>
AFAIK the imap.conf only holds IMAP-relevant things. Cyrus is only
interested in the authentication, and this is done by saslauthd.
main.cf only holds references to the configuration files that contain
the LDAP lookups.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Does the order in which the indices are listed matter?
&gt;
&gt; ie could:
&gt; index	accountStatus					eq
&gt; index	objectClass,uidNumber,gidNumber			eq
&gt; index	cn,sn,uid,displayName,mail			eq,pres,sub
&gt;
&gt; be written:
&gt; index	cn,sn,uid,displayName,mail			eq,pres,sub
&gt; index	accountStatus					eq
&gt; index	objectClass,uidNumber,gidNumber			eq
&gt;
&gt; also couldnt:
&gt; index	accountStatus					eq
&gt; index	objectClass,uidNumber,gidNumber			eq
&gt; be combined to:
&gt; index	accountStatus,objectClass,uidNumber,gidNumber	eq
&gt;
&gt; Is it separated due to visual aesthetics or does it make a difference to
&gt; the database somehow?
</pre>

<p>
Frankly I doubt that the order matters. The indices I used are an
educated guess. Having too much indices slows things down, having too
few leads also to low performance. Generally speaking all attributes
that are accessed often should have indices.
