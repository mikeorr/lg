<h1>The Linux Launderette</h1>

<p class="editorial">This month's Launderette was compiled by Kat Tanaka
Okopnik while Jimmy O'Regan was nefariously distracted by bus-driving evil
Martian princesses. He's got a more harrowing explanation entitled "The Dog
Ate My Laundry", but who do you believe, really?</p>

Linux Genuine Advantage[tm] is an exciting and mandatory new way
for you to place your computer under the remote control of an untrusted third party!
 
According to an independent study conducted by some scientists, many users of Linux
are running non-Genuine versions of their operating system. This puts them
at the disadvantage of having their computers work normally, without periodically
phoning home unannounced to see if it's OK for their computer to continue functioning.
These users are also missing out on the Advantage of paying ongoing
licensing fees to ensure their computer keeps operating properly.
 
To remedy this, we have created a new program available as a required free
download: Linux Genuine Advantage[tm].

# loop continuously, checking periodically to see if the author of this program got paid.
# if no money has changed hands after 30 days, make the computer less useful as punishment.

I am passing this on to you because it definitely works, and we could all use a little more calmness in our lives. By following simple advice heard on the Dr. Phil show, you too can find inner peace. 
</p>

<p>
Dr. Phil proclaimed, "The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have started and have never finished." So, I looked around my house to see all the things I started and hadn't finished, and before leaving the house this morning, I finished off a bottle of Merlot, a bottle of White Zinfandel, a bottle of bailey's Irish Cream, a bottle of Kahlua, a package of Oreos, the remainder of my old Prozac prescription, the rest of the cheesecake, some Doritos and a box of chocolates. You have no idea how freaking good I feel. Please pass this on to those whom you think might be in need of inner peace.

<h3>Happy Lupercalia</h3>

<b>Rick Moen [rick at linuxmafia.com]</b><br />

</p>

<p>
An estimated one billion greeting cards have been sent out to various
people's inamoratas to help celebrate the feast of Saint Valentinus.
If you're Catholic and your calendar says it's later than 1969, then 
please be advised that Valentine got defrocked just after the Summer of
Love (a Vatican II thing).
</p>

<p>
If you're Eastern Orthodox, then you do still have a Hagio Valentinus --
but his saint's day is July 6th.
</p>

<p>
If you'd rather celebate a less Hallmark holiday, wait until tomorrow,
which is Lupercalia, aka Februatio, the festival of purification, in
which Romans rang out the old year in high fashion:  Priests of Faunus
dubbed the "Luperci" (brothers of the wolf) would gather near the cave
of Lupercal on Palatine Hill (where the she-wolf was supposed to have
raised Rhea Silvia's kids, Romulus and Remus) to sacrifice two male
goats and a dog, smearing blood on their foreheads, eating a feast, 
then dress in (only) the newly flayed goatskins and run a circuit around
the city walls carrying lashes cut from the sacrificial victims.  As
they ran, they lashed young women along their route, to help ensure
fertility.  
</p>

<p>
Plutarch commented (in The Parallel Lives):  "At this time many of the
noble youths and of the magistrates run up and down through the city
naked, for sport and laughter striking those they meet with shaggy
thongs.  And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and
like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that
the pregnant will thus be helped to an it is delivery, and the barren to
pregnancy."
</p>

<p>
Killjoy Pope Gelasius I abolished Lupercalia, and declared the feast of
St. Valentine in its (approximate) place, in 496.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, more goatskins and fewer greeting cards, I say.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hi -
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It's getting a bit late in the month to ask this, but I'm guessing that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you're still swamped and not up to Laundrette.
&gt; &gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; &gt;No... I'm going to have to surprise you with the lesser-known excuse
&gt; &gt; &gt;"I have most of the work done, but it's in my parents house, and I
&gt; &gt; &gt;can't currently complete it as I have the flu, and my sister is living
&gt; &gt; &gt;there with her newborn daughter".
&gt;
&gt; My.  That's a <strong>very</strong> good excuse.
</pre>

<p>
Isn't it? I wish I'd had a few of similar calibre when I was at school :D

&gt;
&gt; Congratulations to your sister, and happy birthing day to Ava - you
&gt; weren't exaggerating about "new born".
&gt;
&gt; (What's the Irish equivalent of looking like Winston Churchhilll,
&gt; anyway?)
</pre>

<p>
Same thing. We're quite familiar with him <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt; &gt;And that's just the stopping point...
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; The rest of the story (of course there's a story, I'm Irish &amp;c. &amp;c.)...
&gt;
&gt; But this <strong>isn't</strong> blarney, I'm sure.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I <strong>would</strong> have been able to do some last minute work on it today, but
&gt; &gt; I was in court - on the 8th I went to the pub for an hour and a half,
&gt; &gt; and passed out while crossing the street afterwards. The woman who
&gt; &gt; almost ran over me phoned the Gardai, and I was arrested.
&gt;
&gt; Yoiks! (We're awfully glad that was only "almost".)
</pre>

<p>
Me too!
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt; I blame the insomnia I've been suffering since the end of the last
&gt; &gt; year (and, fortunately, the judge seemed to agree): this isn't the
&gt; &gt; first or last time that I've passed out from simple fatigue recently.
&gt;
&gt; Given your new duties, that's rather worrying.
</pre>

<p>
Actually, I slept last night, and most of today, without resorting to
chemical assistance. Now that the court visit is behind me I feel free
to relax about the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
That, and I've stopped drinking coffee after 6pm <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
