Australian Linux Community Offering

<P>
Date: Thu, 24 Dec 1998 01:00:31 -0800<BR> 
OzSearch extends its offer to the Australian Linux community to <I>LG</I>
Australian readers as well:
<P>
OzSearch Internet Guide, an all-Australian web directory, recently
released its new web site. The site is intended to offer a starting point
for any complete search for Australian web sites. In addition to
successfully running Linux Red Hat 5.2 (where 100+ days of uptime are
common), the site is powered by Apache v1.3.3 with ModPerl and MySQL. Stress
tests have indicated that this configuration scales exceptionally well.
<P>
To give back to the Linux community, OzSearch is currently seeking to
help sponsor an Australian-based Linux users group. Please provide your
group's information to Kris Duggan (kduggan@ozsearch.com.au).
