<h1>Free as in Freedom: Part Two: Linux for the "Rest of Us"</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/engel.html">Adam Engel</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
[NOTE: all dialog is culled from email conversations unless otherwise 
noted --AE].

<p>
I was fortunate to have found the perfect guide for my journey through 
the politics of GNU/Linux  past and present,   
<a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a>, 
Editor-in-Chief of the Linux Gazette (LG).  Yoga instructor and 
practitioner, Unix instructor and practitioner, writer, editor and 
Linux aficionado, Ben was both open to new ideas, familiar with "old" 
ones, and willing and able to point me in the various directions I 
needed to go to "explain the GNU/Linux model" to mostly non-technical 
"left" and "progressive" readers.

<p>
Okopnik wrote, "Linux is inextricably political - and deliberately so, 
from its very inception. The OS itself is a tool, as sharp, bright, and 
beautiful as it may be; creating a better world, in which human beings 
cooperate rather than fight each other 'to achieve the same exact ends' 
is, from my perspective, the goal."


<p>
It was Okopnik who urged me to publish this article under a GPL-like 
license and pointed me to the website where this could be done in 
minutes.

<p> Okopnik wrote,"Please consider releasing this interview under the Open
Publication License (the OPL is available at <a
href="http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/">http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/</a>),
or something similar. It's not a condition of the interview, but I'd
strongly prefer it. This license respects your commercial rights and can be
"adjusted" to suit your exact purposes; it's the license under which all LG
articles are published," he wrote. 

<p class="editorial">[ This interview was originally slated for publication
in political venues rather than LG; however, I found the end result
interesting enough that I asked Adam to release it here as well. Besides,
I've never seen my name in print before, and wanted to seize a unique
opportunity. :) -- Ben ]

<p> "If you release this interview under the OPL, you can
define whatever restrictions on distribution you choose; as an example,
Cory Doctorow, an excellent and highly-popular writer (see <a
href="http://craphound.com/">http://craphound.com/</a>) recently released
several of his books under the OPL. He talks about his experience on the
site, and as a result of that experience has actually eased off on the
restrictions he originally imposed. Nor is he the first by far; take a look
at, e.g., MIT's OpenCourseWare site: <a
href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html">http://ocw.mit.edu/index.html</a>.
(Good resource to bookmark in any case.)"

<p>
"In order to license this article, I just have to declare it?" I asked.

<p>
"Yep, " wrote Okopnik.  "Do a run-through of the 'wizard' at   
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/license/">http://creativecommons.org/license/</a> 
to make sure that you have exactly 
the license you want - it only takes a few seconds - and it'll generate 
the legal notice you need. Nice and neat."

<p>
I wrote, "I don't have to apply to anyone for approval?"

<p>
Okopnik wrote, "Nope; you're The Boss when it comes to licensing your 
own stuff. Isn't that nice?"

<p> Okopnik also gave me another perspective on the GNU revolution and its
major and minor aspects.  For instance, the FSF's insistence on calling
"Linux"  GNU/Linux though valid, violates the peoples' tendency to
abbreviate (hence the many abbreviations and acronyms in the Unix/GNU/Linux
operating systems themselves), and according to Software Developer and
Systems Designer Paul Ford (author of the popular <a
href="www.ftrain.com">Ftrain</a> website), the 'GNU/' prefix came too late
in the game.  All the "Linux" books and CDs had gone to print; the word
"Linux" came to mean both the kernel and operating system, though Linus
Torvalds and supporters developed the kernel and GNU the other essentials
of the OS.

<p>
"Looking through my 55 MB 'sent mail' archive (gads, but I do a lot of
writing! :), I find myself using the term 'GNU/Linux' exactly once,
back in 2000," wrote Okopnik.

<p>
Ford wrote, "Everyone I know calls it 'Linux.' Everyone appreciates 
Richard
Stallman's extraordinary contributions. He's a genius, and has a
MacArthur genius grant to prove it. But the 'GNU/' prefix was added a
few years too late. I'll call it GNU/Linux in writing, sometimes,
though. Honestly, I don't care what people call it. That entire debate
seemed anathema to the open source ethos, too similar to someone
protecting their registered trademark."

<p>
Regardless of what it's called -- I'll call it GNU/Linux out of respect 
for its GNU origins -- GNU/Linux is a political phenomenon, the 
creation of user/developers for its own sake,  or rather, for their own 
sake.  Rather than succumb to the Microsoft Monopoly, which places 
Windows on virtually every PC sold in America, they created their own 
free system and licensed it not for the benefit of an elite few, but 
for anyone with the capability to alter the code, or learn how to alter 
it (admittedly an elite group, but one based on merit and 
intellectual, rather than corporate, "capital").

<p>
Okopnik describes the "typical" Linux user thus:

<p>
"I don't want to idealize Linuxers in my answers; none of us humans are
perfect saints, and the wild bunch who cleave to this OS and this
community are little different in that respect. However, just as
exaggeration in teaching is used to emphasize a point, isolating or
highlighting the common trends and traits in this case can provide an
interesting introduction. Keeping that in mind -

<p>
"The average Linux user, in my experience, is a product of a filtering
process - several of them, in fact. As in Darwin's description, the
selective pressure is not necessarily powerful, but is eventually
definitive; those who have, and propagate, the more effective traits are
better equipped to survive in a given environment.

<p> "The first, and key, characteristic evident in Joe Linuxer is that he's
a maverick (Jane Linuxer is arguably even more so) - perhaps even somewhat
of a rebel; in any case, an individualist. The desire to not be one of the
herd, to not have to put up with chewing the same stale cud as everyone
else, often propels these people into experimentation with various facets
of their lives. Their computer-usage experience is just one of those
facets. Linux users tend strongly toward the non-usual - for all the good
and bad that this implies.

<p>
"Secondly, they tend to be  capable -- not necessarily able to build a
spaceship out of a bicycle and cook a seven-course meal out of cupboard
scrapings, but willing to assume that they can do, build, repair,
"handle" things. (As a closely-coupled trait, they're often tinkerers,
always trying to unscrew the inscrutable. May the Great Ghu help the
Universe if one of us gets hold of the master key.) Larry Wall, the
creator of the Perl programming language, spoke of the three great
virtues of a programmer (Laziness, Impatience, and Hubris); impatience,
by Larry's definition, is the anger a programmer feels when the computer
is being lazy, which causes him to create long-term solutions rather
than short-term Band-Aids. Linuxers are often excellent examples of this
laudable kind of impatience - and Linux provides the opportunity to
exercise it effectively.

<p> "As a result, Linuxers tend to feel a sense of <em>ownership</em> of
their system; they have not only gone out of the common path to install a
different OS but have tinkered with it, tweaked it, made it uniquely
"theirs" - and just as, e.g., long-distance sailors grant each other the
respect due to those who face the challenges of the ocean, Linuxers gather
in communities in which respect (specifically, respect for knowledge,
competence, and contribution to the community - but several other flavors
coexist as well) is the common thread as well as the coin of the realm."


<h3>KDE and GNOME: Linux for "The Rest of Us"</h3>

<p> I first came to GNU/Linux in 1996, when it was already a world-wide
phenomenon, but still a 'techie/hacker' thing.  I was on the command-line
for six months before I installed X-windows; nevertheless, I was surprised
at the number of alternatives a Unix-type system gave me, especially as a
writer in terms of text formatting, manipulation, etc.; Emacs, Vim and
though I didn't get into Tex or nroff, I used Applixware to do the
formatting one does in a WYSIWYG word-processor.

<p> I wrote to Okopnik, "Because of various jobs I took as both a
free-lance and cubicle-bound ad-man and copywriter, I had to install
Windows merely to run 'Word' and 'Powerpoint' and gradually moved away from
Linux for about four years. When I came back to it with SuSE 9.0 in
December of 2003 I was astonished. KDE (<a
href="http://kde.org">KDE.org</a>'s free desktop environment), GNOME (GNU's
free desktop environment), Open Office (<a
href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>'s free office suite), the
whole new GUI interface floored me.

<p> Okopnik wrote, "This is not an uncommon reaction in this venue. The
rates of growth and development in Linux are simply phenomenal - and still
accelerating."


<p>
I wrote to Okopnik, "KDE and GNOME, especially KDE 3.1x, worked as 
well as or better than the Win2000 I had installed four years ago, and 
I've yet to experience a full crash -- that's par for the daily use of 
Windows 2000.  More significantly, I was turned onto the 'New Linux' by 
someone who knew about as much about the GNU/Linux command-line as the 
typical Windows user knows about Unix's retarded younger brother, DOS.

<p> "Similarly, I turned someone else who was sick of Microsoft's shoddy
but expensive products to the mind-boggling array of free software programs
that run under GNU/Linux, though he had neither the time nor the
inclination to learn about the operating system. Like many users, all he
wanted and needed was a word-processor, a browser, a mail program, some
games, and as little trouble as possible. SuSE 9.0 provided him with all
of these things, and now, after a year on GNU/Linux, he knows slightly more
about the command-line than he did DOS. But no desire to go back to
Windows.

<p> "Have  you noticed more of an interest in Linux or an enhanced
readership for the Linux Gazette since Linux became both market and user
friendly?  If so, are these new users less interested in the 'technical'
aspects than in having a stable GUI-based system to use for work and email
and net-surfing?"

<p> Okopnik responded, "Actually, this is an issue that I brought up in an
involved discussion with the LG staff and the Answer Gangsters (<a href="
http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html">The Answer Gang</a> answers
Linux questions sent to us by our readers, and the discussions and the
answers become part of LG.) My viewpoint here is that it's actually a very
good thing - modulo the awareness that the command-line (CLI) exists. That
is, people are perfectly welcome to come to Linux and use only its GUI
capabilities as long as this serves their needs - but when the GUI proves
insufficient, the capabilities of the CLI are there, just underneath,
providing the perfect security blanket.

<p>
"In an article I wrote for Java Developers Journal, I related an example
of this. I had a client whose Web developer left them in the lurch with
several hundred HTML files without the '.html' extensions. This wouldn't
be too bad by itself - renaming a group of files isn't difficult - but
the thousands of HTML links within the files referred to those
extensionless names as well. With GUI-only tools, this is a
nearly-unsolvable disaster. From the CLI, it was a matter of a single
short line of code:
<pre>
perl -i -wpe 's/(&lt;a href="[^"]+)/$1.html/g' *
</pre>
The readership of The Linux Gazette (LG) has certainly changed over 
time. Where we used to get dozens of questions on fairly technical 
topics in The Answer Gang, we now get only a few - and they tend to be
simpler, less technical. The email I get from our readers indicates that
there has indeed been a definite shift in the user base; the old Linuxer
who would bang on a problem for hours so that it could be reported (and
quickly fixed) is being... well, not  replaced,  but reduced,
percentage-wise, as the mainstay of the population. The new user is often
just that - a computer user who just wants that
email/web/document/spreadsheet processor and maybe a few games on the side.
There is, however, a cultural shift that occurs even in those users after a
while: you cannot live in a society based on a given moral premise and
ignore that premise, or even stop it from penetrating into your life (even
if you try to prevent it.) The original "hacker ethic" of Linux lives on,
strong as ever in those who use the full extent of this OS, and inherent
(and growing, however slowly) in those who use it even without that full
knowledge."

<p> Paul Ford wrote, "I used to think there was too much emphasis in the
community on claiming the desktop, trying to compete with Windows, but the
latest GNOME is attractive and elegant, and works great, looks as good as
MacOS X, and doesn't feel like a thin skin over Unix at all. It's an
environment I could use every day. So I was wrong--the desktop was a good
aim, it just took a while to get things to a good point."

<p>
According to George Staikos, a KDE developer and spokesperson, "The KDE
project was formed by a small group of computer programmers and Linux and
UNIX users who were fed up with the lousy state of user interfaces
available for their operating systems.  They wanted something that was
fast, powerful, featureful, and looked good.  Notice that making money was
not one of the requirements.  They set out to accomplish this task in the
most effective manner possible, which was to use the Qt toolkit (at the
time distributed free of charge for non-commercial use under a restrictive
license, but now distributed under the free GPL license for non-commercial
use).  Because there were very many people around the world with similar
desires and compatible skills, because there was no risk of someone
hijacking the project and turning it into a business, and because there was
actually proof-of-concept working code already being produced, the project
quickly grew.  After a few years, the core of the system was very solid and
new programmers could easily find a niche to work in, implementing that
feature they always wanted or fixing that bug that has bothered them for so
long. These individuals are what makes KDE work.  They keep the project
evolving, bringing new ideas and new manpower.  There is relatively no risk
involved in contributing, and the rewards are plenty.  Developers
(including coders, translators, documenters, artists, and more) can
contribute whatever they have time for.

<p>
"Of course there are other requirements to keeping such a project 
going. We need bandwidth, servers, funds for promotion and travel, and 
more.  This tends to come from corporate users who are kind enough to 
contribute back to ensure the progress of the project, and from home 
users who perhaps can't contribute in other ways.  Some people also 
contribute system administration time.  This is all very vital to the 
success of KDE.

<p>
"It's important to note, however, that KDE is indeed paid for, as much 
as any other software is.  KDE is paid for by individuals, and paid for 
in a distributed manner.  Our time, as KDE developers, is worth as much 
money as any other software developer (More, if you ask me.  KDE 
developers tend  to be one smart bunch!).  KDE is indeed a very costly 
project, and is paid for by society itself, as much as a result of the 
lack of momentum of the commercial sector to create a useful solution 
to existing problems.

<p>
"What is KDE  'worth'?  The freely available SLOCCount tool gives me an
estimate of $22.6 million just for the KDE libraries alone, a small 
fraction of what is KDE.  Most of the code in the KDE libraries was 
developed from 1999 through 2004, almost 6 years in total.  Not 
including the Qt toolkit, KDE must be worth well over $250 million.  
This also doesn't include artwork, documentation and language 
translations, which KDE is well known for.

<pre>
"Total Physical Source Lines of Code (SLOC)               = 608,228
Development Effort Estimate, Person-Years (Person-Months) = 167.61 (2,011.32)
   (Basic COCOMO model, Person-Months = 2.4 * (KSLOC**1.05))
Schedule Estimate, Years (Months)                         = 3.75 (45.01)
   (Basic COCOMO model, Months = 2.5 * (person-months**0.38))
Estimated Average Number of Developers (Effort/Schedule)  = 44.69
Total Estimated Cost to Develop                           = $ 22,641,821
   (average salary = $56,286/year, overhead = 2.40)

(this data was  generated using David A. Wheeler's 'SLOCCount' tool)"
</pre>

<p> I wrote, "Was KDE originally supposed to be free-ware? I remember when
I first saw the specs in the late nineties, I thought it seemed too good to
believe.  Yet it's here and working and continues to grow in  functionality
and popularity.   In fact, the SuSE 9.x package uses KDE as its  Graphic
base.  Can this go on without some serious cash flow?"

<p> Staikos wrote, "Yes, KDE was definitely supposed to be free, both in
cost, and in terms of speech.  KDE was to be available free of cost to all,
and available for modification and learning as desired as long as it was
not abused for commercial gain by others who weren't interested in
contributing back.  That is to say, the licensing prohibits using KDE code
in a non-free project, though you may use KDE for that project.  For
example, you cannot copy source code from KDE and embed it in your
commercial, closed-source application. The KDE license actually requires
you to release the source for your application as well.  However, you may
make calls to the KDE libraries from your application.  In short, free to
use, yes, free to steal from, no.

<p> "Indeed KDE is growing rapidly in popularity.  We do need to find new
ways to support the project in terms of getting the hardware we need, the
administration help we need, the legal work done, and paying for
conferences and developer meetings.  It's an ongoing struggle.

<p> "Making money is not a bad thing, and I think making money off of KDE
is a  good thing for KDE.  Stealing code from KDE is however not a good
thing, and that's what the GPL protects us from.  Most of KDE is licensed
under the GPL, while the libraries tend to use the LGPL in order to permit
commercial KDE applications to be developed.  Some portions of KDE are
under more liberal licenses such as the Berkely Software Development (BSD)
license because the author did not have concerns with others using that
code in non-free software.  KDE as a project maintains that our software
must be compatible with the GPL, but it need not be specifically licensed
under the GPL," wrote Staikos.

<p> I wrote, "I know several people who, finally fed up with Windows, and
not wanting to deal with getting a new Mac, switched over to GNU/Linux even
though they know only the rudiments of command-line arguments and don't
plan on learning much more. Like many users, all they use their  computers
for is word-processing, presentations, a web browser, and email.  Since the
advent of KDE and GNOME, people can use  GNU/Linux the way they use Mac or
Windows without spending the time and effort necessary to learn a Unix-like
OS. This would have been unthinkable a few years back, even with relatively
user-friendly Window Managers like Windowmaker and IceWM.  One of the
people I'm interviewing for this article, the editor of the Linux Gazette,
confirmed this 'trend.' More and more of his readers are concerned with
'typical' user issues rather than the more technical aspects of Linux.  Do
you think that with the advent of GUI-based Desktop Environments such as
KDE that GNU/Linux will appeal to a wider audience who want a choice other
than Mac or Windows?"

<p> Staikos wrote, "Most definitely.  This was the original goal of KDE,
and still remains one. However KDE does not have the resources to provide a
real end-user system. We only 'ship' source code, and it is up to the
distributors to set their preferred configuration defaults, customize the
menus, and determine which applications to add or remove.  These things are
absolutely vital to creating a valuable end-user experience, and in fact
are different for each target market.  I think Linux with KDE is already a
perfectly suitable solution for  the average desktop system.  The obstacles
in place are more monopolistic in nature.  Users are accustomed to the way
MS Windows works.  They learned this over many years, and expect that all
computers work this way, even if it's inefficient or poorly designed.
They're impatient to learn a new system, and balk at the idea of using
Linux.  Furthermore, most commercial applications are designed only for MS
Windows.  It's hard to justify using Linux when your favorite video game or
other software only runs on Windows.  Hopefully we will change this over
time, as KDE becomes more popular and software developers can justify
porting to Linux.

<p> "I think KDE is one of the driving factors that is pushing Linux into
the mainstream, and I do hope that it will one day be a serious competitor
in terms of user base to MS Windows.  The world needs an alternative, and
Linux is here to provide it," wrote Staikos.

<p>
While GNU/Linux is  "inextricably political," both Ford and  Okopnik 
admit that most users are less into the politics than the practical 
applications of the system itself.

<p> Ford wrote, "Linux has a pretty amazing advantage in that you get
something for free, or a very low cost, out of the movement. It's hard for
any movement based on ideas to compete with that -- it's not like you can
say, 'if you buy into Noam Chomsky's theory of foreign policy, we'll give
you a free Chomsky hat.' Whereas Linux can say, 'if you're willing to
believe that Open Sourced software works, we'll give you a free operating
system with all the trimmings and cranberry sauce.' So the two 'movements'
don't really compare."

<p> While for the Stallman and the FSF the difference between the "free"
and "open source" movements is crucial, for Ford they are pretty much the
same.

<p> "I think they're usually interchangeable, " Ford wrote. "And in truth,
I don't really  care that much. If a license is similar to the GPL, I'll go
with it. For things like OCR or image editing, I don't mind buying
commercial  tools. They tend to be in much better shape than their
open-sourced  counterparts. They're very task-based -- I'm scanning a page,
or creating an image. If good replacement software comes along, I'll use
that. But in the meantime, the work is done--I've got my output....But for
any programming project, where people need to work together,  and thousands
of hours go into developing code, I'm terrified of  commercial software.
Lock-in is  terrifying.... Basically, when I'm looking for a tool, I go
"shopping" for the open-sourced version first. Open-sourced software lets
me try out a huge number of solutions to find the best one--if I don't
like one package, I can see if there's a better one," wrote Ford.
