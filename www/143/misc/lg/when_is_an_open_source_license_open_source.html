<p>
Hi, Aaron.  Thank you for the URL.  Being tied down in a software
upgrade at the moment, I don't have much time to comment, but here are a
few thoughts.  I speak, here, largely as a student of rhetoric.
</p>

<p>
1.  Just so you know, "open letters" have always been non-starters:
They pretty much scream "ignore me", to most people.  This has nothing
to do with the merit of what's said; it's just a reflexive reaction
people tend to develop towards anything described as that. 
</p>

<p>
IMO, if you want to be taken seriously, refactor to avoid that
unfortunate language.  E.g., you could send an <em>actual</em> letter to the
OSI Board and then reproduce on your Web site a copy of it.
</p>

<p>
2.  The paragraph starting with "If you read my personal blog..." 
will tend to give to casual observers the impression of your dwelling on
and boring them with your past complaints.  To be really blunt, it has
the surface flavour of whining (e.g., "been called infantile names"),
and nobody likes a whiner.  Again, this has nothing to do with the
substance of what you're saying.  It's a presentation issue, and
presentation is important, because people filter what they read
mercilessly, and you want to avoid all the obvious reasons (common
heuristics) why people stop reading something and move on.
</p>

<p>
3.  The phrase "I've left lengthy comments at OSI" in this paragraph
is unfortunate for the same reason:  The reader of your current point
doesn't have any use for this information, and it just gives such 
readers another candidate reason for ignoring you.  They may dismiss you
as one of those tireless cranks who deluge online forums with barrages
comments and then complain that nobody takes them seriously.
</p>

<p>
4.  
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I've blogged about SugarCRM and it's CEO John Roberts previously (the
&gt; last bit of this post). 
</pre>

<p>
And your point?  None is evident.  Again, since there's no obvious
<em>reason</em> cited why you mention this, the casual impression this gives is
of someone who simply blogs a great deal, and wants to send readers on a
long chain of links because what you say is so very vital in its full
detail that you couldn't possibly summarise, i.e., like a crank.
</p>

<p>
5.  
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Previously I stated I wasn't certain if attribution licenses were
&gt; "bad", but that they were definitely unnecessary and placed unfair
&gt; restrictions on others because the authors don't provide similar
&gt; concessions to projects they use in their development.
</pre>

<p>
"Unfair" is, again, an unfortunate word to use in this context, as it
triggers people's crank filters unless there's an obvious reason cited
right there, as to <em>why</em> someone is said to be undergoing some notable
unfairness -- and you don't cite one.  Actually, in that connection, 
one might reasonably note upon examination that "fair" is not at issue,
here:  The mere fact that a Web 2.0 house elects to use open source
codebases in the development of proprietary offerings does NOT impose
any obvious moral obligation to use the same sort of licensing.
</p>

<p>
Don't use appeals to morals that invite people to say "What?  Fairness
how exactly?"  It's poor rhetoric to inspire your readers to revolt
against you and argue with you in their heads.
</p>

<p>
6.  
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Those who use an attribution license do so with the intent of protecting
&gt; their intellectual property. First of all, it should be understood
&gt; copyright does this already.
</pre>

<p>
You're deluting your point by indulging in a basically irrelevant
digression, here:  The occasional references to "Well, we do that to
protect our intellectual property" from badgeware firm executives
just reflect confusion and fuzzy-thinking:  They know there's <em>some</em> 
concern about the firm's interests and it somehow involves copyright,
but they don't really understand it, so they blurt out "We're protecting
our intellectual property" because it sounds plausible to them and is in
at least the right ballpark.  (The MuleSource guy did this on
license-discuss, if I recall correctly -- or was it Roberts?)
</p>

<p>
Pointing out to them that the phrase as stated is nonsense doesn't help:
They know there's <em>some</em> concern, and you're not going to get anywhere
until you articulate it <em>for</em> them and address it.  In point of fact,
they're concerned about an analogue of vTiger's forking of SugarCRM, and
want to make sure that their competitors can't make forks of
their code and fully exploit those forks behind closed doors under a
completely different name without their own work being apparent to users
at all, and without entitlement to receive back changes.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; This is mostly solved by using GPL because of the nature of its
&gt; copyleft clause. 
</pre>

<p>
You're wrong (at least, through GPLv2).  You have missed the point.
</p>

<p>
The point concerns the "ASP loophole", the thing that vTiger exploited, 
which is a problem with most copyleft licences.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; All the attribution licenses I've seen are modified MPL licenses,
&gt; which doesn't offer the same protection as GPL.  [...] For additional
&gt; historical perspective on this topic review the  UC Berkeley
&gt; advertising clause.
</pre>

<p>
Again, you are completely missing the threat model, making your entire
exposition pretty much irrelevant to the problem.
</p>



<pre>
&gt; I suspect the Free Software Foundation would claim there is a
&gt; difference between being free and using free software and would draw
&gt; this line between free software and open source.
</pre>

<p>
Another digression.  Irrelevant digressions should be avoided, because
they distract from and dilute your point.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; before I constructively criticize OSI I want to address why open
&gt; source is so very important to all of mankind.
</pre>

<p>
This might be vital to mankind but, again, this sort of slightly
goofy-sounding digression is fatal to your rhetorical effectiveness.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; First and foremost there needs to be a membership, member involvement,
&gt; and some transparency in how the board is appointed. 
</pre>

<p>
And here, you are guilty of unpacking your <em>entire</em> Christmas gift
wishlist, which is a really bad error when you're trying to advocate one
thing.  You typically should, instead, pick one point and build a case
for it, carefully avoiding hauling out the list of other things you'd
like to have as gifts when you're annointed Philosopher-King.

Thank you for receiving my comments in the spirit intended.  I admired

a relief to hear that you understood my intending no personal criticism.

<p>
It is indeed concise, clear, and dignified.

<p>
(Interesting that you cited Tony Bowden's blog post about Radcliffe:
I happen to have come across that a few days ago, myself, and cited it
to _Linux Gazette_.)
</p>

<p>
If you have time, I would appreciate your elaborating on your closing
comment:
</p>

<p>
   I too once believed Affero to be a useful clause, but I have since
   come to understand that GPLv2 or v3 provide sufficient protection with
   copyleft and maximize the benefits and freedoms to the entire market of
   users, developers, and companies.
</p>

<p>
Let's consider a specific scenario, just for clarity's sake, and please
explain to me what I'm missing, because this actually is one of the key 
points I'm uncertain about, that is delaying my recap article about the
ASP / SaaS market, badgeware, and copyleft:  
</p>

<p>
Consider Google Calendar, a hosted Web app.  Let's say my friend and
former co-worker Chris di Bona convinces his employer (Google, Inc.) to
release full source code under (your choice of<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> GPLv[23].    
</p>

<p>
...actually, since I just had a similar conversation with a friend from
out of town, let me quote my message to him, by way of example:

&gt; Hi Rick,
&gt; 
&gt; Found a video of the Eben Moglen/ Tim O'Reilly exchange at OSCon. It
&gt; was titled "Licensing in the Web 2.0 Era". Unfornatley, the video
&gt; appears to be in a .mov quicktime format, but seems playable on Free
&gt; software players(w/ unFree codecs).
&gt; <a href="http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/3282956/">http://www.mefeedia.com/entry/3282956/</a>
&gt; <a href="http://blip.tv/file/get/Radar-EbenMoglenLicensingInTheWeb20Era126.mov">http://blip.tv/file/get/Radar-EbenMoglenLicensingInTheWeb20Era126.mov</a>
</pre>

<p>
Thank you!
</p>

<p>
The rumours I heard about that exchange made me instantly slow down my
ongoing effort to try to make sense for _Linux Gazette_ readers of the
whole issue:  I'd been warming up for a long piece recapping the
controversy and recent developments including OSI approval of a (very
modest and minimal) badgeware licence as OSD-compliant.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, rather than imagining myself being Matt Asay or John Roberts, I
imagined myself as an ethical Web 2.0 entrepreneur, one who <em>wished</em> to
use and comply with copyleft, and see if I had a problem.  To my
surprise, I found that the answer was "yes":  Such an entrepreneur who
published code under, say, GPLv2 <em>or</em> GPLv3 would be relatively speaking
at the mercy of less-ethical business competitors who hosted derivative
works (of the ethical businessman's code) behind closed doors without
needing to comply with any copyleft giveback provision, while still
making the code fully usable by all of the less-ethical firm's
customers, via network access.
</p>

<p>
That code-reuse scenario renders the allegedly-copylefted code _in practice_
BSD licensed -- i.e., de-facto forkable as a proprietary derivative
work.  If the intent (of releasing under GPLv2 or GPLv3) is to require
reciprocity from others, then the usage model defeats that intent.  The
"ASP loophole" problem is real.  Badgeware clauses are (in the general
case) a really <em>bad</em> way of dealing with that problem, but the first
thing necessary for progress is to admit the problem's reality, and
describe its dimensions.
</p>

<p>
But then, just as I was preparing to write-up my understanding of the
problem, along came descriptions of Eben Moglen's blowup against Tim
O'Reilly at OSCON, and suddenly I'm saying "Huh?"  Prof. Moglen is
someone I <em>do</em> respect highly, so I needed to chase down what he said, 
even if there was only a small chance he was saying my understanding is
totally wrong.  Because, well, my understanding might be totally wrong.
</p>




<pre>
&gt; ps. What was that name of that book that you where discussing at Linux
&gt; Picnix about the Renaissance? It was a case study done about Florence
&gt; Nightingale, the father of the rugby school, and someone else. TIA.
</pre>

<p>
Not the Renaissance, but rather Victorian England.  _Eminent Victorians_, 
by Lytton Strachey.  First published 1918, and bloody damned marvellous.
</p>

<p>
The more you know about the stuffy, ponderous, windy, and empty-headed
<em>traditional</em> biographies to which Strachey's little volume was the
antidote, the more one enjoys it.  It's also very wickedly funny.
It's difficult to envision just how much its publication rocked Great
Britain, in part because we don't have anything like the quasi-religious
reverence for anyone that Strachey's four subjects enjoyed at that time
-- and Strachey managed to make clear, in about a hundred beautiful
pages that all four of them were utter sociopaths and lunatics, as by
implication was the society they sprang from, without even needing to
say so outright.

Hi, Aaron.  Just following up on my comments to Steven Biyayoff.
You wrote at <a href="http://www.oblogn.com/2007/08/10/quitting-osi/:">http://www.oblogn.com/2007/08/10/quitting-osi/:</a>

<pre>
&gt; To those who claim the CPAL is necessary because of a lack of an
&gt; Affero-like clause in GPLv3 I respond with: your concerns are only
&gt; well reasoned if your product or your engineering team is so inferior
&gt; such that you have no confidence in your ability to out-innovate a
&gt; competitor.
</pre>

<p>
To recap, I believe we're talking about my scenario:
</p>

<p>
  I imagined myself as an ethical Web 2.0 entrepreneur, one who <em>wished</em> to
  use and comply with copyleft, and see if I had a problem.  To my
  surprise, I found that the answer was "yes":  Such an entrepreneur who
  published code under, say, GPLv2 <em>or</em> GPLv3 would be relatively speaking
  at the mercy of less-ethical business competitors who hosted derivative
  works (of the ethical businessman's code) behind closed doors without
  needing to comply with any copyleft giveback provision, while still
  making the code fully usable by all of the less-ethical firm's
  customers, via network access.
</p>

<p>
  That code-reuse scenario renders the allegedly-copylefted code _in practice_
  BSD licensed -- i.e., de-facto forkable as a proprietary derivative
  work.  If the intent (of releasing under GPLv2 or GPLv3) is to require
  reciprocity from others, then the usage model defeats that intent.
</p>


<p>
Let me see if I'm correctly interpreting what is quoted from your Web 
page at the top (and, no, this isn't going to be sarcasm -- I'm honestly 
trying to get to the bottom of this issue):  Are you saying "So what if 
your competitors can deploy what amounts to a proprietary fork of your
code and use it in business against you, without sharing their changes
to the commons?  If you're any good at what you do, you can compete 
against even proprietary forkers."
</p>

<p>
If that's a fair paraphrase of your rejoinder to people who say the ASP
loophole is real, and that "GPLv2 or v3 provide sufficient protection
with copyleft and maximize the benefits and freedoms to the entire
market of users, developers, and companies", then, it seems to me,
you're saying that it's OK to (effectively) dispense with copyleft
in that usage scenario.  Your position then becomes de-facto the 
same as that of Chuck Swiger, Brian Behlendorf, and other BSD-licensing
advocates (as to the ASP / SaaS market).
</p>

<p>
I respect Chuck, Brian, and the BSD community.  I think their stance is
ethical and self-consistent.  At the same time, many other people <em>do</em>
think there is some point in having functional copyleft giveback
obligations in place, even as technology changes.
</p>

<p>
Concur, disagree, or am I missing something fundamental?
