<h1>Measuring TCP Congestion Windows</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

<p> <a href="../135/pfeiffer.html">Last month</a>, I introduced the various
TCP congestion control algorithms your Linux kernel knows about. I also
mentioned a method, using the kernel module <em>tcpprobe</em>, that allows
for measuring the parameters of live TCP connections. Unfortunately, this
module requires the presence of a debugging option in the kernel called
<em>kprobes</em>. By enabling this, you can dynamically break into any
kernel routine and collect debugging and performance information
non-disruptively. This sounded good on first impression - but I decided
that I don't wish to introduce kprobes on every machine I have; it's better
to run less code on servers. Besides, it is not a good idea to run
debugging code in kernels that shouldn't be used for debugging. I had to
look for other mechanisms. After rediscovering the man pages on my
GNU/Linux workstation at home, I found what I was looking for:
<tt>getsockopt()</tt> </p>

<h3>
Ask the kernel, stupid!
</h3>

<p>
The Linux kernel has internal data structures that keep track of active
TCP connections and their parameters. This is required, since most TCP
connections have a long lifetime (long being tens of seconds, minutes, or
even hours). The longer a connection lasts, the more changes on its path
can happen. Other TCP connections might throttle the up- or downlink.
The link might get disconnected, rerouted, or re-established. Packets
might be lost or reordered. All these things have an impact on the TCP
performance, and TCP usually reacts by changing its window size (among
other things we won't look at right now.) Inside an application that
owns a network socket with a live TCP connection, we can always request
the current TCP parameters. The man pages of <tt>getsockopt()</tt> and
<tt>tcp</tt> tell us how to do this - calling <tt>getsockopt()</tt> with
the <tt>TCP_INFO</tt> option fills a memory structure with information
described in <tt>struct tcp_info</tt>, which is defined in
<tt>/usr/include/netinet/tcp.h</tt>. That's great - just what we're looking
for! But how do we collect this information periodically while sending or
receiving data?  </p>

<h3>
Making up a strategy
</h3>

<p>
The man pages refer to C structures and C function calls. I did a lot of
C programming on my Amigas, so I decided to dust off my C skills. Since
the kernel is written in C, and the GNU C Library has everything prepared,
the way to get to our TCP parameters is straightforward.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Prepare a TCP socket by calling <tt>socket()</tt></li>
<li> Bind to a (high, unprivileged) port by using <tt>bind()</tt></li>
<li> Put the port into listen state by utilising <tt>listen()</tt></li>
<li> Wait for an incoming connection by taking advantage of <tt>accept()</tt></li>
<li> Accept <em>n</em> bytes of data by means of <tt>recv()</tt> from data socket</li>
<li> Write out the TCP parameters to a file</li>
<li> Repeat until sender stops sending</li>
<li> Close data socket and return to listening for new connections</li>
</ol>

<p>
Right. This sounds quite complete. By adjusting <em>n</em>, you can
determine how many samples you get. It doesn't make sense to take
multiple samples per TCP packet, which means that you should choose <em>n</em>
above the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) on your connection path. Besides,
if you send streams over the network that contain many megabytes (or
even gigabytes), you might want to reduce the sample rate anyway.  </p>

<p> We design our code so it can be used as a "TCP sink". We don't
want to store all the bytes we read from the network. We just need to
fill a buffer up to a maximum of <em>n</em> bytes, look at the TCP
parameters, and read the next <em>n</em> bytes. The only things we probably
want to save are the parameters. Everything else is fed to the bit
bucket.  </p>

<h3>
Walking through the steps
</h3>

<p>
Let's look at the steps of our strategy with more detail and some code.
I am going to describe the task "codewise", line by line. You will get a
complete sample of the source to play with, at the end.  First, we have to
prepare the socket. Then, we have to bind it to a local address.
Finally, we have to put the socket into the TCP LISTEN state.
</p>

<pre class="code">
tcp_socket = socket( PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP );
if ( tcp_socket == -1 ) {
/* Could not open socket. */
fprintf(stderr,"Could not open TCP socket: %s\n",strerror(errno));
exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
else {
/* Bind to any address on local machine */
server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
server_address.sin_port = htons(opt_port);
memset((void *)&amp;(server_address.sin_zero), '\0', 8);
status = bind( tcp_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;server_address, sizeof(server_address) );
if ( status == 0 ) {
	/* We can now listen for incoming connections. We only allow a backlog of one
	 * connection
	 */
	status = listen( tcp_socket, 1 );
	if ( status != 0 ) {
		/* Cannot listen on socket. */
		fprintf(stderr,"Cannot listen on socket: %s\n",strerror(errno));
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
}
else {
	/* Cannot bind to socket. */
	fprintf(stderr,"Cannot bind to socket: %s\n",strerror(errno));
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
}
</pre>

<p>
The call to <tt>socket()</tt> specifies that we'd like to have an Internet
(<tt>PF_INET</tt>) stream socket (<tt>SOCK_STREAM</tt>) that speaks TCP
(<tt>IPPROTO_TCP</tt>).  Provided the call succeeds, we prepare a data
structure named <tt>server_address</tt> of the type <tt>struct
sockaddr_in</tt>, which tells the kernel the address and the port to which
we wish to bind the socket. We choose all available addresses by using
<tt>INADDR_ANY</tt>, and we'd like to bind on the port stored in the
<tt>opt_port</tt> variable. (The full source handles the options; I left it
out in this piece of code.) Be careful when doing network programming!
Addresses and ports have a defined network and host byte order. This means
that certain bytes might need to be swapped - or not - before putting them
from the host side into network data structures and vice-versa. The
function <tt>htons()</tt> converts the unsigned short integer TCP port from
host byte order to network byte order. If you look up its man page, you
will see that there are other functions for byte order conversion.  </p>

<p>
Now we can call the <tt>bind()</tt> function. We need to provide the TCP
socket it should act on, and a pointer to a memory region of type
<tt>struct sockaddr</tt>, along with the length of the memory region.
<tt>server_address</tt> is the structure we filled for exactly these
purposes.  The function call may seem a bit complicated because of the
pointer and the size of the structure - but as long as we make sure that the
content of <tt>server_address</tt> is filled with correct values,
<tt>bind()</tt> won't choke on it.  </p>

<p> If the binding succeeds, we can put the socket into the listening
state.  This is done by a simple call to the <tt>listen()</tt> function.
When listening for connections, you can tell the kernel how many
connections it should keep in the queue for processing. As of kernel 2.2,
this queue consists of completely established sockets waiting to be
accepted. Since we don't need to deal with performance issues and multiple
connections, we choose 1; we'll let other people worry about the design of
a high-performance and multi-threaded TCP sink. After these three steps,
our code is ready to accept and process data streams.  </p>

<pre class="code">
client_length = sizeof(client_address);
tcp_work_socket = accept( tcp_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;client_address, &amp;client_length );
</pre>

<p>
The call to <tt>accept()</tt> makes our code wait until a connection is
received.  <tt>client_address</tt> is of the same type as
<tt>server_address</tt> was, earlier. It is a storage space for the address
of the client that is talking to us. <tt>accept()</tt> fills out the
details as soon as a client connects. In addition, the function returns
an identifier of the socket that holds the conversation with our client.
Keep in mind that our listening socket will always listen for incoming
connections! Every connection we accept creates a new socket; that's why
we use the variable <tt>tcp_work_socket</tt> for this. All we need to do
now is to read incoming data. (We could also write "to the other side"
and test bidirectional data flow, if we wanted to.)  </p>

<p> Our little strategy above missed (or implied, as a matter of
perspective) a crucial point. Sampling the TCP parameters is fine, but we
need to take another reference as well. We need something that says "we got
the parameters at a certain time or at a certain point".  This means we
have to measure the time elapsed since the connection started. We could use
the number of bytes received, but usually it is better to use the elapsed
time. Measuring time in C on various platforms deserves an article on its
own; fortunately we are bound to Linux (because we want to use the TCP_INFO
option of <tt>getsockopt()</tt>, and this is not portable), and can expect
to get time resolution in microseconds. In order to make time management
easier, we define two functions: <tt>get_now()</tt> and
<tt>time_to_seconds()</tt>.
</p>

<pre class="code">
/* Get current time. */
void get_now( struct timeval *time, unsigned short debug ) {
if ( gettimeofday( time, NULL ) != 0 ) {
	fprintf(stderr,"Can't get current time.\n");
}
return;
}

/* Convert "struct timeval" to fractional seconds. */
double time_to_seconds ( struct timeval *tstart, struct timeval *tfinish ) {
double t;

t = (tfinish-&gt;tv_sec - tstart-&gt;tv_sec) + (tfinish-&gt;tv_usec - tstart-&gt;tv_usec) / 1e6;
return t;
}
</pre>

<p>
<tt>get_now()</tt> is our stopwatch button, and retrieves the current
time by calling <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> and storing it into a memory
structure. The second function <tt>time_to_seconds()</tt> calculates the
difference of two time value structures, and converts it into fractional
seconds. We have to do that ourselves, since the GNU C Library doesn't
provide any functions to do fancy date and time calculations. Other
libraries could help us out, but I'd like to stick to basic methods and
basic tools. We have other things to do in our code than to worry about
fancy functions. You may have noticed the slightly unused function
parameter <tt>debug</tt> in <tt>get_now()</tt>. I'll explain later what
it is for (it's a feature, not a bug).  </p>

<p>
Now, we start our main loop. We take the time, read the stream buffer by
buffer, query the socket and write the parameters to a file. Here's the
code.
</p>

<pre class="code">
get_now( &amp;time_start, opt_debug );
while ( (recv_bytes = recv( tcp_work_socket, tcp_buffer, opt_buffer, 0 ) ) &gt; 0 ) {
/* Measure time in order to create time intervals. */
get_now( &amp;time_now, opt_debug );
/* Fill tcp_info structure with data */
tcp_info_length = sizeof(tcp_info);
if ( getsockopt( tcp_work_socket, SOL_TCP, TCP_INFO, (void *)&amp;tcp_info, &amp;tcp_info_length ) == 0 ) {
	fprintf(statistics,"%.6f %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u\n",
			time_to_seconds( &amp;time_start, &amp;time_now ),
			tcp_info.tcpi_last_data_sent,
			tcp_info.tcpi_last_data_recv,
			tcp_info.tcpi_snd_cwnd,
			tcp_info.tcpi_snd_ssthresh,
			tcp_info.tcpi_rcv_ssthresh,
			tcp_info.tcpi_rtt,
			tcp_info.tcpi_rttvar,
			tcp_info.tcpi_unacked,
			tcp_info.tcpi_sacked,
			tcp_info.tcpi_lost,
			tcp_info.tcpi_retrans,
			tcp_info.tcpi_fackets
		   );
	if ( fflush(statistics) != 0 ) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Cannot flush buffers: %s\n", strerror(errno) );
	}
}
}
close(tcp_work_socket);
</pre>

<p>
First, we take the time to mark the start of the transmission. It gets
stored in <tt>time_start</tt>, which we use later for calculating
relative time. The <tt>while</tt> loop is our main loop. We call
<tt>recv()</tt>, and fill our buffer <tt>tcp_buffer</tt> with a maximum
of <tt>opt_buffer</tt> bytes. After the buffer is full, we take the time
again. Finally, we call the function <tt>getsockopt()</tt> and request
that a memory region of type <tt>struct tcp_info</tt> be filled with
parameter data from the live stream. The function works in a fashion
similar to that of <tt>bind()</tt>. You have to have a piece of memory
ready, indicate its size, give a request code (such as
<tt>TCP_INFO</tt>), and <tt>getsockopt()</tt> will copy everything to the
memory region indicated by the supplied pointer. If the function returns
success, we can access the values in <tt>tcp_info</tt>.  You can look up
the content of a <tt>struct tcp_info</tt> structure by viewing
<tt>/usr/include/netinet/tcp.h</tt>. For your convenience, I have a copy
of the definition right here:
</p>

<pre class="code">
struct tcp_info
{
u_int8_t	tcpi_state;
u_int8_t	tcpi_ca_state;
u_int8_t	tcpi_retransmits;

u_int32_t	tcpi_last_data_recv;
u_int32_t	tcpi_last_ack_recv;

u_int32_t	tcpi_pmtu;

u_int32_t	tcpi_snd_cwnd;
u_int32_t	tcpi_advmss;
u_int32_t	tcpi_reordering;
};
</pre>

<p>
The first part consists of administrative information such as state,
retransmits, keepalive probes, and options. There's more, and I went
through the Linux kernel code to discover where the values come from and
what they mean. The best documentation you can get is to look at your
kernel's source at <tt>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/net/ipv4/tcp.c</tt>
and see how the <tt>tcp_info</tt> is filled. Look for the
<tt>tcp_get_info()</tt> function inside, and look up the definition of
<tt>struct tcp_sock</tt> in <tt>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/net/tcp.h</tt>. Most of the data is copied from this
structure.  Fortunately, we don't need everything. The main objective is
to get the congestion window.  If you look at the metrics section, you
can see some interesting values. <tt>tcpi_rtt</tt> and
<tt>tcpi_rttvar</tt> are the Round Trip Time (RTT), and its smoothed mean
deviation maximum measured in microseconds. The values
<tt>tcpi_rcv_ssthresh</tt> and <tt>tcpi_snd_ssthresh</tt> are the slow
start size threshold for sending and receiving. Both can be changed
dynamically during transmission and reception of data, and put limits on
the window sizes.  <tt>tcpi_snd_cwnd</tt> is the sending congestion
window. <tt>tcpi_advmss</tt> is the advertised Maximum Segment Size
(MSS). <tt>tcpi_reordering</tt> indicates the amount of reordering. 
(I didn't quite figure out the units and values used to indicate
reordering, but I found that RFC 4737 defines a packet reordering
metric; maybe it has something to do with it.)  </p>

<p>
We have to keep in mind that TCP can be used to transport data
bidirectionally. Our TCP sink will only receive data. In this case, we
should expect that only a part of the parameters will change. The values
we want to extract are written to a file descriptor <tt>statistics</tt>
by a call to <tt>fprintf()</tt>. The format string and the list of
arguments defines what will be written to the statistics log file. You
can select whatever values you want, and have a look at the output when
shooting streams at our sink.  </p>

<h3>
The whole source
</h3>

<p> The whole source is a bit longer, since I wanted to build a daemon that
listens on a socket, receives data, and adds all extracted statistics to a
log file. It marks the start and the end of data connections, so that it is
easier to parse the log and plot the results. I also added option parsing,
which is better suited for changing port number, filename, and the like.
The daemon has an option for the debug level as well: if the debug level is
greater than 0, the daemon doesn't fork and prints debug messages to
<tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> in case something goes wrong. You can
download the source <a href="misc/pfeiffer/tcpsnoop.c">tcpsnoop.c</a>, a
little header file <a href="misc/pfeiffer/tcpsnoop.h">tcpsnoop.h</a> and a
minimalistic <a href="misc/pfeiffer/Makefile">Makefile</a>. All you need is
the GNU C Compiler and the <tt>make</tt> utility. After you have compiled
the code (running <tt>make</tt> in the directory where you save the above
files should do the trick), the binary's options are as follows.
</p>

<pre>
luchs@nightfall:~$ ./tcpsnoop -h
Usage: tcpsnoop [-d] [-D debuglevel] [-f filename] [-h] [-p tcpport] [-b buffersize]
luchs@nightfall:~$ 
</pre>

<p>
The presence of <tt>-d</tt> tells the program to enter daemon mode.
<tt>-D</tt> sets the debug level.  Setting a debug level will
automatically disable daemon mode. <tt>-f</tt> lets you define a file to
write to. <tt>-p</tt> determines the TCP port (default is 42237, can be
changed by editing <tt>tcpsnoop.h</tt>). <tt>-b</tt> sets the size of
the buffer (defaults to 1500 bytes). Daemon mode can be exited by
sending a signal. My signal handlers could probably look a lot better,
but feel free to turn the sample code into a mean and efficient piece of
software.  </p>

<h3>
Test driving
</h3>

<p>
Now let's see if it works or segfaults. We can test the program by using
127.0.0.1. This is a bit of a boring experience, since we have big
bandwidth and minimal RTT. You'll see that the threshold for the
receiving window will skyrocket very quickly. Anyway, we need a listener
process.  We issue the following command on the receiver:
</p>

<pre>
luchs@receiver:~$ ./tcpsnoop -d -f /tmp/logfile.dat -p 23000 -b 4096
</pre>

<p>
We listen on port 23000 for incoming connections, and write every 4096
bytes a line with the parameters of the connection to the file
<tt>logfile.dat</tt>. Note that <tt>tcpsnoop</tt> always appends data,
so you won't overwrite old data.  </p>

<p>
On the sender's side, you need a simple tool that pipes data to a TCP
socket. A combination of <tt>cat</tt>, a suitable file, and
<tt>netcat</tt> will do nicely. 
</p>

<pre>
luchs@sender:~$ cat big_file.pdf | nc receiver.example.net -w 5 23000
</pre>

<p>
A file is piped to <tt>netcat</tt>, which in turn connects to our
receiver on port 23000 and delivers the data. The option <tt>-w</tt>
sets a timeout for the connection. <tt>netcat</tt> stops reading after 5
seconds. (Remember, TCP is bidirectional, leaving <tt>-w</tt> out would
make <tt>netcat</tt> wait longer for data coming from the receiver.)
Make sure your disk is faster than your network, or preload the file. We
want to look at network performance, not at slow disks. While the stream
is running our code writes the parameters of the connection to the log
file.  The logged data should look similar to this:
</p>

<p>
As you can see, only the receiving slow start threshold is changing. You
can now use any tool you want, in order to display the data in another
format. I used <tt>gnuplot</tt> to create two diagrams.  Both show the
transmission of a 7.5 MB PDF file through a VPN tunnel over a 512
kbit/s line with 20ms latency. Just to see if it makes any difference, I
used three congestions algorithms on the sender side (Low Priority, Veno
and Westwood+). I did one transfer per algorithm, one without traffic on
the link, and one while surfing with my browser on multiple news pages.
The graphs are marked with <em>noconcurrent</em> and
<em>browserbackground</em>, respectively.<br> <img border="0"

height="566" alt="graph2" /><br> <strong>Caution!</strong> These graphs carry no
meaning. They just say that uploading something while a link is utilised
takes longer than on a link without any load. They also say that
inserting different congestion algorithm modules into the kernel leads
to different behaviour. We already knew that. The sole purpose of this
data is to test drive the code we just wrote, nothing more, nothing
less. So the only valid interpretation is "It works!" (or "It seems to
work!" if you believe in bugs). Hooray!  </p>

<p>
You might wish to issue 
</p>

<pre>
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_no_metrics_save
</pre>

<p>
on both machines to prevent the kernel from storing metric information
between different TCP sessions.  This is useful for repeated tests from
the same IP addresses.  </p>

<h3>
Conclusions
</h3>

<p>
I wrote this article as a follow up to my overview of the different
Linux TCP congestions algorithm modules. My only intention was to find
out what these algorithms are for and what they do. The outcome was much
more than I expected. Data transmissions over networks create a wealth
of aspects regarding performance and reliability. I am amazed by the
efforts the kernel developers put into the code of the Linux TCP state
machine. Few people notice this, when they run their servers and
workstations with default values that just work because of all the
things that were put into the kernel code. I hope that you have more
than enough starting points to read about what I presented.  You also
have some pre-alpha code to play with. Now that we have a TCP sink, we
could code the sender's side as well, and record the real congestion
window and the sender's threshold. We will do that, but that's a job for
one of the next issues of <em>Linux Gazette</em>.  </p>

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.
