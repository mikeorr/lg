<P>The Linux Counter is a serious attempt
to count users in the Linux universe. 
At the moment, more than 53.000 people are registered with the
counter, coming from more than 130 different countries.
The counter has been recently updated and given a new Web interface
and forms design, and is now able to give you the ultimate Linux
counter gimmick: The Linux REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE!
This little GIF image, with your personal registration number on it,
ready for insertion in your Web page, is available for you at the price
of filling out the registration form.
Older, registered users can go to <a

Help with JWP
</H3> 
<P> 

<P>There is a Windows application, called JWP -- a Japanese Word Processor.  
This package was written by Stephen Chung, and as a GNU product it is freely
distributable.  
JWP comes with its own fonts and its own Front End Processor (FEP)  which
means it is useful on English-only computing systems.  It is also
integrated with Jim Breen's EDICT Japanese-English dictionary.
Unfortunately, JWP is only available for Windows right now, which is
locking out a lot of people under other platforms who might benefit from
it.  As Stephen is quite busy with full-time work and maintaining the
Windows versions (he's developing version 2.00 now), there is an attempt
being made to go ahead and port to X-Windows.

<P>This project will never get off the ground without volunteers.
any interested X-Windows developer who wants to make
a contribution both to the GNU and Japanese-speaking communities is invited 
lend a hand with this exciting project.  

<P>The JWP-Port Project home page contains more information on the JWP
package as well as the JWP-Port project itself.  If you are interested,
please visit the page at <a

86Open Project
</H3> 
<P> 


<P>A group which includes some of the key developers of Unix operating
systems on Intel architecture computers have agreed to work on a
common programming and binary interface.
At a meeting held mid-August at the head office of SCO, participants
achieved consensus on a way to create software applications which would
run, without modification or emulation, on the Intel-based versions of:
<ul>
<li>BSDI
<li>FreeBSD
<li>Linux
<li>NetBSD
<li>SCO OpenServer
<li>Sunsoft SolarisX86
<li>SCO UnixWare
</ul>
<P>The goal of this effort is to encourage software developers to port
to the Unix-Intel platform by reducing the effort needed to support
the diverse mix of operating systems of this kind currently available.
The specification, called "86open", will be published and freely
available to any environment wishing compliance. It involves the use of a
standardized 'libc' shared library of basic functions to be provided on
all systems. This library will provide a consistent interface to
programmers, hiding the differences between the various operating systems
and allowing the resulting binary programs to run unaltered on any
compliant system. Whenever possible, it will be consistent with The
Open Group's Single Unix Specification.

<P>Each participating operating system will be free to implement the 86open
library specification on its own. However, the reference implementation
will be based upon GNU's 'glibc' version 2, ensuring that it will remain
open and freely available. The actual list and behavior of the 86open
functions is presently being determined.

<P>Participants in the meeting, who will be involved with the ongoing
evolution of the 86open specification, include people deeply involved
with the operating systems mentioned in this project. The 86open
steering committee, a core of this group which will assemble
the work and produce the final specification, comprises:
Marc Ewing, Dion Johnson, Evan Leibovitch, Bruce Perens,
Andrew Roach, Bryan Sparks and Linus Torvalds

<P>For more information, contact <a href="mailto:86open@telly.org">

</UL>

<P>Clobberd is a user/resource regulator that allows Operators to monitor and
track users Total Time, Daily Time, Expiration time, Total network usage
and Daily network usage (to name a few) in an effort to limit or cost
resources that the user uses. Clobberd effectively "meters"  resources,
and compares them to any limits/conditions you impose.
The third version now has the ability to monitor users on a network rather
than a single host.

Corel Video Network Computer News
</H3>
<P> 

When Corel Computer Corp. formally unveils its Video Network
Computer later this month, the machine will be running Linux, an
operating system that is becoming an increasingly prominent force in
workstations linked to corporate intranets.
<p>
Linux is a compact, efficient, easier-to-use and free version of
Unix. A growing number of corporate MIS groups, as well as software
developers and systems integrators, are choosing Linux over 32-bit
Windows platforms, especially for Internet applications. At some
sites, Linux actually is displacing Windows.
<p>
That is what happened at Unique Systems, Inc., a software developer in
Sylvania, Ohio. The company, which puts together accounting systems
for small and midsize companies, was using Microsoft Corp.'s Office 95
internally but was plagued by software crashes and other problems. "It
really irked me," Unique President Glenn Jackson said.
<p>
The company tested Applix, Inc.'s ApplixWare office suite on Intel
Corp. computers running Linux. Users got nearly all the functionality
of Microsoft Office and were able to import all Office files easily
into ApplixWare - at much lower cost and with far greater reliability
than with Office, Jackson said.
<p>
"Linux is the true competitor to Windows NT in the long term," said
Dave Madden, senior product manager at Corel Computer, a subsidiary of
Corel Corp., based here.
<p>
Linux has a number of key features NT lacks. For example, Linux is a
multiuser system and runs on a wide range of processors _ from Intel
386 to 64-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computing chips _ and on
multiprocessor computers. The Linux kernel is less than 2M bytes.
<p>
Linux has other key attractions, according to Jon Hall, executive
director of Linux International, a trade group that promotes the
software. Linux is free, and users have access to all the Linux source
code, which means they can make whatever changes they need.
Commercial Linux versions from companies such as Caldera, Inc., of
Provo, Utah, and Red Hat Software, Inc., of Research Triangle Park,
N.C., range from $49.95 to $399 and usually come with additional
software and technical support.
<p>
The free version of Linux is crammed with utilities and connectivity
software. "One of the things that makes Linux so attractive is how
much software you get with it," said Dave Parker, a senior software
engineer at Frontier Information Technologies, a division of Frontier
Corp., a Rochester, N.Y., telecommunications company. "Linux will
connect to anything."
<p>
Much of the free software is available under the "GNU public license,"
which is administered by the Free Software Foundation.
<p>
For example, TCP/IP and a Web server are built in, and Linux can run
DOS applications. It includes X.11 support, so it can host or access
Unix applications.
<p>
Linux supports the Microsoft Server Message Block protocol, so it can
serve Windows files.
<p>
It also supports AppleTalk for Macintoshes. Using optional software,
it can even run Windows applications. Cal-dera's commercial OpenLinux
adds Novell, Inc. NetWare connectivity.
<p>
Frontier Information Technologies' Green Bay, Wis., site is using
several Caldera Open- Linux servers as specialized gateways, directory
or naming servers and firewalls.
<p>
This seems to be an increasingly common practice at big corporate
sites, said Dan Kusnetzky, director of operating system research at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
<p>
Unknown to senior MIS executives, operations staff are deploying Linux
servers in a range of intranet applications, he said.
