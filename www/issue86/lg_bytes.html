</FONT>
</H3> 
The first criminal trial under the 
<a
href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/hr2281_dmca_law_19981020_pl105-304.html">
Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a>
(DMCA) has resulted in a 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/28612.html">
not-guilty verdict</a>.  The history of this case goes
back to July 2001, when a soon to be famous Russian programmer by the name
of Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested while attending Defcon in Las Vegas.  He
had come to the attention of the authorities through his work for software
company ElcomSoft on a computer
program capable of removing copy protection on documents created
using the Adobe ebook format.  Sklyarov's presentation at Defcon was on the
subject of the weak protections offered by this ebook format
<P>
Dmitry's incarceration was to last 3 weeks, subsequent to which he was
required to remain in the United States for a further 6 months while
various legal details were hammered out.  The result was that Dmitry would
not have to face prosecution.
Instead his employer, <a href="http://www.elcomsoft.com/">ElcomSoft</a>,
would have to face the charges, and Dmitry would be obliged to return to
the US to testify in the trial.  
In the course of these events, widespread public opinion was sympathetic to
Dmitry's plight, and this was likely a factor in Adobe's distancing itself
from the case.   Notwithstanding this, Adobe is still (as reported by The
Register) a
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/28654.html">
strong supporter</a>
of the DMCA, and advocates further criminal prosecutions.
<P>
In the intervening period leading up to the current trial, unsuccessful
attempts were made to pre-emptively stop the prosecution based on
challenges to the constitutionality of the DMCA law.  These arguments were
based on assertions of the right to free speech (including the rights of
third parties to fair use of copyright materials), and also on a
claim that the law was so vague as to be unconstitutional.
Judge Ronald Whyte 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/sc/sklyarov/20020508_dismiss_deny_order.html">
dismissed these motions</a> in May 2002.  Although the Judge accepted that
computer code was free speech, he asserted that the DMCA was content
neutral and thus dealt with computer programs on the basis of its
<em>purpose</em>, rather than its <em>content</em>.  He also decided that
no fair use was prohibited by the DMCA, while acknowledging that many uses
may be made substantially more difficult.   Whyte also ruled that the law
was sufficiently precise to be constitutional.
This decision is a significant victory for the DMCA supporters, as was
noted by Lewis Clayton in his 
<a href="http://www.law.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/View&c=LawArticle&cid=1039054489470&t=LawArticleIP">
review of IP cases in 2002</a>, and strengthens the legitimacy of the law.
<P>
Following some difficulties with visas and the US State Department, Dmitry
and Alex Katalov (chief executive of ElcomSoft) 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/28352.html">
finally travelled to California</a>
in December 2002 for the trial.  Some transcripts from the trial have been
made <a href="http://cryptome.org/usa-v-elcom-dt.htm"> available
online</a>.  Additionally, Lisa Rein has done a good job of 
<a href="http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/us_vs_elcomsoft_my_trial_coverage/">
reporting on the court proceedings</a>.  A significant point on which the
trial hinged was whether ElcomSoft <em>wilfully</em> broke the law.  It
was the jury's opinion that while ElcomSoft's product may have violated the
DMCA, they did not distribute it while aware of this infringement.  The
open manner in which the product was distributed contributed to this image.
The jury is also reported as 
<a href="http://www.onlisareinsradar.com/archives/us_vs_elcomsoft_others_trial_coverage/">
having difficulties</a>
with the severe curtailment of users' rights inherent in the application of
the DMCA to the ebook format.
<P> 
The consequences of the verdict are unclear.  Don Marti believes it is a
<a href="http://www.ssc.com/pipermail/atc/2002-December/000029.html">
hugely positive development</a>, and that Federal prosecutors will be slow
to attempt another DMCA criminal case given the failure of the ElcomSoft
prosecution.  Linux Weekly News is 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/18304/">
less upbeat</a>, and sees this primarily as a victory for ElcomSoft.  The
point is made that it has now been shown that the DMCA can lead to
"expensive criminal trials and arrests, even if they win in the end".  This
is only partly true, since as Don points out, the Federal authorities will
only prosecute cases they believe can be won, and the ElcomSoft verdict
raises the standard of evidence required to justify such an opinion.
However, the civil-law provisions of the DMCA can also be used to cripple
smaller companies with the burden of an expensive DMCA defence, and it is
at the discretion of the complainant if and when to bring such cases.

<FONT COLOR="green">DVD Jon
</FONT>
</H3> 
<P>
Jon Johansen is another young man who 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/DeCSS_prosecutions/Johansen_DeCSS_case/20021206_eff_pr.html">
has found himself in court</a>
in the past month as a consequence of his involvement in software
development.  Jon's case began three years ago, when the young Norwegian
participated in the development of the DeCSS program.  The purpose of DeCSS
was to allow playback of DVD movies on systems, such as Linux, which lacked
DVD playback software.  Though Johansen has been strongly associated with
the DeCSS software, 
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-2000-01/lw-01-dvd-interview.html">he is keen to point out</a>
that he was only a 
<a href="http://www.free-dvd.org.lu/css-chain-of-events.txt">minor collaborator</a>
in its development.  However, the other collaborators in the project have
remained anonymous, leaving Johansen 
<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=451580">facing criminal charges</a>
in a Norwegian court.
<P>
Though Jon could have faced up to 2 years in jail, the prosecution has
sought a sentence of 
<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=456698">3 months probation</a>
along with
<a href="http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/3658.cfm">
payment of US$1400 court fees and confiscation of his computers</a>
should he be found guilty.  Jon has strongly 
<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=452751">defended his innocence</a>.
<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=452976">Prosecution questioning</a> appears to have
<a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article.jhtml?articleID=453595">focused</a> on the possible use of DeCSS for DVD piracy.  Johansen has
argued that although DeCSS could possibly be used in some forms of piracy,
piracy is entirely possible and quite easy even without DeCSS.  The primary
purpose of DeCSS is the playback of DVDs that customers have legally
purchased.  A verdict is expected early in January 2003.
<P>
It is worth putting this case in the context of other cases which have been
taken in the US to suppress DeCSS.  Cryptome has a 
<a href="http://cryptome.org/mpaa-v-decss.htm">
large number</a> of documents relating to these cases, 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/DeCSS_prosecutions/">
as does the EFF</a>.  Of particular interest is
Jon Johansen's 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/MPAA_DVD_cases/20000720_ny_trial_transcript.html">
testimony</a>
in the New York DeCSS trial, where he gives much of the background to these
cases.  Though Jon's trial relates to the actual development of the
software and breaking protection on a DVD, in the case of the NY trial the
issue concerned the legality of simply linking to DeCSS on the internet.
Many have objected strongly to these draconian prosecutions, and have
ridiculed the law by finding novel, clever or humorous ways to
<a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/index.html">
distribute DeCSS</a>.  An example is Phil Carmody's 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/21591.html">
publication of a prime number</a>
which is also, neatly, a valid DeCSS executable.  This follows from his
<a href="http://asdf.org/~fatphil/maths/illegal1.html">
first "illegal" prime</a> which contains the DeCSS source code.

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/28573.html">
The DMCA has also found use</a>
in efforts to silence
a group of satirical impostors, known as
<a href="http://theyesmen.org/">
The Yes Men</a>. 
A parody website, which was located at www.dow-chemical.com, was
constructed to draw attention to the 18 year legacy of the Union Carbide
chemical disaster in Bhopal, India which killed 20,000 people.  
Union Carbide is now a part of the larger Dow company.
On the 18th anniversary of the tragedy, a hoax press release was issued,
purporting to be from Dow and addressing why Dow was unable to accept
responsibility for the injuries and deaths.
<blockquote>
    "We understand the anger and hurt," said Dow Spokesperson Bob Questra.
    "But Dow does not and cannot acknowledge responsibility. If we did, not
    only would we be required to expend many billions of dollars on cleanup
    and compensation--much worse, the public could then point to Dow as a
    precedent in other big cases."
</blockquote>
<P>
Dow's reaction was one of anger, and 
<a href="http://theyesmen.org/dow/Dow-Chemical_DMCAnotice.pdf">a letter</a>
was sent to the site's upstream provider verio.com requiring the removal of
the website.  This communication served notice of a violation of the DMCA
(the parody used logos and designs from the original Dow website),
and this effectively obliged Verio to take immediate action.  Verio withdrew
service to Thing.net, the New York activist oriented ISP hosting The Yes
Men's site.  This action simultaneously took down a range of unrelated arts
based websites.  Subsequently, Verio has served notice that Thing.net must
relocate to another provider 
<a href="http://rtmark.com/thingpr.html">within 60 days</a>, after which
point service will be terminated.
<P>
As well as intimidating the service providers, Dow succeeded in taking
control of the www.dow-chemical.com domain name (which it turns out they
owned, as it was registered by the pranksters in the name of James Parker,
son of the Dow CEO).  Nevertheless, the website can be viewed at numerous
mirrors.
A list of current mirrors can be found in
<a href="http://theyesmen.org/dow/">
The Yes Men's account of events</a>.  The original press release is also
included.

The new Linux portal

of the Linux operating system a convenient search engine for rpm packages.
The packages can be searched by various criterions, such as package name,
file name, distribution, keywords, dependencies or files that a package
contains.  Dependecies between packages are resolved by cross references.
<P>
For every rpm package there are numerous detailed informations collected,
links to different mirror servers are listed for the download in
geographically arranged order.  Another highlight is the classification of
all rpm packages into categories. This way, a special software type or
functionality can be found by browsing the tree structure of the
categories.  The site also aims to offer a range of documentation and
discussion groups.

a PhD thesis in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University
College Dublin.  The topic of this work is the use of Lamb waves in
nondestructive testing.  GNU/Linux has been very useful in this work, and
Michael has a strong interest in applying free software solutions to
other problems in engineering.  When his thesis is completed, Michael
plans to take a long walk.
