<h1>Installing Gentoo</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/orr.html">Mike Orr (Sluggo)</A></b></p>

<p>
<P> As I said in the #102 <A HREF="../102/lg_mail.html#gaz.1">Mailbag</A>, I've
been wanting to try <A HREF="http://gentoo.org/">Gentoo</A>.  I hesitated to
install it because I knew it would take three days since you have to compile
your own software, and I assumed I would have lots of compilation errors to
troubleshoot.  But four of my friends have been running it at their workplaces
and say they rarely get compilation errors  -- <EM>mirable dictu</EM>.  Three
of them are solidly convinced for Gentoo; the other is a little tired of having
to wait for a package to compile.  But everyone says you just run "<TT>emerge
PACKAGE</TT>" in a shell window and leave it alone, and 90% of the time you end
up with a flawlessly installed package.  No mess, no fuss, just pure impact.
The way Unix was meant to be.  This article describes my experience installing
Gentoo, some things I learned along the way, and describes the Gentoo features
I found the most interesting.

<H2>Portage and USE flags</H2>

<P> Gentoo brings the concept of BSD ports to Linux.  Most Linux distros
consist of precompiled binary packages in <STRONG>.rpm</STRONG> or
<STRONG>.deb</STRONG> format.  Gentoo consists of text configuration files
("ebuilds") that tell the package manager where to download the upstream
source from, which  patches to apply, and how to compile and install it.  The
package manager is called Portage (anchors away!), and its command-line tool
is <TT>emerge</TT>. Of course, Debian and Red Hat have similar configuration
files, otherwise how could the developers maintain the packages?  And
<TT>emerge</TT> does have the ability to install a precompiled package.  So the
difference between them is less about capability than about cultural emphasis
-- and  about whether the distros carry binary packages on their mirrors.
Gentoo is not the first "compile your own" distro; I installed <A
HREF="http://www.rocklinux.org/">Rock Linux</A> a couple years ago.  But Gentoo
has enough documentation and support now for me to actually use it as my
desktop, and Rock didn't at the time.

<P> The appeal of compiling software is not to be studly and say I
did, but to eliminate a layer of potential problems.  Compile-it-yourself
distributions usually leave packages close to the upstream's default,
compared with the heavy tweaking in some other distros.  Debian's build process
is so complicated you often get packages in the Unstable distribution that
depend on themselves or on something that's not available.  Fixing those
requires you to second guess both the upstream developer and the package
maintainer -- at which point it's often easier just to do a <tt>/usr/local/</tt>
install.  Unless it's a library that other stuff depends on; then you have to
deal with dependencies again.  Or install <EM>those</EM> things locally too.    

<P> Speaking of dependencies, one of Portage's novel features is USE flags. USE 
flags are direction from the local sysadmin (me and you) to the package manager 
about how to handle optional dependencies.  This doesn't affect mandatory dependencies (e.g.,
the GIMP needs Gtk to run), but many programs come with extra utilities or
front ends or libraries that depend on third-party stuff, even though the
program as a whole does not depend on them.

<P>For instance, a non-interactive
daemon may come with a Gnome configuration dialog.  Say you hate Gnome and
don't want any gnomy things on your system.  Other distributions don't have
optional dependencies so they have to split the program into 'software' and
'software-gnome' packages. But Gentoo allows you to set a variable in
<STRONG>/etc/make.conf</STRONG> specifying which optional stuff you want.  For
instance, <PRE>USE="kde -gnome qt gtk gtk2 -crypt"</PRE> tells Portage not to
install any optional components that require Gnome or encryption dependencies,
but to install any other Gtk extensions.  "gtk2" means we prefer the Gtk2
library over Gtk1 if the program can be built either way. And you'll want "mysql" in 
your USE string if you want to build Postfix with the ability to access MySQL tables for
virtual users, domains, and the like.

<P> Now say you want to install <TT>links</TT> but you haven't installed X yet.
That's a problem because <TT>links</TT> has X11 extensions, and since the "X"
USE flag is on by default, "<TT>emerge links</TT>" will install all of X if you
don't watch what you're doing.  So you set an environment variable to override
the USE flag this one time: <PRE>USE="-X" emerge links</PRE> Later, after
you've installed X, you simply "<TT>emerge links</TT>" again, and it will
rebuild itself with the X support.

<H2>Compiling to the target CPU</H2>

<P>Also in <STRONG>/etc/make.conf</STRONG> is the variable  you configure to 
instruct Gentoo to build packages to match and make use of the advanced capabilities 
of your processor. There's a line that starts "CFLAGS =", that's  where the work is done. 
There are a couple of decent examples right there in the make.conf file, and 
<a href="http://www.freehackers.org/gentoo/gccflags/">a whole sub-web devoted to 
configuring good CFLAGS settings</a> over at Freehackers.org. The settings 
recommended there for my first two Gentoo machines are:

<UL>
<LI>at work (P3): <CODE>CFLAGS="-march=pentium3 -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"</CODE>
<LI>at home (AMD K6): <CODE>CFLAGS="-march=k6 -O3 -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer"</CODE>
</UL>

<H2>Installing the beast</H2>

<P> The first thing I did was to print out the the ninety-page <A
HREF="http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=0&chap=0">
<I>Gentoo Linux/x86 Handbook</I></A> and read it several times.  The Handbook
does a good job of predicting what issues you might be concerned about at each
step.  Gentoo 2004.2 had just come out, but my CD was 2004.1.  But the
website reassured me that after "<TT>emerge system</TT>" I would be completely
up to date, so I decided to go with the install that had worked on my friend's
machine.

<P> But first I had to shrink my NT partition.  This was a work computer so I
couldn't just get rid of Windows completely.  I borrowed PartitionMagic but the
version was too old to deal with the current NTFS partitions.  I googled and
found <A
HREF="http://mlf.linux.rulez.org/mlf/ezaz/ntfsresize.html#static">ntfsresize</A>.
It's a bit scary though because ntfsresize <EM>only</EM> shrinks the
filesystem; you then have to <EM>delete the partition</EM> with fdisk and
recreate it with the new size.  There's also an ominous warning about getting
the cylinder numbers right: if you make the NTFS partition too small, Windows
wouldn't boot.  I googled some more and found qtParted, a graphical
program that handles both parts.  Then I found a <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/systemrescuecd/">System Rescue CD</A>
that includes qtParted.  I figured a rescue disk is always a good thing to have
on hand anyway, and I was doubly impressed that it's Gentoo based.  The Gentoo
install disk is also a rescue CD, but this one has better hardware support and
a wider selection of utilities.  I availed myself of the hardware detection
by watching the boot messages to see which drivers I'd need.  Then I ran
qtParted without a hitch, created my Linux partitions, and began the install.
I wrote down every command I issued in case I had to do it again.

<P> I opted for a stage 3 install, meaning I unpacked a tarball that
contains a text-based developer's environment with the standard gcc tools
precompiled (and Python, which Portage uses internally).  If I wanted to be
studlier I could have started at stage 1 where you do absolutely everything
from scratch: first compiling a bootstrapper, then gcc, etc.  But I didn't
want to spend an extra day doing that.

<P> The CD contained the following stage tarballs:

<PRE>
% ls /mnt/cdrom/stages
stage1-x86-2004.1.tar.bz2        stage3-pentium3-2004.1.tar.bz2
stage3-athlon-xp-2004.1.tar.bz2  stage3-pentium4-2004.1.tar.bz2
stage3-i686-2004.1.tar.bz2       stage3-x86-2004.1.tar.bz2
</PRE>

The computer is a Pentium III at 1 GHz so it was an obvious choice.  But it
took me quite a while to figure out which tarball to choose for my home
computer (AMD K6 Duron at 450 MHz), and there was no compatibility list.
I set it up as i686, then read somewhere on the Gentoo site that AMD Durons
are i586, and since there wasn't a tarball for that I had to reluctantly
re-set it up with the x86 tarball.  But I haven't had the time to actually
boot it and finish the install.

<P> The biggest thing I was concerned about on the Pentium III was the nVidia
video chip.  The Answer Gang is constantly getting questions from people who
have this chip and can't get their video to work, and you have to go to the
nVidia site, find, download and install the politically incorrect binary-only
kernel driver.  But here I just ran "<TT>emerge nvidia-kernel</TT>" as the
Handbook said and it worked.  However, after I updated to the current ebuilds,
nvidia-kernel would no longer compile. That's OK though because the old one is
still working.

<P> You have a choice of four kernel sources; I chose 2.6.5 with the Gentoo
tweaks.  You then have a choice to compile it manually or with genkernel.
Genkernel creates a kernel with an initrd that does the same hardware
detection as the install disk.  I tried that first but for some reason it
wouldn't create the initrd file.  I f*cked around with it for a while and
finally just built my own kernel, which went without a hitch.  Grub also
installed itself smoothly.  

<P> Gentoo comes with an initial set of binary packages so you can install KDE
and OpenOffice without huge downloads, 1.5 GB free disk space, and an extra day
to compile.  But I didn't have the disk with those packages, so I just
"<TT>emerge sync</TT>"'d to get the current set of ebuilds and let it run
overnight.  One night to update the existing installed packages ("<TT>emerge
world</TT>"), and one night for X.  I <EM>was</EM> going to be studly about
that and install <A HREF="http://www.x.org/">X.org</A> instead of xfree86.
That went OK although the graphical configurator wouldn't work with my system
so I had to use the text configurator.  

<H2>The screamer</H2>

<P> A week after I finished that, my boss told me I was getting a new
computer.  It's a screamin' Pentium IV black beauty at 2.6 GHz, twice as
fast as any other computer I've ever used.  Kernel compiles now take two
minutes.  Fortunately I had written down the commands I had used to install, so
I was able to mostly follow them.  

<P> This computer has an Intel i810 video chipset.  I assumed anything would
be better than the nVidia.  Wrong.  I had to boot the non-framebuffer kernel
on the CD in order to install, and it seemed to ignore the VGA mode so I 
couldn't get the text console above 80x24.  Likewise, I couldn't make an
X configuration that would go above 640x480; it kept on saying mode
"1024x768" doesn't exist even though it's supposed to be a standard VESA
mode built into X 4.  Googling found contradictory advice, including one
message saying i810 isn't supported very well on Linux, and an apparently
obsolete HOWTO on Intel's site.  Finally I stole a 3dfx (Voodoo) PCI card from
an unused computer.  That one still took a while to configure but I finally got
it up to 1280x1024.  Then I moved it down to 1152x864 because that looks better
on my 19" monitor.  But I still can't get the text screen better than 80x24,
and I'm not sure about the framebuffer.  Curiously, the BIOS doesn't have an
option to disable the i810 chip, you can only set it to "on" or "auto".
Leaving it at "auto" makes the PCI card the main one (card 0) and the i810
the secondary (card 1), but both are active.  In <TT>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</TT>
you tell it which card and monitor to use.  In Windows it assumes you have
monitors connected to both cards (I don't) and you want the desktop to
span both monitors (so each monitor shows half).  The "Monitors" control
panel has controls to ignore one card or make it primary.  These all work fine
although it's disconcerning when the screen suddenly goes dark or the taskbar
disappears onto the other screen as you change the settings (because Windows
assumes you have a second monitor connected to the other card, which I don't).
I hate to say it, but it was easier to configure the two cards in Windows than
Linux.

<P> KDE 3.3 came out the day before I did this install, but for some reason
it's still in the "masked" section in Gentoo (meaning Unstable), so I'm
sticking with 3.2 for now.

<P> Printing was a breeze to set up once I found the Printing HOWTO on the
Gentoo site.  I had to connect to an HP LaserJet 8000 using IPP (Internet
Print Protocol) over TCP/IP.  
<A HREF="http://linuxprinting.org/">LinuxPrinting.org</A> provided a
prebuilt driver, and the Printing HOWTO told me which directory to put it
in so CUPS would see it.  

<P> The main thing I can't get to work is smbfs.  Our shared files are kept
on an NT server.  My colleague who has Gentoo can do it using Konqueror or this
command:

<!-- I didn't use <PRE> here so the line will justify to the browser width. -->

<P> <TT>mount -t smbfs //SERVER/directory /mnt/smb 
-o
"ip=111.222.333.444,username=USER%PASSWORD,workgroup=WORKGROUP,fmask=666,dmask=000"</TT>

<P> ... but for me although I connect without error, "ls /mnt/smb" says
permission denied, and "ls /mnt" doesn't even show "smb" while it's mounted.  I
tried several variations of the network directory and username, with and
without the fmask/dmask, but nothing has worked.  So I still have to switch to
Windows to save my backups to the network, and to run a Java applet that won't
run in Firefox or Galeon.  

<P> I made a DOS partition to share files between 
Linux and Windows.  That works although it's sometimes surprising when
permissions don't work the way you expect, even though you've known about that
for years.  You set the permissions in the mount command.  I finally gave
them all permission for all users so I wouldn't have to fuss with them
any more.

<P> Here's the non-default packages I've felt the need to install so far:
<UL>
<LI> a2ps
<LI> apache (2.0.50)
<LI> bind-tools (host, nslookup, dig)
<LI> cups
<LI> dosfstools (mkfs.vfat)
<LI> foomatic (not needed after all)
<LI> fvwm
<LI> fvwm-crystal
<LI> galeon
<LI> gentoolkit (package query tools)
<LI> ghostscript
<LI> gimp-print (not needed after all)
<LI> gvim
<LI> kde
<LI> links
<LI> mmv
<LI> mod_php
<LI> mozilla-firefox
<LI> mozilla-thunderbird
<LI> mutt
<LI> mysql
<LI> ncftp
<LI> netkit-telnet
<LI> openoffice (it wouldn't compile)
<LI> php
<LI> php-accellerator
<LI> php-docs
<LI> stow
<LI> subversion
<LI> sun-jdk
<LI> vim
<LI> xorg-x11
<LI> xpdf
</UL>

... not including various Python libraries and PHP libraries.

<H2>More critiques of Gentoo</H2>

<P> Gentoo's package query tools (<TT>equery</TT> and <TT>qpkg</TT>) aren't
complete.  They'll list the files a package contains but several other features
are marked "not implemented".  There didn't seem to be a way to quickly see
which version of a package is installed: something equivalent to "<TT>rpm
PACKAGE</TT>" or "<TT>dpkg -l PACKAGE</TT>".  "<TT>emerge search PACKAGE</TT>"
does it, but it takes several seconds, and you have to page through other
information and entries for any other packages the substring matches.  After a
fair bit of trial and error, I found that <TT>qpkg</TT> can show me the
information, but it doesn't take concatenated flags, so I had to type "<TT>qpkg
-i -I PACKAGE</TT>", where <TT>-i</TT> gets me package info, and <TT>-I</TT>
limits the list to installed packages only.  By the way, "<TT>emerge info
PACKAGE</TT>" does <EM>not</EM> do what you expect.  I'd expect it to give
extended information about the package &agrave; la "<TT>dpkg -s PACKAGE</TT>",
but instead it reports on your installation environment; e.g., which USE flags
are in effect.

<P> It's bloody hard to figure out which package you need if you don't
know the name.  I wish Gentoo had a webpage similar to
<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/">packages.debian.org</A> you could
search.  In fact, I still use packages.debian.org to figure out which
Gentoo packages I want!  The biggest problems I had were finding the
package for <tt>mkfs.vfat</tt> (dosfstools) and 
<tt>host</tt>/<tt>dig</tt>/<tt>nslookup</tt> (bind-tools).
I needed the former to make my DOS filesystem.  Finally I found a couple
messages in the Gentoo forums with the name of the package, showing that
several other people have had the same problem.

<P> "<TT>emerge search</TT>"'s package descriptions are one-liners rather
than the paragraph(s) Debian provides at the web site or via 
"<TT>apt-cache search PACKAGE</TT>".  The missing info is stuff I want to know
to decide whether to install the package.

<P> Gentoo-specific package documentation also seems to be missing --
equivalent to <tt>/usr/share/doc/PACKAGE/README.Debian</tt> .  One would like
a file describing the Gentoo way to configure and use the package,
especially since Gentoo's configuration framework is different from
other distributions.  The framework looks impressively flexible; many
packages have a separate file for local overrides, so the standard
configuration file can be upgraded without stomping on anything.  
The overrides are almost invariably in the form of variable
definitions.  To enable SSL and PHP in Apache2, no need to edit the
config file, just set:

<PRE>
APACHE2_OPTS="-D SSL -D PHP"
</PRE>

... in <tt>/etc/conf.d/apache2</tt> . The trouble is, if you forget where to
set what, there's a lot of places to look for it: <tt>/etc/conf.d/*</tt>,
<tt>/etc/rc</tt>, <tt>/etc/make.conf</tt>, <tt>/etc/profile</tt>, and there may
be more that slip my mind.  This is where a <TT>README.Gentoo</TT> file would
come in useful.  The init.d scripts are different from other distributions',
although they're robust.  "<tt>rc-update show default</tt>" shows which
services are set to start at boot, and "<tt>rc-update add PACKAGE default</tt>"
adds it.  <EM><STRONG>When an init.d service fails to start, check
/var/log/*!</STRONG></EM>  That's true for any distro, but I find it quite
useful on Gentoo since packages have no <TT>README.Gentoo</TT> to guide you.
Somewhere I set <TT>kdm</TT> to shutdown when I log out rather than presenting
the login dialog.  Now I want to change it but darned if I can find the
setting.

<P> Another thing I haven't figured out is how to compile a package with
different <TT>./configure</TT> options than the maintainer set, or how to
install a development version that Gentoo doesn't have.  I need to reinstall
PHP with the msysqli option (an object-oriented MySQL library).  I finally
found a USE flag called, unsurprisingly, "mysqli", but the general problem
remains.  Also, I often use alpha versions of Python, which I put in
<tt>/usr/local</tt> now but I'd like to install them like Gentoo packages.  I
assume I just have to sit down and figure out how to customize ebuilds, and
where to put them so they don't get deleted at the next "<tt>emerge sync</tt>".
There's also a nifty "<tt>emerge inject PACKAGE</tt>" feature that tells
Portage you've installed something locally that's the equivalent of PACKAGE.  I
haven't used it yet but it certainly sounds a lot easier than 
<TT>dpkg-equivs</TT>.

<P> For those with lots of disk space but little time, "<tt>emerge ccache</tt>"
sets up a compilation cache that saves intermediate files so you don't
have to regenerate them.  There's also a distcc package for replicating
installs in a network, although I haven't used it.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P> Although I've found a bunch of little shortcomings in Gentoo, it's
still my favorite distro because it has so much potential.  Eventually
the gaps will be filled, and the lightweight layer they add to packages
ensures that upstream versions are quickly ported to Gentoo because there's
not much overhead to get in the way.
