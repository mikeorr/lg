One day I realized that I seem to spend an
inordinate amount of time in front of a computer screen
and more precisely with a text editor in front of me.
This should hardly have been a surprise to me considering
I work with computers for eight to ten hours a day and then
I go home and spend several more.  I guess that this obvious
fact finally struck home with me.  I would guess I spend 
about 20-30 hours a week in a text editor alone.  With some
quick calculations I realized that this adds up to over 1000
hours a year.  That is over 40 solid days of my life every
year in an editor. (That is a conservative estimate.)  This
realization spurred me to try to optimize the time I spend
in my editor.
<p>
The first step I took was to try and find the <i>best</i> 
editor around.  I started asking around to see who used
what and to try to find out what the important qualities
of an editor were.  <b>Don't</b> make this mistake.
Editors are one of the most religious beliefs a programmer
holds.  Every programmer is convinced that there's is the
best.  My office-mate uses PICO, some of my co-workers use
EMACS, VI, SlickEdit, or any one of an unending list.  Every
person I talked to insured me that their selection was by
far the best.  When I inquired about the differences, they
were primarily insignificant.  That was when I learned the
horrible truth.  Most editors are essentially equivalent.
No matter how hard people insist, most editors have more 
features than any user will ever use. (Except PICO).  In the
Linux community, these selections basically fall in to one
of two categories.  VI clones, or Emacs.  My recommendation
is that everyone learn one of these well.  It doesn't really
matter which one, just pick one, stick with it and use it.
(Religiously if you must.) 
<p>
I have gone to great lengths to learn VIM, a VI clone.  And
certainly if not THE best, one of the top contenders.  Many
features are shared among VI clones, basically the VI subset.
The additional features are basically individual to each
clone.  VIM comes with most, if not all, Linux distributions. 
The home page for VIM is 
<A HREF ="http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/vim/">
http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/~guckes/vim/</A>.  VIM is in
active development and is getting better by the day.  Syntax
highlighting should be out, if not by the time you read this,
then soon thereafter.
<p>
I will assume that most people know the basics of VI and want
to change it from a simple tool to a powerful one.  I will share
some of the handy tips and tricks I use.

<P>
<U><B>Programming, Tabs, and Tags.</B></U><BR>
ctags is a marvelous utility for C and C++ Programmers.  ctags
comes with the VIM distribution.  What this utility does is 
create a list of all the subroutine names in the files you
specify and allow you to jump to the given subroutine while
in you editor with just one keypress.  The way you run ctags
is simple.
<PRE><H4>
ctags *.c
or
ctags *.cpp
</H4></PRE>
Then, crank up your editor and move to wherever it is you
call any subroutine from and press [CTRL]-].  This will
take you immediately to wherever the routine is, even if
it is in a different file.
<p>
<U><B>File Switching</B></U><BR>
I frequently work with several files concurrently and I 
need to switch between these files continually.  The
command to switch to another file in VIM is &quot;:e <i>fn</i>&quot;.
The shortcut to switch to the last file edited is &quot;:e #&quot;.
This is fine for normal use, but I switch files often, and
4 keystrokes seems like a bit much.  This is where VIM's
key mapping comes in.  VIM like most editors has an <i>rc</i>
file.  It is called .vimrc, what a shock. 8)
In this file I have the following command.
<PRE><H4> 
" Save and switch to other buffer.
map N :w [CTRL]-M 
</H4></PRE>
This command lets me switch buffers with a single keypress.
The other nice feature in VIM for switching between files
is tab completion for file names.  The way tab completion
works is to take whatever letters you have typed in so
far on for the file name and find all of the files that
could possibly match.  Hitting tab will scroll through
the list of files until you find the one you want.  If no
beginning letters are specified for the file name, it will
scroll through them all.

<U><B>Mapping</B></U><BR>
I do a LOT of coding and I find that I often need to comment
out blocks of lines.  I have developed 2 macros for handling
this with a minimum of effort.
<pre><H4> 
map C 0i/*[CTRL-ESC]A*/[CTRL-ESC]j
map T 0xx$xxj
</H4></pre>
If you examine the first line, you will see that it does the
following.<br>
<UL>
<LI>Moves to the beginning of the line
<LI>Enters Insert Mode
<LI>Places &quot;\*&quot; there
<LI>Escapes to command mode
<LI>Adds &quot;*/&quot; to the end of the line
<LI>Escapes to command mode
<LI>Moves down One line
</UL>
The second line does the following.
<UL>
<LI>Moves to the beginning of the line
<LI>Removes 2 characters
<LI>Moves to the end of the line
<LI>Removes 2 characters
<LI>Moves down One line
</UL>
I can type &quot;12C&quot; in command mode and it will comment out the
next dozen lines.  and &quot;12T&quot; will uncomment a dozen lines that
were commented by &quot;C&quot;.
<BR><BR>
Keep in mind that when you remap keys, they lose there original
values.  In this case, &quot;C&quot; was an odd Delete until end of line
and next several lines into a given buffer, and &quot;T&quot; was a command
I can't really figure out from the documentation.  I don't really
miss these two but be careful that you don't map &quot;i&quot; or &quot;x&quot; or
anything else you might need later.

<BR><BR>
Have fun with this.  I hope to have more later.
<BR>
