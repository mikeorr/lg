Hi, I wonder if you'd like to put this in Talkback or 2-Cent Tips in the
next issue:
</p>


<p>
Since writing the article, I found a couple of minor problems.
</p>

<p>
One was that the sound sometimes fails in such a way that is not
detectable by the NSLU2 (for example the speaker is not connected
properly), and to mitigate the possible consequences of this, I set my
NSLU2 to start playing a recognisible tune using its internal speaker if
an important alarm is not acknowledged.  I wrote a script that can
convert any MIDI file into commands for Johnathan Nightingale's "beep"
utility (which is available in the "beep" package on the NSLU2 Debian
distribution), and my "MIDI to beep" script is available at
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/midi-beeper.html">http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/mwrhome/midi-beeper.html</a>
</p>

<p>
The other is that the NSLU2 may sometimes hang if the USB connection to
its primary disk is somehow jolted; use of its built-in hardware
watchtog helps, but it's best if the watchdog is used in such a way that
a disk hang will be noticed by the watchdog (which might not happen if
the process that's writing to /dev/watchdog is constantly in RAM), so
rather than running a watchdog program I decided to do it in root's
crontab:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
* * * * * echo &gt;/dev/watchdog;sleep 20;echo &gt;/dev/watchdog;sleep 20;echo &gt;/dev/watchdog
</pre>
i.e. write to /dev/watchdog 3 times a minute (the system will reboot if
it's not written to for a whole minute).  Doing it this way rather than
in a self-conained process should result in a watchdog failure if the
primary disk gets pulled out (resulting in it being unmounted) because
bin/sleep will become unavailable.  This is so even though it will
normally be cached in RAM and incur little or no disk activity.  The
cron job is quite lightweight, since the code for "bash" can be shared
with any other bash scripts that are running at the same time and
therefore should not take up much of its own memory.
</p>

This is great. Perhaps it can be made into a plugin for timidity!

Heck, it sounds like it would be a <em>replacement</em> for timidity.  Back in
the early days (early 1980s), long before sound cards became standard
equipment (or even existed), I recall playing MIDI files and such
through the PC speaker on my DOS machine. I don't remember the name of
the program, but it was surprisingly - even amazingly - good. Having
this as an option for folks who can't afford a fancy pair of speakers
(or just can't spare the room) would be in the best tradition of Linux -
providing options all the way down the food chain. A kind of an audio
equivalent of 'aalib'.
</p>

<p>
Imagine Quake on a text-only terminal, with decent sound from the PC
speaker... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

No problem at all, Silas; it'll be in the next month's Talkbacks.
Those are both <strong>smart</strong>, well-considered solutions - well done!

Hello,
</p>

<p>
Fantastic idea! Just shows that there is no limit to what a hacker can
think of given the right OS (Linux of course!) to work on. Great stuff
Silas.
