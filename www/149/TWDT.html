<p>
Anyone know of a way to have multiple ssh authorized_keys files for  
host key authentication for different users. I am familiar with the  
usual practice of echoing all of the users keys into authorized_keys  
file but I am thinking in terms of if I have to revoke keys and  
disable user access. What I would like to do is have a setup similar  
to apache in that it can have files included in the conf directory. So  
this way I have a user name or identifying indicator of whose key is  
whose so I can revoke access as the necessity arises.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for all of your help.

Hello,

<p>
I am currently trying to get some experience using 'Iozone' to obtain
some I/O test results on my Linux 2.6 disk partitions. Subsequently, I
would like to use my knowledge to do some analysis in a RAID project I
am working on.
</p>

<p>
Do we have anyone here experienced with using the 'Iozone' tool
(<a href="http://www.iozone.org/">http://www.iozone.org/</a>) ?
It would be nice to know of your experiences.

I have a procedure for dealing with when my users put spaces in their filenames.

<p>
find / -name '* *' -exec ls -l {} \;

<p>
Taking the third column in the output, you get the username, which you
can then pipe to ps -u -o pid | xargs -i kill -9 {}
</p>

<p>
This gives you the list of users with spaces. Some manipulation with
Awk, or Perl, can turn this into a list of usernames prefixed with
userdel -r, which can then be piped to /bin/sh.
</p>

<p>
After you've finished deleting your accounts, you can then hire a
hitman to ensure that they never receive accounts on any of your
systems again.

I was reminded of Ren?'s article while trying to get Apertium to
compile with Cygwin, because Cygwin lacks wide string support in g++.
I tried to find a canned piece of m4, to give a warning about this at
configure time instead of compile time, but, alas, I couldn't find
anything and had to write something myself.

Does anyone know enough about configure etc. to find any obvious
problems with this?

Could you ask the author of the review of the book, 'Installing Linux on a
Dead Badger', which features in the latest edition of Linux Gazette, what
the book is actually about?
Having read his admittedly witty and erudite review, I'm still no clearer.

<h3>2-cent tips: convert the collection of your mp3 files into ogg</h3>
<p>
<b><p>
Mulyadi Santosa [mulyadi.santosa at gmail.com]

</p>
</b><br />
<b>Sat, 26 Jan 2008 21:54:43 +0700</b>
</p>

<p>
First, why? Easy, because mp3 is patended format and ogg is open
source format. So, to guarantee your peace of mind (like what Cattano
said to Frank Lucas in "American Gangster" <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> ), use ogg.
</p>

<p>
To do it, first I assume you have mpg123 (<a href="http://www.mpg123.de/">http://www.mpg123.de/</a>)
installed and the binary is located in searchable path (check your
$PATH).
</p>

<p>
Your mp3 files probably contain spaces, so use this script:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
 
for b in *; do (  cd $b; for a in *; do mv -v "$a" $(echo $a | sed s/\
/\_/g); done ) ; done
</pre>

<p>
The script assumes your working directory has subdirectories that
holds the mp3 files (think of it as albums). Outer loop lists the
directories and inner loop "cd" into them and rename the files inside
so they don't contain spaces anymore.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the real piece of work:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
 
for b in *;
do ( cd $b;
     for a in *;
            do test=$(echo $a | cut -f1 -d\.).wav ;
            mpg123 -v -w $test "$a";
            oggenc  $test ;
            rm -fv $test ;  rm -fv "$a" ;
     done );
done
</pre>

<p>
In short, the script loops over your collections. It uses mpg123 to
convert your mp3s into wavs. Then, oggenc converts it as ogg. The wav
is then deleted since we don't need it anymore. Why create wav 1st,
you might ask? Well, i tried to pipe mpg123 directly to oggenc but
somehow it didn't work (at least in my case), so that's my workaround.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Open Source Persistence Framework to provide JPA 2.0</h3>

<p>
The Eclipse Foundation and Sun Microsystems have selected the EclipseLink
project as the reference implementation for Java's JPA 2.0. Sun is the
project lead for the Java Persistence API (JPA) and the JSR 317
standard. This is another example of how the Eclipse community has been
leading the implementation of JSRs under the Java Community Process
(JCP). The Eclipse Persistence Services Project (EclipseLink), led by
Oracle, delivers an open source runtime framework supporting major
persistence standards.
</p>
 

<p>
The EclipseLink project provides a rich set of services addressing
complex mapping, performance, and scalability issues required for
enterprise Java applications. JSR 317, the Java Persistence API, is the
Java API for the management of persistence and object/relational mapping
for the Java Platform. As the reference implementation, EclipseLink will
provide a commercial quality persistence solution that can be used in
both Java SE and Java EE applications.
</p>

<p>
The EclipseLink project was initiated with Oracle's contribution of the
full source code and test suite for Oracle TopLink. The project builds
on the success of TopLink Essentials which is featured in Sun's
GlassFish Open Source Application Server, the JPA 1.0 reference
implementation, which was also based on Oracle TopLink.
</p>

<p>

<h4>New Eclipse Runtime Initiative around Equinox</h4>

<p>
At EclipseCon 2008 in March, the Eclipse Foundation announced a new
initiative to develop and promote open source runtime technology based
on Equinox, a lightweight and OSGi-compliant runtime for applications.
While Eclipse is well known for its widely used development tools, this
initiative establishes a community of Eclipse open source projects
focused on runtime technology that provides a more flexible approach to
building and deploying software on mobile, desktop, and server
environments.
</p>

<p>
The move to create a community around Equinox is a logical progression
for Eclipse. Equinox, the core runtime platform for Eclipse, has been
deployed on millions of software developers' desktops, has enabled an
ecosystem of thousands of Eclipse plug-ins, and is the base of hundreds
of Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP)-based applications. Recently, the
community has also used Equinox as the server platform for Ajax
applications, SOA, enterprise client/server applications and others. So,
this new initiative promotes Equinox as a platform for building and
deploying general purpose software products and applications.
</p>

<p>
More details about the Equinox community can be found at

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Eclipse Higgins 1.0 Released</h3>

<p>
Eclipse Foundation announced the availability of Eclipse Higgins 1.0, a
freely downloadable identity framework designed to integrate identity,
profile, and social relationship information across multiple sites,
applications, and devices.
</p>

<p>
Web 2.0, mashups, social networking, and the general rise of networked
applications have made Web-based identity management complex for both
end-users and developers. The Eclipse Higgins project has been working
to address these issues. Multiple identity protocols have been developed
to address different needs, including WS-Trust, OpenID, SAML, XDI, and
LDAP.
</p>

<p>
Eclipse Higgins 1.0 is now available at
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/higgins/downloads.php">http://www.eclipse.org/higgins/downloads.php</a>. More information about the project is available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/higgins">http://www.eclipse.org/higgins</a>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />NSA, Sun to enhance OpenSolaris Security</h3>

<p>
Sun and the United States' National Security Agency (NSA) announced an
agreement to jointly work within the OpenSolaris Community to research
and to develop security enhancements to complement existing OpenSolaris
security mechanisms. Both Sun and the NSA will work with the OpenSolaris
community to integrate an additional form of mandatory access control
(MAC), based on the Flux Advanced Security Kernel (Flask) architecture.
</p>

<p>
The joint research project is intended to complement the security
benefits of the mandatory access controls provided by the Solaris(TM)
Trusted Extensions feature and will be evaluated by the OpenSolaris
community. The Flask architecture supports a wide range of security
policies, enabling integration of different policy engines and 
configuration of the security policy to meet the specific security goals
for a wide range of computing environments.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Plat'Home launches Linux-based Eco-Friendly Servers</h3>

<p>
Part of the first ecology-friendly line of Linux servers ever shipped in
the United States, Plat'Home's OpenBlockS server has been built and tested
to provide enterprise-grade reliability in its RISC-based hardware, and has
eliminated moving parts including a hard disk drive and cooling fan. It is
also RoHS certified, a European Union directive meaning that it's free of lead,
mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium and other damaging materials.
</p>

<p>
The OpenBlockS server line is a breakthrough in size and power consumption
for a Linux server. One standard configuration Dell, HP or IBM server
consumes the same amount of power as 76 of these devices.  The
OpenBlockS266 during operation sips a miniscule 4.5 watts or less.  In
standby mode, it is 4.0 watts or less.  This compares, for example, to the
Dell Poweredge R200 that chews up 345 watts.
</p>

<p>
OpenBlockS runs a broad range of applications - even in hazardous
environments. It can also be used to manage network problems and
troubleshoot errors such as packet loss, delay, fluctuation, duplication
and order switching, and it provides a cost-effective solution to monitor a
local network or to ensure line quality for a critical server or terminal
where it is necessary to maintain an appropriate line speed.
</p>

<p>
Key features of the Plat'Home OpenBlockS include:
</p> 

<ul>
<li>-       
Size:
4.5'' x 3.2'' x 1.5'', rubber feet 0.02&#8221;</li>
<li>-        Power Consumption during
operation at 4.5W or less; During standby at 4.0W or less</li>
<li>-        Preinstalled with
SSD/Linux; also supports Debian and NetBSD</li>
<li>-        266MHz IBM&reg;
PowerPC&reg; 405GPr RISC processor</li>
<li>-        2 10/100BaseTX Ports, 1
RJ-45 Serial port</li>
<li>-        Stable long-term
operation even under 41&deg;C/104&deg;F</li>
<li>-        Internal Storage:
Compact Flash or IDE 2.5" HDD (not included)</li>
</ul>

<p>
OpenBlockS servers can be fully administered over the network. For more

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />VMware VMsafe protects VMs</h3>

<p>
VMware has a new security technology called VMware VMsafe,
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/vmsafe">http://www.vmware.com/go/vmsafe</a>
, that protects applications running in virtual machines in ways
previously not possible in physical environments. The VMsafe APIs allow
vendors to develop advanced security products that combat the latest
generation of malware. VMsafe technology integrates into the VMware ESX
hypervisor and provides the transparency to prevent threats and attacks
such as viruses, trojans, and keyloggers from ever reaching a virtual
machine.
</p> 

<p>
Twenty security vendors have embraced VMsafe technology, and are building
products that will further enhance the security of virtual machines,
making the virtual environment unmatched in the level of security and
protection it provides compared to physical systems.
</p>

<p>
VMsafe technology integrates at the hypervisor layer of virtualization
to detect and eliminate the latest generation of malware. The VMware
hypervisor is an ultra-thin layer of software that runs directly on
server hardware independently of the operating system, enabling users to
create virtual machines on the server in which to run applications.
VMsafe technology provides transparency into the memory, CPU, disk, and
I/O systems of the virtual machine, and monitors every aspect of the
execution of the system. Security products built on VMsafe technology
are able to stop malware before it harms a machine or steals data,
including the latest generation of rootkits, trojans, and viruses, which
are undetectable on physical machines.

<h1>Deividson on Databases: Views</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dokopnik.html">Deividson Luiz Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
PostgreSQL -
<em>"The world's most advanced open source database"</em> as stated at <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>
- is packed with features that can help you immensely when
developing applications. In this series, we will see three very
important, often under-utilized options that have a broad range of uses.
They are called <em>Views</em>, <em>Stored Procedures</em>, and <em>Triggers</em>.
</p>

<p>
We will use real-world examples, with lots of code to help you understand
those features.
</p>

<h3>Views</h3>
<p>
A View is a pre-selection of data that can be accessed by an SQL query.  It
minimizes the need for complex (sometimes very complex) SQL in your
application and is often used to retrieve data for standard reports or
other regularly-fetched data sets.
</p>

<p>
As an example, let's assume that you have the following tables in your
database (you can use these SQL commands to create your own test suite):
</p>

<pre class="code">create table cpu (
cpu_id serial primary key, 
cpu_type text );
	
create table video (
video_id serial primary key, 
video_type text );
	
create table computer (
computer_id serial primary key,
computer_ram integer,
cpu_id integer references cpu(cpu_id),
video_id integer references video(video_id)
);</pre>

<p>
And the following data inside it:
</p>

<pre class="code">insert into cpu(cpu_type) values('Intel P4 Dual Core D');
insert into cpu(cpu_type) values('AMD Athlon');

insert into video(video_type) values('Geforce 8600GT'); 
insert into video(video_type) values('Radeon 9550'); 

insert into computer values (0, 512, 1, 2);
insert into computer values (1, 1024, 2, 1);
insert into computer values (2, 512, 2, 2);</pre>

<p>
That's a pretty simple database with 3 tables - CPUs, video types, and
computers, tied up with Foreign Keys. Now let's say you need to fetch
the computer data from those tables - but you don't want the CPU and
Video IDs, just the description. You can use the following SQL:
</p>

<pre class="code">select a.computer_id, a.computer_ram, b.cpu_type, c.video_type 
from computer a, cpu b, video c 
where (a.cpu_id=b.cpu_id) AND (a.video_id=c.video_id);</pre>

<p>
That will return the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">0     512     "Intel P4 Dual Core D"     "Radeon 9550"
1    1024     "AMD Athlon"               "Geforce 8600GT"
2     512     "AMD Athlon"               "Radeon 9550"</pre>

<p>
Now if you use that same SQL a lot, you can simplify calling it by
defining a view, like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">create or replace view computer_full(computer_id, computer_ram, cpu_type, video_type) as (
select a.computer_id, a.computer_ram, b.cpu_type, c.video_type 
from computer a, cpu b, video c 
where (a.cpu_id=b.cpu_id) AND (a.video_id=c.video_id)
);</pre>

<p>
That's <code>"create [or replace] view (view name) [(returned field aliases)]
as (sql)"</code>. The <code>"or replace"</code> is useful for testing: it
replaces the view if it already exists, so you don't need to DROP it
before re-creating. The field aliases are optional, and if omitted the
view will return the field names.
</p>

<p>
Now anywhere you need that same data, you can have it by executing
</p>

<pre class="code">select * from computer_full;</pre>

<p>
The result will be the same we have above. You can even use WHERE
clauses too, like:
</p>

<pre class="code">Select * from computer_full where computer_id=1</pre>

<p>
The result will be:
</p>

<pre class="code">1     1024     "AMD Athlon"     "Geforce 8600GT"</pre>

<p>
That helps, not only by simplifying your queries, but also makes it easier
in case you find a bug on your code, or a better way to do it - you simply
change the View, and in every place that you called it, the new code will
be executed. Let's change our view to a more professional way of selecting
data - <em>junctions</em>. Junctions are a better way of fetching data from
multiple tables, being faster than the labeling tables method we used
above. There's several ways of doing junctions, and on our example we can
choose between 2 of them:
</p>

<pre class="code">create or replace view computer_full as (
select computer_id, computer_ram, cpu_type, video_type from computer a
right join cpu b on (a.cpu_id=b.cpu_id)
right join video c on (a.video_id=c.video_id)
);</pre>

<p>
and
</p>

<pre class="code">create or replace view computer_full as (
select computer_id, computer_ram, cpu_type, video_type from computer
natural right join cpu
natural right join video
);</pre>

<p>
The first option, using "on" is used when the Column name you are
using to connect the two tables are different ('on
computer_cpu_id=cpu_id'), and the second one (natural join) is used when
both column names are identical. That's the reason we had to label our
tables (computer a, cpu b, video c) in our first example - using 'on
cpu_id=cpu_id' would be ambiguous. Try to always use Natural Joins
whenever possible - they are easier to understand and usually faster.
</p>

<strong>Temporary Views</strong>

<p>
Temporary Views are, just as the name says, temporary views. You can use
then just like views, but they are not supposed to be static (i.e., always
in your database.) A quick example of a temp view is:
</p>

<pre class="code">create temp view products (model, price) as
select model, price from pc union
select model, price from laptop union
select model, price from printer</pre>

<p>
and dispose of it with
</p>

<pre class="code">drop view test</pre>

<p>
Temporary views can be useful for storing the code of dynamic reports or
similar tasks.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Views are more of a convenience than a speed feature, but using them can be
helpful when developing systems.
</p>
<p>
There's a small .sql file
<a href="misc/dokopnik/test.sql">attached</a>
to this article - if you open it in PGAdmin, there's code to create test
data for our sample tables (50000 CPUs and Videos, 500000 computers).
You can use it to see how Views and normal SQL commands behave, speed-
wise, with a large dataset.
</p>
<p>
Well, that's it for this article, I hope it was useful - next
month, we'll cover Stored Procedures!
</p>
<p>
A special thanks goes out to teacher Saulo Benvenutti, great Database
teacher - it was a pleasure to be in your classes.

<h1>Away Mission: About IdMgt, Higgins, RSA, Catalyst, and ITxpo</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
Lately, there have been a lot of conferences focusing on the role of
digital identity and the role of Identity Management [IdMgt or IdM]
technology. This is a strong indicator of the level of interest by a
broad group of stakeholders: government, enterprise IT, SaaS and
mobility service providers, security firms, Internet merchants and Web
2.0 site operators, privacy advocates, and large user communities.
</p>

<p>
The issues are still being scoped - but innovative and potentially
disruptive technical solutions are already being developed by startups and
niche players, and you'd need a scorecard to sort out the players and the
issues.  Opportunities for doing just that abound at conferences and
interop events such as the annual RSA conference, the annual Digital ID
conference, IT and government security events, and events put on by ACM and
USENIX among others, and the pundit platforms provided by the Gartner Group
and the Burton Group.
</p>

<p>

What we learn at these events is that under the newly enhanced regulatory
environment, identity policy, provisioning, management, and lifecycle are
critical for both security needs on the one hand and also for meeting legal
and compliance requirements on the other. Government and industry alike
know they have to address these points, but the ink hasn't dried on the
standards or the expectations. Figuring out what to do is at least as
important as how, but both areas are still being defined so there's a place
for both the technical conferences addressed at implementers, and the
conferences focusing on governance and management. Bring on the pundits,
please.

</p>

<p>
It's also hard to ignore the David and Goliath comparisons. But maybe
that's why you're reading this Away Mission. OK, let's get to it.

</p>

<h3>Higgins and OpenID</h3>

<p>
The complexities of Digital ID management have been the focus of many IT
and security technology conferences over the past year. All have had to
touch on ID federation and the relations between ID providers, ID
authenticators and those relying on this information in digital
transactions. All the major conferences have paid attention to the
demands of user-centric ID mechanisms that afford a large measure of
selection and control to the persons represented by these digital IDs.
</p>

<p>
Two trends have clearly emerged in the last year. First, user-centric ID is
better understood and better supported by Web businesses, as shown by the
acceptance of OpenID and other user-centric ID management technologies.
Second, the Higgins framework for digital ID Federation and
interoperability has also gained significant mind share and support and is
now used in several shipping products.
</p>

<p>
OpenID has had a lot interoperability wins this last year and some
10,000 Web sites now allow login via OpenID. Although OpenID has many
options, usually a URL associated with the user is accepted as an
identity credential. Typically, this is a person's blog address. If a
person blogs on multiple subjects, each URL is relevant to its
particular subject.
</p>

<p>
Identity guru Kim Cameron said this about OpenID: <quote>"OpenID gives
us common identifiers for public personas that we can use across multiple
Web sites - and a way to prove that we really own them."</quote> Cameron
goes on to call this a huge win compared with random screen names and a
hodge-podge of passwords. 
</p>

<p>
OpenID 'news' is discussed further in the RSA section below.
</p>

<p>
Higgins, which began in 2003 and became an Eclipse incubator project in
2004, released its 1.0 version in February. Products from Serena and
Novell (Bandit) now use Higgins code and abstractions and a larger
community of developers is coalescing around it. Why? Because it
provides a lot of needed functionality for transactions between ID
providers and ID consumers and because of its broad, agnostic any-to-any
approach.
</p>

<p>
Higgins has support for straight SAML protocols and also the SOA
supported WS-Trust protocols. Higgins has plugins written in both C++
and Java, and Higgins supports the InfoCard concepts derived from (but
not limited to) Microsoft's CardSpace. In short, Higgins is the right
intermediary framework for this IdMgt epoch.
</p>

<p>
Higgins is currently in use by ALF, CloudTripper.org and the Community
Dictionary Service. The Novell DigitalMe product is over 90%
Higgins-based.
</p>


<p>
The Higgins community is also working on notation for graphing ID
relationships and correlations of the same person, something very
important to usefulness of social and business networks. Higgins borrows
here from Semantic Technology, using descriptive tuples in a manner like
RDF and OWL. This is currently called Higgins OWL or H-OWL. Discussions on
this and the data model should appear here:
</p>
<p><a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Higgins_Data_Model">http://wiki.eclipse.org/Higgins_Data_Model</a></p>

<p>
The Higgins Project will be demonstrating Release 1.0 at the
user-centric identity interoperability event at RSA2008. The last major
use interop event in the US took place at the June 2007 Burton Catalst
conference.
</p>

<p>
IBM, Novell, Parity and other vendors will all be showing interoperable
applications based on the Higgins framework. This event will
feature interoperability between identity providers, card selectors,
browsers and Web sites. When users 'click-in' to sites via managed
information cards, or i-cards, components from Open ID, Higgins Identity
Framework, Microsoft CardSpace, SAML, WS-Trust, Kerberos and X.509 will
hopefully interoperate within an identity layer built from both
open-source and commercial components. Card selectors can be embedded in
Mozilla browsers, or based on the GTK/Cocoa selector for BSD and Linux.
</p>

<p>
The less ambitious demo in 2007 worked well after all the servers
were up and initialized.
</p>

<p>
The Burton Catalyst conference, reviewed below, analyzed emerging trends
in IdMgt and heavily featured user-centric ID solutions like OpenID and
Higgins. With Higgin's leap from incubator status to production
software, it will a lot more pervasive.
</p>

<h3><a name="rsa-section">Do you know the way to RSA?</a></h3>

<p>
The Goliath conference in the security realm would be the RSA
conference. This Godfather of the modern security conference was
originally a specialty conference for cryptographers and mathematicians
17 years back. Now, the conference is broadly focused on security issues
and security products, and features big tech company CEO keynotes along
with occasional keynotes by researchers and a huge vendor expo. For a
while, the RSA conference was held in San Jose, but more recently has
been resident in San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
I recall attending when it was an insider's conference, a kind of united
white hats parley to discuss cutting edge research. When enterprises
realized that multiple layers of security were <i>de rigueur, </i>
the big dollars started to be made in security, and the RSA conference
became a necessary venue for security firms and the big software houses.
Then they were bought by EMC, which broadened the conference to include
secure storage. They still call the big conference party "The
Cryptographers Ball" and host a separate researchers track that requires
serious credentials to join.
</p>

<p>
The company behind the initials - and the crypto algorithm that also
bears the same initials - has stood for cryptographically secure products
for the same time period. Arguably, the RSA algorithm, now in the public
domain, has been instrumental in allowing allowing secure Web traffic
and internet commerce to occur. (The initials stand for Ron Rivest, Adi
Shamir and Len Adleman, who invented the RSA algorithm in 1977
(RIVE78)).
</p>

<p>
This is where a lot of security products - and partnerships - get
announced and where the big companies try to explain initiatives they
are only just starting. In 2007, attendess heard from Intel, Cisco and
Oracle, as well as EMC. Futurist Ray Kurzweil gave the closing keynote
on technological progress and evolution. For the RSA 2008 conference,
there will be speakers from CA, IBM, Microsoft, and smaller ISVs
like TippingPoint and Websense. There will also be a special keynote by
Al Gore on "Emerging Green Technologies" on April 11th. Here's a list of
all the RSA 2008 keynotes:
<a title="http://www.rsaconference.com/2008/US/Conference_Program/Keynote_Speakers.aspx" href="http://www.rsaconference.com/2008/US/Conference_Program/Keynote_Speakers.aspx">http://www.rsaconference.com/2008/US/Conference_Program/Keynote_Speakers.aspx</a>
</p>

<p>
All the keynote presentations from RSA 2007 are available here:

</p>

<p>
One of the most far-reaching announcements at RSA 2007 was Bill Gates's
keynote, where he said that Microsoft would support and collaborate with
the OpenID project. This led to Microsoft, IBM, Google, Yahoo, and
Verisign joining the OpenID Foundation as corporate board members this
past February. The OpenID Foundation was formed in June 2007 to support
and promote the technology developed by the OpenID community.
</p>

<p>
OpenID enables individuals to convert one of their already existing
digital identifiers -- such as their personal blog's URL -- into an
OpenID account, which then can be used as a login at any Web site
supporting OpenID.
</p>

<p>
Most of the content for RSA 2007 is accessible only with the conference
CD. However, a very nice selection of "Expert Tracks" were videoed and
are available publicly online. I would recommend the sessions on ID
federation and also session 202 - "Deeper Injections: Command Injection
Attacks Beyond SQL". Find that material here:
<a title="http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/tracks/index.htm" href="http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/tracks/index.htm">http://media.omediaweb.com/rsa2007/tracks/index.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
Another item available on the Web is Pat Peterson's presentation on
"Deconstructing a 20-billion Message Spam Attack" from 100,000 zombie
bots. (Patrick Peterson is Vice President of Technology at IronPort
Systems.) That's available here:

</p>

<p>
Although an Expo/Keynote pass to RSA 2008 is not free, many participating
vendors email discount codes for free expo admission. You can contact the
ones you are familiar with or, if you have contact with Applied Identity,
or would like to, use code <b>EXP08APP</b> before April 4, 2008.

<h3>Gartner and Burton IT Conferences</h3>
</a>

<p>
Gartner is subscribed to by almost all of the Fortune 1000. It bought
out META Group a couple of years back, and the Cambridge Group as well as
other small fish in the consulting business. It's the 800-pound, or maybe
8000-pound, consultancy. Its researchers maintain over 20 distinct advisory
services and each of those holds annual conferences. If your company
subscribes to Gartner services, some annointed co-workers get to go to some
of these. It's also hard to ignore Gartner pronouncements, especially since
they have the ear of many C-Level executives.</p>

<p>
Gartner does a lot of research so it's wise to pay attention. Gartner,
and its competitors, are good at spotting and analyzing industry trends
early. They tend to follow the major vendors in each sector closely, and
may ignore an upstart, particularly in the open source arena, due to this
focus. However, Gartner also tries to link in their other services and
there is a bit of cross-selling going on.
</p>

<p>
The major challengers to Gartner are the Burton Group and Forrester
Research. Both offer significant access to webinars and white papers
on-line, a substantial number of these for free. The Burton Catalyst
conference is aimed at IT innovators and bleeding edge adopters, as well as
those trying to gauge the velocity of change. The purpose of the conference
is to make sense of leading IT issues and trends both individually and as a
group, and this conference - unlike the more narrow focus of the Gartner
events - often draws experts from all of their research services, and high
value guests from outside institutions and communities. Many of the key
Burton presenters blog regularly on their research areas and also use
reader comments to prepare the prepare for upcoming events.
</p>

<p>
I like both events but I have to express a preference for the size, the
mix, and the medley of Burton Catalyst. Because the events are smaller,
it's easier to find people interested in networking; and because of the
interlinking, one gets more of a 3D view of issues and architectural
approaches. Bottom line: I feel like I learned and understood more at
the end of the Catalyst Conference than after a Gartner Group IT
Security conference in 2007.
</p>

<p>
Having said that, I note that both organizations make getting
the conference materials difficult if your company does not subscribe to
a consulting service. Burton was better here, with most materials going
up 2-3 weeks after the conference for a download window of about 6
weeks. I had trouble for the 2006 Catalyst Conference since the
materials were unavailable for the first 10 days after the conference
and I checked back about 60 days afterward, only to find out the download
window had closed. (They did provide some individual presentations on
request.) Communications from Burton was much better in 2007 and it was
easier to know when the window would open and close. Burton also
provided live downloads during the conference but most of the last
day's presentations were not available on that day. No conference CD was
available, but some vendors provided USB drives. All that was
required was a conference login, with an online option for forgotten
passwords.
</p>

<p>
Gartner, in contrast, did provide a conference CD, but many of the
sessions were either missing or had only a short text outline. The missing
or incomplete presentations were not available during the conference.
Getting the materials afterward required the conference CD and a Gartner
account key, which attendees did get but had to be hunted for. I think
Gartner should have kept conference attendees better informed about the
availability of late posted presentations, but I also know that this is a
general problem for IT, developer, and other technical conferences. Since
both Gartner and Burton are in the business of selling their research, the
extra barriers are understandable but can more than a little annoying.
</p>

<p>
On the swag and party level, Burton also wins but only by a nose.
Gartner gave attendees a real day backpack with a pocket for laptops while
Burton handed out small padded zipper bags that are great for slipping
inside other bags (like the Gartner bag).That's a point for GGrp. And
Gartner had a real vendor expo, which partly conflicted with the schedule
of presentations. Burton Catalyst has a tradition of evening vendor soirees
along two corridors of hotel ballrooms and meeting rooms.  Every room has a
theme or game and each has either food or drink or both plus marketing
swag. Some contests included iPods or LCD TVs; for example SAP gave out 2
GB USB jump drives for asking technical questions about their IdMgt
products. But the major point here is that the vendor presentations were
evening affairs, outside of conference hours, and easily accessible. (One
vendor couldn't get the space needed one night, so their event was held
directly across the street and started half and hour before the other
events - see, very easy.)

<h3>GG and BG summaries....</h3>
<p>
The main thrust of the 2007 GGrp IT Xpo was the need to innovate and
provide greater value for the enterprise. This meant assembling a
creative mix of available technologies and allowing individual
workgroups and departments to experiment. Corporate attitudes toward
consumer tech entering the enterprise must shift from "unavoidable
nuisance" to "opportunity for additional innovation". It also means
rethinking the IT Fortress mentality. One of the key ways to
achieving this more open state is to begin to use ID provisioning, ID
federation, and ID management.
</p>

<p>
<quote>"Most IT organizations simply cannot deliver new value, new processes,
new markets, and new channels because their DNA is fundamentally about
control, which is the opposite of what you need for innovation and
growth,"</quote> said Jennifer Beck, group vice president at Gartner.
</p>

<p>
Gartner also said that about 30 percent of IT funding is not going to
centralized functions, but into the business units, such as sales and
marketing, for their own research and development. In June of 2007,
Jackie Fenn, vice president and Gartner fellow, said, <quote>"By embracing and
leveraging employee experimentation and experience with consumer
technologies, enterprises can enjoy a significant addition to the
resources they can apply to evaluating innovation."</quote>
</p>

<p>
A recent Gartner survey found that most organizations have work underway
to develop a strategy for Web 2.0, but few are prepared for, or executing
on that strategy. Gartner predicted that by year-end 2007, about 30
percent of large companies will have some form of Web-2.0-enabled
business initiative under way.
</p>

<p>
The internal challenge for companies experimenting with Web 2.0 is
characterized by inbound risks, such as malicious code in RSS feeds, and
outbound risks, such as information leakage through inappropriate
blogging or use of collaboration tools. The external challenge is threats
generated by enterprise usage and participation in Web 2.0 technologies,
such as use of third-party content (mashups) and engaging in open user
communities.
</p>

<p>
At Burton Catalyst, I kept mostly to the IdMgt and Security tracks,
which occassionally conflicted. There were other tracks on Networks,
SOA, Computer OSes, and Data Center Operations. One of the key takeaways
was that current IdM products actually reinforce the traditions of
centralized control to achieve provisioning, federation, and
de-provisioning. This counters and undermines distributed processing,
departmental independence, user-centricism, etc., and also runs counter
to the Web 2.0 trend.
</p>

<p>
Although a lot was said about ID management and federation, about
credentials and role-based security, a Feb 15 entry at
<a href="identityblog.burton.com">identityblog.burton.com</a> by analyst Gerry Gebel provides a good summary
of how Burton understands the current era:
</p>

<p>
<quote>"Technologies like federation help us make incremental advancements
beyond the command and control approach. If we permit authentication to
occur outside our domain and project this information through a
federation exchange, that's a sign of progress. However, federation
products, as they are currently constructed, still require considerable
coordination between parties in order to establish the connection: we
focused on this issue at Catalyst last year.</quote>
</p>

<p>
<quote>"So, it was interesting to see the recent video sparring between <a
href="http://blogs.sun.com/raskin/entry/sun_versus_ping_an_epic">Sun</a>
and <a
href="http://blog.pingidentity.com/blog/default/2008/01/29/Ping-Strikes-Back">Ping
Identity</a> regarding what they've done to address this from a technology
perspective. To follow up, we recorded a podcast this week with Sun, Ping
Identity, and Covisint - which will be available soon on the <a
href="http://inflectionpoint.burtongroup.com/ip/2008/03/burton-group-te.html">podcast
site</a> .</quote>  
</p>


<p>
<quote>"More incremental change is what we can expect in the near term until
different identity business models emerge. Similarly, the introduction
of OpenID and information card systems purport to change the dynamic by
providing more user control over identity data, but this is in name only
- business still determine what attributes are required to complete an
e-commerce transaction and the user can select an information card that
matches the business' criteria. Real change happens when third party
identity agencies and intermediaries proliferate and are utilized by
Internet properties. Identity oracles, as described here, are examples
of intermediaries that are beginning to appear in the marketplace."</quote>

<h1>VPN Networking</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/melinte.html">Aurelian Melinte</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Creating your own Virtual Private Network (VPN) is quite easy
on platforms that come with a tun driver: this will allow you
to process network packet traffic in user space. While that's
considerably easier than doing your network programming in the kernel
space, there still are a few details to figure out. This article should
walk you through my findings.
</p>


<h3>IFF_TUN versus IFF_TAP</h3>

<p>
The tun driver is a two-in-one device:
</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A point-to-point device (IFF_TUN). The TUN device allows for processing 
      IP packets.</li>
  <li>An Ethernet-like device (IFF_TAP). The TAP device processes Ethernet 
      frames.</li>
  </ul>

<p>
This article discusses code written around the Ethernet device. If you
choose the IP driver, then you will generate about 18 bytes per packet
processed less traffic (the Ethernet header and trailer) but you will
have to code a bit more to setup your network.
</p>

<h3>Activating the driver</h3>

<p>
First, we have to make sure the tun driver is active. On my Debian
system, I simply have to load it:
</p>

<pre>
# /sbin/modprobe tun
# /sbin/lsmod | grep tun
tun                    10208  0

# /bin/ls -l /dev/net/tun
crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 10, 200 2008-02-10 11:30 /dev/net/tun
</pre>

<h3>The setup</h3>

<p>
For demo purposes, we will build a virtual network of two hosts. Once we
have our hands on the Ethernet frames, we will use UDP encapsulation to
transmit them from a virtual interface on host A to the virtual interface
of host B and vice-versa.The UDP socket will be used un-connected; this has
the advantage of using the same socket to send and receive packets from any
other host in our virtual network. However, the un-connected nature of our
UDP socket raises some difficulties in getting the path MTU (more on this
below).
</p>

<p>
Each host in our virtual network will run an instance of the demo
program. To illustrate it, the traffic from an application (here telnet)
on host A to its corresponding application (inetd/telnetd) on host B
will take the following path:
</p>

<h3>The discovery mechanism</h3>

<p>
In practice, we need a mechanism to map virtual IP addresses to real IP
addresses. It is up to us to brew up some discovery method to resolve this
mapping issue - but since this is not relevant to our topic, or for the
purpose of our little demo described here, we'll cheat and pass the "map"
to the tunneling program through command line parameters:
</p>

<pre>
    Host A# ./udptun
    Usage: ./udptun local-tun-ip remote-physical-ip
    Host A# ./udptun 172.16.0.1   192.168.2.103
    Host B# ./udptun 172.16.0.111 192.168.2.113
</pre>

<h3>Settting up the interface</h3>

<p>
The first thing we need is to create a virtual Ethernet (tap)
interface. This is done with a simple open() call:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    struct ifreq ifr_tun; 
    int fd; 
    
    if ((fd = open("/dev/net/tun", O_RDWR)) &lt; 0) {
        /*Process error, return.*/;
    }

    memset( &amp;ifr_tun, 0, sizeof(ifr_tun) );
    ifr_tun.ifr_flags = IFF_TAP | IFF_NO_PI;
    if ((ioctl(fd, TUNSETIFF, (void *)&amp;ifr_tun)) &lt; 0) {
        /*Process error, return.*/;
    }
    
    /*Configure the interface: set IP, MTU, etc*/
</pre>

<p>
Here, the flag IFF_NO_PI requests that we manipulate raw frames. If not
set, the frames will be prepended with a 4 bytes header.
</p>

<h3>Interface setup: the IP address</h3>

<p>
The virtual interface needs to be identified by an IP address. An
ioctl() call will set it:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    /* set the IP of this end point of tunnel */
    int set_ip(struct ifreq *ifr_tun, unsigned long ip4)
    {
        struct sockaddr_in addr;
        int sock = -1; 

        sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);

        if (sock &lt; 0) {
            /*Process error, return*/
        }

        memset(&amp;addr, 0, sizeof(addr));
        addr.sin_addr.s_addr = ip; /*network byte order*/
        addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
        memcpy(&amp;ifr_tun-&gt;ifr_addr, &amp;addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr));

        if (ioctl(sock, SIOCSIFADDR, ifr_tun) &lt; 0) {
            /*Process error, return*/
        }

        /*Will be used later to set MTU.*/
        return sock; 
    }
</pre>

<h3>The Path Maximum Transmission Unit (PMTU)</h3>

<p>
The only other thing we have to set is the MTU (Maximum Transmit Unit)
of the interface. For our pseudo-Ethernet interface, the MTU is largest
payload that the Ethernet frames will carry. We will set the MTU based on
the PMTU.
</p>

<p>
Simply stated, the PMTU is the largest packet size that can traverse the
path from your host to its destination host without suffering
fragmentation.
</p>

<p>
The PMTU is an important setting to get right. Consider this: upon
(re)injecting your frames to the kernel, they will get a new set of
headers (IP, UDP and Ethernet). Thus, if the size of the frame you send
to the kernel is too close to the PMTU, the final frame that will
be sent out of the real interface might be bigger than the PMTU. At
worst, such a frame will be discarded somewhere "en route". At best, the
frame will be split in two fragments and will generate a 100% processing
overhead and some supplementary traffic.
</p>

<p>
To avoid this, we have to discover what the PMTU value is and ensure that
the new Ethernet frame will be appropriately sized for the PMTU. Thus, we
will subtract from the PMTU the overhead of the new set of headers and
set the MTU of the virtual interface to this value.
</p>

<p>
With Linux, for a TCP socket, the task it easy: we just have to make
sure the kernel mechanisms for PMTU discovery are set and we are done.
</p>

<p>
For UDP sockets though, we the users have the responsibility of ensuring
the UDP datagrams are of proper size. If the UDP socket is connected to
your correspondent host, a simple getsockopt() call with the IP_MTU flag
set will give us the PMTU.
</p>

<p>
For unconnected sockets though, we have to probe the PMTU. First, the
socket has to be set up so that datagrams are not fragmented (set the DF
flag); then, we'll want to be notified of any ICMP error this might
generate. If a host cannot handle the size of the datagram without
fragmenting, then it will notify us accordingly (or so we hope):
</p>

<pre class="code">
    int sock;
    int on;

    sock = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
    if (sock &lt; 0) {
        /*Process error, return*/;
    }

    on = IP_PMTUDISC_DO;
    if (setsockopt(sock, SOL_IP, IP_MTU_DISCOVER, &amp;on, sizeof(on))) {
        /*Process error, return*/;
    }
    
    on = 1;
    if (setsockopt(sock, SOL_IP, IP_RECVERR, &amp;on, sizeof(on))) {
        /*Process error, return*/;
    }
    
    /*Use sock for PMTU discovery.*/
</pre> 

<p>
Next, we'll send out probe datagrams of various sizes:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    int wrote = rsendto(sock, buf, len, 0, 
                    (struct sockaddr*)target, 
                    sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));
                    
</pre> 

<p>
And finally, sift through the errors until we get the PMTU right. If we
get a PMTU error, we adjust the datagram size accordingly and start
sending again, until the destination is reached:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    char sndbuf[VPN_MAX_MTU] = {0};
    struct iovec  iov;
    struct msghdr msg;
    struct cmsghdr *cmsg = NULL;
    struct sock_extended_err *err = NULL;
    struct sockaddr_in addr;
    int res; 
    int mtu;

    if (recv(sock, sndbuf, sizeof(sndbuf), MSG_DONTWAIT) &gt; 0) {
        /* Reply received. Enf of the PMTU discovery. Return.*/
    }

    msg.msg_name = (unsigned char*)&amp;addr;
    msg.msg_namelen = sizeof(addr);
    msg.msg_iov = &amp;iov;
    msg.msg_iovlen = 1;
    msg.msg_flags = 0;
    msg.msg_control = cbuf;
    msg.msg_controllen = sizeof(cbuf);
    res = recvmsg(sock, &amp;msg, MSG_ERRQUEUE);
    if (res &lt; 0) {
        if (errno != EAGAIN)
            perror("recvmsg");
        /*Nothing for now, return.*/
    }

    for (cmsg = CMSG_FIRSTHDR(&amp;msg); cmsg; cmsg = CMSG_NXTHDR(&amp;msg, cmsg)) {
        if (cmsg-&gt;cmsg_level == SOL_IP) {
            if (cmsg-&gt;cmsg_type == IP_RECVERR) {
                err = (struct sock_extended_err *) CMSG_DATA(cmsg);
            }
        }
    }
    if (err == NULL) {
        /*PMTU discovery: no info yet. Return for now but keep probing.*/
    }


    mtu = 0; 
    switch (err-&gt;ee_errno) {
    ...
    <strong>case EMSGSIZE:
        debug("  EMSGSIZE pmtu %d\n", err->ee_info);
        mtu = err->ee_info; </strong>
        break;
    ...
    } /*end switch*/

    return mtu; /*But keep probing until remote host reached!*/
</pre> 


<p>
One last note: the PMTU is bound to change over time. Therefore, you'll
have to retest once in a while, then set the MTU of the virtual interface
accordingly. If you want to avoid this dance, you can set the MTU the
"safe" but sub-optimal way: to the lesser of 576 and the MTU of the
physical interface (minus the overhead we mentioned, of course.)
</p>

<h3>Interface setup: the MTU</h3>

<p>
And finally, having this magic PMTU value, we can set the MTU of our
virtual interface correctly:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    struct ifreq *ifr_tun;
    ...
    ifr_tun-&gt;ifr_mtu = mtu; 
    if (ioctl(sock, SIOCSIFMTU, ifr_tun) &lt; 0)  {
        /*Process error*/
    }
</pre>

<h3>UDP encapsulation</h3>

<p>
Now we have the virtual interface up and configured properly. All we
have to do is to relay frames in both directions. First, open an
un-connected UDP socket (I will spare you the details), then:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>read packets from the tap file descriptor and send them to the remote
  physical IP of our corresponding host; this will send the packets in one
  direction.

<pre class="code">
    char buf[VPN_MAX_MTU] = {0}; 
    struct sockaddr_in cliaddr = {0}; 
    int recvlen = -1; 
    socklen_t clilen = sizeof(cliaddr); 
    
    recvlen = read(_tun_fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    if (recvlen &gt; 0)
        sendto(_udp_fd, buf, recvlen, 0, (struct sockaddr*)&amp;cliaddr, clilen); 
</pre>

<strong>Caveat:</strong> read()ing from the tap file descriptor will block
<em>solid</em>. What this means is that the read() call will not be interrupted in the
eventuality you close the underlying file descriptor. This forces you to
poll()/select() this file descriptor before read()ing from if you want
to terminate this thread cleanly.
</li>

<li>read datagrams from the UDP socket and push them through the tap file
  descriptor: the data will now flow in the other direction.

<pre class="code">
    recvlen = recvfrom(_udp_fd, buf, sizeof(buf), 0, 
                       (struct sockaddr*)&amp;cliaddr, &amp;clilen);
    if (recvlen &gt; 0)
        write(_tun_fd, buf, recvlen); 
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that, in practice, if you have more than two hosts in your virtual
network, you will have to look inside the frames for the source and
destination IPs before deciding where to relay the frame.

</p>

<h3>P as in private</h3>

<p>
Since you have full control over the traffic of the virtual network, you
could encrypt it in user space. For the purpose of this demo, to
build a complete VPN, we will encrypt the traffic with IPSEC (note:
IPSEC also has tunnelling functionality built in).
</p>

<p>
On Debian, just install the ipsec-tools package and use these files for
manual keying:

<h3>The VPN at work</h3>

<p>
It's show time! Let's ping the other host's virtual interface with a
payload of 100 bytes:
</p>

<pre>
    Host A$ ping -s <strong>100</strong> 172.16.0.111
</pre>

<p>
And watch the traffic with tcpdump on the virtual interface:
</p>

<pre>
    #tcpdump -i tap0
    ...

On the physical interface:
</p>

<pre>

            length 186
</pre>

<p>
All figures in bold are payloads. When it goes out of the virtual
interface, the encrypted datagram is 186 bytes: 14 bytes the Ethernet
header, 20 bytes the IP header, an AH header of 24 bytes, and ESP as the
remaining 128 bytes.
</p>

<p>
When it goes out of the physical interface, the datagram is 232 bytes: 14
bytes for the Ethernet header, 20 bytes for the IP header, 8 for the UDP
one, 186 bytes of payload and 4 bytes for the Ethernet trailer. Thus, we
introduce a 46 byte overhead per datagram.

<h1>Searching for Text (Part I)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Do you deal a lot with reading or writing text? Do you often use search
tools? Do you have a pile of data sitting on your web and file
server(s)? Many of us do. How do you organise your collection of text
data? Do you use a directory, an index, or a database? In case you
haven't decided yet, let me suggest a few options.
</p>

<h2>
Documents and Dealing with Text
</h2>

<p>
I will focus on organising, indexing, and searching text data. This is
sufficient, since a lot of search queries can be transformed to text. In
addition, processing text is harder than it seems, so it's good to have
a focus. You may note that I make a distinction between documents
and text data; the reason is the sheer volume of different document
formats. Some of them are well-defined, some aren't. Some have open
specifications readily available to developers. Proprietary document
formats are always a barrier for data processing. Unfortunately, these
formats cannot be avoided.
</p>

<p>
The first thing you have to do is to organise your data in some way. It
doesn't matter if you populate a file server with a directory structure
and start copying data or if you keep a list of bookmarks in your
browser. The most important aspect is to have a kind of unique
identifier or reference to every single document. Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs) work well; a path to a file along with its name will
also be perfect. It's best if you manage to group your documents by a
list of categories. The next thing you have to consider is the document
formats. Most indexing and search tools can only handle text, so if your
document format allows for conversions, then it is useful for processing.
Here are some examples for conversions done in shell scripts.

<ol>
<li> PDF: <tt>pdftotext -q -eol unix -enc UTF-8 $IN - &gt; $OUT</tt></li>
<li> Postscript: <tt>pstotext $IN | iconv -f ISO-8859-1 -t UTF-8 -o $OUT -</tt></li>
<li> MS Word: <tt>antiword $IN &gt; $OUT</tt></li>
<li> HTML: <tt>html2text -nobs -o $OUT $IN</tt></li>
<li> RTF: <tt>unrtf --nopict --text $IN &gt; $OUT</tt></li>
<li> MS Excel: <tt>py_xls2txt $IN &gt; $OUT</tt></li>
<li> any OpenOffice document: <tt>ooo_as_text $IN &gt; $OUT</tt></li>
</ol>

The variable <tt>$IN</tt> denotes the source document and <tt>$OUT</tt>
is the name and location of the converted content in plain text. In
order to capture all possible character encodings, it is always useful 
to convert to a suitable Unicode encoding. I usually use UTF-8 for this
purpose. Converting to UTF-8 from any other encoding works well;
converting from UTF-8 to an encoding having fewer representations of
characters is "lossy" and is usually not precise enough to be useful.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that although some converters can deal with MS Office
documents, it is not the best format for storing information. The format is
still proprietary and you may not use Microsoft's "free" document
specification for any purpose (commercial use is explicitly excluded,
therefore the specs are not free to use). Storing information in these
formats will cause a lot of trouble - especially if the vendor disables old
versions of the format by software updates (this has already happened).
That's a clear and obvious warning, and if you have any word in how to
organise document collections you can avoid a lot of trouble at the
beginning.
</p>

<p>
Having thought about organising the data, we can now consider how to best
index it. This doesn't mean that you are done with thinking about the
organisation of the data - it really is the most important step.
</p>

<h2>
MySQL Natural Language Full-Text Searches
</h2>

<p>
MySQL offers the creation of full text indices; this is described in the
manual in the "Natural Language Full-Text Searches" section. It is an
easy way of indexing text data. Let's say you have the following table:

<pre>
CREATE DATABASE textsearch;
USE textsearch;
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    filename VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
    path VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
    mtime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    content TEXT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci NOT NULL,
    FULLTEXT (filename),
    FULLTEXT (content)
);
</pre>

We'll store the filename, the path information, the file type, and its
converted content in a database table. The <tt>VARCHAR</tt> data type might
be too small if you have big directory trees, but it's more than enough for a
simple example. Every document has a unique ID consisting of the field
<tt>id</tt>. The option <tt>FULLTEXT()</tt> advises MySQL to create a full
text search index over the columns <tt>filename</tt> and <tt>content</tt>.
You can add more columns if you like, but you need to be careful not to
index everything. Adding the <tt>type</tt> column might also be a
reasonable option.
</p>

<p>
Now we need some content - so let's insert a few records for testing.

<pre>
INSERT INTO documents ( filename, path, type, content )
   VALUES ( 'gpl.txt', '/home/pfeiffer', 'Text', 'This program is free software; 
   you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General 
   Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation;' );
INSERT INTO documents ( filename, path, type, content )
   VALUES ( 'fortune.txt', '/home/pfeiffer', 'Text', 'It was all so different 
   before everything changed.' );
INSERT INTO documents ( filename, path, type, content )
   VALUES ( 'lorem.txt', '/home/pfeiffer', 'Text', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
   consectetuer adipiscin...' );
</pre>

<p>
Now you can do a full text search.
</p>

<pre>
mysql&gt; SELECT id,filename FROM documents WHERE MATCH(content) AGAINST('lorem');
+----+----------+
| id | filename |
+----+----------+
|  6 | test.txt |
+----+----------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)

mysql&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The construct <tt>MATCH() AGAINST()</tt> does the full text search for you. MySQL uses
a number to indicate the relevance of the table record. You can show all these rankings
by querying for <tt>MATCH() AGAINST()</tt>.
</p>
<pre>
mysql&gt; SELECT id, filename, MATCH(content) AGAINST('lorem') FROM documents;
+----+-------------+---------------------------------+
| id | filename    | MATCH(content) AGAINST('lorem') |
+----+-------------+---------------------------------+
|  1 | gpl.txt     |                               0 |
|  2 | fortune.txt |                               0 |
|  3 | s3.txt      |                               0 |
|  4 | s4.txt      |                               0 |
|  5 | miranda.txt |                               0 |
|  6 | test.txt    |                0.75862580537796 |
+----+-------------+---------------------------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Obviously, I added a few more rows than described originally. The right
column displays the ranking. Only record 6 has a number greater than 0
because all the other texts lack the word <em>lorem</em>. Now you can add
more texts and see what their rating is like. Note that MySQL uses a
specific strategy when performing full text indexing:
</p>

<ul>
<li> It does not index words with less than 4 characters.
<li> It also does not index any word that appears in more than 50% of the
text lines.
<li> Hyphenated words count as two words.
<li> Any partial words are ignored.
<li> The database engine also maintains a list of common English words (<em>stop words</em>); they are ignored,
too.
</ul>

<p>
Be careful - if your search query consists solely of stop words, you'll
never get any results. If you need a full text search in languages other
than English you can provide your own set of stop words. The documentation
will tell you how to do this.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to search for more than one word. You can add
multiple words separated by commas.
<pre>
SELECT id, filename, MATCH(content) AGAINST('lorem,ipsum') FROM documents;
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
Full Text Search with PostgreSQL
</h2>

<p>
Of course PostgreSQL can also deal with full text searches - a plugin
called <em>Tsearch2</em> is available for PostgreSQL database servers prior
to version 8.3.0 (it's integrated into 8.3.0). Just like for the MySQL
functions, you can fine-tune these according to the language your texts are
written in. The content has to be transformed into tokens, and PostgreSQL
offers new database objects that deal with these operations. The Tsearch2
engine provides text parsers for tokenisation, dictionaries for
normalisation of tokens (and lists of stop words), templates for switching
between parsers or dictionaries, and configurations to use whatever
language you need to. Creating new database objects requires knowledge of C
programming.
</p>
<p>
Let's recreate the example table in PostgreSQL (I use version 8.3.0; if
you have an older version, please install Tsearch2):
<pre>
CREATE TABLE documents (
 id_documents serial,
 filename character varying(254),
 path character varying(254),
 type character varying(254),
 mtime timestamp with time zone,
 content text );
CREATE INDEX documents_idx ON documents USING gin(to_tsvector('english',content));
</pre>

<p>
First we create the table, then we create the text GIN (Generalized
Inverted Index); this type of index consists of distinct <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme"><em>lexemes</em></a>. The
function <tt>to_tsvector()</tt> converts the text stored in the content
column into these normalised words. It uses the English parser and
dictionary. Search queries look like this:
</p>

<pre>
lynx=&gt; SELECT filename,mtime FROM documents WHERE to_tsvector(content) @@ to_tsquery('lorem');
 filename  |            mtime             
-----------+------------------------------
 lorem.txt | 2008-02-26 12:15:16.34584+01
(1 row)

lynx=&gt;
</pre>

<p>
You'd use a normal <tt>SELECT</tt> and the <tt>@@</tt> text match operator. This operator 
compares arguments and the search string converted to lexemes by use of <tt>to_tsvector()</tt>
and <tt>to_tsquery()</tt> functions. The results are returned by the <tt>SELECT</tt> statement.
You can also use ranking in order to sort the results.
</p>

<pre>
lynx=&gt; SELECT filename,mtime,ts_rank(to_tsvector(content),to_tsquery('lorem'))
          FROM documents WHERE to_tsvector(content) @@ to_tsquery('lorem');
 filename  |            mtime             |  ts_rank  
-----------+------------------------------+-----------
 lorem.txt | 2008-02-26 12:15:16.34584+01 | 0.0607927
(1 row)

lynx=&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The tokenisation is one of the crucial parts of a text search, and it's
important to understand the algorithms that Postgres uses to decompose a
string. Consider the following example:
</p>

<pre>
lynx=&gt; SELECT alias, description, token FROM ts_debug('copy a complete database');
   alias   |   description   |  token   
-----------+-----------------+----------
 asciiword | Word, all ASCII | copy
 blank     | Space symbols   |  
 asciiword | Word, all ASCII | a
 blank     | Space symbols   |  
 asciiword | Word, all ASCII | complete
 blank     | Space symbols   |  
 asciiword | Word, all ASCII | database
(7 rows)

lynx=&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The example uses the <tt>ts_debug()</tt> function and shows every token
with its classification.  The text search module understands most of the
common text constructs; it can also decode URLs.
</p>

<pre>
lynx=&gt; SELECT alias, description, token FROM ts_debug('http://linuxgazette.net/145/lg_tips.html');
  alias   |  description  |               token               
----------+---------------+-----------------------------------
 protocol | Protocol head | http://
 url      | URL           | linuxgazette.net/145/lg_tips.html
 host     | Host          | linuxgazette.net
 url_path | URL path      | /145/lg_tips.html
(4 rows)

lynx=&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Now the parser displays the tokens as part of the URL and identifies
them. The tokens allow for better search query processing, and this is
the reason why you have to filter your query string. The text search
compares tokens and not the strings themselves.
</p>

<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>

<p>
I presented only two ways to index text data. This is really only the tip
of the iceberg - there's a lot more to learn about full text searches. Both
MySQL and PostgreSQL have convenient algorithms ready for use that
facilitate finding documents. You can use a simple Perl script with either
one of these database engines, feed them your browser bookmarks and build
an index with the content of the web pages, ready for search queries. There
are many other tools available, and I'll present another way of indexing in
the next part of this series. If you use something different or interesting
to accomplish these tasks, please write and let us know about it!

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.

<h1>Joey's Notes: Setting Up Disk Quotas</h1>

<p>
Setting up disk quotas for users and groups is very important - critically
necessary, in fact, if you don't want to run out of room on the server you
are maintaining. They are commonly used for machines run as Web servers
with ftp access, to prevent any one client from uploading beyond the amount
of space that they have purchased in their contract. Disk quotas can also
be used on Samba servers for users' home directories and NFS filesystems.
Your Linux server can easily be configured to keep your users within
specified limits and to keep them from filling up the partition. Some
people will surf the Internet and download videos and mp3s carelessly
during their lunch breaks, running other users out of space for their work
files. To prevent this kind of activity, we set up user and group quotas to
keep the users within boundaries.  </p> 

<p>
Quotas are set on a per-partition basis, so, if we were going to set them
up on a Web server (or NFS or Samba server), we need to find out if the
area we are concerned with is on its own partition. In this tutorial, we
will examine an ordinary setup with multiple users.
</p> 

<p>
The first step is to find out if our home partition is on a separate
partition - on most production servers, it is on its own partition (a
dedicated partition). So, let's see what our partitioning looks like.  </p> 

<pre>
[root@station17 ~]# df -h
Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sda3             2.9G  205M  2.6G   8% /
/dev/sda1             289M   17M  258M   6% /boot
none                 1013M     0 1013M   0% /dev/shm
/dev/sda5             2.0G   36M  1.9G   2% /tmp
/dev/sda2             9.7G  6.2G  3.1G  67% /usr
/dev/sda7             2.0G  239M  1.6G  13% /var
/dev/sda8             9.2G   54M  8.7G   1% /home
[root@station17 ~]#
</pre> 

<p>
As you can see from the example above, <code>/home</code> is on a dedicated
partition.  We now need to put the mount options into the filesystem table,
<code>/etc/fstab</code>, so whenever the system gets rebooted the quotas
are still active.  </p>

<pre>
[root@station17 ~]#  vi /etc/fstab

 # This file is edited by fstab-sync - see 'man fstab-sync' for details
LABEL=/1                 /          ext3     defaults                        1 1
LABEL=/boot              /boot      ext3     defaults                        1 2
none                     /dev/pts   devpts   gid=5,mode=620                  0 0
none                     /dev/shm   tmpfs    defaults                        0 0
LABEL=/home              /home      ext3     defaults,usrquota,grpquota      1 2
none                     /proc      proc     defaults                        0 0
none                     /sys       sysfs    defaults                        0 0
LABEL=/tmp               /tmp       ext3     defaults                        1 2
LABEL=/usr               /usr       ext3     defaults                        1 2
LABEL=/var               /var       ext3     defaults                        1 2
LABEL=SWAP-sda6          swap       swap     defaults                        0 0
/dev/scd0    /media/cdrecorder      auto     pamconsole,exec,noauto,managed  0 0

[root@station17 ~]#
</pre> 

<p>
In the above example, you can see where I added <code>usrquota</code> and <code>grpquota</code> to
the mount options line, in fstab. Now, to enable use of these extra
options, we need to remount <code>/home</code> with these new options enabled.  </p>

<pre>
[root@station17 ~]# mount -v -o remount /home
/dev/sda8 on /home type ext3 (rw,usrquota,grpquota)
[root@station17 ~]#
</pre> 

<p>
Here, we can see that <code>/home</code> has been remounted with the
additional options of user quotas and group quotas. Using the 'quotacheck'
command, we create our initial disk quota file. Once this command is run,
it will create two files located in the <code>/home</code> directory, named
<code>aquota.user</code> and <code>aquota.group</code>.  They are binary
files that store our quotas. We will want to run it with '-cug' as the
command-line options: the 'c' is to perform a new scan and save it to disk,
the 'u' is for user, and 'g' stands for group. Then, we will turn quotas on
with the 'quotaon' command, specifying which partition we want to activate
quotas on.  </p>

<pre>
[root@station17 ~]# quotacheck -cug /home
[root@station17 ~]# quotaon /home
[root@station17 ~]#
</pre> 

<p>
At this point, we can edit the users' quotas with the 'edquota' command.
This will bring up the 'vi' editor, and we will see some columns that need
a little explaining. The blocks represent the limits for soft and hard size
quotas, and the inodes column is for a quota configuration based on the
number of files a user may create. The soft limit may be exceeded for a
defined grace period, but hitting the hard limit will stop a user dead.
</p>

<p>
Let's create a user and restrict them to a set of quotas, just to see just
how this works. We'll add a user named "sally", and since she 
won't be logging in, we won't give her a password. Next, we
will use the 'edquota' command to edit her quotas and give her some disk
space limits - say, 10 MB soft and 12 MB hard - and write our changes.  </p>

<pre>
[root@station17 ~]# useradd sally
[root@station17 ~]# edquota sally
Disk quotas for user sally (uid 502):
  Filesystem                   blocks       soft       hard     inodes     soft     hard
  /dev/sda8                        24      10000      12000          6        0        0
~
~
</pre>

<p>
Now, sally has a 10MB soft and 12MB hard limit, so we want to switch to
that account and start creating some data. We can do this with the 'dd'
command and <code>/dev/zero</code> to see how this works. The 'dd' command
copies data at a low level, and we will use it here to create a file
quickly.  </p> 

<pre>
[root@station17 ~]# su - sally
[sally@station17 ~]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=data bs=1k count=9500
9500+0 records in
9500+0 records out
9728000 bytes (9.7 MB) copied, 0.0220105 s, 442 MB/s
[sally@station17 ~]$ 
[sally@station17 ~]$ quota
Disk quotas for user sally (uid 502):
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
      /dev/sda8    9544   10000   12000               8       0       0
[sally@station17 ~]$
</pre>

<p>
Here, sally checks her quota, and can see she still has more room to play,
since no warning so far or anything else, so let's make some more data,
and see if we get a warning.  </p>

<pre>
[sally@station17 ~]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=moredata bs=1k count=500
sda8: warning, user block quota exceeded.
500+0 records in
500+0 records out
512000 bytes (512 kB) copied, 0.0034606 s, 148 MB/s
[sally@station17 ~]$
</pre>

<p>
This time, we get a warning. Let's see what our quota would look like if
we were user sally.  </p>

<pre>
[sally@station17 ~]$ quota
Disk quotas for user sally (uid 502):
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
      /dev/sda8   10048*  10000   12000   7days       9       0       0
[sally@station17 ~]$
</pre>  

<p>
Looking at our quota file, we can see we have a grace period that has now
come in to play. Sally has seven days to get under her limit. However,
let's say that sally ignores this -- she doesn't care -- and creates
another file, let's say 3MB, which would put us past our hard limit.
Shall we see what happens?  </p>

<pre>
[sally@station17 ~]$ dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=1k count=3000
sda8: write failed, user block limit reached.
dd: writing `file': Disk quota exceeded
1949+0 records in
1948+0 records out
1994752 bytes (2.0 MB) copied, 0.0251631 s, 79.3 MB/s
[sally@station17 ~]$ quota
Disk quotas for user sally (uid 502):
     Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
      /dev/sda8   12000*  10000   12000            10       0       0
[sally@station17 ~]$
</pre>  

<p>
We can see that sally wrote up to and past the soft limit, since she is
given a grace period by default - but the hard limit stopped her careless
activity cold.  It's a good idea to get familiar with disk quotas, since
they are very common in an enterprise environment, and you will most
definitely run into them.
</p>

<p>
If you have, say, 15 users in a department that
will all be working on the same project, a group quota would be in order.
What if we had just 15 users who were in the same department, but working
separately on different stuff, and were all supposed to get the same
quota? We could use the 'edquota -up' command to copy sally's quotas to
the other users. We could then use the 'repquota' command to see our
users' imposed quota statistics. Let's add a couple of extra
users and then try this out. Once again, we are not giving these users
passwords, because this is just a demonstration.  </p>

<pre>
[sally@station17 ~]$ su -
Password:
[root@station17 ~]# useradd tom 
[root@station17 ~]# useradd dick
[root@station17 ~]# useradd harry
</pre>

<p>
Now that we added some users, we can copy sally's quota to the new users
on the system.  </p>

<pre>
[root@station17 ~]# edquota -up sally tom harry
</pre>

<p>
Here, we can verify that the users' quotas have been carried over to the
users we selected on the system.  </p>

<pre>
[root@station17 ~]# repquota -u /home
*** Report for user quotas on device /dev/sda8
Block grace time: 7days; Inode grace time: 7days
                        Block limits                File limits
User            used    soft    hard  grace    used  soft  hard  grace
----------------------------------------------------------------------
root      --   69832        0       0            4     0     0
sally     +-   11996    10000   12000  5days    10     0     0
tom       --      48    10000   12000           12     0     0
dick      --      24        0       0            6     0     0
harry     --      24    10000   12000            6     0     0
</pre>

<p>
Here, we can see that the imposed limits on sally were copied to the
other users, and we can see our users' current statistics: space
used (blocks), soft and hard limits, even the files used (inodes) and
grace periods.  </p>

<p>
In addition, users who exceed their quotas will usually not be able to
run the X Window System, and if they are running X, they would likely have
other problems, like launching browsers and such.  When copying user
quotas, remember that if you copy a user's quotas to another user that has
been on the system for a while, they may be instantly put over the limit,
so this is an important thing to be aware of. You should always check a
user's disk usage, if they are an existing user. Another point to be
aware of - if the filesystem has quotas already on, be sure to turn them
off prior to executing a quotacheck, because it may damage things.  </p>

<p>
Commands:
</p>
	
<pre>
	quotacheck -- scan a filesystem for disk usage, create, check, and repair quota files
	quotaon ----- turn filesystem quotas on 
	quotaoff ---- turn filesystem quotas off
	edquota ----- edit user quotas
	repquota ---- prints a report of users quota statistics
	quota ------- command to check quota and disk usage statistics
</pre>

Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.

<h1>Fun with Instant Messaging and Ruby</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/unnikrishnan.html">Unnikrishnan KP</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>As we all know, HTTP is the protocol used for communication between
Web servers and Web clients (browsers). Similarly, <a
href="http://www.xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> <a id="unnikrishnan.html_1_back"></a><a href="#unnikrishnan.html_1">[1]</a>
is a protocol for communication
between Instant Messaging (IM) servers and clients. Most of the popular
programming languages like C, Java, Python, etc., have XMPP libraries. Ruby
is my language of choice, because of the ease with which ideas can be
transformed into code.</p>

<p>Ruby also has an XMPP library known as <a
href="http://home.gna.org/xmpp4r/">xmpp4r</a>. There is also a more
abstract <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/xmpp4r-simple/">xmpp4r-simple</a>
library, which was built on top of <code>xmpp4r</code>. Let's use
<code>xmpp4r-simple</code>, as our goals are relatively simple.</p>

<p><code>xmpp4r-simple</code> can be easily installed using <a
href="http://www.rubygems.org/read/chapter/1">Rubygems</a>, Ruby's
packaging system:</p>


<pre>sudo gem install xmpp4r-simple</pre>


<h3>Connecting to GoogleTalk and sending messages</h3>

<p>Lets write a program that: 
<ol>
  <li> connects to the Gtalk server
  <li> authenticates with proper username and password.
  <li> sends an instant message "hello" to a predefined user (a user who
  is already in the friends list).
</ol>
</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="misc/unnikrishnan/chat0.rb">Program1</a>.
Replace the 'gmailusername', 'gmailpassword', and
'destination_gmailusername' in the code with with actual ones. Log in to
destination_username via an Instant Messenger client, then run the program
as: </p>

<pre> $ ruby chat0.rb </pre> 

</p>'Destination user' should now get a "hello" message.</p>


<h3>Receiving Messages - Echo Chat</h3> 

<p>Now, let's look at receiving the messages sent to us by our IM friends;
here is a program that will receive an IM message and simply bounce it
back to the sender. Log in with your username, and keep this program running
for a while. This will baffle your IM friends for sure. <img
	src="../../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p><a href="misc/unnikrishnan/echo_chat.rb">Echo Chat Program</a></p>


<h3>Auto Reply</h3>

<p>Most e-mail providers provide a service called "Auto reply" or "Holiday
mail"; the idea is to send a predefined automated reply to all incoming mails.
Here is a program that implements the same functionality for Instant
Messenger. The program sends a predefined message in reply to every message
it receives from any user. Maybe when you are busy, instead of setting
status as "busy", you can simply run this program, so that it sends some
appropriate reply automatically.</p>

<p><a href="misc/unnikrishnan/auto_reply.rb">Auto Reply Program</a></p>


<h3>Two-way chat program</h3>

<p>Now, let's try a real chat program that can be used to talk to your
friends.</p>

<p><a href="misc/unnikrishnan/normal_chat2.rb">Chat Program 1</a></p>

<p>In this program, user1 sends a message, user2 responds, then it's
user1's turn again, and so on. However, if user1 wants to send a message before
user2 responds, it's not possible - this is a single-threaded program which
will block while waiting for user2's response.</p>

<p>Using 2 separate threads for listening and sending solves this issue.</p>

<p><a href="misc/unnikrishnan/chat_final.rb">Chat Program 2</a></p>

<h3>A Remote Shell with Instant Messenger</h3>

<p>The next test is to run commands on a remote machine and get the results
through Instant Messenger.</p>

<p><a href="misc/unnikrishnan/remote_shell.rb">Remote Shell Program</a></p>

<p>Run the program as "ruby remote_shell.rb" with user1 on a local machine.
Log in as another user into an IM client from a remote machine, and send
"ls" to user1 from that machine. Now, the "ls" command executes on the
user1's remote machine, and the result is sent back. Commands are executed
using the 'system' method, which internally uses an 'exec' system call to
execute the command.</p>

<p>How useful would it be if you could just say "geyser ON" in your IM on
your way home, which turns on the geyser at your home, so that you have
warm water ready by the time you reach home? Theoretically, we can do it
like this:</p>

<p class="editorial">[ I love editing LG. Since the only 'geysers' I knew
of until this point were volcanic in origin, I had to research the Indian
meaning of the term; along the way, I found out that it is pronounced
'gee-zer' (as opposed to the American 'guy-ser' or 'guy-zer'), which leads
to much wordplay when the two cultures collide (what DO you do when a
geezer has a geyser?) In any case - in common Indian parlance, a 'geyser'
is a hot-water heater, usually turned off when one leaves home (solar ones
excluded, presumably.) Waiting for the water to warm up after you've
returned could be annoying - but using the author's ideas as noted in this
article could certainly alleviate the annoyance. On the other hand, if your
friends knew, they could create an even greater annoyance for you by having
a 'cron' job fire it up as soon as you left home - leading to a surprise
gas bill at the end of the month. Which leads us back to ancient computer
history:
<a
href="http://packetstormsecurity.org/unix-humor/Hacking_Bill_Gates_Boiler.txt">"Hax0rin a
boilah"</a>

<img src="../../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /> -- Ben ]</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li> Connect the geyser to your parallel port (not directly, of course -
there should be some relay/switching device in between), so that a TTL 'high'
on one of the parallel port pins turns on the geyser.

<li> Write a simple C program named "geyser" (or maybe in Ruby itself - I am
not sure if we can do it in Ruby directly) that talks to the parallel
port. On running this program with argument 'ON', it should produce a
'high' on one of the parallel port pins, while 'OFF' should make that pin
produce a 'low'.

<li> Now, we can run this "geyser" program through our "IM remote shell".
</ol>
</p>

<h3>IM-based Dictionary Service</h3>

<p>You want to know the French equivalent for the word 'yesterday' - so you
send an IM to your friend 'french-bot', and he immediately sends you back
the French word for "yesterday". Wouldn't that be cool?</p>

<p>Here is your <a
href="misc/unnikrishnan/french_bot1.zip">French-Bot</a>
<img src="../../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>


<h3>Artificial Intelligence and Instant Messaging - Eliza</h3>

<p>Have you talked to Eliza? If not, <a
href="http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza-cgi-bin/eliza_script">try it now</a>. She
is an AI chat bot. Won't it be fun if we could make Eliza talk to your IM
friends, on behalf of ourselves? :)</p>

<P>Since we already have Ruby programs that can talk to IM servers, an
interface to Eliza is the only thing we still need. <a
href="http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza-cgi-bin/eliza_script">Eliza's web
page</a>, shows a plain HTML form, with a text field and a submit button.
The page source shows that the name of the text field is "Entry1". That's
all we need! Here's the Ruby interface for Eliza:</p>

<pre class="code">
def eliza(str)
	response =  Net::HTTP.post_form(URI.parse("http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza-cgi-bin/eliza_script"),{'Entry1'=&gt;str})
	return response.body.split("&lt;/strong&gt;\n").last.split("\n").first
end
</pre>

<p>Hats off to Ruby!!</p>

<p>Now, whenever a chat message arrives, we simply call this 'eliza'
method, get a response string from Eliza, and send it as a reply. Here's
the full Ruby code for the <a href="misc/unnikrishnan/eliza.zip">Eliza chat
program</a>.</p>


<h3>Voice Chat</h3>

<p>'Voice chat' is a little bit of an exaggeration - we are only going to
<strong>hear</strong> the received chat messages, not <strong>talk</strong>
to the program. The idea is to make our IM programs read the received messages
aloud, rather than us having to read it. </p>

<p>We will use a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis">speech synthesis
system</a> to convert the received IM text messages to speech.
<a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">Festival</a> is an
excellent Open Source speech synthesizer that has had some previous

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>These are just a few simple ideas that came to my mind as soon as I
could control my Instant Messenger with my Ruby code. There can be tonnes
of such interesting ideas, which may not be very useful - but fun is
guaranteed. Start hacking!!!</p>

<p> <a id="unnikrishnan.html_1"></a><a href="#unnikrishnan.html_1_back">[1]</a> <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>: It should be
noted that XMPP, the eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, is the
underlying messaging/presence transport protocol of "Jabber" IM clients, 
and that GoogleTalk (mentioned later in this article) is an extension 
of XMPP that adds in VoIP functions.</p>

<p>(The term "Jabber" is now officially deprecated in favour of XMPP, but
persists in common usage anyway.)</p>

<p>Other IM protocols, many of them much more common than XMPP, include
Gadu-Gadu, IRC, MSN Protocol, AOL Instant Messager / ICQ's "OSCAR"
protocol, AOL Instant Messager's TOC and TOC2 protocols, and Yahoo
Messenger's YMSG protocol.  (There are others.)  XMPP is distinctive in
being openly documented, stable, and modern -- along with often serving
as the "glue" among otherwise incompatible services.  A variety of 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Network_Other/im.html">Linux 
client implementations</a> exist for sundry combinations of those
IM protocols, along with a couple of good XMPP/Jabber servers and 
IM-gateway packages.</p>

Hello Answer Guy 
</p>

<p>
I was wondering if it is possible to cool a small amount of  water for
drinking purpose  using a small cilinder of liquid fill nitrogen (by letting
the water around the cilinder) is this possible and how long will the water
remain cool?
</p>

<p>
Thanks

&gt; &gt;  From what I recalled, and as confirmed by Wikipedia, Esperanto is
&gt; &gt;  "...a language lexically predominantly Romanic... the vocabulary derives
&gt; &gt;  primarily from the Romance languages." Seems like the most probable
&gt; &gt;  projection of what you'd get when comparing the two languages is exactly
&gt; &gt;  what you got.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the vocabulary comes from <strong>modern</strong> Romance languages.  Some
&gt; stuff does come directly from Latin ("post" being the most common),
&gt; but it's rare enough that it's an oddity.
&gt; 
&gt; Zamenhof was pretty random in sometimes choosing words in their
&gt; ancient form (post = after, patro = father), sometimes with French
&gt; idiosyncracies (preta = ready, instead of presta), and sometimes with
&gt; German idiosyncracies (lasi = to let, instead of lati), for no

<pre>
&gt; I'm sure there are Russian idiosyncracies too though
&gt; I can't think of any off the top of my head except:
&gt; 
&gt;     okopniki = to be a vicious pirate on the high seas
</pre>

<p>
"Okopniki" - is that plural, like it would be in Russian? I like the
idea, mind you - although I'd have to learn to wear those cheap pirate
earrings [1] and yell "Orr, matey!"
</p>


<pre>
&gt;     perle okopniki = to do the same while using Perl, or in a
&gt; Perl-like manner (e.g., shouting Haiku at your enemies)
