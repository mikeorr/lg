<p>The mail system is - or can be - one of the more complex parts of the
Linux jigsaw puzzle. True, for a lot of folks, it's not complex at all:
they install Netscape, enter their POP/SMTP server names, username, and
password, and off they go... unless, of course, they want to use anything
else that utilizes the mail system - such as writing a script that will
mail them a report when the file system is almost full, or deciding that
they'd like a different Usenet news reader, or even try to mail in a bug
report using the "bug" or "bashbug" utilities. Ooops...
<p>In Unix, mail is closely integrated with the OS itself, and not having
it working properly is like driving a car with a deflated tire. Things
work kinda OK, as long as you don't get up above 5mph, or shift your weight
to the wrong side - or even let your girlfriend get in for a ride. As soon
as you do, problems crop up by the dozen. A working mail system - like
a net connection - is one of the basic assumptions in any Unix-flavored
OS. What I'd like to do here is show you at least one example of a working
mail system, which you can then adjust or interpolate to your own setup;
the important part is being aware of the pieces that need to be operational
in order for this to happen.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>THE PIECES THAT MAKE UP THE WHOLE</b>
<p>The mail system consists of three somewhat loosely defined pieces: the
MUA (Mail User Agent), which is the software you use to read and compose
your mail, the MTA (Mail Transfer Agent), usually an SMTP server, although
some directly-invoked programs are also in use, and a retrieval program
(Some SMTP servers also contain POP functionality, but a stand-alone program.
is more common.) The MUA can be pretty much anything you want: it's only
a front end, meaning that you can use whatever you prefer once the other
two pieces are working. You can even stick with Netscape if you like! For
the other two in this example, I'll use Exim - a well-known MTA, and Eric
S. Raymond's "fetchmail", probably the most-commonly used retrieval utility
in the world.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>GETTING YOUR STUFF</b>
<p>There's not much complexity in setting up "fetchmail". Pretty much all
that's required is creating a file called ".fetchmailrc" in your home directory
and specifying your POP-related information. As an example, here's what
mine looks like:
<p>
<hr>
<pre># I want to log all retrievals to "/var/log/mail.*"
set syslog

# Set stuff that's the same for everybody
defaults&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protocol pop3,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; timeout 300,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nokeep,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fetchall,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mda "procmail -f-"

# Get mail from my ISP
poll "pop.happybruin.com",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user "fuzzybear"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password "wouldnt_you_like_to_know";

# Grab it from my other account
poll "pop3.bearsden.com",&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; user "ben-fuzzybear",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password "shhh_its_a_secret";</pre>

<hr>
<p>Just a quick overview of the above - it's <i>very</i> well covered in
the "fetchmail" man page: I'm retrieving mail from two different accounts.
Since I have a somewhat flaky Net connection (a wireless modem), I've set
"fetchmail" to time out any given connection after 5 minutes (300 seconds).
I've also told it to delete all the mail on the server once it is retrieved
("nokeep"), to ignore the "already read" flag and get all the mail that's
waiting ("fetchall"), and to use "procmail" to do some header processing
for me ("mda ..."). The last is not needed for everyone, but some broken
SMTP servers "forget" to include a so-called "Envelope-from" header, and
this fixes it. Other than that, I think everything is pretty self-explanatory.
<p>There are generally two ways in which fetchmail is launched. It can
be started as one of the "init" scripts (this is useful if you have an
always-on connection), or from your "/etc/ppp/ip-up.d" script (more common
for dial-up connections.) Usually, you get to choose this during "fetchmail"
setup. Each user can also start it manually, as a one-time run (simply
by typing "fetchmail" at the command line) or as a daemon that will poll
the mailboxes at a set interval (I like to do it this way, with a "fetchmail
-d 600" which polls at 10 minute intervals. This can also be defined in
".fetchmailrc".)
<p>"fetchmail" is <i>far</i> more flexible and powerful than this simple
situation shows. Suffice it to say that it can do almost any kind of mail
retrieval, with any valid mail protocol; unless you have some truly complicated
lash-up - and if you did, you'd know about it - it will work for you. Of
course, if you have your own preferred retrieval agent, that's fine too.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE</b>
<p>Setting up your SMTP server doesn't necessarily have to be much more
complex than the above - but it definitely should take a lot more thought.
The main thing to consider is, where do you fit into the Net? For those
of you who have never had to think of yourself on that large of a scale,
that's yet another piece of the puzzle: the reality is that most of the
Net is built up of little pieces - such as the computer that you're sitting
in front of right now. Your ISP is just another node of the Net; true,
you're connecting through their routers, but once you <i>have</i> connected,
you're just as much a part of the Net as they are - and consequently, responsible
for making sure that your little piece works in harmony with the rest.
<p>(One of the security-related RFCs I read recently - I don't recall exactly
which one - mentions that possibly 50%+ of the mail servers connected to
the Net are misconfigured to some degree. Pretty scary statistic... but
also quite a testament to the reliability and flexibility of the Net mail
system. All of this points up the need for all of us to contribute to the
Good Side of the Force - by doing our part.)
<p>For a lot of us, the situation is very simple: a desktop machine, a
single ISP, and no need to do our own SMTP - at least any more than is
necessary to forward all our mail to the ISP's SMTP server. In this situation,
pretty much any MTA will do - and there's next to no tweaking necessary,
except for address rewriting. Just answer the questions that you're asked
at setup time, and - bingo, you're off and running. However, this part
of the system is a little more "touchy" when it comes to changes: if you
use more than one ISP, or want to do anything else even slightly different
from the basics, it's going to take a little configuration... and this
is where most folks run afoul of the mail beast.
<p>
<hr>
<pre>&nbsp; "sendmail"'s configuration file looks like someone's been banging their
&nbsp; head on the keyboard. And after looking at it... I can see why!
&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Anonymous</pre>

<hr>
<p>"sendmail.cf" has been responsible for more than one sysadmin being
dragged away while tied down to a stretcher and foaming at the mouth. It's
an ugly creature... and the configuration file that it's created from isn't
any prettier. I've detailed a bit of its workings back in LG#58 
(<A HREF="../issue58/okopnik2.html">Configuring
Sendmail in RedHat 6.2, or My Adventure in the Heart of the Jungle</A>); at
this point, I have the twitching mostly under control, and the doctors
tell me that I can stop taking these little pills in another year or so...
<p>Seriously, this is a decision point. If your system's network connection
is going to change in major ways (ISP, host name, from a dial-up to a full-on
Internet host) more than once or twice, you should consider doing your
own SMTP. As an example, I do my own because I travel for a living, and
use <i>lots</i> of different ISPs (dial-up, wireless, cable modems in hotel
rooms, etc.) in many different system configurations. Doing it this way
means never having to worry about what anyone else's mail setup is like,
or having to configure anything when I move from one system to another
- a great convenience. In other words, doing your own is not a big deal
to implement, but it is a critical decision that should be made based on
your own needs. I find the "do-it-yourself" approach to be far more flexible,
powerful, and hassle-free in all cases where the environment is anything
other than static.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>SMTP SETUP OPTIONS</b>
<p>So, at this point, we've defined two typical SMTP setups:
<p>1) Delegate everything except address rewriting (that has to be done
locally.) The ISPs SMTP server (the "smarthost", from our perspective)
takes care of all the routing. This is a good way to go when you have a
static setup that's not likely to change, especially through a major ISP
with a good reliability record (well, we can dream, can't we?)
<p>2) Do everything ourselves. This has a number of benefits, including
bypassing unreliable ISP mail services and the ability to instantly see
if your mail has actually been delivered to the host on the other end (a
few years ago, my ISP held some of my emails for <b>over a week</b>, and
discarded a batch of them <i>without</i> notifying me. That was what initially
started me doing this...)
<p>Generally, this is a decision that's made during the installation of
the MTA (Mail Transfer Agent). There's not much to it; in the case of Exim,
you're given five choices, of which only the first two really apply here
(the "eximconfig" program runs during the installation, or may be re-run
manually at any time):
<p>
<hr>
<pre>You must choose one of the options below:

&nbsp;(1) Internet site; mail is sent and received directly using SMTP. If your
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; needs don't fit neatly into any category, you probably want to start
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with this one and then edit the config file by hand.

&nbsp;(2) Internet site using smarthost: You receive Internet mail on this&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; machine, either directly by SMTP or by running a utility such as&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fetchmail. Outgoing mail is sent using a smarthost. optionally with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addresses rewritten. This is probably what you want for a dialup
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system.
&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</pre>

<hr>
<p>Note that these two choices fit the above two options: the "do everything
ourselves" approach dovetails into #1, and the "smarthost" version is #2.
"eximconfig" then walks you through a few more questions, one of which
is
<p>
<hr>
<pre>...

Which user account(s) should system administrator mail go to?
Enter one or more usernames separated by spaces or commas.&nbsp; Enter
`none' if you want to leave this mail in `root's mailbox - NB this
is strongly discouraged.&nbsp; Also, note that usernames should be lowercase!</pre>

<hr>Since you're the one who's configuring the system, I assume you'll
also be the one administering it, so you should direct this to your own
username. If you go the "smarthost" route, you'll be asked for the name
of the smarthost; be sure to enter your ISP's SMTP server name correctly.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>THE BELLY OF THE BEAST</b>
<p>Once that's done - and we'll get to what else we need to do in the two
different cases - we need to set up address rewriting. After all, your
email address as seen by the system is "username@host", and unless you
have your own domain, that isn't going to be an Internet-valid address.
Fortunately, with Exim, it's not difficult.
<p>First, we'll edit "/etc/exim/exim.conf", and add the following to the
6th section ("REWRITE CONFIGURATION"):
<br>
<hr>
<pre>*@localhost&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ${lookup{$1}lsearch{/etc/email-addresses}\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {$value}fail} Ffsr
<hr WIDTH="100%"></pre>

This will search through the file where the rewriting rules are specified,
and change the addresses as necessary. Note that in some cases, "exim.conf"
will already have a line like this; just make sure that everything, particularly
the "Ffsr" flags (which rewrite the "Envelope-from", "From:", "Sender:",
and "Reply-to:" headers), is correct. Next, we'll edit - surprise! - "/etc/email-addresses"
and insert the entries for all our users.
<br>
<hr>
<pre># Root shouldn't be emailing anyone outside, but just in case...
root: happybear@bruins.com
ben: happybear@bruins.com
rivka: sweetie@here.com
linda: babe@westcoast.org
jen: saucy@wench.net
<hr WIDTH="100%"></pre>

That's it. Unlike "sendmail", there are no databases to rebuild; the file
is read "on the fly". One of the reasons I like Exim is because its conffile
is copiously documented with comments. As well, "/usr/share/doc/exim/spec.txt.gz"
is a complete (and very large) manual that details every bit of the configuration
in fine detail.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES</b>
<p>If you're going with the "smarthost" option, at this point you're done.
Skip ahead to the "TESTING" section. If you're a do-it-yourselfer like
me, though, there's just a tiny bit more stuff to write: since we're now
responsible for getting the mail to where it's going, we also have to deal
with the situation when the delivery fails (i.e., the receiving host or
an intermediate router is down, we lose the network connection for a moment,
etc.) Most of that behavior is well-defined already, as it is in any decent
MTA, but I've found one thing that reduces "trouble emails" from Exim (which
it will send to you as the administrator) to nearly zero: in the first
section of "/etc/exim/exim.conf", you should add the following:
<pre>
<hr>auto_thaw = 5m
<hr WIDTH="100%"></pre>

Whenever a message is marked "frozen" (undeliverable) by Exim, this will
"thaw" it (reattempt delivery) after five minutes. Since most failures
are only temporary, this setting manages to "push" mail through almost
a hundred percent of the time, as long as the user and the domain are valid.
<p>Oh, by the way. Now that you're a Big-Time Mail Administrator... :)
what is it, exactly, that you're supposed to do? Not that much, actually.
Decide what to do with problem messages (if Exim notifies you that something
is stuck in the queue, run "<tt>mailq</tt>" to see what it is and look
at its log file with "<tt>exim -Mvl &lt;message_id&gt;</tt>"), add new users
to "<tt>/etc/email-addresses</tt>", and respond to any problem or spam
notifications by other folks. Read the "exim" man page, just to get familiar
with this beast. That's pretty much it. Experienced large-system mail administrators
may shrink in horror and make warding signs in my direction, but for a
single-machine or a small LAN, the above is pretty much all that's required.
Once properly set up, a mail system is a remarkably trouble-free and mostly
self-correcting sort of creature.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>TESTING</b>
<p>Exim has a series of built-in testing modes, one of which is about to
come in very handy. The main thing that we need to test is whether our
rewriting rules work - and that's simple:
<p>
<hr>
<pre>Baldur:~$ exim -brw ben
&nbsp; sender: happybear@bruins.com
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from: happybear@bruins.com
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to: ben@localhost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cc: ben@localhost
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bcc: ben@localhost
reply-to: happybear@bruins.com
env-from: happybear@bruins.com
&nbsp; env-to: ben@localhost</pre>

<hr>Test it with a bare username, "user@localhost", and user@your_hostname;
all of these should be properly rewritten. Also, test it with an arbitrary
Internet-valid email address to make sure that it <i>doesn't</i> get changed.
<p>Once all of the above works right, your mail system should be at least
reasonably configured (the folks who set up the various distros do a pretty
good job of the basics, in every case I've seen so far.) Test it out by
sending yourself some mail, and look at the headers; the "From:" and the
"Reply-to:" (if one is defined) should match your Net-valid address, not
just your plain user name. Here's an example (the actual addresses/IPs
have been changed, as in the rest of this article, to foil spambots. Eat
fake address, spammer-slime!):
<br>In the Mutt composition menu:
<hr>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: "Benjamin A. Okopnik" &lt;ben@localhost&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To: Benjamin Okopnik &lt;happybear@bruins.com&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cc:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bcc:
&nbsp;Subject: Rewrite test
Reply-To:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fcc: =Sentmail
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mix: &lt;no chain defined&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PGP: Clear


<hr WIDTH="100%"></pre>
Note that in the local client, the "From:" address is a local one. You
could also - now that you have a <b>real</b> mail system - simply do it
from the command line as
<p>
<hr>
<pre>mail -s "Rewrite test" happybear@bruins.com
<hr WIDTH="100%"></pre>

<p><br>Either way - now, we send it off, and when we get it back - presto!

Reading the routing info from the bottom up, Exim got the message from
me, rewrote the header, and bruins.com got it from Exim, so all of that
was done correctly - meaning that what my MTA says is properly recognized
by others. If the email had disappeared, I would check my "/var/log/exim/mainlog"
to see exactly what had been done to it, and perhaps my queue to see if
it's stuck. However, it looks like all the Deep Magic is good, and everything
is working.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>WRAP-UP</b>
<p>If you've followed along and made it this far... congratulations. You're

I'm glad to share the IP-space with the likes of you.
<p>Be well, and happy Linuxing!
