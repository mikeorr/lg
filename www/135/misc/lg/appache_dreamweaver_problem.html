Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I am facing a really critical problem since last one weak. 
My server is running XAMPP for linux. 
Now the users are accessing the server and doing their
project work using dreamweaver from win PC.
</p>

<p>
but frequently they see the message "This file has been
modified outside of Dreamweaver. Do you want to reload it"
</p>

<p>
I am 100% confirm that there is no one elese who is working
on a particular file. if they accept yes all their
modification has been lost.
Is there any problem in the Linux server or Xampp ?
</p>

<p>
has any one experienced such a problem ? please suggest.
thanks.
</p>

<p>

What does this have to do with Linux?
</p>

<p>
Let's recap what is happening. One of your users uses a Wind0ws
application, "Dreamweaver", to "open" (really to download and edit a
temporary copy) a file from your server. That is, some fraction of a
second after they click "Edit", your server is out of the loop: once it
sends that file, it doesn't have anything to do with your user.
</p>

<p>
So, that user - on that Wind0ws machine, and using a Wind0ws app - opens
a temporary file somewhere in the Wind0ws filesystem. Some time later,
the Wind0ws application pops up a Wind0ws dialog about a modified file.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Linux is at fault because it's in the same building?

Quoting j.bakshi@icmail.net (j.bakshi@icmail.net):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; My server is running XAMPP for linux. 
</pre>

<p>
Just for clarification's sake, XAMPP is not a single thing in itself,
but rather a preconfigured bundle of Apache httpd, MySQL, PHP, Perl,
ProFTPd, OpenSSL, gdbm, SQLite, gettext, mcrypt, Freetype2, 
IMAP C-Client, phpMyAdmin, and a bunch of support libs.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Now the users are accessing the server and doing their
&gt; project work using dreamweaver from win PC.
&gt; 
&gt; but frequently they see the message "This file has been
&gt; modified outside of Dreamweaver. Do you want to reload it"
</pre>

<p>
Well, use basic troubleshooting to try to determine what's going on.
Use the Dreamweaver client to check in a file.  Figure out where it's
getting stored.  If it's being stored in a MySQL table (which would be
odd, but conceivable), you'll need to hunt it down there, and check 
the values in that record.  If it's a regular file (which seems a lot
more likely), take note of its size and modification time stamp -- and
you might want to just make a copy of it in /tmp or somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Now, attempt to replicate the problem:  Modify your local workstation
copy in Dreamweaver, then try to check it in.  Does Dreamweaver now
claim that the server's copy has been modified?  If so, <em>has</em> it been 
modified?  What modifications?
</p>

<p>
If Dreamweaver claims the server-end copy has been modified, and yet you
verify that it hasn't, then you have a Dreamweaver problem and need to
concentrate on that.  If Dreamweaver <em>doesn't</em> claim that the server-end
copy's changed, then you haven't yet relicated the symptom, and need to
keep trying until you figure out how.  (Problems whose symptoms you
cannot replicate are difficult to solve, as you cannot observe them.)
</p>

<p>
If Dreamweaver claims the server-end file's changed, and you <em>confirm</em>
that it's changed, now you need to study your server setup -- and the
nature of the changes made, when they were made, etc. -- to figure out
what's changing the file, and why.
</p>

<p>
See?  It's not magic.  I didn't need to know anything in particular
about the XAMPP bundle, to give you that analysis.  It's just basic 
everyday troubleshooting:  Break large problems into a series of smaller
problems, identify suspects, eliminate variables, stop periodically to 
assess what you know and what you don't, carefully introduce changes to
the test scenario to observe what results, that sort of thing.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; has any one experienced such a problem ? 
</pre>

<p>
When you ask questions about highly specialised configurations, it's
really, really unlikely that anyone's experienced the same problem,
because it's highly unlikely anyone's running the same environment.
</p>

<p>
E.g, I have plenty of experience with Apache httpd, MySQL, PHP, Perl,
and phpMyAdmin -- but zero experience with Dreamweaver and zero with the
megabundle you're wrestling with.  Others here probably are in a similar
situation.  So, my point is:  You're not asking a very useful question
when you ask, in effect, is there anyone here who's running the very
same thing I am and has encountered this exact same problem?  You're
extremely likely to get null answers, which means your question was a
waste of your and others' time.
