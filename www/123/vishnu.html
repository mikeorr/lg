<h1>Configuring Apache for Maximum Performance</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/vishnu.html">Vishnu Ram V</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>1 Introduction</h3>
<p>
Apache is an open-source HTTP server implementation. It is the most
popular web server on the Internet; the December 2005 Web Server Survey
conducted by Netcraft [<a href="vishnu.html#NET">1</a>] shows that
about 70% of the web sites on Internet are using Apache.
</p>

<p>
Apache server performance can be improved by adding additional
hardware resources such as RAM, faster CPU, etc. But most of the time,
the same result can be achieved by custom configuration of the server.
This article looks into getting maximum performance out of Apache with
the existing hardware resources, specifically on Linux systems. Of course,
it is assumed that there is <em>enough</em> hardware resources - especially
enough RAM that the server isn't swapping frequently. First two sections
look into various Compile-Time and Run-Time configuration options. The
Run-Time section assumes that Apache is compiled with <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/prefork.html">prefork</a> MPM.
HTTP compression and caching is discussed next. Finally, using separate
servers for serving static and dynamic contents is covered. Basic
knowledge of compiling and configuring Apache and Linux are assumed.
</p>

<h3>2 Compile-Time Configuration Options</h3>
<h4>2.1 Load only the required modules:</h4>
<p>
The Apache HTTP Server is a modular program where the administrator can
choose the functions to be included in the server by selecting a set of
modules [<a href="vishnu.html#DSO">2</a>]. The modules can be compiled either
statically as part of the 'httpd' binary, or as Dynamic Shared Objects
(DSOs). DSO modules can either be compiled when the server is built, or
added later via the <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/apxs.html">apxs</a>
utility, which allows compilation at a later date. The 
mod_so module must be statically compiled into the Apache core to
enable DSO support.
</p>

<p>
Run Apache with only the required modules. This reduces the memory
footprint, which improves the server performance. Statically compiling
modules will save RAM that's used for supporting dynamically loaded
modules, but you would have to recompile Apache to add or remove a module.
This is where the DSO mechanism comes handy. Once the mod_so module is
statically compiled, any other module can be added or dropped using the
'LoadModule' command in the 'httpd.conf' file. Of course, you will have to
compile the modules using 'apxs' if they weren't compiled when the server
was built.
</p>

<h4>2.2 Choose appropriate MPM:</h4>
<p>
The Apache server ships with a selection of Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs)
which are responsible for binding to network ports on the machine,
accepting requests, and dispatching children to handle the requests [<a
 href="vishnu.html#MPM">3</a>]. Only one MPM can be loaded into the
server at any time.
</p>

<p>
Choosing an MPM depends on various factors, such as whether the OS
supports threads, how much memory is available, scalability versus
stability, whether non-thread-safe third-party modules are used, etc.
</p>

<p>
Linux systems can choose to use a threaded MPM like <a
 href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/worker.html">worker</a> or
a non-threaded MPM like <a
 href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/prefork.html">prefork</a>:
</p>

<p>
The <em>worker</em> MPM uses multiple child processes. It's multi-threaded within
each child, and each thread handles a single connection. Worker is fast
and highly scalable and the memory footprint is comparatively low. It's
well suited for multiple processors. On the other hand, worker is less
tolerant of faulty modules, and a faulty thread can affect all the
threads in a child process.
</p>

<p>
The <em>prefork</em> MPM uses multiple child processes, each child handles one
connection at a time. Prefork is well suited for single or double CPU
systems, speed is comparable to that of worker, and it's highly tolerant
of faulty modules and crashing children - but the memory usage is high,
and more traffic leads to greater memory usage.
</p>

<h3>3 Run-Time Configuration Options</h3>
<h4>3.1 DNS lookup:</h4>
<p>
The HostnameLookups directive enables DNS lookup so that hostnames can
be logged instead of the IP address. This adds latency to every request
since the DNS lookup has to be completed before the request is
finished. HostnameLookups is Off by default in Apache 1.3 and above.
Leave it Off and use post-processing program such as <a
 href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/logresolve.html">logresolve</a>
to resolve IP addresses in Apache's access logfiles. Logresolve
ships with Apache.
</p>

<p>
When using 'Allow from' or 'Deny from' directives, use an IP address
instead of a domain name or a hostname. Otherwise, a double DNS lookup
is performed to make sure that the domain name or the hostname is not
being spoofed.
</p>

<h4>3.2 AllowOverride:</h4>
<p>
If AllowOverride is not set to 'None', then Apache will attempt to open
the .htaccess file (as specified by AccessFileName directive) in each
directory that it visits. 
For example:

<pre class="code">
DocumentRoot /var/www/html
&lt;Directory /&gt;
AllowOverride all
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If a request is made for URI /index.html, then Apache will attempt
to open /.htaccess, /var/.htaccess, /var/www/.htaccess, and
/var/www/html/.htaccess. These additional file system lookups add to
the latency. If .htaccess is required for a particular directory, then
enable it for that directory alone.
</p>

<h4>3.3 FollowSymLinks and SymLinksIfOwnerMatch:</h4>
If FollowSymLinks option is set, then the server will follow symbolic
links in this directory. If SymLinksIfOwnerMatch is set, then the
server will follow symbolic links only if the target file or directory
is owned by the same user as the link.
</p>

<p>
If SymLinksIfOwnerMatch is set, then Apache will have to issue
additional system calls to verify whether the ownership of the link and
the target file match. Additional system calls are  also needed
when FollowSymLinks is NOT set.<br>
For example:

<pre class="code">
DocumentRoot /var/www/html
&lt;Directory /&gt;
Options SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>

For a request made for URI /index.html, Apache will perform lstat()
on /var, /var/www, /var/www/html, and /var/www/html/index.html. These
additional system calls will add to the latency. The lstat results are
not cached, so they will occur on every request.
</p>

<p>
For maximum performance, set FollowSymLinks everywhere and
never set SymLinksIfOwnerMatch. Or else, if SymLinksIfOwnerMatch is
required for a directory, then set it for that directory alone.<br>
</p>

<h4>3.4 Content Negotiation:</h4>
<p>
Avoid content negotiation for fast response. If content negotiation is
required for the site, use type-map files rather than Options
MultiViews directive. With MultiViews, Apache has to scan the directory
for files, which adds to the latency.
</p>

<h4>3.5 MaxClients:</h4>
<p>
The MaxClients sets the limit on maximum simultaneous requests that can
be supported by the server; no more than this number of child
processes are spawned. It shouldn't be set too low; otherwise, an
ever-increasing number of connections are deferred to the queue and
eventually time-out while the server resources are left unused. Setting
this too high, on the other hand, will cause the server to start swapping
which will cause the response time to degrade drastically.  The appropriate
value for MaxClients can be calculated as:
<br>
<br>
[<a href="vishnu.html#MAXCLI">4</a>] 
MaxClients = Total RAM dedicated to the web server / Max child process size
<br>
<br>
The child process size for serving static file is about 2-3M. For
dynamic content such as PHP, it may be around 15M. The RSS column <br>
in
"<code>ps -ylC
httpd --sort:rss</code>" shows non-swapped physical memory usage by
Apache processes in kiloBytes.
</p>

<p>
If there are more concurrent users than MaxClients, the requests will
be queued up to a number based on ListenBacklog directive. Increase
ServerLimit to set MaxClients above 256.<br>
</p>

<h4>3.6 MinSpareServers, MaxSpareServers, and StartServers:</h4>
<p>
MaxSpareServers and MinSpareServers determine how many child processes
to keep active while waiting for requests. If the MinSpareServers is too low
and a bunch of requests come in, Apache will have to spawn additional child
processes to serve the requests. Creating child processes is relatively
expensive. If the server is busy creating child processes, it won't be able
to serve the client requests immediately.  MaxSpareServers shouldn't be set
too high: too many child processes will consume resources unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
Tune MinSpareServers and MaxSpareServers so that Apache need
not spawn more than 4 child processes per second (Apache can
spawn a maximum of 32 child processes per second). When more than 4
children are spawned per second, a message will be logged in the
ErrorLog.
</p>

<p>The StartServers directive sets the number of child server
processes created on startup. Apache will continue creating child
processes until the MinSpareServers setting is reached. This doesn't have
much effect on performance if the server isn't restarted frequently. If
there are lot of requests <em>and</em> Apache is restarted frequently, set
this to a relatively high value.<br>
</p>

<h4>3.7 MaxRequestsPerChild:</h4>
<p>
The MaxRequestsPerChild directive sets the limit on the number of
requests that an individual child server process will handle. After
MaxRequestsPerChild requests, the child process will die. It's set to 0
by default, the child process will never expire. It is appropriate to set
this to a value of few thousands. This can help prevent memory leakage,
since the process dies after serving a certain number of requests. Don't
set this too low, since creating new processes does have overhead.
</p>

<h4>3.8 KeepAlive and KeepAliveTimeout:</h4>
<p>
The KeepAlive directive allows multiple requests to be sent over the
same TCP connection. This is particularly useful while serving HTML
pages with lot of images. If KeepAlive is set to Off, then for each
images, a separate TCP connection has to be made. Overhead due to
establishing TCP connection can be eliminated by turning On KeepAlive.
</p>

<p>KeepAliveTimeout determines how long to wait for the next request. Set
this to a low value, perhaps between two to five seconds. If it is set
too high, child processed are tied up waiting for the client when they
could be used for serving new clients.
</p>

<h3>4 HTTP Compression &amp; Caching<br></h3>
<p>
HTTP compression is completely specified in HTTP/1.1. The server
uses either the gzip or the deflate encoding method to the response payload
before it is sent to the client. Client then decompresses the payload.
There is no need to install any additional software on the client side
since all major browsers support these methods. Using compression will save
bandwidth and improve response time; studies have found a mean 
gain of %75.2 when using compression [<a href="vishnu.html#COMPRS">5</a>].
</p>

<p>
HTTP Compression can be enabled in Apache using the <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_deflate.html">mod_deflate</a>
module. Payload is compressed only if the browser requests compression,
otherwise uncompressed content is served. A compression-aware browser
inform the server that it prefer compressed content through the HTTP
request header - "<code>Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate</code>". Then the
server responds with compressed payload and the response header set to
"<code>Content-Encoding: gzip</code>".
</p>

<p>
The following example uses telnet to view request and
response headers:

<pre class="code">
bash-3.00$ telnet www.webperformance.org 80
Trying 24.60.234.27...
Connected to www.webperformance.org (24.60.234.27).
Escape character is '^]'.
HEAD / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.webperformance.org
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 31 Dec 2005 02:29:22 GMT
Server: Apache/2.0
X-Powered-By: PHP/5.1.1
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Expires: Sat, 31 Dec 2005 02:29:22 GMT
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 20
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
</pre>

In caching, a copy of the data is stored at the client or in a proxy server
so that it need not be retrieved frequently from the server. This will save
bandwidth, decrease load on the server, and reduce latency.  Cache control
is done through HTTP headers. In Apache, this can be accomplished through
<a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_expires.html">mod_expires</a>
and <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_headers.html">mod_headers</a>
modules. There is also server side caching, in which the most
frequently-accessed content is stored in memory so that it can be served
fast. The module <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_cache.html">mod_cache</a>
can be used for server side caching; it is production stable in Apache
version 2.2.
</p>

<h3>5 Separate server for static and dynamic content</h3>
<p>
Apache processes serving dynamic content take from 3MB to 20MB of RAM.
The size grows to accommodate the content being served and never decreases
until the process dies. As an example, let's say an Apache process grows to
20MB while serving some dynamic content. After completing the request, it is
free to serve any other request. If a request for an image comes in, then
this 20MB process is serving static content - which could be served just as
well by a 1MB process. As a result, memory is used inefficiently.
</p>

<p>
Use a tiny Apache (with minimum modules statically compiled) as the
front-end server to serve static contents. Requests for dynamic content
should be forwarded to the heavy-duty Apache (compiled with all required
modules). Using a light front-end server has the advantage that the static
contents are served fast without much memory usage and only the dynamic
contents are passed over to the big server.
</p>

<p>
Request forwarding can be achieved by using <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html">mod_proxy</a>
and <a
href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html">mod_rewrite</a>
modules. Suppose there is a lightweight Apache server listening to port
80 and a heavyweight Apache listening on port 8088. Then the
following configuration in the lightweight Apache can be used to
forward all requests (except requests for images) to the heavyweight server:<br>

[<a href="vishnu.html#LSH">9</a>]<br>
<pre class="code">
ProxyPassReverse / http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8088/
RewriteEngine on                                            
RewriteCond  %{REQUEST_URI} !.*\.(gif|png|jpg)$
RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://%{HTTP_HOST}:8088/$1 [P]
</pre>

All requests, except for images, will be proxied to the backend server.
The response is received by the frontend server and supplied to
the client. As far as client is concerned, all the responses seem
to come from a single server.
</p>

<h3>6 Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Configuring Apache for maximum performance is tricky; there are no hard
and fast rules. Much depends on understanding the web server requirements
and experimenting with various available options. Use tools like <a
 href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html">ab</a> and <a
 href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/httperf/">httperf</a> to
measure the web server performance. Lightweight servers such as <a
 href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/tux/">tux</a> or <a
 href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/">thttpd</a> can also be used as
the front-end server. If a database server is used, make sure it is
optimized so that it won't create any bottlenecks. In
case of MySQL, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mtop">mtop</a>
can be used to monitor slow queries.  Performance of PHP scripts
can be improved by using a PHP caching product such as <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/turck-mmcache/">Turck MMCache</a>.
It eliminates overhead due to compiling by caching the PHP scripts in a
compiled state.
