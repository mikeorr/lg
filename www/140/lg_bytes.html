<h3>News in General</h3>


<h4>First Linux Collaboration Summit Held at Google</h4>

<p>Linux superstars, corporate heavyweights, and major customers all
converged on the Mountain View Googleplex for the first of many
Collaboration Summits. Hosted by the new Linux Foundation, the 3-day
event focused on developer issues and, as Linux Foundation CEO Jim
Zemlin stated, the sausage-making aspects of the open source
ecosystem.</p>

<p>Although it started just after the announcement of Linspire
partnering with Microsoft on multimedia support and patent IP (see
below), conference organizers steered away from discussing the new
Microsoft partnerships and potentially polarizing headlines. Instead,
the focus was on working together on common goals. "They're projecting
fear, uncertainty, and doubt. Let's come up with the things to move this
platform ahead," Zemlin told attendees on the first day, which was open
to journalists. After a public day with keynotes and press statements,
the Collaboration Summit continued behind closed doors, and with blog
silence.</p>

<p>The Linux Foundation hosted the Summit to bring together the diverse
elements of the Linux community, and encourage face-to-face dialog.
Among the aims behind the creation of the Linux Foundation was to foster
innovation and act as a catalyst in the development of the open source
software ecosystem. To some extent, the rapid acceptance of Linux and
the diversity of projects has greatly enlarged what used to be a tight
group of people, and better means of coordination and problem solving
needs to be encouraged</p>

<p>Here's a link to the completed Summit schedule:<br>
<a href="https://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Agenda_and_Schedule">https://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Agenda_and_Schedule</a>
</p>

<p>The conference wiki is still bare, but here are a few of the Summit
highlights:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>Marc Shuttleworth (of Canonical and Ubuntu fame) praised the
collaborative nature of the open source community and the tools
developed to help coordinate work on OS projects, but said more work
needed to be done to foster sharing and collaboration between existing
projects and their respective communities.</p>

<p>"Collaboration is an easy term to say, but it's hard to do. We often
don't know whom to talk to, upstream, so the question is: how can we make
collaboration better?", Shuttleworth asked.</p>

<p>Later in his keynote, he emphasized the importance of getting timely
patches out to Linux users. He also cautioned against viewing the
differences between the open source community and the Microsoft world as
a new Cold War. He said it was more about the underlying ideas than
about the personalities and companies. [What was the term from the
1960s? "Peaceful Co-existence"?]</p>

<li>
<p>Some discussion continued on the third version of the GPL. The
attending kernel developers were reported to be polite but unswerving in
their desire to continue with GPL v2. The consensus seemed to be to
wait, and see how adoption of GPL v3 goes in the application space,
first.</p>

<li>
<p>Brian Aker, Director of Architecture at MySQL, led a discussion
on issues with implementation of Linux threads that had users reverting
to earlier kernel versions (or even switching to versions of Solaris).
This also touched on issues with variation between distros.</p>

<li>
<p>Efforts were also coordinated for better device drivers,
especially printer drivers. LF announced a new LSB driver development
kit at the Summit. According Zemlin, "The LSB print driver development
kit is exactly the kind of work we can expedite as a united community of
developers, vendors, and users. We all know we have to make it extremely
easy for printing manufacturers to target Linux.  This kit will reduce
the effort it takes for them to take advantage of the tremendous
opportunity Linux represents, and will help users 'just print' while
using the Linux desktop and printer of their choice."</p>

<li>
<p>There was also recognition that, with the open-sourcing of
many development tools, toolmakers are reluctant to invest in
frameworks and integration tools that match the utility and
sophistication of Microsoft's Visual Studio suite. Eclipse goes part of
the distance, but has to accommodate multiple developer needs and
overlapping development models. Developers and ISVs have too many
choices and too few standards.</p>
</ul>

enhancements:<br>

<h4>Canonical Provides Details for Ubuntu for Mobile Internet Devices</h4>

<p>Canonical Ltd., the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu, announced more
details on Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded Edition, at Computex 2007 in
Taipei. Following discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit in Seville,
Spain, and a great response from its developer community generally, the
target specifications and technical milestones for the project have been
agreed. (With recent patches that support real-time processing in the
kernel, some 50-60% of new mobile phones will be based on embedded
Linux.)</p> 

<p>Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded Edition will provide a rich Internet
experience for users of Intel's 2008 Mobile Internet Device (MID)
platform. To achieve this, Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded will run video,
support sound, and offer fast and rich browsing experiences to the MID
target user. Optimized for MIDs based on Intel's low power processors
and chipsets, Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded edition is expected to deliver
fast boot and resume times, and reside in a small memory and disk
footprint.</p>

<p>"We are delighted with the progress of the Ubuntu Mobile and Embedded
Edition", commented Jane Silber, Director of Operations at Canonical. "We
have had a great response to our first announcement, with many developers
showing interest in the project. With a clear roadmap, an active
developer community, and a date for release, we look forward to bringing
Ubuntu to Mobile Internet Devices."</p>

<p>The first full release of the software will be available in October
2007. Working collaboratively with Intel, Canonical is working to
deliver software on actual devices in 2008.</p>

<p>(While this is, independently, good for Ubuntu and many mobile
developers, large companies and ISPs continue to be concerned about the
large number of Linux mobility platforms and lack of overarching
standards. This is being noted increasingly at analyst events, and by
companies such as Gartner and the 451 Group.)</p>


<h4>Massive Multi-Web Site Attack Sweeps Europe, Enters US</h4>

<p>Over 10,000 Web sites have been compromised by the "Mpack" hacker
kit, and upwards of 100,000 user systems have had malware installed. The
majority of compromised Web sites are in Italy, but the US has the third
highest number of infected Web sites.</p>

<p>The multiexploit "Mpack" is a Russian collection of PHP script
exploits that also collects statistics on the individual exploits.
The hacked sites usually have additional IFRAME code embedded within the
HTML source code, referencing the exploit server. Users are redirected to
Web pages that download keyloggers, and other malware and exploits are
selected based on the user's OS and browser.</p>

<p>Details on Mpack and its management console are reported at the
Websense and Symantec Web sites:<br>

</p>

<p>In the same timeframe, US Senator Mark Pryor (D-Arkansas) recently
introduced legislation making it a crime to install spyware on systems
without users' consent. Called The Counter Spy Act of 2007, it gives
enforcement power to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  Violators
could face both fines and prison.<br>

<h4>JavaOne: OpenJDK.org Formed for Future Java Implementations</h4>

<p>Fulfilling its promise to the world last year, Sun is releasing a
fully buildable implementation of the JDK to the new OpenJDK community.
In front of a cheering developer audience at May's JavaOne, Sun's CEO
Jonathon Schwartz announced the OpenJDK project, which will be tasked
with implementing future releases of Java.</p>

<p>The project was seeded with Sun's May 6th JDK source bundle, which
includes 25,169 source files. Almost all of the JDK - 6.5 million lines
of code - is now available under the GPL, making it one of the largest
contributions to the free software community in history. Of these, 4% or
894 cannot be shipped in source form: there are no rights for Sun to
release the files, currently. An additional 1,885 files (8%) are not
under GPLv2: These are mostly Apache-derived code, according to Sun.</p>

<p>Most of this exception code includes font and graphics rasterizers,
sound engine code, and some crypto algorithms. There is also a little
SNMP code, and some code for the Imaging APIs. (Richard Stallman of the
Free Software Foundation has subsequently written that FOSSw developers
should focus on this small subset of the JDK, and set Java completely
free.) The encumbered code for the current JDK resides in the
ALT_CLOSED_JDK, mostly in binaries. These are fully redistributable.</p>

<p>To help develop the community around OpenJDK, Sun launched a
developer Web site: <a
href="http://openjdk.java.net/">http://openjdk.java.net/</a></p>

<p>The site allows developers to download a full source-code bundle, or
use Subversion to check out the code from the repository. Developers can
contribute a patch to fix a bug, enhance an existing component, or
define a new feature. Beside on-going blogs, the site also has links to
live conversation via IRC on irc.oftc.net (#openjdk).</p>

<p>On the OpenJDK Web site, the founding engineers write: "With the
community's help, we hope that encumbered code can be re-implemented
over the next 6 to 12 months, balancing this critical engineering task
with other priorities, and depending on the level of community
participation in speeding this effort."</p>

<p>See FAQ at <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/java/faq.jsp">http://www.sun.com/software/opensource/java/faq.jsp</a>.</p>

<p>Also: Sun announced a one-year roadmap for the OpenJDK initiative,
including clearing the remaining encumbrances, open-sourcing an
implementation of Java SE 6 and associated deployment code,
implementation of the compatibility testing and branding program, and
establishment of the governance and contribution model for the
community. At JavaOne, Sun announced the formation of the OpenJDK
Interim Governance Board, with the charter to write and gain ratification
for a constitution for the OpenJDK Community, based on transparency and
an open, meritocratic process. Initially, this is viewed as separate
from the Java Community Process (JCP), where specifications are thrashed
out, mostly with vendor input.</p>

<p>As part of the NetBeans 6 preview release, Sun has created pre-built
Netbeans projects to make it easy and intuitive to dive into the OpenJDK
code base. </p>


<h4>MS rattles its patent sabers</h4>
<p>[with major contributions from LG copy editor Rick Moen]</p>

<p>Microsoft ignited a firestorm of controversy in the open source
community, when its lawyers used the medium of a <em>Fortune</em>
magazine article to specify an exact number of (alleged) MS patent
infringements in Linux and other FOSSw. The count was 235, including 42
violations for the kernel.</p>

<blockquote>"Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith and licensing chief
Horacio Gutierrez sat down with <em>Fortune</em> recently to map out
their strategy for getting FOSSw users to pay royalties."</blockquote>

<p>It may be that Microsoft is creating FUD to slow the increasing speed
of adoption of FOSSw at major corporations and many governments
worldwide -- all current and former MS clients. It may be that MS sees
the recent Supreme Court decision on software patents as weakening the
value of its own patent portfolio, and thus needs to act quickly to
maximize its advantage. Either way, the patent showdown will probably
get worse, over the next few months. Microsoft expects royalties or
cross-licensing deals, and maybe renewed customer loyalty.  That seems
to be the bottom line.</p>

<p>Microsoft has been asserting its patents recently, and has received
royalty payments from Novell and other companies like Samsung. To
prevent this trend, on March 28, the Free Software Foundation made
public a revised GPLv3 draft. That may have set the stage for a
confrontation with Microsoft, and perhaps between Microsoft and
companies championing open source, like IBM and Sun.</p>

<p>For an alternative take, several Groklaw commentators have pointed
out that:</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>Microsoft may have torpedoed their own case in advance by shipping
a vast number of the usual GPLed and other open source codebases as part
of Microsoft Services for Unix (nee Interix), creating a defence of
equitable estoppel.</p>

<li>
<p>They will also face the defence of "laches" (impermissible delay),
which becomes a bigger bar to litigation with each day that passes since
<em>both</em> the <em>Fortune</em> magazine piece and their shipment of
Interix.</p>

<li>
<p>If Microsoft ever sues anyone for patent infringement concerning a
GPLed codebase, then both Microsoft (i.e., Interix) and patent-licensee
Novell will immediately lose the right to distribute that codebase, per
GPLv2 clause 7.</p>

</ol>


<p>Complicating the already volatile situation, Dell became the
first major systems provider to join the business collaboration that was
formed by Microsoft and Novell for intellectual property (IP) assurance.
As part of the agreement, Dell will purchase SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server certificates from Microsoft, and establish a services and
marketing program to migrate existing Linux users who are not Dell Linux
customers to SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Under this extended
agreement, Dell will establish a customer marketing team for migrating
Linux users who are not Dell Linux customers to SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server.</p>

<p>"We're focused on delivering solutions that help simplify customers
IT operations," said Rick Becker, vice-president of solutions at Dell
Product Group. "Our customers have told us they want interoperability,
and expect technology vendors to work better together. Dell is the first
major systems provider to align with Microsoft and Novell in this
collaboration, and we intend to lead in this space. This move is a huge
success for the industry and, more specifically, for customers who
haven't purchased Linux through Dell and who want to migrate to SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server for the IP assurance and interoperability
benefits."</p>


<p>From our editor Rick Moen, commenting via the Linux Users of
Victoria mailing list:</p>

<p>"The <em>Fortune</em> piece that set off the patent debate contains
embarrassing factual gaffes such as this one:</p>

<blockquote>Lawyers for the Free Software Foundation have been able to
force developers who incorporated free software into proprietary
products to open up their source code, for instance."</blockquote>

<p>"This is a notorious bit of misinformation often promoted by various
opponents of copyleft licensing: In fact, copyright law provides no
mechanism whatsoever to compel such a disclosure, and no such event has
ever occurred (nor could it)."</p>

<p>Rick separately adds:</p>

<p>"You are advised to not hold your breath waiting for Microsoft
Corp. to state patent numbers and clarify what specific open source /
free-software codebases it believes are encumbered by its patents. For
one thing, that would -- as you suggest -- enable anyone and everyone to
assess those claims' merits.  Also, it would assist open-source coders
in, where necessary, rewriting their code with (probably) breathtaking
speed to use other, equivalent techniques. The Redmondians know -- from
watching the dismal fate of the few SCO infringement claims that SCO
bothered to detail usefully -- that they cannot compete in a fair match
of programming or analytical skill, so they instead make only vague
claims that their better-staffed and more-energetic competition cannot
address."</p>

<p>From Matt Asay, GM of Alfresco, who will be presenting at the
Open Source Business Conference in late May: "If we could have
referenced the MS 'patent threat' earlier [for our conference], it would
have doubled our attendance, I'm sure."</p>

<h4>OpenSUSE 10.3 Alpha four now out</h4>

<p>The openSUSE community announced the fourth public alpha release of
openSUSE 10.3. Highlights include the YaST meta packages handler;
InstLux allows users to start the Linux installation from Windows; TeX
Live replaces teTeX; first parts of KDE4svn entered Factory;
OpenOffice.org 2.2; GNOME 2.18.1; improvements to the init script
starter ('startpar') to reduce boot time; first changes to support Sony

and Zulu."</p>

<p>Quick link to the DVD torrent files:<br>
<a
href="http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/10.3-Alpha4/iso/torrent/openSUSE-10.3-Alpha4-DVD-i386.torrent">openSUSE-10.3-Alpha4-DVD-i386.iso</a> </p>


<h4>Kernel 2.6.22 release candidate 5 available</h4>

<p>Mid-June also saw the release of kernel 2.6.22-rc5. Said Linus: "On a
more serious note, I have to admit that I'm a bit unhappy with the pure
<em>volume</em> of changes this late in the game.  I was really wanting to stop
some of the merges, but, while not all of it really fixed regressions,
there really are a lot of bugfixes in there."</p> 


<h4>Fedora Core 7 is out</h4>

<p>Among the updates in Fedora 7 are user installation tools that allow
for several different "spins", which are variations of Fedora built from
a specific set of software packages. Each spin can be a combination of
software to meet requirements of specific end users. In addition to a
very small boot.iso image for network installation, users have the
following spin choices:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>GNOME and KDE desktop environment-based bootable Live images that
can be installed to a hard disk. These spins are meant for desktop users
who prefer a single disk installation, and for sharing Fedora with
friends, family, and event attendees.</p> 

<li>
<p>A regular image for desktops, workstations, and server users. This
spin provides a good upgrade path and similar environment for users of
previous releases of Fedora.</p>

<li>
<p>A set of DVD images that includes all software available in the Fedora 
repository.</p>

</ul>

<p>This release provides for enhanced wireless networking.  The
NetworkManager presents a graphical interface that allows user to
quickly switch between wireless and wired networks for increased
mobility. NetworkManager is installed by default in both GNOME and KDE
Live CDs.</p>

<p>Additionally, Fedora Core 7 uses Python 2.5, and all of the Python
software available in the repository uses it.<br>
<a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/whatsnew25.html">http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/whatsnew25.html</a>
</p>

<p>Fedora 7 includes Liberation fonts, which are metric equivalents for
several well-known proprietary fonts found throughout the Internet, and
give better results when viewing and printing shared documents.</p>


<h4>SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 SP1 now available</h4>

<p>SUSE 10 SP1 is out now, and provides enhancements in the areas from
the desktop to the data center, including:</p> 


<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhanced server virtualization and management enables unmodified Windows
and Linux guest operating systems to run with near native
performance.</p>

<li>
<p>Updated high availability storage infrastructure</p>

<li>
<p>Support for Open Enterprise Server 2 and paravirtualized NetWare.</p>

<li>
<p>Enhanced security features:</p>

   <ul>
   <li>
   <p>Novell AppArmor 2.0 security framework now includes support for
   Apache Tomcat.</p>
   </ul>

<li>
<p>Support for new processor technologies, including Quad-Core Intel Xeon
and AMD Opteron processors.</p>

</ul>

<p>On the desktop, SP1 delivers updates to the desktop effects engine, a
re-designed main menu, and the ability to play embedded video in
OpenOffice.org presentation files. It also provides improved integration
with enterprise technologies such as Microsoft Active Directory and
Microsoft Office, including the new OpenXML/ODF translator to convert
Microsoft Word 2007 documents to OpenOffice.org. (That Novell-Microsoft
patent deal, again!)</p>

<p><em>And</em>... SUSE Linux 9.3 is now officially discontinued, and out of
support.</p>

<h4>Skype for Linux 1.4 Beta</h4>

<p>Skype Version 1.4.0.74 for Linux was released June 14. "The big news
of this release is the support of glibc 2.3 systems. What this means is
that Skype 1.4 will now run on some older systems without upgrading the
base system."</p>

<p>Skype for Linux previously required glibc 2.3.3 or greater and Qt 3.2
or greater. If you do not have Qt 3.2 or greater, you are still able to
use Skype for Linux by downloading its static version that has Qt 3.2
compiled in.</p>

<p>Besides substantial bugfixes, this update 
includes Skype's own audio codec and an improved conference call 
mixer.<br> 
<a href="http://www.skype.com/download/skype/linux/">http://www.skype.com/download/skype/linux/</a></p>


<h4>Bugzilla 3.0</h4>

<p>As a present to its community, instead of releasing Bugzilla 2.24,
the Bugzilla Project has released Bugzilla 3.0. Earlier development
snapshots named 2.23.x have become the new Bugzilla 3.0. This is the
first major upgrade to the popular tool in almost a decade. Among the
Bugzilla changes are mod_perl support and a Web Services interface using
the XML-RPC protocol.

<h4>JavaOne and NASA's World Wind</h4>

<p>At the JavaOne conference in San Francisco, Robert Brewin, Sun's CTO
of software, and NASA's Patrick Hogan showed off a new open-source
geospatial browser plugin that implements Java GL and incorporates
NASA's visualization technology. The new software also allows developers
to create mashups and detailed geo-spatial simulations.</p>

<p>One demonstration was the DiSTI F-16 Flight Simulator, a Web plugin
based on Java GL Studio. It allowed a user to 'fly' an F-16 with
external and cockpit views, as it maneuvers over the Earth's terrain. A
collaboration between Sun Microsystems, NASA Ames, and DiSTI, the
simulator links Sun's Java Open GL platform, NASA's World Wind, which
provides actual satellite imagery and radar topography from Shuttle
missions, with GL Studio for Java - to enable Java developers to create
3D, real time visualizations of the Earth, using cost-effective, high
fidelity imagery. </p>

<p>DiSTI's GL Studio package lets an instructional designer integrate
photo-realistic objects into simulations that react just like the real
parts. Such parts affect the performance of the systems, and accurately
reproduce real behaviors (i.e., unscrew an important connector
from a simulated jet engine, and it will stop running.)</p>

<p>The NASA World Wind Java SDK is platform independent, and current
demos run under Fedora Core 6, Ubuntu, Microsoft Windows, and Mac OS
X.</p>

<p>There were some problems with the World Wind download from NASA, but
these seem to have been fixed by mid-May. Check out the FAQ on WorldWind
Central: <a href="http://www.worldwindcentral.com/wiki/WWJava_FAQ">http://www.worldwindcentral.com/wiki/WWJava_FAQ</a></p>

<h4>Red Hat Adds Business Solutions to Open Source RHX</h4>

<p>In May, at Red Hat Summit 2007 in SAN DIEGO, Red Hat announced the
availability of Red Hat Exchange (RHX). RHX extends Red Hat's Open
Source Architecture to include integrated business application solutions

<h4>Red Hat Virtual Appliance OS to Manage Intel vPro-based
Desktops</h4>

<p>At its Red Hat Summit, Red Hat announced a joint program with Intel
to bring hardware-assisted virtualization to desktop PCs with Intel vPro
technology. Using Intel vPro PCs, IT departments will be able to deploy
appliances in a virtual machine that bring enterprise-class management
and security to the PC.</p>

<p>"The legacy desktop falls short in its ability to provide a secure,
reliable and manageable environment," said Brian Stevens, CTO at Red
Hat. "Intel vPro technology combined with a Red Hat Virtual Appliance OS
will allow customers to create a rock-solid foundation that can then
provision, manage and secure the PC. This technology will reduce
operational costs and increase operational flexibility."</p>

<p>The Appliance OS from Red Hat will support pluggable Virtual
Appliances to deliver functions such as network security, provisioning,
monitoring and asset management, regardless of the state of the desktop
OS. In collaboration with Intel, Red Hat plans to develop, productize,
and support software components, including the hypervisor, the Service
OS, and the Software Development Kit (SDK).</p>

<p>Active development on the project is underway today, with beta
software expected later this year and general release planned for 2008.

<h3>Magical Realism</h3>


<h4>Lt. Cmdr. Data Added to CMU's Robot Hall of Fame</h4>

<p>Data, the inquisitive and evolving robot of Star Trek NG, was among
the four 2007 inductees announced for Carnegie Mellon University's Robot
Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>The four inductees - the one-legged Raibert Hopper, the NavLab 5
self-steering vehicle, the LEGO(R) Mindstorms kit, and Data - were
announced in May at the fourth annual RoboBusiness Conference in Boston.
Some robots from the first three induction classes include the Mars
Pathfinder Rover; Honda's ASIMO robot; the HAL 9000 computer from "2001:
A Space Odyssey"; the "Star Wars" duo of R2-D2 and C-3PO; and Gort, the
metallic giant from "The Day the Earth Stood Still." (Klaatu Barata
Nikto -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaatu_barada_nikto">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaatu_barada_nikto</a>)
</p>

<p>The one-legged Hopper was ideal for studying dynamic balance because
it could not stand still, but had to keep moving to stay upright. The
lessons learned with the Hopper proved central for biped, quadruped, and
even hexapod running. NavLab 5's crowning achievement was "No Hands
Across America," a 1995 cross-country tour on which it did 98 percent of
the driving.</p>

<p>CMU plans a formal induction ceremony for the four robots in the
fall. <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2007/May/may15_rhof.shtml">http://www.cmu.edu/news/archive/2007/May/may15_rhof.shtml</a></p>


<h4>Reinventing the Mag Stripe</h4>

<p>QSecure, Inc., a SV startup with multiple patents in credit card
authentication technology, has announced new technology that
significantly reduces fraud resulting from stolen card data. The
company's SmartStripe technology protects against counterfeit fraud
without requiring changes in retail systems or card holder behavior.</p>

<p>SmartStripe technology incorporates dynamic cryptography on the
card's magnetic stripe, augmenting the static data on the magnetic
stripe. Each time a consumer uses a SmartStripe card, a proprietary
magnetic media chip embedded in the magnetic stripe programs a unique
cryptographic number on the stripe that is valid for only one
transaction. If the payment card's data is compromised, and criminals
attempt to re-use the data from the stripe, card issuers will be able to
stop the transaction in real time.</p>

<p>Unlike other solutions which require changes to the existing credit
card infrastructure, QSecure's technology works seamlessly within the
existing retail system, requiring no modifications to merchants' card
readers. Further, its usage is transparent to the card holder, so no
changes to buying behavior are necessary. Future versions of QSecure
solutions will incorporate a small, flexible display to secure online
and other card-not-present transactions. The company is now working on
programs with major card issuers.</p>

<a name="1"></a>
<p> [1] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>: On account of
what I assume was a lapse in management concerning this program, an
oversight that has not yet been corrected, Red Hat, Inc. has regrettably
published false claims in press releases such as this one, and others on 
both <a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhx/">http://www.redhat.com/rhx/</a>
and on various subpages of <a
href="http://rhx.redhat.com/">http://rhx.redhat.com/</a> -- that Red Hat
Exchange's offerings are open source.</p>

<p>In fact, some are open source, some are under doubtful "badgeware"
MPL + restrictions licences whose sponsoring firms carefully avoid
submitting them to Open Source Initative for scrutiny lest they be
definitively rejected as open source, and some -- Centric CRM v. 4.1 
and Jive Software's OpenFire being obvious examples -- are very clearly, 
past any possibility of doubt, absolutely proprietary.  (Sixty seconds' 
checking should show readers that the Centric CRM's licence doesn't permit
redistribution, and, to quote 
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1384">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1384</a>,
"OpenFire has a time-based license that unlocks the Enterprise features
in the application. An e-mail is sent to purchasing customers with a
license file.")</p>

<p>I am among several people who have attempted to call Red Hat, Inc.'s
attention to these false and misleading statements (starting with a
private comment to the company's CTO immediately following the RHEL5 /
RHX product launch in San Francisco on March 14).  Their response thus
far has been very disappointing: my best guess is that we're hearing
only reactive and poorly-thought-out damage control from the very same
Marketing Department and Professional Services people who created this
program, i.e., that the issue has not yet reached upper management, but
rather remains bogged down among sponsoring middle managers motivated
only to sweep controversy under the rug.</p>  

<p>The latter group's spin control, in response to criticism, is in the
FAQ section of the "<a
href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285">More about
RHX</a>" page:</p>

<blockquote>
Q: Are you only accepting open source ISVs into RHX?<br>
A: The initial set of participating ISVs all have an open source focus. We
realize that there is debate about which companies are truly open
source. To make it transparent to users, RHX includes information about
each ISV's license approach. Longer term, we may introduce proprietary
applications that are friendly with open source applications.
</blockquote>

<p>This is confused, largely nonsensical, and unresponsive to the issue:
The notion of an "open source company" is undefined and (more to the
point) irrelevant to the issue at hand.  By contrast, open-source
<strong>codebases</strong> are abundantly well defined, by OSI's formal
and precise <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd">Open Source
Definition</a> that has always been the guiding criterion since OSI
invented the concept (and definition) in 1998.</p>

<p>I strongly hope that RH management takes this issue in hand soon and
corrects the many distortive claims of open source within RHX, that are
unsupported by the plain facts about many of the offerings.</p>

<p>(A separate page at the RHX site, <a
href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1310">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1310</a>,
makes absolutely all of the RHX offerings seem proprietary, even the
ones that are, in fact, true open source.  Fortunately, I guess, the
licence summary on that page is not very competently written, and is
substantively in error on most items listed.)</p>
