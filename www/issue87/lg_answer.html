<!-- begin hgreeting -->
<P> Greetings, everyone.  It's another day, another penguin over here at
The Answer Gang.   I'm sorry there are only three messages this time but
I think you'll find them juicy.

<P> Statistics - there were about 460 messages - and almost none of that was
spam thanks to Dan Wilder's hard work keeping the list on a leash.  I'd 
say the most common reason to not get an answer or merely get grumped at
instead of seeing a useful answer, would be to combine the twin errors
of using HTML based mail, and not telling us what few things you've
looked up first.  We can do much better at translating technese to
English than we can do at translating confused-fuzziness to a technical
question.

<P> You folks had a gazillion good tips out there and I'm digging myself out
from under them right now.  [Imagine:  a computer workroom filled with 
little grey envelopes filled with pennies all gabbing about little Linux
tidbits.  It's quite a chatterbox.]

<P> But that's hardly fair.  The real reason I'm running late and a few
pennies short is that I've been working really hard on the upcoming
LNX-BBC.  It's gonna be this year's membership card for the 
<A HREF="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</A>.  I mean, if you're
not a member then perhaps you should be anyway... but this is a definite plus.
It's still a toy for experts though.  More on cool toys for "the rest of us" in
upcoming months.  There are lots and lots of good projects out there.  

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[It wasn't all Heather's fault.  Our FTP server played a game of
"let's not but pretend we did", accepting Heather's Answer Gang upload but not
storing it.  Bad FTP daemon, bad!  It also has been dying the past few days,
which Dan has been combating via upgrades and logfile analysis.  At one point
logrotate was dying and taking the daemon down with it.  -Iron.]
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Have fun!
