Hello:
<P> 
	what kind of search engine are you using for the Linux 
Gazette www server?  Is this a linux-based engine?
<P> 
Thanks, <BR>

Subject: <B> Comments on Issue #11 </B> <BR> 
From: "R. Frank Louden" flouden@fairfield.home.sweet.net <BR> 
<P> 
I am always glad to see another issue of LG. Thank you for 
taking the time to compose it. One comment I'd like to make
is the most recent issue (#11) is difficult for me to read 
on the spiral binding background. For me, the text lies over
close enough to the left edge of the page, and it is almost
hidden in some parts of the page.
<P> 
I may be one of a dying breed but I choose to use Mosaic and
wish others would consider that MS and Netscape do NOT adhere
to the HTML specs and are fragmenting the standards. I note
that NCSA is working on a new version that will provide support
that is not currently found in the version I use. I am at this
moment using an unsupported version 2.7b5 (it's kinda buggy)
but when it works it allows me to see the background you have 
used.
<P> 
While whirly-gigs and gewgaws are nice, some of us are still
not able to upgrade hardware at the whim of the industry and 
need to have some consideration from those who sponsor WWW HTML
documents. I have accessed pages that are completely illegible
(with my old Mosaic) and others (with a more up-to-date browser)
that take prohibitively long times to download. There IS something
to be said for standards.
<P> 
Thanks again for the Gazette! It is great!!!
<blockquote> <I> 
(There may be more than one problem here. First off, if you are using a
mirror site, the problem is my fault. Somehow, when building the tar
file for the mirror sites, a gif that was integral to the notebook
motif -- it moved the print away from the spiral -- was left out. I am
in the process of notifying the mirror site where the missing file can
be downloaded.</I> 
<P> <I> 
The notebook spiral was put in using "tables" which is an HTML standard.
Here at SSC we too believe in following HTML standards. In fact the program
that we use to push things to the web checks that the HTML conforms. </I> 
<P> <I> 
I have worried that by adding more graphics we might be causing
problems with download times. However, we also would like to keep LG
looking good, so thought we'd add away and see what kind of comments we get.
So far it's tied. One who likes the spiral and yours against. BTW, if you
are accessing LG through a mirror site, try the main site and see if it
does better for you (http://www.ssc.com/lg).</I> 
<P> <I> 
Glad you like LG, I certainly have fun putting it together. --Editor)

Hello, this is Dennis from Greece.
<P> 
Well this time I managed to download the whole thing so now I have a 
full mirror. The only problem is that I didn't get (or I don't have) 
the searchbtn.gif and the htsearch.cgi that are used for the search 
engine.
<P> 
Did I make something wrong or should I have something I don't?
<P> 
Thank you in advance.<BR> 
Dennis
<blockquote> <I> 
(No, you did nothing wrong. I was so excited to have the search engine, I
forgot that the mirrors wouldn't have the proper data bases. Since these data
bases are very big and are for all of the SSC site, we have changed the
links for the data base so that it always refers back to the SSC site
rather than a relative address pointing to the mirror site. The updated
front page file is in the update tar file along with the missing files.
Let me know if it works for you. --Editor) </I> </blockquote>

<P> 
It's the first time I hear about Linux Gazette, I'd want to have all the
issues, but at the FTP addresses that appear on www.ssc.com have the horrible
message "Login Error".  What could I do?
<P> 
Thanks!

<blockquote> <I> 
(Not sure why you are having a problem. I can tell that others are able
to download from that address without problem. Are you using your
browser to point to that address or logging on with anonymous ftp?</I> 
<P> <I> 
I would suggest using a ftp mirror site that is closer to you.
Unfortunately, Linux Gazette does not have a mirror site in South
America at this time. There is one in Mexico which is somewhat closer
to you than Seattle.</I> 
<P> <I> 
At any rate if you go to the Mirror Site page
(http://linuxgazette.net/mirrors.html) in Linux Gazette, and use the
links there to go to one of the ftp sites (ours or one of the
mirrors), you shouldn't be asked for a login. (I never have been and
that's why I am a little confused by the message you are getting.)
Let me know if you continue to have problems, and thanks for writing.

Hello Jimmy!
<P> 
Thanks so much for taking the time to write!  I appreciate it.  I honestly
can't take the credit for this -- the kind folks at SSC (and the Linux
Journal) offered to take over the management of the LG when its
administrative upkeep just got to be too much.  Marjorie Richardson is its
capable new Editor.
<P> 
I've taken the liberty of cc'ing a copy of this to her -- definitely
deserves a pat on the back.
<P> 
Thanks again and Best Wishes,
<P> 
John

Greetings....
<P> 
I've gone through your title page for the Linux Gazette, and could not
find a link to other Linux pages.  Please put a link to page with links
to other, commonly used Linux pages just below the Mirror sites link,
and
ask those that you give links for to provide links to you.  This will
make finding information much easier.  Thank you for your time.
<P> 
<blockquote> <I> 
(I'm not sure which are the commonly used Linux pages you'd like to have a
link for on the LG front page. I have added a link to SSC's Linux Resources
page at http://www.ssc.com/linux/. Why don't you look at that page and
see if it has the links you are wanting. Let me know what you think. 
Thanks for writing. --Editor)

Hi there. Just a suggestion about the page (which looks ... wow ...
compared to before). If you could, however, try to keep it inside of one
page wide, it would be wonderful. I find myself having to use the arrows
to see what's on the end of lines on the right hand side of the page..

look into it.  --Editor)
