<p>When you boot Linux, do you get a "login:" prompt on a bunch of
virtual consoles and have to type in your username and password on
each of them?  Even though you're the only one who uses the system?
Well, stop it.  You can make these consoles come up all logged on and
at a command prompt at every boot.

<p>In case you're thinking that password prompt is necessary for
security, think again.  Chances are that if someone has access to your
console keyboard, he also has access to your floppy disk drive and
could easily insert his own system disk in there and be logged in as
you in three minutes anyway.  That password prompt is about as useful
as an umbrella for fish.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The method I'm going to describe for getting your virtual consoles
logged in automatically consists of installing some software and
changing a few lines in <strong>/etc/inittab</strong>.  Before I do
that, I'll take you on a mind-expanding journey through the land of
getties and logins to see just how a Unix user gets logged in.

<p>First, I must clarify that I'm talking about virtual consoles --
those are text consoles that you ordinarily switch between by pressing
ALT-F2 or CTL-ALT-F2 and such.  Shells that you see in windows on a
graphical desktop are something else entirely.  You can make those
windows come up automatically at boot time too, but the process is
quite a bit different and not covered by this article.

<p>Also, consider serial terminals:  The same technique discussed in
this article for virtual consoles works for serial terminals, but may
need some tweaking because the terminal may need some things such as
baud rate and parity set.

<h2>How Logging In Works</h2>

<h3>Historical Background</h3>

<p>In the traditional Unix system of old, the computer was in a
locked room and users accessed the system via terminals in another
room.  The terminals were connected to serial ports.  When the system
first came up, it printed (we're back before CRT terminals -- they
really did print) some identification information and then a "login:"
prompt.  Whoever wanted to use the computer would walk up to one of
these terminals and type in his username, then his password, and then
he would get a shell prompt and be "logged in."

<p>Today, you see the same thing on Linux virtual consoles, though it
doesn't make as much sense if you don't think about the history.

<h3>Getty</h3>

<p>Let's go through the Linux boot process now and see how that login
prompt gets up there.

<p>When you first boot Linux, the kernel creates the
<strong>init</strong> process.  It is the first and last process to
exist in any Linux system.  All other processes in a Linux system are
created either by <strong>init</strong> or by a descendant of
<strong>init</strong>.

<p>The <strong>init</strong> process normally runs a program called
Sysvinit or something like it.  It's worth pointing out that you can
really run any program you like as <strong>init</strong>, naming the
executable in Linux boot parameters.  But the default is the
executable <strong>/sbin/init</strong>, which is usually Sysvinit.
Sysvinit takes its instructions from the file
</strong>/etc/inittab</strong>.

<p> To see how <strong>init</strong> works, do a <kbd>man init</kbd> and
<kbd>man inittab</kbd>.

<p>If you look in <strong>/etc/inittab</strong>, you will see the
instructions that tell it to start a bunch of processes running a
getty program, one process for each virtual console.  Here is an
example of a line from <strong>/etc/inittab</strong> that tells
<strong>init</strong> to start a process running a getty on the
virtual console <strong>/dev/tty5</strong>:

<xmp>
   c5:235:respawn:/sbin/agetty 38400 tty5 
</xmp>

<p> In this case, the particular getty program is
<strong>/sbin/agetty</strong>.  On your system, you may be using
<strong>/sbin/mingetty</strong> or any of a bunch of other programs.
(Whatever the program, it's a good bet it has "getty" in its name.  We
call these getties because the very first one was simply called
"getty," derived from "get teletype".)

<p>Getty opens the specified terminal as the standard input, standard
output, and standard error files for its process.  It also assigns
that terminal as the process' "controlling terminal" and sets the
ownership and permissions on the terminal device to something safe
(resetting whatever may have been set by the user of a previous login
session).

<p>So now you can see how the login prompt gets up on virtual console
<strong>/dev/tty5</strong>.  The kernel creates the
<strong>init</strong> process, running Sysvinit.  Sysvinit, as
instructed by its <strong>/etc/inittab</strong> file, starts another
process running a getty program, with parameters identifying
<strong>/dev/tty5</strong>.  The getty program prints "login:" on
<strong>/dev/tty5</strong> and waits for someone to type something.

<h3>Login</h3>

<p> After you respond to getty's login prompt, getty execs the program
<strong>login</strong>.  (Actually, you can usually tell getty to execute
any program of your choice, but <strong>/bin/login</strong> is normal);
i.e. <strong>getty</strong> replaces itself with <strong>login</strong>.  It's
still the same process, though.

<p> Bear in mind that this process was created by <strong>init</strong>,
which is owned by the superuser.  So this process, which is now
running login, is also owned by the superuser.

<p> The first thing <strong>login</strong> does is ask for your password.
When you type it in, <strong>login</strong> determines if it's right or
not.  Assuming it is, login then proceeds to do the following things:

<ul>
<li>
Set the owning user id of the process to you.
<li>
Set the owning group id of the process to your group.
<li>
Put a record in the user accounting database (the "utmp" file)
showing that you are logged in.  This database is technically
unnecessary today, but it is still used by old programs such as
<strong>who</strong> to tell who is logged on and at what terminal.
<li>
Set the process' supplemental groups to all the groups to which
you belong.
<li>
Set the process' current working directory to your home directory.
<li>
Make you the owner of the terminal device and set its permissions
appropriately.
</ul>

<p> The next thing <strong>login</strong> does is exec your shell program
(which can really be any program, but is normally a command shell,
e.g. <strong>/bin/bash</strong>).  I.e.  it replaces itself with the shell
program.

<p> Login looks up your username in the file <strong>/etc/passwd</strong>
to find all the information it needs, such as your password, uid, and
shell program.

<h3>The Shell</h3>

<p> The shell proceeds to run the system shell profile
(<strong>/etc/profile</strong>) and your personal profile (typically the
file <strong>.profile</strong> in your home directory), and ultimately
display a command prompt (<code>$</code> or <code>%</code>) on the terminal.  
This is the point at which
you consider yourself logged in, and our journey is complete.

<h2>Automating Login</h2>

<p>Ok, that was fun, but our purpose in this article is to explore a
new kind of login -- an automated one.

<p>Our goal is to do all those things that <strong>init</strong>,
<strong>getty</strong>, <strong>login</strong>, and the shell do except
<em>without the username and password prompt</em>.

<p> There are a bunch of ways to do that, but I wrote the program
<strong>qlogin</strong> to do it all very simply.
<strong>qlogin</strong> performs the functions of
<strong>getty</strong> and <strong>login</strong>.  It gets called by
<strong>init</strong>, like getty, and its last act is to call the
shell program, like <strong>login</strong>.

<p> So to set this up, all you have to do is replace the
<strong>/etc/inittab</strong> line shown above with one something like
this:

<xmp>
   c4:235:respawn:/sbin/qlogin /dev/tty5 bryanh 
</xmp>

This logs in username <strong>bryanh</strong> to virtual console
<strong>/dev/tty5</strong> at boot time instead of going through the
username and password prompt business.

<p>Note that the "respawn" in the line above means that when the
process ends, <strong>init</strong> will create a new one to take its
place.  In the traditional Unix system, that means when you log out of
your shell, which causes the process to end, a new getty runs and the
terminal gets a login prompt for the next user.  In the
<strong>qlogin</strong> case, it means when you log out of your shell,
a new one comes up immediately to take its place.  So if you want to
reset a bunch of stuff in your login session, typing <kbd>logout</kbd>
is a good way to do it.

<h2>Starting Slowly</h2>

<p>You probably shouldn't install <strong>qlogin</strong> and then
just dive right into changing all your getty's to qlogin's in
<strong>/etc/inittab</strong> and reboot and see if it works.  That
would be pretty optimistic.

<h3>Diversity Is Good</h3>

<p>First of all, I recommend that you not convert <em>all</em> your
virtual consoles to <strong>qlogin</strong> ever.  Use the tried and
true getty/login system on at least one virtual console so that if you
mess up something with <strong>qlogin</strong>, you can get into
another virtual console and fix it.  And if you mess up something with
<strong>getty</strong> or <strong>login</strong>, you can get into
another virtual console via <strong>qlogin</strong> and fix that!

<h3>Run It From A Shell</h3>

<p>Before you go editing <strong>/etc/inittab</strong> and messing
around with the <strong>init</strong> task, you should convince
yourself you know what you're doing by running <strong>qlogin</strong>
from a shell.  Watch <strong>qlogin</strong> work with your own eyes.
The problem with <strong>init</strong>, besides the fact that it's a
very important process you don't want to break, is that it doesn't
have a standard error file -- no way to give you error messages to
tell you why it can't do what you thought you told it to do.

<p>Usually, the indication from <strong>init</strong> that something is
wrong is "id X spawning too fast.  Disabled for 5 minutes."  What that
means is that the program (e.g. <strong>qlogin</strong>) that you told
<strong>init</strong> to run runs into trouble and terminates immediately.
Because it's a "respawn" entry, <strong>init</strong> simply generates a
new process running the same program.  And these processes start and
crash repeatedly.  <strong>init</strong> notices this and suspends the
"respawn" procedure for 5 minutes in hopes that someone fixes the
problem.  But why is the program immediately crashing?  Nobody knows
except that program, and it's not telling.

<p>So just invoke <strong>qlogin</strong> from a shell prompt, with
the same arguments with which you would have <strong>init</strong>
invoke it.  Now <strong>qlogin</strong> will issue error messages if
it crashes.

<p>Of course, the shell from which you invoke <strong>qlogin</strong>
had better be a superuser shell.  Otherwise, I can tell you right now
what your error message will be.

<h4>One Difference - Controlling Terminal</h4>

<p>One tricky aspect of running <strong>qlogin</strong> from a shell is
the matter of the controlling terminal.  The login process you
generate with <strong>qlogin</strong> will use the terminal you specify as
its input and output terminal, but its controlling terminal will be
the terminal where you typed "<strong>qlogin</strong>."

<p>The reason for the difference is this: If you're a Linux process,
when you open a terminal for input and you don't already have a
controlling terminal, that terminal becomes your controlling terminal.
But if you already have a controlling terminal, you just keep it.
<strong>init</strong> does not have a controlling terminal, so neither
does the <strong>qlogin</strong> child process it creates.  But login
shells have controlling terminals, and therefore the child processes
you create by typing commands (such as <strong>qlogin</strong>) at
shell prompts do too.

<p>Where you will see the difference is when you type Control-C:  It
won't do anything.  Control-C typed on a standard input device has no
effect other than to include a Control-C character in the input
stream.  But Control-C on a controlling terminal causes the foreground
processes associated with that terminal to get a SIGINT signal, which
has the familiar effect of terminating the program.

<p>All I'm saying is that if you log yourself on to
<strong>/dev/tty5</strong> by typing <kbd>qlogin /dev/tty5 ...</kbd> on
<strong>/dev/tty1</strong>, then Control-C on <strong>/dev/tty5</strong> will
have no effect.  Put the same <kbd>qlogin /dev/tty5 ... </kbd> command
in <strong>/etc/inittab</strong>, and Control-C on <strong>/dev/tty5</strong>
will work fine.

<p> Note: to be pedantic, I must admit that in saying Control-C, I am
assuming that the terminal's TTY properties are set such that
Control-C is the "interrupt character."  You could use
<strong>stty</strong> to make the interrupt character something else or
not have one at all.

<h2>About Qlogin</h2>

<p> <Strong>qlogin</Strong> isn't on your system, so you'll have to
install it.  Get it from <a
href=ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/misc>ibiblio.org</a> and
follow the simple installation instructions.  As you will find, a
prerequisite is the Perl extension called <strong>User::Utmp</strong>,
which probably also is not on your system, so you'll have to follow
the instructions to get and install that too.

<p><Strong>qlogin</Strong> is written in Perl and is quite simple.  So
you can see for yourself the steps involved in logging in a user.  And
you can modify it to suit your particular needs.

<p>One of the nice things about <Strong>qlogin</Strong> is that it's so
basic that it doesn't even rely on configuration files.  You can tell
it everything it needs to know to log you in just with command line
parameters.  You can override your <strong>/etc/passwd</strong> file or
log in a user that isn't even in <strong>/etc/passwd</strong>.  You're in
control.

<p>
Let's look at <strong>qlogin</strong>'s options:
<dl>
<dt>--command
<dd>the "command" (a kind of sloppy way to say a program plus
its arguments) to run after <strong>qlogin</strong> exits.  <strong>/bin/bash</strong>
is typical.
<dt>--arg0
<dd>the Argument Zero value for the program that runs after
<strong>qlogin</strong> exits, which is what shows up in a <strong>ps</strong> display.
<dt>--uid
<dd>the numeric user id for the process.
<dt>--gid
<dd>the numeric group id for the process.
<dt>--homedir
<dd>the home directory and initial current working directory
for the process.
<dt>--utmp/--noutmp
<dd>determines whether <strong>qlogin</strong> logs the session in the user
accounting database (utmp file).
</dl>

<p> And <strong>qlogin</strong> arguments specify the terminal device to
use for the process.

<p> All the details of using <strong>qlogin</strong> are in the
documentation that comes with it.

<h2>Other Things You Can Do With Qlogin</h2>

<p> So now you know how to make logged in shells come up automatically
on the various virtual consoles.  But with a simple change to the
procedure, you can make other programs run automatically on certain
virtual consoles or on serial terminals.  Imagine a virtual console
that runs the <strong>top</strong> system monitor program all the time.
Just say

<xmp>
  qlogin /dev/tty5 root --command=/bin/top --noutmp
</xmp>

<p> Maybe your system is a point of sale system for a store.  The
terminals are serial terminals at the cashier stations.  Cashiers
don't want to log in to Linux and don't want to see a shell.  If the
POS program is <strong>/usr/local/bin/pos</strong>, you could do this:

<xmp>
  qlogin /dev/ttyS1 cashier --uid=500 --gid=500 --command=/usr/local/bin/pos
      --arg0=POS --homedir=/
</xmp>

In this case, the <strong>pos</strong> program probably needs to do some
initialization of the serial port, such as setting its baud rate.  In
the traditional Unix login model, <strong>getty</strong> does that before
it puts up the login prompt.

<h1>Foreground Processes</H1>

<blockquote><em>[Your Editor asked Bryan, "I thought the system didn't have a
concept of a foreground process; that's a fiction of the shell."  Here's his
response.  --Iron]</em></blockquote>

<P>  I used to think that too; probably because of something I read in Bash
documentation.  However, the Linux kernel defines a "foreground
process group."  Every controlling terminal has a foreground process
group.  By default, it is the process group of the process that
originally opened the terminal.  But a process can set the foreground
process group to any process group in its session with an ioctl.

<P> I took a slight liberty in the article in referring to "foreground
processes," which I think can easily be interpreted as "processes in
the foreground process group."

<P> I believe the only significance of the foreground process group (the
kernel entity) is that the processes in that process group get the
control-C and hangup signals.

<P> Bash's job control uses that ioctl to make whatever your "foreground
job" is the foreground process group for your terminal.  That's why
when you put something in the background, like "grep abc * &",
control-C does not kill it.  If you want to kill it, you have to "fg",
causing Bash to ioctl it to the foreground, then Control-C.

<P> Many years ago, before the Web when terminals mattered a lot more, I
spent many hours combing through kernel code and experimenting to
figure out process groups, sessions, controlling terminals, job
control, SIGINT, SIGHUP, and the like.  I could write a long article
on it, but I think it's really arcane information.

<blockquote><em>[Readers: if you want to take him up on his offer for
such "arcane information", ask in the Mailbag.  Also remember that the
Mailbag is where you can ask for articles on any other topic. --Iron]
</em></blockquote>
