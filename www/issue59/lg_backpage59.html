<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Matthias Arndt</H4>
I'm a Linux enthusiast, 20 years old and from Germany.  I
will start studying computer sciences in conjuction with economics in October.
I like good old rock'n'roll and of course Linux. I love writing stories and
I have always wanted to write for a computer magazine.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Bill Bennet</H4>

<P> Bill, the ComputerHelperGuy, lives in Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada; the
"Catfish Capitol of North America" if not the world. He is on the Internet at
<A HREF=http://www.chguy.net>www.chguy.net</A>. He tells us "I have been a PC
user since 1983 when I got my start as a Radio Shack manager. After five years
in the trenches, I went into business for myself. Now happily divorced from
reality, I live next to my Linux box and sell and support GPL distributions of
all major Linux flavours. I was a beta tester for the PC version of Playmaker
Football and I play `pentium-required' games on the i486. I want to help Linux
become a great success in the gaming world, since that will be how Linux will
take over the desktop from DOS." It is hard to believe that his five years of
university was only good for fostering creative writing skills.

Part computer programmer, part cartoonist, part Mars Bar. At night, he runs
around in a pair of colorful tights fighting criminals. During the day... well,
he just runs around.  He eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's sleepy.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Chris Jones</H4>
Chris  is an Australian poet and writer currently working on a
series of novels with the working title of Swindle. He switched to
Linux 14 months ago finding it the best operating system for writers he
has ever worked on. He first installed Linux on his ancient Toshiba
3400 notebook, before buying a new desktop computer piece by piece.  Once
he got it assembled, he installed Linux as his only operating system. 

<P>

I'm a software developer by day and an artist, web developer,
big dog, gardener and wine maker by night.  This all leaves very little
time for sleep, but always enough time for a nice glass of Michigan
Pinot Gris.  I have a BS double major in Computer Science and
Mathematics and an MS in Computer Science.  I've been using and
modifying Linux since the 0.9x days.  I can be reached via email at
<A HREF="mailto:kasten@sunpuppy.com">kasten@sunpuppy.com</A> or through
