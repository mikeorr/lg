<h1>Poor Man's Laptop</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/renker.html">Gerrit Renker</A></b></p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<pre>
But you know nowadays
It's the old man
He's got all the money
And a young man ain't got nothin' in the world these days

- The Who `Young Man Blues'
</pre>

<p>Laptops are fine, if you can afford them. Even if you cannot afford
one, often enough the situation arises that computer work has to be
done at home - whether you are studying, doing business charts,
programming, Web designing....</p>

<p>This article presents a reliable and truly cheap alternative to
buying a laptop for keeping up with work/study demands.</p>


<h3>Scripting, not purchasing</h3>

     alt="USB stick image" align="right">

<p>My situation forced me to prepare work at home, but a laptop was far
too expensive. Perhaps due to the popularity of laptops, it is actually
<em>much</em> cheaper to buy a second-hand PC. A portable hard drive would
have been a nice thing, but requires synchronising directory content
between three locations - the portable drive, the computers at home, and
those at work.</p>

<p>The solution presented here is possibly the cheapest possible and
based on an inexpensive USB stick; the required `intelligence' to
reliably synchronise directories is provided by a set of scripts. Unlike
hardware-based solutions, this works across different distributions and
even operating systems.  The principle is simple, but there are a number
of subtle problems that have been ironed out during three years of use
(with my second-hand PC) on a daily basis.</p>


<h3>Overview</h3>


<p>The USB directory synchroniser consists of the following:</p>
<ol>
   <li>A <em>central Perl script</em> to track file modification times.</li>
   <li>A mode of <em>mounting</em> the stick which ensures file integrity.</li>
   <li><em>Add-ons</em> to the script, such as timestamping, additional archives, and command execution.</li>
   <li><em>Subsidiary scripts</em> for adding/reading important notes and remote command execution.</li>
</ol>

<p>This all is too much for one article; hence, the basic functionality
(first two items) is covered by this article, the remaining items
follow in a subsequent part.</p>

<p>This part starts with a reduced, but fully functional <a
href="misc/renker/pack_bare_bones.pl.txt">`bare-bones' script</a>, to
explain core functionality, how to set up, and how to hack it. When the
<a href="misc/renker/pack.pl.txt">full script</a> follows in part II,
its functionality will then be obvious - it is not more complex, but
just has more bells and whistles.</p>

<p>If you are a Perl hacker, you should feel at liberty to skim through the
following sections and move on to the more complex version.</p>



<h2>Reliable archives versus removable media</h2>

<p>The daily archive has a fixed name; mine is called
`<em>actual.2</em>' and is located in <tt>$flashdir</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
$flashdir =  ${ENV}{'VOL'} || "/vol/flash";
$tarfile  = "$flashdir/actual.2";
</pre>

<p>The first line sets the mount point, which can be overridden using
the <tt>VOL</tt> environment variable. (For example, you could say
<tt>export VOL=/vol/floppy</tt> and store the archive on a floppy
disk.)</p>

<p>Mounting happens as with any other filesystem (e.g., hard drive
partitions), but with one important difference: the system may be able
to tell when a USB stick is inserted, but it can <em>not</em> reliably
tell or sync any unflushed file system buffers when the stick is pulled
out. As convenient as the `storage media' icons are on Gnome/KDE
desktops, I have found them unsatisfactory for the purpose of archiving:
more than once I have ended up with corrupt, half-full archives, this
way.  Therefore, a different alternative is presented here; and there is
additional provision to make sure that the archive does indeed end up on
the USB stick.</p>


<h3>Mounting the USB stick</h3>

<p>The safest bet, but tedious, is to always <tt>mount(8)</tt> /
<tt>umount(8)</tt> the stick:</p>

<pre class="code">
mount -t vfat  /dev/sda1 /vol/flash
</pre>

<p>USB uses the SCSI subsystem; therefore, in most cases the first USB
stick stuck into your  computer will appear as <tt>/dev/sda1</tt>; check
this via <tt>dmesg</tt> and/or in <tt>/var/log/messages</tt>.</p>

<p>A better alternative to manual mounting is the automounter, which
auto-mounts a directory the first time one tries to access (read) it;
and umounts automatically after a fixed timeout.</p>


<h3>Automatic mounting</h3>

<p>Most, if not all, systems come with the automounter per default
(<tt>man autofs(8)</tt>); it is started at boot-time via
<tt>/etc/init.d/autofs</tt>. The automounter is configured via so-called
`map' files, which designate the mapping from hardware devices (such as
<tt>/dev/sda1</tt>) to mountpoints.</p> The first file to consider is <a
href="misc/renker/auto.master.txt">/etc/auto.master</a> which contains
but one line:</p>

<tt>/vol  /etc/auto.vol      --timeout=20</tt>

<p>This instructs autofs to consult the file <tt>auto.vol</tt> in all
matters of volatile media. The file <a
href="misc/renker/auto.vol.txt">/etc/auto.vol</a> then contains the
actual map; the relevant entry is the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
flash  -fstype=auto,dirsync,user,umask=000,exec,noatime,shortname=winnt :/dev/sda1
</pre>

<p>
The above line can be parsed into three distinct sections: mountpoint under
<tt>/vol</tt>, mount options, and the device to be mounted. (To create the
all mountpoints, use <tt>mkdir -vp /vol/{flash,floppy,cdrom}</tt> under
<tt>bash</tt>; see <a href="misc/renker/auto.vol.txt">the file</a> for the
configuration of floppy/cdrom).  The fstype is <em>auto</em>matically
detected; but I can only recommend to stick with vfat: using ext2/3 will
trigger unpleasant <tt>fsck</tt>-ing at boot time. Important for electronic
filesystems such as USB sticks are <em>dirsync</em> and <em>noatime</em>, as these
reduce the number of device accesses (limited by component lifetime). For
the remaining options, see <tt>mount(8)</tt>.  </p>

<p>After creating and editing these two files (with the correct settings
for your stick), you should be able to do a `<tt>/etc/init.d/autofs
restart</tt>' and see contents of your flash directory via `<tt>ls -l
/vol/flash'</tt>.  If so, you are ready to experiment with <a
href="misc/renker/pack_bare_bones.pl.txt">the script</a> and its <a
href="misc/renker/pack.list-example.txt">configuration file</a> (if it
is copied into <tt>/etc/pack.list</tt>, make sure that you have write
access). The automounter should best be enabled at boot time (Fedora/RH:
<tt>chkconfig --list autofs</tt>, Debian: <tt>update-rc.d -n autofs
defaults</tt>).</p> <p>The script works very well with automounting:
before doing anything, it will first try to access the
<tt>$flashdir</tt>.  If it cannot access, after several repeated
attempts it will give up with a warning message.</p>

<p>The remainder of the article now describes how the script works. (You
can also see debug output by setting the shell variable <tt>debug</tt>
to &gt; 4.)  </p>



<h2>Functioning of the core script</h2>

<p>The <a href="misc/renker/pack_bare_bones.pl.txt">main, bare-bones
script</a>, which we will now take apart, uses <em>Perl built-ins</em> for
things that have to run fast (such as traversing directories and
creating lists), and <em>calls other programs</em> (such as <tt>tar</tt>)
for everything else.</p>

<p>The following requirements made a script inevitable:</p>
<ul>

  <li> <em>directories</em>: tar  will happily add <em>all and any
subdirectories</em>, if one is not very careful. For example, if you
modified <tt>/usr/src/linux/.config</tt> and use `<tt>find
/usr/src/linux/ -mtime -1'</tt> to track your latest files,
<tt>find</tt> will include the directory <tt>/usr/src/linux/</tt> as
well.  Now, instead of a 10KB tar file, you would end up with 40..100MB
(which will take painfully long, especially if the PC has USB 1.1).</li>


  <li> <em>symlinks</em> are a real pain: you can either choose between
dereferencing (-h) or without, but both is not possible.</li>

  <li><em>maintainability</em>: it is all well to do `<tt>tar -zcvf
archive.tgz  someDir</tt>', but gets soon out of hand once a mixture of
files in different locations is involved</li>

  <li> <em>configurability</em>: re-programming scripts every day is
tedious, one <em>configuration file</em> is used instead to list all
relevant files and directories</li>

</ul>

<dl>
<dt><em><strong>Functional Principle:</strong></em></dt>
<dd>A configuration file is used to keep track of the important files and directories.</dd> 
<dd>To take home (on the USB stick) all tracked files home that changed during the last <tt>x</tt> days, 
    the script is called with the <tt>--days x option</tt>.</dd>
<dd>At home, the archive is unpacked using the <tt>--unpack</tt> option. 
    This works in both directions (from home to work, and from work to home).</dd>
</dl>

<h3>User interaction</h3>

<p>An important program called by this script is <strong>(g)dialog</strong>,
which provides GUI dialogs (example error box in <a
href="misc/renker/error-dialog.png">dialog</a> and in <a
href="misc/renker/error-gdialog.png">gdialog</a>):</p>

<pre class="code">
$dialog = ($ENV{'DISPLAY'} &amp;&amp; (qx#which gdialog 2&gt;/dev/null#))? "gdialog" : "dialog";
</pre>


<p>On the console, <tt>dialog</tt> is called; under X,  <tt>gdialog</tt>
is used for the same purposes. The <tt>qx/.../</tt> statement chooses
dialog in both cases if gdialog is not available. On a Debian system,
you can install both via <tt>apt-get install dialog zenity</tt> (gdialog
is in the zenity package); similar for other distros.</p>

<p>For the rest of the <em>user interaction</em>, the pager
<tt>$less</tt> is used, and we have the logging function:</p>

<pre class="code">
sub log {
   printf STDERR "\033[1;34;7m@_\033[m\n";
}
</pre>

<p>The funny digits are <em>ANSI escape sequences</em> to colour the
output (a screenshot is <a
href="misc/renker/console_listing.png">here</a>); good examples of using
these can be found elsewhere in LG.  Since Perl already has a
<tt>log</tt>(-arithm) function, we need to make clear which log we want;
hence above function will be invoked as <tt>::log()</tt> (which is an
abbreviation for <tt>main::log()</tt>).</p>


<h3>Core blocks of the script</h3>

<p>The bare-bones script can already do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>unpack</strong> the archive from USB stick  (<tt>--unpack</tt> option)</li>
  <li> <strong>create</strong> a new archive   (default when no option is given, <tt>--yes</tt> overwrites)</li>
  <li> restrict the <b>age</b> of tracked files to <tt>n</tt> days     (<tt>--days n</tt> option)</li>
  <li> <strong>list</strong> those files in tracked directories that have changed during   the last <tt>n</tt> days
           (<tt>--list</tt> option)</li>
</ul>

<p>In increasing order of complexity, we will consider (1) listing, (2)
un-packing, (3) packing, and (4) building the file list.</p>



<h3>1) Listing files that have changed</h3>

<p>This is easy, <tt>$see</tt> is true when the <tt>--list</tt> option
is set:</p>

<pre class="code">
if ( $see ) {
   build_list();
   system "$less $list";
}
</pre>

The <tt>build_list()</tt> function hides all the complexity of parsing,
collating, and checking; it is discussed later. The third line calls our
pager `<tt>$less</tt>' (<tt>PAGER</tt> environment variable) on the
newly created <tt>$list</tt>.

<h3>2) Un-packing an archive</h3>

<p>Un-packing is done by invoking the script with the <tt>--unpack</tt>
option.  On my system, I have found it useful to use the following
<em>alias</em> (the <tt>pack</tt> script is in <tt>~/bin</tt> and
<tt>~/.bashrc</tt> contains: <tt>export PATH=~/bin:$PATH</tt>):</p>

<pre class="code">
alias unpack="pack --unpack"
</pre>


Un-packing is described by the following <em>pseudo-code</em>:
<ol>
  <li> check if archive was created on this host  </li>
  <li> call <tt>unpack()</tt>, a wrapper around `<tt>tar -jxpPvf $tarfile</tt>' </li>
  <li> display errors encountered in (2), if any </li>
</ol>

<p>Step (1) is important: if you accidentally left an archive on the
stick and then, not knowingly, unpack it some days later, it will
silently overwrite your files with the older files stored in the
archive. This has happened to me several times, but the remedy is both
simple and very efficient.</p>

<p>Tar has a rich set of features, stemming from the old days when it
was used as Tape ARchiver. That is, it supports storing archives on
several different (tape) volumes and with the <tt>--label=myLabel</tt>
option, these volume archives can be given individual names. You can
view the volume name of an archive by using <tt>-t</tt> to list an
archive, the volume label appears in the first line.  So, in the present
case, the volume names are simply set to the fully-qualified
<tt>hostname(1)</tt> of the system. (This assumes that different PCs have
different <tt>hostname</tt>.)</p>




<h3>3) Archiving what has changed in the past days</h3>

<p>The inverse operation to unpacking is simple, all the complexity is
in <tt>build_list()</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
  ::log "Creating backup archive file ...";
  system "tar -jcpPvf $tarfile --label $hostname --files-from=$list 2>$log";
  if ($? != 0) {
       unlink $tarfile;
       error "Tar Problem!\nDeleting archive $tarfile";
  }
  ::log "Syncing ...";
  system "sync; sync;";

  ::log "Testing file integrity:";
  system "bzip2 -tvv $tarfile";
</pre>

<p>The <tt>$tarfile</tt> is created with the files from <tt>$list</tt>,
the volume label is set to the <tt>$hostname</tt>. In case of error, the
archive is deleted (<tt>unlink</tt>-ed) and an error window will pop up.
Otherwise, <tt>sync(1)</tt> is called twice to flush filesystem buffers.
The subsequent file integrity test provides additional protection
against removing the USB stick before all of the data has been safely
transferred. (This is a common problem with removable media, and it is
good to be cautious, here.)</p>

<h3>4a) Building the file list: <em>parsing configuration file</em></h3>

<p>The <tt>build_list()</tt> routine adds intelligent functionality
around the tar program: it processes the contents of a configuration
file in such a manner that only files changed in the last few days are
passed on to tar, without adding unwanted subdirectories, but with full
expansion of symlinks.</p>

<p>The complexity that this requires is hidden behind recursion (a
function calling itself again), which is a good working principle, since
directories are themselves recursive: a sub-sub-directory is a directory
in a directory is a directory in a directory ... :-)</p>

<p>Let's look at the main loop, which parses the file <tt>$config</tt>.</p>

<pre class="code">
while(&lt;&gt;) {
    strip_comments_and_leading_whitespace();
    next if $line_is_empty;

    my @arr = split;                  # put all single words into @arr

    if ($arr[0] = m/&lt;\s*rec\s*&gt;/i)       {  # line starts with &lt;REC&gt;
       shift @arr;
       getLinkedFiles(@arr);
    } elsif ($arr[0] = m/&lt;\s*link\s*&gt;/i) {  # line starts with &lt;LINK&gt;
       shift @arr;
       readLink(@arr);
    } else {                          # this is a `normal' line
       foreach (@arr) {
         if (m#[{*]#) {               # e.g. /home/gerrit/{.bash*,.exrc,bin/*}
             let_bash_expand_entry();
         } elsif ( -d ) {             # a single directory: traverse
             getLinkedFiles($_);
         } else {                     # a file or a link: just print to list
             printf "$_\n";
         }
       }
    }
 }
</pre>

<p>The configuration file contains file/directory names on each line;
bash shell-globbing syntax is allowed. (In this case, bash is actually
used to expand entries.) Configuration lines starting with &lt;LINK&gt;
mean "<em>I want this symlink to be followed, but I don't care about deep
directory traversal</em>".  You get the full works of directory traversal
plus symlink expansion with deep recursion by using the &lt;REC&gt; tag.
<a href="misc/renker/pack.list-example.txt">Here</a> is an example
configuration file which illustrates the principle.</p>

<p>The <tt>while()</tt> loop iterates over each line of the
<tt>$config</tt> file.  The <tt>split</tt> statement separates single
words into the array <tt>@arr</tt>.  Hence, when a line starts with a
&lt;LINK&gt; or &lt;REC&gt; tag, we need to remove that tag from
<tt>@arr</tt> before passing it as argument to one of the functions;
this is handled by the <tt>shift</tt> statement.  All output from the
invoked subroutines is redirected to the <tt>TMPLIST</tt> temporary
file, containing the expanded list of files, resolved symlinks, and
traversed directories.</p>

<p>We now briefly  look at <tt>getLinkedFiles()</tt>, which maintains a
hash-list <tt>%KNOWN</tt> to avoid cycles and proceeds differently by
these cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li> plain files are just added</li>
  <li> symlinks are resolved via <tt>readlink_recurse()</tt></li>
  <li> directories are only added if their contents are all new;
       otherwise <tt>getLinkedFiles()</tt> is called on the directory contents </li>
</ul>

<p>The <tt>readlink_recurse()</tt> routine in turn calls
<tt>getLinkedFiles()</tt> to resolve new file entries; it contains a
logic to avoid getting lost in symlink loops. This can be a bad trap
otherwise (try e.g. this: <tt>ln -s a b; ln -s b a; namei a</tt>).</p>



<h3>4b) Sort out the temporary filelists: build_list()</h3>

<p>To pick those files that have changed during the last <tt>$days</tt>
days, <tt>build_list()</tt> uses a simple trick: it rewinds the start
time <tt>$^T</tt> (Perl special variable) of the script by this amount
in seconds.  This means that, once file modification times are tested,
Perl already thinks it is executing <tt>$days</tt> back in history:</p>

<tt>$^T -= $days * 24 * 3600;</tt>

<p> The following is the <em>final processing</em> of the file list, refining 
    <tt>TMPLIST</tt> into <tt>LIST</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
while(&lt;TMPLIST&gt;) {
    chomp;
    s#/[^/]+/(\.\.)+/(\S+)#/$2#g;
    error "FATAL:\n \"$_\"\n--$!\n" unless -e $_;

    next if ( (-M ) >= 0 );
    print LIST "$_\n" unless $KNOWN{$_}++;
}
</pre>

<p>After <tt>chomp()</tt>ing the `<tt>\n</tt>', pathnames containing
`..' are normalised: for example, <tt>/usr/local/lib/wx/../../bin/wx2
is</tt> reduced to <tt>/usr/local/bin/wx2</tt>.  If the file does not
exist (e.g., due to a broken symlink), an error message is produced. (An
example output is <a href="misc/renker/error-gdialog.png">here</a>.)</p>

<p>The <em>file age test `-M'</em> returns the time since the file
(<tt>$_</tt>) was last modified; a negative modification age means that
the file was modified in the future. Relative to the rewound start time
<tt>$^T</tt>, this means: all files created during the last
<tt>$days</tt> until now will appear with a negative modification time;
and thus be added to the list.  Last, the filename is printed into the
<tt>LIST</tt> unless it has been encountered before (indicated by a
non-null entry in the hashlist <tt>%KNOWN</tt>).</p>

<p>That's it, the list is built, the file closed, and it's passed on to
<tt>tar</tt> to create the archive.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This part of the article has described how to use a USB stick for
daily directory synchronisation between two non-networked computers. The
principle has been presented on a scaled-down (but fully functional) <a
href="misc/renker/pack_bare_bones.pl.txt">script</a>.  The next part
will introduce additional functionality that simplifies the usage and
makes it robust for many day-to-day situations.</p>

<p>In summary, using USB sticks for synchronising directories between
home and workplace is an efficient, workable, and very cost-effective
solution. Some companies now even give away USB sticks for free, thereby
contributing to a significant reduction in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
of the solution presented in this article.</p>
