Hi gang - 
</p>

<p>
After all this time editing the mailbag, I finally have an actual
question for The Answer Gang. (I've searched the Net, and also asked at
mailing lists for icewm and Inkscape.)
</p>

<p>
I've been using icewm as my window manager, but at this point I either
need to find a way to configure it differently, or switch window
managers altogether.
</p>

<p>
The basic problem is that icewm takes the input and processes it before
Inkscape. (Input in this case is alt-click; there may be other input
that is also an issue, but this is the one I'm aware of.) If I can, I'd
like to bypass it, or alter the keypress combination that icewm is
looking for.
</p>

<p>
The other possibility is finding a better window manager. As an interim
measure, Ben found that ratpoison will at least ignore the alt-click
issue. Unfortunately, ratpoison makes it harder to work in gimp. I know
there are dozens if not hundreds of other window managers, but I'd
really rather not test every single one of them.
</p>

<p>
When I was using ThatOther "OS", one of the things I used quite often was
the IME (Input Method Editor), which allowed me to use a sequence of
keystrokes to alter the way that my keyboard and mouse input was
interpreted. Is there some equivalent that might be my answer here?
</p>

<p>
Hopeful,

By a strange co-incidence I recently switched to "icewm" after "ion3"
was declared experimental and not fit for "etch"!

<p>
The relevant file for "icewm" is $HOME/.icewm/preferences. The
relevant options are below (defaults are commented out). Just change
these to whatever you like.
<pre>
	#  Mouse binding for window move
	# MouseWinMove="Alt+Pointer_Button1"
 
	#  Mouse binding for window resize
	# MouseWinSize="Alt+Pointer_Button3"
</pre>
The "default" preferences file in /usr/share/icewm/preferences lists
all the tweakable things in "icewm" --- and that turns out to be
quite a lot. (The file location is for a Debian system).
</p>


<pre>
&gt; The other possibility is finding a better window manager.
</pre>

<p>
As Thomas Adam will doubtless point out. The completely configurable
window manager is "fvwm".
</p>

<p>
If you like to configure things from a menu interface, then you might
wnat to check out xfce and friends. The associated window manager is
quite configurable. It is the most lightweight of the "integrated
desktop environment" type of systems.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

what are your working habits within a windowing environment?

<p>
I don't really know what you're asking for, here.
</p>

<p>
I use Gimp a lot, which means that I have lots of small windows open,
which should really function as a group. I often have Inkscape or
Scribus open at the same time as Gimp. I usually also have a mutt
session open, and at least one instance of mc.
</p>

<p>
I like being able to keystroke between apps, and to have an easy way of
resizing windows. I don't like to have focus stolen just because I
hovered over the wrong window. I'd really like to find something that
will allow me to type in Japanese (and Russian) easily, but I think
that's wandering offtopic for this particular thread.
</p>

<p>
I like being able to clear off (minimize) all the windows at once, to
have a clean desktop and then re-maximize or restore just a few windows.
I tend to have too many windows open at once. (I should probably use
different er... desktops, is it, where one groups windows/apps?) It would
be be fun to be able to tile all my windows, and then just enlarge one.
I don't mind using a preferences file to change appearances, but I'd
like readable documentation.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if that was not complete enough, too much information, or
entirely the wrong sort of information. I'm reasonably certain that
you'll tell me, though.

<p>
Well, I can't speak for how IceWM works, because I have never used it
properly, but, never wanting to miss a chance to exploit FVWM further,
here's what I can say about how FVWM would do things.  First, a
little history...
</p>

<p>
There's a specification called the ICCCM (Inter-Client Communication
Convention Manual, which attempts to outline how clients (which include
not only applications, but the window manager itself) interoperate so
that they both behave nicely.  It's rather old, and parts of it are
outdated, but that's by-the-by for this discussion.
</p>

<p>
The GIMP sets a property of itself (we call these XAtoms in XLib
parlance), which are hints to the window manager that these windows are
groups and are somehow related, but specifies nothing as to what the
window manager should do in that situation.  The hint is window_group
which is part of the WM_HINTS struct.
</p>

<p>
It works like this:  the main window (the leader of the group as it
were) identfies itself.  It does this by setting WM_CLIENT_LEADER which
is typically its windowid (which is nothing more than a number assigned
to a window each time it is mapped to the screen).  Windows which then
relate to this set themselves up to belong to the leader.
</p>

<p>
The question is then, how is this useful to you?  Well it isn't -- not
really, but it might be the case that other window managers make use of
such a hint.  FVWM happens to do so, but only in a limited capacity.
Basically, what happens is that through the use of style lines (which
tell FVWM how to treat various windows) you can tell it to either:
</p>

<pre>
ScatterWindowGroups
</pre>
or:
</p>

<pre>
KeepWindowGroupsOnDesk
</pre>
The former option is the default, since it could be confusing.  Indeed,
what would happen with 'KeepWindowGropsOnDesk' is that FVWM would then
place all windows which belonged in a group "together", hence you might
say:
</p>

<pre>
Style Gimp KeepWindowGroupsOnDesk
</pre>
Note that the word "Gimp" here is the class of the window [1] which
ensures we don't have to write X number of lines for every possible Gimp
window that you could use.
</p>

<p>
That's all very well, but I would have thought when you say "group"
that's not what you meant, and I'd agree with you.  ;)  Neither of the
style lines above allow for multiple commands to affect all Gimp windows
at once say.  And neither, perhaps would it allow proper placement of
windows.  So here's a few scenarios for you.  Let's say you wanted all
windows of the Gimp to start on a certain page:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
Style Gimp StartsOnPage 1 1
</pre>
You can also force it for a desk, too:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
Style Gimp StartsOnDesk 2
</pre>
If you wanted to, say, iconify all Gimp windows when you iconify one of
them, you could bind something like:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc IconifyAllIfGimp
AddToFunc   IconifyAllIfGimp
+ I ThisWindow (Gimp) All (CurrentPage, !Iconic) Iconify
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) Iconify
</pre>
Which first checks to ensure that if the window we're iconifying is a
Gimp window, then to continue, iconifying all other Gimp windows if
they're not iconic and on the current page.  Otherwise, if it's not a
Gimp window then just iconify it.  Given that most people like to use
the left-hand button of a window to do this, you would hence say:
</p>

<pre>
Mouse 1 1 N IconifyAllIfGimp
</pre>
One could hence extrapolate this further such that if one clicked on
mouse button 2, say, on a window, that it then iconified all windows of
that class on, say, the current page.  Here's how to do that:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc IconifyAllClass
AddToFunc   IconifyAllClass
+ I All ($[w.class], CurrentPage, !Iconic) Iconify
+ I TestRc (NoMatch) Iconify
</pre>
Note the change here -- we no longer need to check for the first
instance of the window, since we don't care what the class of it is.
Instead, we just instruct FVWM to take the current class of the window
we're identifying and apply it for all windows thereof.  This is what
$[w.class] expands to.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I like being able to keystroke between apps, and to have an easy way of
&gt; resizing windows. I don't like to have focus stolen just because I
&gt; hovered over the wrong window. I'd really like to find something that
</pre>

<p>
Hmm, I am not sure what you mean by having focus stolen since that isn't
playing nice at all.  Key-bindings work just like mouse-bindings do.  In
FVWM there's kind of two types:  those which are global (i.e, are
captured by FVWM) and those which are bound to a specific window.  As I
have previously outlined [2] key/mouse bindings are greedy with respect
to the window manager, but they can be mitigated by specifying to FVWM
that a certain key-binding is to only apply to a specific window.  To do
this, you would say:
</p>

<pre>
Key (some_window_name) F A C some_action
</pre>
Where "some_action" is a command or function that FVWM understabds.
Note that in the above this binding would only work if the application
focused was called 'some_window_name'.  
</p>

<p>
Conversely of course, it's desirable that in some instances FVWM
shouldn't blindly be greedy with its key-grabbing tendencies, and in
situations where they are bound window-specifically (as above) you would
then say:
</p>

<pre>
Key (some_window_name) F A C --
</pre>
... which instructs FVWM to propagate the event down to the application
rather than capturing it for itself.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; will allow me to type in Japanese (and Russian) easily, but I think
&gt; that's wandering offtopic for this particular thread.
</pre>

<p>
That's more for switching keyboard translations, no?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I like being able to clear off (minimize) all the windows at once, to
&gt; have a clean desktop and then re-maximize or restore just a few windows.
</pre>

<p>
You've more or less seen how to do this in FVWM, and there's any number
of ways you could do this.  Something as simple as:
</p>

<pre>
All (CurrentPage, !Iconic) Iconify
</pre>
... will do just that, but restoring these windows is more problematic.
The simple condition here of course is that it will allow you to select
(through the application's icon) which windows to restore.  You could
also load FvwmIconMan, or use WinList, or FvwmWinList to do the window
selection, but not the iconification.
</p>

<p>
As for restoring all windows once they've been iconified, you would need
to mark them in some way, and then iconify them:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc IconifyAndRestore
AddToFunc   IconifyAndRestore
+ I All (CurrentPage, !Iconic) State 1
+ I All (State 1, CurrentPage, !Iconic) Iconify
</pre>
The other half of the equation is to then restore them:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
DestroyFunc Restore
AddToFunc   Restore
+ I All (State 1, Iconic, CurrentPage) Iconify 
+ I All (State 1) !State 1
</pre>
You can of course combine to two functions to do both sets of
operations if desired.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I tend to have too many windows open at once. (I should probably use
&gt; different er...desktops, is it, where one groups windows/apps?) It would

<p>
That's one solution, yes.

&gt; I don't mind using a preferences file to change appearances, but I'd
&gt; like readable documentation.
</pre>

<p>
In terms of tiling, you could use the FvwmRearrange module to do this.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I don't know if that was not complete enough, too much information, or
&gt; entirely the wrong sort of information. I'm reasonably certain that
&gt; you'll tell me, though.
</pre>

<p>
I've given you loose snippets really in conjunction with ideas, the
purpose of which is really just to demonstrate what can be done.  I am
happy to expand it further if it would be of help to you.  I don't know,
alas, whether IceWM is capable of doing anything suggested tus far.

WOW. Thank you for all that! It's taken me some time to go through and
digest what you wrote, and at the very least I now have a much better
understanding of the mechanics of window management. When I'm ready to
tackle customizing my window manager, I'll definitely refer back to
this. For right now, I think my focus needs to be on the applications
I'm busy acquiring facility with, rather than WM-tweaking.

Something that you can set certain (IMHO 'rude') WMs to do, but it's

Well...it <strong>could</strong> be, if what I wanted to do was remember
keyboard mappings and switch keyboards, even if just "logically" (as
opposed to physically. What I want to do instead is to be able to type
in using a nifty and well-established kludge - typing in Western ASCII
and having a bit of code that translates that all into whatever proper
portion of the Unicode. In Wind0ws, it's an IME. I don't know yet what
the equivalent is for Debian (or *nix in general), as I don't know what
to look for.

the emacs of wms. ;)

Thanks for the thorough answer, Thomas. I'll mull it over and let you
know if I've got more specific requests. If we were in geographic
proximity, I'd just offer to buy you a drink and make you dinner, and
see if you'd sit down with me while I specified what I wanted, but
that's a bit much to ask for over this narrow-bandwidth communication.

<p>
Just to comment on this as the tastes are different:
The focus follows mouse/focus-under-mouse is one of the first things I
switch on (fvwm, kde, gnome,..) and the why is this:
I have two overlapping windows like a large [x]emacs window and a shell
window. I want to transfer information from the shell in emacs.  So I
put the shell-window in front and the editor behind it and I want to
type something in the editor while it <strong>stays</strong> behind the
shell. Yes, I could get the same by telling the shell "alway stay on
top" but then I've to set/reset that all the time. I combine this with 2
keys that bring a focused window to the front or pushes it back and
another for iconify. Something I stole from the SUN keyboards which had
real front/back keys.  
</p>

<p>
My main gripe with focus-on-click is not that I have to click (even if I
would forget that all the time) but I want to type in a partially
visible window without it jumping in front of everything messing up a
carefully arranged overlap of several windows.
</p>

<p>
BTW: gnome allows me to type in a partially hidden window -- but the
moment I paste with the middle-mouse button it still jumps to the
front. Is their a way to suppress that?

I think this is not a "feature" of GNOME but of the window manager
(probably metacity).

<p>
good hint -- sure enough ps found an instance of metacity, and Google
told be a little bit later that I would like to
set /apps/metacity/general/raise_on_click to false. This leaves
special-key-click and click-on-borders still active for raising, just as
I would expect it to do. 
</p>


<p>
I was using fvwm2 since kernel 2.0 -- then I got real fast CPUs, and KDE
wasn't that bad an option, anymore. Some things one can get used to in
KDE. Then the last install was an Ubuntu 6.10 with default GNOME and --
well it felt like a light version of KDE: I wasn't missing much apart
from fine-grained window handling setting -- GNOME is not providing all
the metacity options in the window-preferences. A Web site pointed me to
gconf-edit -- which lists all options of metacity. 
</p>

<p>
Learned something again -- thanks.

You're welcome.

<pre>
&gt; Focus dependent not on a mouseclick, but simply on hover. Feh.
&gt; Something that you can set certain (IMHO 'rude') WMs to do, but it's
&gt; generally not a default. I don't remember where I saw it as such, but I
&gt; recall it driving me buggy - I do have a vague recollection that it was
&gt; something that was changeable.
</pre>

<p>
Ah, OK.  What you're describing here is having a window raise above all
others when the mouse hovers over it?  That's typically called
AutoRaise, and FVWM has a module which provides this functionality in
the form of FvwmAuto.  You'll be pleased to know it's not used by
default.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<pre>
&gt; Well...it <strong>could</strong> be, if what I wanted to do was remember keyboard
&gt; mappings and switch keyboards, even if just "logically" (as opposed to
&gt; physically. What I want to do instead is to be able to type in using a
&gt; nifty and well-established kludge - typing in Western ASCII and having a
&gt; bit of code that translates that all into whatever proper portion of the
&gt; Unicode. In Wind0ws, it's an IME. I don't know yet what the equivalent
&gt; is for Debian (or *nix in general), as I don't know what to look for.
</pre>

<p>
I'll get back to you -- you can do it, I've just forgotten how.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; It wouldn't surprise me if I <strong>could</strong> find a way to do this in IceWM. (I
&gt; expected that fvwm was able to do this, my impression of it is that it's
&gt; the emacs of wms. ;)
</pre>

<p>
Heh, kind of.  Just that it doesn't come with the kitchen sink or
mindless bloat.  ;)
</p>

<p>
Arlo Guthrie would have perhaps said:  "You can get anything you want at
Alice's Restaurant."
</p>

<p>
You might be able to do bits and pieces of what I've talked about in
IceWM -- but for some of the more esoteric operations you might well
have to use something like 'xwit' to help you; at least when Ben and I
have discussed such things, that was the impression I got.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Thanks for the thorough answer, Thomas. I'll mull it over and let you
&gt; know if I've got more specific requests. If we were in geographic
&gt; proximity, I'd just offer to buy you a drink and make you dinner, and
&gt; see if you'd sit down with me while I specified what I wanted, but
&gt; that's a bit much to ask for over this narrow-bandwidth communication.
</pre>

<p>
Hmm, what's that phrase?  "Aww, shucks"?  :*)  I don't mind creating
something for you in the least -- would be interesting to detail it for
you step-by-step so you can see the process of its creation.  Regardless
of geographic location (would you cook fish, only I love fish.  :D), I
more or less have done the same thing for Faber which spawned the Kiosk
article in #128.  
</p>

<p>
By all means, detail what it is you would like, take a few screenshots
also if you think it would help, and I would be honoured to write
something that FVWM could understand.  I just don't want to try and move
you away from something you're used to using though.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
It'll give you some time, at least.  I won't be back at a computer until
Tuesday (public bank holiday).
