<title>Open Source Business Conference, San Francisco</title>

<body> 

<h2>Open Source Business Conference (OSBC), San Francisco, Westin St. Francis.</h2>
 
<p> This was a short 2 day conference with 4 separate tracks for Venture
Capitalists, Lawyers [seriously, there was an Intelluctual Property track],
IT managers, and open source geeks. But over all a strong business
orientation prevailed [plus a lot of shiney shoes and wool suits]. </p>

<p> There were lots of industry celebrities and many interesting
presentations. None of the keynote or presentation materials, however,
have been made available to conference participants, either on the web or
by CD. This link describes the tracks: <a

<p> A small expo with emerging open source firms rounded out the event.
Included were firms like SugarCRM, Zend. ForJ, and SpikeSource. Most of
the firms from the first OSBC in 2004 had merged or been acquired by larger
fish. </p>

<h3>Geof Moore's Keynote</h3> 

<p> Geoffrey Moore, visionary author of the influential book &quot;Crossing
the Chasm&quot;, spoke at a first day keynote and concluded that a variety
of open-source projects are making the leap into the mainstream and wide
adoption. He applied the technology evaluation methods of his book and
workshops to the world of OSSw.  </p>

<p> Moore said that key projects had, in his terminology, &quot;crossed the
chasm&quot; into business acceptance and now appealed to a growing group of
customers.  </p>

<p> Among the projects he believes have crossed over to mainstream use are
Linux on servers [and in embedded devices], the Apache Web server, and the
MySQL database. That means companies can be confident using OSSw deeply
within their businesses.  </p>

<p> Moore concluded by borrowing from Maslow's Hierarchy of Human Needs and
recast it for the Open Source movement (as a hierarchy of definition):

<ul>
	<li>An open product model
	<li>A value-added services model
	<li>A community of users 
	<li>Altruistic or ego-driven behavior
	<li>A new business tactic. [I think he meant this in the best possible sense....]
</ul>

<p> Kim Polese, new CEO at SpikeSource, gave a speech on &quot;coping with
commodity SW&quot; which cited the benefits and risks of an open source
approach. SpikeSource provides a <a
href="http://spikesource.com/sitemgr/developer.php?nav=coreStack">certified
stack</a> of OSSw to customers along with support.  </p>

<p> Besides the cost reductions, there are integration challenges.
&quot;With Open Source software, you don't know what works with what,&quot;
she said. And this issue grows as more products go open source. This
represents a business opportunity for companies like BlueGlue and now
SpikeSource.  </p>

<p> She cited interviews with some 50 CIOs showing big concerns with open
source involve patching, versioning, and the need to develop compatibility
test suites. The CIOs all say, she noted, that they &quot;save 30% or more
in vendor costs but worry they will waste 20% of their TCO&quot; on
component testing and troubleshooting problems.  </p>

<p> This is the market that SpikeSource is pursuing with its LAMP software
stack and Java varients. The value proposition for users is to go beyond
the SW and build new products on the standardization open source brings.
</p>

<p> Besides getting Kim Polese as CEO, SpikeSource announced the formation
of an advisory board in March that includes open source community leaders
Mitchell Baker, Brian Behlendorf, Dirk Hohndel, Robert Lefkowitz, Marten
Mickos, Tim O&rsquo;Reilly, David Stutz, Larry Rosen and Steve Weber.  </p>

<p> SpikeSource is already testing and validating a number of components
from ISVs and open source providers, including Apache Axis, Apache
Geronimo, Business Objects, JBoss, Lucene, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Pramati,
Sleepycat Software and SugarCRM across various operating system platforms.
Open Source development projects can qualify for free SpikeSource testing
and validation services.  </p>

<h3>Microsoft and Open Source</h3>

<p> That's not a misprint. Jason Matusow, Director of Microsoft's Shared
Source Initiative, spoke at length on <a href="ms-ossw.jpg">Redmond's view
of OSSw</a> as an adjunct to commercial SW development. Not surprisingly,
he suggested that customers preferred the services and support of a large
commercial vendor [ natch :-) ] in development of Operating Systems and
mission-critical platforms. What was interesting is that now Microsoft is
experimenting with limited OSSw projects for utilities, including 20
offerings involving 1,500,000 developers worldwide. Matusow cited a
SourceForge project for the Windows Installer XML: <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/wix">HTTP://www.sourceforge.net/projects/wix</a>.
</p>

<p> Among the slides and varied commentary, Matusow cited the complexity of
a major OS which may require large companies [or a large community] for
support, and pointed out that, historically, patch numbers go up over time
and as versions progress [i.e., Linux patching will eventually become more
like MS patching]. So the increasing patching "... demonstrates the
amount of engineering effort from Novell and Red Hat." He demonstrated 2 graphs
as supporting evidence -
<ul>
<li> <a href="ms-9-patches.jpg">ms-9-patches.jpg</a> 
<li> <a href="ms-10-changes.jpg">ms-10-changes.jpg</a>
</ul>
</p>

<p> - and added a slide showing the <a href="MS-Linux-Contrib.jpg">10 top
contributors to the Linux kernel</a>, with 8 of those being engineers
employed at major IT corporations. Finally, he pointed out a link on the
MSDN web site summarizing <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/Government/opensource.mspx"
>Redmond's position on SSSw</a>.


<h3>&quot;Meet the Community&quot;</h3>

<p> At the close of the conference, the panel &quot;Meet the
Community&quot; featured active open source luminaries answering questions
from the audience. The line-up was impressive: Christian Enfeldt from
Digital Tipping Point [and the Mad Penguin column] as moderator, Brian
Behlendorf of the Apache Foundation [and also CTO of Collabranet], Larry
Wall, self-defined Perl Architect [and chief developer], Josh Berkes from
the PostgreSQL development team, Chris Hoffman of Mozilla, and Doug
Wheeler, lead developer of the Bricolage Project [content management using
Perl, Apache, and PostgreSQL - also President of Kineticode], addressing a
range of questions. </p>

<p> Many in the audience wanted to know how companies could best get
involved but stay clear of legal hurdles. All said that contributors were
always welcome. </p>

<p> Josh cited support from Sun and IBM and noted that Red Hat and Fujitsu
have salaried engineers working on Mozilla. He said he'd like to develop a
more formal process for the involvement of corporations.  </p>

<p> Brian Behlendorf explained that the Apache Foundation sees only the
individual contributors but, as a 501-C3 non-profit, Apache does get
corporate donations, mostly hardware from IBM and Sun. &quot;But some of
our most creative output comes from people,&quot; he said, &quot;who are
not involved in this work for their day jobs. They have nothing to lose, no
professional investment... so they can reach further.&quot; </p>

<p> This was a conference for OSSw principals. That would include geeks
that want to or are trying to start an OSSw business. It seemed good for
networking and info sharing; it was also a showcase for corporations
interested in sharing their OSSw experiments and experiences. And the boxed
lunches weren't too bad.  </p>
