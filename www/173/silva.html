<h1>Quick and Dirty Web Filtering on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

<p>Have you ever mistyped a web address and ended up somewhere you
definitely did not want to go? You miss one letter in the URL, and instead
of getting to your favorite site, you end up in the virtual red light
district! So what if instead of you making this mistake, it's your child
accidentally going to these questionable sites? I have two kids, an eight
and a ten year old, and both of them have been actively playing Flash-based
kids' games online since they were two years old. So lately I've been
thinking of solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>There are plenty of non-open-source solutions to help parents filter the
material that their little ones are being exposed to on the web. But I
didn't find that many open source and simple solutions available online.
That's why I decided to explore a couple of different options to solve my
web filtering problem: Squid and Dansguardian.</p>

<p><i>Using only Squid</i> will get you the very basic functionality to
allow your younger child to access a pretty limited number of sites. If
your kids are a little older, and require a bit more 'freedom' on the World
Wide Web, then skip the next section in this article and jump to <a
href="#Using_Dansguardian_with_Squid">Using Dansguardian with
Squid</a>.</p>

<h3>
  Using only Squid:
</h3>

<p>I've used Squid to set up my system so that my kids' browsers only
access the web addresses that I want them to. Everything else out there is
out of reach for them. In the instructions below, I assume that the Squid
proxy service will be running on the same computer that the children will
be using, but that is not a requirement.</p>

<p>First, let's install Squid on our Fedora system:</p>

<pre class="code">
su -
yum install -y squid
chkconfig squid on
</pre>


<p>Next, we edit the file /etc/squid/squid.conf.</p>

<p>1. Find the line on the configuration file with: <em>#Recommendend minimum configuration:</em></p>

Under that line there will be a few rules starting with the word acl. At
the end of the acl block, add the following line:
<pre class="code">
acl safekids dstdomain .kidsite.com .kidsite2.com
</pre>

<p>Replace .kidsite.com and .kidsite2.com with a list of the sites you want
your children to be able to visit. You can list a full address like:
www.kids.com, but then if your child tried to go to a subdomain like
games.kids.com, Squid would block it. Add a dot (.) in front of the domain
to make a wildcard that will allow any subdomain to go through.</p>

<p>2. Find the line: <i># INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS</i></p>

<p>Below that line, find the line that says "http_access allow localhost", and comment it out by adding a '#' in front of it:</p>
<pre class="code"># http_access allow localhost</pre>

<p>3. Above the line http_access deny all, add:</p>
<pre class="code">http_access allow safekids</pre>

<p>4. Start Squid service:</p>
<pre class="code">service squid start</pre>

<p>[Optional] 5. If you are going to use Squid on a separate server, open
up port 3128 on your firewall to allow the browser to talk to Squid.</p>

<pre class="code">iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 3128 -j ACCEPT</pre>

<p>[Optional] 6. Save your iptables settings so it will persist through reboots</p>
<pre class="code">
service iptables save
</pre>

<p>Done. This should have your squid proxy server all set up and running.
The major downside of this set up is that it is a lot of manual work to
keep a 'whitelist' of allowable sites for your kids to visit, especially as
they grow older and start needing to use the Internet for school work.</p>

<a id="Using_Dansguardian_with_Squid">
<h3>
  Using Dansguardian with Squid:
</h3>

<p>So, what's Dansguardian exactly? It is "software designed to control
which websites users can access. It also includes virus filtering and usage
monitoring features." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DansGuardian/">[1]</a> In this section of the article, I will show you
how to get up and running and interacting with Squid, allowing you to add
sites to its banned or exception lists. Dansguardian will use Squid as its
way to communicate with the World Wide Web to filter content.</p>

<p>Installing Dansguardian and Squid on Fedora:
<pre class="code">
yum -y install dansguardian squid
chkconfig dansguardian on
chkconfig squid on
service squid start
</pre>

<p>Unlike the previous section Using Squid, we can use the default
installation of Squid. To get dansguardian working in Fedora, there isn't
much work to do either.</p>

<p>First, verify /etc/dansguardian/dansguardian.conf, and make sure you have the following parameters set like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
# the port that DansGuardian listens to.
filterport = 8080

# the ip of the proxy (default is the loopback - i.e. this server)
proxyip = 127.0.0.1

# the port DansGuardian connects to proxy on
proxyport = 3128
</pre>

<p>Next start the service:</p>
<pre class="code">
service dansguardian start
</pre>

<p>Finally, if you do have firewall rules, open up port 8080 for connection:</p>
<pre class="code">
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT 
</pre>

<p>And to make it persist across reboots:</p>
<pre class="code">
service iptables save
</pre>

<p>You should now be able to configure your web browser to connect to port
8080 and use dansguardian as the proxy on your kids accounts. Be aware that
dansguardian although less restrictive than just using Squid to do web
filtering can still be quite restrictive. If you would like to bypass some
of its rules, and open up some sites for your kids, it's quite simple.
</p>

<p>Take a look at the <i>/etc/dansguardian/lists</i> directory and get to
know all the rules that are set out of the box for dansguardian. If you
would like to whitelist a site, edit the file <i>exceptionsitelist</i> and
add the site you'd like whitelisted. Once you are done editing the file,
bounce dansguardian to load the changes.</p>

<pre class="code">
service dansguardian restart
</pre>

<h3>
  Configuring the Client:
</h3>

<p>Now that we have our server set up, we need to set up the childâ€™s
browser to use our dansguardian [or squid] filter:</p>

<p>I will note that this method can be easily be circumvented. I don't
recommend it for computer-savvy older kids, but it should work fine for
your kindergarten to elementary school aged kids. One could always get
fancier and remap ports on the kids machine to directly go to the proxy
making it a bit harder for whiz kids to by pass it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start Firefox (in this case I am using Firefox 2).</li>
<li>Go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced.</li>
<li>Select the Network Tab.</li>
<li>Click "Settings..." under "Connection."</li>

<div id=j:7y style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
  <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_58f3hd73f6_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:573px;WIDTH:622px>
</div>


<li>Under the new "Connection Settings" window, select "Manual proxy configuration."</li>


<div id=ngz7 style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
  <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_599t6x5ccs_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:551px;WIDTH:510px>
</div>


<li>For HTTP Proxy, enter the IP of your dansguardian server and port 8080 [or 3216 if only using squid]. If your dansguardian (or even squid) service is running locally on the same machine as the browser, use "localhost."</li>
<li>Click "OK."</li>
<li>Close Firefox Preferences.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now only the sites that meet dansguardian rules will be allowed in, otherwise your kids will get an out of the box message like the image below.</p>


<div id=x0lq style=TEXT-ALIGN:center>
  <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_60gmvsj5g9_b.jpg" style=HEIGHT:554.907px;WIDTH:648px>
</div>


<p>If you have more than one computer set up to connect to a proxy port
other than 8080, like squid's 3128, you can add the following rule to your
proxy server to redirect traffic:</p>
<pre class="code">
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 3128 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
</pre>

<p>And then run:</p>

<pre class="code">service iptables save</pre>

<p>to persist change through reboots.</p>

<p>Overall, this is not a foolproof filter. All you have to do to
circumvent it is turn off the manual proxy on the browser, but I hope that
with my eight&nbsp; and ten year olds, I still have a few years to come up
with a more robust solution.</p>
