HI, I've already tried to sync.time solaris client to the Windows Time server, but it's always failed. but when I sync. with another solaris timer server it's succeed.
What should I do..?
</p>


<p>
Thanks

I assume that you use the Network Time Protocol (NTP, see
<a href="http://www.ntp.org/">http://www.ntp.org/</a>) in order to query the MS Windows server for its
time. Unless you do not have a NTP service on the Windows machine this
won't work. AFAIK the Windows Time Service can only be queried by
Windows clients. I don't recall having seen a tool that can do this
under Linux or Solaris.=20
</p>

<p>
Provided your network is "big enough" I'd set up a local time server and
have other servers query this machine by means of NTP.

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.

In fact, I don't think that this is even possible - unless you come up
with a way to "reverse" the whole messed-up system that Wind0ws Time
Service uses. This is one of those places where Unix and Wind0ws are
fundamentally incompatible: in Unix, UTC is the basis of the time system
and is modified by local settings; in Wind0ws, the local time is the
basis... and it results in incredibly ugly hacks (e.g., see recent
discussion about changing file time stamps during the DST change in the
RISKS Digest.)

<p>
Yep. Wind0ws can use NTP easily enough; Unix just can't use their
version. Pretty typical.

Um... doesn't Samba do that?
</p>

<pre>
net time set
</pre>
should set the system time to that of a windows (or Samba <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> server,
same as it does on Windows. (Putting aside the question of whether or
not it's a good idea to do so...)

I forgot that Samba does just that. Although it would be interesting to
test if it is "properly" broken in the same exact way that Wind0ws is. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
