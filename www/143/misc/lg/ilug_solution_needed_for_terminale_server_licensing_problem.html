&gt; There are alternatives to MS Project, most of them done in Java.
&gt; This one (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openproj/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/openproj/</a>) looks very
&gt; MS-Projectish. It's Open Source....
</pre>

<p>
Sadly, no, it's not.  Quoting my summary at "Project Management" on
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Apps/:">http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Apps/:</a> 
</p>

<p>
   Licence is deceptively claimed to be open source, but in fact is MPL
   1.1 plus a proprietary "badgeware" addendum that impairs third-party
   commercial usage by requiring that derivative works include mandatory
   advertising of OpenProj publisher Projity's name and trademarked logo on
   "each user interface screen" while specifically denying users a
   trademark licence.

I just installed OpenProj on my system and Its using "Common Public 
Attribution License Version 1.0 (CPAL)" (Atleast in the Beta 2.1 version)
</p>

<p>
And CPAL is a valid OpenSource license: 
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpal_1.0">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cpal_1.0</a> . I guess they must have 
changed licenses recently. Thought I should bring it to your attention.

<p>
Thank you, Suramya.  Here's what I just posted back to the ILUG list:
</p>

<p>
---&lt;snip&gt;---
</p>

<p>
Correction:  They have now (recently, at least for the 2.1 beta) changed 
to Socialtext's CPAL (Common Public Attribution License), which was
recently certified as open source by OSI.  CPAL is a very much toned
down version of the badgeware idea, fixing the Open Source Definition-
oriented objections of people on OSI's license-discuss mailing list
(including yr. humble correspondent).
</p>

<p>
CPAL requires that redistributions or derivatives of covered Web / ASP / 
SaaS applications flash a display on the work's graphical user interface
if any, for a reasonable time sufficient for the user to notice, stating
a required, brief notice identifying the original developer.
Commentators on license-discuss considered CPAL to encumber usage but
not to any meaningful degree, such that it's a slight nuisance but
doesn't substantially impair freedom of usage.
</p>

<p>
I'm about to correct my knowledgebase entry.
</p>

<p>
---&lt;snip&gt;---
</p>


<p>
In some ways (but not others), this provision might be compared to the 
original BSD licence's "advertising clause", specifically in being, in
Stallman's words, an "obnoxious" clause that is likely to impair
formation of a long-term commons surrounding the software, and keep the
covered code in a neglected code ghetto -- but nonetheless not
proprietary in any meaningful sense.
</p>

<p>
I hope to have more to say about this matter in the <em>Gazette</em>, soon.  
Basically, the whole notion of "attribution" licences for hosted
applications was a badly thought-out solution to the "ASP loophole"
problem in the first place.  CPAL is a meticulous, thoughtfully repaired
revision of that flawed original concept (for which we should give
thanks to some hard and work from volunteer OSI General Counsel and
(non-volunteer) Socialtext attorney Mark F. Radcliffe[1]), but there are
better, entirely different approaches to the "ASP loophole" conundrum
that don't impair usage.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, if people think OSI erred in approving CPAL, then please do
blame me in part.  I posted one of the few comments to the CPAL
proposal, as follows:

  Subject: Re: For Approval: Common Public Attribution License (CPAL)
</p>

<p>
  Quoting Matthew Flaschen (matthew.flaschen@gatech.edu):
</p>

<p>
  &gt; "Prominent" is flexible, but only to a point.  The logo can be small and
  &gt; briefly displayed, but not too small or brief because "the display
  &gt; [must] be of sufficient duration to give reasonable notice".  I.E. if a
  &gt; reasonable user wouldn't be able to notice all the attributions, they
  &gt; aren't prominent.
</p>

<p>
  As brief meta-commentary, I do agree with the concern about logo
  accumulation in derivative works, and have voiced it myself, <em>but</em> feel
  that some sense of proportion should be applied, in judging the proper
  extent of that concern.  Yes, an important aim of open source is to make
  code borrowing lawful and practical (to the extent that licence
  compatibility allows), but, realistically, Nicholas Goodman's
  logo-overload scenario is (even under the early badgeware licenses with
  fixed-size logos on every page) a severe (yet amusing) over-exaggeration
  of what could ever <em>actually</em> happen in the real world.
</p>

<p>
  In the real world, derivative works from ten-plus badgeware-licensed
  Web apps would seem extremely unlikely:  Old code <em>does</em> get junked or
  totally rewritten over time (except in chthonian COBOL underworlds, I
  guess), rather than remaining eternally like a fossil inclusion to
  bedevil engineers and company lawyers.
</p>

<p>
  I'm trying to say:  Let's be tolerant of licence-created problem scenarios
  that seem, at best, on the far end of "unlikely to actually occur".
</p>


<p>
After a suitable period for comment from the license-discuss membership,
in which few comments other than mine were provided, OSI's Board voted
recently to certify CPAL as OSD-compliant.
