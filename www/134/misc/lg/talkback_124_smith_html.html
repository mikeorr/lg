Good afternoon
</p>

<p>
I've been trying to get multihead to work for 2 months now. I saw
several different solutions for the problem but no that meet my needs.
I'm trying to run a two seat gaming station. I proved that it is
actually possible since i could run a dual head with xinerama and one
game in each screen ( but only one keyboard controlling both screens
). I'm running on two nvidia video cards, with nvidia drivers :
<pre>
00:09.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4
MX 4000 AGP 8x] (rev c1)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX
5200] (rev a1)
</pre>
Thanks to the at nvclock i could do some tweaking to get reasonable
speed. My problem is altough i could run it with xinerama, when i try
to separate the seats- put one keyboard, one mouse, one video card for
each seat - the system does not show the second screen. I tried with
both gdm and kdm to get the thing to work.
When i try to start each head individually i can, but i cannot
separate each mouse and keyboard: they work as if they were the same.
</p>

<p>
That problem has keep me up several nights. My xorg.conf follows so
you would point up were i screwd up or if i didn't :
