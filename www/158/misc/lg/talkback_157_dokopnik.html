I noticed the use if the verb "administrating" in the article, where to me the 
natural verb is "administering" and I started to wonder where this variant 
came from. I have seen this before in many technical articles and I would 
like to know whether all USians use administrate instead of administer, or 
whether it is specific to the administration of computers?

It appears to be a (rare, recent) neologism, possibly from software,
possibly not.  However, thankfully, it is <em>not</em> in widespread use in
the USA or anywhere else of my acquaintance.

In my case it came from a mix of the book title - Administrative -

basically the same thing in Portuguese.

I could also have its origin from native German speakers. In German
"administering" means "administrieren" which is very close to
"administrating". I also heard this variant frequently from native
German speakers speaking English.

No; it's not at all a non-native English speaker's mistake, it's
simply an English-speaker's mistake[1] <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
It's simply a false derivation: 'administration', particularly in this
context, is simply more common than 'administer'. As people are more
familiar with the noun, they apply a verb derivation rule, and produce
'administrate', unaware that, properly, the noun 'administration' is a
derivative of the verb 'administer'[2] -- in short, being able to come
up with 'administrate' hints at a good command of English grammar, but
with a small lapse in vocabulary.

No, we did not come up with it. The Katly One had to parse it and type
it out while working as a transcription operator for the deaf.

I.e., 12600 for 'administer' and 75 for 'administrate'. I think that
people are taking "system administration" as a departure point and then
converting it to "administrate a system" - incorrectly, in my opinion,
perhaps primarily because it sounds so clunky - instead of "administer a
system". There's something rather appealing in the image of someone
"(ad)ministering to a system", anyway; it invokes the image of a kind
nurse [1] rather than that of someone with a large stake-driving mallet,
a running chainsaw, and a hell of an uncompromising attitude.
</p>


<p>
[1] Of course, we all know that the spirit of Simon Travaglia's creation
still lives on and that the latter is far more likely to be true... but,
y'know, we wouldn't have jobs if the cash customers ever found out, so
we've got to keep up the pretense. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
