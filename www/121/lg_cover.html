Heather got started in computing before she quite got started learning
English.  By 8 she was a happy programmer, by 15 the system administrator
for the home... Dad had finally broken down and gotten one of those personal
computers, only to find it needed regular care and feeding like any other
pet.  Except it wasn't a Pet: it was one of those brands we find most 
everywhere today...  

<P> Heather is a hardware agnostic, but has spent more hours as a tech in
Windows related tech support than most people have spent with their computers.
(Got the pin, got the Jacket, got about a zillion T-shirts.)  When she
discovered Linux in 1993, it wasn't long before the home systems ran Linux
regardless of what was in use at work.

<P> By 1995 she was training others in using Linux - and in charge of all the 
"strange systems" at a (then) 90 million dollar company.  Moving onwards, it's
safe to say, Linux has been an excellent companion and breadwinner... She 
took over the HTML editing for "The Answer Guy" in issue 28, and has been 
slowly improving the preprocessing scripts she uses ever since.

<P> Here's an autobiographical filksong she wrote called
<A HREF="../issue67/misc/tag/filksong-programmers-daughter.txt">The Programmer's Daughter</A>.
