<h1>Jetty: The Twelve Year Journey to Market Maturity</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/lieber.html">Adam Lieber</a></b></p>

<p class="editorial">
Normally, I'd redirect content like this (advertising, to be frank) to
our NewsBytes team, to be brutally stripped down and turned
into a minimal press release <a id="lieber.html_1_back"></a><a
href="#lieber.html_1">[1]</a> - but somehow, perhaps because it seemed a
little more sincere than the average product puffery, or perhaps because
it's Jetty's birthday, or maybe because it's the holiday season here in the
US and I've read a few too many O'Henry stories when I was young - I
stopped just short of it. Heck, maybe publishing this will encourage other
open source projects to wax lyrical about their particular baby and explain
to us all exactly why their hunk of code is so amazingly wonderful.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
Sometimes (especially right after I accidentally discover a piece of FOSS
software that does exactly what I've desperately needed a program to do,
possibly for years), I think that we as a community take this "we don't do
$200M advertising campaigns with naked cuties and catchy jingles" attitude
too far; there's nothing wrong with at least a few catchy tunes and a naked
cutie or two - especially when done by enthusiastic volunteers. Even Linus
Torvalds has been known to describe the goal of Linux as "World domination.
Fast. [...] and scantily clad females, of course. Who cares if it's below
zero outside." So, why not start somewhere?...
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[sigh] I'm rambling again. Perhaps I've been proofreading these articles a
little too long and it's time for a shot of <a
href="http://www.crownwineandspirits.com/images/Product/large/Nassau-Royale-Liqueur.jpg">Nassau
Royale</a>. But my point about the cuties - with or without some jammin'
music - remains; any FOSS project that can play a jingle and show some
wiggle (well, OK, it's also got to be a good project, but there's LOTS of
those) is sure to be wildly popular, and I'm officially pinning my hopes to
seeing it in the near future. Legacy software won't have a leg to stand on.

<p>
Jetty was written as a lightweight Java web and application server and
in many ways it has been ahead of its time.  Jetty with Cometd handles
two-way communications via a method known as long-polling which allows
servers to efficiently handle requests in an environment where constant
or long-lived communication is needed between the server and the client.
</p>

<p>
Each month, Jetty grows in number of users and market share. With the
rise of rich Internet applications and the need for increased
embeddability, Jetty has become increasingly popular and is on track to
become the leading Web and application server. To celebrate its 12th
year, here are 12 things that are interesting about Jetty:
</p>

<h3>1. Jetty was originally written as an issue tracker application</h3>

<p>
1995 – America was in a media frenzy over the OJ Simpson murder trial,
Microsoft had released Windows 95, and at Mort Bay Consulting Limited in
Australia, Greg Wilkins created what was possibly the first Java web
application, an issue tracking system served over HTTP from a Java
server. It soon became apparent that there was a lot more interest in
the HTTP server within the issue tracking application than in the
application itself. By 1996, the HTTP server was spun out as an early
form of Jetty.
</p>

<h3>2. Jetty was originally named MBServler</h3>

<p>
Named for Mort Bay, an area of Sydney, the first itineration of Jetty
was called Mort Bay SERVLet servER, or MBServler for short. The leading
figures behind Jetty, Greg Wilkins and Jan Bartel, were not entirely
happy with this. “We changed it to Jetty pretty quickly,” says
Wilkins. The Mort Bay logo is an image of Sydney Harbour which includes
a small jetty. As the word jetty started with a J, it was picked as the
new name for the Java web server.
</p>

<h3>3. Jetty has frequently broken tests that try to benchmark it</h3>

<p>
Jetty breaks most benchmarking tools, as it is designed to scale to many
thousands of simultaneous requests and connections. Most HTTP
benchmarking tools do not support the asynchronous features needed to
scale to such levels and thus bottleneck at a few hundred or a thousand
connections. Jetty now includes an asynchronous HTTP client that was
written initially just to be able to test tens of thousands of
simultaneous requests and connections.
</p>

<h3>4. More people are using Jetty than you might think</h3>

<p>
Jetty is used by a huge number of brands and applications. In fact, many
people use Jetty and don’t even realize it. Eclipse, BEA WebLogic
Event Server, Apache Geronimo, Zimbra, IBM Tivoli Netview, Sybase EA
Server, IGN.com and Chess.com all use Jetty behind the scenes. In fact,
the first WiFi access provided at Starbucks was handled by a proxy based
on Jetty. Apache Maven also works great with Jetty. And there are many
more – a full list can be found at
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Jetty+Powered">http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Jetty+Powered</a>
</p>  

<h3>5. Hundreds of thousands of domains are active on Jetty</h3>

<p>
Netcraft is a company that provides research and analysis on numerous
aspects of the internet. Netcraft makes it possible to see how many
instances of Jetty are directly linked to the Internet, as opposed to
behind a firewall. According to the company, there are hundreds of
thousands of domains active on Jetty – and this is very likely to be a
conservative estimate.
</p>

<h3>6. Jetty was designed backwards</h3>

<p>
One of the reasons that Jetty is so prevalent is that it was designed to
be a good software component, and it happens to also be a software
container. Jetty embeds so well that it is often completely hidden,
while other Web servers are primarily software containers and not
designed to be embedded within other applications. While they can be
embedded in applications, the applications more often than not take on
the shape of the Webserver rather than vice versa.
</p>

<h3>7. Jetty proves that size matters</h3>

<p>
Jetty’s small size makes it perfect for providing Web services to all
applications – even those on handheld devices. Because of its small
footprint, Jetty leaves more memory and cache free to be allocated to
running the application rather than running the server.
</p> 

<h3>8. Jetty is the first server for Google Android</h3>

<p>
Jetty will be the first server available for Google’s Android mobile
platform, in the form of i-Jetty. i-Jetty will allow users to turn their
phone into a server, and broadcast and share videos and photos on their
phones. Users will also have the ability to manage their phones from
their computer desktop. Essentially, i-Jetty and Android will give
mobile phone users much more control and flexibility over their devices.
</p>

<h3>9. Jetty is open source</h3>

<p>
That Jetty is open source is no secret – it is, in fact, its calling
card and the people behind it believe passionately that open source
methods are the best way to produce quality software that is well
targeted to users' needs. There is no better way for various people to
collaborate, both in development, and in discussion of requirements. It
was the right decision, as the number of Jetty users and developers
today shows.
</p>

<h3>10. Jetty is an important component in Eclipse</h3>

<p>
Jetty handles the help system in the open source Eclipse software
platform. Eclipse projects are hosted by the Eclipse Foundation, a
non-profit organization whose members include IBM, Oracle, Intel, and
Nokia.
</p>

<h3>11. Jetty is a record breaker</h3>

<p>
Earlier this year, Yahoo broke the record for the fastest sort of a
terabyte of random data. The record was achieved by one of Yahoo’s
Apache Hadoop clusters, in which Jetty was a crucial component. The new
record stands at 209 seconds, compared to the previous record of 297
seconds.
</p>

<h3>12. Jetty is supported by Webtide</h3>

<p>
The Jetty community is based at <a
href="http://www.mortbay.org">http://www.mortbay.org</a>. However, the
founders of Mort Bay realized that a successful open source project needs
commercial input and support, as a member of the community, to work with
"the" community. So <a href="http://webtide.com">webtide.com</a> was
founded to provide commercial support and development provider for Jetty.
</p>

<p>
Jetty has evolved a great deal over the years, from a poorly named bug
tracker to the flexible software it is today. It keeps growing,
breaking records and benchmarks and moving into interesting new areas
such as Web 2.0, gaming and mobile apps. It is poised to keep growing,
because the community continues to thrive, with up to 20 people
developing it at any given moment.  The future is not just secure for
Jetty, it’s positively buoyant.
