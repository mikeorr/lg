# forwarding connections to gateway port 8143 to any mailhost outside
# you will have to change the mailer-setup (convenience problem)
# but then why not use the ssh tunnel from the hotel too?

# If you want to send mail to a different mailrelay
# dont worry trying this one, relaying is diabled :-)

# forwarding another ssh (direct one from lap to one_specific_place)
# you connect from lap with ssh -p 8022 gateway
# and you actually reach target port 22
LocalForward 8022 targetmachine.example.org:22


# this allows other computers to access the tunneled ports.
# this is important as you would have to run ssh from the gateway to
# someplace outside. Then you connect from the laptop to gateway:8143
# for the imapserver mentioned above
# with "GatewayPorts no" the lap would be refused
# EVERY other LAN computer can do the same as you then (mail
# authentification of course has still to take place)
