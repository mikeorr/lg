Readers of the TAG mailing list may recall a 419 (advance-money fraud)
spam that hit the mailing list from a "vds2000.com" IP address.  Rather
than immediately consign the offender to the nether realms, I sent a
copy with full headers to the relevant abuse@ address, saying "419 fraud
from your IP".
</p>

<p>
That resulted in my being informed of a "trouble ticket"... and... let's
just jump to the end of the story, two days further on -- my closing
entry at
<a href="https://help.thehostgroup.com/index.php?_m=tickets&amp;_a=postreply&amp;ticketid=28748">https://help.thehostgroup.com/index.php?_m=tickets&amp;_a=postreply&amp;ticketid=28748</a> :
</p>

<pre>
  Just so we're really clear about this, and review:  I'm a system
  administrator who brought to your attention in ticket #28621 an episode
  of 419 fraud mail from your IP, 64.6.241.11, possibly through exploit of
  a buggy PHP page.  Ticket #28621 was immediately closed without any
  indication of resolution, and then (briefly) reopened when I asked what
  the resolution was. 
 
  One day later, I find that my ticketing system login no longer has
  access to that ticket.  I ask what's going on, resulting in this ticket
  (#28748) -- which ticket I find has now <em>also</em> been closed without
  comment.  
 
  So, I will now be setting all systems I administer to 550-reject mail
  from your company's IPs.  Have a nice eternity.

  Rick,
 
  The IP address you quote is not in our network:

<p>
Yes, you <em>can</em> use the "whois" command to determine who owns an IP
netblock.  In this case, as the gentleman points out, the IP in question 
is part of range 64.6.224.0 through 64.6.255.255, which was assigned by
the American Registry for Internet Numbers (the IP authority for North
America) to "Jumpline, Inc." of Ohio.
</p>

<p>
In drafting my original query, I had consulted the reverse DNS for IP
64.6.241.11, like this:  
</p>

<pre>
  $ dig -x 64.6.241.11 +short
  s11.n241.vds2000.com.
</pre>

<p>
I had then sent off my advisory about a 419 abuse to
"abuse@vds2000.com", which in turn automatically created a trouble
ticket at help.thehostgroup.com.  (Notice, too, the domain cited in the 
"OrgTechEmail" line, above.)
</p>

<p>
My logic was like this:  Only the organisation that controls an IP's
netblock can determine its reverse-DNS hostname, which in this case was
within the "vds2000.com" domain.  So, I wrote to the designated "abuse"
contact for vds2000.com, which domain turns out to be owned by
Jumpline.com, Inc.
</p>

<p>
My correspondent claims that his firm, The Host Group of McLean, VA is
somehow not connected with mail coming from that netblock, because the
netblock belongs to Jumpline.com, Inc., of Grove City, Ohio.
</p>

<p>
Which of us is incorrect?  I'm on far too little sleep at the moment,
but "We're not connected with domains pointed to by reverse DNS zones
within our sole control" (paraphrased) smells a little fishy, to me.

<p>
And I should hasten to add that I did <em>not</em> set up automatic rejection
of mail from "thehostgroup.com", in any event, just from the offending
IP netblock.

<p>
The SMTP banner claims that 64.6.241.11 is cp11.myhostcenter.com. It
would be interesting to see if a mail to abuse@myhostcenter.com goes to
the same trouble ticketing system. Since their addresses from
www.myhostcenter.com and the whois query match, I'd say yes. I think the
server might be a hosted machine, the customer has no clue about it and
all other references point to myhostcenter.com instead of the customer
running this server.

Best,
Ren&eacute;.
