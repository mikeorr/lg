<A NAME="intro"></A>
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P> Welcome to the Linux Laundrette. Make sure you remember to separate your
whites and colours, and to take care to wash cottons at low temperatures.

<P> Regular readers might recognise this as the "Not the Answer Gang" section
that Mike occasionally published in the "Back Page" - in fact, most of this is 
material that Mike had collected. Well, since Ben has taken over as editor, 
we've decided to split this and <a href="lg_spam.html">The Wonderful World of 
Spam</a> into their own articles, so that Ben can have free reign over his own 
Back Page. There's also a <a href="misc/laundrette/notlinux.html">Not Linux</a> 
section; I've added this as a supplement, as this material will be part of
the Linux Laundrette in future issues, but there's too much to include in this
month's edition.

<P> "Making Linux More Fun" is more than just a motto; it's our guiding 
principle. If The Answer Gang can't make Linux fun for themselves, they won't
have much success making it more fun for others. That's why off-topic posts
aren't shot down in flames, as in other lists. The reason we collect comments
here? Well, see for yourself: they're just damn funny.

<P> So, when we say "send us your tips", feel free to count that as meaning
"send us anything that made you laugh". We prefer Linux related items, but
have a look through some of the older Back Pages to get any idea of whether or
not something unrelated will get a chuckle. Mike's <a 
href="../102/lg_backpage.html">last Back Page</a> is a great example, and gives 
pointers to several of the older Back Pages.

<P> Those who read about the <A href="../103/oregan2.html">Alexis de Tocqueville 
Institute</a> in last month's issue might be interested in reading <a 
href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040607153801202">this</a>, and
may be interested in reading about the <a 
href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/columnItem/0,294698,sid39_gci969455,00.html">real</a>
<a href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci970955,00.html">history</a> of
<a href="http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid39_gci990148,00.html">Linux</a>.


<P> Not Linux related, but with great nerd appeal, is the <a 
href="http://www.xenocorp.net/H_bardCorner/MPFotR.htm">Monty Python Fellowship
of the Ring</a> and <a href="http://www.xenocorp.net/H_bardCorner/MPTTT.htm">The
Two Towers</a>, and anyone who wants to show a new user how to find information
might find <a href="http://fuckinggoogleit.com/">this page</a> useful, or if
you're feeling nice, you could tell them to <a 
href="misc/laundrette/rtfm.7.pdf">RTFM</a> (which you can also view as a <a 
href="misc/laundrette/rtfm.7.txt">man page</a> - type <tt>man man</tt> at the
command-line if you don't know what a man page is).

LG.net gives out free t-shirts. You simply go to one of the many custom

<H3>Rhubarb</H3>

<STRONG>
i don't have/use linux at present. i've always been (well for the last 5 years
anyway) interested in linux and i'd rather use it instead of this microsoft
stuff. i am a chef, so i can deal with the rhubarb if you need advice in
return...  what is a good system to use when one has little computer knowledge
but is interested in linux rather than that other stuff.  i have  machine that
works a treat, called a Toshiba Tecra. if this helps your answers at all.  it's
the crumble that really lifts the more humble rhubarb recipe.  many thanks.

Ben, bubeleh, you don't know what you've been missing!  Come out to the
Bay Area post haste, and I'll treat you to some of my rhubarb pie.
(Well, wait for summer, for rhubarb to be in season.)

I don't suppose you could put the recipie for it on your site, could you?
I am a huge fan of rhubarb.  Mmmm, rubarb crumble.

<P>
<STRONG>[Rick]</STRONG> 
Enjoy them, Thomas. (What do you put on yours?)

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
Well, the tradition is for sugar (white or brown) with lemon. However, I
managed to serve up something of a pancake "dinner", which had savoury
pancakes (sausage, cheese, peppers), followed by the sweet variety (to
which we not only had the sugar/lemon combination, but I also like various
jams).

He was questioned by somebody who wanted to trip him up on his dropped R's.

"syn/syn-ack/ack" is the TCP handshake - what happens at the TCP level

Presumably your rewrite has better ideas, more clarity, or more 
anecdotes, or you wouldn't have written it.  And any articles that come
from you have exemplary spelling/grammar anyway, so (A) they're safe to
publish as-is, and (B) they don't make much work for Rick anyway
(depending on his proofreading strategy).

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Why, thank you, Mike! Much appreciated. You'll have to call me a Dirty
Commie just to balance that out.

Oh, yeah, I forgot.  I've been thinking about work too much.  You're a

Hey, it does happen.  Not full-fledged stoned, but if you run into an

    <P>
    <STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
    "suffer"? Now you've got me curious, Mike. What happens to you when you
    get "caught" that way? Whatever it is, it sounds rather unusual; I'd
    never heard of anyone likening the effect of pot to suffering.

        <P>
        <STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
        It makes me want to sleep but I can't because these f***ing images in
        my head keep me awake.  They're different than LSD images but I can't
        explain it in words.  When it happens, all I can do is (im)patiently
        wait for it to wear off.  It's worst when it happens in the evening and
        there's something important the next morning so you can't afford to
        lose the sleep.

        <P> I assumed that's what happens to everybody and they for some
        inexplicable reason liked it, but then I talked with my roommate who
        was a pothead and he said that never happened to him.  He said it
        prob'ly doesn't agree with my metabolism and that there are three
        common reactions to pot, something like calmness, paranoia, and I
        forget the third.  I guess I have the second or third.

        <P>
        <STRONG>[Heather]</STRONG> 
        Ugh. Sounds dreadful.  I must have the 4th reaction then, because other
        than smell like pot (a small I find vaguely unpleasant, like bad ciger
        smoke only... grassier?) I get no reaction.  Sat one time in a haze
        filled room and only wanted one slice of pizza.  The cat was stoned.  I
        wasn't.

Which is different from "Oye" as in Hindi. As in "Oye, raaste se hat
ja". (Hey! Get off the road). In other words, much ruder/chummier.

<P>
Or "Aiyaiyo" as in Tamil. As in "Aiyaiyo, sapaada illey". (Alas! There
is no food). In other words an expression of despair.

Uh, what's a bogomips and what's it's relationship to a regular mips?
 
<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Well, T.R. - a "bogomip" is actually a term of Deep Hackery, known to
all True Geeks but never discussed outside the circle of The Cabal
(There Is No Cabal.) Only the first part of it is publically known and
somewhat understood - anything described by the term is highly bogus.

<P>
<STRONG>[T.R.]</STRONG> 
Also, a friend told me that running Linux is illegal. Is that true?

That's actually a *very* good example of a bogomip!

<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Well. That was... interesting, in the Chinese sense.

<P>
When last I spoke to Heather, she asked me how long the final processing
would take now that I had the Mailbag, etc.; I foolishly replied: "Oh,
no more than a couple of hours at most!"

<P>
Murphy heard me.

<P>
Almost immediately thereafter, St. Augustine got slammed by an
unexpected front carrying winds of up to (estimated) 70mph. Almost every
boat in the anchorage dragged; one went under the Bridge of Lyons,
breaking its mast. My boat held, despite one of the anchors letting go
(it turned out to have a 60 lb. or so fish trap tangled up in it; the
bottom here has more crap on it than any place I've ever been.)

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
Wow, Ben. You make a natural disaster sound like most people's holiday 
postcards.

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
I spent an uneasy hour or more cutting tangled lines (my boat is more
important than a damn piece of rope) and getting my anchors weighed and
reset - the main hook held fine, and I've just put out two more for the
night.

Hey, that's a 50% reduction in typing - nothing to sneeze at. If you
consider the amount of wear you've saved, you could probably buy
yourself a new keyboard every 50, 60 years out of the differential...

And note that if you do the greps in the oposite order, you move fewer

Yeah, well... my "grep" wasn't doing much but sitting around anyway. I
figured I'd make it earn its salary. Although that _is_ another 50%
saving on electrons... how much is a fusion power plant going for these
