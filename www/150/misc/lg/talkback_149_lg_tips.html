&gt; Hi there
&gt;
&gt; I am new to Linux, but with a big desire to become better. I have recently
&gt; read your article "2-cent tips: convert the collection of your mp3 files
&gt; into ogg"
&gt; in Linux Gazzete. I have found it very interesting, and I wanted to try it
&gt; out for myself. Everything went fine, except the script for replacing the "
&gt; " (blanks) with "_".
&gt;  After a little digging, and study of sed command, I have found out that the
&gt; problem came from this line of code:
&gt;
&gt; do mv -v "$a" $(echo $a | sed s/\/\_/g);
&gt;
&gt; So I have replaced it with:
&gt;
&gt;  do mv -v "$a" $(echo $a | sed s/" "/\_/g);
</pre>

<p>

There's a problem with this version as well - pretty much the same one
as Mulyadi's original script had, but it's disguised a little better.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that the substitution operation (s///) is part of "sed"
syntax, but - since it's not protected by quotes - gets to be
interpreted by the shell. Mulyadi's original version (which he'd
obviously mistyped) was
</p>

<pre>
sed s/\ /\_/g
</pre>

<p>
Take a careful look at it. Why is there an escape ('\') in front of the
space? Because without it, the <strong>shell</strong> (not sed) will split it up into
two tokens and present 'sed' with the following (extra spaces added for
clarity):
</p>

<pre>
sed     s/    /_/g
</pre>

<p>
That is, 'sed' as a Unix command, 's/' as the operation. and '/_/g' as
the filename to be processed. Obviously wrong. Escaping the space -
whether with a backslash or with a pair of quotes - makes it a literal
character, so the shell leaves it alone. Doing it this way, however,
leaves you having to escape every single questionable character in the
'sed' commandline.
</p>

<p>
The simple solution is - *don't do that*. Instead, always protect any
operations that you need to send to a program with a pair of single
quotes:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
sed 's/ /_/g' filename
grep '^foobar$' filename
nawk '{print $NF}' filename
perl -walne'print $F[3]' filename
</pre>

<p>
This will avoid the need for all that escaping.
</p>

As always, I greatly respect Ben's clear answer.... somebody who
volunteers some of his free time to support others for free deserve
two thumbs up IMHO.
