I cant believe that its not possible to re-use or dispose of a bad
sector on a hard drive!!!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please tell me its possible to do something!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I only have one bad sector - but its really pissing me off!
Isn't there something I can do?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Awaiting your response,

Hmm.  You can "dispose" of a bad sector by adding it to
the bad blocks list.  The easiest way to do this is to
allow the <tt>mke2fs</tt> and <tt>e2fsck</tt> tools "check" the portions
of the disk that underlie a given filesystem by using the
<tt>-c</tt> options to each of them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, when you first create an ext2 filesystem you should
always add the <tt>-c</tt> option so that it will (transparently)
call the '<tt>badblocks</tt>' command and account for those that are
detected.  (The installation front ends to most Linux and
GNU suite distributions, such as 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>, etc.
have a checkbox on their menu/dialogs to enable this).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When you suspect that additional sectors have gone bad
you should run '<tt>e2fsck -c</tt>' to add any newly bad sectors
to the bad blocks list that is maintained as part of the
the filesystem's metadata.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are similar features for other filesystem types ---
although in some cases you'll have to build the badblocks
table to a file and run the filesytem formatting utility
separately (I won't go into details about feeding a
badblocks list to each of the alternative Linux filesystem
types as I don't know them off hand and they'd only be of
interest to a tiny percentage of LG reader --- much less
than 1% by my guess).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the sector that goes bad is sector number one on track
zero --- then you have a paperweight.  That one sector is a
single point of failure (SPOF) in the whole PC drive
management architecture.  This is a limitation of the
architecture that lies below the OS level as it is imposed
by the BIOS.  Certainly someone could write a BIOS to
overcome the problem.  It's also possible that your hard
drive has quite a bit of built in redundancy to prevent the
problem from ever being visible to the BIOS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Modern hard drives are sophisticated pieces of electronics.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
They have embedded microprocessors running programs that map
their own arrangements of data blocks into an abstraction
that's compatible with the BIOS representation of a hard
disk.  A BIOS "thinks" of a hard disk as a flat three
dimensional array of head and tracks (cylinders) and
sectors.  In reality modern drives are almost always more
complex and far less regular.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most modern drives store more sectors on their outer tracks
than they do on the inner ones.  This is referred to as ZBR
(zone-bit recording).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most drives have "extra" sectors on each track --- and
they'll automatically map the "extras" in for any sector
that they detect as bad or "weak."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All hard drives have always implemented some error detection
into their electronics.  All recent drives (the last decade
or so) have also implemented at least rudimentary ECC, error
correction coding.  When a drive's electronics detect errors
they automatically try several re-reads to "get it right."
Many drives are programmed to move the successfully read
data into one of the "extras" on that track when this
occurs.  Likewise if they detect "correctable" errors
through their ECC mechanisms.  Some drives might even
migrate data to extra sectors on adjacent tracks or heads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, you generally won't see bad sectors on a modern drive
until there are enough of them that all of the available
extras on a given track, cylinder, or within a given zone,
are all in use.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most drives have a "hidden" extra cylinder on which they
store some of the persistent data for these low level
mapping and remapping operations.  This is the "diagnostics
cylinder."  I think that they also have at least one sector
per track or cylinder devoted to maintaining the bad block
remappings for that track.  (Some drives might implement
this as an additional surface --- so that one drive head
is devoted to all diagnostics).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most modern hard drives also have quite a bit of RAM on
them.  A half meg is minimal, and two to four meg is common
on larger, high performance SCSI drives.  I don't keep up on
these things so they may have drives with 8 or 16 Mb
onboard.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've often wondered if it wouldn't make more sense for drive
manufacturers to support a small (socketed?) bit of NVRAM to
store the MBR and the location of their diagnostics data
map.  Of course it's possible that some of them ARE doing
this --- since I wouldn't know.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course I'm just speculating here.  I've never designed
hard drives and my discussions with hardware engineers from
Seagate, Quantum and other aquaintances in the field have
been far less detailed than my preceding speculations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The key point here is that these drives are not just simple
arrays of heads, sectors and tracks.  I think I read a
message from Linus recently (on the kernel-list, in
reference to discussions about implementing "elevator-seeking"
and similar tricks in the low level disk drivers) that
basically said: 'anyone who treats a modern hard drive as
anything other than a linear list of storage blocks is a
fool.'
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for "re-using" a bad sector: you shouldn't have to worry
about that.  If you drive hasn't already done it automatically
and transparently then your best strategy is to mark it as
bad and let the OS work AROUND that spot.  Occasional
surface defects and wear and tear are to be expected in any
mechanical equipment --- and hard drives are fundamentally
mechanical.
