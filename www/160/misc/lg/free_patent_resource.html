Hi,
</p>

<p>
I saw that you had some trademark info at <a href='http://www.lg.ps.pl/issue97/TWDT.html'>http://www.lg.ps.pl/issue97/TWDT.html</a>.  I don't know if you also have any interest in patents, but if so I wanted to suggest that you check out <a href='http://www.freepatentsonline.com'>http://www.freepatentsonline.com</a> and <a href='http://www.sumobrain.com'>http://www.sumobrain.com</a>
</p>

<p>
They are by far the best free patent searches on the web, and trademark data will shortly be added to them as well.
</p>

<p>
If you have a spot, a link would be great.
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,
James
</p>

Thanks for writing to _Linux Gazette_, James.  Patents haven't really
been coming up in our articles, that I can recall.
</p>

<p>
When you say "They", I do believe you actually were slightly misspelling
"I", seeing that you're the President of Patents Online, LLC.  ;-&gt;
(It's considered good form to mention such things, when you are promoting
your own ventures.)
</p>

<pre>-- 
Cheers,              Crypto lets someone say "Hi! I absolutely definitely have 
Rick Moen            a name somewhat like the name of a large familiar 
rick@linuxmafia.com  organization, and I'd like to steal your data!" and lots 
McQ!  (4x80)         of users will say "OK, fine, whatever."    -- John Levine
