<h1>Joey's Notes: Access Control Lists</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/prestia.html">Joey Prestia</a></b></p>

<p>
Linux has the ability to use <em>access control lists</em> at the file
level. This allows file owners and system administrators to define who has
access and what level of access they have beyond the level of fliesystem
permissions.
</p>

<p>
Assume that a company has a team of employees working on a project. Each
employee, depending on their role and level of responsibility, needs
a different set of permissions; this can be implemented via access 
control lists (another, and perhaps better term is <em>discretionary access control 
lists</em>.) In the event that the material is classified to some but not
to all, these ACLs make things easy for the company in that security can be
handled without the need to involve more people other than those directly
concerned.
</p>

<p>
ACLs are available with the ext3 file system. By default, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 sets the capability for ACLs on all the ext3
partitions at install time. What this means is that if you create a 
new partition that was not in existence at install time and try to use access 
control lists on it, you can't: you will have to add the mount option ACL in the 
/etc/fstab file to make that feature available.
</p>

<p>
Most relevant commands support ACL lists, but some don't; if you're in
doubt, you should check the man pages to make sure. "tar", for example,
does not support access control lists. 
</p>

<h3>Setting up a partition for ACLs</h3>

<p>
Let's walk through setting up and using ACLs to get the feel of the fine
grained-level of control that is available by using access control lists. 
Since I have unpartitioned space on this drive, I will run through the
process of setting up ACLs on the new partition: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# fdisk /dev/hda
[root@localhost ~]# partprobe
[root@localhost ~]# mkfs.ext3 -L /srv/data /dev/hda10
</pre>

<p>
Next, I need to edit the /etc/fstab file and add the new partition and the
mount options for access control lists.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# vi /etc/fstab


LABEL=/            /                       ext3    defaults        1 1
LABEL=/boot    	   /boot                   ext2    defaults        1 2
devpts             /dev/pts                devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0
tmpfs              /dev/shm                tmpfs   defaults        0 0
LABEL=/home        /home              	   ext3  usrquota,grpquota 1 2
proc               /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
sysfs              /sys                    sysfs   defaults        0 0
LABEL=/tmp         /tmp                    ext3    defaults        1 2
LABEL=/usr         /usr                    ext3    defaults        1 2
LABEL=/var         /var                    ext3    defaults        1 2
LABEL=SWAP-hda3    swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
<strong>LABEL=/srv/data    /srv/data               ext3    defaults,acl    1 1</strong>
</pre>

<p>
After that, I'll make a directory and mount our new partition. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# mkdir /srv/data
[root@localhost ~]# mount -a
</pre>

<p>
Now, I'll add a group called "programming", and create several users
belonging to that group: "teamleader", "prog1", "prog2", and "tech".
I'll also need to change the ownership and permissions on this directory
to those appropriate for our new group. As a result, files created in this
directory will belong to group "programming".
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# groupadd programming
[root@localhost ~]# chown .programming /srv/data
[root@localhost ~]# chmod 2770 /srv/data
[root@localhost ~]# useradd teamleader -G programming 
[root@localhost ~]# passwd teamleader
[root@localhost ~]# useradd prog1 -G programming
[root@localhost ~]# passwd prog1
[root@localhost ~]# useradd prog2 -G programming
[root@localhost ~]# passwd prog2
[root@localhost ~]# useradd tech -G programming
[root@localhost ~]# passwd tech
[root@localhost ~]# cd /srv/data
[root@localhost data]# ls
lost+found
[root@localhost data]# su teamleader
[teamleader@localhost data]$ 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ touch project
[teamleader@localhost data]$ chmod 700 project 
</pre>

<p>
At this point the teamleader has created a project and restricted access to 
it via the filesystem.
</p>

<h3>Using getfacl</h3>

<p>
The command "getfacl" shows the ACL/permission information for a specified
file or directory:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
group::---
other::---
</pre>

<h3>Using setfacl</h3>

<p>
This command sets access controls. There are three fields on the command
line that you need to be aware of:</p>

<p>
<em><strong>identifier:user/group:permissions</strong></em></p>

<p>
The <em><strong>identifier</strong></em> can be expressed as:</p>

<pre>
 <strong>u</strong> - will affect the access rights of the specified user 	
 <strong>g</strong> - will affect the access rights of the specified group
 <strong>o</strong> - will affect the access rights of all others
 <strong>m</strong> - will affect the effective rights mask 
</pre>

<p>
<em><strong>user/group</strong></em> is the intended username or groupname,
which can also be expressed as a UID or GID.</p>
  
<p>
<em><strong>permissions</strong></em> are:</p>

<pre>
 <strong>r</strong> or <strong>4</strong> - read access
 <strong>w</strong> or <strong>2</strong> - write access
 <strong>x</strong> or <strong>1</strong> - execute permission 
 <strong>-</strong> or <strong>0</strong> - no permissions
</pre>			

<p>
Of course permissions may be combined such as <strong>r-x</strong> or 
<strong>5</strong> depending on what you want. Using the command in its 
simplest form looks like this:</p>

<p>
<strong>setfacl</strong> [options] <em>identifier</em>:<em>user/group</em>:<em> permissions</em> filename
</p>


<h3>Creating ACLs</h3>

<pre class="code">	
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -m u:prog1:rwx project 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -m u:prog2:rw- project 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
user:prog1:rwx
user:prog2:rw-
group::---
mask::rwx
other::---
</pre>

<p>
At this point we promoted our programmers permissions: "prog1" can now
read, write, and execute; and "prog2" has read and write access. Notice
also that the output from "getfacl" now has a "mask" field at the bottom:
the mask is a maximum rights level and can be used to immediately restrict
the permissions on this file. In addition, if you do an "ls -l", the
listing will show a "+" at the end of the permissions for each filename
that has ACLs enabled:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ ls -l
total 13
drwx------  2 root       programming 12288 Mar 19 21:59 lost+found
-rwxrw----+ 1 teamleader programming     0 Mar 22 20:30 project
[teamleader@localhost data]$ 
</pre>

<p>
The "programming" group needs at least <tt>read</tt> permissions on this file, since
other programmers will need to see what is in the document. If we do not
specify the group explicitly when we execute the "setfacl" command, it is
assumed as you can see below: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -m g::r project 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project 
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
user:prog1:rwx
user:prog2:rw-
group::r--
mask::rwx
other::---
</pre>

<h3>Restricting effective rights</h3> 

<p>
By changing the mask, I can change the current effective permissions to the
most restrictive level as defined by the mask and have those become the
effective permissions. Even if a user or group has permissions in excess of
what the effective mask is set to, the mask will restrict their effective
rights.
</p>

<!-- I think what he is trying to convey is that the mask supercedes
individual or group permissions, but I don't feel that's clear in the
preceding paragraph - Kat --!>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -m mask::r project 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project 
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
user:prog1:rwx                  #effective:r--
user:prog2:rw-                  #effective:r--
group::r--
mask::r--
other::---
</pre>

<h3>Removing a user from an ACL</h3>

<p>
If we want to remove one of our programmers - e.g., "prog1" - from the ACL 
for this project and revert his permissions back to what the group has, this 
would be done as follows: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -x u:prog1: project
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
user:prog2:rw-
group::r--
mask::rw-
other::---
</pre>

<p>
The "-x" switch removes the associated user, group, or other, from the
associated access control list - so "prog1" now only has group level access
(and probably a pay cut to go with it).
</p>

<h3>Transfer of ACL attributes from a specification file</h3>  

<p>
What if we were to store our ACL attributes in a file containing the line 
"u:prog1:rwx"? We could use the "-M" switch to pass the attributes on to a new 
file.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ touch file
[teamleader@localhost data]$ echo "u:prog1:rwx" &gt; acl 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -M acl file
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl file
# file: file
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rw-
user:prog1:rwx
group::rw-
mask::rwx
other::r--
</pre>

<p>
We have successfully transferred the ACL attributes in the file "acl" to the 
empty file "file". Did you notice how the effective rights mask jumped up 
from "rw-" to "rwx"? If you did not want the effective rights mask to change 
when you modify permissions you could use the "-n" option alongside your 
other options to prevent it.
</p>

<h3>Copying the ACLs from one file to another</h3>

<p>
To copy a file's ACL to another file you would execute "<code>getfacl
filewith.acl | setfacl -b -n -M - fileneeding.acl</code>" as I will show
below. The last "-" is important; it tells "setfacl" to read the data from
standard input, which is being supplied by the preceding pipe.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl filewith.acl 
# file: filewith.acl
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rw-
user:prog1:rwx
group::rw-
mask::rwx
other::r--

[teamleader@localhost data]$ touch fileneeding.acl
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl filewith.acl | setfacl -b -n -M - fileneeding.acl 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl fileneeding.acl
# file: fileneeding.acl
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rw-
user:prog1:rwx
group::rw-
mask::rwx
other::r--
</pre>


<h3>Inheriting a directory's ACL from the parent</h3> 

<p>
Directories can have a default ACL, which defines the access permissions
that files under the directory inherit when they are created. A default ACL
affects subdirectories as well as files. First, let's set up a directory
with a set of default permissions. Access defaults are created by using the
"-d" switch when modifying a directory.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ mkdir work
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -d -m g::r-x work/
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl work/
# file: work
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:group::r-x
default:other::r-x
</pre>

<p>
Observe as I create a child directory below, "work/week1". Notice that 
"week1" will inherit the default ACL permissions of the parent directory 
"work":
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ mkdir work/week1
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl work/week1/
# file: work/week1
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:group::r-x
default:other::r-x
</pre>

<h3>Inheriting a file's default ACLs from the parent</h3>

<p>
Last of all, let's see how these defaults propagate to a simple file
created in the "work/week1" directory. I'll show the parent's ACL first,
then create the file:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl work/week1/
# file: work/week1
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:group::r-x
default:other::r-x

[teamleader@localhost data]$ touch work/week1/day1
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl work/week1/day1 
# file: work/week1/day1
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rw-
group::r--
other::r--

[teamleader@localhost data]$ umask 
0002
</pre>

<p>
Note that the file was created with an active umask of 0002. This means
that the file should have had permissions of 664; instead it was created
with default permissions of 644 because of the default ACL on the
directory and the inheriting of the ACL from the parent directory.
</p>

<p>
This is not an exhaustive list of all the possibilities; however, just
these basics should be enough to get you started using access control lists. ACLs can be used 
to regulate permissions for special situations where regular Linux 
permissions will not quite handle the job; they can also lighten the
administrative overhead when project-level managers learn to use them 
correctly and effectively. In addition, ACLs can be a valuable tool in any 
administrator's toolbox to help regulate security.

<p>
Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.
