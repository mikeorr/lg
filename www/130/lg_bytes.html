<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">Virtual Headaches</h3> 

<p> It all started with the announcement that Microsoft Corp. and
XenSource would cooperate on interoperability between Xen-enabled Linux
and Microsoft's planned hypervisor technology for its Windows Server
virtualization. With the next version of Windows Server, code-named
"Longhorn," Microsoft will provide powerful virtualization across
hardware and operating system environments for cost-saving consolidation
of Windows, Linux, and Xen-enabled Linux distributions.
</p>

<p> The joint efforts between the two companies will deliver
interoperability, secure virtualization, and, most noteworthy, Microsoft
technical support for interoperability issues with Xen-enabled Linux
guest operating systems through standard Microsoft technical support
processes.
</p>

<p> Following Microsoft's surprise embrace of XenSource technology for
hosting virtual Linux hosts, VMware's 'Executive Blog' critiqued the
Microsoft line-up with open source virtualization developer XenSource in
mid-July. Written by Brian Byun, VMware Vice-President of Products and
Alliances, the 7/18 blog entry accuses XenSource of betraying its open
source roots and called the arrangement a 'one-way street' that would
ultimately only favor Microsoft.
</p>

<p> Byun complains that the Xen "...arrangement will allow Linux to run
on future Microsoft hypervisors through translated calls to the
hypervisor when Windows is controlling the hardware, but not the other
way around..."<br>
[See <a
href="http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/blog/console/2006/07/">http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/blog/console/2006/07/</a>.]

</p>

<p> Those and other comments have damaged the working efforts between
XenSource and VMware on producing open-source standards for
virtualization hypervisors. VMware has already circulated an initial
proposal for Linux kernel support of various hypervisors. 
</p>

<p> Byun wrote, "XenSource, in diverging from its open-source and Linux
virtualization roots, is enabling the commercial interests of Windows
and building to proprietary Windows API layers. It stands to reason
that, in order to protect Windows from GPL contamination, XenSource will
need to undertake a lot of non-GPL development to translate and buffer
the Linux kernel from Windows hypervisor interfaces; and nothing that
Microsoft licenses to, or develops with, XenSource is GPL and can be
used directly by the Xen or Linux communities and commercial
distributions". These comments have angered XenSource representatives.
</p>

<p> The blogshere has rattled and ranted about this situation, but Ilya
Baimetov's comments at <a
href="http://virtuozzo.livejournal.com/6606.html">http://virtuozzo.livejournal.com/6606.html</a>
are very astute. First, he notes that the technology in Xen was
developed at Cambridge University with support by Microsoft; not
surprisingly, Microsoft's virtualization technology has many
similarities with Xen. Then, he asks some rather important questions
about what, if anything, XenSource gets, other than exposure:
</p>

<p> "With this partnership, Xen loses its advantage as the only platform
for running paravirtualized Linux. Now, why would channel partners
invest in training their staff to sell and support Xen, if they can just
wait until Microsoft releases its hypervisor, which they will need to
adopt anyway? Is Xen[Source] just desperate? Is it trying to get acquired by
MS? No? Then, please, explain to me how Xen[Source] is going to make money if
its core technology is free and its management tools are way behind
VMware?"
</p>

<p> All this controversy heightens the need to have rival virtualization
approaches use some common standards before being included in Linux
distros. SuSE 10 is out now with customizations to support Xen,
and IBM, as a SuSE partner, will be supporting that Xen implementation.
Meanwhile, VMware announced the general availability of VMware Server
after a five-month beta program with more than 700,000 downloads. VMware
Server is now free and replaces its former low-end GSX Server
product.
</p>

<p> At LinuxWorld, working relationships did not seem strained, and
vendors and partners of both VMWare and XenSource made a point of being
cordial. When questioned at a virtualization panel with representatives
of VMware and Microsoft present, XenSource representatives expressed a
continued interest in working with both companies and developing
standards for hypervisors. However, in separate presentations by members of
VMWare, they emphasized running Linux as a fully equal OS vs. the Xen
and Microsoft approach where Linux was not equal to the Windows host.<br>
[So they are still sparring, only more politely.]
</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">Where was Red Hat? [a no-show at LinuxWorld]</h3>

<p> The halls of the SF Moscone Center were without a significant Red Hat
presence. No booth, no sponsorship, no Red Hat partner pavillion [and no
Red Hat-wrappered chocalate bars for tired conference attendees!] At
the same time, the Internet rumor mill contained a flush of reports about
Oracle pursuing a Linux distro, perhaps even Red Hat itself.
</p>

<p> Red Hat did hold an exclusive fete at a nearby hotel for special
customers, press, and partners, but this Linux Gazette reporter was not
invited. Red Hat personnel also presented at technical sessions and panels,
but this seemed like a retreat for a company so central to the world of
Linux.
</p>

<p> Red Hat executives considered their no-show a no-issue, but conference
attendees were surprised and unhappy. There were no scarlet baseball
caps this year at the Expo, no Red Hat training discounts, no booth
presentations.
</p>

<p> Some speculation -- unsubstantiated so far -- suggested that Red Hat
was preparing itself for purchase, and so allowed Oracle a more prominent
role. But even Oracle's presence at the show was a bit more subdued. The
annual Oracle installathon was not mentioned in the show guide or in the
morning keynote introductions. However, the installathon did occur in a
corner of conference center, with only a single sign in front of its
door. Oracle could offer attendees only older SUSE 9 and Red Hat 4
packages at the installathon, unlike the up-to-date offerings at
previous LinuxWorlds.
</p>

<p> Ellison has stated in a recent interview with Forbes magazine that
Oracle is considering use of Fedora Core OSS: "...any company can take
Red Hat Linux and use it at no cost, so long as they are willing to
support themselves... Well, that includes us. We could take Red Hat
Linux, as long as we're willing to support it. In fact, we can
redistribute it to others and provide support."
</p>

<p> Such a purchase would allow Oracle to offer a complete "stack" of OS,
DB, Oracle apps, and helper middleware. At LinuxWorld two years ago,
Ellison said Oracle would like offer such a stack to its customers.
Subsequently, Oracle purchased OSS database vendors Sleepy Cat Systems
and InnoBase.
</p>

<p> See the links below for more info on the Oracle-Red Hat buyout
speculation.  Thumbnail summary: Oracle can pay billions to roll their
own Linux and market it -- or Oracle can pay even more billions to acquire
Red Hat [$4-6 billion by one estimate]. Perhaps Ellison is trying to
beat down Red Hat's share price and market cap for such a purchase or
other 'strategic' ends. Red Herring magazine cautions that Oracle will
be quiet until it reports quarter earnings in October or at its next
analyst meeting on October 26.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">AJAX
Bringing Web 2.0 to Web Services - Survey Results</h3>

<p> According to Evans Data Corp's latest Web Services Development
Survey, Web Services with Web 2.0 interfaces are surging. Evans Data
finds this in the rising use of AJAX, a key component option of the Web
2.0 architecture. Close to half of developers surveyed say they are
already working with AJAX, or plan to do so in the coming year. REST
(Representational State Transfer) use is rising as well. The Evans Data
survey found a 37% increase in respondents implementing or considering
REST, with one out of four surveyed saying that they are considering
REST-Based Web services as a simpler alternative to SOAP-based
services.
</p>

<p> "Consistent with the increasing adoption of Web services, we are also
seeing the same for AJAX", stated John Andrews, President of Evans Data.
"This framework, now more than ever, is allowing developers the means to
make Web-based applications function more like desktop ones."
</p>

<p> Other findings from the Spring 2006 survey of almost 400 managers and
developers:
</p>

<p>
 -- Reuse is rising. Three out of ten survey respondents are saying
the ability to reuse a service is the greatest cost advantage to Web
Services. The number of respondents sharing Web services with two or
more business units is up 20% since the last survey.
<br>
 -- Despite industry speculation to the contrary, the adoption of the
Java platform is poised for a significant increase. Three out of four
companies expect to be working with the Java platform by next year, a
12% jump.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">IDC Predicts Open Source Software Will Grow Fastest in Government Sector</h3>

<p> According to recent analysis conducted by market research firm
Government Insights (an IDC company), open-source software will gain
momentum faster within the government sector than it will in other
markets. Government Insights predicts government information technology
will most likely see the most substantial growth in the use of 
open-source software over the next five years, with rapid growth in the
five- to ten-year time frame. This study also predicts a 'value shift'
for software within the government community, citing the initial shift
driven by state and local governments sharing their custom-developed
solutions.
</p>

<p> "Government software needs are unique because governments perform a
unique function - service to the citizen," says Shawn P. McCarthy, head
of vendor programs at Government Insights. "Unlike the private sector,
when governments help coordinate the open-source development process,
they greatly benefit from the code that is created, even if the code is
freely available to others. State governments in particular will benefit
from the approach of keeping software value within a community; an
application created for one state can easily be used by other
states."
</p>

<p> In this report, Government Insights estimates a 30% compound annual
growth rate (CAGR) of open-source software as part of total IT spending,
as well as forecasts the growth of open-source software within the
government IT market through 2009. The forecasts are divided into three
categories, including Application Development and Deployment,
Applications, and System Infrastructure Software.
</p>

<p> "This is the same kind of aggressive growth that we saw in the early
days of Linux", adds McCarthy. "There is reason to believe that this
growth will continue past 2010, making both traditional and government
coordinated open-source projects a force to be reckoned with in the next
decade.  Government agencies are now developing their own open code
repositories."
</p>

<p> The study, entitled "The Long Term Impact of Open Source Solutions on
Government IT Spending" (Doc # GI201795), is available at <a

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux
fastest-growing Operating System in the industry according to Gartner,
IDC</h3>

<p> In May, Gartner Group reported that Linux experienced an 84% market
share leap in the Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) market.

</p>

<p> According to a February 2006 report from IDC's Worldwide Quarterly
Server Tracker, Linux servers generated $1.6 billion in 2005 quarterly
revenue, the fourteenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, with
year-over-year revenue growth of 20.8%. For the full year, Linux server
revenues were $5.7 billion, placing it in third place for the first time
from an operating system perspective, as customers continued to expand
the role of Linux servers into an increasingly wider array of commercial
and technical workloads.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">AMD, Intel continue chip war, price cuts</h3>

<p> It's a little bit like Xmas in July, but AMD and Intel embarked on a
second round of price cuts -- of up to 60% -- to make room for new 
dual-core X86 chips and to push out older inventories. The high ground is
also being staked out, with both AMD and Intel talking up and coming
4-core systems.
</p>

<p> At the end of July, AMD showed off a prototype high-end gamer system
that it called a '4by4'. VP Pat Moorhead suggested it will price out in
the $1000 range, depending on final configuration. According to
<a href="http://reghardware.co.uk">reghardware.co.uk</a>: "It's essentially
a two-CPU motherboard, rigged for ATI's CrossFire and Nvidia's SLI dual-GPU
technology twice over to support four GPUs.  Each CPU slot will hold a
dual-core Athlon 64 FX processor, so that's four cores. Each chip gets 2GB
of dedicated memory, for a total of 4GB."
</p>

<p> Both chip makers had originally planned to release quad-core chips in
the first half of 2007, but Intel now hopes to begin offering some
quad-cores at the end of this year. 
</p>

<p> AMD's strategy continues to include partnering with other chip makers
to reduce the total system cost, and to allow board builders to choose
the parts they want. They modified that approach in July by offering to
buy graphics chip maker ATI, with the aim of moving graphics processors
into the the main CPU. 
</p>

<p> AMD will also be launching a new version of its Opteron server chip
in mid-August. Called "Rev F", the new Opteron has support for
faster DDR2 memory and AMD's in-chip virtualization technology
["Pacifica"]. It will also sport an updated on-board memory controller
and requires the new 940-pin AM2 socket. 
</p>

<p> The on-going problem for AMD is that the new Intel 'Core 2 Duo' [C2D]
architecture can match and even surpass AMD's offerings on performance
and power consumption, at least for the Athlon chip family. Intel's
Conroe family implements an architecture that steals a few pages from
AMD's and does it a turn better. Results from PC Labs investigation into
C2D chips show Intel chips with a 10-30% advantage, depending on the
benchmark used. These tests are primarily while running the Windows OS,
but even <a
href="http://common.ziffdavisinternet.com/util_get_image/14/0,1425,i=140507,00.gif]">
scientific benchmarks</a> modestly favor the Intel C2D processors in
most cases except RAM access, where AMD's on-board memory controller
shines. 
</p>

<p> For all benchmarks see <a
href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1989023,00.asp">PC Magazine
Special Report: Intel Core 2 Duo Conroe</a>.
</p>

<p> How does the C2D gain an edge on AMD? In both small and large
ways. First, Intel has pooled its L2 cache with the expectation that
both CPU cores will want some of the same objects. AMD has dedicated L2
cache for each of its cores but intends to add an extra L3 cache that
Athlon and Opteron cores can share. Second, Intel has widened the
execution unit to 128 bits, allowing extra-wide 128-bit instructions to
exec in a single clock cycle; where the Pentium D family required 2
clocks. Third, Intel has a 14-stage pipeline compared to AMD's 12
stages, but this is still shorter and easier to manage than the 31-stage
Pentium D. Fourth and most important, regular instructions can be
processed 4 at a time vs. 3 at a time for Pentium and AMD Athlon.
</p>

<p> It looks like the Empire is stiking back... but AMD says it has been
preparing for this moment, and has announcements of its own in the next
few months. One area it may pursue is improving the benchmarking of
power consumption for long-running processes, where AMD believes its
chips are still superior. AMD has been building up its chip fab
capacity and production yields to supply lots of low-cost chips for the
coming battle. It's Ragnarok, the battle of the Gods!

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">Apple adds
more Open Source to its Sauce</h3>

<p> Apple is becoming more interested in the power of open source
development to create value for its products and its developer
community. Following August's Apple Developer Conference, open source
developers on the Mac platform had four news items:
</p>

<h3>-- Intel Kernel Sources</h3>

<p> New buildable kernel sources are available for Intel-based Macs,
alongside the usual PowerPC (and other Intel) sources, starting with Mac
OS X 10.4.7. This is at: <a
href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/xnu-792.10.96.tar.gz">http://www.opensource.apple.com/darwinsource/tarballs/apsl/xnu-792.10.96.tar.gz</a>           
</p>

<h3>-- Mac OS Forge for Community Projects</h3>

<p> Mac OS Forge, a new community site hosted by Apple, has been created
to support WebKit and other open-source projects focused on Mac OS X,
especially those looking to transition from OpenDarwin.org. Please visit
<a href="http://www.macosforge.org/">http://www.macosforge.org/</a> for more info.
</p>

<h3>-- New Open Source Calendaring Server can replace Exchange</h3>

<p> In order to encourage community participation, source code to the new
iCal Server in the Leopard OS Server is now available on Mac OS Forge
under the Apache License. Speculation at Slashdot and other forums is
that Apple has opened the code for iCal Server to help establish
it as a FOSS alternative to Exchange Server. Windows users [and, in some
shops, Linux users] in Active Directory shops can set up Xservers and iCal
for calendaring and use existing AD user authentication without buying
new Microsoft CALs [Client Access Licenses] to use Exchange. See: <a
href="http://collaboration.macosforge.org/">http://collaboration.macosforge.org/</a>            
</p>

<h3>-- Apache-Licensed Bonjour and Launchd sources</h3>

<p> To further enable and encourage adoption on other, non-Mac platforms,
the Apple Public Source License [APSL] sources for Apple's Bonjour
networking and service discovery SW and Launchd process management are
being re-released under the Apache License and hosted on Mac OS Forge.
Launchd has already had a successful FreeBSD port.
</p>

<p> The launchd daemon is intended to replace init, rc, the init.d and rc.d
scripts, SystemStarter (Mac OS X specific), inetd and xinetd, atd, crond,
and watchdog, all in one centralized daemon. Visit these sites for more

OS</h3>

<p> Linspire, Inc. announced its Freespire 1.0, free Debian-based desktop
Linux operating system. Freespire optionally combines open source
software with legally-licensed proprietary drivers, codecs, and
applications in its core distribution. Freespire licenses available
3rd-party software where there are no viable open source
alternatives.
</p>

<p> Linspire announced the Freespire community project at the Desktop
Linux Summit last April, with a projected release date of September 1st.
Released ahead of schedule, Freespire 1.0 offers users the ability to
choose what software they want installed on their computers, with no
limitations. Freespire has included several 3rd-party proprietary
drivers and codecs, and is able to provide better out-of-the-box
hardware, file type and multimedia support, such as MP3, Windows Media,
RealMedia, QuickTime, Java, Flash, ATI, nVidia, fonts, WiFi, and modems.
[This includes pre-built NdisWrapper for most wireless chips.]
Freespire also provides optional one-click access to legally licensed
DVD playback software, games, Sun's StarOffice, Win4Lin, CodeWeaver's
Crossover Office, etc.
</p>

<p> "Users should be free to easily and legally choose what software they
want to install and use on their computers", said Kevin Carmony, CEO of
Linspire, Inc. "Freespire provides a free marketplace for any and all
Linux software, including proprietary, open source, free, and commercial
products."
</p>

<p> Immediately available for free download through the <a
href="http://Freespire.org">Freespire.org</a> Web site, Freespire is a
community-driven, Debian-based Linux distribution designed to be
powerful enough for sophisticated Linux users and developers, yet easy
enough for someone new to Linux. Freespire was created specifically for
use on desktop and notebook computers and designed to offer a new level
of polish, attention to detail, and ease-of-use in a free Linux
distribution. For software management, Freespire comes pre-installed
with Linspire's CNR (Click and Run) application management system, as
well as 'apt-get' or 'synaptic'.
</p>

<p> "The pragmatic world view of the Freespire project - that everything
should just work without endless tinkering - is truly refreshing," said
Ian Murdock, founder of the popular Debian Linux system. "Freespire will
open the door to many more potential Linux users who want to experience
the many benefits of open source without having to become an expert in
how it all works. CNR is truly a work of art."
</p>

<p> Also available is the Freespire 1.0 OSS Edition, a special version of
Freespire that does not include any proprietary software. This version
can be used by those who wish to build upon Freespire, without any of
the 3rd-party licensed components included in the core OS.
</p>

<p> At LinuxWorld, Linspire CEO Kevin Carmony was a featured panelist on
the OSDL Desktop Linux Workgroup panel. Linspire personnel also handed
out thousands of live CDs for Freespire and occasional full commercial
packages of Linspire to interested LinuxWorld attendees.

<a name="security"></a><h2>Security News</h2>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian.Org Server restored after Security Compromise</h3>

<p> One core Debian server at debian.org had to be reinstalled after a
compromise. On July 12th, the host gluck.debian.org was compromised
using a local root vulnerability in the Linux kernel. The intruder had
access to the server using a compromised developer account.
</p>

<p> Due to the short window between exploiting the kernel and Debian
admins noticing, the attacker hadn't had time/inclination to cause much
damage. The only obviously compromised binary was /bin/ping.
</p>

<p> The compromised account did not have access to any of the restricted
Debian hosts. Hence, neither the regular nor security archive were
compromised. An investigation of developer passwords revealed several
weak passwords, and those accounts have been locked in response.
</p>

<p> The kernel vulnerability used for this compromise is referenced as
CVE-2006-2451. It only exists in the Linux kernel 2.6.13 up to versions
before 2.6.17.4, and 2.6.16 before 2.6.16.24. The bug allows a local
user to gain root privileges via the PR_SET_DUMPABLE argument of the
prctl function, and a program that causes a core dump file to be created
in a directory for which the user does not have permissions.
</p>

<p> The current stable release, Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 alias 'sarge',
contains Linux 2.6.8 and is thus not affected by this problem. The
compromised server ran Linux 2.6.16.18. [Plan on an upgrade if you are
running a vulnerable version...]

diagram-specific toolbars, more context menus, extended properties,
window direct-entry fields, expanded example files, tutorials, and help
features, and the following three additional diagram types:
</p>

<p> -- Activity diagrams - Chart the flow of actions and illustrate
trigger mechanisms and decision points as well as sequential, parallel,
and alternate flows based on internal or external conditions<br>

-- State machine diagrams - Identify various states and transitional
conditions of an object as it proceeds through its life cycle<br>

-- Composite structure diagrams - Document the design or runtime
architecture of a system or an architectural pattern, or represent a
class graphically as opposed to simply listing its properties as in a
class diagram
</p>

<p> In addition, numerous usability refinements throughout UModel 2006
R2 enhance auto-creation of association connectors, reverse-engineering
functionality, copy/paste operations, and lots more. Detailed

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" alt=bolt src="../gx/bolt.gif">Neural Sensing Technology Highlighted in Nature</h3> 

<p> The Cyborgs are coming... Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems,
Inc. announced preclinical results reported by a team of researchers
from Stanford University's Schools of Engineering and Medicine in the
July 13, 2006, issue of the journal <em>Nature</em>. Scientific findings from
the first participant in the company's ongoing pilot clinical trials of
the BrainGate Neural Interface System (BrainGate) were featured on the
cover of the same issue. The Stanford team used Cyberkinetics's research
products line of neural interface technology to demonstrate the ability
to obtain accurate, high-speed neural recordings that can immediately be
translated into a prediction of intended movement. This research
underscores the feasibility for using neural signals as the basis for
brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that could be developed to enable those
with nervous system injuries or diseases to operate external devices
that require fast, accurate selections, such as typing.
</p>   

<p> In the study, published in "Letters" to <em>Nature</em>, the authors
describe a significant advance in discrete, high-speed, high-accuracy
neural decoding in a preclinical model using Cyberkinetics's
electrode and data acquisition technology. These findings include the
ability to voluntarily generate signals in the dorsal pre-motor cortex,
the area of the brain responsible for the planning, selection and
execution of movement. While accuracy levels have been previously
published, the current study reveals unprecedented speed in retrieving
and interpreting the neural signals that can be applied to the operation
of external devices that require fast, accurate selections, such as
typing. The researchers also found that, by locating the Cyberkinetics
neural sensor in this area, they were able to immediately translate
neural activity into a prediction of the intended movement in order to
place a computer cursor directly on an intended target.
</p>   

<p> According to John Donoghue, Chief Scientific Officer of
Cyberkinetics, and a co-inventor of the BrainGate technology, "The
results achieved from this study demonstrate the utility and versatility
of Cyberkinetics's neural sensing technology to achieve very rapid,
accurate decoding - about as fast as humans ordinarily make decisions to
move when asked. The contributions of complementary research with our
electrode and data acquisition technology should enhance our development
of the BrainGate System in its ability to, one day, enable those with
severe paralysis or other neurological conditions to lead more
independent lives."
