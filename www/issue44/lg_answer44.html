	>Greetings from Jim Dennis</H3>
<!-- begin greeting -->

<p>
 Well, the book is done at last.  It's off to the publishers and
 beyond our control.  Naturally M and I are are already thinking
 about things to improve for the second edition.  
</p>

<p>
 Meanwhile in "Answer Guy" land I was a bit surprised by the
 reaction to my comment on Bernie's "parenting" from last month.  I
 expected a few flames, and maybe one or two notes of agreement.
 Naturally I hesitated to even respond to the question at all.  
</p>

<p>
 I figured someone would toss the old "what do you know about being
 a parent?" bomb at me.  Of course, I don't know anything about
 "being a parent;" not first hand, so far.   However, that's not the 
 reaction I got.  I had several people drop me notes and come to me
 in person to say how much they agreed with me.  At least one was a
 grandparent. 
</p>

<p>
 However, I did neglect to add one thing to my flame.  Normally when 
 I "flame" someone (in my column or in e-mail/netnews) I also answer 
 their question.  In this case the answer to Bernie's question came
 within a couple of weeks after I wrote my response to him.  
</p>

<blockquote><dl>
 	<dt>Back Orifice 2000.   
	<dd><a href="http://www.bo2k.com/"
		>http://www.bo2k.com/</a>
</dl></blockquote>

<p>
 This package, a freeware (and open source) product of the cDc (Cult 
 of the Dead Cow) offers just the features that Bernie was looking
 for.  Using it you can perform keystroke logging, take screen shots
 of your victim's work (or play), redirect their TCP/IP traffic so
 that it all goes through your system,  play with their filesystem 
 (almost undetectably) and (of course) surreptisiously install any
 other software you like.
</p>

<p>
 The BO2K server runs on NT, Win '95 and Win '98 (and on the most
 recent betas of Win 2000, from what I hear).  There are clients for
 Win32 (of course), and command line clients for Linux and other
 forms of UNIX.  Since BO2K is open source it can probably be ported
 to as many other UNIX-like operating systems as you like.
</p>

<p>
 It might be interesting to see what happens when some programmers
 start combining features of BO2K with VNC (Virtual Network
 Computing) a package which provides GUI remote access to Win32
 and MacOS platforms.  VNC clients are available for Linux, Win32,
 and Java (among others).  
</p>

<p>
 Both VNC and BO2K are released under the GPL, so they should be
 license compatible.  We don't run into the sort of problem one
 would face when trying to mix BSD and GPL code (for example).  
</p>

<p>
 Of course BO2K was released <em>after</em> my message to Bernie. However
 it is an upgrade (a complete re-write, from what I've read) to the
 original BO.  BO was released last August.  The fact is that I
 didn't know much about BO.  I'd heard about it, of course.
 However, I don't administer any Windows systems and I have no
 interest in using trojan horses.  So I simply filed it away as
 evidence of vulnerabilities in "that legacy operating system from
 Redmond."
</p>

<p>
 UNIX and Linux are riddled with vulnerabilities.  We find new
 buffer overflows and race conditions every week.  Most are simple
 programming errors that are fixed as quickly as they are found.
 Occasionally we find exploitable flaws in the kernel (like the LDT, 
 local descriptor table, bug that Linus found a couple of years
 ago).  Those are also fixed quickly.  
</p>

<p>
 This suggests that the design of UNIX is relatively sound with
 respect to security, since the bugs are at an implementation level.
 They are easily fixed.
</p>

<p>
 It also suggests that the design is limited.  It is very difficult
 to write "secure" code for Linux and UNIX.  In particular it seems
 that the standard C libraries are a poor base for writing robust
 applications code.  The most straightforward ways to accomplish 
 many operations in C through the standard libraries (<tt>scanf()</tt>, 
 <tt>printf()</tt>, <tt>system()</tt>, <tt>popen()</tt>) are simply 
 inappropriate for working with untrusted data or being run in any 
 security context other than that of the user who is executing it.  
 In other words, SUID and SGID programs, and daemons should eschew 
 many of the standard library functions.   The programming expertise 
 required to distinguish between the "safe" practices and those that are 
 exploitable provides us with a severe limitation to the security of 
 our systems.
</p>

<p>
 I asked a programmer and design engineer (the major force behind
 the design of the Corel Netwinder) about the sorts of bugs that are 
 exploited by BO2K to gain full control of NT and W2K systems.
 Basically I asked if the released version of W2K could fix these 
 holes to prevent BO2K from being used as a trojan.  He said that
 the nature of these bugs is far too pervasive to be fixed by
 Microsoft in the remaining time before their final release.  The
 APIs used by BO2K are apparently also used by many other products
 and parts of the OS.
</p>

<p>
 I'm not a programmer.  However, that does sound like a design level
 problem.  It suggests that no amount of implementation effort will
 "fix" the problem.  This is consistent with other things I've heard
 and read about NT since before version 3.0 (the first release).  
</p>

<p>
 So, I'm glad I invested the time to learn UNIX and Linux rather
 then spending the time in the rat's wheel to learn the guts of NT.
 The important things that I learn about Linux are applicable to
 other forms of UNIX, and will be around for as long as these
 operating systems exist.  The few things I learn about NT and 
 other MS operating systems are going to be obsolete within one
 or two future releases of the system.
</p>

<p>
 The whole issue of BO2K as a "trojan horse" is interesting.
 Naturally Microsoft would like everyone to focus on the "hacker"
 (cracker, actually) image of the cDc.  They characterize BO2K as
 purely malicious.  The cDc makes this easy with their irreverant
 attitude and provacative "marketing."   I personally don't like 
 the name of the group or their product.  However, it would be 
 shooting to messengers to discount the value of the package based
 solely their name. 
</p>

<p>
 BO2K is just a tool.  It has no ethics.  It has legitimate uses.
 It can be put to unethical uses.  The exploitable flaws that allow
 it to be used perniciously should be fixed.  
</p>

<p>
 A Melissa or WinExplorer.zip style delivery of a BO2K derived
 trojan is a major security risk for all organizations that rely on
 Win32 based systems (NT, '9x, and W2K).  
</p>

<p>
 We can be thankful to the cDc that they chose to publish these, so
 that everyone including Microsoft has a chance to address the real
 problem --- and we can only wonder how long these bugs have been
 secretly exploited by more clandestine groups and individuals.
</p>

<p>
 In last month's blurb I talked about the Linux reaction to an
 "offensive" messenger (Mindcraft).  My point was that the Linux and 
 Apache developers didn't ignore the message while discrediting the
 messenger.   We'll see if Microsoft can learn from that example.
</p>

<p>
 Meanwhile, Bernie, if you're reading this, feel free to 
 use BO2K.  I'll let you wrestle with your own conscience and come
 to your own conclusions about the ethical implications and
 practical repurcussions of *how* you use it.
</p>

<p>
 In the past I've occassionally tried to honor a "tech of the 
 month."  Unfortunately I haven't had the time to maintain that as a
 tradition.  This month, for variety, I'll point to a "link of the
 month:"
</p>

<blockquote><dl>
		<dt>Linux Games - Even Penguins Like To Have Fun
		<dd><a href="http://www.linuxgames.com/"
			>http://www.linuxgames.com/</a>
</dl></blockquote>
 
<p>
  Meanwhile, if you haven't had enough of my writing for one month,
  look to the <a href="http://www.linuxcare.com/">Linuxcare Inc. web site</a> 
  in coming weeks.  I may be writing to a more "corporate" audience there 
  on a regular basis.
