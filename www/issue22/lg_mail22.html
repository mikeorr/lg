Hi,
<BR>


I have just set up a system for RedHat Linux, but I am finding getting real 
support for
this system is very difficult. In fact, I cannot even setup my webpage via 
SLIP from
the manuals I have. Redhat seems to go against it'scompetitor Caldera, and I 
am 
finding it hard to find the right manuals and guides for this system.

<BR>

Do you have an online help person, who I can log to ?
<BR>

Looking forward to your reply,

Subject: 3com509b problems
<br>
<p>
I recently added a 3com509b Ethernet card to my Win95/Linux machine. I
run the machine in PnP mode and the RedHat 4.2 install process won't
recognize the card. RedHat's solution was to disable PnP for the
machine. While this might be fine for Linux, I am forced to use Win95
for a number of things and turning off PnP (which works great for me on
Win95) will be a real pain in the ass.
<p>
Is there a way I might have my cake and eat it too? I do know which IRQ
the card is being assigned to.
<p>
Thanks, Dave

 Hi,
<p>
My name is Erwin Penders an i'm working for a local ISP in the
Netherlands.
I don't know if i send this mail to the right place, but i have a question
about a
Linux problem.
I want to know how to set up an email-only account (so you can call the
ISP,
make a connection and send/receive email) without the possiblity for WWW,
Telnet etc. The main problem is that i don't know how to set up the
connection
(the normal accounts get a /etc/ppp/ppplogin).... . .
<p>
Can anybody help me with this problem !?

<br><p>
First of all Thanks for a great e-zine!
<p>
And then to my question... (You didn't really think that I wrote to you
just to be friendly did you? ;-)
<p>
Is there any software written for IDE cd-r for example Mitsumi CR2600TE?
<p>
I found two programs; Xcdroast and CDRecord for Linux, but unfortunately
they don't support IDE cd-r :-(
<p>
I haven't found anything regarding this problem and I've used darned
near all search tools on the net...
Any answer would be appreciated. If the answer is no, can I solve this
problem somehow?

Subject: Redhat Linux 4.3 Installation Help<br><p>
I am trying to install Redhat Linux 4.3 on a Windows 95 (not OSR 2)
machine.
I do want to set this machine up as dual boot but that's not really my
problem. I have been totally unable to set up Linux because I am unable to
set up the Non-MS DOS partition that Linux requires. I am pretty new to
Linux. I would appreciate anyone that could give me detailed step by step
instructions on how I go about setting up Redhat Linux. I would call
Redhat
directly but I am at work during their operating hours and not near the
machine I need help with this! Please, somebody help me out!!
<p>
Thanks!!

From now  on I will put  a  mention to the GNU   (and free in general)
software I make use in the "acknowledgment" section of my (scientific)
papers.  I suggest to  do  the same  to all  those who  are working on
scientific applications.  Since Linux is getting stronger every day in
the scientific community,  this could represent  an important support,
specially  when requesting funding.  Even  better  would be to make  a
database  with all these "acknowledgments" in  a Web site or something
similar. Do  anyone know   of   something like  this that  is  already
working? Any comments?

    I just discovered Linux in July and am totally pleased. After years
of Dos, Win 3.1, OS/2 and Win95, ( I won't discuss my experience with
Apple), I think I found an operating system I can believe in.I cannot
make this thing crash!
<p> The Linux Gazette has been a rich source of information and makes
being a newbe a great deal easier.I want to thank you for the time and
effort you put into this publication. It has made my induction into the
Linux world a lot easier.
<p>     Did I mention I am having way too much fun exploring this operating
system? Am I wierd or what?

being live and with the speed of a local disk.  Please keep offering

As a relative newbie to Linux, I have found your magazine of immense use
in answering the plethora of questions I have. Keep up the good work.

Subject: Response to req. for help - defrag
<BR><p>

I saw the request for information about the (lack of) need for defragging
in issue 20, and have just been studying the disk layout a bit anyway.
<P>

Hope the following is helpful:

<P>

In reference to the question titled "Disk defrag?" in issue 20 of the
Linux Gazette:
<P>

I had the same question in the back of my mind once I finally Linux up and
running after some years of running a DOS based computer. After I was
asked the same question by someone else, I poked around a bit and did find
a defrag utility buried someplace on sunsite. The documentation pretty
much indicated that with the ext2 file system it is rarely necessary to
use the utility (he wrote it prior to the general use of ext2fs). He gave
a bit of an explanation and I found some additional information the other
day following links that (I believe) originated in the Gazette.
<P>

Basically, DOS does not keep a map of the disk usage in memory, and each
new write simply starts from the next available free cluster (block),
writes till it gets to the end of the free space and then jumps to the
next free space and continues. After it reaches the end of the disk or at
the next reboot, the "next free cluster" becomes the "first free cluster",
which is probably where something was deleted, and may or may be an
appropriate amount of free space for the next write. There is no planning
ahead for either using appropriate sized available spaces or for
clustering related files together. The result is that the use of space on
the disk gets fragmented and disorganized rather quickly, and the defrag
utilities are a necessary remedy.
 <P>

In fairness to DOS, it was originally written for a computer with precious
little memory, and this method of allocating write locations didn't strain
the resources much.
<P>

The mounting requirement under unices allows the kernel to keep a map of
the disk usage and allocate disk space more intelligently. The Ext2
filesystem allocates writes in "groups" spread across the area of the
disk, and allocates files in the same group as the directory to which they
belong. This way the disk optimization is done as the files are written
to disk, and a separate utility is not needed to accomplish it.
<P>

Your other probable source of problems is unanticipated shutdowns (power
went out, Dosemu froze the console and you don't have a way to dial in
through the modem to kill it - it kills clean, btw ;-), or your one year
old niece discovered the reset button). This will tend to cause lost
cluster type problems with the files you had open at the time, but the
startup scripts almost universally run fsck, which will fix these
problems. You WILL notice the difference in the startup time when you have
had an improper shutdown.
<P>

So, yes, you may sleep with peace of mind in this respect.

<P>


                                         Arnold M.J. Hennig

Subject: Linux and Mac worlds vs Microsoft?
<P>

Michael Hammel made an interesting comment in the September letters
column about aligning with Mac users against Microsoft. The situation's
not nearly as rosy as all that, what with Steve Jobs' latest activity in
the Mac world. As a Mac diehard, I'm facing the prospect of a good
platform being wiped out by its own creator, whether it's really his
attention or not. IMHO the Linux world should be pushing for things like
cheap RISC hardware (which IBM and Motorola have but aren't pushing) and
support from companies like Adobe. I know that in my case, if the MacOS
is robbed of a future, I won't be turning to Windows for anything but
games...
