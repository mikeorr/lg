<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux.com Launches New Jobs Board</h3>

<p>The Linux Foundation has created a new Linux Jobs Board at Linux.com:
<a href="http://jobs.linux.com/">http://jobs.linux.com/</a>. The new Linux.com Jobs Board can provide
employers and job seekers with an online forum to  find the best and
brightest Linux talent or the ideal job opportunity.</p>

<p>The JobThread Network, an online recruitment platform, reports that
the demand for Linux-related jobs has grown 80 percent since 2005,
showing that Linux represents the fastest growing job category in the
IT industry.</p>

<p>"Linux's increasing use across industries is building high demand for
Linux jobs despite national unemployment stats," said Jim Zemlin,
executive director at the Linux Foundation. "Linux.com reaches
millions of Linux professionals from all over the world. By providing
a Jobs Board feature on the popular community site, we can bring
together employers, recruiters, and job seekers to lay the intellectual
foundation for tomorrow's IT industry."</p>

<p>Employers interested in posting a job opening have two options; they
can post their openings on Linux.com and reach millions of
Linux-focused professionals, or they can use the JobThread Network on
Linux.com to reach an extended audience that includes 50 niche
publishing sites with a combined 9.8 million visitors every month. For
more information and to submit a job posting, please visit:
<a href="http://jobs.linux.com/post/">http://jobs.linux.com/post/</a>.</p>

<p>Job seekers can include their LinkedIn details on their Linux.com
profiles, including their resumes. They can also subscribe to the
Linux.com Jobs Board RSS feed, receive alerts by e-mail, and follow
opportunities about Linux-related jobs on Twitter at
www.twitter.com/linuxdotcom.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google moves to ext4</h3>

<p>Search and software giant Google is now in the process of upgrading
its storage infrastructure from the ext2 filesystem to ext4.</p>

<p>In a recent e-mail post, Google engineer Michael Rubin explained that
"...the metadata arrangement on a stale file system was leading to
what we call 'read inflation'. This is where we end up doing many
seeks to read one block of data."</p>

<p>Rubin also noted that "...For our workloads, we saw ext4 and xfs as
'close enough' in performance in the areas we cared about. The fact
that we had a much smoother
upgrade path with ext4 clinched the deal. The only upgrade option we
have is online. ext4 is already moving the bottleneck away from the
storage stack...."</p>

<p>In a related move, Ted Ts'o has joined Google, after concluding his
term as CTO of the Linux Foundation. Ts'o participated in creating the
ext4 filesystem.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Firefox Grows 40% in 2009, 3.5 now most Popular</h3>

<p>Usage data gathered by Statcounter.com at the end of December showed
Mozilla's Firefox 3.5 finally surpassed both IE 7 and IE 8 to become
the world's most popular Web-browsing software.  Holiday sales brought
IE 8 within a hair of overtaking Firefox, but the latter still was ahead in
mid-January.  See the graph for all browsers, here:
<a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-weekly-200827-201002/">http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-weekly-200827-201002/</a>.</p>

<p>However, combined usage of both IE 7 and IE 8 was almost 42% vs. 30.5%
for both the 3.0 and 3.5 versions of Firefox.</p>

<p>According to the Metrics group at Mozilla, the worldwide growth rate
for Firefox adoption was 40% for 2009.  The number of active daily
users was up an additional 22.8 million for 2009, higher than the 16.4
million users added in 2008.</p>

<p>This increase occurred despite delaying the release of Firefox 3.6
until late January. This next version of the open source browser from
the Mozilla Foundation will feature improvements in stability,
security, and customization, and will also offer features for
location-aware browsing.</p>

<p>A release candidate for 3.6 was available in mid-January. The next
milestone release, version 4.0, has been pushed back until the end of
2010.  It will feature separate processes for each tab, like Google
Chrome, and a major UI update.</p>

<p>According to StatCounter, this was Firefox's market share as of Dec '09:<br />
29% Africa<br />
26% Asia<br />
41% Europe<br />
31% North America<br />
32% South America</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">European Commission Approves Oracle's Acquisition of Sun</h3>

<p>On January 21, Oracle Corporation received regulatory approval from 
the European Commission for its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.  
Oracle expects approval from China and Russia to follow, and expects 
its Sun transaction to close quickly.</p>
 
<p>The European Commission had been under pressure from some of the 
founders of MySQL to separate it from the Sun acquisition on 
competitive grounds.  However, Marten Mickos, the former CEO of MySQL, and 
others had argued that the famed open source database was already on a 
dual commercial and open source development model, and that the large 
community around it could resist any efforts by Oracle to stunt its 
development.</p>
 
<p>The Commission found that concerns about MySQL were not as serious as 
was first voiced. "The investigation showed that although MySQL and 
Oracle compete in certain parts of the database market, they are not 
close competitors in others, such as the high-end segment", the 
Commission said in its announcement. It also concluded that PostgreSQL 
could become an open-source alternative to MySQL, if that should prove 
necessary, and was already competing with Oracle's database.  The 
Commission also said that it was now "...satisfied that competition 
and innovation will be preserved on all the markets concerned."</p>

<p>Oracle hosted a live event for customers, partners, press, and analysts 
on January 27, 2010, at its headquarters in Redwood Shores, 
California.</p>

<p>Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, along with executives from Oracle and Sun, 
outlined the strategy for the combined companies, product roadmaps, 
and the benefits from having all components - hardware, operating 
system, database, middleware, and applications - engineered to work 
together.  The event was broadcast globally, and an archive should be 
available at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/sun/">http://www.oracle.com/sun/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Microsystems Unveils Open Source Cloud Security Tools</h3>
<p>As part of its strategy to help customers build public and private
clouds that are open and interoperable, Sun Microsystems, Inc. is
offering open source cloud security capabilities and support for the
latest Security Guidance from the Cloud Security Alliance. For more
information on Sun's Cloud Security initiatives, visit
<a href="http://www.sun.com/cloud/security/">http://www.sun.com/cloud/security/</a>.</p>

<p>Leveraging the security capabilities of Sun's Solaris Operating
Systems, including Solaris ZFS and Solaris Containers, the security
tools help to secure data in transit, at rest, in use in the cloud,
and work with cloud offerings from leading vendors including Amazon
and Eucalyptus.</p>

<p>Along with introducing new security tools in December, Sun also
announced support for the Cloud Security Alliance's "Guidance for
Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing - Version 2.1." Sun privacy
and security experts have been instrumental in the industry-wide
effort to develop the security guidance, and have been active
participants in the Cloud Security Alliance since its inception. The
new framework provides more concise and actionable guidance for secure
adoption of cloud computing, and encompasses knowledge gained from
real world deployments. For more information, visit
<a href="http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/guidance/">http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/guidance/</a>.</p>

<p>Sun also published a new white paper, "Building Customer Trust in
Cloud Computing with Transparent Security," that provides an overview
of the ways in which intelligent disclosure of security design,
practices, and procedures can help improve customer confidence while
protecting critical security features and data, improving overall
governance. To download the paper, visit
<a href="http://www.sun.com/offers/details/sun_transparency.xml">http://www.sun.com/offers/details/sun_transparency.xml</a>.</p>

<p>Sun announced availability for several open source Cloud Security
tools including:</p>

<ul>
<li>
OpenSolaris VPC Gateway: The OpenSolaris VPC Gateway software
enables customers to quickly create a redundant, secure communications
channel to an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud without the need for
proprietary networking equipment. To download the OpenSolaris VPC
Gateway tool, visit <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/osolvpc/pages/Home/">http://kenai.com/projects/osolvpc/pages/Home/</a>;
<li>
Immutable Service Containers (ISC):  Incorporating many of the
security features of the OpenSolaris operating system, including
Solaris ZFS, Solaris Containers, and Solaris IP Filter and Auditing,
the ISC architecture leverages service compartmentalization and
improved integration techniques to create virtual machines with
significantly improved security protection and monitoring
capabilities. To download the ISC software or pre-built images, visit
<a href="http://kenai.com/projects/isc/pages/OpenSolaris/">http://kenai.com/projects/isc/pages/OpenSolaris/</a>;
<li>
Security Enhanced Virtual Machine Images (VMIs): Using many of the 
techniques developed for the Immutable Service Container project, Sun 
created several security-enhanced VMIs for the Amazon Elastic Compute 
Cloud (EC2). These virtual machines leverage industry accepted 
recommended practices including non-executable stacks, encrypted swap 
and auditing enabled by default. Beyond simple OpenSolaris images, Sun
has also published integrated software stacks such as Solaris AMP and 
Drupal built on these security-enhanced images. To download the VMIs, 
visit <a href="http://www.sun.com/cloud/security/">http://www.sun.com/cloud/security/</a>;
<li>
Cloud Safety Box: Simplifies managing encrypted content in the 
Cloud. Using a simple Amazon S3-like interface, the Cloud Safety Box 
automates the compression, encryption, and splitting of content being 
stored in the cloud on any supported operating system, including 
Solaris, OpenSolaris, Linux, and Mac OS X.
</ul>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Canonical Announces Bazaar Commercial Services</h3>
<p>Companies and open source projects interested in using Canonical's 
popular version control system now have access to a suite of 
commercial services - Consultancy &amp; Conversion, Training, and Support - 
allowing them to migrate, deploy, and manage Bazaar.</p>
 
<p>Used by Ubuntu and other open source and commercial projects, Bazaar 
(bzr) is a version control system (VCS) that supports distributed 
development environments. Many existing version control systems use a 
centralised model, a particular challenge to globally distributed 
'chase the sun' development teams. Although bzr itself is open source, 
there is no requirement for commercial projects to make their code 
publicly available.</p>
 
<p>Sun Microsystems migrated the code for its MySQL database software a 
year ago, using bzr conversion and support services. "We wanted to use 
a tool which suited our distributed contributor model for MySQL, but 
we needed the reassurance of access to the Bazaar development team 
through our transition and use of the VCS," said Jeffrey Pugh, vice 
president of MySQL Engineering, Sun Microsystems. "We have found bzr 
works really well for our model, and that the bzr support team and 
developers have been responsive to our requirements."</p>
 
<p>"The increasingly distributed nature of software development has 
allowed Bazaar to grow in popularity," said Martin Pool, project 
manager at Canonical. "Our Consultancy &amp; Conversion, Training, and 
Support services give new and existing customers piece of mind when 
setting up such a vital piece of infrastructure."</p>

<p>Canonical is now offering comprehensive training in Bazaar to get 
staff up-to-speed quickly and transfer best practice knowledge. Both 
the content and delivery are tailored to meet the needs of individual 
teams and development environments, so developers can get the most out 
of the training sessions.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Canonical offers support program for Lotus Symphony</h3>

<p>At IBM Lotusphere in January, Canonical announced a dedicated support
program for Lotus Symphony, the no-charge office productivity
component of the IBM Client for Smart Work (ICSW) on Ubuntu. This
support is made available to customers by Canonical through the IBM
and Canonical partner network.</p>

<p>The IBM Client for Smart Work helps organisations save up to 50
percent per seat on software costs versus a Microsoft-based desktop,
in addition to avoiding requisite hardware upgrades. The package
allows companies to use their existing PCs, lower-cost netbooks, and
thin clients.</p>

<p>The open standards-based core solution comprises of Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
Desktop Edition and Lotus Symphony, which includes word processing,
spreadsheets, and presentations, fully supported by Canonical at US $5.50
per user, per month based on 1000 seat deployment.
Optional solution components include desktop virtualisation and
recovery options using VERDE from Virtual Bridges, and a variety of
Lotus collaboration capabilities with choice of delivery model: on
site, on the cloud, or using an appliance.</p>

<p>"The economic case for Ubuntu and the IBM Client for Smart Work is
unarguable," says Shiv Kumar, EVP of Sales at ZSL, one of the first
IBM and Canonical partners to make this solution available. "The
addition of support from Canonical at super-competitive pricing means
companies have the reassurance of world class support through the
entire stack."</p>

<p>IBM Client for Smart Work for Ubuntu core solution is available
(unsupported) at no charge from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/partners/icsw">http://www.ubuntu.com/partners/icsw</a>.</p>
