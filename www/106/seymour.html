<H2>Living on the Grid</H2>

<p>
Last month's column discussed hierarchy, the relationship of one
section of information to another, but now you need to arrange your
information relative to the size and shape of the document you're
creating, whether it's a printed piece or a website. Even on a single
page, arranging your data effectively and quickly can be a challenge.
One method of simplifying the process is to create a grid that will
structure your layout.


<p>
A design grid is precisely that: a set of lines, usually horizontal and
vertical, that form columns and boxes to which you can align your type
and rules and illustrations. The use of grid is far older than those
modern designers who claimed to have invented it in the 1950s; as soon
as Gutenberg invented movable type, the rectangular alignment of text
would gradually replace the far more fluid page design practiced by the 
calligraphers of the Middle Ages.

<a id="anchor1" name="anchor1"></a>
<p>
As examples of what would disappear with the surplanting of writing by
printing, here are pages from the classic Lindisfarne gospel,
illuminated in 715 (that's not a typo, by the way; the monks in the 
Northumbrian monastery at Lindisfarne were working in inks on vellum 700
years before Gutenberg began his career), and a letter by the famed
Italian calligrapher Arrighi, written in 1521 (click on the images for a

</a>

<a id="anchor2" name="anchor2"></a>
<p>
Here is Gutenberg's Bible, printed in 1454, and a magnificent work by
Arrighi, done in 1513, proving that calligraphy did not die out
overnight (click on the images for a larger view):

</a>

<a id="anchor3" name="anchor3"></a>
<p>
But the use of grid, however, predates Gutenberg. Note, in this
Bible handwritten in France in 1190, how the scribes laid down a
grid of pale blue lines to denote the areas where the text
should align, as they still did much later in this Spanish
breviary and a <em>Book of Hours</em> illuminated in England (though
written in Latin), both done in 1450 (click on the images for a larger

(For more examples of classic calligraphy, browse <a
href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7especcoll/westmss/westmss_browse.html"
target="_blank">Dartmouth's collection</a>, or that of the <a
href="http://www.bl.uk/collections/manuscripts.html"
target="_blank">British Library</a>.)

<p>
If the French bible is not the first use of grid, it's a
<em>very</em> early example. It's also a very complicated
6x11 grid, with precise spacing; it could easily be used to lay out a 
sophisticated book or magazine page today. While the large &quot;white
space&quot; borders would now usually be seen only in art or photography
books, they allowed for the marginal notations (corrections, additions, 
or observations) often added by later scribes or owners of the
manuscript; the study of 'marginalia' is used by scholars to track both
textual and political changes to ancient works.

<p>
The use of white space is fast becoming a lost art, now usually seen
only in the design of hardback books. My calligraphy and book design
professor, <a 
href="http://www.library.cmu.edu/Research/SpecialCollections/arnold.html">
Arnold Bank</a>, was explicit about margins or borders: gutter
margins (the left hand area in the French bible photo; it's a
right-hand page) were &#039;1&#039;, top margins were &#039;2&#039;,
outside margins (the right hand area in the French bible) were
&#039;3&#039;, and bottom margins were &#039;4&#039;. These are not
absolute numbers, like inches or picas, but relative numbers: once you 
decided the width of one margin, based on the size and shape of the
page, the others computed themselves. They provide an elegant, if 
increasingly unused, look to the page.


<p>
Most margins in our four design paradigms - books, newspapers,
magazines, and catalogs - are set mechanically these days; a half
inch or three-quarters of an inch is common, and the same dimension is often
used all the way around the page. Corporate designs (letterhead,
newsletters, etc.) are even more uniform; you can assume a half inch
margin on almost any piece you pick up.

<p>
Web design, of course, is both more flexible and more imprecise. It's
more flexible, in that every page in a site can have (not that it
<em>should</em> have) a different set of margins, as can
each paragraph on the page. It's more imprecise, in that it's very hard
(even with CSS) to specify the exact dimensions or position of any
object on the page; every combination of OS and browser will produce a
different result, some slight and some horrific.

<h2>Why make a grid?</h2>

Just as our brains create pattern out of randomness (see
<a href="../105/seymour.html">Paradigms</a> in the August issue), so too
do our brains strive to make things line up. If you have objects strewn 
across a page, without any apparent alignment, we don't know if some are
related, or on what path we should move our eyes. Again, academic
research has shown that undirected viewers move their eyes in a '7' or
'Z' formation across the page or screen, tracking roughly left-to-right
across the top, diagonally across the middle, then quickly left-to-right
again across the bottom. (There may well be data showing that Arabic or 
Hebrew readers do the same in reverse fashion, right-to-left.) What they
are searching for, of course, is <em>what is important</em>,
along with <em>what goes with what here</em>.

<a id="anchor4" name="anchor4"></a>
<p>
To see the effects of grid on information, check out these simple <a
href="misc/seymour/ungridded.html">ungridded</a> and <a
href="misc/seymour/gridded.html">gridded</a> versions of the Gettysburg
Address. While readable, the ungridded version does not present
Lincoln's words with the gravity they deserve, and the photographs are
not in any recognizable order. The gridded version, though not terribly
sophisticated graphically, provides a clear path for the reader to
acquire the information, and reinforce the somber dignity of his speech.
Adding more data, or more complex imagery, would make the ungridded page
even more difficult to read.

<p>
There are grids in use around us all the time, some so familiar that we
fail to notice. Cities like New York, of course, whose streets are laid
out in equally spaced, right-angled rows, exemplify the grid; how else 
could you have 'gridlock'? The layouts of almost all printed periodicals
are based on grids; as noted in last month's column, newspapers have
been gridded for hundreds of years. Comic strips, while not typically 
thought of as mainstream design metaphors, are commonly drawn using
grids; one of the criticisms of 'underground' comics was that they
refused to keep their material &quot;in the box&quot; like their more 
mainstream cousins. While magazines have taken to breaking the grid of
late (<em>Wired</em> magazine is an excellent example, though their <a
href="http://www.wired.com/wired/" target="_blank">website</a> is pretty
gridded up), there usually remains an underlying grid which provides
the stable base from which the designer can then depart.

<h2>Using grid</h2>

<p>
Alignment and consistent spacing is the key to an effective grid. Going
back to our prototype grid, note how a simple set of columns and rows
provide a very complex set of possible alignments:

<p>
<img src="misc/seymour/Bible1190.png" alt="[Bible Image]" height="100"
width="71" border="0">
<a id="anchor5" name="anchor5"></a>

<p>
Now let's use that same grid in a modern context. (As html-generating
software for web design is still in the Dark Ages, well before
Gutenberg's time, relative to page-layout software for print design, 
the sample pages below were created off-line using graphic software.)
I've recreated the 800-year-old French grid, 6 columns wide by 11 rows
tall (click on the image for a larger view):

<p>
<a href="misc/seymour/Grid1190.html">
    <img src="misc/seymour/Grid1190Small.png" alt="[Grid Example Image]"
        height="100" width="70" border="0">
</a>

<a id="anchor6" name="anchor6"></a>


<p>
Now let's take that grid and stretch it into modern (5.50 x 8.50 inch)
dimensions; this is a half-sheet of letter-sized paper, thus a common
page size (click on the image for a larger view):

<p>
<a href="misc/seymour/GridModern.html">
    <img src="misc/seymour/GridModernSmall.png" alt="[Modern Grid
Example Image]" height="100" width="65" border="0">
</a>
<a id="anchor7" name="anchor7"></a>

<p>
Then let's put our Gettysburg Address text and photos into this grid
(click on the image for a larger view):

<p>
<a href="misc/seymour/GridAddress1.html">
    <img src="misc/seymour/GridAddressSmall.png" alt="[Gettysburg Grid
Image]" height="100" width="65" border="0">
</a>

<a id="anchor8" name="anchor8"></a>


<p>
It's much better graphically than our first attempt, and it can also be
rapidly shifted, if the layout of the document requires a different look
(though the long line length of the Address text in this version is 
problematic, an issue we will cover in a future column) (click on the
image for a larger view):

<p>
<a href="misc/seymour/GridAddress2.html">
    <img src="misc/seymour/GridAddress2Small.png" alt="Gettysburg Grid
        Image 2" height="100" width="65" border="0">
</a>

<p>
We could stir this page any of a half dozen ways, still using our
eight-century old grid, and achieve equally good-looking solutions. But
these examples will hopefully illustrate the power and the glory of
using grids. It's a simple way to make your work cleaner, faster, and
more professional looking.

<h2>Investigating grid</h2>

<p>
I'm not going to over-analyze these grid-using sites, but they're a good
place to start your own study into the use of grid:

<p>
<a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/"
target="_blank">http://www.airbagindustries.com/</a>; an extremely
elegant personal site. Many bigger sites could learn a lot from this
guy.


<p>
<a href="http://www.lacountyarts.org/"
target="_blank">http://www.lacountyarts.org/</a>; this site is (perhaps)
excessively gridded. It seems to use the boxed grid even in instances
where it's more awkward or confusing than another visual construct might
prove.

<p>
<a href="http://www.eskimo.is/news.asp"
target="_blank">http://www.eskimo.is/news.asp</a>; a simple set of
grids, but effective. Note that there are at least four grids at work
here: the text &amp; photos grid in 'News', the text-only variant in
'The Company', the photos-only grid in 'Models', and the data collection
grid in 'Request'.

<p>

<a href="http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/hitchblog/blog.htm"
target="_blank">http://hitchhikers.movies.go.com/hitchblog/blog.htm</a>;
a small site that uses its grid effectively, with good navigation tools
that let you move quickly through the site.

<p>
<a href="http://www.idmodels.com/"
target="_blank">http://www.idmodels.com/</a>; a hard-gridded site, with
only three grids in use. Fortunately, they leave Flash animations behind
on the landing page, but their other pages are very rigid, with text and
photos absolutely identical on every page that uses the same grid.

<p>
For further study, there are numerous works available on the use of grid
in graphic design. Check out the gridded structure of these book covers;
the authors (or their jacket designers) practice what they preach:

<p>
Note that several of these books were written by German or Swiss
authors; if you've ever been to either country, you'll know why. If you
haven't, imagine extreme tidiness as a national
characteristic...

<p>
There is also <a href="http://www.creativepro.com/story/news/8411.html"
target="_blank">grid-producing software</a> available, though you can
create your own (or at least a semblance of a grid) in most layout
applications these days, whether print or web.

<p>
Now, go and grid some more.

<em>
<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven
years old, and the state of the art was typing copy on Gestetner masters.
I've worked on every new technology since, but I still own an X-acto knife
and know how to use it.

<p> I've been a freelancer, and worked in advertising agencies, printing
companies, publishing houses, and marketing organizations in major
corporations. I also did a dozen years [1985-1997] at Apple Computer; my
first Macintosh was a Lisa with an astounding 1MB of memory, and my current
one is a Cube with a flat screen.

<p> I've had a website up since 1997, and created my latest one in 2004. I'm
still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.
