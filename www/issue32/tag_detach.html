>Detaching and Re-attaching to Interactive Background Processes</H3>
<p><strong>From Lawrence Tung on 16 Aug 1998 </strong></p>
<!-- begin body -->

<strong><p>Hi, James: When I run a background interactive process, e.g. 
<tt>ncftp</tt>, I logout. Is it possible to reattach this process to a terminal
again after I relogin?
</p></strong>
<strong><p>Lawrence

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50" 
	alt="(!)" border="0"
>Look for a program called '<tt>screen</tt>'.   It's included with
most distributions and it's available at the UNC repository
(Sunsite) at:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code
	><A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/console"
	>http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/console</A>
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>(which technically isn't the the best place for it since
it isn't a "console" specific utility --- you can use it
from any terminal, dial-up line, xterminal, or over <tt>telnet</tt>
and <tt>rlogin</tt> sessions).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>'<tt>screen</tt>' gives you the ability to multiplex a number of 
interactive shell sessions through a single terminal
session.  You reserve one keystroke (<tt>[Ctrl]+[A]</tt> by default)
which is the meta key that provides access to all '<tt>screen</tt>'
functions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Thus the key sequence <tt>[Ctrl]+[A], [D]</tt> will 
&quot;detach&quot; your currently running screen session from the 
current terminal connection.  To re-attach later (from that terminal session
or any other) you use the '<tt>screen -r</tt>' command.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you first start '<tt>screen</tt>' you might first think that 
"nothing" happened.  It normally just starts a single shell
session.  If you start a command (such as '<tt>vi</tt>' or '<tt>emacs</tt>')
and use the key sequence <tt>[Ctrl]+[A], [C]</tt> you'll &quot;create&quot;
a new session.  You can now toggle between the current
subsession and the most recently active one by by typing 
<tt>[Ctrl]+[A]</tt> twice.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can "cycle" from one screen to the "next" (through
all of them in a round robin fashion) by typing:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code>[Ctrl]+[A] [Space]
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>
... and you can get to any of your subsessions (interactive
windows) using the meta key (<tt>[Ctrl]+[A]</tt>) followed by a
single digit.  You can have up to ten '<tt>screen</tt>' subsessions
for any screen session.  You can even have multiple
screen sessions detached.  Your '<tt>screen -r</tt>' command will
list the PID's/sockets of the sessions that you own and
will let you specify the PID (socket extension) of the
one you want to resume.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>To send a <tt>[Ctrl]+[A]</tt> through to your applications 
(to move your point/cursor to be beginning of an '<tt>emacs</tt>' line, for
example) you'd type <tt>[Ctrl]+[A], [A]</tt>.  (Note that the first is
a "control" character and the next is just the normal,
unshifted, letter).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Of course you can change the &quot;meta&quot; key --- but I like it 
just the way it is.  There are the usual sorts of command
line options, and there are also "colon" commands to set 
many parameters modes and options.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you &quot;detach&quot; a screen session then all of the 
&quot;windows&quot; or &quot;subsessions&quot; are left running.  They are
not suspended (as they'd be if you used <tt>[Ctrl]+[Z]</tt> on 
them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There are many other '<tt>screen</tt>' features:  
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Interactive Backscroll (using '<tt>vi</tt>' keys for 
	paging, searching, and scrolling).

<li>Keyboard driven cut and past of anything in
	the backscroll buffer.

<li>"Screen shot" (quick paste of current screen
	to a file).

<li>"Log to file" (open a log file for a given
	subsession --- similar to a typescript '<tt>script</tt>'
	command).

<li>Command/shell driven creation of new subsessions
	(if you issue a '<tt>screen</tt>' command from within a 
	'<tt>screen</tt>' session you can start a command 
	asynchronously in a new subsession).
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>... and many others.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>About the only three features I think are missing from 
'<tt>screen</tt>' are:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>support to '<tt>split</tt>' your terminal (to see parts
	of two subsessions concurrently --- either top and
	bottom, or side-by-side). (You can run '<tt>splitvt</tt>'
	under '<tt>screen</tt>' to get this effect).

<li>embedded '<tt>expect</tt>'/TCL support for context sensitive
	keyboard remapping (although you can run '<tt>expect</tt>'
	under '<tt>screen</tt>' spawning other programs and using
	the same '<tt>interact</tt>' logic you would in any other
	'<tt>expect</tt>' script).

<li>multi-user "co-pilot" (allowing two or more users
	to "share" a 'screen' session).
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>It appears that the authors were playing with some "co-pilot"
features and gave up on them.  Some of the colon commands 
have to do with controlling in memory "access control lists"
(ACL's) which are apparently preliminary support to allow
multiple users, on multiple terminals to have concurrent
access to one screen session (with some or all of them
being "read-only" and others having full "read-write" 
to the session).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>It is possible to do very simple two way collaboration 
using '<tt>kibitz</tt>' (an '<tt>expect</tt>' script that's included 
with some Linux distributions).  It's a bit clunking but 
functional.  However it does give the "kibitzer" full
terminal access to your session, including the ability
to kill or suspend a running program and access to your
shell.  Thus '<tt>kibitz</tt>' (as it's written) should be used
only to work with trusted parties (someone that you'd
sit down at your keyboard with access to one of your
login sessions).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>It might be possible to modify '<tt>kibitz</tt>' for 
read-only access.  This would be conception similar to running a 
command like:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code>script /tmp/mytypescript.broadcast
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>... and having your 'clients' run the command:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code>tail -f /tmp/mytypescript.broadcast
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>... except that it would flushing it's buffers 
far more frequently.  (If you actually try running
the '<tt>script</tt>/<tt>tail</tt>' pair as shown --- or you use
'<tt>screen</tt>' "log to file" feature and slap a <tt>tail -f</tt>
on <EM>that</EM> file --- you'll see that a few kilobytes of
buffers are not written to the <tt>tail -f</tt> process until
enough other activity has occurred on that screen/subsession
or shell.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>By comparison '<tt>kibitz</tt>' is writing synchronously 
--- it's flushing each character out to its file (which I think
is actually a Unix domain socket rather than a regular file).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, the things that I'd like to see added to 
'<tt>screen</tt>' are merely a consolidation of tools that are already 
available, and that all seem to be completely compatible with it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In any event, I highly recommand '<tt>screen</tt>' --- 
it's the closest thing to DESQview that I've ever found for Unix.

<p><strong>From Lawrence Tung on 17 Aug 1998 </strong></p>
<!-- begin body -->

<strong><p>Hi, Jim: Thanks for your reply. I've used "screen" before. I need to
start "screen" before I "detach" the terminal. right? Is it possible
to reattch a process to a terminal after you relogin without
starting any utilities in advance?
</p></strong>
<strong><p>Lawrence

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50" 
	alt="(!)" border="0">Not under current versions of Linux.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Conceptually you could have a kernel feature
that allowed you to do something like this ---- for
example if you were using a 'streams' based
terminal driver (or some custom terminal driver). 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Basically the gist of it is that you have to know
what you want in advance.  There is no "normal" 
(standard or conventional) Unix/Linux mechanism for
this --- so you have to either use a utility for it
--- or you have to select an implementation that has
"nonstandard" features.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Frankly I don't know of any Unix that does support
this sort of thing (except via '<tt>screen</tt>' of course).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>As a couple of side notes:
</blockquote>
<blockquote><tt>ncftp</tt> has direct support for background 
and "re-dial" file fetching.  Some of these
are enhanced in the at <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/">ncftp.com</a>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you need this sort of "attach and detach"
feature for X the best I've been able to find
thus far is to use the VNC Xserver and attach
to it via the VNC client of your choice.
Look at <A HREF="http://www.realvnc.com/"
	>http://www.realvnc.com/</A> for details.
