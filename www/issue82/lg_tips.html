I recently installed 2.4.18.  I've got 99% of the stuff I want/need

IIRC I had some probs playing stuff that wasn't the right sample-rate
(not midi, mind you), meaning 48kHz did play and 44100 not or other
way around. Maybe thats where the problem lies.
If noone else here can help you I can recommend debianhelp.org, maybe
your last chance

That's very interesting - considering that they use completely different
methods and even different devices. "Timidity" actually doesn't use the
MIDI system (I don't remember whether it's "<TT>/dev/audio</TT>" or "<TT>/dev/dsp</TT>").
You can test these with
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>cat /etc/motd &gt; /dev/audio
cat /etc/motd &gt; /dev/dsp
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This should produce short bursts of noise for each device; if it
doesn't, you need to look into why that device isn't working.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
BTW, have you looked at your volume settings? Do realize that there are
different ones for different devices, and the relevant ones for what
you're doing may be turned way down.

<P>
If you use bash -- especially tab-completion -- you'll love this feature.
</P>
<P>
First, see (<A HREF="http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3?idpa=317091&idpl=317091&stat=4&search=bash-completion"
	>http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3?idpa=317091&idpl=317091&stat=4&search=bash-completion</A>).
Tarballs and RPMs are available to power up programmable completion for
your bash shell.
</P>
<P>
Once you install the software, try stuff like this ("&lt;TAB&gt;" literally
means "hit the tab button"):
</P>

<blockquote><pre>$ find -user &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ find -gid &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ rpm -e &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ killall &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ grep --&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ cvs &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ mount &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ kill -&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ kill -HUP &lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;

$ ssh adamm@&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
This last one should work without installing software.
</P>
<P>
The concept is simple but handy. Completion functions define what
arguments are useful to complete certain commands. Enjoy!
</P>

That's quite a broad question. Gurus like Richard Stevens, Douglas E
Comer wrote atleast three volumes each on this topic. I suggest you read
Richar Stevens' "UNIX Network Programming" book.

If you want to know about socket programming(I guess that's what you mean
by c code), there are plenty of articles on web. Google.com is the best place
to search. This is one of the articles I found:

Today, the curiosity bug bit me again, so I poked my nose into the Linux
Visor USB mailing list, and - lo and behold - there it was. Seems that the
new version of "coldsync", at least the beta, now handles the m125! I
downloaded it, configured it, compiled it, made a config file - and...
ta-daa! Palm USB synchronization, under Linux.

I assume that you have "usbcore", "usb-uhci", "usbserial", and "visor"
modules loaded, or the equivalent kernel options compiled in - yes?  I'm
running "coldsync" v2.2.5 my "~/.coldsyncrc" looks like this:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously, you'll need to have the appropriate username and userid.
Other than that, the only assumption that we're making here is that the
130 works the same way as a 125 - not an unreasonable assumption, but
worth checking if things don't work out.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Ok, thanks,  I should probably contact the coldsync crew at this point.
If I'm doing something wrong then it is a problem with the documentation.

As with most (all?) things Linux, there are a couple of ways to do it.
Linuxconf will do it, so will internet-druid. IIRC, there is something
on the Control Panel that does that as well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

...you just have to set the
interface connected to your cable modem (say eth0) to use DHCP (AT&amp;T has
stopped giving static IP i think).

But one thing I have not confirmed is if we can directly use Linux

I am a novice linux enthusiast. i had a fried mbr some
time back and read your article in linux gazzette.
Clearing out the mbr worked fine. I only installed
windows 2000 after clearing the mbr.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But i am running into a problem now, when i try to
install linux again. I have used RedHat linux 7.2 the
first time ( when i damaged the mbr)...
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
The MBR isn't something you can really "damage"; it's just some bytes on
the first sector of the HD. Clearing it out pretty much puts paid to the
problem; there isn't anything that can be left over to cause later
problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
...and it installed
without any problem. But this time, as i try to create
the partitions, it is not able to create the partition
and pops up a message asking if i want to clear every
thing in the hard disk.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am using a 20GB seagate hard disk. If this problem
cant be rectified with the present hard disk, i am
willing to install a fresh separate hard disk for
linux. it appears that having both windows and linux
on the same hard disk is always causing problems.
please tell me how to go about installing a second
hard disk and loading linux on it, assuming that i
already have one hard disk that is currently running
windows 2000.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please advice. I hope i have made my problem clear.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks again.

[Ben] 
I can't really say what the current problem is, since you've
given minimum detail here... could I get you to report the exact message
that you see? I've never been a particular fan of DiskDruid (the
partitioning software used by RedHat's install), and automatically jump
to "fdisk" (or "cfdisk", for preference, if it's available) in case of
any partitioning problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Out of curiosity, do you have any available partitions for your Linux
installation? You can't just slap in another OS; if you only have one
partition (the one where Wind*ws is installed), then I can see a
situation where you would be asked to "clear the hard disk". If you need
to shrink your Wind*ws partition to make room for Linux, take a look at
FIPS (a quick Net search will bring it up.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Or use a flavor of Linux that prefers to live in a FAT filesystem -
either using UMSDOS or a giant file to be loopback mounted.  I believe
Phatlinux and BigSlack are likely candidates, but I've never used
either, so I can't say more.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Note that FIPS can only tweak FAT filesystems and its author isn't
updating it (since he's busy working on a Ph.D), while GNU parted
can also tweak ext2, and reiser filesystems.  I think it can do ext3,
or you might have to turn off the journals first so it's ext2 again.
Anyways there's a floppy rescue-disk that contains parted:

Thanks Ben and TAG;
</STRONG></P>

I have used fdisk this time for partitioning the free
space on the disk and have been able to successfully
make partitions and install the OS. Thanks a lot once
again.

Hi, Matt here.  I found your address online while researching a problem.
We have had occasional problems with files being corrupted when we FTP them
to our test server.  The files being corrupted are web files(Cold Fusion).
I know some people use the ASCII transfer option and others are usig the
binary option.  Could the ASCII be the problem?  Thanks,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Matt
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Iron] 
FTP in binary mode transmits the file exaactly as is.  FTP in ASCII mode
changes the end-of-line characters to what the destination computer expects.
(Unix uses the linefeed character, Macintosh uses carriage-return, and
Windows uses both.)  Use ASCII mode only for plain text files.  Any other
type of file (.gz, .tar, image, word processor file, etc) must be transferred
in binary mode or it will be corrupted beyond usability.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
HTML and XML are text-based formats, so ASCII mode should be fine.  I don't
know whether Cold Fusion uses HTML format or its own format.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you've corrupted a binary file by transferring it in ASCII mode and there
are no backup copies available, you <EM>may</EM> be able to recover the data by doing
your steps exactly in reverse.  Go to the computer you ran the FTP program at,
start the exact same program, switch to ASCII mode, and do a PUT instead of a
GET (or vice versa).  That should reverse whatever changes it did.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">However, it's not guaranteed, since there might have been stray carriage
return or line feed characters which were not initially part of the
conversion.  You can also use the command line of infozip to pack
and then unpack a file to the same effect - handy if you no longer have
the originating system around, either. Infozip is the free 'zip' and
'unzip' found in most Linux distros.

		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> Vikas, I've taken a look at the e-mail
that you sent in regarding
the problems that you were having when authenticating
windows 2000 users
via squid.
</P>
<P>
The errors that you are getting would seem to indicate
that your ACL's
have not been defined correctly (perhaps due to some
syntactical error),
or they do not exist. Now there could be a number of
reasons for this, and
it would be much more helpful to us if you could post
us a copy of your
"<TT>/etc/squid.conf</TT>" file, so that I can see exactly what
is going on.
</P>
<P>
How have you configured Samba and WinBind?? I will
hopefully be covering
Samba in my WM article in the near future -- have you
been able to
authenticate Windows2000 users on the Linux box for
anyother services
besides Squid??
</P>
<P>
Just as a point of interest (and something which was
not covered in my
article), I see from the very last line of your error
log, that you get:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>2002/07/15 10:46:23| Squid is already running!
Process ID 9957
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Since you already have squid running, I would have
suggested that if you
had only changed the configuration file, that you
simply ran:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>squid -k reconfigure
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
furthermore, if you have to stop the Squid process at
anytime, you should
always do it via the "<TT>/etc/init.d/squid</TT> stop" command.
To reload the PID,
use: "<TT>/etc/init.d/squid</TT> restart" -- assuming that the
squid process is
already running.  (sorry to digress from your main
problem).
</P>
<P>
I'm sorry if the level of detail is sketchy, but I
need more information
before I can begin to understand your problem in a
little more detail.
</P>
<P>
Kind Regards,
</P>
<P>
