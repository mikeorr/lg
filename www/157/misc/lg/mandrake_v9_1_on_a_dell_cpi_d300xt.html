<p>
Folks;
</p>

<p>
Several years ago, on a whim while at an OfficMax store I came across a sale 
going on regarding Mandrake v7.0 Linux and dis-satisfaction with MS (and the 
lower sales price) gave me reason enough to purchase the Linux package ... 
from the view of an owner/operator of several units - best thing I think I 
ever did. Couldn't believe that Linux software went on as smoothly as it did 
- and it worked - well mostly it worked but it did it well enough for me to 
keep an eye on the Linux OS which were available.
</p>

<p>
Recently I pulled an old Dell Latitude CPi D330XT out of "storage", deciding 
to keep it as a back up and fully operational unit and once again I've come 
across an old problem, one I never did solve in the past.
</p>

<p>
What I have is the following:
</p>

<p>
. A Dell D300XT laptop with a 10GB HD and 256kRam
</p>

<p>
. Mandrake v9.1 Linux and MS 98SE for Operating Systems
</p>

<p>
With disk partitioning, I've set or better, limited the HD space to just 2GB, 
with Mandrake v9.1 getting the rest of the available HD space. Yes, it does 
work/fit and very nicely at that but ...
</p>

<p>
PROBLEM I: SOUND - how do you get Linux to recognize the built-in sound 
card/chip which is available with these old Dell machines? At present,there 
is no sound at all and there is little doubt here but that and for want of a 
better term, "it's there" and it's just a case of finding out how to activate 
it.
</p>

<p>
PROBLEM II: PPP - It's timing out. I can get the dialer to dial in to the ISP 
but there's no data flow going on and the PPP times out. How do I get this 
software to "click" and connect?
</p>

<p>
PROBLEM III: SCANNER - I have an old (but very reliable V300 Microtech scanner 
but I can't get the Linux software system to recognize that the scanner is 
there. Win98SE will recognize it and operate it and there's no doubt here but 
that Linux will do it to - if I find and "set all the switches" in the proper 
manner. 
</p>

<p>
I'm open to any and all ideas and suggestions.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for your time an interset.
</p>

<p>
I noticed you post substantively the same query to the SF-LUG mailing
list, and was going to respond to you there, but here's fine, too.  I
have bad news and good news.  
</p>

<p>
The bad news is that it's going to be difficult for TAG members and
other Internet-connected Linux advocates to advise you about this
machine remotely, for the simple reason that there's next to no
information on the Internet about a Dell Latitude CPi D330XT laptop
model.  This is a rather unusual situation.  Among other places, there
are two main information sources on the Net about Linux and laptops:
</p>

<p>
o  Linux on Laptops, e.g. for Dell models
   <a href="http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/dell.html">http://www.linux-on-laptops.com/dell.html</a>
</p>

<p>
o  Tuxmobil, e.g., for Dell models <a href="http://tuxmobil.org/dell.html">http://tuxmobil.org/dell.html</a>
</p>

<p>
You'll notice that neither of those sites has a link for a Dell Latitude
model called "D330XT" or even anything close to that.  Either the D330XT
was a rare machine or (maybe?) you might have written down the model
slightly wrong(?).  The latter possibility might be worth checking.
</p>

<p>
Lacking such sources of information, it's not possible for Linux
hardware people (such as me; I dabble in that subject) to tell you what
particular chips for sound and for USB (among other things) the D330XT 
contains.  Drivers on Linux (and, actually, any operating system, though
this fundamental truth is often concealed behind "wizards" and such) are
always written specifically for particular models of chips -- often
called "chipsets" in this context.  For a Linux hardware guy wanting to
know how to make, say, sound work on a given motherboard when it doesn't
work (as the expression goes) "automagically" through the OS installer 
autodetecting it and supplying the right driver without the user needing
to think, the first and primary question is:  What's the sound chipset?
Knowing the sound chipset, the Linux hardware guy can then look up what
Linux driver supports it, and you go on from there.
</p>

<p>
Ordinarily, I just search the Web for a specific model of motherboard
(or laptop), and pretty soon I find out what the onboard sound chip is,
which a couple of minutes later (with any luck) lets me give advice on
how to get sound support going.  
</p>

<p>
In this case, no go, because I'm not finding anything useful on "Dell
Latitude CPi D330XT", which means either no such thing ever existed or
few people have ever seen one.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, that's the bad news.  The good news is:  You have the advantage
of having physical possession of the laptop, and having Mandrake Linux
9.1 on it.
</p>

<p>
And, by the way, might I mention that Mandrake Linux 9.1 is unbelievably
ancient?  That might very well be your sole problem.  For Heaven's sake,
it was released in March 2003, over five years ago.  That means all of
its hardware support is unbelievably antique, too.
</p>

<p>
The distribution hasn't even been called Mandrake for 3 1/2 years:  It
got renamed to "Mandriva" in mid-2005.  The distribution has had
<em>ten</em> releases subsequent to Mandrake Linux 9.1.  Good grief!  You
therefore might want to cease banging your head against that particular
wall and either download or buy Mandrive 2009 -- if you like Mandrake
Linux.  More information about Mandriva:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=mandriva">http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=mandriva</a>
</p>

<p>
Comparative information about distributions:
<a href="http://distrowatch.com/">http://distrowatch.com/</a>
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/index.php?page=kicking#distro">http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/index.php?page=kicking#distro</a>
</p>

<p>
My best advice is thus to abandon the current effort to tame your laptop
on Linux Mandrake 9.1, and try something produced in this half of the
decade.  However, if for some reason you'd like to explore using what
you have:
</p>

<p>
Running this command as the root user produces a report on all PCI-type 
devices found on the system:
</p>

<pre>
#  lspci -vv | less
</pre>

<p>
(The "#" represents the root-user command prompt.  You don't type it.)
</p>

<p>
What you'll see is a quite verbose (thus the double-v option) report of
PCI information directly from the motherboard's PCI chip.  Somewhere in
that swamp of data, a determined user will find make and model
information about any sound chip that's embedded into a (typical)
motherboard.  That information then lets you pretty easily look up what 
Linux sound driver applies to that sound chip.  (This e-mail is already
getting pretty long, so I'll defer trying to teach that.)
</p>




<pre>
&gt; PROBLEM I: SOUND - how do you get Linux to recognize the built-in sound 
&gt; card/chip which is available with these old Dell machines?
</pre>

<p>
Let us know what that chip is, and we might be able to help.  ;-&gt;
</p>



<pre>
&gt; PROBLEM II: PPP - It's timing out. I can get the dialer to dial in to the ISP 
&gt; but there's no data flow going on and the PPP times out. How do I get this 
&gt; software to "click" and connect?
</pre>

<p>
Again, the odds are that this problem will simply vanish with a newer
distribution.  However, once again, you've given us absolutely nothing
in the way of information about the relevant hardware.  What modem are
you attempting to use?  Is this an onboard modem built into the laptop's
motherboard, something on a PCMCIA card, or what?  You don't say.
</p>

<p>
If it's an onboard modem, it might very well be a "winmodem" aka
softmodem -- one on which the manufacturer deliberately cut corners on
chip count, omitting some crucial chip component that then is expected
to be emulated in software, the design of which is held as a
manufacturer-proprietary secret such that the open source community
cannot within reason write real, open source drivers for that particular
cut-rate component, and you're obliged (if you insist on using that
brain-damaged hardware) to download and install proprietary Linux driver
hardware where it's available at all.
</p>

<p>
A long-ago rant I wrote about winmodems:
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/#winmodem">http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/#winmodem</a> 
</p>

<p>
Of course, we don't know you're trying to use an integrated cheapo
winmodem.  We so far don't know anything about what you're trying to
use.  Our knowing <em>what</em> you're trying to use is prerequisite to our
helping you know <em>how</em> to use it.
</p>




<pre>
&gt; PROBLEM III: SCANNER - I have an old (but very reliable V300 Microtech
&gt; scanner but I can't get the Linux software system to recognize that
&gt; the scanner is there.
</pre>

<p>
Important suggestion:  It's really, really important to get the names of
your hardware right, when seeking help from the Linux community with it. 
In this case, I could search all day long, and find nothing useful about
"Microtech" V300 flatbed scanners -- because it's actually a Microtek.  
</p>

<p>
Also, it's really helpful to specify what type of device you're speaking
of.  Armed with the correct name, "Microtek V300", I was able to
determine that information for you -- but you really should have
provided it.  To wit:  You're talking about <em>either</em> a parellel-port
scanner, originally costing about US $30, <em>or</em> a SCSI one that was
usually bundled with a very inexpensive Adaptec AVA1505 SCSI adapter card.
</p>

<p>
These are two separate and somewhat different problems.  Before trying
to help with that, it would be very useful (again) to know what
<em>specifically</em> you have.  Help the Linux community help you:  Please be
specific and detailed in describing the problem!
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that, as usual, getting Linux support going for the
more-squirrelly sort of cheap hardware, in this case the parallel-port
variant, is more convoluted than for the less cut-rate variant (SCSI).
Why?  Mostly because running devices like scanners or Iomega Zip drives
on the parallel-port "bus" was always a kludge:  The manufacturer took a
relatively decent SCSI-type device (scanner, Zip drive, tape drive,
etc.), put it in an enclosure, and hardwireed the SCSI inteface to a
chip that converts its signals to parallel-port ones -- just so the user
doesn't have to buy even a cheap, terrible SCSI card.  Therefore,
getting OS (including Linux) support working for such a parallel-port
device requires getting SCSI support going, then also getting the shim
working that sends SCSI commands over the parallel-port transport, and
last getting going the actual driver for the device (e.g., scanner)
going so that scanner software can talk to it.
</p>

<p>
FYI, the standard scanner software on Linux is "SANE" (Scanner Access
Now Easy), <a href="http://www.sane-project.org/">http://www.sane-project.org/</a> . You'll find good information
about hardware information there.  TAG (this mailing list, The Answer
Gang) can potentially guide you through that, but, again, we need to
know <em>specifically</em> what you have.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I'm open to any and all ideas and suggestions.
</pre>

<p>
And, once again, odds are that all of your problems will go away if you
try something less ancient than Mandrake 9.1 -- because the autoprobing
software inside Linux distribution installers improves all the time.
</p>

<p>
That's what I'd try first.  With reasonable luck, your other problems
might just vanish.  If not, come back with a specific description of
what you have, and (also) what specifically you tried, in attempting to
make things work.
</p>

Er, my mistake.  Apparently not.  Maybe I came across your TAG posting
twice, and mistakenly thought I'd seen it on SF-LUG the first time.
Sorry about the confusion.  (It's been a long day.)
