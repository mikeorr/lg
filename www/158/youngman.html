<h1>Getting Started with the Exim Mail Server</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/youngman.html">Neil Youngman</a></b></p>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Most Linux users don't need to think about mail servers. A typical
Linux installation will just have the distribution's default mail
server installed, and it will do very little.
</p>
<p>
If you need more than that, and you want a FOSS mail server, you will
find that there are 3 popular choices. They
are <a HREF="http://www.sendmail.org/">
Sendmail</a>, <a HREF="http://www.postfix.org/"> Postfix</a>,
and <a HREF="http://www.exim.org/">Exim</a>. This article is about
Exim, which is my mail server of choice.
</p>
<p>
Exim is a very full-featured mail server. It is suitable for most
sites, although very small sites might prefer a simpler alternative
such as <a href="http://msmtp.sourceforge.net/">msmtp</a>.
</p>
</i>I have been using Exim for over 3 years. It has proved to be
efficient, flexible, and reliable, and it provides all the features I
require. Some of the features that you may find useful are Sendmail
compatibility, authentication, encryption, mail relaying, and easy
integration with a number of popular databases, as well as virus and spam
scanners.
</p>
<p>
Exim is highly configurable. The Exim site hosts a <a
HREF="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-current/doc/html/spec_html/">full
manual</a> online, but wading through it for the first time can be quite
daunting. This article aims to give a quick introduction to the key
configuration items. Once you are comfortable with those, you can browse the
manual and the Wiki to find other features which may be useful to you.
</p>
</p>
The configuration file provides a wide range of built-in options,
including hooks allowing file and database lookups and easy
integration with SpamAssassin, ClamAV, and other spam and virus
scanning programs. Some options control which features are provided,
others allow Exim to handle all sorts of misfeatures in other mail
programs with which it needs to communicate. If the right build
options are selected, it also provides hooks into Perl and C programs
that can be used to provide custom functionality.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, the current version of Exim is 4.69. If you
are using any other version you may find that some features differ,
but Exim is very stable and I would expect any recent version to
support all the features in this article.
</p>

<h3>The Mail Life Cycle</h3>
<p>
Exim handles mail in 3 phases. They are <code>acceptance</code>,
<code>routing</code>, and <code>delivery</code>.
</p>
<p>
Acceptance is controlled
by <a HREF="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.69/doc/html/spec_html/ch40.html">
Access Control Lists</a> (ACLs). ACLs determine from whom you accept
email, for which destinations, and any other conditions you care to
impose.
</p>
<p>
Routing is controlled
by <a HREF="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.69/doc/html/spec_html/ch03.html#SECTrunindrou">
routers</a>. Routers determine where Exim will deliver the
mail. Usually this will be either to another mail server or to a local
mailbox.
</p>
<p>
Delivery is controlled
by <a HREF="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.69/doc/html/spec_html/ch07.html#SECID56">
transports</a>. These determine the actual delivery mechanism. Mail may be
passed to another mail server, written to a mailbox, or piped to a
command to process it.
</p>

<h3>The Configuration File</h3>

<p>
The configuration file comprises five main sections: global
configuration options, ACLs, routers, transports, and retry rules.
</p>
<p>
The default configuration file shipped with the source is extremely
well commented. I would not recommend starting a new configuration
from scratch; it will almost always be better to start with the
default configuration and adapt that to your requirements. The
default configuration for Exim 4.69 can be found <a
href="misc/youngman/exim_4.69_default_config.txt">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note that the configuration file shipped with the Exim package for
your distribution may not be the default configuration shipped with
the source.

<h3 style="text-align: center">SMTP and ESMTP</h3>
<p>
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and the Extended Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (ESMTP) are the main protocols used by mail servers
to communicate with each other and by mail clients to submit messages
to a server. A typical SMTP session looks like
</p>
<pre>
220 mail.example.net ESMTP Exim 4.69 Sun, 23 Nov 2008 14:29:20 +0000
HELO client.example.net
250 test.wirefast.net Hello client.example.net [10.20.30.40]
MAIL FROM:&lt;gazetteer@example.net&gt;
250 OK
RCPT TO:&lt;user@example.net&gt;
250 Accepted
DATA
354 Enter message, ending with "." on a line by itself
From:&lt;gazetteer@example.net&gt;
To:&lt;user@example.net&gt;
Subject: Isn't Exim great

You really should check out the article on Exim in this month's
Linux Gazette.

Sincerely

Gaz E Teer
.
250 Message accepted
QUIT
221 mail.example.net closing connection
</pre>
<p>
This can be summarised as the server identifying itself (Exim banner),
after which the sender introduces itself (the <code>HELO</code>
command). When the
<code>HELO</code> command has been accepted, the sender says, I have
some mail from gazetteer@example.net (the <code>MAIL FROM</code>
command). The server accepts this and the sender asks can you deliver
it to user@example.net (the <code>RCPT TO</code> command)? The server says it can,
so the sender gives it the message (the <code>DATA</code> command). A line
consisting of a single '.' marks the end of the message and the sender
ends the conversation with the <code>QUIT</code> command.
</p>
<p>
The first thing to notice is that the banner and all the responses from the
mail server start with a 3-digit code. These codes tell the client whether
a command or connection has been accepted. The human-readable text in
server responses is not a significant part of the protocol, but it can be
useful when a human is following the session. The first digit indicates
success or failure. Codes starting with 2 indicate success, 3 indicates a
prompt for further data. 4 indicates a temporary rejection, such as an over
quota mailbox and 5 indicates a permanent rejection, such as a non-existent
user.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt">RFC 5321</a> now
recommends that <code>EHLO</code> (extended HELLO) should be used in
place of the original HELLO command, but servers are still required to
accept the old <code>HELO</code> command, as used in this
example. Where the extended HELLO command is used, the server may offer
a list of optional protocol extensions such as encryption (TLS) and
pipelining.
</p>
<p>
This example shows a message with a single recipient, but
the <code>RCPT TO</code> command may be repeated for messages with
multiple recipients.
</p>
<p>
Similarly more than one message can be submitted per session. After a
message has been accepted by the server, the sender can issue another
<code>MAIL FROM</code> command, instead of a <code>QUIT</code> command.
</p>
<p>
Note that the addresses in the <code>To</code> and
<code>From</code> headers can be completely different from those given
in the <code>MAIL FROM</code> and <code>RCPT TO</code> commands for a
number of reasons, including mailing lists, aliases, and bcc addresses.
</p>
</div>
<p style="display: none;">[Sidebar ends here]</p>
<hr style="display: none;">
<!-- Sidebar content ends here - Ben -->


<p>
Access control lists allow you to define rules for each stage of the SMTP
protocol [see the sidebar] and some other events for non-SMTP messages. The
configuration contains named ACLs and there are 18 different options to
connect a named ACL to specific events, e.g. the option
<code>acl_smtp_mail</code> determines which ACL is run to decide whether to
accept or reject a <code>RCPT FROM</code> command.
</p>
<p>
ACLs will typically return <code>accept</code> or <code>deny</code>, but they may also return
<code>defer</code> or <code>discard</code>. <Code>Accept</Code>
and <code>discard</code> cause a 2xx (success) response to be
returned, but <code>discard</code> will then discard the message or
recipient. <Code>Defer</Code> causes a 4xx (temporary rejection)
response and <code>deny</code> causes a 5xx (permanent rejection)
response.
</p>
<p>
An ACL will contain a list of rules, each rule consists of a verb and
a set of conditions. If the conditions match the rule is
triggered. The rules are processed in order until a rule returns an
<code>accept</code>, <code>deny</code>, or <code>defer</code>, or there
are no further rules. If there are no further rules, then there is an
implicit <code>deny</code>.
</p>
<p>
The SMTP CONNECT ACL is specified by the <code>acl_smtp_connect</code>
option. It is used to decide whether or not to accept a
connection. Normally this would not be used, as most mail
administrators don't know everybody who might want to send them
emails, so they would accept connections from anywhere. A situation
where you might want to use this would be an internal mail server that
does not connect directly to the Internet, which would accept mail
from clients on its subnet and from one or two external mail
servers. To implement this you might set
</p>
<PRE>
acl_smtp_connect = check_connection
</PRE>
<p>
in the options and
</p>
<PRE>
check connection:
    accept hosts = 192.168.53.0/24: 10.10.10.10 : 10.11.12.13 

    deny
</PRE>
<p>
in the ACL section.
</p>
<p>
This ACL starts with an <code>accept</code> verb and a condition that
the connecting host is on subnet <code>192.168.53.0/24</code>, or it is
one of 10.10.10.10 or 10.11.12.13. The only other rule is an
unconditional <code>deny</code>, so if the connecting host does not
match the given addresses the connection will be denied.
</p>
<p>
The SMTP MAIL ACL is specified by the <code>acl_smtp_mail
option</code>. It is used to decide whether or not to accept
a <code>MAIL FROM</code> command from a specified email address. This
would not be an ACL I would expect to use in normal operation, but I
did have a problem where a particular user had sent an email which
was then being resent around a thousand times per hour. We didn't want
to block any other users sending from that host, so to block just that
user we could set
</p>
<PRE>
acl_smtp_mail = check_sender
</PRE>
<p>
in the options and
</p>
<PRE>
check_sender:
    deny message = User has been blocked
         sender  = user@example.com

    accept
</PRE>
<p>
The first rule obviously denies all requests to send mail from
<code>user@example.com</code>, with the message &quot;User has been blocked&quot;
and the second rule then accepts all other senders.
</p>
<p>
In practice, maintaining a list of blocked users in the configuration
file is unwieldy. It is almost always better to maintain the list in
an external file. This can be done by changing the sender line to
</p>
<PRE>
         sender  = lsearch;/etc/mail/sender_blacklist
</PRE>
<p>
As well as file based lookups Exim can query a number of popular
databases and other data sources, such as LDAP. These are listed
in <a href="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.69/doc/html/spec_html/ch09.html">
chapter 9</a> of the manual.
</p>
<p>
The SMTP RCPT ACL is specified by the <code>acl_smtp_rcpt</code>
option. It is used to decide whether or not to accept a <code>RCPT
TO</code> command.
</p>
<p>
The following example comes from the default configuration, where it
is fully commented. I have omitted some rules that restrict addresses
containing certain characters.
</p>
<p>
Before defining the ACL we define some domain lists that are used in
the ACL.
</p>
<PRE>
domainlist local_domains = exim.example.com
domainlist relay_to_domains = 
hostlist   relay_from_hosts = 127.0.0.1

acl_smtp_rcpt = acl_check_rcpt
</PRE>
<p>
and the ACL is
</p>
<PRE>
  accept  hosts = :

  accept  local_parts   = postmaster
          domains       = +local_domains

  require verify        = sender

  accept  hosts         = +relay_from_hosts
          control       = submission

  accept  authenticated = *
          control       = submission

  require message = relay not permitted
          domains = +local_domains : +relay_to_domains

  require verify = recipient

  accept
</PRE>
</p>
<p>
The first rule accepts any email with an empty sending host
field. This supports mail from local user agents that submit messages
via pipes (standard input and output), rather than via a TCP/IP
connection. 
</p>
<p>
The second rule accepts messages to postmaster for any domain in the
domain list <code>local_domains</code>. This is a requirement of RFC
5321. 
</p>
<p>
The third rule requires that the sender address is verifiable. Sender
addresses are verified by running the routers for the address. If the
address is not routable verification fails. For advanced users it is
possible to set routing options specifically for verification.
</p>
<p>
The fourth rule accepts messages from any hosts in domain list
<code>relay_from_hosts</code>. This rule is used to allow Exim to
relay mail from other hosts, e.g. Exim may be used as a gateway to
relay email from internal mail servers that are not exposed directly
to the Internet. In this instance <code>relay_from_hosts</code> has
been left empty, so Exim will not relay mail for any other hosts.
</p>
<p>
The fifth rule accepts mail from anywhere, provided that the user is
authenticated. This would typically be used to support email from
laptops that are connected via the the Internet, rather than via the
local network.
</p>
<p>
If we do not configure Exim to accept mail authentication, this will
not accept any mail. This article will not cover authentication in
Exim. 
</p>
<p>
The sixth rule rejects any recipients that are not for either one of our
local domains or a domain for which we are configured to relay. The
<code>message</code> option on the rule sets the message that will be
returned for any recipient that is rejected by this rule.
</p>
<p>
The seventh rule rejects any recipients we can not verify. 
</p>
<p>
The final rule accepts any mail that has passed through all the
preceding checks without being accepted or rejected.
</p>
<p>
Note that where a message has multiple recipients each recipient can
be accepted or rejected separately. Only one recipient has to be
accepted for the message to be accepted. Obviously the message will
only be delivered to those recipients that were accepted.
</p>
<p>
The DATA ACL can be used to reject messages based on their contents,
e.g. to reject messages containing &quot;bad words&quot; or
&quot;naughty words&quot;, set
</p>
<PRE>
acl_smtp_data = acl_check data
</PRE>
<p>
in the options and
</p>
<PRE>
  deny message = Bad words in message
       regex   = (?i)\\w(bad|naughty)\\wwords\\w

  accept
</PRE>
<p>
The first rule uses
a <a HREF="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.69/doc/html/spec_html/ch08.html">
a regular expression</a> to detect the phrase &quot;bad words&quot; or
the phrase &quot;naughty words&quot; and rejects the message with the
message &quot;Bad words in message&quot;.
</p>
<p>
The second rule accepts all messages that have not been denied by the
first rule.
</p>
<h3>Routers</h3>
<p>
Once a message has been accepted, Exim will store the message in its
spool directory for further processing. The next processing step is
determined by the routers.
</p>
<p>
Routers process addresses. They can do 3 things with an address. The
address can be assigned to a transport for delivery, it can be
rejected, or the address can be converted into a new address (or
multiple addresses).
</p>
<p>
The configuration will contain a number of routers and they are
processed in the order in which they appear. The default configuration
defines the following 4 routers.
</p>
<PRE>
dnslookup:
  driver = dnslookup
  domains = ! +local_domains
  transport = remote_smtp
  ignore_target_hosts = 0.0.0.0 : 127.0.0.0/8
  no_more

system_aliases:
  driver = redirect
  allow_fail
  allow_defer
  data = ${lookup{$local_part}lsearch{/etc/aliases}}
  file_transport = address_file
  pipe_transport = address_pipe

userforward:
  driver = redirect
  check_local_user
  file = $home/.forward
  no_verify
  no_expn
  check_ancestor
  file_transport = address_file
  pipe_transport = address_pipe
  reply_transport = address_reply

localuser:
  driver = accept
  check_local_user
  transport = local_delivery
  cannot_route_message = Unknown user
</PRE>
<p>
These routers are fully commented in the default configuration. 
</p>
<p>
All routers start with the driver option. This specifies which Exim
code module is used to route the address.
</p>
<p>
The first router, the dnslookup router, looks for remote
deliveries. It matches any addresses whose domains are not listed in
the local_domains domain list and assigns them to the remote_smtp mail
transport. The ignore target hosts option ensures that the address
0.0.0.0 and the subnet 127.0.0.0/8 are treated as DNS lookup failures
and the no_more option ensures that they are not then passed to the
following routers, thus they are rejected as unroutable.
</p>
<p>
The second router, the system_aliases router, looks for aliases in
<code>/etc/aliases</code>, and replaces the address with the address
found in the aliases file. If the lookup does not find a match, the
router will decline the address, allowing it to be processed by the
next router.
<p>
</p>
The allow_fail and allow_defer options cause the router to fail or
defer if the lookup returns <code>:fail:</code>
or <code>:defer:</code>. The file_transport and pipe_transport options
specify the transports to use if the lookup returns a filename or a
pipe. For these purposes a filename is a string that starts with a
slash but does not end with a slash and does not parse as a valid
RFC2822 address, with a domain. A pipe is a string starting with a
vertical bar character.
</p>
<p>
The third router, the userforward router, looks
for <code>.forward</code> files in users' home directories and uses
the contents of those files to replace the address. As you would
expect, if a matching <code>.forward</code> file is not found the
router will decline the address, allowing it to be processed by the
next router.
</p>
<p>
The <code>check_local_user</code> option is used to ensure that this
router declines the address if the local part does not match a valid
user on the system, e.g. an alias. The <code>no_verify</code> option
ensures that this
router <a HREF="http://www.exim.org/exim-html-4.69/doc/html/spec_html/ch22.html#SECID125">
declines when run for address verification</a>, not delivery and
<code>no_expn</code> causes it to decline if Exim is processing
an <code>EXPN</code> command. The <code>check_ancestor</code> option
means that the forward file can not redirect to a previously
redirected address, i.e. it will break a redirection loop.
</p>
<p>
Finally the three transport options specify the transports to use for file
names, pipes, and auto-replies.
</p>
<p>
The last router attempts to deliver a message to a local user.
</p>
<h3>Transports</h3>
<p>
Transports transmit messages to a destination. Local transports
transmit messages to a file or a pipe on the local host. Remote
transports transmit messages to another host.
</p>
<p>
The default configuration defines 5 transports.
</p>
<PRE>
remote_smtp:
  driver = smtp

local_delivery:
  driver = appendfile
  file = /var/mail/$local_part
  delivery_date_add
  envelope_to_add
  return_path_add

address_pipe:
  driver = pipe
  return_output

address_file:
  driver = appendfile
  delivery_date_add
  envelope_to_add
  return_path_add

address_reply:
  driver = autoreply
</PRE>
<p>
As with routers, all transports start with the <code>driver</code>
options, which determines which Exim code module will handle the
delivery. 
</p>
<p>
The <code>remote_smtp</code> transport uses the <code>smtp</code>
driver to deliver to remote hosts using the SMTP protocol.
</p>
<p>
The <code>local_delivery</code> transport uses the <code>appendfile
driver</code> to deliver to local mailboxes in BSD mailbox
format. The <code>delivery_date_add</code>, <code>envelope_to_add</code>
and <code>return_path_add</code> options
add <code>Delivery-Date</code>, <code>Envelope-To</code>
and <code>Return-Path</code> headers. Note
that <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321.txt">RFC5321</a>
requires the <code>Return-Path</code> header for final delivery,
but <code>Delivery-Date</code> and <code>Envelope-To</code> are
non-standard.
</p>
<p>
Exim can also support mail deliveries in MBX format, Maildir format,
and mailstore format, when built with the appropriate configuration
options.
</p>
<p>
The <code>address_pipe</code> transport handles any deliveries to
pipes, when pipes are specified in aliases or <code>.forward</code>
files. The <code>return output</code> option treats any text on the
pipe's standard output as a delivery failure and returns the text to
the message sender as an error. An alternative
is <code>return_fail_output</code>, which only returns the output as
an error if the pipe returns a non-zero status code on completion.
</p>
<p>
The <code>address_file</code> transport is used to deliver to files,
when file names are specified in aliases or <code>.forward</code>
files. It is very similar to the <code>local_delivery</code>
transport, but uses the file name from the alias
or <code>.forward</code> file, instead of the user's normal mail
spool.
files
</p>
<p>
Finally, the <code>address_reply</code> transport uses
the <code>autoreply</code> driver, which generates automated replies
when required by the userforward router. It is not a <em>proper</em>
transport because it does not actually deliver the original
message. To generate an automated reply and still deliver the original
message routers calling an autoreply transport should use the unseen
option, so the message will also be processed by later routers.
</p>
<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>
This article has tried to make it clear that basic Exim configuration
is fairly simple; however, any new configuration is likely to contain
some errors and will require testing. Exim provides a whole host of
options to help you to test and debug your configuration.
</p>
<p>
The most basic test of any new configuration is a check for syntax
errors. You can run Exim with the options <code>-bv -C
/path/to/file</code> to check the basic syntax.
</p>
<p>
A fake SMTP session can be run with <code>exim -bh
ip_address</code>. This simulates an incoming message from the given
IP address, using standard input and output, standard and diagnostic
information is written to standard error. It does not deliver the
message or write to the real log files.
</p>
<p>
Addresses can be tested for deliverability using <code>exim
-bt</code>. This can combined with <code>-t sender_address</code>
if the routers use tests on the sender address.
</p>
<p>
An extremely useful option is <code>-d</code>. This will print
diagnostic information to standard error. The information to be
printed can be controlled by appending <code>+option<code>
and <code>-option</code>, e.g. <code>exim -bd -d-all+acl</code> would
provide debugging information for ACLs.
</p>
<p>
There are other options that may be used to debug particular aspects
of the configuration. These are all listed

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I hope this article has made clear that getting started with Exim is
not terribly difficult, and also made clear that more experienced Exim
administrators will find a wealth of features that can be used to
achieve a wide range of goals from spam filtering to building
applications based on automated email processing.
</p>
<p>
Although getting Exim running is easy, that is only the start. Every mail
administrator needs to be aware of their responsibilities to the wider
Internet community.  A badly set up mail server may find that it is
blacklisted for a variety of reasons. The worst offenses are relaying and
backscatter, but many sites will also blacklist servers that are on dialup
connections, have poor DNS configurations or are non-compliant with various
RFCs.
</p>
<p>
Most mail administrators will also need to have some anti-spam
measures in place such
as <a href="http://greylisting.org/articles/whitepaper.shtml">
greylisting</a> and scanning with tools
like <a href="http://www.spamassassin.org">SpamAssassin</a>.
</p>
<p>
The author would like to thank Dr. Philip Hazel and the many
contributors to Exim's code and documentation. Thanks are also due to
the many subscribers to the exim-users mailing list who have assisted
the author and others to get the best from Exim.

<p> Neil is a programmer, specialising in C++ on Unix and Linux. He has degrees
in Computer science and Next Generation Computing.

<p> Neil has worked on a wide range of systems from the control system for the
British Gas national grid to video servers for the Home Choice video on
demand service. He first programmed computers in 1980 with his school
General Studies class, which was allowed access to a mainframe at The
National Institute of Oceanography, programmed in Fortran on punch cards.

<p> A computer science degree followed at Queen Mary College, London, then Neil
worked for Logica for 3 years before taking an MSc in New Generation
Computing at Exeter University.

<p> The next 5 years saw Neil researching parallel simulation algorithms at the
Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, initially on transputers and
subsequently on SPARC based parallel systems. Since leaving RSRE, Neil has
mostly worked freelance and has worked on financial data feeds, video
servers and virus scanning proxies.

<p> Neil first used Unix at college in 1982 and started working on Linux in
1996.

<p> As of May 2004, Neil is working for Wirefast a global messaging company.

<p> Outside of computing, Neil is into motor sport, particularly Formula 1, the
World Rally Championship and the British Touring Car Championship. He
doesn't race himself. If you've seen Neil's driving, you'll understand why.
