<BR>From: Tim Moran &lt;<A HREF="mailto:tmoran@gbonline.com">tmoran@gbonline.com&gt;</A>

<P> I usually use fvwm, but sometimes I like to switch to enlightenment.
The problem was maintaining two sets of menus. So, with a little
tweaking, I now use the gnome menu editor to maintain both.

<P> Enlightenment is simple. The menu.cfg can read gnome's menus with:
<PRE>
BEGIN_NEW_GNOME_MENU("GNOME_USER_SUBMENU", "ROOT", HOME_DIR"/.gnome/apps")
ADD_MENU_TITLE("User Apps")
END_MENU
</PRE>

<P> Fvwm was a bit tricky. I probably am not using the best possible solution,
but it works for me. 

<P> I recompiled wmconfig that comes with RedHat 6.0. In wmconfig.c there
is a section that begins #if HAVE_GNOME. I changed this to read my
~/.gnome/apps directory:
<PRE>
ret = parse_gnome_files("/home/tmoran/.gnome/apps", NULL);
</PRE>

<P> Then I made a little shell script to run wmconfig and clean up
some unneeded files:

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
wmconfig --output=fvwm2 --no-sysdir --rootmenu="ROOTMENU" > .fmenu
find /home/tmoran -name .order -exec rm -f {} \;
find /home/tmoran -name .directory -exec rm -f {} \;
</PRE>


<P> Finally, my .fvwm2rc contains:

<PRE>
AddToMenu RootMenu	
+			"&amp;Rxvt"		Exec exec rxvt
+			""		Nop
Read /home/tmoran/.fmenu
AddToMenu RootMenu	
+			""		Nop
+			"&amp;Fvwm Modules"	          Popup Module-Popup
+			""		Nop
+                       "Refresh Screen"   Refresh
+			""		Nop
+			"&amp;Exit Fvwm"	Popup Quit-Verify
</PRE>

<BR>From: Csaba Feher &lt;<A HREF="mailto:csfeher@freemail.c3.hu">csfeher@freemail.c3.hu&gt;</A>

<P> Hello guys,

<P> I just make up my mind to write a short shell-script to do some fun.
It is for making funny signatures with 'fortune'. You can use it with your
mailing software that can handle signatures. I tested it with Netscape and Pine,
with a Mandrake Linux distro.

<P> You need:
<OL>
	<LI> the 'fortune' application. I think many of you have it under 
/usr/games/ (Or somewhere else, so you may edit the script if you need to.) If
not, your installation media or a close FTP mirror should have it.
	<LI> an 'sh' compatible shell...
	<LI> the script below. I call it 'sigchange'.
	<LI> a .signature file in your home directory (optional)
</OL>

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
#
# sigchange
#
# A simple shell script to get your .signature file looking more funny....  
#
# Written by Csaba Feher (csfeher@freemail.c3.hu)
#

<P> # First, if .signature exists, we just remove it, in order to start with an
empty one  
if [ -f $HOME/.signature ]; then
    rm -f $HOME/.signature
fi

<P> #Then, make some good-sounding signature with the help of 'fortune'. 
#The -s option is because of Netscape, it says that the estimated length of the
signature was 4 lines. 
#You may alter the categories to suit your needs. I prefer these two...      
    /usr/games/fortune -s linuxcookie computers &gt; $HOME/.signature 
    S=$(cat $HOME/.signature)

<P> #Take a short look at your basic signature file, 
#which you may want to appear at the end of all newly-made signature.
#Create &amp; edit as you like. But, I suggest to keep it short.   
    O=$(cat $HOME/.signature.basic)

<P> #Now put the whole stuff to the usual place
echo -e "$S\n $O" &gt; $HOME/.signature
</PRE>

<P> Usage:
<OL>
	<LI> Use the script and make it executable for everybody you want to be
able to use.
	<LI> Copy it under /bin or /usr/bin, or wherever you want to. Do not
forget to check your PATH variable, it should include the path to 'sigchange'.
	<LI> Add the following line to your system initialization script:
<PRE>
sigchange
</PRE>
This is /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit for Mandrake or Red Hat; it may be different in
other distributions. You should check and find the script that initializes and
boots up your system. The .signature will change each time you reboot your
Linux box.
	<LI> If you prefer more changes, you can add a line containing this:
<PRE>
sigchange
</PRE>
to /etc/rc.d/rc (Mandrake/Red Hat). It starts 'sigchange' each time the runlevel
changes.
	<LI> make a .signature.basic file in your home directory, or rename your
existing .signature file to it. Edit it to contain a suitable signature you want
to use at the bottom of your mails. I think you should keep it short.

</OL>

<P> Changes are made at the next reboot /runlevel change.

<P> Feel free to use and enjoy it!
Any comments are welcome!

<P> p.s.: my recent signature is made with this method...

<P>-- <BR>
But what can you do with it?  -- ubiquitous cry from Linux-user partner.<BR>

<P> I find that searching howtos is easier if you use a script. I was
inspired by another program to write a semi-smart howto script. You
use it like:

howto lilo

then finds LILO. If something is not found, it lists suggestions.

<PRE>
 	split -b1440k a_whopping_big_file chunk

<P> The required task is rather easy to be achieved if both source and

<P> Assume floppy drive is a 3.5" drive at /dev/fd0

<P> Copy to disk:

<P> Copy from disk:
<PRE>
tar -x -f /dev/fd0 -L1440K -M <File-Name>
</PRE>

<P> tar will prompt the user to enter a new disk when ever it made one full.

<P> Note:<BR>
The floppy disks will be overwritten without warning. Any old content is
lost. No useable file system is installed. The disks are treated as a
"tape" containing a set of blocks. For any later use with an operating
system (DOS, Linux) the disks need to be reformatted.

<P><STRONG><EM> Brian &lt;<A HREF="mailto:vocalist@home.com">vocalist@home.com&gt;</A>
says:</EM></STRONG>

<P>   Short explanation:
  If you use the 'split' command, you can split a file up into
chunks. Once onto a floppy, you can transport the file. When you want to
reclaim the files, you can simply copy them back to hard drive and use
'cat' to put them back together.


<P>    Long (full) explanation:
   I have a 292529 byte file named lasg-0-0-9.pdf on my hard drive, and
I want to save it in chunks (or less) so I can put it on floppy for
saving...
   You can see that no chunk is larger than 1K, as specified by the -C1k
option to 'split'. The second option un this example is the name of the
original file, and the third option in this example is the name of the
output file prefix.
  The prefix is followed up by a unique string which ensures that when
concatenated in a sorted order that you get the same file back. I tested
this with the command 

<PRE>
cat lasg-0-0-9.pdg[a-z][a-z]* &gt; tmp.lasg-0-0-9.pdf 
</PRE>

and the resulting file tmp.lasg-0-0-9.pdf was
identical to the original file.

<P><STRONG><EM> Jimmy O'Regan &lt;<A HREF="mailto:joeregan@tinet.ie">joeregan@tinet.ie&gt;</A>
chimes in:</EM></STRONG>

<P>You can find out more by typing "man split" or "info split".

<P> But in your case you'd probably want to try

<PRE>
$ split -b 1380k your.file your.file.
</PRE>

So it'll split the file "your.file" into files of 1.38m in size (ideal for
floppies), named your.file.aa, your.file.ab and your.file.ac (etc if you use
a different size).

<P> You can rejoin them with
<PRE>
$ cat your.file.aa your.file.ab your.file.ac &amp; your.file
</PRE>

<P> J.


<P><STRONG><EM>Remco Schellekens &lt;<A HREF=mailto:merty@xs4all.nl>merty@xs4all.nl&gt;</A>
suggests:</EM></STRONG>

<P> dd will do the trick.

<P> Use it in the form:

<PRE>
dd if=your-input-file of=first-out-file skip=0 count=2840
dd if=your-input-file of=second-out-file skip=2840 count=2840
dd if=your-input-file of=third-out-file skip=5680 count=2840
</PRE>

...and so on.

<P> Assuming blocksizes are 512 bytes, so the count of 2840 is approx. 1.4 Mb
To get the file back just use cat command:

<PRE>
cat first-out-file &gt; your-file
cat second-out-file &gt;&gt; your-file
</PRE>

... and so on

<P> of course it will be a bit easier if you make a shell script of it.

<P> Thats it.


<P><STRONG><EM>Roland Smith &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rsmith@xs4all.nl">rsmith@xs4all.nl&gt;</A>
also suggests:</EM></STRONG>

<P> 3) Zip the file and use zipsplit to split it into files that will fit
on a floppy.

<P> Hope this helps.

<P> I would like to thank each and every person who responded to my question
about using gimp with the subject disk.  The problem was that when I put the
images on the HD (using Mcopy, since the Kodak(c) Picture Disk is a DOS/'doze
thingee), they were upside-down (and I later found *were* left to right), and
that I couldn't figure out how gimp worked.  I use RH 5.1.

<P> One of the replies suggested I try 'xv', so I looked in my RH5.1 manual,
and found on page 6 that it had been replaced.  I checked out my 5.1 CD (I
bought the 'official box') and guess what...it's there!  I tried it and it not
only flipped the images 'rightsideup', but can also flip 'em right-to-left, and
much more.  Now here's the kicker: about two weeks ago I put another roll of
film in and requested the disk when it was processed.  When I got the pix and
disk back, I stuffed the disk into FRED and called up 'xv' so that I could flip
the pix again.

<P> They were all set up correctly on the disk!  I didn't have to do anything
with them.  Do you think maybe someone from Kodak reads <I>Linux Gazette</I>, too?

<BR><BR>From: Jim Bradley -- Maryville, MO USA &lt;<A HREF="mailto:twise@jbradley@msc.net">jbradley@msc.net&gt;</A>

<P> I have my laptop configured to plug into the network of my employer. At
home, I plug my laptop into my home network, and dial out from another
machine setup for dial on demand. Unfortunately, if it takes forever waiting
for the two timeouts when trying to connect to the employer's DNS servers
from home, and if I change the DNS order, it takes just as long for the
timeout error when attempting to connect to my ISP's DNS from my employer's
network. Is there an easy way to change the DNS servers when needed? It's
easy enough to change IP addresses with the ifconfig command, is there a
similar means for changing the DNS? Or, should I just bite the bullet and
setup BIND on the laptop?

<P> My apologies if it doesn't - I've made enough changes to my setup that I
could have automated it myself.  I don't keep multiple copies of
/etc/resolv.conf yet get the correct DNS server.  I know for certain that
DHCP makes the update.

<P> The only change I _remember_ making that's related to this is I generate the
hosts file at bootup, since the only thing I keep in my hosts file is
localhost and the hostname.  Primarily because the long hostname can change
based on which network I'm connected to (or even not connected at all).

<P> Ted

<P><STRONG><EM>C Ted Wise &lt;twise@jamesmartin.com&gt; replies:</EM>
</STRONG>

<P> Your DNS server(s) are defined in the /etc/resolv.conf file.  If you're
using DHCP or PPP, this should be updated automagically with the correct
server.  If you're defining everything by hand, you'll need to modify this
file to reflect the correct DNS server.  Changes to the file may not be
reflected in already running programs (daemons).

<P> If you're not running a DHCP server on your home network, consider one, it
will greatly ease the pain of moving the laptop between locations.

<P><STRONG><EM>The </EM>Linux Gazette<EM> Editor writes to Ted:</EM>
</STRONG>

<P> Since when did Linux PPP start automagically updating the DNS server?
Windows does this, but in my experience Linux does not.  You have to have
several /etc/resolv.conf files, and use a symbolic link to point to the

<P> I've been using the KPPP dialer under KDE and that one definitely makes
changes to the /etc/resolv.conf file.  When it makes a connection, it
modifies the file - commenting out the existing lines and adding ones
applicable to the PPP connection.  When you exit the application, it
restores the original file.

<P> From the comments in the file, it looks to be behavior specific to KPPP.
This is where my confusion came in.  My home server is running DNS and masqs
through to the PPP interface so the /etc/resolv.conf file doesn't change
based on the PPP connection.  It's only my laptop that needs this and I was
making the assumption (I know, I know) that KPPP was just a pretty face on
PPPD.

<P> i use the SCHEMES facility of the PCMCIA package to solve a related
problem: how to use a laptop in two LANs with different IP addresses,
different domains, and (naturally) different DNS servers.

<P> Basically you set up a file /etc/pcmcia/network.opts
which contains all network options, esp. something like 

<PRE>
case "$ADDRESS" in
home,*,*,*)
[snip]
    SEARCH="domain.com"
    DNS_1="1.2.3.4"
    DNS_2=""
    DNS_3=""
[snip]
    ;;
work,*,*,*)
[snip]
    SEARCH="work.com"
    DNS_1="5.6.7.8"
    DNS_2=""
    DNS_3=""
[snip]
</PRE>


<P> Then, when booting with lilo you can append SCHEME=home or SCHEME=work,
or better write this into /etc/lilo.conf directly. and type 'home'
or 'work' at the lilo prompt.


<P> The whole procedure is described in detail here:
<A HREF=http://www.suse.de/sdb/en/html/ke_pcmcia-scheme.html>

1. It is _not_ down to the BIOS. You can just give the geometry as arguments
to 'fdisk'

2. Do not trust the information from the maker of the disk. I installed a 10
GB IBM disk. The geometry printed on the disk and shown on IBM's web-side was
identical to the geometry of their 8GB disk. I think they rely on special software to make it
work on Windows.
I assumed sectors and # of heads were correct and computed # of cylinders from 
the capacity and fed it to cfdisk. It works.

<P> Someone more knowledgeable than I could probably tell you the exact
differences between Suse and Red Hat. There is more activity on Red Hat.

<P> A more important question  is, "What Distribution are people around you
using?"

<P> Unix/Linux is not too hard to learn - but it is different than windows.
Try to find a User's group and/or computer store that has Linux around
and then you can see it and talk to people.  I liked the book "Life with
Unix" to give a good grounding on what to expect.  The O'Reilly books
are invaluable.  I also like the printed collections of the Linux
Documentation project containing the System's Administrator's Guide and
the Network Administrators Guide and the How-tos.

<P> I used to the idea of a dual boot system - so you can use either Linux
or Win xx, but not at the same time.  This works for a while.  The
drawback is that you cannot use both at the same time.  The best order
of events (briefly) is 1) partition, 2) install Winxx 3) install Linux
and Lilo.

<P> Two machines are better yet. With a small LAN you can then telnet or use
an X-windowing program to use both machines - This is what I do now.
Several X-server programs exist for Windows.  Hummingbird's Exceed,
Reflection's X-windows suite,  and StarNet's (x-win32) are three good
ones and I have used all three.

<P> I have heard some use of  virtual machines (vmware makes one) in which
you can use two operating systems at the same time on the same machine -
but I have not tried it.

<P> After reading the documentation  you can mount a FAT partition from
Linux and use it as a way to transfer data back and forth between
machines.  If you have two machines the network takes care of the file
transfers.  Remember that a Unix/Linux text file has only linefeeds and
a PC-DOS text file has Carriage return and Linefeed.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<P> I'm not sure if this will help, but here goes...

<P> An annoying thing about C++ is that templated classes require that both
the declaration and the implementation be in the same file.  Instead of
actually putting both in one file, often the header file will have the
line:

<PRE>
#include "class.cc"  // or whatever the implementaion file is called
</PRE>

 near the end of the file (after the declaration of the class).  In this
case though, the implementation usually goes in a file called
"class.template" and #include "class.template" will be put in "class.h"
somewhere near the end of the file (after the complete declaration of the
file).

<P> Also, don't forget to guard your class from multiple include-ing by
putting something like this as the first two lines:

<PRE>
#ifndef MYCLASS_H
#define MYCLASS_H
</PRE>

and something like this as the last line:

<PRE>
#endif // MYCLASS_H
</PRE>

<P> Anyway, if you have the implementation and declaration in separate files,
and you don't have this yet, than this may be your problem.  Assuming this
will fix your problem and you have a "main.cc" and templated "class.h" and 
"class.cc", you should be able to compile with:

<PRE>
g++ -I. main.cc
</PRE>

<P> (of course assuming main.cc has #include "class.h").

<P> Tell me if this helps...
