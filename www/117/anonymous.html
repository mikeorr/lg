<h1>Audiobooks Galore</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</A></b></p>

<p>

<p> This article is a follow-up to <a href="../114/john.html">Maxin B.
John's article</a>, which introduced us to the <a
href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/downloads/festival/">Festival</a>
text-to-speech synthesizer and some possible applications. Here, we will
push it a bit further and see how we can convert ebooks from the most
common formats like HTML, CHM, PS and PDF into audiobooks ready to send to
your portable player.</p>

<h3>The Why</h3>
<p> With the high availability of cheap and small portable MP3 players
these days, it has become very convenient to listen to books and
articles just anywhere when you would not necessarily have the time
to read them. Audiobooks usually require very small bit-rates, and hence
very small sizes - and as a consequence they are the most suitable content
for the cheap/small capacity MP3 players (128 MB or less).</p>

<p> There are lots of websites out there catering for audiobooks
needs with a wide range of choices. However, it might happen that you
really want to read that article or book that you found on the
web as a PDF or as HTML, and there is probably no audio version of it
available (yet). I will provide you with some scripts that will
enable you to convert all your favorite texts into compressed audio
files ready to upload and enjoy on your portable player. Here we go!</p>

<h3>The Tools</h3>
<dl>
	<dd><a href="http://archmage.sourceforge.net/">archmage</a> (CHM)
	requires also <a href="http://www.python.org">python</a></dd>
	<dd>ps2ascii (PS and PDF) from the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">ghostscript</a>-library
	package</dd>
	<dd><a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a></dd>
	<dd>text2wave from <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/downloads/festival/">Festival</a>
	</dd>
	<dd>the <a href="http://www.mp3dev.org/">lame</a> MP3 encoder
	(we'll encode to MP3 since this is the most widely-supported format
	in hardware players)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Most of these tools are packaged in the main Linux distributions. Once you
have all of the above installed, we can start the fun. We will begin with
one of the most common format for ebooks: Adobe PDF.</p>


<h3>Postcript / Adobe PDF to MP3</h3>
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh -

chunks=200

if [ "$#" == 0 ]; then
        echo "Usage:  $0 [-a author] [-t title] [-l lines] &lt;ps or pdf file&gt;"
        exit 1
fi

while getopts "a:t:l:" option
do
case "$option" in
        a)author="$OPTARG";;
        t)title="$OPTARG";;
        l)chunks="$OPTARG";;
esac
done
shift $((OPTIND-1))

ps2ascii $@ | split -l $chunks - tmpsplit
count=1
for i in `ls tmpsplit*`
do
        text2wave $i | lame --ta "${author:-psmp3}" --tt "$count ${title:-psmp3}" \
		--tl "${title:-psmp3}" --tn "$count" --tg Speech --preset mw-us   \
		- abook${count}.mp3
        count=`expr $count + 1`
done
rm tmpsplit*
</pre>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p> First 'ps2ascii' converts the PDF file or Postscript file to simple
text.  That text is then split into chunks of <i>$chunks</i> lines; you
might have to tweak that value, since splitting the book into more than 255
files might cause troubles in some players (the id3v1 track number tag can
only go up to 255.) After that, each chunk is processed by text2wave and
the resulting audio stream is sent directly to 'lame' through a pipe. The
encoding is performed with the <code>mw-us</code> preset, which is mono ABR
40 kbps average at 16 kHz. That should be enough, since Festival outputs a
voice sampled at 16 kHz by default. You can leave it as it is, unless you
are using a voice synthesizer with a different sampling rate. Refer to
<i>lame --preset help</i> for optimum settings for different sampling
rates.</p>

<p> When you input the artist or title, do not forget to quote the string
if it includes spaces; for example:</p>

<pre>
ps2mp3 -a "This is the author" -t "This is the title" my.pdf
</pre>

<p> Next, we are going to see how to convert to an audio file from the most
common format: HTML.</p>

<h3>HTML to MP3</h3>
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh -
#requires lynx, festival and lame

if [ "$#" == 0 ]; then
        echo "Usage: echo $0 [-a author] [-t title] &lt;html file1&gt; &lt;html file2&gt; ..."
        exit 1
fi

while getopts "a:t:" option
do
case "$option" in
        a)author="$OPTARG";;
        t)title="$OPTARG";;
esac
done
shift $((OPTIND-1))

count=1
for htmlfile in $@
do
        section=`expr match "${htmlfile##*/}" '\(.*\)\.htm'`
        lynx -dump -nolist $htmlfile | text2wave - | lame --ta "${author:-html2mp3}" \
		--tt "$count. ${section:-html2mp3}" --tl "${title:-html2mp3}"        \
		--tn "$count" --tg Speech --preset mw-us - ${section}.mp3
        #rm /tmp/est_*
        count=`expr $count + 1`
done
</pre>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p> The first part of the script, up to line 16, is about extracting the
optional parameters from the command line.  From line 19 we are going to
perform a loop on the list of all HTML files, the remaining arguments given
at the command line. On line 21, "${htmlfile##*/}" strips out everything
up to and including the last "/" character - useful if we are dealing with URLs or
a directory path - so only the filename remains. Then the '\(.*\)\.htm'`
regular expression takes care of the extension of the file so the variable
<i>section</i> holds only the stem of the file. It will be used to tag and
name the resulting MP3 files.</p>

<p> Line 22 is really the heart of the script: first, 'lynx' takes an HTML
file as input and dumps its text to stdout. That output is piped to
'text2wave' and converted into a WAV-encoded stream, which is then piped to
'lame' to be encoded with the <code>mw-us</code> preset and id3-tagged with
the artist/title/speech genre.</p>

<p> Note that the script can also take URLs as arguments, since they are
directly sent to lynx.</p>

<p> This <code>html2mp3</code> script is going to be
very useful for our next step, which is converting from CHM to MP3.
</p>

<p> CHM files are a proprietary format developed by Microsoft, but
basically they are just compiled HTML files with an index and a table of
contents in one file. Their use as an ebook format is certainly not as
widespread as HTML or PDF, but as you will see, it is pretty
straightforward to convert them to audio files once you have the right
tools.  </p>

<h3>CHM to MP3</h3>
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh -
#requires archmage and html2mp3

if [ "$#" == 0 ]; then
echo "Usage:"
echo "        $0 &lt;chm file&gt; [-a author] [-t title] &lt;html file1&gt; &lt;html file2&gt; ..."
exit 1
fi

while getopts "a:t:" o
do
case "$o" in
        a)author="$OPTARG";;
        t)title="$OPTARG";;
esac
done
shift $((OPTIND-1))

archmage $1 tmpchm
find tmpchm -name "*.htm*" -exec html2mp3 -a "$author" -t "$title" {} \;

rm -fr tmpchm
</pre>

<h4>How it works</h4>
<p> <code>archmage</code> is a Python-based script that extracts HTML files from
CHM. You will need to have Python installed to get it to run.</p>

<p> Unlike 'ps2mp3', 'chm2mp3' does not require an arbitrary decision on
where to split the book: every page compiled into the CHM file becomes its
own audio file. All we need to do is extract these pages with 'archmage'
and convert them with 'html2mp3'.</p>

<p> We are using the <i>find</i> command to recursively search for HTML
files in the CHM book that we extracted, since sometimes the HTML files are
stored in subdirectories inside the CHM. Then, for each HTML file found, we
call 'html2mp3'.</p>

<h3>Timing</h3>
<p> Remember that it can take a while to encode several dozen
pages of text to speech and then to MP3. But you do not need to encode a
full book to start uploading and enjoying it on your portable player.</p>
