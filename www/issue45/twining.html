In the past months Linux has gained momentum in corporate acceptance.
Recent announcements by IBM, Netscape, Oracle, Sun and others have
triggered a new degree of recognition for Linux. However, many major
corporations may have been using Linux without fanfare, as we are in
the offices of a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC).
<p>
Our project involves producing application program interfaces used by
UNIX applications company wide. The developers were all initially
supplied with PC_compatible workstations with MS Windows 95 or NT. On
each machine was installed one of two commercial communications
packages. Developers could request an X server (optional with one of
the communication packages).
<p>
Before I became involved in the project, at least two developers had
installed Linux in lieu of NT. As a Linux advocate, I was
delighted at the acceptance of Linux in a corporate setting. I had
met with only rare success in convincing other shops to use Linux
on the desktop. At this RBOC, I found a willingness to allow innovation
on the developers desktop. I wasted little time installing Linux on my
desktop machine.
<p>
It was more convenient for me to retain NT in order to support users
of some Windows-based applications. <b>Hint:</b>  Be sure you know
what you are doing before attempting to make NT part of a multiple
operating system scheme. It is not particularly difficult to
accomplish, but it is not at all intuitive.
<p>
One of the greatest benefits we enjoy as Linux users is X11. The
various X servers in use on Linux were uniformly more stable, more
complete and offered better performance than the NT-based X11
servers. While I found one of the Windows-based X servers acceptable
on NT, it did not perform as well as either of those I tried on Linux
(on the same machine).
<p>
The built-in support for NFS was another big plus. When we received
distribution media for software, I could mount the CD on my drive and
all the UNIX/Linux-based computers in the project could install
without a need to keep track of who had the CD last. This was
particularly helpful for installing software on our HP server. This
machine is in another building and I do not have ready access to it. Thus,
mounting a CD as an NFS volume was an important capability.
<p>
The Linux users installed Netscape Communicator, giving us a
familiar and easily configured communications suite. (We had already
been licensed and using it on MS Windows.)
<p>
The biggest benefit for me, as a UNIX system administrator and Perl
programmer, is the ability to write and test programs locally. Some of
my programs have the potential for bad side-effects. If tested on our
HP server, my team members could be (and I'm afraid have been) adversely
affected. With Linux on my desktop, I have a dual opportunity. First,
I can write and test programs on my desktop machine. If I
accidentally make the root directory permissions ``drwxr--r--'' (which I
once did when invoking a poorly written Makefile), only I am unable to
use my machine, rather than 20 users being locked out. Second, I
am motivated to make my programs more adaptive by making sure they
will run in the BSD-like Linux environment as well as the SVR4 worlds
of HP-UX and Solaris.
<p>
Our team presently has Linux installed on four PCs with two others as
likely prospects. We also have it installed on three Sun Ultra 5
desktop machines. Linux performance (particularly X11) is
breathtaking on the Ultra 5. Several people on our project and
neighboring projects have installed Linux on their home PCs after
seeing it the workplace. For these people, learning UNIX has
accelerated markedly.
<p>
The accelerated UNIX acclimatization is a plus for the company. Any
company involved in migration from legacy systems to a UNIX platform
will have a significant cost in retraining. We saw people learning UNIX
at an accelerated pace after becoming Linux enthusiasts. This certainly
appeared to be a productivity boost and training cost reduction.
<p>
If your company could benefit from having UNIX workstations on
employee's desks, look at the low cost of entry into Linux. All it takes
is a PC (you've probably already got that) and a Linux distribution (not
very expensive). Make life better where you are--get Linux.
