<p>procmail is the mail processing utility language
	written by 
<a href="mailto:berg@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de">Stephen van den Berg</a> 
        of Germany.  This article provides a bit of background for
	the intermediate Unix user on how to use procmail.</p>

<p>As a &quot;little&quot; language (to use the academic term)
	procmail lacks many of the features and constructs
	of traditional, general-purpose languages.  It has
	no &quot;while&quot; or &quot;for&quot; loops.  However it &quot;knows&quot;
	a lot about Unix mail delivery conventions and 
	file/directory permissions -- and in particular 
	about file locking.</p>

<p>Although it is possible to write a custom mail
	filtering script in any programming language
	using the facilities installed on most Unix
	systems -- we'll show that procmail is the tool
	of choice among sysadmins and advanced Unix 
	users.</p>

<p>Unix mail systems consist of MTA's (mail 
	transport agents like sendmail, smail, qmail
	mmdf etc), MDA's (delivery agents like
	sendmail, deliver, and procmail), and MUA's
	(user agents like elm, pine, /bin/mail, mh,
	Eudora, and Pegasus).</p>

<p>On most Unix systems on the Internet sendmail
	is used as an integrated transport and delivery
	agent.  sendmail and compatible MTA's have the 
	ability to dispatch mail *<strong>through</strong>* a 
	custom filter or program through either of 
	two mechanisms: aliases and <tt>.forwards</tt>.  </p>
	
<p>The aliases mechanism uses a single file
	(usually <tt>/etc/aliases</tt> or <tt>/usr/lib/aliases</tt>)
	to redirect mail.  This file is owned and 
	maintained by the system administrator.
	Therefore you (as a user) can't modify it.</p>

<p>The &quot;<tt>.forward</tt>&quot; mechanism is decentralized.
	Each user on a system can create a file
	in their home directory named <tt>.forward</tt>
	and consisting of an address, a filename,
	or a program (filter).  Usually the file 
	*<strong>must</strong>* be owned by the user or root and 
	*<strong>must not</strong>* be &quot;writeable&quot; by other users 
	(good versions of sendmail check these factors 
	for security reasons).</p>
	
<p>It's also possible, with some versions of 
	sendmail, for you to specify multiple addresses,
	programs, or files, separated with commas.  However
	we'll skip the details of that.</p>

<p>You could forward your mail through any 
	arbitrary program with a <tt>.forward</tt> that consisted
	of a line like:</p>

<blockquote><code>"|$HOME/bin/your.program -and some arguments"
	</code></blockquote>

<p>Note the quotes and the &quot;pipe&quot; character. They are
	required.</p>

<p>&quot;Your.program&quot; could be a Bourne shell script,
	an awk or perl script, a compiled C program or 
	any other sort of filter you wanted to write.</p>

<p>However &quot;your.program&quot; would have to be written to 
	handle a plethora of details about how sendmail would 
	pass the messages (headers and body) to it, how you would 
	return values to sendmail, how you'd handle file locking 
	(in case mail came in while &quot;your.program&quot; was still 
	processing one, etc).  </p>

<p>That's what procmail gives us.</p>

<p>What I've discussed so far is the general information
	that applies to all sendmail compatible MTA/MDA's.</p>

<p>So, to ensure that mail is passed to procmail for 
	processing the first step is to create the .forward
	file.  (This is safe to do before you do any configuration
	of procmail itself -- assuming that the package's binaries
	are installed).  Here's the canonical example, pasted from
	the procmail man pages:</p>

<blockquote><code>"|IFS=' '&amp;&amp;exec /usr/local/bin/procmail -f-||exit 
							75 #YOUR_USERNAME"
	</code></blockquote>

<p>This seems awfully complicated compared to my
	earlier example.  That's because my example was
	flawed for simplicity's sake.</p>

<p>What this mess means to sendmail (paraphrasing into
	English) is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Pipe the mail to the following command(s):

	<li>Set the shell's &quot;inter-field seperator&quot; (<tt>IFS</tt>) 
		to a space, and -- if that went O.K. (<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>) execute
		the program named &quot;<tt>/usr/local/bin/procmail</tt>&quot;

		<br>(yours may need to be different -- try the 
		command '<tt>which procmail</tt>' to see if it's
		on the path or '<tt>locate procmail</tt>' if your 
		system maintains a file locator database).

	<li>The procmail program is being passed a 
		set of switches: &quot;<tt>-f-</tt>&quot; which tells it to
		&quot;update timestamp in the leading the 'From'
		line in the header&quot;

		<br>(this last bit is rather obscure and has
		to do with how messages are normally 
		stored in your &quot;incoming&quot; or mail file
		or &quot;spool&quot; as we Unix hacks like to call it).

	<li>The next part of this <tt>.forward</tt> command is
		the Bourne shell's &quot;<tt>||</tt>&quot; operator which is
		basically a continuation from the &quot;and&quot; 
		(<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>) operator that we used before.  It
		says &quot;or&quot; (if that command didn't work --
		i.e. it returned any error) then &quot;<tt>exit</tt>&quot;
		(stop processing) and return an error
		number <tt>75</tt> (which we presume is meaningful
		to sendmail -- the program that called
		this command).

	<li>The last part of this <tt>.forward</tt> expression
		is a comment which according to the man
		pages:

<blockquote>&quot;<em>is not actually a parameter that is required by 
	procmail,  in fact, it will be discarded by sh before procmail
	     ever sees it; it is however  a  necessary  kludge  against
	     overoptimising sendmail programs:</em>&quot;</blockquote><br>

	<li>You should just change the phrase YOUR_NAME
		to your login name on that system.
</ul>

<p>This complicated line can be just pasted into most
	<tt>.forward</tt> files, minimally edited and forgotten.</p>

<p>If you did this and nothing else your mail would
	basically be unaffected.  procmail would just 
	look for its default recipe file (<tt>.procmailrc</tt>) and
	finding none -- it would perform its default action
	on each messages.  In other words it would append new 
	messages into your normal spool file.</p>

<p>If your ISP uses procmail as its local delivery
	agent then you can skip the whole part of about
	using the <tt>.forward</tt> file -- or you can use it anyway.</p>

<p>In either event the next step to automating your
	mail handling is to create a <tt>.procmailrc</tt> file in 
	your home directory.  You could actually call 
	this file anything you wanted -- but then you'd
	have to slip the name explicitly into the <tt>.forward</tt>
	file (right before the &quot;<tt>||</tt>&quot; operator).  Almost 
	everyone just uses the default.</p>

<p>Now we can get to a specific example.  So far all
	we've talked about it how everything gets routed
	to procmail -- which mostly involves sendmail and 
	the Bourne shell's syntax.  Almost all sendmail's
	are configured to use <tt>/bin/sh</tt> (the Bourne shell)
	to interpret alias and <tt>.forward</tt> &quot;pipes.&quot;</p>

<p>So, here's a very simple <tt>.procmailrc</tt> file:</p>

<blockquote><code>:0c:
	<br>$HOME/mail.backup
	</code></blockquote>

<p>This just appends an extra copy of all incoming 
	mail to a file named &quot;<tt>mail.backup</tt>&quot; in your 
	home directory.</p>

<p>Note that a bunch of environment variables are preset
	for you.  It's been suggested that you should
	explicity set <tt>SHELL=/bin/sh</tt> (or the closest 
	derivative to Bourne Shell available on your system).
	I've never had to worry about that since the shells
	I use on most systems are already Bourne compatible.</p>
		
<p>However, <tt>csh</tt> and other shell users should take note
	that all of the procmail recipe examples that I've 
	ever seen use Bourne syntax. </p>

<p>The <tt>:0</tt> line marks the beginning of a &quot;recipe&quot;
	(procedure, clause, whatever.  <tt>:0</tt> can be followed
	be any of a number of &quot;flags.&quot;  There is a literally
	dizzying number of ways to combine these flags.  The
	one flag we're using in this example is '<tt>c</tt>' for 
	&quot;copy.&quot;  </p>

<p>You might ask why the recipe starts with a <tt>:0</tt>.
	Historically you used to use <tt>:x</tt> (where x was a
	number).  This was a hint to procmail that the 
	next x lines were conditions for this recipe.  Later,
	the option was added to precede conditions with a 
	leading asterisk -- so they didn't have to be manually
	counted.  <tt>:0</tt> then came to mean something like: 
	&quot;count them yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>The second colon on this line marks the end of 
	the flags and the beginning of the name for a 
	lockfile.  Since no name is given procmail will
	pick one automatically.</p>

<p>This bit is a little complicated.  Mail might arrive
	in bursts.  If a new message arrives while your script
	is still busy processing the last message -- you'll
	have multiple sendmail processes.  Each will be dealing
	with one message.  This isn't a problem by itself.
	However -- if the two processes might try to write
	into one file at the same time they are likely to 
	get jumbled in unpredictable ways (the result will 
	not be a properly formatted mail folder).  </p>

<p>So we hint to procmail that it will need the check
	for and create a lockfile.  In this particular case
	we don't care what the name of the lock file would 
	be (since we're not going to have *other* programs
	writing into the backup file).  So we leave the 
	last field (after the colon) blank.  procmail will
	then select its own lockfile name.</p>

<p>If we leave the <tt>:</tt> off of the recipe header line 
	(ommitting the last field entirely) then no lockfile 
	is used.  </p>

<p>This is appropriate whenever we intend to only 
	read from the files in the recipe -- or in cases 
	where we intend to only write short, single line
	entries to a file in no particular order (like
	log file entries).</p>

<p>The way procmail works is: </p>

<p>It receives a single message from sendmail
	(or some sendmail compatible MTA/MDA).  There
	may be several procmail processing running 
	currently since new messages may be coming 
	in faster than they are being processed.</p>

<p>It opens its recipe file (<tt>.procmailrc</tt> by default
	or specified on its command line) and parses
	each recipe from the first to the last
	until a message has been &quot;delivered&quot; (or 
	&quot;disposed of&quot; as the case may be).  </p>

<p>Any recipe can be a &quot;disposition&quot; or &quot;delivery&quot; 
	of the message.  As soon as a message is 
	&quot;delivered&quot; then procmail closes its files, removes 
	its locks and exits.</p>

<p>If procmail reaches the end of it's rc file
	(and thus all of the INCLUDE'd files) without
	&quot;disposing&quot; of the message -- than the message
	is appended to your spool file (which looks
	like a normal delivery to you and all of your
	&quot;mail user agents&quot; like Eudora, <tt>elm</tt>, etc).</p>

<p>This explains why procmail is so forgiving
	if you have *<strong>no</strong>* <tt>.procmailrc</tt>.  It simply
	delivers your message to the spool because
	it has reached the end of all its recipes
	(there were none).</p>

<p>The '<tt>c</tt>' flag causes a recipe to work on a &quot;copy&quot;
	of the message -- meaning that any actions
	taken by that recipe are not considered to be
	&quot;dispositions&quot; of the message.  </p>

<p>Without the '<tt>c</tt>' flag this recipe would catch 
	all incoming messages, and all your mail would 
	end up in mail.backup.  None of it would get 
	into your spool file and none of the other recipes 
	would be parsed.</p>

<p>The next line in this sample recipe is simply
	a filename.  Like sendmail's aliases and <tt>.forward</tt>
	files -- procmail recognizes three sorts of 
	disposition to any message.  You can append it 
	to a file, forward it to some other mail address,
	or filter it through a program.  </p>

<p>Actually there is one special form of &quot;delivery&quot; 
	or &quot;disposition&quot; that procmail handles.  If you
	provide it with a directory name (rather than a
	filename) it will add the message to that directory
	as a separate file.  The name of that file will be
	based on several rather complicated factors that
	you don't have to worry about unless you use
	the Rand MH system, or some other relatively 
	obscure and &quot;exotic&quot; mail agent.</p>

<p>A procmail recipe generally consists of three
	parts -- a start line (<tt>:0</tt> with some flags) some
	conditions (lines starting with a '<tt>*</tt>' -- asterisk --
	character) and one &quot;delivery&quot; line which can be 
	file/directory name or a line starting with a '<tt>!</tt>' --
	bang -- character or a '<tt>|</tt>' -- pipe character.</p>

<p>Here's another example:</p>

<blockquote><code>:0
		<br>* ^From.*someone.i.dont.like@somewhere.org
		<br>/dev/null
		</code></blockquote>

<p>This is a simple one consisting of no flags,
	one condition and a simple file delivery.  It simply
	throws away any mail from &quot;someone I don't like.&quot;
	(<tt>/dev/null</tt> under Unix is a &quot;bit bucket&quot; -- a bottomless
	well for tossing unwanted output DOS has a similar
	concept but it's not nearly as handy).</p>

<p>Here's a more complex one:</p>

<blockquote><code>:0
		<br>* !^FROM_DAEMON 
		<br>* !^FROM_MAILER
		<br>* !^X-Loop: myaddress@myhost.mydomain.org
		<br>| $HOME/bin/my.script
		</code></blockquote>

<p>This consists of a set of negative conditions (notice
	that the conditions all start with the '<tt>!</tt>' character).
	This means: for any mail that didn't come from a
	&quot;<em>daemon</em>&quot; (some automated process) and didn't come 
	a &quot;<em>mailer</em>&quot; (some other automated process) and which
	doesn't contain any header line of the form:
	&quot;<tt>X-Loop: myadd</tt>...&quot; send it through the script in
	my bin directory.</p>

<p>I can put the script directly in the rc file
	(which is what most procmail users do most of the 
	time).  This script might do anything to the mail.
	In this case -- whatever it does had better be good
	because procmail way will consider any such mail
	to be delivered and any recipes after this will
	only be reached by mail from <tt>DAEMON</tt>s, <tt>MAILER</tt>s
	and any mail with that particular <tt>X-Loop:</tt> line 
	in the header.</p>

<p>These two particular <tt>FROM_</tt> conditions are actually
	&quot;special.&quot; They are preset by procmail and actually
	refer to a couple of rather complicated regular
	expressions that are tailored to match the sorts of
	things that are found in the headers of most mail
	from daemons and mailers.</p>

<p>The <tt>X-Loop:</tt> line is a normal procmail condition.
	In the RFC822 document (which defines what e-mail
	headers should look like on the Internet) any line
	started with <tt>X-</tt> is a &quot;custom&quot; header.  This means
	that any mail program that wants to can add pretty
	much any <tt>X-</tt> line it wants.</p>

<p>A common procmail idiom is to add an <tt>X-Loop:</tt> line
	to the header of any message that we send out --
	and to check for our own <tt>X-Loop:</tt> line before
	sending out anything.  This is to protect against
	&quot;mail loops&quot; -- situations where our mail gets
	forwarded or &quot;bounced&quot; back to us and we endlessly
	respond to it.</p>

<p>So, here's a detailed example of how to 
	use procmail to automatically respond to mail
	from a particular person.  We start with
	the recipe header.</p>

<blockquote><code>:0
		</code></blockquote>

<p>... then we add our one condition (that the mail
	appears to be from the person in question):</p>

<blockquote><code>* ^FROMharasser@spamhome.com
		</code></blockquote>

<p><tt>FROM</tt> is a &quot;magic&quot; value for procmail -- it checks
	from, resent-by, and similar header lines. You could
	also use <tt>^From:</tt> -- which would only match the header
	line(s) that start with the string &quot;<tt>From:</tt>&quot;</p>

<p>The <tt>^</tt> (hiccup or, more technically &quot;caret&quot;) 
	<!-- Actually, at the top of a line or over a letter it
		is a circumflex; at the bottom of a line as used
		in mathematics it is a caret.  Here it is
		neither a diacritical mark nor mathematical.
		Call it whatever you want. -->
	is a &quot;regular expression anchor&quot; (a techie phrase that 
	means &quot;it specifies *<strong>where</strong>* the pattern must be
	found in order to match.&quot;  There is a whole book 
	on regular expression (O'Reilly &amp; Associates). 
	&quot;regexes&quot; permeate many Unix utilities, scripting
	languages, and other programs.  There are slight
	differences in &quot;regex&quot; syntax for each application.
	However the man page for '<tt>grep</tt>' or '<tt>egrep</tt>' is an
	excellent place to learn more.</p>

<p>In this case the hiccup means that the pattern
	must occur at the beginning of a line (which is 
	its usual meaning in grep, ed/sed, awk, and other
	contexts).</p>

<p>... and we add a couple of conditions to avoid
	looping and to avoid responding to automated systems</p>

<blockquote><code>* !^FROM_DAEMON 
		<br>* !^FROM_MAILER
		</code></blockquote>

<p>(These are a couple more &quot;magic&quot; values.  
	The man pages show the exact regexes that are
	assigned to these keywords -- if you're curious or
	need to tweak a special condition that is 
	similar to one or the other of these).</p>

<p>... and one more to prevent some tricky loop:</p>

<blockquote><code>* !^X-Loop: myaddress@myhost.mydomain.org
		</code></blockquote>

<p>(All of these patterns start with &quot;bangs&quot; (exclammation
	points) because the condition is that *<strong>no</strong>* line of the
	header start with any of these patterns.  The 'bang' in
	this case (and most other regex contexts) &quot;negates&quot; or 
	&quot;reverses&quot; the meaning of the pattern).</p>

<p>... now we add a &quot;disposition&quot; -- the autoresponse.</p>

<blockquote><code>| (formail -rk \
		<br>-A "X-Loop: yourname@youraddress.com" \
		<br>-A "Precendence: junk"; \
	        <br>echo "Please don't send me any more mail";\
		<br>echo "This is an automated response";\
		<br>echo "I'll never see your message";\
		<br>echo "So, GO AWAY" ) | $SENDMAIL -t -oi
		</code></blockquote>

<p>This is pretty complicated -- but here's how it works:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The pipe character tells procmail that 
		it should launch a program and feed the 
		message to it.

	<li>The open parenthesis is a Bourne shell construct
		that groups a set of commands in such a way as
		to combine the output from all of them into
		one &quot;stream.&quot;  We'll explain this more later.

	<li>The '<tt>formail</tt>' command is a handy program that
		is included with the procmail package.  It
		&quot;formats&quot; mail headers according to its 
		command line switches and its input.
		<ul>
			<li><tt>-rk</tt> tells '<tt>formail</tt>' 
			    to format a
			    &quot;reply&quot; and to &quot;keep&quot; the message body.
			    With these switches formail expects
			    a header and body as input.

			<li>The <tt>-A</tt> parameters tells formail
			    to &quot;add&quot; the next parameter as a
			    header line.  The parameters
			    provided to the <tt>-A</tt> switch must be
			    enclosed in quotes so the shell
			    treats the whole string (spaces 
			    and all) as single parameters.

			<li>The backslashes at the end of each 
			    line tell procmail mail to treat
			    the next line as part of this one.
			    So, all of the lines ending in 
			    backslashes are passed to the shell
			    as one long line.

			<li>This &quot;trailing backslash&quot; or &quot;line
			    continuation&quot; character is a common
			    Unix idiom found in a number of 
			    programming languages and configuration
			    file formats.

			<li>The semicolons tell the shell 
			    to execute another command -- they
			    allow several commands to be issued
			    on the same command line.

			<li>Each of the echo commands should be
			    reasonably self-explanatory.  We
			    could have used a '<tt>cat</tt>' command
			    and put our text into a file if we
			    wanted.  We can also call other programs
			    here -- like '<tt>fortune</tt>' or '<tt>date</tt>' 
			    and their output would be combined with
			    the rest of this).

			<li>Now we get to the closing parenthesis.
			    This marks the end of the block of 
			    commands that we combined.  The output
			    from all of those is fed into the 
			    next pipe -- which starts the local
			    copy of sendmail (note that this is
			    another variable that procmail 
			    toughtfully presets for us).

			<li>The <tt>-t</tt> switch on sendmail tell it to 
			    take the &quot;<tt>To:</tt>&quot; address from the header 
			    of it's input (where '<tt>formail -r</tt>' put
			    it) and the <tt>-oi</tt> switch enables the
			    sendmail &quot;option&quot; to &quot;ignore&quot; lines
			    that consist only of a 'dot' (don't
			    worry about the details on that).
		</ul>
</ul>
<p>Most of the difficulty in understanding procmail
	as nothing to do with procmail itself.  The intricacies
	of regular expressions (those wierd things on the
	'<tt>*</tt>' -- conditional lines) and shell quoting and 
	command syntax, and how to format a reply header that
	will be acceptable to sendmail (the '<tt>formail</tt>' and 
	'<tt>sendmail</tt>' stuff) are the parts that require so 
	much explanation.</p>
