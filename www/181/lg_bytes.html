<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">The Yocto Project: New Embedded Linux Workgroup</h3>

<p>The Linux Foundation in October announced it is expanding its 
technical work in the embedded space with the continuation of existing 
CELF work as well as the formation of another new workgroup focused on 
the embedded space, the Yocto Project.</p>

<p>The Yocto Project provides open source, high quality tools to help 
companies make custom Linux-based systems for embedded products, 
regardless of hardware architecture. The open source Yocto Project 
brings together the elements needed to make the normally difficult
embedded Linux development process easier.</p>

<p>The Yocto Project is launching its version 0.9 with initial versions 
of common build tools.</p>
<p>Participation in the workgroup is completely open and anyone can join 
the development effort. The Linux Foundation invites contributors and 
encourages developers and others to participate at the project 
website: <a href="http://www.yoctoproject.org">http://www.yoctoproject.org</a>.</p>



<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation and Consumer Electronics Linux Forum to Merge</h3>

<p>The Linux Foundation and the Consumer Electronics Linux Forum (CELF), 
a nonprofit international open source software development community 
focused on embedded Linux, have announced they will merge 
organizations, resulting in the CE Linux Forum becoming a technical 
workgroup at the Linux Foundation. As part of this merge, the Linux 
Foundation will expand its technical programs in the embedded 
computing space.</p>

<p>The use of Linux in embedded products has skyrocketed in recent years, 
with Linux now being used in consumer electronic devices of all kinds. 
CELF and the Linux Foundation believe that by combining resources they 
can more efficiently enable the adoption of Linux in the Consumer 
Electronics (CE) industry. Given the broad overlap in members between 
the Linux Foundation and CELF, the similarity in the goals of both 
organizations, and the large increase of embedded participants coming 
to Linux in recent years, this aligning of resources will strengthen 
each organization and ultimately help the organizations' members 
achieve their missions: growing the embedded Linux market.</p>

<p>"CELF and the Linux Foundation have co-located technical events in the 
spring over the last couple of years to exchange technical 
information. We have noticed an increasing number of technical areas 
that both organizations are interested in," said Nobuhiro Asai, chair 
of board of directors of the Consumer Electronics Linux Forum. "This 
merger is a natural transition to accelerate the use of Linux in 
consumer electronics and strengthen the involvement of CE-related 
companies within the Linux developer community."</p>

<p>CELF will become an official workgroup of the Linux Foundation. 
Members of CELF who are not already Linux Foundation members can be 
grandfathered into the organization at the Silver membership level. 
Organized to promote the use of Linux in digital CE products, CELF was 
established in 2003 by eight major consumer electronics companies: 
Panasonic Corporation (Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.), Sony 
Corporation, Hitachi, Ltd., NEC Corporation, Royal Philips 
Electronics, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Sharp Corporation, and 
Toshiba Corporation.</p>

<p>The Linux Foundation will take over the management of CELF's technical 
events and web infrastructure.</p>




<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">VMware Unveils Strategy for Next Era of IT</h3>

<p>At the conclusion of its seventh annual VMworld conference in San 
Francisco, VMware outlined its vision for IT as a Service as the next 
big thing and demonstrated new virtualization and cloud computing 
technologies (see product details in the Product section.)</p>

<p>Paul Maritz, President and CEO of VMware, told the 17,000 attendees at 
VMworld 2010 that a tipping point had been reached in 2009 when the 
number of VMs exceeded the number of physical hosts. This 
means that modern OSes no longer control the hardware and that the new 
universal HAL is the virtualization hypervisor. "This layer is the new 
IT infrastructure," Maritz said; "we think this is the new stack that 
is emerging for the cloud era."</p>

<p>Key highlights made during the event include:</p>

<ul><li>VMware announced a broad strategy and a set of new products to 
help businesses and governments move beyond "IT as a Cost Center" 
to a more business-centric "IT as a Service" model.</li>
<li>VMware announced VMware vCloud Director to enable a new model 
for delivering and consuming IT services across hybrid clouds, the 
VMware vShield product family to tackle cloud security challenges, 
and VMware vCloud Datacenter Services designed to help customers 
build secure, interoperable enterprise-class clouds at leading 
service providers.</li>
<li>VMware announced its cloud application platform, VMware vFabric, 
an application development framework and platform of services to 
optimize the use of cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li>VMware announced VMware View 4.5, its solution for delivering 
virtual desktops as a managed service.  The new View can help 
organizations evolve their legacy desktop computing environments 
to an application and data delivery model.</li>
<li>VMware announced that it had acquired TriCipher, a leader in 
secure access management and enterprise identity federation for 
cloud hosted Software as a Service (SaaS) applications.</li></ul>

<p>For the first time, the VMworld labs were powered by cloud technology 
based on VMware vSphere with distributed data centers located in San 
Francisco, California; Ashburn, Virginia; and Miami, Florida. More 
than 15,300 labs in total and 145,000 virtual machines were deployed 
during the conference. This is over 4,000 virtual machines deployed 
and un-deployed every hour.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Next-Generation Storage Can Double Analytics Processing Speed</h3>

<p>At the Supercomputing 2010 conference in New Orleans, IBM unveiled 
details of a new storage architecture design that will convert 
terabytes of pure information into actionable insights twice as fast 
as previously possible. Ideally suited for cloud computing 
applications and data-intensive workloads such as digital media, data 
mining and financial analytics, this new architecture can shave hours 
off of complex computations.</p>

<p>"Businesses are literally running into walls, unable to keep up with 
the vast amounts of data generated on a daily basis," said Prasenjit 
Sarkar, Master Inventor, Storage Analytics and Resiliency, IBM 
Research, Almaden. "We constantly research and develop the industry's 
most advanced storage technologies to solve the world's biggest data 
problems. This new way of storage partitioning is another step forward 
on this path as it gives businesses faster time-to-insight without 
concern for traditional storage limitations."</p>

<p>Created at IBM Research, Almaden, the new General Parallel File 
System-Shared Nothing Cluster (GPFS-SNC) architecture is designed to 
provide higher availability through advanced clustering technologies, 
dynamic file system management and advanced data replication 
techniques. By "sharing nothing," new levels of availability, 
performance and scaling are achievable. GPFS-SNC is a distributed 
computing architecture in which each node is self-sufficient; tasks 
are then divided up between these independent computers and no one 
waits on the other.</p>

<p>For instance, large financial institutions run complex algorithms to 
analyze risk based on petabytes of data. With billions of files spread 
across multiple computing platforms and stored across the world, these 
mission-critical calculations require significant IT resource and cost 
because of their complexity. Using a GPFS-SNC design provides a common 
file system and namespace across disparate computing platforms.</p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">VMworld Conferences Strengthen End User Computing Strategy </h3>
<p>In Copenhagen, at last month's VMworld 2010 Europe, VMware advanced its 
vision of end user computing with new products to help organizations 
evolve their legacy desktop computing environments to a user-centric 
application and data delivery model. </p>

<p>Introduced at VMworld 2010 in San Francisco, IT as a Service is the 
transformation of IT to a more business-centric approach, focusing on 
outcomes such as operational efficiency, competitiveness and rapid 
response. This means IT shifts from producing IT services to 
optimizing production and consumption of those services in ways 
consistent with business requirements, changing the role of IT from a 
cost center to a center of strategic value.</p>

<p>"Desktop computing is rapidly moving to a world focused on connecting 
end users to critical data and applications they need via any device 
at the edge of the cloud," said Vittorio Viarengo, vice president, End 
User Computing products, VMware. "Enterprises today are seeking a path 
forward from a decades-old PC-centric architecture to a model that 
enables users to be more productive while more effectively managing 
the growing portfolio of devices, data and applications. "</p>
 
<p>The VMware End User Computing strategy delivers solutions for 
enterprises to evolve their PC-centric environments to a cloud 
computing architecture to deliver applications and data to end users. 
Announced in early September at VMworld 2010 in San Francisco, VMware 
View 4.5, VMware ThinApp 4.6, VMware vShield Endpoint, Zimbra 
Appliance and VMware's Desktop Infrastructure Service provide a new 
way of addressing two fundamental client computing challenges: 
enabling secure data access to a mobile workforce and managing the 
diversity of data, applications and client devices needed by 
businesses.</p>
 
<p>Also in early September, VMware previewed and demonstrated Project 
Horizon, a cloud-based management service that securely extends 
enterprise identities into the cloud to provide new methods for 
provisioning and managing applications and data based on the user, not 
the device or underlying operating system.</p>
 
<p>VMware continues to build on this model by introducing VMware View 
4.5, a complete virtual desktop solution that can enable enterprises 
to improve security, lower operating costs, and simplify desktop 
administration by establishing an architecture that is delivered to 
users across the broadest set of devices. Siemens will use VMware View 
4.5 to establish a hosted desktop environment to provide secure, 
real-time access to enterprise desktops from any device while reducing 
the ongoing costs of desktop management. </p>

<p>Outlined in a Reference Architecture Brief announced at VMworld 2010 
in San Francisco, and a white paper commissioned by VMware and 
published by Enterprises Management Associates, VMware View allows 
enterprises to deploy a secure and stateless virtual desktop at a 
datacenter infrastructure cost under $242 per user, more than 60 
percent lower than previously published architectures.</p>

<p>Available today, the full reference architecture includes detailed 
validation for a deployment of 1,000 desktops. Download the reference 
architecture titled VMware Reference Architecture for Stateless 
Virtual Desktops with VMware View 4.5.</p>




<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">VMware Introduces Cloud App Platform for IT as a Service</h3>

<p>At VMworld 2010, VMware introduced its cloud application platform 
strategy and solutions, enabling developers to build and run modern 
applications that intelligently share information with underlying 
infrastructure to maximize application performance, quality of service 
and infrastructure utilization.</p>
 
<p>VMware vFabric cloud application platform combines the market-leading 
Spring Java development framework with platform services including 
lightweight application server, global data management, cloud-ready 
messaging, dynamic load balancing and application performance 
management. Applications built on VMware vFabric provide performance 
and portability across heterogeneous cloud environments.</p>

<p>Principles that have defined today's most demanding consumer 
applications - built-in scalability, new data models, distributed 
infrastructures - are influencing the production of new internal 
customer enterprise applications. These modern applications need to 
support dynamic user interactions, low-latency data access and virtual 
infrastructure all while meeting the security and compliance demands 
of the enterprise. VMware vFabric is optimized for cloud computing's 
dynamic architectures, unlike traditional middleware that requires 
complete stack control.</p>

<p>"IT is undergoing a transformation: applications are changing, 
infrastructure is changing, and organizations are looking for a 
pathway to harness the promise of the cloud," said Rachel Chalmers, 
director for Infrastructure at the 451 Group.  "Application platforms 
of today have markedly different requirements than those we have 
relied upon in the past. VMware vFabric is evolving to meet the needs 
of today's organizations."</p>

<p>An open solution, VMware vFabric will initially target the 2.5 million 
users that develop Spring Java applications. VMware vFabric will 
deliver modern applications to market faster and with less complexity.</p>

<p>VMware vFabric Integrated Application Services is a collection of 
cloud-scale, integrated services, including:</p>

<ul><li>Lightweight Application Server: tc Server, an enterprise version 
of Apache Tomcat, is optimized for Spring and VMware vSphere and 
can be instantantly provisioned.</li>
<li>Data Management Services: GemFire eliminates database 
bottlenecks by providing real-time access to globally distributed 
data.</li>
<li>Cloud-Ready Messaging Service: RabbitMQ facilitates 
communications between applications inside and outside the 
datacenter.</li>
<li>Dynamic Load Balancer: ERS, an enterprise version Apache web 
server, helps ensure optimal performance by distributing and 
balancing application load.</li>
<li>Application Performance Management: Hyperic enables proactive 
performance management across physical, virtual and cloud 
environments.</li></ul>

<p>Additional Resources</p>
<p>Spring and the VMware vFabric family of products are available today 
for download.  For additional information about VMware's cloud 
application platform, please visit
