<H2><A NAME="s9">9. Installing Vim</A> </H2>

<P>After Vim is installed, we don't need to use our normal Linux system anymore
to "dress up" our LFS system. This means that you from now on no longer need
to reboot your computer into the normal Linux system and back to the LFS system.

 </H2>

<H3>Installing Ncurses </H3>

<P>In order to install Vim we need to have the ncurses libraries installed.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the Ncurses archive</LI>
<LI>Configure the package by running <CODE>configure --with-shared</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>Because Ncurses isn't 100% correct according to the latest C standard,
we need to compile it with gcc2723
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Compile the package by running <CODE>make CC=/usr/gcc2723/bin/gcc</CODE></LI>
<LI>Install the terminfo files by running <CODE>make install.data</CODE></LI>
<LI>Go to the test directory and run a few of the programs to verify that the
libraries are working</LI>
<LI>Install the libraries by running <CODE>make install</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss9.2">9.2 Installing Vim</A>
 </H2>

<P>Vim comes in two separate parts: A 'src' package and a 'rt' (run-time)
package. You need both in order to install vim. If you put both archives in
the same directory, the unpacked files of both archives will appear in the
same directory that will be created when you unpack the first (it doesn't matter
which one you unpack first).
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the Vim-src and the Vim-rt archives</LI>
<LI>Configure the package by running <CODE>configure</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<P>Also Vim doesn't compile with gcc 2.95.2, so we have to compile it with
gcc 2.7.2.3 as well.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Compile the package by running <CODE>make CC=/usr/gcc2723/bin/gcc</CODE></LI>
<LI>Install the package by running <CODE>make install</CODE></LI>
