<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Installing a kernel</A> </H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Note on ftp.kernel.org</A>
 </H2>

<P>In section 2 above I mentioned you can download a new kernel from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/
However, this site is often too busy to get through and the maintainers of
this site encourage you to download the kernel from a location near you. You
can access a mirror site by going to ftp://ftp.&lt;country code&gt;.kernel.org/
(like ftp.ca.kernel.org).
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Configuring the kernel</A>
 </H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the Kernel archive</LI>
<LI>Choose a method to configure the kernel (see the README file for more details
on configuration methods) and make sure you don't configure anything as modules
at this point. This is because we won't have the necessary software available
to load kernel modules for a while.</LI>
<LI>After you're done with your kernel configuration, run <CODE>make dep</CODE></LI>
<LI>Compile the kernel by running <CODE>make bzImage</CODE></LI>
<LI>Copy the <CODE>arch/&lt;cpu&gt;/boot/bzImage</CODE> file to the <CODE>/boot</CODE> directory (or
some place else if your Linux system uses a different convention where kernel
images and the like are stored)</LI>
<LI>Optionally you can rename the <CODE>/boot/bzImage</CODE> file to something like <CODE>/boot/lfskernel</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3 Updating LILO</A>
 </H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Edit the <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE> file and go to the LFS section</LI>
<LI>Change the image name to <CODE>lfskernel </CODE>(or whatever you've named the originally
called bzImage file)</LI>
<LI>Run <CODE>lilo </CODE>to update the boot loader.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.4">5.4 Copying the new kernel source tree to $LFS</A>
 </H2>

<P>Copy the entire source tree of the new kernel to $LFS/usr/src. This
can easily be accomplished by running <CODE>cp -av &lt;kernel directory&gt; $LFS/usr/src</CODE>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.5">5.5 Updating sysmlinks</A>
 </H2>

<P>Often the /usr/local/include/linux directory is a symlink to /usr/src/linux
and /usr/src/linux is often a symlink to /usr/src/&lt;kernel version&gt;. Make
sure that /usr/src/linux now points to directory of the kernel source that
you have unpacked before.
<P>It's possible that on your system /usr/include/linux points to /usr/src/linux
- this depends on your distribution.
<P>Execute the following commands to create the proper symlinks on the LFS
system.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>cd $LFS/usr/include</LI>
<LI>ln -s ../src/linux/include/asm asm</LI>
<LI>ln -s ../src/linux/include/linux linux</LI>
</UL>
<P>Please note that if you need to compile software that's going to be used
on your normal Linux system and it needs the kernel headers, it might be a
better idea to restore the symlinks back into their original position if you
decide not to load the new kernel for the normal Linux system. It is perfectly
safe to load the lfskernel for both the LFS system and the normal system.
<H2><A NAME="ss5.6">5.6 Testing the system</A>
 </H2>

<P>Reboot your system and start your LFS system. Verify that the newly installed
kernel doesn't perform out-of-the-ordinary actions (like crashing).
