Hello,
</p>

<p>
according to your author FAQ[0] under "Copyright Issues" you state
that you will publish the works sent to you under the Open Publication
License. The Wikipedia article states that the author of the OPL
recommends using a Createive Commons License as a replacement. I
understand that there are issues with the existing articles which may
prevent relicencing them but for new articles would it be OK if I'd
like to articles to be published under a Creative Commons License -
personally I prefer "by-nc-sa" for written works and "by-sa" for code
works.
</p>

<p>
Given that efforts to keep the OPL updated seem to have stopped
(actually never made it beyond a version 1.0) at 1999-07-08 I think
switching to a CC license should be considered, maybe even let authors
choose between
</p>

<pre>
 * default (stay with OPL)
 * the CC options
</pre>

<p>
any thoughts on that?
</p>

<p>
regards
martin

<p>
PS: no I don't think you can't google but I guess it's a lot easier to
just click the link of my sources, we all got enough work to do.

Well that's a complete and utter failure of an idea. It's <strong>Linux</strong>

We've already had that discussion, a few years ago, and the consensus

I agree, completely. Even though the OPL allows specifying a "no

Our Implied-But-Never-Stated License (that's the <em>real</em> one - the OPL is

to be fined one (1) good quality beer per LG reader, to be sent to the

<p>
For whatever it's worth, speaking just as another staffer -- as well as
someone who <em>is</em> (I think) qualified to judge licences but is aware of
what a time-sink that can be -- you're making an eminently reasonable
call.  
</p>

<p>
I suspect that, if an author wanted to use an article-specific licence
that's obviously compatible with our goals but different -- say, new-BSD
or MIT/X, or maybe even Creative Commons BA-SA 3.0 -- we'd be fine with
that, but not with one that obviously withholds major rights our readers
normally expect <em>LG</em> to convey for each and every issue.  
</p>

<p>
Commercial use is the obvious item that would most often become the
subject of a "Oh, and surely you wouldn't mind if...."  We <em>don't</em> mind,
but then we also don't publish under those conditions.  ;-&gt;  <em>LG</em>
conveys a <em>full</em> set of rights for articles it publishes, including
those of commercial use, as long as credit is appropriately preserved,
as per OPL's provisions for same.
</p>

<p>
People who aren't comfortable with the notion of their work getting
reused by others in a commercial setting, e.g., on <em>LG</em> mirrors that 
include advertising, will find <em>LG</em> an unsuitable place to publish.  
They also, by the way, probably won't like open source, for exactly the
same reason.

&gt; according to your author FAQ[0] under "Copyright Issues" you state
&gt; that you will publish the works sent to you under the Open Publication
&gt; License. The Wikipedia article states that the author of the OPL
&gt; recommends using a Creative Commons License as a replacement. 
</pre>

<p>
Some of the CC licences are, in my view, well suited for _Linux Gazette's_ 
use but have no compelling advantages.  (As you may or may not know,
CC's licences are <em>highly</em> diverse, including both highly proprietary
and free licences, and unfortunately the organisation makes very little
effort to disambiguate the two.)  Some of CC's licences are, in
contrast, entirely unsuitable.  The two proprietary CC licences that you
favour would be in the latter category.
</p>

<p>
David Wiley (creator of OPL 1.0 with help from Eric Raymond and Tim
O'Reilly) now deprecates OPL because he's not an attorney and because he
thinks the various CC licences will stand up better in court.  He also
mentions in passing Andrew M. St. Laurent's critique in an excerpt from
St. Laurent's O'Reilly book _Open Source and Free Software Licensing_,
at <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/10/07/OSlicenses_part2.html">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/10/07/OSlicenses_part2.html</a> .
</p>

<p>
Let's look at all of that.  I'm not an attorney, either, but I'm trained
in business law (in preparation for an early career in the accounting
and finance trade) and have about as much experience evaluating software
and documentation licences as anyone in the Linux community, including
many lawyers in that community.  For whatever it's worth, I think Wiley,
Raymand, and O'Reilly did pretty well in OPL 1.0, especially if one
leaves off Options A and B and all other options -- as does <em>LG</em>.
</p>

<p>
Mr. St. Laurent's beefs with OPL 1.0 are as follows:
</p>

<p>
1.  Any use of "License Options" can create problems.  Maybe, but irrelevant
to <em>LG's</em> usage model, which eschews them.
</p>

<p>
2.  OPL's definition of "substantive modifications" in terms of whether
a change is sematic or not is, in St. Laurent's view, "dangerously
ambiguous".  Well, that's a matter of opinion, and I soundly differ from
Mr. St. Laurent on that point.  I'm perfectly happy to leave application
of that distinction up to a judge.  Unlike many computerists, I'm aware
of how many debatable distinctions are inherently part of law:  We trust
judges and juries to determine whether an action satisfies the
"reasonable man standard" and whether people who commit the "actus reus"
of a violent acts are accompanying that act with a culpatory "mens rea"
(mental state), i.e., intent to do wrong -- and we're supposed to worry 
about their ability to determine whether a change has semantic effect?
</p>

<p>
I'm willing to worry about global warming and international fiscal
policies; I don't have nearly enough worry left over for <em>that</em>.
</p>

<p>
(Anyway, all of that is part of one of the optional sections, and <em>LG</em>
doesn't use that.)
</p>

<p>
3.  Similarly, use of the option to control commercial republication
results in what St. Laurent calls further "ambiguities" -- but the
examples he then cites of such don't strike me as being ambiguities at
all.  What he discusses would be more properly termed the result of an
author using OPL with the discussed option without bothering to read it,
and thus failing to comprehend that it only controls <em>some</em> types of
commercial re-use.
</p>

<p>
I see no actual problem, there, only St. Laurent calling lack of author
attention a problem.  And, again, <em>LG</em> does not use that option in the
first place.
</p>

<p>
4.  St. Laurent complains that OPL's inclusion of "Policy Appendix" and
the "Good Practice Recommendations" might "confuse licensees".  Awww.  
Poor babies.  I'm really not impressed by that argument, either.
</p>

<p>
5.  St. Laurent complains that OPL doesn't address how to comply with
its requirement when publishing anthologies of OPL works, or when
dealing with works existing in multiple generations.  However, again, I
simply don't see a problem.  In particular, his claim that there's a
problem concerning anthologies is, to be blunt, nonsense.  He seems to
be saying that the scope of OPL coverage in multiple-work situations is
unclear.  Bollocks.  As anyone who's studied copyright law seriously
will tell you, it extends to the edge of _derivative works_ of the
original OPL-covered works -- that term being a legal term of art within
copyright law, and a long discussion in itself.
</p>

<p>
I've grown impatient with St. Laurent's writings ever since I bought a
copy in order to review it in comparison to Lawrence Rosen's book on the
same subject for BayLISA.  To my sharp disappointment, I was obliged to
politely pan St. Laurent's book:  It struck me as really shockingly
shoddy work.
</p>

<p>
Here's my review, which I'll gladly licence to the public under the
reader's choice of OPL 1.0 with no options or Creative Commons BY-SA
3.0.  ;-&gt;

<p>
Andrew St. Laurent's 2004 volume "Understanding Open Source and Free
Software Licensing" is O'Reilly's attempt to fill a significant need for
good resources on this subject.  It joins OSI chief counsel Lawrence
Rosen's similar volume from Prentice Hall, "Open Source Licensing:
Software Freedom and Intellectual Property Law", published at nearly the
same time, and Rutgers School of Law professor Rod Dixon's hardcover
volume from Artech House/Horizon, "Open Source Software Law".
</p>

<p>
There's a vital need for such books because businesses have been dipping
their toes into open source for the past decade and immediately
stumbling over legal issues, both real and imaginary.  As a longtime
observer of the resulting fray, I've been longing for a good book on the
subject.
</p>

<p>
St. Laurent's comes within spitting distance of being that book.  As an
attorney with an interest in intellectual property law, he is able to
give a lucid run-through of about a dozen of the most common open source
licences, explaining what each clause means in detail, and contrasting
them with a typical proprietary-software licence, similarly scrutinised.
That part of the book, which comprises the book's middle 70%, will be
useful for people wondering how licences get their force, and how they
operate in our legal framework.Where the book falls down is in a couple
of places.  First and foremost, it lacks a coherent conceptual overview,
failing to clarify the default rights conveyed by unaided copyright law
and its provisions.  It takes for granted crucial concepts such as
"derivative work":  If work A is derivative of work B, then the second
work's owner's rights (and licensing) determine what can be done with
(encumber) the derivative.  The advantages of registering copyrights
(and consequences of not doing so), revocation of licences by the
licensor, collective works versus joint works, and many other details
important to licensing get no coverage at all.  St. Laurent also doesn't
mention at all a key aspect of licences, that the copyright holder
attaches them to instances of a codebase, such that different instances
may bear completely different terms of usage.
</p>

<p>
Some of the very common licensing controversies within the open source
community aren't addressed, either:  Is it necessary or desirable to
require a licensee to indicate assent, e.g., through a clickwrap
agreement mechanism?  (St. Laurent states without reservation that
clickwrap licences have been ruled enforceable, but the judicial record
on the matter is actually mixed.)  How extensive should the reach of
licences' patent-defence clauses (if any) be?  (Some licences revoke the
rights of users who bring any sort of patent action, regardless of the
dispute; others are limited in scope to just patent actions concerning
the licensed work.)  Is it possible to donate a work of original
ownership directly to the public domain, despite the lack of any legal
mechanism for doing so?  Is it desirable to have a choice-of-law
provision in one's licence?  Can you as the primary maintainer and
copyright holder of a collective-work project "upgrade" the project's
licence to a better one?  These are important questions, with which the
book simply won't help you.
</p>

<p>
I was disappointed that St. Laurent takes for granted that the GNU
General Public Licence and Lesser General Public Licence can be
evaluated only as contracts:  Their author, law professor Eben Moglen,
has clarified many times that both contracts are intended as rights
grants under copyright law only, and the licences themselves clearly so
state.   Thus, the question of their enforceability doesn't hinge on
contract formation -- but, even there, St. Laurent's coverage is
lacking:  Given that GPL and LGPL would be unilateral contracts without
any necessary obligation of payment by the licensee, how would the
necessary contract element of "valuable consideration" be found?  (Each
side in a contract must give up something of value; otherwise, there can
be no contract.)  A more-thorough treatment would have discussed that
issue and also the licences' intended status as "bare copyright
licences".
</p>

<p>
These flaws notwithstanding, the book does include excellent, reasonably
readable yet in-depth analysis of all primary open source licences in
use today, and I do strongly recommend it, to all interested audiences.
</p>



<p>
-- end review --
</p>

<p>
I personally <em>do</em> think you have a reasonable point about <em>some</em> of CC's
licences being good -- despite the two particular ones you cite being
just about the worst possible CC licences for <em>LG's</em> purposes.  In my
view, CC BY-SA 3.0 would be a <em>slight</em> improvement over OPL 1.0 sans
options -- but not enough of an improvement to justify switching.
</p>

<p>
Here's my rough taxonomy of current CC licences for OSI's benefit --
plus a follow-up for the sake of perspective:

&gt; &gt; and I could not find any CC licenses on the OSI list that have been
&gt; &gt; approved. Interestingly enough, OSI's homepage uses a CC license.
&gt;
&gt; The reason you don't find the CC licences on its web site is that OSI
&gt; does not approve any licences other than software licences.  Being the
&gt; Open Source Initiative, their mandate is (at least currently)
&gt; restricted to the software domain.
&gt;
&gt; However, I don't see how you can go wrong using one of the CC
&gt; licences, which are the de-facto standard for open document publishing
&gt; and implicitly approved by the OSI by use.  Any OSI board member (I
&gt; used to be one) would probably advise you to choose the CC licence
&gt; that meets your needs and go ahead with it.
</pre>

<p>
It should be bourne in mind that most of the CC licences are (by design)
proprietary.  That is, some of them intentionally do not grant the right
to create or distribute derivative works, and some of them intentionally
grant that right only for non-commercial re-use.

Applying the OSD as criterion, the current 3.0 licence revisions divide
like this, in my opinion:

<pre>
&gt; OK, I stand corrected -- thanks for the insight, Rick.  On the other
&gt; hand, I don't know how far we can go applying criteria for software to
&gt; documents -- what you propose appears reasonable and intuitive, but
&gt; I'd still advise caution when applying the OSD directly to
&gt; document licences.
</pre>

<p>
Very good point (and the original answer still pertains, that OSI simply
doesn't have non-software licensing within its bailiwick in the first
place).
</p>

<p>
Opinions on documentation licensing tend to be surprisingly contentious
(and I wasn't even particularly thinking of the Debian vs. GFDL affair);        
many commentators seem to forget about ways in which documentation tends
to differ fundamentally from software:
</p>

<pre>
o  Getting access to the preferred form really isn't very difficult for
   a motivated re-user.  (We're not talking about contrived DRM/Kindle
   scenarios, but rather ordinary documentation -- but even those succumb
   to screen snapshots and OCR.)   At minimum, the full semantics of the        
   work are available to inspection, i.e., there's nothing like
   software's trait of obscuring through compilation.
o  In part because of the above fact, there's very little barrier to
   creation of a new, equivalent work if an existing one's terms of usage       
   become a problem.                                                            
o  The desire to create a new document as a derivative work borrowing part      
   of an existing document is relatively rarely felt.  (The desire to           
   update an existing poorly maintained document occasionally does arise.)      
o  For various reasons of real-world perception, authors are often              
   concerned that modified variants of their work will make them appear to
   have said something they didn't.  Software people tend to assume that
   this is no more of a problem than it is in software, and yet they are
   not correct.
</pre>

<p>
It's often claimed that documentation's licensing must be compatible            
with (if not the same as) that of the software it concerns, e.g., for           
example code included in the docs -- but that's a pretty contrived
scenario, in my view.                                                           
</p>

<p>
But, to stress again, all of this is outside OSI's ambit.   
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Quoting Martin (martin@marcher.name):
&gt;
&gt;&gt; according to your author FAQ[0] under "Copyright Issues" you state
&gt;&gt; that you will publish the works sent to you under the Open Publication
&gt;&gt; License. The Wikipedia article states that the author of the OPL
&gt;&gt; recommends using a Creative Commons License as a replacement.
&gt;
&gt; Some of the CC licences are, in my view, well suited for _Linux Gazette's_
&gt; use but have no compelling advantages.  (As you may or may not know,
&gt; CC's licences are <em>highly</em> diverse, including both highly proprietary
&gt; and free licences, and unfortunately the organisation makes very little
&gt; effort to disambiguate the two.)  Some of CC's licences are, in
&gt; contrast, entirely unsuitable.  The two proprietary CC licences that you
&gt; favour would be in the latter category.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Erm... not quite; I think I may have sown the seeds of confusion here;
I have no objections against nc-by-sa in general, but as a licence for
'code', it's simply wrong-headed; creating division where none should
exist - I mentioned the 'nd' variant after, but simply as a caveat of
the unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
To Martin; my articles (and other contributions, in whatever form) may
be considered to be under cc-by-sa 3.0, which I find unobjectional; or
under the GFDL minus invariants, which I find mostly unobjectional
(minus also the anti-DRM clause would be perfect for me)). I'm sure
most other LG authors are of a similar mind; however, if such is your
goal, the onus is on you to determine whom of these are willing to
dual licence.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; David Wiley (creator of OPL 1.0 with help from Eric Raymond and Tim
&gt; O'Reilly) now deprecates OPL because he's not an attorney and because he
&gt; thinks the various CC licences will stand up better in court.  He also
&gt; mentions in passing Andrew M. St. Laurent's critique in an excerpt from
&gt; St. Laurent's O'Reilly book _Open Source and Free Software Licensing_,
&gt; at <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/10/07/OSlicenses_part2.html">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/10/07/OSlicenses_part2.html</a> .
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
O'Reilly have a new book: 'Intellectual Property and Open Source' by
Van Lindberg. I've only read a few excerpts, but those seem ok.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Let's look at all of that.  I'm not an attorney, either, but I'm trained
&gt; in business law (in preparation for an early career in the accounting
&gt; and finance trade) and have about as much experience evaluating software
&gt; and documentation licences as anyone in the Linux community, including
&gt; many lawyers in that community.  For whatever it's worth, I think Wiley,
&gt; Raymand, and O'Reilly did pretty well in OPL 1.0, especially if one
&gt; leaves off Options A and B and all other options -- as does <em>LG</em>.
&gt;
&gt; Mr. St. Laurent's beefs with OPL 1.0 are as follows:
&gt;
&gt; 1.  Any use of "License Options" can create problems.  Maybe, but irrelevant
&gt; to <em>LG's</em> usage model, which eschews them.
&gt;
&gt; 2.  OPL's definition of "substantive modifications" in terms of whether
&gt; a change is sematic or not is, in St. Laurent's view, "dangerously
&gt; ambiguous".  Well, that's a matter of opinion, and I soundly differ from
&gt; Mr. St. Laurent on that point.  I'm perfectly happy to leave application
&gt; of that distinction up to a judge.  Unlike many computerists, I'm aware
&gt; of how many debatable distinctions are inherently part of law:  We trust
&gt; judges and juries to determine whether an action satisfies the
&gt; "reasonable man standard" and whether people who commit the "actus reus"
&gt; of a violent acts are accompanying that act with a culpatory "mens rea"
&gt; (mental state), i.e., intent to do wrong -- and we're supposed to worry
&gt; about their ability to determine whether a change has semantic effect?
&gt;
&gt; I'm willing to worry about global warming and international fiscal
&gt; policies; I don't have nearly enough worry left over for <em>that</em>.
&gt;
&gt; (Anyway, all of that is part of one of the optional sections, and <em>LG</em>
&gt; doesn't use that.)
&gt;
&gt; 3.  Similarly, use of the option to control commercial republication
&gt; results in what St. Laurent calls further "ambiguities" -- but the
&gt; examples he then cites of such don't strike me as being ambiguities at
&gt; all.  What he discusses would be more properly termed the result of an
&gt; author using OPL with the discussed option without bothering to read it,
&gt; and thus failing to comprehend that it only controls <em>some</em> types of
&gt; commercial re-use.
&gt;
&gt; I see no actual problem, there, only St. Laurent calling lack of author
&gt; attention a problem.  And, again, <em>LG</em> does not use that option in the
&gt; first place.
&gt;
&gt; 4.  St. Laurent complains that OPL's inclusion of "Policy Appendix" and
&gt; the "Good Practice Recommendations" might "confuse licensees".  Awww.
&gt; Poor babies.  I'm really not impressed by that argument, either.
&gt;
&gt; 5.  St. Laurent complains that OPL doesn't address how to comply with
&gt; its requirement when publishing anthologies of OPL works, or when
&gt; dealing with works existing in multiple generations.  However, again, I
&gt; simply don't see a problem.  In particular, his claim that there's a
&gt; problem concerning anthologies is, to be blunt, nonsense.  He seems to
&gt; be saying that the scope of OPL coverage in multiple-work situations is
&gt; unclear.  Bollocks.  As anyone who's studied copyright law seriously
&gt; will tell you, it extends to the edge of _derivative works_ of the
&gt; original OPL-covered works -- that term being a legal term of art within
&gt; copyright law, and a long discussion in itself.
&gt;
&gt; I've grown impatient with St. Laurent's writings ever since I bought a
&gt; copy in order to review it in comparison to Lawrence Rosen's book on the
&gt; same subject for BayLISA.  To my sharp disappointment, I was obliged to
&gt; politely pan St. Laurent's book:  It struck me as really shockingly
&gt; shoddy work.
&gt;
&gt; Here's my review, which I'll gladly licence to the public under the
&gt; reader's choice of OPL 1.0 with no options or Creative Commons BY-SA
&gt; 3.0.  ;-&gt;

&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Andrew St. Laurent's 2004 volume "Understanding Open Source and Free
&gt; Software Licensing" is O'Reilly's attempt to fill a significant need for
&gt; good resources on this subject.  It joins OSI chief counsel Lawrence
&gt; Rosen's similar volume from Prentice Hall, "Open Source Licensing:
&gt; Software Freedom and Intellectual Property Law", published at nearly the
&gt; same time, and Rutgers School of Law professor Rod Dixon's hardcover
&gt; volume from Artech House/Horizon, "Open Source Software Law".
&gt;
&gt; There's a vital need for such books because businesses have been dipping
&gt; their toes into open source for the past decade and immediately
&gt; stumbling over legal issues, both real and imaginary.  As a longtime
&gt; observer of the resulting fray, I've been longing for a good book on the
&gt; subject.
&gt;
&gt; St. Laurent's comes within spitting distance of being that book.  As an
&gt; attorney with an interest in intellectual property law, he is able to
&gt; give a lucid run-through of about a dozen of the most common open source
&gt; licences, explaining what each clause means in detail, and contrasting
&gt; them with a typical proprietary-software licence, similarly scrutinised.
&gt; That part of the book, which comprises the book's middle 70%, will be
&gt; useful for people wondering how licences get their force, and how they
&gt; operate in our legal framework.Where the book falls down is in a couple
&gt; of places.  First and foremost, it lacks a coherent conceptual overview,
&gt; failing to clarify the default rights conveyed by unaided copyright law
&gt; and its provisions.  It takes for granted crucial concepts such as
&gt; "derivative work":  If work A is derivative of work B, then the second
&gt; work's owner's rights (and licensing) determine what can be done with
&gt; (encumber) the derivative.  The advantages of registering copyrights
&gt; (and consequences of not doing so), revocation of licences by the
&gt; licensor, collective works versus joint works, and many other details
&gt; important to licensing get no coverage at all.  St. Laurent also doesn't
&gt; mention at all a key aspect of licences, that the copyright holder
&gt; attaches them to instances of a codebase, such that different instances
&gt; may bear completely different terms of usage.
&gt;
&gt; Some of the very common licensing controversies within the open source
&gt; community aren't addressed, either:  Is it necessary or desirable to
&gt; require a licensee to indicate assent, e.g., through a clickwrap
&gt; agreement mechanism?  (St. Laurent states without reservation that
&gt; clickwrap licences have been ruled enforceable, but the judicial record
&gt; on the matter is actually mixed.)  How extensive should the reach of
&gt; licences' patent-defence clauses (if any) be?  (Some licences revoke the
&gt; rights of users who bring any sort of patent action, regardless of the
&gt; dispute; others are limited in scope to just patent actions concerning
&gt; the licensed work.)  Is it possible to donate a work of original
&gt; ownership directly to the public domain, despite the lack of any legal
&gt; mechanism for doing so?  Is it desirable to have a choice-of-law
&gt; provision in one's licence?  Can you as the primary maintainer and
&gt; copyright holder of a collective-work project "upgrade" the project's
&gt; licence to a better one?  These are important questions, with which the
&gt; book simply won't help you.
&gt;
&gt; I was disappointed that St. Laurent takes for granted that the GNU
&gt; General Public Licence and Lesser General Public Licence can be
&gt; evaluated only as contracts:  Their author, law professor Eben Moglen,
&gt; has clarified many times that both contracts are intended as rights
&gt; grants under copyright law only, and the licences themselves clearly so
&gt; state.   Thus, the question of their enforceability doesn't hinge on
</pre>

<p>
The ruling on the Artistic License, as reported in the current issue's
Newsbytes, validates that.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; contract formation -- but, even there, St. Laurent's coverage is
&gt; lacking:  Given that GPL and LGPL would be unilateral contracts without
&gt; any necessary obligation of payment by the licensee, how would the
&gt; necessary contract element of "valuable consideration" be found?  (Each
&gt; side in a contract must give up something of value; otherwise, there can
&gt; be no contract.)  A more-thorough treatment would have discussed that
&gt; issue and also the licences' intended status as "bare copyright
&gt; licences".
&gt;
&gt; These flaws notwithstanding, the book does include excellent, reasonably
&gt; readable yet in-depth analysis of all primary open source licences in
&gt; use today, and I do strongly recommend it, to all interested audiences.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; -- end review --
&gt;
&gt; I personally <em>do</em> think you have a reasonable point about <em>some</em> of CC's
&gt; licences being good -- despite the two particular ones you cite being
&gt; just about the worst possible CC licences for <em>LG's</em> purposes.  In my
&gt; view, CC BY-SA 3.0 would be a <em>slight</em> improvement over OPL 1.0 sans
&gt; options -- but not enough of an improvement to justify switching.
&gt;
&gt; Here's my rough taxonomy of current CC licences for OSI's benefit --
&gt; plus a follow-up for the sake of perspective:

&gt;&gt; &gt; However, some contributions will be in the form of powerpoint
&gt;&gt; &gt; templates, and the Create Commons Attribution license seems to be
&gt;&gt; &gt; simple enough to allow for commercial and non-commercial usage,
&gt;&gt; &gt; while keeping it open. AFAIK, not all CC licenses are OSI-compliant,
&gt;&gt; &gt; and I could not find any CC licenses on the OSI list that have been
&gt;&gt; &gt; approved. Interestingly enough, OSI's homepage uses a CC license.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The reason you don't find the CC licences on its web site is that OSI
&gt;&gt; does not approve any licences other than software licences.  Being the
&gt;&gt; Open Source Initiative, their mandate is (at least currently)
&gt;&gt; restricted to the software domain.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; However, I don't see how you can go wrong using one of the CC
&gt;&gt; licences, which are the de-facto standard for open document publishing
&gt;&gt; and implicitly approved by the OSI by use.  Any OSI board member (I
&gt;&gt; used to be one) would probably advise you to choose the CC licence
&gt;&gt; that meets your needs and go ahead with it.
&gt;
&gt; It should be bourne in mind that most of the CC licences are (by design)
&gt; proprietary.  That is, some of them intentionally do not grant the right
&gt; to create or distribute derivative works, and some of them intentionally
&gt; grant that right only for non-commercial re-use.
&gt;
&gt; Applying the OSD as criterion, the current 3.0 licence revisions divide
&gt; like this, in my opinion:
&gt;
&gt; Proprietary

&gt; Attribution-NoDerivs
&gt; Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs
&gt; Attribution-NonCommercial

&gt;
&gt;&gt; OK, I stand corrected -- thanks for the insight, Rick.  On the other
&gt;&gt; hand, I don't know how far we can go applying criteria for software to
&gt;&gt; documents -- what you propose appears reasonable and intuitive, but
&gt;&gt; I'd still advise caution when applying the OSD directly to
&gt;&gt; document licences.
&gt;
&gt; Very good point (and the original answer still pertains, that OSI simply
&gt; doesn't have non-software licensing within its bailiwick in the first
&gt; place).
&gt;
&gt; Opinions on documentation licensing tend to be surprisingly contentious
&gt; (and I wasn't even particularly thinking of the Debian vs. GFDL affair);
&gt; many commentators seem to forget about ways in which documentation tends
&gt; to differ fundamentally from software:
&gt;
&gt; o  Getting access to the preferred form really isn't very difficult for
&gt;   a motivated re-user.  (We're not talking about contrived DRM/Kindle
&gt;   scenarios, but rather ordinary documentation -- but even those succumb
&gt;   to screen snapshots and OCR.)   At minimum, the full semantics of the
&gt;   work are available to inspection, i.e., there's nothing like
&gt;   software's trait of obscuring through compilation.
&gt; o  In part because of the above fact, there's very little barrier to
&gt;   creation of a new, equivalent work if an existing one's terms of usage
&gt;   become a problem.
&gt; o  The desire to create a new document as a derivative work borrowing part
&gt;   of an existing document is relatively rarely felt.  (The desire to
&gt;   update an existing poorly maintained document occasionally does arise.)
</pre>

<p>
And in the former situation, the strong desire is usually to write a
new explanation in one's own words, which is a new copyrightable
entity - and the 'academic' principle of acknowledging prior work is
immaterial as that is not enshrined in current international copyright
law.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; o  For various reasons of real-world perception, authors are often
&gt;   concerned that modified variants of their work will make them appear to
&gt;   have said something they didn't.  Software people tend to assume that
&gt;   this is no more of a problem than it is in software, and yet they are
&gt;   not correct.
&gt;
&gt; It's often claimed that documentation's licensing must be compatible
&gt; with (if not the same as) that of the software it concerns, e.g., for
&gt; example code included in the docs -- but that's a pretty contrived
&gt; scenario, in my view.
</pre>

<p>
Well, that was one of the primary objections against the GFDL's
incompatibilities with the GPL; in certain situations it's quite
justifiable (Emacs lisp function documentation, etc.) In the case of
example code, the freedom to 'run' the software is the freedom to
duplicate it verbatim, so it should come without additional terms (but
that's an idealistic notion); as far as I'm concerned, that's the kind
of licence I granted every time I contributed a less than substantial
piece of code to LG (which would be every time, in my case); the OPL
was the licence attached to the entire explanation - words and all <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt;
&gt; But, to stress again, all of this is outside OSI's ambit.

OK, that was yours rather than Martin's, it seems.  In any event, my
point was that he seemed to feel that he needed to use licences that
reserve commercial rights, which is of course absolutely his
prerogative, but is incompatible with <em>LG</em>.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, nothing at all wrong with CC BY-SA 3.0.  It's a really good,
non-proprietary[1] copyleft licence for non-software works, e.g., for 
documentation and other writings.
</p>

<p>
And, right -- either the NC or ND (NoDerivs) element in a CC licence
indicates a proprietary licence.  As I said, of their six current
licences, <em>only</em> two, "BY" and "BY-SA", are non-proprietary.

It's obviously a practical necessity to license example code compatibly
with the software needed to run it.  But it's pretty rare for that
problem to arise concerning <em>non-trivial</em> example code.  (If trivial
example code has a licensing conflict, no big deal, really.  It doesn't
really matter.)
</p>


<p>
[1] The term "non-proprietary" is so hideous that I often say "open
source" in the CC context, but then often causes someone to mistakenly
think I'm talking about [mis]applying CC's licensing to software.  You
might have done this, above.

Hi,
</p>

<p>
wow, that is quite a discussion I started here. Actually I was just
expecting something like:
</p>

<pre>
We are fine with licenses:
A, B, C, D
 
still we prefer OPL as our default license (because........)
</pre>

<p>
As I don't have any insight about how you work apart from the FAQs and
this discussion I can't make a qualified statement, but as a "user" of
these licenses I'd be happy to get this list in the FAQ or somewhere
on the homepage. Maybe even the reasoning why (most of you) consider
NC not acceptable. From the reading I get the point that, with NC, it
would be impossible for companies to use the articles as a base or
reference work in their projects. Good point actually - I didn't think
of that at all by now (and I hope I didn't get it wrong).
</p>

<p>
I think I'm a pretty typical user of the open source/copyleft
licenses. I don't intend to spend hours searching the web and hoping
to find someone using my work in a way that is not allowed by the
license, but in case I find someone would be using an article and it
get's really popular I wanna get my share (be that by reputation or
monetary strongly depends on that situation), but I just consider it a
safety belt.
</p>


<p>
Hope that makes my question a bit clearer, I'm not after some legal
discussion just a set of choice (choice <em>is</em> good <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">. And given the
amount of press CC/GNU licenses get it might be the "safer safety
belt" as they may have been challenged already and the situation is
easier to handle just in case. (Do I still make sense?)

Basic coverage of that is in the Author FAQ, linked from the front page:
</p>

  Copyright Issues
 
  We're happy to accept articles previously published elsewhere, as long

  re-released under the Open Publication License (OPL), LG's default
  publication license. Our official copyright statement (in short, the OPL
  without the optional clauses) is at
  <a href="../../../copying.html">http://linuxgazette.net/copying.html</a>.
</pre>

<p>
The term "default" alludes, here, to the fact that, if you're a real
licensing militant and desparately want to use something else, you can
ask.  Ben can say "Sure", or he can say "Sorry, not worth the hassle."
</p>

<p>
And, oddly enough, that's pretty much exactly what Ben's said in this

To be blunt, I really doubt we're going to alter the magazine's front

fine with granting except for one guy over the course of 13 years is
part of the magazine's standard licence.
</p>

<p>
I'm willing, nonetheless, to spend a few minutes giving my personal view
on the licensing situation.  (To be really clear, I don't speak <em>LG's</em>
institutional view.  Ben does, when he chooses to, being in charge of
the joint.)
</p>

<p>
Back in dinosaur days, universities and other institutions tended to
make software source code available under proprietary terms or not at
all.  Some of them decided, after a while, that "Hey, this is a way to
make money!"  So, they changed to issuing non-commercial-use-only
licensing for most source code.  If you wanted to make usage of that
code, you had to purchase a commercial-deployment licence from a
university trust set up for that purpose.  Quite a number of
universities still do that, which is why many important codebases such
as Tripwire (from Perdue U.) entered the modern era as "free for
non-commercial use" code.
</p>

<p>
UC Berkekey and then MIT were nearly unique mavericks during this
period, issuing <em>all</em> rights to many codebases under the BSD and MIT/X11
licence, respectively.  At first, their licensing was quaint and
regarded as impractical and ill-advised.  Gradually, the advantages
became so compelling that truly free-licensed code clobbered pretty much
all of the noncommercial-use-only alternatives in the market for users
and mindshare:  Tripwire ASR, proprietary SSH, PGP, COPS, and the like
all lagged behind freely-licensed competitors.
</p>

<p>
I was at VA Linux Systems when the Tripwire people visited in something
of a panic over their mindshare loss to such competitors.  VA helped
them to open-source their IDS engine and terminate the
free-for-noncommercial-use-only variant, both of which had become rather
old and moldy, and were being swept aside.  (It may have been too late
for them.  Also, their source codebase proved to be a hopelessly antique
C++ thing.)
</p>

<p>
I'm running low on time, but basically we all learned over the last
couple of decades that free-for-noncommercial-use-only licensing was
rubbish, was a hassle (e.g., does <em>LG</em> need to ask all prior authors 
before it could put, hypothetically, Google AdSense ads on its Web
site?) and was a loser of an idea with no real advantages -- and also
that the magazine, like open source software, does perfectly fine
without it.
</p>

<p>
If you think commercial rights to your 4kB HTML magazine articles
are precious and must be guarded zealously lest anyone dared to
republish your pieces without paying you, then <em>LG</em> is simply not the
right magazine for you.  There are plenty of others that might qualify.
We never think the worse of anyone for that -- indeed, that would be
really hypocritical since I and others also sell different articles
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
I hope none of the above has been harsh (I'm a bit rushed for time), and 
please do remember that I'm voicing my own view, only.  Thanks.

&gt; I'm willing, nonetheless, to spend a few minutes giving my personal view
&gt; on the licensing situation.  (To be really clear, I don't speak <em>LG's</em>
&gt; institutional view.  Ben does, when he chooses to, being in charge of
&gt; the joint.)
</pre>

<p>
As has invariably been the case in the past, Rick's current opinion on
the licensing issues is in exact accord with mine. His knowledge on the
topic is encyclopedic, and I've asked for his help on thorny questions
in this area repeatedly.
</p>

<p>
My official position on this is that, barring an alien takeover of his
brain, Rick is welcome and invited to speak authoritatively on LG
licensing issues.

Since we're running a bit short on articles this month, I'll take you up
