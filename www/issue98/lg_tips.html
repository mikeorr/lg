<P>
(with minor editing by Ben Okopnik)
</P>
<P>
I have many files on my hard disk which are important and need to be
encrypted. Once, I left my computer at a client's location while
working on their database, and they tried to crack into it. They got in
with a <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> boot disk and installed FTPD so they could grab my files.
The only reason they failed was because they didn't know how to crack a
plain PostgreSQL database (which should be simple when you're logged in
as root). Since then, I don't leave any important data un-encrypted in
order to be ready for such incidents.
</P>
<P>
Since I often use Midnight Commander, I have automated this by creating
a menu item in its menu file (~/.mc/menu) [ Note: This can also be done
via MC's pull-down menu system - press "F9", select "Command", then
"Menu File edit". ] The following entry will pack the entire current
directory and encrypt the result with GnuPG.
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/encryptdir-gpg.midnight-commander.txt">encryptdir-gpg.midnight-commander.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
I've also added an entry for single file encryption:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/encrypt1file-gpg.midnight-commander.txt">encrypt1file-gpg.midnight-commander.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
What if the files are already encrypted? In order to save some time, I
have put following into the extension file located at ~/.mc/bindings
[ Note: 'F9', "Command", "Extension File edit" via the pull-down menu. ]
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/view-gpg.midnight-commander.txt">view-gpg.midnight-commander.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Now, when you press F3 (view) on the file with extension *.gpg, it asks
you for the passphrase and shows the contents of the file. Beware,
however: if you are on the network or on a multi-user system, your
memory and swap file (which contain the decrypted text) could be exposed
to attackers.
</P>
<P>
One good use for this is to put all your passwords into a single file,
and simply remember one passphrase. Be sure to remove the original plain
text files with "wipe" or "shred" rather than "rm" to  delete data in a
secure manner.
</P>

<BR>Question by Francis Matsika (fmatsika from zdb.co.zw)


<P><STRONG>
I have just installed redhat 9.0 and i am wondering how to configure or
build php
as an apache module
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I installed apache and php using  rpm's that come with redhat 9.0
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Raj] 
If you used RPMs it has already been installed. Create a file in your
<TT>/var/www/html/</TT> directory (say self.php), and put this lines into it
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>&lt;?
phpinfo()
?&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Point your browser to it, (usually by saying <A HREF="http://127.0.0.1/self.php"
	>http://127.0.0.1/self.php</A>
in your browser) and you will have everything you never wanted to know
about your PHP module in front of your eyes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
You miss the point completely here. The question was not "how can I test
php"; it was "how can I get apache to utilise it". The answer to that
question is that the RPMs should have already sorted that out for you,
Francis. You'll just have to enure that you:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>apachectl restart
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Raj] 
Just another example why speed reading is bad for health 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">. Francis, as
Thomas pointed out, if you have used RPMs for installation, then
everything has already been taken care of. However, if you want to be
sure that good old rpm has not cheated you out what is rightfully yours,
then check for the following files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The main workhorse for translating the php code into html:
/etc/httpd/modules/libphp4.so
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The file which controls how PHP behaves while interpreting php files:
/etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Controls quite a few other PHP features, like security, language options etc. Very well commented:
/etc/php.ini

I am a newbie debian user (switched from RH).
I have faced a strange prob. in woody. whenever I modified any file the
previous contents is backedup with a *~* sign and the modified one is saved
with the actual name. like *test.kwd* will be *test.kwd* after modification,
but there will be an extra *test.kwd~* also.

plz suggest me how to stop the generation of this second back-up file.

Well, yet again Joydeep, I am being poisoned with LOIS (Lack Of

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am going to make an intelligent guess and assume that you are using vi (or in your case vim).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Vim will save backup files, using the caret (~) notation. You can add
the following to your ~/.vimrc file:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>:set nobackup
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to disable it (in the configuration file the leading ':' is optional).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, if you are not using vi[m] then that means we need to find an
alternative solution -- something drastic I think, like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>cd / &amp;&amp; find . -name '*~' -exec rm -f {} \;
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can then add this as a cron entry to run say every 20 minutes?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>0-59/20 * * * * some_user  cd / &amp;&amp; find . -name '*~' -exec rm -f {} \;

<BR>Question by Robin Chhetri (robinchhetri from fastmail.fm)

<P><STRONG>
Hi Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I asked another question around one month ago and even though I could not
come up with a answer I decided to come up here again.(Incidentally I
tried it also in linuxquestions.org).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What would be the equivalent to the zsh script given below in bash
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$echo ${${(z) $(whereis libcrypto)}[2]}
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
if the output of $(whereis libcrypto) is
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>libcrypto: libcrypto.so libcryto.a
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
it returns libcrypto.so only.
Now I could come up with
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$robin=($(whereis libcrypto)); echo ${robin[1]}
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
But can it be done in one go using some construct?
I am not a shell guru so I wonder if it can be done!
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Faber] 
I must be missing something.  If you simply want to print to STDOUT,
try this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
$( whereis libcrypto | awk '{print $3}' )
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
which will print to STDOUT. If you simply must put it into a variable, then:
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
$robin=$(whereis libcrypto | awk '{print $3}') ; echo $robin
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
is the shortest way <EM>I</EM> know of, but that isn't saying much.

GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader), is a GNU bootloader. It offers an
interactive shell in which to configure it. I actually dislike GRUB
immensly and prefer the defacto "LILO" loader, although many distributions
now use GRUB as their default, alas.
</P>

<P>
I find the config file confusing, and terse (cf: "man tar" - perhaps <EM>the</EM>
heaviest man page of them all).
</P>
<P>
NFS is Network FileSystem, and I use this extensively via PLIP (which is a
Paralell Line IP), which allows you to mount another computer's FS over a
network.
</P>
<P>
DHCP is a means of automagically having a machine assigned an IP address.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">By far the most popular reason, in my opinion, is that GRUB takes nice
high resolution pictures, while LILO only handles cruddy resolution of
640x480.  Which probably means that its graphics work on more systems,
but gosh, it'd be nice to have the option.  If the code costs too much
space though... maybe grub is bigger.

<BR>Question by dokhebi (dokhebi from earthlink.net)


<P><STRONG>
I've tried reading all of the documentation for Linux Hotplug that I can
find, and none of it seems to answer my questions;  A lot of it referes
to other documentation that goes off the main topic, and there is nothing that
describes the format of the usb *mapfiles, or how to set up the
auto-mounting of a specific device (in my case a SanDisk Cruzer)  What
I really want is a step-by-step configuration guide or a "Linux Hotplug for
Dummies" type of book
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks,

<P>
Well, can't give you that but you reminded me that I wanted to look into
this myself. Here is what I've found so far:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
If you plug something into the usb port (that is what most of the time
hotplug is for, in the future firewire and maybe pci hotplug will also come
into the game) the kernel does something and then something else does
something (in the flux, 2.5 is different than 2.4 and I really didn't get it
since it didn't interest me) and then hotplug comes into the game. There are
config files under <TT>/etc/hotplug</TT> (at least thats the place with debian):
usbusb.distmap, usb.rc, usb.agent and usb.handmap.
usb.agent and usb.rc are for hotplug itself and the interesting parts are
distmap and handmap. Dunno for sure what handmap is for (devices where
modprobe doesn't know what to do?), but in distmap are the devices and their
name equivalents in the form idVendor idProduct and so forth. I have a usb
memory stick which gets handled like this:
scsi emulation needs to be there (sd_mod)
usb-core needs to be there (obviously)
usb-storage needs to be loaded (since the stick is storage)
and maybe the right fs modules like vfat, msdos or whatever
then the thing gets mounted like this
mount -t auto <TT>/dev/sda1</TT> <TT>/mnt/usbstick</TT>
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
OK, now to put this into the scripts hotplug can handle:
I searched google and found some german LUG that had written some scripts
already. I adapted this for my use. Here it is.
Save the file as <TT>/etc/hotplug/usb/usb-storage:</TT>
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/usb-storage.sh.txt">usb-storage.sh.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Now for a little (newbie-ish) explanation. The set &gt;&gt; thing writes the
variables that get set by the kernel thingy to <TT>/tmp/usb-storage-variables.</TT>
Take a look into that,
</P>

<blockquote><pre>PRODUCT=c76/5/100
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
and
</P>

<blockquote><pre>ACTION=add
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
are important and maybe
</P>

<blockquote><pre>DEVFS=/proc/bus/usb
DEVICE=/proc/bus/usb/001/007
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
too.
</P>
<P>
The echo marks simply where one insert ends and the next starts.
If the variable ACTION is add the next case is triggered which checks if the
product id is c76/5/100. This is my usbstick. Since I want to have this
script also for my girlfriends stick I need to destinguish between them.
If it is my stick ($PRODUCT is c76/5/100) then it gets mounted.
</P>
<P>
If you unplug it the script <EM>should</EM> be run again if I understand it
correctly, but this doesn't seem to happen. ACTION=remove never appears.
</P>
<P>
I want to make it like this later on: a usb-hub connected to our server (in
my apartment-sharing community) where you plug in your usb stick upon
entrance. Then this gets mounted and the other computer you turn on mounts
that from the server and loads e.g. mozillas bookmarks from the stick. If
you trigger a serial mouse button (very handy that they have 3 buttons
mostly - 3 ppl in the community) the corresponding usb stick should then get
unmounted and you can leave the house.
</P>
<P>
Not a book Edward, but I hope sufficient for the beginning.
</P>
<P>
Cheers

I've been able to scope this much out, but I don't like the idea of hard
coding the device (<TT>/dev/sda1</TT>) because I can't be sure that it will
always be that device.  What if this is the second usb-storage device I
plug in?  What if I decide to add more SCSI devices (my main system has
an Adaptec AHA-2940UW with 7 devices already) and I don't change the
script?  Is there a way to get the device node from the known info?  In
other words, is it encoded in <TT>/proc/bus/usb/xxx/yyy</TT> and I can extract
it?
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, it says in the docs (linux-hotplug.sf.net or something) that device
info (in $DEVICE) is in 2.5....
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Now that 2.6 has released, <A

 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
I <EM>think</EM> the <TT>/proc/</TT> stuff can be used for assigning to the right device,
but sort of hard to do with only one stick. Later my flat mate comes back
and I can test with his stick too, then I can tell you more.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I don't want to say this, but for all of Microsofts many faults, they
can at least auto mount without having to go through all of this shit.
I think it's time for the kernal hackers to wake up and smell the
coffee, because Linux will not be ready for the desktop until it can do
want M$ can do, but better, faster, and cheaper.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
If you rely on the kernel hackers there you are sort of lost. They are
already having fun hacking the kernel, they don't need anything more. And
this is no longer a kernel-space thing: the kernel informs you already where
and what (if we think <TT>/proc</TT> is the right thing) but there are simply not the
userspace tools. The usb-stick phenomenon is just coming up <EM>really</EM> fast
right now ...
</P>

<P>
...and up to now this wasn't necessary. As for scsi hotplug, this is
simply rare.

I will mail later if I figured something out.

<BR>Question by Steven Lockhart (linuxoz from yahoo.com.au)

<P><STRONG>
For security reasons I would like to convert all incoming mail
attachments from htm/html to pdf.
( a procmail, ghostscript, ripmime, altermime ) or whatever it takes
solution.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am sure a lot off mail server sysops would love to do this.

<P><STRONG>
Any ideas would be appreciated

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
For security reasons (and sanity reasons for that matter), you should
really be sending all MIME-encoded e-mail to <TT>/dev/null.</TT> It is more likely
that if you were to do a conversion that you'd only be translating spam
into Yet Another Medium (tm), so why bother?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Doesn't mean we won't answer him, mind you.  I chime in here to warn
that just because HTML to PDF tranlators currently ditch javascript bugs
and various browser-bug exploits, that someday the PDF internal
scripting language may grow fancy enough to do some pretty strange
things.  Luckily at the moment, PDF's a pretty nice "destination = paper"
kind of format.

Yep -- again this depends on which filtering tool you would like to use.
Personally, I find procmail the easiest, but that might not necessarily
suit your needs.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nope, not me. Here's one possible solution (note: not tested).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre># Is it html?
:0:
* ^Content-Type:.*html
| html2pdf /some_location/yum.pdf
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Probably you want to use some tricks to create a reasonable filename
that won't be overwritten constantly (if there's only one, message ID
ought to do, with .pdf tacked on the end) and you might need to use a
MIME decoder to pull off the portion which is the actual HTML portion.
After that, the trick should be usable for other "readable" attachment
types you feel like converting for sanity, e.g. quoted-printable to
your local character set, etc.  You'll need to handle each file format
seperately, unless you have a converter that's smart enough to figure
out the filetype on its own.

<P><STRONG>
Hello answer guy,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I need to be able to secure an external modem that has been connect to a
Solaris box to protect against unauthorized calls.. What I mean is that I
want to be able to allow people to connect to the box based purely on the
phone number they are calling from.  Is there a way on the modem to only
allow certain calls to go through while rejecting all other calls?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
See the "mgetty" open source pkg (<A HREF="http://alpha.greenie.net/mgetty"
	>http://alpha.greenie.net/mgetty</A>).
It offers this capability, provided that your modem line has caller id.
The pkg includes pretty good documentation as well as good example cfg
files.

First thing, thanks for writing to The Answer Gang.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Secondly, you may not be aware of the resource, but there's this great
site about printing support for Linux called linuxprinting.org.  You've
gotten you printer working for at least a couple of machines though, so
perhaps you've already been by there.  If not, check it out 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So that leaves the nitty gritty good stuff.  I'm guessing the topology
is like this, but if it's different, please describe how things are
really connected:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Usually in order to be a printer client, Linux boxes have to be running
something small to make the connection.  lpr with their only printer
pointed at the big RH box as a remote printer, for example.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
rlpr might be a fast thing to try on one of them.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Please advise if you're using CUPS or lprng.  While the general answer
(make sure the clients know who the printer is and have the protocol
loaded) is the same, the details of the answer are quite different.  And
the docs at <a href="http://linuxprinting.org/">linuxprinting.org</a> 
may be handy indeed.

That works fine. I wonder what "gs"s hangup was. Oh, well - you got it

it to "sh -c" instead of execvp()ing it in this case: the perms will
take care of all that.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The problem is probably that $GS_ARGS and $filelist are both strings with
multiple arguments in them: Since you're calling <TT> system()</TT> with more that one

responsibility.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Or, for those of you watching at home who haven't installed Ruby yet:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>#! /usr/bin/env python

import sys
print sys.argv
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, here's the script in action: (Actually, this isn't either of those
scripts in action: It's a C version I wrote as a programming exercise. But it
does the same thing.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>~$ putargs $(date)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You see? The caller of a program does the splitting. And that means that if
you want to call other programs, you have to do it too, or else your script
will crash if somebody tries to use it on a filename with a character in it
that the shell considers special, like a space or a star, because <TT> system()</TT>
with one arg is calling <TT>/bin/sh</TT> behind your back.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So that's the main reason for bypassing <TT>/bin/sh:</TT> It gives you more flexibility
with filenames: The "security risk" Ben keeps warning everyone about isn't,
IMO, really the issue. It's just good style not to leave that sort of thing to
the shell. <EM>Especially</EM> if your program is setuid/setgid.

I think <TT>/usr/bin/no</TT> was (would be) a counterpart to the old

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/no.sh.txt">no.sh.txt</a></tt></p>

with the "no" argument:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>		 /usr/bin/yes no

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I realize this sounds silly and stupid, and April 1st is long past for
this year.  But I'm not kidding.  That Makefile (or whatever) seems to
actually want to pipe an endless stream of "n" or "no" lines into some
other process.  (<TT>/usr/bin/yes</TT> was traditionally used in a pipeline with
fsck to automate the process of repairing a filesystem that need lots
of work -- then they just added the -y option to the GNU/Linux versions

This is a result of binutils being stuck on using old buggy autoconf.

Sat, 7 Jun 2003 15:33:49 -0500
<BR>Chris Gianakopoulos (<a

<P>
Hello Gang,
</P>
<P>
I am now running the <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 8.2 Linux distribution on my main system.  I
use Netscape 4.80 for browsing my machine (locally) using <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> 1.3.27.
</P>
<P>
When first launching Netscape, followed by pressing the "Home" button, I
would get a message indicating that a connection was being established to
localhost.  I would wait for a long time, cancel the connection attempt,
try connecting to my host name (saturn in this case), and then connect to
local host.  Then the connection occurred immediately.
</P>
<P>
I searched the Web and found that something called asyncronous domain
lookups are automatically enabled in Netscape 4.80 by default.  Disabling
this feature fixes my problem.  Here is what I did.
</P>
<P>
edit the file, <TT>/usr/X11R6/bin/communicator</TT>, and place the following line
in the file:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>export MOZILLA_NO_ASYNC_DNS=True
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I changed the environment variable in the above file rather than my .bashrc
because I wanted this to take effect systemwide (and via the various tool
buttons associated with my window manager).
</P>
<P>
So, this might be taken as a 2 cent tip.
</P>
<P>
Regards,
<BR>Chris Gianakopoulos

<P><STRONG>
Is anyone aware of a way to search PDF files that were created from
faxes, e.g. tiff files?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm guessing that OCR has to be utilized here, right?  I've come across
things like pdftotext, but the fact that the PDF started life as a TIFF
is, I think, a complication.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
For the record, I'm putting together a fax server solution for a client.
The ability to search the faxes for text strings would be killer.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
your guess is quite right -- if the pdf contains only a large graphic and no
actual text you would need ocr. gocr:
<A HREF="http://jOCR.sourceforge.net"

<P><DL><DT>
or claraocr:
<DD><A HREF="http://www.claraocr.org"

<P>
...might come in handy (gocr
seems already trained while clara ocr is a quite different method). gocr
produced reasonable results for me already 1 or 2 years back. BUT: I had
clean 300dpi scans. From a jagged looking Fax..... I guess you are facing
serious problems.

<P><STRONG>
Some folks will have noticed me referring people to flat ASCII files
I've squirreled away over the years on my Web server, usually inside
<A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/linux-info"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/linux-info</A> .  While useful, this collection
has always been (1) butt-ugly and (2) disorganised.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've long realised I needed some sort of proper Web framework for all
that material, and Rob Tougher's work updating the Gazette's HTML showed
me how much improvement the addition of cascading stylesheets (CSS) can
bring with only modest effort[1].  All of these thoughts came together
when I ran across PerlHoo, a Yahoo-like Web directory system implemented
in two simple Perl CGI scripts.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please see:  Description by author Jonathan Eisenzopf &lt;<A HREF="mailto:eisen@pobox.com"
	>eisen@pobox.com</A>&gt;
in his series of three articles at Mother of Perl,
<A HREF="http://www.webreference.com/perl/tutorial"
	>http://www.webreference.com/perl/tutorial</A> (recommended reading).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
PerlHoo is simple, malleable, lightweight, fast (up to some thousands of
documents per directory), and can point to URLs on or off your system.
Its design limitations are:
</STRONG></P>

<p><Strong><ul>
<LI>No database support.  Scaling limited by use of system directory
   trees as a data store.

<LI>No searching.

<LI>No multiuser controls or contents versioning / rollback.
</ul></Strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
If you need those things, there's a follow-on called PHPhoo.
Personally, neither wanted nor needed them, and PerlHoo's exactly right
for my needs.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
There were two minor problems with Eisenzopf's design, as I found it
in his most-recent (v. 1.1) tarball:
</STRONG></P>

<p><Strong><ol>
<LI>Sucky URLs.  PerlHoo indexes show up at CGI-synthesised virtual
   directory locations, e.g., <A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/cgi-bin/perlhoo.pl/Apps"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/cgi-bin/perlhoo.pl/Apps</A>
   for the Apps directory of PerlHoo's document tree.  Finding a way to
   substitute something shorter for the "cgi-bin/perloo.pl" portion of
   those URLs would fix several things at once:
</ol></Strong></p>

<p><Strong><ul>
<LI>Simpler, easier-to-remember paths.

<LI>Security-through-obscurity benefit of not advertising your
      use of a CGI script that might be attackable.

<LI>Greater Google-friendliness.  (Google seems not to index as
      enthusiastically trees that give signs of being CGI-generated.)
</ul></Strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Fixing this required use of <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> mod_rewrite to make the undesirable
patch element disappear, and a tiny bit of surgery on PerlHoo itself.
</STRONG></P>

<p><Strong><ol>
<LI>Outdated and somewhat broken HTML.  Eisenzopf's CGI-generated
   pages lack SGML DTDs, closing "body" and "html" tags, and the required
   "ul" pair to go with its use of "li" elements.  The page relies upon
   setting specific colours by their hexadecimal identities, rather than
   using CSS.  It also incorrectly used a nested "p" and "h3" structure
   to attempt physical markup.  I've fixed all of these things, so that
   pages generated by perlhoo.pl are now CSS-oriented and pass the W3C
   validator as HTML 4.01 Transitional.
</ol></Strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Just so other people don't have to reinvent those particular wheels,
I've posted my modified and documented version of PerlHoo at
<A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/apps/"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/apps/</A> .
The tarball includes
full instructions on how to configure Apache, including mod_write .
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My PerlHoo instance, "Linuxmafia Knowledgebase", can now be found at
<A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/kb"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/kb</A> .
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
To answer the other obvious question:  Why, yes, of course I've gotten
Ben Okopnik hooked.  I'm no dummy!  Ben says he's hacked PerlHoo
separately to support individual stylesheets for each directory of
PerlHoo's index, but I've not yet seen the results.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
[1] One difference being that Rob has graphical design talent.  I'm
certainly not trying to denigrate Rob's excellent work.
</STRONG></P>

<P>
There are lots of times when I want to print a text file but don't want
to do it in the Default Ugly Courier font, or want to shrink, say, a
page and a half down to a single page - and word processors are just too
much bother for a simple font/size tweak. Here's a script that lets you
pick font/size combinations until you're satisfied with what you see,
although the fonts are restricted to the AFM types that come with
"enscript" (40 options, more can be added.) I find them to be more than
adequate for my purposes.

Here is a non emergency head scratcher for you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was wondering if anyone has any experience with the Sandisk 256mb
USB flash drive and Linux.  I got the drive to work once, and ever
since it causes a kernel panic. This is not limited by distributions
or hardware, as I have had it work once on a gateway laptop, then ever
after  it would crash any linux machine I plugged it into.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
That's pretty impressive, in a bad way. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> As you know, it's usually
pretty hard to crash Linux. On the other hand, USB is a special case -
for my money, all of its related problems come from the fact that it
brings user-space uncomfortably close to what was always a root-priv
operation (hardware usage, control over ports, etc.) One of the major
reasons for that separation has always been the security truism of
"physical access equals root access" - and with USB, all our noses are
being rubbed in that lesson. However, everybody seems to desperately
want the stuff, so...
</P>
<P>
(USB <EM>is</EM> a nifty technical hack, and serial <EM>is</EM> way outdated - but
giving the average user the ability to effectively fiddle with the guts
of the machine is Not A Good Idea, IMO. Ditto PCMCIA - and note that
there were a few years when it had pretty much the same problems that
USB is going through now. Surprise, surprise...)
</P>
<P>
Not that I don't think it's possible to get it right, mind you; it's
just going to take a bit of finer slicing and dicing than (in my
opinion) we've managed so far... USB under Linux is still highly fragile,
although it can mostly be made to work. Note that I'm talking about the
stuff out on the bleeding edge, things that most people don't use: the
more common run of things (printers, mice, keyboards, etc.) is pretty
stable at this point.
</P>
<P>
However, there are people out there trying to resolve this fragility,
and achieving measurable gains. The important part here is that they
need <EM>your</EM> help - that is, the help of anyone who runs into a problem
with USB. They particularly (I'm projecting, but with a reasonable
degree of certainty) love to hear from folks like you, who have found
what I call a "reliable problem" - this is the core of what makes Linux
work, and why it is generally as bug-free as it has a reputation for.
You have a problem, notify the maintainers about it, they fix the
problem, you give them feedback - and that problem is gone. Repeat until
the code is washed sparkling-clean, and <EM>that</EM> chunk of Linux is
bullet-proof.
</P>
<P>
<EM>SO</EM>, to wrap up this long-winded expository, <EM>please</EM> report this
problem to the appropriate maintainer. You can save a bit of time, and
ease their work tremendously, by running "ksymoops" with the copy of
"<TT>/var/log/kern.log</TT>" that contains the "Oops" from the crash and the
current copy of "<TT>/var/log/ksymoops/[whatever].ksyms</TT>", and sending them
the results - or at least including those two files in the problem
report.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
As I said, this is a general question, I recommend not using Sandisk
to my Linux using companions.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I think it would be better all around if you were to help the
maintainers resolve the problem instead.
