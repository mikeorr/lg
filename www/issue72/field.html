<P>  Linux has several advantages over Windows; it's more stable, 
cheaper (free, if you're able to download it), comes with tons of free 
software and will happily run on systems too small for Windows. So why 
isn't Linux being used on most of the PCs in the world?

<P>  Some would say that the problem is that Linux is too clunky and
difficult to use. While command-line Linux is certainly not for everyone,
modern distributions include self-mounting CDs, drag &amp; drop
functionality and other modern conveniences. There are still some rough
edges to be smoothed out, but for the average web surfer or office worker a
Gnome or KDE desktop is little different than Windows. So, again, why aren't
more people using Linux? Perhaps my experiences will help to explain. The
story you are about to read is true; only the names have been changed to
protect the inept.

<P>  I work in a medium-sized bookstore (20 employees, 2.5+ million a 
year). We are currently using an old DOS based Point of Sale system, but 
there will be a web-based system out next year. Since this new system is 
calling for Windows XP capable PC's for every cash register, this is a 
considerable investment for us. However, I would estimate that we could 
save $300-$400 per terminal in both licenses and reduced hardware costs by 
using Linux instead. It also happens that I needed a portable workstation 
for my desk (I'm trying to develop an email newsletter for our store). So I 
decided to get a laptop to install Linux into, thinking that this would 
give an opportunity to both learn more Linux myself and show off Linux to 
everyone at work - trying to sell my manager on a non-Windows OS. Then, 
when  our new POS system gets up to the sales demonstration stage 
(i.ei; beta test), I'd already have a Linux workstation ready to hook up to
it.  Since it's supposed to be web-based, hopefully one or more of the web
browsers common to Linux should be able to interface with it correctly.
Whether our office server would work using the Apache web server is an
entirely different question, but the individual terminals throughout our
store are supposed to be, basically, web browsers.


<P>  I began by researching different Linux distributions, quickly 
narrowing it down to one of the best known names in Linux, because they 
promised secure server/credit card processing support (which we would 
eventually need for our web-based cash registers) and were actively pushing 
a monthly service and  support contract. Our POS system literally runs our 
whole store, so we can't afford to just lock the doors and send everybody 
home whenever we have a technical problem. I'll call this distribution 
"Commercial Linux", because that's the market they  were clearly aiming for.

<P>  Since I couldn't afford a new laptop, I started looking on eBay 
and finally found an old IBM Thinkpad for under $200 (the low price largely 
due to the lack of a CD-ROM drive). A quick search on Google revealed lots 
of people happily using various flavors of Linux on the exact model I was 
getting. I already knew that Linux can commonly be installed in half a 
dozen different ways - indeed, you can almost tie a wet string between two 
monitors and install it over that - but before bidding I checked with 
"Commercial Linux" and verified that a CD-ROM wasn't listed as a system 
requirement. I also purchased a PCMCIA Ethernet card, again after checking 
with "Commercial Linux's" Hardware Compatibility List and finding it listed 
as both "supported and easily installed".

<P>  I installed "Commercial Linux" on my home desktop PC and was very
impressed with the software. Plug &amp; Play nearly on a par with Microsoft,
a definitely improved desktop, etc. The printer setup would have gone more
smoothly with better instructions, but after a few tries I has able to get
Linux to print. I set up an ftp sever, copied the install files to it and
confidently tried to install "Commercial Linux" into my newly acquired
laptop.

<P>  Plan A: I hooked both desktop &amp; laptop into an Ethernet cable and 
inserted the PCMCIA boot disk into my laptop. I soon found out that my 3com 
PCMCIA card is supported by the Linux kernel, but not by the PCMCIA boot 
disk - not much use with a blank hard disk in my laptop. Neither the 
"Commercial Linux" web site nor their beautifully laid out and well 
illustrated installation manual contains a list of which network cards 
actually are supported by the PCMCIA boot disk.

<P>  Plan B: The "Commercial Linux" on my desktop contains a PLIP 
server and their boot disk contains a PLIP driver. So I hooked up a 
parallel port, ie; laplink cable and tried to do a network install. Guess 
what? "Commercial Linux" doesn't provide any instructions on how to do a 
network install. Their web site doesn't show it, their printed installation 
guide doesn't explain it, and if you email them the question, you'll be 
told that your two months of customer support (for which I paid $80) 
doesn't cover network installs. So I spent a week trying every possible 
option and configuration I could think and never got any connection at all. 
It occurred to me early on that the "Commercial Linux" firewall, which 
their installation software set up by default, was probably cutting off the 
connection. Guess what? The "Commercial Linux" firewall program doesn't 
contain any detailed instructions on how to configure the firewall. I 
searched for "firewall" on "Commercial Linux's" web site. The most current 
listing they had was generic information from three software versions 
earlier. After wasting several more days trying to configure a firewall 
without instructions, I gave up and simply reinstalled my desktop Linux 
without a firewall. I again tried every possible option and configuration I 
could think of on the PLIP server (which - big surprise - also had no 
instructions) and still never got any network connection at all. In 
searching the Internet, I finally found a third party web site that 
mentioned that "Commercial Linux" no longer supports PLIP installs (a fact 
which I confirmed by phoning them, but have never found listed anywhere on 
"Commercial Linux's" own web site).

<P>  Plan C: I could use my trusty Laplink cable to copy the 
installation files into my laptop and simply do a hard drive install. 
Sounds fairly straightforward, right? However, when I tried that, I found 
out several things: While most Linux distributions let you simply copy the 
directory structure onto the target hard drive, "Commercial Linux" makes 
you copy an ISO9660 image file of their entire installation CD onto the 
hard drive. To make matters worse, "Commercial Linux" put some of the 
required packages on their second CD. So you have to copy almost 1.4GB of 
installation files! (Windows 98SE requires less than 400MB, other Linux 
distributions require less than 100MB of installation files for a complete 
desktop system). In my case, my laptop, which exceeds the published system 
requirements, doesn't have enough room for both the "Commercial Linux" 
installation files and the Linux OS both at the same time. At the risk of 
being truly redundant, neither the necessary procedure, nor the list of 
required files, nor the actual disk space requirements were explained on 
"Commercial Linux's" web site or in their installation manual. And when I 
telephoned to ask them about it, their Customer Service people gave me the 
wrong information. Seeking to get some OS on my laptop, I tried Windows 
instead. I had never done a hard drive install of Windows, either, but I 
simply copied the cab files over, clicked "install" and Windows installed 
itself with nary a hiccup.

<P>  Meanwhile, I played with "Commercial Linux" on my desktop. The 
factory CDs contained three different versions of StarOffice: not one of 
them installed correctly. There was no information on their web site as to 
any problem with StarOffice, much less how to fix the problem. A quick 
web search revealed several other irate "Commercial Linux" users who had 
already concluded that StarOffice simply wasn't compatible with the latest 
release of "Commercial Linux". I tried another word processor (again from 
the factory CD). This one installed correctly, but as soon as I launched 
it, it totally locked up my computer - keyboard and all. Warm booting my PC 
destroyed the file system so badly that Linux wouldn't even boot! By this 
point I was beginning to suspect that "Commercial Linux" never bothered to 
test the 3rd party software they ship to see if it even works on their own OS!

<P>  All told, I have asked "Commercial Linux" five installation 
questions. I have received a total of three wrong answers, one flat refusal 
to even discuss my problem and one failure to return an email. And it's not 
just "Commercial Linux", either. I e-mailed four other Linux distributions,
asking each of them if they supported a hard drive install. Two of them never
responded at all, the third one emailed me back the next day saying that they
categorically refused to answer any questions unless I first gave them my
product registration number. Only one Linux distribution actually took the
time to answer my question. (guess which distribution I'm going to buy next
time?).

<P>  In stark contrast, IBM has done a wonderful job of supporting 
their Thinkpad laptops. My 760E was built during the transition between 
Windows 3.x &amp; 95. IBM's web site has a complete set of device drivers for 
both OS's (including software patches for 98), exhaustive documentation, 
installation notes, troubleshooting guides and a search engine that 
actually finds what you're looking for - all freely available for public 
search &amp; download.

<P>  In some respects, Linux already has better documentation than 
Windows ever thought about providing. There is an internal manual ("man 
pages") built into Linux. There are lots of external instructions 
("HOWTOs") written by experienced users, explaining "how to" do all kinds 
things with Linux. Any distribution that cared to could build upon these 
resources and provide expanded and customized help files (specific to their 
own distribution) to answer common questions regarding program operation, 
server set-up, etc. Apparently this idea has never occurred to anyone.

<P>  Perhaps it is because Linux has traditionally been sold to, well, 
basically computer geeks. People who either enjoy tinkering with computers 
as a hobby, or who were already experienced UNIX administers. Consequently, 
I believe that many of the people who make Linux distributions have fallen 
into the practice of thinking: "Okay, we put the software on the CD for 
you. It's not our concern if the software actually works or whether you 
have the information you need to use it. We did our part.  Now send us the 
money". These same people then wonder why they are unsuccessful at selling 
Linux to either the general public or to the small business market.

<P>  Earth calling Software Vendors! It doesn't do any good to 
distribute your software if it doesn't work or if your customers don't have 
the basic details needed to operate it. Here's a couple of really Wild &amp; 
Radical ideas for Linux vendors: first, test the cotton-pickin' software 
before you release it! It may not be possible to test every video driver, 
but it certainly is possible to test if the software you're shipping 
installs into the correct directory and doesn't have any obvious 
incompatibly with the OS. I'm sure many venders try to do this, and
are no doubt caught between the conflicting demands of constant testing 
for reliability and trying to hurry out the latest and greatest software. But 
as a business user, I would far rather wait a few weeks longer for the 
software to be released and have everything <B> work.</B> If smaller 
venders don't have the resources needed for comprehensive testing, 
then please A) note what software hasn't been tested, and B) maybe 
include general installation procedures, directory paths, etc. so users 
have some chance of fixing packages that don't install correctly. 

<P>  Secondly, provide adequate documentation! Let me challenge the 
vendors to a simple test: Take a laptop down to your local community 
college. Go into the Computer Science building and select three or four 
students at random who do NOT know Linux. Offer to buy them all pizza if 
they will attempt to install and/or operate some software for you (based 
only on whatever documentation you provide to your users). If they can't at 
least begin to get a handle on it by the time the pizza is cooked, then YOU 
are not providing enough information! No, I am NOT talking about another 
"Guide to Linux". Linux itself is well documented. The individual 
distributions, however, provide barely enough information to let you 
install them - after that, you're on your own. And most Linux applications 
include a header file saying what the program is intended to do, but giving 
few, if any, clues as to how to get the program to do it. Almost all modern 
software templates include places for both general help files and context 
sensitive help. Few programmers use them. If several of the largest Linux 
vendors made it a policy to not accept 3rd party software unless it 
includes basic built-in documentation, then they could raise the bar for 
the whole Linux community.

<P>  Oh, and my laptop? I downloaded a small distribution off the 
Internet, I'll call it "Mom&amp;Pop Linux", which did know what a hard drive 
install is. Instead of an Installation Manual laid out by a graphic 
designer, they had a typical Linux "HOWTO";i.e., four text pages of friendly 
notes. Following the directions installed Linux flawlessly into my laptop. 
Well, almost flawlessly. It turns out the boot loader in "Mom&amp;Pop Linux" 
doesn't work. It also turns out that they were apparently switching over 
from tarballs to RPMs and, perhaps as a result, I can't load any new 
programs into the laptop. Sigh. Being able to both boot the computer and 
install programs were two things I was really hoping for in an operating 
system. But I did at least prove that Linux can operate on my Thinkpad.

<P>  By this time, I was now two months behind in my project at work. 
Searching through IBM's web site, I learned that the addition of a docking 
station would allow my laptop to have a (non-bootable) CD-ROM drive and a 
(bootable) floppy at the same time. A little more shopping at eBay and I 
found the necessary hardware. This put me 50% over budget, but at last I 
would have a functional Linux laptop!! I happily installed "Commercial 
Linux" from their CDs, already knowing the correct settings for the X 
window setup from my earlier install of "Mom&amp;Pop" Linux. Guess what?? 
"Commercial Linux's" X server doesn't work in my laptop. They list the 
video chip as supported. I double checked all the settings, but all I get 
when I type "startx" is a page and a half of error listings. Based on my 
experience with "Commercial Linux" to date, I have little hope of finding 
the information needed to fix the problem on their web site. And their tech 
support won't even talk to me, because my 60 days of installation support
has expired.

<P>  As far as our bookstore is concerned, I do not currently believe 
Linux to be a viable alternative for any small business. Even if I did, I 
doubt I could ever convince my manager that "Commercial Linux" is capable 
of supporting our office network, since they have already demonstrated that 
they are not capable of supporting an installation into an IBM Thinkpad!

<P> Oddly enough, I still believe that Linux is a good Operating System, 
and I am continuing my search for a functional distribution. But so far, 
the only OS that will actually operate in my Thinkpad is Windows. I would 
rather be running Linux (Indeed, once Windows XP becomes dominant, I will 
have to either run Linux in my laptop or else throw it away). I believe 
there are a lot of other business people who would like to run Linux as 
well. But it's not going to happen until some of the Linux vendors get 
their act together.

<P>  Let me offer an analogy: Suppose you were looking for a car, and 
you heard about this great new sports car that got 50MPG and only cost $5000!
But when you went to buy one, you were told it didn't have any tires, and
there was no alternator (so you had to figure out some other way to keep the
battery charged) and, oh also, don't drive it too fast because the brakes
don't work. And if this car ever breaks, then you'll need to find your own
spare parts and try to fix it yourself, because the dealer that sells the
cars refuses to work on them. Would you buy that car? More importantly, would
you recommend that car to somebody that needs reliable transportation to get
to work tomorrow? Does this sound far-fetched? Well, that's exactly what many
Linux vendors are telling the people who buy their software. Getting back to
my automotive analogy, these same vendors will then loudly complain that
Chevrolet is being unfair because they put radios in their cars as standard
equipment. Well, maybe people aren't buying Chevys because they have built-in
radios. Maybe people are buying Chevys because they have tires and the
dealers are willing to fix the cars if they don't work! Likewise, maybe
people are also buying Windows because it works out of the box (well, mostly
works, anyway), and Microsoft at least <I>tries</I> to offer support when it
doesn't work.

<EM>My first encounter with a computer was when my high school got an
old IBM 1130 (which had a whopping 8k of main memory!), and I've been
playing with computers off and on since then. My first home computer was as
Amstrad, which ran C/PM and came complete with a revolutionary 3" floppy
disk drive (yes, you read that right&lt;g&gt;). Although I've had one college
course each in both C and Linux, I still consider myself a Linux newbie.
However, I am a fan of Linux, and would be delighted to see Linux start
providing some mainstream competition to Microsoft. But doing so will
require more than just technical achievement or even a user-friendly
interface. It will require somebody providing some real customer service
and support.</EM>
