Non-linux machines: any recommendations for this set-up though running on
Windows XP?

You bet: switch to Linux. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Amber, I'm not the world's top expert when it comes to Windows, but I've
got quite a lot of experience and expertise with it under my belt.
Speaking from that perspective and to the best of my knowledge, there
are a few minor things that you can do in this direction - i.e., a pair
of video cards and even multiple keyboards attached to a single CPU -
but all of this hardware is still tied to one session, i.e. one person
using all of it. There are some uses for this type of configuration, but
it's a completely different kettle of fish.
</p>

<p>
As far as creating a robust, serious piece of software that will do this
under Windows, or even a project toward that end, it's simply not going
to happen: Microsoft would need to open-source their OS, and that's not
in the cards. This is one of the many reasons that so many people and so
many companies <em>are</em> switching to Linux: in the world of Open Source, if
you have this kind of a requirement, you can either find someone
somewhere who has already done it (and perhaps fund them to tweak it to
your exact specs) - or you can do it yourself (perhaps by hiring a
little programming muscle if the capability does not exist in-house.)
It's a different - and we believe, better - approach to computing.
</p>

<p>
Best of luck in your search, and we'll be happy to hear from you if you
decide to make the switch at some point in the future.

Hi, great article a couple of questions:
</p>

<p>
1) Is six the limit on X-windows sessions or can it be more - if so how?
</p>
<p>
2) Can you have multi-seat without the graphic cards, keyboards etc? 
Essentially having six or more insulated virtual sessions running at the 
same time. I ask because I have some software that can only run one 
instance per session - if I could get several sessions running on one 
server then this would speed up things nicely - ideally the more the 
merrier and would save me a fortune in servers!
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

<p>
Peter

Have you considered launching multiple sessions? Linux <em>is</em> a
multi-tasking environment, y'know. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Whether it's multiple consoles,
multiple X sessions, multiple chrooted sessions, or multiple virtual
machines (via, say, Xen), there are lots of options. Bob's solution is
important and valuable because it focuses on serving multiple <em>users,</em>
but there's no reason to use extra hardware if you don't need it.

For just starting multiple sessions you can use Xvnc, which does not
require any video hardware at all - you control the virtual screen
parameters (size, color depth, etc.)  It can start as many independent
X sessions as you care to generate within the limits of your machine.
</p>

<p>
There are bunches of VNC clients out there for many different operating
systems, so you can access these X sessions from almost any computer
you have.

The limit should be the number of VGA connectors you can get
on the box.  It is easy to find a AGP video card with two
independent VGA outputs.  Matrox used to make a PCI card with
dual VGA outputs.    The commercial multi-seat vendor, Userful,
supports up to ten seats.

If I understand your question correctly, then, yes, you can have
multiple virtual servers with one box, keyboard and video card.
Look at VMWare or Xen for a way to make one server look like
several.

<p>
BTW: I started this project to help a computer school in Kibre
Mengist, Ethiopia.  The head of the school had said he wanted
to stay with Windows, and at that time the nVidia drivers were
locking up my six-seat system, so I stopped working on the
project.  Recently the head of the school has said that Linux
would be OK if we can get multiple users on a PC.  I've sent
him two books on Ubuntu and I'm restarting work on the project.
