<title mode="escaped" type="text/html">Good day for music</title>
<content mode="escaped" type="text/html" xml:base="http://xpko.blogspot.com" xml:space="preserve">For me at least. At the moment, Headbanger's Ball is on. Alice in Chains &lt;br /&gt;("Them Bones"), Kyuss ("Green Machine"), Down ("Stone the Crow"), and &lt;br /&gt;Refused and Dillenger Escape Plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I did fuck all today. Edited a bit for &lt;a &lt;br /&gt;href="http://linuxgazette.net"&gt;Linux Gazette&lt;/a&gt;, but that was about it. &lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I went to Joe's house to play some music. After a &lt;br /&gt;shameful showing, trying to play RATM (we were able to play all 4 Rage &lt;br /&gt;albums last time we practised... about 2 years ago), we tried some metal &lt;br /&gt;and hit our groove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Joe switched from bass to guitar, and after showing him a few &lt;br /&gt;Carcass riffs ("No Love Lost" and "Heartwork") we tried a riff of mine, &lt;br /&gt;which he had no end of trouble with 2 years ago when we tried it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it was "new" to him, and possibly because of his trial by metal &lt;br /&gt;fire (trying to play bass for my friend Trev's band), he showed actual &lt;br /&gt;interest in a song that has time changes, a timing oddity at the start &lt;br /&gt;(song is in 4/4, but the first bar is the verse riff in 3/4), and a &lt;br /&gt;lengthy lead at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh! "Thieves" by Ministry is on now. Truly with this metal you are &lt;br /&gt;spoiling me MTV2. One of these days I'll buy that "In case you didn't &lt;br /&gt;feel like showing up...live" video).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent most of the evening learning how to play guitar standing up, &lt;br /&gt;playing through an amp, today. It only hit me just how out of practise I &lt;br /&gt;am a few months ago, when I went to Rory's house and tried it then -- &lt;br /&gt;I've spent a lot of time playing guitar in the last year and a half &lt;br /&gt;since I last had my amp, but it was mostly just playing along to CDs. It &lt;br /&gt;was no big deal to me to sell my amp back to Joe (though I did need the &lt;br /&gt;money for a phone bill) six months ago, which should have been a warning &lt;br /&gt;sign, but wasn't. It was only when I was in Rory's attic, unable to play &lt;br /&gt;riffs I should have known that it hit me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... well, at least I know I can solo at the drop of a hat, but I need &lt;br /&gt;to relearn a lot of riffs, and write some new riffs. But things are &lt;br /&gt;still looking up.&lt;br /&gt;</content>

<title mode="escaped" type="text/html">New shift</title>
<content type="application/xhtml+xml" xml:base="http://xpko.blogspot.com" xml:space="preserve">
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As of Saturday, I changed shifts at work. Joe arranged it - he<br/>originally intended to join my shift - so we can start a band. So I<br/>was on nights instead of days. Bit of a culture shock, to go from my<br/>former shift to this - my previous supervisor is laid back, and<br/>doesn't mind what we do so long as the work is done, but my new<br/>supervisor has rules for everything, and has no problem eating the<br/>heads off anyone who breaks them.<br/>
<br/>It was OK though, until 12am yesterday, when I was cutting something<br/>and picked up the wrong knife. I thought I had a blunt knife, and put<br/>a good bit of effort into cutting, and the knife ended up halfway<br/>through my knuckle. It seems I'll have to go to the factory doctor to<br/>see about getting stitches, because the damn thing bleeds any time I<br/>move my hand.<br/>
<br/>At least it'll make it easier to turn my back on the place in January,<br/>as I've been planning.<br/>

I had taken two weeks holidays to spend with him, but found out after I had booked them that his mother is taking him to Germany next week - they're going tomorrow, in fact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul was going to go for a drive anyway, so he offered to bring us. I decided to buy a digital camera for the heck of it, so I have photos... yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent most of my pay for three weeks between that, and drinking for my birthday Saturday &amp; Sunday - Saturday was a disaster, so I had to have a do-over. After having a brief panic attack at work last Thursday, after misreading my ATM statement, I ended up broke anyway. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My birthday ended up being a disaster because a) most of the lads were waiting for Sunday night (band holiday weekend), and b) Jimmy, who came down from Limerick for it, ended up getting arrested - I bumped into some girl in the club, she decided to blame Jimmy for whatever strange reason, her friends stuck by her, and he fucked them all out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to make peace, thought it had worked, and thought nothing else of it. Afterwards, I was chatting up some girl, and was just looking for a pen to get her number, when one of the friends of the girl from the club spotted Jimmy, and they tore into each other. One of the other guy's friends tried to put the boot in, so I went over and pushed him away, and told him to leave them to their own fight, if he wanted a fight, I'd give him one. The coward wasn't interested in that, and walked away. I turned around, and Jimmy and the other guy are being dragged away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, better than most years, I think?&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;!-- The Image &amp; --&gt;		&lt;!-- Image Title, Uploaded by --&gt;		&lt;td style="padding-left:10px;vertical-align:top;"&gt;			&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=161003" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.flickr.com/photos/161003_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  			&lt;br /&gt;				&lt;span style="font-size: 90%; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;			&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo.gne?id=161003"&gt;PHTO0011: Mark in Dublin Zoo, 2nd August&lt;/a&gt;			&lt;br /&gt;			Originally uploaded by 			&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/49502976979@N01/"&gt;jimregan&lt;/a&gt;.			&lt;/span&gt;		&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</content>

<br/>
<br/>"I know you are being good-humoured about it, but I think it's vital 
<br/>that there is something that holds the crew together," said Carrot, 
<br/>still calmly sewing.
<br/>"Yes, it's called skin. It's important to keep all of you on the inside 
<br/>of it."
<br/>
<br/>Rincewind stared at the badge. He'd never had one before. Well, that was 
<br/>technically a lie ... he'd had one that said 'Hello, I Am 5 Today!', 
<br/>which was just about the worst possible present to get when you are six.
<br/>
<br/>Here was a man who had truly seen life, mostly on the point of departure.
<br/>
<br/>"Well, if you're not going to expect unexpected flames, what's the point 
<br/>of going anywhere?"
<br/>
<br/>Archchancellor Ridcully decided that the crew needed to be trained. 
<br/>Ponder Stibbons pointed out that they were going into the completely 
<br/>unexpected, and Ridcully ruled therefore that they should be given some 
<br/>unexpected training.
<br/>Rincewind, on the other hand, said that they were heading for certain 
<br/>death, which everyone managed eventually with no training whatsoever.
<br/>
<br/>Lord Vetinari was not a man who delighted in the technical. There were 
<br/>two cul­tures, as far as he was concerned. One was the real one, the 
<br/>other was occupied by people who liked machinery and ate pizza at 
<br/>unreasonable hours.
<br/>
<br/>"I have to tell you that I'm not sure that they have enough time or 
<br/>power to get back on to the Disc now."
