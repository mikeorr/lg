<p><strong>From Jay Gerard on 17 Nov 1998  
<A HREF="news:"></A></strong></p>
<!-- begin 16 -->
<P><STRONG>
I am a sometime writer and CBT (Computer Based Training) developer. In
1994 I wrote a CBT course, "UNIX for DOS Users." Time to upgrade the
course and remove the DOS comparisons.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What I am <EM>not</EM> is a UNIX expert. To gather enough experience/knowledge
to write the original course I installed Coherent -- a UNIX clone -- on
a PC, bought some books and asked a lot of questions.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What I would like to do now -- through this newsgroup -- is to ask some
questions. I'm hoping that some people here will be willing to answer --
either through the group or via personal email to me. So, here are some
questions.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1) In 1994, the Bourne shell was the most widely used. Is this still
true? Are some shells more suitable for particular applications? For
particular environments? (E.g. - - do universities tend to favor one
shell?)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>The Bourne family of shells is still somewhat more
common than csh and tcsh.  On Linux the most popular
shell, and the one used by default is bash (a Bourne/Korn
clone from the FSF).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
2) Does Linux offer a variety of shells? Does it use a proprietary
shell? (BTW, is it pronounced "LIE-nux" or "LINN-ux" or ???)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Yes.  Every shell that is commonly available for other
forms of Unix are available for Linux.  Here's a
small list:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
ash, bash, pdksh, ksh88, ksh9x, tcsh, zsh
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
3) What uses are there for UNIX on a personal (stand-alone) box?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
There are a number of games and applications that are
available for Unix.  In particular we find that Linux
is spurring development of free and commercial productivity
and personal apps.  For example <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> 
and <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> have
numerous games and small apps.  While KDE and GNOME are
also portable to other forms of Unix, and much of the
development was done on <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> 
and other platforms ---
they are strongly associated with Linux.  (Fairly or
not is a flamewar all its own).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
WordPerfect has been available for Linux for a few years
--- and Corel has released new versions very recently.
In addition <a href="http://www.corel.com/">Corel</a> is 
committed to releasing their
entire office suite for Linux.  Hopefully this will run
under the FreeBSD/Linux compatability libraries as well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are more different applications suites available
for Unix/Linux than there are for Windows (since MS has
squeezed out almost all of the competition in that market).
So we have our choice among StarOffice, Applixware,
SIAG (free, "Scheme in a Grid"), LyX (free, LaTeX GUI/front
end), and others.

Not in Linux.  There are SVGAlib programs and
there are at least two (relatively obscure) alternative

The most active avenues of Linux/FreeBSD GUI development
these days are:

6) Are "Open Look" and "Motif" still common? In widespread use?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
OpenLook essentially died.  You can still find and use
the toolkits and window manager but it was the loser in
the first great Unix GUI war.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Motif is nominally still the "standard" for commercial
Unix --- however, the GTK (GNU toolkit and widget set)
is starting to take over the freenix flavors.  GTK is
the underlying library set for the GIMP (a popular
freenix image manipulation and graphics package), and
for GNOME (the GNU Network Object Model Environment project
--- which is in early stages of development and will
provide Unix users with a full suite of CORBA/GTK applications
and utilities for their desktop environments).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In commercial world CDE (built over Motif) is supposed
to be the standard.  However most of the serious Unix
users I know basically work around CDE rather than with or
in it.  In the freenix community, KDE is out and available
--- and subject to some controversy (since it currently
relies upon a set of libraries that's only partially
"free" --- a bit of hairsplitting that concerns programmers
ISV's and distribution integrators and vendors).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
KDE and CDE aren't really comparable.   They serve different
purposes.  However, superficially they offer similar appearance
(although these days most GUI's look alike anyway).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
7) What per cent of UNIX users/installations use a GUI?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
I have not idea.  I gather that about 70% or more
of the Linux user base primarily uses their GUI's
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One glitch in any such statistic would be the ratio
of "server" machines to workstations.  Very few
organizations use character cell terminals these days
--- many use Windows systems as ethernet terminal
emulators to talk to their Unix systems and
mainframes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a chance that the Netwinders and similar (Linux/Java
based) NC's will see significant deployment in banks, retail
sites (like automotive parts and pizza counters, etc).  This
is due to their low cost, extremely small footprint, low
energy consumption and heat dissipation, quiet operation and
practically non-existent maintenance requirements.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
8) Are there installations which use both a GUI and the standard
character-based interface?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Yes.  I use them at my office.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
9) What is your opinion as to the usefulness/practicality of a GUI in
UNIX now. In the future?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Who cares?  Why so much focus on the GUI's?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I personally use text mode for most work.  I mostly
work in my text editor (which is also my mail and
newsreader).  I usually use Lynx to browse the web,
because I'm usually interested in the content -- the
text.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I usually keep one or two X sessions running on each of my
systems (one running as me, another running under my
wife's account).  I switch out of them to do most of
my work, and into them to use Netscape Navigator,
xdvi and/or gv (TeX/DVI and PostScript previewers), and
'xfig' (a simple drawing program) when I need those.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I use 'screen' (a terminal multiplexer utility) which allows
me to detach my work from one terminal/virtual console
and re-attach to it from any other.  This lets me yank
my editor/mail/news session into an 'xterm' or yank it
from there and unto my laptop/terminal in the living room
(it's a home office).  That's how I watch CNN and TV
when I want to.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of the reasons I adopted Linux is because I prefer
text mode screens and keyboard driven programs to GUI's.
It lets me work my way --- rather than trying to
make me work "its" way.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In answer to your question:  You really need to do
some research at the sites that I've listed.  Linux and
freenix is poised to completely wipe Microsoft from the
desktops of the world in the next few years.  The fact
that every major magazine in the industry has been recently
saying "Linux can't take over the desktop" is lending
initial credibility to the idea.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was an absurd idea a year ago.  But all the work on KDE,
GNOME, GNUStep, the growing support by 
<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>, Applix, Star
Division, and the hints of interest by Compaq, Intel, and
others clearly point to a Linux future on the desktop.  (In
this regard I must point out that FreeBSD is every bit as
viable technically --- and that it will certainly gain a
sliver of that marketshare as well, probably not nearly as
much as it deserves --- Linux has more "mindshare").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
CNN had a three minute segment on Linux running every
hour all weekend.  See my report on Linux Today at:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A HREF="http://www.linuxtoday.com/stories/867.html"
	>http://www.linuxtoday.com/stories/867.html</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... for details.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The problems with Unix were typically in the bickering
and licensing between the major vendors (most of them
hardware manufacturers whose primary interest was in
"trapping" a segment of the market).  Technically it
has always been a pretty good choice.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another problem with Unix over a decade ago was the lack of
power in the early micros.  You could not support a credible
Unix on anything less powerful than a 386 with about 16Mb
of RAM and about 300Mb of disk space.  Once you get past
that threshold (about 1990 was when these systems saw
significant consumer deployment) you saw reasonably rapid
development of Linux and FreeBSD.  (Linux was publicly
available in late '91 to early '92 --- I've been using it
since late '92 to early '93.  386BSD, by Mr. and Mrs. Jolitz
was further along in development by that point --- and FreeBSD
appeared around that time).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In any event, the usefulness of the various GUI's under
Unix are equal to those for any other platform.  The only
thing that isn't "all there" is the ability to readily share
documents with MS Office applications.  Anyone who thinks
that this is not do to a deliberate effort on the part of
Microsoft is delusional.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
MS executives and developers would have to be IDIOTS not to
see the strategic importance of "one-way" document
interoperability --- of the value of "locking in" their
customers to "cross sell" their OS products.  They would be
remiss in their fiscal responsibilities if they'd failed
to use that to the advantage of their shareholders.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Note: number one dilemma of corporate capitalism ---
shareholders have priority over customers, number two is the
inevitability of over-capacity and number three is the
necessity for anti-trust regulation and government to moderate
monopolies and cartels.  Sorry, but over capacity and
monopoly are systemic in our economy --- the rules predispose
the trend towards them, eventually and inevitably).

10) From the "probably-off-the-wall department": Is there a site where I

If you have a PC (or a Mac), use Linux.  Then install FreeBSD
(or <A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A> for your Mac).  
There is <EM>no</EM> reason (excuse) to
try to write a tutorial on Unix without getting some hands on
experience.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In answer to your question, there are numerous "freenet"
and "pain" (Public access internet nodes) sites around.
They tend not to advertise for obvious reasons.
