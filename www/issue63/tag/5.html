hi
<br>i wonder if you could help?.

<br>i am running a mail/internet server with the red hat linux (6.2)  operating
system.  Viruses are getting through the end user via emails and are spread
over my local area network.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1) is there any anti virus software that i can get for the linux box?

Yes, but I don't know the names offhand.  Check previous issues of The
Answer Gang, News Bytes, the <em>LG</em> search page, and 
<a href="www.securityportal.com">www.securityportal.comi</a>.

Yes.  I'm operating on the assumption that your linux box is the hub through
which all mail is received, maybe even the only place that mail really comes
to, because the typical Windows or Mac client uses POP.

Mind you, most of these require that you have the linux version of one of
the commercial vendors' antivirus apps, or, they're meant to deal with problems
which usually break the clients (e.g. poor MIME construction, etc).  At least
one of the commercial vendors has a complete solution for us though... and
a handful of other 'Ix flavors too:

...and in case anyone is wondering whether it only works on RH, I have a
few clients who got it working on <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> and seem pretty happy with it.

For those who prefer to go with all free parts, I have to note, VACina
(a sourceforge project) isn't very far along, and anti-spam stuff can be
twisted only so far if you aren't planning to become an antivirus engineer
on your own.

2) the option of buying software for each machine wipes my budget out.
preferably the solution that i would like would be to stop the virus at
the server.

<EM>That</EM> shouldn't be a problem, the stuff I described above works at the
server level.  I have to warn you though, thaat I used to work in the
antivirus field, and until those macro viruses (yeah, viruses ... the
biological ones are virii) came around, the vast percentage of infections
were from accidental boots off a floppy.  There's also a type of virus
that is carried in programs, but as soon as given a chance, hits the boot
sector too.  So going without some sort of resident checker, or if that's
too much, then a downtime window where your staff goes through and checks
all the machines, is not really doing a complete job.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A school I did a bunch of work with solved the problem in their labs in this
way:  every evening when the lab closed, they'd go around with a spot checker
and take notes what was found.  They didn't waste time cleaning any, they
just reformatted and reinstalled the OS from a network image.  (Among other
things, that way they didn't have to worry if they missed some new breed.)
But they posted the note on the wall, how many viruses were found the night
before.  They also made it easy for students to spot check their disks.  Of
course, the school had an educational license to the AV software.  You can
think of this as the "free clinic" style of solving it, if you like... though
real illnesses, sadly, can't be solved by reformatting the human.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But, I can't say what your budget really is.  In the end, you'll have to
decide if you want to spend more time or more money.

Everyone else wondering about solutions for their virus ills in a mixed
environment, surely thanks you for asking, Jugs.  Good luck in the battle!
