Hello Ben,
</p>

<p>
I thought you might be interested in the information below on a
six-year-old virus that is still causing problems for Linux users.  In
fact, the problem is so common that 70 percent of Linux infections are
because of the virus.  In response to this problem, Sophos has made
available a free detection tool for Linux users to determine if they are
infected by the virus. 
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in discussing this virus with Sophos, don't hesitate
to contact me.  
</p>

<p>
Best,
</p>

<p>
      Six Year Anniversary for Linux Virus Rst-B - Are You Infected?
</p>

<p>
          Sophos Makes Available Detection Tool for Linux Users
</p>

<p>
IT security and control firm Sophos is warning Linux users of the
importance of properly securing their Linux systems, following findings
from SophosLabs(TM) that a long established threat, known as Linux/Rst-B,
is still infecting computers and servers.
</p>

<p>
Analysis of malware has shown almost 70 percent of the infections are due
to this six-year-old malicious program. Today, SophosLabs has made freely
available a small detection tool to help Linux users find out whether they
are unwittingly infected with this virus.
</p>

<p>
Linux servers are very valuable to hackers, according to SophosLabs
experts. Servers, by their nature, are rarely turned off and often found
to be running no or insufficient protection against malware attacks. This
makes the Linux systems ideal candidates for the role of controller in a
botnet - the central control point when creating and managing an army of
infected computers, known as bots or zombies. Where Linux systems are most
often found to be running as a server, Windows machines are more
frequently used at home or as a desktop machine in an office, and these
computers are regularly switched off. This makes them less attractive as
controllers, but ideal as bots or zombies.
</p>

<p>
Hackers typically gain control via weak SSH password or some other
vulnerability. Once in, they install IRC based malware and use IRC
channels to control their bots.
</p>

<p>
"The number of malware in existence is around 350,000, and while only a
teeny number of these target Linux, it seems as though hackers are taking
advantage of this false sense of security," said Carole Theriault, senior
security consultant at Sophos. "It was very surprising to see that a
six-year-old virus seems to be responsible for a large proportion of the
malware collating in our Linux honeypot, and we hope that Linux users who
aren't running security will at least run this tool to find out if they
are infected with this granny virus."
</p>

<p>
Information on the Linux/Rst-B detection tool is available on the
SophosLabs blog. Sophos underlines that running the detection tool will
only detect versions of Linux/Rst-B.

<h3>Unwanted software</h3>

Quoting Mike Orr (sluggoster@gmail.com):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Found this in the EULA for MSN Messenger accounts:
&gt; 
&gt; """
&gt; Potentially Unwanted Software
&gt; 
&gt; If you remove or disable "spyware", "adware"  and other potentially
&gt; unwanted software ("potentially unwanted software"), it may cause
&gt; other software on your computer to stop working, and it may cause you
&gt; to breach a license to use other software on your computer (such as
&gt; where the other software installed the potentially unwanted software
&gt; on your computer as a condition for your use of the other software).
&gt; By using the features of the service intended to help you remove or
&gt; disable potentially unwanted software, it is possible that you will
&gt; also remove or disable  software that is not potentially unwanted
&gt; software. If a feature of the service prompts you before removing or
&gt; disabling potentially unwanted software, you are solely responsible
&gt; for selecting which potentially unwanted software the service removes
&gt; or disables.  Before authorizing the removal of any potentially
&gt; unwanted software, you should read the license agreements for the
&gt; potentially unwanted software.
&gt; """
&gt; 
&gt; LICENSE AGREEMENTS for spyware???  I'm supposed to recognize what kind
&gt; of spyware has been surreptitiously been installed on my computer, and
&gt; know where its license agreement is?
&gt; 
&gt; Fancy Microsoft discouraging people from eradicating spyware, and
&gt; threatening them with a potential license violation if they do.
</pre>

<p>
You're misreading what they're saying, here, and in consequence being a
bit unfair to our Redmondian friends.
</p>

<p>
They're saying that MSN Messenger service includes some <em>anti-spyware</em>
features that might, in the process of doing its job, might accidentally
disable some process you <em>want</em> to have continue to run.  It says that
the anti-spyware system monitor will pop up a screen asking you to vet 
what it wants to disable, and the responsibility's totally on you if you
say "yes" and end up turning off something you later regret having
disabled.
</p>

<p>
This reflects, in part, the pernicious way in which legitimate
MS-Windows software has become at best poorly distinguishable from
adware/spyware, and it's not unknown for the one to come bundled with
the other, and for various (nominally legitimate) proprietary software
packages to "phone home" information about the user, permission for
which chicanery the user usually but not always has "consented to"
(nominally) via misleadingly worded clauses in their licence agreements.
</p>

<p>
For perspective, it's also not unknown for this sort of treacherous
behaviour to occur in proprietary applications for Linux.  That's why,
for example, my nameserver resolves the "remoteapproach.com" domain
locally, because, even though I wouldn't touch Adobe Acrobat Reader with
a ten-foot pole or an 11-foot Swede, visitors to my house sometimes do.

<h3>Version control for /etc</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://thomas.apestaart.org/thomas/trac/wiki/projects/savon">https://thomas.apestaart.org/thomas/trac/wiki/projects/savon</a> has:
<pre class='code'>
  What is Savon? 
 
  Savon is a program that allows you to store parts of a file system in
  Subversion. It manages file contents, permissions, owner and group (by
  name, not by id), and even SELinux security context. Layers allow re-use
  of files among different hosts.
 
  The command-line tool, savon, tries to follow svn in spirit as closely
  as possible in expected behaviour, output, ... Of course, there are
  different commands for the additional functionality, but your knowledge
  of svn will carry over into your use of savon. (One important exception
  is the add command, which is non-recursive by default. svn chose to make
  this recursive, in contrast to CVS, and many a user has made the mistake
  of adding a whole subtree to subversion when they just wanted one
  directory added.)
 
  What can I use it for? 
 
      * Use it to store configuration files, scripts, and other local
        modifications for your one or more Unix hosts
      * Use it to manage clusters of machines that share roles and can
        thus share configuration from one central repository
      * Use it to store the same type of information from your user
        directory, again allowing you to share parts of these directory
        layouts among multiple machines 
 
  High-level overview 
 
  Savon allows you to manage a part of your file system in an overlay.
  This part can be the whole filesystem or root, or your home directory,
  or something else.
 
  This overlay is split up into one more more layers. The layers are
  stacked top to bottom to represent the tree of revisioned nodes. If a
  node is present in more than one layer, the version in the top-most
  layer is used.
 
  Typically, you would use a separate overlay for each host, and then
  share common files in a layer. For example, on my home network, but also
  on hosts of family and friends I maintain, I use the bottom-most layer
  for files that should be the same on all hosts. This includes for
  example authorized_keys for ssh, so that I can log in to every machine.
  The layer above that is used for files that are related to the local
  network configuration; for example, yum configuration files pointing to
  local directories.
 
  The top-level layer gets used for the host-specific files, including
  interface definitions, a host ChangeLog, ...
 
  Having separate layers thus makes it easy to share configuration and
  files between machines. 
</pre>

<p>
A fellow Linux user group mailing list member speculated that Savon
might be more suitable than Joey Hess's etckeeper for non-.deb-based
systems such as RHEL / CentOS / Mandrake / PCLinuxOS / Gentoo / etc.,
because etckeeper is hooked into apt/dpkg so as to capture changes to /etc
resulting from package operations.  Having not tried etckeeper on a non-.deb
system, I couldn't speak to that, but pass along his comment.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Joey has merged patches that permit etckeeper to be
back-ended by Mercurial, so one can now elect that version control
system rather than git, if one prefers.

I usually leave file names as they are unless I have reason to suspect
something nasty in them (like a forward slash, which is the only
character that's not allowed in filenames - at least in Unix). If I'm
going to process them at all, I make it simple:
</p>

<pre>
tr/A-Za-z0-9/_/cs;
</pre>

<p>
This replaces any characters that don't appear in the first list with an
underscore, and squashes any repeated underscores. If I'm feeling
especially energetic, I might add the following:
</p>

<pre>
s/^_?(.*?)_?$/$1.html/;
</pre>

<p>
This will remove any leading/trailing underscores from the result. It's
also a good place to add the '.html' extension.

<p>
This last line may be standard practice in C, etc., but it's unnecessary
(and deprecated) in Perl. The same is true for the parens in your
'open', 'close', and 'rename' calls: punctuation that doesn't have a
specific reason for being there should be omitted.

Hello,
</p>

<p>
I have a directory named "Book Reviews", so when I try to CD to it using:
</p>

<pre>
$ cd /media/sda5/Writings\ \&amp;\ Presentations/Book Reviews
</pre>

<p>
I get:
</p>

<pre>
bash: cd: /media/sda5/Writings &amp; Presentations/Book: No such file or directory

<p>
of course, I do not have a directory named 'Book'
</p>

<p>
I then come across this
<a href="http://librenix.com/?inode=7041">http://librenix.com/?inode=7041</a>

<p>
I got away with it after using:

$ cd /media/sda5/Writings\ \&amp;\ Presentations/"Book Reviews"

<p>
Is there any other way other to deal with spaces?

Sir,

<p>
	I have visited your web-site for squid configuration reference. It's
really helpful for me. Because i'm new to squid. Also i'm having a doubt
regarding squid. The main purpose of the squid is load-balancing &amp;
security which hides our webserver from outside world. I'm going to put
a two web server behind my squid. Where can I mention my web servers in
squid configuration. and how I can test that my squid is refering my two
servers if it's not having the cache. Please let me to know about it.
I'm using squid 2 as my reverse proxy and Apache as my web servers with
platform RHEL 4 u 4.  Thanking you,

<p>
I have done a fair bit of my own "second guessing of the user" in the 
past, and where it comes to the g++ folks they generally get it right.  
Be that as it may, there is a rather irritating  and dangerous 
compile-time warning in g++ version 4.1.2.  that is to me, an ideal 
example of where acting with the best intention to protect the user from 
his own stupidity can backfire.
</p>

<p>
A pure virtual base class, or interface class definition is used when 
one would like to use the class definition without having access in any 
way to the implementation.  Typically, a factory function creates 
objects of this type, and another factory function may be used to 
destroy them.  One cannot use the 'new' keyword to create, or the 
'delete' keyword to destroy objects of this type, as the object 
definition has no public constructor or destructor, and no base 
implementation for the virtual methods.  However, one may call the 
objects methods; since they are all pure virtual declarations, one is 
guaranteed of their implementation in the subclass.
</p>

<p>
The following header is used to provide a pure virtual interface class 
and functions to create or delete instances of the class:
</p>

<pre>
class abc {
  public :
     virtual void if_method1()=0;
     virtual long if_method2()=0;
     virtual bool if_method3()=0;
     ...
};
 
abc *abc_factory_new();
void abc_factory_delete(abc *);
</pre>

<p>
when compiled, this emits the warning:
   ``  warning: 'class abc' has virtual functions but non-virtual 
destructor''
</p>

<p>
which is only partially true, as there is no declaration for a 
destructor at all (either virtual or non-virtual).  One might expect the 
following code to emit warnings both for the attempt to create an 
instance of 'abc' as well as the attempt to delete 'abc':
<pre>
int main() {
  abc *a = new abc();
  delete a;
}
</pre>

<p>
As it happens, we are warned when we try to create an instance of 'abc' 
(because of all the pure virtual functions) , but not warned at all when 
we delete the object directly.  It would appear that g++ assumes that 
the coder has made a mistake, and creates a default (public non-virtual) 
destructor for the class anyway, regardless that we excluded definitions 
for the destructor to prevent accidental deletion.  To add insult to 
injury, g++ then warns the coder that his [automatic] destructor is not 
virtual.
</p>

<p>
Just as well that it does warn you, since the destructor it 
automatically creates is not virtual, and therefore invoking delete 
against the virtual base class (which should have failed with a compiler 
error) would result in a potential memory leak.
</p>

<p>
The above warning is not a new one, and previous versions of the 
compiler would emit the warning when a destructor was declared as 
non-virtual in a class with virtual method declarations.  For example,

&lt;<a href="../lg.rss&gt;">http://linuxgazette.net/lg.rss&gt;</a>. Since I know that updates only happen
once a month, I don't include LG in the regular refresh list, but check
it manually the first few days of each month until I get the update.
</p>

<p>
However, for the past four months, there have not been any dates on the
items in that feed. Therefore I have a mixed list with items from
multiple months and no useful way to sort it by date. Is that an issue
with the feed, or something on my end?
</p>

<p>
I do enjoy the Gazette. Although I started with SLS 1.02, I have been
using Slackware at home since '93, and Red Hat/Fedora at work for the
past two years. Unfortunately, we only have one small department using
Linux and have to struggle with MS-Windows for company wide tools.

<p>
Thank you,

Hey Everyone,
  A friend of mine asked the following question and as far as I know its 
not possible but if I am wrong please correct me.
</p>

<p>
  Basically what he wants to do is share files with windows systems over 
samba (with write/delete access) and restrict the number of files a user 
can delete at a time. So if a user (suramya) wanted to delete 2 files 
the system would let him delete it, but if he tried to delete 50 files 
it would stop it.
</p>

<p>
  What do you think? Is it possible? What I told him was that either you 
give a user delete access or not but you can't limit by the number of files.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way I have found to remove delete access is to remove the 
write access to the parent directory containing the files. But the 
downside of this is that the users can't add new files. In this case 
since the users are programmers they have to have the ability to add new 
files to the directory.
</p>

<p>
So what are his options?
</p>

Hi Ramon,
</p>

<p>
I didn't get round to discuss much of what you wrote with Daniel (Main
Admin around here). He keeps himself busy with fixing multiseat
machines  which got broken by upgrades....
 
As a first decision we are going to put out an order for a large
disk-raid system (max 24TB, initially 18 for budget reasons) which
we'll run as NFS fileserver and it will have to double as
backupsystem (two independent raid controllers) backing itself up,
configs from all clients and some smaller data amounts on local disks
plus homes on the then old fileserver.
</p>

<p>
If that disk space runs full we'll have hopefully new budget and can
think about tape solutions etc. Right now raw disc space is getting
scarce. 
</p>

<p>
The number crunchers are still not quite certain --- the Multicore AMD
is still on the wishlist, but delivery seems to be postponed and
postponed again. 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; If you're willing, we could also set up a call to discuss or 
&gt; alternatively use IRC ?
&gt; There's way too many options depending on setup discussion etc.
</pre>

<p>
Yes, I certainly would like to discuss a few things to see what might
be optimal solutions. 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; We've been through 4 generations of storage architecture including 
&gt; on-line but off-site backup.
</pre>


<p>
that "off-site" part is starting to worry me a bit. We have some
off-site backup but not everything by far. Mostly homes and the most
important written stuff (Programs, papers, etc.). Original measurement
data are just to huge for that off-site backup (*non* GB ethernet
doesn't help there).
</p>


<p>
K.-H.
