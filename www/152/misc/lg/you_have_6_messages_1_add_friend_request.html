That's perfect for getting more volunteers! "Just join TAG and you get
lots of friends." I didn't know that spammers were into positive
thinking and motto creation.

Well, that social network got blackholed at my MTA about a minute after
we received the "friend notice", so cherish the friendship, since that
variety won't recur here..  (Ben, if we publish this thread, I'd suggest
blanking out the name of the outfit, so we don't give them free
publicity.)

That's our usual policy - capably implemented by our Mailbag Editor.
Just one of those bits where procesing can't be automated...
