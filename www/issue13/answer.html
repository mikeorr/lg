<h3><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
Combining modems for more speed
</h3>
Date: Mon, 23 Dec 1996 23:37:00 -0800 (PST) <br>
From: liberty@pe.net (Keith) <br>
<p> 
Thanks for reading this post. I have heard that it's possible to set up
Linux to combine two analog modems into one so as to double the speed of
a connection. Is this true, how does this work and where can I get more
info, guidance, how-to, etc.? I have Slackware 96 from Infomagic.
Your truly, 
Keith Bell

	I've heard of this as well.  I've never used it but
	let's look it up...
<p>
	Ahh... that would be the EQL option in the kernel.  
	Here's an excerpt from the 'make menuconfig' help pages
	(in the 2.0.27 kernel sources):
<p>
 <b>Linux Kernel v2.0.27 Configuration</b>
 <p>
  	EQL (serial line load balancing) support: <br>
   If you have two serial connections to some other computer (this      
   usually requires two modems and two telephone lines) and you use    
   SLIP (= the protocol for sending internet traffic over telephone    
   lines) or PPP (= a better SLIP) on them, you can make them behave       
   has to be supported at the other end as well, either with a similar   
   EQL Linux driver or with a Livingston Portmaster 2e. Say Yes if you    
   want this and read drivers/net/README.eql. 
<p>
So that file is : <br>

Dialup Problem
</h3>
Date: Tue, 31 Dec 1996 05:13:51 -0800 (PST) <BR> 
From: <A HREF="mailto:gekko@midusa.net">gekko@midusa.net</A><BR>
<P>
I don't know if you can, or even are willing, help me witha  problem i
have.  I'm running redhat 4.0, on a p120 w/24 megs of ram, kernel 2.0.18
<blockquote> <b> 
	I'm willing.
</b> </blockquote> 
anyway...i have this ppp connection problem and no I know knows what the
problem is, i've looked through the FAQS, HOWTO's, tried #linux on irc,
etc etc...no one knows what my problem is, so now i'm desperate.
<P>
When i try to dial my isp, i get logged in fine, but its REALLY slow.
i'm using the 'network module' ppp thing in control panel on X.
mru=1500, asyncmap=0,speed=115000, i couldn't find a place to insert
mtu, and when i tried putting that in /etc/ppp/options the script this
program was using wouldn't work.
<blockquote> <B> 
	Usually I see these symptoms when there is an IRQ
	conflict.  Some of the data gets through -- with lots
	of errors and lots of retransmits but any activity on the
	rest of the machine -- or even just sitting there --
	and you get really bad throughput and very unreliable
	connections.
</B> </blockquote> 
I noticed that after i input something and then move the cursor off of
the windows, it runs at a much faster speed, and it gets annoying moving
the cursor back and forth.
I tried dip, minicom, and this 'network module' thing...all are slow
<blockquote> <B> 
	I would do all of your troubleshooting from outside of
	X.  Just use the virtual consoles until everything else
	works right. (Fewer layers of things to conflict with
	one another).
</B> </blockquote> 
if you can shed any light on this, it would be much appreciated.
thanks
<blockquote> <B> 
	Take a really thorough look at the hardware settings for
	everything in the machine.  Make a list of all the cards
	and interfaces -- go through the docs for each one
	and map out which ones are using which interfaces.
<P> 
	I ended up going through several combinations of 
	video cards and I/O cards before I got my main system
	all integrated.  Luckily newer systems are  getting 
	better (this is a 386DX33 with 32Mb of RAM and a 
	2Mb video cards -- two IDE's, two floppy drives, two
	SCSI hardisks, an internal CD-ROM, and external magneto
	optical drive, a serial mouse, a modem (used for dial-in
	dial-out, uucp, and ppp) and null modem (I hook a laptop
	to it as a terminal for my wife) and an ethernet card.
<P> 
	Another thing to check is the cabling between your serial
	connector and your modem.  If you're configured for 
	XON/XOFF you're in trouble. If you're configured for
	hardware flow control and you don't have the appropriate
	wires in your cable than you're in worse trouble.
<P> 
	Troubleshooting of this sort really is best done over
	voice or in person.  There are too many steps to 
	the troubleshooting and testing to do effectively 
	via e-mail.

<blockquote> <B> 
	I really suggest that people learn the tao of "./"
<p>
	This is easy -- any time you mean to refer to any file
	in the current directory precede it with "./" -- this 
	forces all common Unix shells to refer to the file in
	THIS directory.  It solves all the problems with files
	that start with dashes and it allows you to remove :.:
	from your path (which *all* sysadmins should do right
	NOW).
<p>
	That is the tao of "./" -- the two keystrokes that can
	save you many hours of grief and maybe save your whole
	filesystem too.

<h3><img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ques.gif">
WWW Server?
</h3>

From: (Paulo Marcio Villaca Veiga) <A

<P> 
Where can I get (or buy) a WWW server for LINUX? <BR> 
Please, help me.
<blockquote> <B> 
	Web servers are included with most distributions 
	of Linux.  The most popular one right now is 
	called Apache.  You can look on your CD's 
	(if you bought a set) or you can point a 
	web client (browser) at http://www.apache.org
	for more information and for an opportunity to
	download a copy.
<P> 
	There are several others available -- however 
	Apache is the most well known -- so it will be
	the best for you to start with.  It is also 
	widely considered to offer the best performance 
	and feature set (of course that is a matter 
	of considerable controversy among "connosieurs"
	just as is the ongoing debate about 'vi' vs. 'emacs').

thank you

	You're welcome.
