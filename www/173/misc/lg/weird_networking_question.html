<p>
Hello TAG!
</p>

<p>
I have an unusual networking problem to solve here, and I'm needing some help.
</p>

<p>
Basically I got a machine with 2 network interfaces, eth0 and eth1,
and both are connected in the same hub.
</p>

<p>
But eth0 has the ip 192.168.0.97, and doesnt need a proxy to access
the internet.
Eth1's ip is 192.168.0.200, and that IP needs a proxy to access the
internet (and several sites are blocked, etc).
</p>

<p>
Alls configured, but it seems that everything's trying to use the eth1
to access the internet, and I need it to be accessed using eth0.
Everything should use eth0, I just need eth1 to be used for apache and mysql...
</p>

<p>
Any clue on how to configure that?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

<p>
Deividson

<p>
What is your network? Is it 192.168.0.0/24 (I assume)?
Why do both network interfaces use IP addresses from the same network?

<p>
What OS do you use? If Debian/Ubuntu, which declaration has the gateway
option in /etc/network/interfaces?
</p>

<p>
You could try using something like this:
<pre>
ip route del default
ip route add default via 192.168.0.x dev eth0

<p>
If you haven't done so already, you probably want to switch on 
"arp_filter" as well. Otherwise both interfaces will respond to ARP 
requests, causing chaos.

<p>
192.168.0.0/24 yes, and both use IPs from the same network cause the
machine was 192.168.0.200, but that blocks access to several pages,
and i need a free pass to the internet, and ip 192.168.0.97 does that.
</p>

<p>
But several other computers use 192.168.0.200 to access apache/mysql
from that machine, and I didnt want to change that,.

&gt;

<p>
Ubuntu 9.10, both interfaces got the proper gateway configured
(192.168.0.100), but not directly on the file, U9.10 uses that network
manager...
</p>


<pre>
&gt;
&gt; You could try using something like this:

<p>
Did that, still doesnt work (after a network restart) - it seems to
work as i want when i disable eth1 (but of course then apache and
mysql = unresponsible)

<p>
I imagine you have two default routes and it picks the first one it finds.
What do you see if you type:
<pre>
ip route
</pre>
in a terminal?
</p>

<p>
The better solution is to:
<pre>
* right click on nm icon on taskbar
* click edit connection
* select the one that shouldn't go out on the internet
* goto to the "IPV4 settings" tab
* click on "Routes"
* and finally, click on "Use this connection only for resources on its network"
</pre>

<p>
that will stop nm from adding a default route through that interface.

Nice tip, Dimitrios! I've just tweaked my own 'nm' settings this way,
which should help get rid of at least one minor annoyance. Thanks!

Very weird - even like this it seems that the pc is still trying to
use the wrong route, cause internet is extra slow
(3-minutes-to-open-twitter slow), and as soon as i disable eth1 it
gets normal again

There's a discussion here...
</p>

<p>
  <a href='http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2009-May/010434.html'>http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2009-May/010434.html</a>
</p>

<p>
on having 2 interfaces on one subnet. "Usually" this is not encouraged - 
depending on your platform you may not be able to arrange this at all. But 
Linux of course can do anything <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> It just might not be easy, and you are 
likely to get bit in the bum as you've discovered. Use 2 sessions of 
wireshark or tcpdump to sniff both interfaces, just to check which 
interface packets are goin gout of, and with what local addresses?
</p>

<p>
Another possible starting point for experiments would be to use one 
interface with 2 addresses.
</p>

<pre>
   ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.50 up
   ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.0.60 up
</pre>

<p>
This <em>may</em> get round arp problems. Remember you will have to force an 
application to use the non-default IP address as it's source address.
</p>

<p>
good luck
</p>

<p>
You can do the same on the fly without using different network device
names:
</p>

<pre>
ip link set dev eth0 up
ip address add 192.168.0.50/24 dev eth0
ip address add 192.168.0.60/24 dev eth0
</pre>

<p>
ip is easier to use and you can always delete addresses without hassle:
</p>

<pre>
ip address del 192.168.0.60/24 dev eth0
</pre>

<p>
This is quite useful for testing.
</p>

Since i am not using any dinamic feature as DHCP i uninstalled nm and
configured manually the network(in the file) and problems related went
away.

<p>
Mind the ARP settings. The Linux kernel answers to ARP requests on both
interfaces (as was pointed out by a previous posting). The behaviour is
called "ARP flux".
