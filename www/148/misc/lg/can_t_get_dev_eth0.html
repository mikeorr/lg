Hi TAG,
I have recently bought a NIC that uses the rtl8139 chip. I can't seem
to get it working. I load the 8139too module but I still don't get
/dev/eth0. I'm not sure how to go about fixing this so any help
would be appreciated.

<p>
Can you send the output of lspci and the kernel version your are using?
The 8139too module handles a couple of chips.
</p>

<p>
Why do you check "/dev/eth0"? The device should show up by checking with
"ifconfig" or "ip link show".
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.

Well, ip link show only picks up the loopback.

Ok, then the driver doesn't initialise it. I was confused by
"/dev/eth0". Accessing everything by file works only with Plan 9. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Possibly. If your /faux/ NIC usually tries to use IRQ5 (which would be a
little odd but possible), and the sound driver used IRQ5 first (which
would be pretty common), the NIC would have to use another IRQ - which
would eliminate the conflicts. That's a possible theory, at least. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
You might want to try troubleshooting it the old-fashioned way - i.e.,
load the NIC module first and check '/proc/interrupts' to see what's
being used; then, reload it the "good" way (sound driver first) and
check '/proc/interrupts' again to figure out which IRQ is being used by
the NIC. Last of all, check to see if the NIC module can take an 'irq='
or similar argument when loading. Presto, end of conflict.

"ndiswrapper" is a pretty good approach for wonky hardware that only
wants to work under Wind0ws - I've been using it for my laptop's WiFi
(Broadcom's BCM4306, *bleh*) for several years now. It leaves a lot of
mouse droppings in my log (hundreds of messages showing it dropping
packets, etc.) - but it allows me to have WiFi even though there's no
Linux module/driver for this chip. 
</p>

<p>
The "right" answer is, of course, to be prescient enough to know that
all the hardware on a prospective laptop is Linux-ready... but I can't
say that I've ever managed that degree of clairvoyance or perfection. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I've owned several Dells; most of those had wonky hardware too (nVidia
video and some APM-hostile chipset that prevented 'suspend' from
working.) In addition, my truly crapful experiences with Dell's service
and tech support convinced me to avoid them unless they were absolutely
the best deal on the planet.
</p>

<p>
After vgrepping my 'Sent_mail', I now recall what it was that turned me
off to Dell. I quote:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
   I've had hardware problems for the last day and a half or so - a fried
   backlight driver module in the LCD panel (temporarily patched, and a new
   laptop coming tomorrow.) Given Dell's insistence on charging me $500+
   for a new LCD panel instead of selling me a $10 module, I hereby
   wholeheartedly curse them for the greedy grasping grabby spawn of
   leprous louse-infested licentious wombats crossed with a spastic
   scheming spectral tarsier's spew [1] that they are, and declare them to
   be apogenous, bovaristic, coprolalial, dasypygal, excerebrose,
   facinorous, gnathonic, hircine, ithyphallic, jumentous, kyphotic,
   labrose, mephitic, napiform, oligophrenial, papuliferous, quisquilian,
   rebarbative, saponaceous, thersitical, unguinous, ventripotent,
   wlatsome, xylocephalous, yirning zoophytes [2]. They also have no rhythm
   and their mama dresses them funny. <strong>And</strong> I'm never doing business with
   them again, and recommending the same to my customers.
   
   
   [1] [Yawn] Oh, I'm getting alliterative again. Must be <strong>well</strong> past my bedtime.

You might want to give 2.6.24 a try:

lynx@nephtys:~$ grep BCM /boot/config-2.6.24

&gt; &gt; "ndiswrapper" is a pretty good approach for wonky hardware that only
&gt; &gt; wants to work under Wind0ws - I've been using it for my laptop's WiFi
&gt; &gt; (Broadcom's BCM4306, *bleh*) for several years now. It leaves a lot of
&gt; &gt; mouse droppings in my log (hundreds of messages showing it dropping
&gt; &gt; packets, etc.) - but it allows me to have WiFi even though there's no
&gt; &gt; Linux module/driver for this chip. 
&gt; 
&gt; You might want to give 2.6.24 a try:
&gt; 
&gt; lynx@nephtys:~$ grep BCM /boot/config-2.6.24 
&gt; CONFIG_BT_HCIBCM203X=m
&gt; CONFIG_BCM43XX=m
&gt; CONFIG_BCM43XX_DEBUG=y
&gt; CONFIG_BCM43XX_DMA=y
&gt; CONFIG_BCM43XX_PIO=y
&gt; CONFIG_BCM43XX_DMA_AND_PIO_MODE=y
&gt; # CONFIG_BCM43XX_DMA_MODE is not set

ben@Tyr:~$ grep 'model name' /proc/cpuinfo 
model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3200+

Me either - but paying high bucks for (theoretically) a high-end laptop
and then not being able to use its core features can be a pretty good
motivator. :\

I usually hand the "high bucks" or "high euros" only to vendors that
give me working and documented hardware in return. I know that this is
not always possible, but it works for me. Maybe this is due to my low
demands (getting some xterms going is almost possible on any hardware

That's true - although there are some small differences in what works
where. a 64-bit AMD is a daily education in those differences.

That's pretty tough with laptops, where the vendors change the hardware
arbitrarily, randomly, and (I suspect) with a great amount of glee at
the projected discomfort this will cause to the buyers.

What would be <em>really</em> awesome is if every laptop came with an 'lspci'

ifconfig -a

It wouldn't be unreasonable to expect it to show up as another device -
so it's worth checking out the entire list without assuming a specific
device name.

Ben, I was clumsily trying to point out ethernet drivers do not create a 
linux device (i.e. something you can create a filesystem entry for, with a 
device number etc) - they create a network interface. Hence you wouldn't 
get any device. In my urge to reply quickly I badly worded my question to 
him. I should have asked "What makes you think you'll get <em>a</em> device?"
</p>

<p>
He seems to have had some familiarity with plan 9, when indeed everything 
is (or can be represented as) a file, and that had lead him to look for a 
/dev/eth0, instead of simply doing ifconfig eth0.

Actually no, but it appears it's not an rtl8139 so that wouldn't help, I think?
