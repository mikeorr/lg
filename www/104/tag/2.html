In all the years of installfesting, hackery, hints, and consulting, I
get a lot more questions from ordinary folk about how to make last
years... or sometimes last decade's... hardware run half decently rather
than walk with a limp.

Lots of articles I see about the latest and greatest, or what K and
Gnome have improved for everyone this season, just aren't too useful
to folks buying a laptop at the local surplus shop though.  Low memory
is almost always a more painful limit than low CPU oomph, though that
too, is a factor.

Well, let's see. My P166, with 32MB RAM ran X11 (version 3 and 4) not
too badly. Granted, it wouldn't run <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> or <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A>, but if you were
patient, it would run X, and you could get somne usability out of it....

What helped were a number of things:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
1. A low resolution colour-depth (8/16 bits) is always a good idea. This
frees up quite a lot of memory. Usually a high colour-pallet is only
ever needed if you're a gamer -- and that just isn't going to be the
case on the sort of hardware you're referring to. Some window managers
(fvwm is one such window manger) allow you to set this, aside from the
defaults set by the X-server.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
2. Using a window manager (hellllo, "fvwm" 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">) as opposed to a desktop
environment is preferable. This means that interal cruft such as built in file
managers are external and hence loaded only when needed. This helps
to reduce memory consumption until such application need to be invoked
which may be never. And even then, if a GUI file manager is needed I'd
recommend 'emelfm'.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
3. Using an alternative to X11 pure might be an option for really
low-end specs. Such things as: TinyX, mgr (yay, I love mgr, although
sadly archived) and even Y-Windows (yes, I have named that right).

And don't plan on running FireFox unless you're willing to compile it
yourself.  :-}

That wasn't in existence back then. I was using netscape 4 at a push. I
did help with LFS -- it took five days straight to compile XFree86 3

Software designed for handhelds is probably the best bet. Aside from
kdrive/Tiny X, there's

Nano-X is somewhat X compatible, Twin is curses based, and PicoGUI will
run on Linux on the Palm. Even OPIE will run in 10 megs of RAM.

If they're in a networked environment, there's always letting a tougher
machine do some of the work (hellloooooo LTSP) but that's cheating.

That was my thought too.  One thing I would add is to check out the
Knoppix Cluster release <TT>/</TT> edition.  I ran into a real snag with plain LTSP
when I trying to implement a diskless cluster network, where the main app
of interest was in MM flash.  The 3.x version of LTSP didn't support any
version of Mozilla, or Netscape later than 4.x via the incorporated
busybox pkg.  I managed to resolve that issue, but was unable to resolve
the problem of having the LAN bw eaten by the flash animation, by getting
the browser to run locally in the slave memory rather than on the server.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
After about 8 instances, the (100 mbps) LAN came to a crawl.  We ended up
succombing to adding hd's and running as normal hosts 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">.  Sometime later
I discovered that the Knoppix cfg overcomes the problem by running all
apps in the local nodes RAM.  I believe that Knoppix uses LTSP, but has it
configured to do what I couldn't get it to do.  Some day I'll take a look
to examine the LTSP cfg that Knoppix uses.
