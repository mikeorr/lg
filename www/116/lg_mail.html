<p><em>This was going to be a piece about a nice juicy stumper in
netfilters.  However, that's been solved after all (see the answer gang
column about that) and the Gang working overtime has nailed all the medium
sized questions.  So, I'm forced to reveal a stumper of my own - any
readers are welcome to chime in.  If you've got something for me, send mail to

<p><strong>My hardware is a nice Pentium Coppermine 550 I've had for ages.
The Tyan motherboard I have is not quite up to match it - the CPU used to
be part of a dual pair, but that motherboard failed and the twins were split
up.  By not up to snuff, I mean that I have 1 Gig of memory in it, which
would suit the CPU fine, and it works, but the mb is only rated for 768Mb.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Still, on 2.4.x kernels it has always been sturdy;  on 2.6.x it
was crashy and I'd always end up going back.  I tried 2.6.5, 2.6.8, 2.6.10.
I also wanted to get a few simple objects all happy at the same
time:</strong><p>

<ul>
<li>sound - Ensoniq 5880, uses the es1371 drivers.
<li>USB - I use a small wacom graphire II.  Also occasionally a thumb drive.
I used to scare bugs out of USB all the time by having my stuff plugged into
the hub on my monitor, and turning my monitor off at night.  I don't do that
anymore.  It eats USB numbered nodes up quick, and my monitor (a big LCD)
seems to prefer to stay on anyway.
<li>CD burning - I burn a <b>lot</b> of discs.  If this can't behave without
making coasters, I don't care how new the kernel is.
<li>Ext3 - obviously this should work.  Before people go leaping that
$other_journal is better, my criteria is being able to see the fs no matter
which rescue disc or test disc I'm booting - and when it's shutdown clean
this acts like ext2.  However I do lots of dev work and my disks haven't
been small for awhile now;  tack on a journal and I'm not forced into a
lunch break as punishment for my coding follies.
<li>my low end Radeon video card.  RV100 QY according to lspci.  A measly 64
Mb.  It's not up to the snuff of my monitor either, but the price was right
when I was eager to enjoy my new glory.  It prefers framebuffer, but in the
2.4 series it drives the radeonfb bonkers, so I get stuck in vesa.  I'd
prefer some higher octane  in my video gastank 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"
                height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</ul>

<p><strong>I get heisencrashes.  At times it will lock up for apparently no
reason.  After my speedy reboot, no disk farts in the logs, no shuddering of
a webserver process, no clue to the heart attack.  Shall I blame the CPU?
Ah, but if it were failing hardware wouldn't it get worse?  Or the kernel's
changes have no particular effect?   But the newer kernels send the
boogeyman away - almost for long enough for me to believe that whatever it
is, they nailed it.  Hooray!  I go on my merry way hacking insanely huge
graphics in Gimp, compiling kernels or X or whatever in background while
juggling chat windows and pondering an article for some future 
issue.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Of course it'd be handy if I could provoke it.  For awhile I
almost thought I could... it was more fragile after I discovereed ayttm,
webcam support for Yahoo.  But there'd be days on end it did nothing even
when I played with that heavily, others, </strong>pow kerblooey<strong> out
it goes.  One night it was late and I left it at its console prompt (I don't
startx unless I feel like it) and it hung overnight.  I haven't crashed in
awhile (a few weeks I think) on my 2.6.11 kernel - but I *have* crashed this 
way on it, and I wasn't doing coding at the time, so I can't take the blame
myself for that one.  The truth is out there -- somewhere.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now the techsupport type in me says "and, Heather, what sort of
Doesn't Work does it <em>do</em>?  Glad you asked.  I'm buzzing along
typing, clicking, getting some work done - or goofing off - and the
keyboard's not working.  I think my mouse slipped... but moving the mouse
doesn't get any effect. clicking it does toggle my wacom pad's signalling
light - but the computer isn't dealing with the interrupt. hyperspace.  Ah!
I hope, I'll just ssh in from the sparc or my laptop.  Nope, net's dead too.
Magic SysRq? (not that this is any help if I was in X.)  nope. dead as a 
doornail.  
</strong><p>

<p><strong>I'm going to be adding a serial console soon - as soon as I find
table space for some more cords.  More ideas, and especially any idea of
what to look <em>for</em> are quite welcome.  -- Heather</strong></p>

<P><STRONG>
Good Afternoon Neil.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Good morning Andrew
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I am a very novice administrator, who has had a Spam Assassin box thrust
at me recently.  My knowledge is very limited with regards to linux and
though I have been searching the web I have not been able to find out
how to release quarantined email.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hmm. Not much information to go on. A SpamAssassin box, eh? I assume we're
talking about a standard box with a mail server and SpamAssassin?
</P>
<P>
Which mailserver are you using? The interface to SpamAssassin can vary
according to the mailserver in use. What does the part of the configuration
for SpamAssassin look like?
</P>
<P>
Even the Linux distribution could be a clue? Do you know if it was installed
from your distribution's package manager or built from source to a local
configuration? If it was installed from the package manager, what packages
were used?  If it was built locally how was it configured?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I have found the mail, have even been able to discern the contents but
not been able to figure out how to get it from there back into the queue
for it to be delivered again.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Again not much information. The location you found it in could be a clue.
</P>
<P>
I assume that you're working from a command line and not a web interface?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
If you have a moment and could point me in the right direction I would
very much appreciate it.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It's hard to give you much of a pointer without more clues.
</P>
<P>
Have you tried googling for SpamAssassin and quarantine? It throws up a lot,
but I don't have enough information to tell what might be relevant to you. It
could be narrowed down a lot by adding the name of your mailserver (e.g.
sendmail or exim).
</P>
<P>
I've CCed this to the Answer gang. Answer gang discussions can be published
in the Gazette, so let us know if that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
Please read <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A>, which should give
you some idea of what information would be useful to help us answer your
questions.

I would also like to take this opportunity to say thanks for a great magazine

<P>
Thank you very much for reading Linux Gazette!  It's always great to hear
from our loyal readers and have them tell us how LG helps them.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I came across your magazine with the debian CD's ( Woody and subsequently Sarge
). Your magazine collections have kept me company ( Along with all the
Documentation available in Sarge ) while my ship has traversed most of the
oceans ( Atlantic North and South, Indian Ocean, the south China Seas,
Mediteranean and European waters).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you all very much.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You're welcome - and we're glad to hear from you (the nature of
publishing is such that you hear more complaints than praise;
unsurprisingly, people are more ready to react to bad than good.) Thanks

When I read about your shell script called "google" I thought
that you might be interested in a program called surfraw
(<A HREF="http://surfraw.sourceforge.net"
	>http://surfraw.sourceforge.net</A>). Surfraw does what your google
script does and it also does it for many different search
engines and types of search engines too.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks, Grurp; I'm familiar with "surfraw", mainly through installing it
and then finding out that 'google' suddenly worked differently.

prefer my own version, since I've got my fingers 'trained' for it - I

However, our readers might appreciate hearing about it, so I'll CC this
to TAG.

Well, I guess that would require a 'while' loop, and perhaps an 'if' clause
since it says "it <EM>may</EM> take a while". But then I have no idea what the

I thought it'd just let you all know
that I am going to be without Internet access for at least a month.

<p>
After that, I might have some, but it will be very intermittent, to not
at all, at best.  Perhaps in October I will have something more
stable... I can't say.
