Thanks Thomas and Joey.
</p>

<p>
The Operating system what i am using is Centos 5.2
</p>

<p>
We have our own java based software which is configured to use the port &lt; 1024 for some testing.when i try to start running my  process 
</p>

<p>
I see the  java exception which says  ":: java.net.BindException: Permission denied"
</p>

<p>
As a root i could start and use without any issue
</p>

It is a common "security" feature to only allow root to use ports &lt; 1024
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of solutions. Use an internet service launcher, like 
inetd or xinetd, to listen on the port and launch your application. I think 
xinetd can launch your application to run as a non-root user. However you'd 
have to alter you appl. to use stdin and stdout files instead of handling 
the sockets directly (actually this makes creating an itnernet application 
trivial - you don't need to understand sockets <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
Alternatively make your application setuid root (see man chmod), so that 
when it is executed it starts as root, so it can listen on the priveleged 
port, then it can make a system call to stop being root and alter to a 
normal user - the C lib function is setuid.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure you could do a google code search for some example code.
