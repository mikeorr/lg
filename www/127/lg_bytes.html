<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LinuxWorld OpenSolutions Summit to Debut in February 2007</h3>
<p>    IDG World Expo, the producer of  
tradeshows, conferences and events for technology markets, has announced a new OSSw event - 
LinuxWorld OpenSolutions Summit - a regional and more vertically focused 
conference tailored specifically to the needs and interests of IT professionals 
involved in the deployment of Linux and open source solutions. The inaugural 
event is scheduled to take place February 14-15, 2007, at the Marriott Marquis 
in New York City.</p>

<p> The new OSSw summit evolved after recognizing a need for a 
targeted, high-level conference that concentrates on vertical markets. Attendees can 
access multiple tracks addressing best practices, including presentations by leading 
Linux and open source experts, case studies presented by IT executives, and 
a Solution Showcase for the latest Linux and OSSw products and technologies.</p>

<p>As a result of launching the New York LinuxWorld OpenSolutions Summit, the Boston 
LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo will no longer take place.</p>

<p>LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo San Francisco, the original, largest and 
most comprehensive event focusing exclusively on Linux and Open Source, will 
continue on an annual basis at the Moscone Center. Considered the de facto event 
by attendees and exhibitors alike, LinuxWorld San Francisco features 
across-the-board sessions and a full trade show floor embracing the entire Linux 
and open source continuum, and topics ranging from system administration to the 
desktop to mobile Linux. At a new conference track for the Linux Channel, the 
findings of the first major, objective study focusing on how solution providers 
are selling Linux solutions to mid-market customers will be released.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif"> Sun Frees Java a little bit more</h3>

<p>Sun will now allow the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) 5.0 to be distributed 
by GNU/Linux and OpenSolaris developers under a new license, the Operating 
System Distributor's License for Java, or "Distro License for Java" (or "DLJ"). 
The announcement came during the kick off keynote speech at May's JavaOne 
conference in front of 14 to 15 thousand developers in San Francisco. In a kind 
of rapproachement with the OSSw community, Sun's new CEO Jonathan Schwartz called 
Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth to the stage to talk about the 
announcement.</p>

<p>Sun had hinted earlier in May that it will loosen distribution restrictions 
on its Java licensing, to encourage developers to use Java on Linux systems. 
Many Linux distributions previously required users to manual download, install 
and configure Java.</p>

<p>Sun developed this license in conjunction with numerous GNU/Linux 
communities. It allows distributors to ship Sun's Java SE 5.0 Java Development 
Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) as installable packages for their 
operating systems. </p>

<p>The company also announced that Sun's Java Studio Creator, Java System Portal 
Server, Java Message System-based message queue and Web Services 
Interoperability Technology would be released as open source code.</p>

<p>Sun has opened a new community project on Java.net (<a 
href="http://jdk-distros.dev.java.net">http://jdk-distros.dev.java.net</a>         
) to serve as a clearinghouse for best 
practices for delivering compatibly packaged JDK bundles on GNU/Linux and 
OpenSolaris. </p>

<p>[Meanwhile, CEO Schwartz continues to talk about Open 
Sourcing Java after JavaOne.  <a 
href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/227995.htm">Click here</a>         
        
         for SysCon's 
take.] </p>

<p>Several project teams have [or should soon] announce plans to redistribute 
the JDK for use with their operating systems including the Ubuntu, Gentoo and 
Debian distributions of GNU/Linux, NexentaOS, a hybrid operating system with an 
OpenSolaris kernel and GNU applications and both the Schillix and BeleniX 
versions of OpenSolaris. One well-known effort to repackage Sun's JDK for Linux, 
the Blackdown Project (<a href="http://www.blackdown.org">http://www.blackdown.org</a>), has agreed to join the new 
jdk-distros project on java.net and contribute their Debian packaging code to 
this initiative.</p>

<p>"We are really pleased to see Sun's increasing involvement in the free 
software community, from the opening of the Solaris Operating System source and 
now the re-licensing of Java technology to be compatible with</p>

<p>GNU/Linux distributions, and are looking forward to building stronger ties 
with the Sun community in the future", said Anthony Towns, Debian Project 
Leader.</p>

<p>"This new license shows that Sun and the Java technology world care about 
GNU/Linux and open source platforms and are willing to put aside philosophical 
differences and get down to business," said Mark Shuttleworth, founder and 
sponsor of the Ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution. "This eliminates one of the 
biggest roadblocks to wider use of the Java platform on free and open source 
operating system platforms and makes Java technology a more attractive 
foundation on which to build new projects and innovations." </p>

<p>[In email correspondence, Mark wrote, "I see it as a positive step by 
SUN towards having a genuinely free software license for Java." And "...the new 
license does allow us to carry SUN's Java implementation in the Ubuntu 
repositories alongside other non-free software."]</p>

<p>Quoting from Mark Shuttleworth's Blog [May 23rd] at 
<a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com">http://www.markshuttleworth.com</a>:</p>

<p>"Even though this was not the announcement we were all hoping for (a complete 
shift to free software Java), I was pleased to be part of the "Distro Licence 
for Java" announcement. As best I can tell, the new leadership at SUN clearly 
recognizes the importance of the free software model AND the role of the 
community. That's a big step forward and important to the progress of free 
software...."</p>

<p>"The new license does not mean that we can include Java in Ubuntu by default. 
It does not yet meet our criteria for free software in order to get into "main". 
But it DOES mean we can put it in the Multiverse or Commercial repositories, and 
people who want it can trivially get it after they have installed Ubuntu on a 
desktop or a server."</p>

<p>Mark's blog entry also has some interesting musings about Sun switching 
to the copyleft and TradeMark enforcement  and also how the world might be different 
if Java had been free OSSw 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years ago [it would have been 
Java-on-Rails, not Ruby].</p>

<p>The DLJ allows the different distributions to define the packaging, 
installation and support for the JDK within their distribution. Distributions 
exercising the DLJ and shipping JDK bundles are ultimately responsible for 
maintaining compatibility. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM invests in Linux -- in Brazil</h3>


<p>IBM announced in late May it will invest $2.2 million in 2006 to expand its 
Linux Technology Center (LTC) in Brazil. Developers at IBM's Linux Technology 
Center in Brazil will work to improve Linux as part of the open source 
community.</p>

<p>The investment will be used to complete construction of a Linux development 
laboratory in Hortolandia and expand a second lab in Campinas, on Brazil's 
Unicamp campus. It will assist with upgrading lab construction and equipment, 
furthering software development projects with Linux, and expanding student 
internships and job opportunities for recent graduates as a result of a 
collaboration between IBM and Brazil's Unicamp campus.</p>

<p>The investment will enable engineers and developers at the Linux Technology 
Center in Brazil to work on the following new projects:</p>


- Linux development for IBM's Cell processor.<br>
- Linux development for IBM's Power processor.<br>
- Ease of use improvements for Linux on IBM Systems.<br>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Researchers Find Linux Security Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>Safend announced in May that Zvi Gutterman, its CTO and co-founder, has 
discovered several security vulnerabilities in Linux, the most common open 
source project. As Safend's CTO, Gutterman designs key technologies such as the 
algorithms and theory behind Safend Auditor and Safend Protector implementation 
and is a Ph.D. candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Recently, he has 
been conducting analysis of the Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG) along with 
Benny Pinkas from the University of Haifa and Tzachy Reinman from the Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The team's research includes an attack on the Linux Random Number Generator. 
The LRNG is the key element behind most security protocols and tools which are 
part of Linux. Among them are PGP, SSL, Disk and email encryption. Using the 
attack presented by the research team, an adversary attempting to break into a 
Linux machine may compute backward outputs of the LRNG and use them to access 
previous confidential communications.</p>

<p>Gutterman, along with Pinkas and Reinman, used dynamic and static reverse 
engineering to learn the operation of the LRNG. The team was then able to 
illustrate flaws in the design of the generator as well as measurements of the 
actual entropy collected by it.</p>

<p>"Our result shows that open source is not a synonym for secure design; once 
the LRNG is broken, we can break any future or previous password on that PC," 
stated Gutterman. "However, open source benefits security by enabling security 
audits. As we state in our research paper, we feel that the open source 
community should have a better policy for security sensitive software 
components. They shouldn't be treated as other source elements."</p>

<p>Gutterman, Pinkas, and Reinman presented their research 
paper entitled "<a 
href="http://www.gutterman.net/publications/GuttermanPinkasReinman2006.pdf">Analysis 
of the Linux Random Number Generator</a>" at the <a 
href="http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2006/oakland06.html">IEEE Security and 
Privacy Symposium</a> held in Oakland, California, May 21-24. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">X.ORG finds Bad Bug with Coverity Code Audit</h3>


<p>We have another major security issue with Linux and other Unix OSes, if you 
use XWindows. In conjunction with the DHS, Coverity has been performing static 
analysis of OSSw projects. This link describes the project:  <a 
href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3589361">http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3589361</a></p>

<p>This link shows the current results: <a 
href="http://scan.coverity.com/">http://scan.coverity.com/</a></p>

<p>During analysis of results from the Coverity code review of X.Org, a major 
flaw in the server was discovered that allows local users to execute arbitrary 
code with root privileges. The eWeek article below, which has been copied in 
many blogs and OSSw sites [sometimes without attribution], is reproduced here 
for your education and pleasure....</p>

<p><strong>Homeland Security Audit Flags 'Critical' Linux 
Bug</strong>      <br>
By Ryan Naraine / eWeek / May 2, 2006 </p>

<p></p>

<p>An open-source security audit program funded by the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security has flagged a critical vulnerability in the X Window System 
which is used in Unix and Linux systems. Coverity, the San Franciso-based 
company managing the project under a $1.25 million grant, described the flaw as 
the "biggest security vulnerability" found in the X Window System code since 
2000.</p>

<p>The flaw was pinpointed during automated code scanning that formed part of 
the "Vulnerability Discovery and Remediation Open Source Hardening Project," a 
broad federal initiative to perform daily security audits of approximately 40 
open-source software packages.</p>

<p>The purpose of the audit is to pinpoint buffer overflows, memory allocation 
bugs and other vulnerabilities that are a constant target for malicious hacking 
attacks. In addition to Linux, Apache, MySQL and Sendmail, the project will also 
pore over the code bases for FreeBSD, Mozilla, PostgreSQL and the GTK (GIMP Tool 
Kit) library. </p>

<p>The X Window System, also called X11 or X, provides the toolkit and protocol 
to build GUIs for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to provide 
windowing for bit-map displays. The X Window System also ships as an optional 
GUI with Macintosh computers from Apple.</p>

<p>Coverity Chief Technical Officer Ben Chelf said the flaw resulted from a 
missing parenthesis on a small piece of the program that checked the ID of the 
user. It could be exploited to allow local users to execute code with root 
privileges, giving them the ability to overwrite system files or initiate 
denial-of-service attacks.</p>

<p>Coverity hailed the discovery as proof that its automated code scanning tool 
can discover serious flaws that the human eye might miss. "This was caused by 
something as seemingly harmless as a missing closing parenthesis," Chelf said, 
describing the severity of the bug as a "worst-case scenario" for the X.Org 
Foundation that manages the X Windows System project.</p>

<p>Daniel Stone, release manager at X.Org, agreed that the vulnerability was 
"one of the most significant" discovered in recent memory. "[This is] something 
that we find once every three to six years and is very close to X's worst-case 
scenarios in terms of security," Stone said. "[Coverity's tool exposed] 
vulnerabilities in our code that likely wouldn't have been spotted with human 
eyes. Its attention to subtle detail throughout the entire code base - even parts 
you wouldn't normally examine manually - makes it a very valuable tool in checking 
your code base," he added.</p>

<p>The flaw, which affects X11R6.9.0 and X11R7.0.0, was fixed within a week of 
its discovery, and Chelf said Coverity has implemented a system to analyze the X 
Window System on a continuous basis to help prevent new defects from entering 
the project. [so pls check for the updates on your systems - your

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Open Source OWASP Project Addresses Web Security</h3>


<p>The Open Web Application Security Project announced availability of a process 
guide that will help a broad range of developers incorporate security into the 
software application development lifecycle (SDLC). OWASP is dedicated to helping 
organizations understand and improve the security of their applications and 
services.</p>

<p>CLASP (Comprehensive Lightweight Application Security Process) will be 
accessible through OWASP to developers globally. Developers will be able to 
leverage a best practices methodology that provides a well organized and 
structured approach for integrating security requirements and activities into 
each stage of the software development lifecycle.</p>

<p>"Many organizations are realizing that discovery and remediation of 
vulnerabilities in later stages of development is far too costly," said Jeff 
Williams, CEO of Aspect Security and Chair of the OWASP organization. "The OWASP 
project makes sure that developers have the knowledge and the tools to build 
secure software from the beginning."</p>

<p>OWASP's mission is to enable organizations to develop, maintain and purchase 
secure applications through the development of free,open and unbiased 
application security documentation, tools, chapters and conferences.</p>

<p>OWASP documentation projects include a guide to web application security, 
metrics, a test guide, documents for performing ISO 17799 reviews, and an AppSec 
FAQ . OWASP projects also include WebGoat - an interactive training and 
benchmarking tool so users can learn about web application security - and 
WebScarab - a web application vulnerability assessment suite.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss Effort to Standardize Web Beans, Link Java Frameworks</h3>


<p>-JBoss announced plans to submit a proposal to standardize Web Beans in Java. The 
Web Beans standard initiative will aim to bridge the gap between Enterprise JavaBeans 
3.0 and Java Server Faces (JSF) . The result would be a simpler, more 
elegant, unified programming model for web development.</p>

<p>Borland, Google, Oracle and Sun Microsystems will bring their support and expertise 
with web frameworks to the standardization effort. The proposed standard 
will draw upon principles found today in JBoss Seam, Oracle application 
Development Framework (ADF) and Apache StrutsShale. JBoss Seam introduced a 
uniform component model for building web applications through declarative, 
contextual, application state management. Oracle ADF promotes the use of a 
metadata-driven architecture that enables developers to cleanly separate 
business service implementation details from the user interface. Apache 
StrutsShale offers a set of fine-grained services that can be combined as 
needed, rather than a monolithic request processor.</p>

<p>Gavin King, architect at JBoss, plans to lead the standardization effort. 
King, who founded the popular Hibernate project and is currently leading the 
development of JBoss Seam, commented: "The overwhelmingly positive response to 
Seam from the developer community convinced us that this is an idea whose time 
has come and one that should be brought back into the standards process for the 
benefit of the entire Java community. JBoss' end goal is the same as these 
companies supporting this initiative: To create a highly productive, accelerated 
development environment and enable richer web applications." </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Borland Announces Three-Year JBuilder Product Roadmap; Builds on Eclipse </h3>


<p>The Developer Tools Group of Borland Software Corporation announced details 
around a three-year product roadmap for JBuilder, its award-winning Java 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The roadmap includes an update to 
JBuilder 2006, a new underlying framework based on Eclipse in JBuilder 2007 
("Peloton"), and provides insight into the functionality being developed in 
future JBuilder versions. Future capabilities for the product line include new 
team collaboration and developer productivity features, support for new Java 
standards and emerging open source tools and frameworks, enhanced support for 
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and more.</p>

<p>The JBuilder roadmap was presented at May's JavaOne 
conference in San Francisco, Calif. and to customer dates throughout the 
world during Borland's 2006 <a 
href="http://www.borland.com/us/company/news/press_releases/2006/05_02_06_borland_announces_dates_for_its_2006_global_developer_road_show.html">Global 
Developer Road Show</a>.  US dates are June 1 through June 
14.    Borland's Developer Tools Group is already working to 
deliver on this three-year roadmap with a free JBuilder 2006 Foundation edition 
available for download  (<a 
href="http://www.borland.com/downloads/download_jbuilder.html">http://www.borland.com/downloads/download_jbuilder.html</a>           
           
    
          ) </p>

<p>Two new JBuilder 2006 updates planned for release this year, with the next 
major release of JBuilder, codenamed "Peloton," expected to be available in Q4. 
JBuilder 2006, already shipping, began the transition of JBuilder to a more 
collaborative team development environment with features such as shared code 
editor views and joint debugging capabilities. These features allow local and 
remote developers to jointly design, edit and debug applications in real 
time.</p>

<p>JBuilder will continue to support the latest JCP standards as they become 
available and Developer Tools Group expects to release an update to JBuilder 
2006 in June to support Java SE 6 ("Mustang") and an additional service pack in 
the Fall once Mustang is formally released by Sun Microsystems.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Terracotta Has Free Downloads of Terracotta Sessions for Apache Tomcat and 
BEA WebLogic Server</h3>


<p>Changing the Java landscape, Terracotta, Inc., a leader in enterprise Java 
scalability, announced at JavaOne that it has begun giving away free copies of 
its session clustering solutions -- Terracotta Sessions for Tomcat and 
Terracotta Sessions for WebLogic Server. By injecting clustering and caching 
into the Java runtime, Terracotta furnishes applications with linear 
scalability, total fault tolerance, and high availability without making any 
changes to the application code.</p>

<p>Apache Tomcat users can spend weeks or months writing clustering code by hand 
to make Java applications in production cluster and scale efficiently. 
Terracotta Sessions for Tomcat gives developers a free, clustering solution that 
meets their need for load-balanced Tomcat application servers. It also removes 
performance tuning from the development lifecycle. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, enterprises running WebLogic Server sessions from BEA Systems, 
Inc. can realize significant cost benefits with Terracotta Sessions for WebLogic 
Server, which eliminates performance tuning and provides linear scalability and 
total fault tolerance. Terracotta Sessions feature fine-grained updates of 
session data to reduce overhead and improve scalability and performance. 
Real-time monitoring of session contents simplifies debugging and 
provisioning.</p>

<p>Terracotta Sessions can plug-in to an "off-the-shelf" JVM and clusters at the 
JVM level to provide a simple runtime solution. With Terracotta Sessions, 
developers can now purchase inexpensive, non-clustered application servers or 
use open source application servers. Terracotta was named "Cool Vendor" by 
Gartner in April. </p>

<p>The Terracotta solutions are both standards-compliant and, as drop-in 
clustering solutions, they drive faster time-to-market for Java applications. 
Terracotta Sessions licenses are free for all platforms for four JVMs and under. 
Production licenses are available directly from Terracotta. For more 
information, see these links : </p>

<p>MEPIS has released beta 4 of SimplyMEPIS 6.0. The ISO image is available for download and test in the mepis 'testing' subdirectory at the MEPIS Subscriber's Site and public mirrors. </p>

<p>Beta 4 includes some new and/or updated applications including amarok 1.4, 
xaralx 0.5, and ksudoku. Digikam plugins were added to make Digikam and showFoto 
much more powerful and fun to use. To make room for xaralx, it was necessary to 
remove tvtime and the GIMP from the bootable CD but, for those who need them, 
they are available for download and install via the Synaptic download manager or 
apt-get.</p>

<p>Warren Woodford explains why this was done: "The SimplyMEPIS bootable CD is a starting 
point, and not always a complete solution. There are many applications we would 
like to include on the CD, but they won't fit. The OpenSource edition of Xaralx, 
formerly Corel Xara, is a well known Windows app for vector graphics drawing 
that is an exciting addition to Linux and MEPIS. Likewise, the new plugins make 
image manipulation in Digikam and showFoto a piece of cake. We want the new 
Linux user coming to MEPIS from XP to see right away that Linux has apps that 
are fun and easy. For the experienced user who wants or needs a powerful image 
manipulation program like the GIMP or any of the other apps we don't bundle on 
the CD, we ask for their understanding."</p>

<p>For this release, cpu speed management and suspend-to-ram have been improved. 
KDE configuration have been fixed for time format and other localization 
elements. The fontconfig configuration has been improved, so some web site fonts 
look better in both Firefox and Konqueror.  Floppy support has been changed to be 
more reliable. Spamassassin has been tweaked to give very good results 
out-of-the-box, and then excellent results as soon as it has learned from a 
sample of user emails.</p>

<p>SimplyMEPIS 6.0 Beta 4 runs a reconfigured version of the Release Candidate 
update of the 2.6.15.7 kernel from Ubuntu. The kernel source has been verified 
to give the best possible compatibility with new Intel hardware. The MEPIS 
configuration maintains compatibility with the extra "restricted" drivers 
provided by the Ubuntu team in the Ubuntu pools. MEPIS builds extra drivers for 
the 386, 686, and K7 flavors of i386 including bcm4400, bcm5700, Intel536, 
quickcam, spca5xx, usbvision, and, new in this release, ivtv. These drivers are 
available in the MEPIS pool and they are compatible with the matching Ubuntu 
kernels.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">  Trolltech's Qt Development Framework Used for Remotely Managed Xandros 
Server</h3>


<p> Xandros, a leading provider of easy-to-use Linux alternatives to Windows, 
and Trolltech, a leading provider of technologies that make advanced software 
faster to build and easier to use, announced that Trolltech's Qt development 
framework was used to create the new Xandros Server, which recently won the 
Product Excellence Award at LinuxWorld Boston. Utilizing the robust and 
efficient Qt framework, Xandros developers created the all-graphical user 
interface called Xandros Management Console (xMC).</p>

<p>Similar in concept to the Microsoft Management Console that ships with 
Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 servers, xMC presents a simplified, centralized 
approach to remotely administering users and services, unlike any other on the 
Linux server market today. Qt was also used to create a unique plug-in 
architecture that enables third party services, such as Scalix groupware and 
RealNetworks media delivery, to be integrated and managed within xMC just like 
other services running on a Xandros Server.</p>

<p>"Through the use of the robust Qt development framework we were able to save 
countless hours of development time, while producing superior code and 
documentation," said Ming Poon, Xandros VP of Product Development. "Qt's 
cross-platform framework, in conjunction with the platform-neutral design we 
built into xMC, will allow us to seamleplug insrt a Windows version of xMC so 
that administrators can manage Xandros Server from their Windows workstations as 
well."</p>

<p>Xandros Server, built on top of Debian Linux, offers Managed Community model 
with consolidated system monitoring and workflow automation to address the 
issues normally encountered when administering SMB systems. It presents a 
simplified, centralized approach to remotely administering users and services 
through the all-graphical Xandros Management Console (xMC). It is compatible 
with any existing Windows domain and networking infrastructure, offering a 
plug-and-play replacement to costly Windows servers.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Lexar USB, Phoenix Technologies Latest BIOS Supports BitLocker Drive 
Encryption </h3>


<p>Phoenix Technologies Ltd.has announced a new version of TrustedCore, its 
innovative firmware that creates a more tamper-resistant platform by proactively 
protecting X86-based computing devices and their data before the operating 
system and applications even load. The new version of TrustedCore, through its 
support of BitLocker Drive Encryption, will provide Windows Vista users with 
better data protection, pre-boot security and authentication and support for 
other security specifications, including biometrics and smart tokens. 
TrustedCore is a secure firmware foundation that will increase client and 
enterprise security by providing endpoints with strong authentication and a 
secure execution environment.</p>

<p>BitLocker Drive Encryption provides for full volume encryption and support 
for pre-boot multi-factor authentication.   BitLocker will protect 
data from being used by unauthorized users or even downloaded inappropriately to 
thumb drives. Linux and other *IX platforms should also be able to leverage 
these BIOS enhancements. </p>

<p>TrustedCore architecture enables device designers and manufacturers to create 
trusted and self-authenticating networked devices. The software delivers a "root 
of trust" that allows customers to deploy devices that are inherently secure 
from the start and that support the latest in digital device authentication 
advancements. Phoenix TrustedCore supports strong, multifactor pre-boot user 
authentication and validates a user's identity before the system starts. </p>

<p>The new version of TrustedCore advanced firmware includes capabilities that 
legacy BIOS solutions cannot offer. TrustedCore SP3B enhances endpoint security 
by providing secure CRTM (core root of trust measurement, also known as BIOS 
Bootblock) update through its Secure Flash update process. In addition, 
TrustedCore SP3B supports Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) 2.0 and 
provides developer tools, including a device driver kit  for silicon and 
hardware vendors, and a software developer kit for application developers that 
want to build UEFI shell applications.</p>

<p>A beta version of TrustedCore SP3B is available immediately and the release 
version is expected in Q3 2006. For more information, visit 
www.phoenix.com/TrustedCore.</p>

<p>Lexar Media, announced the development of advanced, secure USB storage-based 
technologies. Lexar plans to work together with Phoenix Technologies, Ltd. to 
develop support for locking USB personal storage devices (PSDs) that can be used 
with the BitLocker Drive Encryption feature. The technology developed by Lexar 
for BitLocker, will coordinate the PSD-Lock technology protection of Lexar's new 
enterprise-class SAFE PSD products with the pre-boot authentication capability 
of Phoenix Technologies' TrustedCore.</p>

<p>This technology will provide protection against unauthorized use of the USB 
Flash Drive (UFD) that enables the boot of a BitLocker-protected computer and 
also protect the BitLocker Drive Encryption keys held in the UFD when the UFD is 
not connected to the protected computer.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">PostPath Announces the Drop-In Alternative to Microsoft Exchange</h3>


<p>May marked the official debut of PostPath, perhaps the only Linux-based email 
server to offer drop-in plug-compatibility with Microsoft Exchange. Formerly 
Apptran Software, the company was founded in 2003 to address the growing 
frustrations of organizations locked into Microsoft's expensive and inflexible 
email server.</p>

<p>PostPath has created an alternative by combining publicly available 
documentation with packet-level protocol decoding to implement the Exchange 
network protocols on the PostPath Linux email server. As a result, the PostPath 
Server is the first Exchange alternative to be able to drop into an existing 
Exchange farm without disruption.  It is the first to interoperate with the 
server-to-server functions of already-deployed Exchange servers and the first to 
provide full-featured Outlook interoperability without the need for plug-ins, 
special connectors, or reconfiguration.</p>

<p>           
 The PostPath Server also movies the information store to a Linux file 
system, simplifying storage, replication, backup and recovery.</p>

<p>"Enabling a five-times performance increase over Exchange and a six-fold 
reduction in storage costs, granular backup and restore, standards-based 
virus-filtering, archiving, clustering, replication and disaster-recovery, AJAX 
web-client support, and drop-in compatibility, the PostPath Server is the first 
truly enterprise-class Exchange alternative," said PostPath's CEO, Duncan 
Greatwood. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Crescendo Delivers Multi-Tier Application Acceleration for Web Based 
Applications</h3>


<p>At Interop 2006, Crescendo Networks announced the availability of its 
Application Layer Processing (ALP) technology - the first solution capable of 
intelligently accelerating application flows across all logical application 
tiers. It will be available as a software module for Crescendo's Maestro family 
of products beginning in Q3 of 2006. </p>

<p>Web applications commonly contain multiple logical processing tiers that 
reside on one or more physical server tiers. As application requests move 
between the tiers they must often wait for processing attention from upstream or 
downstream partners. Crescendo reduces this inherent latency by intelligently 
managing and optimizing the application flow between all logical tiers.</p>

<p>Using definitions created using the Crescendo Rule Engine (CRE), ALP is 
capable of recognizing for which tier each application request is destined. ALP 
also understands that different requests impose different processing "weights" 
on the application with "heavier" requests taking longer to process than 
"lighter" ones. Request weights can either be manually configured or adaptively 
learned by ALP. In addition ALP recognizes that each tier in the application has 
an upper processing limit in terms of simultaneous requests. When a tier reaches 
maximum capacity, ALP's Admission Control mechanism queues requests within 
Maestro sending them only to the application when processing capacity is 
available.</p>

<p>"Crescendo's unique ALP technology represents the first time an AFE 
[application front end] is addressing our application and database performance 
bottlenecks behind the web server," said Ian Rae, president and CEO of Syntenic 
Inc. "This revolutionary end-to-end acceleration approach will enable 
applications to reach new levels of performance and scalability unattainable by 
existing acceleration technologies." </p>

<p>Crescendo Network's Maestro product line delivers application acceleration, a 
faster end user experience, increased security and application assurance. ALP 
offers patent-pending application layer processing algorithms modeled on 
bio-medical engineering research techniques. ALP's unique functionality 
eliminates application overload, intelligently schedules and prioritizes 
delivery requests, and monitors and reports on application performance across 
all tiers. Collectively ALP and SLT technologies deliver a level of application 
acceleration several times greater than the performance capabilities of any 
other AFE vendor.</p>

<p>ALP will be available for the Maestro product line as a software module. 
Pricing for the integrated Maestro-ALP solution package will start at $52,000. 
ALP will be available to existing Crescendo clients as an upgrade. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intel's Core Microarchitecture Sets New Records in Performance and Energy Efficiency
</h3>

<p>Intel now has record breaking results on 20 key dual-processor (DP) server 
and workstation benchmarks. The first processor due to launch based on the new 
Intel Core microarchitecture -- the Dual-Core Intel Xeon processor 5100 series, 
previously codenamed "Woodcrest" -- delivers up to 125 percent performance 
improvement over previous generation dual-core Intel Xeon processors and up to 
60 percent performance improvement over competing x86 based architectures.</p>

<p>Fully-buffered dual in-line memory (FB-DIMM) technology allows for better 
memory capacity, throughput and overall reliability. This is critical for 
creating balanced platforms using multiple cores and the latest technologies, 
such as virtualization, to meet the expanding demand for compute headroom.</p>

<p>Intel's new server and workstation platforms, codenamed "Bensley" and 
"Glidewell" respectively, will support dual- and quad-core processors built 
using Intel's 65-nanometer (nm) and future process technologies.</p>

<p>The first processors for Bensley and Glidewell are in the Dual-Core Intel 
Xeon processor 5000 series, previously codenamed "Dempsey." Shipping since March 
at a new lower price point, they bring higher performance and lower power 
consumption to the value server and workstation segment. Complementing the 5000 
series, Intel will ship the next processor for Bensley and Glidewell in June -- 
the Dual-Core Intel Xeon processor 5100 series. Based on the Intel Core 
Microarchitecture, most of these processors will only consume a maximum of 65 
watts.</p>

<p>Using the SPECint_rate_base2000 benchmark, which measures integer throughput, 
a Dell PowerEdge 2950 server based on the Dual-Core Xeon 5100 series scored 
123.0, setting a new world record. Using the SPECjbb2005 benchmark, the 
Fujitsu-Siemens PRIMERGY RX200 S3 server based on the Dual-Core Xeon processor 
5100 series broke previous records with a score of 96,404 business operations 
per second.</p>

<p>An HP Proliant ML 370 G5(a) server based on the Dual-Core Xeon 5100, and 
using the TPC-C benchmark, which measures database performance, smashed another 
world record by scoring 169,360 tpmC at $2.93/tpmC. IBM is also in the record 
books with the IBM System x3650 server based on the Dual-Core Xeon 5100, which

users</h3>


<p>Speaking in Austin, Intel Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer 
Paul Otellini gave the first public demonstration of a <a 
href="http://mms.businesswire.com/bwapps/mediaserver/ViewMedia?mgid=67941&amp;vid=4">low-cost 
notebook PC for students in developing nations</a> 
[small pic] and announced a plan with the 
Mexican government to provide PCs to 300,000 teachers. </p>

<p>"We're close to achieving Andy Grove's vision of a billion connected PCs -- 
and the economic, social and personal gains that come with them," said Otellini, 
referring to the Intel co-founder and former CEO. "Our job now is to harness the 
combined potential of full-featured technology, high-speed connectivity and 
effective education to speed the gains for the next billion people -- and the 
next billion after that."</p>

<p>In his speech, Otellini said that the predictions by Grove and of another 
co-founder of Intel, Gordon Moore, form a backdrop for the new World Ahead 
Program from Intel. The program's 5-year goals are to extend wireless broadband 
PC access to the world's next billion users while training 10 million more 
teachers on the effective use of technology in education, with the possibility 
of reaching another 1 billion students.</p>

<p>Otellini demonstrated one of the PCs developed from Intel's extensive 
ethnographic research in developing countries, a small notebook PC for students 
codenamed "Eduwise." Eduwise is designed to provide affordable, collaborative 
learning environments for teachers and young students and integrate with other 
non-computing learning tasks such as note taking and handwriting with wireless 
pen attachments. Because it is a fully featured PC, the Eduwise design can 
accommodate other standard software and tools [and operating systems].</p>

<p>Otellini also announced that Intel and the Mexican government have reached an 
agreement to make Intel's new low-cost, fully featured PC available to 300,000 
teachers by year's end. The systems, unveiled last month in Mexico by Otellini 
as part of Intel's Discover the PC initiative, provide an easy-to-use, fully 
functional PC for first-time users. Intel also plans to extend teacher training 
to 400,000 teachers in Mexico through the Intel Teach to the Future program by 
2010.</p>

<p><b>--Survey Finds Americans Want Strong Data Security Legislation </b></p>

<p>A survey from the Cyber Security Industry Alliance (CSIA) of 1,150 US adults 
found 71 percent want the federal government to enact legislation to protect 
personal data similar to California's data security law.  Of that 71 percent, 46 
percent said they would consider a political candidate's position on data 
security legislation and "have serious or very serious doubts about political 
candidates who do not support quick action to improve existing laws."  In 
addition, half of those surveyed avoid making online purchases due to security 
concerns.<br><a href="http://www.fcw.com/article94613-05-23-06-Web">http://www.fcw.com/article94613-05-23-06-Web</a>

<p><strong>--Soon-to-be-Proposed Digital Copyright 
Legislation Would Tighten Restrictions </strong>   
         
</p>

<p>Despite efforts of computer programmers, tech companies and academics to get 
Congress to loosen restrictions imposed by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act 
(DMCA), an even more stringent copyright law is expected to be introduced 
soon.  The Intellectual Property Protection Act of 2006 would make simply 
trying to commit copyright infringement a federal crime punishable by up to 10 
years in prison.  The bill also proposes changes to the DMCA that would 
prohibit people from "making, importing, exporting, obtaining control of or 
possessing" software or hardware that can be used to circumvent copyright 
protection.<br>
