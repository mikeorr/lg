The whole point of networking is to allow computers to easily share
information. Sharing information with other Linux boxes, or any UNIX
host, is easy--tools such as FTP and NFS are readily available and
frequently set up easily ``out of the box''. Unfortunately, even the most
die-hard Linux fanatic has to admit the operating system most of the PCs
in the world are running is one of the various types of Windows.
Unless you use your Linux box in a particularly isolated environment,
you will almost certainly need to exchange information with machines
running Windows. Assuming you're not planning on moving all of your
files using floppy disks, the tool you need is Samba.
<p>
Samba is a suite of programs that gives your Linux box the ability to speak
SMB (Server Message Block). SMB is the protocol used to implement
file sharing and printer services between computers running OS/2,
Windows NT, Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroups. The protocol is
analogous to a combination of NFS (Network File System), <b>lpd</b> (the
standard UNIX printer server) and a distributed authentication
framework such as NIS or Kerberos. If you are familiar with Netatalk,
Samba does for Windows what Netatalk does for the Macintosh. While
running the Samba server programs, your Linux box appears in the
``Network Neighborhood'' as if it were just another Windows machine.
Users of Windows machines can ``log into'' your Linux server and,
depending on the rights they are granted, copy files to and from parts
of the UNIX file system, submit print jobs and even send you WinPopup
messages. If you use your Linux box in an environment that
consists almost completely of Windows NT and Windows 95 machines,
Samba is an invaluable tool.

<p>
Samba also has the ability to do things that normally require the
Windows NT Server to act as a WINS server and process ``network
logons'' from Windows 95 machines. A PAM module derived from Samba
code allows you to authenticate UNIX logins using a Windows NT Server.
A current Samba project seeks to reverse engineer the proprietary
Windows NT domain-controller protocol and re-implement it as a
component of Samba. This code, while still very experimental, can already
successfully process a logon request from a Windows NT Workstation
computer. It shouldn't be long before it will act as a full-fledged
Primary Domain Controller (PDC), storing user account information and
establishing trust relationships with other NT domains. Best of all,
Samba is freely available under the GNU public license, just
as Linux is. In many environments the Windows NT Server is required
only to provide file services, printer spools and
access control to a collection of Windows 95 machines. The combination
of Linux and Samba provides a powerful low-cost alternative to the
typical Microsoft solution.
<p>
<h3>Windows Networking</h3>
<p>
Understanding how Samba does its job is easier if you know a little
about how Windows networking works. Windows clients use file and
printer resources on a server by transmitting ``Server Message
Block''
over a NetBIOS session. NetBIOS was originally developed by IBM to
define a networking interface for software running on MS-DOS or
PC-DOS. It defines a set of networking services and the software
interface for accessing those services, but does not specify the actual protocol
used to move bits on the network.
<p>
Three major flavors of
NetBIOS have emerged since it was first implemented, each differing in
the transport protocol used. The original implementation was referred
to as NetBEUI (NetBIOS Extended User Interface), which is a
low-overhead transport protocol designed for single segment networks.
NetBIOS over IPX, the protocol used by Novell, is also popular. Samba
uses NetBIOS over TCP/IP, which has multiple advantages.
<p>
TCP/IP is already implemented on every operating system worth its salt,
so it has been relatively easy to port Samba to virtually every flavor of
UNIX, as well as OS/2, VMS, AmigaOS, Apple's Rhapsody (which is really
NextSTEP) and (amazingly) mainframe operating systems like CMS. Samba
is also used in embedded systems, such as stand-alone printer servers and
Whistle's InterJet Internet appliance. Using TCP/IP also means that
Samba fits in nicely on large TCP/IP networks, such as the Internet.
Recognizing these advantages, Microsoft has renamed the combination of
SMB and NetBIOS over TCP/IP the Common Internet Filesystem (CIFS).
Microsoft is currently working to have CIFS accepted as an Internet
standard for file transfer.

<h3>Samba's Components</h3>
<p>
A Samba server actually consists of two server programs:
<b>smbd</b> and <b>nmbd</b>. <b>smbd</b> is the core of Samba.
It establishes sessions, authenticates clients and provides access to
the file system and printers. <b>nmbd</b> implements the ``network
browser''. Its role is to advertise the services that the Samba server
has to offer. <b>nmbd</b> causes the Samba server to
appear in the ``Network Neighborhood'' of Windows NT and Windows 95
machines and allows users to browse the list of available
resources. It would be possible to run a Samba server without
nmbd, but users would need to know ahead
of time the NetBIOS name of the server and the resource on it they
wish to access. <b>nmbd</b> implements the Microsoft network
browser protocol, which means it participates in browser elections
(sometimes called ``browser wars''), and can act as a master or
back-up browser. <b>nmbd</b> can also function as a WINS (Windows Internet
Name Service) server, which is necessary if your network spans more
than one TCP/IP subnet.
<p>
Samba also includes a collection of other tools.
<b>smbclient</b> is an SMB client with a shell-based user interface,
similar to FTP, that allows you to copy files to and from other SMB
servers, as well as allowing you to access SMB printer resources and
send WinPopup messages. For users of Linux, there is also an SMB
file system that allows you to attach a directory shared from a
Windows machine into your Linux file system. <b>smbtar</b> is a
shell script that uses smbclient to store a remote Windows
file share to, or restore a Windows file share from a standard UNIX tar
file.
<p>
The <b>testparm</b> command, which parses and describes the
contents of your smb.conf file, is particularly useful since
it provides an easy way to detect configuration mistakes. Other
commands are used to administer Samba's encrypted password file,
configure alternate character sets for international use and
diagnose problems.
<p>
<h3>Configuring Samba</h3>
<p>
As usual, the best way to explain what a program can do is to show
some examples. For two reasons, these examples assume that you already
have Samba installed. First, explaining how to build and install
Samba would be enough material for an article of its own. Second, since Samba is
available as Red Hat and Debian packages shortly after each new stable
release is announced, installation under Linux is a snap. Further,
most ``base'' installations of popular distributions already
automatically install Samba.
<p>
Before Samba version 1.9.18 it was necessary to compile Samba
yourself if you wished to use encrypted password
authentication. This was true because Samba used a DES library to implement
encryption, making it technically classified as a munition by the
U.S. government. Binary versions of Samba with encrypted password
support could not be legally exported from the United States, which
led mirror sites to avoid distributing pre-compiled copies of Samba
with encryption enabled. Starting with version 1.9.18, Samba uses a
modified DES algorithm not subject to export restrictions.
Now the only reason to build Samba yourself is if you like to test the
latest alpha releases or you wish to build Samba with non-standard
features.
<p>
Since SMB is a large and complex protocol, configuring Samba can be
daunting. Over 170 different configuration options can
appear in the smb.conf file, Samba's configuration file. In
spite of this, have no fear. Like nearly all aspects of UNIX, it is
pretty easy to get a simple configuration up and running. You can
then refine this configuration over time as you learn the function of each
parameter. Last, the latest version of Samba, when this article
was written in late January, was 1.9.18p1. It is possible that the behavior of some of
these options will have changed by the time this is printed. As usual,
the documentation included with the Samba distribution (especially the
README file) is the definitive source of information.
<p>
The smb.conf file is stored by the Red Hat and Debian
distributions in the /etc directory. If you have built Samba
yourself and haven't modified any of the installation paths, it is
probably stored in /usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf. All of the
programs in the Samba suite read this one file, which is structured
like a Windows *.INI file, for configuration information.
Each section in the file begins with a name surrounded by square brackets
and either the name of a service or one of the special sections:
<tt>[global]</tt>, <tt>[homes]</tt> or <tt>[printers]</tt>.
<p>
Each configuration parameter is either a global parameter, which means
it controls something that affects the entire server, or a service
parameter, which means it controls something specific to each service.
The <tt>[global]</tt> section is used to set all the global
configuration options, as well as the default service settings.
The <tt>[homes]</tt> section is a special service section
dynamically mapped to each user's home directory. The
<tt>[printers]</tt> section provides an easy way to share every
printer defined in the system's <tt>printcap</tt> file.
<p>
<h3>A Simple Configuration</h3>
<p>
The following smb.conf file describes a simple and
useful Samba configuration that makes every user's home directory on
my Linux box available over the network.
<p>
<pre>
[global]
	netbios name = FRODO
	workgroup = UAB-TUCC
	server string = John Blair's Linux Box
	security = user
	printing = lprng

[homes]
	comment = Home Directory
	browseable = no
	read only = no
</pre>
The settings in the <tt>[global]</tt> section set the name of the
host, the workgroup of the host and the string that appears
next to the host in the browse list. The security parameter
tells Samba to use ``user level'' security. SMB has two modes of
security: share, which associates passwords with specific resources,
and user, which assigns access rights to specific users. There isn't
enough space here to describe the subtleties of the two modes, but
in nearly every case you will want to use user-level security.
<p>
The printing command describes the local
printing system type, which tells Samba exactly how to submit print jobs,
display the print queue, delete print jobs and other operations.
If your printing system is one that Samba doesn't already know how
to use, you can specify the commands to invoke for each print
operation.
<p>
Since no encryption mode is specified, Samba will default to using
plaintext password authentication to verify every connection
using the standard UNIX password utilities. Remember, if your
Linux distributions uses PAM, the PAM configuration must be modified
to allow Samba to authenticate against the password database. The
Red Hat package handles this automatically. Obviously, in many
situations, using plaintext authentication is foolish. Configuring
Samba to support encrypted passwords is outside the scope of this
article, but is not difficult. See the file ENCRYPTION.txt in
the /docs directory of the Samba distribution for details.
<p>
The settings in the <tt>[homes]</tt> section control the behavior
of each user's home directory share. The comment parameter
sets the string that appears next to the resource in the browse list.
The <tt>browseable</tt> parameter controls whether or not a service
will appear in the browse list. Something non-intuitive about the
<tt>[homes]</tt> section is that setting <tt>browseable = no</tt>
still means that a user's home directory will appear as a directory
with its name set to the authenticated user's username. For example,
with <tt>browseable = no</tt>, when I browse this Samba server I will see a share called
<tt>jdblair</tt>. If <tt>browseable = yes</tt>, both a share
called <tt>homes</tt> and <tt>jdblair</tt> would appear in the browse
list. Setting <tt>read only = no</tt> means that users should be able
to write to their home directory if they are properly authenticated.
They would not, however, be able to write to their home directory if the UNIX
access rights on their home directory prevented them from doing so.
Setting <tt>read only = yes</tt> would mean that the user would not be
able to write to their home directory regardless of the actual UNIX
permissions.
<p>
The following configuration section would grant access to every
printer that appears in the printcap file to any user that
can log into the Samba server. Note that the <tt>guest ok = yes</tt>
normally doesn't grant access to every user when the server is using
user-level security. Every print service must define <tt>printable =
yes</tt>.
<p>
<pre>
[printers]
	browseable = no
	guest ok = yes
	printable = yes
</pre>
This last configuration snippet adds a server share called
public that grants read-only access to the anonymous ftp
directory. You will have to set up the printer driver on the client
machine. You can use the <b>printer name</b> and <b>printer driver</b>
commands to automate the process of setting up the printer
client on Windows 95 and Windows NT clients.
<p>
<pre>
[public]
	comment = Public FTP Directory
	path = /home/ftp/pub
	browseable = yes
	read only = yes
	guest ok = yes
</pre>

<p>
Be aware that this description doesn't explain some subtle issues,
such as the difference between user and share level security and
other authentication issues. It also barely scratches the surface of
what Samba can do. On the other hand, it's a good example of how easy
it can be to create a simple but working smb.conf file.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
Samba is the tool of choice for bridging the gap between UNIX and
Windows systems. This article discussed using Samba on Linux in
particular, but it is also an excellent tool for providing access to
more traditional UNIX systems like Sun and RS/6000 servers. Further,
Samba exemplifies the best features of free software, especially when
compared to commercial offerings. Samba is powerful, well supported
and under continuous active improvement by the Samba Team.

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
The Samba home page, at http://samba.anu.edu.au/samba/, is the
definitive source for news and information about Samba. The 
documentation distributed with Samba is relatively
unorganized, but covers every aspect of server configuration. If you
have questions about Samba, first consult the FAQ, then try the
Samba Mailing List. The location of both can be found on the Samba
home page.

The book <i>Samba: Integrating UNIX and
Windows</i>, by John Blair and published by SSC, covers all aspects of 
installation, configuration and maintenance of a Samba server.
