<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Perhaps it's just my strong editorial preferences - or maybe my somewhat
naive expectation that technical material will be edited for accuracy - but
this book managed to hit the bottom of my personal rating system with a
solid "THUNK" in the first couple of pages. Misspellings, a clear absence
of post-production review (e.g., "At least one Network Interface Card NIC
is required..."), endless errors of basic grammar and diction, confusion in
the usage of conventions that are defined in the book's own preface - all
these added up to a nearly-instant impression of second-rate, amateur
publishing. (The "Errata" section was particularly amusing, stating as it
does that any errors reported will "save other readers from frustration";
the implementation of this would be fascinating, since it would require the
ability to reverse the flow of time.) Although I was still willing to be
convinced (after all, the preface may have been copied from boilerplate),
the problems remained and grew in scope as the book went on.
</p>

<p>
It is possible the authors are experts in networking and firewall
configuration; I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. If so,
that fact would be impossible to divine from this book: the statements made
about networking in general are often near-quotations of textbook material
that are only peripherally applicable to the subject at hand, and are
occasionally incorrect, outdated, or made with an obvious lack of
understanding of the underlying issues.
</p>

<p>
As a consultant and a professional technical instructor, I have on
occasion been required to teach in situations where I knew the student
materials to be poorly written. At those times, I advised the students to
arm themselves with pens - preferably red ones - and had them correct the
errors in the book as we worked through it. In retrospect, I believe that
those students learned more (<strong>and</strong> had a lot more fun in the
process) than the ones who had excellent materials from the start. Perhaps
this book would make an excellent foil for that sort of usage, as long as
it is taught by a competent professional with a sharp eye for errors - but
for a new user who is unfamiliar with the actual details of networking,
this book would be a poor start indeed.
</p>

"If you learn it right, you'll do it right the rest of your life. If you
learn it wrong, you'll do it wrong and spend the rest of your life trying
to learn to do it right."
 -- Sgt. Steve Prazenka
</pre>

<p>
Although I'm sure that <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hackworth">Hack's</a> old platoon
sergeant never read this book, his oft-stated dictum applies in full
here. This is not a book for those who want to learn it right.
</p>

<h3>Diving In Head-First</h3>

<p>
In the first chapter - in theory, the chapter that introduces firewalls and
the basic concepts of networking - the second paragraph contains a
statement that runs as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Don't worry if you don't understand all of the concepts we discuss -
equally, readers more comfortable with networking concepts should be able
to skip ahead. IPCop makes explicit understanding of many of these concepts
irrelevant, as it attempts to make administration simple and automated
wherever possible."
</pre>

<p>
I agree with the above in principle: the readers who are comfortable with
networking concepts <em>should</em> skip ahead - unless they want
entertainment. Readers who are not comfortable with networking concepts
should <em>also</em> skip ahead - all the way to the end of the book. Then
they should skip over to their computer, and thence to
<a href="http://www.ipcop.org/">http://www.ipcop.org/</a> where they can
click on the "Docs" tab - an excellent, detailed series of documents
written in plain English and addressing the specific issues and questions
of dealing relevant to IPCop. They'll have an easier time reading the
material, a better chance of understanding the concepts, and waste less
time on non-pertinent issues.
</p>

<h3>The Other Bits</h3>
<p>
The rest of the book is of much the same quality as the above, and consists
essentially of installation and configuration instructions without - as far
as I can tell - any expansion on or amplification of the material available
on the IPCop.org site. In all truth, a recap of the included material would
be tedious and would serve no one; consequently, you won't find it here.
</p>

<p>
Just for contrast, by the way: I spent about 10 minutes poking around in
the "Docs" section of the IPCop site, and was uniformly impressed with
everything I saw; when it came to this book, I was disillusioned within 2
minutes and became progressively more disappointed over the (approximately)
90 minutes that I spent conscientiously poring over its tortuous byways and
blind alleys.
</p>

<p>
In short, I wish I had my 90 minutes back.
</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I can say, with a clear heart, that I had no axe to grind as I went about
doing this review; the opposite, if anything. Kshipra Singh, the
representative of PACKT Publishing who contacted me, was most friendly and
cooperative, the book was in my hands very quickly after he offered to send
it to me for review, and the graphical design of the book cover is quite nice.
The end result, however, has caused me to underscore, in my mind, the old
truism: the Open Source community, at its best, performs far better work
than its commercial competitors. The contrast - as in this case - can be
glaringly obvious.

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
