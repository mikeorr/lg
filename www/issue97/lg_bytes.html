The Register has reported on Jon Johansen's latest contribution to the
controversial arena of digital rights management.  He has 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/34141.html">
created an open source software utility</a> that dumps the content of a
protected Quicktime encoded music track to a more easily handled format.
Some seemed to find these actions
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/35/34190.html">
upsetting</a>, though most Register readers seemed to be
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/35/34218.html">
more upset by the antics of the RIAA</a>.
<P>
Johansen is likely to remain in the news as his retrial on charges
relating to his involvement in the DeCSS code has
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/34295.html">just
begun</a> in Oslo.  Though acquitted in a lower court, the case (which
began five years ago) has been appealed.

The Register has also reported that

the FCC in the US has approved the controversial Broadcast Flag</a>.
Though the FCC claims that the measure is necessary to prevent piracy,

the Electronic Frontier Foundation contends</a>
that the rules will

some loopholes</a>
in the detail of the regulations relating to export of non-DRM enabled

<FONT COLOR="green">Diebold
</FONT>
</H3> 
<P>
Two contentious issues: electronic voting and the DMCA, have been at the
centre of a recent story regarding the Diebold company.  
<a href="http://www.diebold.com/">Diebold</a> specialises in ATMs,
electronic voting systems and similar products.  However, their voting
products have not been without their problems, the extent of which was
starkly highlighted in emails leaked from the company.  
<P>
Once the emails started to circulate on the internet, 
Diebold sought to lock down this embarrassing material by invoking the
dreaded DMCA.  Happily for the American electorate, the Online Policy
Group, backed by the EFF, 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/Legal/ISP_liability/OPG_v_Diebold/">
brought legal action against Diebold</a>
and forced the company 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/34286.html">
to back down</a>.
<P>
This is an important win, as the integrity of the voting system (and
people's ability to verify it) is fundamental to the functioning of
any democracy.  As Scott Granneman has pointed out, 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/34051.html">
e-voting has had a chequered history</a>, and it is imperative that it
be properly exposed to public and expert scrutiny.  This is not just an
American issue, as electronic voting machines are being installed in
countries around the world.  Some, such as those in Australia, use
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61045,00.html">
open-source software and operating systems</a>, but many (for example
<a href="http://www.p45blogs.net/blog_snorkeller/archives/000308.html">
the system being deployed in the Republic of Ireland</a>) leave a lot to
be desired in terms of transparency and openness.

</FONT>
</H3> 
<P>
As 
<a href="#debreport">
mentioned below</a>, several Debian project machines were recently
compromised by an attacker who took advantage of an exploitable flaw in
the 2.4 series of kernels.  Though this integer overflow in the brk
system call was not initially thought to have serious security
implications, now that an exploit is loose in the wild it is very
important that sysadmins patch their systems.  The problem has been
fixed in the 2.4.23 release of the kernel.
