OK guys, here's a n00b question for you that probably crosses over into
Sys Admin territory.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What steps should someone follow after Linux crashes to figure out what
went wrong?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Where do I start, and where do I look for clues?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Are all the logs found in <TT>/var/log</TT>, or are there others?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In what order should I look at the logs, and what should I look for?
</STRONG></P>

It depends what you think went wrong. Essentially:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>/var/log/messages
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
is where syslogd will dump all its data and so is the best place to look.
But there may well be application specific data in <TT>/var/log</TT>
(XFree86.0.log) is one such example.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

Any pro-active steps I should be taking to get more info, should it
happen again?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The specifics of my case: my file server (a 750 Mhz Athlon running Suse
9) simply locked up, and I couldn't get anything to display (GUI or
command line). I knew the machine was in trouble, when it didn't respond
to pings. I had to hit the reset button to get it back (and deal with
fsck, naturally). Funny thing is, the system clock reset itself to 28
minutes after midnight (when it should have read the middle of the
afternoon), but didn't loose the date. Odd, that. The machine's been
running 24/7 for about three weeks now (I set it up around then), and no
sign of problems until now.

This might be framebuffer related. At the lilo/grub prompt, type:

There have been snippets of these effects mentioned in the past. The one

I'm going to keep your response handy -- several things to try.
Meantime, I realized I was booting the thing into runlevel 5 (rather
stupid, actually), so I've since changed it to 3. If it is, as someone
suggested, a framebuffer problem, maybe that will solve it for now. I'm
using a real old Voodoo 3 card I scrounged from my parts bin. If it
happens again, I'll have to tear the machine apart and start playing
with the memory, as someone else here suggested.

That's because generally one doesn't do it quite like that. Problem
diagnosis is situation dependant. In any given situation there is often a
small set of files and related information that you can analyse without
having to worry about the rest of the system.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Granted, this is related to how much information one is told at the time
(if you've been on this list for as long as I have, you'll come to realise
that usually we don't get any), and whether or not the person has tried to
remedy it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In general though, poking around, taking an aspect of your system, looking
at what it does, and how is all related and helpful to you when you have to
come to diagnose anything.

Yes, well, I looked at the messages log, but saw only a gap time-wise
between cron processing around 4 in the morning, and the time of the
crash. I'm not sure which of the other logs are important in that case.
Where do I find the register dump (although I suspect it won't make much
sense to me, rather like those register dumps you get in Windows XP)?

Syslogd might have logged it, if the problem was software related, and
indeed if the said program produced any errors. If hardware then it
might not have, depending on the severity of the hardware failure.

It <EM>might</EM> be memory, but as the link I have you last time around said,
memory problems tend to be more 'visible' in the sense that you get a lot
of applications SEGFAULTing and SEGABRTing for no apparent reason. In such
instances, installing and running 'memtest86' is usually of help.

Most of the time I had the great luck of oopses and
kernel crashes occurring in the scsi layer, often hardware problems. If
the scsi layer is in trouble nothing will get written to disk. What's
software related regarding the kernel? The kernel deals with hardware,
and it's supposed to handle error conditions gracefully, i.e. not just
freeze without a hints whats gone wrong. But there are situations where
the kernel doesn't have a chance of leaving hints on the hard drive.

But I have to say that often enough I also do not try to hunt spurious
crashes which <EM>do</EM> occasionally happen. Either hardware causes or whatever.
You always can try a different kernel or simply hope for the best.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Still -- keeping the system on console 10 is not a difficult thing to do
and it just might give you something useful next time (note it down for
ksymoops if it's a oops or panic).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> has memtest as a boot option -- run it if you suspect the RAM, run it
long (several passes) and the full test suite if you don't find any
errors on the first go.

Thanks Karl and Thomas. This is the starting point I needed. (For one
thing, I didn't even know about console10: looks helpful).  I just wish
I had more from the crash than just a black screen, but that's what I
get for running X on bootup for a file server. Between the two of you, I
think I have the answers I was looking for when I started this thread:
not what went wrong exactly, but how to dig in, and try to figure it out
for myself.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Oh, Thomas, when I rebooted to runlevel 3, I entered that video setting
you suggested as well.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I just know I'll be back with more questions, though. One way or
another, I'll figure this Linux thing out.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks again, guys. Your help, as always, is much appreciated.
</STRONG></P>
