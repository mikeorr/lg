<P> "A scanner is a program that automatically detects security weaknesses in a
remote or localhost.".  Scanners are important to Internet security because
they reveal weaknesses in the network. System administrators can strengthen the
security of networks by scanning their own networks.  The primary
attributes of a scanner should be:
<UL>
	<LI> The capability to find a machine or network.
	<LI> The capability to find out what services are being run on the host
(once having found the machine).
	<LI> The capability to test those services for known holes.  
</UL>

<P> There are various
tools available for Linux system scanning and intrusion detection. 
I will 
explain some of the very 
famous tools available. I have divided the scanners into three categories:
<OL>
	<LI> Host Scanners
	<LI> Network Scanners
	<LI> Intrusion Scanners 
</OL>

<p><b><u>Host 
  scanners</u></b> <br>
  Host scanners 
  are software you run locally on the system to probe for problems. 
<p><b>Cops</b> 
  <br>
  COPS is a collection of security tools that are designed specifically to aid 
  the typical UNIX systems administrator, programmer, operator, or consultant 
  in the oft neglected area of computer security. COPS is available at: <a href="http://www.fish.com/cops">http://www.fish.com/cops</a> 
<p><b>Tiger</b> 
  <br>
  Tiger is a 
  UNIX Security Checker. Tiger is a package consisting of Bourne Shell scripts, 
  C code and data files which is used for checking for security problems on a 
  UNIX system. It scans system configuration files, file systems, and user configuration 
  files for possible security problems and reports them. You can get it from: 
  <a href="http://www.giga.or.at/pub/hacker/unix">http://www.giga.or.at/pub/hacker/unix</a> 
<p><b>check.pl</b> 
  <br>
  Check.pl a 
  perl script that looks through your entire filesystem, (or just the directory 
  you tell it to) for suid, sgid, sticky, and writeable files. You should run 
  it as a regular user maybe once a week to check for permission problems. It 
  will output a list of questionable files to stdout which you can redirect wherever. 
  It's available at: <a href="http://opop.nols.com/proggie.html">http://opop.nols.com/proggie.html</a>. 
<p><b><u>Network 
  scanners</u></b> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Network scanners are run from a host and pound away on other machines, looking 
  for open services. If you can find them, chances are an attacker can too. These 
  are generally very useful for ensuring your firewall works. 
<p><b>NSS (Network 
  Security Scanner):</b> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  NSS is a 
  perl script that scans either individual remote hosts or entire subnets of hosts 
  for various simple network security problems. It is extremely 
  fast. Routine checks that it can perform include the following: 
  <br>
  1:&nbsp; sendmail 
  <br>
  2: Anon FTP 
  <br>
  3: NFS Exports 
  <br>
  4: TFTP 
  <br>
  5: Hosts.equiv 
  <br>
  6: Xhost 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  NSS can be found at: <a href="http://www.giga.or.at/pub/hacker/UNIX">http://www.giga.or.at/pub/hacker/UNIX</a> 
<p><b>SATAN (Security 
  Administrator's Tool for Analyzing Networks):</b> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  SATAN is an automated network vulnerability search and report tool that provides 
  an excellent framework for expansion.Satan scans remote hosts for most known 
  holes: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  1: FTPD vulnerabilities and writable FTP directories <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  2: NFS&nbsp; vulnerabilities <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  3: NIS vulnerabilities <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  4: RSH vulnerability <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  5: sendmail <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  6: X server vulnerabilities SATAN performs these probes automatically and provides 
  this information in an extremely easy to use package. <br>
  you can obtain 
  SATAN from : <a href="http://www.fish.com/satan/">http://www.fish.com/satan/</a> 
<p><b>Strobe:</b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Strobe is Super optimised TCP port surveyor. It is a network/security tool that 
  locates and describes all listening tcp ports on a (remote) host or on many 
  hosts in a bandwidth utilisation maximising, and pro- cess resource minimising 
  manner. It is simple to use and very fast, but doesn't have any of the features 
  newer port scanners have. <br>
  Strobe is available at: <a href="ftp://suburbia.net/pub/">ftp://suburbia.net/pub/</a>. 
<p><b>Nmap</b>: 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Nmap is a newer and much more fully-featured host scanning tool. <br>
  Specifically, nmap supports:  
<ul>
  <li> Vanilla 
    TCP connect() scanning</li>
  <li> TCP SYN 
    (half open) scanning</li>
  <li> TCP FIN, 
    Xmas, or NULL (stealth) scanning</li>
  <li> TCP ftp 
    proxy (bounce attack) scanning SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses 
    some packet filters)</li>
  <li> TCP ACK 
    and Window scanning</li>
  <li> UDP raw 
    ICMP port unreachable scanning</li>
  <li> ICMP scanning 
    (ping-sweep) TCP Ping scanning Direct (non portmapper) RPC scanning Remote 
    OS Identification by TCP/IP Fingerprinting, and Reverse-ident scanning. <br>
     </li>
</ul>
<p> Nmap is available 
  at: <a href="http://www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html">http://www.insecure.org/nmap/index.html</a>. 
   
<p><b>Network 
  Superscanner</b>: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <a href="http://members.tripod.de/linux_progz/">http://members.tripod.de/linux_progz/</a> 
<p><b>Portscanner</b>: 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  PortScanner is a Network Utility especially designed to "scan" for listening 
  TCP ports. It uses a simple method to achieve its goal, and it is extremely 
  compact taking in account all of the options available. It's opensource and 
  free to use, you can get it at: <a href="http://www.ameth.org/%7Eveilleux/portscan.html">http://www.ameth.org/~veilleux/portscan.html</a>. 
<p><b>Queso:</b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Queso is a tool to detect what 
  OS a remote host is running with a pretty good degree 
  of accuracy . Using a variety of valid and invalid tcp packets to probe the 
  remote host it checks the response against a list of known responses for various 
  operating systems, and will tell you which OS the remote end is running. You 
  can get Queso from: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.apostols.org/projectz/queso/">http://www.apostols.org/projectz/queso/</a>. 
<p><u><b>Intrusion 
  Scanners</b></u> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Intrusion scanners are software packages that will actually identify vulnerabilities, 
  and in some cases allow you to actively try and exploit them.  
<p><b>Nessus:</b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Nessus is very fast, reliable and has a modular architecture that allows you 
  to fit it to your needs.Nessus is one of the best intrusion scanning tools. 
  It has a client/server architecture, the server currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD, 
  NetBSD and Solaris, clients are available for Linux, Windows and there is a 
  Java client. Nessus supports&nbsp; port scanning, and attacking, based on IP 
  addresses or host name(s). It can also search through network DNS information 
  and attack related hosts at your request. Nessus is available from <a href="http://www.nessus.org/">http://www.nessus.org/</a>. 
<p><b>Saint:</b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  SAINT is the Security Administrator's Integrated Network Tool. Saint also uses 
  a client/server architecture, but uses a www interface instead of a client program. 
  In its simplest mode, it gathers as much information about remote hosts and 
  networks as possible by examining such network services as finger, NFS, NIS, 
  ftp and tftp, rexd, statd, and other services. Saint produces very easy to read 
  and understand output, with security problems graded by priority&nbsp; (although 
  not always correctly) and also supports add-in scanning modules making it very 
  flexible. Saint is available from: <a href="http://www.wwdsi.com/saint/">http://www.wwdsi.com/saint/</a>. 
<p><b>Cheops:</b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Cheops is useful for detecting a hosts OS and dealing with a large number of 
  hosts quickly. Cheops is a "network neighborhood" on steroids, it builds a picture 
  of a domain, or IP block, what hosts are running and so on. It is extremely 
  useful for preparing an initial scan as you can locate interesting items (HP 
  printers, Ascend routers, etc) quickly. Cheops is available&nbsp;&nbsp; at: 
  <a href="http://www.marko.net/cheops/">http://www.marko.net/cheops/</a>. 
<p><b>Ftpcheck 
  / Relaycheck:</b> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Ftpcheck and Relaycheck are two simple utilities that scan for ftp servers and 
  mail servers that allow relaying. These are available from: <a href="http://david.weekly.org/code/">http://david.weekly.org/code/</a>. 
<p><b>BASS:</b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  BASS is the "Bulk Auditing Security Scanner" allows you to scan the Internet 
  for a variety of well known exploits. You can get it&nbsp; from: <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/data/tools/network/bass-1.0.7.tar.gz">http://www.securityfocus.com/data/tools/network/bass-1.0.7.tar.gz</a> 
<p><b><u>Firewall 
  scanners:</u></b> <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  There are also a number of programs now that scan firewalls and execute other 
  penetration tests in order to find out how a firewall is configured. 
<p><b>Firewalk:</b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Firewalking is a tool that employs traceroute-like techniques to analyze IP 
  packet responses to determine gateway ACL filters and map networks. Firewalk 
  the tool employs the technique to determine the filter rules in place on a packet 
  forwarding device. System administrators should utilize this tool against their 
  systems to tighten up security. Firewalk is available from: <a href="http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/Firewalk/">http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/Firewalk/</a>. 
<p><b><u>Conclusion:</u></b> 
<p>&quot;Security is not a solution, it's a way of life&quot;. System Administrators 
  must continuously scan their systems for security holes and fix the hole on 
  detection. This will tighten the security of system and reduce the chance of 
  security breaches. This process is a continuous process. The security vulnerabilities 
  will keep on arising and process of fixing the security holes will never end! 
  After all, &quot;Precaution is better than cure&quot;.
