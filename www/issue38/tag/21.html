Sorry for bothering you again but it seems that the "<tt>boot failed</tt>"
message was just a bad diskette. I accesed the setup main menu and it
asked me to configure the keyboard and i did, then i goes to: "partition
your HD", when i go to the partitioning menu i detects my HDD when i
press enter i get the message: "<tt>fatal error: bad logical partition</tt>".
What should i do?, in the installation howto it says the partitioning
option is for when my disk is not partitioned and it also says that if i
already created a linux native and one linux swap disk partition i can
skip the partitioning process.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In case i don't have to run the partitioning menu, how do i configure my
existing partitions into linux native an linux swap partitions?
</STRONG></P>

So, you're trying to install some distribution of Linux.
You don't mention which distribution so I'll guess it might
be <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>.  You don't mention 
what source you're trying to
install from so I'd guess CD-ROM.  You don't specify which
platform so I'll guess it's some sort of PC.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: there are many distributions of Linux and many of them
can be installed from any of many sources (from CD, floppy,
MS-DOS hard drive partition, over FTP, NFS, or SMB/Samba --
from a copy stored on some Windows, OS/2 or other type of
server).  When posting questions to mailing lists and
newsgroups you'll want to include a bit more detail.
Remember that your readers don't know anything about your
situation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, to your problem.  The setup/installation program you're
using is offering to launch a program to partition one of
your hard drives --- to reserve one or more regions of the
disk space for use by Linux and mark them as such.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The exact dialogs and menus offered by this installation
program depend completely on which distribution you're using.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Normally they will launch a program called '<tt>fdisk</tt>'.  There
are many programs called '<tt>fdisk</tt>' --- including the 
<tt>FDISK.COM</tt>
(or <tt>FDISK.EXE</tt>) from MS-DOS, and those from OS/2, NT, other
versions of Unix, and just about any other operating system
available for the platform).  Under Linux there are several
versions of '<tt>fdisk</tt>' to choose from.  Most distributions
include the old "shell mode" '<tt>fdisk</tt>' and some also give you
options to run a "friendlier" full-screen (curses based)
program called '<tt>cfdisk</tt>'.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Recent versions of Red Hat will offer to make many of
the partitioning decisions for you --- using a program
they call "Disk Druid."  You supply it with the sizes and
types of filesystems and swap spaces you want and it makes
a corresponding set of partitions.  It's a nice idea ---
but I never use it personally (I've been working with
micro-computers of one sort or another for almost 20 years).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given that I don't know anything about your system I
really don't know what is giving this error message.
I presume that there is some gibberish in your partition
table (specifically it sounds like some bogus enty in
one of the extents --- the "logical" partitions inside
of one of the extended partition tables.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's give a tiny bit of background here:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote>
The first first addressable sector on a
PC hard drive is called the MBR.  This is
512 bytes long and consists of two parts
--- a boot loader (a small program) and
the primary partition table.
</BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The primary partition table is 66 bytes
long.  This provides room for four partition
table entries of 16 bytes each, and a two
byte "signature" (magic number) that indicates
that this MBR/partition table has been
initialized.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When any version of '<tt>fdisk</tt>' first reads
the MBR for a given drive it is supposed
to look for the "signature" (0xAA55 hex,
or is it 0x55AA, I never remember that).
If the last couple of bytes in the MBR don't
match the signature then fdisk is supposed to
assume that the drive has completely unitialized
--- so that it won't attempt to interpret whatever
random noise it finds therein (left there by the
manufacturer's testing and/or production processes)
as any sort of existing partition table.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Notice that there are only FOUR entries available
on this table.  So, if we are to have more than
four filesystems/partitions on a drive we need
some way to  represent them.  Thus there is a
convention/standard that allows us to use ONE
of those entries to point to an "extended"
partition table.  This essentially daisy chains
from the boot sector to another sector.  In the
extended partition tables (there can be more
than one --- since you can have about a dozen
total) we have a whole sector, but only the last
66 bytes are used (the rest is normally "zero'd"
out).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Getting back to your error message.  If you don't have
anything else installed on that hard drive you can ignore
the error message and use fdisk to create your new
partitions.  If it won't "let you in" there could be other
problems.  I'd just boot on a rescue floppy (there should
be one included on whatever CD you have, some where ---
or you can get Tom's RTBT from <A HREF="http://www.toms.net/rb"
	>http://www.toms.net/rb</A>),
and "zero out" the MBR with a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><Code>
dd if=/dev/hda of=/dev/zero count=1 bs=512
</Code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... assuming that you're using your first IDE hard drive.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note: DON'T DO THIS IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS
DRIVE!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(You'll render any MS-DOS, Windows or other data on the
drive inaccessible!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If that still doesn't work, or if you have existing data
on the drive that you want to keep --- then we'll have to
work harder.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
First:  if '<tt>fdisk</tt>' won't let you access the drive, even
after you've "zero'd out" the MBR then you probably have
some sort of unsupported drive/controller.  It may be that
you have a very large HD and a version of the kernel and
'<tt>fdisk</tt>' that doesn't support the huge newer drives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are some amazing convolutions that we've gone through
in the design of PC peripherals over the years.  These
10Gb hard disks that you can pick up for a couple hundred
dollars are unimaginably expansive compared to the first
10Mb hard drive that I ever owned (about 12 years ago).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the early days MSDOS had a 32Mb limit on it's hard drive
filesystems.  The BIOS under which MSDOS ran had a rather
odd set of limits relating to the largest hard drive that
was possible --- it addressed drives in CHS (cylinder, head,
sector) format.  Early ST-506 (MFM and RLL) hard drives
typically had 17 to 23 sectors per track, maybe 5 or so
heads and a few hundred cylinders.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The BIOS packed the cylinder/track and sector addresses into
two bytes --- leaving 10 bits for the "cylinder" and only 6
bits for the sector.  So you you could have up to 64 sectors
(zero through 63) and 1024 cylinders.  They did provide
a full byte for the head.  (This seems silly since a
hard drive with 256 heads --- 128 platters would be about as
tall as your desk, but I presume that it was "convenient"
for the programmer due to how these parameters would be
used with the controller.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Back then the CPU was involved in relatively low level
details of head positioning --- so we used to tune the
"interleave" on hard drives based on the relative speed of
our components, so that logically "adjacent" sectors were
actually physically separated, allowing the processing of
one sector to account for the constant rotation velocity of
the disk platter under the head --- meaning that the "next"
sector was usually under the head after the last one was
processed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm going into these gory details for a point.  Modern
equipment is far more sophisticated.  A modern hard
drive has its own processor and cache.  The micro controller
processes going on in a typical cheap IDE or any SCSI drive
that you'd use today take about the same computing power
as the first PC that I ever used.  They also typically
<EM>have</EM> more memory than early PCs where capable of
addressing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Despite all these differences the fundamental interfaces
and BIOS code (particularly the limitation on CHS
addressing) still apply today.  To get around this
we've going through IDE, EIDE, and the newer Ultra-DMA
(or ATA, ATA-2, and ATA-3) interface specifications.
At each stage these drives use "tricks" to allow us
to access more data.  Usually these "tricks" provide
some level of "backward compatability" --- but they
often require some software upgrades nonetheless.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Instead of CHS addressing we now normally use LBA (linear
block addressing).  This basically takes the C, H, and S
values, multiples them together and calculates a new disk
block address based on the total.  That's a "linear block
address."  However a bit of arithmetic should reveal that
256 (max. heads) * 64 (max sectors per track) * 1024 (max
cylinders) * 512 (bytes per track) and then devided by about
a billion bytes per Gigabyte gives a limit of 8Gb.  So we
see that LBA doesn't get us past about 8.4Gb (you'll get
inconsistent numbers based on whether a given manufacture
counts megabytes as 1000 kilobytes or 1024K, and whether
they count a gigabyte as 1000Mb or 1024Mb).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The point is that older versions of Linux (and DOS,
Windows, NT, and everything else) won't be able
to access the full extent of some drives.  It's also
possible for your CMOS/BIOS settings to interfere with
the proper detection of your drive's capacity.  So,
sometimes you have to use various sorts of "expert mode"
or sfdisk options to bypass these sorts of problems.
More likely you need to have a kernel which is updated for
your situation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I must admit that I have yet to install any of these
HUGE disk drives.  I just picked up a 10.x Gb IDE drive
for less than $200 (US) and plan to install it in my
wife's computer (freeing up a couple of 4Gb SCSI drives
for my web server and mail hosts).  I haven't had to
do anything special on any of the other systems I've
worked with --- so I don't know what sort of problem
you're having.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can try '<tt>cfdisk</tt>' or '<tt>sfdisk</tt>' (prepare a rescue floppy
and either copy one of these unto it or unto another
diskette).  If any of these work --- you can <EM>THEN</EM> bypass
the portion of the setup/installation program where it
asks is you have already partitioned your disk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that you must have at least one ext2 filesystem and one
"swap" partition for Red Hat --- and most other Linux
distributions.  This is not a constraint of Linux --- it's
possible to install Linux on MSDOS/FAT, minix, xiafs or
other filesystems it you work at it.  You can even install
Linux to boot across a network.  However, these are exotic
options and most <EM>distributions</EM> don't have setup programs
that can cope with them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Clearly you don't want to "fight" with your first
installation by trying to be exotic.

If none of this works then I suggest reading more of the
FAQs, Mini-HOWTOs etc.  Also you can look for a local users
group and ask around.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some (like both the Silicon Valley LUG, and the Bay Area LUG
(*) that I belong to) have regular "installfests" where you
can bring your system into some cafeteria or auditorium and
work with volunteers (like me) to get things installed and
configured.  There are "swap meets" (public vendor shows)
which invite the CABAL (coalition of Bay Area Linux) user
groups to set up tables and hang out.  (Yes, we do this for
free --- all we get is free admission to the show and the
occasional free CDs, T-shirts or whatnot from some vendors).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> users also have these events (and join us
at some of the "swap meets" --- though they call them
"installoramas" or something like that).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you don't have any "installfests" or "installoramas" in
your area, you might still find some LUG member or local
Linux enthusiast to help.  If all else fails you can hire a
consultant to come in, help you install this and show you
how things work.  (That's the sort of consulting I
specialize in --- one-on-one tutorial work; usually in
person).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It used to be possible to call a 900 number (run by
Yggdrasil, makers of the first CD Linux distribution). You
can look at <A HREF="http://www.yggdrasil.com"
	>http://www.yggdrasil.com</A> for details.
(Yggdrasil is the "tree of life" in Norse mythology.  I have
no idea how that relates to Finnish folklore or if it is
intended as a reference to Linus' ethnic background at all.
But it is a cool name --- particularly for fans fo the old
Marvel superhero "Thor").  I don't know if Adam Richter,
founder of Yggdrasil is still in the Linux superhero
business --- but someone, somewhere will probably be
providing "per incident" phone support eventually.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(If I gathered a group of reliable and interested Linuxers
I'd consider doing it myself.  I don't because I'd hate to
be "on call" all the time and I'd hate even more to have
paying customers get a recording saying "Jim is off on a
date with his wife, Heather ... call back later!").
