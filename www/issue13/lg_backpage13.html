does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Bill Duncan</H4>
Bill has worked with Unix systems since the early Version 7 days on PDP-11's.
He worked with Xenix throughout most of the eighties and has also worked
with many other flavors of Unix over the years, but his operating system
of choice is now Linux.  When not working or fiddling with his four Linux

other hobbies; his dog (Daisy), photography and Amateur Radio.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Oleg Machulski</H4>
Oleg Machulski is a student of
   <A HREF="http://mech.math.msu.su/chislmet.htm"> Laboratory
                                      of Computing methods</A>

Mathematics</A>,
   <A HREF="http://www.msu.ru/">Moscow State University</A>.

He has been a Linux enthusiast since Sept.1996 as well as an OS/2 enthusiast.
After receiving the source of a 
very unusual DOS text editor, where the program was structurized
in a hypertext manner from his scientific advisor Andrey V. Astreling,
he wrote and ported the following functions:
search, macrocommands, multiple pages and so on.
Brief history of that freeware project could be found at
       http://shade.msu.ru/~machulsk/mmm/mmm.html
Also, I like to play guitar and listen to jazz music.
Additional info can be found at my homepage

James Shelburne</a></H4>
<P> 
James Shelburne currently lives in Waco, Texas where he spends most of 
his free time working on various Linux networking projects. Some of his 
interests include Perl + CGI, Russian, herbal medicine and the Ramones 
(yes, you heard right, the Ramones). He is also a staunch Linux advocate 
and tries to convert every MacOS/MS Windows/AMIGA user he comes into 
contact with. Needless to say, only other Linux users can stand him.

new mirror sites.

<img src="./gx/snow.gif" alt="" align=right>
I'd like to apologize for being later than usual getting
<i>LG</i> posted. The weather in Seattle has been a more than a little bizarre
lately. My
neighborhood got about 20 inches of snow from December 26 to December 29.
Since the normal yearly snowfall is about 4 inches, everything stopped,
including the buses for the first time in Metro history. SSC had a portion
of the roof give way under the weight of snow and water (the rains started
December 29 and haven't quit yet). As a result of the flooding, things are
in quite a mess around the office. Yearly rainfall in Seattle is usually 31
inches; this year we had 55 inches. I thought I was back in Houston!
<P> 
Actually, I was back in Houston during my vacation week before Christmas.
The weather wasn't
great there either -- rainy and cold, and I was counting on sunshine. However,
I still had a good time visiting with family and friends. My grandchildren, Sarah
and Rebecca, are a delight to be with -- I miss them a lot. 
<P> 
Have fun!
