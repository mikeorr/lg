Dear TAG,
I am a regular reader and wanted to first thank you for the great zine. I'll
probably be starting my own site/zine (long story short: 'tis all to keep in 
touch with my friends, who I have known for all my life but will have to 
leave them soon). The zine part won't be linux related(except maybe for one
column every now and then). 
</p>

<p>
I know I talk too much but, my question(s): When LG first started out, how did
you get the readers? How was it publicized? How did you get your very first 
reader? Also any tips (Kat? Ben? team?) ?
</p>

<p>
One more thing: Write more POLOTMs or else I'll have to resort to violent 
methods!

Hi there! I remember you. I was wondering how you were doing just
recently, in fact.
</p>

<p>
Dunno that I'd call what you're doing a 'zine' as much as a journal or
blog, but I wish you much joy with it (and the changes in your life).

I think at this point it would be helpful for you to know more about the
history of LG. Rick Moen wrote a wrapup for it awhile back here:
<a href="../../../issue96/moen.html">http://linuxgazette.net/issue96/moen.html</a>
</p>

<p>
I seem to recall there was another version detailing the early days, but
I don't have that one handy.
</p>

<p>
The other half of your answer is that LG doesn't really have the classic
profile of "start a 'zine'/website/blog and try to get it popular"
situation. And the person you'd really want to ask those questions isn't
actively involved anymore.
</p>

<p>
For real answers to your questions, you want to go looking at the advice
you can shake loose by doing a Google search on "popular blog", or
"creating a popular blog".
</p>

<p>
Additional factors include the tightknit nature of the FOSS community,
and the active involvement of many key members of LG staff in other
venues. LG, so far as I'm aware, doesn't (and hasn't) done much to
publicize or expand actively aside from putting out the best content we
can, month after month.
</p>

<p>
Some of our regular readers are very big advocates of LG, and I know
they do their bit to spread the word. Pramode CE often gets his students
involved.
</p>

<p>
The publicity rounds Ben and I did at SCaLE may be some of the very
first ever done for LG. I whipped up some business cards, and we passed
them out with glee, and did some active solicitation of articles and
participation. We also got interviewed by a podcaster, and collected
contact information for some upcoming features.

who threatened Ben...

Well actually the plan is supposed to be my very own little place ONLY for that
circle of friends I'm leaving, and the radius is considerable. All members will
have their own blogs on it plus a little chat thing(ie) that I haven't still 
made my mind about. The webzine idea came to me when I was thinking of a way 
to keep eveyone involved. It'll be a collection of poems, stories, linux 
columns(If I do write some, there will surely be links to LG), and what not, 
in fact anything that can possibly go into any kind of magazine. This little 
'zine' will be just for fun, but I was thinking about how one would make such a
collection known to the world, as it will probably get interesting in due time.
</p>

<p>
The thing is I'll have five months(!) of doing nothing at home due to the 
diffrence of starting times between the academic years of diffrent systems
(Egypt, where I'm headed and Oman, where I'm now) <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I don't want to get the blog 'popular' really, it is just to be read by my 
freinds. Everyone reads everyone else's blogs. The idea is to keep in touch.

You also have to consider the fact that it was a different world then.
Linux was relatively new, there were few information sources - it was
all small and more "personal". A focal point like LG was a major
change in the landscape, something truly exciting for Joe Linuxer; I
certainly found it so in those days, and looked forward to each issue
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
Today, the landscape is quite different - and the process of gaining
readers by providing valuable content is poisoned by scammers and
spammers trying to suck people in via specialized SEO techniques, link
exchange, etc.; a case of "bad money driving out the good." Frankly, I
don't know that any advice I can give you would be of any use; I have no
magic readership-building techniques. All I've ever tried to do here at
LG is provide the best content possible and rely on our readers' good
sense and judgement.

<p>
My suggestion would be to join the LG volunteer staff and learn it from
the inside. It's probably the best chance you'll ever have to get a good
look and some excellent practice in what it takes to run an on-line
publication of this sort. If you're interested, please take a look at
<a href="../../../jobs.html">http://linuxgazette.net/jobs.html</a> - there's plenty to do.

Well, OK then. I was just about to create a low, nasty character in
POLOTM named MNZ... but I guess I'll refrain. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
