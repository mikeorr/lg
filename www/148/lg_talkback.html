Hi TAG,
I really enjoyed this article, just what I need! But there's only one
problem, the DMA on the hard-disk. I've always used a very
similar approach to the one mentioned in the article to set DMA
on on my disks, the problem is INIT doesn't actually start when
waking up from hibernation and so DMA is not set which makes
reading the image (and booting, therefore) a very painfully long
process. Any ideas on other ways to set DMA that don't involve
INIT?

&gt; Hi,
&gt;
&gt; In my project I am going to send newsletters to our clients. Here I need to

&gt; SA will check the both header and body content like ,
&gt;
&gt; .ie n .IP "$score = $status\fR\-&gt;\fIget_head_only_points()" 4
&gt; .el .IP "$score = \f(CW$status\fR\-&gt;\fIget_head_only_points()\fR" 4
&gt; .IX Item "$score = $status-&gt;get_head_only_points()"
&gt; Return the message's score as computed for auto\-learning, ignoring
&gt; all rules except for header-based ones.
&gt; .ie n .IP "$score = $status\fR\-&gt;\fIget_learned_points()" 4
&gt; .el .IP "$score = \f(CW$status\fR\-&gt;\fIget_learned_points()\fR" 4
&gt; .IX Item "$score = $status-&gt;get_learned_points()"
&gt; Return the message's score as computed for auto\-learning, ignoring

&gt; .ie n .IP "$score = $status\fR\-&gt;\fIget_body_only_points()" 4

There still not any good device mapper documentation out there, you page was
a great help to me!
</p>

<p>
I am trying to do this.
</p>

<p>
 I have a loopback filesystem, that I am trying to snapshot.
</p>

<p>
so
</p>

<p>
myfile--------/dev/loop0
</p>

<p>
cow1--------/dev/loop1
cow2--------/dev/loop2
cow3--------/dev/loop3
cow4--------/dev/loop4
</p>

<p>
you document allowed me to a snapshot of /dev/loop0, and cow the changes to
/dev/loop1
</p>

<p>
can, I do the same with loop2,3,4?
</p>


<p>
i.e. I have 4 file system cow, from the same filesystem?
</p>

<p>
hope you can help, thanks for a great article.

Hello,

<p>
Please pay attention to unmounting script in "Mounting and umounting" section:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
==================
#!/bin/sh
 
umount /backup
lvremove backuplv
vgremove cryptvg
cryptsetup remove crypt1
cryptsetup remove crypt2
==================
</pre>

<p>
Commands `lvremove backuplv` and `vgremove cryptvg` will remove logical volume 
and its volume group. It is not unmounting but ~erasing~
</p>

<p>
I knew nothing about lvm while reading your article so I deleted important 
data while running 'unmounting' script blindly.
</p>

<p>
Please correct the article.

You're welcome, and thanks for the feedback. SMTP AUTH is more popular

&gt; I,ve read your article about measuring tcp congestion window. Maybe I
&gt; can ask you, how to use tcp_info structure in my Apache code (more
&gt; specifically in sendfile_it_all function in core_filters.c. I want to
&gt; get the time to transfer last byte sent in order to schedule the
&gt; packet sent to client according to that metric), cause I really realy
&gt; confused with the Apache source code. Or, do you know what part in
&gt; Apache that provide the time to transfer last by sent to client.
</pre>

<p>
The tcp_info structure contains statistics derived from an active TCP
connection. getsockopt() fills the structure with data. An example
function call from my article in #136 looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
getsockopt( tcp_work_socket, SOL_TCP, TCP_INFO, (void *)&amp;tcp_info,
&amp;tcp_info_length );
</pre>

<p>
I looked into the code for core_filters.c in a httpd 2.2.8 distribution.
Basically the sendfile_it_all() function reads a file and sends it to
the network by using sendfile(). There's not much you can tune there
since sendfile() does most of the buffering. You could periodically call
getsockopt() with the TCP_INFO option, but you'd only get the TCP
parameters. You cannot influence the TCP connection when it transfers
date, it is handled by the kernel. You can only use one of the TCP
congestions algorithms and set some parameters of the TCP stack (either
through /proc/sys/net/... or by using socket options such as TCP_CORK).
</p>

<p>
If you want to do any timing you have to do the buffering yourself, send
chunks of data and take the time after every buffer transmit. That's
what I did in my example code, but that's not what you want to do in
production code. The Linux kernel has the TCP stack and should deal with
the details. The kernel also keeps track of TCP parameters used with
recent clients. An application usually doesn't see all of this.
</p>

<p>
As far as the Apache code is concerned, I don't know where or whether
Apache stores the time of transfers. There are some options for the
socket code, so I'd look for the persistant connections (KeepAlive,
etc.) or all things that deal with the socket handling.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.

I usually leave file names as they are unless I have reason to suspect
something nasty in them (like a forward slash, which is the only
character that's not allowed in filenames - at least in Unix). If I'm
going to process them at all, I make it simple:
</p>

<pre>
tr/A-Za-z0-9/_/cs;
</pre>

<p>
This replaces any characters that don't appear in the first list with an
underscore, and squashes any repeated underscores. If I'm feeling
especially energetic, I might add the following:
</p>

<pre>
s/^_?(.*?)_?$/$1.html/;
</pre>

<p>
This will remove any leading/trailing underscores from the result. It's
also a good place to add the '.html' extension.

<p>
This last line may be standard practice in C, etc., but it's unnecessary
(and deprecated) in Perl. The same is true for the parens in your
'open', 'close', and 'rename' calls: punctuation that doesn't have a
specific reason for being there should be omitted.

Hello,
</p>

<p>
This is a nice intro to screen.
</p>

<p>
As you might expect ... some additional pointers from a long time
screen user <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<pre>
1. Your method of binding the C-\ key to command might cause you
   grief. The suggested method is "escape ^\\".
 
   You can also bind a "function key" to the screen command with
   something like "bindkey -k &lt;keyname&gt; command". The list of
   &lt;keyname&gt;s can be found in "man -s5 termcap" under the section
   "String Capabilities". I use "F1" which is the F11 key. (It should
   have been F12 but that is for the window manager).
 
   You can also use some command like "escape ^^^" to
   override the default C-a being bound to the escape key.
   There currently seems to be no way to specify "no escape key" to
   screen which is a bit unfortunate!
 
2. You can also use "C-a '&lt;initial char(s) of window name&gt;" to switch
   to a window for example "C-a 'Eli" followed by enter will switch
   to that window.
</pre>

<p>
Some other things to have fun with in screen are "nethack mode" and
more seriously cut-and-paste and multi-user mode.
</p>

Sir,
   
  I am a student of BE Electronics and communication, As a part of final
year cirriculum we have a subject in which we have to make a project. so
we choose to make a project in which we will measure performance of
various TCP variants like TCP tahoe, reno, new reno, sack etc with help
of netword emulator tool NISTnet. we have faced a problem that current
version of linux (fedora) uses sack but we want to use older version of
TCP like tahoe and reno etc so what should we do is there kernel
available where we could get this version and could install  them or is
that we just have to modify the codes in networkstack please tell us the
solution which is possible and also state that through which link will
we get the required kernels and the name of kernel if possible.
   
  Thanking you.

Loved the article, but what if you have DHCP and Linux Mint still doesn't
find the Internet (so no updates of new programs;{
Went to Network and filled in workgroup and machine names, my router hands
out IPs...System see's the hardware...do I have to Mount the eth0, and if so
how does one do that.
Thanks for the great web page, and in advance for your help. This is the 4th
Linux I've tried over the years, looks ALMOST easy enough for me!
This machine dual boots to Xp and that can see the Internet, home built
Athlon 1700 machine, multiple hard drives, wired to the router, and through
that to cable.

best,

Hello!
</p>

<p>
While getting in touch with some colleagues who had a slight misfortune
with the dd command and image files, Google directed me to the "Right To
Your Own Devices" article in LG #114. The device mapper is indeed very,
very useful.
</p>

<p>
Image you have a big dump file created with dd from a whole disk.
</p>

<pre>
dd if=3D/dev/hda of=3D/mnt/usb/big_dump.img
</pre>

<p>
Now imagine your /dev/hda device was a disk with multiple partitions.
How can you access the partitions individually? Try the device mapper.
By using the dmsetup command directly you have to use offsets to get
to the right partition(s). There's an easier way. The command kpartx
can automatically create device mapper devices from a dumpfile. kpartx
is part of the "multipath-tools" package (at least on Debian, Ubuntu and
Gentoo). Create a loopback device backed by the image file and use
kpartx:
</p>

<pre>
losetup /dev/loop0 /mnt/usb/big_dump.img
kpartx -a /dev/loop0
</pre>

<p>
After that you will find the mapped devices for every partition in
/dev/mapper/. You can remove the devices by using the following command:
</p>

<pre>
kpartx -d /dev/loop0
</pre>

<p>
"kpartx -l /dev/loop0" gives you a list of the partitions with lines
that can be used in a dmsetup description table.
</p>

<p>
Make sure that your kernel and your device mapper utils match. Best use
recents versions or the ones from your distribution.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.
</p>

<p>
