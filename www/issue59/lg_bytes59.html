"Internet content and service providers must keep records of all the content

<p>Definitions of illegal content are vague, such as "spreading rumors",
"disrupting social stability", gambling and pornography.
The rules also forbid "harming ethnic unity" and "advocating cults and
feudal superstition" -- terms often invoked to prosecute suspected Tibetan
independence activists and members of Falun Gong and other spiritual movements.

Helps Researchers Fight Disease</font></h3>
SANDY, UTAH, Oct. 3, 2000 - <a href="http://www.linuxnetworx.com">Linux
NetworX, Inc.</a>, a provider of large-scale clustered computer solutions,
announced today that the National Center for Macromolecular Imaging (NCMI)
at
<a href="http://www.bcm.tmc.edu">Baylor College of Medicine</a> will
use the company's clustered computers in its world-renowned molecular imaging
research center.
<p>Using a 32-processor cluster system from Linux NetworX, Baylor College
of Medicine reconstructs the molecular configurations of disease and illness-causing
viruses and other molecules and develops three-dimensional models of their
structures. A cutting-edge technique then allows researchers to view the
viruses as if they were locks. By properly studying these "locks," they
hope to find the "keys" to opening and destroying them. In the past, much
of this research was done on large supercomputers costing millions of dollars.
But today, because of price-performance issues, clustered-computer alternatives
are being selected to handle the large amounts of computation, data handling
and storage required.
<p>In the past, scientists used trial and error methods to create vaccines
and drugs to fight viruses. But now, using clustered computers and other
technologies, they are able to define the structure of these viruses and
attempt to design drugs that will solve the specific problems each one
presents.
<p>In further good news for the company, the Linux NetworX Evolocity (TM)
cluster server receives Best of Show Award for Network Servers &amp; Peripherals
from InernetWeek and Network Computing at NetWorld+Interop 2000 Atlanta.
The Evolocity cluster server, introduced at the show, is designed for managing
and optimizing Web traffic in the Internet market.
