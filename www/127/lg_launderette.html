<p><small>Thu, 27 Apr 2006 </small></p>
<p><strong>From Rick Moen 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>

<pre><strong>Quoting Keith Owens (kaos@ocs.com.au):

&gt; A survey of DNS security[1] has this lovely quote
&gt;
&gt;   "A cracker that controls a nameserver at Monash University in
&gt;   Australia can end up controlling the resolution of the web site for
&gt;   the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine. Legacy DNS creates a small
&gt;   world after all".
&gt;
&gt; It is scary to see how [potentially] insecure the DNS mesh is.
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Dan Kaminsky gave an amazingly entertaining and enlightening lecture at
the LISA 2005 conference, in part about his own studies of the global
DNS, to determine among other things how vulnerable to cache poisoning
it is:  Answer: a great deal.  There are way, way too many vulnerable
BIND8, BIND4 and other (e.g., Microsoft) vulnerable nameservers out there.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Dan was able to set up a machine with sufficient bandwidth and
horsepower that it's been able to conduct scans of all IP space,
everywhere, doing various tests and mapping out all responding
nameservers.  He says he "got calls from some very scary places" in so
doing (since such scans normally precede a large-scale network attack),
but he's been able to placate them.  (The IP reverse-resolves to
"infrastructure-audit-1.see-port-80.doxpara.com", the Web pages on
which explain his probes when they're active, and include his cellular
number for any inquiries.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Also, if you do a "whois" on his netblock, you get return values that
include these lines:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>  Comment:    This is a security research project, please send all
  Comment:    abuse and alert requests to dan@doxpara.com.
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
His summary results (from 50GB of collected data) included:
</STRONG></P>

<p><Strong><ul>
<!-- * He profiled 2.5M verified nameservers.  (There may be up to 9M total, but 2.5M responded.) -->

<LI>He profiled 2.5M verified nameservers.  (There may be up to 9M total, but 2.5M responded.)

<!-- * Almost 10% of them, 230 thousand, forwarded queries to BIND8.  Eek! -->

<LI>Almost 10% of them, 230 thousand, forwarded queries to BIND8.  Eek!

<!-- * At least 13 thousand Windows nameservers forward to BIND8. -->

<LI>At least 13 thousand Windows nameservers forward to BIND8.

<!-- * He found probable evidence of large-scale cache poisoning already in progress, but isn't yet ready to discuss details. -->

<LI>He found probable evidence of large-scale cache poisoning already in progress, but isn't yet ready to discuss details.
</ul></Strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
As an afterthought, he realised that his test harness also enabled him
to estimate the penetration of Sony's infamous Windows rootkit, as
measured by its effect on the world's nameservers:  All infected
machines' rootkit software feeds data back to connected.sonymusic.com,
reached by hostname (thus entailing resolution at some local nameserver,
which thus loads its cache).  Dan thus used his census of the world's
nameservers to send each a non-recursive "A" query:  This returned the
matching IP if and only if the value was already cached.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Result:  He found 556 thousand nameserver hosts with the cached value --
a quarter of the world.  (This is <em>  after  </em> massive publicity and
large-scale attempts to purge the rootkit.)  Oddly, these were across
165 countries, and suggests this reflects bootlegging of USA-labelled
music CDs.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Interesting remaining questions include estimating (through
traffic-level studies) how many infected Windows clients this result
reflects.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
...and he's working on other ways to further exploit his DNS data.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Dan's a maniac.  At the <em>  prior  </em> LISA conference, he'd demonstrated
streaming audio over DNS packets -- to illustrate exactly how porous
most people's "firewall" strategies are.  Because he heard that many
people had dismissed that as "Well, that's just low bitrate; couldn't be
significant", <em>  this  year, he demonstrated streaming  video  </em> over DNS.

<p><small>Tue, 09 May 2006 </small></p>
<p><strong>From Rick Moen 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Our cherished Ma Bell reincarnation, SBC (which is in the middle of
re-naming itself to AT&amp;T, thus completing the circle), found a creative
way to screw up relocation of our telephone service:  They unilaterally
rescheduled it (for fairly dumb reasons) -- and then decided not to tell
us.  As a reminder, this matter affects lists.linuxgazette.net's online
presence because its Raw Bandwidth Communications DSL service piggybacks
atop SBC's line.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What happened, you ask?  Here are my wife and me, about 5:20 pm Monday,
sitting on the living room floor, calling Ma Bell from our still-active
telephone:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>  Deirdre:  "Hey, what happened to the telephone move order you guys
  agreed with me to perform today for 650-561-9820?  It's not happening."

  SBC:  "Er, that job is listed in our records as rescheduled to
  Wednesday."

  Deirdre:  "WHAT?  Why?"

  SBC:  "Well, the outgoing occupants had not released the line, and so
  it would not be available to you until they did, which would be when
  they scheduled shutoff, i.e., Wednesday."

  Deirdre:  "And you were somehow incapable of ascertaining this fact at
  the time you committed to a _Monday_ due date -- because, what, you're
  more accustomed to hanging draperies for a living?  And you were
  incapable of calling my contact telephone number to advise us of the
  delay because you needed, what, smoke signals?  Semaphores?  Telegraph
  lines?  Carrier pigeons?"

  SBC:  {mumble}  {snivel}
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Anyhow, considerations of logic and customer service do not apply, so
it's going to be Wednesday -- which means our new house will be sans
telephone and DSL service until then.  Our <em>  old  </em> house still has
service, and our servers are still camped out on the living room floor
-- but I'm removing them tonight in order to turn over the house to the
landlords.  So, from around 10 PM tonight until SBC/AT&amp;T reconnects
telphone service, and then I reconnect the DSL -- probably around a full
day, unless things get further screwed up.

How could I possibly miss it?  For those of us who grew up on the Doctor
(my canonical one being Jon Pertwee, the third Doctor), it's a
veritable dream come true.  I'm undecided whether "Father's Day" or
"Dalek" should get my vote for the short-form Best Dramatic Presentation
Hugo Award:  They both blew me away.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
BTW:  I'm about 60km south of San Francisco, in the Silicon Valley
Desert -- and am indeed guilty of being a Yank.  However, I grew up in
7B Bowen Road flat 19A, Victoria, Hong Kong, Royal Crown Colony, where
your only choices in television were Rediffusion Television (sort of a
Granada/Carlton ancestor, under the 1968 ITV franchise round) or
Cantonese opera.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I saw a great deal of 'Doctor Who' and first-run 'The Prisoner', in
consequence -- not to mention coming up with much fine MST3K-style
replacement dialogue for Cantonese operas, with my mother.  All of which
explains a great deal, I'm sure.

Heh. The next time I saw her, she looked like she wanted to say
something difficult - starting to talk, but not; red face; voice

back to normal. (I suppose, in hindsight, I could have made a bit more
effort with the first explanation. Oh well.)

Except then, later that evening, I went to visit some friends: I wanted
to bring something with me, and had to tell the story, so I bought
flowers. Two bunches, because another couple I know were going to be
