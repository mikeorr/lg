<P>
Hello,
</P>
<P>
I'm hoping this will drum up some replies.  I'm tumbling head-first into
the world of python and ncurses for this, and know very little about both.
</P>
<P>
To cut a long (and rather boring) story short, I run
<a href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a>
in a screen
session on my poor P166 server.  X11-forwarding is not an option as I
don't have nor want X11 installed, and it's damn slow even if I did.
But one useful feature is using one of the many scripts off of irssi's
website, I can get irssi to scrape urls into a text file.  "Wooooo, I
hear you say".
</P>
<P>
Well, it is nice.  And thanks to network transparency, I am able to tail
that logfile via shfs (ssh filesystem, essentially).  So then I got to
thinking.  What's an easy way of displaying the URLs in the file?  I
remembered a program that ships (often) with mutt -- "urlview".  It
scans a file for a regexp for URLs and presents a means of selecting
them and launching them.  Brilliant.  Except... it expects a file --
piping to stdin blocks.
</P>
<P>
Bah!  I don't want to hack the source-code, unblocked I/O in C is a
headache.  So I stumbled across pyurlview [1]  a replacement written in
Python.  It's "ok" and is in a language I can read.
</P>
<P>
What I'm wanting to do is emulate this:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>tail -f ./some_file | pyurlview
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Now that doesn't work as-is.  So I thought about it a bit, and came up
with this little bit of python code (which I hope is the correct "way"
to do it):
</P>

<blockquote><pre>#! /usr/bin/env python
import os,sys

while 1:
  #sys.stdin.fileno()
  s = sys.stdin.readline()
  print "Got", s
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Which seems to work when one does:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>tail -f ./foo | testfile.py
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
So I thought I'd try and incorporate that idea into the pyurlview script
[1] I tried all I might, to no avail.  The closest I got was here [2]
but that's mangling everything and isn't functioning like in the example
I correctly showed above.
</P>
<P>
So if someone can see the error in logic, do say.  Or does anyone know
of an existing program that will do what I want?  I can use any form of
scripting language to do it (awk, ruby, etc) already -- but it's more
the curses and non-blocking I/O I'm interested about.  Plus, I'd rather
not reinvent the wheel, hence battling it out with python.  <EM>maybe</EM> I
could use 'multitail' but it's UI sucks for what I am wanting.
</P>
<P>
Thanks In Advance,
</P>

Hi Guru's.
</P>
<P>
I'm a novice as far as Linux goes and want to attend a course but don't
know which flavour to go for or who supplies the best training. From
what I have seen my choice should be between RedHat and <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>..
</P>
<P>
Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
Thanks in advance,
<BR>Gavin.

When it comes to shell scripting I am a rank novice, but it seemed to me that the passage
"if $1 has a length of zero, then the following statements (echo... echo... exit) should be executed" (quotes not mine)
should read
"if $1 <EM>does not have</EM> a length of zero, then the following statements (echo... echo... exit) should be executed"
</STRONG></P>
<P>
In fact, the article is correct - the
</P>
<P><CODE>
[ -z "$1" ] &amp;&amp; { ... }
</CODE></P>
<P>
construct will execute the statement block if $1 is zero length; the
"-z" operator returns "true" in that case. You can try it on the command
line:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~$ foo=abcdefg     # Give some value to 'foo'
ben@Fenrir:~$ [ -z "$foo" ] &amp;&amp; echo "Foo is empty"
ben@Fenrir:~$ foo=     # Unset 'foo'
ben@Fenrir:~$ [ -z "$foo" ] &amp;&amp; echo "Foo is empty"
Foo is empty
</pre></blockquote>

<P>
Hi Gang,
</P>
<P>
Just a quick note about the difference between "Voice recognition" and
"Speech recognition".
</P>
<P>
Voice recognition means recognizing "The person who is speaking". This
is a means of identifying people/persons by listening to their voice.
We all do this whenever we use the phone and know who is on the other
end as soon as they start talking.
</P>
<P>
Speech recognition means recognizing the words being spoken.
</P>
<P>
Voice recognition tools are used to identify people as part of access
security systems.
</P>
<P>
Speech recognition tools (Dragon Naturally Speaking, ViaVoice) are used
to "speak" into a computer microphone and have that computer understand
what words you said.  Currently Naturally Speaking seems to hold the
edge in recognition accuracy. This can vary from person to person.
</P>
<P>
Janine's articles,  [issue 113]  Voice recognition shorthand and the
birth of Weblish and  [issue 87]  Linux-Based Voice Recognition
are actually about Speech recognition, not voice recognition.
</P>
<P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Thanks for clarifying the distinction, Jeff; we'll pass this on to our
readers. I suspect that the common usage isn't likely to change much as
a result - but, to misquote Larry Wall, I do occasionally struggle
feebly against ignorance, and I admire other people's efforts in that
direction as well.

Hi, I am using debian unstable with firefox 1.0.2, I
try to use the
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/cgi-bin/TWDT.pdb"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/cgi-bin/TWDT.pdb</A> and put in
the issue number. but it always d/l issue 113 no
matter what I put in.  I want to d/l the older issues
in palmdoc format, how do I do it?  Thanks

Well, being The Nice Guy that I am 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">, I've just tweaked the chunk of
CGI that generates that file to be a bit more flexible; what
you're asking for is now available. You can grab any past issue that
contains a TWDT.html in PalmDoc format by going to

<BLOCKQUOTE>

where NAME is the name of the issue. Do note, however, that
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Not all of the past LG issues have a TWDT.html (which is what's used to generate the PDB doc.)


<LI>Issues before #100 are actually called "issueXX", where 'XX' is a two-digit issue number (i.e., leading zeros for low numbers.)
</ol></blockQuote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To make it simpler, you can use any sort of a bogus string for NAME, and
you'll get a list of all issues with links that will return a PDB for
that issue. I hope that helps.
