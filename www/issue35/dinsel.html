The Happy Hacking Keyboard is a cute and fuzzy streamlined keyboard designed
specifically with programmers in mind. While not a single bit of fuzz is
actually on the keyboard, its size makes it cute, if not disorienting, to
people used to the standard IBM PC keyboard.
<p>

<p>
According to PFU America, the keyboard's
design makes it easier for programmers to reach the keys they want quickly
and efficiently. They claim having fewer keys on the keyboard increases
efficiency by preventing users from overextending their fingers on certain
keystrokes.
<p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
The Happy Hacking Keyboard arrived in a tiny box shortly after I agreed to
do a review of the product. Inside were the keyboard and three cables (for a PS/2,
Macintosh and Sun computer) along with the usual manual and warranty
information.
<p>
PFU America recently changed the
package, and lowered the price. The Happy Hacking Keyboard now comes with only one
cable (of the customer's choice), but additional cables are available for
$35.00 each. The cables are expensive because they are handmade by the people at
PFU America.
<p>
The manual was fairly straightforward--after all, almost everyone knows
how to hook up a keyboard. However, with the many cables that accompanied the
keyboard, it was comforting to know that documentation was available should
it be needed.
<p>
After the computer was powered down, I said goodbye to my 101 Enhanced keyboard
and hello to blissful days of Happy Hacking. Or so I thought--I had to grab
a PS/2 to AT keyboard adapter first.
<p>
<h3>Life is a Series of Adjustments</h3>
<p>
The keyboard is streamlined, containing only 60 keys. A function key is included
that can be used in combination with other keys; as a result, awkward finger
positioning is sometimes required. My first days using the keyboard
reminded me of playing Twister and trying to reach the red dot by squeezing
my arm past two opponents while keeping my feet on the orange and blue dots on
opposite sides of the mat. In fact, two weeks later, I was still
finding myself reverting to my old PC keyboarding habits. Some complex key
sequences were hard to complete correctly, as old habits die hard.
<p>
Also, in the beginning, the backspace key didn't work; however, this
turned out to be primarily my fault. Being lazy and excited to test out the
new keyboard, I refrained from reading all the way through the manual to the
final (third) page where a table and accompanying figure would have
taught me how to program the keyboard using a slider switch. Eventually, I
toggled the switch and had the backspace key working to my satisfaction.
<p>
Since I started using Linux before Windows 95 was introduced (I stopped using
MS products long before that), I did not miss the extra
``Windows'' keys found on most PC keyboards. I did, however, have
to get used to console cruising with the new keyboard. Switching from X to
the console requires a four finger/key combination
(<tt>ctrl-alt-fn-f*</tt>,
where fn is the function key), while cruising through consoles
requires a three finger/key combination
(<tt>alt-fn-<i>arrow-key</i></tt>).
<p>
Even in a non-<b>vi</b>-type editor without command mode movement keys, the Happy
Hacking Keyboard makes the user adjust to finding the location of the arrow pad and
remembering to hit the function key. In all fairness, it took me less
than a week to become oriented with the key locations. (It does remain comical
to watch others try to wander through the key selections for the first
time.)
<p>
Unlike a laptop, the size and shape of the keys are the same as on a PC keyboard,
making it easier to adjust. I never overreach the true location of
the keys and don't have a difficult time typing something on other people's
computers (who don't have a Happy Hacking Keyboard). However, I am now known to
complain about how ``weird'' other keyboards are.
<p>
<h3>Happy Hacking</h3>
<p>
While the keyboard did not cure me of my sarcastic nature, I did find the
escape key much easier to reach since it's located to the immediate left of the
``1'' key. In vi, I can quickly switch out of insert mode since I never have to
look down to relocate the escape key or reposition my fingers afterwards; thus, cruising through vi has become even easier.
<p>
For XEmacs programming, the control key is located in the
``right'' place, directly left of the ``A'' key. This
makes it easy to use without any odd movements or taking your fingers away
from the home row. (Yes, I learned to type before I learned to program.)
<p>
Both of these key locations, escape and control, have allowed me to
quickly negotiate commands without having to reposition my fingers. This
has the benefit of reducing the frustration of trying to return to the home keys
after each command--my fingers never wind up in odd locations as they
did on a typical PC keyboard.
<p>
<h3>Disgruntled Gamer</h3>
<p>
As a part-time game player (Linux Quake), I'm accustomed to using the
keyboard for all player movements, such as turns and running. With this
keyboard, I'd have to hold the function key down constantly (to select the arrow
keys) or figure out how to use the mouse. Otherwise, keeping the function key
depressed (two keys away from the arrow keys) and trying to fumble around with
the arrows might increase the probability of developing carpal tunnel syndrome.
<p>
After a few games of Quake, I think I'll be comfortable with
the bizarre fingering required. Also, using the keyboard to program in XEmacs
helped in the adjustment needed to get into the gaming world.
<p>
<h3>Technical Support and On-line Documentation</h3>
<p>
Documentation is also available on-line. While I haven't had to use their
tech support e-mail, it is readily available--my contact at
PFU America was quick to reply to any e-mail I sent. Furthermore, all of
the information needed to install and hook up the keyboard can
be found on-line. All of the information in the manual is included in their
on-line documentation.
<p>
<h3>In Closing</h3>
<p>
Overall, I would be hard-pressed to sum up this review with anything but
a positive remark. With the price tag recently dropping by $40, the keyboard is
more affordable. I'm sure other hackers will be quite happy
to own it.
<p>
For someone who hasn't experienced the keyboard, it's hard to
believe everything reported about the Happy Hacking Keyboard by PFU America. In fact, I was skeptical
about the remarks I had heard before I became a Happy Hacking Keyboard user. Now, one
month after laying my fingers on it, I can't imagine using any other keyboard.
I wonder if PFU America makes a Happy Hacking tote bag.
