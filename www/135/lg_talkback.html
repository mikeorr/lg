<p>
HI,
</p>

<p>
Read the article at <a href="../128/ramanathan.html">http://linuxgazette.net/128/ramanathan.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
Well i have couple of queries
</p>

<p>
1&gt; I have setup a svn server and when i use http schema
 <a href="http://www.myrepos.com/svn">http://www.myrepos.com/svn</a>
Post validation i get the output like
<pre>
Collection of repositories
/
</pre>
Once i click on the / i am redirected to the default index.html
page.Couldyou please let me know what could be wrong? Why isn't the
repository be displayed.The httpd.conf file looks something like this
<pre>
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNListParentPath on
  SVNParentPath /usr/local/svn/repos/
  # how to authenticate a user
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth-file
  # our access control policy
  #AuthzSVNAccessFile /usr/local/svn/repos/conf/svnaccessfile
  # only authenticated users may access the repository
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
with SVNParentPath if i use svnaccessfile i get error like "u don't have
permission to access /svn/".If i comment the same then it comes to first
scenario but doesn't give the repository.Could you please help in this?
<pre>
Repository Path :- /usr/local/svn/repos/
</pre>
under the repository i have a project diectory called projectA.
</p>

<p>
Please help in this regard as i have been struggling for quite sometime and
most of the docs seem to confuse.
</p>

<p>
regards

Perhaps I should wait for the next bit but I think the problem may be in the 
published section. In particular the unpacking phase.
</p>

<p>
I can't unpack the file . I tried to attach it but not allowed  , it should 
have 50 files or so  on it and does ,I can see them during the unpacking 
phase but I can't extract them at least not to  the same computer. What have 
I done wrong please? I'm playing on the one computer only atm so I used 
the --yes option.
</p>

<p>
Attached the file ScriptUSB.pl but my provider won't send it unless I name 
it ".text" Took out the first line too just in case

<p>
Your end won't
accept my archived file because it was too big . So all in all a
complete stuff around and I have now sent three versions of this bloody
email. I doubt I will bother again

<p>
The fuse page <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems">http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems</a> that
lists all known fuse projects was changed a few weeks ago.
</p>

<p>
All network filesytstems are are now listed in a separate page. Follow the
link NetworkFileSystems at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
That's just a link so that should be obvious but, frankly, it took me a
while to figure out why some well known projects such as sshfs or fusesmb
were not listed anymore in that page. Even now that I know I still dont
find it obvious.
</p>

<p>
Some very cool projects I would like to mention are
</p>

<pre>
  - sshfs to mount a remote ssh account. I use it a lot to manage my web site:
    sshfs user@hostname: localdir
 
  - encfs to create an encrypted directory.

Maybe you have heard about this before, but in case you haven't... Puppy 
Linux is desiged to support booting from a USB flash drive, as well as 
Live-CD/DVD (with multi-session data saves, even to CD-R!) and more 
traditional types of installations.  If you are not familiar with Puppy 
LInux, you should take a look!  A few links:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.puppyos.com/">http://www.puppyos.com/</a>
  <a href="http://www.puppylinux.org/user/viewpage.php?page_id=1">http://www.puppylinux.org/user/viewpage.php?page_id=1</a>
  <a href="http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/">http://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/</a>
</p>

<p>
Puppy LInux would make a good base for experimenting with the 
highly-mobile form factors mentioned in the article.  To really get to 
the point of roll-up screens and cell-phone-sized CPU units, we might be 
better with a non-x86 platform (closer to a PDA CPU and chipset).  Linux 
might be still a good software base, but it will not be a standard PC 
platform at that point, making it easier to have a "clean" hardware and 
software architecture.  Just my thoughts.  I'd like to see to see the 
ultra-portable kit described in th article in reality!

I think fuse is something like KDE's kio system.
</p>

<p>
For example, type ftp://ftp.iitm.ac.in in Konqueror's location bar,then 
Konqueror will open that ftp site as a filesystem, just like curlftpfs did.
