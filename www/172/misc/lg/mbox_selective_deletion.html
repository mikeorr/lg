Hey gang,
</p>

<p>
Here's the deal: I'm trying to delete a message from an mbox with Bash. I have
the message number that I got by filtering with `frm` (the message is
identified by a header that holds a unique SHA crypt). You've problem guessed
by now, but mailutils is fair game.
</p>

<p>
I don't want to convert from mbox to maildir in /tmp on each run, because it's
reasonable that the script would be run every minute. Also, I don't want to put
users through that pain with a large mbox.
</p>

<p>
Also, I really don't want to write a "delete by message number" program in C
using the libmailutils program, but I will resort to it if needed.
</p>

<p>
I saw <a href='http://www.argon.org/~roderick/mbox-purge.html'>http://www.argon.org/~roderick/mbox-purge.html</a>, but would like to have
"common" packages as dependencies only.
</p>

<p>
Is there some arg that I missed in `mail`? Should I just try and roll
mbox-purge in? All ideas, tricks and release management included, are welcome.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
</p>

You might also be able to use xmh here as well, I have a book on this

<p>
'formail -s procmail' would be the classic tools for the job, but it
sounds like you need something a bit more flexible than procmail (i.e.,
something that will take an argument and then reject a given message
based on that.) Like so (we'll call this script 'reject'):
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash

[ -z "$1" ] &amp;&amp; { printf "Usage: ${0##*/} &lt;arg_to_reject&gt;\n"; exit; }
 
tmp=`tempfile`||exit
 
# This will read from STDIN
cat&gt;$tmp
 
grep -q "$1" $tmp || cat $tmp
rm $tmp
</pre>

<p>
All we need to do then is -
</p>

<p>
formail -s ./reject '^From: *Joe Smith' &lt; mbox &gt; mbox.out
</p>

<p>
This should produce an 'mbox.out' that contains all the messages in
'mbox' except those from Joe Smith.

I do have to note, though, that this isn't great for large mailboxes
with lots of messages; it's not the fastest thing in the world. As a
baseline, it takes about 3 seconds to process a 10MB mailbox that has 36
messages in it, but it takes 22 seconds to process one of the same size
but with ~600 messages in it. I suppose you could speed it up by
sticking the tempfile into memory (assuming you have enough memory), but
you're still spawning <em>some</em> interpreter or parser ~600 times, and that
ain't cheap.
</p>

<p>
If there was no requirement to do it with Bash (or, more precisely,
mailutils), I would - of course - do it all in Perl, which is famous for
its text-processing capabilities. Something like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>

<p>
Less than 2.1 seconds for a 10MB, ~600 message box.

<p>
I was trying to keep my program all in one language, but the Bash solution you
provided simply choked and died with large mbox's (ex., currently mine is 365
megs). So, with that and needing to match more than one header pair, I give you
this: <a href='http://github.com/ravidgemole/mailp/blob/master/deleteMessage.plx'>http://github.com/ravidgemole/mailp/blob/master/deleteMessage.plx</a>
</p>

<p>
[Don't worry, check the THANKS file to see that you're not forgotten.] 
</p>

<p>
The tests showed much better results. FYI, this test was with a non-sane e-mail
so I could make sure the program was doing AND matching, not OR.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
sbisbee@orbital:~/src/mailp$ time ./deleteMessage.plx ./mbox to ".*sbisbee@computervip\.c0om.*" x-mailp ad9d8e35e69f9547a9b3c4a8fb06ad0edbe56d9b &gt; test
 
real    0m23.135s
user    0m20.065s
sys     0m2.760s
</pre>

<p>
Now my main program (a Bash script, though I may convert to Perl for
homogeneousness) can remove messages from the mbox that have a specific To
address and a certain header key/value pair.
</p>

<p>
Some more things I want to add:
</p>

<p>
 - An arg to run through the mbox file in reverse, with the theory that people
   will often want to deal with recent e-mails at the end of the file instead
   of old ones. Ex., my program would run this command _a lot_ faster if it
   could combine this arg with the next one...
</p>

<p>
 - An arg to stop running through the mbox file when one match is found.
   Haven't played with Mail::MboxParser enough yet to know whether I can tell
   it to just dump the rest of the file's contents.

But it makes processing a lot slower - and it's an asymptotic curve. In
my experience/best judgement, whenever you expose a static data source
to multiple users, anything over a meg or so in size is a disaster
waiting to happen. At that point, either a database or some sort of a
pointer-based index scheme is a requirement.

Sam, y'know how I said "anything over a couple of meg"? I think 365MB
sorta, um, qualifies. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

If you just wanted to select and return various emails, there's a bunch
of stuff that allows you to do that (e.g., mairix and hyperestraier are
stunningly good at what they do.) However, you actually want to delete
stuff... in my mind, that pretty much defines it as either a database or
a customized caching and indexing solution.

Sure. Do note that Mail::MboxParser allows you to create an index file:
take a look at the 'make_index' option in the docs.

That's certainly a machine with lots more horsepower than my little

If you invert your index, this would be automatic.

Wouldn't be a problem. The nuclear-powered mechanical dwarves beneath
the surface of this module will do the right thing if you only ask them.

Thanks for re-stating the first half of my point, but with fancier jargon. :-P

<p>
Well, I don't know about the 1 meg part, but I generally agree with you. I
really don't want to go the index/database route with this program - though it
does give me an idea for another project. I'll most likely recommend that
people have fetchmail drop their mailp mail into a stand alone mbox file, set
up a different e-mail, etc. if they're hitting performance issues.
</p>

<p>
Indexes and databases are great, but they'll quickly increase the complexity of
my program. Also, adding dependencies will make it harder to port this
software; yes, things like [database/caching/index software of choice] is often
available, but I have dealt with a lot of hosting environments where it's a
political process to get anything new added. Because this is monitoring
software, I'm trying to cut down on the number of dependencies so that it can
be easily integrated into any environment, whether it's your home desktop or a
HIPAA compliant system. This was another reason I wanted to stay away from Perl
at the beginning, as the shell is, uh, something of a requirement (side note,
will probably de-Bashism mailp once it's done to make it Bourne compliant).
</p>

<p>
Also, I'm trying to keep this thing all Unix philosophy like.
</p>

<p>
Yup. 4 gigs RAM and Intel Core 2 Quad 2.4 GHz. Also has mirrored RAID (actual
card, not on board) with hard drives with big caches, so the disk I/O portion
of that command is "okay" (numbers weren't very different when I just dumped to
terminal instead of redirecting).
</p>

<p>
My work tends to be process intensive, so I had to go "all in" last winter.
Side benefit, it plays games like a pro. ;-)
</p>

  2. Stop processing when...
  2a. Found the e-mail and delete it.
  2b. Found an e-mail with a time stamp that's older than when we sent the e-mail.
 
  3. Dump the rest of the e-mail into the mbox.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yeah, coding against "keep everything on one gigantic file" isn't very fun,
&gt; &gt; &gt; though it makes administration a lot easier.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; But it makes processing a lot slower - and it's an asymptotic curve.

Aw, hell, Sam - I figgered after you went to thet there fancy Bawston
collitch, you fergot how to talk lahk folks, so I copied some stuff

some uh thet fancy talk in it, so I reckoned hit would suit ya.

(By the way, that there 'puter you sent us shore was complicated. I took
hit all apart and couldn't find neether a carbureter nor a pull-cord
nowheres, so I give up on it. Dern it, guess I'll hev to mow the hay by

That's exactly why I mentioned indexing as another option: it requires

That statement assumes a high number of emails, which is fine but should be
noted. Ex., an mbox with one email is going to be more quickly dealt with by
the iterative method I've been using that reading it into the db, building the
index, and then building and running the deletion query.

I'm bouncing back and forth on how to handle the large mbox file user (like
myself): build in support for a database or two, or tell them to simply filter
their mailp emails into a different mbox file. I'll most likely punt on the
issue, fighting it with the README for now, as I keep coming back to Rob Pike's
third rule: "Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small.
Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going
to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.)"

I played around with this to no avail. It took Mail::MboxParser longer to build
the index than it did for the iterative method to just run like normal (running
against 371M mbox).

<p>
Sam, that's a red herring. Notice how I said "deletion program", not
"parsing program"? In addition, it's ridiculous to talk about SQL
injection when you're giving a <strong>deletion</strong> tool to your users. Why would
they care about SQL injection when they can just delete the entire box
via the normal, defined use of your program?

You don't build an index with a DB, Sam - you just load up the data -
and you don't get to count "building and running the deletion query"
against this approach, since you have to do those things with <strong>any</strong>
approach.

Half a dozen lines of shell scripting is a fancy algorithm? Wow.  You
should look at some bio-informatics or mathematical puzzle algorithms,
just to clear your mind. Oh, and to address your question about loading
the emails into a DB: that's no more difficult than putting them into
your mailbox in the first place. Tell procmail to pipe the appropriate
emails to a script; have the script split the email into all the headers
and the body ('formail' will do that quite handily), and feed them to
the DB as an INSERT statement. The solution is trivial, and is left up
to the individual student. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
