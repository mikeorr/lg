<P> I've created a linux directory site called frozenlinux at

submissions. I believe all my cgi scripts and things like that work, and I have
(I think) most of the categories that it'll need defined already...  I just
need people to submit sites to it. I have added some sites, but it's a very
time consuming task and I can't really make a directory myself.  I'd appreciate
if you'd put a mention of it in your magazine or on your website, that would
really help to get the ball rolling.

<P> New Age Entertainment Inc.--Toronto, Dec. 24th, 1999-- 
The time has come that the world recognizes the value of Linux over
Microsoft Operating Systems. We are creating a tightly integrated integrated
Operating System / Office Application Suite that will replace MicroSoft as
THE mainstream software company.  The next step is to provide a viable
alternative to front and back-office programs and applications for the
desktop. Integration is the key word here.
To New Age, integration means input from the Linux Community. Already, the
business community has demonstrated considerable in this project. We value
your input, opinions, and development skills. They are necessary in order to
make this truley a Linux project rather than just a business deal. Voice
your opinion, you will be heard!

<P> "The high-performance computing community is at a critical juncture 
in its history. The community will either continue down its familiar

rolles out the 1.99 release, in new release of 
<A HREF=http://www.linuxcad.com>LinuxCAD</A>
the following important features were added:

<P>   - XREFs or external references , a special kind of a block
that may be located elsewhere in the filesystem as opposite 
to normal block that must be present in the drawing itself ;

<P>   - AutoLisp compatible tool has been added ;

<P>   - major improvements have been done in LinuxCAD ADS where
  more then 200 new functions were exposed for application 
  developers ;

<P>   - LinuxCAD ADS already have been used to implement custom
graphics and reporting (OLAP) tools on several Fortune 500 
companies.      

<P>   - Support for DWG format was significantly improved ;

<P>   - previously optional DXF import module was added in standard
basic version of LinuxCAD.
  
<P>   Currently LinuCAD is one of the major Linux Application tools,
it is used by thousands people worldwide.

<P>   PS.  To your special consideration: it does not make sense to wait
for release of real AutoCAD for Linux from Autodesk Inc. Autodesk Inc. has a
strategic alliance with Microsoft and they will not do it , period. 
  The best and the fastest way to make the Autodesk to reconsider 
their behaviour is to buy more copies of LinuxCAD !!!
