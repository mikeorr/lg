     <h3><a name="Intro">1. Introduction</a></h3>
<p>The main purpose of this document is to describe and explain steps you need 
  to perform to setup a <strong>Linux authentication via Novell e-Directory.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Novell e-Directory</strong> is a Novell implementation of an access 
  protocol to X.500-based directory services. Another implementation of this protocol 
  is known as <strong>LDAP, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</strong>. LDAP 
  is defined in <em>RFC2251 &quot;The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (v3)&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>A directory is similar to a database, but tends to contain more descriptive, 
  attribute-based information. The information in a directory is generally read 
  much more often than it is written. Directories are tuned to give quick-response 
  to high-volume lookup or search operations. They may have the ability to replicate 
  information widely in order to increase availability and reliability, while 
  reducing response time. When directory information is replicated, temporary 
  inconsistencies between the replicas may be OK, as long as they get in sync 
  eventually.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Requirements"></a>2. System Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Novell e-Directory</strong> 8.6 or higher.</li>
  <li><strong>Linux</strong> with <strong>PAM</strong> system (All samples are 
    provided for RedHat Linux 7.3)</li>
  <li><strong>nss_ldap</strong> library</li>
  <li><strong>pam_ldap</strong> module</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="QuickStart">3. Quick-Start Guide</a></h3>
<p>The following is a quick start guide to setup Linux authentication and account 
  information fetching via Novell e-Directory.</p>
<p>It is meant to walk you through the basic steps needed to setup authentication 
  procedure. It should be used in conjunction with the other chapters of this 
  document, manual pages, and other materials provided with the default distribution.</p>
<p>If you intend to work with authentication via Novell e-Directory seriously, 
  you should review this entire document before attempting to setup the software.</p>
<p>To setup <strong>Novell e-Directory authentication</strong> you have to perform 
  following steps:</p>

<li type="disc">Properly configure <strong>ldap.conf</strong> file </li>
<li type="disc">Add some changes to <strong>PAM system</strong> configuration</li>
<li type="disc">Setup <strong>name service switch</strong></li>
<li type="disc">Get Novel Netware server <strong>SSL Certificate</strong></li>
<li type="disc"><strong>Novell e-Directory</strong> configuration</li>
<blockquote> 
  <h4> <a name="3a">/etc/ldap.conf configuration file</a> </h4>
  <p>First of all you have to setup <strong>ldap.conf</strong> file, which is 
    usually situated in <strong>/etc</strong> directory. Let's take a look on 
    it:</p>
  <p><code> # your Novell e-Directory server IP address <br>
    server 192.168.0.1 <br>
    # base context <br>
    base ou=london,o=acme <br>
    # special user, which is used only for NDS tree browsing <br>
    # and has appropriate rights <br>
    binddn cn=ndsbrowser,ou=london,o=acme <br>
    # users password <br>
    bindpw ndspass <br>
    # enable ssl encryption <br>
    ssl yes <br>
    # password mode NDS pam_password nds <br>
    # special attribute mapping <br>
    nss_map_attribute userPassword authPassword <br>
    # NDS search scope <br>
    scope sub </code></p>
  <h4><a name="3b"></a>b. PAM system configuration</h4>
  <p>Now we have to change configuration for <strong>PAM</strong> (<em>pluggable 
    authentication modules</em>) system. For that in RedHat 7.3 we have to change 
    file <strong>/etc/pam.d/system-auth</strong>. Here it goes:</p>
  <p><code>#%PAM-1.0 <br>
    auth required /lib/security/pam_env.so <br>
    auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_unix.so likeauth nullok <br>
    auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_ldap.so try_first_pass <br>
    auth required /lib/security/pam_deny.so <br>
    <br>
    </code><code> account sufficient /lib/security/pam_unix.so <br>
    account [default=bad success=ok user_unknown=ignore service_err=ignore system_err=ignore] 
    /lib/security/pam_ldap.so <br>
    <br>
    password required /lib/security/pam_cracklib.so retry=3 type= <br>
    password sufficient /lib/security/pam_unix.so nullok use_authtok md5 shadow 
    <br>
    password sufficient /lib/security/pam_ldap.so use_authtok <br>
    password required /lib/security/pam_deny.so <br>
    <br>
    session required /lib/security/pam_limits.so <br>
    session required /lib/security/pam_unix.so <br>
    session required /lib/security/pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel/ umask=0077 
    <br>
    session optional /lib/security/pam_ldap.so </code></p>
  <p>So, we've setup password authentication. Let's go to the next section.</p>
  <h4><a name="3c"></a>c. Name service switch configuration</h4>
  <p>Now we've to setup linux account data fetching from Novell e-Directory. For 
    that we have to edit file <strong>/etc/nsswitch.conf</strong>. Simply check 
    if the lines, which starts from &quot;passwd:&quot;, &quot;shadow:&quot; and 
    &quot;group:&quot; contains word &quot;ldap&quot;. If not -- you've to add 
    it. On my PC it looks like:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><code># Look for passwd in local files then in ldap <br>
    passwd: files ldap <br>
    # Look for shadow in local files then in ldap <br>
    shadow: files ldap <br>
    # Look for group in local files then in ldap <br>
    group: files ldap </code></p>
  <h4><a name="3d"></a>d. SSL security configuration</h4>
  <p>Last step we have to perform on Linux box is to setup secure connection to 
    the Novell server. To do it download file <strong>RootCert.der</strong> from 
    <strong>SYS</strong>: volume of the Novell server and save it into cert directory 
    <strong>/usr/share/ssl/certs</strong>. Convert the Novell root certificate 
    using the command: </p>
  <code>openssl x509 -in /usr/share/ssl/certs/RootCert.der -inform DER -out \ 
  <br>
  /usr/share/ssl/certs/RootCert.pem -outform PEM</code> 
  <p>In the <strong>openssl.cnf</strong> (on RedHat 7.3 in <strong>/usr/share/ssl</strong> 
    directory) file set the &quot;<em>value certificate</em>&quot; to point to 
    the <strong>RootCert.pem</strong> (certificate being the CA certificate) and 
    &quot;<em>my private key</em>&quot; to be the same certificate.</p>
  <p>Okay, we've done all things on Linux. Now it's time to switch to Novell server. 
    There are some things that should be done. All things we're going to do can 
    be done via ConsoleOne tool.</p>
  <h4><a name="3e"></a>e. Novell side configuration</h4>
  <p> First of all we've to make some changes into NDS &lt;&#8211;&gt; LDAP mapping 
    scheme. To do that, open your base context and find &quot;LDAP Group&quot; 
    item. Open properties of this object. In the &quot;General&quot; tab check 
    &quot;Allow Clear Text Passwords&quot; box (it&#8217;s for testing purposes). 
  </p>
  <p>Now open &quot;Attribute Map&quot; tab. Click &quot;Add&quot; button and 
    add following mappings:</p>
  <table width="60%" border="0">
    <tr bgcolor="#999999"> 
      <td>LDAP Attribute</td>
      <td>NDS Attribute</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>loginShell</td>
      <td>loginShell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>uidNumber</td>
      <td>uidNumber</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>gidNumber</td>
      <td>gidNumber</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Close &quot;LDAP Group&quot; properties dialog.</p>
  <p>Second step is to setup user account properly. For that right-click on appropriate 
    user and select properties. Open &quot;UNIX Profile&quot; tab and enter the 
    account data:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><img src="misc/pesin/image001.png" alt="User properties dialog" width="475" height="364"></p>
  <p>Here is a short legend: </p>
  <li>uid (User ID) - should be unique for all users</li>
  <li>gid (Group ID) - group number</li>
  <li>login shell - user&#8217;s login shell</li>
  <li>comment - any comment, full name is an example</li>
  <li>home directory - user&#8217;s home directory.&nbsp;</p> </li>

<h3><a name="Advanced"></a>4. Advanced Guide</h3>
<p>In this part of the document we will go deeply into background of the Linux 
  authentication via Novell e-Directory process. It mainly consists of two logical 
  parts: password authentication and account data fetching. Understanding of that 
  processes will allow you to setup authentication on other not described linux 
  distributions. </p>
<p>Password authentication via ldap is implemented with <strong>pam_ldap</strong> 
  module. It has to be installed if you wish to organize password authentication 
  via ldap. For RedHat Linux 7.3 is available <strong>nss_ldap</strong> RPM package 
  within distribution. It contains all tools, modules and libraries needed as 
  for password authentication, so for linux account data fetching.</p>
<p>Software needed for LDAP authentication is public domain software maintained 
  by PADL Software Company in Melbourne, Australia. Company runs three Internet 
  mailing lists that allow users of their software to support each other: nssldap@padl.com, 
  pamldap@padl.com, and ldap-nis@padl.com. If you wish to subscribe to any of 
  these mailing lists, send an e-mail to majordomo@padl .com with &quot;subscribe 
  listname&quot; in the message body.<br>

<blockquote> 
  <h4><a name="4a"></a>a. PAM_LDAP and NSS_LDAP.</h4>
  <p> The ldap.conf file is used to configure LDAP-specific information for the 
    <strong>pam_ldap</strong> modules and <strong>libnss_ldap</strong> library. 
    The following list represents minimum required records in this file to provide 
    SSL-encrypted communication with Novell e-Directory server:</p>
  <p> <strong>host</strong> &lt;ip address or hostname of eDirectory server&gt;</p>
  <p><strong>base</strong> &lt;container at which to begin searching for information 
    in eDirectory&gt;</p>
  <p><strong>scope sub</strong> - specifies a subtree search. </p>
  <p><strong>ssl on</strong> - turn on SSL transport encryption </p>
  <p>We need to authenticate as a specific user when retrieving user information 
    because of access to some user information not available in the context of 
    anonymous bind. For that the following parameters must be set :</p>
  <p><strong>binddn</strong> &lt;full LDAP DN of user object to authenticate as&gt;</p>
  <p><strong>bindpw</strong> &lt;password of the above user&gt;</p>
  <p>The following listing shows the example of <strong>ldap.conf</strong> file 
    :</p>
  <p><code>server 192.168.0.1 <br>
    base ou=london,o=acme <br>
    binddn cn=ndsbrowser,ou=london,o=acme <br>
    bindpw ndspass <br>
    ssl yes <br>
    pam_password nds <br>
    nss_map_attribute userPassword authPassword <br>
    scope sub </code></p>
  <h4>b. PAM System.
  </h4>
  <p>Editing a specific file configures PAM. In RedHat Linux 7.3 you will need 
    to edit file called <strong>system-auth</strong> situated in the <strong>/etc/pam.d</strong> 
    directory. An entry in this file defines authentication systems (traditional 
    UNIX authentication, LDAP, smart cards, and so on) which will be used for 
    authentication. Modules can be stacked. Depending on how the modules are stacked 
    and configured, multiple services may be used.</p>
  <p>Each entry in the configuration file has three required fields and an optional 
    field.</p>
  <p>Linux-PAM separates the tasks of authentication into four independent management 
    groups: account management; authentication management; password management; 
    and session management.</p>
  <p>Simply put, these groups take care of different aspects of a typical user's 
    request for a restricted service:</p>
  <p><strong>account</strong> - provide account verification types of service: 
    has the user's password expired?; is this user permitted access to the requested 
    service?</p>
  <p><strong>auth</strong>entication - establish the user is who they claim to 
    be. Typically this is via some challenge-response request that the user must 
    satisfy: if you are who you claim to be please enter your password. Not all 
    authentications are of this type, there exist hardware based authentication 
    schemes (such as the use of smart-cards and biometric devices), with suitable 
    modules, these may be substituted seamlessly for more standard approaches 
    to authentication - such is the flexibility of Linux-PAM.</p>
  <p><strong>password</strong> - this group's responsibility is the task of updating 
    authentication mechanisms. Typically, such services are strongly coupled to 
    those of the auth group. Some authentication mechanisms lend themselves well 
    to being updated with such a function. Standard UN*X password-based access 
    is the obvious example: please enter a replacement password.</p>
  <p><strong>session</strong> - this group of tasks cover things that should be 
    done prior to a service being given and after it is withdrawn. Such tasks 
    include the maintenance of audit trails and the mounting of the user's home 
    directory. The session management group is important as it provides both an 
    opening and closing hook for modules to affect the services available to a 
    user.</p>
  <p>When a Linux-PAM aware privilege granting application is started, it activates 
    its attachment to the PAM-API. This activation performs a number of tasks, 
    the most important being the reading of the configuration file(s): /etc/pam.conf. 
    Alternatively, this may be the contents of the /etc/pam.d/ directory.</p>
  <p>These files list the PAMs that will do the authentication tasks required 
    by this service, and the appropriate behavior of the PAM-API in the event 
    that individual PAMs fail.</p>
  <p>The syntax of the /etc/pam.conf configuration file is as follows. The file 
    is made up of a list of rules, each rule is typically placed on a single line, 
    but may be extended with an escaped end of line: `\&lt;LF&gt;'. Comments are 
    preceded with `#' marks and extend to the next end of line.</p>
  <p>The format of each rule is a space separated collection of tokens, the first 
    three being case-insensitive:</p>
  <p align="center"><u>service type control module-path module-arguments</u></p>
  <p>The syntax of files contained in the /etc/pam.d/ directory, are identical 
    except for the absence of any service field. In this case, the service is 
    the name of the file in the /etc/pam.d/ directory. This filename must be in 
    lower case.</p>
  <p>An important feature of Linux-PAM, is that a number of rules may be stacked 
    to combine the services of a number of PAMs for a given authentication task.</p>
  <p>The service is typically the familiar name of the corresponding application: 
    login and su are good examples. The service-name, other, is reserved for giving 
    default rules. Only lines that mention the current service (or in the absence 
    of such, the other entries) will be associated with the given service-application.</p>
  <p>The type is the management group that the rule corresponds to. It is used 
    to specify which of the management groups the subsequent module is to be associated 
    with. Valid entries are: account; auth; password; and session. The meaning 
    of each of these tokens was explained above.</p>
  <p>The third field, control, indicates the behavior of the PAM-API should the 
    module fail to succeed in its authentication task. There are two types of 
    syntax for this control field: the simple one has a single simple keyword; 
    the more complicated one involves a square-bracketed selection of value=action 
    pairs.</p>
  <p>For the simple (historical) syntax valid control values are: requisite - 
    failure of such a PAM results in the immediate termination of the authentication 
    process; required - failure of such a PAM will ultimately lead to the PAM-API 
    returning failure but only after the remaining stacked modules (for this service 
    and type) have been invoked; sufficient - success of such a module is enough 
    to satisfy the authentication requirements of the stack of modules (if a prior 
    required module has failed the success of this one is ignored); optional - 
    the success or failure of this module is only important if it is the only 
    module in the stack associated with this service+type.</p>
  <p>For the more complicated syntax valid control values have the following form:</p>
  <p align="center">[value1=action1value2=action2...]</p>
  <p>Where valueN corresponds to the return code from the function invoked in 
    the module for which the line is defined. The full list of PAM errors is available 
    in /usr/include/security/_pam_types.h . For details refer to your local system 
    documentation.</p>
  <p>module-path - this is either the full filename of the PAM to be used by the 
    application (it begins with a '/'), or a relative pathname from the default 
    module location: /lib/security/.</p>
  <p>module-arguments - these are a space separated list of tokens that can be 
    used to modify the specific behavior of the given PAM. Such argu ments will 
    be documented for each individual module.</p>
  <p>The following listing shows a sample pam.conf file set up NDS authentication 
    for all services in Red Hat Linux 7.3 . File &quot;system-auth&quot; in this 
    distribution is included in each service module. Shown example provides authentications 
    via LDAP, as well as traditional UNIX authentication if LDAP authentication 
    fails. The file is also set up to include account authorization and password</p>
  <p>The file is also set up to include account authorization and password management 
    via LDAP and then files if the LDAP module fails.</p>

  <h4><a name="4c"></a>c. Name Switch Service. </h4>
  The <strong>nsswitch.conf</strong> file, also located in the <strong>/etc</strong> 
  directory, is used to configure which system will be used for shadow information 
  (the shadow file) and password information (for authentication purposes). Each 
  entry in the file consists of the name of the function and then a list of the 
  modules to be referenced.</h4> 
  <p>The sample <strong>nsswitch.conf</strong> file listed below:</p>
  <p><code>passwd: files ldap <br>
    shadow: files ldap <br>
    group: files ldap</code> </p>
  <h4><a name="4d" id="4d"></a>d. SSL Security. </h4>
  <p>In order to setup an SSL security, your Linux system must have a copy of 
    the LDAP server's Trusted Root certificate. So you have to download file <strong>RootCert.der</strong> 
    from <strong>SYS</strong>: volume of your Novell server to certs directory 
    <strong>/usr/share/ssl/certs</strong>. Then you will need to convert the Novell 
    root certificate using the command:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><code>openssl x509 -in /usr/share/ssl/certs/RootCert.der -inform DER -out 
    \ <br>
    /usr/share/ssl/certs/RootCert.pem -outform PEM</code> </p>
  <p>After converting set the <em>value certificate</em> to point to the <strong>RootCert.pem</strong> 
    (certificate being the CA certificate) in the <strong>openssl.cnf</strong> 
    (on RedHat Linux 7.3 system in<strong> /usr/share/ssl</strong>). Also set 
    <em>my private key</em> to be the same certificate. </p>
  <h4><a name="4e"></a>e. Novell e-Directory configuration</h4>
  <p>Now last steps of our battle for authentication are to setup Novell e-Directory 
    server. We have to add some attributes in NDS &lt;&#8211;&gt; LDAP mapping 
    scheme. For that you have to open in <strong>ConsoleOne</strong> your base 
    context, find &quot;LDAP Group&quot; item, right-clicks with mouse and select 
    &quot;Properties...&quot;. </p>
  <p>Now open &quot;Attribute Map&quot; tab. Find LDAP attributes with names &quot;uidNumber&quot;, 
    &quot;gidNumber&quot; and remove them, because there are broken mappings. 
    Instead create new mappings, for that click &quot;Add&quot; button and add 
    following mappings:</p>
  <table width="60%" border="0">
    <tr bgcolor="#999999"> 
      <td>LDAP Attribute</td>
      <td>NDS Attribute</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>loginShell</td>
      <td>loginShell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>uidNumber</td>
      <td>uidNumber</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>gidNumber</td>
      <td>gidNumber</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The very last you should input apropriate values in &quot;UNIX Profile&quot; 
    tab of each user. After that you can login linux box using your Novell credentials.<br>
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<h3><a name="Notes"></a>Notes</h3>
<p>I want to notice some things. First: I've used in my investigation Novell Netware 
  6 with e-Directory 8.6.0 as server and my RedHat 7.3 linux box as client. I 
  think that if you have some other version of software (newer) it should work 
  also, may be with some evident changes. So, as far as I know if you'll use e-Directory 
  8.6.2 or higher there is fixed problem with attribute mappings, so you can omit 
  appropriate section. Next: Unfortunelly we cannot setup fully secure authentication. 
  At lease I don't see a way to do it. It is concerned with special user which 
  has rights to browse NDS tree. File /etc/ldap.conf has to have +r for all users. 
  So, everyone who has access to the linux box can see that password. It's not 
  a really problem, while you gave rights only to read. But if you wish uses to 
  set/change passwords directly from the command line by itselfs, you should give 
  write rights to the special user. And here is a security hole. If you have a 
  clue how to avoid such situation -- mail me ;-) Last but not least: product
