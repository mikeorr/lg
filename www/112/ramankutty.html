<h1>Lexical Closures In C</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/ramankutty.html">Hiran Ramankutty</A></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Even if one is an experienced C programmer, a successful compilation of
your program in the first attempt certainly brings a sense of satisfaction
- whatever the logic behind it may be. "Hey, look! The GNU C Compiler has
accepted my program!" Take a look at the two code samples given below;
these are the two most common methods used by programmers to start coding a
program.

<pre class="code">
/* Sample 1. */
main()
{
}
</pre>

<p>

<pre class="code">
/* Sample 2. */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p> What is important while writing code is not the caution but the
approach - but at times, it is good to be skeptical about your C programs
to some extent. Not necessarily the logic, but the compiler you are using.

<p> The GNU C compiler provides several options for compiling a piece of
code; the more options you know, the more useful (<em>and</em> the more
confusing) it can be. I have aliased the GCC front-end <i>cc</i> like this:

<pre>
alias cc='gcc -Wall --pedantic-errors -Wstrict-prototypes'
</pre>

<p> The option <i>--pedantic-errors</i> helps me make my C programs adhere
to strict ANSI standards. GCC provides several extensions to the C
language, which are often either unnoticed or taken for granted due to
people's assumptions.  Here, I am going to give a brief description on one
such extension - <em>nesting of functions</em>.

<h3>Nesting of Functions and Closures</h3>
<p>
In the article <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/109/pramode.html">
Functional Programming with Python</a>, a function or a procedure is said to 
have some analogy to mathematical functions. If 'x' is a variable, then we have a 
function <i>f(x)</i> which does some operations on 'x' to give some value 'y'. Hence
we have:

<pre>
y = f(x)
</pre>

<p> The article also briefly describes <i>closures</i>. A <b>closure</b> is
a property associated with functions; when a function manipulates input and
produces output which holds the features and characteristics of the input,
then the function is said to possess (we should say 'satisfy' instead of
'possess') the <i>closure</i> property.

<p class="editorial">[ The above definition is, perhaps, less rigorous than
it could be; the standard definition of 'closure' in programming is a data
structure that contains both a function and a set of variables defining the
environment in which that function will be executed. -- Ben ]

<p> For example: consider the set of natural numbers 'N'. If x<sub>1</sub>
and x<sub>2</sub> are elements in the set N, and the function <i>f(x)</i>
is an addition (by binary operator `+') of x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub>
then addition has the closure property. Since sum of x<sub>1</sub> and
x<sub>2</sub> is again a natural number, we can say that the binary
operator '+' satisfies the closure property over the set of natural
numbers.

<p> Programming languages like Python and LISP support nesting of
functions. The above mentioned article explains with an example in Python.
An example for LISP is given below:

<pre class="code">
(defun foo (a) (defun bar (b) (+ b 1)) (+ a (bar 3)))

(setq a (foo 4))
(print a)
</pre>

<p> The function `bar' is nested and defined inside the definition of
`foo'. `bar' increments and returns the parameter that it takes, and `foo'
returns the sum of the return value of `bar' invoked with parameter 3
and the parameter that <em>it</em> takes. The variable `a' then is set to:

<pre>
3 + 1 + 4 = 8
</pre>

Hence, `a's value is printed as 8.

<p> This feature of function nesting is seen in the C language, as an
extension of GCC. Compiling the code below, with the <i>--pedantic-errors</i>
option enabled, will tell you that `ISO C forbids nested functions' - but
the code will compile cleanly without the option. Check out the code:

<pre class="code">
/* compile it with gcc --pedantic-errors <i>filename.c</i>*/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
	void foo()
	{
		printf("Hello World\n");
	}
	foo();
	return 0;
}
</pre>

Like local variables, nesting of functions will restrict the scope of the
function in which it is defined. For the above example, the binding of
function <b>foo</b> is not visible outside <b>main</b>.  The association
between identifiers and the place to store their values is called binding,
and scope refers to the part of the code where the binding of the
identifier is visible.

<p> Consider another example given below:

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
int main()
{
	int x;
	x = 10;
	{
		float x;
		x = 4.2
	}
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
In the above example, `x' has two bindings with respect to main. But if we remove the 
declaration <i>float x;</i>, then the binding will be same throughout. 


<h3>Scope</h3>

<p> Consider a binary search algorithm performed over a list of sorted
numbers. The code can be seen here, in <a
href="misc/ramankutty/listing1.c.txt">listing 1</a>.

<p> We can localize the array 'A' and the function 'binary_search' to
'main' if we don't have any other functions that need to access
'binary_search'; an example of this can be seen here, in 
<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing2.c.txt">listing2</a>.

<p> Now both 'A' and 'binary_search' are within the lexical scope of
'main'; hence, they are enclosed in the same scope. Let us define lexical
scoping a bit more: <em>Lexical Scope is the scope defined by the structure
of the code</em>.

<p> A language with lexical scoping can support function definitions within
another function. With this, the nested function gets access to the local
variables defined in the enclosing scope, and is itself visible during the
definition of the function being nested. That is:

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int x=10;
	void foo()
	{
		printf("hello\n");
	}
	int y=20;
	void bar()
	{
		printf("World\n");
	}
}
</pre>

Here, only the binding of 'x' is visible to 'foo', whereas 'bar' can "see"
the binding of 'x', 'foo', and 'y'.  We can now say that the textual
arrangement determines the lexical scope. Now, what if function 'foo' wants
to access function 'bar'? One of the options here would be to declare the
prototype of 'bar' before the definition of 'foo'. See the listing below:

<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int x=10;
	auto void bar(void);
	void foo()
	{
		printf("Hello\n");
		bar();
	}
	int y=20;
	void bar()
	{
		printf("World\n");
	}
	foo();
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p> Thomas M. Bruel's paper on lexical closures in C++ describes this as a
method to allow definition of mutually recursive functions at inner lexical
levels. Removing the 'auto' keyword will give a warning message. Try it!
(Refer to Section A.8.1 in <i>Storage Class Specifiers</i> by Kernighan
&amp; Ritchie for clarification and details.)

<p> The other type of scoping is <em>dynamic scoping</em>, in which the
active call stack handles name resolution during run time. To make it
more clear, see <a href="misc/ramankutty/listing3.c.txt">listing3</a>.

<p> 'x' in function 'foo' is a non-local reference, but it is local to
function 'bar'. The print statement in function 'main' is also a non-local
reference. If C was a dynamically scoped language (thank god that it
isn't), then reference to 'x' in function 'foo' would be bound to its
definition in the function 'bar'. However, C is a lexically scoped
language, and thus reference to 'x' in function 'foo' is bound to its
global definition. If we run this program, the output will be '1', not '0'.

<p> Now consider the following (<a
href="misc/ramankutty/listing4.c.txt">listing4</a>): we have the definition
of function 'add' within the scope of 'init_add'.  It is interesting to
note that 'add' refers to the parameter 'i', which is passed to the
function 'init_add'. For the function 'init_add', the binding of 'i' is
retained (even inside the function 'add') until 'init_add' returns. Now,
from the mathematical definition of 'closure', the function 'add' is said
to "close over" the parameter 'i'; therefore, 'add' satisfies the closure
property over 'i', and this is termed a <b>lexical closure</b>, in which
the lexical scoping is preserved (the reference for 'i' is not overridden
by any other local definition of 'i' - not that there are any).

<p> It should be clear by now that lexical scoping provides several
advantages. Functions can be made reentrant and hence the compiled machine
code will be reentrant. Local declarations can be stored in registers (in
an optimized way) which eliminates the symbol references upon compilation
(an optimization performed by the compiler.) We are no longer restricted to
declaring all variables global (a very bad practice leading to problems
like <em>variable suicide</em> among others) and passing parameters to
every function that is invoked. 


<h3>Why is there no nesting in ANSI, then?</h3>

I had mentioned earlier that nesting of functions is only seen in C as an
extension of GCC. While it is an advantage to some extent, we cannot
guarantee safe access to variables or functions within the lexical scope
just because the closure property has been satisfied. We must not forget
that even when the closure property is retained, in certain cases there
will be no reference to a variable within the current activation record in
the stack.

<h3>Conclusion and Further Reading</h3>

We have seen what the nesting of functions means and can do to some extent,
given the lexical scoping rules of C. If you are interested in further
reading, you should go through <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure And Interpretation of
Computer Programs</a> and the Wiki entry on <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LexicalClosure">Lexical Closure</a>. For the
article that inspired me, and which gives more details on the
implementation part, see <a
