Wow. Weird. I'm very familiar with the Perl Power Tools (essentially,
the GNU toolkit for Unix reimplemented in Perl) - in fact, I recommend
them to my students as a bunch of well-written code to study; I also
think it's a really good idea of the same kind as having a
statically-compiled shell. An entire Perl-based distro, though? Is there
a <EM>point</EM> to straining a Camel [1] through the eye of a needle? I mean,
cool that it can be done... but you end up with pureed camel, and who
wants that?  Messy.

Well, the way people seems to usually "learn" Perl (i.e., by looking at
somebody's horrible code, figuring "I can do that!", and proceeding to
do <EM>exactly</EM> that), I'd think it's more like "prayerfully, with a quiver
in the voice and tears running down the cheeks". People who learn it the
right way - i.e., by reading and following the documentation and learning
from <EM>good</EM> examples (e.g., PPT, NMS (<A HREF="http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net"
	>http://nms-cgi.sourceforge.net</A>),
etc.) - say it with a rising inflection, sorta singing the last part,
and usually follow it up with a whistle.

It's certainly one of the major reasons that I don't. My current machine
has plenty of disk, memory, and CPU for KDE to gratuitously throw in the
trash (oops - was that my 'out-loud' voice? Darn), but I refuse to put
up with the Micr0s0ft-style blinkenlights philosophy of the interface
("Fear not, small human creature; KDE has decided on everything you'll
want and need, and will provide it for you.").

What, to handle the configuration end? Nothing special there; IceWM,
e.g., has "icepref" that does much the same thing. I'm very much a fan
of "vi" as a configuration wizard, myself, but others may differ.

<EM>sigh</EM>. I agree. I liked it more when RH4 and the subsequent RH5 release
used Fvwm. They now use Gnome, which is arguably better IMO, than KDE.
Qt is horrible.

IceWM is small, fast, and lacks nothing in features that I want from a
WM. From Thomas' previous rantings 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

Kind of. But there are a <EM>lot</EM> of things Fvwm does that IceWM does not,
and while I am not going to outline the individual merits of each, you
cannot, for instance, in IceWM do event actions. And while I have used
IceWm, it just doesn't have..., well, it lacks <EM>something</EM>.

EPID. That's why I didn't say that KDE was evil and should be wiped off
the face, etc. - some people love it. And FVWM doesn't have a lot of
things that IceWM has (i.e., a decent taskbar; I could never stand that
huge <EM>thing</EM> they use that takes up so much real estate.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] 
Actually, Fvwm provides a taskbar (FvwmTaskBar) that takes up no more
space than any "normal" task bar, plus it can autohide.
You can also configure FvwmIconMan to act as a taskbar.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Apart from the inherent motif theme [1] that Fvwm takes on by default (
\o/ ), perhaps the other major attraction to it for me was the fact that
you can define events based on actions. AFAICT this is an idiom unique
to Fvwm, and no other WM/desktop environment (The module that provides
this is known as 'FvwmEvent').
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Perhaps another addition that you might appreciate Ben is the fact that
you can script commands to Fvwm, using the underlying $SHELL. There is
even a full set of perl-bindings[2] [3]. The power that this gives, to
allow complex things to be done simply, is quite amazing. Not only that
but Fvwm has its own internal widget set (FvwmScript) so that you can
define all kinds of things.

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

Perhaps I'm just not visualizing a scenario where this would be useful,
but I can't really see the advantage. What WM functions would you want
to script, and why?

<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] 
Lots of reasons that are situation dependent. One is to do things like
compute the distance between windows and slide a window in a given
direction to sit beside the window. Another is to take a snapshot of the
window on iconify, and set the icon to the picture of the window.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
For example, I have a function in Fvwm that displays the total number of
windows that I have open, on the title for my pager. By "open", I mean
those windows that are not iconified. You can see it here [4]. You
probably couldn't do that easily in anyother WM. Whether or not you
would <EM>want</EM> to, is another question entirely.

Yes. *That*' is the question I'm asking. If I really needed to, I'd
parse the output of "xwininfo -root -tree" and get the information, but
I don't see how it would benefit me in either case.

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But it really does just depend. I ask of nothing visual from my WM in
terms of eye candy. Ick. The only thing I permit myself is xteddy. After
all, a WM is just there to provide a means of being able to launch lots
of rxvts.

Oh, I don't know. That one example of FVWM eyecandy you showed before
was <EM>very</EM> impressive - and I like the idea of having a pretty desktop,
although to me that means a nice background plus some good looking
icons, not dancing rabbits that (again) waste my resources.

That's where I diagree. The environment you work in is what you make it.
And since Fvwm is free, the amount of things I can do with it, and the
extendability of it is immense. I joke not. There are over 1000 styles
in all to Fvwm. You can configure the minutest.

Yeah, you could theoretically make it out of gold and attach
it to a gadget that will feed the baby, wipe up the spills, and go to
the store to buy the products to replace the ones it used up... but it's
neither a spoon any longer, nor is it nearly as useful as a spoon is if
you move away from the home/baby/store metaphor.

Given that all of this is contained within Fvwm, the need to <EM>add on</EM>

Have you seen the IceWM theme packs lately? I wouldn't be surprised if
there were a thousand or more of them available. I generally take one,
hack it a little, and use it for six months or so, and I don't see
myself running out anytime soon.

My latest "standard" for how good such a thingy is has been:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>Can it emulate "ratpoison"?

<LI>Can it improve on "ratpoison"?

<LI>Can it do the above without bringing a low-end machine to
a screeching, grinding, *thrashing* halt?
</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It turns out that (in combination with GNU "screen") FVWM, ICEWM and even
(surprise) Gnome2+Metacity can do this. I haven't tried with KDE.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Some notes of explanation:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>in combination with "screen" what this really means is that you
should be able to maximize a window *without* title bars, menubars,
borders, handles and all that fluff. This is what you *really* need
when you are doing a deep hack or writing a paper.
<LI>means that you should be able to "switch" in and out of this
ratpoison mode with some key combination (don't touch that mouse
yet!). In the "real" GUI mode you should be able to use GIMP (which
is ratpoison disabled or vice versa) and other such programs that
require a mouse and/or graphical interface and non-mazimized
windows.

<LI>is reasonably clear---low on memory usage for (a) but could use more
memory in (b).

I got tired of spend^H^H^H^H^Hwasting my time configuring my

Answer:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>	Golem: (The first WM that I learnt to do this with) Alt-z
		z is for zoom.

	ICEWM: Alt-F11 (Yes, that's all!) F11 for "Fill the screen"

	FVWM:  For a window manager that can do it all this should
	        be easy; but I haven't quite figured it out.
		There *is* fvwm-shell and that has some settings that
		are 90% of the solution. (Unsurprisingly this is my

Lots of ways you can do this. I would define a function for it:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>DestroyFunc FvwmMaximiseWindow
AddToFunc   FvwmMaximiseWindow
+ I  ThisWindow WindowStyle !Handles, !Title, !Borders
+ I  Maximize 100 100
+ I  Key z  A  SCM NoFullScreen

DestroyFunc NoFullScreen
+ I ThisWindow WindowStle Handles, Titles, Borders
+ I ThisWindow UpdateStyles
+ I Maximize 100 100
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Kapil]
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>	Metacity+GNOME2: You can define the relevant key using the
	        window key bindings menu (there is no default binding).
		The relevant function is Toggle Maximize Window. Imagine
		the surprise on people's faces when they come and say
		"What! Are you running that pest-killer again? Give me a
		real desktop", you press a key and *wham* there is GNOME
		in all its glory (once it gets out of swap space that
		is...).
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Caveats:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Yes. I know that all this does not reduce memory usage! On the
other hand if you work/hack for long enough all that unused stuff
should go into swap/disk so it shouldn't bother you.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Alternate Answer:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
For those who <EM>really</EM> want to work 90% of the time the
alternative is to run ratpoison with one of the frames
containing an Xnest that runs the eye-candy window manager.
There is one problem with this solution---no DRI for the
eye-candy which means that GL screensavers and the like will not
produce good results.
