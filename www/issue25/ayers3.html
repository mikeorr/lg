<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p><blockquote><b>ephemeris</b> <i>n.,</i> <i>pl.</i> <b>ephemerides</b>
<b>1.</b> A table giving the coordinates of one or a number of celestial
bodies at a number of specific times during a given period.&nbsp;<b>2.</b> A
publication that presents a collection of such tables; an astronomical
almanac. 
</blockquote>

<p>The above definition came to mind when, some time ago, I happened upon a
Debian package called <em>xephem</em> while browsing the contents of a
distribution CD.  At the time I dismissed any thought of installing it; I
could visualize (falsely, as I later learned) a simple X application
displaying scrollable lists of sun, moon, and planet rising and setting times
for various latitudes.  This sort of information is easily available from
printed ephemerides and hardly justified installing a probably old package.

<p>A salient aspect of free software is that it's not advertised, and
word-of-mouth has its limitations.  News of an application with wide appeal,
such as an editor or file-manager, will eventually be spread via the internet,
but a program which occupies a specialized niche might not receive the
attention it deserves.

<p>Some time later I saw a brief description of xephem in a usenet posting
which was enough to spark my curiosity.  After trying it out, I was impressed, 
and thought the word should be spread.

<center><h3>Description and Features</h3></center>

<p>Xephem is a Motif-based X application which goes far beyond the name's
implication.  It's a multi-purpose astronomical program which can present
detailed, zoom-able star-charts as well as views of the earth, moon, planets
and the entire solar-system.  These views can be from any location on Earth,
at any time in the past or future.

<p>This application can be effective on several levels.  The casual star-gazer
can consult xephem just to see what planets and constellations are visible on
a certain night, and perhaps print out a star-chart.  As a teaching aid
xephem's graphical and animated displays could spark a student's interest.
The serious amateur astronomer can set up a link between a telescope and the
program, so that the sky-view displays whichever spot the telescope is also
seeing.

<p>This review will be more comprehensible if a screenshot is presented first.
The first window which appears when xephem is started is the control
window:<br>

<p><img alt="xephem controls" src="./gx/ayers/xeph_1.gif">

<p>In this window various parameters, such as location, date, and time, can be
set.  From the menubar the view windows can be summoned, as well as which of
the various astronomical databases (included in the distribution) should be
loaded into memory.  These databases are quite a useful resource to have
available.  They include the Messier and NGC databases of deep-sky objects,
along with databases of asteroids, comets, and satellites.  Updated versions of
the latter two are available on the xephem web-pages.

<p>Here is a screenshot of a skyview window:<br>

<p><img alt="Skyview window" src="./gx/ayers/skyview.gif">

<p>This window is much more than a simple star-chart of a certain date, time,
and location.  Right-mouse-button clicking on a star or other astronomical
object summons a small window showing various facts about the object.  Zooming 
in can also be done with the mouse, and a zoomed view can be panned using the
scroll-bars.  A variety of viewing options can be set from the menubar.  The
constellation names and outlines can be shown, and if any of the xephem
databases are loaded the objects in them will be visible, if desired.

<p>One view window which I find particulary interesting is the earth view.  A 
representation of the earth from an orbital viewpoint is shown, with the sun's 
illumination and current zenith-point highlighted.  This is updated in
real-time, and equivalent views displaying the zenith location and area
illumination of either the moon or the other planets are menu options.<br>

<p><img alt="Earth View" src="./gx/ayers/earth.gif">

<p>Another view-window displays the solar-system in schematic form.  This and
the earth-view windows can be animated, a sort of cartoon-movie which shows
the relative movements of the various celestial objects.

<center><h3>Availability</h3></center>

The xephem <a href="http://iraf.noao.edu/~ecdowney/xephem.html">web-site</a> 
is the place to visit if you'd like to investigate this application.  Source
for current development versions is available there; I've had good luck
compiling and running these.  Users lacking the Motif libraries can obtain
statically-linked binary releases from this site, and updated databases are 
available as well.  Elwood Downey is the author of xephem.  If you install
it, I'm sure he would be glad to hear any comments you might have.
