<H3><font color="maroon">Part Two: X configuration</font></H3> </center>
Welcome to the second installment of the series. In this installment,
you will configure your X server,
choose a Window Manager (WM,) and learn a few things about how the
X system works. Don't worry, it's
not as hard as you've heard, and can even be a great deal of fun, so
LET'S GET GRAPHICAL!
<P>In this installment, I will cover the following topics:
<ol>
<li>A brief introduction to the X windowing system
<li>Supported Hardware
<li>Unsupported Hardware
<li>Gathering Information about your hardware
<li>Safety concerns and precautions
<li>Starting the configuration program
<li>Configuration of the mouse under X
<li>Configuration of your video card
<li>Configuration of your monitor
<li>Testing your configuration
<li>Customization tips and tricks
<li>Troubleshooting your configuration
<li>Resources for further information
</ol>
<P>While the steps needed to configure the X system are fairly standardized,
due to some differences and
peculiarities between the Slackware 3.5 and RedHat 5.1 versions of
Linux, where necessary, I will
distinguish between the steps to be taken to accomplish a given task
on each distribution.
<P> <HR> <P> 
<H4><font color="maroon">A brief introduction to the X windowing system</font></H4> 
This document will cover the configuration of the X windowing system,
XFree86 version 3.3.2-2. This is
the version that ships with both RedHat 5.1 and Slackware 3.5. If you
are using a different version of
XFree86, your mileage may vary, although many of the steps will remain
the same.
<P>Unlike Windows based systems, the X windowing system is composed primarily
of two separate and
distinct components, the X Server, and the Window Manager.
<P>The X Server is the interface between the hardware and the Window Manager.
This is somewhat
analogous, although not entirely, to the "video driver" in Windows.
In addition to servicing hardware
requests, it also performs several other important functions, such
as managing all X connections to the
machine, both local and remote.
<P>One of the advantages of a Unix or Linux system is the fact that it
was built from the ground up to be a
multi-user system.
<P>This gives a Unix or Linux system the ability to service, or "host"
many users, both locally through the use
of TTY connections or virtual terminals, or remotely through socket
based communication using a variety
of protocols.
<P>For an overview of the concept of remote X sessions, see my article
in the September Issue of the Linux
Gazette.
<P>It is important to note that the aforementioned X Server, as well as
most of the functions it performs, occur
in the background, and are functionally transparent to the end user.
In short, it's a busy little beaver!
<P>The second component of the X windowing system is the Window Manager.
This is the element of the X
system that comprises the portion of the Graphical User Interface that
you interact with. The Window
Manager is responsible for the look and feel of your desktop; as well
the front-end interface to the
commands and programs you run.
<P>There are many Window Managers available for Linux, and each person
will have their favorite. It will be
up to you to decide which one best fits your needs and preferences.
<P>Since both distributions default to FVWM95, I will confine myself to
this Window Manager for the
purposes of this introductory document. For further information on
some of the many other Window
Managers available, consult the resources section.

<P>(*) Note, chips marked in this way have either limited support or the
drivers
for them are not actively maintained.
<P>All of the above are supported in both 256 color, and some are supported
in
mono and 16-color modes, and some are supported an higher color depths.
<P>Refer to the chipset-specific README files (currently for TGA, Matrox,
Mach32,
Mach64, NVidia, Oak, P9000, S3 (except ViRGE), S3 ViRGE, SiS, Video7,
Western

chipsets.
<P>The monochrome server also supports generic VGA cards, using 64k of
video mem-
ory in a single bank, the Hercules monochrome card, the Hyundai HGC1280,
Sigma LaserView, Visa and Apollo monochrome cards.
<P>The VGA16 server supports memory banking with the ET4000, Trident, ATI,
NCR,
OAK and Cirrus 6420 chipsets allowing virtual display sizes up to about
1600x1200 (with 1MB of video memory). For other chipsets the display
size is
limited to approximately 800x600.
<P>Notes: The Diamond SpeedStar 24 (and possibly some SpeedStar+) boards
are NOT
supported, even though they use the ET4000.
<P>The Weitek 9100 and 9130 chipsets are not supported (these are used
on the Dia-
mond Viper Pro and Viper SE boards). Most other Diamond boards will
work with
this release of XFree86. Diamond is actively supporting The XFree86
Project,
Inc.
<P>3DLabs GLINT, Permedia and Permedia 2 support could unfortunately not
be
included in XFree86 3.3.2 since there are open issues regarding the
documentation and whether or not they were provided to us under NDA.

<H4><font color="maroon">Unsupported Hardware</font></H4> 
If X does not directly support your video card and/or monitor, all
may not be lost. Try choosing one of the
"generic" cards and monitors that most closely resembles your hardware.
The SVGA server is a good
place to start if you have an unsupported card. Another possible option
is the VGA16 server. Almost any
card will run (at reduced performance) with one of these two servers.
<P>Another possible option is to consider purchasing a "commercial" X server.
Two possible choices are:
<BR>MetroX http://www.metrolink.com/
<BR>XInside http://www.xinside.com/
<P>These commercial servers often support a wider range of cards and monitors,
due to the willingness of the
developer of the X server software to abide by Non Disclosure Agreements
required by some card
manufacturers. In plain English, some card manufacturers refuse to
work with the open source community.
Something to consider the next time you get ready to purchase a video
card.
<P>Likewise, the generic VGA or SVGA monitors will usually at least get
you up and running. However, as I
have mentioned previously, DO NOT EXCEED THE CAPABILTIES OF YOUR CARD
OR MONITOR!
Otherwise, you may initiate what is called in the electronics world
"a smoke test." This is a bad thing, and
makes your house smell, as well as setting off your smoke detector.
<P> <HR> <P> 
<H4><font color="maroon">Gathering Information about your hardware</font></H4> 
It is imperative that you know as much as you can about your video
card and monitor. (You did keep those
manuals and documentation didn't you?)
<P>If you do not have the documentation available, check the various docs
in the /var/X11R6/lib/docs area, or
search the Internet. Another possible option is to go directly to the
manufacturer's website if available, and
acquire the specifications there. A final option on some monitors,
the synch rates is sometimes listed on
the back along with the model number and other information.
<P>Make sure, if at all possible, that your card and monitor are on the
supported hardware list. This will save
you a lot of grief and give you the best chance of success, as well
as enabling you to take full advantage of
the accelerated features of your video card.
<P>At a bare minimum, you should have the following information available:
Manufacturer, make and model of your video card: e.g. Matrox Millenium
Amount of RAM resident on the video card: e.g. 8MB
<P>Manufacturer, make and model of your monitor: e.g. Viewsonic 15E
Horizontal synch rate of your monitor: e.g. 31.5-82.0
Vertical synch rate of your monitor: e.g. 40-100
<P>A special note on mice:
If at all possible, try to get a three-button mouse. X uses the middle
button for some special functions.
While it is possible to configure a two-button mouse to behave as a
three-button mouse using an emulator
that requires you to depress both buttons simultaneously to emulate
the middle button, this feature is flaky
at best on many mice and sometimes hard to master.
<P>Note for PS/2 mice users:
It has been reported that some users experience problems with the behavior
of a PS/2 mouse under X. This
is almost always due to the fact that the general-purpose mouse (gpm)
program is being loaded at boot
time, and for some reason, freaks out X.
<P>Some have suggested adding a variety of switches or other parameters
to the start up file that are purported
to correct this problem. However, I have had limited success with these
methods. Sometimes they will
correct the problem, other times they will not.
<P>What does work all the time is to comment out the start up of gpm at
boot time.
<P>On a Slackware machine, cd to /etc/rc.d/rc.local and place a pound sign
(#) in front of the lines that look
similar to the following:
<PRE> 
# echo starting gpm
# gpm /dev/mouse
</PRE> 
<P>Should you find the need to use gpm while in text mode, simply type
gpm &lt;return&gt; and start it manually.
<P>On a RedHat machine, from the command prompt, simply type setup
&lt;return&gt;
<P>You will be presented with a dialog box prompting you to select a configuration
tool. Select ntsysv then
<BR>tab to the run button and press return.
<P>Scroll down the dialog box until you see an entry for gpm. Highlight
this entry and depress the spacebar to
remove the asterix (*), then exit.
<P> <HR> <P> 
<H4><font color="maroon">Safety concerns and precautions</font></H4> 
Although the X windowing system offers infinite flexibility and configurability,
it is very picky about what
hardware it will and will not run on.
<P>Just as Unix or Linux will not run on marginal hardware that may work
with Windows, it may or may not
run on marginal or clone-type video cards and monitors.
<P>While it is possible to "hand tune" X to work with just about any video
card and monitor, to do so is NOT
RECOMMENDED. Diddling around with your clock settings, choosing a card
or monitor "similar" to
your equipment, or just picking horizontal and vertical synch rates
at random can damage or destroy your
video card or monitor. DON'T DO IT!
<P>The optimal configuration, and the only one I can recommend, is to make
sure your video card and monitor
are explicitly listed and supported by X before trying to configure
and run it. While I do offer some
suggestions for people with unsupported hardware, there is no guarantee
these suggestions will work, nor
do I offer any assurance that they won't damage your equipment. Proceed
at your own risk.
<P> <HR> <P> 
<H4><font color="maroon">Starting the configuration program</font></H4> 
Before you can actually use X, you must generate a configuration file
that tells X about your video card,
monitor, mouse, and some default preference information required to
initialize the X environment and get it
up and running. All of the following configuration steps will need
to be done as root initially, then if
necessary, you can create your own unique X configuration for each
of your respective users.
<P>The method and program used to accomplish this task will depend on which
flavor of Linux you are using.
<P>NOTE: The instructions listed below assume you are using Xfree86 3.3.2-2.
If you are using one of the
commercial X servers, such as MetroX or XInside, your configuration
methods may be different. Please
consult the documentation that comes with your commercial product.
<P><font color="navy">Slackware 3.5</font>:<BR> 
The X configuration program for Slackware 3.5 is called XF86Setup.
To start the program, at the
command prompt, simply type:
<P>XF86Setup &lt;return&gt;
<P>You will be presented with a dialog box prompting you to switch to graphics
mode. Select OK.
<P>After a moment, you will enter the XF86Setup screen. Along the top of
the screen will be a series of
buttons to configure the various components of the X windowing system.
They will appear in a horizontal
row in the following order:
<P>Mouse Keyboard Card Monitor Modeselection Other
<P><font color="navy">RedHat 5.1</font>:<BR> 
The X configuration program for RedHat Linux is called Xconfigurator.
To start the program, at the
command prompt, simply type:
<P>Xconfigurator &lt;return&gt;
<P>Press return to get past the welcome screen, then skip to the video
card section.
<P> <HR> <P> 
<H4><font color="maroon">Configuration of the mouse under X</font></H4> 
<P><font color="navy">Slackware 3.5</font>:<BR> 
This should already have been taken care of during installation. If
you have something other than a three-button mouse, be sure to select the Emulate3Buttons option for maximum
functionality under X.
<P>The next option, Keyboard, should be already configured properly. Under
normal circumstances, no
adjustments should be required here.
<P><font color="navy">RedHat 5.1</font>:<BR> 
This should already have been taken care of for you during installation.
If not, break out of the
Xconfigurator and run mouseconfig, then start over.
<P> <HR> <P> 
<H4><font color="maroon">Configuration of your video card</font></H4> 
<P><font color="navy">Slackware 3.5</font>:<BR> 
Select the card option from the menu at the top of your screen. Scroll
down and select the appropriate
video card for your system.
<P>If necessary, you may also need to select the Detailed setup button
to configure Chipset, RamDac,
ClockChip, Device options, and the amount of video RAM on your card.
Usually these options will be
probed automatically. I only mention this so you can "tweak" the card
if you are feeling brave.
<P><font color="navy">RedHat 5.1</font>:<BR> 
The setup program will now autoprobe for your type and model of video
card. On the plus side, this can
simplify things, IF it properly identifies your card. On the minus
side, if it does not, it does not offer you
an alternative to manually choose the card. If your card is not properly
identified, see the unsupported card
section for some general suggestions on some things to try.

If you have the documentation available, you may enter the Horizontal
and Vertical Synch rates manually
in the input boxes, or alternately, you may choose one of the preset
configurations in the scroll box.
<P>It is almost always safe to choose either the Standard VGA or Super
VGA option to start, then work up to
the specific settings and color resolution you desire (subject to the
limitations of your hardware.)
<P>Lastly, select the Modeselection option, and choose your desired screen
resolution and color depth. To
begin with, less is better. Start with 640x480 @ 8bpp to start, then
work your way up.
<P>When you are finished with your configuration, select done from the
bottom of the screen, and the setup
program will attempt to start X with the configuration you have selected.
If all goes well, you will be
prompted to write the configuration to your XF86Config file and exit.
If you have any problems, you will
be prompted to try again until you have your configuration setup properly.
<P><font color="navy">RedHat 5.1</font>:<BR> 
At the Monitor Setup dialog screen, scroll down and choose the appropriate
monitor. If your monitor is not
listed, choose generic or custom. If you choose custom, have your vertical
sync rate and amount of video
RAM handy, you will need them.
<P>You will be presented with a dialog box that contains the same monitor
choices listed in the Slackware
section. After choosing a monitor, you will be prompted to select your
vertical sync rate. Finally, you will
be asked to specify the amount of video RAM present on your card.
<P>After exiting the Xconfigurator program, you are ready to test your
new configuration
<P> <HR> <P> 
<H4><font color="maroon">Testing your configuration</font></H4> 
At the command prompt, simply type startx. If all went well, you should
shortly be on your way. If for any
reason X fails to start up, go back and run your configuration program
again, double-checking that you
have all the proper settings.

<H4><font color="maroon">Customization tips and tricks</font></H4> 
By default, both Slackware and RedHat install the FVWN95 Window Manager,
a Windows 95 look-alike.
This is probably a good start for users transitioning from a Windows
based environment, as it will be the
most familiar to you.
<P>Since X is infinitely configurable, and also stunningly cryptic at times,
an in depth discussion of all the
configuration options available under X is beyond the scope of this
document. However, what follows are
a few things you may be interested in.
<P>A few words about the X desktop:
<ol>
<li>X allows the use of something called a virtual desktop, which is
simply a fancy way of saying you can
have a virtual desktop resolution that is larger than the actual resolution
you have set your monitor to.
As an example, say you have your card resolution to 1024x768 @ 32 bit
color. X allows you to set
your virtual desktop to 1280x1024, which some people love, and some
people hate. If you want to
disable this behavior, locate your XF86Config file, scroll down to
the Screen sections, and look for a
line similar to the following: Virtual 1280 1024. To disable the virtual
screen, change this entry
to the default screen resolution you have chosen, 1024 768 in this
example. Similarly, to enable it,
simply change to the next higher resolution, 1280 1024 in this example.
<li>FVWN95, as well as the other popular Window Managers, offer a variety
of configuration options.
Experiment with them until you find the one you like best.
<li>Finally, depending on your distribution, you may or may not have
other Window Managers available
to you. Experiment with the different ones available on your system
until you find the one you like
best. My personal favorite is Afterstep, but you may find you can't
live without one of the others.
Choose the one you like best. Under FVWM95 on a Slackware box, choose
Exit Fvwm95 from the
Start menu, then choose the Window Manager you want to use from the
drop down box accessed by
moving your mouse to the right edge of the menu option, highlighting
the arrow (&gt;) that resides there.
On a RedHat box, from the Start menu, choose Preferences/WM Style to
change to a different Window
Manager.
</ol>
<P>Stupid X Tricks:
<ol>
<li>To start an X session, simply type startx at the command prompt.
<li>If you have configured your X server for more than one screen resolution,
say 640x480, 800x600, and
1024x768, and you want to switch between the different resolutions,
simply depress Cntrl+Alt+(either
the plus (+) sign, or the minus (-) sign to switch to a higher or lower
resolution, respectively. Why
would you want to do this? I often do a great deal of Web Design on
my machine, and being able to
quickly see what a given page will look like at different resolutions
is quite handy.
<li>To terminate an X session, you can either exit the session using
the appropriate menu selection for
your respective Window Manager, or you may depress Cntrl+Alt+Backspace.
<li>You may also set up your personal user accounts (you're not always
working as root are you?) by
setting up an .xinitrc file in your home directory, if needed. Usually,
this is only necessary on a
Slackware box. On a RedHat box, I believe this is taken care of for
you. Check the documentation.
</ol>

<H4><font color="maroon">Troubleshooting your configuration</font></H4> 
Basically, there are only a few things that can go wrong with your
X installation. Either the X server will
refuse to start at all, the X server will start but you get a blank
screen, or the X server will start, but for one
reason or another, the screen will be improperly sized, flickering,
or unreadable.
<P>If the X server refuses to start at all, pay close attention to the
error messages that appear while the server
errors out. Most frequently, this is an improperly configured monitor
or card that causes the server to die.
Check your configuration.
<P>If the X server starts, but the screen exhibits an improper size, or
excessive flickering, you probably need to
adjust your horizontal or vertical sync rates.
<P>If the screen appears to be unreadable, due to excessive lines or smearing
of the pixels, check your card and
monitor configurations.
<P>Simply put, most problems can be traced back to an improper configuration
of the card, the monitor, or
both. This is why I strongly recommend making sure your hardware be
explicitly supported, or using one
of the "generic" configurations to start with.
<P>Beyond this, check the documentation for specific card set problems,
specific monitor problems, and other
general troubleshooting procedures.
<P>Another possible option is to troll the newsgroups for a similar problem,
or post a brief description of the
trouble you are having, and hopefully, someone with a similar problem
they have solved before will get
back to you.
<P>If all else fails, drop me e-mail and I'll be glad to try to help.

I had originally planned to include the configuration of your basic
networking setup into this installment as
well, but as you can see, this is a real porker as it is. So look for
the networking stuff in part three.
