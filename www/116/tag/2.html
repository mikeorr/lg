Hi, all -
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Got a curious Linux problem here that I'm trying to puzzle out, and
after struggling with it for a bit, I remembered that I'd heard of this
thing called The Answer Gang... :)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm trying to boot Linux on my fiancee's laptop, a Sony VAIO F590K -
something that she'd be quite happy to see, since her opinion is that
Micr0s0ft should have stopped when the going was good - i.e., DOS5.0
Simple, right? Uh, well... the only problem is that it's got a dead
CD-ROM drive. She's going to order a new one soon, but until then...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The VAIO doesn't support booting from USB. However, I've managed to load
Puppy Linux onto a 1GB USB FlashDrive and burn the appropriate disk image
(provided by Puppy) to a floppy - it's an ingenious system (the floppy
boots FreeDOS, which searches for and boots the FlashDrive) that could
probably be easily adapted to boot other distros... if I only understood
exactly what to tweak and how.
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) " 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> I'm afraid that I've met my match (at
least for the moment) in trying to understand the whole shebang.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I've looked at many LiveCD distros in the past few days. A number of
them can be run from USB - but require that the machine boot from the
USB, not an option here. I've even carefully studied the "Booting
Knoppix from USB" HOWTO, which assumes the same thing, to see if I could
somehow mingle Puppy's floppy boot and Knoppix on a USB stick... no
luck.

Use Knoppix boot.img on a floppy and copy the KNOPPIX directory to the
USB stick. This should work provided the kernel+initrd on the boot.img
supports USB---I think it does but there may be a kernel boot option.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The Knoppix boot mechanism is:

</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I think puppy uses Xorg and also possibly the vesa driver only. You may
have better luck with Knoppix.

Oh, and PXE booting is out as well: the F590K does support network
booting... however, PXE does not (yet) speak PCMCIA.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, given all of the above - what do you folks think? Have any of you
had experience in booting something like this, or do you have any ideas
that I've perhaps missed?

Argh. So much for writing email while talking on the phone and being
derailed in the midst of it all by questions about tea selection (from a
large number of options, I might add - Kat and I are both heavily into
tea. I think I'll try her kelp tea this time... or maybe the
hibiscus...)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Puppy failed to recognize the video hardware in the VAIO. Key factor
I neglected to mention.

Ooops. Seems like Knoppix stopped using "boot.img" at v3.4 (I've got
3.7) - they use "isolinux" these days. There seems to be a bit of
discussion on the Net that mentions using the "boot.img" from the v3.3
CDs - I've seen reports that it Just Works - but I don't have one
available, and won't be able to download 3.3 until I get to a high-speed
connection. Would anyone here happen to have such a thing handy?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If someone happens to have a Knoppix 3.3 image, let me save you a bit of
time (obviously, you'll have to change the ISO image name to whatever it
actually is, and "<TT>/mountpoint</TT>" to some existing directory that you don't
mind using as a mountpoint for a few seconds.)
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong># Mount the image

However, examining <TT>/modules</TT> on that miniroot image gives me a clue: it's
full of SCSI modules but <em>  no  </em> USB modules. I'll "unwrap" that image
file, yank the miniroot out of it, mount that, and see about replacing
the SCSI modules with the USB ones; hopefully, Knoppix will be able to
recognize the USB FlashDrive as a result. The only thing I wonder about
is if the scanned devices in <TT>/dev</TT> need to be specified somewhere... I'll
look in the various .cfg files to make sure.

I have now "rebuilt" boot.img - a very interesting and educational
process, actually (in fact, I've hacked a script that I found on the Net
to do it all for me, since I had to do it repeatedly.) However, I have
left the USB pendrive with my fiancee for the week - she's in New York
while I'm teaching a class in San Francisco; I have no floppy drive on
my machine, and thus no way to experiment with it until I get back.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you, everyone, and Kapil in particular for your help with this -
I'm beginning to feel like I actually understand that booting process
(as contrasted against the "standard" one.) Again, I'll report the
results as soon as I have some - that will be sometime after this
weekend.

Well, if you only want to show her the livecd, how about you use and emulator?

Short intro into bittorrent: data is packed into small chunks. You download
a chunk on your machine and the next user that wants also this chunk
downloads it from your machine, thus relieving the main server of the high
load since the load is spread over all downloading (and uploading) clients.
The download doesn't have to be sequential, packets come in from different
downloading and uploading parties. Even after you got everything your
machine keeps uploading for others - this is one thing to watch out for.

Presumably, this would download a Knoppix ISO onto her machine? That's
not a problem; our laptops are Ethernetted together. Although it's good
to see that 3.8 is out (&lt;clickety-click&gt;&lt;download&gt;...)
</STRONG></P>

and the folks that made the .bat file made some errors IMHO: -m should be
more in the range of 128 (smaller than what shm has, whatever that means on
winblows) and I think the error message in the pic also came from an error
of theirs but hey, it's close.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Well, I guess (haven't looked at this again) that the japanese knoppix
developers that made this image made some config error somewhere. I mean,
you essentially have the knoppix image, it's only still on the cd... And you
have qemu. On linux this works then like this:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><CODE>
qemu -cdrom=/dev/cdrom -boot d
</CODE></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
and there you go. Where is the device under win? That's the problem there.
You did notice that I ran the knoppix in an emulated win session? :)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
BTW: qemu with kqemu (the kernel module he has now on linux) gives really a
speedup to ~70% native cpu speed. Awesome (that's why win4lin pro uses qemu
underneath)

Helps?

I'm not sure - but I'll be back in NYC this Saturday, and will have time
to play with computer stuff a few days later, after we get back to St.
Augustine. But I'll give it a shot if the current pre-programmed
solution (the modified Knoppix boot floppy, the preparation of which was
so superbly aided by Kapil's suggestions) doesn't work. If it <em> does </em>
work, I've built a great script that automates the somewhat painful
process of creating it, and I'll definitely publish it as well.

Ahh, that's it.  He must have been all of 17 or 18 years old when he wrote
that, as I remember it from 1989 or '90.  I think he sold the idea to Phil
Katz who incorporated it into his product.  It was an algorithm that would
uncompress a DOS executable, transparent to DOS, after being loaded by the
program loader, before being executed.  Handy for saving space in the days
of 40 MB disk drives.
