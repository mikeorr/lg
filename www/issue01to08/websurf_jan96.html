<P>
Howdy Web sufers!

<P>
I plan on this being a monthly input to the Linux Gazette, so follow along.

<H3>Read Audio for Linux!</H3>
<P>
I was surfing the net two weeks ago and happened on a very cool site called <B>Real Audio</B>.
This is software that allows a site to 'broadcast' voice messages in real time.  If I got
the real time part wrong, sorry. the main thing here is that the Real Audio people have promised
a player and encoder for Unix sometime before the end of 1995.  Well, 1996 is about to happen
and no announcement has been made concerning our favorite OS.  
<P>
<B>Bug 'em!!</B> Yes folks, send in email to <A HREF="mailto: support@realaudio.com">
&lt;support@realaudio.com&gt;</A> and tell them that you run Linux and give them the 
model of soundcard you have.
<P>
<H3>Netscape 2.0b3 ships!</H3>
<P>Lastest version of this favorite web browser is now available from <B>ftp3.netscape.com</B>
<P>First impression are not to bother downloading it!  Its over 2 meg in size and no docs are
included!.  This particular version is timed to expire in Feb of 1996, so don't get rid of your
v 1.12 unless you plan on buying a license for v 2.0b3.  
<P>The main reason for upgrading to the new version is to take advantage of 'plug-ins'.
These are add-on products that offer enhanced functions within Netscape.  Here are three
plug-ins for you to read about and drool over!
<P>
<H3>Shockwave by MacroMedia</H3>
<P>The Shockwave plug-in lets users interact with Director presentations right in a Netscape
Navigator window. Animation, clickable buttons, links to URLs, digital video movies, sound,
and more can be integrated within the presentation to deliver a rich multimedia experience.
<P>
</B>WEBFX</B> BY PAPER SOFTWARE 
Fly through 3-D worlds with the WebFX Plug-in. After downloading this plug-in, you'll be able to view
VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) worlds available at many Web sites. 
<P>
I have not provided much in the way of information concerning the plug-in products for Netscape
1.2.  Here are the links:
<P><A HREF="http://www.realaudio.com/">Real Audio (www.realaudio.com)</A>
<P><A HREF="http://www.pce.net/sales/petert/macromedio.html">Shockwave (www.pce.net)</A>
<P><A HREF="http://www.home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/plugins/index.html">
	Plug In Products (www.home.netscape.com)</A>
<P>
Look through the provided links. Send email to the support/information people provided at each site
and tell them you use Linux and would like to see a version for the Linux OS.  To paraphrase Arlo
Guthry:  If one person emails and tells 'em about Linux, they'll think its nice; if two people
email and tells 'em about Linux they'll think those two are sick and recommend the romper room.  <B>But</B>
if 50 people emailed 'em about Linux they'll think its a movement.  And just maybe more software 
will become available to us and <D>YES</B>, we can get rid of Windoze.
<P>
Good day!

<P>
Beam me back to the <A HREF="./lg_issue6.html">Linux Gazette</A>, Scotty!
