<P>
Hello, Gang!
</P>
<P>
I appologize in advance because I know this is going
to be a long letter. The thing is, I've had this
problem for more than a year now and I hope that you
can help me solve it. Plus, I just have to tell
somebody about it 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
The problem showed itself for the first time when I
installed NVIDIA GLX drivers on my box. At the moment,
I had a Riva TNT2 M64, and I wanted to see how far can
I get with those drivers. Although most people hated
NVIDIA drivers, I had no problem with them. Or, at
least I thought so. Quake3 was fine, blender too, but
as the time passed, I noticed that my box wasn't
stable any more. Sometimes it happened that, out of no
obvious reason, X hangs. I can move my mouse pointer,
but computer doesn't respond to anything. Curiously
enough, if I had xmms started, the songs would
continue to play on normally, and everything seemed to
work fine - except the fact that X is hung and I
couldn't switch to console, either. Later, I found one
way to reproduce the bug quickly, rather than to wait
untill it happens (it was simply playing the "Virtual
Machine" screensaver but, as you will shortly see, it
seems that this wasn't of any importance) and I tried
to log in from my laptop via telnet when the hang
occurs. I succeeded, and everything seemed to work on
the box side, I couldn't find ANY reason why X was
hung, nor any indication that it actually happened.
Furthermore, when I killed X (from telnet), box would
have returned to console happily, and I was able to
start X again! As soon as I returned to the original
nv driver, system was steady as rock again. So, buggy
NVIDIA driver/X version/kernel, I figured. But, as the
time passed, I've changed a lot of those and so many
combinations (XFree86, Xorg, kernel 2.4.x, 2.6.x,
almost every NVIDIA driver...) that I finally had to
admit that something was seriously wrong. Many nights
without sleep and I finally found the way to
workaround the problem -- setting "NvAGP" option to
"0". As it shows, using either internal NVIDIA AGP
support, or kernel agpgart hangs the X in a mentioned
manner. I didn't know why, but now everything was
accelerated, and system was stable again, so I forgot
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
Since then, I've "upgraded" Riva to Radeon 9200. For a
long time I was using only ati driver (FireGL drivers
didn't support Xorg, and I didn't want to revert to
XFree out of principle), but a month ago I had
everything ready to actually try FireGL drivers. After
some problems, I finally got it to work, and I was
happy. But, after few hours -- same thing as with
Riva. Hang of death. The old trick of reproducing the
error doesn't work now, but I found another one --
dragging the mouse pointer rapidly while holding left
mouse button (over empty <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> desktop). All other
symptoms were exactly the same as with Riva (music
plays, everything works...) except that now, when I
kill the X from laptop, whole system hangs and nothing
wors anymore (including networking -- telnet session
terminates). So, it's almost certain that this is a
hardware problem, but none of this happens under XP.
So, I try to tweak various fgl parameters
(disabling/enabling user page locking,
internal/external AGPGART, ...), but the problem
persists.
</P>
<P>
Is this a hardware problem (XP works fine, after all)?
Do I have something misconfigured (I tried various AGP
aperture sizes in BIOS, but it doesn't solve the
problem)? Is there any way that I can "disable" usage
of AGP as I did with NVIDIA driver? I don't have
enough money to buy a new motherboard, so please don't
tell me that it is the only solution

And, finally (finally!) techical stuff:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>Box: 	AMD Duron 750
	384MB RAM
	VIA CT-7AIA
	Radeon 9200 64MB DDR

(at the moment:)
	Slackware 10.2
	kernel 2.6.11-9

$ /sbin/lspci | grep -i agp
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365
[KT133/KM133 AGP]
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I have via-agp module loaded <em>  before  </em> loading agpgart,
because fglrx module doesn't work without it
(fglrxinfo reports usage of Mesa, not ATI drivers, and
3D acceleration doesn't work).
I appreciate your help!

<BR>Jim Harvey (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?cc=harveyj@entrenet.com&subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%20120%5D%20help%20wanted%20%232">harveyj from entrenet.com</a>
<BR>Answer by Rick Moen (<em>LG</em> Contributing Editor)

<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I am trying to get a copy of the Fractal Image and Sequencing Codec
(FIASCO) that was announced  in the Sept 2000 issue of your journal.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You've actually written to the mailing list of the Answer Gang, which is
a group of volunteers who collectively write column in the magazine that
researches and answers people's technical Linux problems.  In that
spirit, let's see what we can turn up.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The item you mention appears to be at
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issue57/lg_bytes57.html#software"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue57/lg_bytes57.html#software</A> .  (I mention
that because it'll help the other volunteers if they wish to lend a
hand.  It's always a good idea to make it easy for others to assist you,
if you're hoping for help.  Thus, URLs in this case are useful.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The kit's maintainer, Dr. Ullrich Hafner, also had a January 2001
<em> Linux Journal  </em> article on the subject:
<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4367"
	>http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4367</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
All of the links returned by various search engines appear broke.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Some amount of googling later, I found that the FIASCO toolkit appears
to have become unmaintained <em>  and  </em> is not found mirrored downstream in
any of the usual places.  That's unfortunately all too common among open
source inventions that were precariously hosted only in one single
location and never quite caught on.  Ours is a rather carelessly
Darwinian software ecology.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Depending on what you're looking for, you might find equivalents of
particular tools (cjpeg, djpeg, etc.) in the libjpeg source (currently
jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz) published by the Independent JPEG Group at
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg"
	>ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
NNetpbm (<A HREF="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net"
	>http://netpbm.sourceforge.net</A>) does include pnmtofiasco, which
compresses the named pbm, pgm, or ppm image files, or Standard Input if
no file is named, and produces a FIASCO file on Standard Output.  "
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyhow, back to Hafner's reference implementation of the FIASCO CODEC --
Internet Archive to the rescue:
<A HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20000829071003/ulli.linuxave.net/fiasco"
	>http://web.archive.org/web/20000829071003/ulli.linuxave.net/fiasco</A> (the
last mirrored version of Hafner's page) has mostly broken links -- but
the source code RPM package, fiasco-1.1-1.src.rpm, is still retrievable.
I have done so, pulled apart the RPM, and extracted its tarball for the
benefit of you and posterity.  You'll now find it  at:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
<A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/utilities-general/fiasco-1.1.tar.gz"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/pub/linux/utilities-general/fiasco-1.1.tar.gz</A>
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
There is also a copy of the RPM SPEC file for that source tarball.
I hope that helps!
</STRONG></P>

Hi Rick:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Thanks for all the help. I fully understood that your groups mandate was to
answer Linux technical problems. However, from past experience volunteer
groups are by definition enthusiastic, challenge-oriented people. You have
just confirmed this observation.

<P>
Thanks again.

<P>
Dear Supporter of Noepatents.eu.org,
</P>
<P>
Let me thank you for your participation in our web demonstration in the
spring.  As you know, our efforts ultimately led to the rejection of the
proposed software patent directive by the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
We now have the next opportunity to demonstrate the unpopularity of
software patents, and to draw attention to our cause.  For the most
prestigious awards in EU politics, the "EV50 Europeans of the Year
Awards" by the European Voice (an EU-focused weekly newspaper), the jury
has nominated two software patent critics, Michel Rocard MEP and
NoSoftwarePatents.com founder Florian Mueller.
</P>
<P>
With the power of the Internet, we would like to ensure that our
candidates win, and nominees who are in favor of software patents (such
as EU commissioner McCreevy) lose.  Please participate in the public
Internet poll, and you can find voting recommendations and further
instructions here: <A HREF="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/ev50/vote.html"

Hi There,
Recently a Linux guy (Now moved away) setup a Linux Redhat Firewall server
connected to a Cable Modem for our Windows PC's to share Internet etc.
</P>
<P>
Now the Browsing is ok and Email is ok, but we are having problems with
FTP.
</P>
<P>
We can connect ok to the IP Address and the username/password verifies ok,
but then we get a message saying eg:-
</P>

<blockquote><pre>500 I won't open a connection to 192.168.0.13 &lt;http://192.168.0.13&gt; (only to

<P>
Note:- I am on the Windows pc getting the IP Address
192.168.0.13&lt;<A HREF="http://192.168.0.13&gt"
	>http://192.168.0.13&gt</A>;.
</P>
<P>
Now i tried passive mode using the same ftp port 21 and same problem.
The linux guy said we have to mod the IP Tables somewhere, but he is
not exactly sure where to do it to allow us to FTP from local windows pc's.?
I have included the full error message ftp log below. I found the IPTables
File on the Linux box, but have no idea what to do there. Any help would
be greatly appreciated.  (Full FTP Log Error).

<BR>Answered by Jimmy O'Regan

<P><STRONG>
Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I find your article very offending, and I think you should modify it
in order to reflect the reality, and here is why:
</STRONG></P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Before I even look at the rest, allow me to apologise in advance: the
article has been published, and will not be changed.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
Can I have your permission to forward your mail for publication next month?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Only if I have permission to publish your e-mail aswell.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Of course.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
1) multiple people working on the installer/updater
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Yes, it is true that WinLibre had more than just one people working
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
on that. But! If you look at the project listings from other mentoring
organizations, you can see that the same thing is present in the
following mentoring organizations too: Python, Nmap, Internet 2, Drupal
and possibly more... Why does it bothers you only at the winlibre project?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The impression I got is that these were separate implementations of the
same thing. With the other projects you mentioned, it was clear that
these students were working on different aspects of the same project.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Well, it's partially true for the both cases. As for WinLibre, we had 2
students working on separate implementations of the same thing, while the
others were working on different aspects. As for the others, I know (source
SoC students themselves) that in some cases 2 or more students were working
on separate implementations of the same thing aswell. The reason why it is
ok, is that the mentoring organizations had no way to know if a student will
finish his/her project or not. The number of finished projects is less than
90%, and even this percentage is way above the expectations (66.67%) on the
beginning of SoC. So it was fairly reasonable for some mentoring
organizations to have 2 students working on the different implementations of
the same thing in case the thing was high priority for the mentoring
organization.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
If this installer is really a single installer with several people
working on different aspects, as with the other projects, then please
accept my unreserved apologies, and my promise that a correction will be
published next month.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
To compleatly clear it out, here is the correct list of the WinLibre
projects:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Finished projects:
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
- installer (2 students)
- updater (1 student)
- control centre (1 student)
- MacLibre (1 student)
- 3 -original- games (3 students, 1 per game)
- Final Touch <TT>/or</TT> Image Manipulation Tool/ (1 student)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Failed projects:
- CDRoast GUI (1 student)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
2) Michael Rybak's "Sneaky Snakes"
Your text about this project is a complete missinformation. First:
please take a look at it before you call it a "snake clone", because it
has a totally unique concept, and it is not even similar to the snake
game in any aspect. Also, you've used the words: "One project that has
been singled out as a waste of funding". Ok, yes it was singled out, but
by -one- single person, Uros Trebec, while all the other people on that
thread in summer-discuss (which is undoubtable your source) supported
the project. Also you should check out Uros's previous posts on
summer-discuss, and you will find out that your only source is a person
that was planning to cheat in SoC, but got rejected.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I will admit that that message was <EM>a</EM> source for that opinion, I will
also admit the possibility that it was the source for the other places I
saw that opinion voiced, but it was <EM>not</EM> the only source of that or
similar opinions.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Can you -please- point out the other sources?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hmm. Can't find anything at the moment, and I'm starting to suspect that
there was only one other source, and it was in comments on <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A>.
</P>
<P>
I'll get back to you if I find anything.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Have you actually downloaded it?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
No.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Snake clone:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
- you have one (or in some cases 2 or more) snake that collects pieces
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
on the playground and gets larger for each collected piece, if the snake
touches itself (or the other snakes), the player loses.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Sneaky Snakes:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
- 2 snakes are fighting each other by shooting their parts, they don't
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
collects pieces and if the snakes touches themselves or the other snake they
don't lose.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
That said, thank you for correcting me about the game: to my eyes, it
looked like a snake clone -- a more modern snake clone, but a snake
clone none the less.
</P>
<P>
Also, because it seems to have been unclear, I did not share that
opinion. I thought that my contrasting the game with the installers made
that clear, I'm sorry if it didn't.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
It wasn't clear.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would also like to inform you that every single SoC student I've
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
talked with finds your article very disappointing partially because of
the lack of objectivity and because some of the projects were left out
from the lists.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
As for objectivity, well, the magazine is called <EM>Linux</EM> Gazette. I
can't and won't apologise for giving a better write up to the projects I
personally had interest in: the article simply would not have been
written otherwise.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Hmm... Especially because it's -Linux- Gazette... You want Linux to be
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
more popular, or not? Do you want to see the Average Joe using Linux or not?
Well, if you do, here is an interesting fact: The Average Joe uses Windows.
If you want to attract him to opensource, you must show him that it's good.
How can you show him that? You give him opensource for Windows as step one,
as a step two, he'll be more openminded about Linux...
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I was coming from the PoV that if you show people the cool things they
can do with Linux that they <EM>can't</EM> do with Windows, they'll be more
likely to switch. The truth, I suspect, is somewhere between these views.
</P>
<P>
Projects were only omitted simply because I could find no information
about them. Please feel free to tell people to pass on information I
missed, either to me personally, or to <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A> (from
which we at Linux Gazette can publish them).

</STRONG></P>
<P>
Sorry about that. <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> was one of the most difficult organisations to
find any information about.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Ivan Barrera A.:
Mine too, but i didn't like his writting.
I also think he was offensive without the need.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
What was this project?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Lev Olkhovich:
Codehaus also has 12 applicants with only two projects. It is
especially strange because the link in the article points to a page
with times more projects.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I tried to provide a link to the proposed projects for each mentoring
organisation, but only to list the projects that were accepted. The
projects listed were the only ones I could find information about.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Pradeep Padala:
I actually didn't look at the article closely. It was forward to me by
a friend. Looking closely, it shows SoC in a bad light, I agree.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Kai Blin:
Also, I think the author didn't really do his homework. I can only talk
about the wine projects, but he missed a couple of details there.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I realise that Kai's project has been added to CVS since I submitted the
article, but beyond that I don't see what details I missed.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Pradeep Padala:
However, I must say, not everything he said is not wrong either.

Wed, 05 Oct 2005 09:28:36 +0100
</p>

<P><STRONG>
Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've forwarded your replies to the Google Summer of Code internal
mailinglist, so I guess people will contact you with their projects if they
want to. The attitude of most of them about the article is pretty negative
tough, so don't expect miracle.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, I guess that must have something to do with the way in which it
was presented, because the other mail I've received has been positive.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm not representing WinLibre in this issue, I'm writing only my
toughts, but I think it would be fair from your side if you'd publicly
apologize both to WinLibre and Google because of the unneeded negative
criticism presented in your article, especially because you stated that the
actual reason of this attack was the fact that the WinLibre is providing OSS
for the Windows platform. (note: we do it for MacOS too now, and the 3 games
are cross platform)
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Erm... no, I don't see how you've come to that conclusion. That WinLibre
is (was) a Windows-specific project is the reason I didn't take a very
close look at the projects: hence, why I termed 'Sneaky Snakes' a snake
clone. I admit that was inaccurate; I should also admit that I have very
little interest in games in general: it's most likely that I would have
come to the same conclusion no matter how hard I looked at it, simply
for lack of a better comparison.
</P>
<P>
The criticism was aimed at the duplication of effort in the installers.
That I called it a "waste of effort" was an error in tact -- I had
intended on changing that sentence to read "unnecessary duplication of
effort", but it slipped my mind. Even that, though less so, is still
going to be offensive to some.
</P>
<P>
I apologise wholly and unreservedly for the unnecessarily offensive
wording of that phrase; however, I will not apologise for having and
expressing a negative opinion of the duplication of effort.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
As a personal note: I don't understand why is it needed to have a
negative attitude about Google Summer of Code in any aspect, when Google
invested 2.000.000 USD in opensource. The entire OSS community should be
thankfull for this, no matter if there were glitches or not. The only thing
you can achieve by this attitude is to stop Google and potentially other
companies to make programs like SoC in future. Is really that what you want?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I think you're overreacting here. I made two critical comments of my own
in that article (the other was towards criticism made by an Ubuntu
representative), the rest was merely a reflection of the criticisms made
elsewhere: it would have been a bold-faced lie to say that everyone was
entirely happy about how SoC went.
</P>
<P>
As for Google discontinuing SoC because of some criticism? You must
realise how far-fetched that idea is. If Google was that thin-skinned as
a company, they wouldn't have survived long enough to have the first.
</P>

Hi Jimmy,

<P><STRONG>
Just read your Linux Gazette article on the Summer of Code, and I'd like
to submit a correction if at all possible. I was one of the students who
worked for Google, and you've got my project listed as Charun, which
isn't quite right. Charun was sort of a stunted proof-of-concept that I
put together for my qualifying exams, and while it's certainly the
intellectual ancestor of Query by Example (my actual project), QBE is
(1) far more robust, and (2) actually integrated into PostgreSQL (as in,
it modifies the SQL language itself, rather than being an after-the-fact
add-on).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You can find QBE at <A HREF="http://pgfoundry.org/projects/qbe"
	>http://pgfoundry.org/projects/qbe</A>, with source code
and (sparse) documentation. If it's possible to correct the link in the
article, I'd really appreciate it.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I'll pass this on to my editor, who gets final say on what does and does
not get corrected.
</P>
<P>
Can I also have your permission to pass this on to our mailbag for
publication next month? (Some of our mirrors are slow to update, and the
correction will go unnoticed by anyone who has already read the article).
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Absolutely. Thanks very much!

<P>
We (LG's editors) are thinking about deleting or changing the Site Map page,
and would like to get readers' input on it.  The
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/lg_index.hmtl">Site Map</a> is basically
a concatenation of the monthly TOCs, a kind of poor man's search engine.
It was really useful when it was made, but now has become so huge (309 KB)
that it's inconvenient to use, and will only get bigger.  Also, our search
engine at the time alternated between being broken, anemic, and
nonexistent.  Now we have a Google-powered search, and
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/authors/">author pages</a> linking to all
articles by each author.  So the only other use for the Site Map seems to
be offline searching, for people who don't have immediate access to the
Internet.  Are people using the Site Map page?  Does it have any other
uses we've missed?

The most obvious mechanism to get a reply on this from the <EM>readers</EM> and NOT

[someone among the Gang] 
As for the Site Map, if we need to keep it (and I'd rather keep it as-is
than repackage it into year-chunks or a dynamic page), how about moving
the Site Map link off the main menu and changing the home page to:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
I'm curious - not for or against, but simply curious - about the reason
that you don't like the idea of a dynamic page. For me, it has the
benefit of de-bloating the tarball. Am I missing some way in which it
would be a detriment?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike] 
Whenever I use the site map, I use the version that came on Linux
Format's DVD, rather than run up my phone bill... I'm sure we have a
quite few off-line readers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
It wouldn't be a detriment --- if the reason you're doing this is to
reduce the size of the tarball, then that's fine.  I welcome it, as
there's probably still a lot of people on dial-up trying to get each
issue.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thinking about it some more, I missed the reason (if there even was
one) why the current <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> maintainer doesn't ship the sitemap for
each LG deb  (this to me was always a grave mistake on his part --
plenty of other debs have much larger amounts of crap in them).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
Probably the same philosophy that had him leaving out TWDT.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
If we came up with a script that would do this for us (perl, awk,
whatever -- a language that was certainly common on almost all Linux
installations) then it would be a trivial matter to have it called as
part of the post-install scripts.  A similar process applies for RPMs.
Distributing it as part of lg-base.tgz (as I had mentioned in the past)
for those that download the raw tarballs from our FTP site would mean
they too get the benefit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's how I see things.  It's a good balance, because:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
*  You don't need any quantitative measures as to whether a certain
amount of people want to keep or remove the TOC.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
*  It reduces the size of the tarball considerably.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
*  It means that it can be generated as and when, for those that want
it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Just my thoughts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
... a "limited fare" meta-TOC [only covering issues you have
present] would not serve a purpose of spotting a specific past issue to
glom.  Though the KB does mention the right issue in the hotlink, since
our hotlinks mention issue numbers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
Are we going to publish the
thread in LG for next month and wait for reader's responses before a
plan of action is made?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
AFAIC, it's a dead letter already. There was never an overwhelming
reason for getting rid of it, nobody's adduced one, and I've seen
several people jump in fairly quickly to say that they do indeed use it;
ergo, it stays.

	>Greetings from Heather Stern</H3>
<!-- begin hgreeting -->

<p>
Greetings everyone, and welcome once more to the wonderful world of the
Answer Gang.
</p><p>
Those of you who follow the Mailbag may recall that I visited our Weekend
Mechanic, Thomas, as well as the country he lives in.  England was nice.
Rick, our resident Viking, took special care that I should have a maximum
amount of the very best information so I shouldn't get too wretchedly ripped
off.   I didn't follow all of his advice, but I think we managed to get less
burnt for his care, at least.
</p><p>
Sights I did get to see: foreign skies.  My favorite.  But then with a name
like 'starshine' for my domain you probably expected me to be fascinated
with that.  Great countryside - not just from above (keep your eyes open as
you pass sunset at the terminator - "wow" isn't enough to describe) - but
you rush past pasture and forest as much as an occasional industrial blip on
the trains.  Fascinating paintings on some underpass walkways - to my great
pleasure, there are walking/biking paths everywhere.  The motorways are full
of mildly crazy people but you don't have to have a car.
</p><p>
You <em>could</em> take the train just about everywhere for city-to-city
travel - but it's not all that cheap, even though it's not exactly "may as
well go for two weeks as a half day" kind of expensive.  I enjoyed a ferry
over to the Isle of Wight.  It was nice enough, with a curious church, a
plaza with plaques thanking those who prevented them being bombed completely
back to the stone age (instead of about halfway), the charter of the original
colony of Maryland...
</p><p>
2c tips for travellers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Before we went I
was unsure, now I'm positive;  if you travel there as a foreigner,
<strong>do</strong> get the <em>BritRail</em> pass ahead of time, it
<strong>is</strong> worth it.  The only reason I broke about even
with not getting one is because some of the things I really wanted to see
weren't to be reached by train.  There seems to be more than one on-line
vendor.  Also - it's possible to get them once you're in
the UK but they cost double, and you can't just get them anywhere.

<li>Click, don't walk, to your nearest
<em>online</em> American Express terminal, and use their FX4YOU service to
get the best exchange rate... and escape the extra service fees because
your transaction began outside airport control.  <strong>Keep your order
number</strong> as it's your proof of the transaction already in progress
but then show up at the AmEx kiosk, make your exchange, and go.

<li>Your ATM and credit card actually get decent exchange rates.  Make sure
you get charged in pounds and not your local currency;  you want
<em>your</em> bank to handle the exchange, again saving you
<strike>kickbacks</strike> extra service fees.

<li>Pack your luggage a little on the lighter side rather than stuffed;  if
you have to bring back an additional piece of luggage you may run into
weight limits per passenger.  Didn't catch me with that one, but I brought
a bunch of consumables.

<li>Airline food is so-so.  If you have allergies or care how much of
something you get, bring some snacks of your own; what you really get can't
be easily predicted.

<li>Don't buy the airport wireless, it's terribly expensive and will claim
nonsense like "a whole day of service" when you know you're just going to
arrive at the other end, fail to find a hotspot, manage to find your hotel,
and zonk.  Also see if you can find cybercafe shops instead of forking over
hotel rates for built-in internet.

<li>Small ordinary pubs where normal blokes and gals go for a meal or some
brews charge something like normal prices for normal food.  Fancy
restaurants on motorways near areas with hotels are bound to be a rip-off in
the money department.  Since the US dollar kinda sucks against the pound,
this would be the fast way to flatten your wallet.  Simple is good, and if
you've the opportunity, buy groceries.  My best lunch deal was 89 pence for
a sandwich at some local liquor store.
</ul>

<p>
I'm sure I'll make my way back there sometime.  It was as much fun to go to
Thomas' local LUG and speak about X windowing (one of my favorite topics)
and meet people I'd only ever known online.  Having entertained a very few
of them when they visited here made my arrival so much more pleasant.
</p><p>
In other adventures - Thomas has found online, the one, the only,
<em>the</em> xteddy teddybear.  Per his author's homepage, he's a Gund
"tender teddy".  Well, he's Gund Tender Teddy model 2123, a nice brown with
a cheery red bow, born 1983, and Thomas found him vacationing in Hawaii.
There's a ticket booked for him to the UK and xteddy will soon grace Thomas'
desk directly.
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"
                height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</p><p>
Winter's here, but I hope it's not too chill to you - in whatever way you
need to hear that.  Time for the hot choccy, I think; settle into a warm
chair, pore over a few techie manuals, and enjoy our current feast for thought.
See you next month!

<h1>Experiments with an iPod</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/nirendra.html">Awasthi Nirendra</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>What is this iPod?</h3>

<p>An <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> is a brand of
portable digital audio player designed by Apple Computer. The first
three generations of iPod use two ARM 7TDMI-derived CPUs running at
90 MHz, while later models have variable speed chips with a peak
speed of 80 MHz to save battery life.</p>

<p>This article is intended for those who want to either use their
iPod with Linux, or use Linux on their iPod.</p>

<h3>Connecting and Locating your iPod</h3>

<p>The first step is to connect the iPod to your USB port, then
determine what Linux device the iPod is connected as:</p>

<pre>
# cat /proc/scsi/scsi
Attached devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
Vendor: Apple Model: iPod Rev: 1.50
Type: Direct-Access ANSI SCSI revision: 02
</pre>
<code>scsi0</code> means that iPod is connected to
<code>/dev/sda</code>, <code>scsi1</code> means that iPod is
connected to <code>/dev/sdb</code>, and so on. In this article,
I'll use <code>/dev/sda</code> as the default assumption;
obviously, you'll need to change it if your iPod uses a different
device.

<h3>Mounting and Unmounting Your iPod</h3>

<p>Now we can explore the iPod. For this, we need to mount it:</p>

<pre>
# mkdir /mnt/myIpodSongs
# mount -t vfat /dev/sda2 /mnt/myIpodSongs
</pre>
After mounting, the contents of the iPod can be browsed as a normal
file system.

<p>When we are done exploring, we need to unmount the iPod:</p>

<pre>
# umount /dev/sda2
</pre>

<h3>Copying and playing music</h3>

<p>Ok, this was neat, but what about playing some music? On Linux,
<code>gtkpod</code> can be used to copy and organize your music
into playlists. After installing <a href=
"http://www.gtkpod.org/">gtkpod</a>, the mount point of the iPod
can be specified from "Edit-&gt;Edit Preferences". Once the mount
point is added, <code>gtkpod</code> lets you create and modify
playlists, add or remove songs, and even export your Thunderbird or
Evolution data to the iPod.</p>

<h3>Podcasts</h3>

<p>Podcasts are radio-style shows for the iPod. Unlike streaming
audio, which requires you to listen in real time, podcasting lets
you control how and when you hear your favorite shows. Some of the
podcasting clients available on Linux are <a href=
"http://amarok.kde.org/">amaroK</a> and <a href=
"http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/">BashPodder</a>,
a command line utility to download podcasts.</p>

<h3>Installing Linux on the iPod</h3>

<p>Now that we know how to use iPod on Linux, it's time to use
Linux on an iPod. Why bother to install Linux on an iPod? Because
it includes loads of new games, a movie player, a voice recorder,
and the freedom to create new applications. For those who are brave
enough to explore this exciting option, <a href=
"http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page">iPodLinux</a> has a distribution
you can use; the first, second, and third generations of iPod are
officially supported.</p>

<p>After playing with the installer for a bit, I was able to
install iPodLinux on my 60GB Photo iPod. The port uses uClinux, a
Linux flavor designed for devices that lack a memory management
unit (MMU). While the iPod has some MMU-type capabilities, they are
not sufficient to support the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>Before installing Linux, it's a good idea to make a backup of
the iPod boot loader and OS, so they can be restored if something
goes wrong:</p>

<pre>
# dd if=/dev/sda of=ipod_boot_sector_backup count=1
# dd if=/dev/sda1 of=ipod_os_partition_backup
</pre>
After the backup is done, the next step is to create a new
partition on the iPod to hold the root file system for Linux.

<p>A partition can be created by using the following command:</p>

<pre>
# fdisk /dev/sda
</pre>
I created the following partitions on my 60GB iPod:

<pre>
Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System
/dev/sda1 * 1 1 8001 0 Empty
/dev/sda2 * 6 7296 58564957+ b W95 FAT32
/dev/sda3 2 5 32130 83 Linux
</pre>

<p>Once the partitioning is done, create a filesystem with an ext3
journal:</p>

<pre>
# mke2fs -j /dev/sda3
</pre>
and set the maximal mount count between two filesystem checks to
zero to prevent <code>fsck</code> being run on it:

<pre>
# tune2fs -c 0 /dev/sda3
</pre>

<p>To install the Linux kernel and the boot loader, download either
the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73079&amp;package_id=101451&amp;release_id=226112">
Official Boot loader</a> (for the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>,
and 3<sup>rd</sup> generation iPod) or the 4<sup>th</sup>
generation <a href=
"http://www.fivefiftyone.com/newsite/ipodbootloadercvs.tar.gz">photo
iPod</a> version. Also, download the <a href=
"http://www.ipodlinux.org/builds/">latest kernel</a> from the
nightly build. Extract the kernel and boot loader into a directory
of their own. Next, extract the Apple image from the boot loader
and create a new image including Linux and Apple OS (here, the
kernel is named uclinux-2.4.24-ipod2.bin):</p>

<pre>
# ./make_fw -3 -o apple_os.bin -e 0 ipod_os_partition_backup
# ./make_fw -3 -o my_sw.bin -i apple_os.bin -l uclinux-2.4.24-ipod2.bin loader.bin
</pre>
NOTE: -3 is required in make_fw only for 4<sup>th</sup> generation
iPods.

<p>Once this is done, we can copy the new image and kernel modules
to the iPod:</p>

<pre>
# dd if=my_sw.bin of=/dev/sda1
# mkdir /mnt/ipod
# mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 /mnt/ipod
# cp -r lib /mnt/ipod
# umount /mnt/ipod
</pre>

<p>For userland installation, I downloaded the 
<!-- 20051030 dsrich - Link broken, site times out --><a href=
"http://168.234.106.10/linuxos-2005-08-28-+extras.tar.bz2">iPodLinux
FS</a> and performed the following steps to install the
filesystem:</p>
Mount the iPod root partition:

<pre>
# mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 /mnt/ipod
</pre>
Extract the filesystem:

<pre>
# mkdir /mnt/linuxos
# mount -o loop floydzilla-2005-08-28-ipod+iboy+doom.img /mnt/linuxos
# cp /mnt/linuxos /mnt/ipod
</pre>
and finally, unmount the iPod partition:

<pre>
# umount /mnt/ipod
# umount /mnt/linuxos
# eject /dev/sda
</pre>
And we are done! But before you start playing Doom on iPod, it
needs to be rebooted.

<p>To reboot, disconnect your iPod from the USB port. If the iPod
did not automatically reboot, hold down the menu and the play
buttons for 3 seconds to reboot it. After rebooting, keep the back
button pressed to boot Linux, otherwise the default interface will
load.</p>

"360" height="480"> <img src="misc/nirendra/movie_player.jpg" alt=
"Movie player" width="480" height="360">
<h3>Programming your iPod</h3>

<p>The first thing required to compile "hello world" on an iPod
would, of course, be a new compiler. But why a <em>new</em>
compiler? because iPod has ARM processors and a cross-compiler is
required to compile programs for this architecture. Download the
compiler for uclinux from <a href=
"http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/arm-elf-tools/">http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/arm-elf-tools/</a>.</p>

<p>After the cross compiler is installed, the next thing to do
would be to write a 'hello iPod' program (save the following code
as <a href="misc/nirendra/hello.c.txt">hello.c</a>):</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void){ puts("Hello, iPod!"); return(0); }
</pre>

<p>Once done, compile the program:</p>

<pre>
# arm-elf-gcc -o hello hello.c -elf2flt
</pre>
copy the program to the iPod:

<pre>
# mount -t vfat /dev/sda2 /mnt/myIpodSongs
# mkdir /mnt/myIpodSongs/myprogs
# cp hello /mnt/myIpodSongs/myprogs
</pre>
and reboot the iPod after unmounting the partition:

<pre>
# cd $HOME
# eject /dev/sda
</pre>
After booting into floydzilla, goto "File browser-&gt;/mnt/myprogs"
and click on the "hello" to see output of the program on iPod.

<h1>Life With Unix</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/orr.html">Mike Orr (Sluggo)</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h3>

<p>This article started percolating when <a class="reference" href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/authors/adam.html">Thomas</a> asked:</p>

<blockquote>I'd really love to see an article of how Unix was used
in the past. Now, with PCs so cheap and popular, it's all the same
method. You don't often hear of people saying they're using a
dumb-terminal (unless they have an XDMCP server
running.)</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.linuxpakistan.net/man.php?query=terminfo&amp;apropos=0&amp;section=0&amp;type=2">
terminfo</a> database actually meant something back then. On the
other hand, the multiplicity of keyboard layouts led to the
infamous <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-5.html">backspace
problem</a> in Linux. (But it's <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/backspace.html">not just a Linux
problem</a>.) Anyway, here's how I found Unix, Linux, and Linux
Gazette. There's also a bit on the development of
internationalization (non-English support), and muse a bit on the
importance of history.</p>

<h3><a name="the-1980s-and-alphabet-soup" id=
"the-1980s-and-alphabet-soup">The 1980s and alphabet soup</a>
</h3>

<p>I started computing in junior high school, taking a BASIC class
on <a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/appleii.html">Apple II</a>'s (1980). A
fellow student's father had one at his office, so we met there on
Saturdays and wrote our first game, a shoot-the-bird thing. Soon
afterward my dad borrowed a <a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/trs80i.html">TRS-80</a> Model 1 Level 2
for me to play with. 16 KB RAM. A cassette interface that never
worked so I couldn't save programs. <a class="footnote-reference"
href="#cassette" id="id1" name="id1"><sup>1</sup></a> Instead I
left the computer on and put different programs in different number
ranges. (BASIC programs had mandatory line numbers.) I immediately
saw the computer's potential as a word processor, but neither model
had lowercase letters. The TRS-80's manual said there was a "hole"
in the video memory where the lower-case ASCII bit would have been.
I didn't understand why they left out something so fundamental.
Every month, <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/index/">Creative
Computing</a> magazine had sample programs and programming
contests. (Echoing later DRM controversies, the first issue
discussed a plot by the US Postal Service to regulate email.
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#email" id="id2" name=
"id2"><sup>2</sup></a>) Every microcomputer was incompatible; they
all had tradeoffs in their graphic capabilities and BASIC features.
(They were called microcomputers then. "PC" came from the later IBM
PC trademark.) I never saw a <a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/pet2001.html">PET</a>; I saw the <a class=
"reference" href="http://oldcomputers.net/atari400.html">Atari
400</a>, <a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/atari800.html">Atari 800</a>, <a class=
"reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/amiga1000.html">Amiga</a>, and an early
<a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/trs80pc1.html">palmtop</a> (TRS-80 Pocket
Computer) only in stores.</p>

<p>People couldn't afford computers so they played video games in
arcades. Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Defender/Stargate. I didn't
because I vowed, "One day I will have my own computer and I won't
have to put quarters into it." Then I got a computer and had so
much serious stuff I wanted to use it for that I didn't have the
patience to learn games. But I have to say, the best game was
<a class="reference" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_%28arcade_game%29">Defender</a>/<a class="reference"
href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(video_game)">Stargate</a>
because the spaceships would explode to the edges of the screen,
then later unexplode at the start of a new round.</p>

<p>In high school (1982) I convinced my dad to get an MTU (Micro
Technology Unlimited) computer after a rave review in a magazine.
[<a class="reference" href=
"http://1000bit.net/scheda.asp?id=1037">Picture</a>] It cost around
$3500, and had 64 KB RAM. The operating system was CODOS
("Channel-Oriented Disk Operating System"). By "channels" it meant
file descriptors, borrowed from Unix. It had programmable fonts,
sideways text in the graphics API, and GRIN ("GRaphic INput",
meaning you specified a pixel by moving a screen-wide crosshair
with the arrow keys). Neat toys, but ultimately not useful for
much. Eventually my dad sold it to his girlfriend, who did PR at
Microsoft in the early days. She loved the MTU and its word
processor, especially the function-key legends at the bottom of the
screen.</p>

<p>Then the IBM PC came out. Its BASIC had many more features than
any of the others. I'd go to the computer store and read the
manuals and imagine programming it. Then the Macintosh came out in
1984 and blew our socks off. A word processor that actually showed
you the fonts live onscreen. Cute little icons, draggable folders.
In college I borrowed time on my friends' Macs to write my papers.
My dad bought an IBM XT for work, but I didn't use it much until
later.</p>

<p>In 1987, my second year of college, I took two programming
classesi, both using Modula-2 on VAX/VMS mainframes. We wrote programs on
h19 terminals using an editor called h19. The boring terminals were
hardwired to one mainframe; the interesting terminals had a text
menu of computers you could log into. Dialing in from home you also
got the menu. I soon discovered email and phone (a split-screen
chat program). Those blew my mind; I immediately saw the power of
networking and databases. I could write to somebody in Iran and get
a reply in a few minutes. For the next several years I tried to
convince my dad to get an email account for his business, but he
never saw the point. Online services consisted of dozens of local
bulletin boards, <a class="reference" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe">CompuServe</a> and a few
others, and the BITNET the universities used. There were Internet
gateways between the mail networks by that point, but CompuServe
charged 10c/message for foreign email. There was one Unix computer
(blake) on the campus network, but nobody I knew used it. Unix was
just one more thing in the alphabet soup of systems.</p>

<p>In 1989 I graduated (in Speech Communication) and inherited my
dad's XT. He was selling medical insurance plans (or what are now
called medical savings accounts) to companies, and had me test the
proposal/administration program his programmer was writing (in
BASIC). He wanted to give away stacks of floppies with the proposal
program at banks as a way to recruit customers. The program gave a
rate quote for the client's company size and employee profile
(e.g., how many with children). Later he wanted it to compare our
rates with plans from the various insurance companies, to give the
public greater knowledge and choice. It would have been a perfect
application for the Web, but the Web didn't exist yet.</p>

<h3><a name="the-1990s-and-unix" id="the-1990s-and-unix">The 1990s
and Unix</a>
</h3>

<p>In 1990 the Mac Classic came out, the first cheap Macintosh at
$1090. My six-year dream of owning a Macintosh became a reality.
But the following summer I bought a huge book on AT&amp;T Unix and
thought it was the bomb. Everything that DOS did badly, Unix did
well. To practice Unix, I got a dialup shell at a bulletin board
running XENIX. It had Usenet via UUCP. In Usenet messages I heard
about this wonderful thing called FTP that was download heaven, but
you had to be directly on the Internet to use it. Only universities
and a few large companies had Internet access. So I connived to get
a job at the university, where I could use the labs and get paid
too, rather than me having to pay tuition. I got a filing job at
one company, which lead to a data entry job (using a horrible IBM
mainframe program that looked <em>so</em> primitive). Then a data
entry job opened up at the university, or rather at the large
hospital it's affiliated with.</p>

<p>I got a second book about Unix called <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0135366577/002-2540751-2964812?v=glance">
Life With Unix</a> (1989: Prentice Hall, out of print). It was a
humorous look at the Unix culture and philosophy, with lots of
interesting trivia. I'd recommend it if you can find it. This
article is titled "Life With Unix" in its honor.</p>

<p>I started that job in November 1991, and a week later learned
about Linux in a Usenet message. Talk about a Christmas present.
Linux was at version 0.6. There was a boot disk and a root disk,
but no user accounts. I wanted to run Linux so badly but I didn't
have a 386. My friend installed it, said you couldn't do much with
it, and erased it. The next year I sold my Mac for $150 and bought
a 486/66 for $2000.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the university, there was now a general student
computer, a Sequent/DYNIX (milton). Unix denizens used the cooler
DEC/Ultrix (hardy), a BSD variant, especially for CPU-intensive
compilation. There was also an AIX computer. The VAXen were still
online for the engineers. The h19 terminals had been replaced with
NCD X-terminals. I thought their high-resolution color screens were
a ridiculous waste of money. The terminals came with a built-in
window manager (Motif) and a menu to telnet into the
frequently-used hosts, each in an xterm window. This was the
University of Washington, so Pine was encouraged. Everybody read
their mail via telnet/Pine. But you could do xdm login to one of
the Unix machines and get a graphical login screen and twm. That's
what the cool people did. The tradeoff was it took more CPU time on
the host, so after eight hours you got nice'd and things slowed way
down. Most of what is now blogs and chatting and eBay was done on
Usenet. "The Net" meant the Usenet community. I'd go down Friday
evening to "read news" and get home Saturday afternoon. We didn't
really use the GUI at all except to set the background image and
run a clock. A few people played MUDs.</p>

<p>I put Linux on my shiny new PeeCee in 1992, first the MCC
Interim distribution, then Slackware. xfree86 wasn't stable yet and
I despaired it ever would be. I almost bought BSDI Unix which did
have an X-server, but the $1000 cost daunted me.</p>

<p>My hospital job went from data entry to database (FoxPro), and
then workstation support (Windoze). In 1995 I got a better PC which
I tried to put the new version of Slackware on, but it kept
segfaulting at random moments. I cursed Slackware and asked a colleague
which distribution was most reliable. He said, "Red Hat, because
they actually test their distribution." Red Hat had just come out;
it was the first commercial distribution. But I switched to Debian
instead because of its community development process; I planned to
become a developer. Later when I tried to compile a kernel, the
segfaults came back, and I finally traced them to bad memory. So it
wasn't Slackware's fault after all, but I had already switched.</p>

<p>I dreamed of getting a job using Linux. For years that was
unrealistic; everybody wanted Windows. By 1996 it was starting to
seem possible, then in 1997 it happened. I got a sysadmin/tech
support job at a small ISP, and installed Slackware on 386s to
function as wireless routers. The computers came from the Boeing
surplus store for $50 each. The ISP owner made a deal with "friends
in high places", giving them a free T-1 equivalent in exchange for
putting a microwave antenna on their roof and a router in their
attic. The other servers were a mixture of BSD (dns), HP-Apollo
(mail), and NT (ppp). I left after a couple months and returned a
year later (1998), and the 386's were <em>still</em> being used.
But there were some dozen dead ones. My job was to move parts
around to get some of them working. Some had pre-IDE drives, a
protocol called RLL, but Linux detected them just fine. :) Yet only
two or three computers were usable. So one glorious day I put ten
386's in the dumpster. The next day, the owner went to the Boeing
surplus and got ten more $50 computers. This time they were 486's
with more recent peripherals. Good for me; it meant they were more
reliable.</p>

<p>I learned at that company there's such a thing as being too
cheap. We sysadmins couldn't get the equipment we needed. The owner
was determined to squeeze the last bit of life out of the ancient
HP-Apollos with their esoteric Unix interface. The network was
practically held together by duct tape. My co-sysadmin said, "I can
hear the servers groaning at night and I'm worried." The dialin
server was NT. I wasn't sure I wanted to work for a company I
couldn't recommend to my friends, so I quit.</p>

<p>My programming hobby had gone from BASIC to C to Perl to Access
BASIC. Then Java appeared in 1997 and I believed the hype. But Sun
wouldn't release a JDK for Linux, and the third-party Blackdown
clone looked like it would always be a year behind Sun's version. I
learned about Python in a Java newsgroup, jumped ship and never
looked back. The more I used Python, the more I liked it, similar
to how I'd found Linux.</p>

<p>In 1999 I got a job at Linux Journal (SSC) as webmaster.
Marjorie Richardson was editing Linux Gazette, and it was taking
every last weekend of the month -- difficult when you have a
family. She gladly turned it over to me so she could "have her
weekends back". I knew about LG but had never read it much,
preferring to have my information indexed (everything in its place)
rather than random (as the 2-Cent Tips are). There was no Answer
Gang, just Jim the Answer Guy and Heather the Editor Gal. We formed
The Answer Gang to share the load, and later made the <a class=
"reference" href="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/kb.html">TAG
Knowledge Base</a> and improved the LG <a class="reference" href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/search.html">search engine</a>.</p>

<p>I started using KDE at SSC, since it was the office standard.
For work it's better to have everything you might need under the
menus, rather than scrounging around to find and install a program.
Eventually I switched from FVWM to KDE at home too.</p>

<h3><a name="the-2000s" id="the-2000s">The 2000s</a>
</h3>

<p>By 2000 the Linux bandwagon was in full swing and I heard all
about it as LG editor and overhearing the LJ editorial staff. If
you look at the News Bytes column in LG around 1998-2000, it was
full of press releases from companies. This was necessary in the
early years to promote Linux and help struggling companies, but
eventually I got tired of the marketroid hype. How can every
company be "the leading" one in its field? Then Dmitry Sklyarov got
jailed for writing a decryptor for Adobe's eBook format, and I
started putting political analysis in News Bytes (<a class=
"reference" href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/issue71/lg_bytes71.html">first
article</a>) and cutting out the press releases. Then Mick Conry
took over News Bytes and kept the focus on analysis and nonprofit
activities, also bringing a European perspective.</p>

<p>Seeing the press releases and LinuxWorld conferences burned me
out on the Linux advocacy role. Others were doing it; I didn't need
to anymore. Linux became just the environment I compute in, not a
crusade.</p>

<p>In March 2001 there was an article in the newspaper about
Microsoft not meeting its stock expectations. I considered it
minor; stock prices move up and down all the time. But incredibly,
it precipitated a selloff that became the dot-com crash. "Are these
investors idiots?" I thought. "First they buy stock way above the
companies' asset value, then they dump it on minor news."</p>

<p>In 2003 I was laid off from SSC. I wanted to get out of sysadmin
and take a break from programming. I thought about technical
writing. But then one Python job came up and then another, and I
couldn't turn those down since they're so fun.</p>

<p>Last summer I switched from Debian to Gentoo, which is what my
computer is running now.</p>

<h3><a name="internationalization" id=
"internationalization">Internationalization</a>
</h3>

<p>Internationalization was held back mainly by hardware. ASCII
(1967) predated microcomputers, but it took years to become fully
implemented on them. The Apple II had the most complete set,
including []|, which it flaunted in the computer's name (Apple ][)
and command prompt (]). But it did not have lowercase letters.</p>

<p>The TRS-80 had four arrows instead of []|. It also had no Ctrl
key, so you couldn't type control characters from the keyboard. You
had to use the CHR$(n) function to display them. A few characters
could be displayed only by POKE'ing them into video memory. The
high-bit characters were block graphics (a 2x3 grid with every
combination of "pixels" lit). The PSET command lit a certain
pseudo-pixel by mapping its x,y coordinate and its five neighbors
to a Tetris-like character. This trick allowed you to mix text and
graphics, which the Apple II didn't do except as a split screen.
The TRS-80 model II had a second character set, Japanese <a class=
"reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana">kana</a>.</p>

<p>The Apple II used the high bit for inverse video. Keyboard input
came in via a reserved memory location, and the high bit indicated
there was a new character waiting. So the high bit was "wasted",
not usable for distinct characters. (The Apple II also used
reserved memory locations for many other purposes. For instance if
you PEEK a certain address, it would switch video modes. Addresses
were signed 16-bit integers, so many reserved addresses were
negative. More trivia about <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.uni-giessen.de/faq/archiv/apple2.asoft/msg00000.html">Applesoft
BASIC</a> is in the FAQ.)</p>

<p>The IBM PC put western European characters in the high-bit
space, hooray! But to input them you had to hold down ALT and type
the numeric code, which meant you had to memorize them or carry a
chart around. As if! The <a class="reference" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">characters chosen</a>
were a seeming hodgepodge: OK for Spanish and German, lacking
capitals for some accented letters, and who uses a y-umlaut? This
character set conformed to no standard, making it useless for data
interchange or archiving except with other DOS PCs. When IBM and
Microsoft started marketing DOS in non-English speaking countries,
they created character sets ("code pages") for the local languages,
Macintosh had its own character sets, Russian had its own homegrown
KOI-8 character set, and there was also the international standard
(<a class="reference" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859">ISO-8859-n</a>). So it was
quite a mess.</p>

<p>But all these 8-bit character sets had a fatal flaw: you could
use only one language family in a document. Since all character
sets inherited ASCII you could mix English and French, or English
and Russian. But you couldn't mix Russian and French unless you
ASCII'fied one of them. Don't even think of making a Russian-Arabic
dictionary. And depending on hardware limitations, you could only
display one character set on the screen at a time anyway.</p>

<p>Unicode attempted to fix all these flaws by making a combined
character set covering all the world's alphabets. But software and
libraries had to be rewritten to recognize multi-byte characters.
This took years under Linux and is still not complete. You needed
Unicode fonts, libraries to encode data to UTF-8 (the
ASCII-friendly interchange format), standard labels for the
encodings, sorting algorithms, and Unicode-aware text editors. The
latter was the hardest part, especially if you had an affection for
an existing editor. The switch from console mode to X-windows was
also necessary, because the PC text console cannot use multibyte
character sets.</p>

<h3><a name="conclusion-the-value-of-history" id=
"conclusion-the-value-of-history">Conclusion: the value of
history</a>
</h3>

<p>It's always good to look back and see, not just what people did
but what their assumptions and goals were. I was born in 1966, and
grew up thinking the 1950s were the pinnacle of suburban
achievement, as homogeneous as <em>Leave It to Beaver</em>. Then I
read Philip K Dick, a postmodern author who belonged in the 60s
revolt but he was writing in the 50s. So the cracks in the American
dream were already apparent; people were just in massive denial.
Then you look at the physical layout of 50s houses. People were so
proud of their suburban houses with the latest convenience
appliances. But the houses were tiny: I visited a 2-bedroom house a
family grew up in, and it wasn't much bigger than my studio
apartment. One-car garages. Two electric outlets per room. (What do
you need to plug in besides a lamp?) Five TV channels, all black
and white. Phonograph records. Two radio dials: volume and tuning.
Yet a lot of people were very happy with all that; they thought it
was much better than before.</p>

<p>In the early 90s, Linux World Domination was just a farfetched
dream. We fretted about whether xfree86 would even run. Instead of
the Web there was the phone book. Life was slower. You mailed in a
resume (all nicely formatted on thick cream-color paper), got a
call on your answering machine, called back the next day. Now you
e-mail a text resume and if you don't answer your cell phone
immediately, the job goes to somebody else. These things happen so
gradually we don't realize how much we've changed, and we can't
even remember what we used to think.</p>

<p>The dot-com bubble was similarly seen as the pinnacle of the
technological boom. People read about Linux in the newspapers. You
had to have a .com after your name or you were nobody, even if you
were a hair salon or supermarket. Neighborhoods gentrified and
became boutiques. Then the crash came and things pulled back.
Domains expired. Apartments became affordable again (sort of). The
Linux hype vanished.</p>

<p>But Thomas Fridman argues in <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0374292884/qid=1127078140/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-2540751-2964812?v=glance&amp;s=books">
The World is Flat</a> that the greatest leap of computerization and
globalization actually happened after the crash. In spite of the
disillusion with online pet-food shopping. In spite of the
antiglobalization protests. Linux is no longer hyped, but it has
become commonplace. Companies know what Linux is, and they're more
willing to accept it if it gets things done. Linux has become
deeply rooted in governments, schools, and software engineers
outside the US. Much to the chagrin of SCO and Sun, Linux has
become the standard against which other Unixes are measured. If a
company ports software to Unix, it ports it to Linux first. That
is, if it didn't develop it in Linux in the first place. So there
is a lot happening behind the scenes now, it's just quieter.</p>

<p>David Keil's TRS-80 emulator for DOS comes complete with a
virtual cassette device. Its <a class="reference" href=
"http://discover-net.net/~dmkeil/trs80/trsdoc.htm#Operation-cassette">
manual page</a> is a total hoot. "Because the virtual cassette
works exactly like a real cassette it takes the same amount of time
to CSAVE a file in the emulator as it does on a real TRS-80. So
now, not only can you run cassette based programs with the emulator
you can also experience the incredible speed of cassette based
I/O." Tapes are stored as *.CAS files. The emulator has a baud-rate
control and motor on/off switch. To provide a more realistic
experience, the emulator does not force these to correct values;
instead it will happily read gibberish if you set the baud rate
wrong, or overwrite the next program if you forget to turn the
motor off. You can also connect a real tape recorder to your sound
card. And if you don't have a sound card, don't worry. You can save
the program to a WAV file, and load WAV-programs created by regular
sound utilities! I wonder what Barry Manilow's "Copacabana" would
do to a TRS-80?</p>

<p>"Two main views were heard [at the Electronic Mail &amp; Message
Conference], though there are several more. One was the idea that
electronic mail is in some sense a simple replacement of paper
mail, which the Post Office speakers seemed to think. The other
view sees 'electronic mail' as just one fact of the coming world of
transmissive computing in which a lucky few already live.... A
surprising political issue surfaced at the conference: the role
demanded by the U.S. Postal Service in a new world they claim to
understand but may not. What the Postal Service wants to do might
narrow and restrict what you can do in the future with your
computer. [<a class="reference" href=

<a name="Intro"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
This article describes how to build a Linux-based telephone
answering machine using a low cost winmodem (softmodem) for the
telephone interface. We describe how to install the drivers and
libraries, and how to select and install the proper modem card. Our
answering machine program is a couple of hundred lines of C code in
a single file. If you've ever used a telephone you should have no
trouble understanding the code.

<p>The requirements for the project are:<br>
 - An Intel 537-based modem (softmodem)<br>
 - A PCI slot that does not share interrupts</p>

<p>Intel 537-based modems are readily available for less than $10. The
driver we are going to use requires the Intel chip, so be sure you have the
right modem before starting.</p>


<a name="Arch"></a>
<h3>Architecture of a Linux Telephone Interface</h3>
<img src="misc/smith/zapata_arch.png" alt=
"Architecture of a Linux Telephone Application" hspace="10" vspace=
"10" border="2" align="right"> Our answering machine uses drivers
and libraries which are a part of the Asterisk open-source PBX.
Asterisk can work as an answering machine, but Asterisk is huge and
has a steep learning curve for installation and configuration. The
uncompressed Asterisk package is over 16 megabytes, well in excess
of our 5 kilobyte source file. The overall architecture of our
answering machine is shown in the attached diagram.

<p>The driver for the modem card is the wcfxo module. This
interfaces to a higher-level driver called "zaptel". The division
of the driver into two pieces helps the Asterisk developers
minimize how much code they need to write for new types of PC
telephony interface cards. The zaptel driver delivers a 64 Kbps
stream of <em>mu-law</em> samples to the user space application. Zaptel also
has IO control routines (IOCTLs) to go on-hook, off-hook, and to
indicate that the phone line is ringing.</p>

The Zapata library (libzap) processes the 64 Kbps stream of data to
extract caller ID and DTMF signals. The competence of libzap is why
our answering machine application is so simple.

<p>Our answering machine is pretty minimal as telephony
applications go. It extracts and displays the
caller ID information for incoming calls. If the phone rings more
than four times, it answers the phone and plays a greeting. The
greeting message asks the caller to press '1' to leave a message.
Having the caller press a button eliminates messages from so called
"bulk dialers". Voice mail is left as <em>mu-law</em>-encoded data in a file
with the date and time encoded into the file name.</p>


<a name="Installsw"></a><h3>Install Drivers and Libraries</h3>
<p>
Our answering machine requires the zaptel drivers and the Zapata
library, both of which are available from the <a
href="http://www.asterisk.org/">Asterisk web site</a>.
</p>


<h3>Installing the Drivers</h3>
<p>
Two drivers, wcfxo and zaptel, are required. Both are in the zaptel
package. You can get to the package from the Downloads link on the
Asterisk home page or you can get it directly from Digium which
hosts the download site.

<p><a href=
"http://ftp.digium.com/pub/zaptel/zaptel-1.0.9.2.tar.gz">http://ftp.digium.com/pub/zaptel/zaptel-1.0.9.2.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>Untar the file, do a 'make linux26' and a 'make install' (as
root). If you are using udev, be sure to follow the directions in
README.udev. Specifically, you need to add the following lines to
your /etc/udev/rules.d/50-udev.rules file:<br></p>

<pre>
<code>
KERNEL="zapctl",     NAME="zap/ctl"
KERNEL="zaptimer",   NAME="zap/timer"
KERNEL="zapchannel", NAME="zap/channel"
KERNEL="zappseudo",  NAME="zap/pseudo"
KERNEL="zap[0-9]*",  NAME="zap/%n"
</code>
</pre>

<p>I run the answering machine as myself so I've added the
following line to the udev permissions file
(/etc/udev/permissions.d/00-udev.permissions):</p>

<pre>zap/*:bobsmith:bobsmith:660</pre>

<p>The final piece of zaptel configuration is to tell it that we
have one interface to the telephone "central office". Edit
/etc/zaptel.conf and add the following line to the end:</p>

<pre>fxsks=1</pre>

<p>If you don't live in the US, you should should make one other
change to zaptel.conf. You need to uncomment the line with your
country code and make that country code the defaultzone.</p>


<h3>Installing the Zapata Library</h3>
<p>The Zapata library is no longer used by Asterisk, so it has been
relegated to the 'old' directory on the download site.
</p>

<p><a href=
"http://ftp.digium.com/pub/zaptel/old/zapata-0.9.1.tar.gz">http://ftp.digium.com/pub/zaptel/old/zapata-0.9.1.tar.gz</a></p>

<p>Untar the file, do a 'make' and a 'make install' (as root). The
Zapata library does not need any configuration.</p>


<a name="Installhw"></a><h3>Select and Install the Intel Modem</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, you need to be sure to get an Intel 537-compatible
modem. These modems should be easy to find and should be
relatively inexpensive.

<p>To call it a "modem" is not quite correct. It is really more of
a "phone line interface". Its 64Kbps stream is 8000 bytes per
second, which the wcfxo/zaptel driver delivers in 8 byte chunks.
This means a thousand interrupts per second! It is the interrupt
load that makes installing the modem card a little tricky. You need
to install it in a PCI slot with an interrupt that is <b>not</b>
shared by any other device. Check the documentation for your
motherboard to find which interrupts are used for which slots and
how those interrupts are used by the internal peripherals. If you
are very unlucky, you may find that the interrupt for every slot on
your motherboard is shared and used. You can try disabling internal
peripherals but wcfxo just won't work on some motherboards.</p>

<p>The other, less common problem is that the wcfxo driver does not
recognize your modem. To fix this you need to edit the
wcfxo_pci_tbl table near the bottom of wcfxo.c in the zaptel build
directory. Use 'lspci -nv' to get the needed vendor ID, product ID,
and subsystem ID. The following vendor, product, and subsystem IDs
are already recognized by wcfxo:</p>

<pre>
 - e159:0001 8085
 - e159:0001 8086
 - e159:0001 8087
</pre>

<h3>System Check-out</h3>
<p>If you've completed the hardware and software installation, you
can verify your system with a few commands. Install the modules and examine
the resulting syslog output.</p>

<pre>
<code>
#modprobe zaptel
#modprobe wcfxo
#tail /var/log/messages
Sep 18 23:30:41 kernel: Zapata Telephony Interface Registered on major 196
Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 0000:00:0b.0
Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel: PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 0000:00:07.5
Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel: wcfxo: DAA mode is 'FCC'
Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel: Found a Wildcard FXO: Generic Clone
Sep 18 23:30:51 kernel: Registered tone zone 0 (United States / North America)
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Don't worry about the "Sharing IRQ 5" log message. This reports
that the IRQ can be shared but does not imply that another Linux
device is using it.  An <code>lsmod</code> should show the following three
modules:</p>

<pre>
<code>
# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
wcfxo                  10848  0 
zaptel                185572  3 wcfxo
crc-ccitt               1664  1 zaptel
</code>
</pre>

<p>Verify that the wcfxo driver is generating a thousand interrupts
per second and that it is not shared with any other
devices:</p>

<pre>
<code>cat /proc/interrupts; sleep 10; cat /proc/interrupts</code>
</pre>

<p>The wcfxo entry in /proc/interrupts should be on a line by
itself, and the interrupt count should have gone up by ten thousand
during the above 10 second sleep. If wcfxo is not on a line by
itself, you need to move the modem to another PCI slot.
Specifically, you want something like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>5:   3003856        XT-PIC  wcfxo</code>
</pre>

<b>not</b> something like this:<br>

<pre>
<code>9:         0        XT-PIC  uhci_hcd, uhci_hcd, wcfxo</code>
</pre>

<p>The zaptel driver includes a utility to view the driver
configuration. Use it to verify that it has one interface. If this
fails, check the fxsks=1 line in the configuration file.<br></p>
<pre>
<code>
# ztcfg -v

Zaptel Configuration

</code>
</pre>


<h3>Installation and Use of the Answering Machine</h3>
<p>The code for the answering machine is in a single C file which is
available <a href="misc/smith/answering_machine.c">here</a>. Compile the
program with the command:</p>

<pre>
<code>gcc -lzap -o answering_machine answering_machine.c</code>
</pre>

<p>
Run the program with the command:</p>

<pre>
<code>./answering_machine</code>
</pre>

<p>The program expects to find an 8 KHz <em>mu-law</em>-encoded greeting
message called "leave_a_msg.ul" in the working directory. You can
record the greeting using any tool you like and then convert the
WAV file to <em>mu-law</em> using <tt>sox</tt>. The command is:</p>

<pre>
<code>sox leave_a_msg.wav leave_a_msg.ul</code>
</pre>

<p>Sox interprets files with the .ul extension as <em>mu-law</em>-encoded
audio at 8 KHz. You can hear your voice mail by using the
<tt>play</tt> command. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>play 2005_09_22_13_30_22.ul</code>
</pre>


<h3>Code Review of the Answering Machine</h3>
<p>The hard work in the answering machine is done by the Zapata
library. It does the caller ID, DTMF tone detection, and reads and
writes <em>mu-law</em> audio files. Here is the skeleton of the code in the
answering machine:</p>

<pre>
<code>
  zp = zap_open("/dev/zap/1", 0);

  while (1) {
    /* Wait for a ring and get caller ID info */
    zap_clid(zp, cidnumber, cidname);
    { Display caller ID to user.  Do logs or black list checking here. }

    /* Wait for an additional RINGS-1 rings before answering */
    zap_waitcall(zp, (RINGS - 1), ZAP_OFFHOOK, TM_OUT/1000);

    /* Tell Zapata that we want DTMF digits */
    zap_digitmode(zp, ZAP_DTMF) &amp;&amp; zap_clrdtmf(zp);

    /* Play our outgoing message.  Abort on DTMF or hang-up. */
    zap_playf(zp, "leave_a_msg.ul", ZAP_DTMFINT | ZAP_HOOKEXIT);
    { Continue if caller hung up }

    /* Wait up to TM_OUT ms for the caller to enter a DTMF digit */
    zap_getdtmf(zp, 1, (char *)0, 0, 0, TM_OUT, ZAP_HOOKEXIT);
    { Hang-up/continue if time-out and no DTMF digit. }

    /* Get the DTMF digit the caller entered.  Hang-up if wrong digit */
    pDigits = zap_dtmfbuf(zp);
    { Hang-up/continue if caller entered wrong digit }

    /* Save voice mail to 'date_time' file. */
    zap_recf(zp, date_time, 0, ZAP_BEEPTONE | ZAP_SILENCEINT);

    /* Done with message.  Hang-up and wait for next call. */
    zap_sethook(zp, ZAP_ONHOOK);
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The above code should give you a feel for how to write telephony
applications using the Zapata library. The library also has
routines that you can use to make outgoing calls and to help make
conference calls.</p>


<a name="Improvements"></a><h3>Next Steps...</h3>
<p>For a simple answering machine, this program works surprisingly
well. Its simplicity is its best feature.</p>

<p>If we were to add features to the answering machine, we would
probably add:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Remote access to voice mail</strong>: We should be able to retrieve our
voice mail over a phone line. Saving to a file at least gives us
some remote access. Still...</li>
<li><strong>Caller ID routing</strong>: The call would be routed based on the phone
number of the caller. Some callers would go directly to voice
mail.</li>
<li><strong>Capture outgoing calls</strong>: The answering machine should be able to
log the number dialed and duration of outgoing calls.</li>
<li><strong>In-Progress call recording</strong>: Wouldn't it be handy to be able to
press a button and have your current call recorded. This would be a
more reliable way to take notes during a call. Of course you'd want
to tell the other person that you are recording the call and you'd
want the machine to play a beep every 10 seconds or so.</li>
<li><strong>A web interface</strong>: It might be nice to have a web interface to
configure the answering machine. Something like the Run Time Access
library might help. (See <a href=
"http://www.runtimeaccess.com">http://www.runtimeaccess.com</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Email delivery of voice mail</strong>: We could convert the mu-law voice
mail files to WAV and have the voice mail emailed to us.</li>
<li><strong>Pager or message forwarding</strong>: Use libzap's ability to dial out
to tell a pager that there is a new message, or have the
application call your cell phone and play the voice mail.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Zapata library uses blocking IO, making it a little
difficult to use a <code>select()</code> loop to manage a user interface while
waiting for incoming calls. Perhaps a threaded application could
step around this problem.</p>

<h1>Using the GNU Compiler Collection</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/vinayak.html">Vinayak Hegde</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Introduction to GCC</h3>

<p>The GNU C compiler is an integral part of the GNU system and was
initially written by Richard Stallman. At first it only compiled C
code. Later a group of volunteers started maintaining it and GCC
gained the ability to support different languages such a C++,
Fortran, Ada and Java. It was then renamed to GNU Compiler
Collection to signify this change. In this article we shall look at
mainly the C language compiler.</p>

<p>GCC is not only available on Linux but also on other Unix-like
systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD,OpenBSD as well as on Windows via
Cygwin, MingW32 and Microsoft Services for Unix. It supports a wide
variety of platforms such as the Intel x86 Architecture, AMD x86-64
,Alpha and SPARC architectures. Due to this versatility of GCC, it
is often used for cross compiling code for different architectures.
Since the GCC source code is available and modular, it can easily
be modified to emit binaries for obscure or new platforms, such as
those used in embedded systems.</p>

<h1>Basic compilation options</h1>

<p>If GCC is available on your system, you can give the following
command to see with what options it has been compiled with.</p>
<b>Command 1 - GCC specification and supported functionality</b> 
<!--
     20051102 dsrich Commented out all occurrences of the WBR tag
     (tag is deprecated) but left them in their original places
  -->

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -v

</pre>

<p>This gives a lot of information about GCC. You can see that the
POSIX threading model is supported by this version so you can
compile multi-threaded applications with it. It can also compile
code written in C,C++,Fortran-77, Objective C, Java and Ada. Notice
that the C++ include path is also specified, and that Java code can
be compiled to native binaries with libgcj.</p>

<p>Let us write a <a href="misc/vinayak/helloworld.c.txt">small C
program</a> with a <a href="misc/vinayak/helloworld.h.txt">header
file</a> to see the various compilation options GCC supports.</p>

<pre class="code">
// helloworld.h
#define COUNT 2

static char hello[] = "hello world";
</pre>

<pre class="code">
// helloworld.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "helloworld.h"
 
int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i = 0;i &lt;= COUNT; i++)
    { 
        printf("%s - %d\n",hello,i);
    }
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>To compile the helloworld program to an object file we can give
the command</p>
<b>Command 2 - Creating an Object File</b>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -v -c helloworld.c

<pre class="code">

/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse<!-- WBR -->-linux/3.3.3/../../../crtn.o
</pre>

<p>From the above output, we can see that <code>gcc</code> calls
<code>cc1</code> which is the actual C compiler to generate a
assembler file called <code>ccHmbDAJ.s</code>. This is a randomly
chosen name and this file is deleted after compilation is over. You
can also see in what order the different include file paths are
searched. We can modify the search paths for the include files by
using the <code>-I</code> option and the library search paths by
using the <code>-L</code> option. See the info (<code>$ info
gcc</code>) pages for more information on these options. The
temporary assembler file created is then passed onto the GNU
assembler (<code>as</code>) which processes the file and generates
binary code for that particular platform. The process stops here
for the object file (command 1).</p>

<p>When creating a executable file an extra step is involved -
Linking. From the output of command 2 we can see that file is
dynamically linked with the libraries (note the usage of
<code>-L</code> option here as well). <code>collect2</code> is a
utility which sets up the initialization routines and eventually
calls ld to perform the linking to create the executable.</p>

<h3>The role of the Preprocessor</h3>

<p>The preprocessor is an important part of the C compiler. All the
preprocessor directives start with a '#' (hash) sign. It processes
the different preprocessor directives such as <code>#define</code>,
<code>#include,</code> <code>#ifdef</code>, <code>#pragma</code>
and <code>#undef</code>. As the name suggests, the preprocessor
runs before the compilation of the program begins and processes the
various directives to produce code ready to be compiled by the C
compiler. It is possible to define fairly complex macros using the
directives which can make the code more readable and reduce
complexity. But sometimes it is possible that the complex macros
are not getting expanded as we think they are. Also if some of the
include files have the same name, it is possible that the wrong
include file is getting picked up and causing compilation errors or
causing odd behavior in the executable. The <code>-E</code> option
can be used in such cases so that we can get the preprocessed
output as the compiler sees it. we can reuse the example above to
see the preprocessed output that the compiler produces.</p>
<b>Command 4 - Preprocessed output</b>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -E helloworld.c &gt; helloworld.c.preprocess
</pre>
<b>Command 5 - Expanded Macros (#define)</b>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -E helloworld.c -dM | sort | less
</pre>

<p>Command 4 will produce a large preprocessed file with all the
included files and all the expanded macros. You can open the file
in your favorite editor and take a look at it. This the C source
the C compiler looks at. When I ran the above command on my desktop
machine it produced 455 lines of output excluding whitespace.
Command 5 shows all the <code>#define</code>'d macros after sorting
them. It is also possible to define macros on the compilation
command line. For example see the output of Command 2 where
<code>__GNUC__</code>, <code>__GNUC_MINOR__</code> and
<code>__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__</code> are all defined as 3 as the GCC
version used for compilation is GCC 3.3.3</p>

<h3>Generating output in Assembly language</h3>

<p>GCC converts the C code into assembly language before converting
into binary code. In some instances you might want to look at the
code generated or tweak it for performance reasons before finally
converting into binary code. You can do it using the following
command.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -S helloworld.c
</pre>

<p>The output generated is as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
        .file   "helloworld.c"
        .data
        .type   hello, @object
        .size   hello, 12
hello:
        .string "hello world"
        .section        .rodata
.LC0:
        .string "%s - %d\n"
        .text
.globl main
        .type   main, @function
main:
        pushl   %ebp
        movl    %esp, %ebp
        subl    $8, %esp
        andl    $-16, %esp
        movl    $0, %eax
        subl    %eax, %esp
        movl    $0, -4(%ebp)
.L2:
        cmpl    $2, -4(%ebp)
        jle     .L5
        jmp     .L3
.L5:
        subl    $4, %esp
        pushl   -4(%ebp)
        pushl   $hello
        pushl   $.LC0
        call    printf
        addl    $16, %esp
        leal    -4(%ebp), %eax
        incl    (%eax)
        jmp     .L2
.L3:
        movl    $0, %eax
        leave
        ret
        .size   main, .-main
        .section        .note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
        .ident  "GCC: (GNU) 3.3.3 (SuSE Linux)"
</pre>

<p>From the output above, we can see that <code>hello</code> is
defined as the string "hello world". It is read-only data as we
have defined it as static. <code>main</code> is the only global
function. The <code>.LC0</code> section show the parameters for
<code>printf</code>. These are then pushed onto the stack before
printf is called in the main loop (<code>.L5</code>). The
<code>.L2</code> section has the code for checking the conditions
for the <code>for</code> loop. The <code>.L3</code> section
contains the cleanup routines after the function has exited. The
generated humanly-readable assembly language output can be changed
before being compiled into binary code by using <code>as</code>
(the GNU Assembler) and then linking it with the libraries.</p>

<h3>Conformance and warning options</h3>

<p>GCC has it's own extensions to the C standard. These extensions
are used by many GNU programs as well as other software including
the Linux kernel. These extensions may not be available with other
compilers on other platforms. So if you want to write portable
code, you might want to use the <code>-ansi</code> option. Using
this option along with -pedantic option will ensure that any code
that in no conforming to the ISO C standard will be flagged with a
warning. Also it is possible for us to specify what standard we
want to adhere to using the <code>-std=</code> option. Standards
supported by this option include the ISO C89 standard
(<code>-std=c89</code>), the more recent ISO C99 standard
(<code>-std=c99</code>) and the ISO C++98 standard
(<code>-std=c++98</code>).</p>

<p>Also it is always a good idea to turn some common warnings on,
using <code>-Wall</code> option. But <code>-Wall</code> does not
turn all warnings on. So it is a misnomer. Some of the other useful
and common warnings which you might want to enable are
<code>-Wstrict-prototypes</code> and
<code>-Wmissing-prototypes</code> (warning if prototypes are not
defined or defined improperly), <code>-Werror</code> (which turns
all warning into errors) and <code>-Wunreachable-code</code> (if
the compiler finds that a block of code will never execute).</p>

<h3>Generating Makefile dependencies</h3>

<p><code>make</code> is automated building tool which is used for
building large number of files in a C project. It will be covered
in a later article in this series. If you have (say) 1000 files in
a project, and you change just 1 or 2 files to fix a bug, you need
not build the whole project again. You can specify what files are
effected by the change by specifying dependencies and only those
files will be recompiled. You can use GCC to generate these
dependency lines. Take a look at the example below.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -M helloworld.c
helloworld.o: helloworld.c /usr/include/stdio.h /usr/include/features.h \
  /usr/include/sys/cdefs.h /usr/include/gnu/stubs.h \
  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse<!-- WBR -->-linux/3.3.3/include/stddef.h \
  /usr/include/bits/types.h /usr/include/bits/wordsize.h \
  /usr/include/bits/typesizes.h /usr/include/libio.h \
  /usr/include/_G_config.h /usr/include/wchar.h /usr/include/bits/wchar.h \
  /usr/include/gconv.h \
  /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-suse<!-- WBR -->-linux/3.3.3/include/stdarg.h \
  /usr/include/bits/stdio_lim.h /usr/include/bits/sys_errlist.h \
  helloworld.h
</pre>

<p>This nifty little trick can save a lot of time when you are
working against a stiff deadline.</p>

<h3>Using library code</h3>

<p>If you are developing a library for use by other programmers you
need to use the <code>-fpic</code> option to generate Position
Independent Code (PIC). When an executable is created certain
offsets of functions and data are hardcoded into it. For a library,
this is clearly not an option since library code has to be
independent of hardcoded location offsets - the library code will
eventually be linked into the executable (dynamically or
statically). Also if you have a component which needs to be linked
with multiple executables, you need to use the <code>-shared</code>
option of <code>gcc</code>. This option is used mostly along with
<code>-fpic</code> option to create shared libraries.</p>

<p>On most systems, the default behavior of gcc is to link
dynamically. This can create problems if you do not want to
distribute the shared library along with the executable. Also you
might be in a situation where the shared library you have used on
your system is not readily available. In such situation we can
statically link the executable so that the library code need not be
separately provided. But use this option with care as it will
increase the size of the executable by quite a bit. The command
option to statically link the output in gcc is (predictably)
<code>-static</code>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this article we have seen a small overview of how gcc can be
used to generate binaries and the various stages the C code goes
through before being converted into binary code. In the next part
in this series we will look at how the code generated can be
optimized for a particular platform as well as options to generate
debug binaries for use with gdb.</p>

It would be a rather nifty thing if you folks wanted to participate; I
find myself travelling a lot, but often forgetting who's where (I was
just in Chicago last week, and remembered, too late and with much
chagrin, that Chris G. lives there.) A visual reminder just might be a
handy thing for any of us who can't recall all the written info ("say,
wasn't there a pin somewhere around here?")

That's what I've been chuckling about from the start of this. The
Censores and the Latinists have taken on a hell of a load - essentially,
they'll be either qualifying or picking (in most cases, IMO, and perhaps
several times over) the names for every single person who joins NR. I'd
offer to write something that could do basic vetting, but I've got
better things to do.

And (at least in the Orthodox tradition), asking a saint to pray for you
is no different than asking anybody else to pray for you.  They are
merely peers whose devotion to God is widely recognized, and venerating
them is a traditional form of honor/respect.  As to how can the dead
pray for you, they are "conscious" and awaiting the judgement (viz.
Revelation under the throne, "How long must we wait?").  You can pray
for them as easily as they pray for you, although it's not traditionally
done.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As for "Who is a saint?", it's basically the people who knew them
treating them as such, and lobbying the officialdom to recognize it.

The answer is "effect".  Something that affects or effects causes an
effect.  Affect (noun) is a specialized term in psychology.  #3 says
this confusion goes back at least to the 1400s, and has an interactive quiz.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(#2 fails to note that effect (verb) is formalese.
"The temperature reversal <EM>effected</EM> a major slowdown in the bacterial
growth rate."
Normal people would say "caused" instead.
"The temperature reversal caused a hurricane.")
</STRONG></P>

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben] 
The distinction for me is that "effect" means "cause or accomplish",
whereas "affect" is "act upon or pretend". As well, "affect" as used by
psychologists isn't very different from one of the common meanings of
the word: "to affect an uncaring air" is to create an external
impression of an internal state. The major difference, as I see it, is
that the former is involuntary while the latter is consciously created;
otherwise, the meanings are similar.

Oh, come - there's a LOT more to hate about English than just _that._
Stupid pronunciations that have no relation to how the words are
written, that's my pet peeve. "Recipe"? "Queue"? "Though the tough cough
and hiccough plough him through"? Sheesh. Then there are the words that
are <em>  made  </em> to be mispeled: "wierd", "tounge", "beleive", and so on - and
words that damn near <em>  no one  </em> (noone?) can spell without staring at a
dictionary for a while (Mississippi, miscellaneous, Cincinnati,
extraordinary). And is it councillor or counselor or councilor? (The
answer is, of course, "yes".) Just insane. But for those of us who like
to play in the stuff, it's <EM>home</EM>.

I have some friends that work at an industrial/goth club called The Vogue,
and one day a promoter distributed some fliers that misspelled it The
Vouge.  We wondered how to pronounce that, then started calling it "The
Voozh" as a joke.

Polish is infamous for having words with lengthy blocks of consonants:

though 'y' <EM>is</EM> a vowel in Polish, that's still pretty scary.

Recently, I began using my box to connect directly (okay, it's dailup,
but as opposed to being behind NAT) to the internet. So, naturally, I
set up iptables to do NAT for the rest of the LAN and be fairly strict
about what it accepts. (Anything going out is okay, anything coming in
has to be ESTABLISHED or RELATED or else it's logged and dropped).

So when I started seeing weird UDP packets being dropped, I thought I
must have my DNS set up wrong or something, because it's highly unlikely
anybody's trying to get in to my system, right? Well, ulogd and tcpdump
tell this story: (IP addresses censored to protect the innocent)

I myself used to pick up very similar logs, and recently a family friend

from the ISP, (I setup the account) asking if I was aware of this
activity.  678 MALCIOUS objects later, and the machine was clean.

LWN writes about the broadcast flag's return from the dead (coming soon
to a legislator near you), and a similar initiative in Europe (Content
Protection and Copy Management: CPCM).  The new proposal would give the
FCC the authority to enforce the broadcast flag in TV-receiving devices
and on "digital networks".  This isn't quite the FCC "regulating the
Internet", but it's a step in that direction that could be exploited by
those who see the Internet as "one giant copying machine".

Open source developers should ignore Microsoft's so-called "success"

Linux will gain in mass appeal as Web applications (such as Ajax-style

traditional desktop applications that are compatible with Microsoft
Office and Windows. A bit more marketing would help as well!"

Footnote #3 is to an elaborate and very funny parody piece

Subject: Pascal's Wager and me

At the top of article &lt;pwgVe.7612$e96.5058@trndny09&gt;, which you crossposted
across alt.fan.bob-larson / alt.true-crime / misc.legal [1], you wrote:

   &gt; That's very nice, but what do you presume to say to God when you
   &gt; stand before Him at the Final Judgement?

   I will adopt Rick Moen's Strategy: "In the unlikely event of losing
   Pascal's Wager, I intend to saunter into Judgement Day with a bookshelf
   full of grievances, a flaming sword of my own devising, and a serious
   attitude problem." I'm guessing Ken will have a similar strategy.
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
I'm delighted to have given people ammunition in the eternal war against
idiocy.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But the astonishing thing is that it was absolutely an <em>  offhand  </em> remark
that I made one day in 1997 in -- of all places -- the Robert Jordan
SF/fantasy newsgroup (rec.arts.sf.written.robert-jordan).[2]
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
That newsgroup was and almost certainly still is an amazingly literate
and funny group of slightly cranky people[3], who use Robert Jordan's
logorrhoeic epic fantasy series as an excuse to shoot the breeze on
almost everything.  Almost.  We had the misfortune to suffer an invasion
of "witness-bearing" envoys from the Jesus Christ Church of Latter-Day
Saints -- who had somehow taken it upon themselves to straighten us out
about the Book of Mormon and their church's creative approach to
American paleo-history.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Their entrance and quest were entertaining for about five minutes, but
then they became repetitious, tedious, and insulting to everyone's
intelligence.  The regulars proceeded to have a field day taking apart
their archeology, their logical consistency, <em>  and their theology .</em>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I happened to be mopping them up over religious ethics, when I dropped
the quoted sentence as an afterthought.   (Mind you:  I have no problem with
people basing their ethics on religious principle.  I object only when
the outcome of that process is illogical, and especially if it is both
that <em>  and  </em> morally reprehensible.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
And, to my amazement, that sentence was immediately quoted... well...
just about everywhere, became the thing I was best known for, for
at least the following five years -- and keeps showing up.  Go figure.
