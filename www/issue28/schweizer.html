I was just reading <I>Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling
High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers</I> by Geoffry Moore and
sat back for a few minutes to muse on how Linux could benefit
from its strategies.
<P>
Mr Moore suggests that there is a bell curve that describes how a new 
technology is adapted by a market. At the front of the curve is a small
section of Innovators and next to it a slightly larger Early Adapter
section. After that there are two large sections at the middle of the curve, 
the Early Majority and then the Late Majority. Finally, there is a Laggards 
section.
<P>
The hypothisis is there is a 'chasm' between the way one markets to
the Innovators/Early Adapters and a completely different strategy for the 
Early Majority. It's my belief that Linux now has one foot out over the 
chasm, and companies that plan to market Linux or Linux related products
should examine their marketng strategies closely.
<P>
For Linux to be successful it must adopt a marketing strategy designed to 
'cross the chasm' between selling to Innovators/early adapters and an 
early majority of users.
<P>
Visionaries and early adapters are already singing the praises of Linux 
and of the Free Software movement. But there are big differences between
them and the people in mainstream corporate environments who make the 
buying decisions.
<P>
The early adapters differ greatly from the early majority in their 
buying habits - early majority buyers are pragmatists. They want to 
buy from market leaders with proven track records and from companies 
that adhere to industry standards. They want a high degree of customer
support, etc.
<P>
In the words of my brother, Paul, "This is just my opinion but, when 
I look at Linux from the standpoint of an MIS director, I see a cost 
nightmare.  I have no single source that is accountable for support 
issues.  I see a limited supply of qualified support engineers and 
technicians.  I see a limited supply of drivers for new hardware.  
And the list goes on...."  email Fri. Feb. 28, 1997
<P>
Pragmatists may not trust the visionaries in the inovator/early 
adapter market. They want references from within their own group - 
references that come from companies already using the product.
<P>
If you are in a start-up period, where do the references come from? 
One possible strategy is the 'Storming the Beach' approach. The 
visionaries have given you the base of operations (an island off the coast), 
and you have the goal of market domination (liberation of the continent.) 
What you do is establish yourself firmly in a market niche 
(The Beach) then throw all your marketing/sales efforts into 
expanding the market (moving off the beaches and into the country side.)
<P>
Where within the purchasing departments of large corporations is Linux's
Beach? Is it in the web server loaded with RedHat/Apache quietly
counting up hits day after day, week after week without any down time? 
Is it in the old Slackware box hiding in the corner providing print spooling
services without a large maintenance overhead? Is it in the new TurboLinux 
box running Samba?
<P>
"Reduction in scope is key to the chasm crossing strategy." If you want to 
dominate a market, you must first dominate one section of it. Does being
a web server utilize all of Linux's strenghts? No way! But it does get 
Linux noticed.
<P>
IMHO the talk about Linux needing an Office Suite is misguided. M$ Word and 
Excel are solidly entrenched. Linux jumping up and down shouting, "Me too!" 
is not going to get it noticed. 
<P>
What Linux needs is a well designed application profile. One thing
that Linux can focus on and use as a landing point. People use toasters,
coffee makers and refrigerators in the kitchen, but they don't combine 
them into one product and try to get Housing Inc. to sell it.
<P>
This one application needs to be a must-have, something that provides a 
dramatic competitive advantage and improved productivity in an area 
already well-understood by corporate America. To find this must-have 
product companies can use traditional macro- and microlevel market research.
<P>
Innovators and early adapters are interested in how all parts of 
Linux works. Mainstream customers aren't going to be. For them it's 
going to be more like buying a Christmas tree - as long as the good part
is showing, they're happy.
<P>
So, as the troops mass in the ports of our small island, have the Chiefs of
Staff found a landing point yet?
