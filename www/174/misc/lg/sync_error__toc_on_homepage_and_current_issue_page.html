Hello:
</p>

<p>
The contents for April on the homepage and on the issue page seem to
be out of sync: <a href='../../../173/index.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/173/index.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Hope, I am not seeing this in the middle of a update.
</p>

They look synced now, but I don't see my article
<a href='../../../173/saha.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/173/saha.html</a> on the ToC.

I guess you caught it just as I was uploading the new issue. That's
amazing split-second timing, there!

Right; it got moved to next month. I'm a "gestalt-driven" sort of
content editor: i.e., after all the proofreading and editing is done[1],
I look at the upcoming issue and decide on the most pleasing "shape" for
it - i.e., I look at how the articles fit together, and if they form any
sort of a relevant whole. If an article doesn't fit, or if (as was the
case here) we have enough articles for a good issue but are a bit short
of articles for the upcoming month, then I'll often move an article or
two into a "holding buffer", and pub them next month. Both your and
Neil Youngman's articles got shifted into that buffer this month.
</p>

<p>
[1] Speaking of which - I wrote a script a couple of years ago that
credits the proofers/editors who participate in a given issue on that
issue's index page, but even so, these folks don't get enough
recognition for what they do. Everybody, please welcome a (so far silent
but already active as a proofreader) new participant in TAG and the LG
proofing team, Aioanei Rares.
