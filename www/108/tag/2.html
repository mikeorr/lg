Dear Answer Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am using exim to deliver mail form my local host. I have a dynamic
IP address and am using zoneedit as my dns server. So mail to
my userID@my.domain is delivered straight to me. However I have trouble
sending mail to certain address as their ISPs/Postmasters have decided
to block emails originating from dynamic IP address to reduce spam.
For example AOL. I would be greatfull if you could suggest means to
solve this problem, short of paying for a static IP (which I don't
need but for this reason). Talking to my ISP (RoadRunner) has been
a waste of time.
</STRONG></P>

It's certainly possible. The Exim FAQ at
<A HREF="http://exim.org/exim-html-4.30/doc/html/FAQ_3.html"
	>http://exim.org/exim-html-4.30/doc/html/FAQ_3.html</A> has an example of setting
up routers to send local mail to hosts on the local network and everything
else to a smarthost. this should be easy to adapt to do what you want.

If all else fails read the documentation. The Exim documentation, though
large, is very informative. You just need to read it selectively and pick the
relevant chapters.

My second question is how to set up postmaster at my local host.
My current exim config accepts mail sent to postmaster@my.domain
however it does not accept mail to
<A HREF="mailto:postmaster@dhcp-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.columbus.rr.com"
	>postmaster@dhcp-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.columbus.rr.com</A>
which is my hostname assigned by my isp. The xxx being the ip
address which can change. Is there a way to make exim accept mail
sent to this email address such that the ip address (i.e.
in this case domain name) part is updated automatically.
</STRONG></P>

I don't know about getting it to update the address automatically, but you can
have it match a pattern like <A HREF="mailto:postmaster@dhcp"
	>postmaster@dhcp</A>-*.columbus.rr.com on the basis
that it's unlikely anyone else's postmaster mail will be directed to your IP.
Frankly I wonder who would send postmaster email to an address like that
anyway.

In the default exim 4 config this is accepted by the rules:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>  domainlist local_domains =@

  accept  local_parts   = postmaster
          domains       = +local_domains
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
According to the documentation '@' ... 'is a special form of entry which means
the name of the local host, so this should normally match, but I guess
your system is set up to use "my.domain" as the hostname, instead of the
RoadRunner host name.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As an alternative, it may be that adding dhcp-$interface_address.columbus.rr.com or some variation thereon to local-domains will achieve what you want. I have not tried this, so I can't be sure it will work. If you try it, be sure to let us know whether it
worked.
