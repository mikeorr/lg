<P>Internet is the big and wide world of infomation, which is really great,
but when one works on a limited Internet access, retrieving big amounts
of data may become a nigthmare. This is my particular case. I work at the
National Astronomic Observatory, Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Its
ethernet LAN is attached to a main ATM university's network backbone. However,
the external connection to the world goes through a 64K bandwidth channel
and that's a real problem when more than 500 users surf the net on day
time, for Internet velocity becomes offendly slow. Matter change when night
comes up and there is nobody at the campus, and so the transmition rate
grows to acceptable levels. Then, one can downloading easily big quantities
of information (for example, a whole Linux distribution). But as we are
mortal human beings, it's not very advisable to keep awake all nights working
at the computer. Then a solution arises: Program the computer so it works
when we sleep. Now the question is: How to program a Linux box to do that?
This is the reason I wrote this article.</P>

<P>On this writting I cover the concerning about ftp connections. I have
not worked yet on http connections, if you did so, please tell me.</P>

<P>At first sight, a solution comes up intuitively: Use the <TT>at</TT>
command to program an action at a given time. Let's remember how looks
a simple ftp session (in bold are the commands entered by user):</P>

<PRE>bash$ <B>ftp anyserver.anywhere.net
</B>Connected to anyserver.anywhere.net.
220 anyserver FTP server (Version wu-2.4(1) Tue Aug 8 15:50:43 CDT 1995) 
ready.
Name (anyserver:theuser): <B>anonymous
</B>331 Guest login ok, send your complete e-mail address as password.
Password:<B><I>(an e-mail address)
</I></B>230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp&gt; <B>cd pub
</B>ftp&gt; <B>bin
</B>ftp&gt; <B>get anyfile.tar.gz
</B>150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for anyfile.tar.gz (3217 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
3217 bytes received in 0.0402 secs (78 Kbytes/sec)
ftp&gt; <B>bye
</B>221 Goodbye.
bash$ 
</PRE>

<P>You can write a small shell script containing the steps that <TT>at</TT>
will execute. To manage the internal ftp commands into a shell script you
can use a shell syntax feature that permits to embed data that supposely
would come from the standard input into a script. This is called a &quot;here&quot;
document:</P>

<PRE>#! /bin/sh
echo This will use a &quot;here&quot; document to embed ftp commands in this script
# Begin of &quot;here&quot; document
ftp &lt;&lt;**
open anyserver.anywhere.net
anonymous
mymail@mailserver.net
cd pub
bin
get anyfile.tar.gz
bye
**
# End of &quot;here&quot; document
echo ftp transfer ended.</PRE>

<P>Note that all the data between the <TT>**</TT> strings are sended to
the ftp program as if it has been written by the user. So this script would
open a ftp connection to <TT>anyserver.anynet.net</TT>, loging as <TT>anonymous</TT>
with <TT>mymail@mailserver.net</TT> as password, will retrieve the <TT>anyfile.tar.gz</TT>
file located at the <TT>pub</TT> directory using binary transfer mode.
Theoretically this script looks okay, but on practice it won't work. Why?
Because the ftp program does not accept the username and password via a
&quot;here&quot; document; so in this case ftp will react with an &quot;Invalid
comand&quot; to <TT>anonymous</TT> and <TT>mymail@mailserver.net</TT> .
Obviously the ftp server will reject when no login and password data are
sended.</P>

<P>The tip to this lies in a hidden file that ftp uses called <TT>~/.netrc</TT>
; this must be located on the home directory. This file contains the information
required by ftp to login into a system, organized in tree text lines:</P>

<PRE>machine  anyserver.anynet.net
login    anonymous
password mymail@mailserver.net</PRE>

<P>In the case for private ftp connections, the<TT> password</TT> field
must have the concerning account password, instead an email as for anonymous
ftp. This may open a security hole, for this reason ftp will require that
the <TT>~/.netrc</TT> file lacks of read, write, and execute permission
to everybody, except the user. This is done easily using the <TT>chmod</TT>
command:</P>

<P><TT>chmod go-rwx .netrc</TT></P>

<P>Now, our shell script will look so:</P>

<PRE>#! /bin/sh
echo This will use a &quot;here&quot; document to embed ftp commands in this script
# Begin of &quot;here&quot; document
ftp &lt;&lt;**
open anyserver.anywhere.net
cd pub
bin
get anyfile.tar.gz
bye
**
# End of &quot;here&quot; document
echo ftp transfer ended.</PRE>

<P>ftp will extract the login and passwd information fron <TT>~/.netrc</TT>
and will realize the connection. Say we called this script <TT>getdata</TT>
(and made it executable with <TT>chmod ugo+x getdata</TT>), we can program
its execution at a given time so:</P>

<P><TT>bash$<B> at 1:00 am<BR>
getdata<BR>
(control-D)<BR>
</B>Job 70 will be executed using /bin/sh<BR>
bash$</TT></P>

<P>When you return at the morning, the requested data will be on your computer!</P>

<P>Another useful way to use this script is:</P>

<PRE>bash$ <B>nohup getdata &amp;
</B>[2] 131
bash$ nohup: appending output to 'nohup.out'
bash$ </PRE>

<P><TT>nohup</TT> permits that the process it executes (in this case <TT>getdata</TT>)
keeps runnig in spite of the user logouts. So you can work in anything
else while in the background a set of files are retrieved, or make logout
without kill the ftp children process.</P>

<P>In short you may follow these steps:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Put the server name, user (anonymous) and password information in the
<TT>~/.netrc</TT> file</LI>

<LI>Be sure that the ~/.netrc file permissions be <TT>rwx------</TT></LI>

<LI>Write a script with the template:<BR>
<TT>#! /bin/sh<BR>
ftp &lt;&lt;**<BR>
open</TT> (the ftp servername)<BR>
<BR>
(sequence of ftp commands...)<BR>
<BR>
<TT>bye<BR>
**</TT></LI>

<LI>Allow execute permission to the script:&nbsp;<TT>chmod ugp+x scriptname</TT></LI>

<LI>Program the execution time:<BR>
<TT>at 1:00 am<BR>
thescript<BR>
(control-D)</TT></LI>
</UL>

<P>And voil&aacute;. </P>

<P>Additionally you can add more features to the script, so it automatically
manages the updating of the <TT>~/.netrc</TT> file and generates a log
information file showing the time used:</P>

<PRE>#!/bin/sh

# Makes a backup of the old ~/.netrc file
cp $HOME/.netrc $HOME/netrc.bak

# Configures a new ~/.netrc
rm $HOME/.netrc
echo machine anyserver.anywhere.net &gt; $HOME/.netrc
echo login anonymous &gt;&gt; $HOME/.netrc
echo password mymail@mailserver.net &gt;&gt; $HOME/.netrc
chmod go-rwx $HOME/.netrc
echo scriptname log file &gt; scriptname.log
echo Begin conection at: &gt;&gt; scriptname.log
date &gt;&gt; scriptname.log
ftp -i&lt;&lt;**
open anyserver.anywhere.net
bin
cd pub
get afile.tar.gz
get bfile.tar.gz

bye
**
echo End conection at: &gt;&gt; scriptname.log
date &gt;&gt; scriptname.log
# End of scriptname script</PRE>

<P>To create by hand such script each time we need to download data may
be annoying. For this reason I have wrote a small <A HREF="izquierdo2.html">tcl/tk8.0
application</A> to generate a script under our needs.</P>

<P>You can find detailed information about the ftp command set in its respective
man page. </P>
