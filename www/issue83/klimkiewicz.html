<p>About three or four months ago I switched from Windows to Linux. I had
been using Linux before but it was only my second operating
system. When it became my primary one I had to deal with several
problems. Most of them I was able to fix quickly. There was one thing
which caused many troubles - I had three e-mail accounts.</p>

<p>Windows user could say, "Download some e-mail client and configure it
to use several accounts." But there is something called the 'Unix
philosophy'. It says that programmers should write small applications
which do only one thing but do it well. What does it mean for us? It
means that there is no single tool which fetches your mail from
remote server, allows you to read and write mail and sends it to its
target.</p>

<p>In this short article I will only show you how to configure tools
called <em>fetchmail</em> and <em>mutt</em>. If you
want to go deeper into this topic you should read:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mail-Administrator-HOWTO,</li>
<li>Mail-User-HOWTO.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can get them from <a
href="http://www.linuxdoc.org">http://www.linuxdoc.org</a>.</p>

<h2>1. Environment</h2>
<p>Let's define our e-mail environment: we have three e-mail accounts,
each placed on different server. We will call them 'First', 'Second'
and 'Third.' Their addresses are: first@firstdomain.com,
second@seconddomain.com, third@thirddomain.com. Moreover the first
account uses IMAP protocol and the others POP3.</p>

<p>The local user who is going to receive all the messages is called
'john'. We need to set new value for $MAIL environment variable, since
we won't use default '/var/spool/mail/john' (this is unsafe and less
convenient.) To do this we add following lines to .bash_profile (of
course if you use different shell you have to change different
things):</p>
<pre>
MAIL=$HOME/Mail/Inbox
export MAIL
</pre>

<p>(Don't forget to create directory '$HOME/Mail'!.)
We will also use additional mailboxes for read messages (each account
has its associated box.)</p>

<h2>2. Fetchmail</h2>
<p>Before we can read our mail we have to fetch it from remote server. To
do this we will use a tool called <b>fetchmail</b>. It should be
already installed on your system.</p>

<p>Configuring fetchmail is quite easy task. Moreover we can use utility
'fetchmailconf' which makes the process even easier.
Configuration file we should edit is <em>$HOME/.fetchmailrc</em>. Simple one,
appropriate for our environment, looks like this:</p>
<pre>
set postmaster "john"
set bouncemail
set properties ""
set daemon 300
poll First via firstdomain.com
 with proto IMAP
       user first there with password this_is_password is john here warnings 3600

poll Second via seconddomain.com
 with proto POP3
       user second there with password this_is_password is john here warnings 3600

poll Second via thirddomain.com
 with proto POP3
       user third there with password this_is_password is john here warnings 3600
</pre>

<p>To run fetchmail you only need to type <em>fetchmail</em>. It will be
started in daemon mode and will check whether there is new mail every
5 minutes.</p>

<h2>3. Mutt</h2>
<p>Our messages are on local machine now, so we can read them using
any Mail User Agent. I assume it is <em>mutt</em> because this article
is intended to deal with mutt.</p>

<p>Mutt needs to be configured before it can work like we want. First
of all we have to put some basic definitions in its configuration file
(it is usually called <em>$HOME/.muttrc</em>.) They can look like
this:</p>
<pre>
set mbox = "~/Mail/Inbox"
set move = no
set folder = "~/Mail"
set record = +Sent
mailboxes +Inbox +First +Second +Third
</pre>

<p>This actually allows us to read the messages but every outgoing
message will have something like <em>john@localhost</em> in its
<em>From</em> header field. We should be able to change the sender
address so the message can look like it was sent from
<em>firstdomain.com</em> or <em>seconddomain.com</em> or whatever
machine you have account on.</p>

<p>To achieve this we use additional mailboxes (First, Second and
Third) and mutt's so called <em>hooks</em> mechanism. The latter
executes user defined commands when some action is being
performed. There is <em>folder-hook</em> which is called when user
changes mail folder (by pressing 'c' key.) To change the <em>From</em>
field we need to modify <em>from</em> and <em>realname</em> mutt
variables:</p>
<pre>
# Default action:
folder-hook . set from = first@firstdomain.com
folder-hook . set realname = First
# First account:
folder-hook First set from = first@firstdomain.com
folder-hook First set realname = First
# Second account:
folder-hook Second set from = second@seconddomain.com
folder-hook Second set realname = Second
# Third account:
folder-hook Third set from = third@thirddomain.com
folder-hook Third set realname = Third
</pre>

<p>We should also define the <em>alternates</em> variable so mutt can
recognize messages sent to and by us:</p>
<pre>
set alternates = "first@firstdomain\.com|second@seconddomain\.com|third@thirddomain\.com"
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> There is a web tool called <em>MuttrcBuilder</em> at
<a href="http://mutt.netliberte.org">http://mutt.netliberte.org</a>
which you can use to configure your mutt.</p>
