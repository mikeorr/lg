<P>
The European Union directive on the patentability
of computer-implemented inventions has been 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/06/eu_bins_swpat/">
rejected by the European Parliament</a> by a large margin; the final
tally was 648 votes to 14, with 18 abstentions.
This high turnout came following 
intense lobbying on all sides in the run up to the
vote.
As 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/05/patent_directive/">
reported by The Register</a>, the directive seemed to
hemorrhage support as the vote approached.  The Pro-patent
camp became afraid that the anti-software patent amendments
might be reintroduced and given a second stamp of democratic
approval (the Commission could still shelve the whole thing,
but that could be politically difficult).  Meanwhile, the
anti-patent activists have been keen to kill this directive,
which they see as having been severely tainted by the
involvement of big (huge!) business pro-patent interests.
<P>
</P>
In the aftermath of this decision,
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/11/patent_reaction/">
both sides have tried to claim success</a>. The 
Commission, which had been pushing hard for software-patentability,
<a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/Cec050720En">
portrayed the vote as offering support for the current
status quo</a>, where software patents are being tacitly allowed
by the EPO.  However, the possibility of better enforcement
of current patent regulations regarding
software-patentability has been pointed to by 
<a href="http://wiki.ffii.org/Cpfh0507En">
a UK court decision to reject a software
patent</a>
on the basis of Article 52 of the EPC (European Patent
Convention).

<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/28/cisco_iss_sue_vuln_whistleblower/">
The recent behaviour of Cisco</a>
regarding the publication if a
flaw in its products has highlighted the ways in which legal
proceedings can be used to the detriment of individuals and
indeed the security of a community.  This story centres on
the decision of Michael Lynn, an employee of Internet
Security Systems, to publicly announce a flaw in Cisco's IOS
(Internet Operating System) software.  Lynn came to his
decision to go public after Cisco was notified of the
vulnerability, but had failed to remedy the fundamental
problem.  As Lynn has noted, the source-code to Cisco's IOS
has been stolen twice, so he felt there was a significant
chance that outside parties would soon be able to develop a
practical exploit unless measures were taken to force Cisco
to patch the flaw. 
<P>
</P>
When Cisco became aware of Lynn's decision to speak at the
<a href="http://www.blackhat.com/">Black Hat</a> Conference,
pressure was put on ISS, Lynn's employers, to prevent him
from going through with his presentation.  Lynn was also
personally threatened with legal action.  Following this
pressure, Lynn resigned from his position at ISS, but went
ahead with his presentation. 
</P>
<P>
The basis for Cisco's legal attack on Lynn was that he had
illegally obtained his information, as to do his research he
had violated the Cisco license agreement with regards to
reverse engineering.  Although in the immediate aftermath of
Lynn's presentation he was still being threatened with legal
action, 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/29/cisco_settles_rogue_researcher_dispute/">
a settlement has since been reached</a>.  The terms of this
include preventing Lynn from further using the Cisco code in
his possession for reverse engineering or security research,
and he is also forbidden from presenting his research on
this flaw again.  In the meantime, Michael Lynn is looking
for a new job.
