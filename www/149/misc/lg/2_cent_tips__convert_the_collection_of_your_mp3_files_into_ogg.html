<p>
First, why? Easy, because mp3 is patended format and ogg is open
source format. So, to guarantee your peace of mind (like what Cattano
said to Frank Lucas in "American Gangster" <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> ), use ogg.
</p>

<p>
To do it, first I assume you have mpg123 (<a href="http://www.mpg123.de/">http://www.mpg123.de/</a>)
installed and the binary is located in searchable path (check your
$PATH).
</p>

<p>
Your mp3 files probably contain spaces, so use this script:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
 
for b in *; do (  cd $b; for a in *; do mv -v "$a" $(echo $a | sed s/\
/\_/g); done ) ; done
</pre>

<p>
The script assumes your working directory has subdirectories that
holds the mp3 files (think of it as albums). Outer loop lists the
directories and inner loop "cd" into them and rename the files inside
so they don't contain spaces anymore.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the real piece of work:
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
 
for b in *;
do ( cd $b;
     for a in *;
            do test=$(echo $a | cut -f1 -d\.).wav ;
            mpg123 -v -w $test "$a";
            oggenc  $test ;
            rm -fv $test ;  rm -fv "$a" ;
     done );
done
</pre>

<p>
In short, the script loops over your collections. It uses mpg123 to
convert your mp3s into wavs. Then, oggenc converts it as ogg. The wav
is then deleted since we don't need it anymore. Why create wav 1st,
you might ask? Well, i tried to pipe mpg123 directly to oggenc but
somehow it didn't work (at least in my case), so that's my workaround.
</p>

If you want to loop over filenames that contain spaces without splitting
on those spaces, the easiest way is to tell Bash not to use spaces as a
delimiter. This is done via the $IFS (Internal Field Separator)
variable, which initially consists of a space, a tab, and a newline:
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ printf "$IFS"|od -ta
0000000  sp  ht  nl
0000003
</pre>

<p>
If you set the IFS, remember to restore it if your script is going to
continue after the loop:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# Save the IFS
old=$IFS
# Set the IFS to a hard-coded newline
IFS='
'
for n in *mp3
do
	# Doesn't matter much for 'echo', but it's a good idea to enclose
	# the filename in double-quotes; otherwise, other programs may get
	# confused about those spaces.
	echo "$n"
done
# Restore the IFS
IFS=$old
</pre>

<p>
Of course, if you're exiting the script at this point, then restoring
the IFS isn't necessary; the current definition will go away when the
current child process (the script) exits, and the definition from the
parent process will come into effect.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; The script assumes your working directory has subdirectories that
&gt; holds the mp3 files (think of it as albums). Outer loop lists the
&gt; directories and inner loop "cd" into them and rename the files inside
&gt; so they don't contain spaces anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally, the real piece of work:
&gt; #!/bin/bash
&gt; 
&gt; for b in *;
&gt; do ( cd $b;
&gt;      for a in *;
&gt;             do test=$(echo $a | cut -f1 -d\.).wav ;
&gt;             mpg123 -v -w $test "$a";
&gt;             oggenc  $test ;
&gt;             rm -fv $test ;  rm -fv "$a" ;
&gt;      done );
&gt; done
</pre>

<p>
Since you're using Bash, you could just use the parameter substitution
mechanism to modify the filenames instead of using 'cut'.
</p>

<pre>
mpg123 -v -w "${a%mp3}wav" "$a";
</pre>

<p>
This will remove 'mp3' from the end of the content in "$a", and replace
it with 'wav'. However, you should indeed be able to pipe the output of
the MP3 decoder into the input of the OGG encoder, since the latter is
significantly slower than the former.

&gt; In short, the script loops over your collections. It uses mpg123 to
&gt; convert your mp3s into wavs. Then, oggenc converts it as ogg. The wav

&gt; somehow it didn't work (at least in my case), so that's my workaround.
</pre>

<p>
The syntax can be a little tricky.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
...
for a in *mp3
do
	mpg123 -w - "$a" | oggenc - -o "${a%mp3}wav" &amp;&amp; \
done
...
</pre>

<p>
I'd also want to test the newly-created OGGs before discarding the MP3s.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
 
for n in *ogg
do
	# Play 10 seconds of the OGG
	ogg123 -K 10 "$a"
	printf "Delete \"${a%ogg}mp3\" [Yn]?"
	read answer
	if echo $ans|grep -iq '^y'
	then
		echo "Deleting ${a%ogg}mp3"
		rm "${a%ogg}mp3"
	fi
done
 
</pre>

Whoops - that would be 'read ans', of course. Or you could change the
next line to '$answer'.

Mulyadi, if you hadn't shared this tip, you wouldn't have had this
opportunity to improve your Bash knowledge. By doing so, you've also
given other people a) ideas about how to play with shell scripting and
b) a chance to learn a few tricks. This is precisely <strong>why</strong> tips need to
go to TAG rather than being directly submitted like articles: The Answer
Gang is where tips get sharpened, polished, and vetted for errors.
</p>

<p>
You have nothing to be sorry about, and no reason to feel stupid;
everything worked exactly as it was supposed to. "Stupid" would be
beating up on yourself when you've done everything right and achieved a
good result. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
