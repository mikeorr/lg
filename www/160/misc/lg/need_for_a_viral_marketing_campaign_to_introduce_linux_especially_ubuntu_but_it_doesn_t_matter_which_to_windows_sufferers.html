<p>
I am concerned that despite the Conficker affair, the message about using
   Ubuntu isn't getting through especially to industry commentators. So I
   wrote to Mark Shuttleworth.
</p>

<p>
   Dear Mark Shuttleworth,
</p>

<p>
                                Marketing Ubuntu
</p>

<p>
   I am still delighted with Ubuntu, and believe me after using computers for
   40 years, it's quite the best OS/package I've ever come across.
</p>

<p>
   But the message isn't getting out there. I became aware how bad it was
   when I did a single word Google News search for 'Conficker'.
</p>

<p>
   You and I know that if only we could get people to put Linux on their pcs
   their malware problems would vanish. But that message is not getting
   through.
</p>

<p>
   Here are the results:

<p>
   Survey: about 9.00 GMT 37 January 2009
</p>

<p>
   The standard article written on Conficker simply reports in bad news glee
   the spread of the epidemic. A small number 70-80 reports seem to tell you
   what to do in way of Microsoft repairs, though much of this is written
   from an arrogant point of view which says 'serve your right if you haven't
   patched'. The higher figure for Autorun (the Autorun turn-off question)
   probably reflects the dispute between Microsoft and US CERT about what to
   do.
</p>

<p>
   Linux hardly gets a look in, and some of those reports probably are
   falsely asserting that Linux machines are vulnerable too.
</p>

<p>
   If Linux is mentioned, it is only to assert that 'if you are lucky enough'
   to have a Linux machine you won't get hit.
</p>

<p>
   Disappointingly there are virtually no references to Conficker and Ubuntu
   and as few to WINE.
</p>

<p>
   Though I have tried to infect my machine by browsing dubious websites
   under WINE and Klamav has reported an infection, so I have disabled WINE
   for good.
</p>

<p>
   That's in News.
</p>

<p>
   Blogs are different. Not only are there 5 times as many entries in blogs
   as in news, (although the statistics are not quite as comparable as each
   blog entry is not counted separately), but blogs seem to mention security
   patches and the like more often than news articles. The Autorun question
   is relatively less important.
</p>

<p>
   Best of all, the ratio of blogs mentioning Linux (in relation to
   conficker) to news mentioning Linux is vastly different. Half the blogs
   do, while 0.6% of the news. Wine is more prominent, too, in blogs.
</p>

<p>
   In relation to Linux, Ubuntu has about 12% hits in both News and Blogs.
</p>

<p>
   The one major conclusion to this study is that 'the professionals' , the
   people who cover software as news, are not treating Linux and in our case
   Ubuntu sufficiently, or indeed at all.
</p>

<p>
   There are several reasons for this. Virtually all articles about Conficker
   are identical and I think reflect the same small number of PR outlets,
   Microsoft and the security industry being the worst source.
</p>

<p>
   Industry players in the Linux world have got to get together and get the
   message out. But that's not helpful to someone like me who hopes to see
   Linux take over the world, and especially Ubuntu, and would like to help
   that take-over happen.
</p>

<p>
   I think Ubuntu users who blog have got to try to become cleverer in how
   they interact with the internet.
</p>

<p>
   "Yah! Boo! Sucks! To your Windows virus, I'm safe behind Ubuntu," is
   unfortunately too often the attitude of too many Ubuntophiles. We need to
   get the large number of people contributing to blogs to contribute in more
   structured, helpful and effective ways.
</p>

<p>
   It's quite interesting that this is often only a matter of style.
   Contributors to Linux forums and Ubuntu's for the very great part make
   well written and above all helpful remarks, made politely and are very
   effective removing to the community much of the support work that either
   couldn't or wouldn't be paid for.
</p>

<p>
   But how to do it? I think we need to look for new techniques.
</p>

<p>
   Some ideas:
</p>

<p>
   The Ubuntu community should try and set some penetration targets. As a
   community it's quite good at setting targets and meeting them on a regular
   basis. Why not set as an initial target to get the same proportion of pcs
   using Ubuntu as Firefox in used.
</p>

<p>
   If I read the statistics correctly Firefox has achieved a 44% pentration
   whereas the several versions of Iexplore have 45%. This is much greater
   than the penetration of Linux or Windows into the pc market.
</p>

<p>
   If we could do that most of the battle would be won. Hardware
   manufacturers would perforce have to make their products Linux-operable.
</p>

<p>
   From the 'industry' point of view, I think it means some fairly sensible
   marketing, if only driving press releases to that small number of industry
   commentators.
</p>

<p>
   But the wider community can help. I suggest Ubuntu tries to set up a user
   driven viral marketing initiative, such as is used to promote films.
   Members of the initiative would be asked to place pro-Ubuntu statements in
   response to stories that either denigrate or more often simply ignore
   Linux, especially Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
   A website containing skeleton arguments as to why one should use Ubuntu
   should be set up, with arguments against such things as 'nobody uses
   Ubuntu', 'it'll get malware when its popular', and a 100 other myths. The
   object would be to make a clear and well argued case for using Ubuntu,
   showing how easy it is to install and use and how the software offerings
   are much greater than for Windows. Much must be made of is resistance to
   malware, and how is is quietly updated on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
   People on the whole should be invited to take part in this initiative as
   they will have to learn the basic rules of marketing, even if virally.
</p>

<p>
   Home users probably do not fear the patent risk, but it's there in some
   manager's minds.
</p>

<p>
   Perhaps the Linux suppliers should consider selling insurance against
   being sued for using the OS. Insurance should be cheap to get as the
   matter has essentially been declared dead by the Courts.
</p>

<p>
   With these few thoughts, I'll sign off, but I hope I've given Canonical
   something to think about.
</p>

<p>
   Yours sincerely
</p>

Frankly, there's nothing unusual about Conficker. Wind0ws has a long,
uninterrupted history of being vulnerable to exploits; Micr0s0ft's
approach has always been reactive (unavoidable, given their OS design) -
and the result of that is inevitable. 
</p>

<p>
Whoops - you just slipped yourself a mickey (I'm assuming your good faith
and not saying that you tried to slip one to anybody else.) "Setting
targets" is all well and good when it's a software project - i.e., all
the production factors are controllable once you have the required
brainshare. It is <strong>not</strong> all well and good when you're talking about a
marketing effort - a completely different situation, unrelated in fact
despite your identical description of it - because the "production"
factors are not nearly as controllable and require a completely
different approach.
</p>

<p>
But you see, we don't <em>need</em> any "viral" marketing, or any other cutesy
current buzzwords. The business world is proving to be rational in this
particular area, and Linux usage is booming. Consider the penetration of
Linux from the other end: seventeen years ago, it was nothing more than
a lone student's project. Five years after that, most people in the
computer industry knew about it; five years after <em>that,</em> many
businesses and a large number of individuals were running it. Today,
it's pretty much an article of faith in computing that Linux servers,
firewalls, etc. are the bulletproof solution; in fact, the default
pattern for network configuration today is "Linux on the outside,
Wind0ws on the inside" (I often hear this from people who administer
Micr0s0ft systems for a living.) 
</p>

<p>
Linux is expanding. Ubuntu, from my perspective, is one of the best of
the breed because they're sticking like glue to many of the original
values that made Open Source what it is. And while it's good to consider
the process and think about improving it, I doubt that we need any sort
of a "magic bullet" to "cure the problems" of Linux. That's not where we
are today; in fact, that's not a place where Linux has ever been.

You've got to admit... that last line is pretty amusing, given the

<p>
I think you're barking up the wrong tree, Charles. Mainly because you're
starting from the wrong end of the problem. 
</p>

<p>
As far as I can deduce - 
Most of us who are using Ubuntu are doing so for one of two reasons: a)
we're geeky types who poke at computers, and either came at it from
another distro, or from a definite choice about OS, or b) we have some
personal contact with a geeky type who suggested that we try Ubuntu, and
then was there to handhold (or simply take over) while we converted. 
Very, very few people are choosing on their own to convert based on
available information.
</p>

<p>
Why?
</p>

<p>
The average computer user out there has no inclination to <strong>choose</strong> an
OS. As far as they're concerned, hardware and operating systems are
still in lockstep the way it was back when - a Commodore runs Commodore
stuff, an Apple runs Apple stuff, PCs run DOS/Wind0ws stuff. It's like
knowing that their car runs on gas or diesel; why would they look for
alternate fuels? The computer is a magic box that does stuff, in the
same way that their car is a magic box that does stuff with the right
input. The average driver has very little idea of how their engine
works, but they don't need it in order to get from A to B, which is all
they want it to do. It takes a car geek to want to tweak performance,
and consider whether to put in another engine. If the average driver's
car has a completely non-functional engine, he's likely to take it to a
mechanic who'll replace it with something just like the factory
original, or just buy another car. He's not likely to say, "oh, I should
put a <strong>different</strong> engine in my car!" He didn't choose the engine in the
first place, it's not going to occur to him to choose now. And besides
which, he's used to having a warranty, and even though it's already
expired, he gains a lot of comfort from being part of the system.
</p>

<p>
But you say, "what about Firefox?" More like getting someone to change
the <strong>brand</strong> of gas they use. It's a small change, practically invisible.
Download the new app, stop using the old one. Go to gas station C
instead of D. Easy. Not like changing an engine.
</p>

<p>
So. Joe AverageComputerUser isn't looking at news reports to learn about
a better OS. Any news report suggesting that is likely to get glossed
over. Doing those news reports better won't do a darned thing to
increase Ubuntu use on individual desktops.
</p>

<p>
What will?
</p>

<p>
Changing OSes is <strong>work</strong>. The best way to make this happen is by making
the change as easy as possible. Bonus points for making it <strong>fun</strong>.  Going
back to Firefox as a comparison - one of their most successful actions
was turning the new Firefox download into a global attempt at
record-setting. How about a "Global Switch to Ubuntu Day" ? It needs a
catchier name, but if we organized all those InstallFests to happen on
one day, and made it the sort of half-crazy stunt that newswires love to
report, the sort of thing that becomes morning chatshow fodder, <strong>then</strong>
we have a lot of eyes and ears. Let's aim for a world record of most
"simultaneous" conversions to Ubuntu.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, I don't think it's that simple - people are going to miss
their old software, because most of them are rote users who have a hard
time switching from one version to another, nevermind a completely
different tool. I think we might do better with Global DualBoot day, so
people can get training wheels instead of being dumped into the deep end
of the swimming pool. 
</p>

<p>
Now, this is all hand-wave-y. There's a whole lot more to work out in
order to make something like this successful. But let's see if this is
worth working on. I think that starting from a better understanding of
Joe AverageComputerUser's stumbling block will get us to a more
effective solution than what we've had up to now.
