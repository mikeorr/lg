My assistant, Amy Kukuk, did all the work again this month.
She's so good to me. Thank you, Amy.

<P>
I'm going on vacation from July 3 to July 13, and I am truly looking
forward to it. I've been working much too hard since taking over as Editor
of <I>Linux Journal</I>, and a week or so with no work in my thoughts is
going to be a much needed break. Riley and I are flying to Southern
California to visit his dad--the esteemed UCLA Professor Emeritus, Dr.
Ralph Richardson. We also will be visiting my daughter Lara and her
children. Pictures of all my grandchildren are on my home page--they are, of
course, the most beautiful and most intelligent grandkids in the world. I
am very proud of them, as you can see.
<P> 
Have fun!
