<h3>Why read this article?</h3>

<p>It can be a little expensive to read analog signals, for example
temperature readings or light levels, into your computer. In this
article we will show you
(1) how Linux can use a computer parallel port and a $10 integrated
circuit to read 8 analog channels at 12 bit accuracy, and
(2) how we used this to build the Extreme Comfort System (ECS.)</p>

<p>Analog to digital conversion (ADC) can measure:</p>

<pre>
&bull; Temperature, using thermistors
&bull; Light intensity, using Light Dependent Resistors (LDR)
&bull; Pressure
</pre>

<p>We can use the acquired data for applications such as:</p>

<pre>
&bull; Data acquisition
&bull; Data logging
&bull; High-accuracy process control
</pre>

<p>The ECS project is an example of these applications.</p>

<h2>Interfacing Your Computer to an ADC via the Parallel Port</h2>

<p>Interfacing an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with Linux via
the parallel port is fairly simple. There two major areas that need
to be addressed - hardware and software. The hardware consists of
the parallel port, an ADC, and an analog signal source. The
software we programmed in 'C' language.</p>

<p>Below I have outlined three steps that explain how to develop
and integrate both components of this useful tool.</p>


<a name="Interfacing1.1" id="Interfacing1.1"></a>
<h3>1. Building a Basic ADC Circuit</h3>

<p>The first step is to build the hardware. As mentioned before our
hardware consists of the parallel port, an ADC, and a analog
source. For my project I used a MAX186 as the ADC and an NTC
Thermistor as the analog source. The MAX186 is a data-acquisition
system that combines an 8-channel multiplexer and a 12 bit ADC.
Refer to the <a href=
"http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1070/ln/en">MAX186
datasheet</a> for more information. NTC Thermistors (5MMDIA 47KR)
are readily available at <a href=
"http://www.jaycar.com.au">Jaycar</a> - CAT. NO. RN3442.</p>

<p class="editorial">(Editor's note: A similar thermistor with a
slightly different temperature coefficient from Digi-Key is

BC1487-ND</a> - Dave)<!-- For our US readers. --></p>

<p>Figure 1 below shows a simple circuit diagram that converts the
analog signal produced by the thermistor to a digital BCD signal,
which is read by the computer via the parallel port. Figure 2 shows
an example circuit I constructed using the circuit diagram in
Figure 1.</p>

Examples</a> section for the actual program to operate this
circuit.</p>

<h3>2. Reading from and Writing To the Parallel Port.</h3>

<p>Now that that hardware is built, it is time to develop the
software. However before you begin to write code or even start up
Linux you must gain access to the parallel port. Without this there
is no way you can read or write to the ADC. Refer to "Information
about the Parallel Port and SPI" in the <a href=
"#Appendix">Appendix</a> for a brief overview on the Parallel port
and how it communications to the ADC.</p>

<p>To gain access to the parallel port in Linux you have to setup
the BIOS to support the Simple Parallel Port mode, which
corresponds to the old Centronics standard. This is done by
selecting the SPP or Bidirectional mode in BIOS. With the BIOS set
we enable I/O using the lp_tty_start program, see the <a href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/112/radcliffe.html">&ldquo;Linux: A Clear
Winner for Hardware I/O&rdquo;</a> written by Peter Radcliffe.</p>

<p>In addition to running the lp_tty_start program, you also need
the following code snippets below. Both these code snippets are
used in my <a href="misc/chong/ADC_driver.c.txt">ADC_driver.c</a> code
example.</p>

<pre>
-------- lp_init() --------------------------------------------
 PURPOSE - given lp number 0-2, get lp base address,
           save registers, disable interrupts.
void lp_init(short lp_num)
 { switch ( lp_num)
    { case 2 : lp_base_addr = 0x3BC ; break ;
      case 1 : lp_base_addr = 0x278 ; break ;
      default: lp_base_addr = 0x378 ; break ;
    }
   image_data    = save_data    = inb( lp_base_addr) ;
   image_control = save_control = inb( lp_base_addr+2) ;
   outb( (image_control &amp;= 0xEF),  lp_base_addr + control_offset) ;
 }
---------------------------------------------------------------
--------- lp_restore() ----------------------------------------

 PURPOSE - restore lp port to previous state.

void lp_restore()
{  outb( save_data,    lp_base_addr) ;
   outb( save_control, lp_base_addr + control_offset) ;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<h6>source: &ldquo;Linux: A Clear Winner for Hardware I/O,&rdquo;
Peter Radcliffe</h6>

<p>Function <tt>lp_init()</tt> saves the current parallel port
state , including register values. <tt>lp_restore()</tt> restores
the parallel port to the previous state as saved by
<tt>lp_init()</tt>. Normally <tt>lp_init()</tt> would be run at the
beginning of <tt>main()</tt> and <tt>lp_restore()</tt> would be
used at the end. To read and write from the parallel port use
library functions 
<!-- Originally intb(), could not locate intb, but found inb() used -->
<tt>inb()</tt> and <tt>outb()</tt> from <tt>#include
asm/io.h</tt>.</p>

<p>To test a whether the I/O is working, write a simple program
that toggles the output on a pin on the parallel port and use a
multimeter or CRO to read the output. If the pin output toggles
correctly, then the I/O works.</p>

<h3>3. Communicating Between the ADC and the Parallel Port</h3>

<p>Once the circuit in Figure 1 is constructed and communication
between the parallel ports is established we can begin to program a
simple conversion. The file 'ADC_driver.c' (see <a href=
"#Code_examples">Code examples</a> below) contains the C code that
performs the conversions. However if you like to develop your own
software the following paragraphs briefly describe how to initiate
and read a conversion.</p>
<img src="misc/chong/timing_diagram.jpg" alt=
"Figure 3: Internal Clock Mode Timing">
<h5>Figure 3: Internal Clock Mode Timing</h5>
<img src="misc/chong/control_byte.jpg" alt=
"Table 2: Control Byte Configuration">
<h5>Table 2: Control Byte Configuration</h5>

<p>As shown in Figure 3, a conversion is initiated by clocking a
control byte into DIN. The format for the Control Byte is outlined
in the <a href=
"http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1070/ln/en">MAX186
datasheet</a>. For our purposes we will use the Control Byte
configuration outlined in Table 2.</p>

<p>Once the control byte is clocked in, the SSTRB will go low which
indicates the start of the conversion and then goes high when the
conversion is complete. After the SSTRB goes high, the next falling
clock edge will produce MSB of the conversion at DOUT, followed by
the remaining bits in the MSB-first format (refer to Figure 3). If
everything works correctly DOUT should clock out a 12 bit BCD which
corresponds to the voltage reading at the temperature sensor. To
convert the BCD to a decimal I used the following code snippet:</p>

<pre>
---------------------------------------------------------------
  int dec = 0;
  for(count=0; count&lt;=11; count++)
  {     dec = ((tempOut[11-count])*(twopowerof(count)))+dec;
  }
---------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
* tempOut[] is a 12 integer array which contains 12 bit BCD (where
tempOut[0] = MSB and tempOut[11] = LSB).

<p>If your DOUT outputs strange results, such as all zeros or
erratic readings, (I had these problems) check your circuit wiring
and make sure they follow the circuit diagram outlined in Figure 1.
If you still have problems you can use a CRO to check your parallel
port output to make sure they match the timing outlined in Figure
3.</p>

<h2>About the Extreme Comfort System</h2>

<p>My first encounter with Linux, parallel ports and ADCs occurred
during my 4th year at University. The project objective was to
interface to a piece of hardware via the parallel port. I decide to build an
<a href=
"http://www.users.bigpond.net.au/tmchong/ECS_webpage/index.html">
<!-- Previous link gives 404 error 29 August 2005 21:00 EDT -->Extreme
Comfort System</a> or <b>ECS</b> for our project. The idea for this
project occurred during one cold night at my computer desk when I
noticed my hands were freezing and my eyes were strained from the
poor lighting conditions. From this three main functions were
developed:</p>

<p><strong>1. Thermostat</strong> - Three temperature sensors
monitor the ambient temperature near the keyboard and a fan or
heater is activated depending on the user settings. A GUI interface
displays and controls the function of the thermostat.</p>

<p><strong>2. Automatic light Controller</strong> - A light sensor
monitors the light level near the keyboard and computer monitor and
a variable light source changes its intensity according to user
settings. A GUI interface displays and controls the functions on
the automatic light source.</p>

<p><strong>3. Data logger</strong> - All the readings from the
temperature and light sensors are stored into separate files with
statistical analysis. These files can be displayed on the GUI
interface.</p>

<p>To develop this project we used <a href=
"http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/designer.html">QT
designer</a> for the GUI development and the MAX186 for the ADC. We
only needed to use one ADC, which converted the analog voltage
signals from the temperature and light variable resistors to
digital signals. The circuit design was very similar to the ADC
circuit in Figure 1, except a bit more complex.</p>

<h3>Information about the Parallel Port and SPI</h3>

<p>The original IBM-PC's Parallel Printer Port had a total of 12
digital outputs and 5 digital inputs accessed via 3 consecutive
8-bit ports in the processor's I/O space.</p>
<img src="misc/chong/parallel_port_diagram.jpg" alt=
"25-way Female D-Type Connector " height="214">
<h5>25-pin Female D-Type Connector</h5>

<pre>
&bull; Pins 9-2 (D7-0) are output pins accessed via the DATA Port.
&bull; Pins 17, 16, 14, 1 (C3-0) are output pins, three inverted, accessed via the CONTROL Port.
&bull; Pins 10-13, 15 (S7-0) are input pins accessed via the STATUS Port.
&bull; The remaining pins (25-18) are grounded. 
</pre>

<p>The ADC communicates with the parallel port using the SPI
(Serial Peripheral Interface) 
<!-- Motorola's name, corrected from original text
"Serial Parallel Interface" --> protocol. SPI can be used to talk
to a whole range of integrated circuits such as EEPROMs and
microprocessors, so you may find the SPI part useful for other
projects. In our simple ADC-to-Parallel Port circuit, shown in
<a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a>, there are five wires connecting
the ADC to the parallel port. They include DIN, SCLK, DOUT, SSTRB,
and CS. Together they are used to to establish fast and flexible
communication. For more information about SPI refer to the <a href=
"http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1070/ln/en">MAX186
datasheet</a>.</p>
