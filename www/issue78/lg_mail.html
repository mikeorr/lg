Hi there
</P>
<P>
During development of a word processor in Oriya
language ** I faced the following problem.
</P>
<ul>
<li> Oriya is a local language of India
</ul>
<P>
The character coding of oriya lies between 128 to 255.
Also the keyboard mapping I need is different from the
default keyboard mapping that is US_English.For typing
and displaying those oriya character I need changing
some kind of keyboard mapping.Could you please suggest
any method available in GTK+/Gnome to change the
default keyboard mapping ( only inside the
application). I tried the same using
XChangeKeyboardMapping function. But it changed the
keyboard mapping for the entire session throughout all
applications.Is there any alternative to it ?
Anticipating a response from you.
</P>
<P>
Regards
<br>Girija

I just hooked this printer up yesterday. Overall, it prints fine with
one exception. At the end of a page, both lights start flashing. I
believe this means some sort of paper error, like a jam or something.
After each page I have to reset the printer. BUT, this is only 100%
reproducible when trying to print 2 or more pages. If printing a single
page, sometimes it errors and sometimes it doesn't. This same printer
worked fine connected to a MAC. The difference, beyond the obvious, is
the MAC was connected via USB and the linux machine is running it in
parallel. Any help appreciated since it's pretty annoying to have to
print a songle page at a time.

Hi
</P>
<P>
I am trying to get my pppoe client to work.I am on the debian
distribution version 2.2.18pre 21. I am using the roaringpenguin client.
there is a continues failure when i try to log in. The ppp0 interface come
up but I can not tell if the system is logged into a ppp server.
I typed to turn on the debugging on the pppd but the system writes some
garbage and nothing seems to happen. When the system try's
to fire up it trys a ppp connection down a serial line, where in the config
file the maps the ppp connection to the eth0 interface?
How is it possible to to tell if the system is logged into a ppp server?
When I run the pppconfig script I cant work out the 4 text parameters the
script is after, I only know the user name and password.
The PPPd program inherently deals with a serial modem, how do I configure
this to use my ethernet card?
</P>
<P>
My provider is Bigpond in Australia and they use pppoe for authentication.
</P>
<P>
My user name and password are both in the pap and chap secrets file, is
there any need to repeat these in the ppp options file
</P>
<P>
How can I manually debug a ppp session, can I enter all the ppp config
parameters by hand?
</P>
<P>
a snip of my sysylog is pasted below. Can you help - Im a real newbie!

<P><STRONG>
I've searched Google groups and various mailing lists and I've found
several people with the same problem as me, but no solutions to this.
I'm running XF86 4.1.0.1 on several <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> Woody xinerama 2 monitor
boxes (with several different combinations of video cards) and I can't
find a way to post a background image centered across both screens with
a single image.   I can get an image to center on the left monitor and
the right monitor has the same section of the graphic showing (the left
half) on the right side of the screen.
</STRONG></P>

This is the behavior with xv, xloadimage, feh, gnome control center,
gqview and other image viewers.  The odd thing is that for applications
that use transparency (gnome-terminal, xchat-gnome), the transparent
image is correct, so the transparent right screen has the correct
transparent image, but not the correct background image.  I can send a
screenshot showing this phenomena if you like.  Another odd behavior is
that small tiled images tile across the middle correctly (both
background and transparently).  My question is how do I make an image
center across both screens correctly like below?

Hi Matthew!
<br>I once had enlightenment set up as xinerama and managed to get what
you want: the image across both screens, and it was even with
different resolutions on the screens: 1024x768 and 1280x1024.
I managed to get it (IIRC) in the enlightenment background settings
menu, by wildly fiddling with the sliders that are up/down and on the
sides of the image in the upper part of the control window.
But that was enlightenment, dunno how to do it in the other wm's ...

Greetings, Chris; what's a "pivot functionality?"

		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> If you describe it, we
might know it. [Ben]
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You're not an old-time-enough-Mac guy, I suspect, to recognize the term
as generic, Ben: many current generation LCD panels, notably including
the Viewsonic's, will pivot on their center axis, becoming vertical.
</P>
<P>
Even hearing the signal from the panel, much less figuring out how to
remap everything to a new screen size, is likely a non trivial
problem...
</P>
<P>
A couple of quick Google searches didn't turn up anything suggestive...

<P>
Hello, Mike -
We exchanged a few e-mails last year re/ Linux news.  I'm wondering if you
can point me in the right direction.  How would I go about determining
which US-based Linux user groups are the largest, or the most influential?
Registries I'm finding online don't give me an idea of size.  Are there,
say, 5 or 10 groups that are known within the Linux community as being the
"biggies."
</P>
<P>
Thanks for your insight,
<br>Katherine Gill

Hi, Katherine.  I remember your name although I don't remember what we talked
about.  I don't know of any statistics on user group size.  BALUG
(<A HREF="http://www.balug.org"
	>http://www.balug.org</A>)in San Francisco and SVLUG (<A HREF="http://www.svlug.org"
	>http://www.svlug.org</A>) in
the Silicon Valley each used to get four hundred people per meeting as of a few
years ago, but I don't know about now.  Those two are pretty "influential" in
terms of offering services and being activists. (E.g., SVLUG threw the Silicon
Valley Tea Party (<A HREF="http://www.svlug.org/events/tea-party-199811.shtml"
	>http://www.svlug.org/events/tea-party-199811.shtml</A>) in honor
of the release of Windows 98 [wasn't that nice of them?], and crashed
Microsoft's big demo, "respectfully" wearing their penguin T-shirts and passing
out Linux CDs.)  But really, user groups in general don't influence Linux in
any way.  What they do is make Linux more accessible to their members.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Not sure where you're hoping to go with the statistics, but I question the
value of having them; without setting values on "influence" I wonder who
will care about the factoid, and your research efforts might have been
spent elsewhere.  Nonetheless I'll give it a poke.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">As an SVLUG member I can add some comments, mostly general.  At some time in
the past we had an ongoing list-bourne argument about who was "the largest
LUG in the world".  Members of two LUGs in entirely different parts of the
world started to claim this, approximately simultaneously.  Some of the grist
included the more detailed question, what kind of members did you want to
count?  Those who attend almost every meeting and regret when they can't make
it?  The sum of those who attended any time last year (knowing that "the
regulars" are of course duplicates)?  Average meeting attendance?  Oh but we
have these regular installfests too and nobody counts there 'cuz we're busy.
Oh but anybody on the general mailing list is really a member -- and boy, do
we have a lot of lurkers.   Then how did you want to count influence?  And
influencing who?
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">As some started to get bitter about it, 'twas noted that a fight on some
stupid label certainly wouldn't help the community at large, and both really
changed over to "one of the largest".  I forget who the other was;  they're
not in my region and I'm a busy soul, so I don't even recall if they were
also in the U.S.  Why?  Because it wasn't as important as us all getting on
with our Linux-y lives.  See my past editorial about "the coin of the realm."
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">In the world of Linux "influence" is not based on size, but on the aggregate
effort of individuals.  An occasional individual is "big" in the sense of
having an extra degree of talent -- and eventually heaps of extra respect,
built up slowly over time -- a factor my SF-convention running friends at
Baycon (www.baycon.com) call "people points".  Just being a plugger and
helping as one can can stack them up eventually too, though.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Do you mean "influential" like as in political efforts?  Heh.  Better to ask
the Electronic Frontier Foundation (www.eff.org) instead.  But they won't
know so much about the OS preferred by any individual member, as about the
bills that are out there planning to prey on every nerdly soul in the country
(and many who aren't as it starts taking toll on ability to use the internet).
Oh yes, SVLUG <EM>members</EM> have been involved in a few rallies here and there.
And I'd love to see a notable bloc of senators throw all their weight against
the SSSCA because "statistics show" that the amassed geeks of the Silicon
Valley are deadset against it.  (One of these statistics being California
among a limited batch of states that think Microsoft's "settlement" isn't
worth a bic pen.)  And the DMCA otherwise known as the "only big label
companies whose policy about their copyrights is You Sure Better Not are
allowed to protect theirs, you multitudes whose policy is My Grandma Recipes
Can Belong To Every Mom can go rot."  And so on.  There are hundreds of
poisonous little bills a year and the politicos simply don't even visit the
world we actually live in.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Well what the heck.  Maybe a "top ten" statistic would actually help.  Good
luck, and wish us some while you're at it.

Thanks for writing this exelent article, but i wonder i you can give me
any pointers to how to make X-window log in and autostart.
I use a debianized laptop, and having to log in every time i start up is
quite unnessesary.
I know mandrake has this option, but i cant find info on how its set up.

Hoping that if this is not the right place to ask, you could give me

the article is describing how to automatically login for textlogin. You can
easily place "startx" in your ~/.profile and so automatically launch X and
your standard window-manager.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For using that qlogin you probably will have to switch your debian system
from graphic login to text login.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another possibility: It is possible to run more then one X server at once,
you could let it start the normal login screen but at the same time run
qlogin to log in automatically and start it's own X server on a different
virtual console (like vt
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT="8)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">. If this happens later then the gdm (or whatever
debian is using for graphical login) it will switch there automatically.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[John Karns] 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Right you are - I forgot to consider the consequences of a ?dm boot
configuration.  The 'startx' approach indeed assumes a text-based console
boot configuration.

Hello,
</P>
<P>
I am not sure if you understand really the meaning of words:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
etiquette and
vulgar.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
The Linux Gazette should conform to the first meaning and so exclude everything from the second meaning. Please refer to etiquette book from the nearest library.
</P>
<P>
Your public answer should never go to people like this one:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
i just came across your website and was looking up bad clusters
also.i've seen some of your replies to theses people and you seem
pretty cocky. you sound like a total dick, like you dont have the time
to just be nice and say geesh im sorry but you have to look elsewhere.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
even if you want to personally "punish" him, even if he would be right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
It would be good behaviour if you simply correct those public pages and ban vulgar words.
</P>
<P>
Sincerely,
<br>Marko

I would just like to re-iterate the comments that Mike
Orr made in this e-mail by saying that the querent
(that's the person that sent that "abuse" e-mail to
us) never actually sent an e-mail to us, asking a
question that pertained to Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Indeed, many querents that e-mail us, don't actually
bother to <EM>really</EM> check to see <EM>who</EM> or they are
really asking their question to.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus, we get a lot of Windows questions that have no
relation to the subject matter contained within the
Linux Gazette.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I do not consider the replies to peoples' e-mails rude
in the least. Yes, harmless banter (Oh...hi Ben 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
does take place, but it is really only because the
querent has asked a really stupid question, or it is
because of the reasons already discussed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For example, I could be <EM>really</EM> picky, and say that
the phrase which you used:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
"Please refer to etiquette book from the nearest
library."
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
is nonsense. It is grammatically incorrect, since it
should read:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
"Please refer to ***an**** etiquette book from the
nearest library"
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
but who am I to complain???
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Should you have a question relating to Linux, then
please send it to the list.

<BR>touheed mohammad (<a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2078%5D%20gazette%20matters%20%231">tjcoo17 from hotmail.com</a>)

<P><STRONG>
Dear Sir/Madam
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would like to know from you answers of 2 Questions:
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Strictly speaking, these are publishing questions, not Linux questions,
but I cheerfully answer questions about LG itself anyway.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
Is 'Linux Gazette' is itself a Jouranal(professional)?
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">No.  It's a web zine produced by volunteers.
 -- Mike</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Linux Gazette is hosted by SSC.com, the internet site of
Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc, a professional publishing company
which publishes cheat cards, maybe some books, but definitely the standard
print magazines Linux Journal and Embedded Linux Journal.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Although mirrored in approx. 47 countries, carried in nearly every major
distribution of Linux on the planet, translated to multiple languages
monthly, and the license we use allows it, there is not to my knowledge
anybody publishing print editions of the Linux Gazette on a regular basis.
If you know of such please let us know and we will be glad to give them
a place of honor on the mirrors page:
	<A HREF="../mirrors.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/mirrors.html</A>
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">The staff and columnists of Linux Gazette are unpaid volunteers.  Other
than that we try to provide a high quality 'zine.  We have been published
monthly since... (she steps aside to check the Table of Contents) ...
Sepetember 96 (not all issues before that were monthly) and there have been
a few mid-month special issues.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Some of our staff have attended large shows in a professional capacity as
press.  You'd have to look back through our editorials for the references.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Linux Gazette is a part of the Linux Documentation Project, a worldwide
effort to provide usable documentation for many things one might want to
do with Linux.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
Is 'Linux Knowledge Portal' is a professional Joural?
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Hmm, hadn't heard of this one before;  Google! reveals:
	<A HREF="http://www.linux-knowledge-portal.org"
	>http://www.linux-knowledge-portal.org</A>
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">I hadn't heard of it ...  And since we <EM>do</EM> publish a
professional journal (Linux Journal), I asked LJ's Editor, and he hasn't
heard of it either.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">I did a Google search and discovered that
<A HREF="http://www.linux-knowledge-portal.org"
	>http://www.linux-knowledge-portal.org</A> exists.  It used to be the SuSE Linux
Knowledge Portal. If you want to know whether it's a professional journal,
why don't you ask them?  It also depends on what you mean by "professional
journal", and why you care.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">If you want to send an article, advertisement or press release to Linux
Journal, see <A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/contact.php"
	>http://www.linuxjournal.com/contact.php</A> .
 -- Mike</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">An interesting looking news site, a little ugly in lynx but definitely
usable.  Not hosted by SSC so our hosts couldn't say anything to its status.
I'm not involved with it myself, so what follows is merely my opinion.  I'm
good at having opinions on things 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":D"
                height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">It appears to depend heavily on automated retrievals from other sites which
produce news in the Linux world, freshmeat and slashdot for instance.  It
seems professionally maintained to <EM>me</EM> though this is purely a gut
reaction to usability at the site.  The "Help" button mentions that it
is themeable to your personal tastes if you let the site use cookies.
Too bad there's no About section.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">The question of whether a newspaper is a real newspaper if they have no
investigative reporters and only read AP/Reuters, is a philosophical one
beyond the scope of our site.  But if you find an answer to that question,
I'm sure the same answer applies here.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">It is, however, fitting the common definition of "Portal" to a T.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I would be grateful for your response.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Regards
Touheed
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Since I cannot determine your definition of "Journal" and "professional"
in this context, I can't tell if either of these answer your question.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">If your question is actually, "can I get paid for writing for Linux Gazette"
I'm afraid your answer is no.  Consider the Linux Journal instead.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">If your question is actually, "can I use getting published in Linux Gazette
as part of my Curriculum Vitae, resum&eacute; or to satisfy a publish-or-perish
imperative at my academic institution?" the answer is almost certainly yes.
You may want to consider our submission guidelines at:
	<A HREF="../faq/author.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html</A>
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Use of a spell checker would be advised.  The motto of our 'zine is "Making
Linux a little more fun!" and so writing in a style readable by a lot of
people is preferred.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">As for Linux Knowledge Portal, perhaps you should ask their webmaster.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Hope you found that interesting;  not sure if it's useful.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
