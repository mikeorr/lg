<h1>Away Mission for April 2011</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
There are quite a few April events of interest  to the Linux and Open
Source professional.  The menu includes hard-core Linux development,
Android, MySQL, system and network security, and cloud computing.
</p>


<h3>USENIX NSDI '11</h3>

<p>
NSDI '11 is actually March 30-April 1 in Boston.  It is co-located
with and preceeded by LEET '11,  the Large-Scale Exploits and Emergent
Threats  seminar.
</p>

<p>
NSDI '11 will focus on the design, implementation, and practical evaluation
of large-scale networked and distributed systems.  It is primarily a forum
for researchers and the papers presented there represent the leading
research on these topics. Of course, it starts before April 1st.   But it
is worth noting and, if you are in Boston, you might catch the end of it.
</p>

<p>
I attended LEET and NSDI in San Francisco 3 years back and was impressed
with the technical depth and the level of innovative thinking.  But I also
have to say that many of the presentations represent advanced grad student
work at leading universities.  Part of the conversation is about the
footnotes and several of the presentations are follow-ups to research
presented at earlier NSDI conferences or related events.  I can honestly
say that none of the presentations were duds but equally you couldn't split
your attention with email or twitter...  unless you were in that research
community.
</p> 

<p>
All of the papers are available after the conference and past papers from
past Symposia are available in the NSDI archive:

Here is the link to the abstracts for this year's NSDI:

<h3>Multiple Linux Foundation events</h3>

<p>
The Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit is in its 3rd year.  It has
always been a kind of family week for the extended community on the West
Coast, especially as several other major Linux events often occur in the
Boston area.
</p>  

<p>
The Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit is an invitation-only gathering
of folks like core kernel developers, distro maintainers, system vendors,
ISVs, and leaders of community organizations who gather for plenary
sessions and face-to-face workgroup meetings in order to tackle and solve
pressing issues facing Linux.  Keynote speakers include the CTO of Red Hat,
Brian Stevens, and the head of Watson Supercomputer Project, David
Ferrucci.
</p>

<p>
This year, because the merger of the Foundation with the CE Linux Forum
(CELF) in 2010, the Summit is followed by an updated Embedded Linux
Conference at the same San Francisco venue, allowing for down time between
events and lots of socializing.   Co-located with the 2011 Embedded Linux
Conference is the day and a half Android Builders Summit, beginning
mid-day Wednesday, April 13th and continuing on April 14th with a full day
of content.
</p>

<p>
The ELC conference, now in its 6th year, has the largest collection of
sessions dedicated exclusively to embedded Linux and embedded Linux
developers. CELF is now a workgroup of the Linux Foundation because the
principals believe that by combining resources they can better  enable the
adoption of Linux in the Consumer Electronics industry.
</p> 

<p>
You can use this link to register for both of the embedded Linux events:
<a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference/register">http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/embedded-linux-conference/register</a>
</p>

<p>
Also, Camp KDE is co-located with the Collaboration Summit and actually
precedes it on April 4-5.  So the festivities actually run from the 4th
until the 14th.
</p>  

<p>
There will be "Ask the Expert" open discussion forums on several technical
topics and Summit Conference sessions on the following key topics: Btrfs,
SystemTap, KVM Enterprise Development, File and Storage for Cloud Systems
and Device Mapper, Scaling with NFS and Tuning Systems for Low Latency.
</p>

<p>
An annual favorite at the Summit is the round table discussion on the Linux
Kernel.  Moderated by kernel developer Jon Corbet, the panel will address
the technology, the process and the future of Linux. Participants will
include James Bottomley, Distinguished Engineer at Novell's SUSE Labs and
Linux Kernel maintainer of the SCSI subsystem; Thomas Gleixner, main author
of the hrtimer subsystem; and Andrew Morton, co-maintainer of the Ext3
filesystem.  In previous Summits, this has been both lively and detailed.
</p>

<p>
Last year, the Collaboration Summit was where the partnership of Nokia,
Intel, and The Linux Foundation on MeeGo was announced.  I understand that
there should be more such announcements this year, especially as there is
now also a mini-Android conference at the end of the 2 week period.

<h3>InfoSec World 2011</h3>

<p>
InfoSec World will be taking place on April 19-21, 2011 in Orlando, FL. The
event features over 70 sessions, dozens of case studies, 9 tracks, 12
in-depth workshops, and 3 co-located summits. The last last of these
summits, the Secure Cloud &amp; Virtualization Summit, will take place on the
Friday after InfoSec.  It features a session on VMware Attacks and How to
Prevent Them.  This is a serious and professional security conference.
</p>

<p>
The opening keynote at InfoSec this year is "Cybersecurity Under Fire:
Government Mis-Steps and Private Sector Opportunities" by Roger W. Cressey,
counterterrorism analysmmmt and former pesidential advisor.
</p>  

<p>
I attended an InfoSec event in 2008 and found the level of presentations to
be excellent.  For instance, there was a detailed session on detecting and
exploiting stack overflows and another 2-part session with a deep dive on
Identity Management.
</p>

<p>
And their "Rock Star" Panel promised and delivered challenging opinions on
the then-hot information security topics.  In 2008, the panelists discussed
hardware hacking and included Greg Hoglund, CEO of the now more famous
HBGary, Inc. and founder of www.rootkit.com, and Fyodor Vaskovich, Creator
of Nmap and Insecure.org, among other notables.  (This is actually the
pseudonym of Gordon Lyon.)
</p>

<p>
My problem with prior security events hosted by MISTI is that it had been
very hard to get most of the presentation slides after the event and
nothing was available to link to for perspective attendees who might want
to sample the content - or to readers of our Away Mission column.  This
year the management at MISTI is aiming to do better.
</p>  

<p>
Among the sessions presented this year at InfoSec World, these specifically
will be accessible by the public after the conference - sort of the
opposite of RSA's preview mini sessions:
</p>

<ol>
<li> - Cloud Computing: Risks and Mitigation Strategies- Kevin Haynes
<li> - Computer Forensics, Fraud Detection and Investigations- Thomas Akin
<li> - Using the Internet as an Investigative Tool- Lance Hawk
<li> - Social Networking: How to Mitigate Your Organization's Risk- Brent Frampton
<li> - Securing Content in SharePoint: A Road Map- David Totten
<li> - Cloud and Virtualization Security Threats- Edward Haletky
<li> - Hacking and Securing the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch DEMO- Diana Kelley
<li> - Google Hacking: To Infinity and Beyond - A Tool Story DEMO- Francis Brow/ Rob Ragan
<li> - Penetration Testing in a Virtualized Environment DEMO- Tim Pierson
</ol>

<h3>MySQL User Conference</h3>

<p>
After Sun's purchase of MySQL a few years ago, and recently Oracle's
purchase of Sun, the bloom may be coming off the open source flower that
MySQL has been.  Many of the original developers are working on the fork of
MySQL that is Maria.  And O'Reilly has made it somewhat difficult for Linux
Gazette to attend this and other events that they host.  But there is still
a huge user base for MySQL and this is the annual user conference.
</p>

<p>
Last year's event  seemed a bit more compressed -- fewer tracks, fewer
rooms in the hotel adjacent to the SC Convention Center, fewer vendors in
the expo hall.  Also, in a sign of the depressed economy, there was no
breakfast in the mornings.   There were coffee and tea islands between the
session rooms, but the signature Euro breakfast at the MySQL conference was
missing, as were many of the Europeans.  This is now clearly an American
corporate event.
</p>

<p>
That being said, there were better conference survey prizes last year -- an
iPad or a free pass to MySQL 2011 -- and it still has a community presence
with BOFs from community projects.
</p>

<p>
Last year, conference organizers added an Open MySQL unconference room. This
was only one space and it seemed to be only lightly used. This year may be
different.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting change were the slides between sessions promoting other
sessions organized by show sponsors like Pentahoo and Kickfire, as well as
several sponsored by Oracle itself.  That seemed a bit heavy handed...
your mileage may vary.
</p>  

<p>
The actual presentations emphasized MySQL tuning and admin, plus sessions
on alternate DBs such as NoSQL, RethinkDB, Drizzle, and MariaDB (see
MariaDB: 20 Slides, 5 Minutes, The Full Monty by Michael Widenius). Here
is the OReilly link for materials from the 2010 MySQL conference:
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/proceedings">http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2010/public/schedule/proceedings</a>
</p>

<h3>CloudSlam '11</h3>

<p>
CloudSlam '11 is the 3rd annual CloudSlam conference, covering latest
trends and innovations in the world of cloud computing. Conference panels,
workshops, and tutorials will cover topics in cloud computing, including
public sector cloud initiatives, transitioning traditional IT resources
into the cloud, Cloud 2.0, Application Delivery, Private cloud / Public
cloud, and Greener Data Centers.
</p>

<p>
This is a hybrid global event: The first day, April 18th, is a physicial
conference, followed by 4 days of virtual conference.
</p> 

<p>
The $99 cost of the regular registration includes  access to all Cloud Slam
2011 live online sessions and downloadable conference proceedings plus
access to Cloud Slam '09 and Cloud Slam '10 downloadable conference
proceedings.  But some of the sponsors have sent out discount registration
codes.  The $299 VIP rate includes face time the first day at the Microsoft
Silicon Valley campus, should you want that.
</p>  

<p>
Online access to just the 2010 conference proceedings will set you back
$29.95  plus a $1.74 fee for eventbrite.com:
<a href="http://postcloudslam10.eventbrite.com/?ref=etckt">http://postcloudslam10.eventbrite.com/?ref=etckt</a>
</p>	

<p>
So attending  CloudSlam is a small investment,  both in time and  cash.	We
didn't  attend last year but this seems to be a  good value at low risk.
