<h2>About loopback devices</h2>
<p>You can think of a loopback device
as a filesystem <i>within</i> a filesystem.
It provides a convenient method
for working with a filesystem destined for
a small device like a floppy.</p>

<p>From the outside, the filesystem is
contained within a single file (often
gzipped to fit on a floppy).
This is often called an <b>image file</b>
since it contains a complete image of a filesystem.
When mounted, you can access it like any other
filesystem.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>The kernel requires loopback support.
You can compile support directly into the kernel,
or as a module.</p>
<p>You also need one or more <b>loop</b> devices.
BasicLinux provides four:
<b>/dev/loop0</b> through <b>/dev/loop3</b>.

<h3>Mounting a Loopback Device</h3>
<p>Mounting a loopback device is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>If loopback support is a separate module
on your system, load it (using <tt>insmod loop</tt>).</li>
<li>If the loopback filesystem is gzipped, unzip it.</li>
<li>Mount the filesystem:
<tt>mount -o loop filename /mnt</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>The filesystem looks exactly like a small disk partition,
including having a fixed size.
Treat it like any other filesystem.
When you unmount it, the image file
saves any changes you made to the filesystem.

<h3>Creating an Image File</h3>
<p>Creating an image is fairly simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create the file itself:
<tt>dd bs=1024 count=<b>blocks</b> if=/dev/zero of=<b>filename</b></tt>
<br>
Replace <b>blocks</b> with the desired size of the image
(in kilobytes) and <b>filename</b> with the name of the image file.</li>
<li>Make the file system:
<tt>mke2fs <b>filename</b></tt>
<br>
<b>mke2fs</b> confirms that you want to make the filesystem
on a non-block device before proceeding.</li>
<li>Mount the image file as described above and proceed.
</ol>
