<h3>Is "PING" the right tool to measure packet losses in WAN
interface ?</h3>
<p><b>Ramanathan Muthaiah [rus.cahimb at gmail.com]</b><br />
<b>Fri, 22 Dec 2006 06:09:23 +0530</b></p>
<p>Gang,</p>
<p>Recently, there were some discussions at my workplace regd
packet losses in WAN interface. And then, one folk in IT dept came
up with output of "ping" command to highlight that there are no
packet losses.</p>
<p>Am sure, this is not the correct way to measure packet
losses.</p>
<p>I feel, they should be monitored over a period of time at the
gateway router and the traffic in this router should be analysed
for dropped packets / timeouts.</p>
<p>Is this true ?</p>
<p>NOTE: Am not working in the IT dept but one of the affected
parties.</p>

<p>True enough. "ping" is/was a useful way to check that the link
is up and get a rough idea of round-trip times. That's it.</p>

</pre>
<p>In theory, the router itself should have on-board tools to
measure this - I can't think of anything else that would do the
job. The problem is that traffic on the WAN side is meaningless for
those purposes - you don't know what part of it is supposed to be
routed into the LAN - and the traffic on the LAN side doesn't tell
you anything, since you don't know how many packets were
<em>supposed</em> to get through. I've heard of traffic analyzers
(hardware) that are supposed to let you troubleshoot that kind of
problems, but they're supposed to be extremely expensive.</p>
<p>The best bet is to find out if your router has a telnet
interface (many of them do), log in, and snoop around. If it's got
an 'ifconfig' command, that might go a long way toward answering
your question.</p>

<p>I've also found that it can be used, with the '-f' option, to
stress-test a suspect 10Mb/S NIC (I've never tried it on a faster
network; _caveat geek._) "su -c 'ping -f hostname'" is a perfectly
lovely way to entertain yourself on a network full of crap
hardware, and a good way to produce reports that show
<strong>why</strong> you need new cards.</p>
<p>Ram, if you can convince your IT folks to OK it, you might want
to try this - do note that it'll probably DoS your router while you
run it. It's not a complete diagnostic - if it doesn't fail does
not mean that it's good - but if you get serious packet loss from
doing it, then there's most likely a problem. 30 seconds of
ping-flooding ought to be more than enough.</p>

<p>Ben, would using 'ping -f' on localhost produce any meaningful
results? I would like to stress-test NIC on my machine, I'd like to
see if it is responsible for (sometimes very high) packet loss.
Look at this 2 consecutive ping runs:</p>

If NIC is OK, next to check would be cable modem i.e coaxial cable
that goes from modem to NIC. Since I crimped that cable, and it is
with twist-on connectors, *it is* possible that it causes the
trouble. (sometimes, resetting the modem/reattaching the coax
helps). NIC uses via-rhine kernel driver(VIA Rhine PCI Fast
Ethernet driver). I didn't mean to hijack the thread, but this
somehow seems related ;)

<p>I'm afraid not; if you consider it in terms of the OSI 4-layer
model, the ICMP packets would be routed to 'lo' at layer #2, and
would never get as far as the hardware interface. You need an
actuall remote host to "talk" to so your packets can go out through
the NIC, onto the wire, and into the other NIC (and a short way
into the other host's stack, where it'll get ACKed.)</p>

<p>Your NIC is certainly a part of that chain, but I don't know
that it would be the first thing I'd suspect - there's probably a
fair amount of hardware between you and Yahoo. Have you tried
running 'traceroute' on those addresses? That can be nicely
instructive, in a bit of visual detail.</p>
<pre>
&gt; If NIC is OK, next to check would be cable modem i.e coaxial cable that goes from modem to NIC.
</pre>
<p>If you're going to go one step at a time, I'd first look at the
RJ-45 cable connecting the NIC to the modem (assuming that you've
already run the host-to-host test that we were just talking about.)
Having another system available would also allow you to definitely
determine whether everything up to the modem is OK or not: if
another host, with its own RJ-45 patch cable, is still flaky, then
it's somewhere between the modem and the end you're pinging.</p>
<p>The other advantage of 'traceroute' is you're going to see all
the bars and houses of ill repute that your packets are going to
visit before they get where they're going. You could ping each of
those IPs in turn (going from closest to most remote), and watch
the loss ratio. In most cases by far, though, the problem is local
- and it's usually either the patch cable from the modem to the
router (or host), or from the cable drop to the modem.</p>
<pre>
&gt; Since I crimped that cable, and it is with twist-on connectors, *it is* possible that it causes the trouble.

</pre>
<p>Oh <strong>yeah</strong>. If you made it yourself, and you're
not fairly experienced with RG-8 (or RG-6 which I prefer), it may
well be the source of the problem. As a former boss of mine, a lab
manager at Hughes Aircraft, had scrawled on the whiteboard for a
rather clueless MMW engineer (who had tried running an IF signal
via a piece of wire, and was wondering why it wasn't working),
"400MHz is <strong>NOT</strong> DC!"</p>

<p>RJ-45 cable came included with the modem(Motorola SB 5101E,

else, I think.</p>

<p>&lt;laugh&gt; Many engineers at my workplace are like that, they

<p>The right thing to do from there - assuming you suspect the
problem is somewhere upstream - is to ping each of the hosts along
the way and watch for losses. Again, though, chances are high that
your problem is local.</p>
<pre>
&gt; and ping:
&gt; ---
&gt; root@deus:/usr/ports/pedja/mathomatic#ping 213.137.109.129
&gt; PING 213.137.109.129 (213.137.109.129): 56 octets data

&gt; 13 packets transmitted, 13 packets received, 0% packet loss

</pre>
<p>Note that the primary problem isn't there anymore - all your
packets came back.</p>
<pre>
&gt; I'm not sure how to interpret traceroute output, though.
</pre>
<p>What I normally do is watch the display - if it shows '*' for an
intermediate host, either that host isn't answering or the packets
are being lost. In any case, the most useful part of it is being
able to see that chain of hosts: you can now ping them in turn and
see where the loss starts.</p>
<pre>
&gt; RJ-45 cable came included with the modem(Motorola SB 5101E, btw), 
&gt; and I tried another cable/modem combination, same thing happens, so it's 
&gt; rather safe to conclude that problem is something else, I think.  
</pre>
<p>Agreed. Although one time I got surprised by <em>two</em> bad
cables in a row, and oh <strong>brother</strong> did that frustrate
the hell out of me! (Also had a similar experience with two bad
NICs.)</p>
<p>So, assuming that your patch cable is good, it's down to the
modem, the coax, the jack, or the upstream cable/plant. I'd focus
on the first two.</p>

<p>I got religion about crimping tools a long time ago, and Paladin
and Klein share the godhead. There are a few lesser deities out
there as well (I used a Ziotek, which has a mildly sucky stripper,
for ~1000 RJ-45 connections, and it did a pretty good job), but
those two always work - even with dicey connectors.</p>

<p>We had a fellow at Hughes - can't rememer his name now, but a
very sweet and friendly Chinese MMW scientist - whom I caught one
day while he was trying to jam an SMP connector into a E-band
waveguide, <strong>grinding</strong> away at the job vigorously and
looking puzzled at their failure to fit (E-band WG has a
rectangular hole about 1/8"x1/16"; an SMP connector is ~5/8"
diameter hex nut.) I took it away from him - he had managed to
grind off the gold plating on both; the waveguide, at least, would
have to be replated, and the solid coax would have to be remade -
and explained that</p>
<pre>
1) Waveguides carry the RF.
2) Coax carries the IF/modulation (so far, so good - he was nodding
        along.)
3) To get the IF signal off the RF carrier, you needed a <strong>pickup</strong> - i.e.,
        a Gunn or an IMPATT diode mounted in a waveguide with a coax takeoff.
        He <strong>knew</strong> this intellectually, but had somehow failed to connect the
        books with physical reality.
</pre>
I then took a pickup from a stack of them *on his desk*, 6" away
from his elbow; got him another, non-destroyed piece of waveguide;
bolted the whole thing up with the 10-24 machine screws and nuts -
of which he had a bin, same as there was on every desk in that lab
- and hooked it up to the power meter. He was effusively grateful,
and promised to remember the process from then on.
<p>Brilliant MMW designer, by the way, and excellent at estimating,
"by feel", the size of a resistive waveguide insert for a given dB
drop (which is Deep Black Magick, I assure you.) He got sniped by a
headhunter from TRW later, and last I heard - mid-90s - was making
over 200 big ones a year.</p>

<p>[grin] Always happy to assist with the bits that I know; I'm
getting the same thing in exchange, and figure that to be a more
than fair deal.</p>
