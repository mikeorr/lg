      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Could you tell us about your carreer,
        professional abilities, etc.?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart</b>

      I've been a radio presenter and journalist for 3 years since
      I left the University (I graduated in translation). I'm 25
      years old and I live in Brussels, Capital of Europe. My
      computer skills wouldn't sound very exciting. I've actually
      been very interested in the Linux and Open Source movement
      for three years. Honestly I use two different OS on my home
      computer, ie Linux and MacOS X.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What were the main reasons that brought about
        the extinction of Linux Today French Version?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      Advertising revenues have been very low since the beginning
      of the year. Internet.com will now only focus on profitable
      sites. International editions of their Linux and Open Source
      sites are no longer profitable. The decision was expected but
      it came as a surprise since LinuxToday Fr was only 9 months
      old.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How many people were involved on the website?
        How do they react to the extinction?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      I was the only "journalist" to work on LinuxToday French. A
      daily press review and about 5 articles a week were my main
      "mission" on the site. A student helped me with the press
      review when I was on vacation. Technical issues were in the
      hands of Scott COURTNEY and Paul FERRIS (the "father" of
      LinuxToday), both working for the Linux &amp; Open Source
      Channel of internet.com, in the USA.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What were the most significant differences
        between the english version and the french version of 1 
        today?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      While the English edition only focused on a press review,
      adding features from time to time, the French edition offered
      a press review and daily articles. These articles were also
      posted on the popular France.Internet.Com, that supported us
      since Version 2, launched in January.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Could you expect that French Linux Today wiould
        be successful so quickly?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      I was actually very surprised to see how successful the site
      became in a couple of months only. Companies and Linux users
      soon became addicted. To me, the French audience was really
      in need of some kind of professional (-looking) news site
      about Linux and Open Source. The success of the English
      edition also helped us reach a wider audience : indeed, the
      "LinuxToday" brand is a reference. It may be the reason why
      the popular Linux Mandrake French site decided to display our
      news on their homepage.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Did internet.com influence in your productivity
        and in your editorial board?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      Never! Kevin REICHARD (Executive Editor, Internet Technology
      and Linux/Open Source Channels) trusted me.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Despite you have received a bunch of e-mails
        concerning the disapperance of fr.linuxtoday.com, did you
        believe for a moment that internet.com could change their
        mind?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      No, not really. I expected them to "transfer" Linux and Open
      Source properties to their official French site,
      france.internet.com. But times are bad for those
      international editions, as well. If Yahoo keeps telling that
      the advertising model will undoubtedly prove profitable in
      the future it's still not.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Do you think that economic crisis which also
        involves open source enterprises will be reflected in Linux
        and open source news sites?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      Of course. The Linux market is not mature yet. These are bad
      times for the whole IT economy. Only a limited number of
      companies focusing on Linux and Open Source solutions may
      claim to be profitable. Time will tell.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How many page views LinuxToday french version
        have had per month? And how many stories did you publish
        every day?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      Pageviews must remain confidential, I'm sorry... Every day, I
      could find about 15 articles for the press review and at
      least one real article. It took me a couple of months to find
      reliable sources to make a comprehensive press review.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: If internet.com choose for keeping the site's
        archives, and they invite you to continue working on it,
        would you accept or not? Why?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      We can dream! I don't think they would ever do it.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Taking into consideration the widespread
        adoption of Linux worldwide, do you think Linux is a
        adequate solution when we talk about economic advantages
        for governments and institutions?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      I don't really agree with "widespread adoption" of Linux.
      Linux stands for 5 % of today's desktop market. Only a very
      limited number of people actually use it as their primary OS.
      The vast majority keep using Windows, because most people
      don't really care about rebooting their machine from time to
      time. Linux must remain a professional OS. Only MacOS X may
      claim to be a REALLY consumer-oriented Unix. Economical
      assets for governments and institutions, as well as the
      availability of source codes, are indeed a key factor for the
      adoption of Linux in the public sector. You've certainly
      heard that the French government recently announced their
      decision to support Open Source technologies.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What does a Linux news site must have? Could you
        tell us some tips that you learn while french 1  today
        editor?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      1/ Stay focused but keep on other OS (Windows / MacOS X and
      BeOS); 2/ Avoid grammar and syntax errors; 3/ Keep distant
      from stupid OS wars (Windows sucks), leave it only to fat old
      geeks or newbies using Outlook Express to post messages on
      Linux forums ; and 4/ Never show any preference for any
      company.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Can you send a message to OLinux users?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>C&eacute;dric Godart:</b>

      Yes, of course. Sorry for not replying in Portuguese. I was
      actually very surprised when I received your request for an
      interview. I didn't know a French site, located in Europe,
      could ever interest people living thousands of miles away! My
      message : use Linux because you love it, not because it
      sounds fashionable and never use the word "WindBlows" if you
      send your messages using Outlook Express.</p>
