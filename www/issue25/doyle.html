<H2>Review of "A Practical Guide to Linux" by Mark Sobell</H2>

<P> <HR> <P>  

Several months ago, with some trepidation and the assistance of a friend who is
somewhat more knowledgeable than myself about computer hardware, I took the 
plunge and installed Linux on my Pentium PC.
<p>
Soon after, I downloaded a pile of assorted How-To's, FAQS and Tutorials from
the Internet to  start doing something useful with Linux. The downloaded 
documentation was handy but I frequently had trouble finding answers to
important 
questions. After a month I purchased 2 books - Running Linux by Welsh &
Kaufman and
A Practical Guide to Linux by Mark Sobell. Welsh & Kaufman's Book is a well
known, 
highly regarded, authoritative book on Linux. It is fundamentally about how
to set 
up the major Systems and Hardware and how they interact. 
<p>
Sobell's book, by way of contrast, approaches Linux from a software perspective.
There is little, if any, overlap between the two books, even when they are
talking 
about the same thing. The two books effectively work opposite sides of the Linux
street. There is also a contrast in the styles of the two books. Welsh and
Kaufman
are somewhat "chatty" while Sobell basically tells it like it is with little
or no
opinion thrown in.
<p>
Although there is a chapter on System Administration, Sobell's book
concentrates on
showing how to use the Linux variants of the standard Unix software
packages. There
are chapters on  X-Windows, vi, emacs, Linux Internet and Networking
Software, bash 
(2 chapters on this important subject), the TC Shell, the Z Shell and
Programming 
Tools.
<p>
Learning the bash Shell by Cameron Newham and Bill Rosenblatt (published by
O'Reilly)
covers the use of bash in more detail than Sobell's book, but I suspect it
is a little 
advanced for the beginner. Sobell's chapters on bash were the most
informative and useful 
information that I have come across so far. Being something of a
scripting/batch 
file afficianado the two chapters on bash provided just the information I
needed 
to produce a host of useful custom scripts.
<p>
The Command Summary takes up about a third of the book and maintains the high 
standards of the rest of the text. Sobell uses internal page references quite 
freely. This often results in a lot of page turning. I assume this was done
to avoid 
repetition of material, and given the vast amount of material that could be
included 
in a book on Linux/Unix software this is a reasonable compromise as it
leaves more 
room for additional material.
<p>
This is not a book for solving Linux hardware or installation problems. If
you are 
looking for that sort of information then get Welsh and Kaufman's book, or
download 
the relevant "How-Tos" (or both). This is the book to use if you want to do
learn how 
to do useful things with the software. The book manages to cover almost all
the major
software topics, and it covers them well.
<p>
I do  have some quibbles with the book. The Table of Contents uses a
typeface that 
is much too large, As a result it runs from page xvii to page xlvii. (That's
31 pages 
for the Roman numerally challenged) Hopefully, the next edition will address
this 
issue.
<p>
One notable Linux/Unix Utility not mentioned at all is Perl. A short 5-6 page
reference to it in the Linux Utility Program Section or an Appendix would
have been
nice. Summarising Perl in 5-6 pages is possibly a tall order, but I would have 
liked some mention or reference to it.
<p>
Although the book gives a good rundown on accessing Linux Documentation and
Software
from the Internet, a Bibliography of Linux/Unix books would have been good.
"Running 
Linux" does have a Bibliography, so if you have that book as well then I
guess you
have the information anyway (although it's a little out of date).
<p>
The book is an adaptation of Sobell's other Practical Guides to the Unix
System and 
this shows, and it's not necessarily a bad thing either. However, given the
nature of 
the Linux community, I doubt whether photographs of a mouse and keyboard are
necessary. 
On the positive side, the book is professionally organized, indexed and
referenced. It 
is substantially larger than the other Practical Guides to Unix by the same
author as 
well. 
<p>
In the light of the high quality of the book overall, all of the above
criticisms are 
minor and easily overlooked. The book is far and away the best I have seen
on the 
market for quickly and effectively using Linux software. If you have a copy
of A 
Practical Guide to Linux and Running Linux along with a few appropriate
"How-Tos", 
you should be able to get solutions to most of your Linux  questions as well as 
productively use your system.
