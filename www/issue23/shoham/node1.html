<P>
This article describes a project, recently completed at M-Tech,
for which we constructed a client/server database management system (DBMS),
from the ground up. This DBMS was built using off-the-shelf components,
some tools recycled from previous projects and a modest amount of new code.
<P>
You might ask why we developed a new DBMS, considering the diversity
and quality of commercial DBMS-s already on the market.  The answer
lies in the stringent demands of a project we had contracted for.
This project required an inexpensive, fast, reliable DBMS that
could support <EM>highly secure</EM> transactions over a slow public
network.  There are commercial DBMS products that are inexpensive, fast,
or secure, but we are not aware of any that combine all of these
merits, as well as responsive performance over something as slow
as a modem.
<P>
This article is of particular interest because the technology we
developed for this project can be utilized to construct systems that carry
<EM>any</EM> of the stringent demands of our original project, such as:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Responsive DBMS performance over a slow TCP/IP network.
<LI> Strong security, based on public-key cryptographic technology.
<LI> Inexpensive system implementation, component licensing and
   ongoing maintenance.
