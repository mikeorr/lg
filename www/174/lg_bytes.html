<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Utah Jury Confirms Novell Owns Unix Copyrights</h3>
<p>At the end of March, the jury for the District Court of Utah trial 
between SCO Group and Novell issued a verdict determining the 
ownership of important Unix copyrights.</p>

<p>The jury's decision confirmed Novell's ownership of the Unix 
copyrights, which SCO had asserted to own in its attack on Linux. 
Novell stated that it remains committed to promoting Linux, including 
by defending Linux on the intellectual property front.</p>

<p>Ron Hovsepian, Novell president and CEO, said "This decision is good 
news for Novell, for Linux, and for the open source community. We have 
long contended that this effort against Linux has no foundation, and 
we are pleased that the jury, in a unanimous decision, agrees. I am 
proud of Novell's role in protecting the best interests of Linux and 
the open source community."</p>

<p>SCO is reported as currently weighing an appeal and it may also 
continue its related lawsuit against IBM for both Unix infringement 
and some contract conflicts.</p>

<p>There is a little more on the tail end of this saga.  From 
<a href="http://www.groklaw.com">http://www.groklaw.com</a>:</p>

<p>"The SCO bankruptcy hearing on the sale of the Java patent will be on 
April 20. That's this proposed sale to Liberty Lane for $100,000, and 
that's an LLC affiliated with Allied Security Trust, the 
anti-patent-trolls company, if you've dropped a stitch and can't keep 
up as SCO's assets get sold off bit by bit. If anyone else has bid, 
other than Liberty Lane, then there would be an auction on the 19th, 
but SCO told the court they don't expect that to happen."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">HP ranked 10th in FORTUNE 500 List</h3>
<p>HP has entered the coveted top 10 category of the Fortune 500 list.</p>

<p>IBM came in at 20th, Microsoft at 36th, Dell at 38th, and Apple 56th, 
just ahead of Cisco at 58th.  Amazon.com was 100th with $24 B in 
revenue.  Oracle was 105th at $23 B, but Sun was separately listed at 
204th with 11 B in revenue.  Combined with Sun's revenue, the new 
Oracle would be competing with Apple and Cisco for their rankings in 
the mid-50s of the list.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">MySQL Advisory Board Meetings set for May</h3>

<p>Oracle has announced that the MySQL Customer Advisory Board meetings 
will take place on May 6, 2010 in Amsterdam and June 3, 2010 in 
Redwood Shores, Calif. The meetings will serve as a forum for MySQL 
customers to learn about new enhancements to the MySQL database, and 
provide feedback. The Storage Engine Advisory Board will focus on 
MySQL's storage engine API, and its future.</p>

<p>The announcement coincided with the recent MySQL User Conference which 
will remain separate from the annual Oracle OpenWorld, currently being 
held in San Francisco this September.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Gnome and KDE will co-host 2011 Dev Conference</h3>

<p>Following the successful Gran Canaria Desktop Summit in 2009, the 
GNOME Foundation and KDE e.V. Boards have decided to co-locate their 
flagship conferences once again in 2011, and are taking bids to host 
the combined event.  Desktop Summit 2011 plans to be the largest free 
desktop software event ever.</p>

<p>In July of 2009, the GNOME and KDE communities came together for the 
Gran Canaria Desktop Summit, the first co-located KDE/GNOME event. It 
was a major success and an opportunity for the leaders of the free 
software desktop efforts to communicate on common issues and attend 
combined social events. The attendees from both projects expressed 
great interest in repeating the event and merging the programs to 
synchronize schedules and make the event an even greater opportunity 
for the KDE and GNOME teams to learn from each other and work 
together.</p>

<p>"The Gran Canaria Desktop Summit was a great first event," said 
Vincent Untz, GNOME Foundation Board Member. "We enjoyed working with 
our KDE friends at GCDS in 2009, and want to increase our cooperation 
in 2011. We plan to go beyond simple co-location this time, and 
actually plan a combined schedule in 2011 so that KDE and GNOME 
contributors have every opportunity to work with and learn from each 
other."</p>

<p>The GNOME and KDE projects will hold independent events in 2010. 
GUADEC, the GNOME Project's annual conference, will be held in The 
Hague, Netherlands on July 24 through July 30 of this year. KDE's 
Akademy will be located in Tampere, Finland from July 3 to 10 this 
year. Both groups will likely hold smaller sprints through 2010 and 
early 2011 to prepare for the combined 2011 Desktop Summit.</p>

<p>"The KDE e.V. board felt that GCDS was a fantastic event, and we 
learned what works well and what can be improved when co-hosting an 
event with our GNOME friends," said Cornelius Schumacher of the KDE 
e.V.</p>

<p>More than 850 contributors to the GNOME and KDE projects gathered in 
Gran Canaria last July. The event brought together attendees from 50 
countries, and helped raise local awareness of free software and had a 
measurable impact on the local community. The impact of the event 
continues with nearly 2 million hits to the summit Web site following 
the event.</p>

<p>The projects are seeking a host in Europe at a location that can 
handle more than 1,000 participants. For detailed requirements, 
prospective hosts can see the requirements for Akademy 
(<a href="http://ev.kde.org/akademy/requirements.php">http://ev.kde.org/akademy/requirements.php</a>) and GUADEC 
(<a href="http://live.gnome.org/GuadecPlanningHowTo/CheckList">http://live.gnome.org/GuadecPlanningHowTo/CheckList</a>). Applications 
are welcome before May 15th, and should be sent to the KDE e.V. 
(kde-ev-board@kde.org) and the GNOME Foundation (board@gnome.org) 
boards.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu 10.04 Long Term Support (LTS) Server Reaches for the Clouds</h3>
<p>Canonical has released Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition with extended 
security and maintenance updates free of charge to all users for five 
years (versus 18 months for a standard release). The third and latest 
LTS version of the popular Linux desktop distribution, Ubuntu 10.04 
LTS delivers on the standing commitment to release a version of Ubuntu 
every two years and builds on the success of Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. It has 
been available for free download since April 29th.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 10.04 extends the cloud-computing capability of Ubuntu 
Enterprise Cloud with Eucalyptus - a technology that is becoming 
widely used as a basis for building private clouds. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 
also includes 20 major packages added or updated since the previous 
LTS release, giving new and upgrading users a wide range of 
applications that can be easily installed at launch.</p>

<p>Over 75 organizations have signaled their intent to certify 
applications on the platform including Alfresco, Ingres, IBM, VMware, 
Zimbra, Yahoo and many others with more expected to follow 
post-launch. Dell has announced its intention to support Ubuntu 10.04 
LTS Server Edition and will offer Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud as an option 
on their PowerEdge-C  product line - servers specifically designed for 
building cloud environments. Intel has also been assessing Ubuntu 
Enterprise Cloud and jointly published a white-paper with Canonical on 
how to best deploy the technology on Intel's latest Xeon processors. </p>

<p>New features in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition:</p>

    <p>* Direct upgrade path for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and Ubuntu 9.10 users;</p>
    <p>* Stability and security enhancements for LTS including:<br />
-- Five years of security and maintenance updates free to all 
	  users;<br />
-- AppArmor security by default on key packages;<br />
-- Kernel hardening (memory protection, module loading 
	  blocking, address space layout randomization);<br />
-- Encrypted Home and Private directories;</p>

    <p>* Virtualization enhancements including:<br />
-- KVM now support KSM memory aggregation and live migration 
	  of virtual machines;<br />
-- Automated and fast image creations with VMBuilder;<br />
-- Ubuntu as a Virtual Machine (VM) now supported for VMWare, 
Xen, KVM, Virtualbox, EC2 and UEC;</p>
    <p>* Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) and Amazon EC2 enhancements 
    including:<br />
-- EC2 and UEC images are included in five years of free 
	  security and support updates;<br />
-- Minimal installation profile for minimum footprint VMs 
	  optimized for EC2;<br />
-- Ubuntu EC2 images can be booted from EBS ;<br />
-- Easily customized images at boot time for super 
	  flexibility using cloud-init;<br />
-- Puppet configuration management framework can be used to 
	  mass control instances from their start. </p>

    <p>* Advanced storage capabilities, including Raid and iSCSI and 
    multipath support;</p>
    <p>* Simpler to mass deploy and manage:<br />
-- Puppet integration from the installer and in the cloud.<br />
-- Version control changes (integrated with Puppet) provides 
	  history and accountability.<br />
-- Many new and improved installation profiles.</p> 


<p>Linux Gazette spoke with Nick Barcet, Ubuntu Server Product Manager, 
and Gerry Carr, Platform Marketing Manager, just before 10.4 was 
released.</p>

<p>Carr said that this was the third release of Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud 
(UEC) and first on an LTS release.  "This is a significant upgrade," 
Carr told LG. "This is well-positioned to take us toward more 
mission-critical deployments in the data center."</p>

<p>"This release will also show a significant shift in ISP support,"  
Carr said,  "We expect about 75 ISVs will declare support for 10.04 
Server when released and more will follow.  ...This is more than 
doubling the number of ISVs supporting Ubuntu." </p>

<p>Barcet explained that many IT depts are experimenting with Cloud 
architectures and seem to considering UEC in hybrid public and private 
architectures. There are now about 200 UEC deployments a day and these 
are approaching 11,000 total deployments, he said.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 10.10 is scheduled for release in October and Ubuntu 11 is 
scheduled for the Spring of 2011.  The next LTS release will be in 
2012.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition, including Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, is 
widely available for free download from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">http://www.ubuntu.com</a>  Users 
can upgrade directly to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS from the previous Ubuntu 8.04 
LTS version as well as the Ubuntu 9.10 release.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop has a new look and social network ties</h3>
<p>The new desktop edition of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS will feature extensive 
design work, a nimbler UI, faster boot speed, social network 
integration, online services and the Ubuntu One Music Store.</p>
 
<p>Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop also includes three years of support through 
free security and maintenance updates.</p>
 
<p>"Ubuntu 10.04 LTS challenges the perceptions of the Linux desktop, 
bringing a whole new category of users to the world of Ubuntu," said 
Jane Silber, CEO, Canonical. "Changes like the new look and feel and 
the addition of a music store, layered on top of our relentless focus 
on delivering an intuitive and attractive user experience for new and 
existing Ubuntu users -- these are the bridging elements to the 
mainstream market that our community, our partners and our users 
really want. Long-term support makes Ubuntu 10.04 LTS very attractive 
to corporate IT as well." </p>
 

<p>New in 10.04 LTS:</p>

<p>* Boot speed: Noticeably quicker on almost any machine.<br />
* Social from the start: The new 'Me Menu' in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 
  consolidates the process of accessing and updating social 
  networks including Facebook, Digg, Twitter and Identi.ca. The Me 
  Menu also integrates chat channels.<br />
* Ubuntu One: Enhanced desktop integration for the online service 
  means files and folders and bookmarks can be shared and saved on 
  the cloud more easily.<br />

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Fedora 13 "Goddard" Beta aims to be a rocket</h3>

<p>The Beta release of Fedora 13 (codename "Goddard") blasted off 
mid-April, named for scientist and liquid-fuel rocketry pioneer Robert 
Goddard. Only critical bug fixes will be pushed as updates for the 
general release of Fedora 13, scheduled to be released in the middle 
of May.</p>
 
<p>The available Live images make it easy to try out Fedora - if you 
write one to a USB key, you can add personal data and your favorite 
applications as you go.</p>

<p>Here are some of the changes that are propelling the Fedora 13 Beta:</p>

<p>* The goal in Goddard is to automate some of the hardware and 
software tasks that help users get their work done. When the user 
plugs in a USB or parallel port printer, inserts a specialized CD 
such as collections of music files as opposed to a standard audio 
CD, or downloads or opens an archive file, using powerful back end 
desktop technologies, PackageKit is designed to detect the user's 
action and offer to install software helpers. </p>

<p>* The Fedora 13 Beta allows developers to install and try a 
parallel-installable Python 3 stack for the first time. This 
feature allows developers to write and test code using either the 
current Python 2.6 or the next-generation Python 3 language.</p>

<p>* There are new functions in Fedora 13 Beta for the GNU debugger, 
gdb, that allow it to deliver unified information for C/C++ 
libraries and Python in the same running process. Programmers who 
are writing Python code that wraps or calls C/C++ functions to 
enhance performance and rapid development can now more quickly and 
efficiently detect and debug problems in their code using this 
work.</p>

<p>* System administrators can also try out some of the advanced file 
system improvements in Fedora 13 Beta. New features in the btrfs 
file system allow for rollbacks of entire file system states, 
making application testing and system recovery more powerful than 
ever. </p>

<p>* During its development cycle, Fedora 13 also featured for the 
first time an installable version of Zarafa, a drop-in groupware 
replacement for Exchange with full featured email, calendaring, 
and other collaboration tools for use by both Linux and Microsoft 
clients. A usable and familiar Web interface for users, and 
support for POP/IMAP and other protocols, is included along with 
tools for integration with existing Linux services.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Mepis antiX 8.5 Released</h3>
<p>April saw the release of antiX MEPIS 8.5, a lightweight MEPIS variant 
designed for older computers. Nine months after the release of antiX 
M8.2, antiX MEPIS 8.5 - a fast, light, flexible and complete desktop 
and live CD based on SimplyMEPIS and Debian 'testing' - is now 
available in full and base versions.</p>

<p>This release defaults to a fully customised IceWM desktop (Fluxbox, 
wmii and dwm are also installed) using a SimplyMEPIS 2.6.32 kernel, 
tweaked MEPIS Assistants for better compatibility in antiX and a range 
of applications for desktop use, including Iceape for Internet needs, 
AbiWord and Gnumeric for office use, XMMS and Google's music manager 
for audio, gxine, MPlayer and GNOME MPlayer for video.</p>

<p>This antiX release works on computers with as little as 64 MB RAM, 
though 128MB RAM is the recommended minimum, and the 486 kernel 
version should work on AMD K5/K6.</p>

<p>Download antiX 8.5 here:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Xen.org Releases Xen 4.0 Hypervisor for the Cloud</h3>
<p>Xen.org, the home of the open source Xen hypervisor, has released Xen 
4.0, a collective effort of a global development team representing 
more than 50 leading technology vendors, universities, and 
virtualization experts. Leveraging the latest network cards optimized 
for virtualization, Xen 4.0 provides users substantial performance and 
scalability gains for any level of enterprise or cloud application 
workload.</p>

<p>Xen 4.0 adds significant memory and security optimizations that will 
drive virtualization and infrastructure performance.  As a result, 
virtualization is made suitable for all workloads, even network 
intensive and high performance computing applications that would have 
previously experienced compromised performance on any hypervisor. Xen 
4.0 enables virtualization to be deployed ubiquitously, across every 
server in a datacenter, bringing ease of management, secure 
architecture, high availability, agility and efficiency to all 
applications.</p>

<p>Key Highlights in Xen 4.0:<br>
- Fault Tolerance - Xen 4.0 now supports live transactional 
synchronization of VM states between physical servers as a basic 
component, enabling administrators to guarantee a high degree of 
service reliability.<br />
- High Availability - Xen 4.0 leverages advanced reliability, 
availability and serviceability (RAS) features in new Intel Xeon 
(Nehalem-EX) and AMD Opteron processors.<br />
- Netchannel2 - Xen 4.0's NetChannel2 takes advantage of significant 
advancements in networking hardware such as SMART NICs with 
multi-queue and SR-IOV functionality.<br />
- Blktap2 - A new virtual hard disk (VHD) implementation in Xen 4.0 
delivers high performance VM snapshots and cloning features as well as 
the ability to do live virtual disk snapshots without stopping a VM 
process.<br />
- PVOps Domain 0 - Xen 4.0 is the first release from Xen.org to 
formally support PVOps in the Domain0 (Dom0) Linux kernel; this new 
kernel option allows administrators access to the most recent devices 
supported by the Linux kernel.<br />
- Memory Enhancements - New algorithms, such as Transcendent Memory 
and Page Sharing have been introduced in Xen 4.0 to enhance the 
performance and capabilities of hypervisor memory operations.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">GNOME Project Updates Free Desktop with 2.30 Release</h3>
<p>On March 31st, the GNOME Project celebrated the release of GNOME 2.30, 
the latest version of the popular, multi-platform free desktop 
environment and developer platform. Released on schedule, GNOME 2.30 
builds on top of a long series of successful six month releases, 
including enhancements for user management, Web browsing, support for 
Facebook chat, and new productivity features.</p>

<p>GNOME 2.30 also marks the last major release in the GNOME 2.x era. 
There will be maintenance releases for 2.30, but the community now 
focuses its efforts on GNOME 3.0.</p>

<p>The 2.30 release contains significant user-visible improvements, 
adding numerous platform improvements for developers, and builds 
towards the upcoming GNOME 3.0 release with a preview of the 
revolutionary GNOME Shell. GNOME Shell, which will replace the
existing GNOME Panel, changes the way users will interact with the 
desktop. </p>

<p>Also, this release includes a number of improvements in GNOME's Orca 
Screen Reader that improve performance and use on netbooks, and 
platform improvements to ready GNOME's Accessibility interface for 
GNOME 3.0. The 2.30 release also delivers comprehensive
support for more than 50 languages, and partial support for many 
others.</p>

<p>"I'm really pleased with all of the updates in GNOME 2.30," said 
Stormy Peters, GNOME Executive Director. "I'm excited that I can 
automatically sync my Tomboy notes between my desktop and laptop 
computer, easily configure Facebook chat in Empathy instant messenger, 
and do more with PDFs in Evince. GNOME 2.30 provides everything I need 
for work and play."</p>

<p>GNOME 2.30 includes updates to Nautilus, the GNOME File Manager, 
including a new split view mode and is now set to browser mode by 
default, replacing spatial mode. </p>

<p>GNOME System Tools now works with PolicyKit for authentication, 
removing the Unlock button for managing users and services. The 
dialogue to create a user has been improved and only requires you to 
provide a the new user's name and will include user name suggestions. 
Upon account creation everything will "just work". This also includes 
support for encrypted home directories.</p>

<p>Vinagre, a remote desktop client for the GNOME Desktop, can now access 
to a remote machine more securely through an SSH tunnel. This needs an 
SSH account on the remote client.</p>

<p>Connecting to clients using a low bandwidth connection is eased by 
allowing you to choose a lower depth of colour to save bandwidth and 
by enabling JPEG compression. These options are available in the 
connection dialogue in Vinagre. </p>

<p>You'll find detailed information about GNOME 2.30 in the release 
notes: <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.30/">http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.30/</a>.</p>
