<h2>The Ghoulzette Attacks Again: Guns of Cardboard, Balls of Wax</h2>

<p> It seems that SSC - our old webhost, who contrary to all sense and
practice, decided to keep our name when we <a
href="../issue97/moen.html">gave up that hosting arrangement</a> - is up to
their old tricks again. During the past week, I was contacted by somebody
named Taran Rampersad who claimed to be "in charge at LinuxGazette.com",
and who bluffed, blustered, and threatened me, unless we gave up our name
as the Linux Gazette, with mysterious "<em>[sic]</em> others who have been
preparing handle this situation" while at the same time insisting that we
are "a part of [his] community". Was he confused, stoned, or crazy?  I
didn't know, and - after the first exchange, in which he threatened court
action and insisted that "LinuxGazette is a trademark of SSC", despite the
fact that no <strong>trade</strong>mark can exist without commercial
<strong>trade</strong> - didn't care. (In his second email, he became so
abusive and irrational that I simply killfiled him.) SSC had <a
href="../issue96/moen.html">done this before</a>, including having their
lawyer send us a threatening letter... the simple fact remains that LG is
a volunteer effort, always has been, and when there's no money at stake,
lawyers (and courts) tend to shrug and lose interest. Add to it the fact of
their latest attack chihuahua's complete ignorance of the law -
<strong><em>and</em></strong> of his employer's previous attempts to force
the issue by threats - and the picture adds up to the usual null rhetoric,
a complete waste of time.

<p> So... if that's the case, why am I bothering to talk about it here?

<p> The issue involves a strong moral principle. One of my earliest
self-imposed rules, one of the iron-hard lessons learned as a lone Jewish
kid in a Russian boarding school where the students felt safe in beating
the hell out of a "Christ-killing Jew" because they had the teachers' tacit
approval, was, and remains:

<p> <hr width="50%"><strong><center>
Never let a bully's intimidation attempt pass unchallenged.
</center></strong><hr width="50%">

<p>There were times when this rule <em>cost</em> me; blood, and pain, and
throwing myself at the attacker no matter what his size, over and over
until I could not get up any longer. But the attacks stopped in very short
order... and being known as "that crazy Jew" kept me alive through the
years following that insane time.

<p> Many years have passed, but the principle remains. Even in the small
things - <em>especially</em> in the small things.


<blockquote><pre>

The heroic hours of life do not announce their presence by drum and
trumpet, challenging us to be true to ourselves by appeals to the martial
spirit that keeps the blood at heat. Some little, unassuming, unobtrusive
choice presents itself before us slyly and craftily, glib and insinuating,
in the modest garb of innocence. To yield to its blandishments is so easy.
The wrong, it seems, is venial... Then it is that you will be summoned to
show the courage of adventurous youth.
 -- Benjamin Cardozo

</pre></blockquote>


<p> SSC, namely Phil Hughes, had tried these scare tactics before; he had
managed to intimidate several of our people, who faded away or minimized
their involvement with LG for fear of legal retribution. Let me underscore
this here and now - I do not blame any of them in any way, but feel
compassion for their pain, sorrow that they should have been exposed to
those strong-arm tactics because they tried to give their effort to the
Linux community, and anger toward those who have harmed them. ("Where lies
the danger?", cry many Linux pundits. "Is it Microsoft? Is it SCO?" Oh, if
it was only those <em>external</em> attacks we had to guard against...) 

<p> However, in the main, Hughes failed, and failed miserably: there was a
core of people here who refused to kowtow to his threats, whom attacks and
intimidation made only more stubborn and willing to resist and fight - and,
as is often the case with bullies, all his threats turned out to be nothing
more than hot air. More than that, when Phil's tactics were exposed to the
public, we received many emails supporting our position and excoriating
SSC, and several of their subscribers (they publish the Linux Journal,
among other things) contacted us to say that they were cancelling their
subscriptions in protest (something we advised them not to do, since that
action would harm SSC as a whole rather than just the one person
responsible.)

<p> At the time, I believed in the above principle just as much as I always
have - but the balance of the opinions here at LG was that "we should be
the nice guys in this conflict", and thus the exposure of the above
bullying was minimal. Now, threatened by the tremendous popularity of LG -
the initial email cited a Google hit statistic that showed LG.net gaining
on LG.com at a tremendous rate, despite a large differential in length of
existence - they're cranking up the threat machine <strong>again</strong>.

<p> The stakes in this conflict remain the same; our response to strong-arm
tactics will be the same disdain and disgust with which we treated it
previously. But this time, I will not be silent. From this point forward, I
will grant the bullies neither the comforting shield of obscurity nor the
undeserved respect of privacy for their actions. That time is over.

<p> And, just as with those other cowards in the past, I believe that it
will end here and now, or at least in very short order. As a wise man said
once, echoing my belief in different and perhaps better words, <em>every
one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his
deeds should be reproved.</em>

<p> Let there be light.

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.

<em>
<p>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.

<p>His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.

<p>He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
