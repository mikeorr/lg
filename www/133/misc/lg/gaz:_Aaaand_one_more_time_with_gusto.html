I've just added a routine to extract all the email addresses out of the
TAG mailbag, look them up in the LG bios, and pull up the names
associated with those addresses; the folks for whom this chain 1) exists
and 2) matches will be credited with participating in the monthly
madness (the credits will be listed at the top of the generated Mailbag
page.)
</p>

<p>
Since I really like rewarding people who do good work to whatever extent
I can, I'd appreciate it if everyone would make sure that 1) they've
sent me a bio (preferably with a ~200x200px pic included) and 2) their
bio contains the email address that they're using to post to TAG. This
would satisfy my itch <em>and</em> credit you for your brilliant flights of wit
and wisdom... sounds like an all-around win to me. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Wit? Wit? I avail myself of the services of Rent-a-Wit, retype what they
give me so that the ghost of my seventh grade english teacher won't use
the steel ruler in my dreams ... and as I'm reaching for the Send
button, &gt; plib &lt; ... a mail appears from Rick: wherein he not only
answers the question, but has an international travel story with which
to demonstrate the principle, and originally posted the proper answer
somewhere in the Moenbase sometime just after Univac fired up for the
first time. I cry for a bit, then hit the delete key. Of course, I still
have to pay the bill from Rent-a-Wit.

Lost by a nose, ignominously scooped - <strong>and</strong> stuck with the bill! Truly,
a tragedy; Oscar Wilde would have recognized the basic storyline in a
second (and probably sued you for stealing the idea, since he was just
about to think of it.)

[Narrowing eyes] Saaay, you wouldn't be one of them _esprit d'escalier_
johnnies trying to make it the other guy's fault, would ya? <strong>And</strong> trying
to score some pity whuffie, too. Tisk, tisk...

<p>
(Not bad for a first try. Even the Russian judge is holding up an '8.6'.)
