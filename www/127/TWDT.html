<p> <strong>This example in the 4th exercise works great.Just one problem that 
  I have with all these AJX &amp; XMLHTTPREQUEST is that the user's browser (IE) 
  prompts every time at the call-back that the page is trying to access off-site 
  pages that are not under its control, and that it poses a security risk. How 
  do you get past this without asking the user to turn off the security settings?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Take for example a real-world scenario where a transactional page must 
  get a real-time transaction back from another server-based page. Then upon clicking 
  something like a SUBMIT button, the user is going to get this little message 
  popping up, stating that it is a security risk. Any ideas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks in advance.</strong></p>

  <p>Hi, Willem -</p>
  <p>First off, please turn off the HTML formatting when emailing TAG. Many people 
    in help forums, including a number of people here, will not take the trouble 
    to answer you if you require them to wade through HTML markup, and will discard 
    your mail unread; others will just be annoyed at having to clean up the extraneous 
    garbage. In addition, you've tripled the size of your message. I've corrected 
    the above problems, but some information may have been lost in the process. 
  </p>
  <p> Pardon me... you've used 'IE' and 'security' in the same sentence, without 
    the presence of modifiers such as 'bad' or 'non-existent'. I'm afraid that 
    makes your sentence unparseable. :)</p>
  <p>As I sometimes point out to people, the term &quot;Linux&quot; in &quot;Linux 
    Gazette&quot; tends to imply certain things - one of which is that answering 
    questions like &quot;How do I make IE do $WHATEVER&quot; comes down to &quot;use 
    Linux&quot;. Asking us how to fix broken crapware in a legacy OS is, I'm afraid, 
    an exercise in futility; the very concept of &quot;security settings&quot; 
    in a *browser*, a client-end application designed for viewing content, is 
    something that can only be discussed after accepting the postulate that water 
    does indeed run uphill, and the sun rises in the west.</p>
  <p>Perhaps your client can mitigate the problem somewhat by running a browser 
    that isn't broken-as-designed; Mozilla Firefox is a reasonable example of 
    such a critter. For anything beyond that, I'd suggest asking in Wind0ws- and 
    IE-related forums.</p>

<p> Re multi-seat computers, I think you are heading for much pain to use the 
  /dev/input/X devices directly!<br />
  If USB devices are powered on in a different order, these will move around!</p>
<p>Use Udev rules, and symlinks....</p>
<p>I have 4 mice on my system (don't ask why!); here is my config in case it is 
  useful:</p>
<pre class="code">
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules
------------------------------------------------------
#Rules for the various different mice on the system (the PS/2, Synaptics and Trackpoint)

#PS/2 mouse (usually /dev/input/mouse0)
#Symlink as /dev/input/ps2mouse
BUS="serio", kernel="mouse*", SYSFS{description}="i8042 Aux Port", 
NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/ps2mouse"

#Synaptics touchpad (in mouse mode) (usually /dev/input/mouse1)
#Symlink as /dev/input/synaptics-mouse
BUS="usb", kernel="mouse*", DRIVER="usbhid", 
SYSFS{bInterfaceClass}="03", SYSFS{bInterfaceNumber}="00", 
SYSFS{interface}="Rel", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/synaptics-mouse"

#Synaptics touchpad (in event mode) (usually /dev/input/event5)
#Symlink as /dev/input/synaptics-event
BUS="usb", kernel="event*", DRIVER="usbhid", 
SYSFS{bInterfaceClass}="03", SYSFS{bInterfaceNumber}="00", 
SYSFS{interface}="Rel", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/synaptics-event"


#Trackpoint (usually /dev/input/mouse2)
#Symlink as /dev/input/trackpoint
BUS="usb", kernel="mouse*", DRIVER="usbhid", 
SYSFS{bInterfaceClass}="03", SYSFS{bInterfaceNumber}="01", 
SYSFS{interface}="Rel", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/trackpoint"

#WizardPen (usually /dev/input/event6)
#Symlink as /dev/input/wizardpen
BUS="usb", kernel="event*", DRIVER="usbhid", 
SYSFS{bInterfaceClass}="03", SYSFS{bInterfaceNumber}="00", 
SYSFS{interface}="Tablet WP5540U", NAME="input/%k", SYMLINK="input/wizardpen"
-----------------------------------------</pre>
<p>Then I can configure paragraphs in xorg.conf like this:</p>
<pre class="code">
Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier "ps2mouse"
     Driver "mouse"
     Option "Device" "/dev/input/ps2mouse"
     Option "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
     Option "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
EndSection

Section "InputDevice"
     Identifier "trackpoint"
     Driver "mouse"
     Option "Device" "/dev/input/trackpoint"
     Option "Protocol" "ExplorerPS/2"
     Option "ZAxisMapping" "6 7"
         #We want to use emulatewheel + emulatewheelltimeout.  But need Xorg 6.9 for that
         #Option "EmulateWheel" "on"
         #Option "EmulateWheelButton" "2"
         #Option "EmulateWheelTimeout" "200"
         #Option "YAxisMapping" "6 7"
         #Option "XAxisMapping" "4 5"
         #Option "ZAxisMapping" "10 11"
EndSection</pre>
<p>[Bob] - Picture Bob smacking his head and saying &quot;Doh!&quot; You are right 
  and the next article, the one where I get it *all* working, will use udev and 
  symlinks.<br />
  Using /dev/input was not too bad since the USB bus is enumerated the same way 
  on each power up. I only had to move things around once right after the initial 
  set up.</p>
<p>[[RichardN]] - I shall be interested to see how it goes, especially if you 
  can make the resulting system stable. Also, I wonder whether you can use udev 
  to distinguish between 6 different copies of a nominally identical item? Some 
  may let you use a serial number. Using the BUS id would be cheating - one ought 
  to be able to plug it together randomly and have it work!</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>P.S. An interesting challenge would be to get separate audio channels working 
    (eg a 5.1 channel motherboard could give 2 1/2 stereo outputs!) Or you could 
    use alsa to multiplex all the users together so that everyone can access the 
    speakers (and trust the users to resolve conflicts).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&gt; I have 4 mice on my system (don't ask why!); here is my config in case 
    <br />
    &gt; it is useful:</p>
  <p>All right, I won't ask.</p>
  <p>...</p>
  <p>OK, maybe I will. :) So, why do you have _4_ mice on your system? And what's 
    the difference between 'mouse mode' and 'event mode'?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[RichardN]] - OK. I have an IBM ultranav keyboard containing a trackpoint 
  and a touchpad.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1)The trackpoint is my primary mouse.</p>
  <p>2)The touchpad is also used as a mouse (mainly for scrolling). It appears 
    as 2 different devices, so you can either treat it as a mouse (I called this 
    mouse-mode), or as an event-device. The latter is the way to use its advanced 
    features with the synaptics driver, but I'm not actually doing this for now.</p>
  <p>3)A regular, PS2 mouse, for things like PCB design.</p>
  <p>4)A Graphics tablet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - Perhaps you should just write an article on Udev. :)</p>
<p>[[RichardN]] - You're very kind. But there is one already: <a href="http://reactivated.net/udevrules.php">http://reactivated.net/udevrules.php</a></p>

  
<p>[Ben] - [snip code] I can see a lot of sense in that. Judging from this example, 
  I should be able to figure out a config file that will keep my flash drive at 
  a single, consistent mountpoint (instead of having to do &quot;tail /var/log/messages&quot; 
  and mounting whatever random dev it managed to become.) I've heard of Udev before, 
  and even had a general idea of what it did, but never really explored it to 
  any depth. Nice!</p>
<p>[[RichardN]] - Indeed. You'll get a random /dev/sdX, but a consistent symlink 
  /dev/my_flash_drive (which you specify). Then, you can specify where it should 
  be mounted via options in fstab.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even better: you can specify that a digital camera should have umask and 
    dmask (in fstab), which will fix the annoying tendency of JPGs to be marked 
    as executable!</p>

<p><strong>Have you tried a USB audio solution for each station as well, and how 
  would that be worked into the configuration?</strong></p>
<p>[Bob] - I have not tried it yet and do not know. The keyboards in my system 
  have a built in, 1 port hub. I was going to try to tie that hub to the user 
  at that keyboard. So, a flash drive plugged in would only be visible by that 
  user. Kind of the same with audio; they would have to bring their own audio 
  set but it would work if they plugged it in. </p>

<p>I do a lot with LTSP, so I'm familiar with sharing a machine between multiple 
  users. KDE's kiosktool will let you do quite a bit to disallow the more CPU 
  intensive screensavers. Verynice is also helpful in keeping rogue processes 
  in check.</p>

<p>Wed Mar 8 22:24:36 PST 2006</p>
<p><strong>I had worked on this multi terminal setup for around 6 months(from 
  dec 2004 - july 2005) with RHEL 3.0 and RHEL 4.0, I made this setup with ati 
  and nvidia cards. But my biggest problem was that many application makes problems 
  on running on suh a setup especially sound applications. I rectified many of 
  the things thru some wiered ways. But some apps like the SWF plugin for mfirefox 
  made the big problems as only one instance of the plugin can be used, bcos the 
  sound is redirected to the same device always, say /dev/dsp.To solve this problem 
  we used a very ugly way,that we mounted the same /tmp folder for all the users 
  and made the app thinks that it was using a seperate /temp and the device is 
  always /dev/hda.This actually ruins the security of linux to a big extend.while 
  some other apps like tuxracer, konquest etc,which using the videocards directly(DRI 
  enabled).So I think the application design plays a vital role in such a setup. 
  Though the last kernel i used was 2.9.11, I didn't tried any new patches or 
  solutions aroused in last 8-10 months,but i am just sharing My other observations 
  also:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) I tried to make this setup on mother boards that of Intel make, 
  whic was an unsuccessful attempt, for which i don't get a good explanation </strong></p>
<p><strong>2)These setups are working good on AMD,and Some MSI mother boards, 
  with Intel or NVIDIA chipset with Nvidia cards.</strong></p>
<p><strong> 3)The NVIDIA AMD combination shows excellent performance over others</strong></p>
<p><strong> 4)The applications like mplayer shows certain level of uncertainity 
  even we configured it properly</strong></p>
<p><strong> 5)If u are using audio/visual applications u the application should 
  be configurable(eg: mplayer on which we can select the audio device from the 
  configuration options whic also supports the alsa devices).</strong></p>
<p><strong> 6) For a normal user it's not possible to configure applications like 
  swf plugin for firefox for all the six users.</strong></p>
<p><strong> 7)this setup is best suited for a lab environment,and newbies bcos 
  for advanced users the CPU speed may not be sufficient(like a kernel compilation 
  fatally degrades the performance of the whole system)</strong></p>
<p><strong>I Dont know these observations are correct or not as per current situation.but 
  I think most are still relevent. <br />
  regards<br />
  vineesh</strong></p>
<p>[Bob] - Thanks, Vineesh.<br />
  My solution to the sound problem was to turn it off for everyone -- not a very 
  elegant solution. A couple of readers have pointed out a system that would break 
  the PC into six separate systems, each with its own sound, X, and especially 
  important, security. The virtual server page is at http://linux-vserver.org. 
  I have not tried it yet but it looks promising.</p>

<p> <strong>Hi Bob,</strong></p>
<p><strong> I've been posting on Chris Tylers blog regarding my Multiseat configuration. 
  I've also had problems with a kernel Opps when the last person (seat 1 of a 
  two seat configuration) logs out. I was looking at you kernel opps message and 
  the call trace is very similar to yours. I was wondering if you still have that 
  system running, and if so could you send me a copy of an 'lspci -vvv'. Also, 
  I'm interested in hearing your experiences using the 'nv' driver. Were you having 
  a similar Opps?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Best Regards,<br />
  Chuck Sites</strong></p>
<p>[Bob] - The system is not running right now but I can set it up again fairly 
  easily. What did you want to know from the 'lspci -vvv'?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I tried both the nv and vesa drivers. Neither could successfully get all 
    six heads working. The nVidia driver was easily the best driver I tested. </p>

  <p> What was the full line to invoke X?<br />
    Does the error occur on the first head or the last?<br />
    Could you send the x.org configuration for one head?</p>
  <p>I saw this problem several times, but each time it was because I mis-typed

  Tue Mar 14 18:18:19 PST 2006</p>
<p> <strong>Hi all,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was just wondering if there is a way to enter the default inputs 
  at the cmdline recursively when a program asks for user input. For eg. while 
  compiling the kernel it asks for a whole lot of interactions wherein you just 
  keep pressing Enter. The command 'Yes' is not an option in this case cos at 
  some stages the default input would be a No. Help appreciated and thanks in 
  advance.</strong></p>
<p>[Thomas] - Sure. You can use 'yes' of course -- just tell it not to actually 
  print any characters:</p>
<pre class="code">
   yes "" | make oldconfig
</pre>
<blockquote> 
  <p> That will just feed into each stage an effective "return key press" that 
    accepts whatever the default is. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Ben]] - Conversely, you can use a 'heredoc' - a shell mechanism designed 
  for just that reason:</p>
<pre class="code">
  program <&lt;!
  yes
  no
  maybe

  !
</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>In the above example, &quot;program&quot; will receive four arguments via 
    STDIN: 'yes&lt;Enter&gt;', 'no&lt;Enter&gt;', 'maybe&lt;Enter&gt;', and the 
    &lt;Enter&gt; key all by itself.</p>

<p>Brian Sydney Jathanna (briansydney at gmail.com)<br />
  Tue Mar 21 14:44:57 PST 2006</p>
<p> <strong>Is there a way to modify the commandline of a running process? By 
  looking at /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/cmdline it looks as though it is readonly even 
  to root user. It would be helpful to add options or change arguments to a running 
  command, if this was possible. Is there a way to get around with it? Thanks 
  in advance.</strong></p>
<p>[Thomas] - I don't see how. Most applications only parse what they're told 
  to at init time, via --command-line options. This means you would have to effectively 
  restart the application.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>However, if a said application receives its options via a config file, then 
    sending that application a HUP signal might help you -- providing the said 
    application supports the command-line options in the config file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Ben]] - Not that I can make a totally authoritative statement on this, but 
  I agree with Thomas: when the process is running, what you have is a memory 
  image of a program _after_ it has finished parsing all the command-line options 
  and doing all the branching and processing dependent on them; there's no reason 
  for those command-line parsing mechanisms to be active at that point. Applications 
  that need this kind of functionality - e.g., Apache - use the mechanism that 
  Thomas describes to achieve it, with a &quot;downtime&quot; of only a tiny fraction 
  of a second between runs.</p>

<h3><img ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/envelope.gif"> <font color="navy">I have 
  a question about rm command.</font> </h3>
<p>manne neelima (manne_neelima at yahoo.com)<br />
  Wed Mar 22 12:08:12 PST 2006</p>
<p> <strong>I have a question about rm command. Would you please tell me how to 
  remove all the files excepts certain Folder in Unix?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks in Advance<br />
  Neelima</strong></p>
<p>[Thomas] - Given that the 'rm' command is picky about removing non-empty directories 
  anyway (unless it is used with the '-f' flag) I suspect your question is:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;How can I exclude some file from being removed?&quot;</p>
  <p>... to which the answer is:</p>
  <p>&quot;It depends on the file -- what the name is, whether it has an 'extension', 
    etc.&quot;</p>
  <p>Now, since you've provided next to nothing about any of that, here's a contrived 
    example. Let's assume you had a directory &quot;/tmp/foo&quot; with some files 
    in it:</p>
  <p>```<br />
    [n6tadam at workstation foo]$ ls<br />
    a b c<br />
    '''</p>
  <p>Now let us add another directory, and add some files into that:</p>
  <p>```<br />
    [n6tadam at workstation foo2]$ ls<br />
    c d e f g<br />
    '''</p>
  <p>Let's now assume you only wanted to remove all the files in foo:</p>
  <p>```<br />
    [n6tadam at workstation foo]$ rm -i /tmp/foo/*<br />
    '''</p>
  <p>Would remove the files 'a', 'b', and 'c'. It would not remove &quot;foo2&quot; 
    since that's a non-empty directory.</p>
  <p>Of course, the answer to your question is really one of globbing. I don't 
    know what kind of files you want removing, but for situations such as this, 
    the find(1) command works &quot;better&quot;:</p>
  <p>```<br />
    find /tmp/foo -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm<br />
    '''</p>
  <p>... would remove all files in /tmp/foo _recursively_ which means the files 
    in /tmp/foo2 would also be removed. Woops. Note that earlier with the &quot;rm 
    -i *&quot; command, the glob only expands the top-level, as it ought to. You 
    can limit find's visibility, such that it will only remove the files from 
    /tmp/foo and nowhere else:</p>
  <p>```<br />
    find /tmp/foo -maxdepth 1 -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm<br />
    '''</p>
  <p>Let's now assume you didn't want to remove file &quot;b&quot; from /tmp/foo, 
    but everything else. You could do:</p>
  <p>```<br />
    find /tmp/foo -maxdepth 1 -type f -not -name 'b' -print0 | xargs -0 rm<br />
    '''</p>
  <p>... etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - Well, first off, Unix doesn't have &quot;Folders&quot;; I presume that 
  you're talking about directories. Even so, the 'rm' command doesn't do that 
  - there's no &quot;selector&quot; mechanism built into it except the (somewhat 
  crude) &quot;-i&quot; (interactive) option. However, you can use shell constructs 
  or other methods to create a list of files to be supplied as an argument list 
  to 'rm', which would do what you want - or you could process the file list and 
  use a conditional operator to execute 'rm' based on some factor. Here are a 
  few examples:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p># Delete all files except those that end in 'x', 'y', or 'z'<br />
    rm *[^xyz]</p>
  <p># Delete only the subdirectories in the current dir<br />
    for f in *; do [ -d &quot;$f&quot; ] &amp;&amp; rm -rf &quot;$f&quot;; done</p>
  <p># Delete all except regular files<br />
    find /bin/* ! -type f -exec /bin/rm -f {} \;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Ben]] - Whoops - forgot to clean up after experimenting. :) That last should, 
  of course, be</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>find * ! -type f -exec /bin/rm -f {} \;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Francis]]] - My directory &quot;.evil&quot; managed to survive those last 
  few. And my file &quot;(surprise&quot; seemed to cause a small problem...</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Heh. Too right; I got too focused on the &quot;except for&quot; 
  nature of the problem. Of course, if I wanted to do a real search-and-destroy 
  mission, I'd do something like</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre class="code">   su -c 'chattr -i file1 file2 file3; rm -rf `pwd`; chattr +i *'</pre>
  <p>[evil grin]</p>
  <p>No problems with '(surprise', '.evil', or anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[Thomas]]]]] - ... that won't work across all filesystems, though.</p>
<p>[[[[[[Ben]]]]]] - OK, here's something that will:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>1) Copy off the required files.<br />
    2) Throw away the hard drive, CD, whatever the medium.<br />
    3) Copy the files back to an identical medium.</p>
  <p>There, a nice portable solution. What, you have more objections? :)</p>
  <p> Note that I said &quot;if *I* wanted to do a real search-and-destroy mission&quot;. 
    I use ext3 almost exclusively, so It Works For Me. To anyone who wants to 
    include vfat, reiserfs, pcfs, iso9600, and malaysian_crack_monkey_of_the_week_fs, 
    I wish the best of luck and a good supply of their tranquilizer of choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Francis]]] - (Of course, you knew that.</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Actually, I'd missed it while playing around with the other stuff, 
  so I'm glad you were there to back me up.</p>
<p>[[[Francis]]] - But if the OP cares about *really* all-bar-one, it's worth 
  keeping in mind that &quot;*&quot; tends not to match /^./, and also that &quot;*&quot; 
  is rarely as useful as &quot;./*&quot;, at least when you don't know what's 
  in the directory. I suspect this isn't their primary concern, though.)</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Well, './*' won't match dot-files any better than '*' will, although 
  you can always futz around with the 'dotglob' setting:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre class="code">   # Blows away everything in $PWD<br />   (GLOBIGNORE=1; rm *)</pre>
  <p>...but you knew that already. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Martin] - try this perl script... This one deletes all hidden files apart 
  from the ones in the hash.</p>

[Kapil] - I haven't used NFS in such a massive context so this may not be the 
right question. 
<p>[[Ramon]] - Doesn't matter, I remember once explaining why I was still at work 
  and with what problem to the guy cleaning our office (because he asked). He 
  asked one question which put me on the right track solving the issue....in half 
  an hour after banging my head against it for two days ;-)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Not intending to compare you to a cleaner... sometimes it helps a lot if 
    you get questions from a different mindset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Kapil] - Have you tested what happens with the user-space NFS daemon?</p>
<p>[[Ramon]] - Urhm, not clear what you mean.... Tested in what sense ?</p>
[[[Kapil] ]]] - Well. I noticed that you had compiled in the kernel NFS daemon. 
So I assumed that you were using the kernel NFS daemon rather than the user-space 
one. Does your problem persist when you use the user-space daemon? 
<p>[[[[Ramon]]]] - Thanx, no it doesn't.</p>
<p>[[[Kapil]]] - The reason I ask is that it may be the kernel NFS daemon that 
  is leading to too many indirections for the kernel stack to handle.</p>
<p>[[[[ Ramon]]]] - That appears to be the case. I'm writing a mail to lkml &amp; 
  nfs list right now to report on the bug.</p>
<p>[[[[[Ramon]]]]] - Turned out it did, but with a higher threshold. As soon as 
  we started testing with files &gt; 100Mb the same behaviour came up again.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It turned out to be another bug related to reiserfs.</p>
  <p>For those interested more data is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?%20forum_id=4930&max_rows=25&style=flat&viewmonth=200511&viewday=1">here</a> 
    and <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=reiserfs&m=112255940804474&w=2">here</a>.</p>
  <p>In short: Although reiserfs reports in its FAQ that it supports filesystems 
    up to 16Tb with the default options (4K blocks) it supports only 8Tb. It doesn't 
    fail however and appears to work correctly when using the local filesystem, 
    the problems start showing up when using NFS</p>
  <p>I fixed the problem by using another filesystem. Based on comments on the 
    nfs-ml and the excellent article in last months linuxgazette we switched to 
    jfs.<br />
    So far it's holding up very good. We haven't seen the problems reappearing 
    with files in excess of 1Gb</p>
  <p>Thanx for the help though.</p>

  <p>Dear Fahad Saeed,</p>
  <p>First of all you again sent HTML mail. You need to configure your webmail

  <p>Actually, I just used the &quot;named-interface&quot; feature to call my

  <p>&gt; Hope this helps.I didnt get your question exactly.Please let me know<br />
    &gt; what exactly are you trying to do and looking so that i can be of<br />
    &gt; more specific help.</p>
  <p>My question was what one does after this. Specifically, is the IP address 
    of the interface configured statically via a command like ifconfig eth0 192.168.0.14 
    and if so what is the netmask setting?</p>
  <p>Just to be completely clear. I have not managed to get two laptops to communicate 
    with each other using ad-hoc mode. Both sides say the (wireless) link is up, 
    but I couldn't get them to send IP packets to each other. I have only managed 
    to get an IP link when there is a common access point (hub).</p>
  <p>The problem is that getting wireless cards to work with Linux has been such 
    a complicated issue in the past that most HOWTO's spend a lot of time in explaining 
    how to download and compile the relevant kernel modules and load firmware. 
    The authors are probably exhausted by the time they got to the details of 
    setting up networking :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Ben]] - That's something I'd really like to learn to do myself. I've thought about 
    it on occasion, and it always seemed like a doable thing - but I never got 
    any further than that, so a description of the actual setup would be a really 
    cool thing.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>When I read about those $100 laptops that Negroponte et al are cranking out, 
    I pictured a continent-wide wireless fabric of laptops stretching across, 
    say, Africa - with some sort of a clever NAT and bandwidth-metering setup 
    on each machine where any host within reach of an AP becomes a &quot;relay 
    station&quot; accessible to everyone on that WAN. Yeah, it would be dead slow 
    if there were only a few hosts within reach of APs... but the capabilities 
    of that kind of system would be awesome.</p>
  <p>I must say that, in this case, &quot;the Devil is not as bad as he's painted&quot;. 
    In my experience of wireless cards under Linux has consisted of</p>
  <p>1) Find the source on the Net and download it;<br />
    2) Unpack the archive in /usr/src/modules;<br />
    3) 'make; make install' the module and add it to the list in<br />
    &quot;/etc/modules&quot;.</p>
  <p>Oh, and run 'make; make install' every time you recompile the kernel. Not 
    what I'd call terribly difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Martin]]] - When my Dad had a wireless card it wasn't that simple...</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>It was a Netgear something or other USB - I don't think we ever got it work 
    in Linux in the end.</p>
  <p>Its not a problem now though as he is using Ethernet over Power and it's 
    working miles better in both Windows and Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Hmm, strange. Netgear and Intel are the only network hardware with which 
    I haven't had any problems - whatever the OS. Well, different folks, different 
    experiences...</p>

  
<p>[[[Saeed]]] - I would have to agree with Kapil here.Yes the configuration process 
  is sometimes extremely difficulty.As Benjamin potrayed it ...it seems pretty 
  easy and in theory it is. But when done practically it is not that straightforward. 
  The main problem is that the drivers available are for different chipsets.The 
  vendors do not care about the chipsets and change the chipsets without changing 
  the product ID. It happened in our case with WMP11 if I am remembering correctly.</p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>Obviously once you get the correct sets of drivers, kernel and chipsets it 
    is straightforward.</p>
  <p>The lab setup that we did in UET LAHORE required the cards to work in ad-hoc 
    mode.We used madwifi drivers. Now as you may know that there is beacon problem 
    in the madwifi drivers and the ad-hoc mode itself does not work reliably.The 
    mode that we implemented was Ad-hoc mode Cluster Head Routing. In simple words 
    it meant that one of the PC's were configured to be in Master mode and there 
    were bunch of PCs around.It would have been really cool if we could get it 
    work in 'pure ad-hoc' mode nevertheless it served the LAB purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Jason]]] - Huh. Weird. I've got an ad-hoc network set up with my PC and 
  my sister's laptop, and it &quot;just works&quot;. The network card in my PC 
  is a Netgear PCI MA311, with the &quot;Prism 2.5&quot; chipset. (&quot;orinoco_pci&quot; 
  is the name of the driver module.)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre class="code">   :r!lspci | grep -i prism
   0000:00:0e.0 Network controller: Intersil Corporation Prism 2.5 Wavelan chipset (rev 01)</pre>
  <p>The stanza in /etc/network/interfaces is:</p>
  <pre class="code">
    auto eth1
    iface eth1 inet static
    address 10.42.42.1
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    wireless-mode ad-hoc
    wireless-essid jason
    wireless-key XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XX</pre>
  <p>FWIW, the commands I was using to bring up the interface before I switched 
    to Debian were:</p>
  <pre class="code">   sbin/ifconfig eth1 10.42.42.1 netmask 255.255.255.0
   /usr/sbin/iwconfig eth1 mode Ad-Hoc
   /usr/sbin/iwconfig eth1 essid "jason"
   /usr/sbin/iwconfig eth1 key "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XX"</pre>
  <p>I have dnsmasq providing DHCP and DNS. The laptop is running Windows 2000 
    with some off-brand PCMCIA wifi card.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Kapil]]]] - I get it. While the link-layer can be setup in ad-hoc mode 
  by the the cards using some WEP/WPA mechanism, there has to be some other mechanism 
  to fix the IP addresses+netmasks. For example, one could use static IP addresses 
  of each of the machines as Fahad Saeed (or Jason) has done. Of course, in a 
  server-less network one doesn't want one machine running a DHCP server. Alles 
  ist klar.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I will try this out the next time I have access to two laptops...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Saeed]] - First of all I am sorry abt the html format thing.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Dear Kapil what is your card's chipset type and what drivers you used to 
    configure them with linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Kapil]]] - The card is the Intel one and it works with the driver ipw2200 
  that is built into the default kernel along with the firmware from the Intel 
  site.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>In fact, I have had absolutely no complaints about getting the card to work 
    with wireless access stations with/without encryption and/or authentication. 
    But all these modes are &quot;Managed&quot; modes.</p>
  <p>I once tried to get the laptop to communicate with another laptop (a Mac) 
    in Ad-Hoc mode and was entirely unsuccessful. So when you said that you managed 
    to get an Ad-Hoc network configured for your Lab, I thought you had used the 
    cards in Ad-Hoc mode.</p>
  <p>However, from your previous mail it appears that you configured one card 
    in &quot;Master&quot; mode and the remaining cards in &quot;Managed&quot; 
    mode, so that is somehow different. In particular, I don't think the card 
    I have can be set up in &quot;Master&quot; mode at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Saeed]]]] - You got it right; we did used the master mode type in the lab 
  for demonstration purposes because it was more reliable than the pure 'ad-hoc' 
  mode and it served the lab purposes.However we did use the ad-hoc mode in the 
  lab and it worked fine but wasn't reliable enough for lab purposes ...which 
  has to work reliably at all times.</p>

<p> <strong>Dear list,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am using discover 2.0.6 in a debian sarge(testing) machine with Linux 
  2.6.8-2-k7 kernel. There is no */etc/discover.conf* file. I can't understand 
  where discover is looking after for its default configuration. Pls let me know 
  so that I can change its scanning options. *discover -t modem* or *discover 
  -t printer* don't detect my modem or printer BUT hwinfo detect these H/W perfectly. 
  What may be the problem ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have presently the files in my machine are</strong></p>
<pre>
   /usr/bin/discover 
   /etc/discover.d 
   /lib/discover
   /usr/share/discover 
   /usr/share/man/man1/discover.1.gz
   discover.conf-2.6
   discover-modprobe.conf
   discover.conf.d
   discover-v1.conf
   discover.d</pre>
<p><strong>What to do so that discover can load the drivers module automatically 
  during boot ? Kindly solve my doubts. Please CC to me with best complements</strong></p>
<p>[Rick] - The Debian systems I have at my disposal at this moment don't have 
  discover installed, so I'm limited to the information available on-line. However, 
  searching http://packages.debian.org/ for &quot;discover&quot; turns up a number 
  of packages including the main &quot;discover&quot; one, providing this list 
  of contents on i386 sarge (which is _not_ the testing branch, by the way: sarge=stable, 
  etch=testing -- for quite some time, now):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><a href="http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=discover&version=stable&arch=i386">http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&amp;word=discover&amp;version=stable&amp;arch=i386</a></p>
  <p>I notice in that list a file called &quot;etc/discover-modprobe.conf&quot;. 
    Perhaps that's what you're looking for? Its manpage (also findable on the 
    Internet) describes it as &quot;the configuration file for discover-modprobe, 
    which is responsible for retrieving and loading kernel modules&quot;.</p>
  <p> &gt; *discover -t modem* or *discover -t printer* don't detect my modem 
    or<br />
    &gt; printer BUT hwinfo detect these H/W perfectly. What may be the problem?</p>
  <p>Ah, now _that_ is a completely different question. J. Bakshi, you really 
    would be well advised to be careful of overdefining your problem, when you're 
    asking for help. If your _real_ problem is that you haven't yet figured out 
    how to configure Debian-sarge to address your modem and printer, please _say 
    so_ and give us relevant details.</p>
  <p>If, by contrast, you claim the problem is that you need to find discover's 
    configuration file, _that_ is all you'll get help with, even if your problem 
    has nothing to do with discover in the first place.</p>
  <p>I have a suggestion: Why don't you back up and start over? Tell us about 
    your modem and printer's nature and configuration, what relevant software 
    is installed on your system, what is an is not happening, what you've tried, 
    and exactly what happened when you tried that.</p>
  <p> _Note_:<br />
    You should not attempt to recall those things from memory, but rather attempt 
    them again while taking contemporaneous notes. Post information from those 
    notes, instead of from vague recollections and reconstructions of events in 
    your memory. Thank you.</p>

<p>[[jbakshi]] - My installed sarge is still in testing mode that's why I have 
  explicitly mention * sarge(testing) * I have no broad-band to upgrade my system. 
  Dial-up is too poor.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Automatically You have given answear of a question which was asked latter 
    -:) Yes, discover-modprobe automatically loads kernel module for the discover_detected 
    H/W . </p>

   # previously crashed the machine:</pre>
  <p> But I am still looking for the configuration_file which define how the command 
    *discover* detects buses.</p>
  <p>I thought this issue is also related with the same doscover_configuration_file 
    but now I have the answear. please see below</p>
  <p>I have Epson C20SX parallel inkjet printer.</p>
  <p>running *hwinfo --printer* detects my printer correctly. below is the o/p 
    of the command</p>

  <p>I know all this.</p>
  <p>[no broadband]</p>
  <p>&gt; hence *that installed sarge in my box is still a testing release*</p>
  <p>i knew what you were saying, but it's was somewhat misleading to refer to 
    sarge as the testing branch. Irrespective of the state of your system's software

    various things, etc. You may recall that _that_ was my advice. </p>
  <p>I said you weren't electing to follow my advice because you weren't doing 
    that. So far, you still aren't. But that is still my suggestion. To be more 
    explicit: You started out by defining your problem as &quot;discover&quot; 
    configuration -- but there was actually no reason to believe that was the 
    case. Therefore, you were asking the wrong question. Start over, please.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Thomas] - I'm jumping in here to say that &quot;discover&quot; is a real PITA. 
  It's the most annoying package ever, and should die after installation. It conflicts 
  no end with anything held in /etc/modules, and actively disrupts hotplug for 
  things like USB devices.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You don't need it for anything post-installation. If you somehow think you 
    do, you're wrong.</p>

  solve a doubt about linux H/W detection</font></h3>
<p>J. Bakshi (j.bakshi at icmail.net)<br />
  Wed Mar 29 04:19:05 PST 2006</p>
<p> <strong>Dear list,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please help me to solve a doubt. In linux world *discover* *hwinfo* 
  *kudzu* are the H/W detection technology. Do they directly probe the *raw* piece 
  of H/W to collect information about it ? what about lspci, lsusb, lshw ?? Do 
  they also provide H/W information by probing the *raw* piece of H/W or just 
  retrieve the information which are already provided by some H/W detection technology 
  as mentioned above ?? kindly cc to me.</strong></p>
<p>[Thomas] - Not as such. They tend to query the kernel which itself has &quot;&quot;probed&quot;&quot; 
  the devices beforehand.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&gt; lsusb, lshw ?? Do they also provide H/W information by probing the<br />
    &gt; *raw* piece of H/W or just retrieve the information which are already<br />
    &gt; provided by some H/W detection technology as mentioned above ??</p>
  <p>What difference does it make to you if it has or has not? I'll reiterate 
    once more that you DO NOT need discover at all. In fact, it's considered harmful 
    [1]</p>
  <p>[1] Just by me, for what that's worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[jbakshi]] - Nothing as such but my interest to know those technologies, specially 
  from those who have already used those and quite aware the advantage and disadvante. 
  Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>[[jbakshi]] - Just find out from man page. *lspci -H1* or *lspci -H2* do direct 
  H/W access. *lspci -M* enable bus mapping mode</p>
<p>[[Kapil]] - In case that makes you feel happier Thomas, I saw a mail (which 
  I can't find right now) that indicates debian-installer team is in agreement 
  with you. However, the replacement &quot;udev/hotplug/coldplug&quot; may also 
  make you unhappy :)</p>
<p>[[[Thomas]]] - Ugh. :) Udev is a fad that perpetuates the dick-waving wars 
  of &quot;Oooh, look at me, I only have three entries in /dev. You have 50000, 
  so mine's much better&quot;. It has absolutely *no* real advantage over a static 
  /dev tree whatsoever.</p>
<p>[[[[Pedro]]]] - What about the symlink magic explained <a href="http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html">here</a> 
  (http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html)?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>To hotplug different scanners, digital cameras or other usb devices in no 
    particular other, and make them appear always in the same known point inside 
    the filesystem, looks like a good feature. How would that be done without 
    udev?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[Thomas]]]]] - You can use a shell-script to do it. I did something similar 
  a few years ago.</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Are you sure, Thomas? Not that I'm a huge fan of Udev - it smacks 
  too much of magic and unnecessary complexity - but I like the idea of devices 
  being created as they become necessary. Expecting some Linux newbie to know 
  enough to create '/dev/sr*' or '/dev/audio' when the relevant piece of software 
  throws a cryptic message is unreasonable. Having them created on the fly could 
  eliminate a subset of problems.</p>
<p>[[[[[Thomas]]]]] - Well, pretty much. At least you have some kind of assurance 
  that the device &quot;exists&quot; whether it's actully attached to some form 
  of physical device or not. Plus, one the permissions are set on that device 
  and you have the various group ownerships sorted out... it's trivial.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I realise Udev does all of this as well, but you have to have various node 
    mappings and layered complexity not observed with a static /dev tree. Then 
    there's all sorts of shenanigans with things like initrds and the line for 
    some kernels. It's just not worth the effort to effectivelty allow a &quot;ls 
    /dev&quot; listing to show up without the use of a pager. ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Well, actually, now that I'm thinking about it - so could a '/dev' 
  that's pre-stuffed with 50,000 entries. Hmm, I wonder why that's not the default 
  - since, theoretically, these things take no space other than their own inode 
  entry.</p>

  real BSD&quot;</h3>
<p class="editorial">The following originally came under the thread "Please solve a doubt about 
  linux H/W detection". Given the drift, I've renamed this subthread for benefit of findability.</p>
<p><strong>OBTW - I would like to get my hands around the throat of the person 
  who decided that '/dev/dsp' and '/dev/mixer' are unnecessary in OS/X. Really, 
  it would only be for a few moments... is that too much to ask?</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Installing X11+xmms on the latest OS/X is a HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS, 
  for anyone who's interested.)</strong></p>
<p>[Thomas] - That's not the only thing that's unneccesary in OS/X from what I 
  hear. :)</p>
<p>[[Ben]]- [rolling eyes] Don't get me started. &quot;Just like real BSD&quot;... 
  yeah, *RIGHT*.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>At least they have Perl, Python, ssh, tar, and find (well, some freakin' 
    weird version of 'find', but at least it's there) pre-installed. That part 
    keeps me sane when dealing with Macs. Last night, a friend of mine who uses 
    one asked my opinion of various $EXPENSIVE_BACKUP_PROGRAMS for his Mac. My 
    response was &quot;why would you want to actually spend *money* on this? You 
    have 'tar', 'cpio', and 'pax' already installed.&quot; Made him happy as a 
    lark; 'tar cvzf' was right up his alley even though he'd never so much as 
    seen an xterm before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Kapil]]] - There is also &quot;fink&quot; which (in conjunction with &quot;xterm&quot;) 
  is a lifesaver when it comes to turning a Mac into something almost normal. 
  (For those not in the know---&quot;fink&quot; is &quot;apt&quot; for OS/X which 
  actually uses a .deb packaging format as well).</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This alone makes OS/X far-far better than its predecessors. Sample of earlier 
    conversion with typical Mac user whose computer I wished to use for a brief 
    while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Well... more or less. As in &quot;more broken or less useful&quot;. 
  You get a subset of the APT utilities for the command line, as well as Fink 
  Commander which is a GUI; &quot;apt-get&quot;, or at least the repository behind 
  it, is badly broken since at least a quarter (IME) of the &quot;available&quot; 
  packages have unsatisfiable dependencies. It also throws persistent errors (something 
  like &quot;/usr/foo/bar/zotz/cc1plus not executable&quot;) which can't be fixed 
  by installing any of the available software. As well, &quot;apt-cache search&quot; 
  provides a meager subset of the listings shown at Fink.org - e.g., there are 
  several dozen OpenOffice packages shown at the latter, whereas the former has 
  never heard of OO.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Fink Commander is even more &quot;wonderful&quot;: when you hit the 'Upgrade 
    Fink Commander' button, it breaks itself _and_ the entire APT kit due to a 
    stupid interface error (the CLI app that it's wrapping blocks on a question 
    - you can see it in the dialog area - and there's no way to feed its STDIN; 
    all you can do is kill the GUI, which interrupts the process half-way through 
    installation.) To fix it, you have to remove the '/sw' directory - which contains 
    *all the software you ever installed with Fink* - and start from scratch. 
    That's the recommended procedure. Cute, eh?</p>
  <p>Building a compiler toolchain on a Mac with Fink, BTW, is impossible. They've 
    got GCC - both 3.3 and 4.0 - but literally almost *nothing* else that's required.</p>
  <p>In short, pretty bloody awful. It kinda smells like *nix, even sorta resembles 
    it... but falls way short when there's any real work to be done.</p>

<p>[[Bob]] - Thanks for taking time to have a look. I'm wondering if I'm missing

</blockquote>
<p>[Francis] - Is that because text 1/6th of an inch high is too small for you 
  to read, or because 12pt-text on your display is not 1/6th of an inch high?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>If the latter, you may see some benefit from telling your X how many dots-per-inch 
    your screen actually uses. For example, a 19&quot; diagonal on a 4:3 aspect 
    ratio monitor (a TFT screen, for example) means the horizontal size is about 
    15.2 inches; if you display at 1600x1200 pixels, that's about 105 pixels per 
    inch. </p>
  <p>If X then believes you're displaying at 100 pixels per inch, everything measured 
    in inches will be about 5% smaller than it should be. For text at the edge 
    of legibility, that's enough to push it over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Ben]] - Not only that, it'll usually result in a bad case of the jaggies 
  (aliasing) in text when X tries to interpolate that fractional size difference. 
  This definitely _will_ make marginally-legible text unreadable.</p>
<p>[[Bob]] - Well, probably a bit of both. I can not read 1/6&quot; lettering 
  anymore. Used to ... but that was when I was younger can could do a lot of things 
  I can't now. Of course, I could break down and get glasses to see the screen, 
  but I'm resisting. I already need to put on cheaters when I read a book, etc 
  (mind you, I seem to manage not to badly in bright light). Ahh, the joys of 
  aging. But as someone told me: aging beats the alternatives.</p>
<p>[Francis] - &quot;xdpyinfo&quot; will tell you what X thinks the current dimensions 
  and resolution are. If they don't match what your ruler tells you, you should 
  consider reconfiguring.</p>
<p>[[Ben]] - [Nod] If there's one thing I've learned from playing around with 
  all the X resolution configuration options, it's exactly that. As a testimonial 
  from the positive side of things, once I got X resolution properly synched up 
  with the actual screen size, I was able to switch to 1280x1024 without any problems. 
  Previously, that mode produced unreadable text in many applications. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>(Yes, I'm aware that I could tweak ~/.gtkrc, etc. I found it ridiculous that 
    I would have to - and, once I got X configured correctly, I didn't have to. 
    I like for the world to make sense, at least sometimes. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Bob]]] - And I learn that the interface between user programs and X is hopelessly 
  broken. Now, we are not going to fix that little issue :)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I have discovered one thing in Firefox: in the menu bar there is a &lt;view&gt;&lt;page 
    style&gt; which (I think) lets you diable the css stuff (not clear, but I 
    think that is what it does). At least, doing that I can get rid of all overlaying 
    text.</p>
  <p>But, the interesting thing is that now matter what I do the page I was trying 
    to view presents itself with overlaying text. If I turn off the min. text 
    size completely I can get text too small for any mortal to read, but it still 
    overlays. I've also installed additional fonts (namely some msfonts collection), 
    but that doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>
  <p>Oh well, perhaps we should just let ugly find its own home :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Francis] - If the problem is broken absolute positioning code, the quick answer 
  is to use a browser which ignores absolute positioning code.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don't see anything obvious in the firefox about:config page to disable 
    that bit of their rendering or layout engine, though. If you accept that (a) 
    you will see their content in a layout they did not expect or desire (which 
    is already the case); and (b) you *will* see their content (which is not already 
    the case), use a browser with CSS support which tries to be perfect at the 
    &quot;ignore it completely&quot; end of the scale, rather than any which try 
    to get to the &quot;implement it all correctly&quot; end. I'll mention w3m 
    and dillo, but I'm sure you'll be able to find one that suits you. (These 
    other browsers do have their own quirks and configuration requirements, so 
    depending on how your distribution set things up, you may have some testing 
    and learning to do before things work the way you want them to. And it's also 
    possible that things *won't* work the way you want them to, no matter what.)</p>
  <p>w3m -- the content seems all there, but the links are a bit tough to follow 
    (because of the design choices they made: &lt;a href=link&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; 
    src=img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn't leave much clickable space for the link).</p>
  <p>dillo -- the content seems all there, and the images seem all there. Just 
    not both where the designer might have hoped. Keep scrolling down...</p>
  <p>For contrast: my firefox, in my &quot;normal&quot; config -- some text/text 
    overlap, but nothing major obviously unreadable; with 16pt minimum text -- 
    lots of unreadable bits because of text/text and text/image overlapping.</p>

<p>[Ben] - There's a large number of pages on the Net that are badly broken WRT 
  layout; however, over time, I've discovered (much to my surprise) that<br />
  *other*, less- (or even un) broken pages exist as well. Based on this amazing 
  fact, I've developed a strategy: as soon as I encounter the former, I do a bit 
  of clicking, or even typing, and I'm soon looking at the latter. :)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Seriously - truly bad layout can make a page nearly unusable, which is much 
    like not having the info in the first place. Given that much of the data on 
    the Net is available in multiple places, I consider finding an alternate site 
    - rather than trying to curse my way through</p>
  <pre class="code">
  {
     font: 3px bold italic &quot;Bloody Unreadable&quot;;
     text-background: bright-white;
     color: white;
  }</pre>
  <p>that's half-hidden behind a blinking yellow &quot;THIS SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!&quot; 
    GIF - to be a perfectly valid strategy, unless the info on that specific site 
    is truly unique. For me, it saves lots of wear and tear - and time.</p>
  <p>The above may seem obvious as hell to some, but lots and lots of people tend 
    to get hyperfocused on Must Fix This Problem instead of looking at alternatives 
    - I've done it myself, lots of times, and still catch myself doing it on occasion. 
    Larger context is something that usually bears consideration.</p>
  <p> My own default browsing technique consists of firing off my &quot;google&quot; 
    script, which invokes &quot;w3m&quot; and points it at Google.com with a properly-constructed 
    query. I page through the hits that Google provides, search until I find what 
    I want, and - if I really need a graphical browser to examine the content, 
    which is only true in about 5% of the cases - I hit '2-shift-m', which fires 
    up Mozilla and feeds it the current URL (since I've set &quot;Second External 
    Browser&quot; in 'w3m' to 'mozilla'.) I very, *very* rarely have to deal with 
    really bad layout since text mode prevents many problems by its very nature.</p>
  <p>(If the page really *is* unique, _and_ is badly broken, _and_ you really 
    need to view it in a graphical browser, _and_ you have to keep going back 
    there, Mozilla and Firefox have a plugin that allows you to &quot;edit&quot; 
    the HTML of a given site and remembers your edits locally. Whenever you go 
    to that page, your edits are auto-applied. Unfortunately, I don't recall the 
    name of the plugin... Jimmy, I think I learned about it from you. Do you recall 
    the name?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Jimmy]] - Mozilla and Firefox let you override the CSS for any page you want 
  (user.css IIRC); there's also Greasemonkey for Firefox, which lets you <br />
  run your own javascript on any page.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Recently, I came across something that allows you to edit a web page and 
    save your edits as a Greasemonkey script: I'll pass on the link as soon as 
    I can dig it up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Predrag]]] - Platypus(<a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org">http://platypus.mozdev.org</a>)? 
  I also like Web Developer(<a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">http://www.chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/</a>)</p>
<p>[[[[Jimmy]]]] - That's it!</p>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&gt; &gt; I think the problem is one of expected font and font size. I use 
    a <br />
    &gt; &gt; fairly large min. size ... but don't know if this is the problem 
    or not.</p>
  <p>It would often be a problem, yes. Many sites are laid out so that there's 
    no room for the expansion necessary to accomodate larger text.<br />
    <br />
    ( http://www.yahkkingsgate.homestead.com/) Looks totally fine in 'w3m'. Oh, 
    and if I want to view it in a larger font, I simply Ctrl-right-click my xterm 
    and set the fontsize to 'Large', or even 'Huge'.</p>
  <p>This is why I prefer to use the 'Tab' key in 'w3m' rather than clicking the 
    links: it never misses, no matter how small the link. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Bob]]] - Yes, reformatting and rewriting broken code is always an option 
  :)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>But, really, the &quot;problem&quot; is that a guy using a cheap (relatively) 
    out-of-the-box windows system can view these sites just fine (I'm assuming 
    here since I have not tried it). And, one fellow here says it views fine with 
    his Firefox. So, I have to assume that something on my setup is buggering 
    up things.</p>
  <p>I get lots of overlays when viewing the site. Nope, not the end of the world 
    by any means. But, this is not the only one and I guess I was in an easily-annoyed 
    mood yesterday :)</p>
  <p>Since starting this thread I have added extra TT fonts, played with my resolutions 
    and the font settings in firefox. Gotten some &quot;interesting&quot; results, 
    but none which fix the problem.</p>
  <p>Oh well, life does go on without reading badly formatted html!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Karl-Heinz]]] - opera also has that option of using user-css -- which means 
  switching off the regular css and having basically no styling at first. Then 
  you can swtich on some default CSS sheets like high-contrast b/w or w/b,... 
  This helps on many sites to make them quite readable and usable -- if the site 
  works without css that is. If they broke the layout so badly that the page (links,...) 
  won't work unstyled I usually refuse to stay at that site. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> And yes: I also have a rather large min. font size and that *does* lead 
    to trouble when boxes stay fixed but the text gets (much) larger then intended 
    by the designer. I'm a strong advocate of fluid box layout which adapts to 
    font changes ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Bob]]]] - I'm quite convinced that being able to specify absolute positioning 
  or absolute font size in html is a dumb thing. No idea why people think it <br />
  is necessary. Interesting that at one time html was supposed to be browser agnostic.</p>

<p> <strong>The fat lady will not sing. Actually, no one on the opera stage will

<p><strong>I just upgraded my internet connection from a very slow dialup connection

  you can get you get happy real fast.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Everything seems to work just dandy. Everything except the Opera browser.

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Heck, I can't even get the Opera help pages.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have tried disabling all my firewall settings, but that has no effect. 
  Besides, that is silly since firefox and konqueror both work just fine. I just 
  tried lynx and it works fine as well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>SOoooooo ... any idea why opera is being such a pain? BTW, I had version 
  8 installed and just tried a 9.0 beta. I've dumped my .opera file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I suspect that there is a proxy or firewall issue, but am no expert 
  in this. Suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>[Neil] - Have you followed the advice above? Does opera have a proxy server 
  setup (if you click F12 is there a tick by &quot;enable proxy servers&quot;)?</p>
<p>[[BobV]] - Thanks Neil. Yes, I have tried that. Just checked again, and there 
  is NO tick beside that option. Just to test, I clicked on the option, but the 
  tick does not appear. Which is probably just as well since I don't have a proxy 
  server set up.</p>
<p>[[[Neil]]] - The error messages you were getting sound like those I got when 
  I had Opera set up to use privoxy and it wasn't running. It seems that network 
  access is not an issue, as you say konqueror and firefox are both working OK, 
  but it sounds as though opera is having a problem with network access.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>As it's a beta, you may be best asking on one of the opera newsgroups hosted 
    at news.opera.com</p>
  <p>Sorry I couldn't help more.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - A couple of things to try:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1) Fire up a web server on your machine and try surfing to http://localhost 
    - even if you somehow, somewhere magically created a firewall without knowing 
    about it, you should still be able to get through to your own host.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[BobV]] - Nope. Not on any of my browsers. I assume that is since I don't 
  have apache (or other) server running. But that should not effect web access?</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Bob, you've got to read _every_ part of what's been written. If 
  you don't fire up a web server, then you can't expect to surf to 'localhost' 
  - there won't be a web server there. It wasn't a question of affecting web access 
  but of testing your browser's ability to connect to a server *known* not to 
  be behind a firewall.</p>
<p>[[[[BobV]]]] - Opps. Yes &quot;web server&quot;. Okay ... I don't need one 
  on my system and I've not time to go though and install a full blown server. 
  Is there something simple I can install just to test this?</p>
<p>[[[[[Karl-Heinz]]]]] - what do you use for printing? If its a cups server, 
  try: http://localhost:631/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>2) Look at a local file. I.e., try a URI like file:///etc/hosts - that will 
    tell you if your browser is capable of rendering anything at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[BobV]] - Yes, that works with everything, including opera. I can view pages 
  stored on my system with opera.</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - OK, so rendering works - that's a plus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&gt; I have tried disabling all my firewall settings, but that has no effect. 
    <br />
    &gt; Besides, that is silly since firefox and konqueror both work just fine. 
    <br />
    &gt; I just tried lynx and it works fine as well.</p>
  <p>Well, it's obviously in Opera itself. However, whether it's something hosed 
    in the settings - shouldn't be, but you never know - or the app itself is 
    dead, you can't really tell without experimenting.</p>
  <p>&gt; SOoooooo ... any idea why opera is being such a pain? BTW, I had version 
    <br />
    &gt; 8 installed and just tried a 9.0 beta. I've dumped my .opera file.</p>
  <p>Hmmm, *beta*. Dangerous waters you swim in, Bob... :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[BobV]] - Well, remember that I did have a non-beta installed. That didn't 
  work either. So, that's when I tired the newer version with the same problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Ben] - If you really want to see all the files that Opera sources as it starts 
  up - which may be a bit more than just that .opera file - you should run 'strace' 
  on it and look for &quot;open&quot; calls, like so:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre class="code">   strace -o opera.strace /usr/bin/opera</pre>
  <p>or wherever your executable is. Then, open &quot;opera.strace&quot; and search 
    for lines starting with &quot;open&quot;:</p>
  <pre class="code">   grep '^open' opera.strace | less</pre>
  <p>You may find some interesting clues in there.</p>
  <p>Conversely, if you just want the thing to work (as opposed to fixing the 
    problem), then just revert to the last working version you used. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[BobV]] - okay. Did this with -eopen and -econnect. But, nothing obvious shows 
  up.</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - What do you mean by &quot;nothing obvious&quot;? I'm certain that 
  there are _some_ files that Opera is opening as it starts up.</p>
<p>[[[[BobV]]]] - I meant &quot;nothing obvious TO ME&quot;. Maybe you can see 
  something in the <a href="misc/lg_mail/opera1.txt">attached log file</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[[BobV]] - I think I'll just be content to use firefox :)</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Well, as I've said - you have to know what your goal is. If it's 
  just to use a browser, then there are plenty of options (including using Firefox.) 
  If you're trying to figure out the problem with Opera, then you need to do some 
  troubleshooting - which is what we've all been pointing you toward. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[[Thomas]] - This is why strace has an '-e' flag:</p>
<pre class="code">   strace -eopen -o opera.strace opera</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>It's a pity Opera isn't dumping core, as that would have been much easier 
    to remedy. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Neil]]] - I would have thought connect would be more interesting than open. 
</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - I see both as useful, certainly - it would be interesting to 
  see which 'connect' fails - but I think the 'open' calls should come first in 
  the troubleshooting stack. If there's some sort of a configuration file that's 
  left over from the previous install of Opera, it would be a good idea to &quot;neutralize&quot; 
  it while testing. Also, seeing that a given 'connect' fails rarely tells you 
  why it has done so, whereas an 'open' failure always reports the reason.</p>
<p>[[[Neil]]] - Also /usr/bin/opera is a script on my system, so the -f option 
  to follow children would be essential to get anything useful from strace. </p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Ah - good point. I've never used Opera under Linux, so no way 
  for me to know, but definitely a good thing to keep in mind. As well, it may 
  make<br />
  sense to just run the executable that the script calls; I recall a Mozilla startup 
  script (the last time that I installed Mozilla from a tarball) that was seriously 
  broken, but the browser itself ran just fine.</p>
<p>[[BobV]] - [Quoting Ben]</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>Now Opera. 1st time I tried it I got the same &quot;can't access&quot; error. 
    Well, I'm pretty sure I did. I just tried it again so I could copy down the 
    error and it worked fine. Well, as far as accessing the main cups menu. I 
    can go though the various cups options in opera, until I go to the download 
    software item which brings up:</p>
  <pre class="code">
  You tried to access the address http://www.cups.org/, which is currently 
  unavailable. Please make sure that the Web address (URL) is correctly

  <p> Does this help track down the problem???</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[Brian]]]]]]] - It sure feels like a proxy problem to me. Works fine 
  on localhost stuff, but not out to the world? When Firefox works to the outside 
  world? I will go to the wall on this one - let's see if I can get Opera running 
  on this Gentoo AMD64 setup...</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>{cue Jeopardy music}</p>
  <p>Okay, emerge search shows Opera 8.5 available via portage. Installing pulls 
    in app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-qtlibs-2.2 (needed because of the AMD64-ness)</p>
  <p>And here we go ... http://portal.opera.com/startup/</p>
  <p>That just works (tm).</p>
  <p>Now: In Firefox (which you say is working), Select from the menu Edit -&gt; 
    Preferences. On the General tab, click the connection settings button. What 
    does it say there? Of the 4 options (Direct connection, Auto-detect proxy, 
    Manual proxy, Automatic proxy), which radio button is enabled? If it says 
    that Direct Connection is the way, well then. I'm confused. If. OTOH, one 
    of the others is selected, and you can translate those settings to Opera's 
    Tools -&gt; Preferences: Advanced Tab, Network, click on Proxy Servers dialog, 
    then maybe this will have been some help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]] - Yup, &quot;Direct Connection&quot;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I'm confused as well :)</p>
  <p>CHecking (again) opera under Tools-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Network 
    it says to click for setting proxies if not connected directly to the internet. 
    Double checking that, these fields are all empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[Brian]]]]]]] - Odd that lynx works, if proxying is on. What does</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre class="code">   echo $http_proxy</pre>
  <p>yield, from the commmand line?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]] - Nothing. Nor does &quot;set | grep -i htt&quot;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Just to summarize some things:</p>
  <p>- this all worked just fine before I upgraded from dialup to my new connection. 
    I had a 8.x version installed (which worked fine). When that didn't work with 
    the new connection I dl'd 9.0 beta ... but the results are identical.</p>
  <p>- every other net aware program I've used so far (Thunderbird, Firefox, Bittorrent, 
    gtk-gnutella, ntpd ...) all work just fine.</p>
  <p>- the only things I did when the new &quot;modem&quot; was installed was 
    to use the Mandriva wizard to set up the ethernet. As soon as the connection 
    was established, everything worked. The only thing I didn't need to do was 
    to dial in.</p>
  <p>My only other GUESS is that it is something to do with my connection. The 
    broadband connection is Ka satellite. I did check with the provider, but they 
    had nothing on the help system for Opera problems.</p>
  <p>Also, I've checked a number of web references and did find some stuff similar, 
    but they appear to be of the windows + proxy type.</p>

    Try the same address, same behaviour. Try another address and you get the 
    &quot;unavailable&quot; error message. From that point on accessing anything 
    external brings the &quot;unavailable&quot; message.</p>
  <p>I'm really starting to think it is a network problem due to my satellite 
    connection. But, that really does seem silly. Doesn't it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[Ben]]]]]]] - Well, it can't be the network since the other browsers 
  use the network without any problems. It sounds as though the code that does 
  the<br />
  socket-related functions in Opera is broken (which makes Neil's suggestion of 
  checking the 'connect' calls a better guess than mine. :)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just out of curiosity, try this:</p>
  <pre class="code">   strace -f -o opera.strace -e trace=connect `which opera`</pre>
  <p>The resulting file should be pretty short - and might show exactly where 
    Opera is falling down. If it does, that would be a bug report that Opera developers 
    might be very happy to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]] - Okay. <a href="misc/lg_mail/opera2.txt">Here it 
  is</a>. Hope it means more to you than to me :)</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[Ben]]]]]]]]] - </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*That* looks like the dude. When Opera makes that call to the X socket - 
    which, BTW, you should check to make sure that it exists and is usable:</p>
  <pre class="code">   ben at Fenrir:~$ ls -l /tmp/.X11-unix/X0

   unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     5193     /tmp/.X11-unix/X0
   unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     5191     /tmp/.X11-unix/X0
   unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     5177     /tmp/.X11-unix/X0</pre>
  <p>- that subprocess in Opera dies (perhaps it's killed by some kernel process 
    for trying to corrupt the stack? That's just a SWAG on my part, and you'd 
    need to do a full 'strace' and look at the calls that would have been between 
    18802 and 18810.) I would venture to say that it's internal to Opera rather 
    than the library that does the 'connect' call; there's lots of other stuff 
    that would break if 'connect' itself was at all buggy.</p>

<p>[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]] - Thanks again for taking time to work though this little 
  mystery.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[Ben]]]]]]]]] - You're welcome, Bob. [grin] I have lots of fun with 
  this kind of detective work; helps me improve my own troubleshooting skills 
  for when I need them.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]]]] - Just to close this thread out :) I have reinstalled 
  my linux distro (Mandriva 2006), downloaded Opera 8.5 and it connects/runs just 
  fine. Honestly, I have no idea what the original problem was ... but I suspect 
  that something broke when I changed from a dialup/ppp system to using the new 
  connection (satellite with a LAN modem). I really do wish I knew what the problem 
  really was ... but that'll have to remain one of the many mysteries of life!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>[Neil] - The entire functioning of the web browser is way too big a topic. 
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To address more narrowly the topic of how the browser knows to use the PPP 
    link, the short answer is that it doesn't. It communicates via the sockets 
    library, which is an interface to the kernel's TCP/IP stack. It just calls 
    a library function, which requests a communication channel (socket) to a given 
    IP address (I've skipped DNS lookups here). The kernel then has the job of 
    routing the message. The kernel looks up, which link to use in it's routing 
    table. At some point before this the PPP script should have added an entry 
    to the routing table, indicating that connections to the internet can be made 
    via the PPP connection that has been established.</p>
  <p>It's a bit more complicated than that, but I'm no expert on routing tables. 
    I dare say googling for linux routing tables will come up with all the information 
    you need and more.</p>
  <p>I believe the command &quot;ip route&quot; is used to examine and manipulate 
    routing tables in modern linux distributions.</p>
  <p>&gt; 2&gt; If apart from the above mentioned PPP link my system is<br />
    &gt; also connected to the ethernet which in turn is connected<br />
    &gt; to the internet then which link would the web browser use<br />
    &gt; to get connected to internet - the PPP or the ethernet ?</p>
  <p>I guess that would depend on what's in the routing table.</p>

  <p>Hi, Prashant -</p>
  <p>First, I *strongly* suggest that you read a list etiquette FAQ before posting 
    to any more lists; your cross-posting is a violation of basic etiquette, and 
    is going to offend a lot of people. I'm sure that you did it because you don't 
    know any better, but if you're going to participate in forums on the Internet, 
    you definitely need to learn some basic protocol. Here's ours, with a number 
    of links to good resources elsewhere:</p>
  <p><a href="../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a> 
  </p>
  <p>Incidentally, I suggest that you revise your estimate of Thomas Adams' reply 
    to you; he was actually being quite kind and helpful. You'll know what I mean 
    if you get responses from any other lists, which generally tend to come down 
    with great big heavy boots on people who violate protocol.</p>

  <p>The simple answer is that it doesn't. A web browser, just like most other 
    network applications, connects to a _socket_ - a virtual connection that consists 
    of port and an IP. This kind of modularization (i.e., applications don't need 
    to &quot;know&quot; anything about the underlying network protocols, while 
    the network doesn't &quot;care&quot; about applications) is one of the main 
    features of networking that makes it so robust.</p>
  <p>I'd suggest that you take a look at, study, and understand in depth the basic 
    four-layer TCP/IP stack (search for it at, e.g., Google.) This will give you 
    a better understanding of this type of separation.</p>
  <p>&gt; Could you explain to me the entire functioning of the<br />
    &gt; web browser and the corressponding system files involved.</p>
  <p>Well, no. If this is what you _really_ want - and I think that you've mistaken 
    the critical path for understanding the solution to your problem - then you 
    need to download the sources for your favorite browser and start reading. 
    However, I suspect that once you understand the networking end, you'll see 
    that it's unnecessary in the first place.</p>
  <p>&gt; 2&gt; If apart from the above mentioned PPP link my system is<br />
    &gt; also connected to the ethernet which in turn is connected<br />
    &gt; to the internet then which link would the web browser use<br />
    &gt; to get connected to internet - the PPP or the ethernet ?</p>
  <p>It all depends on your routing table, which is (usually) configured at connection 
    time. For example, if I have an Ethernet connection up, then make a PPP connection, 
    and have PPP configured with &quot;defaultroute&quot; and &quot;replacedefaultroute&quot;, 
    then the PPP route will replace the previous one. I'm sure that you can imagine 
    some of the possibilities for the above scenario based on the information 
    I just gave you.</p>
  <p>&gt; I'll be really grateful to you if you could help me out with<br />
    &gt; the same. Looking forward to your quick reply,</p>
  <p>Erm... this is another one of those things you want to avoid doing on a list. 
    &quot;Quick reply&quot; implies a degree of arrogance on the part of the person 
    requesting it - unless they're willing to pay for such &quot;service&quot;.</p>

    you directly, as that would be consultancy, and I don't (yet (thankfully) 
    charge for that). If you fail to reply to tag at lists.linuxgazette.net, I 
    shan't answer you.</p>
  <p>&gt; I recieved your mail and realised that I have to give you a complete<br />
    &gt; description of what I know and what my problem is. Well to begin</p>
  <p>Excellent. :)</p>
  <p>&gt; with, I've set up PPP dial-up internet connection (on my linux<br />
    &gt; installed machine) by writing a script. As a part of this script<br />
    &gt; writing I had to modify a few system files and create a few of them.<br />
    &gt; To give you a precise idea I'm sending in a list of the files as an<br />
    &gt; attachment.</p>
  <p>That really wasn't necessary, but thank you for doing so.</p>
  <p>&gt; A stepwise description of what I understand is the procedure is as<br />
    &gt; follows : <br />
    &gt;<br />
    &gt; 1&gt; I dial into the ISP's(BSNL) host/router via modem.<br />
    &gt; 2&gt; I get authenticated for username and password as a physical<br />
    &gt; connection is established between me and the ISP's host. <br />
    &gt; 3&gt; This link is then disconnected ensuring that the modem is not reset 
    and<br />
    &gt; then the PPP is been started at the ISP's server end. </p>
  <p>The modem isn't &quot;reset&quot; as such -- it still provides the mechanism 
    of modulating and demodulating the signals.</p>
  <p>&gt; 4&gt; Then the PPP is being initiated at my end and a PPP link is been 
    setup. <br />
    &gt; 5&gt; Via the (-defaultroute) option and the gateways of the ISP I can 
    now<br />
    &gt; get connected to the internet. <br />
    &gt; 6&gt; In this entire process primary and the secondary nameservers (specified 
    in /etc/resolv.conf) of the ISP have got special significance as they help 
    in ]<br />
    &gt; host-name-address resolution.<br />
    &gt;<br />
    &gt; The very fact that I've been connected to the 'net can be confirmed<br />
    &gt; by pinging any site say www.google.com or directly opening it in the<br />
    &gt; web browser (say mozilla). Also the exchange of LCP packets can be<br />
    &gt; observed.</p>
  <p>Well, pinging a site and trying to view a site's webpage are two different 
    processes in effect. Ping sends out a certain data packet -- an ICMP request. 
    When you look at a web browser, you're reliant on various ports to connect 
    and talk to processes listening on it, etc. This might not always be possible, 
    despite the fact you can still ping the domain.</p>
  <p>&gt; Now my Question is that how does the web browser get to know that<br />
    &gt; it has to follow the PPP link set up by us to get the URL request<br />
    &gt; satisfied for the user ? (if what I'm thinking is correct). There</p>
  <p>Because your routing table (see 'man route') details how to connect everything 
    together. I'll refer you back to the linuxgazette in this instance. Google 
    for &quot;subnetting and routing 101&quot;. That explains all of that side 
    of things in more detail than I care to remember.</p>
  <p>&gt; obviously has to be certain O.S assistance or system settings that<br />
    &gt; direct the web browser in that direction. </p>
  <p>No, not at all. OS has nothing to do with it -- you might connect to an ISS 
    server or Apache, but what difference does that make to you? What happens 
    is that your browser (when you click on a link) has to translate the http:// 
    URI from a domain name to an IP address. Connections (or routes as we like 
    to think of them) at the transmission level use numbers to talk to one another 
    -- DNS provides a convenience service to translate IP to hostname, and vice 
    versa. Typically, your ISP will have DNS so you don't have to worry. </p>
  <p>Of course, as I mentioned in my previous email to you (you did read it, I 
    assume?) you're rarely going to go from A --&gt; B directly. Instead you'll 
    connect to a series of computers to reach B. And you can see for yourself 
    how this is achieved:</p>
  <pre class="code">   traceroute google.com</pre>
  <p>... for instance will tell you how many hops it took to reach google.com</p>
  <p>Once the connection has been reached, Apache, at the other end on the remote 
    server will send back a request detailing whatever content it needs to, to 
    satisfy the URL you clicked on. Note that computer &quot;B&quot; undergoes 
    the same process in terms of DNS, etc., to reach your computer.</p>
  <p>&gt; So what is entire stepwise<br />
    &gt; procedure that takes place and what all system files help the web<br />
    &gt; browser to get on to the PPP link. (I hope I'm being a bit more<br />
    &gt; clear in my doubts now.)</p>
  <p>Well, it depends how deep you want to go. I suggest you read up on &quot;Bind 
    and DNS&quot; by O'Reilly.</p>
  <p>&gt; Now I have one more doubt. Suppose apart from the above mentioned<br />
    &gt; connection I'm also connected to an ethernet which in turn has got<br />
    &gt; internet access. so the web browser has got two different ways of<br />
    &gt; handling the URL request. Either by the dial-up PPP connection or<br />
    &gt; by the ethernet link to the internet. So which one would it use and<br />
    &gt; why?</p>
  <p>Both are used implicitly. Look at your routing table -- you'll probably find 
    you have a non-public routable IP address that your ethernet card (or modem, 
    or router, or what have you) is being a gateway for -- hence you have NAT.</p>
  <p>&gt; Kindly try to help me by sending in your views about whether I'm<br />
    &gt; thinking on the right lines or not and if I am then what is the<br />
    &gt; solution to the above mentioned problem.</p>
  <p>&quot;Solution&quot;? I don't see a problem, other than wanting to have a 
    concept explained. You'll notice I have been deliberately vague in some areas. 
    What you're asking is for a book to be sent for you essentially -- the subject 
    area is _vast_. I hope though that you have sufficient information.</p>

<p>PRASHANT BADALA (prashant_badala at yahoo.co.in)<br />
  Mon Mar 20 09:36:00 PST 2006
<p> <strong>Hi everyone,<br />
  I'm Prashant Badala, a final year Computer Engineering student. I'm trying to 
  study and program the D-BUS as a part of my project. Hence I was going through 
  a book that says -</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>===========================================================<br />
    The D-BUS C API<br />
    Using D-BUS starts with including its header:<br />
    #include &lt;dbus/dbus.h&gt;<br />
    <br />
    The first thing you probably want to do is connect to <br />
    an existing bus. Recall from our initial D-BUS discussion <br />
    that D-BUS provides two buses, the session and the <br />
    system bus. Let's connect to the system bus:<br />
    DBusError error;<br />
    DBusConnection *conn;<br />
    dbus_error_init (&amp;error);<br />
    conn = dbus_bus_get (DBUS_BUS_SYSTEM, &amp;error);<br />
    if (!conn) {<br />
    fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s: %s\n&quot;, <br />
    err.name, err.message);<br />
    return 1;<br />
    }<br />
    <br />
    Connecting to the system bus is a nice first step, but we <br />
    want to be able to send messages from a well-known address.<br />
    Let's acquire a service:<br />
    dbus_bus_acquire_service (conn, &quot;org.pirate.parrot&quot;,<br />
    0, &amp;err);<br />
    if (dbus_error_is_set (&amp;err)) {<br />
    fprintf (stderr, &quot;%s: %s\n&quot;,<br />
    err.name, err.message);<br />
    dbus_connection_disconnect (conn);<br />
    return;<br />

  [Ben] - I'd say that you have to look at the code or the documentation of the 
  API to figure out what &quot;dbus_bus_get&quot; and &quot;dbus_bus_acquire_service&quot; 
  do; since these are (presumably) defined somewhere before this part of the book, 
  you'll need to go back and set a mental bookmark for those functions. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&gt; Could you also explain what is the differnce between<br />

    &gt; &quot;dbus_message_new_signal&quot;.</p>
  <p>No idea - for the same exact reason as above. It all depends on what the 
    function does.</p>
  <p>&gt; Basically I'm trying to write two programs that could<br />
    &gt; send text to each other (over d-bus) when executed<br />
    &gt; on the same system. For this purpose do I need to be<br />

    &gt; you give me some advise regarding this ?</p>
  <p>Well, local communications usually take place via a unix(7) socket, which 
    certainly does not require a network connection; however, I suspect from the 
    content of what you've sent us that the author is using some kind of a specialized 
    protocol/method of sending the data. It _shouldn't_ need anything like that 
    - it would be like requiring someone to drive a car as a part of moving a 
    piece of furniture from one room to another within a house - but anything 
    is possible.</p>
  <p>It all comes back to Reading The Fine Manual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Jimmy] - Um... it's pretty clear English: the service is what you want to 
  use, the address is where it lives. Think of the service as something like &quot;http 
  server&quot;, and address as something like &quot;port 80&quot;.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&quot;org.pirate.parrot&quot; is the name of the service provided by the 
    example program; a message originating from its address means that when that 
    service talks to another program using D-BUS, it first identifies itself as 
    coming from &quot;org.pirate.parrot&quot;.</p>
  <p>&gt; Could you also explain what is the differnce between<br />
    &gt; &quot;org.pirate.parrot.attr&quot; and &quot;org/pirate/parrot/attr&quot;<br />
    &gt; when been specified indivisually in the function<br />
    &gt; &quot;dbus_message_new_signal&quot;.</p>
  <p>Just a slightly different naming scheme. &quot;org.foo.bar&quot; refers to 
    a service, but &quot;/org/foo/bar/some/object&quot; is used when you want 
    to access an object provided by that service. I think the naming scheme is 
    different so you will know by sight what you are accessing: the service name 
    is more like a (backwards) domain name, the object(s) provided like a file 
    path.</p>
  <p>For example: &quot;net.linuxgazette&quot; would be the address for a viewer 
    program for LG issues; &quot;/net/linuxgazette/124/&quot; would provide an 
    object that provides a list of articles from that issue, &quot;/net/linuxgazette/124/lg_bytes.html&quot; 
    could provide a file, etc.</p>
  <p>&gt; Basically I'm trying to write two programs that could<br />
    &gt; send text to each other (over d-bus) when executed<br />
    &gt; on the same system. For this purpose do I need to be<br />

<p>[[Ben]] - I generally like to distinguish between somebody coming to us and 
  saying &quot;I'm having this Linux-related problem at school, I've tried to 
  figure it out but can't, can you help?&quot; and &quot;Answer these questions: 
  1. What is an inode? 2. How does Linux boot? 3. What is the weight of a coconut-laden 
  African sparrow?&quot; In the first case, the person (at least in my opinion) 
  has followed the net.help procedures and is asking for assistance; in the second, 
  they're being a lazy ass who wants to have their work done for them.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know about anyone else, but the fact that a problem is associated 
    with schoolwork does not faze me or influence my willingness to answer one 
    way or the other; there are plenty of valid problems, and of people trying 
    to solve them, in many different venues. On the other hand, freeloading lazy 
    bums who are unwilling to make an effort - no matter what the context - cause 
    my fingers to twitch toward my flamethrower, or (more commonly) exert about 
    the same amount of effort that they have toward solving the problem (i.e., 
    none.)</p>
  <p>IMO, Prashant fits the first case far more than the second. I may be wrong, 
    but that's my best estimate.</p>

<p>Thomas Adam (thomas at edulinux.homeunix.org)<br />
  Tue Mar 21 13:25:19 PST 2006</p>
<p> <strong>Dear all,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Whilst this is slightly OT (and most likely hardware related), I thought 
  I'd ask here anyway, since it's an odd issue to say the least.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To put it simply, my DVD-ROM drive no longer wants to read _any_ DVD 
  I give it, yet it manages to read data CDs and audio CDs just fine. For some 
  reason, my DVD drive was working fine one day, and the next it has trouble in 
  reading any DVD you feed it -- even the same DVD that was known working and 
  being read by the same DVD drive a day before.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can't even say that the issue is a read one, since as soon as I put 
  a DVD into the DVD drive, the drive just starts to splutter, spin up and slow 
  down, and will remain like that for at least thirty minutes, until such time 
  that the DVD drive will stop, or I eject the disc. Trying to use MPlayer on 
  the drive fails in that MPlayer sees nothing. There's not even any suspect { 
  SeekReadComplete } type of errors in /var/log/messages. In fact, nothing is 
  printed to that file in any way to suggest there's a problem with the drive.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I did (on a hunch) shove a CD-cleaner CD into the drive in the hopes 
  that might help, alas, it didn't. DVDs are still not being read.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I also tried to bugger about with hdparm and toggling DMA and I/O support 
  which didn't help either.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Can anyone shed some light onto what I do next? Is the drive kaput?</strong></p>
<p>[Ben] - I've seen CD-ROM drives get into a state which could only be &quot;cured&quot; 
  by shutting down the machine and leaving it off for a minute or so. Try that, 
  boot using a different version of Linux (I've usually got a CD with BBC-Linux 
  on it close at hand, these days), and if it still doesn't work, I'd call it 
  cooked.</p>

  <strong>My laptop compaq presario x1000 has this problem:<br />
  suddenly the sreeen have desappeared and now after two days of on &amp; off 
  I can not use it anymore. The laptop in itself is working but there is not the

<p><strong> Someone told me that maybe the inverter cable connection between display

<p>[Thomas] - Sure -- take it back to where you bought it and get it mended. Seriously, 
  fixing that sort of thing by yourself (if it even *is* the inverter cable) is 
  going to be awkward. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>So get someone who knows what they're doing, to do it for you.</p>
  <p>Oh, by the way, a subject line of &quot;help&quot; really is annoying, and 
    doesn't help me in knowing what your email is about. You could have tried: 
    &quot;Laptop screen blank? Inverter Cable?&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
<p class="editorial">Ramon changed the subject line shortly after, and I've changed the title 
  to reflect this. --Ed.</p>
<p>[Ramon] - Attach an external monitor to the laptop and use that to copy all 
  your crucial data onto some external storage (network drive / other computer 
  / usb-harddisk / whatever) Take the laptop to a certified repair shop or return 
  it under warranty.</p>
<blockquote>

    :-(</p>
  <p>Good luck.</p>
  <p>P.S&gt; It helps if you use a more relevant subject instead of help!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - This has nothing to do with Linux, but - yeah, inverters die a lot. 
  I've replaced a couple of them myself within the last couple of years, including 
  the one on the laptop that I'm using right now. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>First, figure out what the correct inverter is for your LCD display. The 
    only way to do this is to actually take the plastic casing off the and look 
    at the back of the display, since every manufacturer uses several different 
    displays in any given model. Buy the appropriate inverter - I've found eBay 
    to be an excellent source for them. The inverter is usually located just below 
    the LCD display (i.e., just above the hinge); disassembling the case (you 
    only need to open the top part - the body of the laptop is usually not involved, 
    although you'll most likely need to remove the hinge cover) requires removing 
    the screws and *carefully* unlatching the very thin plastic clamshell around 
    it.</p>
  <p>Reassemble everything - you *did* take pictures as you went through disassembly, 
    right? :) - and enjoy your nice bright screen.</p>

    Taking the conversation off the list without making financial arrangements 
    with me means that I do not get paid, and the community does not get the benefit. 
    Given the lack of both of those, why would you expect me to keep helping you?</p>
  <p>Again, I'm assuming that you've done it as an innocent mistake, so I'm CCing 
    TAG on my reply. I also _strongly_ suggest that you read some documentation 
    on netiquette - e.g., &quot;Asking Questions of The Answer Gang&quot; at <a href="../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a> 
    - before posting to any more lists, since many people are NOT going to treat 
    this kind of violations with any degree of tolerance.</p>
  <p>&gt; though i still need ur help but as u said this was unplesant for u to 
    have that<br />
    &gt; kind of demand so i m not goin to ask.</p>
  <p>I don't have any problem with you asking for help; that's what this list 
    is for. The problem was in your violation of basic list protocol, not the 
    technical request.</p>
  <p>&gt; but i really thank you for your prompt n apt reply.</p>
  <p>You're welcome; glad I could help.</p>
  <p>&gt; (but sir if u can suggest me some place from where i can ask my queries 
    onC<br />
    &gt; and UNIX-system programming, then it will be a gr8 help to me.)</p>
  <p>Hmm, tough question. USENET is usually a good source of that kind of information 
    - e.g., news:comp.lang.c is reputedly very good, and has been around for a 
    long time. Take a look at their FAQ - <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/%7Escs/c-faq.com/">http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/c-faq.com/</a></p>
  <p>There's news:comp.lang.c.moderated as well. Do note, however, that USENET 
    folks tend to be very touchy about net protocol - and the standard netiquette 
    recommendation (quoted from RFC1855, &quot;Netiquette Guidelines&quot;)<br />
    is</p>
  <p> - Read both mailing lists and newsgroups for one to two months before you 
    post anything. This helps you to get an understanding of the culture of the 
    group.</p>
  <p> Or you can ask here. Just do it politely - which includes Netiquette manners, 
    although we don't apply the requirement just cited. We're always willing to 
    help, particularly when the question relates directly to Linux. Programming 
    questions are a somewhat marginal topic, and you may or may not get an answer 
    - but you're always welcome to ask.</p></blockquote>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LinuxWorld OpenSolutions Summit to Debut in February 2007</h3>
<p>    IDG World Expo, the producer of  
tradeshows, conferences and events for technology markets, has announced a new OSSw event - 
LinuxWorld OpenSolutions Summit - a regional and more vertically focused 
conference tailored specifically to the needs and interests of IT professionals 
involved in the deployment of Linux and open source solutions. The inaugural 
event is scheduled to take place February 14-15, 2007, at the Marriott Marquis 
in New York City.</p>

<p> The new OSSw summit evolved after recognizing a need for a 
targeted, high-level conference that concentrates on vertical markets. Attendees can 
access multiple tracks addressing best practices, including presentations by leading 
Linux and open source experts, case studies presented by IT executives, and 
a Solution Showcase for the latest Linux and OSSw products and technologies.</p>

<p>As a result of launching the New York LinuxWorld OpenSolutions Summit, the Boston 
LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo will no longer take place.</p>

<p>LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo San Francisco, the original, largest and 
most comprehensive event focusing exclusively on Linux and Open Source, will 
continue on an annual basis at the Moscone Center. Considered the de facto event 
by attendees and exhibitors alike, LinuxWorld San Francisco features 
across-the-board sessions and a full trade show floor embracing the entire Linux 
and open source continuum, and topics ranging from system administration to the 
desktop to mobile Linux. At a new conference track for the Linux Channel, the 
findings of the first major, objective study focusing on how solution providers 
are selling Linux solutions to mid-market customers will be released.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif"> Sun Frees Java a little bit more</h3>

<p>Sun will now allow the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) 5.0 to be distributed 
by GNU/Linux and OpenSolaris developers under a new license, the Operating 
System Distributor's License for Java, or "Distro License for Java" (or "DLJ"). 
The announcement came during the kick off keynote speech at May's JavaOne 
conference in front of 14 to 15 thousand developers in San Francisco. In a kind 
of rapproachement with the OSSw community, Sun's new CEO Jonathan Schwartz called 
Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth to the stage to talk about the 
announcement.</p>

<p>Sun had hinted earlier in May that it will loosen distribution restrictions 
on its Java licensing, to encourage developers to use Java on Linux systems. 
Many Linux distributions previously required users to manual download, install 
and configure Java.</p>

<p>Sun developed this license in conjunction with numerous GNU/Linux 
communities. It allows distributors to ship Sun's Java SE 5.0 Java Development 
Kit (JDK) and Java Runtime Environment (JRE) as installable packages for their 
operating systems. </p>

<p>The company also announced that Sun's Java Studio Creator, Java System Portal 
Server, Java Message System-based message queue and Web Services 
Interoperability Technology would be released as open source code.</p>

<p>Sun has opened a new community project on Java.net (<a 
href="http://jdk-distros.dev.java.net">http://jdk-distros.dev.java.net</a>         
) to serve as a clearinghouse for best 
practices for delivering compatibly packaged JDK bundles on GNU/Linux and 
OpenSolaris. </p>

<p>[Meanwhile, CEO Schwartz continues to talk about Open 
Sourcing Java after JavaOne.  <a 
href="http://java.sys-con.com/read/227995.htm">Click here</a>         
        
         for SysCon's 
take.] </p>

<p>Several project teams have [or should soon] announce plans to redistribute 
the JDK for use with their operating systems including the Ubuntu, Gentoo and 
Debian distributions of GNU/Linux, NexentaOS, a hybrid operating system with an 
OpenSolaris kernel and GNU applications and both the Schillix and BeleniX 
versions of OpenSolaris. One well-known effort to repackage Sun's JDK for Linux, 
the Blackdown Project (<a href="http://www.blackdown.org">http://www.blackdown.org</a>), has agreed to join the new 
jdk-distros project on java.net and contribute their Debian packaging code to 
this initiative.</p>

<p>"We are really pleased to see Sun's increasing involvement in the free 
software community, from the opening of the Solaris Operating System source and 
now the re-licensing of Java technology to be compatible with</p>

<p>GNU/Linux distributions, and are looking forward to building stronger ties 
with the Sun community in the future", said Anthony Towns, Debian Project 
Leader.</p>

<p>"This new license shows that Sun and the Java technology world care about 
GNU/Linux and open source platforms and are willing to put aside philosophical 
differences and get down to business," said Mark Shuttleworth, founder and 
sponsor of the Ubuntu GNU/Linux distribution. "This eliminates one of the 
biggest roadblocks to wider use of the Java platform on free and open source 
operating system platforms and makes Java technology a more attractive 
foundation on which to build new projects and innovations." </p>

<p>[In email correspondence, Mark wrote, "I see it as a positive step by 
SUN towards having a genuinely free software license for Java." And "...the new 
license does allow us to carry SUN's Java implementation in the Ubuntu 
repositories alongside other non-free software."]</p>

<p>Quoting from Mark Shuttleworth's Blog [May 23rd] at 
<a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com">http://www.markshuttleworth.com</a>:</p>

<p>"Even though this was not the announcement we were all hoping for (a complete 
shift to free software Java), I was pleased to be part of the "Distro Licence 
for Java" announcement. As best I can tell, the new leadership at SUN clearly 
recognizes the importance of the free software model AND the role of the 
community. That's a big step forward and important to the progress of free 
software...."</p>

<p>"The new license does not mean that we can include Java in Ubuntu by default. 
It does not yet meet our criteria for free software in order to get into "main". 
But it DOES mean we can put it in the Multiverse or Commercial repositories, and 
people who want it can trivially get it after they have installed Ubuntu on a 
desktop or a server."</p>

<p>Mark's blog entry also has some interesting musings about Sun switching 
to the copyleft and TradeMark enforcement  and also how the world might be different 
if Java had been free OSSw 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years ago [it would have been 
Java-on-Rails, not Ruby].</p>

<p>The DLJ allows the different distributions to define the packaging, 
installation and support for the JDK within their distribution. Distributions 
exercising the DLJ and shipping JDK bundles are ultimately responsible for 
maintaining compatibility. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM invests in Linux -- in Brazil</h3>


<p>IBM announced in late May it will invest $2.2 million in 2006 to expand its 
Linux Technology Center (LTC) in Brazil. Developers at IBM's Linux Technology 
Center in Brazil will work to improve Linux as part of the open source 
community.</p>

<p>The investment will be used to complete construction of a Linux development 
laboratory in Hortolandia and expand a second lab in Campinas, on Brazil's 
Unicamp campus. It will assist with upgrading lab construction and equipment, 
furthering software development projects with Linux, and expanding student 
internships and job opportunities for recent graduates as a result of a 
collaboration between IBM and Brazil's Unicamp campus.</p>

<p>The investment will enable engineers and developers at the Linux Technology 
Center in Brazil to work on the following new projects:</p>


- Linux development for IBM's Cell processor.<br>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Researchers Find Linux Security Vulnerabilities</h3>

<p>Safend announced in May that Zvi Gutterman, its CTO and co-founder, has 
discovered several security vulnerabilities in Linux, the most common open 
source project. As Safend's CTO, Gutterman designs key technologies such as the 
algorithms and theory behind Safend Auditor and Safend Protector implementation 
and is a Ph.D. candidate at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Recently, he has 
been conducting analysis of the Linux Random Number Generator (LRNG) along with 
Benny Pinkas from the University of Haifa and Tzachy Reinman from the Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The team's research includes an attack on the Linux Random Number Generator. 
The LRNG is the key element behind most security protocols and tools which are 
part of Linux. Among them are PGP, SSL, Disk and email encryption. Using the 
attack presented by the research team, an adversary attempting to break into a 
Linux machine may compute backward outputs of the LRNG and use them to access 
previous confidential communications.</p>

<p>Gutterman, along with Pinkas and Reinman, used dynamic and static reverse 
engineering to learn the operation of the LRNG. The team was then able to 
illustrate flaws in the design of the generator as well as measurements of the 
actual entropy collected by it.</p>

<p>"Our result shows that open source is not a synonym for secure design; once 
the LRNG is broken, we can break any future or previous password on that PC," 
stated Gutterman. "However, open source benefits security by enabling security 
audits. As we state in our research paper, we feel that the open source 
community should have a better policy for security sensitive software 
components. They shouldn't be treated as other source elements."</p>

<p>Gutterman, Pinkas, and Reinman presented their research 
paper entitled "<a 
href="http://www.gutterman.net/publications/GuttermanPinkasReinman2006.pdf">Analysis 
of the Linux Random Number Generator</a>" at the <a 
href="http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2006/oakland06.html">IEEE Security and 
Privacy Symposium</a> held in Oakland, California, May 21-24. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">X.ORG finds Bad Bug with Coverity Code Audit</h3>


<p>We have another major security issue with Linux and other Unix OSes, if you 
use XWindows. In conjunction with the DHS, Coverity has been performing static 
analysis of OSSw projects. This link describes the project:  <a 
href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3589361">http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3589361</a></p>

<p>This link shows the current results: <a 
href="http://scan.coverity.com/">http://scan.coverity.com/</a></p>

<p>During analysis of results from the Coverity code review of X.Org, a major 
flaw in the server was discovered that allows local users to execute arbitrary 
code with root privileges. The eWeek article below, which has been copied in 
many blogs and OSSw sites [sometimes without attribution], is reproduced here 
for your education and pleasure....</p>

<p><strong>Homeland Security Audit Flags 'Critical' Linux 
Bug</strong>      <br>
By Ryan Naraine / eWeek / May 2, 2006 </p>

<p></p>

<p>An open-source security audit program funded by the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security has flagged a critical vulnerability in the X Window System 
which is used in Unix and Linux systems. Coverity, the San Franciso-based 
company managing the project under a $1.25 million grant, described the flaw as 
the "biggest security vulnerability" found in the X Window System code since 
2000.</p>

<p>The flaw was pinpointed during automated code scanning that formed part of 
the "Vulnerability Discovery and Remediation Open Source Hardening Project," a 
broad federal initiative to perform daily security audits of approximately 40 
open-source software packages.</p>

<p>The purpose of the audit is to pinpoint buffer overflows, memory allocation 
bugs and other vulnerabilities that are a constant target for malicious hacking 
attacks. In addition to Linux, Apache, MySQL and Sendmail, the project will also 
pore over the code bases for FreeBSD, Mozilla, PostgreSQL and the GTK (GIMP Tool 
Kit) library. </p>

<p>The X Window System, also called X11 or X, provides the toolkit and protocol 
to build GUIs for Unix and Unix-like operating systems. It is used to provide 
windowing for bit-map displays. The X Window System also ships as an optional 
GUI with Macintosh computers from Apple.</p>

<p>Coverity Chief Technical Officer Ben Chelf said the flaw resulted from a 
missing parenthesis on a small piece of the program that checked the ID of the 
user. It could be exploited to allow local users to execute code with root 
privileges, giving them the ability to overwrite system files or initiate 
denial-of-service attacks.</p>

<p>Coverity hailed the discovery as proof that its automated code scanning tool 
can discover serious flaws that the human eye might miss. "This was caused by 
something as seemingly harmless as a missing closing parenthesis," Chelf said, 
describing the severity of the bug as a "worst-case scenario" for the X.Org 
Foundation that manages the X Windows System project.</p>

<p>Daniel Stone, release manager at X.Org, agreed that the vulnerability was 
"one of the most significant" discovered in recent memory. "[This is] something 
that we find once every three to six years and is very close to X's worst-case 
scenarios in terms of security," Stone said. "[Coverity's tool exposed] 
vulnerabilities in our code that likely wouldn't have been spotted with human 
eyes. Its attention to subtle detail throughout the entire code base - even parts 
you wouldn't normally examine manually - makes it a very valuable tool in checking 
your code base," he added.</p>

<p>The flaw, which affects X11R6.9.0 and X11R7.0.0, was fixed within a week of 
its discovery, and Chelf said Coverity has implemented a system to analyze the X 
Window System on a continuous basis to help prevent new defects from entering 
the project. [so pls check for the updates on your systems - your

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Open Source OWASP Project Addresses Web Security</h3>


<p>The Open Web Application Security Project announced availability of a process 
guide that will help a broad range of developers incorporate security into the 
software application development lifecycle (SDLC). OWASP is dedicated to helping 
organizations understand and improve the security of their applications and 
services.</p>

<p>CLASP (Comprehensive Lightweight Application Security Process) will be 
accessible through OWASP to developers globally. Developers will be able to 
leverage a best practices methodology that provides a well organized and 
structured approach for integrating security requirements and activities into 
each stage of the software development lifecycle.</p>

<p>"Many organizations are realizing that discovery and remediation of 
vulnerabilities in later stages of development is far too costly," said Jeff 
Williams, CEO of Aspect Security and Chair of the OWASP organization. "The OWASP 
project makes sure that developers have the knowledge and the tools to build 
secure software from the beginning."</p>

<p>OWASP's mission is to enable organizations to develop, maintain and purchase 
secure applications through the development of free,open and unbiased 
application security documentation, tools, chapters and conferences.</p>

<p>OWASP documentation projects include a guide to web application security, 
metrics, a test guide, documents for performing ISO 17799 reviews, and an AppSec 
FAQ . OWASP projects also include WebGoat - an interactive training and 
benchmarking tool so users can learn about web application security - and 
WebScarab - a web application vulnerability assessment suite.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss Effort to Standardize Web Beans, Link Java Frameworks</h3>


<p>-JBoss announced plans to submit a proposal to standardize Web Beans in Java. The 
Web Beans standard initiative will aim to bridge the gap between Enterprise JavaBeans 
3.0 and Java Server Faces (JSF) . The result would be a simpler, more 
elegant, unified programming model for web development.</p>

<p>Borland, Google, Oracle and Sun Microsystems will bring their support and expertise 
with web frameworks to the standardization effort. The proposed standard 
will draw upon principles found today in JBoss Seam, Oracle application 
Development Framework (ADF) and Apache StrutsShale. JBoss Seam introduced a 
uniform component model for building web applications through declarative, 
contextual, application state management. Oracle ADF promotes the use of a 
metadata-driven architecture that enables developers to cleanly separate 
business service implementation details from the user interface. Apache 
StrutsShale offers a set of fine-grained services that can be combined as 
needed, rather than a monolithic request processor.</p>

<p>Gavin King, architect at JBoss, plans to lead the standardization effort. 
King, who founded the popular Hibernate project and is currently leading the 
development of JBoss Seam, commented: "The overwhelmingly positive response to 
Seam from the developer community convinced us that this is an idea whose time 
has come and one that should be brought back into the standards process for the 
benefit of the entire Java community. JBoss' end goal is the same as these 
companies supporting this initiative: To create a highly productive, accelerated 
development environment and enable richer web applications." </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Borland Announces Three-Year JBuilder Product Roadmap; Builds on Eclipse </h3>


<p>The Developer Tools Group of Borland Software Corporation announced details 
around a three-year product roadmap for JBuilder, its award-winning Java 
Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The roadmap includes an update to 
JBuilder 2006, a new underlying framework based on Eclipse in JBuilder 2007 
("Peloton"), and provides insight into the functionality being developed in 
future JBuilder versions. Future capabilities for the product line include new 
team collaboration and developer productivity features, support for new Java 
standards and emerging open source tools and frameworks, enhanced support for 
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and more.</p>

<p>The JBuilder roadmap was presented at May's JavaOne 
conference in San Francisco, Calif. and to customer dates throughout the 
world during Borland's 2006 <a

Developer Road Show</a>.  US dates are June 1 through June 
14.    Borland's Developer Tools Group is already working to 
deliver on this three-year roadmap with a free JBuilder 2006 Foundation edition 
available for download  (<a 
href="http://www.borland.com/downloads/download_jbuilder.html">http://www.borland.com/downloads/download_jbuilder.html</a>           
           
    
          ) </p>

<p>Two new JBuilder 2006 updates planned for release this year, with the next 
major release of JBuilder, codenamed "Peloton," expected to be available in Q4. 
JBuilder 2006, already shipping, began the transition of JBuilder to a more 
collaborative team development environment with features such as shared code 
editor views and joint debugging capabilities. These features allow local and 
remote developers to jointly design, edit and debug applications in real 
time.</p>

<p>JBuilder will continue to support the latest JCP standards as they become 
available and Developer Tools Group expects to release an update to JBuilder 
2006 in June to support Java SE 6 ("Mustang") and an additional service pack in 
the Fall once Mustang is formally released by Sun Microsystems.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Terracotta Has Free Downloads of Terracotta Sessions for Apache Tomcat and 
BEA WebLogic Server</h3>


<p>Changing the Java landscape, Terracotta, Inc., a leader in enterprise Java 
scalability, announced at JavaOne that it has begun giving away free copies of 
its session clustering solutions -- Terracotta Sessions for Tomcat and 
Terracotta Sessions for WebLogic Server. By injecting clustering and caching 
into the Java runtime, Terracotta furnishes applications with linear 
scalability, total fault tolerance, and high availability without making any 
changes to the application code.</p>

<p>Apache Tomcat users can spend weeks or months writing clustering code by hand 
to make Java applications in production cluster and scale efficiently. 
Terracotta Sessions for Tomcat gives developers a free, clustering solution that 
meets their need for load-balanced Tomcat application servers. It also removes 
performance tuning from the development lifecycle. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, enterprises running WebLogic Server sessions from BEA Systems, 
Inc. can realize significant cost benefits with Terracotta Sessions for WebLogic 
Server, which eliminates performance tuning and provides linear scalability and 
total fault tolerance. Terracotta Sessions feature fine-grained updates of 
session data to reduce overhead and improve scalability and performance. 
Real-time monitoring of session contents simplifies debugging and 
provisioning.</p>

<p>Terracotta Sessions can plug-in to an "off-the-shelf" JVM and clusters at the 
JVM level to provide a simple runtime solution. With Terracotta Sessions, 
developers can now purchase inexpensive, non-clustered application servers or 
use open source application servers. Terracotta was named "Cool Vendor" by 
Gartner in April. </p>

<p>The Terracotta solutions are both standards-compliant and, as drop-in 
clustering solutions, they drive faster time-to-market for Java applications. 
Terracotta Sessions licenses are free for all platforms for four JVMs and under. 
Production licenses are available directly from Terracotta. For more 
information, see these links : </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SimplyMEPIS 6.0-beta4 Release Incorporates Ubuntu RC Components and Fixes </h3>


<p>MEPIS has released beta 4 of SimplyMEPIS 6.0. The ISO image is available for download and test in the mepis 'testing' subdirectory at the MEPIS Subscriber's Site and public mirrors. </p>

<p>Beta 4 includes some new and/or updated applications including amarok 1.4, 
xaralx 0.5, and ksudoku. Digikam plugins were added to make Digikam and showFoto 
much more powerful and fun to use. To make room for xaralx, it was necessary to 
remove tvtime and the GIMP from the bootable CD but, for those who need them, 
they are available for download and install via the Synaptic download manager or 
apt-get.</p>

<p>Warren Woodford explains why this was done: "The SimplyMEPIS bootable CD is a starting 
point, and not always a complete solution. There are many applications we would 
like to include on the CD, but they won't fit. The OpenSource edition of Xaralx, 
formerly Corel Xara, is a well known Windows app for vector graphics drawing 
that is an exciting addition to Linux and MEPIS. Likewise, the new plugins make 
image manipulation in Digikam and showFoto a piece of cake. We want the new 
Linux user coming to MEPIS from XP to see right away that Linux has apps that 
are fun and easy. For the experienced user who wants or needs a powerful image 
manipulation program like the GIMP or any of the other apps we don't bundle on 
the CD, we ask for their understanding."</p>

<p>For this release, cpu speed management and suspend-to-ram have been improved. 
KDE configuration have been fixed for time format and other localization 
elements. The fontconfig configuration has been improved, so some web site fonts 
look better in both Firefox and Konqueror.  Floppy support has been changed to be 
more reliable. Spamassassin has been tweaked to give very good results 
out-of-the-box, and then excellent results as soon as it has learned from a 
sample of user emails.</p>

<p>SimplyMEPIS 6.0 Beta 4 runs a reconfigured version of the Release Candidate 
update of the 2.6.15.7 kernel from Ubuntu. The kernel source has been verified 
to give the best possible compatibility with new Intel hardware. The MEPIS 
configuration maintains compatibility with the extra "restricted" drivers 
provided by the Ubuntu team in the Ubuntu pools. MEPIS builds extra drivers for 
the 386, 686, and K7 flavors of i386 including bcm4400, bcm5700, Intel536, 
quickcam, spca5xx, usbvision, and, new in this release, ivtv. These drivers are 
available in the MEPIS pool and they are compatible with the matching Ubuntu 
kernels.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">  Trolltech's Qt Development Framework Used for Remotely Managed Xandros 
Server</h3>


<p> Xandros, a leading provider of easy-to-use Linux alternatives to Windows, 
and Trolltech, a leading provider of technologies that make advanced software 
faster to build and easier to use, announced that Trolltech's Qt development 
framework was used to create the new Xandros Server, which recently won the 
Product Excellence Award at LinuxWorld Boston. Utilizing the robust and 
efficient Qt framework, Xandros developers created the all-graphical user 
interface called Xandros Management Console (xMC).</p>

<p>Similar in concept to the Microsoft Management Console that ships with 
Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 servers, xMC presents a simplified, centralized 
approach to remotely administering users and services, unlike any other on the 
Linux server market today. Qt was also used to create a unique plug-in 
architecture that enables third party services, such as Scalix groupware and 
RealNetworks media delivery, to be integrated and managed within xMC just like 
other services running on a Xandros Server.</p>

<p>"Through the use of the robust Qt development framework we were able to save 
countless hours of development time, while producing superior code and 
documentation," said Ming Poon, Xandros VP of Product Development. "Qt's 
cross-platform framework, in conjunction with the platform-neutral design we 
built into xMC, will allow us to seamleplug insrt a Windows version of xMC so 
that administrators can manage Xandros Server from their Windows workstations as 
well."</p>

<p>Xandros Server, built on top of Debian Linux, offers Managed Community model 
with consolidated system monitoring and workflow automation to address the 
issues normally encountered when administering SMB systems. It presents a 
simplified, centralized approach to remotely administering users and services 
through the all-graphical Xandros Management Console (xMC). It is compatible 
with any existing Windows domain and networking infrastructure, offering a 
plug-and-play replacement to costly Windows servers.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Lexar USB, Phoenix Technologies Latest BIOS Supports BitLocker Drive 
Encryption </h3>


<p>Phoenix Technologies Ltd.has announced a new version of TrustedCore, its 
innovative firmware that creates a more tamper-resistant platform by proactively 
protecting X86-based computing devices and their data before the operating 
system and applications even load. The new version of TrustedCore, through its 
support of BitLocker Drive Encryption, will provide Windows Vista users with 
better data protection, pre-boot security and authentication and support for 
other security specifications, including biometrics and smart tokens. 
TrustedCore is a secure firmware foundation that will increase client and 
enterprise security by providing endpoints with strong authentication and a 
secure execution environment.</p>

<p>BitLocker Drive Encryption provides for full volume encryption and support 
for pre-boot multi-factor authentication.   BitLocker will protect 
data from being used by unauthorized users or even downloaded inappropriately to 
thumb drives. Linux and other *IX platforms should also be able to leverage 
these BIOS enhancements. </p>

<p>TrustedCore architecture enables device designers and manufacturers to create 
trusted and self-authenticating networked devices. The software delivers a "root 
of trust" that allows customers to deploy devices that are inherently secure 
from the start and that support the latest in digital device authentication 
advancements. Phoenix TrustedCore supports strong, multifactor pre-boot user 
authentication and validates a user's identity before the system starts. </p>

<p>The new version of TrustedCore advanced firmware includes capabilities that 
legacy BIOS solutions cannot offer. TrustedCore SP3B enhances endpoint security 
by providing secure CRTM (core root of trust measurement, also known as BIOS 
Bootblock) update through its Secure Flash update process. In addition, 
TrustedCore SP3B supports Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) 2.0 and 
provides developer tools, including a device driver kit  for silicon and 
hardware vendors, and a software developer kit for application developers that 
want to build UEFI shell applications.</p>

<p>A beta version of TrustedCore SP3B is available immediately and the release 
version is expected in Q3 2006. For more information, visit 
www.phoenix.com/TrustedCore.</p>

<p>Lexar Media, announced the development of advanced, secure USB storage-based 
technologies. Lexar plans to work together with Phoenix Technologies, Ltd. to 
develop support for locking USB personal storage devices (PSDs) that can be used 
with the BitLocker Drive Encryption feature. The technology developed by Lexar 
for BitLocker, will coordinate the PSD-Lock technology protection of Lexar's new 
enterprise-class SAFE PSD products with the pre-boot authentication capability 
of Phoenix Technologies' TrustedCore.</p>

<p>This technology will provide protection against unauthorized use of the USB 
Flash Drive (UFD) that enables the boot of a BitLocker-protected computer and 
also protect the BitLocker Drive Encryption keys held in the UFD when the UFD is 
not connected to the protected computer.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">PostPath Announces the Drop-In Alternative to Microsoft Exchange</h3>


<p>May marked the official debut of PostPath, perhaps the only Linux-based email 
server to offer drop-in plug-compatibility with Microsoft Exchange. Formerly 
Apptran Software, the company was founded in 2003 to address the growing 
frustrations of organizations locked into Microsoft's expensive and inflexible 
email server.</p>

<p>PostPath has created an alternative by combining publicly available 
documentation with packet-level protocol decoding to implement the Exchange 
network protocols on the PostPath Linux email server. As a result, the PostPath 
Server is the first Exchange alternative to be able to drop into an existing 
Exchange farm without disruption.  It is the first to interoperate with the 
server-to-server functions of already-deployed Exchange servers and the first to 
provide full-featured Outlook interoperability without the need for plug-ins, 
special connectors, or reconfiguration.</p>

<p>           
 The PostPath Server also movies the information store to a Linux file 
system, simplifying storage, replication, backup and recovery.</p>

<p>"Enabling a five-times performance increase over Exchange and a six-fold 
reduction in storage costs, granular backup and restore, standards-based 
virus-filtering, archiving, clustering, replication and disaster-recovery, AJAX 
web-client support, and drop-in compatibility, the PostPath Server is the first 
truly enterprise-class Exchange alternative," said PostPath's CEO, Duncan 
Greatwood. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Crescendo Delivers Multi-Tier Application Acceleration for Web Based 
Applications</h3>


<p>At Interop 2006, Crescendo Networks announced the availability of its 
Application Layer Processing (ALP) technology - the first solution capable of 
intelligently accelerating application flows across all logical application 
tiers. It will be available as a software module for Crescendo's Maestro family 
of products beginning in Q3 of 2006. </p>

<p>Web applications commonly contain multiple logical processing tiers that 
reside on one or more physical server tiers. As application requests move 
between the tiers they must often wait for processing attention from upstream or 
downstream partners. Crescendo reduces this inherent latency by intelligently 
managing and optimizing the application flow between all logical tiers.</p>

<p>Using definitions created using the Crescendo Rule Engine (CRE), ALP is 
capable of recognizing for which tier each application request is destined. ALP 
also understands that different requests impose different processing "weights" 
on the application with "heavier" requests taking longer to process than 
"lighter" ones. Request weights can either be manually configured or adaptively 
learned by ALP. In addition ALP recognizes that each tier in the application has 
an upper processing limit in terms of simultaneous requests. When a tier reaches 
maximum capacity, ALP's Admission Control mechanism queues requests within 
Maestro sending them only to the application when processing capacity is 
available.</p>

<p>"Crescendo's unique ALP technology represents the first time an AFE 
[application front end] is addressing our application and database performance 
bottlenecks behind the web server," said Ian Rae, president and CEO of Syntenic 
Inc. "This revolutionary end-to-end acceleration approach will enable 
applications to reach new levels of performance and scalability unattainable by 
existing acceleration technologies." </p>

<p>Crescendo Network's Maestro product line delivers application acceleration, a 
faster end user experience, increased security and application assurance. ALP 
offers patent-pending application layer processing algorithms modeled on 
bio-medical engineering research techniques. ALP's unique functionality 
eliminates application overload, intelligently schedules and prioritizes 
delivery requests, and monitors and reports on application performance across 
all tiers. Collectively ALP and SLT technologies deliver a level of application 
acceleration several times greater than the performance capabilities of any 
other AFE vendor.</p>

<p>ALP will be available for the Maestro product line as a software module. 
Pricing for the integrated Maestro-ALP solution package will start at $52,000. 
ALP will be available to existing Crescendo clients as an upgrade. </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intel's Core Microarchitecture Sets New Records in Performance and Energy Efficiency
</h3>

<p>Intel now has record breaking results on 20 key dual-processor (DP) server 
and workstation benchmarks. The first processor due to launch based on the new 
Intel Core microarchitecture -- the Dual-Core Intel Xeon processor 5100 series, 
previously codenamed "Woodcrest" -- delivers up to 125 percent performance 
improvement over previous generation dual-core Intel Xeon processors and up to 
60 percent performance improvement over competing x86 based architectures.</p>

<p>Fully-buffered dual in-line memory (FB-DIMM) technology allows for better 
memory capacity, throughput and overall reliability. This is critical for 
creating balanced platforms using multiple cores and the latest technologies, 
such as virtualization, to meet the expanding demand for compute headroom.</p>

<p>Intel's new server and workstation platforms, codenamed "Bensley" and 
"Glidewell" respectively, will support dual- and quad-core processors built 
using Intel's 65-nanometer (nm) and future process technologies.</p>

<p>The first processors for Bensley and Glidewell are in the Dual-Core Intel 
Xeon processor 5000 series, previously codenamed "Dempsey." Shipping since March 
at a new lower price point, they bring higher performance and lower power 
consumption to the value server and workstation segment. Complementing the 5000 
series, Intel will ship the next processor for Bensley and Glidewell in June -- 
the Dual-Core Intel Xeon processor 5100 series. Based on the Intel Core 
Microarchitecture, most of these processors will only consume a maximum of 65 
watts.</p>

<p>Using the SPECint_rate_base2000 benchmark, which measures integer throughput, 
a Dell PowerEdge 2950 server based on the Dual-Core Xeon 5100 series scored 
123.0, setting a new world record. Using the SPECjbb2005 benchmark, the 
Fujitsu-Siemens PRIMERGY RX200 S3 server based on the Dual-Core Xeon processor 
5100 series broke previous records with a score of 96,404 business operations 
per second.</p>

<p>An HP Proliant ML 370 G5(a) server based on the Dual-Core Xeon 5100, and 
using the TPC-C benchmark, which measures database performance, smashed another 
world record by scoring 169,360 tpmC at $2.93/tpmC. IBM is also in the record

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intel's Otellini Demonstrates Education Notebook -- for the next billion 
users</h3>


<p>Speaking in Austin, Intel Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer 
Paul Otellini gave the first public demonstration of a <a 
href="http://mms.businesswire.com/bwapps/mediaserver/ViewMedia?mgid=67941&amp;vid=4">low-cost 
notebook PC for students in developing nations</a> 
[small pic] and announced a plan with the 
Mexican government to provide PCs to 300,000 teachers. </p>

<p>"We're close to achieving Andy Grove's vision of a billion connected PCs -- 
and the economic, social and personal gains that come with them," said Otellini, 
referring to the Intel co-founder and former CEO. "Our job now is to harness the 
combined potential of full-featured technology, high-speed connectivity and 
effective education to speed the gains for the next billion people -- and the 
next billion after that."</p>

<p>In his speech, Otellini said that the predictions by Grove and of another 
co-founder of Intel, Gordon Moore, form a backdrop for the new World Ahead 
Program from Intel. The program's 5-year goals are to extend wireless broadband 
PC access to the world's next billion users while training 10 million more 
teachers on the effective use of technology in education, with the possibility 
of reaching another 1 billion students.</p>

<p>Otellini demonstrated one of the PCs developed from Intel's extensive 
ethnographic research in developing countries, a small notebook PC for students 
codenamed "Eduwise." Eduwise is designed to provide affordable, collaborative 
learning environments for teachers and young students and integrate with other 
non-computing learning tasks such as note taking and handwriting with wireless 
pen attachments. Because it is a fully featured PC, the Eduwise design can 
accommodate other standard software and tools [and operating systems].</p>

<p>Otellini also announced that Intel and the Mexican government have reached an 
agreement to make Intel's new low-cost, fully featured PC available to 300,000 
teachers by year's end. The systems, unveiled last month in Mexico by Otellini 
as part of Intel's Discover the PC initiative, provide an easy-to-use, fully 
functional PC for first-time users. Intel also plans to extend teacher training 
to 400,000 teachers in Mexico through the Intel Teach to the Future program by 
2010.</p>

<h1>FVWM: How Styles are Applied</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/adam.html">Thomas Adam</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Configuring FVWM can seem like a chore at times. Indeed, there are
certain aspects of it that are easy - and some that are less so. I've been
helping people configure FVWM for some time now, and while I have delved
into some of the more esoteric regions of FVWM, it seems that many people
find the use of <code>Style</code> lines the hardest aspect to grasp.
Hopefully this article will help clarify things.</p>

<h3>What are Style lines?</h3>

<p><code>Style</code> lines (in FVWM parlance) are those lines in an FVWM
configuration file which apply some specific style to a window. It could
be, for instance, that one would want all windows called <em>foobar</em> to
be sticky by default. Hence in one's .fvwm2rc file:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style foobar Sticky
</pre>

<p>... would ensure that fact. One can also add multiple properties
to a given window [<a href="#1">1</a>]. For instance, it might be
desirable that the same window, <em>foobar</em>, have no visible
title and a border width of eight pixels. This can be expressed
as:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style foobar Sticky, !Title, BorderWidth 8
</pre>

<p>More style lines can then be added, line by line, with a
specific window for each style. Here's an example:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style amble*  !Borders
Style Login?  CenterPlacement
Style Gvim    Title, !Sticky
Style urlview StartsOnPage 1 1, SkipMapping, Icon wterm.xpm, !Closable
Style irssi   StartsOnPage 1 1, SkipMapping, Icon 32x32-kde/chat.xpm,!Closable, \
              StickyAcrossDesks
</pre>

<p>FVWM also allows for the use of wildcards when matching a
window's name as in the above example. The '*' matches for anything
after what precedes it, whereas the '?' matches a single
character.</p>

<p>What's even more important is that the matching of <code>Style</code> lines
is <strong>case sensitive</strong>. This means that for the
following, both are separate entities:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style Window1 BorderWidth 23
Style WINdoW1 BorderWidth 23
</pre>

<h3>How FVWM Interprets Styles</h3>

<p>So far, everything's going great. Window names are being added as
style options, and everything's working just fine - until you have a
series of lines which look like the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style myapp* NoStick, NoTitle
Style Fvwm* NoBorders, NoTitle, CirculateSkip, Sticky
Style Mozilla* NoTitle
Style Firefox* NoTitle
</pre>

<p>At first glance there's nothing wrong with them. Sure, FVWM is doing
exactly what you asked for... except that '*' is a greedy match, which is
what one would expect in using it. In the example above, Mozilla has, in
theory, only been told to display no title as a Style directive - but it
may also produce entirely unexpected results due to that greediness. As an
example, it may match an earlier declaration (e.g., 'Style Fvwm*') if that
string exists in the window title.</p>

<p>In all of the problems encountered with style lines, this has to be the
most common.  The reason for this isn't that Mozilla or Firefox are
misbehaving, but usually that there's a lack of understanding of
how<code>Style</code> lines are applied.</p>

<p>With applications such as Mozilla and Firefox, titles are dynamic -
they often change as a tab or page loads in them.  Assuming that we're
using the style lines from above, and that we're looking at, say, a webpage
that has the title: <em>"Fvwm: my nice screenshot"</em>:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style Fvwm* NoBorders, NoTitle, CirculateSkip, Sticky
</pre>

<p>...this matches (in part) some of Firefox's title [<a href="#1">1</a>].
If one were to then restart FVWM with this page still showing in Firefox
(or issue a <em>Recapture</em> command), then the window would become
sticky - annoying, and certainly not what we want. Most people will also
try something like this to remedy the situation:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style *Firefox* NoBorders
</pre>

<p>...which also has the same problems, and perhaps even more so,
since that's matching 'Firefox' anywhere within the title of a
window.</p>

<p>To get around this, something unique needs to be used. With dynamically
changing titles such as those in a web browser, specifying the full name of
the window just won't work. However, FVWM also allows us to match by a
window's class, as well.</p>

<p>Take Firefox. That will either have a class of <code>Firefox-bin</code>
or <code>Gecko</code> - which will provide a unique class match.</p>

<p>The reason one wants to match on a window's class in this
instance is that it's less ambiguous than the title of the window,
which might be something like this:</p>

<pre>
Fvwm Forums :: Post a reply - Mozilla Firefox
</pre>

<p>There are a few ways to obtain a specific window's class.
Perhaps the preferred option is using the module <em>FvwmIdent</em>,
although window manager-agnostic commands such as <em>xwininfo</em>
and <em>xprop</em> can also be used. Using the window class instead
of the title, the previous style command would be replaced
with:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style Gecko NoTitle
</pre>

<p>You can be fairly well assured that the Class of a window tends
to be unique to that application (the exceptions are things like
RXVT which sometimes have been known to set their class to that of
XTerm.) The problem here though is that the same application will
generally always have the same Class.</p>

<p>Indeed, you might be wondering how FVWM knows which attribute
style lines match. Truth is, it doesn't really know, however FVWM
defaults to cycling through a known series of window attributes.
Hence, FVWM will match your window's style line thus:</p>

<pre>
Title --&gt; Class --&gt; Resource
</pre>

<p>So, FVWM checks the title of a window first. If a match is
unsuccessful, it will then look at the Class, and if that fails, it
will then look at the Resource of that window for a match. By and
large, where wildcards are used in style lines -- it's normally the
window's title that gets matched in the first instance.</p>

<h3>Remedying the Situation</h3>

<p>There are other considerations that need to be taken into
account. Style lines are ANDed. That is, for successive lines that
are specified one after the other for the same application, both
lines are considered. So for the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style foo Sticky
Style foo !Title
</pre>

<p>The window 'foo' would be displayed without a title <em>and</em> would
become sticky. Because of this, the ordering of style lines is VERY
important to prevent race conditions, or other oddities that can creep
in.</p>

<p>But that's not the entire story, either. Specificity is important. Yes,
for the <em>same</em> window title, the styles are ANDed together. The
order that the style lines appear within your .fvwm2rc also matters. For
those of you who are familiar with the concepts of Object Oriented
programming, you can consider style lines as following the rules for
inheritance. The rule of thumb for style lines is:</p>

<p>
<strong>"Always generalise, before you specialise."</strong>
</p>

<p>That means, aggregate styles for all windows <code>(Style * [...])</code>
before you specify the style lines for specific applications.
FVWM's parsing is quite literal in that sense. When FVWM parses its
configuration file, it reads it line-by-line. This is why it's
important to think of Style lines as an inheritance model.</p>

<p>Hence, if you wanted all windows to be sticky, and a window
whose name is 'foofoo' to not be sticky and have no borders, the
correct order to write that in would be:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style * Sticky
Style foofoo !Sticky, !Borders
</pre>

<p>Note that because we had previously declared a global style in which
all windows are sticky, it is necessary to negate that Sticky
condition for the specific application. Otherwise it would be
"inherited".</p>

<p>Writing that the other way around, however, gets one into
trouble:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style foofoo !Sticky, !Borders
Style * Sticky
</pre>

<p>The greedy match of "*" for all windows, irrespective of the
specific condition for 'foofoo' above, means that the greedy match
takes precedent.</p>

<p>It was mentioned earlier that style lines are ANDed. This is
indeed true, and you can see that in operation. But we have another rule
that applies: given two contradictory <code>Style</code> 
statements, the latter one always wins. So, for example (and I see
this a lot in people's configs), assume you had written this:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style * SloppyFocus
Style * FocusFollowsMouse
</pre>

<p>... because they're both focus policies being applied to all
windows, FocusFollowsMouse would win because it was the last one
specified.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
So, to recap:

<ul>
<li>Style lines are matched on a case-sensitive basis.</li>

<li>When specifying a window to be matched, the order of operation
is: <code>Name --&gt; Class --&gt; Resource</code>.</li>

<li>Specificity is important. Generalise the styles for all
programs at the top, and define specific window styles lower down.</li>
</ul>

<dd>Although the term <em>title</em> is used throughout this
document, it should be noted that it's really the window's
<em>name</em> that is used (see xprop(1)). For convenience's sake,
the window title is often set from the name of the window.</dd>

<h1>FvwmEvent: conditional window checking by example</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/adam.html">Thomas Adam</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Most window managers have some form of automation that allows the user to
'script' various aspects of its operation. Indeed, the 'kahakai'
<sup><a name="text1" ref="#note1">1</a></sup> window manager has long since
defined Python as way of scripting its capabilities.</p>

<p>In FVWM, there are a few ways of scripting events. The use of FvwmPerl
is one such way. However, in almost all cases, when people say they want to
define actions, what they're really after is some way of conditionally
checking windows when they're created, or something similar. The
combination of this ability coupled with a series of commands grouped
together to form what FVWM calls a <tt>function</tt> is something that can
be quite powerful.</p>

<h3>What is FvwmEvent?</h3>

<p><code>FvwmEvent</code> is a module - a piece of code that is separate
from the core of FVWM. There are a lot of different modules in FVWM, all of
which share that important distinction; there's no point in loading extra
code which might never be used, or loading it on an ad-hoc basis where the
user never requested it.</p>

<p><code>FvwmEvent</code> is a module which allows listening for various events,
and acting upon them when they occur. Originally it was known as <code>FvwmAudio</code>, since its job
was primarily in playing sounds when various things happened (such as a window
being closed, iconified, etc). <code>FvwmEvent</code> still retains
that functionality, but now also has the capability of running specific
tasks based on those events.<p>

<p>So what are these events? They're triggers associated with the
operations of windows (many of which are wrappers around various low-level
Xlib library calls). Whenever an event that <code>FvwmEvent</code> has been
told to listen for occurs, it will look for an associated action and
execute it. A sample valid list of events that <code>FvwmEvent</code> knows
to listen for can be seen in its man page<sup><a name="text2"
href="#note2">2</a></sup>. The one this article will examine is
<tt>add_window</tt>; note that this is only a working example, and should
be thoroughly tested before using in production.</p>

<h3>FvwmEvent Example</h3>

<p>A generic <code>FvwmEvent</code> configuration looks like the following (note that the
line numbers have been added as a convenient reference point, and are not
part of the configuration):</p>

<pre class="code">
   1   DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent: *
   2   *FvwmEvent: &lt;some_event_name&gt; &lt;some_action&gt;
   3 
   4   Module FvwmEvent
</pre>

<p>The very first thing that happens is that the module config is destroyed
(Line 1). This might seem a little strange at first given that nothing has
been declared yet, but the point of it here is that for any previous
definitions of it (say via multiple parsings of one's '.fvwm2rc' file during
restarts), it gets destroyed and then recreated; otherwise, the module
definition would just be added to continuously - something that is most
undesirable. What follows next (line 2) is the start of the alias
definition that <code>FvwmEvent</code> will eventually read. Obviously &lt;some_name&gt;
and &lt;some_action&gt; are dependent on the event and the action required.
&lt;some_action&gt; might be a function, or a single command. Line 4 simply
tells FVWM to load the <code>FvwmEvent</code> module.</p>

<p>Note the concept of what's happening. Most modules have the concept of
aliases - that is, an identifier that the module can be told to use
(in earlier version of FVWM, in order for multiple aliases of a specific
module to be used, one had to symlink the alias name to the module). In the
case of the generic example above, that's using <tt>*FvwmEvent</tt> which
is fine until more instances of <code>FvwmEvent</code> need to be loaded.
It's permissible, of course, to just have one instance of
<code>FvwmEvent</code> running and declare all the events it will listen
for in there. The problem is that it's often desirable to run different
actions on the same event - something you can't do with one alias. So the
heuristic approach is to define a unique alias to <code>FvwmEvent</code>,
which isn't <tt>*FvwmEvent</tt>. Any name can be used, as will become
apparent.</p>

<h3>add_window event: maximising windows</h3>

This is perhaps the most common event people use when they consider running
commands on a window. This event is triggered whenever a window is mapped
(created) to the screen<sup><a name="text3" href="#note3">3</a></sup>.
Perhaps one of the most common operations that people wish to perform when
this happens is maximizing a window. This has been covered in part in the
main FVWM FAQ<sup><a name="text4" href="#note4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Of course, in encountering this question, it is often the case that when
people say 'maximised', they also mean so-called 'full-screen' -
which implies the removal of any title bars and borders, and other such
window decorations. That's fine, and can be dealt with at a later stage,
although the premise of maximisation has to be discussed first of all.</p>

<p>It also seems to surprise many people that FVWM has no 'StartMaximised'
style option. The reason for this is that in introducing such an option it
would break the ICCCM<sup><a name="text5" href="#note5">5</a></sup> - since
clients set their own geometry, either by themselves or via user
interaction.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done is setting up <code>FvwmEvent</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyModuleConfig FE-StartMaximised: *
  *FE-StartMaximised: Cmd Function
  *FE-StartMaximised: add_window StartAppMaximised

  Module FvwmEvent FE-StartMaximised
</pre>

<p>This tells <code>FvwmEvent</code> a few things. One is that the alias we're using for
it is <tt>*FE-StartMaximised</tt>. Secondly, we've informed the module
that the command specified for the event is a function. Thirdly,
the event we're listening for is <tt>add_window</tt>. Then the module is
started.</p>

<p>The function we'll declare is quite simple to start off with (again, line
numbers are for point of reference only, and are not part of the
syntax):</p>

<pre class="code">
   1   DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
   2   AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
   3   + I Maximize
</pre>

<p>Line 1 destroys the previous function definition. It's generally a good
idea to do this when declaring functions, since it removes a previous
definition for it. Indeed, the <tt>AddToFunc</tt> command (line 2) is
cumulative. Each time it is used, it just adds to the definition of the
function. If it doesn't exist, the function is created. Quite often
this cumulative nature isn't wanted, so removing the definition beforehand
is advised. Line 3 is the important line since it is the line which
defines the action for the function.</p>

<p>One can define as many actions within a function as is necessary. There
are a few prefixes as well which define when and how those actions are to
be invoked:</p>

<table>
  <tr><td align=center colspan=2>Function Operators</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>Context</td>
    <TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>Meaning</TD>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>I</td>
    <td align=left>Immediate - executed as soon as the function is
      called.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>C</td>
    <td align=left>Click - executed when the mouse button is clicked
      once.</td>
  </TR>

  <tr><td align=center>D</td>
    <td align=left>Double-click - executed when the mouse button is
      double-clicked.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>M</td>
    <td align=left>Motion - executed when the mouse is moved.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>H</td>
    <td align=left>Hold - executed when the mouse button is held
      down.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>Usually the most common operator is <tt>I</tt> for non-interactive functions,
since those commands will always get executed when the function is called.
So within this example, the command <tt>Maximize</tt> is run whenever a
window is created. Try it and see; start up an xterm. It will then be
maximised. Start up any application in fact, and all of those windows
will be maximised. Clearly this is suboptimal, but a start nevertheless.

<h3>Function Context</h3>

<p>So far, it's been shown how one can use <code>FvwmEvent</code> plus a
function to define actions for events. But there will be times in loading
applications (which produce windows mapped to the screen) when some windows
won't get maximised. The reason for this has to do with the <i>context</i>
in which the function is being run.</p>

<p>In most cases, functions are designed to run within a window context. This
means that, when they're run, it's known which window or windows the
function is to start operating from. Without the proper context, a
function will prompt for one, or not run at all. So it's important to
ensure a context is forced wherever it's not apparent.</p>

<p>One can achieve this is in a number of ways, and a lot of it depends upon
the situation the function is likely to be called in. Recall the
definition for <tt>StartAppMaximised</tt> - at the moment the line looks
like:

<pre class="code">
+ I Maximize
</pre>

<p>This already assumes a window context. But one can always make sure by
using the <tt>ThisWindow</tt> command, as in:</p>

<pre class="code">
+ I ThisWindow Maximize
</pre>

<p>ThisWindow is extremely useful to refer to windows directly without
implying any presumptions. Indeed, there are other conditional commands,
such as <tt>Current</tt>, which is quite a common way to imply
context:</p>

<pre class="code">
+ I Current Maximize
</pre>

<p>However, its use implies that the window already has focus. Sometimes this
is useful to refer to the specific window; however, in the case of the
<tt>StartAppMaximised</tt> function one cannot assume the operand windows
will always have the focus - hence, the use of <tt>ThisWindow</tt> is
preferable. Where one is unsure as to the operand window (i.e., it is to be
decided when the function runs), one can use the <TT>Pick</TT>
command which will prompt for a window to operate on if it is not already
known.</p>

<h3>Improving StartAppMaximised</h3>

Whilst the function does work, it needs improving. For a start, the function
is maximising every window that is created - this is clearly not
something likely to be desirable. One can conditionally place
restrictions on windows by matching against their name, class or resource
by using any of the conditional commands mentioned earlier:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window") Maximize
</pre>
<p>What happens here is that only the window with the name 'name of window'
is considered. If it matches the window just created, then it is
maximised; otherwise, nothing happens. Of course, the maximize command has a
toggling action to it. If the said window 'name of window' were to
already be maximised at the time it was created (presumably via some
command-line flag) then the maximize command would have the opposite
effect, "unmaximising" it. Luckily FVWM has a conditional test,
<tt>Maximized</tt> that can be used to test if the window is maximised.
The negation of this is <tt>!Maximized</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">  
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window",!Maximized) Maximize
</pre>

<p>Looking better, certainly. There's still room for improvement, though. In
FVWM 2.5.X, one is able to specify multiple windows to match on, if more
than one window need be considered:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window|another window", \
      !Maximized) Maximize
</pre>

<p>The '|' operator acts as a logical OR command, matching either of the
titles and applying the maximized condition to the (possibly) matched
window. In FVWM 2.4.X, one would have to use multiple lines one after the
other:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window",!Maximized) Maximize
  + I ThisWindow ("some_window",!Maximized) Maximize
</pre>

<p>There's still one more condition to consider: different window types. Up
until now, the assumption has been that normal windows are considered.
Whilst in most cases that's true, FVWM has (at the simplest level) two
different window types that it manages; ordinary application windows and
transient windows. By its very nature, a transient window is one which is
generally only on screen for a short length of time. Also known as 'popup'
windows, they're typically used for 'Open' and 'Save' dialogue windows. It's
not likely (due to their implementation) that one is going to be able to
maximise them anyway, but it's worth excluding them. FVWM allows for this
via the <tt>Transient</tt> conditional check, which can be negated to
<tt>!Transient</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window|another window", \
      !Maximized, !Transient) Maximize
</pre>

<h3>Full-screen mode</h3>

<p>The basis and functionality for the <tt>StartAppMaximized</tt> function is
complete. The last remaining item is to make certain windows borderless
and to remove their title so that they appear to cover the entire
viewport. In the simplest case, the window's name or class is known
beforehand, and an appropriate style line can be set<sup><a name="text6" href="#note6">6</a></sup>. For example:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style "name of window" !Title, !Borders, HandleWidth 0, BorderWidth 0, ResizeHintOverride
</pre>

<p>That line ought to be pretty self-explanatory. The
<tt>ResizeHintOverride</tt> condition makes those applications which are
column-sized aware (such as XTerm, GVim, XV, etc) not to be so. Without
it, some applications would leave a noticeable gap at the bottom of the
screen.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This has been a very brief look into how <code>FvwmEvent</code> can be
used to monitor and react to various events.  The most important thing to
remember about the use of <code>FvwmEvent</code> is specificity: always be
as specific as possible when operating on windows. Where a certain amount
of automation is required, always enforce a given context, unless it's a
requirement that the user is to select an appropriate operand window at the
time the event is triggered.</p>

<h1>With Knoppix at a HotSpot</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>Recently, my wife and I spent a week in a hotel on the Dutch coast, and
when we weren't out walking on the beach or riding on one of a
near-infinity of bicycle paths, I was using a laptop to try to catch up on
some reading. By a fortunate (???) coincidence, I failed to take the mouse along
and was forced to use the idiotic touch-pad: apparently designed for the
Wimp/OS world, it likes to trigger "events" at random intervals, perhaps at
transition from one window to another. In any case, suddenly I was
confronted with the following: </p>

<img border="1" src="misc/howell/w2.jpg">

<p> Wait a minute - my wife can get by in Dutch, but mine is terrible!  I
don't have anything in Dutch on this machine... What is going on here?
</p>

<p>
Well, my Dutch may be bad, but this wasn't too hard to decipher:
apparently, the Dutch have a verb that means "to use the Internet",
and the 2nd line translates as "<em>use the Internet wirelessly ... as if
at home</em>" - and the green heading in the right-most column refers to
the hotel where we were staying.
</p>

<p>
Guess what that means? They have a hot spot - and Knoppix found it without
my even asking!
</p>

<p>
So I made things a bit easier on myself by clicking on the British flag:
</p>

<img border="1" src="misc/howell/w3.jpg">
<p>
When I showed this to my wife, her first question was: can we check on
e-mail? Well - sure, why not?
</p>

<p>
Cautious as I am, though, I wanted to first test the water before jumping
in.  Under Knoppix, the Panel next to the "K" for KDE has a Tux icon;
clicking there, then "Network/Internet" and "KWiFIManager (Wireless LAN
Manager)" provided the following information:
</p>

<img border="1" src="misc/howell/w1.jpg">
<p>
Wow!  Since Knoppix started DHCP at boot time, it had already obtained an
IP-address.  I had no idea this was going on.  <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knopper/">Klaus</a>, you are so cool!
</p>

<p>
Clicking "File" and then "Disable Radio" was the emergency brake
I wanted.
</p>

<img border="1" src="misc/howell/w9.jpg">
<p>
Now that I knew that I wasn't going to turn into the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer%27s_Apprentice_mode">Sorcerer's
Apprentice</a>, the ice didn't seem quite as thin as it had a few moments earlier.
After all, if it is necessary to pay for a block of time up front, I didn't want
to waste any of it.
</p>

<img border="1" src="misc/howell/w4.jpg">
<p>
Something like $7 for 50 minutes isn't exactly cheap,
but under the circumstances, it didn't seem unreasonable.
More than enough time to check on e-mail a couple of times
while we are here, and maybe even surf a bit.
</p>

<p>
After entering a user name and password as well as a valid e-mail address,
it was time to provide a credit card number.
</p>

<img border="1" src="misc/howell/w6.jpg">
<p>
After that, it was just a matter of starting a browser and entering a URL.
This initiated contact with the provider requiring a log in, which then
provided a couple of options (which I didn't investigate) prior to
actually connecting and starting the clock.
</p>

<img border="1" src="misc/howell/w7.jpg">
<p>
Real road warriors certainly don't worry about minor details such as cost:
like E.T., they just want to get back in touch.  But when you are on
vacation and have to pick up the tab yourself, you might not consider the
hotel WLAN. I certainly will in the future.
</p>

<p>
The great advantage for us Linux users is that Knoppix is quite happy to
run without access to a hard drive.  I didn't have to worry about anything
evil.  The one or two things that I found important enough to keep, I just
wrote to a USB stick. Neat. Clean. No problem.
</p>

<p>
Do note, however, that my Knoppix 3.4 CD does not seem to support WLAN - at
least I didn't find anything like it.  Since 5.0 is now out (Mid-May 2006),
there is little incentive to want an earlier version on a notebook anyway.
</p>

<p>
Pure conjecture on my part: this notebook has the Intel Centrino (TM)
label and the provider at the hotel, KPN, displayed it as well.
Apparently Linux supports this hardware configuration well.
</p>

<p>
For what it is worth, I sacrificed a SuSE partition and went on-line
after booting it ("sacrificed" since it required access to the hard
drive and I will now re-format that partition as potentially contaminated).
It wasn't particularly difficult to figure out how to do this under SuSE
as well.
</p>

<p>
I haven't been able to replicate this since returning home, but that
certainly is just due to the absence of a hot spot in the vicinity.
Here, Knoppix shows the following:
</p>

<img border="1" src="misc/howell/w10.jpg">
<p>
This was my very first encounter with WLAN and may not be typical of other
providers.
</p>

<p>
While I would expect a somewhat similar scenario from other providers,
perhaps the Dutch are just very good at making it easy on newbies.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ I do a lot of travelling, and connect to a wide
variety of strange WLANs. In my experience, at least, connecting to a
wireless LAN with Linux is usually just as simple as Edgar describes. --
Ben ]
</p>

<p>
Still, it would seem that WLAN access is no longer just for high-tech road
warriors.  While it's not something I'd do in an airport somewhere waiting
for a connecting flight, I definitely will be looking for connectivity in
any hotel where a stay of several days is involved.
</p>

<p>
That will be a major improvement over dragging myself to the hotel lobby,
checking in with some sleepy clerk, and getting stuck using some outdated
OS that keeps getting in my way - and may even retain things I don't want
kept in spite of my clearing the history before leaving the browser and
logging off. Knoppix to the rescue!

<h1>Review: amaroK (audio player for KDE)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/kaushal.html">Pankaj Kaushal</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>
I have always been skeptical of media players and music management
software... using a bare minimum player like XMMS to play my digital music.
I have tried quite a few different ones: Rhythmbox, Banshee, etc.; I've
also giving a fair time to demos of iTunes and the Yahoo Music engine,
recommended by excited Mac and Windows weenies.
</p>

<p>
So, when a friend came to me and said "try amaroK!", I said, "Yeah,
<em>right!</em>" and blew the idea out with a puff of smoke.
</p>

<p>
Then, yesterday morning, I got stuck in a traffic jam and as a result
didn't feel like writing any kind of code - so I decided to install amaroK.
:) Installing it on FreeBSD 4.11 could be only covered under a full-fledged
technical orientation session; since that might scare lots of people, we
will not dwell on those perils. Besides, I have it installed under Linux as
well.
</p>

<p>
So, after I installed amaroK... was I blown? or was I
<strong><em>blown</em></strong>?
</p>

<p>
The really cool thing about amaroK is that you can install it and it's
ready to serve you in its full glory within a couple of minutes - at least
under Linux. :)
</p>

<p>
Tracks are imported into a "collection", which is displayed in the left
pane in a file manager-like fashion. Tracks must be added to a playlist
before one can hear them. There is a playlist tab which has "Smart
Playlists", and - of course - you can create your own.
</p>

<p>
Unlike most applications on Linux, eye-candy is not overlooked here, but is
actually given as much importance as usability and features. I especially
liked the "on-screen display" which comes up every time amaroK starts
playing a new track; mousing over the task bar icon shows the name of
the current song and also adds a little album cover. A lot of work
has gone into creating such a visually appealing tool, and in my opinion at
least, the effort was well worth it.
</p>

<p>
amaroK copies the winamp/XMMS shortcuts and does a great job of handling
them. It also adds XMMS shortcuts to a meta key of your choice and gives you
"Global Shortcuts." Dont like the current song? You don't have to switch
applications/virtual desktops, search for amaroK, or look for any 'skip'
keys - just press WIN+B. Sweet, or what?  
</p>

<p>
And did I tell you it displays the lyrics of the current song in a little
box? did I mention it also gives you a <a
href="http://www.musicminds.com/">musicminds</a> recommendation? maybe I
forgot about the fact that it also looks up the artist at <a
href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and shows the information in a
little box. Oh, yes... I <em>did</em> forget to mention that it
automatically downloads album covers from Amazon.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, though, amaroK gets in my way rather than helping. For example:
every time you play a song, it changes to the "Current" tab. This is rather
irritating; if you were in the 'Playlists' tab and going through a
collection - listening to a bit of this, and a bit of that - you'll be
forced to the 'Current' screen.
</p>

<p>
That being said - I really like amaroK and am really looking forward to
version 1.4.  What I particularly like about it is the cover/lyrics/tag
fetching, as well as the potential value of dynamic mode and its iPod
support.
</p>

<p>
I have Linux on my laptop, and it's also running amaroK now. In my opinion,
'gstreamer' is a whole lot more stable than 'aRts'; the latter seems to be
unmaintained, and imposes a lot of overhead.
</p>

<p>
Amarok appears to be written by hackers who themselves are truly fond of
music. It is a increasingly attractive and capable tool, and these guys
seem to be just getting warmed up. I'm really looking forward to seeing
what they'll do next!

<p class="editorial"> One of the advantages of hanging out in The Answer
Gang is being privileged to hear when one of the Gangsters goes off on a
rant (which are usually lots of fun), or, as often happens in the case of
Rick Moen, fires off a mini-tutorial on some interesting subject. Recently,
in response to a comment of mine, Rick posted a reply that we'd like to
share with you, our readers; not only was it a bit long for our Mailbag,
but it also deserved the status of a full article. Many thanks to Jimmy
O'Regan for formatting the content; as with so many jobs around LG, "many
hands make light work".<br>

As to spam, you may or may not have noticed, but the incidence of it
has gone down (my estimate) by ~99% since Rick Moen took over
administering the list. It's been more than a year, and I don't think
I've seen a dozen spams get through during that time.</blockquote>
<p>Herewith, a brief report on the state of system spam-rejection.</p>
<p>As a reminder, TAG's setup is challenging, in that list policy
precludes requiring subscription before posting.  Thus, a prime antispam
tool isn't available.</p>
<p>The most-effective antispam tool is use of Exim 4.60 (w/sa-exim 4.2)'s
&quot;callout&quot; interface during incoming SMTP sessions, used to verify that
the connecting MTA is RFC-compliant (e.g., accepts DSNs and mail to the
postmaster and abuse accounts).  This blocks an immense percentage of
spam, and 55x-rejects those.  After that, the mail is subjected to
SpamAssassin 3.1 testing: High spamicity mail is 55x-rejected, <em>very</em>
high-spamicity mail is 45x-rejected (i.e., teergrubing, which attempts
to punish particularly flagrant malefactors by tempting them to
continually reattempt delivery).</p>
<p>I use some but not all of the optional enhancements provided by J.P.
Boggis's &quot;EximConfig&quot; package (<a class="reference" href="http://www.jcdigita.com/eximconfig/">http://www.jcdigita.com/eximconfig/</a>), of
which I have v. 2.0 installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The setup does not (yet) use greylisting, which might be beneficial.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to make my MTA depend on MySQL.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The setup does not (yet) attempt to SA-test mail with full unescaping and Base64 decoding of the message body text, which might be beneficial.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to make my MTA depend on embedded Perl and MySQL.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The setup does not (yet) attempt flood protection / duplicate messages / repeat failed deliveries.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to make my MTA depend on MySQL.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The setup does not (yet) attempt direct detection of malware as distinct from other types of spam.</p>
<p>I've been reluctant to make my MTA depend on detectors of MS-Windows malware, which after all isn't actually harmful, only annoying -- and it seems lame to have to run a virus checker on a Linux box, even ClamAV.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spam addressed to TAG since March 1 (to date) that evaded my filters was
as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>One in Polish.</li>
<li>A lame bit of Windows malware (zipped) with a quasi-nonsense cover message.</li>
<li>A piece of Russian/Cyrillic spam</li>
<li>Five 419 (advance-fee) frauds</li>
<li>Four phishing frauds.</li>
<li>An old-fashioned UCE</li>
</ul>
<p>In each case, I blackholed the delivering IP upon receipt -- but that's 
ultimately a poor solution:  You end up endlessly playing whack-a-mole.
Still, it makes sure there are no repeats from that IP.</p>
<p>I may finally overcome my reluctance to enable those above-cited
optional EximConfig features, persuant to my long-deferred server
migration to slightly less antique hardware, Real Soon Now.  Also, I
<em>could</em> attempt to update Exim and SA's rulesets, to help them
pattern-match better on 419 and phishing frauds.  (I gather that
financial fraud spam has been <em>really</em> taking off.)</p>
<p>The point of the recounting, above, is to highlight where the major
weaknesses in the current system lie:  non-English-language spam, and
financial fraud spam.</p>
<p>I try to be really, really careful in any experimentation with my MTA,
since mail is very important to me and my users, and since I can't
afford to lavish unplanned debugging time fixing a malfunctioning mail
system.  Thus, even though I know I really <em>should</em> upgrade to
EximConfig 2.2, sa-exim 4.2.1, and SpamAssassin 3.1.1 -- and put in
place some custom third-party rulesets for the latter
(<a class="reference" href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets</a>), I've been slow to
do so for fear of breakage and extra time commitment.</p>

<h3><a name="description-of-the-toolset">Description of the toolset</a></h3>
<!-- http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/private/tag/2006-April/008056.html -->
<p>[Description of the existing toolset:  Exim 4.60, sa-exim 4.2,
EximConfig 2.0, and SpamAssassin 3.1 -- along with its design goals, 
current weaknesses, and reasons why I've been reluctant to implement
some optional extensions and in general am very careful about breakage.]</p>
<p>Warning: Following paragraphs include opinions, which you are welcome to 
either adopt, take home, and admire, <em>or</em> scowl at and hurl imprecations
towards, as local cerebral wiring policy dictates.  Readers looking for
guaranteed objective truth should stick to mathematics -- and even then
stay far away from anything touched by Kurt G&#246;del.</p>
<p>Spam defence is endlessly controversial for lots of reasons, including
inherent drawbacks (false positives, false negatives, other types of
collateral damage) in even the best regimes.  No matter what tactics you
use, you annoy someone -- and mailing lists (being glorified
mail-forwarding devices) have proven to be Ground Zero for the spam
problem and resulting controversies.</p>
<p>The &quot;luv-main&quot; mailing list, of the Linux Users of Victoria (Australia) has
recently erupted in one such donnybrook, where the overwhelming majority 
(and pretty much <em>all</em> of the more-technical members) wish to convert
the mailing list to publicly searchable archives, while a vocal minority 
stand in the way, protesting their right to continue hiding their
mailing addresses from spammers.  Many innocent electrons have been
killed in the resulting discussion, but at least it was established to
the satisfaction of most that the only reasons hide-from-spammers tactics 
&quot;work for many people&quot; (as a proponent put it) are short usage periods
and dumb luck:  Over time, any address used for mail will become
discovered by spammers through any of several diverse means, including
exposure on other people's virus-infected Windows boxes.</p>
<p>LUV's likely compromise solution will be creation of a fully public
&quot;luv&quot; mailing list alongside the obscured &quot;luv-main&quot; one, with the
expectation that the latter ghetto will wither and die.  (Naturally, the
minority aren't happy with that proposal, either.)</p>
<p>On the other side of the Pacific Ocean, the Silicon Valley Linux User
Group's mailing lists are gradually becoming more spammy, despite using
(modulo versions) <em>exactly</em> the same MTA and spam-rejection software 
I use, because SVLUG's Linux server has been completely unmaintained for
2+ years.</p>
<p>I'm not unsympathetic towards hide-from-spammers people:  As they often
point out, most use mail facilities over which they have no
administrative control -- often, in fact, their work mailboxes.  A
deluge of spam would make their lives miserable and might even interfere
with their professional lives.  This perceived loss-of-control threat 
increases their stress levels immensely, and impels them to make
sometimes emotional demands on listadmins and others.  (I frequently 
get mail saying &quot;I [/someone else] inadvertantly revealed my private
e-mail address on mailing list $FOO.  Would you mind please removing it
from the public archive?&quot;  I always <em>do</em> help such people.  Even though
I don't share their general approach, it's the kind thing to do.)</p>
<p>In any event, I'd been pondering both the slow deterioration of SVLUG's
spam-defences (from my front-row seat as its mailing list moderator) and
my own system's occasional slippage on TAG mail -- e.g., the
aforementioned twelve spams over the last six weeks: 5 advance-fee
frauds, 4 phishing frauds, 1 in Russian, 1 Windows malware, and 1 UCE.
As with SVLUG's system, I realised that I could probably do better,
after a bit of updating.</p>
<p>So, a couple of days ago, I <em>did</em> some.  You'll maybe have noticed that
we've had absolute, blissful silence on the spam front, since then -- 
which might be coincidence, or maybe not.</p>
<p>I figured out that one easy path to the low-hanging fruit was:  beef up
the SpamAssassin rulesets.  In an ideal world, this would not be my
preferred approach:  SA is a very beefy and slow Perl app, and
those <em>same</em> heuristics, implemented as improvements to the Exim4
front-end rulesets would, mutatis mutandis, be much more desirable.
However, those aren't at hand, while there's a veritable bazaar in
third-party ruleset files for SA, right here:</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets">http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/CustomRulesets</a></p>
<p>The ones I dropped into /etc/mail/spamassassin, a couple of days ago,
were as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
70_zmi_german.cf     Catches German language spam.
Chinese_rules.cf     Rules to catch spams written in Chinese.
mime_validate.cf     Finds MIME errors common in mails sent by bulk mailers.
blacklist_ro.cf      Catches spams written in Romanian or by Romanian spammers.
evilnumbers.cf       Phone #s, PO boxes, &amp; street addresses harvested from spam.
chickenpox.cf        Looks for words broken up by extraneous symbols.
french_rules.cf      Catches spams written in French.
malware.cf           Detects URLs known to point to malware.
</pre>
<p>There's a standard cronjob (Rules du Jour) to keep these and others
updated; I haven't implemented that yet, as I'm still testing.</p>
<p>Initially, I also installed this one:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
sa-blacklist:  a large set of blacklist entries of domains and IP addresses. 
</pre>
<p>This turned out to an 11MB(!) ruleset file.  For a Perl script.  I
rather recklessly <em>did</em> give it a try, resulting in the kernel
out-of-memory killer going on a shooting spree (on my antique 256MB RAM
PIII server) about five minutes later.</p>
<p>In addition, <em>also</em> quite usefully, I'm sure (if not more so than the SA
improvements), I dropped in updated nine updated ACL files for the
J.P. Boggis's EximConfig suite of Exim4 rules (and other things):
<a class="reference" href="http://www.jcdigita.com/eximconfig/#ACLs">http://www.jcdigita.com/eximconfig/#ACLs</a></p>
<p>...which brings us to the present, and the (for now) absence of new spam
arrivals.  Moral of the story:  It's possible (at least, if you're an MTA
operator) to have a credible, livable alternative to the venerable
&quot;hide from spammers&quot; stance:  Use better technology, apply it
intelligently, and be aware that some ongoing maintenance is required.</p>
<p>Personally, I would regard it as beneath my dignity to do otherwise.  
Internet presence is my community's core competency, so I'll be damned if
I'm going to surrender even an inch of it.</p>
<p>One caveat:  Silence isn't necessarily blissful.  There will always be
collateral damage, and one must keep an eye out for addresses, IPs,
hostnames, etc. that should be whitelisted.</p>

<h3><a name="the-downside-of-blackholing">The downside of blackholing</a></h3>
<!-- http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/private/tag/2006-April/008022.html -->
<p>Jimmy Regan replied to TAG querent Marcin Niewalda:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; My&#347;l&#281;, &#380;e to pomy&#322;ka: pan napisa&#322; do listy adresowego magazynu
&gt; internetowego. Dlatego &#380;e nasz magazyn jest napisany po angielsku,
&gt; przet&#322;umaczy&#322;em e-mail Pana. Adres, kt&#243;rego Pan szuka&#322;, jest
&gt; Delaveaux&#64;heagmedianet.de ale my&#347;l&#281;, &#380;e ten pan mowi tylko po
&gt; angielsku i po niemiecku; a nie wiem, czy ten adres jest nadal
&gt; aktualny.
</pre>
<p>Separately, I had commented:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; In each case, I blackholed the delivering IP upon receipt -- but
&gt; that's ultimately a poor solution:  You end up endlessly playing
&gt; whack-a-mole.  Still, it makes sure there are no repeats from that IP.  
</pre>
<p>And there's another reason why it's a poor solution:  Some days, you get
trigger-happy, e.g., when an innocent, on-topic query arrives in Polish
-- which is a problem if, unlike Jimmy, one is Polish-challenged.</p>
<p>Having seen the original query and (erroneously) concluded that it was
spam, I absent-mindedly added the delivering host's IP to
/etc/exim4/eximconfig/reject/ip via the vim instance I leave open all
the time editing that file.  It's a straight listing of &quot;Individual full
sender IP addresses to reject&quot;, one per line.  Today, several days
later, I had long ago lost track of which line it was.  Fortunately, in
this <em>one</em> instance, my error remains fixable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[rick at linuxmafia]
~ $ dig -t mx okiem.pl +short
10 mail.okiem.pl.
[rick at linuxmafia]
~ $ dig mail.okiem.pl +short
72.232.62.58
</pre>
<p>Accordingly, I've just now un-blackholed poor Marcin's ISP mail server
IP.  But in many cases, I'd either not realise I'd misjudged, or be
unable to re-find which IP it was.</p>
<p>Anyway, the larger point I wanted to make is that what I said in the
three-line quotation, above, wasn't exactly right -- because I actually
<em>do</em> try to be mindful of grey areas, and look closely at what the IP 
really <em>is</em>, before consigning it to permanent oblivion.  (One doesn't 
want to rely on Received headers' hostnames in so doing, except for ones
supplied by my own receiving MTA doing reverse-resolves:  Spammers lie;
&quot;dig -x&quot; is often one's friend.)</p>
<p>For example, if the prior-hop IP on a 419-fraud spam corresponds to
hostname mx105.exampleisp.com, then blackholing it would be dumb:  For
one thing, impliedly exampleisp.com has at least 104 other mail
exchangers.  For another, I'm not necessarily eager to pronounce
anathema on exampleisp.com just because of <em>one</em> 419 fraudmail.  That
could happen to almost anyone operating an MTA.  It could happen to me
(but only until I tracked down the user on my system who did it and... 
reasoned with him).</p>
<p>I'm reminded of a passage in my friend Karsten Self's (CC'd) excellent
recent analysis paper &quot;CIDR House Rules:  Use of BGP Router Data to
Identify and Address Sources of Internet Abuse&quot;<a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id2" name="id2">[1]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While blocklisting is one possible option, I'd very much like to see
the discussion move beyond that point.  A preferred approach is what I
term &quot;proportionate response&quot;.  First: you'll likely want rules to
expedite known-trusted mail, or high priority mail from remote
organizational sites, peers, clients, vendors, or other established
relationships.  Secondly, many peers will either have small overall
volumes, or not have a clearly identifiable nature.  This leaves the
set of networks that are both high-volume and overwhelmingly spammy
in nature.  Of course, any such implementation would have to be
evaluated in a business and organizational context.</p>
<p>In proportionate response, a certain level of abuse would be met by a
proportionate level of response.  For example, a network from which
90% of email was found to be spam, 90% of traffic originating from
that network would be denied or dropped, either at the service
(protocol) or IP level, at random.  If done at the SMTP transaction
level, either as a timeout (without 250 OK) or non-permanent
rejection, this would mean legitimate mail still has a fighting
chance to get through.  A 90% reject rate would allow half of mail
through on 5 retries, for a typical 2 hour delay.  A spam server
without retry rules would fail delivery of 90% of its mail; with
retries, it would suffer large mail spools and possible other resource
starvation.  The site implementing such a policy will receive
immediate benefit to itself.  Widespread adoption is not necessary to
be locally beneficial.  As multiple and large sites adopt such measures,
impacts on abuse-tolerant networks would be significant.  The approach
is to be both non-invasive and non-retaliatory.  You are not taking any
action that in any way directly changes or affects a remote system:
but are subjecting it to a denial of interest.  As a proportionate
response, reject rates could vary with total traffic volume, abusive
traffic percentage, and severity of abuse, as suited specific needs.
Fine levels of control are therefore possible; operators are not
reduced to all-or-nothing responses to abuse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't yet have the toolsets to implement Karsten's excellent advice,
though I admire its judicious approach.  Lacking those, I mostly rely on 
the previously described RFC-compliance checking (implemented via Exim
4.x callouts), SPF-checking, tarpitting, and intentionally very sparse
use of other lossy filtering.  Playing whack-a-mole on spam-source IPs
is mostly a losing game, with too much collateral damage.</p>
<p>Main exceptions are:  (1) Some IPs whose owning domains / companies I've
just seen much too often in that context, and accordingly have classed
as evil.  The French division of European broadband ISP Wanadoo is the
example that most comes to mind:  After seeing way, way too much blatant 
spam from IPs respolving to *.wanadoo.fr hostnames, I just started
adding them as they spammed me to /etc/exim4/eximconfig/reject/ip.
Legitimate French Wanadoo customers will increasiingly be SOL in
sending mail to any address on my machine, which is a little unfair but
life's imperfect.</p>
<p>It's basically a moral judgement on my part that Wanadoo should do much
better, and that therefore it <em>and</em> its users can go to Hell.  This
isn't very nice of me, and possibly isn't a wise long-term measure, but
it <em>feels</em> good.  ;-&gt;</p>
<p>(2) IPs whose surrounding facts make them seem like IPs from pools of
virus-infected Windows desktop machines being abused to crank out
virusgrams, UCE, etc.  One can reasonably guess that nothing from those
IPs will ever be legitimate, for at least 3-5 year values of &quot;ever&quot;.</p>
<p>It would be good if entreis in /etc/exim4/eximconfig/reject/ip 
entries (and similar files for related purposes) were at least 
date-stamped and would time out:  They aren't and don't.  My maintaining 
such a file manually is not very satisfactory and has obvious drawbacks.
Over time, I hope to phase it out -- and maybe even pull Wanadoo out of
its oubliette.</p>

<p>Abstract:  &quot;BGP router data may be used to identify contiguous regions of
network space from which significant abuse is observed.  Experience
suggests a strong power-law relationship in ranking such sources.
Applying this knowledge in abuse countermeasures may markedly reduce
filtering overhead while minimizing inadvertant blocking and increasing
total costs to abuse-tolerant networks.&quot;</p>

	>[OT] Monash University controls the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine</H3>


<p><small>Thu, 27 Apr 2006 </small></p>
<p><strong>From Rick Moen 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>

<pre><strong>Quoting Keith Owens (kaos@ocs.com.au):

&gt; A survey of DNS security[1] has this lovely quote
&gt;
&gt;   "A cracker that controls a nameserver at Monash University in
&gt;   Australia can end up controlling the resolution of the web site for
&gt;   the Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine. Legacy DNS creates a small
&gt;   world after all".
&gt;
&gt; It is scary to see how [potentially] insecure the DNS mesh is.
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Dan Kaminsky gave an amazingly entertaining and enlightening lecture at
the LISA 2005 conference, in part about his own studies of the global
DNS, to determine among other things how vulnerable to cache poisoning
it is:  Answer: a great deal.  There are way, way too many vulnerable
BIND8, BIND4 and other (e.g., Microsoft) vulnerable nameservers out there.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Dan was able to set up a machine with sufficient bandwidth and
horsepower that it's been able to conduct scans of all IP space,
everywhere, doing various tests and mapping out all responding
nameservers.  He says he "got calls from some very scary places" in so
doing (since such scans normally precede a large-scale network attack),
but he's been able to placate them.  (The IP reverse-resolves to
"infrastructure-audit-1.see-port-80.doxpara.com", the Web pages on
which explain his probes when they're active, and include his cellular
number for any inquiries.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Also, if you do a "whois" on his netblock, you get return values that
include these lines:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>  Comment:    This is a security research project, please send all
  Comment:    abuse and alert requests to dan@doxpara.com.
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
His summary results (from 50GB of collected data) included:
</STRONG></P>

<p><Strong><ul>
<!-- * He profiled 2.5M verified nameservers.  (There may be up to 9M total, but 2.5M responded.) -->

<LI>He profiled 2.5M verified nameservers.  (There may be up to 9M total, but 2.5M responded.)

<!-- * Almost 10% of them, 230 thousand, forwarded queries to BIND8.  Eek! -->

<LI>Almost 10% of them, 230 thousand, forwarded queries to BIND8.  Eek!

<!-- * At least 13 thousand Windows nameservers forward to BIND8. -->

<LI>At least 13 thousand Windows nameservers forward to BIND8.

<!-- * He found probable evidence of large-scale cache poisoning already in progress, but isn't yet ready to discuss details. -->

<LI>He found probable evidence of large-scale cache poisoning already in progress, but isn't yet ready to discuss details.
</ul></Strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
As an afterthought, he realised that his test harness also enabled him
to estimate the penetration of Sony's infamous Windows rootkit, as
measured by its effect on the world's nameservers:  All infected
machines' rootkit software feeds data back to connected.sonymusic.com,
reached by hostname (thus entailing resolution at some local nameserver,
which thus loads its cache).  Dan thus used his census of the world's
nameservers to send each a non-recursive "A" query:  This returned the
matching IP if and only if the value was already cached.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Result:  He found 556 thousand nameserver hosts with the cached value --
a quarter of the world.  (This is <em>  after  </em> massive publicity and
large-scale attempts to purge the rootkit.)  Oddly, these were across
165 countries, and suggests this reflects bootlegging of USA-labelled
music CDs.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Interesting remaining questions include estimating (through
traffic-level studies) how many infected Windows clients this result
reflects.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
...and he's working on other ways to further exploit his DNS data.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Dan's a maniac.  At the <em>  prior  </em> LISA conference, he'd demonstrated
streaming audio over DNS packets -- to illustrate exactly how porous
most people's "firewall" strategies are.  Because he heard that many
people had dismissed that as "Well, that's just low bitrate; couldn't be
significant", <em>  this  year, he demonstrated streaming  video  </em> over DNS.

<p><small>Tue, 09 May 2006 </small></p>
<p><strong>From Rick Moen 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Our cherished Ma Bell reincarnation, SBC (which is in the middle of
re-naming itself to AT&amp;T, thus completing the circle), found a creative
way to screw up relocation of our telephone service:  They unilaterally
rescheduled it (for fairly dumb reasons) -- and then decided not to tell
us.  As a reminder, this matter affects lists.linuxgazette.net's online
presence because its Raw Bandwidth Communications DSL service piggybacks
atop SBC's line.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What happened, you ask?  Here are my wife and me, about 5:20 pm Monday,
sitting on the living room floor, calling Ma Bell from our still-active
telephone:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>  Deirdre:  "Hey, what happened to the telephone move order you guys
  agreed with me to perform today for 650-561-9820?  It's not happening."

  SBC:  "Er, that job is listed in our records as rescheduled to
  Wednesday."

  Deirdre:  "WHAT?  Why?"

  SBC:  "Well, the outgoing occupants had not released the line, and so
  it would not be available to you until they did, which would be when
  they scheduled shutoff, i.e., Wednesday."

  Deirdre:  "And you were somehow incapable of ascertaining this fact at
  the time you committed to a _Monday_ due date -- because, what, you're
  more accustomed to hanging draperies for a living?  And you were
  incapable of calling my contact telephone number to advise us of the
  delay because you needed, what, smoke signals?  Semaphores?  Telegraph
  lines?  Carrier pigeons?"

  SBC:  {mumble}  {snivel}
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Anyhow, considerations of logic and customer service do not apply, so
it's going to be Wednesday -- which means our new house will be sans
telephone and DSL service until then.  Our <em>  old  </em> house still has
service, and our servers are still camped out on the living room floor
-- but I'm removing them tonight in order to turn over the house to the
landlords.  So, from around 10 PM tonight until SBC/AT&amp;T reconnects
telphone service, and then I reconnect the DSL -- probably around a full
day, unless things get further screwed up.

How could I possibly miss it?  For those of us who grew up on the Doctor
(my canonical one being Jon Pertwee, the third Doctor), it's a
veritable dream come true.  I'm undecided whether "Father's Day" or
"Dalek" should get my vote for the short-form Best Dramatic Presentation
Hugo Award:  They both blew me away.

<blockQuote>
BTW:  I'm about 60km south of San Francisco, in the Silicon Valley
Desert -- and am indeed guilty of being a Yank.  However, I grew up in
7B Bowen Road flat 19A, Victoria, Hong Kong, Royal Crown Colony, where
your only choices in television were Rediffusion Television (sort of a
Granada/Carlton ancestor, under the 1968 ITV franchise round) or
Cantonese opera.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I saw a great deal of 'Doctor Who' and first-run 'The Prisoner', in
consequence -- not to mention coming up with much fine MST3K-style
replacement dialogue for Cantonese operas, with my mother.  All of which
explains a great deal, I'm sure.
