By now most of use with an interest in the software industry and/or in
the free software movement have probably heard of Microsoft's latest
legal maneuvers, an offer to settle the remaining local antitrust cases
(brought by many state's attorneys general) by <b>providing computers and
software</b> to U.S. public schools.

</p><p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Please don't put me in de <b>bre'r patch</b>!  Anything
but that!&quot;<CITE>-- Uncle Remus</CITE>
</blockquote>
<p>

I can't believe that I'm alone in seeing this as playing into
Microsoft's hands.  If practically all of our children are raised
running nothing but Microsoft software, then that's what they'll expect
in college and throughout their careers.  

</p><p>
Microsoft should be paying dearly to gain such a lucrative franchise.  
This is a far cry from punishment or remediation.  Indeed, it is 
antithetical to restoring competition to the software industry.

</p><p>
As a Linux user and enthusiast, I don't care about Microsoft.  I never
believed that the Federal antitrust case would be effective; and I
see the various state and private suits as being mere echos to that.
The Europeans might see more effective measures taken by their EC, 
but that is unlikely.  However, as an observer of the software industry, 
and a veteran in various segments of that market I have to re-iterate my 
views on the matter.


</p><p>
The only effective and fair remedies in this case must relate to the
software.  Specifically Microsoft must be required to publish source 
code to complete and working reference implementations of each protocol,
API, and file format that they use in any of their applications and 
operating systems.  They must be forbidden from distributing new software
until the reference implementations are published.  The reference 
implementations must be in the public domain (freely usable by all for
free and commercial works).

</p><p>
In other words, given that Microsoft has become the standard in the
industry (at least in part through illegal and anti-competitive means)
then they bear the burden of providing enough information to everyone
else to <b>ensure</b> interoperability.

</p><p>
We could argue endlessly about the adequacy of documentation, and the
need to publish "internal" programming interfaces or "administrative"
protocols.  This would be a miscarriage of justice.  Requiring a reference
implementation for a set of command line primitive utilities, in 
ANSI standard C and/or C++ (no MSC or MFC entanglements) provides an
unambiguous standard for their compliance.  Either the requisite reference
tools can perform the designated (minimal) functions over their protocols,
on their target files, or calling their OS/library components, or MS is
fined and enjoined from further distribution.

</p><p>
Note that this approach does not force MS to publish the sources to their
OS or their applications.  They are free to create an independent reference 
implementation.  Of course that would be a expense to them; the cheapest
path to compliance would be for them to engineer their software with a 
core (that would separately constitute the reference suite) and then
add their UI elements on top of that.

</p><p>
However, it is vital that they be prohibited from releases new software
until the reference suite is shown to provide the requisite interoperability.
It's also critical that the remedy encompass protocols, APIs, and file formats.

</p><p>
Any less is just another example of government and big business posturing
to the public while cutting their own backroom deals to line the pockets
of the politicians and lockout the "little guy" businesses.
