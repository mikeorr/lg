<p>The basic principle of graphic design has been the same since Gutenberg
first created moveable type: provide information in a form that best
communicates it to the viewer. It's what distinguishes graphic design from
pure art, and good design from pure crap. It is also a principle largely
ignored by people who create for both print and the web.

<p>Note that I distinguish between 'people who create' and 'designers'. In
the last twenty years, technology has made it relatively easy to create
text and images, whether printed on paper or displayed on screen, and there
are many people who do so, both amateur and professional. As a benchmark,
the current Google page count is over four billion and going up every day,
yet how many of them communicate well? Design, good design, is what
separates pounds of content, acres of pretty images, or megabytes of snappy
web animation from the effective presentation of information.

<p>In future columns I will provide design concepts that will help you
decide how well your own design work communicates with the viewer, and also
point you to some on-line resources for further study. These will include
grid, hierarchy, font usage, nesting and linking, color ways, sensory
overload, and image paradigms.

<p>What I will <b>not</b> cover will be the latest tool or CSS trick; there
are a lot of books, articles, and sites out there for both. I will also not
discuss the right plug-in to use with a particular piece of software. There
are too many combinations of hardware, software, and user skill for me to
provide useful and unbiased advice about any one of them. This column will
cover graphic design, pure and simple.

<p>Nothing I tell you will make you a good designer. There are certain
talents that are innate; I can neither play the piano nor pole vault. Just
like the piano and the pole vault, however, you become better at this craft
by practice, and I may be able to make you a better designer by changing
how you look at what you do. 

<p>Places to look for what graphic design is, and what it isn't:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/whatisgraphicdesign">The view of the national organization of graphic designers</a>
<li> <a href="http://edweb.sdsu.edu/courses/ET650_online/MAPPS/GDBasics.html">Not a pretty site, but one with useful content</a>
<li> <a href="http://www.designinteract.com">Communication Arts, the grandfather of design magazines, now on-line</a>
<li> Two good magazines about design, one US and one UK:<br>
<a href="http://www.printmag.com">http://www.printmag.com</a><br>
<a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com">http://www.eyemagazine.com</a>
<li> <a href="http://lynnster.com/saints.html">The patron saints of graphic design</a> (tongue in cheek, but true)
</ul>

<p>Interactivity is what sets this medium apart from a book or magazine, so
I look forward to your comments and suggestions; between us we can provide
useful tools for improving the presentation of information.

<em>
<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven
years old, and the state of the art was typing copy on Gestetner masters.
I've worked on every new technology since, but I still own an X-acto knife
and know how to use it.

<p> I've been a freelancer, and worked in advertising agencies, printing
companies, publishing houses, and marketing organizations in major
corporations. I also did a dozen years [1985-1997] at Apple Computer; my
first Macintosh was a Lisa with an astounding 1MB of memory, and my current
one is a Cube with a flat screen.

<p> I've had a website up since 1997, and created my latest one in 2004. I'm
still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.
