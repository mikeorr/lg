<P>

<H3> More Audience Questions and Answers </H3>

<FONT COLOR="#006600">Again, these are somewhat paraphrased, either because
I couldn't hear the exact question or couldn't write fast enough.  (Then again,
most of this report is paraphrased.)</FONT>
<P>

<I>What if price were factored out of the <A HREF=
 "http://www.redhat.com/redhat/datapro.html">Datapro survey</A>?  How would
 Linux fare then?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Larry Augustin</B> pointed out that Linux not only won overall but
       also in specific categories like reliability and technical support (in
       which NT was at the bottom).
   <LI><B>Robert Hart</B> noted that the survey covered hard-core IS folks at
       corporate data centers, for whom price would be less of an issue anyway.
</UL>
<P>

<I>There's no consolidated Linux answer source--how can I deal with management's
 need to ``feel secure'' about their software?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Robert Hart</B> note that there's <I>lots</I> of commercial support
       available (including from Red Hat).
   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B> felt that the question was ``somewhat of a red
       herring''--managers just want to have heard of it and are really using
       the issue as a weapon, not as a real reason.  If a manager is secure
       enough about the need for Linux, he'll do so.
   <LI><B>Jeremy Allison</B>:  ``I know a fair amount about NT and security
       and would convince your manager not to feel secure about NT.''
</UL>
<P>

<I>What about the perception that Linux users don't like paying for
 software?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Robert Hart</B> handled this one; he said it's ``not an issue''--among
       other things, Red Hat wouldn't be in business if that were true, since
       the $50 Red Hat distribution can be downloaded for free from many ftp
       sites.
</UL>
<P>

<I>Why is Open Source important to the public?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Jeremy Allison</B>:  It's the same as open government; you can check
       up on it.
   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B>:  The public should be relieved that it
       exists--most will never need it, but the <I>option</I> to look at it
       is there and provides a level of safety (not just the feeling of safety).
</UL>
<P>

<I>For Linus:  who of the major RDBMS's have talked to you about ports?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B>:  ``No one has talked to <I>me</I> about it.''  He
       went on to say that, when originally asked, his reaction was that RDBMS's
       are ``an example of something so boring that they will never be free.''
       (``I was wrong about that--some people find them really exciting.  I'm
       just not one of them.'')
   <LI><B>Larry Augustin</B> said he thought we'd probably see ports becoming
       available over the next year (or something like that).
   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B>:  ``He's saying that he knows but can't talk about
       it.''  <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>Note the previously mentioned InfoWorld
       Electric articles on the soon-to-be-announced <A HREF=
       "http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980717.whinformix.htm"
       >Informix</A> and <A HREF=
       "http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980717.whorlinux.htm"
       >Oracle 8</A> Linux ports.  Also keep in mind that <A HREF=
       "http://www.cai.com/">Computer Associates</A> announced a Linux port of
       <A HREF="http://www.ingres.com/"><B>Ingres II</B></A> earlier this
       month, available in September.</I>]</FONT>
</UL>
<P>

<I>From one of the <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</A> developers:  what
 does the Open Source world do about patent issues, such as the Pantone color
 management system and LZW algorithm used in GIF and TIFF?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B> said that patents, especially software patents,
       are ``a can of worms'' and are probably the biggest danger to Open
       Source.  They do eventually expire, but it's looong time.  His suggestion
       was to come up with an even better algorithm that's patent-free.
   <LI><B>Larry Augustin</B> asked developers who run into such problems to
       make them known to Linux International.
   <LI><B>Jeremy Allison</B>:  ``It's really hideous.''  But he noted that the
       ``most insane'' patents are in the US, which means the US effectively
       ends up exporting jobs and development to other countries.  Encryption
       is a prime example of this sort of thing
       <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>although that's more an
       issue of regulation than of patents</I>]</FONT>.
</UL>
<P>

<I>From a C|Net admin:  I would like a better BIOS, like Sun's.</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Sunil Saxena</B> said that that's coming next year.
   <LI><B>Larry Augustin</B> said he's got a stack of BIOS-related NDAs on his
       desk...
   <LI><B>Robert Hart</B> commented that modern BIOS support (e.g., remote
       upgrades) is ``<I>really</I> important for 1000-node clusters.''
</UL>
<P>

<I>Will we see wide use of Internet clusters as supercomputers?  Will Linux
 have a 3D user interface like <FONT COLOR="#006600">[vapor-]</FONT>Chrome?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Larry Augustin</B> pointed out that 3D apps like POV-Ray and Quake II
       running on the Mesa OpenGL clone library were being demoed in the rear.
   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B> said that clustering software like <A HREF=
       "http://www.beowulf.org/">Beowulf</A> is great for 3D rendering
       <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>and many large scientific
       applications</I>]</FONT> but not well suited to business apps.
       <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I><A HREF="mailto:ejr@cise.ufl.edu">Jason
       Riedy</A> pointed out on <A HREF=
       "http://slashdot.org/articles/980719/1413242.shtml">Slashdot</A> that
       distributed database systems are one category of business application
       for which Beowulf <B>is</B> well suited.</I>]</FONT>
       <!-- I thought Jeremy was responsible for this one, but the questioner,
            Dan Kaminsky (effugas@best.com), wrote and said it was Linus. -->
</UL>
<P>

<I>Will Willows provide a Win32 subsystem for Linux?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B> said that the software he was looking for is WINE;
       it's not perfect (in fact, ``it does very few things perfectly''), but it
       does a good job, and there are people using it to run Quicken and Word.
   <LI><B>Jeremy Allison</B> disagreed; he said that WINE and Willows may get
       to the point that they're OK for some apps, but Quicken and other old
       apps ``are not what people want.''  Samba is OK because it's only based
       on wire protocols, and Microsoft can't change those without pissing off
       their huge customer base.  But ``<I>every app</I> is an OS
       upgrade''--Microsoft can mutate the APIs faster than developers can keep
       up.
</UL>
<P>

<I>From a web-site developer:  I have to have two machines, a Linux-based web
 server and a Windows box for Photoshop--how much longer will I have to do that?
 Also, a marketing question: there's a Microsoft talking Barney; when will we
 see Talking Tux?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI>A <B>SVLUG guy</B> took the second question first; he said he knows an
       engineer who is hacking the weak encryption built into Barney (i.e., one
       will be able to write Linux apps for it).
   <LI><B>Larry Augustin</B> pointed to the <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/"
       >GIMP</A>, a free, Photoshop-like application running on some of the
       demo machines.
   <LI><B>Robert Hart</B> mentioned Corel's conversion to Linux, including
       CorelDRAW 8, and I think suggested that Adobe will have to respond to
       that or lose market share.
</UL>
<P>

<I>From a business-applications perspective, what can we do to get Microsoft to
 do native ports of Excel, Word, Powerpoint, Exchange, etc.?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Robert Hart</B> responded:  you can already read and write the files
       created by those apps; as for Exchange, ``we have something called
       Sendmail...'' <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>chuckles from the admins in the
       audience</I>]</FONT>  One of the panelists commented that if Microsoft
       ports their apps, ``we've won.''  <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>Of course,
       Apple didn't win...</I>]</FONT>
</UL>
<P>

<I>How about Linux branding on boxes to assure that shrink-wrapped apps are
 tested and safe?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Larry Augustin</B>:  Linux International is considering several such
       approaches, including the Linux Standard Base.
</UL>
<P>

<I>There's a proposed change to US state laws about reverse-engineering;
 what impact will it have?</I>
<P>

<UL>
   <LI>A <B>lawyer in the audience</B> stood up and gave some background:
       <A HREF="http://www.law.upenn.edu/library/ulc/ulc.htm#ucc2b">Draft
       Article 2B</A> of the proposed update to the Uniform Commercial Code
       (UCC), under consideration beginning <A HREF= 
       "http://www.nccusl.org/busag1.htm">26 July 1998</A>, has provisions that
       would prohibit ``Fair Use'' copying and reverse engineering, both of
       which are currently protected by US law.  
       <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I><A HREF=
       "http://www.institute.ieee.org/INST/dec97/law.html">IEEE summary for
       software engineers</A>; thanks to <A HREF="http://www3.hmc.edu/~mcope/"
       >Michael Cope</A> for the links</I>]</FONT>
       She also mentioned a bill that supposedly would abolish software patents
       and urged the Linux community to become politically active and look up
       addresses and phone numbers of government representatives on the web.
       <FONT COLOR="#006600">[<I>I've searched <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/"
       >Thomas</A> for such a bill, and the closest thing I can find is <A HREF=
       "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR00400:">H.R.400</A>, a
       major bill to update Title 35.  But I don't see anything in either the
       <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR00400:@@@D"
       >summary</A> or the amendments (moving link, sorry) about software
       and/or algorithmic patents, so perhaps I misheard or she
       misspoke.</I>]</FONT>
   <LI><B>Jeremy Allison</B> pointed out that you can find documentation for
       all of Microsoft's file formats on their web site.  He also said that in
       the case of compound (e.g., linked/embedded/active) documents, reality
       and posted documentation differ.
   <LI><B>Linus Torvalds</B>, clearly disgusted with US law as a whole, noted
       that the US, like France and Iraq, ``has a reputation for stupidity'' in
       such things as encryption (and patents and other legal issues).
