<p>Part of a mildly ludicrous thread in which people invent
objections to Don Marti's essay "Linuxmanship" (<a href=
"http://zgp.org/~dmarti/linuxmanship/">http://zgp.org/~dmarti/linuxmanship/</a>)
-- objections like "It's evil because it doesn't mention *BSD" --
for little better reason than this being the Internet, where being
a crank is the approved way to get attention.</p>

&gt;&gt; The exhortations on Don's page were a very positive force for the time
&gt;&gt; period in which they originated, and their substance is relatively
&gt;&gt; timeless, but the presentation strikes me as very "yesteryear" in 2006Q4.
&gt;&gt; Both the world of Linux and the rest of the world have passed it by.
&gt; 
&gt; Please do tell.  Which observations on it have become untrue or
&gt; inapplicable, please?  I find it still dead-on.

<p>A point-by-point would be much longer than the page itself.
Luckily, what you said below manages to touch on what I mean:</p>

&gt; Quoting Keith Keller (kkeller at speakeasy.net):
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; Question: why no mention of *BSD, which is possibly in many ways as good
&gt;&gt; as linux, or at the very least not a proprietary OS?  Yes, I understand
&gt;&gt; it's called *linux*manship, but it seems like not mentioning BSD at all
&gt;&gt; seems slightly disingenuous.
&gt; 
&gt; OK, I'll bite.
&gt; 
&gt; o  The page is a marketing essay on how to (and how not to) market 
&gt;    open-source software solutions based on Linux.  Why no mention of 
&gt;    BSD?  Probably because that's not the purpose for which he wrote
&gt;    the essay.
</pre>
<p>The purpose of the essay is the very first thing that has not
changed with the times. When it was written, Linux was "a better
solution, which just so happens to also be viable." Thus, advising
those who wish to promote and market Linux-based solutions to cast
aside thoughts and actions that might shine any kind of favorable
light on a non-Linux solution (presumably including *BSD and the
like) was very prudent. But:</p>
<p>1) Today, Linux is "the most viable solution, which just so
happens to also be better [than proprietary equivalents]."</p>
<p>2) What you described before regarding parasitically encumbering
preloads and the glut of consultants is far more true today than it
was then. These two developments very much work against the tone of
the essay. It's no wonder Keith mistook it to be disingenuous.
That's an impression one was not likely to get when it was written,
but in the world of today, that's an impression that should be
expected, in my estimation. I think that both of Edmund's two very
excellent recent posts (#2517 and #2534 in pipermail) are the best
descriptions I have seen of what really happens in the environments
where marketing of Linux-based solutions other than embedded
platforms occurs.</p>
<pre>
&gt;    Author permits verbatim mirroring, and adds "Please write for
&gt;    permission for other uses."  I'd speculate that he might bless
&gt;    any BSD advocate's desire to go to town with a derivative work
&gt;    tailored for that purpose.
</pre>
<p>I'd like to see such a work...</p>
<pre>
&gt; o  I'm guessing you're unaware that the word "disingenuous" 
&gt;    means "lacking candor, giving a false appearance of simple 
&gt;    frankness, calculatingly deceptive".  Which is a rather not-nice
&gt;    thing to say about the motives of someone you probably don't even
&gt;    know for no better reason than his having written a useful esssay.
</pre>
<p>As I touched on above, it seems the opposite is happening:
There's so much candor and simple frankness that it gives the false
appearance of being calculatingly deceptive. Ironic, isn't it?</p>

<p>Actually, you've just been introduced to the fine art of
charientism -- sort of like when an Englishman refers to someone as
"clever".</p>
<p>(It's a peculiarly English type of insult: Foreigners are
sometimes said to be "clever", i.e., tricky and untrustworthy. A
fine young Englishman with roughly the same qualities would be
described as "a smart lad".)</p>
<pre>
&gt; OK, this time I don't really see what you mean.

<p>I summarily denied your premise about the essay advising readers
to disregard non-Linux solutions.</p>
<pre>
&gt; &gt; Well, you know whom to contact.

<p>Not yet. Your arm broken?</p>
<pre>
&gt; &gt; And I thought <strong>I</strong> was a little paranoid.
&gt; 
&gt; It's just another example of the "sales resistance" you mentioned
&gt; before.
</pre>
<p>But I'm not selling -- and neither is the essay. The latter is a
set of techniques one might use in business to overcome objections
to a Linux-based solution. It is not an attempt to sway random
members of the public encountering it on the Web to adopt
Linux-based anything.</p>
<p>I imagine that Don's probably gotten a boatload of crank e-mail,
over the years, from OS-advocacy cretins making that exact
error.</p>
<p>I've gotten a few, myself. If I'm feeling polite, I might
respond to them the way I did in my Sydney Morning Herald / The Age
interview (<a href=
"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/26/1040511127721.html">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/26/1040511127721.html</a>):</p>
<p>Q: Do you think you could achieve more if your advocacy was a
little less strident?</p>
<p>A: I'm reminded of a story about the 19th century US public
speaker and political figure Robert G. Ingersoll, who was wildly
popular with the public but inspired influential "establishment"
detractors by being publicly non-religious: Some reporters came to
visit, and asked him about the rumours that his son had gotten
drunk during a wild party and fell unconscious under the table.
Ingersoll paused for effect, then started: "Well, first of all, he
didn't fall under the table. And he wasn't actually unconscious.
For that matter, he didn't fall. And there wasn't any party, and he
didn't have anything to drink.... And, by the way, I don't have a
son."</p>
<p>So it's not what I'd call strident, and I don't do advocacy. At
least, not in the usual sense of the term.</p>
<p>The usual sort of OS advocacy is what the "Team OS/2" crowd used
to do: They knew that their favourite software would live or die by
the level of corporate acceptance and release/maintenance of
proprietary shrink-wrapped OS/2 applications. They lobbied, they
lost, IBM lost interest, and now their favourite OS is effectively
dead.</p>
<p>But Linux is fundamentally different because it and all key
applications are open source: the programmer community that
maintains it is self-supporting, and would keep it advancing and
and healthy regardless of whether the business world and general
public uses it with wild abandon, only a little, or not at all.
Because of its open-source licence terms, its raw source code is
permanently available. Linux cannot be "withdrawn from the market"
at the whim of some company - as is slowly happening to OS/2. (Ed:
IBM finally pulled the plug on OS/2 on December 10.)</p>
<p>Therefore, Linux users are not in a zero-sum competition for
popularity with proponents of other operating systems (unlike, say,
OS/2, MS-Windows, and Mac OS users). I can honestly wish Apple
Computer well with their eye-pleasing and well-made (if a bit slow
and inflexible) Mac OS X operating system: wishing them well
doesn't mean wishing Linux ill.</p>
<p>Note that all of the identifiable "Linux companies" could blow
away in the breeze like just so much Enron stock, and the advance
of Linux would not be materially impaired, because what matters is
source code and the licensing thereof, which has rather little to
do with any of those firms' fortunes.</p>
<p>Further, and getting back to your original point, I honestly
don't care if you or anyone else gets "converted" to Linux. I don't
have to. I'm no better off if you do; I'm no worse off if you
don't.</p>
<p>What I do care about is giving making useful information and
help available to people using Linux or interested in it. Why?
Partly to redeem the trust shown by others when they helped me.
Partly because it's interesting. Partly because researching and
then teaching things I usually start knowing little about is the
best way I know to learn. And partly out of pure, unadulterated
self-interest: people knowing your name is at least a foot in the
door, in the IT business.</p>
<p>As to stridency, there <em>is</em> a well-known problem of all
on-line discussion media. Some people become emotionally invested
in positions they've taken in technical arguments, and
gratuituously turn technical disagreements into verbal brawls. And
unfortunately they tend to be drawn to people like me who attempt
to state their views clearly and forcefully. It's as if you were to
say "I like herring" and thereby summon every dedicated
herring-hater within a hundred-mile radius. The problem comes with
the territory.</p>
<p>But that causes occasional unpleasantness and back-biting
<em>among</em> some on-line Linux users, not an aspect of
"advocacy", which isn't something we have much use for, generally -
especially where the term refers to convincing the unwilling.</p>
<p>And, in conclusion, herring-haters suck ass.</p>

<p>I've heard it said - and find this to be true in enough cases to
be useful as a rough guide - that men often try to stimulate
conversation by disagreement, while women generally do the opposite
(this provides a highly amusing view of teenagers' conversations
involving the apposite sex, which tend to illustrate this, or
something very close to it.) If so, then the Net often appears to
