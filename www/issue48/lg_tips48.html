Sat, 30 Oct 1999 21:48:16 -0700
<BR>From: David &lt;<A HREF="mailto:elvii@writeme.com">elvii@writeme.com&gt;</A>

<P> Well, this topic has been covered a number of times, but one minor nit
from your "Mounting a zip disk" in issue #47 - the printed tip reads:

<P> 1) Compile in IDE Floppy support in the kernel - there is no need for
scsi emulation unless you want auto-eject support. Also remember to
compile in support for the filesystems you wish to have on your zip
disks. 

<P> Under Debian potato, kernel 2.2.13, eject version 2.0.2, I am able to
eject the zip disk from the ATAPI zip drive without using ide-scsi
emulation.  I've been able to eject it this way at least since 2.2.5 or
so, I believe, thou I'm not sure quite when I found this out.  I didn't
have the zip when I ran 2.0.x kernels, so ide-scsi might've been needed
there, but not anymore, it seems.

<P> David

Pentium in it, tweaked the speed switches until it came up, attached the hard

<P> No [active partition] found
DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER

<P> This is the first time I have seen a motherboard *require* that relic of the
DOS age, the bootable partition.

<P> Unlike the Winmodem, there is a way around this. Run cfdisk and set one of the
partitions on hda as the active partition.

<P> Hello Mr. Reid:

<P> In your article "Running UNIX At Home" in LinuxGazette #47 you wrote:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	None of my cron jobs, like updating locate's database and trimming the
	log files, were being done since the computer was hardly ever on in the
	wee hours of the morning, the time chosen by the distributions
	(Slackware, then Red Hat 3.0.3, then 5.1) for housecleaning.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Like most home users, I have also stumbled across cron not running the
programs it should because of my computer being off. Although the script you
provide looks great, I was wondering if you know that there already are, to my
knowledge, two programs that resolve this very same issue: anacron and hc-cron
(sorry, I have not an URL to give, but I bet that a search to
http://freshmeat.net would be useful.)


<P> In the same article you also mention that to change runlevels you
stop/start starter scripts by hand [...]

<P> You can do this in a more convenient manner by using /sbin/telinit, giving
it the runlevel you want to change to. To change from any runlevel to runlevel
3 you would just type (as root, of course): /sbin/telinit 3 and that is all. As
far as I know, all your programs will be SIGTERM or SIGKILL by doing this,
while starter scripts will be called to start/stop services as needed.

<P> I hope this information is of any help to you. I also deeply hope not to
have
made any big mistake in what I have said.

<P> Best wishes.

	First, with regard to your cron problems, you might consider using
	hc-cron.
	Here is Freshmeat's description of it...
	
	<P>hc-cron will remember the time when it was shut down and catch

	Debian installation offers "profiles" nowadays. The "Personal
	workstation" profile includes anacron.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> That's great, but groundskeeper will make sure that the commands are run at
*convienient times for the users* as closely to the specified intervals as
machine uptime permits.  In other words, it uses batch and the others don't.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	You have a very good point here. I filed it as a wishlist item for

	to whoever maintains the program itself.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Second, with regard to your runlevel usage, while you can write scripts
	for starting your networking mechanisms, and there are valid reasons
	for doing so, you can also change your runlevel without rebooting by
	executing, as root, 'init X' where x is the runlevel. So you can start
	at runlevel 4, then use init 3 to drop to runlevel 3 and start those
	scripts, then use either init 0 to shutdown, or init 6 to restart your
	system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> This was the other thing people wrote to remind me: use init (or sysinit) to
switch runlevels without rebooting.  It's very useful; in going from 4 (no
internet) to 3 (internet) it stops and restarts some services that look like
they could have been left alone, but it does the job in a one line command!

<P> Thanks for everyone's feedback.

<P> If what you want is a telnet program for windows that's better than

Kevterm is a very simple vt100 emulating telnet client. It's biggest

low feature count, but fully working software, and Kevterm is that in
spades. It does everything I need

<P> http://tucows.mirror.ac.uk/term95.html (or the same page at any more local
TUCOWS mirror) contains a list of telnet clients for Win95/98, including
some freeware and lots of shareware.  I seem to remember having heard good
things in the past about Tera Term Pro (which is free and has a SSH
plug-in available, if you care about that).


<P><STRONG>From: Jonathan Hutchins &lt;<A HREF="mailto:hutchins@kc.net">hutchins@kc.net&gt;</A>:</STRONG>

<P> Look for a program called "TerraTerm" on your favorite shareware site.
There are modules for SSH connections available.

<P> Good terminal emulators can cost $250 per workstation, and can eat up a lot
of resources for graphic and keyboard mapping (IBM's Personal Communications
Suite, Reflections).  TerraTerm will do 95% of what you want with a
reasonable footprint similar to Microsoft's Telnet.

<P> Try TeraTerm. I got mine from srp.stanford.edu; it's a doctored version that

Linux does. TeraTerm does colors, but the keyboard isn't perfect, and I have to
use u and d in less instead of pgup and pgdn.

<P> If you are looking for a better telnet for a Windows machine, you might
check out Tera Term Pro:

<P> teranishi@rikaxp.riken.go.jp

<P> It is much nicer than the plain jane Telnet that comes with Windows.

<P> I am aware of no totally free X servers that run under Windows.  If you
will settle for a nonfree but cheap Windows X server, try the MicroImages
X server 2.0 (or latest) from www.microimages.com.  It's pretty plain, but
works fine for connecting to Linux X clients.  And it's pretty inexpensive,=
 too.

Boot your rescue floppy and mount your root filesystem on for

Then remove any software from/or your other OS(?) that is capable of

<P>  and

<H4>From: Steve Phipps &lt;<A HREF="mailto:steve@sjp1.freeserve.co.uk">steve@sjp1.freeserve.co.uk&gt;</A>:</H4>

<P> I use Freeserve with Red Hat Linux and find that it works perfectly
well.

<P> I have no idea what the problem is in your case, so I'll go through my 
configuration in detail. Hopefully this will enable you to find the
fault - you can always copy my setup if all else fails!

<PRE>
First of all, ensure that the file /etc/hosts.allow contains the line

ALL: LOCAL

, that /etc/hosts.deny contains the line

ALL: ALL

, that /etc/resolv.conf conatins the lines

search .
nameserver 195.92.195.94

(the number is the IP address of Freeserve's nameserver) and that
/etc/hosts contains the line

127.0.0.1   localhost

Next you need a chat script, which should be placed in the file
/etc/ppp/chatscript. Mine, which is fairly basic, is as follows:

# Set abort conditions
ABORT 'NO CARRIER'
ABORT BUSY
ABORT 'NO DIALTONE'

# Set a nice long timeout because Freeserve can be a bit slow
TIMEOUT 120

# Reset modem
'' ATZ

# Dial (0845) 079 6699
SAY 'Dialling Freeserve...\n'
OK ATDT08450796699

# Log in to remote machine
CONNECT ''
SAY 'Connection established, logging in...\n'
ogin: <username>
word: <password>

# Log in complete
SAY 'Log in successful...\n'
</PRE>

<P> Obviously, replace <username> and <password> with the appropriate values
for your account. See  man chat  if you want to write your own script.

<P> Finally, you need to initiate PPP. I have a file called dialup in my
home directory which simply contains the command

<PRE>
exec pppd connect 'chat -v -f /etc/ppp/chatscript' -detach crtscts \
  modem defaultroute /dev/ttyS1 38400
</PRE>

<P> See  man pppd  if you want to know what's going on here. To connect to
the Internet, make sure that you're in your home directory and enter

<PRE>
source dialup
</PRE>

<P> (you'll have to su first). You should now be connected! Once you're
finished, just hit Ctrl-c to terminate the connection.

<P> This should be enough to connect to Freeserve from a stand-alone
terminal. I'm assuming that PPP is installed on your machine and that
your modem is connected to the second serial port (/dev/ttyS1, or COM2
under DOS).

<P> If this still doesn't work, look in /var/log/messages. That should tell
you why the connection failed.

<P> Good luck!

<P> The examples above avoid this, but they are kludgey.

<P> If you wish to run the *same* command from "at", then make it a shell

<PRE>
        at -f my-script noon
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
        at noon &lt; my-script
</PRE>

<P> Otherwise, just use a pipe:
<PRE>
        echo command | at noon

<P> Granted, this is non-intuitive, but it is the way "at" has worked for
over 20 yrs.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	My question to all of you in the industry is this: What parts of Linux,
	and the networking of same, are most important to you? Should there be
	more concentration in TCP/IP fundamentals (which I have included),
	specific Linux/*ix-based programs ( KDE, Gnome, Apache), or which? What
	is it that you most desire in an entry-level (or not-so-entry-level)
	employee candidate?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> I think you should leave the TCP/IP stuff for a Networking class - it's
pretty independent of LINUX, and spending a lot of time on it would
shortchange the Linux specific material.

<P> I think there are two basic categories to Linux - First, setting a system
up, getting it running correctly and getting software installed for whatever
end-use is in mind.  Second, ongoing administration - program updates,
troubleshooting, setting changes, maintaining things from routing tables to
firewall patches.

<P> I would look at the Microsoft "Installing and Configuring" classes for the
first level.  Start with planning:  hardware selection and compatibility,
selecting network topology and protocol, determining what services will run,
etc.  Work with such indefinates as how to configure Xwindows for something
like the Asus SP97-V which isn't correctly supported by the install scripts.
Work on building install scripts for the various distribs like Linux and
Caldera that allow you to build your own.  Mention common wierdnesses - like
the fact that Linux brings up Network cards first, then serial ports, which
is the opposite of DOS and means that in a conflict it will be the serial
port instead of the NIC that fails.

<P> Ongoing admin can be anything from finding module and library dependencies
to compiling custom kernels.  How to keep the patches and updates current
without scrambling the system with multiple installations of common
libraries.  Strategies for testing updates before rolling them out to
production.

<P> The first class would be most of what someone would need to maintain a
single-user workstation or a home router/server.  Some topics wold cross
over - installing and updating new Xwindows software would be of concern to
the person setting up a new system and adding productivity software, to the
individual maintaining a single-user workstation, and to the system
administrator rolling out a new WordPerfect to a 100 user office.  Probably
the basics would be covered in the first class, and the strategies for a
large rollout in the second.

<P> Anyway, there's what I think.  Let us know what you end up with.

<P> Dear Jim 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Your email did help me to solve the problem with the telnet in
	linux. It works fine now. Thanks a million.....

	I have a small doubt. Let me explain...... My network has a NT
	server, LINUX server and 20 windows 95 clients. I followed your
	instructions and added the address of all the clients into the
	/etc/hosts file on the LINUX machine and voila the telnet worked
	immediately.
	
	But the NT server was the one who was running a DHCP server and
	dynamically allocating the addresses to the clients. The clients
	were configured to use DHCP and were not statically given and ip
	addresses. I managed to see the current DHCP allocation for each
	client and add those address into the /etc/hosts file on the LINUX
	server but my doubt is what happens when the DHCP address for the
	client changes? Then again we'll have to change the address in the
	/etc/hosts file right? This seems silly. Is there anyway to make the
	LINUX hosts file to automatically pick up the DHCP address from the
	NT server?
	
	Also another important thing is I am still unable to ping from the
	NT server to the LINUX server using the name. It works only with the
	IP address. Is there any way to make the NT DHCP to recognize the
	LINUX server?
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
	Well, either you shouldn't use dynamic addressing (DHCP) or you
	should use dynamic DNS. You could also disable TCP Wrappers (edit
	your /etc/inetd.conf to change lines like:
	
<PRE>
telnet  stream  tcp nowait  root/usr/sbin/tcpd  in.telnetd
</PRE>
	
	... to look more like:
	
<PRE>
telnet  stream  tcp nowait  root/usr/sbin/in.telnetd in.telnetd
</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> There's no need to do this.  hosts.allow and hosts.deny allow
network/netmask specifications.  So lets say our user's DHCP assigns
from the simple class C 192.168.0.1 - 192.168.0.255. In hosts.allow we 
can then put:

<PRE>
in.telnetd: 192.168.0.
</PRE>

<P>    -- OR --

<PRE>
in.telnetd: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0
</PRE>

<P> you can also allow/deny based on host or domain name:

<P> in.telnetd: .domain.com


<P> Then you won't need mappings in /etc/hosts for the current DHCP
assigned address.  You may want to do dynamic DNS if you need the
hostnames of the windows workstations.  Then point the linux box's
resolv.conf at your NT server with the DNS mappings.  Or, better
still, make the linux box your DHCP server/DNS server and use BIND 8's 
dynamic DNS features.

<P> Windows also has a HOSTS file with a format identical to /etc/hosts in
the windows or winnt directory.  You'll find the entry for localhost
already in it.  You can add the linux box's IP there for name
resolution.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	(and comment out all of the services you don't need while you're at
	it).  
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Definitely a good idea.

<P> Microsoft's answer to this problem is to run the Windows Internet Name
Service - WINS.  This provides NetBIOS name resolution to dynamic addresses
as assigned by WindowsNT DHCP.  The WindowsNT DNS system will also allow you
to provide Internet Name resolution for dynamic addresses.  Since you're
mostly running WIndows95 clients, these clients can be pointed to the WINS
server via the variables on the DHCP server, and will be able to resove
addresses for TELNET and other services.  (Be sure to take advantage of the
WINS node-type configuration in DHCP too - it reduces broadcast traffic for
name resolution.)  If you need non-Windows applications or clients to
resolve names, you'll need the DNS system as well.

<P> Another solution is to go into the DHCP configuration and make each IP
Address assignment a "reserved" address - reserved for the MAC address of a
given machine.  That way, you have the advantages of centralised
administration of Internet paramaters such as Gateway and DNS servers
without having the IP addresses change unless you tell them to.

<P> Finally, the Microsoft implementation of the LMHOSTS and HOSTS files allows
using an "INCLUDE" statement to link to a central address file (on the
server, for instance).  This lets you use these files instead of WINS and
DNS (respectively), but maintain the tables in a single, central file.

<P> I currently have an i740 AGP system running under Linux.  The problem is
that, back when Red Hat version 5 came out, Intel was refusing to release

Red Hat's urging, if I recall), and the source code for that X Server was
released.  Since then, the source code has been cleaned up, and  
incorporated into the standard SVGA server for XFree86.

<P> The i740 works very well with the XFree86 SVGA server, but only in
versions 3.3.4 and later.  Red Hat 5 has a much earlier version, but it
probably can be upgraded with a little effort.  You're probably better off

least 16 MB to get a somewhat usable X environment, but 32 or 64 MB 
would be better. It sounds like your system is swapping a lot to get
Netscape to load.

<P> I would recommend you switch from KDE to a less memory intensive Window
Manager (try fvwm1). Netscape itself is also quite big, although older
versions (3.x) are smaller then new ones.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> I have 2 questions: 
	
	I have partitioned my HD in 4 partitions. 
	
	1.1 - Win98 (Filesystem is FAT-Win95) <BR>
	2.Linux Swap <BR>
	3.Linux OS <BR>
	4.Personal Data (Filesystem is FAT-Win95) <BR>
	
	Questions 1.<BR>
	Both the FAT-Win95 Filesystem Partitoins get mounted properly in Linux
	but the problem is that only root has
	read/write/execute permission. The other users only have read/execute
	permissions.How can I have it set up so that
	everyone had r/w/x permission to the mounted filesystems (and all the
	subdirectories within them) 

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Here's a solution. When you mount the partition, use this command:
<PRE>
mount -t vfat -o umask=000 partition mountpoint
</PRE>

<P> You might use a slightly differnet command (aside the -o umask=000
option). The thing is: you need to put -o umask=000 somewhere. This
command makes all files/directories mode 777 (r/w/x) for everybody
(owner, group and other).

<P> This doesn't add attributes which aren't originally present. Normally
when root mounts, the write-attribute is removed from every file when
you mount it (since root has usually umask 022 - group and other don't
get write permissions when new files are created. If you use umask in a
mount command every file that is on that filesystem will be treated like
it has just been created (to put it simple)). If a file is marked
read-only by Windows, the mount program will see that and will treat it
like that aswell. Therefore you can't write to files that are already
read-only, unless you're root.


<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Question 2.<BR>
	If I access any file from the FAT-WIN95 filesystem and make a change to
	it within Linux, when I boot in windows, that file is
	marked as "read only". Any idea why this is happening and how I can stop
	this from happening? 

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> I've never seen this happen on my system. I usually don't even use the
umask=000 setting (since i hardly access the win95 partition at all. If i have
to do it, i just do it as root). My only guess is that your root's umask
has the first digit set to 2. If you type 'umask' at your prompt you
should see '022'. But I don't think this is the case here. Check it
anyway just to be sure :)

<P> Perhaps this umask=000 setting answers your 2nd question. Again, since
it doesn't happen here I can't test it either i'm afraid.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Maybe the two are related. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> You're most welcome. Hope all goes well. If you have more questions,
feel free to ask ;)


<H4>From: Joachim Noffke &lt;<A HREF="mailto:Joachim.Noffke@t-online.de">Joachim.Noffke@t-online.de&gt;</A>:</H4>

<P> If your FAT partitions are mounted automatically at boot time, all files
on them will belong to root. To change the permissions for other users,
edit your /etc/fstab file: in the two lines corresponding to your FAT
partitions (the ones which contain "vfat" or "msdos" in the third
column), add the mount option "umask=0" to the fourth column. This
should solve at least problem #1.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> I have a problem with my new modem. I tried to install it under Red-Hat
	5.2 but it doesn't work. My modem is an internal
	Diamond Supra Express 56i V PRO and under W98 the default configuration
	is irq 12 an I/O port 0x3e8. Under W98 it works
	perfectly and i don't think this is a "winmodem"(isn't it?). Windows
	"says" that under DOS it must be configured with: COM 3,
	irq 4 and I/O port 0x3e8 (/dev/ttyS2 isn't it?) 
	
	I just want to know if this is a winModem or not and how can I install
	it. 

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> First we have to make sure wether it's a winmodem or not.

<P> How do you configure the modem? Do you need to change jumpers on the
modemcard itself to change IRQ's and the like? If so, then chances are
high that it is not a winmodem.

<P> Here's a second check.

<P> When you boot the computer, you get the BIOS tests output. It also
contains a list with comports it had found. If that lists the comport
of your modem, then you are sure that your modem is not a winmodem.

<P> I advise to put your modem on COM4 (IRQ3 I/O 2E8) since that works best
and in case you have a serial mouse it won't interfere with it (if you
have a serial mouse on COM1 and a modem on COM3, they both have the same
IRQ and that is a possible problem hazard). If you, however, have a PS/2
mouse, then you can safely leave it on com3.

<P> And yes, COM3 is /dev/ttyS2 under Linux.

<P> Have you tried minicom under Linux? It's a program similair to
Hyperterminal from Windows. You can use the program to send AT-commands
(modem commands) to a serial port and in that way you can determine if
the modem is responding or not.

<P> Good luck.

<P> Hi,

<P>         I recently came across this on the web.
        
<P> The ROCK Linux Homepage: <A HREF=http://linux.rock-projects.com/>
linux.rock-projects.com</A>

<P> ----- snip README ------        

<P> ROCK Linux is built by a few shell scripts. These scripts can download
all necessary sourcecode from the internet, compile the packages with
optimizations for your choice of processor, build the package files
and (optionally) create a CD-ROM image.

<P> ROCK Linux is a small distribution, but it's not a "mini distribution".
It comes with over 200 packages including X11 and the GNOME Desktop.

<P> ----- snip README ------        

<P>         These scripts is about 1.3MB in size.

<P> Your November column had some advice for a newbie struggling with an SiS
video assembly.  I offer the folowing:

<P> For S.u.S.E.
Go to their site http://www.suse.com/ for drivers.  I did this with
S.u.S.E. Linux 6.1.  The drivers work, but can be installed only with
S.u.S.E. SaX.  The other installation programs will not work.  The
XF86Config file written is NOT compatible with xf86config, but is
required to get SiS up.  My SiS 530 on-board setup is limited to 16-bit
color depth.  Windows on the same computer has 32-bit color depth.

<P> For Red Hat 6.0, Open Linux 2.0, and Slackware 3.6
There are drivers at http://www.sis.com.tw/.  There are also
instructions.  I have not tried them, so you are on your own.  Have fun.

	One part of my research is where I am analysing the business model of
	Linux (from Redhat) . However I fear by going to Redhat's website the
	information about it's product may be biased and I may not be able to
	get an all rounded opinion.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Get your basic info from RedHat, state your thesis on line (newsgroups?) and
ask people to refute it.  RedHat's pretty above-board, and most people don't
have too much argument about their policies.
