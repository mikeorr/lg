&gt; That's as may be, but I'm sure from a foreigner's perspective there
&gt; are behaviour traits and cultural idiosyncrasies common to all who
&gt; live in the USA, and possibly the whole of North America. Maybe some
&gt; of these are easier for us to spot than for you to identify.

Like anything, this is always the case.  Relatives one has not seen in
$SOME_TIME are always apt to quote:  &quot;Ooh, haven't you grown?&quot;, whilst
pulling your cheek gently.  Sigh.</p>

&gt; One big difference between the English and the Americans I've observed
&gt; is that whilst the English would hardly ever dream of starting up a
&gt; conversation with a complete stranger (or even someone you vaguely
&gt; know, come to that) at a bus stop or on a train, in the US by the time
&gt; you actually get on the bus or train the American standing next to
&gt; you has normally told you their entire life story. I exaggerate, of
</pre>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Hehe.  This is true, of course.   The English are much too reserved
about things, although this idiom is a little pass&eacute; now, given a slight
culture shift.  The older generation of people at bus stops (I refer to
OAPs -- Old Age Pensioners) are more likely to strike up a conversation,
presumably because they're curious what the youth of today are up to.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; course, but in general we find Americans much more open and willing
&gt; to share personal information than we are. In the book, Kate Fox
&gt; talks about the exceptions to the not-talking-to-stangers rule, e.g.,
&gt; to complain about the weather or to say, &quot;Typical!&quot; when you're on
&gt; a train which gets delayed owing to leaves on the track, etc. Of
</pre>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Those comments define common-ground, and hence gives the proverbial
olive-branch a chance to do its job.   Trains are a nightmare, anyway,
especially if one is on a long journey of, say, three hours or so.  What
I have typically found (being British, of course) is that for people on
train journeys, most of them actually <em>do</em> want to talk, but it's never
quite known how to approach the issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>See:</em> <a class="reference" href="#american-bus">American Bus</a></blockquote>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
That's the quintessential British stereotype: people wanting to talk
but they don't because they haven't been introduced.  I don't know how
much it's true.  I can't say I've noticed a difference between British
and Americans, but I don't talk to passing strangers a lot either.  I
do say &quot;Hi&quot; sometimes to people in the city, like some others do to
try to keep alive the small-town customs; that may be an American
thing.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
It depends.  In tightly-knit rural communities (such a farming
communities)  acknowledging one another is always done for this very
reason alone.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I did get chewed out twice by British toughs on the train.  Once on
the tube when I accidentally spit in a guy's direction.  <a class="reference" href="#sluggo1">&gt;&gt;</a></p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
That doesn't surprise me, most find such acts rude.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I understand he was upset.  I just didn't understand why he kept
harping on it after I said I'm sorry.  What did he expect me to do?  I
can't undo it.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Mike, it might be because the guy was a jerk. Not because he was <em>from</em>
somewhere, but because it's a personal characteristic.</p>
<p>This is one of the (damn near infinite number of) reasons I find &quot;oh,
those people from $OTHER_PLACE all behave like that&quot; annoying. Yeah,
there are common traits in groups, but assuming that someone's behavior
defines a group is just nuts. Assuming that someone's behaving a certain
way <em>because</em> they can be classed with some group isn't much better.
Even if the behavior that they're engaging in is supposed to be
representative of that group, assuming that they're doing it for that
reason can definitely lead you astray.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I'm not talking about his behavior, I'm talking about the cultural
assumptions behind it.  Clearly he had different expectations than I
would have, but I don't know what his were.  Assumptions do have some
relationship to $COUNTRY, even if behavior brings in on a lot of other
factors.  I respect the way he said what he means and piped up if
something bothered him.  I didn't mind he did it gruffly; he thought I
looked like a guy who wanted it direct, just like he would.  Fine with
me.</p>
<p id="sluggo1"><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
And once in
Dover when I met Didier and I was telling him the good and bad of
England, and some lad thought I was badmouthing the Brits.  Those may
be the only times somebody talked to me on a train.  Except when I
went from Bristol to Cardiff on the spur of the moment, and we went
into a tunnel.  I asked the man next to me, &quot;Was that a mountain?&quot;
and he said, &quot;No, that's the Severn.&quot;  I asked, &quot;What's the Severn?&quot;
He said, &quot;The river that divides England and Wales.&quot;  Oh.  I felt so
stupid.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Heh.   I can't help but chuckle at that.  Note that it's not your
question about what the Severn is, but more that you asked if what you
had passed was a mountain.  :)  We don't have anything close in Britain
to a proper mountain -- the only places you are going to lay claim to
any prominent ones is &quot;Ooop North&quot; in The Lake District, and Scawtland
(sic).</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
The only time I've seen <a class="reference" href="#tunnels">tunnels</a> is when they plow through mountains,
of which there are a lot here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
One of the things I really enjoyed about the PNW, by the way. I just
<em>loved</em> spending time in those mountains, hiking and fishing and skiing
and hunting. I miss it; there's nothing quite like that on the East
Coast, where the mountains are really <em>old</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>See:</em> <a class="reference" href="#mountains">Mountains</a></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
It's a shame you took the Train to Cardiff -- had you driven (I realise
why this was not a possibility) you would have had to go over the Severn
Bridge to reach Wales.   A very high bridge at that, but you get a nice
view from it.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
High bridges are nice.  There's a cool one in Toronto if you ever get to see it.</p>

Danforth Bridge</p>
<p>The picture doesn't show the most spectacular part, where you've been
underground for half an hour and think there's nothing below you, then
suddenly you emerge in a wooded hillside with a river far below.  The
river must be in a canyon or fjord or something.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
One has a few
possibilities open to them, such as the weather, but that's considered
so clich&eacute;d, as to be ignored by most people.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; course, as soon as the train starts moving again, we all hide behind
&gt; our newspapers and conversation with strangers ceases. And, just
&gt; because you said &quot;Typical!&quot; yesterday to a person you see on the
&gt; train every morning that doesn't give you a free licence to start up
&gt; a conversation the next day. After a couple of years, it might be
&gt; acceptable to nod and mutter, &quot;Good morning,&quot; but nothing more.

That depends how deeply-rooted these people are.  Surrey is quite a

<div class="section" id="american-bus-1">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9" name="american-bus">American Bus</a></h2>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
One American experience is taking a bus across the country, which
takes three days.  It was more common by train in the '40s, back when
trains were faster and more frequent.  I've done it three times now,
to New York or Pennsylvania, and am going again next month.  Not that
I'm excited to but planes are so expensive now, you have to choose
your itinerary a month in advance, you're packed in like sardines,
etc.  So it's a good time to talk to people and see who you meet, and
sometimes you make some interesting friends.  Not unlike the
Trans-Siberian, I guess.  There's a difference in class between the
bus and train: train riders tend to be better off and taking leisurly
vacations.  Bus riders either (1) just want to get from point A to B,
(2) want go where there are no trains or the schedule is better, or
(3) can't afford anything else.  A surprising number of truckers ride
the bus from their home in one state to their job in another.    The
bus runs 24 hours straight, with drivers changing every 10 hours.</p>
<p><strong>[Heather]</strong> 
I've never ridden a bus long-haul, but my sis says they're more timely than
the trains, who often pull to sidings to let the fright lines (who really
own the track and/or are worth all the real money on it) through.  The
busses only pull in for meals, and some not for that if they've a concession
aboard.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
A bus with meals aboard?  I've never seen such a thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Heather]</strong>
It was claimed, for the same value as airlines have meals; in other words, 
don't bother. Bring your own beef jerky, it will be cheaper, and at one
point in history it was a steak.</blockquote>
<p>It's the
trains that have meals aboard.  The buses stop three times a day at
McDonald's or Joe's Forgotten Rural Restaurant, plus they stop every
few hours at truck stops or gas stations for smoke breaks, restrooms,
and snacks.  In California there's a resort which I thought would
would be a very special break, but it turns out the Coalinga Junction
Resort is a euphamism for a bunch of fast-food restaurants surrounding
a parking lot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Heather]</strong>
Heh.  At least the Truckstops of America (TA) also have a general store, and
if you happen to be a long-haul trucker, they have showers available.  (If
not, then they don't - that's a membership privelege).</p>
<p>Coalinga &quot;resort&quot; my fanny.  Hold out for Harris Ranch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least they didn't call it an &quot;oasis&quot;.  Back east an
oasis is what we call a rest stop,, except our rest stops are wooded
places consisting of restrooms and picnic tables <a class="footnote-reference" href="#picnic" id="id2" name="id2">[4]</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Heather]</strong>
Some of our rest stops have picnic support, and one or two even have vending 
machines.</blockquote>
<p>and the oases
consist mainly of a restaurant, a restaurant accessible only from the
freeway.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Heather]</strong>
Interesting, I haven't yet encountered a restaurant that wasn't also
accessible to the locals.</blockquote>
<p>There, Thomas, how Americana is that?  Shall I send you a
Happy Meal souvenir?</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Heather]</strong>
[Buses more efficient, film &#64; 11]</blockquote>
<p>Buses are definitely faster than trains on the long-distance routes,
even though they're vulnerable to rush-hour traffic.  The tracks
haven't been upgraded since the 1800s so they poke along at a
leisurely 40 MPH, plus freight trains are slower than passenger trains
anyway which is why you have to wait for freight train to pass.  In
the northwest at least there are areas with one track for both
directions, so you also have to wait for oncoming trains.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Heather]</strong>
bleh.</blockquote>
<p>On regional routes that have both buses and trains (Seattle-Vancouver
BC), it's a tossup which one is more likely to break down along the
way.  Plus you never know when the bus will get stuck for 1 1/2 hours</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Heather]</strong>
Also bleh.</blockquote>
<p>at the border, whereas for trains the immigration is done both ways in
Vancouver, and the southbound customs agents do their work on the
train.</p>
<p>Another thing is, because most trains go once a day, they fill up a
month in advance.  So if you want to go at the last minute you have to
take a bus.</p>
<p>The first time I went down the coast by myself in 1987, I was supposed
to take a train from SF to LA, and then transfer to Oceanside (San
Diego) to see my relatives.  But I missed the train, so because it was
1987 and you could get a last-minute flight for $100, I flew to LA.
Then when I got to the train station, I found the train from SF was
late so I hadn't missed it after all!  Going back, I stopped in
Vancovuer, Washington (the other Vancouver) to visit a college
roommate, and on the way home the train was late <em>again</em> by 8 hours.
Sadly, this is common, which is why even avid train riders don't ride
the trains.</p>
<p>I remember arriving at Los Angeles airport and coming out to where the
shuttle vans stop, and I had to sit down for ten minutes because I was
overwhelmed at how big the airport was.  I was 21 and had never been
to a city that big before.</p>

Re top posting: this is becoming a culture clash between old school
Internet users and, er, what we used to call AOL Weenies.  My friend

At work people sometimes top-post and sometimes bottom-post, and
sometimes it's both in the same message.  I follow the original style

<p>I tried
to explain the difference between the traditional email culture (text
is king) and the multimedia email culture, and that some people and
mailing lists object very strenuously to top posting.  I told him
there may be some settings in yahoo mail or his browser to change it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Heather]</strong> 
Shortest form:  it can read like a snippy comment at the top, or it can read
like a conversation scattered amid the other comments.  The two ways each
have their benefits, but they're not very compatible;  comments at the top
lose the reference of what they were comments <em>to</em>.   Contrariwise, comments 
in the middle leave all these long rambly parts <a class="footnote-reference" href="#rambly" id="id3" name="id3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>but of course that's not his responsibility, it's mine.  I told him I
have no idea how my messages look in yahoo mail but it's prob'ly
different than another program, and I have no control over it.  I
looked at his raw message and saw it's text+HTML; I told him that and
that it uses more than twice the bandwidth for the same content, but
he still didn't grasp the &quot;HTML&quot; part.  So I guess we just have to get
with the program.  (Irony alert.)</p>

Hmmm?  I've been to the Bay Area.  There are mountains and bridges and

that.  An unfortunate thing, that.  One of the most spectacular views
in the world  and you can't see it.  Should've put BART on the Bay

there under the bay for some reason.  So loud that I wonder why more
people haven't complained.  Did the engineers, er, not think about
this?</p>

ah, but the Transbay Tube is actually one of the marvels of modern

</blockquote>
<p>Anyhow, the afternoon of October 17, 1989, I was at a network consulting
job in Berkeley, California, having driven over San Francisco Bay from
my house in western San Francisco.   My Israeli-born then-fiancee was at
home.  At 5:04 p.m., the quake started, and I rolled my office chair
around cooly shutting down equipment, after looking up and (I <em>thought</em>)
making sure I wasn't in an unreinforced-masonry building.  After the
shaking (15 seconds of 7.1 on the modified Richter scale), I made sure
everything seemed OK, then gathered up others in the building and went
outside.  (<em>Then</em>, I noticed that the building really <em>was</em> apparently
made from unreinforced brick, which like stone tends to crumble in
quakes.  Fortunately, it was only one storey, and nothing collapsed.)</p>
<p>We looked around a bit, then I went inside and telephoned home just long
enough the each of us could be assured the other was OK.  Checking the
radio over the next hour or two, I determined that the S.F. Bay Bridge
would be unpassable for the near future <a class="footnote-reference" href="#loma" id="id4" name="id4">[1]</a>, but other bridges would
probably reopen after inspection.  Eventually, I got home the long way, 
about 80 km, via bridge to San Rafael in Marin County and then over the
Golden Gate Bridge -- listening to radio chatter about the Marina
District fire, collapsed stone and brick buildings, etc.</p>
<p>...and so, I walked into my house about 10 PM, and found my fiancee
still cleaning up broken pottery, but in a state of barely contained
state of panic.  She wanted to leave not just San Francisco, but 
<em>the country</em> -- and have both of us go &quot;home&quot; to Kiryat Shemona,
Israel, target of PLO rockets from Lebanon every couple of days.</p>
<p>Me?  My typical-Californian take on the situation was that we should go
down to the Marina District supermarket, and buy some Shake and Bake for
dinner.  ;-&gt;</p>
<p>(Note for those outside North America:  &quot;Shake and Bake&quot; is a gimmick
food product from the 1970s: a spice/breading coating mix and a
cookproof bag.  You put chicken in the bag, seal, shake the mix, and
bake.)</p>
<p>Anyhow, for what it's worth, although rare major earthquakes can do
severe damage to some vulnerable parts of California's infrastructure,
and thus its economy, unless you're unlucky enough to have something
fall on you that's in violation of Building Code standards, you are very
unlikely to get hurt.  (63 died from the 1989 quake out of a population
of eight million.  Substantively all of those were victims of
substandard construction.)</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13" name="earthquakes">Earthquakes</a></h2>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
My friend says that after the 1906 quake, strict building codes were
passed to ensure the rebuilt buildings would be quakeproof.  But the
developers howled about the expense and eventually got the regulations
repealed.  So for fifty years all those Victorian houses were built
without reinforcement until modern codes were finally passed.  There
are thousands of these buildings, so theey're predicting tens of
thousands of casualties when the next big quake strikes within the
city.  (The 1989 quake centered in a less populated area 70 miles
south.)  At least that's what he says.</p>
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
That's true <a class="footnote-reference" href="#true" id="id5" name="id5">[2]</a> -- but I'd guess that just about all of the Victorians
have had modern, painstaking rebuilds by now, since doing so has been a
major Yuppie fad for the past forty years.  In any event, more to the
point, two-story woodframe buildings like the Victorians really were
never the problem in the first place:  That's an inherently strong
design, generally.</p>
<p>The California building code only <em>really</em> got tough starting 1979 (with
some stronger and more aggressive municipal codes surpassing it), and
that has indeed (finally) included mandatory retrofitting of old
buidings, with legally mandated deadlines (the retrofit requirement
being <em>ordinarily</em> triggered only by any remodel of the building, which
means compliance isn't universal yet, but is getting there).</p>
<p>In any event, people frequently overinterpret the term &quot;epicentre&quot;, 
which is merely the point of origin of the various wavefronts (or,
technically, the surface location above that point).  Actual shaking
is often considerably greater many tens of miles distant, because 
of either soil topology effects (e.g., Santa Rosa in 1906) or because
the different propagation rates of the P, S, and Rayleigh waves make
the shaking last longer, further from the epicentre.</p>
<p>The 1906 earthquake (estimated at 7.8 magnitude) shook a 300-mile
stretch along the fault, with strong shakings about 100 miles laterally,
and duration in <em>some</em> places (e.g., Santa Rosa) for more than 60
seconds, but less long close to the epicentre, just south of S.F.</p>
<p>Probably he worst 1989 local damage was in Watsonville, ~20 miles from
the epicentre, but Marina District (San Francisco) damage was almost 
as bad, because the neighbourhood was constructed atop a soggy marsh
that had been filled in   {pause for irony}   in 1914-15 with sand, mud,
and debris from the 1906 earthquake and fire, which landfill soil
partially liquified in the 1989 shaking.  (By contrast, neighbouring
Fort Mason, built on bedrock, wasn't damaged in any way.)</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Breen]</strong>
The real irony about the Marina damage is that the landfill happened
originally for ... the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition, which celebrated
San Francisco's rebirth after the 1906 quake.</blockquote>
<p><em>That</em> was fully anticipatable back in 1914-15, and the story I've heard
is that the Marina District lands were initially zoned as <em>pasture</em> land
only, because they were known to be unsafe in earthquakes, but that
later land speculators were a little too... persuasive.</p>

<p><strong>[howarddy3]</strong>
I have to say that my experiences were rather different in the 80's.   
Perhaps the folks i came across were more open to international travelers.</p>
<p>I recognized that total strangers were very much off limits, but people did 
offer info and advice where needed and sometime did start conversations.   
And this was both in Surrey and in the Geordi country North.</p>
<p>I remember working at the Queen's Hall in Edinburgh during the summer festival 
and my English manager -- a female -- took me out for a drink.     But maybe 
being an Englishwomen in Scotland facilitated that act.</p>
<p>The one thing i do remember was that the English folks seemed more polite and 
harder to reach than the Scots, who were more reserved around strangers but 
much warmer when they knew someone.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
The Scots are a great people -- they're very warm in my experience, and
much like the Irish, have a great sense of humour (c.f. Billy Connely).
If you're ever in Edinburgh during Hogmanny, you'll soon realise what
generosity means (I have never been, but I hear it's quite good).</p>

<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
Having been in both cities (and I realise I'm stepping right into the
middle of an epic municipal rivalry), my wife and I found the residents
of Glasgow even more winning.  Unlike the Edinburghers, they're modest
about their lovely city.  ('But why on earth would you come here on
holiday?')</p>
<p>I did have a few problems with the thick-as-butter accent,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Heh.  The accent is part of the appeal with me.  (It's second only to
the Welsh accent, which, on some women is very appealing).  Depending on
which part of Scawtland (sic) you go to, you'll get completely different
dialects and accents.  The coarse and often thick Glasweigan accent is
nothing if you go to West Scotland, where it's often very warbly.  You
also need a phrase book in some parts.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, is it true that certain films -- I think it might have
been Trainspotting -- had subtitles in the American release for the
Scots dialect?)</p>
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
I did see Trainspotting (on videotape, I think), and I don't remember
there being subtitles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the 'Mad Max' series were all dubbed for
American/Canadian release.  There are now 'Special Edition' DVD sets 
in which one of the language options is 'Original Australian Dialogue'
-- which made me laugh, when I heard about that.</p>

<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Hehe.  That does not surprise me.  I always go fishing when I can,

I taught Kat the basics, and she's taken

caught most of the fish as well as the largest one. We had a couple of
groupers and several snappers, which cooked up very, very nicely with
julienned ginger, green onions, and toasted sesame oil. Yum!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Kat]</strong>
Actually, the juliened ginger/green onion/toasted sesame oil was for the
saltwater catfish we caught during one of Heather's recent phone calls.</p>
<p>What I did with the groupser and snappers was just plain safflower oil
heated hot and then 5 mm slices of fresh garlic fried in that until
golden. Add a bit of kosher salt at the end, and we get a sauce that Ben
will happily eat as if it were a vegetable side dish!</p>

Actually, now that I've looked it up, I was mistaken: I thought that

I'm still
beaming from the fact that I have <em>finally</em> been able to get hold of
whitebait.  You wouldn't believe how difficult that was for me.  It's
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
The question is, did you eat them or use them as bait?</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
The whitebait?  Good grief, Ben, I ate them.  :)  They're farrrr too
good to waste on other fish.   That was my delicacy.  Yummy.  I coated
them in a light, runny flour glaze and deep-fried them, and ate them
whole with brown bread and lemon juice.  Mmmmmm.  I don't know how old
they were, but they were &quot;fresh&quot; by most people's definition of that
word.   I bet they're even nicer freshly caught.   I imagine sprats to
be much the same as whitebait?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
I'm not sure; I've only heard of whitebait, and don't have a very clear
picture. There is indeed a school of thought that favors using bait that
you can eat in case you have no luck; fresh shrimp, whitebait, shiners,
etc. are definitely all good arguments for it. I've certainly looked at
a bucket of jumping shrimp and said &quot;the hell with fishing, boil some
water!&quot;</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Ha!  Even you have a weak spot, eh?  I must admit, shrimp is too good to
pass up.   Some fish have too exotic tastes to waste on them.  :)</p>

<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
(By the way, if you've never had <em>really</em> fresh, less-than-an-hour out
of the water fish, the difference is like that between night and day.
Most of the 'fishy' taste that many people dislike is products of
decomposition - they're right to dislike it.)</p>

[Nod].  I have heard this mentioned, but have never had the fortune of
eating extremely fresh fish like that.  I bet it's nice though.  Sigh.

equipment to do so.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
We'd also caught a number of toadfish, <em>Opsanus Tau</em>, but shook them off
our hooks very carefully - they're <em>so</em> ugly that it makes a very
efficient defense mechanism against fishermen. :) Besides, there's a lot
of argument about whether they're edible at all - and as much as the two

<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Aww.  They look like <em>lovely</em> fish.  :/  Out of interest, what type of
bait/line/weight(s) were you using at the time?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
We were using dead shrimp, with a 3-oz. egg weight rigged as a
&quot;fish-finder&quot; rig (i.e., it was a sliding weight on a 20-lb. test line
above a snap swivel, and a foot-long leader with a #4 hook is attached
to the snap.)</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
OK.  I think I understand that (i.e. can picture it in my head).  What
reel were you using?  Currently I've only had experience with
fixed-spool reels.  Some fisherman hate them in preference of multiplier
reels.  I've used both, and didn't get on with the multiplier reel at
all.  I probably just need to persevere with it more.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Baitcasters - what I suppose you're calling a multiplier reel - are a
pretty specialized tool; that's what long-distance casters use to throw
a 100-gram weight more than 300 yards (might be useful in shore fishing,
don't you think? :)</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
My step-dad has a lot of luck with his multiplier reel.</blockquote>
<p>They also takes a good bit of expertise to use
without tangling - it takes what they call &quot;an educated thumb&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Then we are talking about the same thing.  I have a slight operational
issue in that I am all fingers-and-thumbs in doing even basic things
like casting with such a reel.  My step-dad is getting better at it, and
as you say, the key to the entire thing is using one's thumb in
controlling the line.</blockquote>
<p>to
feather that spool properly. They also allow you to work in a large fish
against strong resistance. Spinning reels, however, can cast a
reasonably long way - on the order of a hundred and fifty yards - and are
relatively inexpensive.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
This sounds like my reel.  :)  150 yards you say?  Hmm....</blockquote>
<p>I like baitcasters for saltwater fishing, because - as the name says - I
can lob out a delicate live bait a long distance without tearing it off
the hook. I also prefer them for freshwater largemouth bass fishing,
because I can repeatedly drop a lure within a 6&quot; circle at, say, a
hundred foot distance (i.e., present it exactly where I think the fish
is) - but it's taken me a lot of practice to do that. For light-line
fishing (e.g., trout) or when I'm teaching someone new to fish, I
wouldn't use anything other than a spinning reel, though.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
:)  Then it seems that I am being taught well so far, since this is more
or less the way I have been progressing.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
For a while, as the current was dying down, 3 oz. wasn't
enough to hold the bottom - it all kept getting swept downstream - but
once it slowed down a bit, the fish started biting like there was no
tomorrow. Next time, I'll bring some pyramid weights so that it'll all
hold better.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>

<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I remember you mentioning once, about two years ago that you were going to 
Chesapeakebay (spelling?) Bay.  I hear that's very good for fishing,

<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Yep, them young whipper-snapper mountains sure are different.  You
take one look at them and know they're young and rambunctious.  Not.
It's just one tectonic plate sliding under another, which pushes the
other up and produces the mountains.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Not true, in fact; there are a number of processes by which mountains
build. As well, mountains age after the tectonic activity ends. Old
mountains are low and rounded; more recent ones are high and jagged. The
Blue Ridge mountains, for example, are over a billion years old; the
Appalachians are about 480 million years old; the Smokies are somewhere
in the 450 million year range. Your Cascades, on the other hand, are
pretty much the most geologically young and tectonically active in North
America - as you well know, they're still building.</blockquote>
<p>I'm going camping in a couple
weeks, somewhere in the Cascades.  Maybe just Mt Si, which is one of
the foothills.  Haven't gone hiking for twelve years, when my
summer-school Russian class went up to Fourth of July Pass for the
weekend with an outdoor-enthusiast prof.  It's interesting how the
vegetation is all lush at the bottom, then the groundbrush disappears
and it's just pine/hemlock/cedar/douglas fir trees and moss and dirt,
then the trees get thinner and thinner till they're several feet
apart.  I've only been to 5000', which is a third up Mt Rainer.  The
peaks are snow-covered year round, but they predict with climate
change that won't always be the case.</p>
<p>After the Cascades if you go east, it's light brown desert and a
totally different world.  Then in another hundred miles you start
getting rain and snow again and hit Spokane.  Then the mountains start
again and Coeur d'Alene Lake goes on for miles; a definite must-see.
Then you're deep in the Bitterroot Mountains, which are like the
Cascades but I'd say steeper and bigger (though not as high) with
similar-looking trees.  Then around Missoula it's flat, then the
Rockies are less forested if I remember, but it's sometimes snowy in
Butte near the top.  Then it's all flat for 500 miles with cattle
ranches and cornfields/wheat fields and oil pumps till Minneapolis,
where you get lakes again and it feels a lot like Seattle.</p>
<p>They've cancelled the Greyhound bus between Billings and Minneapolis,
so you have to take a string of regional buses instead (once a day).
For some reason it's not profitable for a big company to do but it
<em>is</em> profitable for a small company, however that works.  So I'll
prob'ly go south through Boise and Denver instead, since I've never
been that way.  Interesting that because Chicago is so far south, it's
only four hours' difference to get there either way.</p>
<p>People say the east coast has no mountains like ours, but I feel at
home in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania.  NY just feels
familiar, and Pennsylvania was quite surprising.  I thought the whole
east coast was wall-to-wall city, but here's this big mountainous
forest in the middle of Pennsylvania, and suddenly at the top is Penn
State University in the middle of nowhere.  I'm not sure whether it's
the Appalacians or Alleghanies, but they definitely feel like normal
mountains, don't let anybody fool you.  There are three tunnels along
the turnpike going through the bases of mountains, with delightful
names like Blue Mountain.  That's what I assumed it was when we went
under the Severn.  (In the northwest there aren't many tunnels.  The
roads meander and find flat spaces between the mountains, usually
following the Indian trails.)</p>
<p>Another interesting place is -- surprise, surprise -- Los Angeles.  My
second time there was to a Python conference in Long Beach around
2001.  The bus got diverted off I-5 due to a windstorm and came
through Paso Robles on the coast (something like a 4-hour delay).  We
reached Ventura and I thought it would be suburban hell to downtown,
but suddenly civilization stopped and we spent a whole hour going past
this lonely mountain, then suddenly there was city again and then
another mountain, and then finally downtown.  How can a metropolitan
area have entire mountains inside it?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
[laugh] That part of California poses some interesting challenges to
people trying to build on those mountains. The top surface is highly
friable, so houses tend to slide downhill whenever the whim takes them -
and good anchoring techniques are still extremely expensive and not
necessarily guaranteed. Ever hear of Malibu?</p>

Highly recommended reading:  <em>The Control of Nature</em> by John McPhee.
It's a trio of essays about places on Earth where humanity is
unavoidably in conflict with natural forces.  The entire book is a
(quiet, oddly understated) tour de force, in my view, but the
concluding essay, &quot;Los Angeles against the Mountains&quot;, just knocked my
socks off:  You'll understand the full picture of what's going on with
SoCal wildfires, construction, and landslides -- and boggle.</p>
<p>That may seem like an oddly worded endorsement, but there's just
something... compelling about McPhee's prose style when he talks about
scientific topics:  Without apparent rhetoric, but with wit and
precision, he piles on descriptive details and anecdotes, and manages
along the way to give you a sweeping big-picture understanding of each
of the problematic living situations described in the three essays
(Iceland's most economically important harbour town, the lower
Mississippi River, and the Los Angeles basin), and you find yourself
saying &quot;Holy moley!  These people are <em>nuts</em>!  How can they <em>live</em>
there?&quot;</p>

Switch baits. Mackerel will go for almost anything - I've caught them on
chewing gum and cigarette butts (that was just to prove that it could be
done; actually, one of the best baits for them is a strip of mackerel) -
but have a small mouth, so they can't take too big of a bait.  Sea bass
are a bit more picky about what they eat, and will take a fish up to a
quarter (!) their own size - and I've always found live bait to be the
best for them.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Thanks for the tip.  From what I have read/been told, sea bass can be
either very easy or very difficult to catch.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>See:</em> <a class="reference" href="#wreck-fishing">Wreck fishing</a></blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
The former, usually. :) In the case of saltwater fish, the trick usually
comes down to being where they are, with the right bait (well, OK, the
state of the tide matters somewhat too.)</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I'm glad you said that about the tide.  I get varying opinions and
suggestions about when to fish at all, much less catch things like bass.
The general consensus for the beach I frequent is to fish when the tide
is on the way <em>in</em> -- and it can be very forceful thanks to the swell
produced from a triangulation from the Isle of Wight and Portland (the
former being an island, and the latter a peninsula).  As I say, whether
or not I need a high tide, I don't know.   The would seem to be the
general opinion round these parts.  :)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Interesting. For me, the default tide to fish, if I don't know an area
well, is the outgoing high tide: that's when all the little baitfish and
the crustaceans that hide out in the shallows get washed out to deeper
water, where the hungry fish are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Heh.  It seems the inverse is what I am told, at least for Westbay.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
It may well be. It depends on a number of factors - the direction of the
current during a tide, how that current gets vectored based on the
shape of the land, the bottom structure, etc.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
It might be total bollocks for all I know, but the logic for fishing the
incoming tide is that the fish are following the bait in.  Mind you, I
don't know whether anyone seems to care about the tide for shore
fishing.   Whenever I have gone down there, there's always someone
trying desperately to catch something.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Heh. Well, it's not an all-or-nothing game, but then success in fishing
depends on a number of factors. Fishing the tide, and studying how the
state of it relates to what happens, is one of the largest factors.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
My parents went down there after a storm, the tide being very high and
forceful still, but was on the way out (not that it was that obvious to
tell).  The shoreline was littered with pouting and whitebait wriggling
about.  I wish I had been there then!</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Yep - storms will strand fish at times. This also tells me that there's
relatively deep water (not a huge shallow littoral zone, such as we have
here in Florida) very close to shore where you are. Fish would usually
run for deep water, away from the shore, during bad weather like that -
and for them to get stranded, they must have been relatively deep
already, and the entire water column got flipped (which happens when
storm waves get fully developed, even in water up to 60-70 feet deep.)
&quot;Shoal&quot; is a relative term. :)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
I try to figure out where the
dropoff is - i.e., the break between the shallow littoral zone and the
deeper water - and cast just over the edge of it, where the fish
concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Oh, that's brilliant!  I often wondered if I ought to be doing that --
the dropoff point is relatively close to the shoreline anyway, so it
makes throwing the line out there easier for sure.  What I have been
doing in the past (when using frozen squid as bait <a class="footnote-reference" href="#ragworm" id="id6" name="id6">[6]</a>) is to just
gently lift it up and down occasionally since it can often get
obscured/caked in grit.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Use a dropper rig, instead.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
                 Swivel
    Main line    or knot   18&quot;-24&quot; leader Weight

</pre>
<p>This way, your bait will stay off the bottom when your line is tight.
Also, don't use line that's too heavy or hooks that are too big: that's
probably the biggest mistake that people make. 20-lb. test - and even
that is mostly for abrasion resistance - and #4 hooks are just about as
large as you'd need for fish up to, say, 10 lbs. on the average (and
will, of course, hold much larger ones; just make sure that your drag is
set to release well below line strength.)</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I'm pleased I got that right at least, I
wasn't sure if there would be any fish there, since because the current
is so strong at times it can be hard to make sure the line doesn't get
dragged out all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
That's the challenge, all right. Use either pyramid weights or - well,
I'm not sure what they're called, but they're a sort of a little
triangular lead frame with cleats facing up and down at the corners.
Those are both really good for holding bottom in strong currents.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
If there's any structure at that dropoff line - rocks,
wrecks, deeper holes, anything that breaks up the standard contours -
that would be the spot marked &quot;bullseye&quot;. :) Cast to the deep-water side
of it if you can; fish, like electricity, always take the path of least
resistance, and they're going to be wherever gravity and the current are
going to drop the bait right into their mouths.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Would that also include areas close to man-made structures such as piers
and rip-raff (huge boulders that have been plonked into the sea)?  That
seems to be a very popular place for fisherman.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Absolutely. Hunting works on the same principle: there's nothing in the
middle of an open plain, but if there's a dip, or the edge of a forest,
or the base of a hill - anything to break up the regular features -
there's the possibility of both hunting for food _and_ for running and
hiding. That's where it all happens.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
/me has a little book, and writes this all down.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Is there some advantage to going fishing after a storm (or perhaps in
your case a hurricane)?  I can well imagine there is, as it might stir
or confuse the fish to place they might not otherwise be.  :)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Actually, that's not a good time to fish at all. The fish are somewhat
spooked (unless you're talking about <em>really</em> deep water, which doesn't
get disturbed) and the bottom silt is all stirred up, making the bait
hard to see. On the other hand, right after a rain, fishing any deep
holes you know of in shallow areas is a good idea: the concentration of
salt in those remains fairly constant, while the surface is now a bit
less salty - and the fish are going to move to places where their
&quot;normal&quot; environment obtains.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
With (some - well, many)
freshwater fish, the _first_ requirement is to be born under a caul...
and the next 52,783 required factors get progressively less controllable
and usually involve the intervention of a witch doctor, a 12-long
poisonous snake, and a 2-horsepower 1967-model Waring blender with the
&quot;disintegrate&quot; option.  Most people just rely on luck, instead - which
is why it's called &quot;fishing&quot; instead of &quot;catching&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Hehehe.   Freshwater fishing is not something I have done yet; to do so
requires a license, and I can't justify paying out for one when I only
fish on an ad-hoc basis.  If I ever do go, I want to try and catch a
Barbel; those things look very funny.  :)</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19" name="wreck-fishing">Wreck fishing</a></h2>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I quite often (when I am
at my mum's place) watch fishing programs, and one of them was dedicated
to wreck fishing for sea bass.  Looked wayyyy out of my league, and I am
told wreck fishing is the creme de la creme of fishing anyway.  Hehe.
:)  In West Bay, near to where my parents are, people quite often catch
bass.  I just need to go down there at the right time.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>See:</em> <a class="reference" href="#cod-fishing">Cod fishing</a></blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Heck, no. Wreck fishing is easy: pretty much everything is done for you
(the &quot;being in the right place with the right bait at the right time&quot;
part, anyway.) All you need to have is a high-leverage rod and reel
(short rod, <em>BIG</em> baitcasting reel like a Penn Senator) and the ability
to use them as a pry-bar to get that big bugger out of his hidey-hole.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
That's it?  Yeesh, and here I am naive enough to think that I need at
least 15 years behind me winning Fisherman of the Year awards to be
eligible enough to do so.  Well in that case, I will look into it, as
there's some wrecks around 'ere somewhere.</blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Stuff like wreck-fishing, chasing marlin and swordfish, or catching big
tuna all looks glamorous - generally because there's a lot of money
involved, and that means professional film crews to make it look
hyper-exciting. Mostly, it's a highly-focused system for putting people
on the fish, whatever it takes - which is why all of the above are
strongly favored by people with little time, lots of money, and a need
to show off big fish.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Well sod that.   I only do fishing because I <em>like</em> it, not because I
want to land some X^Y-sized tuna fish.  I don't care if I catch pouting
all day.  :)  They're still fish.</blockquote>
<p>I've hooked 400+ lb. swordfish off my boat, pulled up 70-lb. wahoo,
wrestled up huge grouper off the bottom - in one case, only to have
everything but the head removed by a shark just as I got him to the
surface -</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Good God!  I bet that was exhilarating.  :)  Wow.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
[laugh] It was annoying as hell, lemme tell you. I was already
anticipating grilled grouper, which is very tasty indeed... at least we
got the cheeks, which were only about a pound or so but are one of the
most tender and tasty parts.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Heh.  Well, it saved the shark having to go hunting, hehehe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>those are all heart-pounding moments, sometimes requiring lots
of muscle (or patience; either will do, as proven by a woman who pulled
in a 400-lb. marlin on <em>8-lb. test line</em> in Hawaii.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Did she take a photo?  :)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
I suspect she did, since it was a record. :) I can't find a pic of it,

<p>Most of that,
though, comes down to the factors I've mentioned: right place, right

and it'll get you exactly nowhere. :)</p>

My step-dad, much to his disgust is finding this out.  :)  Although

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20" name="cod-fishing">Cod fishing</a></h2>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
In the local tackle shop, there's a few photographs of some damn fine
fish.  One of them (I forget the name of the species -- very similar to
a Sea Bass) was caught in high tide fishing over the side of some
railings on a near-by beach.  This fish was enormous.  :)  They're the
sort of one-time-only catches though, and usually only the sort one
might find boat fishing.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Cod, perhaps? I've taken a quick look at what's available in your area,
and that seems to fit the description.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Ah.  Not cod -- related to it, looks like cod, but has a different name.
If you said it, I'd know it, I just can't remember what it is.  I
thought it began with 'P', but I could be wrong.  (Either way, these
fish are huge -- well, big by my standards...)</blockquote>
<p>I just love cold-water cod;
that's one of the best-tasting fish out there. In fact, as far as I'm
concerned, you're in the &quot;really tasty fish&quot; part of the world:
warm-water fish tend to be sorta mushy, while cold-water fish - tuna,
cod, flounder, sole - are just as fine as it gets.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Cod is becoming a &quot;no-catch&quot; fish due to concerns over its safety.  For
my birthday in April, I had fresh Lemon Sole, which was absolutely
divine.   I assume that to be fresh as in &quot;caught on the day&quot; -- it
tasted better than any other supposed fresh fish I have eaten.  Bony
chap though -- but then I assume most flat fish are.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Not at all. It takes a bit more skill (and a very sharp, thin, flexible
knife) to fillet them, but there should be almost no bones in a flatfish
fillet. Their skeletal structure is very flat and regular, so their
bones are even less likely to get clipped (and thus included in the
fillet) than other fish. Or did you have it whole?</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
You guessed it, it had its fins wiped, and was slapped on the plate for
me to eat.  My mother said something like:  &quot;Oooh, my.   It still has
its head!&quot;.  I just smiled.  :D  I don't think she realised what it was
I had ordered.   When I say it was bony, I meant I found it very very
fiddly to eat the fish from the bone in some parts of it, even after
removing the skeleton, there's so many tiny bones.</p>
<p>I could, most likely, live off fish and be a very happy man indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
I don't really know anything about catching pouting - actually, a quick
Net search says that pouting is a &quot;pest fish&quot; (i.e., not worth eating)
but make great bait for sea bass [laugh].</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Hehe.  Yes, they're a pest fish.  Pretty though.  I just like fish.  :)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Heh. Me too. I think I'll send you some pictures when we catch some
next time.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Oooh, I'd like that.  :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorta proves my point, and
would eliminate the chance of catching another one of them. You'd get
fewer fish, but better quality ones.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I probably ought to get myself on a boat next time, but I need more
practise just shore-fishing.  I really enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Shore fishing <em>is</em> a lot of fun.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Yes, it is.  :)  I still need to practise my casting a little more,
since I seem to either cast an &quot;OK&quot; distance out from the shore, or it
lands about ten feet in front of me.  :)  It's harder than it looks, and
I probably just need to keep at it.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Good advice from a pro:</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://saltfishing.about.com/cs/surffishing/a/aa040110a.htm">http://saltfishing.about.com/cs/surffishing/a/aa040110a.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Oooh.  Bookmarked, ta.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I must admit I am &quot;hooked&quot; (no pun
there) on fishing -- I absolutely love it.  I do understand how some
find it boring though.)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Boat-fishing is more about catching
fish, with not much enjoyment (other than actually working the fish in)
involved.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
That makes sense.  I have been boat fishing a few times just to see what
it's like.  We were mackerel fishing in both cases just outside of
Lulworth Cove.  All we did was plonk the fishing lines over the side,
and sailed out.  Then after a while there we had lots of mackerel.  :)
Easy, and a tiny bit dull since there was no process to it.</p>
<p>Mind you, if you're boat fishing, does that not also give you some
degree of flexibility as to the type of fish you can choose from?  For
example, if you're near a reef, and know of fishes XYZ that live in such
habitats, and you have a certain bait, that you'd then also be able to
catch a certain fish?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Yep. Bait, location, and knowledge of specific fishes habits and habitat
is what gets you onto a given type of fish. For example, this weekend,
the marina near us hosted a kingfish (king mackerel) tournament; those
fishermen were all &quot;tuned&quot; for that one type of fish, and they're
usually pretty successful.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
That sounds fun.   Do you not go in for that sort of thing, then?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Nope. For me, fishing is about relaxation (and often, really good food.)
Fishing competition seems like missing the point.</p>

<div class="section" id="chesapeake-1">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21" name="chesapeake">Chesapeake</a></h2>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Well, I lived in Annapolis and Baltimore for a couple of years apiece;
both of those are on the Chesapeake. The Bay certainly used to be prime
fishing grounds; Captain John Smith, who explored it 400 years ago,
reported it to be full of oysters that &quot;lay as thick as stones&quot;, and
that the Bay contained &quot;sturgeon, grampus, porpoise, seals, stingrays
... brits, mullets, white salmon [rockfish], trouts, soles, perch of
three sorts&quot; and lots of other shellfish.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Heavens!  He must had been spoilt for choice, lucky sod.</blockquote>
<p>In fact, there used to be so
many lobsters brought it while netting fish in that area that they were
used for fertilizer (lobsters were not considered human food by the
early settlers.)</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Wow.  Not human food?  Hehe.</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, these days, the Chesapeake - even though
still a somewhat-decent fishing ground - has been very seriously damaged
by agricultural runoff (especially phosphates); the algae growth
strangles the sea-grasses, of which the Chesapeake used to have the most
extensive areas in the world - and which are the nursery for a
tremendous percentage of the sea-life on the entire Eastern seaboard.
The oyster counts, done by the Draketail Project among others, show a
constantly decreasing population; areas that formerly contained 400
oysters per square foot may contain a dozen - or none.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Sigh.   That is a shame, but certainly not localised, alas.  Similar
things happen here, although the run-off you speak of from agriculture,
and especially other factories is more indicative of polluting the
fresh-water streams here in the UK.  There's typically a few cases
reported every few years or so -- and they're <em>bad</em> enough.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
[sigh] There's a reason that I'm a strong believer in environmental
causes. I've sailed through the Sargasso Sea to the south of Bermuda,</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<em>See:</em> <a class="reference" href="#sailing">Sailing</a></blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I bet that was nice.  I'm told it's very nice round those parts.</p>

<p>and seen mini-islands of floating garbage from Africa, and found the
eastern beaches of the Bahamas covered with French, etc. trash; I've
participated in building a Draketail boat and gone out with them,
watched the Navy divers come up with the oyster counts; I've talked to
the fishermen who went out of business by the thousands in Long Island,
the Chesapeake, and elsewhere. The destruction is far, far greater than
could be just blown off with an excuse like &quot;nostalgic recollections&quot; -
it's been enough to be clearly visible in my own lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
That's very sad indeed.  And such a wide area as well.  It's not the
sort of thing that can be rectified retrospectively either; once the
damage has been done, it takes a damn long time for it to be put right,
and it seems thanks to certain agencies within certain Governments, they
won't even try to do this to any great extent.</p>

As an complete aside (more of a tangent at 360 degrees), I might have
asked you this before (I can't remember, so I apologise in advance), but
during your many sailing excursions, have you come across lighthouses?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Heh. I see the St. Augustine lighthouse - one of the most important
navigational landmarks on the east coast of Florida - every morning as I
get up.</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.staugustinelighthouse.com/">http://www.staugustinelighthouse.com/</a></p>

I've bookmarked this.  For comparison, you can see what Trinity House
say about the lighthouses here:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I've seen perhaps hundreds of lighthouses in my sailing career, and
always enjoy them: they're one of the best friends a mariner has. GPS
can lie; charts can be misprinted; you can compute a sextant sight
incorrectly - but a lighthouse is an absolute position indicator that
you can trust.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Indeed.   All nautical people say this, and it's interesting to think
how such a simple idea is so pivotal.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
At sea, that's what stands the test of time. I find that my preference
for learning the old methods of seamanship (i.e., not only the right
things to do but <em>why</em> they're the right things, and how they were done
before there was a bunch of fancy equipment available) has come in handy
so often, and in so many tough situations, that I'm not sure how other
people manage without them. From what I've seen of sunken boats,
strandings, accidents, and just general inability to cope on the part of
many so-called sailors, I suspect that the answer is &quot;they don't&quot;. :|</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
/me nods.   It's not surprising, to be honest.  With the advent of
high-tech equipment, as you say, the actual process and reasoning behind
it all is not bothered with; technology has brought sailing to all kinds
of people as a result.  A bad and a good thing I am sure.  I get the
impression you own a sextant, somehow.  :)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
[laugh] Two of them - a good one and a cheap one. I also know how to
build several substitutes (progressively less accurate, but enough for
open-sea navigation) as well as getting the general latitude from the
stars using nothing more than a string and a weight.</p>

<p>Kat and I keep talking about taking a tour of this one, including
climbing to the top (219 steps, whew!) Should be fun, one of these days.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
You should.  :)  It looks like a nice lighthouse.</blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
There's a (fairly) famous lighthouse near to the beach that I fish on.
I went there for my birthday (I like lighthouses).  The attendant there
said that lighthouses all have a unique pulse that they generate their
light signals at so that any ship/boat can use that to identify the
lighthouse and know where they are.   I thought this was &quot;well cool&quot;,
and so I wonder whether you've had any dealings with lighthouses?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Well, I've seen a lot of different ones. In the Chesapeake and the
Delaware Bays, the lighthouses actually stand in the water, on pilings.
In the northeast - say, Rhode Island - all the lighthouses have sound
signals (there's a lot of fog up there, and during a real northeast
&quot;pea-souper&quot;, you can't even see your extended hand);</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
That must be very eerie indeed.   I've experienced some very thick and
localised fog before now, but never to the extent of it being
all-encompassing which is what I assume you're referring to.</p>
<p>I've always liked foggy weather.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>many of them sound
eerie, like ghosts in the fog, since they use so-called &quot;moaner&quot;
signals, as do a number of the navigational buoys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Well, Portland Bill sounds like a Banshee. ;)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
I look forward to hearing it someday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lighthouses are also
marvels of optical engineering; most of them are visible at over twenty
miles away, and, as you say, each one has its own &quot;unique pulse&quot; (called
its &quot;characteristic&quot;.)</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
That's it -- its characteristic.  I've seen one of these lenses, they're
fascinating things, and, as you say, are indeed a great piece of optical
engineering.  The actual light itself, the &quot;bulb&quot; is relatively small in
comparison to the rotating lens and mirrors structure surrounding it.

<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
There aren't anymore manned ones (at least not in the UK).  I'd have
really liked to have stayed in one, just for a bit <a class="footnote-reference" href="#lighthouse" id="id7" name="id7">[5]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Ditto in the US. As far as I'm aware, they were mostly automated back in
the 1960s.</p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
It definitely takes a certain type of person to have manned such a
thing.   I know it's a joke about chalk/tally marks on walls, but from
some of these accounts, that was a common practise amongst people who
stayed there.    It must have been a huge mental challenge for some.</p>

I agree. I learned to sail on the waddenzee, which is a small

It's been considered by biologists as the birth-chamber of fish and
sealife for the north-sea and part of the atlantic.</p>
<p>It's also IMHO one of the most challenging areas to sail in the world

That argues for a certain design philosophy which I appreciate. :)</p>

That's very nice to hear. Being dutch I'm aware that dutch ship-crafting

What size and what designer ??</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
10.5m by Pieter Beeldsnijder, built by Petersen BV. I have the original
plans, etc., but I'd be very excited to learn whatever else I can about
this design (history, etc.) If you know anything, I'd appreciate you
sharing it.</p>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
The challanging part of sailing in waddenzee is not so much bad weather
(it can be foul though) but the combination of strong currents, fast
shifting sandbanks and parts of it falling dry with lowtide. Very
beautiful...</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
As I understand it, there's also the fact that waves can build very
quickly there due to the generally shallow character of the water.</p>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
I do most of my sailing on traditional sailing freight ships.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
[long whistle] Oh, <em>nice</em>.</p>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
They have been reworked and rerigged to be used as charter-ships to 
cater for groups of 15-30 people.
It's a typical dutch design for shallow water with a draft (is that the 
correct term?) between 20 - 90 cm and side-blades to provide the 
necessary course stability.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Yep - a shallow-draft ship with leeboards. Very traditional Dutch
design, and great in shallow water. Also very nice for running downwind,
since you can decrease your &quot;wetted surface&quot; (i.e., friction with the
water) by raising the boards.</blockquote>

<p>The passaat is sailed by a friend of mine, and I regulary sail along, 
either as mate or as &quot;knowledgeable&quot; guest of the skipper.
Great fun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Oooh, a gaff rig. Sweet. I sail on one once in a while around here;
friends of mine run a &quot;head boat&quot; (1-2 hour cruises in this area, with
all sorts of on-board entertainment added), and I'm welcome to come
along - either as a &quot;knowledgeable guest&quot; or, whenever I feel like it, a
shanty singer.</p>

<p>Sailing the shallow inner-sea is challenging enough, let alone coming in 
from the atlantic in bad weather.
If the weather is foul, you'd be best advised to stay clear of this area 
and either sail along to one of the bigger open-sea harbours further 
along the cost. The inner-sea is ringed with 5 islands, the only way to 
get in is passing in between.
Current is hell there and sand-banks move fast. Basically any map of the 
area needs to be replaced every year.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[Nod] That reflects what I know about the area. Nice to have it
confirmed. Well, as they say, &quot;lee shores build character&quot;. :)</blockquote>
<p>The harbor of Vlieland (on of the islands) is a nice example ;-)
It's a small harbor which is only accesible though a small canal of 
approx. 8 metres width.
Depending on your timing in arriving you might find the current running 
4-5 knots in a 90 degree angle of the entrance.
The wooden poles that make up the entrance have nearly every color that 
people use to paint their boats with imprinted on them..</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[laugh] Yep, I've sailed in places like that (Palmas del Mar, Puerto
Rico comes to mind.) If you don't have a motor, and you decide that you
have to go in right then, you'd better be sure of your boat's
capabilities <em>and</em> your own ability to handle her perfectly.</blockquote>
<p>The amount of VOC ships that grounded around there and got beaten to 
pieces after surviving the entire journey from Holland to the East and 
back is pretty big. It apparently spawned an entire specialised 
profesion in the Golden Century of people able to live solely off the 
proceedings of wreck &amp; cargo salvage.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I met a retired Dutch tugboat captain here in Florida a number of years
ago; he had pulled a couple of government minesweepers off a shoal, and
- well, I mentioned that he was able to retire. :)</blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Places like that tend to worry seamen; the big freighters going up
Delaware Bay to Philadelphia tend to run their engines at maximum speed
for just that reason (I've seen a Chinese freighter doing (estimated) 25
knots there, something you'd never see in the open ocean, and
extraordinarily dangerous in that narrow channel; if they, say, lost
their steering, there'd be hell to pay and no pitch hot, since it would
take them ~5 <em>miles</em> to stop.) High waves mean low troughs - and if a
strong wind blows up before they can get out of the bay, and they happen
to touch the bottom with their hull for even a second, they're looking
at hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of repairs, if not the
complete loss of the vessel. Even heavy-gauge steel will rip like paper
when you've got several thousand tons of freight as a factor in inertia.</p>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
[Ugh] I do definitly not want to be anywhere near one of those if it 
loses steering.
No pilots ?? Or are they the people doing the speeding ?</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
The latter. There was a bunch of noise, some years ago, about companies
bribing the pilots to do that, but nobody was willing to screw around
with delaying cargos, so it was dropped.</blockquote>
<p>Must make for relaxed sailing there with the freighters doing 25 knots :-(</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
It's easy, actually: just stay out of the main channel, and stay aware
when you cross it. There's plenty of water for the average craft outside
of it. On the other hand, you'd find Currituck Sound in North Carolina
rather familiar: it's a huge body of water that averages ~1.3 meters in
depth, with a very skinny channel of deeper water cut through it. Did I
mention that North Carolina can be subject to very dense fogs at certain
times of year, as well as sudden rainstorms with near-zero visibility?
Did I also mention that I usually stay out of Currituck Sound by sailing
outside, in the Atlantic? :)</blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
Over the last 10 years I've seen my fishing expeditions there been
reduced from catching something every time round to catching nothing at
all most of the time. I've talked to many people who fish there who
recount the similar stories.</p>
<blockquote>
<em>See:</em> <a class="reference" href="#ramon-s-fishing">Ramon's fishing</a></blockquote>
<p>I find this extremely worrying and am not at all pleased with the fact
that you are reporting similar experiences from the saragasso.
Makes me sad :-(</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ramon-s-fishing-1">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id24" name="ramon-s-fishing">Ramon's fishing</a></h2>
<p>Reading the whole thread I should at least tell what I caught, if
translatable..</p>
<p>Most of the fishing I've done was done from sailing-boats, I hate
sitting down at the shore and waiting for a fish to bite. Since I've
mostly fished with line that means that I need &quot;slow&quot; wind otherwise the
boat will go way too fast for fish.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Depends on the fish, of course. Very few sailboats can go fast enough
for, say, swordfish; the preferred trolling speed for those is 10-15
knots.</p>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
Haven't seen those around here and probably never will unless global
warming takes far more serious turn in my lifetime ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since I usually try, even going slightly too fast, I've caught a lot of
&quot;geep&quot; (i have no clue on the english name for that fish) which is a
fish resembling a small sea-snake. The most distinguished part of it is
that if you cook it (or bake it more likely) it's spine turns bright
green. Nearly fluorescent. Traditionally dutch seafood would be a plate
with potatoes and vegetables in the middle with the geep around it
eating it's own tail. excellent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
According to the list I've just found at
<a class="reference" href="http://www.8ung.at/geowoerterbuch_online/art_fische.html">http://www.8ung.at/geowoerterbuch_online/art_fische.html</a> (which has
equivalent terms for fish in Latin, Deutsch, English, Norsk, and
Nederlander - as well as several other lists for plants, mushrooms, and
birds), and confirmed at a few other sources, it's a garfish - although
I've never heard of one with a fluourescent spine. That just sounds
amazing - and, given my attraction to strange food, very interesting. :)</p>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
It's an interesting meal that's for sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Easy to catch anything that glimmers in the water will draw their
attention, silverpaper will do.</p>
<p>I've caught a lot of mackerel and even own a small device (made of wood)
which keeps my line down below when fishing from the back of a sailing
boat and floats as soon as a mackerel has bitten.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
We call it a planer; they're very common wherever people fish for
salmon, since you have to troll rather deep for them. Another device
that accomplishes the same purpose (but with a lot more expensive
equipment) is a downrigger - a big lead ball on a wire that is lowered
to the desired depth, and which has a clip that holds the line until the
fish strikes.</blockquote>
<p>A friend of mine moved to greece and is working as sailing instructor
and flotielle captain in those waters. He introduced me to the joys of
calamaris fishing which seems to be the national sport in greece.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
[smile] I actually had a couple of squid jigs in my tackle box for many
years. Never had the occasion to use them, but then I've never been to
Greece.</p>
<p>For those who are interested, a squid jig is an elongated egg made from
a fluorescent material and surrounded by hooks. It's used at night after
being &quot;charged&quot; with a flashlight or (best of all) a camera flash; it's
lowered to the bottom wherever squid are found and then slowly raised.
When a squid sees what looks like one of its eggs &quot;break loose&quot; from the
bottom and float away, it tries to grab it...</p>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
I've fished with it and can report that they work excellently.
It's also nice to watch the squid go for it. I've also fished with
similar device which is supposed to represent a small fish. Works just
as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I've fished on &quot;harder&quot; which is rare to see on any market in
holland. Most of it is shipped straight to Japan. It's an interesting
process to catch it and quite exciting. You set up a net on a tidal
stream at low tide, wait for high tide and then get out into the water
around 1,5 hour before low-tide again. The &quot;harder&quot; are smart enough to
avoid the net under normal conditions, but if you scare them by chasing
them into the nets they'll get tangled and caught. Really nice to do and
very tasty fish to eat. Big fat white meaty fish mmmmmm....</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Ah - a mullet. Yes, we have a lot of those around here (this year,
they're very large and very fat.) Yes, it does indeed require a net -
although you can use a cast-net (a round net with weights around the
edges, thrown by hand), as many people around here do.</blockquote>
<p>I don't know how you feel about shell-fish, but the waddenzee is used as
one of the growth-places for mussels, which are grown on big mats and
afterwards lifted out and transported to belgium (or close to it) to
mature.</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I'm a big fan of mussels, and of most shellfish in general.</blockquote>
<p>(In less sandy waters) Every year at the end of the season we
usually organize a small boat trip with a couple of friends and beach
the boat near one of the grow-places in the sea. Most of the mussels
don't really keep to the matts which means that after the lifting a
large square of &quot;overgrown&quot; mussels is left. We usually eat so much
during that weekend that most of us lose appetite for the rest of the
year :-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
We do the same thing with big clams around here in the right season; the
way to get them is to walk slowly through very slippery, deep mud (under
a foot or two of water) while feeling for the clams with your feet and
without getting cut by the old, broken shells. It's quite a trick, but
the clams are huge and very, very tasty - especially when they're
steamed with Old Bay seasoning and served with a good-quality, cold
beer.</p>
<p>(I've just had dinner, and I'm suddenly hungry again. Mmm, clams.)</p>
<p><strong>[Ramon]</strong>
<em>Grin</em> I actually would like some as well right now :)</p>

<p>I had Chinese food for my dinner tonight, and there was a big fish tank
with very very large goldfish in them.   This one goldfish delighted in
swimming up to the oxygenating water jet, and letting the force of the
water push himself backwards.   Then he'd swim back to it, and do it
again.  I was in hysterics.</p>
