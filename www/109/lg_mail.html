Mandrake sucks.  I get a mess of warnings any time I start
a Gtk app because of the weird stuff they've done with their theme.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
I can give you my DarkGems gtk theme, would you like it?
I carefully mucked with it till it looked good on gimp and
some other gtk apps that eluded correct behavior under some themes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I have plenty of themes, it's that Mandrake is set up to look
for their own theme, and I can't get it to stop. My GTK package is
libgtk+-x11-2.0_0-2.5.2-0.1gpw.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
ohhh. I might be able to help you with that sometime.
If we do, then we can make a nice tip out of it.

<P><STRONG>
Hi,
Firstly I would like to congratulate you on a nicely written article. I
found it very useful.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In addition to the ways you have pointed out in your article there is
another method we can use to sync linux clocks to a central server. I am
talking about using rdate (<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/projects/rdate"
	>http://freshmeat.net/projects/rdate</A>).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
On the website:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
"The rdate utility retrieves the date and time from another machine on
your network, using the protocol described in RFC 868. If you run rdate
as root, it will set your machine's local time to the time of the
machine that you queried."
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I use the following command to sync my computers clock every day:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><CODE>
/usr/sbin/rdate -s tick.greyware.com
</CODE></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thought I should share this with you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks,
<BR>Suramya
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
'rdate' is just another program using port 37 (Time protocol) which is
what RFC-868 is about.  I think 'netdate' is more prevalent.  In fact,
you can use shell script, because the server returns number of second
since Jan 1, 1900, in 32-bit number.  So:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>    sec=`nc time.nist.gov 37 | od -A n -t xC | tr -d ' '`
    date --date="1970-1-1 0:0:$((0x$sec - 2208988800)) GMT"
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
where 2208988800 is to make it relative to Jan 1, 1970.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I find that there could be an extra 32-bit number for microseconds.
So, if you change the script to:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>    set -- `nc time.nist.gov 37 | od -An -txC`
    date -u --set="1970-01-01 0:0:$((0x$1$2$3$4 - 2208988800))"
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
you will use only the seconds.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You are encouraged to use UDP side of things.  The shell script has no
choice but to use TCP, because knowing when to exit 'nc' is a hassle.

"[sic] folks. <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>'s actual command (to do mass upgrades without breaking

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
You should avoid doing this for more reasons than one!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1. Since there are only three versions of Debian at any given time
you will reach the top of the charts in exactly two days! Once you
already run "unstable" (or "testing" for that matter), running:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
apt-get update; apt-get upgrade
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
should do the trick.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I do have to say, that 'upgrade' will not help you if they drastically
rearrange a package.  And, if you do it habitually you may not notice
that.  I don't recommend upgrades where you don't pay attention to such
details.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">The package that came to mind a long while back was vim.  With merely
'upgrade' Debian would have been glad to leave me in its older style of
package splits.  If only it could be told to offer the same care when a
package changes its config files under the hood.

The real way in which I was <EM>wrong</EM> is that neither 'upgrade' nor
'dist-upgrade' keywords break holds, and I claimed that the latter does.

Ciao, Didi -
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Glad you found it helpful! I appreciate your note... even though it was
sent to a very old (and nearly unread) address of mine and thus took a
<EM>long</EM> time to come to light.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Didi's comment refers to my "Clearing out the Master Boot Record"
article back in LG#63, which many people have found helpful over time; I
keep receiving grateful comments on it even now, years later. It's very
gratifying to know that I've been able to help so many folks with it.
The reason I'm making this reply a public one is for the new readers
of LG who may not be aware of this useful technique; the article can be

Woomert and Frink only get a brief cameo, but the one-liners are there.

Hi, Hans -
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thanks for the compliment! For the moment, I've written Woomert and
Frink into a blind alley; I think I need to put that particular story
aside, to be revised at another time (I mean, what kind of a Perl
one-liner can save an alien civilization, and from what threat??? Those
guys get themselves into the craziest predicaments...) and write another
one, not quite that deep.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
POLOTM isn't dead, just resting... but it's notes like yours that can
get me motivated to start it rolling again. Look for Woomert and Frink
in the future issues of LG.

Ben O's review of the Averatec laptop is exactly what I'd like to see
more of. It is accurate about the important things and gets right to the
point. Far and away the best laptop review I've even seen.
Thanks very much; I look forward to reading others as they become
available.

<P>
Thanks, BA - reader's compliments make for great author motivation. The
laptop reviews will continue happening (although I may skip a month in
between), and will only terminate on EXIT_SUCCESS - or factors beyond my
control. I definitely need a backup laptop, and will be "processing"
more of them.

Hello,

I came across your question about <a href="../authors/bint.html">Stephen</a> quite by accident, and thought
that, although there has been a response, I would take a moment to post a
personal reply.

We do not actually know the date of Stephen's death...........February 27th
was the day on which he was found by a farmer on Exmoor.
The ensuing inquest concluded that it was 'Death by
misadventure'...Hypothermia being the cause.
Thank you for caring enough to question his whereabouts............I know
many people will miss him and mourn his death.
</P>
<P>
He was my son.
