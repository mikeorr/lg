<h1>Away Mission: VMworld, IDF, OOW</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<h3>VMworld 2010</h3>

<p>
You can still catch the end of VMworld 2010 US, which is also just weeks
ahead of VMworld Europe in October. The conference theme is "Virtual Roads,
Actual Clouds" and will feature more than 170 unique breakout sessions
which focus on reducing IT complexity and enabling IT as a Service through
virtualization and cloud computing.  If that piques your techie interest,
consider catching live and on-demand keynote presentations available via
webcast at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/vmworld-general-sessions">http://www.vmware.com/go/vmworld-general-sessions</a>.
</p>

<p>
VMware will host its second Technology Exchange track for developers as
part of VMworld. This three-day event is open to all developers.  With
beginner and advanced levels, these sessions provide in-depth views of
developer tools, APIs, best practices, and, of course, cloud architectures.
</p>

<p>
This is a premium conference, as the registration rates show.  Expect a
great conference bag, great grub, interesting vendors with cool swag at the
Expo, and interesting people sitting next to you.  The VMworld 2010 agenda
is available at <a href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/conferences/2010/agenda/">http://www.vmworld.com/community/conferences/2010/agenda/</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I couldnt find a public archive for VMworld 2009 presentations, but here
is a link for community videos, which includes the video podcasts from the
VMworld 2009 Expo floor featuring VMware technical experts:<br>
<a href="http://www.vmworld.com/community/video/">http://www.vmworld.com/community/video/</a><br>
The fifth link page there contains short presentations like "NetApp VMware
View Integration"  which is also at
<a href="http://www.vmworld.com/thread/3188?tstart=120">http://www.vmworld.com/thread/3188?tstart=120</a>.
</p>

<h3>Intel Developer Forum</h3>

<p>
Coming up next in mid-September is the Intel Developer Forum (IDF). This
conference features  more than 150 technical sessions presented by Intel
and industry experts. The tracks cover topics like Cloud Computing,
Eco-Technology, Extending Battery Life, and High Performance Computing
(HPC).  there are also product tracks on Intel processors, solid-state
drives, visual computing and new SuperSpeed USB (USB 3.0) standard.
</p>

<p>
Beside the informal Chalk Talks from previous IDFs with Intel experts, IDF
2010 will also have Poster Chats, informal gatherings where researchers and
developers show the directions of their latest projects giving
attendees the opportunity to hear about  technology still early in the
development stage.  This is both a hardware and a software conference, and the
sessions vary greatly in technical depth.  Some are expert-only, some are
product-oriented and may be presented by Intel parnters - look at the talk
summaries and the speaker company information.
</p>  

<p>
Go to <a href="http://www.intel.com/idf/">http://www.intel.com/idf/</a> to see the agenda and/or register.
</p>

<p>
I couldnt find a link for the main content from IDF 2009, but IDF 2009
press site has links to the keynotes and selected technical presentations
here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/events/idffall_2009/video.htm">http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/events/idffall_2009/video.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
And here is a similar link for content from IDF Beijing 2010 in April:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.intel.com/idf/library/library-beijing-2010.htm">http://www.intel.com/idf/library/library-beijing-2010.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
In particular, let me point to the IDF 2009 Day 2 Keynote from Dadi
Perlmutter on the total mobile experience.  He showed the die-size
progression for mainline processors and also for the low-power (in both
senses) Atom chip family down to 15 nm.  Then he discussed the dream
criteria for mobile devices, which are all on Intels product map, natch:
</p>

<ul>
<li> built-insecurity (so thats why they bought McAfee)
<li> ease of use and networking
<li> long battery life
<li> and all in a lightweight package at a low cost...
</ul>

<p>
Didi and  Mooley Eden did a chip booster session, starting with the high
end Core i7 quad-core. Right, not exactly a chip for all-day battery use,
but he did highlight how core idling down to 2 and even 1 core (in the
newest processors) could drop power consumption significantly.
Basically, the quad-core Core i7 had similar performance at 45 watts to the
old single core Xeon chip which burned 150 watts. Thats one core to one
core.
</p>

<p>
Check out these images from that keynote:

<h3>Oracle Open World, and JavaOne</h3>

<img src="misc/dyckoff/wall.jpg" alt="Wall of Java"
align="left" style="margin-right: 50px; margin-bottom: 15px;" />


<p>
Finally, Oracle Open World (OOW)  arrives in late-September,  This year,
OOW rolls in the famous JavaOne conference to its stable of other user
conferences under the OOW umbrella.  That could mean several thousand more
developers attending an event which already has the population of a small
city, all struggling to to get to sessions at both JavaOne and Oracles own
Develop  mini-conference as well as sessions in other parts of downtown SF.
This could be interesting.  OOW is taking on the dimensions of COMDEX, but
without the noisey slot machines.
</p>

<p>
This years OOW is reported to have over 1800 sessions, including hundreds
of labs. And there could be almost 50,000 people competing with you for a
seat - just like COMDEX.
</p>

<p>
Expect some Open Source controversy over Oracles legal actions against
Google over Java patents at the 2010 Oracle Open World.  Apparently, these
concerns transcend Google's creation of its own JVM - the Dalvek VM - to
avoid licensing and certification issues.  So its "Clash of the Titans,"
San Francisco Bay Area style, and some of that may creep into the
conference sessions as well as the deluge of  Twitter posts.
</p>

<p>
In 2009, the big announcement was version 2 of the Oracle eXaData Database
Machine, based on Sun hardware.  And the hot topic was how Oracle would
shepherd - or dispose of - Sun's IP and product lines.  Oracle came out with
strong support for all of Sun's major product lines, especially Java and
MySQL. These topics will assuredly be visited again this year.
</p>

<p>
Since Oracle Open World is partly a customer appreciation event, the food
and conference bag are better than average.  Of course, the cost without
discounts is $2500.  You'd want something sensational for that.  In 2009, the
conference party included performances by AeroSmith, 3 Dog Night, and Roger
Daltry. Everybody felt like a VIP.
</p>

<p>
The 2009 OOW archive is not currently available, but the 2008 archive is.
This link lists all archives currently available:<br>
<a href="http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+OpenWorld">http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+OpenWorld</a>
</p>

<p>
Highlights from the 2009 keynotes and some of the OOW podcasts can be found
here:

and

</p>

<p>
Recently there were several OTN Virtual Developer Days (#OTNVDD) in the US,
India and China, but the presentations and labs are still available
on-line.  If you are a night owl, you can still register for the OTNVDD
scheduled on September 2nd for Russian developers.  Oracle provides over 2
GB of compressed VMDK files - this requires a machine with 2 GB of RAM and
at least 8 GB of free physical disk space. You can host all the provided
VM images with VirtualBox.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that some of these items, or items similar to them, will be included in
OOW 2010.  Get access to the VDD materials here:<br>
<a href="http://wiki.oracle.com/page/OTN+Virtual+Developer+Day">http://wiki.oracle.com/page/OTN+Virtual+Developer+Day</a>.
</p>

<p>
Comparing the varied Virtualization strategies at these 3 events will be
interesting. VMware and Intel are partners, but so are Red Hat and Intel.
The Oracle/Sun conglomerate is also an Intel partner, but Oracle is a
proponent of Xen while Red Hat is staunchly behind KVM.  Maybe with Oracle
battling both Google and the whole Open Source community, Intel is
the one to watch.
