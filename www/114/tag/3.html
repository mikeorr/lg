But I'm often confused as to what "the other half does". For
example, I am now using "fvwm" (thanks to Thomas' suggestions on how
to ratpoison-ify it). I <EM>know</EM> that "fvwm" traps some keys
and uses them for its own nefarious purposes.

Key-bindings as set by the user for the window manager are always greedy
with respect to the window manager.  So for instance, in FVWM, one might
have a key-binding such as:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Key X   A 3   Function FvwmTitleRxvt
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Now, of course, it might be the case that windowskey+X is an actual
binding to an application I have running, but it's tough -- the WM has
precedence in that binding as I have it defined there.

Always the window manager.  Remember that GNOME is just a framework and
a collection of utilities.  If you wanted a hierarchy, a depiction such
as the following is an accurate representation:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>GNOME &lt;--&gt; window manager --&gt; Application
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, the integration aspect of GNOME &lt;--&gt; Window Manager how
depends on EWMH.  I've talked about these in the past, but I might as
well summarise them here for clarity.  EWMHs are extensions from window
states which were first outlined by the ICCCM manual [1].  Unfortunately,
the ICCCM is rather old, but it does provide a fantastic framework on
which to build a WM, and it is still very relevant today.  When <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> and
GNOME were developing into the bloatware we see today, one thing they
both did were to extend the ICCCM to define their own window states.  Of
course, compatability became a nightmare in such instances, and so these
were cleaned up and standardised by the freedesktop people [2].  They're
only windowing hints at the end of the day for things such as 'Working
areas', 'Number of Desktops', and such like.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You may ask why the WM has precedence over an application, when it is
the job of the WM to manage applications.  The answer is simple.
Key-bindings are the job of the Xserver.  So actually the propogation
looks like this:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Xserver -&gt; Window Manager -&gt; Application.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
When you get your window manager to bind your keys for you, what's
actually happening is that the window manager will map the requests
itself, so it keeps a record of WM-specific keybindings.  When the WM
grabs the Xserver when it maps an application or a key-binding it then
checks to see (via the Xserver) whether that keybinding is WM-defined or
not.  If it <EM>is</EM> then it will act appropriately, else it will pass it
down to the underlying application, or do nothing.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

A similar question could be raised regarding how window positioning
and decorations are decided/executed. Perhaps the overall GNOME/GTK
theme decides and passes on the info to the window manager which
actually executes these?
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] 
Not quite.  GTK itself is window manager agnostic.  When you apply a
GTK-theme, all that happens is that any currently running GTK apps are
redrawn by the Xserver.  There is no interaction with the window manager
in anyway while this is happening.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, GTK themes don't really allow for the stylation of title bars
-- that's the job of the WM, and rightly so.  You have to remember
thatit's the job of the xserver to map the window which the WM then
grabs and decorates as it sees fit.  So the decoration could come in any
form.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Window positioning is a separate entity in itself.  When windows are
mapped to the Xserver, the server will naturally map it to 0+0 which is
top-left.  The window manager already has one window that is top-level,
and that is the root-window.  This is the ultimate window from which
everything else stems from, when windows are created.  Consider the
following Xlib snippet:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>win = XCreateSimpleWindow(dpy, DefaultRootWindow(dpy), xsh.x, xsh.y,
	xsh.width, xsh.height, bw, bd, bg);
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
I could easily spend hours talking about this line of Xlib alone, but
I'll save you the gory details.  Essentially, the point you should
realise is that all windows created in this way [3] are always a child
of the root-window.  Why?  Well, it's all about management.  Once the Wm
knows the top-level window, it knows how to stack windows as well as
place hints on them.  Of course, the WM is not allowed to change
application-set windowing hints when the window is being mapped.
Indeed, this is really where 'xprop(1)' comes in useful.  This allows
one to examine all of the window states as well as set them.  There's
also 'xwininfo(1)' for a more high-level view, although to be honest, I
prefer FvwmIdent for such things.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, with window hierarchies comes the notion of Transient
windows.  These are (by definition) short-lived windows, such as dialog
boxes.  They'll often have the the following hint set:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[n6tadam@station ~]$ xprop | grep -i trans
WM_TRANSIENT_FOR(WINDOW): window id # 0x2a0002e
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The window manager might well treat these differently -- indeed, FVWM
does.  Due to their short-lived nature, it's often not desireable to
have all buttons on the titlebar, so FVWM might well not decorate
transient windows in such a manner.  Of course, one can change that
with:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Style * DecorateTransient
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Anyway, window positioning is managed by the window manager.  The
geometry of a window defines its position on screen, and hence its size.
In the form:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>widthx height+/- xorigin+/- yorigin
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Note that the window geometry will often be with respect the actual
window itself, and not the frame that surrounds it. In slight relation
to that is a window gravity.  There's 'Window Gravity' and 'Bit
Gravity', and they specify for the window as a whole (including the
borders) and the window contents how to react on window resizing.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, as you have no doubt guessed, it is not quite as simple as
-geometry.  There is certain other hints that provide additional
positioning.  Take for instance Mozilla.  That doesn't have a
'-geometry' option because of they way it was designed.  Instead that
remembers its position (and hence window size) each time it is closed.
The WM can be instructed to ignore or react to such things.  As is the
case with FVWM there's a hint called 'NoPPosition'.  This instructs FVWM
to place the window based on what/where it tells the WM to put it.
Hence:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Style gecko NoPPosition
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
would be such an example [4].  There are instances though where a window
will use PPosition hints as well as accept geometries.  Notably,
[X]emacs is such a beast and will set its PPosition to (0,0) each time,
so overriding that is paramount for some. 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) " 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  Again, geometry
specifications take precedence over PPosition hints where they're
supported.

I hope this helps.  I could rabbit on for ages about all of this, but
I'd rather answer such things as they come up, as opposed to overloading
you with tedious information.  Unfortunately, information such as this
is sparse, and represents my understanding through working with FVWM,
and Xlib in general.

<LI>Of course, it doesn't have to be at the low-level such as Xlib.  Often, languages have wrapper functions around XCreateSimpleWindow() which will automatically map a window to be a child of the root window.

Oh, how I wish it did.
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) " 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> Not a big thing, but this has been a
long-standing problem with Mozilla for me (both the Big Moz and now
Firefox): Due to couple of info bars that I use (MailDooHicky and the
Moaning Goat Meter),I like for my windows to span from the left edge of
the screen to ~100px short of the right edge, and from ~30px down from
the top to ~30px short of the bottom. Xterms are, of course, no problem
- I've got "XTerm*VT100*geometry: 134x40+0+21" in my ~/.Xresources, and
that takes care of it. Mozilla, well... I've got a little Java
bookmarklet on the toolbar that makes it jump to the correct position
whenever I find it too annoying. But it <em>  never  </em> remembers the position.

It does work, but it's dependant on how the window manager deals with
such things.  I have to say that some WMs are better than others in this
regard.  It has been many years since I used icewm for any serious use,
but as far as I can recall, it doesn't allow for arbitrary commands to
be run on a window.

<blockQuote>
Eh, well... for certain values of 'arbitrary'... kinda sorta. :)
You can't (so far as I know, at least) run commands on a window once
it's up. You can, however, assign initial properties to windows
(actually, your discussion of all this stuff is what I needed to remind
me of that - thanks!) by defining them in ~/.icewm/winoptions; in this
case, what I needed was:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Gecko.Firefox-bin.geometry: 1212x722+0+23
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This sets the initial position of the window to what I need, which is
perfect.

In FVWM, doing what you're
describing above can be achieved in two ways, the first is to use a
function, as in:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>DestroyFunc FuncStartMoveBrowser
AddToFunc   FuncStartMoveBrowser
+ I Exec exec $0
+ I Wait $0
+ I Next ($0) ResizeMove w+0 -100px 0 -30p
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
(I've most likely got the co-ordinates wrong, but that can be left as an
exercise to the reader).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So the above will exec the first formal argument to the function ($0),
wait for it to appear, and then will move and resize it to the said
co-ordinates.  You might invoke it thus:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>FuncStartMoveBrowser mozilla
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
One would replace 'mozila' with whatever program was wanted.  But there
are limitations with that method.  The first one is that it will only
work when invoked from within a menu, or FvwmConsole, and won't work if
one were to type in 'mozilla' from an Xterm.  In such cases where this
is more desirable, FvwmEvent can be used, as in:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-Browser: *
*FvwmEvent-Browser: Cmd Function
*FvwmEvent-Browser: add_window  FuncStartMoveBrowser
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Which would set up an event for each window that was created, calling
the function specified.  The function as we have it defined needs
modifying for use with FvwmEvent, as the window would have already been
created, hence:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>DestroyFunc FuncStartMoveBrowser
AddToFunc   FuncStartMoveBrowser
+ I All (CurrentDesk, AcceptsFocus, !Transient) ThisWindow ("gecko") ResizeMove w+0 -100px 0 -30p
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
I've used 'gecko' as that is the window class common to both Mozilla and
Firefox.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You're probably wondering how this helps you, Ben.  It doesn't, <em> but </em>
there is an application which can move and resize windows which you
could make use of, coupled with xwininfo(1).  It's called 'xwit' and is
just a wrapper program around some of the Xlib functions, so for
example:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>xwit -move x y -resize x y -names 'mozilla'
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
If you wanted to get specific, you could use xwininfo to fine tune
things, matching by window ID, etc.  Maybe a little crude, but it might
help you.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben] 
[laugh] Well... it's got this little problem built in...
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~$ xwininfo|grep 'Window id'
xwininfo: Window id: 0xc00031 "Google Advanced Search - Mozilla Firefox"
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Since Firefox changes its window name to whatever the site happens to
be, I have to <em>  click  </em> the Firefox window in order to find out its window
ID (which could then be used to do 'xwit' twiddling.) This is, shall we
say, suboptimal for the task.
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) " 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> I'd imagine there are other ways to
hunt it down - 'xwininfo -all -root|grep Mozilla' comes to mind - but
that gets a bit shaky. Anyway, you've avalanched some synapses for
me, the appropriate brain cells fired, and All Is Now Well.

No worries.  You can probably get a fairly accurate result in making use
of '-root' to xwininfo, so something like:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[n6tadam@station ~]$ xwininfo -root -all -tree | grep -m1 'Mozilla-bin'
     0x282c250 "Gecko": ("Gecko" "Mozilla-bin")  200x200+0+0  +0+0
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
At least with it displayed in a tree form (and stopping at the first
match), you can be fairly well assurred that you'll be matching the
parent window.
