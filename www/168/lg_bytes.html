<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Urges Supreme Court to Exclude Patents to Software</h3>

<p>On October 1st, Red Hat filed an amicus brief with the United States
Supreme Court. In the brief, Red Hat explains the practical problems
of software patents to software developers. The brief, filed in the
Bilski case, asks the Supreme Court to adopt the lower court's
"machine-or-transformation" test and to make clear that it excludes
software from patentability.</p>

<p>The Bilski case involves the standard for patenting a process. The
case concerns a business method patent, but involves many of the same
issues as software patents.</p>

<p>"Red Hat continues its commitment to the free and open source software
community by taking a strong position against bad software patents,"
said Rob Tiller, vice president and assistant general counsel, IP for
Red Hat. "Our patent system is supposed to foster innovation, but for
open source and software in general, it does the opposite. Software
patents form a minefield that slows and discourages software
innovation. The Bilski case presents a great opportunity for the
Supreme Court to rectify this problem."</p>

<p>Patenting of software exploded in the 1990s based on judicial
decisions changing the test for patentable subject matter. Software
patents now number in the hundreds of thousands, and they cover
abstract technology in vague and difficult-to-interpret terms. Because
software products may involve thousands of patentable components,
developers face the risk of having to defend weak-but-costly patent
infringement lawsuits. A new class of business enterprise - patent
trolls - has developed to file lawsuits to exploit this system.</p>

<p>The Federal Circuit set forth a clear test to determine if a process
is patentable in stating that it must be either "tied to a particular
machine or apparatus" or must "transform a particular article into a
different state or thing." Red Hat argues that this standard is
consistent with Supreme Court case law, and that it should be applied
to exclude algorithms, including computer software, from patenting.</p>

<p>The scope of patentable subject matter is an issue of critical
importance to the future development of all software, including open
source. The upcoming Supreme Court's Bilski decision could clarify the
law and lessen the risks that innovation will be hindered by software
patents. Oral argument is scheduled for November 9, 2009.</p>

<p>Red Hat has supported patent reform to address problems posed to open
source and other software developers. It previously filed an amicus
brief in the Bilski case with the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. To
read the full amicus brief, visit

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Moblin 2 on new Netbooks</h3>

<p>Demonstrating industry momentum for netbooks and the Moblin operating
system, Renee James, general manager of Intel's Software and Services
Group, announced at IDF that the Dell Inspiron Mini 10v with would be
available with Ubuntu Moblin Remix Developer Edition pre-installed.
James also announced that ASUS and Acer have already launched and Samsung
is planning to launch Moblin 2-based netbook devices. Many operating
system vendors, including Canonical, CS2C, Linpus, Mandriva, Novell,
Phoenix and Turbolinux, announced at IDF that production-ready Moblin
version 2-based operating systems are now available. Moblin is an
open-source Linux operating system project for netbooks, handhelds,
smartphones and in-car computers.</p>

<p>Additionally, operating system support for Microsoft Silverlight will
be expanded to include Moblin early next year. Using Silverlight's
cross-platform foundation, developers can write applications once and
have them run on both Windows and Moblin devices.</p>

<p>In the same IDF keynote, James unveiled the Intel Atom Developer
Program. This effort encourages independent software vendors and
developers to create mobile applications. Intel is partnering with
manufacturers, including Acer and ASUS, to create multiple application
stores (like the iPhone store) where applications and application
building blocks for Atom-based netbooks and handhelds will be sold.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2><h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop, Server and UNR Editions Released</h3>

<p>Canonical released Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop Edition and Server Edition, the
latest version of its popular Linux distribution, for free download on
October 29th.  The 9.10 version of its UNR (Ubuntu Netbook Remix) OS is
also available.  This is the OS version previously known as Karmic
Koala.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 9.10 Desktop features a redesigned, faster boot and login
experience, a revamped audio framework, Firefox 3.5, and improved 3G
broadband connectivity, all of which contribute to a first-class user
experience.</p>

<p>With its '100 Paper Cuts' initiative to allow users to nominate minor
annoyances that impacted their enjoyment of the platform, over 50
fixes have been committed, removing minor irritants such as
inconsistent naming or poorly organized application choices. Larger
scale user experience improvements include a refreshed Ubuntu Software
Centre, giving users better information about the software they have
available.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 9.10 also includes the integration of 'Ubuntu One' as a
standard component of the desktop. Ubuntu One is an umbrella name for
a suite of online services released in beta in May 2009. Ubuntu One
simplifies backup, synchronization, and sharing of files with features
such as Tomboy Notes and contacts synchronization.</p>

<p>Developers interested in writing applications that run on Ubuntu now
have a simplified toolset called 'Quickly' which automates many
mundane programming tasks. Quickly also helps users 'package' the code
and distribute it through the Ubuntu software repositories. Ubuntu
developers will now find all code hosted in the Bazaar version control
system, which is part of the fully open source Launchpad collaboration
website.</p>

<p>Netbook and smartbook users will find improvements to the Ubuntu 9.10
Netbook Remix interface. Common with Ubuntu 9.10 for desktops UNR will
integrate the Empathy instant messaging program for text, voice,
video, and file transfers.</p>

<p>"Ubuntu 9.10 gives users more reasons than ever to seriously consider
Linux at a time when many are thinking again about their operating
system options. We are delivering a platform for users interested in
an easy-to-use, great-looking, Web-friendly operating system" says
Jane Silber, COO at Canonical.</p>

<p>At the press conference before the 9.10 release, Mark Shuttleworth, CEO
and founder of Canonical, remarked that he was "delighted Windows 7 was
out," and that, "now we can engage in a real head to head competition."
Shuttleworth added that after OEMs were using Linux on netbooks and smaller
devices they have "seen the advantage with having more than one OS vendor
and don't want to return to having only one choice."  Shuttleworth said he
expected Linux to continue to dominate in mobile devices because Windows 7
varients would be too expensive. He aslo noted that hardware OEMs were
doing a better job of supporting Linux, especially after Intel's efforts
with Moblin.</p>

<h4>Ubuntu 9.10 Server Edition: Cloud Computing made Easier</h4>

<p>Ubuntu 9.10 Server Edition introduces Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) as a
fully supported technology. This is an open source cloud computing
environment, based on the same Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as
Amazon EC2, and allows businesses to build private clouds.  Canonical CEO
and Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth began highlighting the embedded cloud
tools during the spring of this year.  Ubuntu 9.10 Server Edition will also
be available on the Amazon EC2 environment as an Amazon Machine Image
(AMI). For the purpose of portability, Ubuntu's UEC images are identical to
Ubuntu's AMI, and work done in one environment can be uploaded to the
other.</p>

<p>Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) is the umbrella name for a number of cloud
technologies, which includes the open source Eucalyptus project.  UEC makes
it easy and fast for system administrators to set up, deploy and manage a
cloud environment. Users familiar with Elastic Compute environments will be
able to build similar infrastructure behind their firewall, avoiding many
regulatory and security concerns that prevent many enterprises from taking
advantage of cloud environments. UEC also provides a tight integration with
power management tools such as the new Canonical-sponsored PowerNap project
which allows servers to be put to sleep when they are not actively
used.</p>

<p>Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud is preparing a store capability that will
provide users with easy access to ready-to-deploy applications in the
UEC environment. A first preview of this store is available in Ubuntu
9.10, together with a sample application. It will demonstrate
solutions to software vendors and additional applications will be
added after the release.</p>

<p>The core server product and kernel have also received significant
attention in this release. MySQL 5.1 has been added. The directory
stack and Single Sign On tools have been upgraded for improved
directory integration. Django now ships as a fully supported framework
enhancing web server options.</p>

<p>There have been numerous kernel improvements to better support both Xen
(guest) and KVM (host and guest) virtualization, and to improve caching
performance. Support for the USB 3.0 protocol has been included to support
super speed transfer rates when devices become available. System management
support has been extended through support for the WBEM (Web-based
enterprise management) protocols which open up support of the Ubuntu
environment to the most popular system management tools currently deployed
in enterprises and allows them to interact more easily with Canonical's
management tool for Ubuntu, called Landscape.</p> <p>Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud
is included as part of Ubuntu 9.10 Server Edition. Landscape Server
Management System is available at <a
href="http://www.canonical.com/projects/landscape">http://www.canonical.com/projects/landscape</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier press reports erroneously listed Ubuntu 9.10 as having early
support for the new USB 3.0 standards.  This support is actually planned
for the next release.</p>

<p>Ubuntu Desktop and Server Editions and UNR are entirely free of charge
and can be downloaded from <a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com">http://www.ubuntu.com</a> .  Ubuntu One offers
2 GB storage for free, and 50 GB for $10 per month.</p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA Goes Open Source</h3>
<p>JetBrains, the creators of productivity tools for software developers,
announced announced in October the public preview of the free
Community Edition of its award-winning Java IDE, IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

<p>Starting with the upcoming version 9.0, IntelliJ IDEA will be offered in
two editions: Community Edition, free and open-source, and Ultimate
Edition, which until October was simply IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Community Edition removes cost as a major
barrier to a wider use of IntelliJ IDEA for pure Java development.
This edition is not only free, its also fully open-sourced.</p>

<p>"We've always been open to the community - with our public Early Access
Program, issue trackers, forums, and so on. This made for a tight and
direct feedback loop with our users, even at a time when this wasn't a
widely accepted practice in the industry. Since then, we've supported
hundreds of open-source projects with free product licenses, contributed
code to various open-source projects like Groovy and Scala, and developed
several open-sourced IntelliJ IDEA plugins ourselves," said Sergey
Dmitriev, JetBrains CEO.  "So, you can see how offering the IntelliJ IDEA
experience for free, through an open-source license, goes hand in hand with
our focus on the community. Open source has become the mainstream, and we
continue to embrace it as an exciting challenge."</p>

<p>The new Community Edition is built on the IntelliJ Platform and includes
its sources. JetBrains has made it as easy as possible to access and use the
source code of the Community Edition and the IntelliJ Platform, by applying the
democratic Apache 2.0 license to both of them.</p>

<p>The IntelliJ Platform serves as a basis for a wide range of other
innovative JetBrains tools, designed for development in specific
languages and/or domains. These tools include RubyMine, MPS, a web
development IDE (already in public preview), and others currently in
development.</p>

<p>IntelliJ split the two editions based on a functional principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community Edition is for those working on pure Java/Groovy
applications or doing Swing development. It has all the crown jewels
of IntelliJ IDEA, including various refactorings and code inspections,
coding assistance, debugging, TestNG and JUnit testing; CVS,
Subversion and Git support, as well as Ant and Maven build
integration.
 
<li>Ultimate Edition is a full-featured commercial IntelliJ IDEA with the
complete set of web and enterprise development tools, traditionally 
providing
top-quality support for the most important modern technologies and 
frameworks.
</ul>

<p>The new features of Ultimate Edition version 9 include: </p>
<ul>
<li> Java EE 6, with JSF 2.0, JPA 2.0, Servlets 3.0, Bean validation, 
etc; <br />
<li> Android, Google App Engine, GWT; <br />
<li> Adobe AIR, FlexUnit; <br />
<li> JavaScript refactorings and debugging; <br />
<li> Tapestry, OSGi, PHP; <br />
<li> Tight Perforce, ClearCase and Microsoft Team Foundation integration.</ul>

9, and to download the Preview build, please visit

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Smallest Wireless N USB Adapter Now Available from TRENDnet</h3>
<p>TRENDnet has released what is possibly the world's smallest 150Mbps
Mini Wireless N USB Adapter, its model TEW-648UB product. The ultra
compact form factor is slightly larger than a U.S. quarter, measuring
a remarkable 1.3 inches (3.3 cm) from end to end.</p>

<p>The 150Mbps Mini Wireless N USB Adapter connects a laptop or desktop
computer to a wireless 'n' network at up to 6x the speed and 3x the
coverage of a wireless 'g' connection. One-touch Wi-Fi Protected Setup
or WPS technology eliminates the hassle of entering complicated codes
in order to connect to a wireless network.</p>

<p>Advanced wireless encryption protects your valuable data. Wi-Fi
Multimedia (WMM) Quality of Service prioritizes important video, audio
and gaming traffic to create a premium wireless experience.</p>

<blockquote>"We have looked high and low and are confident in our claim that the
	TEW-648UB is the smallest adapter on the market today. In fact it is
	half the size of the average wireless N USB adapter.", stated Zak
	Wood, Director of Global Marketing for TRENDnet. "Despite its
	diminutive size, it performs well. We welcome all independent tests
	against any other 150Mbps (or 1x1) adapter on the market today. The
	adapter features an equally small price tag.  With a predicted street
	price in the low $20 range, this adapter sets a new
	price-to-performance standard."</blockquote>

	<p>The 150Mbps Mini Wireless N USB Adapter, model TEW-648UB, has an MSRP
of US $24.99.</p>
