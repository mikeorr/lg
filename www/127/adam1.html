<h1>FvwmEvent: conditional window checking by example</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/adam.html">Thomas Adam</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Most window managers have some form of automation that allows the user to
'script' various aspects of its operation. Indeed, the 'kahakai'
<sup><a name="text1" ref="#note1">1</a></sup> window manager has long since
defined Python as way of scripting its capabilities.</p>

<p>In FVWM, there are a few ways of scripting events. The use of FvwmPerl
is one such way. However, in almost all cases, when people say they want to
define actions, what they're really after is some way of conditionally
checking windows when they're created, or something similar. The
combination of this ability coupled with a series of commands grouped
together to form what FVWM calls a <tt>function</tt> is something that can
be quite powerful.</p>

<h3>What is FvwmEvent?</h3>

<p><code>FvwmEvent</code> is a module - a piece of code that is separate
from the core of FVWM. There are a lot of different modules in FVWM, all of
which share that important distinction; there's no point in loading extra
code which might never be used, or loading it on an ad-hoc basis where the
user never requested it.</p>

<p><code>FvwmEvent</code> is a module which allows listening for various events,
and acting upon them when they occur. Originally it was known as <code>FvwmAudio</code>, since its job
was primarily in playing sounds when various things happened (such as a window
being closed, iconified, etc). <code>FvwmEvent</code> still retains
that functionality, but now also has the capability of running specific
tasks based on those events.<p>

<p>So what are these events? They're triggers associated with the
operations of windows (many of which are wrappers around various low-level
Xlib library calls). Whenever an event that <code>FvwmEvent</code> has been
told to listen for occurs, it will look for an associated action and
execute it. A sample valid list of events that <code>FvwmEvent</code> knows
to listen for can be seen in its man page<sup><a name="text2"
href="#note2">2</a></sup>. The one this article will examine is
<tt>add_window</tt>; note that this is only a working example, and should
be thoroughly tested before using in production.</p>

<h3>FvwmEvent Example</h3>

<p>A generic <code>FvwmEvent</code> configuration looks like the following (note that the
line numbers have been added as a convenient reference point, and are not
part of the configuration):</p>

<pre class="code">
   1   DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent: *
   2   *FvwmEvent: &lt;some_event_name&gt; &lt;some_action&gt;
   3 
   4   Module FvwmEvent
</pre>

<p>The very first thing that happens is that the module config is destroyed
(Line 1). This might seem a little strange at first given that nothing has
been declared yet, but the point of it here is that for any previous
definitions of it (say via multiple parsings of one's '.fvwm2rc' file during
restarts), it gets destroyed and then recreated; otherwise, the module
definition would just be added to continuously - something that is most
undesirable. What follows next (line 2) is the start of the alias
definition that <code>FvwmEvent</code> will eventually read. Obviously &lt;some_name&gt;
and &lt;some_action&gt; are dependent on the event and the action required.
&lt;some_action&gt; might be a function, or a single command. Line 4 simply
tells FVWM to load the <code>FvwmEvent</code> module.</p>

<p>Note the concept of what's happening. Most modules have the concept of
aliases - that is, an identifier that the module can be told to use
(in earlier version of FVWM, in order for multiple aliases of a specific
module to be used, one had to symlink the alias name to the module). In the
case of the generic example above, that's using <tt>*FvwmEvent</tt> which
is fine until more instances of <code>FvwmEvent</code> need to be loaded.
It's permissible, of course, to just have one instance of
<code>FvwmEvent</code> running and declare all the events it will listen
for in there. The problem is that it's often desirable to run different
actions on the same event - something you can't do with one alias. So the
heuristic approach is to define a unique alias to <code>FvwmEvent</code>,
which isn't <tt>*FvwmEvent</tt>. Any name can be used, as will become
apparent.</p>

<h3>add_window event: maximising windows</h3>

This is perhaps the most common event people use when they consider running
commands on a window. This event is triggered whenever a window is mapped
(created) to the screen<sup><a name="text3" href="#note3">3</a></sup>.
Perhaps one of the most common operations that people wish to perform when
this happens is maximizing a window. This has been covered in part in the
main FVWM FAQ<sup><a name="text4" href="#note4">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Of course, in encountering this question, it is often the case that when
people say 'maximised', they also mean so-called 'full-screen' -
which implies the removal of any title bars and borders, and other such
window decorations. That's fine, and can be dealt with at a later stage,
although the premise of maximisation has to be discussed first of all.</p>

<p>It also seems to surprise many people that FVWM has no 'StartMaximised'
style option. The reason for this is that in introducing such an option it
would break the ICCCM<sup><a name="text5" href="#note5">5</a></sup> - since
clients set their own geometry, either by themselves or via user
interaction.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done is setting up <code>FvwmEvent</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyModuleConfig FE-StartMaximised: *
  *FE-StartMaximised: Cmd Function
  *FE-StartMaximised: add_window StartAppMaximised

  Module FvwmEvent FE-StartMaximised
</pre>

<p>This tells <code>FvwmEvent</code> a few things. One is that the alias we're using for
it is <tt>*FE-StartMaximised</tt>. Secondly, we've informed the module
that the command specified for the event is a function. Thirdly,
the event we're listening for is <tt>add_window</tt>. Then the module is
started.</p>

<p>The function we'll declare is quite simple to start off with (again, line
numbers are for point of reference only, and are not part of the
syntax):</p>

<pre class="code">
   1   DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
   2   AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
   3   + I Maximize
</pre>

<p>Line 1 destroys the previous function definition. It's generally a good
idea to do this when declaring functions, since it removes a previous
definition for it. Indeed, the <tt>AddToFunc</tt> command (line 2) is
cumulative. Each time it is used, it just adds to the definition of the
function. If it doesn't exist, the function is created. Quite often
this cumulative nature isn't wanted, so removing the definition beforehand
is advised. Line 3 is the important line since it is the line which
defines the action for the function.</p>

<p>One can define as many actions within a function as is necessary. There
are a few prefixes as well which define when and how those actions are to
be invoked:</p>

<table>
  <tr><td align=center colspan=2>Function Operators</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>Context</td>
    <TD ALIGN=left NOWRAP>Meaning</TD>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>I</td>
    <td align=left>Immediate - executed as soon as the function is
      called.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>C</td>
    <td align=left>Click - executed when the mouse button is clicked
      once.</td>
  </TR>

  <tr><td align=center>D</td>
    <td align=left>Double-click - executed when the mouse button is
      double-clicked.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>M</td>
    <td align=left>Motion - executed when the mouse is moved.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr><td align=center>H</td>
    <td align=left>Hold - executed when the mouse button is held
      down.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>Usually the most common operator is <tt>I</tt> for non-interactive functions,
since those commands will always get executed when the function is called.
So within this example, the command <tt>Maximize</tt> is run whenever a
window is created. Try it and see; start up an xterm. It will then be
maximised. Start up any application in fact, and all of those windows
will be maximised. Clearly this is suboptimal, but a start nevertheless.

<h3>Function Context</h3>

<p>So far, it's been shown how one can use <code>FvwmEvent</code> plus a
function to define actions for events. But there will be times in loading
applications (which produce windows mapped to the screen) when some windows
won't get maximised. The reason for this has to do with the <i>context</i>
in which the function is being run.</p>

<p>In most cases, functions are designed to run within a window context. This
means that, when they're run, it's known which window or windows the
function is to start operating from. Without the proper context, a
function will prompt for one, or not run at all. So it's important to
ensure a context is forced wherever it's not apparent.</p>

<p>One can achieve this is in a number of ways, and a lot of it depends upon
the situation the function is likely to be called in. Recall the
definition for <tt>StartAppMaximised</tt> - at the moment the line looks
like:

<pre class="code">
+ I Maximize
</pre>

<p>This already assumes a window context. But one can always make sure by
using the <tt>ThisWindow</tt> command, as in:</p>

<pre class="code">
+ I ThisWindow Maximize
</pre>

<p>ThisWindow is extremely useful to refer to windows directly without
implying any presumptions. Indeed, there are other conditional commands,
such as <tt>Current</tt>, which is quite a common way to imply
context:</p>

<pre class="code">
+ I Current Maximize
</pre>

<p>However, its use implies that the window already has focus. Sometimes this
is useful to refer to the specific window; however, in the case of the
<tt>StartAppMaximised</tt> function one cannot assume the operand windows
will always have the focus - hence, the use of <tt>ThisWindow</tt> is
preferable. Where one is unsure as to the operand window (i.e., it is to be
decided when the function runs), one can use the <TT>Pick</TT>
command which will prompt for a window to operate on if it is not already
known.</p>

<h3>Improving StartAppMaximised</h3>

Whilst the function does work, it needs improving. For a start, the function
is maximising every window that is created - this is clearly not
something likely to be desirable. One can conditionally place
restrictions on windows by matching against their name, class or resource
by using any of the conditional commands mentioned earlier:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window") Maximize
</pre>
<p>What happens here is that only the window with the name 'name of window'
is considered. If it matches the window just created, then it is
maximised; otherwise, nothing happens. Of course, the maximize command has a
toggling action to it. If the said window 'name of window' were to
already be maximised at the time it was created (presumably via some
command-line flag) then the maximize command would have the opposite
effect, "unmaximising" it. Luckily FVWM has a conditional test,
<tt>Maximized</tt> that can be used to test if the window is maximised.
The negation of this is <tt>!Maximized</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">  
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window",!Maximized) Maximize
</pre>

<p>Looking better, certainly. There's still room for improvement, though. In
FVWM 2.5.X, one is able to specify multiple windows to match on, if more
than one window need be considered:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window|another window", \
      !Maximized) Maximize
</pre>

<p>The '|' operator acts as a logical OR command, matching either of the
titles and applying the maximized condition to the (possibly) matched
window. In FVWM 2.4.X, one would have to use multiple lines one after the
other:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window",!Maximized) Maximize
  + I ThisWindow ("some_window",!Maximized) Maximize
</pre>

<p>There's still one more condition to consider: different window types. Up
until now, the assumption has been that normal windows are considered.
Whilst in most cases that's true, FVWM has (at the simplest level) two
different window types that it manages; ordinary application windows and
transient windows. By its very nature, a transient window is one which is
generally only on screen for a short length of time. Also known as 'popup'
windows, they're typically used for 'Open' and 'Save' dialogue windows. It's
not likely (due to their implementation) that one is going to be able to
maximise them anyway, but it's worth excluding them. FVWM allows for this
via the <tt>Transient</tt> conditional check, which can be negated to
<tt>!Transient</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
  DestroyFunc StartAppMaximised
  AddToFunc   StartAppMaximised
  + I ThisWindow ("name of window|another window", \
      !Maximized, !Transient) Maximize
</pre>

<h3>Full-screen mode</h3>

<p>The basis and functionality for the <tt>StartAppMaximized</tt> function is
complete. The last remaining item is to make certain windows borderless
and to remove their title so that they appear to cover the entire
viewport. In the simplest case, the window's name or class is known
beforehand, and an appropriate style line can be set<sup><a name="text6" href="#note6">6</a></sup>. For example:</p>

<pre class="code">
Style "name of window" !Title, !Borders, HandleWidth 0, BorderWidth 0, ResizeHintOverride
</pre>

<p>That line ought to be pretty self-explanatory. The
<tt>ResizeHintOverride</tt> condition makes those applications which are
column-sized aware (such as XTerm, GVim, XV, etc) not to be so. Without
it, some applications would leave a noticeable gap at the bottom of the
screen.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This has been a very brief look into how <code>FvwmEvent</code> can be
used to monitor and react to various events.  The most important thing to
remember about the use of <code>FvwmEvent</code> is specificity: always be
as specific as possible when operating on windows. Where a certain amount
of automation is required, always enforce a given context, unless it's a
requirement that the user is to select an appropriate operand window at the
time the event is triggered.</p>

<p>I used to write the long-running series "The Linux Weekend Mechanic",
which was started by John Fisk (the founder of Linux Gazette) in 1996 and
continued until 1998.  Articles in that format have been intermittent, but
might still continue in the future.  I currently write occasional articles
for LG, whilst doing a few things behind the scenes.  I'm also a member of
The Answer Gang.</p>

<p> I was born in Hammersmith (London UK) in 1983.  When I was 13, I moved to
the sleepy, thatched roofed, village of East Chaldon in the county of Dorset.
I am very near the coast (at Lulworth Cove) which is where I used to work.
Since then I have moved to Southampton, and currently attend University
there, studying for a degree in Software Engineering.</p>

<p> I first got interested in Linux in 1996 having seen a review of it in a
magazine (Slackware 2.0). I was fed up with the instability that the then-new
operating system Win95 had and so I decided to give it a go.
Slackware 2.0 was great. I have been a massive Linux enthusiast ever
since.  I ended up with running SuSE on both my desktop and laptop
computers.  Although I now use Debian as my primary operating system.</p>

<p>I am actively involved with the <a href="http://www.fvwm.org">FVWM</a>
project, writing documentation, providing user-support, writing ad-hoc and
somewhat esoteric patches for it.</p>

<p> Other hobbies include reading. I especially enjoy reading plays (Henrik
Ibsen, Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw), and I also enjoy literature (Edgar Allan
Poe, Charles Dickens, Jane Austen to name but a few).</p>

<p> I am also a keen musician. I play the piano in my spare time.</p>

<p>Some would consider me an arctophile (teddy bear collector).</p>

<P> I listen to a <a href="http://edulinux.homeunix.org/music.rbx">
variety of music</a>.</p>
