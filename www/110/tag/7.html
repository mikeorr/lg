Next time try to be a bit more clearer in your request. It would make it
easier for us to answer your question.

Interestingly enough, earlier today Jimmy pointed me to a couple of
sites in Hebrew that looked like translations of some LG articles -
and beziqint.net is an ISP in Israel. Coincidence? Maybe...

In general, our foreign correspondents do a fine job of asking good
questions; ronen, obviously, has missed on that count (I originally
received his email at our "tag-kb" address, which is used for contacting
the KnowledgeBase maintainer.) However, since his question <EM>is</EM> of broad
interest to new Linux users, we'll let him off with a term in a
chroot(1) jail and a careful reading of "Asking Questions of The Answer
Gang" at <A HREF="../../tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A> for future
reference - and I'll see if we can make this into a useful exchange.
(I'm feeling particularly pedantic today; as a net.friend once said, "it
gets me chicks.")

So, to ask the question that ronen (theoretically) was trying to ask:

Hi there, Answer Gang! I'd like to know how to open .tgz and .zip files
under Linux. The standard documents are confusing, searching the Internet
gives me too many results, and I don't know where else to look.  I'd
appreciate your help.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<blockQuote>
Why, hi there, ronen! Nice of you to ask in such a clear,
understandable, and polite manner and give me a chance to pontificate on
the topic!

There are a number of ways to deal with compressed files in Linux. One
that's probably easiest for the new user is to use Midnight Commander's
"VFS" (Virtual File System) feature - you simply place the highlight on
the name of the compressed file you want and press the 'Enter' key. This
will let you look inside the file and copy out anything you want. The
default VFS setup handles bzip, bzip2, gzip, compress, ar, zip, jar,
xpi, zoo, lha, and arj compressed formats (assuming that you have the
appropriate decompression software installed.) You can run Midnight
Commander by typing "mc" at the command line, either in the console or
in an xterm window if you're running X.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you want to do it manually, typing the name of the appropriate
decompressor (possibly followed by options) and the name of the file to
decompress at the command line should do it - but beware of "file
scatter", i.e., what happens when the person who created the file did
not use a directory structure to contain all the files. These will now
be scattered all over the directory into which you've decompressed them
- usually the current one. In general, it's a Good Idea to list the
files before decompressing the archive - or look into the file with
Midnight Commander, as mentioned above - just so you know what to expect.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Some examples of listing syntax for various decompressors:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre># Gzipped tar file
tar tzf file.tgz

# tar file compressed with bzip2
tar tjf file.tar.bz2

# zipfile
unzip -l file.zip

# ARJ file
unarj l file.arj
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Typing the name of the decompression program followed by '-h' or
'--help', just as is suggested at the very top of "Asking Questions of
The Answer Gang" at (<A HREF="../../tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A>),
will show you the option list for that program.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You can also use one of several GUI decompression tools, such as
"guitar" (cute name, eh?) which act somewhat similar to WinZip in
Windows; you may find that environment to be more familiar and
comfortable. Do realize, however, that you'll be missing out on a lot of
the capabilities available at the command line; GUIs are cute, but the
CLI is powerful.
