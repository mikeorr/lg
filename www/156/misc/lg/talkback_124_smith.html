I've tried and tried and I can't get this to work, I'm using Debian/etch,
xorg 7.3, and xdm.   When try to start the X server manually, seat0 works
ok, but I've had varying success with seat1, sometimes it starts, but not on
the same vt, so monitor0 goes black, or it will start on the same vt, but no
window manager will start, the mouse and keyboard work ok though.  I've
looked at an exhaustive amount of other howto's, but most of them are
outdated, saying I need Xephyr to do it.  I've gone to irc.freenode.net and
went to #xorg, but no one there even talks at all, just a bunch of IRC
trolls I guess.  I don't know where to look for help anymore, so I'm writing
this email.  I don't want to be a bother, but I just don't know what else to
do.   Thanks.

So -- what's in your /var/log/Xorg.0.log file?

Umm, if they're suggesting you use Xephyr, then they can't be outdated
-- Xephyr is a recent and proposed replacement for Xnest, although I
agree the use Xephyr is probably tangential to your solution.
