<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation User Survey Shows Enterprise Gains</h3>

<p>At its recent End User Summit, the Linux Foundation published "Linux 
Adoption Trends: A Survey of Enterprise End Users," which shares new 
data that shows Linux is poised to take significant market share from 
Unix and especially Windows while becoming more mission critical and 
more strategic in the enterprise.</p>

<p>The data in the report reflects the results of an invitation-only 
survey of The Linux Foundation's Enterprise End User Council as well 
as other companies and government organizations. The survey was 
conducted by The Linux Foundation in partnership with Yeoman 
Technology Group during August and September 2010 with responses from 
more than 1900 individuals.  </p>

<p>This report filters data on the world's largest enterprise companies 
and government organizations - identified by 387 respondents at 
organizations with $500 million or more a year in revenues or greater 
than 500 employees.</p>

<p>The data shows that Linux vendors are poised for growth in the years 
to come as large Linux users plan to both deploy more Linux relative 
to other operating systems and to use the OS for more mission critical 
workloads than ever before. Linux is also becoming the preferred 
platform for new or "greenfield" deployments, representing a major 
shift in user patterns as IT managers break away from legacy systems.</p>

<p>Key findings from the Linux adoption report:</p>

<p>* 79.4 percent of companies are adding more Linux relative to 
other operating systems in the next five years.</p>

<p>* More people are reporting that their Linux deployments are 
migrations from Windows than any other platform, including Unix 
migrations. 66 percent of users surveyed say that their Linux 
deployments are brand new ("Greenfield") deployments.</p>

<p>* Among the early adopters who are operating in cloud 
environments, 70.3 percent use Linux as their primary platform, while 
only 18.3 percent use Windows.</p>

<p>* 60.2 percent of respondents say they will use Linux for more 
mission-critical workloads over the next 12 months.</p>

<p>* 86.5 percent of respondents report that Linux is improving and 
58.4 percent say their CIOs see Linux as more strategic to the 
organization as compared to three years ago.</p>

<p>* Drivers for Linux adoption extend beyond cost - technical 
superiority is the primary driver, followed by cost and then security.</p>

<p>The growth in Linux, as demonstrated by this report, is leading 
companies to increasingly seek Linux IT professionals, with 38.3 
percent of respondents citing a lack of Linux talent as one of their 
main concerns related to the platform.</p>

<p>Users participate in Linux development in three primary ways: testing 
and submitting bugs (37.5%), working with vendors (30.7%) and 
participating in The Linux Foundation activities (26.0%).</p>

<p>"The IT professionals we surveyed for the Linux Adoption Trends report 
are among the world's most advanced Linux users working at the largest 
enterprise companies and illustrate what we can expect from the market 
in the months and years ahead," said Amanda McPherson, vice president 
of marketing and developer programs at The Linux Foundation.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Puppy Linux 5.1 released</h3>

<p>The new Puppy Linux 5.1, code-name "Lucid" as it is binary-compatible 
with Ubuntu Lucid Lynx packages, has been released. Lucid Puppy 5.1 is

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu Rescue Remix 10.10 Released</h3>

<p>Version 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) of the data recovery software toolkit 
based on Ubuntu is out.  This is an Ubuntu-based live medium which 
provides the data recovery specialist with a command-line interface to 
current versions of the most powerful open-source data recovery 
software including GNU ddrescue, Photorec, The Sleuth Kit and 
Gnu-fdisk. A more complete list is available here: 
<a href="http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/Software">http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/Software</a>.</p>

<p>The live Remix provides a full shell environment and can be downloaded 
here: <a href="http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/files/URR/iso/ubuntu-rescue-remix-10-10.iso">http://ubuntu-rescue-remix.org/files/URR/iso/ubuntu-rescue-remix-10-10.iso</a>.</p>

<p>This iso image is also compatible with the USB Startup Disk Creator 
that has included with Ubuntu since 9.04. PendriveLinux also provides 
an excellent way for Windows users to put Ubuntu-Rescue-Remix on a 
stick.</p>

<p>The live environment has a very low memory requirement due to not 
having a graphical interface (command-line only). If you prefer to 
work in a graphical environment, a metapackage is available which will 
install the data recovery and forensics toolkit onto your current 
Ubuntu Desktop system.</p>

<p>The toolkit can also be installed on a live USB Ubuntu Desktop with 
persistent data. To do so, add the following archive to your software 
channels: <br />
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/arzajac/ppa/ubuntu lucid main</p>

<p>Then authenticate this software source by running the following 
command:<br />
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys BDFD6D77</p>

<p>Then, install the "ubuntu-rescue-remix-tools" package.</p>
