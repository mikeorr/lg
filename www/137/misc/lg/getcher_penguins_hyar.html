<p>In an interesting bit of synchronicity, I got one of those
emails that Kapil was talking about - no spam content, just...
stuff. This one, however, seems to have hit it's mark (Mike Orr
would be choking from laughter by now.) The subject, in Russian,
means "ALL for the purchase of penguins" - and the content is just
"penguin".</p>
<p>Silly spammers... why would we want to buy one after they've
already sent us a perfectly good one???</p>

<p>This is uncanny. You mean spammers know that Ben likes
penguins?</p>
<p>Of course, I really suspect that this is more like
astrology---we are hearing from the one case when the match
occurred and not from the n-1 cases where it did not.</p>
