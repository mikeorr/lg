Hello
</p>

<p>
   Thanks for the article.  I'm attempting to make this work with the 64 bit
   version of Ubuntu server 8.10 and the 64bit version of vmware server
   2.0.   The install went fine but I cannot access the vmware console on the
   IP of my ubuntu server on port 8222?    I know it's alive on my network as
   it accessed packages from the internet and I have a windows server file
   share mounted.    Any Idea's what to check?  Thanks
</p>

No expert - But is your firewall block port 8222 ?
</p>

<p>
You would need to allow incoming and outgoing to that port before 
you can access the console.  Other than that I have no idea ;)

Hey David. When you point your browser to &lt;ip&gt;:8222, can you access
that page? It asks for your login? Can you log in?
</p>

<p>
Wanting to know exactly what does not work - if i understood it right,
you manage to get into the vmware interface (so youre not blocked by a
firewall), but when you click to open the terminal, it doesnt work -
is that correct? If yes, whats the error? or it just hangs?
