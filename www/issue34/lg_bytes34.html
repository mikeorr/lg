Design by Contract
</H3>
<P>
Dr. Bertrand Meyer, designer of the Eiffel programming language, was in
Seattle to give his one day seminar on "Design by Contract". The purpose of
this workstation is teach software engineers this unique object-oriented
development method which emphasizes building reliable sytems through 
well-defined specifications and communication between the different parties
to the system.
<P> 
Talking to Dr. Meyer by phone, I asked him how Eiffel was better than Java.
He gave me three reasons:
<ul>
<li>Eiffel supports multiple inheritance.
<li>Eiffel more easily builds container structures such as lists, queues,
stacks and trees.
<li>Eiffel has built in support for "design by contract" development.
</ul>
When I asked him about Open Source and Linux, he replied, "Eiffel's primary library
was released as open source on August 4, and other libraries will be
released in the future. While Eiffel is a commercial product, we see the
advantages of Open Source. We were one of the first supporters of Linux,
and the Linux community is very important to us."

Debian and the NetWinder

It is now possible to boot the Corel NetWinder Computer with Debian

This alleviates the need for the chroot environment that previous 
development work was being conducted in, and allows work to progress even 
faster than before.  This will also allow more people to join in the

IBM Enhances its Websphere Application Server
</H3>
<P> 
IBM announced that it has extended the HTTP services in IBM WebSphere* 
Application Servers in the areas of performance, security and platform 
support by adding new functionality to the HTTP services that are packaged 
with WebSphere and are based on the Apache HTTP Server.
<p>
Today's announcements include technology developed by IBM Research
that boosts the performance of HTTP services in the IBM WebSphere
Application Server and Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) support that provides customers with the security necessary to
operate a web site that can handle sensitive information, such as financial
transactions. In addition, IBM announced a port of the Apache HTTP Server
to the AS/400* operating system.  The AS/400 port will be offered to the
Apache Group through the Open Source model.
     The Fast Response Cache Accelerator (FRCA) technology, developed by
IBM Research, doubles the performance of HTTP services in WebSphere on
Windows NT, according to lab tests done by SPEC (The Standard Performance
Evaluation Corporation). 
<P> 
     Both the FRCA and SSL technologies from IBM will be available at no
additional charge as part of all editions of the IBM WebSphere Application
Servers.  The technologies will be released in the next version of
WebSphere Application Server before the end of the year.  The FRCA
technology will also be used to boost the performance of the HTTP Server
for OS/390*, and will be available as part of OS/390 Version 2 Release 7 in
March of 1999.

Panorama
</H3>
<P> 
Panorama is part of the GNU project. For more information about it,
visit the URL 'http://www.gnu.org'. It is released under the GPL
license, that you can read in the file 'LICENSE' in this directory.
<p> 
Panorama is a framework for 3D graphics production. This will include
modeling, rendering, animating, post-processing, etc. Currently, there
is no support for animation, but this will be added soon.
<p>
Functionally, it is structured as an API, composed by two dynamic
libraries, and several plugins, that you can optionally load in runtime.
A simple console mode front-end for this API is included in the package,
that can load a scene description in one of the supported scene
languages, and then outputs a single image file in any of the supported
graphic formats.
<p>
Panorama can be easily extended with plugins. Plugins are simply
dynamically linked C++ classes. You can add plugins without
recompilation, and even in runtime, when this option is added to the
graphic interface.
<p>
You can find more information about Panorama, or download latest
distribution at: <a

Netscape Wrapper v2.0.0
</H3>
<P> 
What is it:<br>
The Netscape Wrapper is a bourne shell script used to invoke Netscape
on a Unix platform. It performs copying initial default files, a postscript
bug work around, security check, and setting up the environment. The new version
also provides enhanced functionality.
<p>
What is new in this version:<br>
<ul>
<li>Rewritten. Faster and cleaner execution.
<li>Fully sh. No longer relies on bash features.
<li>Root security check bypass.
<li>New options subset. (+news, +mail, ...)
<li>Defaults to opening a new window.
</ul> 
<p>
The most significant change is that the script will attempt to
open a new browser before executing Netscape. IE if no Netscape process
is present, Netscape will be executed, otherwise a new browser window is 
created. Likewise when using the new option subset, if Netscape is not
running, it will be execute with that option as the default window, or if 
Netscape is running, that option will be opened using the current process.

<P> 
Version 2.1.6 of the GNU plotting utilities (<B>plotutils</B>) package is now
available.  This release includes a significantly enhanced version of the
free C/C++ GNU libplot library for vector graphics, as well as seven
command-line utilities oriented toward data plotting (graph, plot,
tek2plot, plotfont, spline, ode, and double).  A 130-page manual in texinfo
format is included.
<p>
As of this release, GNU libplot can produce graphics files in Adobe
Illustrator format.  So you may now write C or C++ programs to draw vector
graphics that Illustrator can edit.  Also, the support for the free `idraw'
and `xfig' drawing editors has been enhanced.  For example, the file format
used by xfig 3.2 is now supported.

This is a new version of ProcMeter that has been re-written almost completely

It is now designed to be more user-friendly and customisable, the textual as
well as graphical outputs and the extra mouse options avilable are part of this.
It is perhaps now less of a system status monitor and more of a user information
display.  It can be configured to show the date and/or time instead of having a
clock and it can also monitor your e-mail inbox and act like biff.
<p>
The ProcMeter program itself is a framework on which a number of modules
(plugins) are loaded.  More modules can be written as required to perform more

PIKT
</H3>
<P> 
PIKT is a set of programs, scripts, data and configuration files for
administering networked workstations.  PIKT's primary purpose is to
monitor systems, report problems (usually by way of e-mail "alerts"),
and fix those problems when possible.  PIKT is not an end-user tool; it
is (for now) to be used by systems administrators only.
<p>
PIKT includes an embedded scripting language, approaching in sophistication
several of the other scripting languages, and introducing some new features
perhaps never seen before.
<p>
PIKT also employs a sophisticated, centrally managed, per-machine/OS
version control mechanism.  You can, setting aside the PIKT language,
even use it to version control your Perl, AWK, and shell scripts.  Or,
use it as a replacement for cron.
<p>
PIKT is freeware, distributed under the GNU copyleft.

Yard 4.04.03
</H3>
<P> 
YARD-SQL version 4.04.03 has been released. Until now, it is available
for Linux and SCO-UNIX and contains the following new features:
<p>
<ul>
<li>YARD-ESQLC now contains libsql and sqlnets as shared libraries.
The product YARD-ESQLC now contains libsql.a and sqlnets.a as shared 
objects too. The names are libsql.so and sqlnets.so
<li>The base address of dynamic SHM is choosen based on existing segments.
Until know the base address of dynamic SHM segments was determined by the
kernel (Parameter 0 in shmat()). Know this address is calculated from the
existing SHM segments, so that the complete SHM will have no gaps.
This behaviour can be switched off by setting the environment variable
YARD_NOCONSECSHM.
<li>The socket flag TCP_NODELAY is set for socket connections.
On some OS (eg. FreeBSD), setting TCP_NODELAY on the socket connection
between client and server dramatically improves performance. There should
be no negative effect by setting this flag. So it will now always be set.
It can be disabled by setting the environment variable YARD_NOTCPNODELAY 
to 1.
<li>The disk configuration of a DBS is stored in the DBS in addition to the 
cfgfile
<li>yardinit offers a new option -l for reducing logfiles.
If option -l is used when a DBS is switched from offline mode to main-
tenance mode, all logical logs are released instead of performing
a logical recovery. Though this jeopardizes logical consistency it is an
easy way for starting a DBS when all logical logs are filled up.
The correct way for starting such a DBS is to start yardinit -m on one
terminal and then start yardarch -l on another terminal for backing up
the logical logs while yardinit is waiting.
<li>Clients can use strings for inserting data into BLOBs
Until now, a BLOB structure (eg. in ESQLC) or an object type (in Java) had
to be used for inserting data into a BLOB/TEXT column. Now, Clients can 
use simple strings for that purpose. When the server runs in batch mode, a 
string will still be used as file name.
<li>and more....
</ul>

Applix Released Applixware 4.4.1 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows
Platforms
</H3>
<p>
Applix, Inc.   the release of Applixware 4.4.1 for the Linux platform as 
well as all major UNIX operating systems, Windows NT and Windows 95. 
This latest release delivers a new filtering framework that has been 
optimized for document interchange between Microsoft's Office 97 product, 
as well as Y2K compliance. 
<p>
Applixware includes Applix Words, Spreadsheets, Graphics, Presents, and HTML 
Author. This Linux version also includes Applix Data and Applix Builder as 
standard modules. Applixware for Linux is available directly from Applix, as 
well as from its partners, including Red Hat and S.U.S.E.
<p>
Linux version beta test users also attest to the results. "Export of Applix 
Words documents to Word 97 works great, even with Swedish letters," said Klaus 
Neumann, a university cognitive scientist. He continued, "I think Applixware 
is the most promising office solution for Linux. I've tried StarOffice, 
WordPerfect, Lyx. Nothing comes even close to Applixware--there are none of 
the memory, uptime, printing, or spell-checking problems I experience with the 
other suites."
<p>
Applixware 4.4.1 for Linux includes for the first time Applix Data, a new 
module offering point and click access to information stored in relational 
databases. No SQL knowledge is required to access the information. Once 
accessed, the data can be linked directly into Applix Words, Spreadsheets, 
Graphics, Presents, and HTML Author.

Crack dot Com is closing its doors
</H3>
<p>
WHY: Ran out of cash.
<p>
REALLY WHY: Lot of reasons, but then again, there are a lot of reasons
  that we got as far as we did.  I think the killer reason, though,
  was that Golgotha was compared by publishers primarily to Battlezone
  and Uprising, and those titles sold really poorly.
<p>
WHAT NOW?: Now we file articles of dissolution w/ the secretary of
  state, and we file bankruptcy.
<p>
IS THAT IT?!: No.
<p>
WHAT ELSE?: We're releasing the Golgotha source code, and data to the
public domain.
<p>
WHERE'S THE SOURCE CODE?: I want to personally thank everyone who
  supported & rooted for us.  That was really nice of you.
<p>
BLAH BLAH, WHERE'S THE SOURCE?: I want to apologize
to the fans and business partners we've let down.
<p>
BOO HOO! WE CARE. OUT WITH IT!: Thanks for your patience.  The source
& data can be found at <a
