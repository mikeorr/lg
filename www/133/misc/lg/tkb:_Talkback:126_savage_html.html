as to excuses I use for "THAT" OS, I usualy just say "what do you
expect? It's Mickey$hit Windblows.  And that is why I use Linux.".
</p>

<p>
I have actualy exclusivly used linux since '95.  Before that I used OS/2
Warp cause the "other" OS used broken cooperative multitasking, and that
was just a mess for my Fido-net BBS.

I agree that it's a great way to blow off steam and snark at people
using legacy OSes. Unfortunately, this does not encourage them to follow
your example; instead, they'll mentally pop you into a box marked "Just
Another Ranter" and ignore whatever you have to say. Game over in round
one.

If you want to actually <em>convince</em> people to switch to Linux instead of
suffering, you might want to consider other methods.

   Flaming, unfortunately, even the most witty, sarcastic flaming you can do,
   does not count as sales or as effective Linux advocacy. If you feel that
   flaming people who do stupid things is good for you or for them, please
   select a stupid habit other than not running Linux and flame people who do
   that.

Great Linux advocacy HOWTO, that one.

As I recall the initial impetus for my conversion to Linux, I'd been
trying to set up (on and off over a period of several months) a
company-wide email system in a Novell/Wind0ws environment, and failing
miserably due to the insanely-convoluted system configuration. I'd been
hearing various noises about "this Linux thing" on various lists, poked
my nose into <a href="http://debian.org">http://debian.org</a>, played around with it for a couple of
hours... and suddenly, almost by accident, had a fully-functional mail
server. I didn't know whether to dance in happiness or scream in
frustration over all the time I'd wasted.

Why deny yourself the use of option (n + 1): "All/None of the above"?
