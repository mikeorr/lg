<P>
As mentioned earlier, the DBMS architecture described in this 
article grew out of the demanding requirements for a system we
were contracted to develop.  That system is now the Mental Health 
Clinical Integrated Database (MHCID).  It allows clinicians
in the mental health sector in Calgary to share clinical data
about patients throughout all CRHA-sanctioned mental health clinics
and hospitals in the city.
<P>
The MHCID system presented us with these difficult requirements:
<UL>
<LI> Communication between the sites must be supported using modems, so 
   bandwidth was low (less than 30kb/s) and packet latency was high.
<LI> Patient clinical data is very confidential, so must be encrypted
   when transmitted across the telephone system.
<LI> User access to data must be strictly controlled, to support 
   ethical and organizational requirements.
<LI> The system must log all access to patient data.
<LI> There are hundreds of users - up to 15 simultaneously connected to the server.
<LI> Client workstations were already deployed before we started development
   (from a previous pilot project).  There was only a minimal
   budget for hardware upgrades.
<LI> The combined budget for software licenses, server equipment and
   development was relatively small.
