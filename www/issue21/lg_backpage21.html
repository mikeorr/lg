Gerd Bavendiek</H4>
Gerd has worked as a software engineer with various flavors of Unix since 1988.
In 
1994 he realized that using Linux could make his every-day work more
convenient.
Since that time he has used Linux and various GNU-software. He lives in Essen,
Germany. 
In his spare time he builds model-steam engines using real hardware: lathe,
milling-machine and a lot of hand tools.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">John Daily</H4>

John Daily works for BBN (or is that GTE?) as a systems
administrator/software
engineer. He spends far too much time in front of computers, but when
he's
not, he prefers to be outside riding his new bicycle, or otherwise
exploring
New England.

with many other flavors of Unix over the years, but his operating system

entering a Medical Informatics Fellowship. In his dwindling
free time he and his wife Faith enjoy hiking and camping in

Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.

<IMG ALIGN=CENTER ALT="" SRC="../gx/rose.gif">
My assistant, Amy Kukuk, did all the work again this month.
She's so good to me. Thank you, Amy.
<P>
Our beautiful new logo was designed by our very own Graphics Muse, Michael
J. Hammel. (He used The Gimp.) Thanks, Michael.
<P>
Well, this is the last issue that Amy and I will be working on. We are
turning over the editorship to Viki Navrotilova. Here's a bit about Viki:
<P> 
<B>Viktorie Navratilova has been using Linux for the past 4 years, and has
been active in both the Israeli and Chicago Linux Users' Groups.
She started using Linux because of its network capabilities, and then
stayed for the compilers. </B>
<P> 
I know Viki will have as much fun as we have and do a wonderful job. Show
your support and send her lots of articles.
<P> 
<I>LG</I> will remain under the guardianship of <I>Linux Journal</I> and
neither the web address or e-mail address will change. Articles from
<I>LG</I> will continue to appear in <I>LJ</I>.
 
<P> 
Have fun! Bye-Bye!
