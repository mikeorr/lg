<i>In additional to firewall rulesets, the /proc filesystem offers some significant 
enhancements to your network security settings. Unfortunately, most of us are 
unaware of anything beyond the vague rumors and advice we've heard about this 
beast. In this article, we'll review some of the basic essentials of the /proc/sys/net/ipv4 
filesystem necessary to add to the overall network security of your Linux server. 
</i> 

<p>Perhaps one of the more frequently neglected areas of firewall configuration 
  involves the /proc filesystem. The pseudo file structure within proc allows 
  you to interface with the internal data structures in the kernel, either obtaining 
  information about the system or changing specific settings. Some of the parts 
  of /proc are read-only, while others can be modified. It is often referred to 
  as a <i>virtual</i> filesystem in that it doesn't take up any actual hard drive 
  space; files are created only on demand when you access them. In this article, 
  we will be focusing specifically on /proc/sys/net/ipv4.</p>
<p> In order to benefit from the use of the /proc filesystem, you'll need to enable 
  two settings when building your kernel. CONFIG_PROC_FS is the setting that allows 
  you to access and view the /proc filesystem, and CONFIG_SYSCTL is the bit that 
  actually allows you to modify /proc entries without requiring a reboot of the 
  system or a recompile of the kernel. Settings are only available at boot time 
  after the /proc file system has been mounted. </p>
<h3>ICMP Specific Settings</h3>
<p>Ping scanning is typically used to determine which hosts on a network are up. 
  Typically this is done by sending ICMP ECHO request packets to the target host. 
  This is seemingly innocent behavior, however often network administrators will 
  block such traffic to increase their obscurity. The choices involve blocking 
  ICMP ECHO requests to broadcast/multicast addresses and directly to the host 
  itself. The respective commands to disable protection are:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts<br>
    echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>ICMP redirect messages can also be a pain. If your box is not acting as a router, 
  you'll probably want to disable them:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_redirects</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes you will come across routers that send out invalid responses to broadcast 
  frames. This is a violation of RFC 1122, &quot;Requirements for Internet Hosts 
  -- Communication Layers&quot;. As a result, these events are logged by the kernel. 
  To avoid filling up your logfile with unnecessary clutter, you can tell the 
  kernel not to issue these warnings:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_ignore_bogus_error_responses</code> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>IP Specific Settings</h3>
<p>Ironically, IP forwarding of packets between interfaces is enabled by default 
  on many systems in their startup scripts. If you're not intending for your box 
  to forward traffic between interfaces, or if you only have a single interface, 
  it would probably be a good idea to disable forwarding. Note that altering this 
  value resets all configuration parameters to their default values; specifically, 
  RFC1122 for hosts and RFC1812 for routers. As a result, you'll want to modify 
  this one before all other /proc settings.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>if [ -r /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward ]; then<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo &quot;Disabling IP forwarding&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward<br>
    fi </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If instead you decide to enable forwarding, you will also be able to modify 
  the rp_filter setting; something which is often misunderstood by network administrators. 
  The rp_filter can reject incoming packets if their source address doesn't match 
  the network interface that they're arriving on, which helps to prevent IP spoofing. 
  Turning this on, however, has its consequences: If your host has several IP 
  addresses on different interfaces, or if your single interface has multiple 
  IP addresses on it, you'll find that your kernel may end up rejecting valid 
  traffic.

You many want to consider using a virtual private network such as
    <a
href="http://business.att.com/enterprise/Family/network-services/ip-vpn">AT&amp;T VPN services</a> to further protect your network settings.

It's also important to note that even if you do not enable the rp_filter, 
  protection against broadcast spoofing is always on. Also, the protection it 
  provides is only against spoofed <i>internal</i> addresses; external addresses 
  can still be spoofed.. By default, it is disabled. To enable it, run the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>if [ -r /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter ]; then<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Enabling rp_filter"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/rp_filter<br>
    fi</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may have also noticed the &quot;all&quot; subdirectory in this last example. 
  In <code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf</code> there is one subdirectory for each interface 
  on your system along with one directory called &quot;all&quot;. Changing specific 
  interface directories only affects that specific interface, while changes made 
  to the &quot;all&quot; directory affects all interfaces on the system.</p>
<p> If you have compiled your kernel with CONFIG_SYNCOOKIES, you will be able 
  to <i>optionally</i> turn on or off protection against SYN flood attacks. Note 
  the emphasis, as compiling the kernel with this value does not enable it by 
  default. It works by sending out 'syncookies' when the syn backlog queue of 
  a socket overflows. What is often misunderstood is that socket backlogging is 
  not supported in newer operating systems, which means that your error messages 
  may not be correctly received by the offending system. Also, if you see synflood 
  warnings in your logs, make sure they are not the result of a heavily loaded 
  server before enabling this setting. They can also cause connection problems 
  for other hosts attempting to reach you. However, if you do want to enable this 
  setting, perform the following:<br>
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>if [ -r /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies ]; then<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Enabling tcp_syncookies"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies<br>
    fi</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally, a host has no control over the route any particular packet takes 
  beyond its first hop. It is up to the other hosts on the network to complete 
  the delivery. IP Source Routing (SRR) is a method of specifying the <i>exact</i> 
  path that a packet should take among the other hosts to get to its destination. 
  This is generally a bad idea for the security conscious, as someone could direct 
  packets to you through a trusted interface and effectively bypass your security 
  in some cases. A good example is traffic, such as SSH or telnet, that is blocked 
  on one interface might arrive on another of your host's interfaces if source 
  routing is used, which you might not have anticipated in your firewall settings. 
  You'll probably want to disable this setting with:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>if [ -r /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_source_route ]; then<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Disabling source routing"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo &quot;0&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/accept_source_route<br>
    fi </code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Packets that have source addresses with no known route are referred to as &quot;martians&quot;. 
  For example, if you have two different subnets plugged into the same hub, the 
  routers on each end will see each other as martians. To log such packets to 
  the kernel log, which should never show up in the first place, you'll need to 
  issue:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><code>if [ -r /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/log_martians</code><code> ]; then<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo "Enabling logging of martians"<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;echo &quot;1&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/all/log_martians</code><code><br>
    fi </code></p>
</blockquote>
