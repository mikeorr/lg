Hello everyone
</p>

<p>
I've come across a small annoyance lately when I try to boot my PC.
When it tries to load GRUB, it tells me: 
<pre>
GRUB Disk Error 
</pre>
I can boot, the livecd which I installed from (Freespire BTW) has a boot
from hda1 option that I find quite useful right now, so I can boot.
I've tried re-installing GRUB from the commandline, and from the GRUB
shell, but to no luck at all.  From the commandline, I get told that
(paraphrasing) the drive has no bios disk.
</p>

<p>
Any help would be appreciated.
</p>

Are you booting Windows as well?  if so boot from the XP install 
cd and run the rescue console.
</p>

<p>
Then type "fixboot" and "fixmbr" (no quotes) which will get rid 
of GRUB.
</p>

<p>
If not you should be able to fix it from the boot CD or your 
installed Linux.

Nope, I don't use windows much anymore.  I was looking for some way to
re-install grub, without needing to re-install Freespire, as I have just
recently gotten it configured they way I like it.  If I can't, not that
big of a deal, it'll just be an annoyance, as the CD, handy thing it is,
has a menu option to boot from HDA1, so I can get booted up.  Just a
couple of extra steps, that's all.
</p>

<p>
Any GRUB masters?  I've never had to manually install grub before, I've
only worked with LILO, which I don't have.

I've installed grub a few times. It's not very complicated.
</p>

<p>
I think 
</p>

<p>
<pre>
grub&gt; root (hd0,1)
grub&gt; setup (hd0)
</pre>
will do it, but I haven't done it in a while and it's possible I'm forgetting 
something. Don't forget to adjust the disk and partition numbers if 
necessary.

Here is the manual for GRUB on howto do it...  Explains it far 
better than I could ;)
</p>

<p>
Hope that helps!

The only problem with this approach is that you will now be unable to
boot Linux, which means that you'll have to boot some live distro (might
not be applicable in this case, but you'd better make sure you've got
one on hand otherwise!) and install a boot manager - perhaps GRUB - at
which point you'll have to deal with the original problem.
</p>

<p>
That seems like going around the long way for no purpose. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Yep. The first thing to look at - and, of course, the first thing that
Jonathan should have sent in - is the content of his GRUB configuration
and the output of 'displaymem' and 'geometry' GRUB commands. However, at
this point, the advice that he got from Neil should be sufficient to fix
the problem. If it's not, then it'll be time to come back here, to
checkpoint #1, and try again.
