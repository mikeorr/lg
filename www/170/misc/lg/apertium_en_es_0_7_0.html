&gt; I've just released en-es 0.7.0. I'm not a big fan of release notes, so
&gt; here's the changelog:
&gt;
&gt; Sat Dec  5 15:23:45 GMT 2009
&gt;
&gt;  * Release 0.7.0 ('More of an escape than a release')
&gt;  * Vastly improved handling of Anglo-Saxon genitive in transfer (Mireia)
&gt;  * 'Apostrophe genitive' (Jesus' etc.) in analysis
&gt;  * Pre-transfer processing of apostrophes/genitive (based on an idea by
&gt;    Jacob Nordfalk/Francis Tyers)
&gt;  * Greatly increased vocabulary (most notably, Paul "greenbreen" Breen)
&gt;
&gt; In addition, this version has some generation support for the two main
&gt; dialects of English, British and American, though this only currently
&gt; supports simple spelling differences for the moment ('favour' vs.
&gt; 'favor').
&gt;

<p>
Oh, and because I like to collect amusing translation errors, this
error from 0.6 is fixed in 0.7:
<pre>
0.6, es-&gt;en
'Fondo Monetario Internacional' -&gt; 'International Monetary bottom'
0.7, es-en
'Fondo Monetario Internacional' -&gt; 'International Monetary Fund'
</pre>

[grin] Spanish, for whatever reason, lends itself to this kind of thing.
Given the colloquial variations, the slang [1], and the homophones, it
can be quite entertaining... and gives Spanish speakers many reasons to
laugh when they hear someone learning their language.
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if I've told this story here before, that of a friend who
was married to a Puerto Rican woman. He went on vacation somewhere in
South America (I don't recall where) with her and his sister-in-law. His
wife caused a bit of a sensation when they were down at the beach and
she yelled to him to go get her sister - "agarre mi hermana!" "Agarrar",
you see, literally means 'to grab' - and is interpreted <em>quite</em>
differently in PR and wherever it was that they were vacationing...
</p>



<p>
[1] There should be some term that differentiates between the types of
slang that use new words for old meanings - e.g., "skag", "boodle", etc.
- and the types that use common words and assign new/additional meanings
to them. The second type in Spanish is very broad - much broader than
it is in English, in my opinion - and leads to much confusion,
particularly when speakers from different Hispanic cultures come
together.

Eh... not particularly, for the limited subset of Spanish that we work with.
</p>

<p>
Our English-Spanish module is aimed at 'general purpose' translation,
which more or less means 'things likely to appear in a newspaper' -
the same (mostly) goes for our other translation modules, though some
have 'dictionary variations', where we have a preprocessor that allows
us to build more domain-specific dictionaries as well as 'general
purpose'.
</p>

<p>
Homophones don't present much of a problem, as, in 'newspaper grade'
text, you can more or less assume that the editing staff have caught
any potential errors caused by such ambiguities. I've started to work
on speech-to-speech translation recently, but haven't encountered many
problems with Spanish (English, however, is extremely problematic).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I say 'not particularly' more so because I've also got
English-Italian and English-Portuguese slowly brewing, and both of
those languages have a similar set of problem areas (check out how
many meanings 'pasta' has in Italian <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">.

Heh. If you ever have a few years idle, studying slang always makes
for an interesting PhD thesis...
