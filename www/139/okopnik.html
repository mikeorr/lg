<h1>Installing Perl Modules as a Non-Root User</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
If you use Perl for anything more complex than the traditional (and boring)
generation of "Hello, World", then it's also likely that you're familiar
with those wonderful work-saving devices - Perl modules. Furthermore,
chances are that you're also familiar with CPAN, the <a
href="http://cpan.org/">Comprehensive Perl Archive Network</a>, and the
easy interface to it that is provided by the CPAN module. That all works
just great - assuming that you a) run a sensible modern OS like Linux, and
b) have root access to the machine you're using (or have a friendly and
cooperative sysadmin). But what if those assumptions don't hold true? What
if, for example, you have a shell account on a machine run by some
mega-corporation that doesn't feel like installing the
Foo::Bar::Zotz::Blagger-0.01 module in their /usr/lib/perl? I, for one,
can't blame them; a system-wide installation could open them up to unknown
bugs galore. When your interests and theirs conflict, you lose every time -
since they own the system.
</p>

<p>
So, what can we do if we really, really need that module but can't get it
installed on a system-wide basis? The answer is to install it elsewhere -
in some directory where you have write permissions.
</p>

<h3>Configuring the Environment</h3>

<p>
Clearly, if you're not root, you're not going to be able to save the files
to their default locations under '/usr/' - which is where they would
normally go.  Therefore, we need to tell Perl where to find the modules
that we'll install. Fortunately, this is the easy part: just decide on the
location where you'll install the modules, create that directory if it
doesn't already exist, append '/lib' to its name, and set the PERL5LIB
variable to that string. E.g., if you're using Bash, then edit your
~/.bash_profile and add the following:
</p>

<pre>
if [ -z "$PERL5LIB" ]
then
	# If PERL5LIB wasn't previously defined, set it...
	PERL5LIB=~/myperl/lib
else
	# ...otherwise, extend it.
	PERL5LIB=$PERL5LIB:~/myperl/lib
fi

MANPATH=$MANPATH:~/myperl/man

export PERL5LIB MANPATH
</pre>

<p>
Now, create the three necessary directories:
</p>

<pre>
mkdir -p ~/myperl/lib
mkdir -p ~/myperl/man/man{1,3}
</pre>

<p>
After you've logged out and back in, Perl will treat that location as a
part of @INC (the list of directories to search for libraries and modules.)
If you want to confirm that it's actually happened, just execute the
following and use your directory name as the argument to 'grep':
</p>

<pre>
perl -wle'print for grep /myperl/, @INC'
</pre>

<h3>Installing the Modules</h3>

<pre>
perl -MCPAN -we 'shell'
</pre>

<p>
First, you'll need to configure the CPAN module. If you've never done this,
it's really simple; just execute the above at your command line, and you're
on your way. Some people have referred to it as a "pecking chicken" install
(that is, if you set a chicken over the 'Enter' key and it then keeps
pecking at the key, it'll get through the installation successfully). For
our purposes, however, we need to make two small modifications to the
standard procedure: when the script asks you for any extra arguments for
Makefile.PL, you need to supply it with the following list (assuming that
you chose '~/myperl' as your private lib directory):
</p>  

<pre>
LIB=~/myperl/lib INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR=~/myperl/man/man1 INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR=~/myperl/man/man3
</pre>

<p>
You also need to make sure that the UNINST parameter is turned off; you can
do this by setting 'UNINST=0' when that question comes up during the
installation. (This is the default behavior unless you set it, but you
might as well make sure.)
</p>

<p>
If you had already configured the CPAN shell at some point in the past, you
simply need to modify the configuration. Again, start the shell as above,
and issue the following commands at the "cpan&gt; " prompt:
</p>

<p>
``
o conf makepl_arg "LIB=~/myperl/lib INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR=~/myperl/man/man1 INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR=~/myperl/man/man3"
o conf make_install_arg UNINST=0
o conf commit
''
</p>

<p>
and you're done. From this point forward, using the CPAN shell (or any of
the other CPAN functions and methods) should work just like usual:
</p>

<pre>
# Invoke the shell
perl -MCPAN -we shell

# Install the Net::FTP module
perl -MCPAN -we 'install "Net::FTP"'

# Update all outdated modules on this system
perl -MCPAN -we 'CPAN::Shell-&gt;install(CPAN::Shell-&gt;r)'
</pre>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Both the CPAN module and its documentation - which are, incidentally,
included as part of the standard Perl installation - have always been good,
but they've become even better in the recent years. If you have not taken
the time to become familiar with them, you should do so, since the end result
will be a great savings in time and effort. The CPAN itself should also be
your first stop before you embark on any complex project - I've wasted many
an hour trying to accomplish some task only to find out later (or part-way
through the project, if I was lucky) that a module to perform that task
already exists. Give it a shot - and happy hacking!

<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.
</em>
</p>

<p>

His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.

He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
