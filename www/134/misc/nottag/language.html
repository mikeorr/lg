<p>Hi...</p>
<pre>
&gt; bagai mana cara membuka program memakai linux
</pre>
<p>Please use English as this is an international forum. Anyway,
about your question, it really depends on what you mean with
"membuka". Do you mean, how to execute the program in Linux? If
yes, simply type the program's name in the shell or your X desktop
environment "Run" menu. If it isn't on search PATH, then please
type a complete path, e.g /usr/local/bin/blah instead of just
typing "blah".</p>
<p>But if you mean "membuka" is somekind of interrogating the
internal of the program (doing disassembling?) perhaps you need a
tool like "hexdump" and/or objdump.</p>
<p>Finally, if the program is Windows based, try to read about Wine
and how it can help you to run Windows based program on top of
Linux. Do pay attention that not every Windows program works
smoothly on Linux.</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>Mulyadi</p>

in Bahasa Indonesia, and Mulyadi gave a knowledgeable, expert, and

<p>Mr Okopnik, Rick, thank you for the comment <img src=
"../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /> Actually, I was hoping the original
poster asked that in English, so it could gather more response (
and I bet one of them would be "please elaborate" <img src=
"../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" />) ). So, as native Indonesian speaking
human being, I try to step forward. But please, don't make TAG as
Melayu speaking forum, just keep it as is (English forum).</p>

<p>[laugh] Don't worry; as much as I enjoy learning languages, I
don't think that fluency in Melayu is ever going to be a
requirement for joining TAG. However, it's nice to know that we can
at least recognize and field questions coming from a variety of
other languages.</p>
<p>Hmm, this brings up an interesting point. Gang, what languages
<em>can</em> we understand here, enough to parse a technical
question for a reply in English, or at least to translate well
enough that someone else can do so? Let's make a list.</p>

<p>Ah, but I <em>can</em> understand Glaswegian, Geordie, Scouse
and Cockney.</p>
<p>Although, Cockney does have the remarkable ability to make my
teeth itch. Funny.</p>
<p>I learnt both Glaswegian and Geordie by immersing myself in the
local culture - going to the pub and staying there for two weeks at
a time. I am amazingly receptive to new languages whilst drunk. I
learnt most of the little German I have in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Sadly, I have to get into a similar state to be fluent again, I
enter a sort of 'fugue' state on ther narrow border between
sentience and insensibility. At that point I can converse with
almost anyone. The only real drawback is that when I wake up I lose
the ability to talk to anyone for a couple of days. That and a
blinding headache.</p>

<p>I was once in Scotland for Hogmanay. Inadvertantly, I let slip

Apparently I did quite well, I managed to taste each and every
whiskey in the house before I fell off my chair. My friends dad
worked in a distillery and collected malt whiskey as a hobby. As
did all his friends. To add to the injury I was inflicting on my
liver, kidneys and brain I was expected to go 'First Footing' due
to my dark hair (now sadly departed), naturally this meant toasting
the health of the household with a wee drop of whiskey. The Scots
have a marvelous knack for understatement. My friends dad was known
to most of the estate, and almost all of them wanted to see the

<p>Aye, they do, a bit -- and a dry sense of humour recognisably
akin to my own Scandinavian cultural antecedents. I felt right at
home.</p>
<p>Locally here in California (or 'KAH-lee-fohrn-ya' as Der

(no relation), who used to display that sort of arid wit, every
morning. I remember one of his anecdotes -- which, alas, is best

homonym:</p>
<p>A fellow is released from San Francisco County Jail in San
Bruno, realises he's flat broke, and starts walking through the
suburbs seeking to earn a bit of spending money. Reaching the
affluent town of Hillsborough, he notices a matron trimming roses
in her front yard, and says, 'Ma'am, I'm looking to do some light
work. Do you have any yard or maintenance jobs that need doing?'
She tips her hat, sizes him up, thinks for a moment, and nods,
pointing:</p>
<p>'If you walk down the driveway next to the garage, you'll find a
couple of cans of green housepaint, and a brush. If you can paint
the porch by lunch time, there's $50 in it for you.' 'Ma'am, you
got yourself a deal.'</p>
<p>Half an hour later, she's surprised to see him walking back. 'Is
there a problem?' 'No, ma'am; the job's all done. But I have to
tell you; that's no Porsche, that's a Ferrari.'</p>

<p>The problem I have with Indian language support on computers is
the number of complicated issues that are tangled up:</p>

provide a uniform way of converting the languages to/from ascii
encoding but this has not been universally adopted as it is not
easy to read.</p>
<p>2. The Indian type-writer style keyboard is WYSIWYG and a number
of people are still being trained in it. This means that letters
are sometimes entered in the (logically) wrong order (see 4).</p>
<p>3. There are still some numerous character encodings floating
around without standardisation. Unicode is not uniformly
adopted.</p>
<p>4. We have to deal with multi-byte, multi-width characters that
have "ligatures" or single glyphs associated with a sequence of
characters. In these glyphs the identifiable portion the characters
may appear "out of sequence".</p>
<p>Strangely, there <strong>is</strong> a similar problem---typing
mathematics by e-mail. TeX/LaTeX is the "itrans" style solution
which is applicable for producing printed documents but too heavy
for e-mail.</p>
<p>People (naturally) have created a hack^H^H^H^Hsolution.</p>
<p>Mathematicians type e-mails in "pseudo-Tex" and Indians type
e-mails in "pseudo-itrans".</p>
<p>Like so:</p>
<pre class="code">
        So you see that Wiles and Taylor finally managed to prove that
        x^n+y^n=z^n has no solutions in positive integers unless xyz=0

Indian language support on computers---from a distance <img src=

work of importance to large numbers of people; so they are getting

<p>Mind you, the sum total of living aboard <em>is</em> pretty damn
wonderful - but it's far, far away from the picture painted by the

<p>Well... "drunk" is a universal language. I made friends in
Spain, though I spoke almost no Spanish and they spoke almost no

like, I knew nowhere near enough to have a proper conversation... I

<p>A really good communicator should be able to get a point across
- perhaps with some loss of nuance, but the majority of it intact -
by hand signals (assuming the other party is willing to try.)
Knowing the other person's language - and perhaps more importantly,
their specific idiom - is a huge plus, but lacking it is not a
total disaster. I've sailed into a number of places where I knew
very little about the country and the people (guidebooks don't tell
you much as compared to personal experience), but invariably,
shortly after landing, I'd be engaged in something resembling a
conversation - with lots of laughter on both sides, plenty of
pointing at things, and always some good and useful result.</p>

Denise, whom my gf and I had helped out of a bad spot (towed them
out of the main ship channel - their sails were blown out by a
gale, and their engine had just quit.) About a week later, when we
were all sitting in their cockpit and talking, J-L and I noticed
the two women staring at us in fascination - it seems that we had
been talking a high-speed mix of English, French, Spanish, and
German (mostly English and Spanish on my side, French and German on
his, and ~10% crossover) - and we understood each other just fine,
while they had not the slightest clue of what the hell we were
saying. That was an amusing moment.</p>

&gt; I've read and have been told that chinese people have well over 12 
&gt; different smiles, some of which express contempt or embarrassment. [No 
&gt; personal experience]
</pre>
<p>No idea - although many similar things I've heard about other
languages (fifty Eskimo words for snow, five (or seven or twelve)
ways to say 'thank you' in Japanese all of which convey different
degreed of resentment, etc.) have all turned out to be false. It
sounds like an urban legend, particularly since smiles are highly
individual anyway.</p>
<pre>
&gt; Be aware of the spanish, they have the strange habit to make a nodding 
&gt; movement with their head which means no.
</pre>
My favorite is the Korean hand gesture for "come closer"; the
palm-up beckoning motion is used only for animals, while humans get
the palm-down version with a quick whisk-broom action.<br />

<p>Heh. With those of my Polish friends who speak better English
than Polish, I normally speak only in English; with those who don't
speak nearly as much English as I do Polish, I speak with only in
Polish; the part that baffles my Irish friends, though, is when I
speak to people who speak English at roughly the same level as I do
Polish - I speak in English, they in Polish <img src=
"../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>
<p>Though I did have a similar, 4 language conversation once - at
6am at work, with a Russian truck driver who was working for a
German company. In a bastard mix of English, Russian, Polish, and
German, I managed to teach him enough English to be able to do his
job without as much reliance on hand gestures <img src=
"../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /> (Oh, and he'd originally only wanted
to ask for a cigarette <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /></p>

<p>I'm from basque country and just shamed that you do more euskera
than I can with russian I'm quite unplugged from the net and only
get to connect from time to time so I always seem to catch the

the shadow commands, options and posibilities that often came up

<p>I guess I should be ashamed once per each language that I don't
speak, then. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /> I suggest that
we both skip the 'ashamed' idea and just enjoy what we've got while

<p>I'm not really sure what that describes... but welcome, anyway.
There are many threads that go on for a while, and always a
question or two that may not get answered because we don't have
anyone who knows about that specific issue. Delays in answering are
not a big deal - having someone who knows yet another piece of
Linux is.</p>
