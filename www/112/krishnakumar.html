<h1>Experiments with the Linux Kernel: Process Segments</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/krishnakumar.html">R. Krishnakumar</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3><a name="s1" id="s1">1. Introduction</a>
</h3>

<p>Traditionally, a Unix process is divided into segments. The
standard segments are code segment, data segment, BSS (block
started by symbol), and stack segment.</p>

<p>The code segment contains the binary code of the program which
is running as the process (a "process" is a program in execution).
The data segment contains the initialized global variables and data
structures. The BSS segment contains the uninitialized global data
structures and finally, the stack segment contains the local
variables, return addresses, etc. for the particular process.</p>

<p>Under Linux, a process can execute in two modes - <em>user
mode</em> and <em>kernel mode</em>. A process usually executes in
user mode, but can switch to kernel mode by making system calls.
When a process makes a system call, the kernel takes control and
does the requested service on behalf of the process. The process is
said to be running in kernel mode during this time. When a process
is running in user mode, it is said to be "in userland" and when it
is running in kernel mode it is said to be "in kernel space". We
will first have a look at how the process segments are dealt with
in userland and then take a look at the bookkeeping on process
segments done in kernel space.</p>

<h3><a name="s2" id="s2">2. Userland's view of the segments</a>
</h3>

<p>The code segment consists of the code - the actual executable
program. The code of all the functions we write in the program
resides in this segment. The addresses of the functions will give
us an idea where the code segment is. If we have a function
<code>foo()</code> and let <code>x</code> be the address of
<code>foo</code> (<code>x = &amp;foo;</code>). we know that
<code>x</code> will point within the code segment.</p>

<p>The Data segment consists of the initialized global variables of
a program. The Operating system needs to know what values are used
to initialize the global variables. The initialized variables are
kept in the data segment. To get the address of the data segment we
declare a global variable and then print out its address. This
address must be inside the data segment.</p>

<p>The BSS consists of the uninitialized global variables of a
process. To get an address which occurs inside the BSS, we declare
an uninitialized global variable, then print its address.</p>

<p>The automatic variables (or local variables) will be allocated
on the stack, so printing out the addresses of local variables will
provide us with the addresses within the stack segment.</p>

<h3><a name="s3" id="s3">3. A C program</a>
</h3>
<!-- 20050220 dsrich - Copied program out, compiled and ran, made compilable print_segments.c.txt file and linked -->

<p>Let's have a look at the following <a href=
"misc/krishnakumar/print_segments.c.txt">C program</a>:</p>

<pre class="code">
 1 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 2 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 3 #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
 4 #include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
 5
 6 int our_init_data = 30;
 7 int our_noinit_data;
 8
 9 void our_prints(void)
10 {
11         int our_local_data = 1;
12         printf("\nPid of the process is = %d", getpid());
13         printf("\nAddresses which fall into:");
14         printf("\n 1) Data  segment = %p",
15                 &amp;our_init_data);
16         printf("\n 2) BSS   segment = %p",
17                 &amp;our_noinit_data);
18         printf("\n 3) Code  segment = %p",
19                 &amp;our_prints);
20         printf("\n 4) Stack segment = %p\n",
21                 &amp;our_local_data);
22
23         while(1);
24 }
25
26 int main()
27 {
28         our_prints();
29         return 0;
30 }
</pre>
We can see that lines 6 and 7 declare two global variables. One is
initialized and one is uninitialized. Per the previous discussion,
the initialized variable will fall into the data segment and the
uninitialized variable will fall into the BSS segment. Lines 14-17
print the addresses of the variables.

<p>We also know that the address of the function
<code>our_prints</code> will fall into the code segment, so that if
we print the address of this function, we will get a value which
falls into the code segment. This is done in lines 18-19.</p>

<p>Finally we print the address of a local variable. This automatic
variable's address will be within the stack segment.</p>

<h3><a name="s4" id="s4">4. Execution of a userland program</a>
</h3>

<p>When we execute a userland program, similar to the one given
above, what happens is that the shell will <code>fork()</code> and
<code>exec()</code> the new program. The <code>exec()</code> code
inside the kernel will figure out what format the binary is in
(<em>ELF</em>, <em>a.out</em>, etc.) and will call the
corresponding handler for that format. For example when an ELF
format file is loaded, the function <code>load_elf_binary()</code>
from <code>fs/binfmt_elf.c</code> takes care of initializing the
kernel data structures for the particular process. Details of this
portion of loading will not be dealt with here, as that in itself
is a topic for another article :-) The point here is that the code
which loads the executable into the kernel fills in the kernel
data structures.</p>

<h3><a name="s5" id="s5">5. Memory-related data structures in the
kernel</a>
</h3>

<p>In the Linux kernel, every process has an associated
<code>struct task_struct</code>. The definition of this struct is
in the header file <code>include/linux/sched.h</code>. The
following snippet is from the 2.6.10 Linux kernel source code (only
the needed fields and a few nearby fields are shown):</p>

<pre class="code">
struct task_struct {
        volatile long state;    /* -1 unrunnable, 0 runnable, &gt;0 stopped */
        struct thread_info *thread_info;
        atomic_t usage;
        ...
        ...
        ...
        struct mm_struct *mm, *active_mm;
        ...
        ...
        ...
        pid_t pid;
        ...
        ...
        ...
        char comm[16];
        ...
        ...
};
</pre>
Three members of the data structure are relevant to us:

<ol>
<li><code>pid</code> contains the Process ID of the process.</li>

<li><code>comm</code> holds the name of the process.</li>

<li>The <code>mm_struct</code> within the <code>task_struct</code>
is the key to all memory management activities related to the
process.</li>
</ol>
The <code>mm_struct</code> is defined in
<code>include/linux/sched.h</code> as:

<pre class="code">
struct mm_struct {
        struct vm_area_struct * mmap;           /* list of VMAs */
        struct rb_root mm_rb;
        struct vm_area_struct * mmap_cache;     /* last find_vma result */
        ...
        ...
        ...
        unsigned long start_code, end_code, start_data, end_data;
        unsigned long start_brk, brk, start_stack;
        ...
        ...
        ...
};
</pre>
Here the first member of importance is the <code>mmap</code>. The
<code>mmap</code> contains the pointer to the list of VMAs (Virtual
Memory Areas) related to this process. Full usage of the process
address space occurs very rarely. The sparse regions used are
denoted by VMAs. So each VMA will contain information about a
single region. The VMAs are stored in <code>struct
vm_area_struct</code> defined in <code>linux/mm.h</code>:

<pre class="code">
struct vm_area_struct {
        struct mm_struct * vm_mm;       /* The address space we belong to. */
        unsigned long vm_start;         /* Our start address within vm_mm. */
        unsigned long vm_end;           /* The first byte after our end address
                                           within vm_mm. */
        ....
        ....
        ....
        /* linked list of VM areas per task, sorted by address */
        struct vm_area_struct *vm_next;
        ....
        ....
}
</pre>
<!-- 20050220 dsrich Commented out the following paragraph, rewrote the start of the next section as segue -->
<!-- Those were the basics of the memory data structures we needed to 
get hold of, to progress further into the article. -->

<h3><a name="s6" id="s6">6. Kernel's view of the segments</a>
</h3>

<p>The kernel keeps track of the segments which have been allocated
to a particular process using the above structures. For each
segment, the kernel allocates a VMA. It keeps track of these
segments in the <code>mm_struct</code> structures.</p>

<p>The kernel tracks the data segment using two variables:
<code>start_data</code> and <code>end_data</code>. The code segment
boundaries are in the <code>start_code</code> and
<code>end_code</code> variables. The stack segment is covered by
the single variable <code>start_stack</code>. There is no special
variable to keep track of the BSS segment &mdash; the VMA
corresponding to the BSS accounts for it.</p>

<p>The module accepts the pid of the process, which it should
dissect, as its parameter (line 48). The module will go through the
list of processes in the kernel (32-37), and when it finds the
required pid, it will call the function '<code>print_mem</code>'
function which will print the details from the memory management
related data structures of the kernel.</p>

<h3><a name="s8" id="s8">8. Let us get into execution mode</a>
</h3>

<p>I ran the C program given in the earlier section and, while it was still
running, loaded the kernel module with the pid of the process. Please note
that the program was compiled<em>statically</em> (-static) rather than
<em>dynamically</em>, to avoid the unnecessary complication of shared
libraries. Here is what I got:</p>

<pre class="code">
# ./print_segments &amp;
Pid of the process is = 3283
Addresses which fall into:
 1) Data  segment = 0x80a000c
 2) BSS   segment = 0x80a1a10
 3) Code  segment = 0x80481f4
 4) Stack segment = 0xbffff8e4

# /sbin/insmod print_kern_ds.ko pid_mem=3283

Got the process id to look up as 3283.
print_segments[3283]

This mm_struct has 5 vmas.

Vma number 1:
  Starts at 0x8048000, Ends at 0x80a0000

Vma number 2:
  Starts at 0x80a0000, Ends at 0x80a1000

Vma number 3:
  Starts at 0x80a1000, Ends at 0x80c3000

Vma number 4:
  Starts at 0xb7fff000, Ends at 0xb8000000

Vma number 5:
  Starts at 0xbffff000, Ends at 0xc0000000

Code  Segment start = 0x8048000, end = 0x809fc38
Data  Segment start = 0x80a0000, end = 0x80a0ec4
Stack Segment start = 0xbffffb30
</pre>

Let's analyze the output. According to the userland program the
address 0x80a000c should fall into the data segment. This can be
verified by looking into the information we got from the kernel
module, on printing the Data segment starting address and VMA
number 2. For the code segment, it is starting at 0x8048000 as per
the kernel data structures. Also according to the userland program
the address 0x80481f4 should fall into the code segment. Hence
userland and kernel tallies.

<p>Now, lets look at the Stack segment: the userland program says that the
address 0xbffff8e4 should fall into it and kernel data structures states
that stack will start from 0xbffffb30. In a 386-based architecture the
stack grows downwards. The BSS is not stored in any particular variable of
the kernel, but there is a VMA allocated for the corresponding location
- from the userland program, the address 0x80a1a10 should come inside the
BSS, and a look at VMA 3 makes it clear that this is the corresponding
VMA for the BSS.</p>

<h3><a name="s9" id="s9">9. Gathering Information from /proc</a>
</h3>

<p>We have been using custom programs to explore the contents of the data
structures inside the kernel, but the kernel provides a standard interface
for us to access such information. The memory maps of a particular process
can be obtained by doing a '<code>cat
/proc/<em>&lt;pid&gt;</em>/maps</code>' where <em>&lt;pid&gt;</em> should
be the pid of the process of which we need to get the details about. When I
ran it, the program used pid 3283; here is the memory map, trimmed to
fit:</p>

<pre class="code">
# cat /proc/3283/maps | cut -f1 -d' '
08048000-080a0000
080a0000-080a1000
080a1000-080c3000
b7fff000-b8000000
bffff000-c0000000
ffffe000-fffff000
</pre>
A close look at the output shows that the first region corresponds
to the code segment, the second region matches the data segment,
the third is the BSS segment and the 5th region corresponds to the
stack segment.

<h3><a name="s10" id="s10">10. Conclusion</a>
</h3>

<p>We have looked at the userland perspective of how the segments
are treated for a program. Then we examined the data structures in
the kernel which keep track of the segments. We verified that our
assumptions are correct using userland and kernel programs. Finally
we used the standard kernel interface to obtain information
regarding the memory regions of a specific process.</p>
