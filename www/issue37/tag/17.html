Great article.  I'm in the middle of teaching a TCP/IP class and
would have loved to use your article the past two days when we
were going over subnetting.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
May I have your permission to make copies and pass the article out
to my class?

All of my columns in the Linux Gazette are covered
under the LDP variant of the GPL.  That does allow
for free distribution and use.

You are welcome to use it however you like.  Leaving
my name associated with it would be appreciated.
Then people know who to blame

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'll be using a (hopefully improved) version of
this article in my book.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note:   Please also look for the article on
"proxyarp" --- this is a related subject that your
students should also understand.  Some of those
concepts actually support the subnetting and routing
discussion by providing a contrast and comparison.
(As in: "Here's another way it can be done.")
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

and now, for my question: you referenced RFC1918 and "private
network addresses".  I know about them, I follow them, etc. but
only because they are an RFC.  I mentioned private network
addresses to a buddy of mine and he brought up the point of "Why
bother?  With proxies, etc., you can have any address(es) you
want, so it doesn't matter which address(es) you choose."  I can't
think of a reason to refute him.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, <EM>is</EM> there a reason for choosing 192.168.x.x as opposed to
using the Post Office's 56.*.*.* for my internal network that no
one ever sees? (Yes, I know they're different classes; that's
irrelevant 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
By an odd coincidence I've done some consulting for the
USPS so I am familiar with the fact that they use
proxying to "hide" their 56.*.*.* network from the
rest of the world.  I suspect that about half of the
class A addresses that have been delegated are
similarly sequestered.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It would be nice if these organizations returned their
IP addresses (exchanged them for smaller address
blocks to accomodate their publicly accessible services,
routers and proxy hosts).  In the case of the USPS there
are several Class C addresses that are used by the
organization for their web sites et al.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, the reason for the RFC is to prevent routing
ambiguities.  If the USPS decided to use some of their
56.* addresses for their websites, routers, etc ---
and you needed to access those --- your router wouldn't
have any way to know where to send these packets.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, if everyone uses the same RFC1918 addresses
and we start trying to connect to one another over
VPN's then we have to do some weird "bi-directional"
masquerading and NAT (network address translation) to
turn your 10.*.*.* addresses into <EM>my</EM> 10.*.*.* addresses
and vice versa.  (This is not merely a theoretical problem
--- a frient of my, has mentioned that he needs to
employ these techniques now).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, the short answer is: you can do it --- but you'll
probably get bitten.  There's no guarantee that the
organization who's "hidden" addresses you try to use
will continue to keep those addresses "hidden".  It
shouldn't ever concern any other hosts beyond your
masquerading/NAT routers and proxy gateways --- so
long as you don't "leak" packets with these bogus
source addresses.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This sort of "leakage" is probably the most obvious
reason to use the RFC1918 addresses.  Any router
on the net can be configure to drop those packets
when any of use accidentally allow them to leak.  This
is good for the whole Internet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hope that helps.
