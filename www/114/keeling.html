<h1>Lock It Down With Arno's iptables-firewall</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/keeling.html">S. Keeling</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>This describes my experiences in transitioning from a homebuilt iptables
firewall script<a href="#ii"><sup>ii</sup></a> to &quot;Arno's iptables-firewall&quot; (AIF)<a href="#v"><sup>v</sup></a>, from
Arno van Amersfoort (<img src="misc/keeling/arnova.png">).  AIF can produce
a robust iptables based firewall, even when wielded by a relative newcomer
to iptables firewalls.  The time between reading the documentation and
dropping it into place could be as little as an hour.

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>AIF is described in Arno's README as &quot;Arno's iptables firewall
- Single- &amp; multi-homed firewall script with DSL/ADSL
support&quot;.  It is (C) Copyright 2001-2005 by Arno van Amersfoort.
It's free software, licenced under the GNU General Public License.

<p>If you decide you want to try using this, I <b>strongly</b>
recommend you READ THE FAQ on Arno's website, especially if you join
the mailing list in hope of support.  Arno points out in there that if
you haven't done so, your pleas for assistance will be cheerfully
ignored until you do.

<p>Of course, considering this is the Twenty-first Century:

<pre class="code">
  I AM NOT ADVISING YOU TO DO THIS!  IF YOU DO THIS AND IT BREAKS
  SOMETHING, YOU GET TO KEEP BOTH PIECES.  I EXPRESSLY, AND
  VIGOROUSLY, DENY ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY NEGATIVE RESULTS YOU OR
  ANYONE ELSE MAY SUFFER FROM YOUR HAVING DONE THIS.  THE FOLLOWING IS
  WRITTEN FOR ITS ENTERTAINMENT VALUE ONLY!  TELL YOUR MOTHER YOU'RE
  ABOUT TO DO THIS PRIOR TO DOING IT. 
</pre>

<p>[fscking lawyers (no, that's not a typo)...  Sorry for shouting.]

<p><b>When I started writing this, I was working with version
1.8.2</b>, which is apparently over a year old.  At Arno's suggestion,
I've since upgraded to the latest release, version 1.8.3-RC3 (April 9,
2005).  So, if I've missed anything important in updating this, that's
why it may appear confused.  Certain example listings were left alone,
but I've tried to cover the important bits of the latest version.

<p>Some of Arno's comments on my original article are as follows:

<em>
<pre class="code">
   Thanks for the article. I like it a lot.
   
   May I suggest to have a look at the latest 1.8.3RC3 (instead of 1.8.2a
   stable, which is over 1 year old)? It has a lot (and I mean A LOT)
   [of] improvements like:
<ul>
  <li>80-character long README &amp; config file (one of your bothers).
    Furthermore the config file layout is improved a lot. 
  <li>DMZ support (ie. to shield WiFi nets).
  <li>Multiple external (internet) interfaces.
  <li>Multiroute NAT (for load balancing internet connections).
  <li>MAC address filtering.
  <li>Full (transparent) proxy support.
  <li>The execute bit isn't set anymore on this version's config file
    either. ;-)
  <li><strong>...and...</strong>
  <li>version <code>1.8.4-stable</code>, with even more improvements, will
  be out soon.
</ul>
</pre>
</em>

<p>Nice guy, that Arno.  When I started on this, I (mis)corrected his
usage of &quot;DRDOS&quot; to &quot;DDoS&quot; (or &quot;Distributed
Denial of Service&quot;<a href="#xi"><sup>xi</sup></a>), and that was the wrong thing to do.  He
actually means &quot;Distributed Reflection Denial Of Service&quot;,
something I'd never heard of. I took his advice. For me, just
getting config files with eighty character long lines is a terrific
improvement.

<p><b>Many thanks to the helpful and patient staff at LG</b> for all
their support in producing this article, and the same to Arno van
Amersfoort for having made any of it possible.

<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>My situation is this (which is not to suggest you need to be doing
something similar):

  <ul>

    <li>I run a personal workstation (laptop) with Debian
    &quot;stable&quot;<a href="#ix"><sup>ix</sup></a> loaded on it.</li>

    <li>The lion's share of my connectivity is done via dialup, connected
    to my ISP.</li>

    <li>I do connect up to other machines locally (friends, work, family),
    via ethernet (and a four-port hub or crossover cable).</li>

    <li>I prefer to remove firewall functionality (take it down) when no
    interfaces are up.  Similarly, I see no point in starting the
    firewall at boot time when there's no interfaces up.  I like my
    firewall to be started either when pppd starts, or when ethN is
    configured.  When they're taken down, the firewall should go
    down.</li>

    <li>I run some local services which traditionally would be exploited by
    black hats:

    <ul>

      <li>identd: fauxident.py<a href="#iii"><sup>iii</sup></a> produces just enough identd-ish
        information to placate the CVS servers I've dealt with.</li>

      <li>MaraDNS<a href="#iv"><sup>iv</sup></a>: A caching-only nameserver.</li>

      <li>ssh: When connecting locally to other machines, I allow sshd
        to run, accepting logins.</li>

      <li>email: Popped by fetchmail.  Outgoing is via exim.</li>

      <li>chrony: An NTP daemon which connects up to [012].pool.ntp.org
        to manage system time.</li>

    </ul>

  </ul>

<p>Previously, I'd used a handcrafted set of iptables commands which
pretty much ruthlessly, and blindly, locked everything out through
sheer brute force.  Anything the firewall saw that wasn't connected to
an ESTABLISHED or RELATED IP process previously initiated by my
actions, was simply logged and dropped.

<p>This is generally not difficult to do, but at times, it is.  How to
let NTP servers' replies back in?  I struggled with that for months.
Googling for help on that produced so many conflicting examples (some
of which worked, some not), it was infuriating.  I was always on the
lookout for an alternative.  I wanted something somewhat like my
existing setup, but more robust, more suspicious, more dynamic, and
smarter overall about networking than I am.

<p>Over the years, I've tried things others suggested, but they always
seemed a bit wrong.  I don't want the thing to fire up an X Window GUI
forcing me to point and click my way through the configuration.  If I
<em>already</em> knew everything there was to know about TCP/IP and
networking, that might be helpful, but I don't.  Besides, that's just
not how I do things.  I want something with few moving parts, all of
which have their own home directories, and which can be expected to
stay there.  I don't want the thing to fail some morning because
somebody changed some obscure library I'd never heard of<a href="#vi"><sup>vi</sup></a>.

<p>On &quot;Sun Jan 9 12:18:45 MST 2005&quot;<a href="#i"><sup>i</sup></a>, I found mention of
&quot;Arno's iptables-firewall&quot; (AIF).  Now that I've finally
taken some time to get it working and try it out, I'm happy to say
it appears to be just what I was looking for.  Arno's system is
intended for far more complicated setups than my own (for instance, it
supports NAT and VPNs), but it easily scales down to my needs.  It
thinks of an external (connected to the internet) and an internal
(LAN) interface.  In fact, the latest release has been updated to
handle multiple external interfaces.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>It's not difficult.  You should be able to get the mechanics of
this done in half an hour, depending on how careful you want to be.
Budget an hour for the job since there's some reading to do beforehand.

<p>Go to his download page and grab it.  It's ~54 kilobytes.  It'll be in
the form of a tarball (gzipped tar archive).  <code>cd</code> to somewhere
safe, make a new directory to hold it, and extract it:

<pre class="code">
   cd
   mkdir ~/dwn
   cd ~/dwn
   tar xzf /path/to/arno-iptables-firewall-1.8.3-rc3.tgz
</pre>

<p>That creates a new directory, ~/dwn/arno-iptables-firewall-1.8.3-RC3:

</pre>

<p>They're all flat ASCII text files.  Now, read the README.  It
starts out by mentioning it's free software, licenced under the GNU
General Public License.  It goes on to explain what the various files
are for.  One of the most welcome things to me in the latest version
is Arno has chopped the line length in most of his stuff to a much
more readable eighty characters or so.  He appears to like lines that
are about a hundred characters long, and displaying them in an eighty
character wide xterm (or console) made them very difficult to read.
Mostly, that's no longer a problem.  You'll still see remnants of
this, in his actual firewall script for example.

<p>Following the file descriptions, he lists &quot;Some IMPORTANT
(security) information&quot;.  Following that is a &quot;Quick
setup&quot; section, a section on WHAT TO DO IN THE CONFIG FILE, and
some info you may need in rebuilding your kernel if it doesn't already
have iptables support (:-O really?!?  I haven't seen any distributions
supplying pre-compiled kernels without iptables support, or maybe this
is in case you're having trouble rolling your own...  I'll have to go
back and re-read that bit sometime).

<p>The old version flatly refused to work if you were using a 2.2.x
kernel and ipchains.  The latest version detects 2.2.x and ipchains
and continues (I haven't tested this).

<p>The README used to suggest installation instructions you might use,
but perhaps he's blended those into the other sections?  I notice
there's also a bit at the top of the firewall script itself.  However,
I suggest you use common sense and figure out how you need it done for
your system.  They're just a couple of scripts and config files.  How
difficult can it be?  :-)

<p>On the other hand...


<h3>What I Did - Configuration</h3>

<p>As root:

<pre class="code">
   $ cp rc.iptables /etc/init.d
   $ vi /etc/init.d/rc.iptables
</pre>

<p>A few lines into the file, you'll see CONFIG_FILE.  Change that to
say:

<pre class="code">
   CONFIG_FILE=/etc/firewall/iptables-firewall.conf
</pre>

<p>Now make it executable (Arno suggests this should be 700; you decide):

<pre class="code">
   $ chmod 744 /etc/init.d/rc.iptables
</pre>

<p>If necessary:

<pre class="code">
   $ chown root:root /etc/init.d/rc.iptables
</pre>

<p>Now make a home for the config file(s):

<pre class="code">
   $ mkdir /etc/firewall
   $ chmod 755 /etc/firewall
   $ cp iptables-firewall.conf /etc/firewall
   $ chmod 600 /etc/firewall/iptables-firewall.conf
   $ vi /etc/firewall/iptables-firewall.conf
</pre>

<p>If you're going to use them, you now want to create
iptables-blocked-hosts, iptables-custom-rules, and
iptables-mac-addresses (make sure those are the names mentioned, down
at the bottom, in the config file).  I notice they're commented out in
the latest version's config file.  These need to be at least one blank
line long, so vi them, insert a carriage return, save, and exit.

<p>Now go back to the top of iptables-firewall.conf, inserting the
important stuff telling AIF how it should do things for your system.
This part gets a little hairy, so you might like to peruse the mailing
list archives to see if you can find explanations of how to do this
correctly.  The FAQ also mentions a few little syntactical nits that
it might help to know.  I went with Arno's suggestion and changed as
little as I could.  There are lots of comments explaining what things
do and when you might want to use them.

<p><b>Yes, that is a little vague.</b> Sorry, but this bit is the
so-called kernel of what you need to learn about iptables for AIF to
work for you the way you want it to work.  What is it you want to do,
and what is there that you have to work with?  DSL/ADSL?  Dialup ppp?
WiFi from a broadband modem?  What ports do you want to open up to the
crackers?  Do you know what you're doing with iptables, or are you a
dilettante like me?

<p>You do want to tell it what your external interface is:

<pre class="code">
   EXT_IF=&quot;ppp+&quot;
</pre>

in my case ("ppp+" covers ppp0, ppp1, ppp2, etc.)  Then:

<pre class="code">
   INT_IF=&quot;eth0&quot;
</pre>

takes care of my NIC along with:

<pre class="code">
   INTERNAL_NET=&quot;192.168.1.0/24&quot;
</pre>

<p>One of the things mentioned in the FAQ is you don't want or need
&quot;127.0.0.1&quot; (the loopback interface) mentioned anywhere.
&quot;Ah, so I guess I don't need to do anything about my caching
nameserver?  Uhh...&quot; Well, the MaraDNS man page has a good
section on this. Later.

<p>Also, you might like to take my chmod commands above with a grain
of salt.  I don't see a great deal of point in locking things down so
group and other can't read them.  However, that is how Arno suggests
they be.  You make up your own mind.  To me, if a config file doesn't
contain any sensitive information, it's a little silly to make it
owner:group read-only.


<h3>What I Did - Implementation</h3>

<p>Once you've solved the config file problem, you then need to figure
out how you want it executed.  If you want it to come up at boot time,
you'll need init script links in /etc/rcN.d directories.  Arno
mentions how to do this at the top of the firewall script itself.  You
can do it by hand, but most distributions have some sort of tool you
can use to manage those links.

<p>For my purposes, I wanted it controlled by interface
initialization, and that fits well with Debian's /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/
system.  Any script in that directory will be run when the interface
is brought on line and configured.  There's also /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/
which works similarly in reverse.

<p>Now, take a look in /etc/network.  Just like ppp, there are if-up.d
&quot;-ish&quot; (among others) directories in there too.

<p>In my case, I created the script /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00iptables_firewall.
It needs only two lines: the &quot;shebang&quot;, and a line to call
rc.iptables:

<pre class="code">
   #!/bin/sh
   /etc/init.d/rc.iptables start
</pre>

<p>Now, &quot;chmod 744 /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00iptables_firewall&quot;.
Similarly, you need a script in /etc/ppp/ip-down.d that will take the
firewall down when the interface goes down:

<pre class="code">
   #!/bin/sh
   # if [ ! &quot;$(/sbin/ifconfig | /bin/grep eth0)&quot; ]; then
      /etc/init.d/rc.iptables stop
   # fi
</pre>

<p>Notice the commented out lines.  When I started on this, that did a
sanity check first: if, by chance, I happen to have both ppp0 and ethN
up and connected, it would be a little silly to take down the firewall
if only one of the interfaces was being taken down.  However, now that
I think about it, that might be a little dumb.  I'm still re-thinking
that bit.

<p>Make sure that file's executable too.

<p>The last thing you <b>might want</b> to do is tweak
/etc/syslog.conf to tell syslogd to send firewall related messages to
/var/log/firewall.  In the latest version, this is optional.  Arno was
kind enough to include a couple of examples of syslog.conf that you
can work with.  I just did this: look for the first instance of
&quot;kern.*&quot; and change that to &quot;kern.!=debug&quot;, then
add a new line that points kern.=debug at /var/log/firewall.  Now, I
have:

<pre>
   auth,authpriv.*                 /var/log/auth.log
   *.*;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslog
   #cron.*                         /var/log/cron.log
   daemon.*                        -/var/log/daemon.log
   kern.!=debug                    -/var/log/kern.log
   lpr.*                           -/var/log/lpr.log
   mail.*                          -/var/log/mail.log
   user.*                          -/var/log/user.log
   uucp.*                          /var/log/uucp.log

   # Logging for iptables
   kern.=debug                     -/var/log/firewall
</pre>

<p>Once you change /etc/syslog.conf, you need to touch the new logfile
(<b>only do this if it doesn't already exist</b>):

<pre class="code">
   $ touch /var/log/firewall
</pre>

<p>and you need to cycle syslogd to make it re-read its config file:

<pre class="code">
   $ kill -HUP $(pidof syslogd)
</pre>

<p>If you don't have &quot;pidof&quot;, you'll have to determine
syslogd's PID and insert that there instead.  &quot;ps fax | grep
syslogd&quot; says this:

<pre>
   (0) keeling /home/keeling_ ps fax | grep syslogd
     242 ?        S      0:00 /sbin/syslogd
   30307 pts/2    S      0:00          |       \_ grep syslogd
</pre>

<p>so you need to say &quot;kill -HUP 242&quot;

<p><b>If you've done the syslog.conf fiddle,</b> make sure you've set
&quot;FIREWALL_LOG=/var/log/firewall&quot; and
&quot;LOGLEVEL=debug&quot; in /etc/firewall/iptables-firewall.conf.
Hopefully, you have logrotate on your system, else the log file will
just grow and grow, eventually filling your filesystem.

<p>This is &quot;/etc/logrotate.d/firewall&quot;:

<pre class="code">
   /var/log/firewall {
           rotate 7
           daily
           compress
           notifempty
           create 0640 root adm
           delaycompress
           create
   }
</pre>

<p>Now, you should be good to go.  I would suggest the first (few?)
time(s), you should run /etc/init.d/rc.iptables by hand (&quot;chmod
644 /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00iptables_firewall&quot; first, bring up the
connection, then run &quot;/etc/init.d/rc.iptables start&quot;).  It
spits out quite a few messages mentioning what it's doing.  You should
peruse that output (see the example below), ensuring it's doing what
you want.  This is also when you'll get a chance to do something about
any errors found in the config file.  &quot;iptables -nL | less&quot;
will show the firewall rules.  &quot;tail -f /var/log/firewall&quot;
will show you the effect of those rules.

<p>If you can't figure out how to make AIF do something you did
before, Arno has thought about that and made exceptions possible.
Take the iptables rule you used before and stuff it into iptables-
custom-rules.  Of course, <b>be warned</b> that this may compromise
whatever AIF is attempting to do for you.  However, if you were doing
it before, you're probably no worse off now than you were.

<p>In my case, when I was using the older version, I had this in my
/etc/firewall/iptables-custom-rules to make chrony/NTP work:

<pre class="code">
   # man iptables says using a name that must be resolved via remote
   # DNS is a Really Bad Idea.  Sigh.
   # 
   iptables -t filter -I INPUT -s 0.pool.ntp.org -m tcp -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
   iptables -t filter -I INPUT -s 1.pool.ntp.org -m tcp -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
   iptables -t filter -I INPUT -s 2.pool.ntp.org -m tcp -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
</pre>

<p>With the new version, however, I've commented those out and used
&quot;HOST_OPEN_TCP&quot; in the config file instead:

<pre class="code">
   HOST_OPEN_TCP=&quot;0.pool.ntp.org&gt;123 1.pool.ntp.org&gt;123 2.pool.ntp.org&gt;123&quot;
</pre>

<h3>AIF In Action</h3>

<p>Take a look at what it's doing.  Here's an example of rc.iptables
output:

</pre>

<p>Woof!  You should see the &quot;iptables -nL&quot; output!  Some of
this stuff, I'd only vaguely heard of.  Take a gander into the
rc.iptables script itself to see all that it's doing.  First, the
&quot;Sanity checks&quot;, then it modprobes all the necessary kernel
modules (again, some of which I'd never heard of).  Arno's doing all
the obscure:

<pre class="code">
  echo ${some_integer} &gt; /proc/sys/net/blah/blah

<p>that I've never managed to either take the time to understand or
find a decent reference for.  Finally, he defines various firewall
rulesets.

<p>One of the neat things about this is, instead of the fairly bland:

<pre>
   Mar 16 07:24:38 localhost kernel: IN=ppp0 OUT= MAC= \
      SRC=xxx.xxx.xx.xx DST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx LEN=48 TOS=0x00 \
      PREC=0x00 TTL=102 ID=59091 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=3946 DPT=6348 \
      WINDOW=64240 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0
</pre>

<p>I now see things like this:

<pre>
   Apr  6 12:41:06 localhost kernel: Connection attempt (UNPRIV): \
      IN=ppp0 OUT= MAC= SRC=xx.xxx.xxx.xxx DST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx LEN=48 \
      TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=109 ID=28712 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=4194 DPT=15118 \
      WINDOW=65535 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 
</pre>

<p>which is pretty slick.  It explains what it is it saw.
&quot;UNPRIV&quot; means the destination port (DPT) is higher than port
1024 (see /etc/services).

<p>Other interesting stuff:

<pre>
   Apr 18 20:22:42 localhost kernel: Possible DRDOS TCP attempt: \
      IN=ppp0 OUT= MAC= SRC=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx DST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx \
      LEN=576 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=63 ID=48819 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=110 \
      DPT=4345 WINDOW=5840 RES=0x00 ACK URGP=0 
</pre>

<p>That came in on pop3/TCP (&quot;grep 110 /etc/services&quot;) looking
for some port I don't have (4345).

<p>Among the things you get in AIF, Arno includes
&quot;fwfilter&quot;, a shell script you can use to massage the
logfile entries.  I'm already running something else called
fwlogwatch<a href="#viii"><sup>viii</sup></a>, but I decided to try this anyway.  Arno supplies
instructions inside the script explaining how it's to be used.  I
created a short script in /etc/cron.daily/fwfilter:

<pre class="code">
   #! /bin/sh
   #
   #  /etc/cron.daily/fwfilter - arno's iptables-firewall activity
   #  monitoring script.
   # 

   FWFILTER=/path/to/arno's/fwfilter
   FWLOG=/var/log/firewall
   DAY=&quot;$(/bin/date '+%b %e' --date=yesterday)&quot;
   
   if [ -f &quot;${FWFILTER}&quot; -a -f &quot;${FWLOG}&quot; ]; then
      /bin/grep &quot;${DAY}&quot; ${FWLOG} | ${FWFILTER}
   fi
</pre>

<p>When the system runs its daily cron jobs, this slurps in the
firewall log looking for entries from yesterday, pipes them through to
Arno's fwfilter script, and the output is mailed to root.  The result
is quite pretty and informative.  <b>Log file entries are colorized by
type.</b> The mutt mail program can show ANSI escape sequence color
with &quot;set allow_ansi=yes&quot;, but you really ought to see the
output in (eg.) rxvt or xterm.

<p>Note, depending on your installed version of awk, you may need to
fiddle with the fwfilter script prior to using it.  See the variable
&quot;AWK_BIN&quot;.  If &quot;which awk&quot; (or better, &quot;dpkg
-l | grep awk&quot;, or &quot;rpm -qf $(which awk)&quot;) mentions
&quot;mawk&quot;, you'll need to install gawk for fwfilter to work.

<h3>D'enouement</h3>

<p>I think it was a success.  I haven't lost anything, other than a
little time.  All the things I could do before, I can still do now.  I
see log records of other, more esoteric events, that I hadn't noticed
before.  That's the sort of thing I do want to hear about.

<p>I've since had the chance to drop this into the computer I'm
rebuilding for a friend as well.  It's worked pretty well, hasn't
interfered with the two computers' ability to communicate with each
other, and was easy to implement.  So far, I've nothing but praise for
AIF.  It's just what I've been hunting for for a long time.

<p>Arno's system is easy to use, can probably scale to fit any
situation, and can do it in the hands of a relative newcomer to
firewalls.  If you can read, you can benefit from Arno's firewall.

<p>If you do try this, and you like it as much as I do, take his
advice in the README and donate to his favourite charities.

<p><b>Rock on, Arno.  Bravo.  Thank you very much!</b>

    do much of anything to the internal interface other than making
    sure anything from it is allowed out.  So, testing whether eth0 is
    up before taking down the firewall is likely the wrong thing to
    do.  I've since disabled that test to verify.

<em>

<p> In 1990, after about a decade of processing seismic data (first as a
computer operator, then as geophysical technician), I sat down to my first
personal computer and started teaching myself how to program in C. After a
couple of months at it, I decided it would make a fairly challenging and
esthetically pleasing career, so I signed up for a programming course.  I
graduated with an A average.

<p> Since then, work has taken me from Grande Prairie, Alberta to Khartoum,
Sudan.  I've worked with SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
I've worked with many different distributions of Linux (SLS, Slackware,
Debian (twice), Redhat, and SuSE).  I generally program in Perl.  I
specialize in generic Unix.
