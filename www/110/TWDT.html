Heather got started in computing before she quite got started learning
English.  By 8 she was a happy programmer, by 15 the system administrator
for the home... Dad had finally broken down and gotten one of those personal
computers, only to find it needed regular care and feeding like any other
pet.  Except it wasn't a Pet: it was one of those brands we find most 
everywhere today...  

<P> Heather is a hardware agnostic, but has spent more hours as a tech in
Windows related tech support than most people have spent with their computers.
(Got the pin, got the Jacket, got about a zillion T-shirts.)  When she
discovered Linux in 1993, it wasn't long before the home systems ran Linux
regardless of what was in use at work.

<P> By 1995 she was training others in using Linux - and in charge of all the 
"strange systems" at a (then) 90 million dollar company.  Moving onwards, it's
safe to say, Linux has been an excellent companion and breadwinner... She 
took over the HTML editing for "The Answer Guy" in issue 28, and has been 
slowly improving the preprocessing scripts she uses ever since.

<P> Here's an autobiographical filksong she wrote called

<P><STRONG>
ASUS P5A-B motherboard with AMD-K6-2 300MHz cpu.  Other people report
assorted linux boot problems with this board and other ASUS boards.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I can boot my version of linux (Basixlinux 2, based on <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> 7.1, or
Basiclinux 3 with the SW71 kernel but libc5) from a 2-floppy lilo-boot
version that uses RAMdisk, a loadlin-boot RAMdisk version, a loop version,
or SW4.0 zipslack (UMSDOS).  But if I try to boot BL2 or BL3 with loadlin
from a hard drive installation, with the kernels compiled for them or with
bare.i Slackware kernel, the boot process stops at the lines:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>Linux NET4.0 for Linux 2.2
Based upon Swansea...
Net4:  Unix domain sockets 1.0 for Linux NET4.0
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
(The Basiclinux kernel gets me two lines further along to something about
TCP).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tried starting with FreeDOS, DR-DOS, and Win98 DOS (since I have three
other computers that will boot linux with loadlin from Win9X DOS but not
always from the others, and one that will boot loop linux from any DOS
except Win9X).  I do not have a hard drive version set up to boot with
lilo.  Is that likelier to work?  I don't want to use lilo as I work in
DOS more of the time.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tried telling CMOS that there was no second drive because someone
suggested that method to get linux to recognize a larger drive, but my
drive is 3GB.  I have DOS on a master drive and two linux partitions on
the slave drive, with one linux in each, and RAMdisk and loop versions in
DOS partitions.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am able to mount the linux partitions when running from the RAMdisk or
loop versions and then switch to run linux on them:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
chroot /mnt
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
This puts hdb1 on <TT>/</TT> and I can then use linux on the ext2 partition.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
But this is essentially what most initrd-based start up procedures do
anyway! So, though I haven't used BasixLinux, I would guess that the
problem is with the start scripts on your ext2 partition in <TT>/etc/rcS.d</TT>
or some such.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
This is a minor nuisance and I suppose I could put it in an rc file, or
just use the smaller version unless I needed the larger one.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am writing out of curiosity - why are so many computers difficult to
boot with linux?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
The glass could also be half full! Given the variety of hardware that
Linux runs on it is surprising that so many computers boot with it at
all. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Is there a better fix for this one?  Is there a better
fix for the other three besides installing Win98 DOS on them (and having
to use a boot floppy to defragment the DOS partitions after that) or
rebooting with a Win98 boot disk to go from DOS to linux?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I also have one Northgate 386 SX 20MHz 4.7MB RAM laptop which has no
cursor in linux. Cirrus video, 256K video RAM, mono VGA.  The cursor is
plain white when used in color VGA.  The computer in theory can output to
a color monitor in 800x600 resolution.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
Is this with or without X? The question is not clear enough. Are you in
graphics mode or text mode?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Does laptop video treat software cursors oddly?  A cursor appears when I
use a text editor.  There is a cursor while booting to DOS and in DOS.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Another 386 with identical speed, RAM and video won't boot linux at all -
the screen goes black and I need to reboot.  What might cause this
problem?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
Try booting with the additional option "vesafb=off". Some of the older
hardware may not respond well to being switched to graphic mode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for your help a couple of years ago getting my first linux set up
<BR>to work with both TTL and VGA monitors.

<P>
I got an interesting call from a friend of mine, a PyCon regular who, as
it turns out, lives in Sweden.  There's been a discussion on the PyCon
list about whether the $175 conference fee is too high, too low, or
just right.  That got her asking me what would it take to get more
Americans to present a talk at EuroPython (in Sweden next July --
<A HREF="http://www.europython.org"
	>http://www.europython.org</A>) and Python UK
(in England next April -- <A HREF="http://www.accu.org/conference"
	>http://www.accu.org/conference</A>), and more
Europeans to PyCon (in Washington DC next April -- <A HREF="http://pycon.org"
	>http://pycon.org</A>).
I thought I'd throw the question out to y'all for ideas.  Not everyone
here is interested in Python, but the same thing applies to Linux and
other free software projects.
</P>
<P>
She said that she could guess why why not many American presenters would
go to Europe, but she wanted to ask somebody on this side of the pond in
case there were factors she wasn't aware of.  I said the main problem
for Americans (besides the expense) is that most people only get two
weeks' vacation per year, so they have to use the time selectively.  She
asked why that was, since in Sweden the minimum is six weeks and most
people get nine.  I said I don't know, it's just a longstanding
tradition.  She asked why people don't demand more.  I said people are
much more concerned about health care, and more vacation time is lower
in their priorities.
</P>
<P>
She said that for her, the main problem with coming to American
conferences is the expense.  That seems to be outside our control since
the conference fee is minimal already, and we can't do anything about
airfares or accommodation fees.  'Course the falling dollar will help.

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
As far as I can tell, the most important thing is just to keep these
conferences going, so that even if people can't attend next year, maybe
they can do the year after, or maybe some overseas people will go to one
and others to the next.
</P>
<P>
Another thing that's happening in the Python world is different kinds of
events are emerging.  These three are traditional conferences with
speakers.  In Seattle we've had a couple sprints (=weekend hacking
sessions) without speakers, and I gather those are happening in Europe
too.  So maybe the answer is not just more opportunities for speakers,
but more types of events.
</P>
<P>
Any other ideas?

As you noticed, the use of a wildcard in a command like mount
really blew me away.  The remark you added to my article compounded
it.  find, great.  less, OK...  mount?!
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
[grin] Yeah, pretty amazing. It gets much <EM>more</EM> amazing when you
install and enable "bash_completion"; all the... well, <EM>stuff</EM> that has
multiple options becomes available at the prompt. E.g., typing "ssh "
(note the space) and hitting 'Tab' twice shows me a list of all the
hosts in my ~/.ssh/known_hosts; typing "mount " and hitting 'Tab' three
times (since all the entries start with '<TT>/</TT>', which is displayed
immediately) gives me a list of all the directories listed in
"<TT>/etc/fstab</TT>"... obviously, completion happens when you have a unique
string: I've been doing "ssh li&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;" for a session at
linuxgazette.net for so long that I'd be lost without it.

If you count the couple of years I had used Coherent prior to
graduating to <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> Linux, I've probably been at *nix for 10 years
or so.  In other words off the steep part of the learning curve,
but, boy, is there ever enough curve left!
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
That's the lovely thing about Unix, to me. You keep gaining these chunks
of power every time you learn something - and the chunks don't get any
smaller with time. It can be a little tough on the ego for the folks who
think that way... but to me, it's a fantastic opportunity to squeeze any
amount of juice that I may need out of a system. It's not a question of
"is it possible" any longer, but "where do I find the HOWTO?" instead.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Anyhoo, I would like to encourage you to do an article on obscure
uses of wildcards on the command line.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Um. Well... the problem is in defining "obscure". To me, they're not;
they're just how shells operate. To someone else, they may well be
obscure. Say... maybe looking at it in broader terms would be useful -
an article, or even a series on CLI usage in general might be pretty
good!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm sorta swamped for the moment - and actually "owe" about three
articles to myself 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> - but that one sounds like a really good idea.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Like ignoring the consequences of SuSE's apparent elimination of
the need for mount -- there are still questions in my mind but, then,
I bounce back and forth between root and any of several users a
lot and may have messed things up -- what would "mount *" do?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
It would give you an error.

Try

</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Essentially, you've answered your own question: "mount *" would just be
too ambiguous. E.g., "ssh " or "ssh ben@" is not at all ambiguous: the
host name is what has to come after either one of them, and it makes
sense that hitting the completion key (Tab) would "complete" them or
show the possible options. I assume you know that 'Tab' works to
complete program names at the CLI, right? Filenames, too -
"vi ~/.bash_p&lt;Tab&gt;" pulls up my "~/.bash_profile" every time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Keep up the good work
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Thanks, Edgar! Heck, you might want to write the article yourself: read
the Bash man page, and take a look at the "<TT>/etc/bash_completion</TT>" script.
That should give you a <EM>good</EM> start.

I had just settled in of a Saturday evening with a wee dram of Irish
whiskey, a good Henry Clay cigar and Linux Gazette #109.  I had worked
my way to "Return of the Linux Laundrette" and reached the section "Re:

<P>
Hi Rich, all,
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Advanced Features of netfilter/iptables by Barry O'Donovan [November
2004 (#10
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT="8)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">] was a very informative article.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks! It's always good to hear positive feedback.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
But my "math flag" flew
from my pocket when I saw his example for using the random module.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
So did mine on reading the published article. I had actually planned to
point it out with an Octave example demonstrating the difference
between the right and wrong answer in this months article, but when it
came to writing it I discarded the example as it didn't fit with my
layout and completely forgot to add it as erratum.
</P>
<P>
If there is one thing I have learnt about statistics (and I've learnt
quite a lot between my degree which was top heavy on stats and my
research where I use the damn stuff every day) is that if the answer is
simple, then it's just plain wrong!
</P>
<P><STRONG>
If you wish to divide the packets evenly among the four servers then
the example should look like this:

The reason is that, after 25% of the packets are NATed by the first
rule, only 75% of them will be seen by the second rule.  A third of
them would equal 25% of the total.  Likewise, the third rule will see
only half of the total and half of that is 25% of the total.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Correct. A subtle and simple mistake that might cause many a sys-admin a
prolonged headache!
</P>
<P>
When speaking of mistakes and statistics, I'm always reminded of a few
quotes:
<p>
<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<P>
"There are two kinds of statistics: the kind you look up and the kind
you make up."
</P>

<P>
"I gather, young man, that you wish to be a Member of Parliament. The
first lesson that you must learn is, when I call for statistics about
the rate of infant mortality, what I want is proof that fewer babies
died when I was Prime Minister than when anyone else was Prime
Minister. That is a political statistic."
</P>

<P>
"You know how dumb the average guy is? Well, by definition, half of them
are even dumber than that."
</P>
<P>
"Statistics in the hands of an engineer are like a lamppost to a
drunk-they're used more for support than illumination."
</P>
<P>
"Numbers are like people; torture them enough and they'll tell you
anything."
</P>
<P>
"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics."
</P>
<P>
"A statistician is a man who comes to the rescue of figures that cannot
lie for themselves."
</P>
<P>
"First get your facts; then you can distort them at your leisure."
</P><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Ahhhh.... statistics. So easy to love and hate all at once!
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
Barry
</P>
<P>
P.S. Thanks also to John Macdonald and one of our French translators,
Emmanuel Araman, who also pointed this out to me.

I sent the message out last night; so far, the first five people have
responded. My best hopes and wishes go out to the rest, and to all.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Breen] 
Thanks for that, Ben. Please let us know as you hear from more of
our Indian friends.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I surely will, Breen. So far, we've got Vinayak's name to the five who
had responded previously; Sayamindu Dasgupta's address bounced, but I
found a phone number for him at <A HREF="http://peacefulaction.org"
	>http://peacefulaction.org</A> which he
listed in his author profile. He's OK; seems he's in Kolkata (West
Bengal), and everything is all right there.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Folks, please keep them on your good wishes list or in your prayers, as
appropriate. It may be a small thing in the face of something this huge,
but... it's something. As Pramode said, "there are still human beings
alive who can feel the sorrow in another person's eyes - that's the only
consolation."
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"></p>
<P><STRONG>
[Ben] Are you all OK? I'd appreciate a response if you get a chance. I'd
imagine that many others here are just as concerned; I think that a lot
of people may just be... too stunned by the magnitude of this to come up
with a coherent response, and unsure of their own degree of connection
to you all. Me, I figure that we're all human beings - and that no man
is an island.

My heart goes out to you and all your countrymen in this difficult,
terrible time.

Thanks for checking. Yes. It is truly a devastating event here. Relief
agencies are doing what they can but every bit counts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I'm going to be letting people around here (northern Florida) know that
they can contribute to the Red Cross/Crescent India, and am going to

<EM>another</EM> warning out.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
The strange aspect of the tragedy is that people in Chennai who were more
than about 500 metres from the coast were almost unaware that anything
had happened. Since we live somewhat inland we were quite unaffected.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
[Nod] Tsunamis are like that. They're slow and quiet, definitely so at
first; the traditional way to commit suicide during one is to follow the
ocean as it recedes from the shore.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Folks - everyone - imprint this in your brain forever: if you ever see
the ocean receding, <EM>RUN</EM> like hell for the high ground. You at least
stand a chance of surviving, then.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
P.S. There is no word for "tsunami" in any of the local languages which
perhaps gives an idea of how unexpected the event was.

I live far away from the coast (in Bangalore). We did mobilise help and
have donated a lot of clothes/medicines for relief work. Though we
are safe in center of the Indian peninsula, we were shocked by the images
that were shown on television and splashed on the front pages of the
newspapers. I also read that 5 endangered tribes living in the
Andaman and Nicobar islands were wiped out forever and a few islands
were washed away (literally).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
[sigh] Damn. The only thing I'd ever heard about Andaman islanders was
the fanciful stuff from Conan Doyle... and now, they're gone. Forever.

Contention from various quarters notwithstanding, this world is <EM>not</EM>

against the weather, but... blood and hell, man! This is just appalling.

I stumbled across your article on mozilla/thunderbird headers (I'm only
an irregular reader)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I had a look an the "mheny" extension, because I like the idea of
customising the viewed headers, but I found that it <EM>CAN</EM> also control
the headers used at composition time. Not sure if you "summarized this
out" of your article, or didn't find it to start with 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Within the option dialog for mheny extension, select custom headers from
the tree on the left, then pick composition from the drop list on the
right, and you can select existing fields or add/remove custom fields,
which then show up when you compose a message.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
However (and I think this means it still doesn't fit your need) you
can't add a default value for a field.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Brian] 
And that's the bingo value: I did try mnenhy, but what I really want is
a constant X-blah header containing a specific value every time I send
an email via Mozilla Thunderbird.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Still a useful find, thanks ...
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Brian] 
But you got farther than I did, thanks for the heads up, I'll work some
more with mnenhy when I get a chance. Of course, that I just spelled the
name of the extension right twice only shows that I had to look it up
twice, inside of a minute or two.

The first thing you should see is the TAG Posting Guidelines
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A>
in the FAQ section.  There you'll see we don't do people's homework for
them.  How do we know it's homework?  You don't want to do a useful task:
who cares how many braces a C program has?  You choose the tools first and
then the strategy, and you insist on using kludgey tools.  If I really
wanted to count braces, I would write a Python program.

<P>
Readers who wish to convert JPEG to Postscript for inclusion in a
TeX/LaTeX document (or for any other reason) may want to use:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>	convert file.jpg eps2:file.eps
	                    ^
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Note the 2! This is better than the default "convert file.jpg file.eps"
and performs the same function as "jpeg2ps" (which is in <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>
non-free).
</P>
<P>
Explanation:
The default postscript level for PS conversion is 1 which produces large
and bad conversions since it produces pixelised bitmaps. In PS Level 2
and Level 3 the conversion of JPEG is inbuilt so the above procedure
just adds a bit of postscript header stuff to the <EM>unchanged</EM> jpeg file.
In other words this conversion is lossless.
</P>
<P>
You can also use "eps3" as the tag but beware that may be reasonably new
postscript printers that are <EM>not</EM> level 3 compliant. (Ghostscript <EM>is</EM>
level 3 compliant).
</P>

<P>
About: Mail Avenger is a highly-configurable, MTA-independent SMTP
server. It allows you to reject spam during mail transactions, before
spooling messages in your local mail queue. You can specify site-wide
default policies for filtering mail, but individual users can also craft
their own policies by creating avenger scripts in their home
directories. It includes many features not supported by other SMTP
servers, including mail-bomb protection, integration with kernel
firewalls, TCP SYN fingerprint and network route recording, SMTP-level
analysis of client implementations, SMTP callbacks to verify sender
addresses, per-user mail scripts that run during SMTP transactions,
virtual domain to user mapping for the purposes of filtering, SPF
(sender policy framework), dynamic SPF query construction in mail filter
scripts, support for easily issuing multiple concurrent, asynchronous
DNS and SPF queries from filter scripts, and the ability to run spam
filters such as spamassassin on message bodies before replying to SMTP
DATA commands.
</P>
<P>
Changes: A critical memory handling bug was fixed in the avenger.local
and deliver utilities.

<FONT COLOR="navy">starting X automatically without [gkx]dm</FONT></H3>
Ben (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%20110%5D%202c%20Tips%20%239"><em>LG</em> Editor</a>)


<P>
As past discussions in TAG have shown, I'm definitely not a fan of the
various display managers; I believe that they take away, or obscure, too
much of the control that a user has over X. However, starting X
automatically from your ~/.bash_profile doesn't seem like a very smart
move either: any time you get a login shell (e.g., logging into another
console), you'd be firing off a new instance of X - or at least trying
to, since it would die with a list of error messages.
</P>
<P>
The answer to this dilemma is a <EM>conditional</EM> start for X - in other
words, we only want to execute it if it's not already running, i.e. only
on the first login. To do this, just add the following line to the end
of your ~/.bash_profile:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>ps ax|grep -q "[ ]`which X`" || startx
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
For those who just have to know ([grin] I certainly would, if I were
you): the above expression pipes the list of running processes, which is
the output of the "ps" command, to 'grep', which searches it for the
presence of a running X. To make the search more precise, the command
substitution (`which X`) returns the full pathname to X as the search
string. The character class preceding the search string ([ ]) is there
to make 'grep' ignore its own entry in process table (an old 'grep'
trick), and the "-q" option of 'grep' makes it return only a
success/failure exit code instead of the actual matched string. The OR
operator, '||', ties it all together into an expression that says
"either X is running OR (execute) startx".
</P>

that links to the above page with the correct domain name and

The ad seems to say it includes the CPU, although I'm surprised it
doesn't say the speed.
This compared to the $150-200 I'd spend on a regular motherboard and
CPU.  Which seems the better deal?  Gentoo has an Am64 version.  Does
the 64 bit make enough difference to justify the $60 over a regular
Athlon?

Unless you need 4GB+ memory, then you probably don't need 64-bit.  Since
you're asking such question, you definitely don't need it. :-)

I would advise against Shuttle.  They have heat problem, and their power
supply is not the quality stuff.

x86_64 is a better design than the old x86. Hypertransport makes
enough of a differerence that an x86_64 system is pound for pound
faster than a P4 system. But it really shines when you throw a lot of
RAM at it. Being able to seamlessly address more than 2GB of memory is
a very good thing. Of course with your budget that's just academic. If
you still want one for the cool factor (which is justification enough
IMHO) then get a motherboard based on one of the via chipsets not the
nForce3. I'm basing this on what a dog the nForce2 was so it may not
be entirely fair, plus I have a cheap via based Athlon64 at work that
installed Fedora Core 1 (x86_64) out of the box with no fuss. This was
decidedly different behaviour from some of the weird Opteron chipsets
I've had to deal with.

What would be the most politically correct video card for this puppy?
Meaning, which manufacturers are doing a good job of making their

Sadly there are no politically correct graphics cards. Capitalist

Aw, you're not even trying. "Buy the Athlon64 now for the coolness, or
invest in it for the ability to seamlessly address more than 2GB of
memory" -- offer a choice that isn't, because the brain only listens to
the 'or'. Standard sales trick.

The 2GB limit is a major pain though. A certain badly
written renderer which we shall not name has a favourite trick whereby
it runs full speed at the 2GB per process limit and then dies in a
small shower of zombied process. When the 64bit version comes out
it'll have to find a new trick.

x86_64 is definately faster than straight x86 but I'm not sure it's
worth the price difference given that you are not going to be doing
anything to take advantage of it's extra features. Personally I'd buy
a P4 and spend the difference on a DVD-RW.

The shuttles are not silent. The new PSU's are much quieter than the
old ones. I know this because I was sufficiently irritated with the
old one to upgrade. They are quieter than a standard off the shelf PC
though.

I don't anticipate having more than 640 MB of memory, so the 2 GB doesn't
apply.  I thought Shuttle had solved the heat problem in their later

Depends what's in the case. I have a P4, 512MB RAM, 120-GB PATA drive,
CD-RW/DVD and a Fanless nVidia 5200. I haven't had any heat issues but
I'm not sure I'd want to fill the spare PCI slot or put in a second
hard drive. If you want to pack a lot of kit in then you are probably
better off looking at more generic case designs.

Dear readers, your editors have been discussing the changing PC/Internet
environment since LG's early days, and we're wondering what's the
minimum level of hardware and bandwidth now in the remoter parts of
Africa, Latin America, and Asia?  Are Pentium/K6 computers above
300 MHz universal now?  Are people still downloading the FTP files
because they can't afford the hour online to read LG interactively on
the web?  Or is that no longer an issue?  If we started allowing
articles to have more supplemental files, more images, more tarball
examples, would that cause an undue burden to any readers or does it
not matter?
</STRONG></P>

There seem to be two separate questions --
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
1. How hard is it to maintain a mirror of LG if the bandwidth/hardware
requirement is upped?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Speaking only from my experience this should not be a problem in
India providing that only "biggish" sites like ours try to maintain
a mirror.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
2. How hard will it be to read LG if the bandwidth/hardware requirement is upped?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As long as there is a low-bandwidth low-hardware version of LG that
is available, you can always up the requirement for a high-end version.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So what is low-bandwidth?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
A. Speaking only for India. Most places still have only a dial-up phone link.
This link takes them to an ISP who will probably give them a share of
64K-512K link to one of the hubs in the bigger cities which are then linked
quite well to the rest of the internet and each other (the hubs that is).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
And what is low-hardware?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
B. In a recent meeting to disburse funds to Indian universities for the purchase of
computers, I heard that some of these place still have 486's. However, with
the recent drop in prices of entry level Pentium class machines (to approximately
half the earlier price) this should change in a year or so. At the same time
working hardware has a way of trickling down over here so it is not impossible
to find even a 386 in some places.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, the use of GNU/Linux in India at this level is still very low. Since (whether
we like it or not) LG is only read by people with some familiarity with *nix, the above
data may not be entirely relevant.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
For years we got letters every few months asking for an e-mail or print
version of LG.  That was unfeasable for us to provide, so we steered
people toward the FTP version, TWDT, and TWDT.txt instead.  The mirrors
complained whenever we regenerated the FTP files or made bulk updates to
back issues, because of the bandwidth it cost them.  One student wrote
from a school in Africa, saying they all read LG from a shared copy
downloaded at the school, but the school couldn't afford the online time
to read it interactively on the web.  Others said they paid by the
minute or megabyte for their Internet connection, and each megabyte was
a significant choice.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Yet now we hear that Pentium-level computers are widely available in the
poorer parts of Latin America, many governments are switching to
Linux, and community wireless networks are sprouting up in villages in
India and Africa.  It's been over a year since we've gotten a bandwidth
complaint from a reader or a mirror.  Does that mean this is no longer
an issue?  Or that those readers now have more local resources for Linux
information/help and no longer rely solely on LG?  Or that we lost those
readers/mirrors during the move from SSC and they never found our new
address?  Unfortunately, the the nature of this problem means that those
who are the least connected are the ones least able to write in and tell us
about it, so we need to hear from others from those countries and
regions who can tell us what the situation is.

"Minimum", in this venue, always starts at zero. Asking what the
"minumum" hardware is will have people responding with their stories of
woe about building TCP/IP stacks with hay and mud, and being too poor to
get quality mud. Phrasing the question as you have predetermines the
field of answers, since people who do not consider their hardware as
"minimum" will not respond, and so you'll get the answers that only
reinforce the point you're trying to make as opposed to the true state
of the situation - a perfect example of the "statistics" that Barry was
talking about just a few days ago.

"Running KDE comfortably" on a 300 MHz Pentium?! You must be joking...
Have you tried opening a recent version of KDE? It's a hog - both
memory and CPU. I have an 1800+ AthlonXP with 512MB of RAM, and even
so KDE is sloooow to start up and apps take a while to open, including
Firefox (a browser considered both modern and "light").

Yes but you have to draw a line somewhere.  KDE 3.2 is reasonable but not
snappy on my 450 MHz Duron, but KDE 3.3 on the same machine is so slow it
makes Windows look fast by comparision.  It may not be KDE's fault: the
first is on <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> and the second on Gentoo, and the system startup/shutdown
on the Gentoo side is much slower too.  I just bought a 2600 AthlonXP
chip (decided to wait a year or two on the Shuttle), so we'll see how
much that helps.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
BTW, I got a Foxconn micro ATX motherboard to go with it.  Hadn't heard
of that brand before, but it had a VIA chipset and Award BIOS so I
figured it was more standard than the mobo next to it with an nVIDIA
chipset.  I paid $6 more for less, haha: two memory slots instead of
three, three PCI slots instead of five or six.  But I thought back to
when have I ever used more than three PCI cards simultaneously, and the
answer was "never".  Presumably the nVIDIA chipset would have been
compatible enough since it wasn't nVIDIA <EM>video</EM>, but I figured why take
chances and did I want my money going to a company that offers
binary-only drivers?  The salesman reassured me that a micro ATX mobo
would fit into a regular ATX case; we'll see.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It's interesting how the prices of chips and motherboards have reversed.
My standard rule has been to buy whatever combination is currently
selling for $150.  In the past that's meant a $50 chip and $70
motherboard.  But this time it's a $99 chip and a $55 motherboard.  They
did have $50 chips but they were AMD Seperon.  I haven't heard of those
before.  They came out a couple months ago as a replacement line for the
Duron.  Gentoo doesn't mention them as a supported platform although I
assume they're compatible.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Tom's Hardware says the Sempron is replacing both the Duron and the
32-bit Athlon.  <A HREF="http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20040728/index.html"

BTW, I've got one of the top end Sempron's, a 3100+, running on an Asus
K8N mobo (nForce3 chipset). The motherboard itself is bloody amazing.
Socket for the processor. Heatsink over the single (or composite? can't
tell) chipset. A few small (8-12 pin) smc glue logic chips, batches of
electrolytic caps, sm resistors, and lots of connectors. But overall,
the impression is of a barren field... picture here:

<blockQuote>
The 3100+ Sempron is a 64-bit A64 with 32 bits lopped off, and half the
L2 cache, sort of the modern day equivalent of the 386SX, I guess.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The other components in the system are a 160G Seagate Barracuda 7200.7
HD, an old 4x DVD+RW burner, and 512M of RAM.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Still, the board/processor combination is fast, supported well by the
2.6.9 kernel. The ethernet is on the chipset, and runs with the
forcedeth driver, which is making some good strides now that nVidia
decided that since a reverse-engineered driver was available in spite of
their non-assistance, they might as well help make it better. Audio is
acceptable as AC97/i810 equivalent. I'm running an ATI 9200 Video card,
and the whole thing is wrapped up in an Antec Sonata case.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I've thrown Debian Sarge, Xandros, Fedora Core 3, and a couple of *BSD
variants at it, all have run. <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> has no driver for the ethernet
ported yet. Everything else just worked, and it's the fastest "cheap"
system I have.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It's not as robust as the 2.5 year old dual Athlon box, but true SMP
just keeps trucking when a single processor box starts wheezing.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, I'd count this report as a positive recommendation for the
nForce3/Sempron combination on recent (2.6 kernel based) distros.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The Sempron is just the Athlon renamed, which explains why there's only a $5
difference between the same-speed chips.  Seems AMD's marketers were
getting nervous about the brand-name dilution effect of having their
luxury chip (the AMD 64) and their proletarian chip (the Athlon) both
called "Athlon", afraid that consumers wouldn't notice the difference
and would, ahem, fail to appreciate the advantages of the higher-end
chips.  (Although "higher-end" is open to debate, since the price of the
64-bit chips is pretty close to their same-speed 32-bit counterparts.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
AMD also seems to be preparing to ditch Socket A by designing a Sempron
that will fit in their AMD 64 motherboard (socket 754), as well as
versions for future Intel socket designs.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, given that 64-bit doesn't mean squat on machines with less than 4 GB
memory, what happens in 2038 when the UNIX clock rolls over?  Will we
all have to switch to 64-bit anyway or else?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm putting this all in my huge case from two years ago, the one whose
mobo was apparently water-damaged in my fire.  Maybe I can get the neon
tubes in front to light up this time.  I looked through my old receipts
to figure out what speed chip was in there without prying off the
heatsink.  Cyrix/66, AMD Duron/150....  Was it really that slow?  The
mobo manual said it could take a chip up to 1800.  At the time I
thought, "That's three times faster than I'll ever need...."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I put the "300" on in case somebody should come up with a Pentium/70
or something.  The bandwidth question should be obvious.  If I've put
in unhelpful assumptions without realizing it, please tell me what they
are so the questions can be improved.

In my opinion, there's no way to get an accurate picture of what the
situation really is unless you travel to India, Africa, South America
(however you choose to define it), etc., and spend a few months
traipsing a wide area and taking a census - and even that data would be
of limited use since it's a constantly-changing variable.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, in short, my problem with the way the question is phrased is that
the answers to it *can't* give any new insight. They can, however, be
used to stack the cards. I'm not accusing you of doing this, but I am
saying that this form of the question is not useful.

I've just returned from Uganda for a Development project on Linux
and Open Source software in general.
Apart from giving a course on Linux system administration I helped setup
a local mirror with open source software and more importantly
documentation. Among the documentation was the <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> (LDP) including The Linux
Gazette.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Due to poor bandwidth offerings in Uganda we've resorted to updating
this mirror using a portable harddisk that gets filled in Europe and
sent through diplomatic snailmail to Uganda on a quarterly basis.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I don't think hardware is that much an issue. In Uganda the issue
definitly is bandwidth. I work for a foundation that partners with a
rural university, bandwidth there is 64k down <TT>/</TT> 16k upload for the
entire university which has to be shared with 400+ students and 50+ staff.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Internet slows down to a crawl during the daytime........ (500B/s or less)

Common offerings from local ISP's are 16Kbit links for $50/month, if
you're living in the capital, otherwise you're out-of-luck or dependant
on local NGO's with internet access <TT>/</TT> cyber cafes.

Unlike India, telephonelines are non-existant. Nearly everyone has a
mobile phone, <EM>normal</EM> phone lines are only present in some government
buildings, large companies and possibly NGO's. The quality of the
phonelines is horrible.

<blockQuote>
Although I'm not entirely sure, I think that the entire country has
something in the order of a 4-6Mbit link to the rest of the internet.

At an ICT-conference I visited somebody quoted a $8000 figure for a

We (eacoss) currently operate the only local open source mirror in
Uganda and we're unable to update it through the internet. We would not
be affected that much by this change because of the update-method for
our mirror however other people in the eastern african region might.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That said, the other point that kapil raised, also holds true for Uganda
and Eastern Africa in general. Linux/Opensource software is not (yet)

There is support for an IBM softmodem in the kernel, and there was a
project to get some Lucent modems working, though that pretty much fell
by the wayside. There is a software modem available, though it only goes
as far as 28.8 (the author shifted focus to other nifty things like tcc,
qemu, and ffmpeg).

The lucent modem <TT>/</TT> Linux situation seems to parallel that of the nVidia
graphics cards, in that proprietary binary modules link to the kernel
using the same or similar methods.  Although hardware UART modems will
undoubtedly remain preferrable for Linux users, I've always had pretty
good luck with the Lucent modems.  As winmodems go, they're probably one
of the easier varieties to deal with.  Not to say that they won't be a
pain when you find yourself dealing with a combination of kernel and
libgcc for which they haven't issued an update, but for me, that's
happened only once in the 8 yrs or so that I've been dealing with them.

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

No, there actually is some open source software that accesses Lucent
modems from user-space. It doesn't work as a modem, but the author just
wanted to be able to use it as a phone. Someone else tried to couple
that work with the software modem I mentioned, but I don't know if it
works at all.

Hi!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I installed last summer Suse Linux 9.0 with <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> to my laptop(thinkpad 600e,
233mzh pentium 2). I haven't used a linux before, and it seems to work fine

I think that's true for pretty much any OS - the hardware in laptops,
other than perhaps memory and hard drives, is nearly all proprietary
(i.e., you can't run out to your local computer store and buy an, e.g.,
video card for your Toshiba or Dell), and this has obvious results.

In my apartment house they use the already existing phone-cable to access
internet, therefore i needed to buy a pcmcia card(smc 8041tx v.2) and a
HomePNA converter(A-Link HomePNA) to gain access to the internet.

This card is supported under pcmcia-cs, at least according to
<A HREF="http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/SUPPORTED.CARDS"
	>http://pcmcia-cs.sourceforge.net/ftp/SUPPORTED.CARDS</A> . The easiest
thing to do would have been to install the package from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.suse.com"
	>ftp://ftp.suse.com</A> ... unfortunately, you went a different route. The
<EM>next</EM> easiest thing, in my opinion, would be to reverse what you've
done, then install the package.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Keeping on with trying to install from source is <em>  not  </em> something I would
recommend for you, particularly because this <EM>is</EM> a standard package;
what you'll have, if you do manage to succeed, is a system in which the
PCMCIA package is a) not recognized by the packaging system, and is b)
not upgradeable - except through more source-based installation - as a
result. In other words, you'll be creating a permanent headache for
yourself.

                        Linux Driver Installation

Installation Guide:

1. Please download the pcmcia package (3.1.29 or higher vision)
   from the follow url:
   ftp://www.sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/pcmcia

2. Install the package:
   Copy the pcmcia packagefile into /usr/src/linux/
   and uncompress it:
           tar zxvf pcmcia-cs-3.1.29.tar.gz

3. Config the pcmcia package
   Change the directory into pcmcia
       cd pcmcia-cs-3.1.29
   then config and install it
        make config
         make install

4. Edit the /etc/pcmcia/config
   Add following to the config file
        device "SMC 80412"
         class "network" module "pcnet_cs"
   and add the following configuration:
         card "SMC 80412"
         version "SMC" , "8041TX-10/100-PC-Card-V2", "", ""
        bind "pcnet_cs"

5. Restart the pcmcia service
        /etc/rc.d/init.d/pcmcia restart
   Then the SMC 10/100 PC Card (SMC8041 V.2) adapter will start to work.

The tarball you have may have been damaged, or you may need more
software. The easy way to tell is usually my examining the log file
produced by "make"... but, again, note that this is all theoretical for
the moment: the right thing to do is reverse what you've done so far and
install the actual "pcmcia-cs" package.

message tells, i tried unpacking the package several times, but the message
repeats. As i completed the instruction points 4 and 5, the light turned on
in the pcmcia card, but there is still no connection.
</STRONG></P>

My questions are; firstly, how to configure the card properly and secondly,
how to tell the firewall to mind the pcmcia card, or does the firewall detect

I've addressed the first question already; as to firewalls, they work
with <em>  interfaces,  </em> not hardware. In other words, a firewall doesn't

is rules for, e.g. "eth0".

[chuckle] You didn't really need to reboot - there's almost never a need

but there are times when it may be easier to do that than all the

In general, our foreign correspondents do a fine job of asking good
questions; ronen, obviously, has missed on that count (I originally
received his email at our "tag-kb" address, which is used for contacting
the KnowledgeBase maintainer.) However, since his question <EM>is</EM> of broad
interest to new Linux users, we'll let him off with a term in a
chroot(1) jail and a careful reading of "Asking Questions of The Answer
Gang" at <A HREF="../tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A> for future
reference - and I'll see if we can make this into a useful exchange.
(I'm feeling particularly pedantic today; as a net.friend once said, "it
gets me chicks.")

So, to ask the question that ronen (theoretically) was trying to ask:

Hi there, Answer Gang! I'd like to know how to open .tgz and .zip files
under Linux. The standard documents are confusing, searching the Internet
gives me too many results, and I don't know where else to look.  I'd
appreciate your help.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<blockQuote>
Why, hi there, ronen! Nice of you to ask in such a clear,
understandable, and polite manner and give me a chance to pontificate on
the topic!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There are a number of ways to deal with compressed files in Linux. One
that's probably easiest for the new user is to use Midnight Commander's
"VFS" (Virtual File System) feature - you simply place the highlight on
the name of the compressed file you want and press the 'Enter' key. This
will let you look inside the file and copy out anything you want. The
default VFS setup handles bzip, bzip2, gzip, compress, ar, zip, jar,
xpi, zoo, lha, and arj compressed formats (assuming that you have the
appropriate decompression software installed.) You can run Midnight
Commander by typing "mc" at the command line, either in the console or
in an xterm window if you're running X.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you want to do it manually, typing the name of the appropriate
decompressor (possibly followed by options) and the name of the file to
decompress at the command line should do it - but beware of "file
scatter", i.e., what happens when the person who created the file did
not use a directory structure to contain all the files. These will now
be scattered all over the directory into which you've decompressed them
- usually the current one. In general, it's a Good Idea to list the
files before decompressing the archive - or look into the file with
Midnight Commander, as mentioned above - just so you know what to expect.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Some examples of listing syntax for various decompressors:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre># Gzipped tar file
tar tzf file.tgz

# tar file compressed with bzip2
tar tjf file.tar.bz2

# zipfile
unzip -l file.zip

# ARJ file
unarj l file.arj
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Typing the name of the decompression program followed by '-h' or
'--help', just as is suggested at the very top of "Asking Questions of
The Answer Gang" at (<A HREF="../tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A>),
will show you the option list for that program.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You can also use one of several GUI decompression tools, such as
"guitar" (cute name, eh?) which act somewhat similar to WinZip in
Windows; you may find that environment to be more familiar and
comfortable. Do realize, however, that you'll be missing out on a lot of
the capabilities available at the command line; GUIs are cute, but the
CLI is powerful.

Awesome! Thanks, Jimmy; that damn thing <EM>is</EM> a regular pain. I wish
there was a way to tell Mailman to just delete every single one of them,
but I've never found a way to do so. This way, I can maybe cron it up
and forget about it.

All it does is check that a username and password have been passed, and
if so, regurgitate everything the script sent. It seems to work, based
on the HTML in that sample. If it doesn't work, uncomment the two
'print' statments and send me the results.

This is probably not what you want - you'll just get a hashref as a

I forgot to remove that from the original, when I thought I was using
basic authentication; it prints a hashref, but it also prints the HTTP
status code. Not something to rely on, but it worked well enough to let
me see where I was going wrong (I was forgetting to prepend 'Basic ' to
the base64 encoded user/pass pair).

Well, you said already that it's not getting inside the if statement, which
is strange. If it was that there was a missing value that needed to be
submitted to the form, that'd be one thing, but as it is, only the default
stuff is getting submitted.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Hang on... the first submit works, but that doesn't use
{name =&gt; adminpw, value =&gt; &quot;}, it's {adminpw =&gt; &quot;}; so maybe I should have
the array made up of {$regex_match =&gt; 3}. I'm not so hot with using anything
other than scalars, so you may need to fix the syntax inside the if statement.

Neither; you've never defined a %name hash. What you've got is a

indeed expect a hashref, though. So,
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$name-&gt;{$1} = 3;

<P><STRONG>
should be simply
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$name{$1} = 3;

I was thinking that too. The doubt that was lurking in the back of my mind
came out of hiding: it'd need something extra -- an option to pass message
ids to not delete. (Not a problem, it's just the nagging of the "you're
forgetting something" thought).

Take a look at the regex-based script version I sent you; it would be
easy enough to tweak.

Something like that. Can 'unless' be followed by braces, or would it need
a 'do'?

"do" is pretty special in Perl, and doesn't have anything to do with
conditionals (although it can be used with loops.) Sure, you can have
a statement block after "unless" (it's just syntactic sugar for "!if");
what you can't have is an "elseunless".  :)

<!-- dsrich 27 Dec 2004 - There was no segue from the previous article
here, but this article certainly appears to be a continuation, so I
faked it, calling it the Introduction... -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This article is a continuation of a series in Issues <a href=
"../108/park.html">108</a> and <a href="../109/park.html">109</a>
in which I discuss some of my additions to the standard Linux
shell. In my previous article in Issue 109, I promised to cover
dynamically-loadable builtins related to arrays, regex splitting,
plus interfacing to external libraries like SQL databases and an
XML parser.</p>

<h2>Regex Match</h2>

<p>Modeled after the Awk match() function, I added a new
<code>match</code> builtin for regex(3) matching.</p>

<pre>
    match [-23] string regex [submatch]
</pre>

<p>It returns success (0) if 'string' contains 'regex' pattern. If
the 'submatch' array variable is specified, then by default, it
will contain all matching substrings corresponding to the entire
'regex' and any parenthesized groups in 'regex'. E.g.</p>

<pre>
    match Aabc123Z '([a-z]+)([0-9]+)' a         # a=(abc123 abc 123)
</pre>

<p>where 'abc123' matches the entire 'regex', 'abc' matches the
first group '([a-z])', and '123' matches the second group
'([0-9]+)'.</p>

<p>For the <code>-2</code> option, 'submatch' will contain 2 elements,
non-matching preamble and leftover postamble (ie. before and after
the 'regex'). For <code>-3</code> option, 'submatch' will contain 3
elements, the preamble, the matching string, and the postamble.
E.g.</p>

<pre>
    match -2 Aabc123Z '([a-z]+)([0-9]+)' a      # a=(A Z)
    match -3 Aabc123Z '([a-z]+)([0-9]+)' a      # a=(A abc123 Z)
</pre>

<p>where 'A' and 'Z' are the string segments before and after the
'regex', respectively.</p>

<p>You now have 3 different ways of doing regex matching:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<code>[[ string =~ regex ]]</code> conditional
test in standard Bash-3.0, which uses BASH_REMATCH as the array
variable,

<li>
the new extended 'case' statement,
which uses SUBMATCH as the array variable, and

<li>
<code>match</code> builtin command, where you can specify the array
variable and what it should contain.
</ol>

<h2>Stack and Queue</h2>

<p>Quite often, you need to implement a "stack" or "queue" data
structure. In shell, you can use positional parameters or an array
to hold the data, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    set -- {a--z}
    set -- $@ Z                 # append to queue
    set -- A $@                 # push to stack
    set -- $2 $1 ${@:3}         # swap first 2 items in stack
    shift 2                     # pop 2 items off the stack
    set -- ${@|:-5:} ${@|::-5}  # rotate queue to the right by 5
    set -- ${@|:5:} ${@|::5}    # rotate queue to the left by 5
</pre>

<p>This is acceptable for a throw-away script, but is very
inefficient because of all the copying of data back and forth.</p>

<p>Here are builtin implementations of stack and queue operations.
They directly manipulate positional parameters or arrays (with
<code>-a</code> option), in-place without copying the data. They are
<em>fast</em> and suitable for general purpose "toolbox" work.</p>

<p><code>pp_pop [-a array] [n]</code>

<p>Deletes N (default 1) positional parameters or array elements.
Same as 'shift' builtin for positional parameters, except that it
will pop items if possible. It returns error if the parameter or
array is empty.</p>

<p><code>pp_push [-a array] arg...</code>

<p>Inserts arguments at the beginning of positional parameters or
array. E.g.</p>

<pre>
    set -- 1 2 3
    pp_push a b c
    echo $*             # a b c 1 2 3
</pre>

<p><code>pp_append [-a array] arg...</code>

<p>Appends arguments at the end of positional parameters or array.
E.g.</p>

<pre>
    set -- 1 2 3
    pp_append a b c
    echo $*             # 1 2 3 a b c
</pre>

<p><code>pp_swap [-a array]</code>

<p>Swaps the first 2 parameters (ie. $1, $2) or array elements. It
returns error if the parameter or array does not have at least 2
items to swap.</p>

<p><code>pp_set [-a array] arg...</code>

<p>Sets the argument(s) as new positional parameters or array.
Equivalent to</p>

<pre>
    set arg...
    set -A array arg...         # from Ksh
</pre>

<p><code>pp_overwrite [-a array] arg...</code>

<p>Overwrite the parameter(s) in-place. For an array, this is
equivalent to</p>

<pre>
    set +A array arg...         # from Ksh
</pre>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre>
    set -- 1 2 3 4 5 6
    pp_overwrite a b c
    echo $*             # a b c 4 5 6
</pre>

<p><code>pp_rotateleft [-a array] [n]</code>

<p>Rotate N (default 1) positional parameters or array elements to
the left.</p>

<p><code>pp_rotateright [-a array] [n]</code>

<p>Rotate N (default 1) positional parameters or array elements to
the right.</p>

<p><code>pp_flip [-a array]</code>

<p>Flip the order of positional parameters or array elements.
E.g.</p>

<pre>
    set -- {a--z}
    pp_flip
    echo $*             # z y x ... a
</pre>

<p>The above example can be rewritten as,</p>

<pre>
    set -- {a--z}
    pp_append Z         # append to queue
    pp_push A           # push to stack
    pp_swap             # swap first 2 items in stack
    pp_pop 2            # pop 2 items off the stack
    pp_rotateright 5    # rotate queue to the right by 5
    pp_rotateleft 5     # rotate queue to the left by 5
</pre>

<h2>Transpose and Sort</h2>

<p>Transpose and sort problems come up a lot when dealing with
tables. Although there are utilities such as awk(1), and sort(1) to
handle these functions, in order to use them you have to pipe the
data (or write a file) to the external program, then read the
program's output back and re-parse it to collect the re-ordered
data. For well-behaved line-oriented text data this is possible,
but it is much better to have a dedicated shell solution, especially
when you have the data already parsed and simply want to re-order
it.</p>

<p><code>pp_transpose [-a array] n</code>

<p>Transpose positional parameters or array representing matrix
ordered by rows into a sequence that is ordered by columns. N is
the size of row. For example, given a sequence (1 2 3 4 a b c d),
representing 2x4 array with 2 rows (1 2 3 4) and (a b c d),</p>

<pre>
    | 1 2 3 4 |         | 1 a |
    | a b c d |   ==&gt;   | 2 b |
                        | 3 4 |
                        | 4 d |
</pre>

<p>the transposed sequence is (1 a 2 b 3 c 4 d), representing 4x2
array with 4 rows (1 a), (2 b), (3 c), and (4 d).</p>

<pre>
    set -- 1 2 3 4 a b c d
    pp_transpose 4
    echo $*             # 1 a 2 b 3 c 4 d

    pp_transpose 2      # back to original sequence
</pre>

<p>An equivalent solution in pure shell would go (very slowly)
like</p>

<pre>
    set -- 1 2 3 4 a b c d
    eval set -- $(
        for i in `seq 4`; do 
            for j in `seq $i 4 $#`; do 
                echo '"${'$j'}"'
            done
        done
    )
    echo $*             # 1 a 2 b 3 c 4 d
</pre>

<p><code>pp_sort [-a array]</code>

<p>Sort positional parameters or array in ascending order. If the
array is integer type, then numerical sorting is done, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    a=( {10..1} )
        pp_sort -a a
        echo ${a[*]}            # 1 10 2 3 ... 9 (string sort)
    declare -i a
        pp_sort -a a
        echo ${a[*]}            # 1 2 3 ... 9 10 (integer sort)
</pre>

<h2>Array Operations</h2>

<h3>Array cat</h3>

<p><code>arraycat [-a array] a [b ...]</code>

<p>Prints array elements, one array at a time. If the <code>-a</code>
option is given, then it appends the data to the 'array' variable
instead. This is similar to</p>

<pre>
    printf '%s\n' "${a[@]}" "${b[@]}}" ...
    array=( "${a[@]}" "${b[@]}}" ... )
</pre>

<p>except that you're using variable references like the strcat()
and strcpy() builtins discussed in the previous articles.</p>

<h3>Array map</h3>

<p>In Python (and some other functional languages), you can apply a
function to each element of array without manually looping through.
If there are 2 or more arrays, then elements are taken from all of
the arrays in parallel. I've added a shell version of the Python
map() function:</p>

<p><code>arraymap command a [b ...]</code>

<p>Run 'command' with arguments taken from array elements in
parallel. It should take as many positional parameters as there are
arrays. This is equivalent to</p>

<pre>
    command "${a[0]}" "${b[0]}" ...
    command "${a[1]}" "${b[1]}" ...
    ...
    command "${a[N]}" "${b[N]}" ...
</pre>

<p>where N is the maximum of all indexes. Array elements are
referenced by index, not by the order of storage. So, there can be
empty parameters.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre>
    unset a b;  a=(1 2 3)  b=(4 5 6)
    func () { echo $1$2; }
    arraymap func a b           # join in parallel: 14 25 36

    func () { echo $(($1 + $2)); }
    arraymap func a b           # add in parallel: 5 7 9
</pre>

<h3>Array zip and unzip</h3>

<p>The names come from the workings of a

<!-- dsrich 28 Dec 2004 - Is this Zipper TM supposed to be humor?
It seems like he is referring to the garden variety clothing zipper,
no trademark?  A quick web search failed to turn up any likely candidates
for programs that would deserve this, just lots of PKZip clones. -->

zipper. You start with two rows of teeth; and, when
you zip-up, you get one row of interleaved teeth. Consider arrays
x=(x1 x2 x3 ... xn) and y=(y1 y2 y3 ... yn). Zipping produces a
single array xy=(x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ... xn yn) which consists of
interleaved elements of 'x' and 'y' arrays. Of course, unzipping
does the reverse.</p>

<pre>
       y1    y2    y3 ... yn   ==&gt;   x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 ... xn yn
    x1    x2    x3 ... xn
</pre>

<p>Here are 2 new builtins to "zip" and "unzip" directly within
Bash shell.</p>

<p><code>arrayzip [-a array] name ...</code>

<p>Print array elements, one by one, going across the arrays in
parallel. If <code>-a</code> option is given, then append to the array
variable instead. Array elements are referenced by index, not by
the order of storage, so there can be empty parameters. This is
shell version of Python zip() function, and is equivalent to</p>

<pre>
    arraymap 'printf "%s\n"' name ...
    arraymap 'pp_append -a array' name ...
</pre>

<p><code>arrayunzip -a array name...</code>

<p>Inverse of 'arrayzip'. Sequentially appends items from 'array'
into 'name' array variables, moving across one row at a time.
Output variables are flushed first. If there are not enough input
items, then the null (empty) string is appended to the leftover
variables.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre>
    x=(1 2 3 4)  y=(a b c d)
    arrayzip -a xy x y
    declare -p xy               # xy=(1 a 2 b 3 c 4 d)

    unset x y
    arrayunzip -a xy x y
    declare -p x y              # back to original
</pre>

<p>You can also use array commands to extract rows or columns in a
transposition problem. E.g.</p>

<pre>
    row1=(1 2 3 4)  row2=(a b c d)
    arraycat -a table row{1..2}
    arrayunzip -a table col{1..4}
    declare -p col{1..4}        # (1 a), (2 b), (3 c), (4 d)
</pre>

<h2>Putting Items into an Array</h2>

<p><pre>array [-gG glob] [-iInN a:b] [-jspq string] [-evwrR regex]
[-EVfc command] name arg...</pre>

<p>Given a list of items on the command-line, this new builtin
appends the selected items into an array variable. It is designed
to be called repeatedly, so you should create or flush the array
variable beforehand. Its many options control how and what items to
select.</p>

<h3>Content filtering</h3>

<p>The following options are command-line versions of parameter
expansion ${var|...}.</p>

<p><code>-f filter</code> Append 'arg', only
if 'filter arg' returns success (0). Otherwise, skip to next
'arg'.</p>

<p><code>-c command</code> Append the stdout
of command substitution `command arg`, only if there is an output.
Otherwise, skip to next 'arg'.</p>

<p><code>-i a:b</code> Extract Python-style 

<!-- dsrich 28 Dec 2004 - What does this notation mean? -->

[a:b] substring from each 'arg', ie. arg[a:b], arg[a:b], ...</p>

<p><code>-I a:b</code> Complement of
<code>-i</code>, ie. [:a] + [b:]</p>

<p><code>-n a:b</code> Extract Python-style
[a:b] range from 'arg' sequence, ie. [arg,arg,...][a:b]</p>

<p><code>-N a:b</code> Complement of
<code>-n</code>, ie. [:a] + [b:]</p>

<p><code>-g glob</code> Append 'arg'
matching 'glob' pattern.</p>

<p><code>-r regex</code> Append 'arg'
matching 'regex' pattern.</p>

<p><code>-G glob</code> Complement of
<code>-g</code>.</p>

<p><code>-R regex</code> Complement of <code>-r</code>.</p>

<!-- dsrich 28 Dec 2004 - The following paragraph does not make sense
as written, "Minor differences" from what? Python?  Editted for grammar
only. -->

<p>There are minor differences between the above mechanism and standard
parameter expansion. <code>-i</code> option extracts a substring from each
item, and the <code>-n</code> option extracts a subrange from the argument
list.  Options <code>-I</code> and <code>-N</code> selects the inverse of
<code>-i</code> and <code>-n</code>, respectively, which are not available
in ${var|...}.</p>

<h3>String join and split</h3>

<p>Joining and splitting strings are very common operations. In
Python, you have string.join() and string.split(). Now, you can do
them in Bash also.</p>

<p><code>-j sep</code>

<p>Join all 'arg' with 'sep' separator, and append the resulting
string. E.g.</p>

<pre>
    a=()                # 'unset a' if 'a' already exists.
    array -j '.'  a  11 22 33 44
    array -j '---'  a  abc 123
    declare -p a                # a=(11.22.33.44 abc---123)
</pre>

<p><code>-s sep</code>

<p>Split 'arg' by 'sep' separator, and append each segment to the
array. If 'sep' is null, then each char itself becomes an entry.
E.g.</p>

<pre>
    a=()
    array -s '.'  a  11.22.33.44
    array -s '---'  a  abc---123
    declare -p a                # a=(11 22 33 44 abc 123)
</pre>

<p><code>-p begin</code>

<p><code>-q end</code>

<p>Extract strings which are enclosed by 'begin' and 'end'
delimiters from 'arg'. Append both matching (excluding the
delimiters) and non-matching string segments to the array
sequentially. If both 'begin' and 'end' are null or if one option
is missing, then splitting is not done. E.g.</p>

<pre>
    a=()
    array -p 'abc' -q 'xyz'  a  abc123xyz789
    declare -p a                # a=(123 789)
</pre>

<p>You can call the command repeatedly, and the results are
appended to the end of array variable.</p>

<h3>Regex split</h3>

<p>Practically, all modern scripting languages can split string on
regex pattern, or replace the matching segment using callback
function. Now, so can Bash, and more.</p>

<p><code>-e regex</code>

<p>Extract 'regex' patterns from 'arg', and append each matching
string. (think egrep -e) E.g.</p>

<pre>
    unset a;  a=()
    array -e '[a-z]+'  a  abc123xyz789
    declare -p a                # a=(abc xyz)
</pre>

<p><code>-v regex</code>

<p>Remove 'regex' patterns from 'arg' strings, and append each
non-matching string. Matching strings are skipped, like IFS
whitespace. (think egrep -v). This option is analogous to Awk
split() or Python re.split(), in that you're left with non-matching
segments. E.g.</p>

<pre>
    array -v '[a-z]+'  a  abc123xyz789
    declare -p a                # a=(... 123 789)
</pre>

<p><code>-w regex</code>

<p>Similar to <code>-e</code> and <code>-v</code> option, but both matching
and non-matching strings are sequentially added, so that joining
the array with null (empty) string will give back the original
data.</p>

<pre>
    array -w '[a-z]+'  a  abc123xyz789
    declare -p a                # a=(... abc 123 xyz 789)
</pre>

<p>You can specify regex(7) patterns with the <code>-evw</code> options
above. Unlike the <code>-s</code> option, null segments are not
appended, since they are rarely useful in regex splitting. If the
'nocaseglob' shell option is set, then regex matching is
case-insensitive, just like glob matching.</p>

<h3>Callback function and substitution</h3>

<p>So far, we are chopping up the command-line items and collecting
the pieces. You can also transform the pieces using a
<em>callback</em> command and use the result instead of the
original content, just like ${var|command} or <code>-c command</code>
option. However, if you collect the matching segments and the
non-matching segments separately, you lose the relative order of
those segments. What is needed is to apply the callback command to
each item just before appending the item to the array variable.</p>

<p><code>-E command</code><br>
For each matching string, append `command matching [group...]` to
the array. The command line consists of the matching string and all
parenthesized groups (if any). For the <code>-p and -q</code> options,
command substitution `command inside` will be called where 'inside'
is matching segment without the delimiters.</p>

<p><code>-V command</code><br>
For each non-matching string, append `command non-matching` to the
array.</p>

<p><code>The-EV</code> options are independent and take effect only if
<code>-evwpq</code> options are specified. 'command' can be any command
you can type on your command line. This is a generalized form of
regex substitution.</p>

<p>For example, to increment numbers by 1 and capitalize
non-numbers,</p>

<pre>
    a=()
    addone () { echo $(($1 + 1)); }             # add 1
    upper () { tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' &lt;&lt;&lt; "$1"; }       # to uppercase
    array -w '[0-9]+' -E addone -V upper  a  abc123xyz789
    declare -p a                # a=(ABC 124 XYZ 790)
</pre>

<h2>HTML Template (BAsh Server Pages)</h2>

<p>If you can embed Python, Perl, PHP, Java, or VisualBasic within
HTML file, then there is no reason why you can't embed shell script
and process the HTML file through shell. In fact, I've done exactly
that. Here is a new builtin to process template strings with
embedded shell script.</p>

<p><code>basp [-p begin -q end] text...</code><br>
Extract embedded shell scripts which are enclosed within
'&lt;%...%&gt;' delimiters (non-greedy, non-nesting) from text
arguments. Run the scripts at top level, not as command
substitution, and send the output, along with surrounding texts, to
stdout. If there is error, it returns immediately. If <pre>-p and
-q</pre> options are given, then 'begin' and 'end' are used as
delimiters, instead of '&lt;%' and '%&gt;'.</p>

<p>This is shell's answer to PHP, JSP, ASP, and the likes, so I
named it <em>basp</em> (BAsh Server Pages). It is only 70 lines of
C, and its main advantage is that you don't have to learn another
scripting language and syntax. You can continue to use shell which
has been around for 30 years. E.g.</p>

<pre>
    tag=x
    basp '&lt;html&gt; &lt;% printf "&lt;$tag&gt;%s&lt;/$tag&gt; " 1 2 3 %&gt; &lt;/html&gt;'
           # &lt;html&gt; &lt;x&gt;1&lt;/x&gt; &lt;x&gt;2&lt;/x&gt; &lt;x&gt;3&lt;/x&gt;  &lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you have HTML template in a file, then just read it into a
string like</p>

<pre>
    basp "`&lt; file.html`"
</pre>

<p>Because they are running at top level, embedded code-blocks share
data and environment with each other and with the main shell session.
If you want to isolate the main session, run it in a subshell.</p>

<p>A more complicated example might be to get a list of items, then
print a table with 10 consecutive items per row. The template
<code>file.html</code> will look like</p>

<pre>
    &lt;table&gt;
    &lt;%
        set -- {1..40}
        for i in `seq 1 10 $#`; do
            cat &lt;&lt; EOF
    &lt;tr&gt; `printf '&lt;td&gt;%s&lt;/td&gt; ' ${*:i:10}` &lt;/tr&gt;
    EOF
        done
    %&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;
</pre>

<p>Then,</p>

<pre>
    basp "`&lt; file.html`"
</pre>

<p>will produce a 4x10 table which renders to</p>

<pre>
    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
    11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
    21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30
    31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40
</pre>

<p>You can implement the HTML template using the <code>array</code> builtin
from above. Essentially, you extract the script that is between the
'&lt;%...%&gt;' delimiters and run it through <code>eval</code>, and
print non-script to stdout unchanged. So, it would go something
like</p>

<pre>
    a=()
    array -p '&lt;%' -q '%&gt;' -E eval -V echo  a  "`&lt; file.html`"
    arraycat a
</pre>

<p>But, although it works for the example above, you are limited by
the fact that each command substitution is a separate process and
can't share data with other code-blocks. So, if you put 'set --
{1..50}' in another code-block, then it won't work. Besides,</p>

<pre>
    basp "`&lt; file.html`"
</pre>

<p>is less typing.</p>

<h2>Expat XML parser</h2>

<p>I've added a simple interface to the <a href=
"http://www.libexpat.org/">Expat XML parser</a>, so that you can
register callback functions and interact with the XML parser from
the shell. This new builtin will be enabled only if you have Expat
installed. If you don't, then you will need to download/compile/install
Expat, and recompile Bash shell (starting with
<code>./configure</code>).</p>

<pre>
<p><code>xml [-sedicnm command] text...</code>
</pre>

<p>This is the interface to Expat-1.95.8 (from www.libexpat.org)
library. Arguments are fed to the Expat XML parser sequentially.
It returns 1 immediately on any error. If all arguments are processed
without error, then the builtin returns success (0). The argument must
be a single complete XML document, because Expat can handle only one
XML document per parser process.</p>

<p>The parser will invoke the callback commands or handlers that
you specify, with all required parameters on the command-line. The
callbacks will run at the top level, so if you need to protect your
shell environment, run the 'xml' command in subshell. For the moment,
the following options are recognized:</p>

<p><code>-s command</code> start element (Usage: <code>command tag att=value ...</code> ).</p>

<p>The attribute name and value strings are concatenated with '=',
so that 'declare' or 'local' can be used to set shell variables with
the same names as attributes, ie.</p>

<pre>
    declare "$2"        # set the first attribute name
    declare "${@:2}"    # set all attribute names
</pre>

<p><code>-e command</code> end element
(Usage: <code>command tag</code> )</p>

<p><code>-d command</code> character data
(Usage: <code>command data</code> )</p>

<p><code>-i command</code> processing
instruction (Usage: <code>command target data</code> )</p>

<p><code>-c command</code> comment (Usage:
<code>command text</code> )</p>

<p><code>-n command</code> namespace start
(Usage: <code>command prefix uri</code> )</p>

<p><code>-m command</code> namespace end (Usage: <code>command prefix</code> )</p>

<p>For convenience, the name and attributes of start XML elements
are saved in array variable XML_ELEMENT_STACK as a stack, ie.</p>

<p>XML_ELEMENT_STACK[0] = number of
positional parameters (ie. $#)</p>

<p>XML_ELEMENT_STACK[1] = tag (ie.
$1)</p>

<p>XML_ELEMENT_STACK[2] = the first attribute 'key=value' (ie. $2)
...</p>

<p>and the depth of current XML element is stored in shell variable
XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH. They will be removed and decreased,
respectively, at the end of XML element. Essentially, this is
equivalent to doing manually</p>

<pre>
    pp_push -a XML_ELEMENT_STACK  $# "$@"
    ((XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH++))
</pre>

<p>at the start of element, and</p>

<pre>
    pp_pop -a XML_ELEMENT_STACK  $((XML_ELEMENT_STACK[0] + 1))
    ((XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH--))
</pre>

<p>at the end of element.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>To illustrate how it works, consider the following XML
sample:</p>

<pre>
    &lt;root&gt;
        &lt;one a="AA" b="BB"&gt;
            first line
            &lt;two x="XX"/&gt;
            second line
        &lt;/one&gt;
    &lt;/root&gt;
</pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>When &lt;root&gt; element is encountered, it will set</p>

<pre>
    XML_ELEMENT_STACK=(1 root)
    XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH=1
</pre>

<p>and call command registered with <code>-s</code> option with 'root'
as the argument,</p>

<pre>
    command root
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>On encountering &lt;one&gt; element, it will push '3', 'one',
'a=AA', and 'b=BB' onto XML_ELEMENT_STACK and increment
XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH, so that they become</p>

<pre>
    XML_ELEMENT_STACK=(3 one a=AA b=BB 1 root)
    XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH=2
</pre>

<p>Also, it will call the <code>-s</code> callback with the tag and
attributes, like</p>

<pre>
    command one a=AA b=BB
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Similarly, on encountering &lt;two&gt; element, it will push
'2', 'two', 'x=XX' onto XML_ELEMENT_STACK and increment
XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH, which become</p>

<pre>
    XML_ELEMENT_STACK=(2 two x=XX 3 one a=AA b=BB 1 root)
    XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH=3
</pre>

<p>and call the <code>-s</code> callback, like</p>

<pre>
    command two x=XX
</pre>

<p>Since this tag has implicit &lt;/two&gt; element, it will
immediately call command registered with <code>-e</code> option with
'two' as the argument,</p>

<pre>
    command two
</pre>

<p>Then, it will pop the current tag and attributes off
XML_ELEMENT_STACK and decrement XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH. Now, they return
to the state they were in before entering 'two' element, ie.</p>

<pre>
    XML_ELEMENT_STACK=(3 one a=AA b=BB 1 root)
    XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH=2
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>On encountering &lt;/one&gt; element, it will call <code>-e</code>
callback,</p>

<pre>
    command one
</pre>

<p>and pop the tag and attributes off XML_ELEMENT_STACK and
decrement XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH, so that they become</p>

<pre>
    XML_ELEMENT_STACK=(1 root)
    XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH=1
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Finally, for &lt;/root&gt; element, it will call <code>-e</code>
callback,</p>

<pre>
    command root
</pre>

<p>and pop the current tag off
XML_ELEMENT_STACK and decrement XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH, returning to
their initial state.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For data such as 'first line' and 'second line', the command
registered with <code>-d</code> option will be called with the data as
argument. Multiple calls are made, if data are multi-line, contains
special character encodings, or broken up by another elements. It
is the user's responsibility to collect these data segments. Here,
<code>strcat</code> would come handy.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Because XML_ELEMENT_STACK is a stack holding the command-line
arguments for all nested elements, you can check it to find out
where you are.</p>

<p>In any callback command, the command-line arguments used at the
start of current element are</p>

<pre>
    arg=( "${XML_ELEMENT_STACK[@]:0:XML_ELEMENT_STACK[0]+1}" )
</pre>

<p>which consists of $# <code>${arg[0]}</code>, the tag name
<code>${arg[1]}</code>, and the attribute names and values
<code>${arg[*]:2}</code> (if any). Similarly, the command-line
arguments used for the immediate parent element are</p>

<pre>
    n=${XML_ELEMENT_STACK[0]}
    arg=( "${XML_ELEMENT_STACK[@]:n+1:XML_ELEMENT_STACK[n+1]+1}" )
</pre>

<p>An easier way would be to rotate the stack, assuming
XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH is deep enough to allow rotation, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    n=${XML_ELEMENT_STACK[0]}
    pp_rotateleft -a XML_ELEMENT_STACK  $((n+1))
    arg=( "${XML_ELEMENT_STACK[@]:0:XML_ELEMENT_STACK[0]+1}" )
    pp_rotateright -a XML_ELEMENT_STACK  $((n+1))
</pre>

<p>To get a list of all nested tag names, you simply filter out
stack items containing '=' (attribute) or all integers ($#). From
inside of &lt;two&gt; element in the above example,</p>

<pre>
    XML_ELEMENT_STACK=(2 two x=XX 3 one a=AA b=BB 1 root)
    echo ${XML_ELEMENT_STACK[*]|~=|^[0-9]+$}            # two one root
</pre>

<p>will give you just the tags. This is equivalent to manually
looping through, like</p>

<pre>
    for i in {1..XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH}; do
        echo ${XML_ELEMENT_STACK[1]}
        pp_rotateleft -a XML_ELEMENT_STACK $((XML_ELEMENT_STACK[0] + 1))
    done
</pre>

<p>So, Bash equivalent to 'outline' example from Expat distribution
would go like</p>

<pre>
    indent='  '
    start () {
        echo "${indent|*XML_ELEMENT_DEPTH-1}$*"
    }
    xml -s start "`&lt; file.xml`"
</pre>

<p>producing</p>

<pre>
    root
      one a=AA b=BB
        two x=XX
</pre>

<h2>GDBM and Associative Arrays</h2>

<p>For some reason, Bash doesn't have a key/value data structure
(called associative array, hash, or dictionary in other scripting
languages.) I've added a wrapper for gdbm(3) with a full set of
operations to create and manipulate disk-based associative
arrays.</p>

<p><code>gdbm [-euikvr] [-KVW array] file [key | key value ...]</code>

<p>Typical usage would be as follows:</p>

<p><code>gdbm file</code> print all
key/\t/value pairs, ie. dict.items()</p>

<p><code>gdbm -k file</code> print all keys,
ie. dict.keys()</p>

<p><code>gdbm -v file</code> print all
values, ie. dict.values()</p>

<p><code>gdbm file key</code> print var[key], ie. ${var[key]}</p>

<p><code>gdbm -r file</code> reorganize database</p>

<p><code>gdbm -K array file</code> save all
keys into array</p>

<p><code>gdbm -V array file</code> save all
values into array</p>

<p><code>gdbm -W array file</code> save all key/value pairs into array
sequentially</p>

<p><code>gdbm file key value</code> store
key/value, ie. var[key]=value</p>

<p><code>gdbm -i file key value</code> store
key/value, only if key is new</p>

<p><code>gdbm -v file key name</code> store value in variable, ie.
name=${var[key]}</p>

<p><code>gdbm -e file</code> test if file is
GDBM database</p>

<p><code>gdbm -e file key</code> test if key
exists</p>

<p><code>gdbm -e file key value</code> test if key exists and value is
var[key]</p>

<p><code>gdbm -u file key</code> delete key,
ie. unset var[key]</p>

<p><code>gdbm -u file key value</code> delete key, only if value is
var[key]</p>

<p>More than one key/value pair can be specified on the command
line, and  all arguments will be processed even if there
is an error. This speeds up data entry, because each 'gdbm' call opens
and closes the database file. If the last value is missing (ie.
there is an odd number of arguments,) then the last key will be
ignored.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre>
    gdbm file.db a 111 b 222 c 333

    gdbm file.db a              # 111
    gdbm file.db b              # 222
    gdbm file.db c              # 333

    gdbm -k file.db             # c a b
    gdbm -v file.db             # 333 111 222

    gdbm -v file.db a x b y c z
    declare -p x y z            # x=111 y=222 z=333

    gdbm -e file.db a                   # does 'a' exist?
    gdbm -e file.db a 111 b 222         # is a==111 and b==222 ?
</pre>

<p>There are many benefits to this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>the database is a single file which
can be copied,</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>the data survives exit and
reboot,</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>other processes can access the
database,</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>the shell can now handle a database which is bigger than
memory.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>Each database comes with its own command-line client program
(ie. 'sqlite', 'mysql', and 'psql'). Athough it is easy to send SQL
statements to the database manager, it can be difficult to bring query results back into
the shell. You have to use stdout or a file, read the table, and
parse the rows and the columns. This is non-trivial for anything but
simple data.</p>

<p>I've added a simple interface to <a href=
"http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>, <a href=
"http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, and <a href=
"http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>:</p>

<p><pre>Lsql [-a array] -d file
SQL...</pre>

<p><pre>Msql [-a array] [-h host -p port
-d dbname -u user -P password ] SQL...</pre>

<p><pre>Psql [-a array] [-h host -p port -d dbname -u user -P
password ] SQL...</pre>

<p>where <code>Lsql</code> is for SQLite, <code>Msql</code> is for MySQL,
and <code>Psql</code> is for PostgreSQL. Of course, if you don't have a
database, then you won't be able to use the corresponding
builtin.</p>

<p>They all work pretty much the same way. They send SQL statements
to the database engine. If there is any query result, they print
to stdout, or (with the <code>-a</code> option) save the data fields into an
array variable, row by row. My intention is not to replace the
client programs, but to make shell script easier to write. For
example, here is  the tutorial example in the SQLite documentation:</p>

<pre>
    Lsql -d file.sqlite \
        "CREATE TABLE tbl1(one VARCHAR(10), two SMALLINT)" \
        "INSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES('hello!',10)" \
        "INSERT INTO tbl1 VALUES('goodbye', 20)"        # use 'set +H'
</pre>

<p>creates a simple table and loads in 2 rows of data. To query it,</p>

<pre>
    Lsql -d file.sqlite "SELECT * FROM tbl1"    # to stdout

    Lsql -a table -d file.sqlite "SELECT * FROM tbl1"
    declare -p table            # table=(hello! 10 goodbye 20)
</pre>

<p>The first will print</p>

<pre>
    hello!  10
    goodbye 20
</pre>

<p>and the second will put the data into array variable
'table'.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This ends this tutorial on my patches to Bash-3.0 shell. Bash
shell is ideal tool for teaching/learning about Linux and
programming, because it is so easy to write C extensions and put
shell handles on them. It is my sincere hope that readers will
stick with shell a little longer before moving on to other
scripting languages. :-)</p>

<h1>Free as in Freedom: Part One: GNU/Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/engel.html">Adam Engel</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<pre>
"How far can free software go? There are no limits, except
when laws such as the patent system prohibit free software
entirely. The ultimate goal is to provide free software to
do all of the jobs computer users want to do--and thus make
proprietary software obsolete."
 -- Richard Stallman (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html</a>)
</pre>

<em>[NOTE: all dialog is culled from email conversations unless otherwise 
noted -- AE]</em>

<p> Time to start rethinking things. We "progressives," (leftists,
anarchists, libertarians, liberals, etc. -- wide spectrum of opinion
usually lumped together by mainstream media under the codename "fringe" or
the even scarier "radical" or "free thinker") who fill hundreds of websites
with our words and images may be making a few corporations very rich in
the process. Corporations whose vision of software as "proprietary"
property, something to own, like land, or employees, with all the rules and
regulations about trespassing and fiddling with "personal" corporate
property, intact.

<p> Diebold. Another "questionable" election. This whole computer voting
scam comes down to a test of freedoms. The freedom of citizens of a
Republic to control their own destinies, or the freedom of corporations of
a global marketplace to control everything up to and including the
citizens' illusions that they are citizens of a Republic the future of
which they control. Scam: a corporation using the law to guard their
proprietary software, the public be damned, though this software is being
used by the public, in public, to decide the future of the (Re)public. This
is not just a computer thing - it's a human rights thing.

<p> Let's take me, for instance, or you:

<p> Unless you paid for every piece of software on your proprietary
operating system, or received it as a gift for your personal use only, or
are using it for work under a license purchased by your employer, you are a
criminal. You stole hundreds, perhaps thousands of dollars -- it's their
call, they can charge whatever they want and that price becomes the "market
value" -- from some of the richest, most powerful people on earth, and for
this you must pay dearly. Heavy fines. Jail time. A criminal record.

<p> Unless... you're running the GNU/Linux operating system and any 
combination of its literally thousands of free software programs and 
applications available for free download off hundreds of websites 
around the world. Then, there's no problem. You're free. But still...

<p> No matter how radical you think you are, both the activist who writes
his incendiary manifesto as a Word .doc and the cop who files the police
report, cutting and pasting radicals into columns of his Windows Graphical
User Interface (GUI) database, are working for Microsoft.

<p> So before you write your next piece on the PATRIOT ACT or the
incredibly shrinking Bill of Rights (some animals are more equal than
others) or any number of breaches of free speech and free choice our
corporate masters are imposing on the world, think about what kind of
software you're using, or rather, whose. Whose software are you using to
email your work to your editor or newsgroup, or representative, and what
kind of software runs the list, blog or website where it will be posted?
Are you and your editor and colleagues defending free speech on your own
free software, or is the whole thing, the writing, coding, and publication,
both by your "progressive" website and its "reactionary" counterparts all
working together to make more money for a few software giants that own the
means of production and the means of reproduction and distribution?

<p> No matter who wins the "battle," it seems, Microsoft, Adobe, Macintosh,
etc. won the war a long time ago by defining the "personal computer" 
and how it's used in public and private, work, play, and education.

<h3>GNU Possibilities</h3>

<p> It all began... (of course it never really all begins anywhere ever,
but sometimes someone steps up and says "No way," so we'll take that as a
beginning, here) around 1983 with Richard Stallman's GNU Manifesto and his
stated goal to create a free operating system.

<p> Yeah, someone's always stating something, but in this case, as millions
of computer users can attest, the guy who stated wasn't just talking.
Stallman, as we shall see, came through. Big Time.

<p> (While GNU/Linux's file system and commands are Unix-like, according 
to Stallman, "it is dangerously misleading to say that GNU is 'based 
on Unix'. Unix is proprietary software, and we could not use any of it. 
 We had to start over, from scratch. That's why it is so important 
that GNU's *Not* Unix." The name "GNU" -- pronounce the "g" -- 
is in fact a recursive acronym for "GNU's Not Unix".)

<p> Stallman already had a track record as one of the most inventive 
programmers around. In 1975 he created the text editor, Emacs, which 
he would re-create, using entirely different code, in 1984, as GNU 
Emacs, one of the first major features of the GNU Operating System. GNU 
Emacs is the de facto text editor of GNU/Linux as well as many 
corporate owned Unixes (it shares proponents and disk space with one of 
the original Unix text editors, 'vi' (and it's powerful free upgrade, 
VIM). When people say Emacs they mean GNU Emacs, though a popular, 
more graphic version, XEmacs, also grew out of GNU Emacs and shares 
much of the same code.

<p> "The revolutionary text editor Emacs that I developed in 1975 was not a
version of anything else. It had nothing to do with Unix, which in 1975 was
hardly known," Stallman emailed me regarding the origins of Emacs.

<p> As a staff member of MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab from 1971 to
1983, Stallman created and worked on important computer stuff and
established himself as a major hacker.

<p> Mainstream media turned "hacker" into a "bad" word to describe bad 
people; hackers are in fact just people who live for programming 
computers and are very good at it. They are proud to call themselves 
hackers and care as much about the media's opinion of their culture 
as they do the media's opinion of the validity of their calling: 
zilch. Unlike, say, the Generic Office Worker in the Generic 
Labyrinth (third cubicle to the left), they don't hang up their titles 
at the end of the day when they get off the train. They are hackers 
24/7, or as long as they live and love to program computers. It's who 
they are, it's what they do. Hackers. This is important.

<p> There are a lot of name distinctions and language manipulations in this 
story, including the distinction between GNU/Linux and what most people 
call plain old Linux. They are all important, for most of the names 
and terms are or were created by the creators themselves, only to have 
them twisted, hyphenated, out-quoted (and out-sourced) by our old 
friend, The Corporation, for the sake of corporate ownership and 
profit.

<p> These are real people who have done real things and have real beliefs. 
These aren't "like, the spaced-out, hacker-snackers on TV, like you 
know, dude?" The success of the GNU/Linux model in standing up for 
freedom -- real freedom, not the freedom to "say no" to medical 
marijuana and live in unnecessary agony or go to jail -- is a 
powerful example of community over the Corporation, and something we, 
especially we who write about freedom and act for freedom should study 
in great detail. Your life will or will not change for the better due 
to the real or imposed outcome of the 2004 Presidential election, or 
who wins, or imagines they do, in 2008. The only way to change your 
life and anyone else's for the better is to help wrest the fate of 
humanity from its current corporate ownership (all rights reserved).

<p> Life is fleeting regardless, but must it also be licensed and subject 
to review and revocation by those who had zero participation in its 
creation and whose only purpose is to excise profit from the 
necessities of its maintenance? Corporate ownership of data, of 
knowledge, can change your life in a big way, especially if you get 
caught using illegal knowledge on your computer or worse, legal 
knowledge without a license.

<p> Again, it started like it often does. Paradigmatic. Like the German
writer Kleist's classic, <strong><em>Michael Kohlhaas</em></strong>
(transliterated into the character Colehouse Porter in E.L. Doctorow's
novel, <strong><em>Ragtime</em></strong>), someone saw his community, his
habitat, and everything in it of value to him destroyed by corporate greed
and laws created and imposed to sanctify these actions, make them seem
"right, the natural order of things," and decided to fight back. This is
the story of his fighting and winning, for a time, for we only win for a
time until things change, everything changes, and even the movement we
thought was ours, the movement we started, moves away from us in every
direction.

<p> Linux is big business, or is on the cusp of becoming big business. It 
can go the way of the corporate citizen, or the free individual. It 
cannot continue the balancing act it has maintained of being both. Or 
can it?

<p> The correct name of the operating system is GNU/Linux, but almost 
everyone in the world refers to it as "Linux." Ben Okopnik, 
Editor-In-Chief of the Linux Gazette (LG) wrote that this is merely a 
matter of convenience:

<blockquote>
"Note that this distinction, much as RMS (Richard Stallman) and others may 
have tried to promote it, did not make it into the common lexicon. Just 
as in the case of the 'X Window System', universally known as 'X', a 
short simple identifier is what people will use when it's available." 
</blockquote>

<p> But it also might have much to do with mythology that has grown up 
around both the Linux kernel and its chief architect, Linus Torvalds. 
Many people believe, and this has been amplified in mainstream media, 
that the "Linux Operating System" was created from scratch by Linus 
Torvalds in 1991, with some help from hackers around the world 
connected via the Internet. This makes for a good story because it 
displays the power of the Internet, especially during GNU/Linux's 
formative years in the hyped-up 1990s, and GNU/Linux is indeed a 
product of collaboration that could only have happened on the Internet. 
Also it presents us with an archetypal hero/genius of the Robin Hood 
ilk who led his band of merry hackers through the proprietary coded 
forests to wreak havoc on the corporate desktop.

<p> Of course it's not so simple.

<p> Linux is the kernel, not the operating system. The kernel is like the 
medulla, the "lizard brain" responsible for the automatic functions of 
the operating system -- for us: breathing, heartbeat, swallowing; for 
computers: background processes, daemons, the ability to read certain 
drivers and communicate with the user via the "shell". If the medulla 
is the kernel in this analogy, and the cerebrum is what it is, whether 
with human bodies or computers, the cerebrum, "us" the conscious 
user/programmer, then the rest of the body is the operating system. 
Arms, legs, eyes, skin. For computers it's the shell (a program 
that serves as the interface between the user and the kernel), and the 
rest of the operating system, consisting of various tools, commands, 
programs and the libraries that run them.

<p> The Unix and GNU/Linux system libraries are code that allows the 
system to recognize and execute various functions, including 
communicating with itself and recognizing that "it computes, therefore 
it exists." In order to have a complete Unix or GNU/Linux operating 
system you need a kernel and a system of programs, tools, and 
commands, including the shell. Without the rest of the system, the 
kernel isn't very useful. Sort of like a medulla on a plate.

<p> The system of tools that enabled the Linux kernel to merge into a
functional operating system existed at the time of Linux's release in
1991. That operating system was developed by Richard Stallman and other
hackers, many from the Free Software Foundation (<a
href="http://www.fsf.org">FSF</a>), and it was called GNU. Its development,
essential but often neglected in importance, was a revolutionary move.

<p> After I mentioned a series of common programs, utilities and 
applications, Stallman emailed me, "All programs that run on GNU/Linux 
are linked with GNU 'libc'. 'libc' [part of the GNU/Linux library] is the 
only way most programs talk to Linux."

<p> Perhaps the only development that rivals the creation of the GNU 
operating system, in terms of protecting the freedoms of software 
users, programmers and documentation writers are the copyleft licenses, 
such as the GNU General Public License (GPL) for software, and the 
various others for documentation.

<p> Stallman wrote, "<em>Copyleft</em> is a technique used in unilateral copyright 
licenses. The technique is to require modified versions to be under 
the same license. One can design the details in many different ways. 
For instance the GNU GPL and the GFDL are both copyleft licenses--the 
former primarily meant for software, the latter primarily meant for 
documentation--and their requirements are quite different."

<p> Since the creation of the GNU GPL there have been many variations to 
serve specific needs, but the essence is the same: copyleft ensures 
that software code and the documentation of how to use that code 
remain, to quote Stallman, "free as air."

<p> When Stallman worked through the seventies at the AI lab at MIT, things 
were different. There was no market, hence no marketplace. Programmers 
and other computer users routinely shared files and software. 
Everything was "open source" simply because there wasn't much around. 
They were creating it. Even corporate-owned software, tools, and 
systems -- the C language, the Unix System, the Internet, etc. -- had to 
be invented before they could be locked away, given away, or shared 
according to what could or could not be feasibly controlled and by what 
means.

<p> "When I started working at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971,
I became part of a software-sharing community that had existed for many
years. Sharing of software was not limited to our particular community; it
is as old as computers, just as sharing of recipes is as old as cooking...
We did not call our software "free software", because that term did not yet
exist; but that is what it was. Whenever people from another university or
a company wanted to port and use a program, we gladly let them. If you saw
someone using an unfamiliar and interesting program, you could always ask
to see the source code, so that you could read it, change it, or
cannibalize parts of it to make a new program," Stallman wrote on the GNU
web site (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html</a>).

<p> But once the corporate sector figured out how to make money and that
there was money to be made, things changed. The "community" that Stallman
worked with during the seventies, developing the prototypes for what we
take for granted as the modern operating systems of today, was gone by
1981, hired away by corporations arming themselves for the coming computer
market wars, or prohibited, by non-disclosure laws of proprietary systems,
from exercising the kind of freedom that resulted in creativity and
experimentation.

<p> Stallman wrote, "This meant that the first step in using a computer was 
to promise not to help your neighbor. A cooperating community was 
forbidden. The rule made by the owners of proprietary software was, 
'If you share with your neighbor, you are a pirate. If you want any 
changes, beg us to make them. The idea that the proprietary-software 
social system - the system that says you are not allowed to share or 
change software - is antisocial, that it is unethical, that it is simply 
wrong, may come as a surprise to some readers. But what else could we 
say about a system based on dividing the public and keeping users 
helpless? Readers who find the idea surprising may have taken 
proprietary-software social system as given, or judged it on the terms 
suggested by proprietary software businesses. Software publishers have 
worked long and hard to convince people that there is only one way to 
look at the issue." (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html</a>)

<p> Stallman's questioning of the corporate assumptions that software must
be owned by corporate mediators and licensed to users is examined in detail
on the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU.org</a> site's philosophy pages;
e.g., arguments for free software (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-free.html</a>)
and against terminology such as "intellectual property" (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml</a>).

<p> With the development of GNU, as with most revolutionary movements, 
there was no middle ground for compromise.

<p> Stallman wrote, "With my community gone, to continue as before was
impossible. Instead, I faced a stark moral choice. The easy choice was to
join the proprietary software world, signing nondisclosure agreements and
promising not to help my fellow hacker. Most likely I would also be
developing software that was released under nondisclosure agreements, thus
adding to the pressure on other people to betray their fellows too. I could
have made money this way, and perhaps amused myself writing code. But I
knew that at the end of my career, I would look back on years of building
walls to divide people, and feel I had spent my life making the world a
worse place." (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html</a>)

<p> The history of his response to this choice can be found in extensive
detail on the GNU.org site. What Stallman did, in a nutshell, was to write
The GNU Manifesto (<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html</a>)
in which he explained to his fellow hackers and the computer using
community at large the issues they faced and his determination to create a
fully functional Unix-like operating system, but written from scratch, with
no proprietary code, and absolutely free. His goal was to make it as good
as or better than Unix -- and in this, many agree, he succeeded; various
GNU tools, programs, applications and components (such as the C library and
compiler, GCC) are faster, more robust, and offer more options than their
proprietary counterparts. But even if he had to fall short of that goal in
order to keep GNU absolutely free, he would have done so.

<p> It is in this spirit that the GNU GPL and other copyleft licenses and
declarations of "non-ownership" are based. The creation of the copyleft
type of license is as radical as the creation of the GNU software itself.
It takes the corporate idea of "ownership" and "copyright" created to
serve a few at the expense of the many, inside out, and upside down. In
order for code to be considered Free Software and therefore useable under
the GNU GPL, it must be accessible to all. Anyone can change it,
customize it, or make improvements on it, so long as the original code and
authorship is included and this new code is also open for others to examine
and modify, whether for personal customization or general improvement.

<p> One misconception is that "free software" means that one cannot charge
money for it. In fact, the opposite is the case. In the early days the FSF
earned the bulk of its funding not through donations, but sales of its
manuals, hard-copy books, and software. Though this is no longer true
today, the <a href="http://www.fsf.org">FSF</a> still sells software
documentation and books on their website.

<p> "Free as in free speech, not free beer" is the GNU slogan that sums it
up best. One is free to charge for such services as distribution or
redistribution of software, writing documentation or new software based on
the original GPL code, etc., so long as the source remains free, prior
versions and authors are listed, and other rules of the GNU GPL are
followed.

<p> While it is possible to download the Linux kernel, all of GNU's several
thousand programs and applications, and the hundreds of third-party
offerings for GNU/Linux, such as the X Windows GUI and window managers, the
KDE desktop environment (which I'll examine in further detail in Part Two
of this article) and many other components, the easiest and least
time-consuming way to obtain GNU/Linux, especially for those who are new to
to it, is to plunk down roughly $30 for a "distribution" on CD or DVD from
companies such as <a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>, <a
href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, <a
href="http://suse.com">SuSE</a>, and others.

<p> These companies make money by gathering all the components of GNU/Linux
under one roof, in addition to adding their own components, such as SuSE's
YaST GUI system manager, or Red Hat's RPM (Red Hat Package Manager)
software bundling application. Nearly all the distributions come with
customized easy-install GUI interfaces for new users.


<h3>GNU + Linux = GNU/Linux?</h3>

<p> While the popularity of GNU/Linux is exploding, Stallman and others 
in the free software community face significant threats from a 
Corporate friendly business environment, always ready to lend a legal 
hand with restrictive copyright law. Then there's the jealous rage of 
Microsoft, who views the FSF and its works as a significant threat 
worth spending a lot of money on (and spending lots of money to make 
people miserable is what Microsoft does best, second only to charging 
lots of money for making people miserable).

<p> But the most serious threat comes from the "Linux" community itself. 
Very few people outside of GNU and the FSF refer to GNU/Linux as 
anything but "Linux." In addition, as with all successful radical 
movements, as we move further in time from the origins of the 
necessary development of free software, people tend to associate less 
with "free software" and more with "Linux" itself, as if it were a 
sports team or some other symbolic source of identification, like 
"America."

<p> Thus, many will root for the success of the nominally free "Linux" over
"Microsoft" in winning the bid for a Government/Military computing contract
or the unofficial "support" of governments, such as China or India and
other political entities supporting the development of GNU/Linux as the
"official state Operating System," or what not. Working for the authorities
to help destroy the Gaea and impinge on freedom is supposed to be the job
of proprietary operating systems, not GNU/Linux! But then, as Stallman
himself said, GNU was developed to solve some of the world's problems, not
all of them. Though the success of GNU and GNU/Linux, representing a
victory of a community of individuals (that began with hundreds and has
grown to millions) over a handful of corporate superpowers forces anyone
who values his/her liberty to pause and wonder: what else is possible?
What else can be done to change this mess for the better?

<p> In response to my confusion regarding the free software versus the 
"open source" movements, Stallman emailed me this information, put 
out by Slackware, a GNU/Linux distribution:

<p>from <em>THE SLACKWARE BOOK</em>: 

<pre class="code">
<em>
<strong>Open Source and Free Software</strong>

Within the Linux community, there are two major ideological movements at
work. The Free Software movement, which we'll get into in a moment, is
working toward the goal of making all software free of intellectual
property restrictions, which it believes hamper technical improvement and
work against the good of the community. The Open Source movement is working
toward most of the same goals, but takes a more pragmatic approach to
them, preferring to base its arguments on the economic and technical merits
of making source code freely available, rather than the moral and ethical
principles that drive the Free Software Movement. The Free Software movement
is headed up by the Free Software Foundation, which is a fund-raising
organization for the GNU project. Free software is more of an ideology.
The oft-used expression is "free speech, not free beer". In essence, free
software is an attempt to guarantee certain rights for both users and
developers. These freedoms include the freedom to run the program for any
reason, the freedom to study and modify the source code, the freedom to
redistribute the source, and the freedom to share any modifications you
make. In order to guarantee these freedoms, the GNU General Public License
(GPL) was created. The GPL, in brief, provides that anyone distributing a
compiled program which is licensed under the GPL must also provide source
code, and is free to make modifications to the program as long as those
modifications are also made available in source code form. This guarantees
that once a program is opened to the community, it cannot be closed
except by consent of every author of every piece of code (even the
modifications) within it. Most Linux programs are licensed under the GPL.

It is important to note that the GPL does not say anything about price. As
odd as it may sound, you can charge for free software. The "free" part is
in the liberties you have with the source code, not in the price you pay
for the software. (However, once someone has sold you, or even given you, a
compiled program licensed under the GPL they are obligated to provide its
source code as well.)

At the forefront of the younger Open Source movement, the Open Source
Initiative is an organization that solely exists to gain support for open
source software. That is, software that has the source code available as
well as the ready-to-run program. They do not offer a specific license, but
instead they support the various types of open source licenses available.

The idea behind the OSI is to get more companies behind open source by
allowing them to write their own open source licenses and have
those licenses certified by the Open Source Initiative. Many companies want
to release source code, but do not want to use the GPL. Since they cannot
radically change the GPL, they are offered the opportunity to provide their
own license and have it certified by this organization.

While the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative work to
help each other, they are not the same thing. The Free Software Foundation
uses a specific license and provides software under that license. The Open
Source Initiative seeks support for all open source licenses, including the
one from the Free Software Foundation. The grounds on which each argues for
making source code freely available sometimes divides the two movements, but
the very fact that two ideologically diverse groups are working toward the
same goal lends credence to the efforts of each.
</em>
</pre>

<p> Thus, Stallman and others in the Free Software movement are opposed to
any compromise that would threaten the initial goal of a free operating
system. For instance, <a href="http://www.kde.org">KDE.org</a>, which
develops a full desktop environment that enables the "average user" to use
GNU/Linux as easily as he/she would Windows or Macintosh, with little or no
knowledge of basic Unix or GNU/Linux commands, utilized a proprietary code
called Qt. Rather than accept this breach of the GPL, GNU developed an
alternative desktop environment called GNOME (www.gnome.org). Fortunately,
KDE licensed Qt under the GPL, so now users have two Windows/Mac-like GUI
environments to choose from. But if push came to shove, those dedicated
to the principles of the free software movement would have stuck with GNOME
even if it was behind scheduled release or was qualitatively inferior to
KDE, while those in the "open source" movement, whose primary goal is the
development of "Linux" into an operating system that will compete on a
global scale with Microsoft, might have accepted the proprietary use of Qt.

<p> Ben Okopnik, Editor-in-Chief of the Linux Gazette, wrote, "The 
proprietary bits of Qt were a problem. They did a tremendously 
intelligent thing by opening it up; KDE, and Qt development in general, 
simply exploded as soon as they did."

<p> But even Stallman admits that there will be other threats to an 
absolutely free software movement, particularly by "open source," 
espoused by corporations who cannot bear even the word "freedom."

<p> Stallman wrote, "Teaching new users about freedom became more difficult
in 1998, when a part of the community decided to stop using the term "free
software" and say "open source software" instead. Some who favored this
term aimed to avoid the confusion of "free" with "gratis"-- a valid goal.
Others, however, aimed to set aside the spirit of principle that had
motivated the free software movement and the GNU project, and to appeal
instead to executives and business users, many of whom hold an ideology
that places profit above freedom, above community, above principle. Thus,
the rhetoric of "open source" focuses on the potential to make high
quality, powerful software, but shuns the ideas of freedom, community, and
principle...The support of business can contribute to the community in many
ways; all else being equal, it is useful. But winning their support by
speaking even less about freedom and principle can be disastrous; it makes
the previous imbalance between outreach and civics education even
worse...."Free software" and "open source" describe the same category of
software, more or less, but say different things about the software, and
about values. The GNU Project continues to use the term "free software", to
express the idea that freedom, not just technology, is important."(<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html</a>).

<p> In my email interview with Stallman, I too made the mistake of equating 
"free" with "open source."

<p> Stallman wrote, "You mentioned the FSF but not the Free Software 
Movement, which leads me to wonder if you have fallen prey to a common 
misunderstanding. Did you know that the Open Source Movement is a 
right-wing reaction against the Free Software Movement, which came 
first? Many people think that I support the Open Source Movement. The 
reason they think so is that the people in the Open Source Movement 
work hard to give that impression. Since they have the support of
corporations and the main media, they have spread this misunderstanding
quite far. But it's as mistaken to label my work as 'open source' as to
label Nader 'Republican'."

<p> Stallman is a visionary and, like Nader, a people's advocate, only more
so. His advocacy stretches beyond the efficiency of consumer goods and laws
protecting consumer rights and into the discussion of the basis of The Law
itself. Who is The Law serving, computer users and programmers, that is,
citizens of a free society, or mere consumers in a market whose rules are
defined and created by the corporations who, should they have their way,
will not merely monopolize the market, but be the market, the only
alternative for those who wish to write and use computer programs?

<p> Stallman and others like him are the incorruptible, uncompromising 
fighters the left has been calling for, all the while we settle for 
the lesser of evils or hope the Democratic Party, the political 
arena's version of the "open source initiative" will somehow manage 
to beat the corporate state while joining it. The struggle to defend 
the basic rights of software users and developers inherent in the free 
software movement and its creation of the GNU/Linux alternative to 
proprietary systems is obvious. This struggle is not merely about 
being free at the computer, but living free everywhere. GNU can't 
solve all the world's problems, but the values it espouses can be 
harnessed in support of any struggle, whether for a clean environment 
or a real democracy, rather than the bloated, trash-talking, murderous 
Empire we think, like those befuddled by the rhetoric of proprietary 
software corporations, we have no choice but to accept as "The Nature 
of Things."

<p> Again, Stallman, linking the rhetoric of epic struggle with its 
counterpart in modern film, writes of a fight worth fighting for, and 
his words resonate, even as we squander lives by the thousands in Iraq:

<p> "Yoda's philosophy ('There is no "try"') sounds neat, but it 
doesn't work for me. I have done most of my work while anxious about 
whether I could do the job, and unsure that it would be enough to 
achieve the goal if I did. But I tried anyway, because there was no one 
but me between the enemy and my city. Surprising myself, I have 
sometimes succeeded... Sometimes I failed; some of my cities have 
fallen. Then I found another threatened city, and got ready for another 
battle. Over time, I've learned to look for threats and put myself 
between them and my city, calling on other hackers to come and join 
me... Nowadays, often I'm not the only one. It is a relief and a joy 
when I see a regiment of hackers digging in to hold the line, and I 
realize, this city may survive--for now. But the dangers are greater 
each year, and now Microsoft has explicitly targeted our community. We 
can't take the future of freedom for granted. Don't take it for 
granted! If you want to keep your freedom, you must be prepared to 
defend it." (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html</a>).

<p> Well, what are we waiting for? Where do we stand?

<h3>What is ParallelKnoppix?</h3>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<img src="misc/hameed/LinuxTag.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="10">

ParallelKnoppix is a Live CD based on Knoppix, which is also a Live CD that
is itself based on the Debian Linux distribution. ParallelKnoppix lets you
create a Linux cluster equipped with parallel programming tools/libraries
such as MPI in just a few minutes. It saves a lot of time that we spend in
configuration of the computing environment. The existing environment is not
disturbed using ParallelKnoppix, since a Live CDs distribution runs without
installation (a directory is created on the Master Node; it can be deleted
after rebooting if desired.)

<p> (From <a href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/">http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/</a>):<br>
<blockquote>
ParallelKnoppix is a re-master of Knoppix that allows setting up a cluster
of machines for parallel processing using the LAM-MPI and/or MPICH
implementations of MPI.  Getting the cluster up and running takes less than
15 minutes, if the machines have PXE network cards.
</blockquote>

<h4>Background</h4>
Clustering is one of the cheapest techniques to achieve parallelism.
Clustering by using Linux is one of the Linux powers. A number of
universities and other organizations mimic supercomputing by connecting PCs
via Ethernet cards under Linux. Linux has been widely adopted by the
scientific community to do their research work since it is loaded with a
number of scientific tools such as LAM, MPI, PVM, and many more, so Linux is
well suited for parallel computing. But the problem is that scientists and
programmers have to do a lot of pre-configuration of the Linux environment.
This makes their task slow and complex.

<p> Now, the Linux gurus have solved this problem by developing Live CDs.
Now the researcher can choose a Live CD to do parallel programming without
the need for long configuration and the cluster is ready within a few
minutes.

<p> One of the Live CDs for parallel programming is <a
href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/">ParallelKnoppix</a>.
Other Live CDs, such as <a href="http://bccd.cs.uni.edu/">BCCD</a> and <a
href="http://bofh.be/clusterknoppix/">ClusterKnoppix</a>, are also
available.

<h4>Description</h4>
Just like its predecessor Knoppix, ParallelKnoppix will detect all
the hardware and peripherals automatically. I have tested it on a D865GBF
Intel P-IV board as well as an Intel 810C (P-III), and ParallelKnoppix
configured all the hardware automatically - nothing else needed to be done.
The computers that are configured using ParallelKnoppix share a common
directory, which is created on master node via NFS (the Network File System).
The Master node is booted using the CD and the slaves are booted using the
network (the Master node runs a DHCP server.) The slaves have PXE-enabled BIOSes
with PXE-compliant NICs.

<p> Each and every service needed for LAM/MPI is configured automatically.
DHCP, NFS, SSH (with passwordless logins) are all set up and running - and
you are ready to experiment with MPI programs and other parallel
applications.

<p> As set up, ParallelKnoppix is not very secure - the Live CD password
for both the regular user and the super user (root) are publicly known.
Anyone with even a little knowledge of ParallelKnoppix can easily access the
ParallelKnoppix cluster. In this case, the ease of setup is obtained by
compromising some security as a trade-off.

<p class="editorial">[ As a general rule of thumb, your ParallelKnoppix
network should be isolated from the Internet, and usually even your
intranet, if security is at all a concern. -- Ben ]</p>

<h4>What is PXE boot?</h4>
PXE is an acronym for the Preboot Execution Environment, a technology that
is used to boot a PC remotely through a network. PXE must be supported by
the system BIOS, and the network interface card needs to be PXE compliant.

<h4>What do I do if my NIC is not PXE-compliant?</h4>
You'll need to either install a ROM chip with an <a
href="http://www.etherboot.org/">Etherboot</a> image on your NIC, or burn a
CD using the image; <a href="http://rom-o-matic.net/">ROM-o-matic.net</a>
dynamically generates Etherboot ROM images.

<h4>Downloading ParrallelKnoppix</h4>
The ISO file is available at the following locations:

<p> via FTP: <a href="ftp://volcano.uab.es/pub/parallelknoppix.iso">ftp://volcano.uab.es/pub/parallelknoppix.iso</a> 

<p> via HTTP: <a href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/parallelknoppix.iso">http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/parallelknoppix.iso</a>

<p> MD5SUM for the image: <a href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/parallelknoppix-2004-12-16.iso.md5">http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/parallelknoppix-2004-12-16.iso.md5</a>

<p> Check the <a href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/">home page</a> if the above links expire.

<p> After downloading the ISO images, check the MD5 checksums against the
ISO images to ensure that your download was successful. Do this by running
the <code>md5sum</code> program from a shell prompt and comparing the
values returned:

<pre>md5sum <em>isofilename</em></pre>

<p> In the above command, replace <em>isofilename</em> with the correct
file name.

<p> If you are for some reason not using Linux, you can use <a
href="http://www.md5summer.com/">md5Summer</a> for Windows.  An MD5 summer
for DOS is also available. 

<p> If the MD5 sums match, burn the ISO images to CDRs or CDRWs.
<i><b>Note: writing the ISOs to CD requires a program such as
<code>cdrecord</code>.</b></i>


<h4>How does it work?</h4>
There is a nice Parallel Knoppix tutorial full of step-by-step
instructions, screen shots of the configuration process, etc., available
<a
href="http://pareto.uab.es/mcreel/ParallelKnoppix/Tutorial/Tutorial.html">here</a>
in HTML format or <a href="http://pareto.uab.es/wp/2004/62604.pdf">here</a>
in PDF.  If you exported your CD-ROM to the nodes, it will easily
accommodate 50 nodes, but more than that have not been tested. I actually
tested only 5 nodes myself.

<h4>What do I do if multiple DHCP servers are running?</h4>
If using this at a university (like I do), you're likely to run afoul of
the "official" DHCP server, and possibly another PXE server. When you try
to boot the nodes using the terminal server, the nodes will often boot from
the pre-existing PXE server, and they will often get their IP addresses
from the official server, not the DHCP server running on the computer that
was booted from the ParallelKnoppix CD. The solution I have so far is to
physically disconnect the computers to be used as nodes from the
pre-existing PXE and/or DHCP servers, or to get help from the
administrators to temporarily disable those servers. If anyone knows a more
elegant solution, I'd like to hear about it. I think it involves messing
around with <code>miniroot.gz</code>, and using Rom-o-Matic to create the
PXE boot ROM. Too horrible for further contemplation... at least for me.

<h4>How it works (Summary)</h4>
The ParallelKnoppix Live CD is used to boot a master node. Once the master
node is up, a script is executed which sets up a DHCP server, shares a
common working directory to all nodes using NFS, generates the public keys
for SSH to work properly (passwordless logins), etc. After DHCP on the
master node is running, the clients (slaves) are booted using PXE boot.
After the successful booting the sample directory is copied to the NFS
shared common directory and programs begin executing in parallel on
multiple PCs.

<h4>My experience</h4>
I am an undergraduate student of computer science and I was given a project
to solve a mathematical problem using MPI in the parallel computing lab. I
chooses ParallelKnoppix as an alternative to demonstrate my MPI program in
the Linux environment. When the master node is booted using the
ParallelKnoppix CD, at some point during the boot it will ask you the
resolution; just enter '6', because it is the maximum resolution mode
supported. After my Master Node booted, I ran the setup script
(<strong><code>K -&gt; ParallelKnopix -&gt; Setup
ParallelKnoppix</code></strong>, per the above tutorial). When the script
had created the DHCP server, I turned on my slave nodes and let them boot
using PXE. All the nodes booted successfully.

<p> I then copied my program to <code>parallel_knoppix_working</code>, and
ran my MPI program in parallel. It was literally that simple.

<p> For compilation, I use
<pre>mpicc myprogram.c -o myprogram.bin</pre> 

<p> For execution, I use
<pre>mpirun C myprogram.bin</pre>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<blockquote>
"The ParallelKnoppix CD provides a very simple and rapid means of setting up
a cluster of heterogeneous PCs of the IA-32 architecture. It is not
intended to provide a stable cluster for multiple users, rather it is a tool
for rapid creation of a cluster for individual use. The CD itself is
customizable, and the configuration and working files can be re-used over
time, so it can provide a long-term solution for an individual user."

<h1>A Knight's Tour on OCaml (when a Python fails to digest it)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

The story begins<sup><a name="text1" href="#note1">1</a></sup>
when my daughter's teacher, who is then busy grading the
end-term examination papers, wanted to give the class
some busy work. So the teacher asked the children to find a ``Knight's
tour''---make a knight jump around on a chess board starting and ending at
the same square and landing on each other square exactly once. Naturally,
this problem landed on my doorstep at the end of the school day---the
teacher happens to know that I do mathematics!

<p> I have heard that this problem has a solution but don't know one---typical
Mathematician---stops at the point where ``solution exists''. So why not
write a program to solve the problem? While the going is good, I could
also use this opportunity to learn to use another programming language.

<p> 

<h2><a name="htoc1"></a>The quick and the dirty</h2>

Let's start by writing a program in a scripting language like
<a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>---it <em>is</em> fun writing a program in
a new language when you are reasonably sure that the code will not
be longer than about a 100 lines!

<p> The key pseudo-code can be stated as follows:
<pre class="code">
      extension of a partial solution =
            if (Length of the partial solution is 64) then
                  if (the solution closes on itself) then
                        return the solution
                  else
                        return false since this is not a solution
            else
                  for each position in available moves
                   that has not already been occupied
                     try  extension of the new partial solution
                           obtained by extending the current solution
                           by this move
</pre>We then start with any position on the chess-board and find an extension of
it by 63 more moves.

<p> This is programmed in Python quite easily. We use the Python ``workhorse''
data structure---the list. A partial solution is a list of positions which
we think of as the sequence of moves.
<pre class="code">
def   extend(soln):
      if len(soln) == 64:
            if soln[-1] in moves(soln[0]):
                  return soln
            else:
                  return False
      else:
            for newpos in moves(soln[0]):
                if newpos in soln:
                   continue
                sol=extend([newpos]+soln)
                if not sol:
                   continue
                else:
                   return sol
            return False
</pre>There is a nasty tail to this Python program fragment (the tail consists of 63
returns) but that should not be serious if we have enough stack space.
For us quicky-types ``optimization'' is a dirty word.

<p> We also need to write routines that will generate the list of all possible
moves at a given position.

<p> If we represent positions on the board as pairs then the moves that a
knight can make are given by
<pre class="code">
   [(-1,-2), (-2,-1), (1,-2), (-2,1), (-1,2), (2,-1), (1,2), (2,1)]
</pre>then the code fragment for this looks like
<pre class="code">
knightsmoves = [(-1,-2), (-2,-1), (1,-2), (-2,1), \
                (-1,2), (2,-1), (1,2), (2,1)]

def add(pos1,pos2):
      return (pos1[0] + pos2[0], pos1[1] + pos2[1])

def onboard(pos):
      return (pos[0] &gt;= 0) and
             (pos[0] &lt; 8)  and
             (pos[1] &gt;= 0) and
             (pos[1] &lt; 8)

def moves(pos):
       return [newpos for newpos in
                          [add(pos,move) for move in knightsmoves]
                      if onboard(newpos)]
</pre>Unfortunately, as it stands this program has no hope of producing an
answer in reasonable time. The reason is that we are trying <em>all</em>
possible moves in succession whereas we should be <em>first</em> going to
the square which cannot be easily reached from elsewhere. This means that
we need some new functions.
<pre class="code">
def filmoves(pos,soln):
      return [newpos for newpos in moves(pos)
                     if not (newpos in soln)]

def compval(pos1,pos2,soln):
      return len(filmoves(pos1,soln)) - len(filmoves(pos2,soln))

def sortedmoves(soln):
      list = filmoves(soln[0],soln[1:])
      list.sort(lambda x,y: compval(x,y,soln))
      return list
</pre>The first function filters out moves already ``used up''.
The second uses this to compare two squares based on number of moves
currently available. The last function uses this comparison to sort the
moves. Note that we must also make a minor change to the <tt>extend</tt> function
to make it use <tt>sortedmoves</tt> (<b>Warning</b>: Only use <tt>sortedmoves</tt>
in the second call!).

<p> According to
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KnightsTour.html">authoritative sources</a>
(authoritative at least
according to Google!) this particular algorithm was proposed by Warnsdorff
in 1823. The above program is simple enough that we can ``see'' that it is
correct and do not need any fancy verification procedure. Why then does
is fail to give an answer when we start at the corner (0,0)? Surely a
modern computer can beat a man born in 1823 in calculating things! What's
wrong?!

<p> If you don't believe me or believe that your computer is faster then
just <a href="misc/kapil/knights.py.txt">copy</a> the code or type it in yourself and give it a whirl!
<pre class="code">
      $ python
      Python 2.3.4 (#2, Sep 24 2004, 08:39:09)
      [GCC 3.3.4 (Debian 1:3.3.4-12)] on linux2
      Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for
         more information.
      &gt;&gt;&gt; from knights import *
      &gt;&gt;&gt; extend([(0,0)])
</pre>The program now appears to go sleep...!

<p> Perhaps the reason is that Python is <em>interpreted byte-code</em>. A
compiled language would be better. So we can set about downloading and
installing <a href="http://psyco.sourceforge.net">psyco</a>---a just-in-time
native code compiler for Python.
Meanwhile, we could try a ``real'' functional language---perhaps its
implementation of lists is better. Maybe we can fit in time for a few
functional programming tricks and see if tail-recursion is possible.
(If you want a preview of the <em>real</em> answer, then jump to
the <a href="#denouement">Denouement</a>.)

<p> 

<h2><a name="htoc2"></a>A humpy ride on OCaml</h2>

(I do happen to know that there is a more famous camel that appears more
often in the pages of the Linux Gazette.) A nice candidate for our next
choice of language is <a href="http://caml.inria.fr">OCaml</a> (this is
also talked about in an <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue99/stellingwerff.html">article</a> in an
earlier Gazette). It is claimed that the optimizing native-code compiler
for OCaml can beat even C in certain tasks. I have actually used the DVI
previewer <tt>advi</tt>, the L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X to HTML converter
<tt>hevea</tt><sup><a name="text2" href="#note2">2</a></sup> and the file
synchronizer <tt>unison</tt>; all these are written in OCaml and are quick
and do the job well.  Secondly, it <em>would</em> be a pain to sit and
implement all the data structure management for lists in C just for this.
So the knight must try to tour again---this time atop OCaml<sup><a
name="text3" href="#note3">3</a></sup>.

<p> Just to clarify some of the differences
<tt>let</tt> plays the role of <tt>def</tt> and lists are constructed in
the form <code>[a;b;c;d]</code>. The syntax is also a little more arcane
but should be clear from the programs below.

<p> While we are at it we can also introduce a tweak that avoids computing the
length of a list all the time. Here is <tt>extend</tt> written in OCaml
(the <tt>rec</tt> indicates a recursive definition):
<pre class="code">
let rec extend1 start len soln =
      if (len == 64)
      then
        if List.mem start (moves (List.hd l))
        then soln
        else []
      else
        do_until (fun b -&gt; extend1 start (len+1) (b::soln))
                 (sortedmoves soln);;

let extend start = extend1 start 1 [start];;
</pre>where <tt>do_until</tt> applies a function to a list until it produces an answer
or is empty:
<pre class="code">
let rec do_until f = function
      | [] -&gt; []
      | h::t -&gt; match f h with
                | [] -&gt; do_until f t
                | answer -&gt; answer;;
</pre>The <code>|</code> is used to introduce a pattern to match.

<p> As before we need to define the functions that will produce the list
of available moves.
<pre class="code">
let knightsmoves = [(-1,-2); (-2,-1); (1,-2); (-2,1);
                   (-1,2); (2,-1); (1,2); (2,1)];;

let add (a,b) (c,d) = (a+c,b+d);;
 
let onboard (a,b) =
 (a &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (a &lt; 8) &amp;&amp;
 (b &gt;= 0) &amp;&amp; (b &lt; 8);;

let moves pos =
     List.filter (onboard)
                 (List.map (add pos) knightsmoves);;

let filmoves pos soln = 
     List.filter (fun b -&gt; not (List.mem b soln)) (moves pos);;

let compval soln pos1 pos2 =
     (List.length (filmoves pos1 soln)) -
      (List.length (filmoves pos2 soln));;

let sortedmoves soln =
     List.sort (compval soln)
               (filmoves (List.hd soln) (List.tl soln));;
</pre>As you can see the ``pattern matching''-way of defining things in OCaml
really simplifies definitions.

<p> We can string all these together - with the caveat that one
<em>must</em> define a term before using it. So the later definitions have
to come before the earlier ones. Programming languages which require
declarations to come in order are best programmed ``bottom-up'' unless one
can sort out all the details in one's head before putting a finger to the
keyboard.

<p> Now one can run the program by entering the interpreted mode of OCaml
<pre class="code">
      $ ocaml
       Objective Caml version 3.08.2

      # #use "knights.ml";;
      val knightsmoves : (int * int) list =
      [(-1, -2); (-2, -1); (1, -2); (-2, 1); (-1, 2); (2, -1); (1, 2);
      (2, 1)]
      val add : int * int -&gt; int * int -&gt; int * int = &lt;fun&gt;
      val onboard : int * int -&gt; bool = &lt;fun&gt;
      val moves : int * int -&gt; (int * int) list = &lt;fun&gt;
      val filmoves : int * int -&gt; (int * int) list -&gt; (int * int) list
      = &lt;fun&gt;
      val compval : (int * int) list -&gt; int * int -&gt; int * int -&gt; int =
      &lt;fun&gt;
      val sortedmoves : (int * int) list -&gt; (int * int) list = &lt;fun&gt;
      val do_until : ('a -&gt; 'b list) -&gt; 'a list -&gt; 'b list = &lt;fun&gt;
      val extend1 : int * int -&gt; int -&gt; (int * int) list -&gt; (int * int)
      list = &lt;fun&gt;
      val extend : int * int -&gt; (int * int) list = &lt;fun&gt;
      # extend (0,0)
</pre>But then the system goes to sleep as before .... The whole reason
for trying OCaml was to compile the code in the hope of a faster
response! So we need to run the native code compiler.

<p> Before we do that however we need to have some way to do input and
output, so a little more programming is involved. Our program
produces output as a list of moves in order, what we want to output
is the position of each square in this list. Since output happens
only once we don't need to be particularly efficient.
<pre class="code">
let rec indexadd n pos soln =
      match (List.hd soln) with
      | pos -&gt; n
      | _   -&gt; indexadd (n-1) pos (List.tl soln);;

let index pos soln = indexadd 64 pos soln;;

let printsoln soln =
      (* Print the top line *)
      for i = 1 to 8 do
            Printf.printf "-----";
      done;
      Printf.printf "-\n";

      for i = 0 to 7 do
            for j = 0 to 7 do
                  Printf.printf "| %2i " (index (i,j) soln);
            done;
            Printf.printf "|\n";
            (* Print a line below *)
            for j = 1 to 8 do
                  Printf.printf "-----";
            done;
            Printf.printf "-\n";
      done;;
</pre>Finally, the input procedure. For some strange reason OCaml uses <tt>!pointer</tt> to reference the contents - so the <code>!</code> sign below is not
a ``not''.
<pre class="code">
if (!Sys.interactive)
then
      (* If we are loaded in the interpreter do nothing *)
      ()
else
      if (Array.length Sys.argv) &gt; 2
      then
        print_soln
          (extend
             (int_of_string Sys.argv.(1), int_of_string Sys.argv.(2))
          )
      else
        Printf.printf "Usage: %s x y\n" (Sys.argv.(0));;
</pre>Now we are all set. The compilation
<pre class="code">
       $ ocamlopt -o knights knights.ml
</pre>produces a standalone program <tt>knights</tt>. So here goes
<pre class="code">
$ ./knights 0 0
</pre>...and nothing happens!

<p> Again, if you don't believe me, or you believe your computer is faster,
you can <a href="misc/kapil/knights.ml.txt">download</a> the OCaml source, compile
it, and try it for yourself!

<p> 

<h2><a name="htoc3"></a>Denouement</h2>
<a name="denouement"></a>
Home for the day and I don't have OCaml on my home machine so I 
wrote the program afresh in Python. This time I felt too lazy to
type in the knights moves again so I added:
<pre class="code">

  &gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>Surprise! Here is a solution at last!

<p> At this point, a bell somewhere had gone ``dung''... and I wasn't sure
it was OCaml that did it---perhaps it was the prunes!

<p> Then my daughter came over and said she had followed the
algorithm <em>by hand</em> and come up with a solution. Her solution
started at the square (4,4) so I tried that with the <tt>knights</tt>
program compiled with OCaml.
<pre class="code">
$ ./knights 4 4
-----------------------------------------
|  9 |  6 | 11 | 44 | 27 |  4 | 29 | 34 |
-----------------------------------------
| 12 | 43 |  8 |  5 | 46 | 33 | 26 |  3 |

-----------------------------------------
| 40 | 15 | 58 | 51 | 38 | 17 | 20 | 23 |
-----------------------------------------
</pre>I decided then to check the authoritative source via Google once
more. What it really says is that Warnsdorff's algorithm is for a
Hamiltonian <em>path</em>---a path that takes a knight through each
square exactly once---it is not necessary to return to the starting
square.

<p> What my experience with these programs shows is that Warnsdorff's
algorithm is <em>can</em> find a Hamiltonian <em>circuit</em> reasonably
quickly in <em>some</em> cases.
Perhaps unsurprisingly it's success depends on the order in
which one looks at the moves of the knights. For example, the above
Python code to generate <tt>knightsmoves</tt> actually gives
<pre class="code">
[(1, 2), (1, -2), (-1, 2), (-1, -2), (2, 1), (2, -1), (-2, 1), (-2, -1)]
</pre>Perhaps a little more surprising (since the final solution is circular)
is the fact that the running time depends on the starting point. Indeed
I got running times of a few milliseconds, a few seconds and a few hours
(one process has been running for more than a couple of days!) for
different inputs to the same program!

<p> This may be rather typical of ``hard'' problems. There are a number
of ``cheap'' instances and a number of truly ``hard'' instances but
this distinction depends on where one starts---pure dumb luck decides
whether one can solve the problem or not. (Actually it appears that the
knights tour is not really a ``hard'' problem as one increases the
size of the board (see <a href="#better">Exercise 4</a>, just below).)


<h2><a name="htoc4"></a>Exercises</h2>

Here are some things that suggest themselves:
<ol type=1><li>
 	Try to find some real way to prove that the Python is
 		better than OCaml or vice versa. Or more generally
 		settle the great wars between functional and
 		procedural programming!
	<li>Try to randomize the choice from amongst the lowest
		valency vertices if there is more than one. This
		may result in shorter average times for all starting
		points.
	<li>Try to add an extra weight to ensure that vertices
 		further away from the start are taken up sooner than
 		other vertices of the same valency. Perhaps this will
 		be more efficient.
 	<li><a name="better"></a>There is apparently a better algorithm than
 		Warnsdorff's for the Hamiltonian circuit. Find it and
 		implement it.
</ol>

<h3><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
This article is actually a lie. I am not preparing for interviews anymore.
I started this article at the end of October, but then I got a 2 month
contract right after that. Still, it's the thought that counts. 

<p> This article is to help you setup MySQL Master/Slave/Cluster
combinations on one computer.  Why would that be useful? Well, for
starters, there isn't an abundance of Master/Slave/Cluster documentation.
The Cluster technology is really new. Second, MySQL is a very very very hot
database. There aren't too many good MySQL DBAs out there. If you want to
secure your job in the future, learn MySQL. The Master/Slave and Cluster
technologies are a must. If you don't know anything about the Master/Slave
or Clusters, you can pretty much forget getting hired. In every MySQL
interview (I had like 10 companies interviewing me in a six week period and
half of them used MySQL for something) the Master/Slave questions popped up
and topics of the Clustering technology came up as well. Third, it is a
pain to setup Master/Slave or Cluster environments by hand.  If my script
works on one of your computers, copy over the software, copy over the
config files, make slight changes to the config files, and you can get a
real multi-computer environment setup in minutes. 

<p> The second purpose of this article is to show you how to use Python to
write a simple application (compiling and installing MySQL).  I tried to
include a lot of stuff in the Python code which is common to most Python
scripts/modules. Also, I am thinking about turning the Python code into a
package in the <a href="http://www.vex.net/parnassus/">Vaults of
Parnassus</a> - just for kicks, and so I can say that I have some sort of
Python code published.  

<p> So, why did I use the programming language <a
href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> to execute all the commands?  I
love Python, it is object oriented (from the ground up), has good exception
handling, has been compilable for a long time, it is hard to write ugly
Python code, it is easy to understand other people's code, there is only one
way to do things (usually), it's easy to manipulate, and it is a general tool
from web programming to Unix scripting to database programming to GUI
programming to mathematical programming (my favorite). There are so many
reasons to love Python if you are a true object-oriented programmer. The
other reason why I try to use Python for all personal projects is to
convince people where I work (or will work) that Python rocks and should be
used wherever appropriate. The sad thing is, most managers don't want to
use Python because of the lack of people who can write good Python code, so
it is my duty to convince them otherwise. <i>Update: I got hired at Google,
which uses a lot of Python so now I am a happy camper!</i> 

<p> Why compile MySQL? Why not just use the RPMs? I don't think clustering
is built into some of the RPMs. Also, I always like to compile and install
software myself. If you can't compile it, odds are, there might be other
problems. If you do decide to use RPMs, and you decide to use an RPM
server, please use <a
href="http://linux.duke.edu/projects/yum/index.ptml">YUM</a> and do not use
commercial RPM servers. All the commercial RPM servers I have seen (just
one, you know who) are way overpriced and are geared towards the executive
staff or people who want to buy support so that they can blame someone if
something goes wrong. The sales staff are really good at making you believe
you can jump to the moon, when really, the software they present only
manages the installation of RPMs. Any 1st year programmer could write a web
interface to do the same thing. By using YUM (it is easy, simple, and free
of restrictions), you empower yourself and you will help bring down the
costs of the the overpriced commercial RPM services. If the commercial RPM
services weren't so overpriced (they should be like $25 per computer max)
and didn't have so many stupid restrictions (like installing
the<code>bind</code> RPM requires a more expensive license), I wouldn't
mind, but they are getting away with doing so little, it is ridiculous.
Politics and the suits have gotten in the way of good technology at some of
these companies. 

<p> One more thing, I bought a 2-gig RAM 64 bit AMD CPU with Serial ATA
hard drives. I bought this hardware configuration for the simple purpose of
using a 64 bit operating system. Why? Because many companies are using 64
bit AMD cpus for their databases and other things. Just at work the other
day, I mentioned I got a MySQL cluster to work on my home computer, so I as
asked to setup a test cluster at work. See how valuable it is to stay ahead
of the market?

<p> The nice thing about the 64 bit AMD CPU is that is will also support
the 32bit operating systems.  Thus, I was able to take the safe route by
installing a 32 bit Linux OS before I risked using the 64 bit versions
(which had a lot of problems in the past).  Plus, don't kill me for saying
it, but I still wanted to play some Windows games that weren't available
for Linux yet. I am close to the point where I never need to use Windows
again. If gaming companies would always make Linux versions of their
products, I would never have use Windows for anything. That would really be
nice.  

<h3><a name="master"></a>Mysql Master/Slave and Clusters</h3> What is
MySQL? Well, if you mean the <a
href="http://www.mysql.com/products/mysql/">MySQL database server</a>, it
is an SQL database server available from <a
href="http://mysql.com">mysql.com</a>. It is comparable to <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and Oracle in most ways.
MySQL is one of the two most popular Open Source database servers out there
(PostgreSQL being the other). 


<p> What are <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/mysql/">MySQL
Master/Slaves</a>?  The Master MySQL server lets people read and write data
to it. It copies all of its data to the MySQL slave computers.  Thus, you
end up with many database servers with the same data.  This can be useful
for load-balancing your webservers against many database servers or
performing a failover in case the Master dies (you shutoff the Master and
make one of the Slaves the new Master).  Normally, the Slave computers are
read-only. Since most websites have a 4-to-1 ratio of reads to writes,
having many read-only MySQL slaves can be very useful. How it is useful?
Your website can handle more data and use more database connections spread
over multiple servers. All the writes still have to be done to the Master,
but the website can choose which Slave it wants to read data from.
Separating the write connections from the read connections can speed up
your website a lot. 

<p> What is <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/mysql/">MySQL
Clustering</a>?  MySQL Clustering lets you put multiple computers together
which are all the same and have all the same data.  You can connect to any
computer in the cluster and perform read/write operations which are
immediately available to the other mirrors. The main different between
Clustering and Master/Slaves is that each computer in a Cluster can be
written to while in a Master/Slave configuration you are only suppose to
write to the Master. Also, in Clustering, when you write data to one
machine, the computer will not respond back with an "OK" status until the
data has been copied to all the other computers.  With the Master/Slave
configuration, the data is not necessarily copied to the Slaves
immediately.  Effectively, you can view the cluster as one single
entity/database.  The nice thing is, if one computer is the cluster
crashes, it doesn't affect the other computers or the data in the cluster.
This behavior doesn't exist in the Master/Slave replication. If the Master
goes down, the replication stops. 

<p> Clustering is a little more complicated, but it has huge advantages and
will most likely be used a lot by many companies. It is fairly new
technology, so in my opinion, it is good time to start testing it. For
small websites which love to be on the bleeding edge of technology and you
don't mind being risky, go ahead and use MySQL Clustering.  I am a little
cautious about using it for heavy performance database needs, but I am
anxious to at least try! You should be warned that there are a lot of
limitations with MySQL Clustering.  For example, your database can only be
as big as the free RAM you have. Also, I have had a lot of problems getting
more than just a two storage node cluster working. 

<h3><a name="python"></a>The Python script and Python Module MySQL.py</h3>

The Python Script "Compile_MySQL.py" is meant to access the MySQL.py 
module to install, configure, and get MySQL running. I tried to make
it as simple as possible so that a lot the options you want can be
specified at the command line.  

<p> The MySQL.py module currently only has one class called "Installer"
which  is mostly finished.  It has other classes I am working on, but
nothing worth talking about yet.  I included a lot of stuff in the module
like:

<ol>
<li> I broke down the main modules to approximate the steps you would
use to install MySQL. In addition, I separated out the compiling from
the configuring because I wanted you to be able to skip the compiling
if you already installed MySQL once.</li>
<li> Use of the try/except statements.</li>
<li> The first string of the method(s) is used for automatic documentation
extraction.</li>
<li> The concept of classes.</li>
<li> The init and del methods which are executed at creation and destruction
of an object.</li>
<li> Other internal methods to handle printing an object or when you try
to compare this object against other objects.</li>
<li> Escaping to shell to execute code, get its return status, and output
data.</li>
<li> Regular expressions and using them repeatedly. It's only necessary to
create a regular expression once, so that you don't waste resources
recreating regular expressions. </li>
<li>Storing variables in an object.</li>
<li>Line command arguments are passed.</li>
<li>The script only creates one set of MySQL binaries. It uses different
directories and ports for each instance of the MySQL server.</li>
</ol>

Personally, I think the module could use a lot of work. I see repetitive
code that could be converted into methods, there need to be more
command line options, and there needs to be a place to save the configuration
for later runs (using xml) if we want to use this as an admin tool. 

<p> Here is sample script to use my MySQL module. Note, if you already ran
this script and got mysql working, and you want to reconfigure it, then
comment out "M_Obj.Execute_Compile_Script()" to reconfigure mysql.  I tried
to comment each below in the script. 

<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/python
   ### Just a bunch of standard modules I load. 
import urllib2, urllib, string, re, os, struct
import base64, string, gzip, sys, time, commands
import getopt

   ### The module I created. 
import MySQL

   ## Initialize our installation object. 
M_Obj = MySQL.Installer()

#--------------------------------------------------------
### Build and install the mysql binaries. These binaries will be common
### with all the mysql services.

M_Obj.Write_Compile_Script()   ### This creates out bash compile script.
M_Obj.Execute_Compile_Script() ### This executes our bash script.
                               ### This creates one set of binaries for
                               ### all mysql instances. 

M_Obj.Stop_Instances()   ### In case there are any running.
M_Obj.Setup_Instances()  ### Setup and initialize the databases. 
M_Obj.Start_Instances()  ### Start the databases. 
</pre>

<h3><a name="execute"></a>Executing the Python script</h3>
Download these files:

<ol>
<li><a href="misc/nielsen/MySQL_py.txt">MySQL.py</a> and save it as MySQL.py.
<li><a href="misc/nielsen/Compile_MySQL_py.txt">Compile_MySQL.py</a> and save it as Compile_MySQL.py.
<li><a href="misc/nielsen/Config/">Config files</a>. Save all the config
files in this directory (or grab this <a
href="misc/nielsen/Config.tgz">tarball</a> containing all of them) into a
directory called "Config" where you execute Compile_MySQL.py.
</ol>

Then execute this command:
<pre class="code">
python Compile_MySQL.py  
</pre>

<p> This will download and install MySQL. It will make a log file called
"/tmp/mysql_install.log". If it doesn't download MySQL, download
<code>mysql-4.1.7.tar.gz</code> manually from <a
href="http://mysql.com">mysql.com</a> and save it in the directory
"/usr/local/src/mysql_compile".

<p><i>NOTE:</i> If you want to specify another database server, 
then execute this, substituting the appropriate URL:
<pre class="code">
python Compile_MySQL.py -d http://www.signal42.com/mirrors/mysql/Downloads/MySQL-5.0/mysql-5.0.2-alpha.tar.gz
</pre>

<h3><a name="commands"></a>Some commands to run</h3>
So, now we got the database server installed. Let us do some stuff
to verify the Master/Slaves are working as well as the MySQL Cluster.
I made things really easy for you (assuming the installation was good).
I have made a bunch of scripts for you.

<p> Here are a bunch of scripts in the home directory where mysql got
installed.
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=2>
<tr><th>Script</th><th>Usage</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>bash_aliases</td><td nowrap>source bash_aliases</td><td>
   This setups aliases to connect to each service. The aliases connect to
the master service, slave services, ndb_mgm, and each cluster mysqld
service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Start</td><td>./Start</td><td>Starts the master, slaves, and
cluster.</tr>
<tr><td>Stop</td><td>./Stop</td>
<td>Stops the master, slaves, and cluster.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p> 
The scripts listed below are created in the "scripts" directory
where mysql got installed.
If you did a "source bash_aliases", these commands will be in the bash
path. You can execute these scripts as many times as you like. 

<p>
<table border=1>
<tr><th>Script</th><th>Purpose</th></tr>
<tr><td>Master_Status.bash</td>
    <td>Gets the status of the master service.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Slave_Status.bash</td>
    <td>Gets the status of the slave services.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Master_Slave_Status.bash</td>
    <td>Gets the status of the master and slaves.</td>
    </tr>
<tr><td>Master_Slave_Test.bash</td>
    <td>Inserts data and then the master and slaves perform the same
    sql query which should show the same results.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cluster_Status.bash</td>
    <td>Gets the status of the cluster</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cluster_Test.bash</td>
    <td>Inserts data into the cluster. It shuts down each storage node
    and sees if each mysqld server can still access the data.</td></tr>
</table>

<p> Try to learn what the scripts do step by step. If you can fully understand
what those scripts are doing, then you know at least the basics about how to
manage the mysql services. 

<p> Follow these steps:
<pre class="code">
cd /usr/local/mysql-cluster    ### Change to the mysql directory. 
source bash_aliases            ### Load some aliases into the bash shell.
./Start                        ### Start mysql master, slaves, cluster.

Cluster_Status.bash	       ### Get the status of the cluster
Master_Status.bash             ### Get the status of the master service.
Slave_Status.bash              ### Get the status of the slave service.

Master_Slave_Test.bash         ### Test the master/slave services.
Cluster_Test.bash              ### Test the cluster.

</pre>

<h3><a name="next"></a>Next Month</h3>
I am probably going to use MySQL 5.0 at home from now on. So, I am probably
not going to test MySQL 4.1.x anymore. Saying that, possible next months topics
include:
<ol>
<li> MySQL failover for Master/Slave cluster. The master has gone bad and
we want to make a slave the new master.
 There are lots of issue to consider when 
doing this, like data corruption. </li>
<li> Stored procedures.</li>
<li> More cluster configurations.</li>
<li>Scripts to check if your MySQL Master/Slave/Cluster computers
are running smoothly.</li>
<li>Maybe check out all the new tools you can download from MySQL?</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
The Python module was sort of an overkill. However, I wanted to make it 
really easy to compile and install MySQL every time there is an upgrade.
I am going to use Python for everything I do and I plan on using it
for all SysAdmin needs in the future (if I can help it). Every time
there is a new version of Python, I am so impressed because it just gets
easier, simpler, and more powerful. In Python 2.4 (which just came out), 
sets are really cool for intersection and union calculations. 

<p> MySQL is coming along nicely. With all the new features being put into
MySQL, it can compete against some of the larger database companies.  It is
important to learn MySQL because new job opportunities are emerging and
MySQL will be a hot item over the next few years (before the masses learn
it). The Python module and the script I wrote make it really easy to get a
fairly complicated set of MySQL instances installed on your computer. To
use it in production, just copy over the binaries and the config files and
make a few changes to the config files and you are done! Once you see how
Master/Slave/Cluster configurations work, it really becomes simple to
understand how it all works. 

<h3>Afterword:<br><em>Get your certifications.</em></h3>

<p> In the last few months, I believe the MySQL Professional Certification
paid off. Most employers don't want just a DBA anymore. PostgreSQL and
MySQL make database servers easy to use for most people. No longer do you
have to worship the DBA from hell because he/she knows all the little
tricks. All the docs and examples are online and you can fool around with
the source code yourself. This is going to put pressure on DBAs to be more
than just DBAs. I believe the MySQL jobs I applied for really liked my
programming and Sys Admin skills. I know for a fact that one company used
my MySQL Professional Certification as leverage to interview me because
they could claim "he is certified". They really wanted a programmer, but
because of politics, they couldn't directly get a programmer, so my
certification let me slip in. Cool, huh? A lot of certifications really
don't tell you whether someone is good or not. However, the LPI and MySQL
Certifications have two things going for them. First, they are actually
reasonable certifications. Most certifications are meant to just make money
for the company, but LPI and MySQL don't seem to be like that; they really
want you to be qualified. Second, managers and HR like certifications
because it protects them. I know most techies hate certifications, but
because of politics, you really need to get certified to fight against the
machine. LPI and MySQL Certifications are fairly inexpensive, unlike a lot
of the other stupid certifications, so it really isn't that bad.

<h1>Flickr and Perl</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>

</p>


<p>
<p> <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> is a photo-sharing service: it
allows you to share your photos with friends, family, or the public in
general. Flickr caters to "moblogging": photo blogging from mobile phones, 
which is a great part of the appeal to me. It also comes with an API so
you don't have to take apart its pages to scrape it, which is nice.

<p> <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~iamcal/Flickr-API-0.03/API.pm">Flickr::API</a>,
which was written by one of Flickr's developers, provides a way to interface
to Flickr from Perl. (Flickr's API documentation is available <a 
href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/">here</a>). There is also
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~cpb/Flickr-Upload-1.10/Upload.pm">Flickr::Upload</a>,
which does exactly as the name suggests.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p> The first step is to get an API key. Flickr is still a relatively new 
service, and want to know who is writing software to access their service
and why, and having people register for an API key is a common requirement
of web services anyway. To register for an API key, follow the steps 
outlined on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html">this
page</a> (at the time of writing, this simply involved emailing Cal Henderson,
the author of <code>Flickr::API</code>).

<p> API key at the ready, you can now start using Flickr. Flickr provides
a test method <code>flickr.test.echo</code> to allow you to check that 
everything is working, and this is used in the example given in
<code>Flickr::API</code>'s POD. I've expanded on it slightly to give some
output using the <code>Data::Dumper</code> module:

<pre class="code">
use Flickr::API;
use Data::Dumper;

my $api = new Flickr::API({'key' =&gt; ''});

my $response = $api-&gt;execute_method('flickr.test.echo', {
			    'foo' =&gt; 'bar',
			    'baz' =&gt; 'quux',
			    });

print &quot;Success: $response-&gt;{success}\n&quot;;
print &quot;Error code: $response-&gt;{error_code}\n&quot;;
print Dumper ($response);
</pre>

<p> The output from this should be 
<pre>
Success: 1
Error code: 0
</pre>

<p> followed by a lot of output from <code>Data::Dumper</code>. The part of
this output that we're interested should look something like this:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;rsp stat=&quot;ok&quot;&gt;
&lt;baz&gt;quux&lt;/baz&gt;
&lt;method&gt;flickr.test.echo&lt;/method&gt;
&lt;foo&gt;bar&lt;/foo&gt;
&lt;api_key&gt;[snip]&lt;/api_key&gt;
&lt;/rsp&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Doing something useful</h3>

<p> Once everything is up and running, we're ready to start doing something
of interest. I'm only really interested in using my own photos, so I first 
need to get my user id. 

<p> There are two ways of doing this: you can call 
<code>flickr.urls.lookupUser</code> with the URL of a user's photo or user
page, or if you know the user's username, with 
<code>flickr.people.findByUsername</code>. Here's an example that uses both:

<pre class="code">
use Flickr::API;
use Data::Dumper;

use warnings;
use strict;

my $api = new Flickr::API({'key' =&gt; ''});

my $user = shift;
my $response;

if ($user =~ m!http://!i)
{
$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.urls.lookupUser', {
				     'url' =&gt; $user,
				     });
}
else			         
{
$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.urls.findByUsername', {
				     'username' =&gt; $user,
				     });
}

my $debug = 1;
if ($debug)
{
print &quot;Success: $response-&gt;{success}\n&quot;;
print &quot;Error code: $response-&gt;{error_code}\n&quot;;
print Dumper ($response);
}
</pre>

<p> Cleaning it up to provide useful output is left as an exercise for
the reader (don't worry, I'll get to that later). When called with either 
a URL or username, it should have (among the usual <code>Data::Dumper</code> 
output) something that looks like this:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;rsp stat=&quot;ok&quot;&gt;
        &lt;user id=&quot;49502976979@N01&quot;&gt;
                &lt;username&gt;jimregan&lt;/username&gt;
        &lt;/user&gt;
&lt;/rsp&gt;
</pre>

<p> So... I mentioned that I was going to do something useful. What I'm 
looking to build is a little script that gives me a montage of the last
few photos I posted, and a script that takes the coordinates of a photo
note and generates an image map (at some point, I'd like to change that
to be RDF, so I can use it in FOAF or what have you, but for now, an 
image map is easier).

<h3> Generating an Image Map</h3>

<p> First, let's take a look at how we get the information, and what it
looks like:

<pre class="code">
use Flickr::API;
use Data::Dumper;

use warnings;
use strict;

# Test photo: http://flickr.com/photos/jimregan/120856/
# Photo url: http://photos1.flickr.com/120856_01b51464c0.jpg
# http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getInfo.html
my $api = new Flickr::API({'key' =&gt; ''});

my $response;

$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.photos.getInfo', {
   	       	                  'photo_id' =&gt; '120856',
				  'secret'   =&gt; '01b51464c0'
				  });

my $debug = 1;
if ($debug)
{
	print &quot;Success: $response-&gt;{success}\n&quot;;
	print &quot;Error code: $response-&gt;{error_code}\n&quot;;
	print Dumper ($response);
}
</pre>

<p> output:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;rsp stat=&quot;ok&quot;&gt;
	&lt;photo id=&quot;120856&quot; secret=&quot;01b51464c0&quot; server=&quot;1&quot; dateuploaded=&quot;1090965387&quot; isfavorite=&quot;0&quot; license=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
		&lt;owner nsid=&quot;49502976979@N01&quot; username=&quot;jimregan&quot; realname=&quot;Jimmy O\'Regan&quot; location=&quot;Ireland&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;title&gt;IMAGE0006&lt;/title&gt;
		&lt;description&gt;Mark, May 2002&lt;/description&gt;
		&lt;visibility ispublic=&quot;1&quot; isfriend=&quot;0&quot; isfamily=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;dates posted=&quot;1090965387&quot; taken=&quot;2004-07-27 14:56:27&quot; takengranularity=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;editability cancomment=&quot;0&quot; canaddmeta=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;comments&gt;0&lt;/comments&gt;
		&lt;notes&gt;
			&lt;note id=&quot;10840&quot; author=&quot;49502976979@N01&quot; authorname=&quot;jimregan&quot; 
x=&quot;96&quot; y=&quot;103&quot; w=&quot;38&quot; h=&quot;24&quot;&gt;Look - missing his front teeth
at the bottom!&lt;/note&gt;
		&lt;/notes&gt;
		&lt;tags&gt;
			&lt;tag id=&quot;283784&quot; author=&quot;49502976979@N01&quot; raw=&quot;Mark&quot;&gt;mark&lt;/tag&gt;
			&lt;tag id=&quot;283785&quot; author=&quot;49502976979@N01&quot; raw=&quot;2002&quot;&gt;2002&lt;/tag&gt;
		&lt;/tags&gt;
	&lt;/photo&gt;
&lt;/rsp&gt;
</pre>

<p> So, how do we turn that rather useless code example into something that
will generate a simple HTML page with an image map? I could have tried
accessing <code>$response-&gt;tree</code> directly, but life's too short for
that. The author of <code>Flickr::API</code> and 
<code>XML::Parser::Lite::Tree</code> seems to have thought the same, because
he also wrote <code>XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::XPath</code>, which allows some
simple XPath expressions to be used on <code>XML::Parser::Lite::Tree</code>'s
output.

<p> With a look at the XML above, we want the contents of the 
<code>&lt;note&gt;</code> tags: <code>/photo/notes/note</code>

<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl

use Flickr::API;
use Data::Dumper;
use XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::XPath;

use warnings;
use strict;

# Test photo: http://flickr.com/photos/jimregan/120856/
my $photo = &quot;http://photos1.flickr.com/120856_01b51464c0.jpg&quot;;
# http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.getInfo.html
my $api = new Flickr::API({'key' =&gt; ''});

my $response;

$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.photos.getInfo', {
   	       	                  'photo_id' =&gt; '120856',
				  'secret'   =&gt; '01b51464c0'
				  });

my $xpath = new XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::XPath($response-&gt;{tree});
my @notes = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/photo/notes/note');

print &quot;&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Flickr Photo&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&quot;;
print &quot;&lt;img src=\&quot;$photo\&quot; alt=\&quot;Flickr photo\&quot; usemap=\&quot;#genmap\&quot;&gt;\n&quot;;
print &quot;&lt;map name=\&quot;genmap\&quot;&gt;\n&quot;;

foreach (@notes)
{
	print &quot;&lt;area shape=\&quot;rect\&quot; coords=\&quot;&quot;;
	print &quot;$_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{x}, &quot;;
	print &quot;$_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{y}, &quot;;
	print $_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{x} + $_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{w} .&quot;, &quot;;
	print $_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{y} + $_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{h} .&quot;\&quot; &quot;;
	print &quot;alt=\&quot;$_-&gt;{children}[0]-&gt;{content}\&quot; &quot;;
	print &quot;title=\&quot;$_-&gt;{children}[0]-&gt;{content}\&quot; nohref&gt;\n&quot;;
}
print &quot;&lt;/map&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n&quot;;
</pre>

<p> Now we're getting somewhere. The output is pretty shoddy HTML, but it works:

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Flickr Photo&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos1.flickr.com/120856_01b51464c0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flickr photo&quot; usemap=&quot;#genmap&quot;&gt;
&lt;map name=&quot;genmap&quot;&gt;
&lt;area shape=&quot;rect&quot; coords=&quot;96, 103, 134, 127&quot; alt=&quot;Look - missing his front teeth
at the bottom!&quot; title=&quot;Look - missing his front teeth
at the bottom!&quot; nohref&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p> Let's go one better, and show what it looks like:

<p>
<img src="misc/oregan/120856_01b51464c0.jpg" alt="Flickr photo" usemap="#genmap1">
<map name="genmap1">
<area shape="rect" coords="96, 103, 134, 127" alt="Look - missing his front teeth
at the bottom!" title="Look - missing his front teeth
at the bottom!" nohref>
</map>

<p> Here's an improved version of that script that takes one or two 
parameters from the command line (photo ID, and secret if available) and
creates a web page with more information (<a 
href="misc/oregan/flickrmap.pl.txt">text version</a>):

<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl

use Flickr::API;
use XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::XPath;
use Date::Format qw(time2str);

use warnings;
use strict;

my $api = new Flickr::API({'key' =&gt; ''});
my $response;
my $photo_id = $ARGV[0];
my ($desc, $date, $title, $taken, $photo);

if ($#ARGV == 1)
{
	$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.photos.getInfo', {
   		       	                  'photo_id' =&gt; $ARGV[0],
					  'secret'   =&gt; $ARGV[1]
					  });
}
else
{
	$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.photos.getInfo', {
   		       	                  'photo_id' =&gt; $ARGV[0],
					  });
}

my $xpath = new XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::XPath($response-&gt;{tree});
my @notes = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/photo/notes/note');

my @tmp = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/photo/dates');
$taken = $tmp[0]-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{taken};

@tmp = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/photo/dates');
$date = time2str &quot;%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Y&quot;, $tmp[0]-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{posted};

@tmp = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/photo/description');
$desc = $tmp[0]-&gt;{children}[0]-&gt;{content};

@tmp = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/photo/title');
$title = $tmp[0]-&gt;{children}[0]-&gt;{content};

@tmp = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/photo');
$photo = &quot;http://photos&quot; 
       . $tmp[0]-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{server} 
       . &quot;.flickr.com/&quot;
       . $tmp[0]-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{id} . &quot;_&quot;
       . $tmp[0]-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{secret} . &quot;.jpg&quot;;

print &quot;&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;$title&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&quot;;
print &quot;&lt;img src=\&quot;$photo\&quot; alt=\&quot;$title\&quot; usemap=\&quot;#genmap\&quot;&gt;\n&quot;;
print &quot;&lt;map name=\&quot;genmap\&quot;&gt;\n&quot;;

foreach (@notes)
{
	print &quot;&lt;area shape=\&quot;rect\&quot; coords=\&quot;&quot;;
	print &quot;$_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{x}, &quot;;
	print &quot;$_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{y}, &quot;;
	print $_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{x} + $_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{w} .&quot;, &quot;;
	print $_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{y} + $_-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{h} .&quot;\&quot; &quot;;

print &quot;&lt;p&gt;Taken: $taken, Uploaded: $date&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;;
print &quot;&lt;/html&gt;\n&quot;;
</pre>

<p> Let's look at the output of that:

<p> I had a script earlier that did the basics of finding a userid, and said 
that I was going to leave making it useful as an exercise for the reader.
Well, the bulk of this article was written on Christmas Day, so Merry 
Christmas: (<a href="misc/oregan/finduser.pl.txt">text version</a>)

<pre class="code">
use Flickr::API;
use XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::XPath;

use warnings;
use strict;

my $theuser = shift;

sub finduser
{
	my $fuser = shift;
	my ($xpath, @username, $userid);
	if ($fuser =~ m!http://!i)
	{
		$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.urls.lookupUser', {
						  'url' =&gt; $fuser,
					     	  });

		@username = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/user');

	}

	return $userid;
}

print finduser ($theuser);
</pre>

<h3>Flickr::Upload</h3>

<p> So how do we upload images? We use <code>Flickr::Upload</code>. There
isn't much to using this module: the following script is based on the example
from the POD, but with two minor differences.

<p> First, the script takes the location of the image as a parameter, so it can
be used more than once; second, it tells Mozilla to open a page so the uploader
can edit the details of the photo (as the POD and Flickr's API documentation
say it should). (<a href="misc/oregan/upload.pl.txt">text version</a>)

<pre class="code">
use LWP::UserAgent;
use Flickr::Upload qw(upload);

my $image = shift;

my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
my $photoid = upload ($ua,
                      'photo' =&gt; $image,
                      'email' =&gt; '',
                      'password' =&gt; '',
                      'tags' =&gt; 'mobile',
                      'is_public' =&gt; 1,
                      'is_friend' =&gt; 1,
                      'is_family' =&gt; 1
                     ) or die &quot;Failed to upload $image&quot;;

`mozilla -remote \&quot;openURL(http://www.flickr.com/tools/uploader_edit.gne?ids=$photoid)\&quot;`;
</pre>

<p> The only required parameters are <code>$ua</code>, <code>email</code>, 
and <code>password</code>. These last two are left blank, for obvious 
reasons.

<h3> Creating a montage from Flickr </h3>

		$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.urls.lookupUser', {
						  'url' =&gt; $fuser,
					     	  });

		$xpath = new XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::XPath($response-&gt;{tree});
		@username = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/user');
		$userid = $username[0]-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{id};
	}
	else			         
	{
		$response = $api-&gt;execute_method ('flickr.people.findByUsername', {
						  'username' =&gt; $fuser,
						  });

		$xpath = new XML::Parser::Lite::Tree::XPath($response-&gt;{tree});
		@username = $xpath-&gt;select_nodes('/user');
		$userid = $username[0]-&gt;{attributes}-&gt;{nsid};
	}

	return $userid;
}
</pre>

<p> This does quite a bit more than the other scripts, and is a bit more neat too.
Note that, because Flickr requires authentication, you need to pass your email
and password if you are looking for a montage of images from your Favourites or
Contacts.

<p>
I'll leave you with the default output of that script (though shrunk a bit):

<h1>Building a simple del.icio.us clone</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p> I recently made the move from Mandrake to Ubuntu, and while I was
unpacking in my new $HOME (sorry, I couldn't resist), I came across a
little <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> clone I wrote in
PHP to test out the RDF generating script I wrote (well, adapted) to
go with my <a href="../108/oregan.html">article about outliners</a>.

<p> I decided to use PHP, basically because it's the only language 
I've used for web programming (aside from a misguided moment in my
first year in college when I wrote something in Pascal). I decided to
use SQLite for the database because I didn't feel like installing
MySQL: PHP's SQLite functions are pretty similar to the MySQL equivalent
anyway, so it's no big deal. 

<p> Please note that what I am presenting in this article does very 
little: I needed to test a script, and only cloned the parts I needed to
do that. I did go a little further, but forgot about it until now. 
Doing something useful is for a future article!

<p> Because I only needed it to give me simple XML output, I managed
to get all I needed from a single script. First, I set up a sample
database:

<pre class="code">
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE bookmarks (url TEXT, title TEXT, desc TEXT, keywords TEXT,
date TEXT, id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES('http://sqlite.org/datatype3.html',
'Datatypes In SQLite Version 3','','sqlite programming','2004-10-16T20:23:49Z',1);
INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES('http://sqlite.org/lang.html',
'Query Language Understood By SQLite','','sqlite programming','2004-10-16T20:25:36Z',2);
INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES('http://www.team-teso.net/releases.php',
'releases of teso','','computing 404','2003-07-15T22:29:38Z',3);
INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES('http://ssshotaru.homestead.com/files/aolertranslator.html',
'The AOLer Translator','','humour','2003-11-18T00:45:35Z',4);
INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES('http://www.onlineconversion.com/unix_time.htm',
'Online Conversion - Unix time conversion','','misc','2004-10-16T20:43:44Z',5);
COMMIT;
</pre>

<p> Then, I wrote a script to give me the output:

<pre class="code">
&lt;?php echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?'.'&gt;' ?&gt;
&lt;!-- http://ie.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.php#41654 --&gt;

&lt;posts tag=&quot;&quot; user=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php 

if (!extension_loaded(&quot;sqlite&quot;))
{
        dl(&quot;sqlite.so&quot;);
}

if ($db = sqlite_open(&quot;/tmp/bookmarks.sqlite&quot;, 0666, $err))
{
        $result = sqlite_query ($db, &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks&quot;);
        while (sqlite_has_more($result))
        {
                $post = sqlite_fetch_array ($result);
		
		$url = 'href=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['url']).'&quot;';
		$title = 'description=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['title']).'&quot;';
                if ($post['desc'] != &quot;&quot;)
		{
	                 $desc = 'extended=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['desc']).'&quot;';
		}
		else
		{
			$desc = &quot;&quot;;
		}
		$date = 'time=&quot;'.$post['date'].'&quot;';
		# Don't know if this is how it's done, but it's close enough
		$hash = 'hash=&quot;'.md5($url).'&quot;';
		$tags = 'tag=&quot;'.$post['keywords'].'&quot;';

		print &quot; &lt;post $url $title $desc $hash $tags $date /&gt;&quot;;
		printf (&quot;\n&quot;);
       }
}
?&gt;		
&lt;/posts&gt;
</pre>

<p> Running this with the sample database gave me this output:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;&lt;!-- http://ie.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.php#41654 --&gt;

&lt;/posts&gt;
</pre>

<p> Which is pretty close to the output given by 
<tt>http://del.icio.us/api/posts/get?</tt>. 

<p> It did what I wanted, it didn't take long to write, and I had fun doing
it. So I thought I might try to make it do a bit more.

<p> Next, I decided to tackle the page that returns the list of tags,
to run <tt>delicious_mind</tt> on it:

<pre class="code">
&lt;?php echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?'.'&gt;' ?&gt;

&lt;tags&gt;
&lt;?php 

//error_reporting(E_ALL);
//Error reporting? I have no errors! ... erm... not now, at least.

if (!extension_loaded(&quot;sqlite&quot;))
{
        dl(&quot;sqlite.so&quot;);
}

// I really should do something with $err
if ($db = sqlite_open(&quot;/tmp/bookmarks.sqlite&quot;, 0666, $err))
{
	$tags = array();
	$prevtags = array();
	
        $result = sqlite_query ($db, &quot;SELECT keywords FROM bookmarks&quot;);
        while (sqlite_has_more($result))
        {
                $foo = sqlite_fetch_array ($result);
		$thistag = split(&quot; &quot;, $foo['keywords']);
		// print_r(array) is worth remembering.
		$prevtags = array_merge($tags);
		$tags = array_merge($prevtags, $thistag);
        }
	natcasesort($tags);
	$uniq=array_unique($tags);
	$count=array_count_values($tags);
        foreach ($uniq as $tag)
        {
		$c = $count[$tag];
                print &quot;&lt;tag count='$c' tag='$tag' /&gt;&quot;;
		printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
        }
}
?&gt;		
&lt;/tags&gt;
</pre>

<p> According to del.icio.us's <a href="http://del.icio.us/doc/api">API
documentation</a> the posts URL accepts two parameters: <code>tag</code>
and <code>date</code>, which allow you to filter the results you receive.
The next step was to make the first script do that:

<pre class="code">
&lt;?php 
echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?'.'&gt;'; 

if (!extension_loaded(&quot;sqlite&quot;))
{
        dl(&quot;sqlite.so&quot;);
}

if ($_GET['tag'] != &quot;&quot;)
{
	$tag = $_GET['tag'];
}

if ($_GET['dt'] != &quot;&quot;)
{
	$dt = $_GET['dt'];
}

printf (&quot;&lt;posts &quot;);
if ($dt)
{
	printf (&quot;dt='$dt' &quot;);
	$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks where date like '%$dt%'&quot;;
}
if ($tag)
{
	printf (&quot;tag='$tag'&quot;);
	$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks where keywords like '%$tag%'&quot;;
	// The problem with this is that it matches too much.
	// Using my example, if I search for 'sql' I should get nothing,
	// but instead it matches 'sqlite'
	// Close enough for my purposes, though I should use the stuff I
	// have for extracting the tags.
}
else
{
	printf (&quot;tag=''&quot;);
}
printf (&quot; user=''&gt;\n&quot;);

if ($tag &amp;&amp; $dt)
{
	$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks where date like '%$dt%' and keywords like '%$tag%'&quot;;
}

if (!$tag &amp;&amp; !$dt)
{
	$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks&quot;;
}

if ($debug) echo &quot;&lt;!-- '$query' --&gt;&quot;;

if ($db = sqlite_open(&quot;/tmp/bookmarks.sqlite&quot;, 0666, $err))
{
        $result = sqlite_query ($db, $query);
        while (sqlite_has_more($result))
        {
                $post = sqlite_fetch_array ($result);
		
		$url = 'href=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['url']).'&quot;';
		$title = 'description=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['title']).'&quot;';
                if ($post['desc'] != &quot;&quot;)
		{
	                 $desc = 'extended=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['desc']).'&quot;';
		}
		else
		{
			$desc = &quot;&quot;;
		}
		$date = 'time=&quot;'.$post['date'].'&quot;';
		// Used the wrong variable in the first example
		$hash = 'hash=&quot;'.md5($post['url']).'&quot;';
		$tags = 'tag=&quot;'.$post['keywords'].'&quot;';

		print &quot; &lt;post $url $title $desc $hash $tags $date /&gt;&quot;;
		printf (&quot;\n&quot;);
       }
}
?&gt;		
&lt;/posts&gt;
</pre>

<p> As noted in the comments, the tags matched too much: if I specified
'sql' as the tag to filter for, it would match 'sqlite', if that was the
last tag in the list. I wrote a simple search script while thinking about
what I was going to do next:

<pre class="code">

&lt;?php

if (!extension_loaded(&quot;sqlite&quot;))
{
        dl(&quot;sqlite.so&quot;);
}

if (!$_GET['search'])
{
	echo &quot;&lt;form method='GET'&gt;&quot;;
	echo &quot;&lt;input name='search' value='' type='text' size='80'&gt;&quot;;
	echo &quot;&lt;input type='submit'&gt;&quot;;
	echo &quot;&lt;/form&gt;&quot;;
}
	
else 
{
	$search = $_GET['search'];
	
	if ($db = sqlite_open(&quot;/tmp/bookmarks.sqlite&quot;, 0666, $err))
	{
		
		echo &quot;&lt;form method='GET'&gt;&quot;;
		echo &quot;&lt;input name='search' value='$search' type='text' size='80'&gt;&quot;;
		echo &quot;&lt;input type='submit'&gt;&quot;;
		echo &quot;&lt;/form&gt;&quot;;
		
		$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks WHERE url LIKE '%$search%' OR title LIKE '%$search%'&quot;;
		$result = sqlite_query ($db, $query);
		while (sqlite_has_more($result))
		{
			$post = sqlite_fetch_array ($result);
			$url = $post['url'];
			echo &quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='$url'&gt;&quot;;
			echo $post['title'];
			echo &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;;
			// keywords, edit
		}
	}
}
</pre>

<p> In the end I decided to simply pad each tag out with spaces, because it
was easier that way, leaving me with new versions of the posts and tags 
scripts:

<p>(<a href="misc/oregan/posts.php.txt">text version</a>)
<pre class="code">
&lt;?php 
echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?'.'&gt;'; 

if (!extension_loaded(&quot;sqlite&quot;))
{
        dl(&quot;sqlite.so&quot;);
}

if ($_GET['tag'] != &quot;&quot;)
{
	$tag = $_GET['tag'];
}

if ($_GET['dt'] != &quot;&quot;)
{
	$dt = $_GET['dt'];
}

printf (&quot;&lt;posts &quot;);
if ($dt)
{
	printf (&quot;dt='$dt' &quot;);
	$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks where date like '%$dt%'&quot;;
}
if ($tag)
{
	printf (&quot;tag='$tag'&quot;);
	$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks where keywords like '% $tag %'&quot;;
}
else
{
	printf (&quot;tag=''&quot;);
}
printf (&quot; user=''&gt;\n&quot;);

if ($tag &amp;&amp; $dt)
{
	// A simple change, to prevent false positives: pad the keywords
	// field with spaces :)
	$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks where date like '%$dt%' and keywords like '% $tag %'&quot;;
}

if (!$tag &amp;&amp; !$dt)
{
	$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM bookmarks&quot;;
}

if ($debug) echo &quot;&lt;!-- '$query' --&gt;&quot;;

if ($db = sqlite_open(&quot;/tmp/bookmarks.sqlite&quot;, 0666, $err))
{
        $result = sqlite_query ($db, $query);
        while (sqlite_has_more($result))
        {
                $post = sqlite_fetch_array ($result);
		
		$url = 'href=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['url']).'&quot;';
		$title = 'description=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['title']).'&quot;';
                if ($post['desc'] != &quot;&quot;)
		{
	                 $desc = 'extended=&quot;'.htmlentities($post['desc']).'&quot;';
		}
		else
		{
			$desc = &quot;&quot;;
		}
		$date = 'time=&quot;'.$post['date'].'&quot;';
		// Used the wrong variable in the first example
		$hash = 'hash=&quot;'.md5($post['url']).'&quot;';
		$tags = 'tag=&quot;'.trim($post['keywords']).'&quot;';

		print &quot; &lt;post $url $title $desc $hash $tags $date /&gt;&quot;;
		printf (&quot;\n&quot;);
       }
}
?&gt;		
&lt;/posts&gt;
</pre>

<p> (<a href="misc/oregan/tags.php.txt">text version</a>)
<pre class="code">
&lt;?php echo '&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; standalone=&quot;yes&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?'.'&gt;' ?&gt;

        {

                	print &quot;&lt;tag count='$c' tag='&quot;.trim($tag).&quot;' /&gt;&quot;;
			printf(&quot;\n&quot;);
		}
        }
}
?&gt;		
&lt;/tags&gt;
</pre>

<p> I needed the database changed to work with these scripts, so I added a 
new script to generate the SQL. I should have written it to add the data to
the database directly, but never got around to doing that. 

<pre class="code">
&lt;?
$url = $_POST['url'];
$title = $_POST['title'];
$desc = $_POST['desc'];
$keywords = $_POST['keywords'];
$date = date(&quot;Y-m-d\TH:i:s\Z&quot;, $_POST['date']);


$f = fopen(&quot;/tmp/bookmarks.sql&quot;, &quot;a&quot;);
fwrite($f, &quot;
INSERT INTO bookmarks VALUES ('$url', '$title', '$desc', 
'$keywords', '$date', NULL);
&quot;);
?&gt;
</pre>

<p> The form to call the script:

<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;Post Bookmark&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	
&lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;make-sql.php&quot;&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;URL:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;url&quot; size=&quot;80&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Title:&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;title&quot; size=&quot;80&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Description&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;desc&quot; size=&quot;80&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Keywords&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;keywords&quot; size=&quot;80&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Date&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;date&quot; size=&quot;80&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p> And the output:

<h1>Bash Shell and Beyond Applied</h1>

<h2>Deleting Spam on a POP3 Server</h2>

<!-- dsrich 28 Dec 2004 - split the first paragraph and added hrefs and
information needed for comprehension and to make the examples work. -->
<p>This article will illustrate the use of my extended 'case' and
'read' Bash shell builtins (See my other articles
in issues <a href="../108/park.html">108</a>, <a href=
"../109/park.html">109</a> and <a href="park.html">110</a>) to
delete Spam on my ISP's POP3 mail server before it gets downloaded
into my local mail system. The example scripts use these extended
functions, so they require that you have my shell extensions
installed.</p>

<p>On average, I get 1 MB of spam per hour on my Yahoo account. The
most troublesome of these, both in size and number, are Microsoft
<em>Swen</em> and <em>Netsky</em> worms. Fortunately, they are easy
to identify, and can be deleted right on the POP3 server.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Swen worms are usually 150kB in size and use all lowercase
letters (with optional '-' prefix) as the MIME boundary pattern,
ie.</p>

<pre>
    boundary="-*[a-z]+"
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p>Netsky worms are about 42kB in size and use 3 different patterns
for MIME boundary pattern, namely</p>

<pre>
    boundary="----=_NextPart_000_0016----=_NextPart_000_0016"
    boundary="----=_NextPart_000_001B_01C0CA80.6B015D10"
    boundary="----=_NextPart_000_001B_01C0CA81.7B015D10"
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Telnet to POP3 server</h3>

<p>In order to understand the shell script, you should first log in
to your POP3 server using Telnet, because a shell script only automates
what you type on the command line. So, let's do that:</p>

<pre>
    telnet pop.your.isp 110
    user username
    pass password
</pre>
will connect to remote POP3 server (port 110), and log in using
your 'username' and 'password'.

<pre>
    stat
    top 1 10
</pre>
Here, <tt>stat</tt> returns the number of messages and total size, and
<tt>top 1 10</tt> prints the header of the 1st email plus the top 10 lines
of the body. For our purpose, we are only interested in the header,
specifically the 'boundary' parameter; so, <tt>top 1 0</tt> is what
we need for our script. Note that a single '.' (dot) on a line by itself signals the
end of output.

<pre>
    dele 1
    quit
</pre>
<tt>dele 1</tt> marks the 1st message to be deleted, and
<tt>quit</tt> ends the POP3 session upon which the server removes
all messages marked for deletion.

<h3>Shell script</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<pre>
read3 ()                # Usage: read3
{
    read -r -u3 -D              # read from fd=3
}

send3 ()                # Usage: send3 [cmd...]
{
    echo -D "$*" 1&gt;&amp;3            # write to fd=3
    read3
    echo "$* --&gt; $REPLY"
    [[ $REPLY == +OK* ]]  ||  exit 1
}
</pre>
For this to work, you have to read (<tt>read -D</tt>) and send (<tt>echo
-D</tt>) DOS lines, since the POP3 protocol specification (RFC1939)
requires CRLF (\r\n) line termination. The POP3 protocol is extremely
simple, in that there are only 2 possible responses from the remote
server:

<ul>
<li>+OK (with optional text), if there is no error</li>

<li>-ERR (with optional text), if there was an error</li>
</ul></li>

<li>
<pre>
check ()                # Usage: check server username password
{
    local ok n size i

    exec 3&lt;&gt;/dev/tcp/$1/pop3  ||  exit 1
    read3
    send3 user $2
    send3 pass $3
    send3 stat                  # +OK 11 1504321
    read ok n size &lt;&lt;&lt; "$REPLY"        
    for ((i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)); do
        send3 top $i 0
        case `until read3; [ "$REPLY" = . ]; do echo "${REPLY#.}"; done` in
	     'boundary="-*[a-z]+"' ))
	       echo swen.0 ;;
	     'boundary="(----=_NextPart_000_0016){2}"' ))
	       echo netsky.1 ;;
	     'boundary="----=_NextPart_000_001B_01C0CA8(0\.6|1\.7)B015D10"'
	     ))
	       echo netsky.2 ;;
        esac then
            send3 dele $i
        fi
    done
    send3 quit
}
</pre>
This is the main program loop. It logs in and checks for the above
boundary patterns using regex(7). If there is match, then it deletes
that message from the POP3 server. The type of spam is also printed to
stdout. You'll notice that the exit condition of the extended 'case'
statement is used here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>You can source the 3 functions and run</p>

<pre>
    check pop.your.isp username password
</pre>
from the command line or in a script. However, if you use Fetchmail to
download emails (like I do), then you already have servers,
usernames, and passwords in <tt>~/.fetchmailrc</tt>. You can
extract these data using <tt>fetchmail --configdump</tt> directly:

<pre>
    (
    fetchmail --configdump
    cat &lt;&lt; EOF
    for server in fetchmailrc['servers']:
        if server['protocol'] == 'POP3':
            for user in server['users']:
                print server['pollname'], user['remote'], user['password']
    EOF
    ) | python | while read server user pass; do
        # use (...) to prevent 'exit' terminating entire script
        check "$server" "$user" "$pass"
    done
</pre>

<!-- dsrich 28 Dec 2004 - This next link is a short shell script (1-2K)
stored on the author's web server. We moved the last one of these on to
LG's server, but his address was geocities - I don't know this ISP. -->
<p>The entire script is available from <a href=
"misc/park/popcheck.bash.txt">popcheck.bash</a>, and
should be run just before Fetchmail,</p>

<pre>
    popcheck.bash &amp;&amp; fetchmail
</pre>
usually from crontab.

<h3>Summary</h3>
Although the script deals with Microsoft Swen/Netsky worms, you can
add your own patterns. For example,

<pre>
     'boundary="=+[0-9]+=+"' ))
       echo TAG.spam ;;
     '(Subject|From): =\?[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\?' ))
       echo non.English ;;
     'charset="(ks_c_5601-1987|euc-kr|big5|gb2312|iso-2022-jp|shift-jis)"'
     ))
       echo APIC.charset ;;
     '&amp;lt;(5[89]|6[01]|20[23]|21[0189]|22[012])(\.[0-9]{1,3}){3}&amp;gt;'
     ))
       echo APIC.IP ;;
     'Content-Type: text/html' ))
       echo HTML.header ;;
</pre>

<h1>Design Awareness</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/seymour.html">Mark Seymour</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Kids, Do Try This at Home</h3>
<p> Now that we've talked about some of the basics of design, let's use
some. In this issue, we'll use those design principles to create a simple
opening web page for a fictitious company. (That will keep the lawsuits to
a minimum, rather than reworking something like, say, the www.microsoft.com
site.)

<p> The first thing is to name the company. There are firms out there that
do nothing else; I once worked with a genius (his company is at <a
href="http://www.namelab.com">http://www.namelab.com</a>) who's still at
it, thirty years later. Since this is the January issue, we'll do something
appropriately winterish.

<p> How about a winter sports equipment company? Skis, sleds, that sort of
thing. We want to give a vaguely European feel to the company, so we'll use
'alpine' rather than 'mountain'. We want to imply more than just sporting
goods (we might decide to sell clothing and climbing videos and tents, as
well), so we'll use 'gear' rather than 'equipment'.

<p> So, our company is called Alpine Gear. Except we're very hip and
internet, aren't we? So we'll use the serial-capital version of the name,
like any good computer company: AlpineGear.

<p> A domain search did turn up a link to an existing company
(http://www.alpinegear.com), but it's called Old Style Log Works, Inc., out
of Kalispell, Montana. They build custom log cabins. If you're more curious
than me, you can ask their web designer (http://www.snowdogweb.com) why
they have their client linked to that particular URL. But, since they don't
use Alpine or Gear or AlpineGear anywhere on their site, I'm sure they
won't mind our borrowing the name for this project. Yet it's a good lesson;
domain names are getting more scarce, and finding a good name that's also
an unused domain is getting harder.

<p> Now we have to create a logo for the company. Or, in this case, a
logotype.

<p> What's the difference? A logo is an icon, a picture, a 'bug' that
communicates the image (and hopefully the name) of the company without any
additional words. Think of the <a href="http://www.shell.com/">Shell Oil
Company</a> logo, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Computer</a>
logo, and the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">International Business Machines
Company</a> logo. (I'd bet many of you didn't even know that IBM stood for
International Business Machines.) A logotype is just the name used in a
particular typography that, hopefully, also communicates the image of the
company.  Recent examples are the <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
logotype, the <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> logotype, and the
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> logotype, complete with its own
punctuation.

<p> Why use a logotype rather than a logo? Mere personal preference, some of
the time; either your own or that of the CEO of the company. But you'll
notice a pattern in the companies selected above: the ones that have a
product (something that needs an immediately recognizable sign on a
building or on a box on a shelf) use logos, and the ones that are service
providers use logotypes. It's not a perfect system, however; Ace Hardware
(definitely a product company) uses a logotype and many banks (definitely
service companies) use a logo. Since our company is going to sell many
products, most of them produced by other companies, we'll go with a
logotype.

<p> We want to emphasize the 'European' quality of the company, so we'll
pick the only font typically recognized by Americans as 'Euro', one usually
referred to as either Old English or German Black Letter, for the
'European' half of the name:

<div align="center">
<p> <img src="misc/seymour/Alpine.png" alt="" height="76" width="201" border="0">
</div>

<p> This is a font called Berliner. The image was created in Photoshop, but
the letterspacing was hand-tightened because the standard spacing looked
too 'open', and the capital A didn't look much like an A, except to a
19th-century German. (Logotypes must be grasped as images, rather than
'read' as words, and if the letters are farther apart it tends to invite
letter-by-letter 'reading' by the viewer.)

<p> For the 'equipment' half of the name, we'll use something that's not too
technical looking, something comfortable, that suggests our stuff is fun
and easy to use:

<div align="center">
<p> <img src="misc/seymour/Gear.png" alt="" height="72" width="123" border="0">
</div>

<p> This is ITC Garamond Book Condensed, also with tightened letterspacing.
It also had to be scaled, because  letter proportions are not the same in
all fonts; at 72 points, the capital G was much larger in this font than in
the Berliner. We picked Book Condensed because it gave us a similar
width-to-height ration for the lower case letters. Not perfectly, but
optically. You'll find a lot of things that 'look' right never measure
'right'...

<p> Now we have our logotype:

<div align="center">
<p> <img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGear.png" alt="" height="60" width="290" border="0">
</div>

<p> It needs to appear in color, in most usages, so we'll need to pick them.
We might as well come up with a 'color way' for our site at the same time.
A 'color way' (the industry term for a series of colors to be used
together) is merely the list of colors (whether PMS numbers for printing
inks or hex values for the Web) that will reinforce the image we wish to
show our customers.

<p> We want to look precise (like the Swiss), but fun-loving (like the
Italians). Yet we don't necessarily want to use particularly 'national'
colors, with their flags (red and white for the Swiss and green, white, and
red for the Italians) providing the most recognizable colors for each
country. We do want to look high-tech, and definitely ready for the
mountains. We don't want to look like rocks or dirt (brown), because that's
what you fall on. So we'll rely on the standard mountain-evoking colors of
blue (mountain air and streams) and white (snow), along with old reliable
high-tech gray:

<div align="center">
<table width="408" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" height="20">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#99ccff"></td>
<td bgcolor="#3399ff"></td>
<td bgcolor="#6699cc"></td>
<td bgcolor="#0066cc"></td>
<td bgcolor="white"></td>
<td bgcolor="#666666"></td>
<td bgcolor="#cccccc"></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p> Note that we've chosen several different related blues and a couple of
grays, using our favorite <a href="http://www.visibone.com">VisiBone</a>
swatch set; you'll eventually need to present information in varying
levels, whether in a brochure or a website, and having a preset color way
will help you organize it faster.

<p> Let's see what happens when we apply our color way to our logotype:

<div align="center">
<p> <img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.png" alt="" height="60" width="291" border="0">
</div>

<p> We'll also want to use it on colored backgrounds, so we need at least
one more variant:

<center>
<img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearOnBlue.png" alt="" height="60" width="291" border="0">
</center>

<p> <a id="anchor1" name="anchor1"></a>Now let's look at the basic <a
href="misc/seymour/Page1.html">landing page</a> for the company. (Click the small
white box at the top of the page to return here; it's not part of our
design. These pages have also been optimized for an 800x600 display, so set
your browser to display that size if your resolution is higher.) To the
basic page, we'll now <a href="misc/seymour/Page2.html">add the logo</a>. And then
<a href="misc/seymour/Page3.html">some simple navigation</a>. We'll put in <a
href="misc/seymour/Page4.html">some page links</a>. Finally, we'll display one of
the links, an <a href="misc/seymour/Page5.html">internal directory page</a>, which
points to further specific pages on the topic of High-Altitude Gear.

<p> Note that we've used, to a modest extent, our color way to help guide
the viewer. Other than using <b>bold</b> to show navigation, we've
deliberately left out font specifics on the sample pages, but if you wanted
to use particular fonts you could render the text as PNGs. (The gradient,
of course, would require making the images with transparent backgrounds.)
We've also set up a simple yet flexible navigation system, which would
allow for potentially hundreds of pages in this on-line catalog.

<p> The product pages for this site will require better definition of the
use of the color way, along with setting the style of the illustrations
and/or photographs and the text required to describe the objects in the
catalog. Next month we'll cover some of those aspects.

<p> I hope this has given you some things to think about in your own design
work. As ever, if there are specific topics you'd like covered in future
columns, don't hesitate to email me.

Oh yeah - I used to wonder why the military was screwing around with
depleted uranium, osmium, and other crap like that for their
armor-penetrating rounds, since even a tiny chunk of my old AST laptop
would have instantly crushed any armor division that it fell on.

<blockQuote>
On the other hand, since accelerating that kind of mass to anything
above pedestrian velocities would require a nuclear explosion, and since
any violent state change stands a chance of precipitating gravitic
collapse and black hole formation, perhaps it's just as well...

<P><STRONG>
I had just settled in of a Saturday evening with a wee dram of Irish
whiskey, a good Henry Clay cigar and Linux Gazette #109.  I had worked
my way to "Return of the Linux Laundrette" and reached the section "Re:
[LG 87] help wanted #4".  This piece caused me to drop my cigar (due to
uncontrollable grinning, giggling and guffawing), setting my sweatpants
on fire.

I'm fine, thanks - I extinguished the blaze by spilling my libation in

Well, Ben and I have our own sideline business
(<A HREF="../107/misc/laundrette/lg_hitsquad.html"

say with some confidence that it won't come to that, though some
recovery may occur at some later date.

I don't know how you people manage to produce such an outstanding
combination of useful Linux information, non sequiturs and a, ah, rather
&lt;veering&gt; approach to humor (my kind!) -  but I certainly hope you keep
doing it for a long time to come.

Well, I'll be compiling it for a while to come: it's a lot of fun to go
back over the offtopic threads every month, especially since there are
so many of them:

Here in the Greater Metro DC area (and south of the Mason-Dixon line),
there are <EM>two</EM> kinds, sweet and unsweet, at least in iced teas. The
chinese restaurants uniformly serve hot black pekoe. You can stand a
spoon up in "sweet" and they both taste powdered, and of the same brand,
at least in all the restaurants I've been in. I only got sweet once, and
that before I knew what I was in for. The funny thing was, I didn't know

The tea thing happened indirectly.  You can't drink the water in Russia
unless you boil it first.  Russians did not generally keep fresh water
around, but you were never far from a teapot.  And tea is boiled water
-- how convenient!  The babushkas were surprised when I kept coming back
for tea, and were amazed when after a few cups I'd say, "Just let me
have some hot water, please" until I was ready for more tea.  So I came
home and never stopped drinking tea.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The thing I missed most in Russia was ice water.  I love ice water,
especially with hot food.  You can refrigerate boiled water, but you
can't make ice cubes without ice cube trays.  I guess ice is not a
Russian tradition; I did not see a single ice cube tray my whole time
there.  I decided if I ever go back to Russia, I'm gonna make sure to
pack a couple ice cube trays.

We have the same sort of 'you won't drink with me?' thing here. It's probably
because there's very little physical contact between sober males - it's OK
when you're drunk, or already very good friends with someone, so drinking
together is an essential part of the friendship process.

Not that I saw.  People in Ireland drank if they wanted to, but they
didn't get all out of sorts if you didn't.  And if you stuck to one
beer a day they didn't mind.  It wasn't this one after another "you
must have more" thing.

Well, it's more that if you continually decline invitations to the pub,
people get really annoyed. And you're right, no one minds if you don't
drink. They will tease you for it, though.

Heh. Ya gotta unn'erstan', Mike... despite the overt simplicity, there's
a lot to that custom. In many ways, it's like the Jewish "eat, eat!"
thing. First off, there <em>  is  </em> the obvious - "hey, aren't we friends? Why
do you want to insult me?" But there's also an undertone of "just how
much will you let me force you to drink?", with the sure knowledge that
if you agree once, it becomes much easier after that. Then there's the
cultural imperative of "you must be drunk to talk about <EM>serious</EM>
things", which is What Men Do (i.e., big-time male bonding ritual.)

Another "What Men Do" thing, at least around here, is insulting your
best friends. It's like a private joke: if the implicit "I love you
really, man" is ever made explicit, the bond is... cheapened (that is,
unless you're +/- two drinks from throwing up); if someone else joins
in, serious in their insults, they find their mouth has been shut for
them really quickly.

In Russia, that was considered more or less juvenile (i.e., college
students, etc. would do it, but not most "adult men".) If you're good
drinking buddies with each other, and you've "talked about the deep
things", there's an implied deep level of trust. There are sayings and
jokes about "knowing who you're drinking with", somewhat parallel to "I
(would|wouldn't) go with you to scout enemy positions" (WWII expression
that's stuck around, particularly among the older set.)

His most used term of endearment is 'bitch', so all of the guys I work
or worked with call each other that as a piss-take. I talking to a
Polish coworker, Beata, in the pub last week. She started to get
offended when a friend (who was put working with my former supervisor
when I changed shifts) called me a bitch, and started to say something
about how she knew what those words meant. At the time I thought she was
offended by his language, but afterwards I realised she only knows one
meaning of bitch, and it never occurred to her that he was talking about
me, let alone that she's completely unaware of our little custom.

Navigating those rocks and shoals is a little challenging, but here it
is: a Real Man is one who stands up to the bullying by being relatively
polite but totally firm about refusing... and <em>  then  </em> proceeds to get
righteously fried with you anyway. [grin] Foreigners don't thread that
particular needle well, usually. For that matter, there aren't that many
Russians who do, either. I guess you could call it a fairly tough test.

Yeah, but it's just fucking ridiculous.  Sorry for the cultural
insensitivity, but I have a big issue with forcing alcohol on people,
or letting it intrude into these areas of personal relationships that
it really has nothing to do with.  It is possible to be buddies and
talk about deep stuff without alcohol.

I don't like the idea of force being used between people - we've talked
about how I switch modes when anyone initiates it - but that doesn't
mean I'm going to get torqued about 99% of human history, or ignore how
people interact. I'm also able to distance myself enough to see that it
can work for others, and even find amusement, interest - and most of
all, compassion - for those involved. For myself, I just need to know
the basics for surviving whatever it is; coming out on top and with
style is a plus, if available.

I do have things I consider private (mostly because other people are

I said lemonade.  Then, remembering "lemonade" in England means some
horrible piss-colored soda like Mountain Dew, I said, "Wait!  I mean with
real lemons."  He looked at me with a "what the hell are you talking about"

I finally took the plunge to soundcard-driven music.  Actually it was
forced by a receiver and CD player that are intermittently failing.  I
either had to replace them or get a bookshelf system or switch to the
computer, and I wanted to do it for less than $100.  But I don't like
the current generation of components (way overkill).  The used
components in the shops are, um, worse than I already have.  I don't
like the bookshelf systems (no phono input).  But my computer has crappy
speakers.  So do I get good computer speakers or connect my PC to my
stereo?  I looked into the $50 and $100 amplified computer speakers,
but was afraid to get something that still didn't sound as good as my
stereo.  So I opted for two 25-foot patchcords and an adapter instead,
for the princely sum of $15.  The sound is a bit quieter than it should
be and seems "compressed", but it's OK.  I'm not sure if a better
soundcard or shorter patchcords would make a difference, but I can't
do anything about the patchcords.  The soundcard is... something that
uses the Ensoniq 1371 driver.  So, now I can avoid the failing CD
player.  The receiver is holding up better than it did with CDs.  And
when it does eventually fail, I can replace it with anything that
amplifies.  The only radio station I listen to regularly has
webcasting so I don't really need a receiver per se, except for
records and tapes.

My brother used the same sort of setup. Switch to FLAC instead of MP3
and you'll get some improvement, but there'll always be a difference
because the majority of soundcards are rubbish. The volume difference is
down to the cables - most guitar leads run to about that length and
standard practise is to add a pre-amp to compensate.

On a related note, I've been trying out Audioscrobbler with XMMS: Audioscrobbler

Regarding Paddington Bear and the box room, I was even more shocked
when it said he was using a torch in the room.  In American English,
torch means something with an open flame like the ancient Romans used.

<pre><strong>English is the most widely spoken language in the history of our
planet, used in some way by at least one out of every seven human beings
around the globe.  Half of the world's books are written in English, and
the majority of international telephone calls are made in English.
English is the language of over sixty percent of the world's radio
programs, many of them beamed, ironically, to the Russians, who know
that to win friends and influence nations, they're best off using
English.  More than seventy percent of international mail is written and
addressed in English, and eighty percent of all computer text is stored
in English.  English has acquired tha largest vocabulary of all the
world's languages, perhaps as many as two million words, and has
generated one of the noblest bodies of literature in the annals of the
human race.

Nonetheless, it is now time to face the fact that English is a crazy
language.

In the crazy English language, the blackbird hen is brown, blackboards
can be blue or green, and blackberries are green and then red before
they are ripe.  Even if balckberries were really black and blueberries
really blue, what are strawberries, cranberries, and gooseberries
supposed to look like?

To add to the insanity, there is no butter in buttermilk, no egg in
eggplant, neither worms nor wood in wormwood, neither pine nor apple in
pineapple, and no ham in a hamburger.  (In fact, if somebody invented a
sandwich consisting of a ham patty in a bun, we would have a hard time
finding a name for it.)  To make matters worse, English muffins weren't
invented in England, nor french fries in France, nor Danis pastries in
Denmark.  Sweetmeat is made from fruit, while sweetbread, which isn't
sweet, is made from meat.

Greyhounds aren't always grey (or gray), ladybugs and fireflies are
beetles, a panda bear is a raccoon, and a guinea pig is neither a pig nor
from Guinea.

It was amusing attending a US-Canadian soccer game last year.  It was
the Seattle Sounders vs the Vancouver Whitecaps, who are traditional
rivals.  Some Sounders fans were trying to promote a "loud section" --
an area where people were encouraged to stand and make noise like the
Europeans do -- and were passing out flyers trying to convince people to
get tickets for that section.  But the section was pretty empty.  The
Canadians meanwhile had brought their maple leaves in force and were
shouting and blowing noisemakers the whole time.  The Sounders fans
couldn't be bothered to bestir themselves, and just sat watching and
quietly thinking, "Canadians are weird".  Of course, everybody goes
"Ooooh!" when there's a score, but that only lasts ten seconds and
then it's over, it's not the continual rumblings.

Vamos means "we go" or "let's go" in Spanish.  Vamoose (va-MOOSE) is an
English corruption that's more urgent (disappear, scram, get lost,
hightail it outta here).  Likewise, pronto in Spanish means "soon" but
in English it means "right away or else".  Or as a Valley Girl might

No, hasta means "until".  Sagne doesn't exist AFAIK.  I just

They're all derived from "hasta la vista" (till we meet again,

Well -- properly pronounced the "a" would shift to a darkish "o" sound.
Spelling is not fixed for Bavarian like it's for "High german".
Gramatically there is more in there -- The Bavarian "hast" actually
includes the "du". "Haben sie" = "hams", "hat er" = "hod a" (putting the
o sound in writing here).

were soccer-like games but not persistent teams and rankings.  He said
that was not just a coincidence but a conscious campaign by the business
owners to instill corporate values in the workers (i.e., being a "team
player").  Thus why so many teams were founded and sponsored by companies.

They're all out chasing Britany; that's why they're not at home. At
least until their wives learn to start sending these emails that say,
"Hey You, I'm &lt;Name&gt;. My friend gave me your email..." Eventually, the
Brownian motion in the total population of the husband/wife set will
settle to its minimum-disturbance level as the individual units
recombine into stable pairs (which implies a drop to minimum temperature
- take <EM>that</EM> as you will), and the spams will stop, or at least
decrease greatly.

I'm not convinced they have the right order of definition there: as far
as I was aware, the other two usages derive from langer as a synonym for
penis (and, if you think about it, it makes more sense that way anyway).

<pre><strong>'Said Hanrahan'

"We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   In accents most forlorn,
Outside the church, ere Mass began,
   One frosty Sunday morn.

The congregation stood about,
   Coat-collars to the ears,
And talked of stock, and crops, and drought,
   As it had done for years.

"It's looking crook," said Daniel Croke;
   "Bedad, it's cruke, me lad,
For never since the banks went broke
   Has seasons been so bad."

"It's dry, all right," said young O'Neil,
   With which astute remark
He squatted down upon his heel
   And chewed a piece of bark.

And so around the chorus ran
   "It's keepin' dry, no doubt."
"We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "Before the year is out."

"The crops are done; ye'll have your work
   To save one bag of grain;
  From here way out to Back-o'-Bourke
   They're singin' out for rain.

"They're singin' out for rain," he said,
   "And all the tanks are dry."
The congregation scratched its head,
   And gazed around the sky.

"There won't be grass, in any case,
   Enough to feed an ass;
There's not a blade on Casey's place
   As I came down to Mass."

"If rain don't come this month," said Dan,
   And cleared his throat to speak --
"We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "If rain don't come this week."

A heavy silence seemed to steal
   On all at this remark;
And each man squatted on his heel,
   And chewed a piece of bark.

"We want an inch of rain, we do,"
   O'Neil observed at last;
But Croke "maintained" we wanted two
   To put the danger past.

"If we don't get three inches, man,
   Or four to break this drought,
We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "Before the year is out."

In God's good time down came the rain;
   And all the afternoon
On iron roof and window-pane
   It drummed a homely tune.

And through the night it pattered still,
   And lightsome, gladsome elves
On dripping spout and window-sill
   Kept talking to themselves.

It pelted, pelted all day long,
   A-singing at its work,
Till every heart took up the song
   Way out to Back-o'-Bourke.

And every creek a banker ran,
   And dams filled overtop;
"We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "If this rain doesn't stop."

And stop it did, in God's good time;
   And spring came in to fold
A mantle o'er the hills sublime
   Of green and pink and gold.

And days went by on dancing feet,
   With harvest-hopes immense,
And laughing eyes beheld the wheat
   Nid-nodding o'er the fence.

And, oh, the smiles on every face,
   As happy lad and lass
Through grass knee-deep on Casey's place
   Went riding down to Mass.

While round the church in clothes genteel
   Discoursed the men of mark,
And each man squatted on his heel,
   And chewed his piece of bark.

"There'll be bush-fires for sure, me man,
   There will, without a doubt;
We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "Before the year is out."

off the bugf*ck end of the guessing spectrum) refers to the 15th century
ballad "Captain Wedderburn" - capably redone by Great Big Sea.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>A nobleman's fair daughter
Came down a narrow lane
Met with Captain Wedderburn
Keeper of the game.

"Now my young, fair miss
If it wasn't for the law,
Then you and I in a bed might lie,
Roll-me-over-next-to-the-wall,
Roll-me-over-next-to-the-wall."
</pre></blockquote>

you'll get (paid|laid|rewarded)" stories. But it's a pretty tune, and
well told.)

The Center for Disease Control has issued a warning about a new virulent strain of a sexually transmitted disease.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
This disease is contracted through dangerous and high risk behavior. The disease is called Gonorrhea Lectim (pronounced "gonna re-elect him").
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Many victims have contracted it after having been screwed for the past 4 years, in spite of having taken measures to protect themselves from this especially virulent disease.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Cognitive sequelae of individuals infected with Gonorrhea Lectim include, but are not limited to:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Antisocial personality disorder traits; delusions of grandeur with a distinct messianic flavor; chronic mangling of the English language; extreme cognitive dissonance; inability to incorporate new information; pronounced xenophobia; inability to accept responsibility for actions; exceptional cowardice masked by acts of misplaced bravado; uncontrolled facial smirking; ignorance of geography and history; tendencies toward creating evangelical theocracies; and a strong propensity for categorical, all-or nothing behavior.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The disease is sweeping Washington. Naturalists and epidemiologists are amazed and baffled that this malignant disease originated only a few years ago in a Texas Bush.

The Utah state legislature challenges a University of Utah ban against
concealed firearms on campus, saying the university does not have the
authority to restrict guns further than the state does.  Opponents raise
the prospect of disgruntled students shooting professors or chilling free
speech.  Proponents argue said professors (and women, and janitors) have
a right to protect themselves.

I have a brain twister of a question for you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was reading your article on Bluetooth and Mobile phones.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is it possible to write a program in the computer which captures the
digits being dialled from the (Nokia or whatever) mobile phone and
also preferably the ID of the phone and send that information to a
file on the computer in as close to real time as possible.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would really appreciate your help. There may even be a dollar or so
in it for an enterprising person.

Yes and no, depending on what you mean.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you mean that you want to grab this information from any phone within range, even if they are not yours, then no, it's not possible:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
"To use most of the services on a mobile (or most Bluetooth devices, as far as I can tell), the mobile and the computer must first be paired. Basically, this involves both having the same PIN code entered -- just imagine how horrible it would be if anyone could browse around the files on your phone, or use your computer as an Internet gateway."
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That would be a new horrible idea that had not occurred to me, but fortunately the creators of bluetooth were prepared for it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If, on the other hand, you mean that you have a number of phones that you use for different purposes, then yes, it is possible to find out which phone numbers have been dialled, or from which numbers calls have been received, and to log them.

Now, with this statement, and the mention of 'Marketing' you have helped me to categorise your question better - we answer questions for a much larger audience than just the individual querent, which is why you have received so much help from me so far.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I would like to warn our readers that it is possible to be subjected to spam via bluetooth by simply walking within range of a device. There is a bit of a trend where people send strangers random messages in the form of empty vcards, where the name field is used to carry the message.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I doubt this is of any particular interest to our friend in marketing, however, as this kind of abuse was foreseen by the makers of mobile phones: file transfers of any nature are turned off by default, and must be authorised in any event. It is only when a phone is paired with a computer - i.e., that you have specifically told it to trust a computer - that you can have any degree of automation.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The range of bluetooth devices (10 metres) is too low for this to be a realistic marketing vehicle. The only real use I can imagine, if it were possible to snoop unauthorised on the numbers being dialled on a phone, is that of the jealous spouse who wishes to spy on their loved one.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Because we are the answer gang, I'll go beyond our 'Linux questions only' charter for this case.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If this is your intended use, you should first be aware that this kind of jealousy is usually self-fulfilling: it starts out without basis, but the accused eventually decides to commit the crime for which they are being punished. It is, quite honestly, difficult for me to imagine this kind of mindset, as there are so few who have as much to offer as I do, so my advice to a person with these inclinations would be to improve yourself and your outlook on life to the point where you, like me, have so few competitors that jealousy is simply unfathomable.

"This Intent To Package posting was guaranteed to raise a bit of a

FOR ANYONE WHO WONDERED WHERE THIS TRADITION STARTED - TRUE STORY SANTA TOLD ME SO
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One particular Christmas a long time ago, Santa was getting ready for his
annual trip, but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones, so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. Then, Mrs. Claus told him that her Mum was coming to visit.This stressed Santa even more. Then when he went to harness the reindeer, he found three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out heaven knows where.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the
toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys everywhere. So, frustrated Santa went back into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered that someone had drank all of his liquor and there was nothing left to drink. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it broke into a thousand pieces. Santa went to get the broom and found that the mice had eaten the straw from which it was made.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed his way to the door. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said cheerfully, "Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a wonderful day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree.

Subject: Judge slams spammers with $1-billion judgment

A federal judge in Iowa has awarded a small ISP more than $1 billion in
damages in what's believed to be the largest judgment ever against
spammers. The case was brought by Robert Kramer, whose company provides
e-mail service to about 5,000 customers, and who filed suit after his
inbound mail servers were jammed with as many as 10 million spam-mails a day
in 2000. Citing federal racketeering laws (RICO) and the Iowa Ongoing
Criminal Conduct Act, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Wolle ordered AMP
Dollar Savings of Mesa, Ariz., to pay $720 million; Cash Link Systems of
Miami, Fla., $360 million; and TEI Marketing Group, also of Florida,
$140,000. "It's definitely a victory for all of us that open up our e-mail
and find lewd and malicious and fraudulent e-mail in our boxes every day,"
said Kramer, who is unlikely to ever collect on the judgments.  [AP/*Wall
Street Journal*, 20 Dec 2004; NewsScan Daily, 20 Dec 2004]

Hmmm. Being of black Irish descent doesn't help me when the phrasing
gets complex and Google's not nearly as much help this time. Um...:

I think where you're getting 'greetings' is that the Irish for goodbye is 'sl&aacute;n' (actually, 'sl&aacute;n leat': may you be healthy).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
'Beannachta&iacute;' literally means 'blessings', but in common usage it's usually taken to mean 'be well'. (A Latin loan word, fact fans).

Mmmm, I'd want to suggest something about a new year, except that it
appears that new year would be either "an bhliain &uacute;r" or "an athbhliain".

'&Aacute;th' is a word I can't translate off the top of my head. It means 'superior' or 'higher'. Town is 'baile', city is 'baile &aacute;tha'. ('Baile' is also a Latin loan word, I think. It might not look it at first glance, because Irish has no direct 'v' sound, but the accusative form 'an bhaile' sounds too close to 'villa' to be a coincidence).

But the implication that as a standalone word, "year" has the undertone
of vintage I find least surprising. Grin. Altavista's Babelfish doesn't
do Gaelic, I'd bet good sheckles that Arthur Dent's does, though. I
mean, it translates Vogon poetry, doesn't it?

Heh. It wouldn't have helped out at the last Christmas party I was at. An old guy (with no teeth) decided to tell me a story, and I had to watch him closely to have any idea of what he was saying.

Erm... allow me to respond with 'Many happy returns'. Works well in all situations, I think.

O'Leary showed up at Mass one Sunday and the priest almost fell down
when he saw him. O'Leary had never been seen in church in his life.
After Mass, the priest caught O'Leary and said "O'Leary, I am so glad
you decided to come to Mass, what made you come?" O'Leary said, "I got
to be honest with you Father, a while back, I misplaced my hat and I
really, really love that hat. I know that Shaunassy had one just like
mine and I knew that Shaunassy came to church every Sunday. I also knew
that Shaunassy had to take off his hat during Mass, and I figured he
would leave it in the back of church. So, I was going to leave after
Communion and steal Shaunassy's hat." The priest said, "Well, O'Leary, I
notice that you didn't steal Shaunassy's hat. What changed your mind?"
O'Leary said "Well, after I heard your sermon on the 10 commandments, I
decided that I didn't need to steal Shaunassy's hat." The priest gave
O'Leary a big smile and said "After I talked about Thou Shalt Not Steal,
you decided you would rather do without your hat than burn in Hell,
right?" O'Leary shook his head and said "No, Father, after you talked
about Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, I remembered where I left my
hat!"

Three Lutheran ministers are having dinner at a restaurant when the
Archangel Gabrial approaches and points to one of them. "I HAVE A GIFT
FOR YOU," the angel says. "BUT YOU MUST CHOOSE: INFINITE WISDOM OR A
MILLION DOLLARS?" Being amongst Lutheran ministers, the man chooses
wisdom, and Gabrial dissapears in a puff. "So?" one of the ministers
asks with awe in his voice, "what do you know now that you didn't know
before?" He answers: "I should have taken the money."

A man, while playing on the front nine of a complicated golf course,
became confused as to where he was on the course. Looking around, he saw
a lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her, explained his
confusion and asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. "I'm on
the 7th hole," she replied, "and you are a hole behind me. So you must
be on the 6th hole." He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the
back nine, the same thing happened and he approached her again with the
same request. "I'm on number 14, and you're still a hole behind, so you
must be on the 13th hole." Once again he thanked her and returned to his
play. He finished his round and went to the clubhouse where he saw the
same lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he
knew the lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played
the course often. He approached her and said, "Let me buy you a drink in
appreciation for your help. I understand that you're in the sales
profession. I'm in sales also. What do you sell?" "I'll tell you, but
you're going to laugh," she replied. "No, I won't." "Well, if you must
know," she answered, "I work for Tampax." With that, he laughed so hard
he almost fell off the bar stool. "See," she said. "I knew you'd laugh!"
"That's not what I'm laughing at," he replied, "I'm a salesman for
Preparation H, so I'm still a hole behind you."

I guess as an extension to the theme regarding our favorite drinks, this
