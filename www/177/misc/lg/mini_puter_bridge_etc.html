<p>
Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I've been trying to do some research on this topic, but am coming up dry
(or at least very sparse on good choices.) I'm hoping that someone here
will have an answer.
</p>

<p>
A few days ago, I got an AirPort Extreme - a wireless bridge + USB
gadget from Apple - so I could "unwire" my poor spiderwebbed laptop. Had
to set it up on a Windows machine [1], then started playing around with
the possibilities. Plugged in my new high-gain "client bridge" that's up
my mast (really, really impressive gadget, by the way
- <a href='http://islandtimepc.com/marine_wifi.html'>http://islandtimepc.com/marine_wifi.html</a>) - PoE connector snaps right
  into the WAN plug, AirPort hooks into it, life is good. Plugged in a
USB hub, hooked up my HP printer, told the AirPort software to share it
- OK, that's all fine too. Hooked up the external hard drive... um.
Well, OK, a few hours of struggling with Windows file sharing, and
Samba, and more file sharing, and... argh. My external HD is formatted
as ext3, so - no joy there, despite Macs running BSD these days. No way
am I going to reformat it. Also, plugging in an external CD-ROM was a
total fail: the AirPort doesn't recognize it, even when plugged in
directly without a hub. In addition, there's no HTTP interface on this
thing: you have to use their (Windows or Mac only) software to talk to
it.
</p>

<p>
So, the AirPort is going back to the store - but now, I'm stuck with a
dream. It would be really, <strong>really</strong> nice to just connect power and maybe
an external monitor to the laptop, and have the external drive, a
CD-ROM, the printer, and the network all available wirelessly. After
noodling on this for a bit, a small light went on. I said to myself:
"Self... what if you had a small beige box of some sort that was running
Linux and had all that stuff plugged into it?" At that point, none of
the above peripherals would present a problem: they'd just be available
<strong>stuff</strong>, accessible via standard protocols.
</p>

<p>
The only question is, what's the cheapest, smallest box that I can get?
Obviously, it needs to have at least one USB port, one Ethernet port,
and be accessible via WiFi. If it runs on 12 volts, that would be a
great plus. Recommendations on a flavor of Linux to run on this
gadget would also be welcome.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance for any suggestions!
</p>


<p>
[1] All FOSS-vs.-proprietary rhetoric aside... how the HELL do people
put up with Windows? I had to struggle through so many "YOUR MACHINE MAY
BE INFECTED!!! BUY OUR SOFTWARE ***NOW!!!***" warnings,
update-and-reboot repeats, instances of software automatically firing up
a browser and taking you to the company webpage, and completely
senseless procedures ("sharing" a network-accessible disk is a complete
lather-rinse-repeat nightmare) that I found myself literally screaming
"STOP already!" in frustration. And I'm not what you'd call
computer-illiterate, nor completely unfamiliar with Windows - although I
haven't used it in several years. That was just a horrible experience
that I hope I never have to repeat.

Our media PC is a small Atom box which can also double as a workstation:

<p>
Unfortunately I only have this link. It's propably a rebranded version
of something else. I am not sure about the 12V, because it is listed
with 19V DC.
Our media PC has a WiFi card, too.
</p>

<p>
You can also built something out of the bare bits. The Atom boards are
quite cheap, but you'd have to use an additional card for WiFi.

Well, at that price, using a low-end netbook as a bridge, etc. begins to
make sense. That's an option too, of course.
 
I should have mentioned that I'd rotated that possibility through my
brain, as well; in other words, I know that a solution exists, now it's
just a matter of tuning the "cheapest/easiest/most convenient" 3-D shape
for the best fit. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I always had a feeling that "Dopewars" wasn't developed on/for Linux...
explains a lot of things.

Results in a feeling of universal love, increased clarity of thought,

Windows: Huffing spray paint while smoking crack cocaine+PCP, with the
attendant possibility of a huge motherin' explosion. Has the synergistic
effect of making you look (and *be*) ever more stupid while getting
increasingly homicidal and hyperactive while already jonesing for the

The Aleutia T1 is a 12 volt device, Ubuntu preinstalled at no extra cost. Wifi

Yes, I use D945GCLF or D510MO boards for testing and low-powered
servers:

You can run workstations with it, too. A stock Ubuntu or Debian works
well with Xfce (and even some eye candy).

That looks pretty good - thanks, Neil! Unfortunately, the price is
nearly that of a cheap netbook - which I'm starting to incline to, given
what's been suggested here so far and what I've seen in my own searches
based on those suggestions. In fact, other than Kapil's suggestion (the
GuruPlug), there's not much available in user-ready configurations - and
even the GuruPlug requires a "JTAG" box to fully program it, which is
less than stellar. It seems that there's quite a bit of demand for this
kind of thing, but the supply side is still mostly in development.
</p>

<p>
I'm guessing that this kind of stuff will be rather ubiquitous within
the next couple of years... it's just not here yet. Oh well. Perhaps a
netbook is the right answer, especially since it can serve as a backup
if my primary netbook fails (and the backup drive would be right there,
too.)

Ah, OK. I'd have to add WiFi and build a case, though - computers don't
like the temperature fluctuations that we humans just shrug off. That's
a costly and somewhat inconvenient option for this, but I'll keep it in
mind for other things. Thanks!

That looks absolutely perfect for the job... unfortunately, it still
seems to be in the beta-test stage (the marketing is mostly oriented
toward developers), and takes about 4 weeks to ship. <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">(( Plus, the

That <em>is</em> a pain! However, check the ionics versions at

</p>

&gt; Plus, the whole thing with the JTAG interface is rather confusing:
&gt; is it actually required to get the thing running, or is it just a
&gt; developer toy/tool?
</pre>

<p>
The JTAG interface is insurance against "bricking" the device.
</p>

<p>
Martin Michlmayr is the Debian developer who has put a lot of his time
and effort into running Debian on these devices. The following web
page
 <a href='http://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug/plugs.html'>http://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug/plugs.html</a>
documents his success and otherwise. To quote him:
</p>

<p>
 "The development kits include a debugging module (either internally
 or externally) that offers access to the serial console and to JTAG.
 This debugging option is important in case something goes wrong with
 the installation or operation of Debian.  Because of the importance
 of the debugging module, I'm only planning to support development
 kits."
</p>

<p>
Note however, that the non-development versions can work just fine as
long as you don't mind the limitations of the pre-installed software.
(At least one or two plugs appear to have some version of Ubuntu
pre-installed!)
</p>

<p>
However, the fully supported (by Debian) devices are currently
WiFi-less.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I really do wish that it was easily available, though: the "server"
&gt; model seems to be precisely what I need, in a tiny wall-wart
&gt; package, at a good price. Darn it.
</pre>

<p>
On the whole I agree with you that none of the devices seems likely
to fit into your needs without some tweaking and the accompanying
risks of loss of time!

&gt; &gt; That looks absolutely perfect for the job... unfortunately, it still
&gt; &gt; seems to be in the beta-test stage (the marketing is mostly oriented
&gt; &gt; toward developers), and takes about 4 weeks to ship. <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">((

Wow - nice. The Nimbus 2000 seems like exactly the kind of thing I'm
looking for; WiFi, USB, and Ethernet, with Linux already on board, but
most of their products are usable for this application. Unfortunately,
it doesn't seem to be actually available: searching the Net got me no
useful results.

&gt; &gt; Plus, the whole thing with the JTAG interface is rather confusing:
&gt; &gt; is it actually required to get the thing running, or is it just a
&gt; &gt; developer toy/tool?
&gt; 
&gt; The JTAG interface is insurance against "bricking" the device.

<p>
I see.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; However, the fully supported (by Debian) devices are currently
&gt; WiFi-less.

<p>
Whoops... that takes right off the table, for me.

&gt; &gt; I really do wish that it was easily available, though: the "server"
&gt; &gt; model seems to be precisely what I need, in a tiny wall-wart
&gt; &gt; package, at a good price. Darn it.
&gt; 
&gt; On the whole I agree with you that none of the devices seems likely
&gt; to fit into your needs without some tweaking and the accompanying
&gt; risks of loss of time!

Oh, it's not so much a question of that - tweaking (and getting buried
in it) is pretty much a constant factor if you a) run Linux and b) are
curious. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I mean, setting up a netbook to work the way I need it to is
going to take tweaking and time and effort. I'm just saying it would be
nice to see a tiny box like the Nimbus 2000 where I can stick it in a
socket, connect it to the network with an Ethernet cable, hook it into a
USB hub to a bunch'o'devices, and have it be a WiFi-accessible AP (with
all those resources available to be used) from then on. This does not
seem like an unreasonable thing to ask; you can do this with even an
ancient, crappy desktop. Seems to me like an appliance of this sort
would be a very popular gadget... I guess these vendors are thinking
along the same lines, or are at least starting to.

Either I'm ahead of the times, or they're running behind. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
