<pre>
&gt; According to Slashdot, Zarafa has just been open sourced.
</pre>

<p>
Rules of thumb:
</p>

<p>
1.  Be skeptical of any claim that a Web 2.0 application is open source
until you've carefully examined the actual licence.  There's been an
extremely large amount of cheating, deception, and outright lying about
licensing in this market.
</p>

<p>
2.  Be doubly, super-skeptical of those claims when you go through the
project's Web front page and find <em>three</em> claims of open sourcing but
nothing whatsosever about the licence.
</p>

<p>
In this case, a great deal of digging, one <em>finally</em>, on a subpage,
finds a Sept. 18 press release saying that the "full core" of the Zarafa
platform will be at some unspecified time be available under Affero
GPLv3.  Affero GPLv3 is indeed a genuinely open source licence targeted
at the Web 2.0 / SaaS / hosted-software / ASP market -- even though it
isn't yet OSI-certified.
</p>

<p>
The real remaining question, then, is whether the "full core" --
whatever that means -- will be turn out to be a viable, useful piece of
software.  Another scam that's <em>extremely</em> common in Web 2.0 space is to 
have a deliberately buggy, undocumented, incomplete "community" version
under open source licensing, functioning strictly as a sales come-on to
upsell users to a "commercial" (proprietary) version.  
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to remember the leading example.  Hmm, Sug[censored for
reasons of legal self-defence] 
</p>

<p>
If you want to know without doing a pilot installation of your own, wait
for comments on the Debian package.  ;-&gt;

I doubt there'll be one; not from Debian itself, at least - the
licence is, as you noted, Affero GPL, which Debian do not consider
free (because the additional terms beyond those required by the
'regular' GPL fall into what Debian consider to be restrictions on the
mere use of the software).
</p>

<p>
I personally assume that their decision to relicence was motivated by
the progress in the OpenChange project, which seems likely to leapfrog
them shortly.

Noted -- for ambiguous and rather doubtful values of "Debian".  That is,
no officer or ruling body of the Debian Project has ever so ruled, nor
have the ftp masters opined to that effect.  What you (probably) really
mean is that some number of the subscribers to the unmoderated public
mailing list debian-legal, a mailing list that in no way speaks Debian's
institutional opinion and is also an absolute magnet for licensing
cranks, posted views to that effect.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately (in my opinion), some of the louder members of that
mailing list have created, via mailing list postings and Web pages, the
false impression that they are voicing the collective view of Debian
itself, when they issue such opinions.  In fact, the only authoritative
signs of Debian's stance on licensing issues are approved General
Resolutions, rulings of the Technical Committee, decisions of the DPL or
his/her deputies, or uncontested refusals of the ftp masters to accept a
submitted package.
</p>

<p>
And, for what it's worth, I <em>do</em> think the not-really-Debian's opinion
you allude to is pretty cuckoo:  The "restriction on use" is nothing
more than an obligation to offer public access to matching source code,
if/when a user deploys the covered ASP code for public use -- updating
the historic idea of copyleft for ASP/SaaS scenarios, in which
conventional copyleft mechanisms don't work.
</p>

<p>
There are of course, indeed, people who think such codebases are
non-free, just as there have always been large groups of open source
people who think copylefted code is non-free.  I just think both are
dead wrong.

<p>
Of course, there has been the usual debian-legal whack-a-mole, but I'm
almost sure I've seen evidence of deeper resistance to this kind of
licence - the details escape me, but I'm not a morning person; perhaps
I'll recall during the course of the day, as I gradually wake up.
