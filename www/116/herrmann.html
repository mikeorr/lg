<h1>Automatic creation of an Impress presentation from a series of images</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/herrmann.html">Karl-Heinz Herrmann</A></b></p>

<p>

<h3>Why would I want to use a command line tool to generate a WYSIWYG/GUI Document?</h3>
<p> Well, I don't know about you, but I am not very keen on
extremely boring and repetitive clicking through some GUI if the
task at hand doesn't need individual care for every page
done. Specifically, I had a presentation created with <a
href="http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/">LaTeX/beamer</a> in
PDF format and "boss" wanted to have a PowerPoint file. Or you
have your paper accepted at this great/important conference and you
find out they will <b>only</b> accept PPT files for a talk: no
PDF, no Impress, no own laptop.

<p> So, I found myself importing a series of identically-sized images into
a PowerPoint presentation once too often (i.e. once) and got
<b>extremely</b> bored. So bored that I started investigating if I could do
it any other way, even if it took me a week to write the program. For me,
the "perfect" solution would be to have a list of image files (e.g.,
created by '<code>ls *png &gt; file</code>'), run a script and
--<em>voila</em> -- get a PPT file, each slide containing exactly one of
the images filling the whole slide.


<h3>Finding the tools</h3>
<p>A Google (re)search showed nothing on automatic generation of PPT
files, since their internal structure is too obscure to reverse-engineer.
However, I <b>did</b> find information on the inner structure of OpenOffice
files. These are simply compressed XML files and the DTD of the XML
structure <a href="http://xml.openoffice.org/xml_specification.pdf">is
published</a>. After fast-forwarding through the 571 pages I was seriously
hoping somebody else might have done some work on this already. Indeed,
adding my favorite programming language Perl to the Google search words
produced some interesting links:

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://ooolib.sourceforge.net/doc/ooolib-0.1.5-doc.html">ooolib</a></li>
  <li>The <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmgdoc/OpenOffice-OODoc/OODoc/Intro.pod">OpenOffice::OODoc perl Module</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to give the OpenOffice::OODoc module a try.


To get the modules installed on my system I went to CPAN
(the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) by typing as root ([...] 
signifies unimportant left-out parts):

<pre class="code">
# <strong>perl -MCPAN -e shell</strong> 

cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.7601)

  /usr/bin/make install  -- OK
cpan&gt; <strong>quit</strong> 
</pre>

<p>The cpan shell realized that a prerequisite, the module XML::Twig, was
missing for OpenOffice::OODoc. It offered to fetch it automatically, which
I asked it to do. Both Twig and OODoc asked some questions during the
install, and I selected the defaults every time. After that, I had
OpenOffice::OODoc and all the prerequisites on my system and could start
reading the documentation.

<h3>The code</h3>

<p>After glancing at the <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmgdoc/OpenOffice-OODoc/OODoc/Intro.pod">Introduction</a>
and some man pages, I started checking out the examples that came with the
module. I found it interesting to find a solution for the reverse of my
problem -- extracting all images from an OpenOffice Document -- since there
is another simple method to get the images out: Just run
'<code>unzip</code>' on the *.swi, *.sxw or any other OpenOffice document.
They are nothing but a zip-file containing the content, meta files and (in
the <em>Pictures</em> subdirectory) all images of the document.

<pre class="code">
<strong>unzip -t img2ooImpressExport.swi</strong>
Archive:  img2ooImpressExport.swi
    testing: mimetype                 OK
    testing: content.xml              OK
    testing: meta.xml                 OK
    testing: styles.xml               OK
    testing: settings.xml             OK
    testing: META-INF/manifest.xml    OK
    testing: Pictures/Seite_1.jpg     OK
    testing: Pictures/Seite_2.jpg     OK
No errors detected in compressed data of img2ooImpressExport.swi.
</pre>


<p>After some digging around in the documentation I came up with the
following <a href="misc/herrmann/img2ooImpress.pl.txt">Perl code</a>:

<pre class="code">
use OpenOffice::OODoc;

# start a new document
my $document = ooDocument
  (
   file            =&gt; 'outputfile.swi',
   create          =&gt; 'presentation'
  );

$document-&gt;createImageStyle("slide");

# loop over image file names (open is outside of this snippet)
my $i=1;
while (my $imgfile=&lt;IN&gt;){
  chomp($imgfile);


# start a new page/slide
  my $page = $document-&gt;appendElement
    ('//office:body',0,'draw:page');

# include the image at full size
my $image=  $document-&gt;createImageElement
    (
     "Slide".$i,
     description     =&gt; "image ".$i." filename:".$imgfile,
     page            =&gt; $page,
     position        =&gt; "0,0",
     import          =&gt; $imgfile,
     size            =&gt; "28cm, 21cm",
     style           =&gt; "slide"
    );

$i++;

}

$document-&gt;save;
</pre>

<p>The <a href="misc/herrmann/img2ooImpress.pl.txt">complete script</a>
includes some file-handling and reads the image list. The hardest part was
figuring out how to add a new page in an Impress presentation, since I
could only find examples which modified a document (inserting an image
after some text, etc.) but none that created new pages. Some digging in the
other man-pages and the doc-folder (if you have '<code>locate</code>'
installed and ran '<code>updatedb</code>' after the OODoc installation,
'<code>locate OODoc</code>' will find all of them) started me in the
right direction.

<p>In the created *swi file, the very first slide is left blank (named
"First Page") and every other page contains one image, named
consecutively "Slide N". I didn't bother figuring out how to drop that
first page. Also OpenOffice seems to have changed the file extensions
between versions: Impress files could be *.swi or *.sxi. The script
takes either one or two arguments: The necessary file with the list of
images (one filename each line) and an optional output filename
(default img2ooImpressExport.swi).  The images are automatically
aligned, so animations in the PDF (each animation step is a new page)
will play out smoothly in Impress/PowerPoint. That was one of the most
annoying things with manually importing single images into PPT --
realigning and rescaling so the images won't jump from slide to slide.


<p> If you would like to add a title or other text to the slides you
could just modify the position and size specification in the
createImageElement block. The page specification adds the image
anchored to the page. The <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~jmgdoc/OpenOffice-OODoc/OODoc/Intro.pod#Manipulating_graphics">
Info page</a> gives an example where an image is anchored to a new
paragraph. The Intro page is also accessible by:

<pre>
man OpenOffice::OODoc::Intro
</pre>

<p>Other examples that came with the Perl module create spreadsheets from
*.csv files ('<code>oobuild</code>') or create swriter files from text
source ('<code>text2ooo</code>').

<h3>So what about PPT?</h3>

<p>Impress is quite capable of opening and then exporting the created
file to PPT-format, and PowerPoint will not even be able to turn Vector
arrows into letters, much less mess about with text colors and other
annoyances I see regularly at conferences.


<h3>How to convert from LaTeX/PDF files</h3>

<p>A cheap way of converting a LaTeX-created PDF presentation (e.g., <a
href="http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/">beamer</a>, <a
href="http://prosper.sourceforge.net/">prosper</a> or (limited in
animation capabilities) <a
href="http://texpower.sourceforge.net/">TeXPower</a>) is to convert
every PDF page into an image and run the images through img2ooImpress.pl.
The PDF-to-image conversion can be handled by ghostscript (gs). '<code>gs -h</code>'
will show some useful options and a list of formats it can export
to. Look for pngalpha, png16m, and jpeg as useful image formats. If
pngalpha (PNG with antialias rendering) is available, you can run
something similar to:

<pre>
gs -dNOPAUSE -g1024x768 -r205 -sDEVICE=pngalpha \
 -sOutputFile=Talkimg_%d.png  -dBATCH Talk.pdf
</pre>

which creates 1024x768-sized, antialiased PNG images, consecutively
numbered Talkimg_1.png to however many pages were in the PDF. The -r205
specifies the resolution which fits PDF files produced with
'<code>pdflatex</code>' and the beamer class. For other PDF files you will
want to change the resolution so you fill the 1024x768 pixels as close as
possible. '<code>gs</code>' either pads with white or just clips your pages
if the '-r' does not match the '-g' option. With pages rendered exactly at
destination resolution no additional scaling will occur and the images
should look good on the screen. Alternatively, you can generate the images
too large and let Impress do the scaling (image size is set to full page in
the script) so they will fit on the slide, e.g.:

<pre>
gs -dNOPAUSE -r300 -sDEVICE=pngalpha \
 -sOutputFile=Talkimg_%d.png  -dBATCH Talk.pdf
</pre>

which again is OK for a beamer-class PDF file as the slides are rather
small. For a PDF document in A4 landscape, 300 dpi is way too high (-r
specifies the dpi resolution for which '<code>gs</code>' should render the
image). Switching from page to page will get really slow if the images are
much larger then the actual resolution.

<pre>
ls -rt *_1024.jpg &gt; imglist
img2ooImpress.pl imglist MyTalk.swi
</pre>

then converts the images into an Impress file.  Since the '<code>gs</code>'
image is generated without padding zeros, i.e. 1, 2, ..., 10, 11, ..., the
"ls -rt *png" reverse sorts by file modification time and gets the page
sequence right. For some reason, this doesn't work right on all systems and
the file list is still not sorted properly.

There are several methods to create the filenames with enough left hand
zeros so they can be used in "alphabetic" order. If you have "mmv"
installed, and you used a file name structure like File_[num].png, you could
use:

<pre>
mmv "*_?.png" "#1_0#2.png"
</pre>

Here "mmv" will replace #1 with whatever the first wildcard matches and
will add one zero left of every single digit number. #2 will become the
number before the change. It's straightforward to extend this to more
padding zeros.

Another option is a Perl-based renaming script as in the <a
href="http://www.unix.org.ua/orelly/perl/cookbook/ch09_10.htm">perl
cookbook</a> or a slightly <a
href="misc/herrmann/rename.pl.txt">modified version</a> which lets you
test a regular expression until you tell it to actually do the rename
by adding as first option "-x", i.e.:

<pre>
rename.pl -x 's/(\d+)/sprintf "%03d", $1/e' Talkimg*png
</pre>

which pads left-hand zeros so all images have three digits. A simple
'<code>ls "Talkimg*png" &gt; list</code>' will now create the properly
sorted list for '<code>img2ooImpress.pl</code>'.


<h3>Drawbacks</h3>

<p> The one major drawback is that any navigational link in the PDF
('<code>beamer</code>' can add a full clickable table of contents in a
sidebar) is lost. Text changes can only be added in the Impress/PPT file by
overlaying boxes to hide the original text and adding new text on top of
that. However, with the suggested small modification in the size and
position specification, you could still create preformatted pages which
only need the additional title and/or text; then, you could easily choose
Insert-NewSlide, insert-Graphics-fromFile, align and resize to fit, etc. 


<h3>Other uses?</h3> 

<p> With the rise of digital cameras and the disappearance of color
slides (do you still have some?), why not create an Impress or
PowerPoint presentation from your latest holiday photos? (assuming Bash
usage):

<pre class="code">
cd your/image/dir
for i in *jpg; do
convert -geometry 1024x768 $i `basename $i .jpg`_1024.jpg
done
ls *_1024.jpg &gt; list
img2ooImpress.pl list img2ooImpressExport.swi
</pre>

You could then run '<code>soffice img2ooImpressExport.swi</code>' to see
the resulting presentation.

<p> The 'for' loop and 'convert' (from ImageMagick) scale the images down
to 1024x768 (most beamers won't use anything larger) and you could throw in
a gamma correction (-gamma x), watermark, added text, rotation, sharpening
or whatever (see "<code>man convert</code>" for details).

I'm a physicist working on magnetic resonance at the university hospital in
Jena, Germany. I started out with Linux as it made the leap to 2.0.0 and
have been running my home PC under Linux since then. The Laptop and an
AMD64 box also run under Linux. With computers, I started out in school
when they got Commodore PET 4040 boxes and later the very first PCs. Around
that time I picked up a Ti99/4a and did some assembler progamming (nice
16bit command set and relocateable registers) on that one since it was so
damn slow in BASIC. At the university I finally got my fingers on a SUN ELC
worksation and have tried to stay with Unix systems afterwards.
