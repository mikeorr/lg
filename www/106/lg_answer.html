<p>
Greetings, everyone, and welcome once more to the world of The Answer Gang.
It's sunny September where I'm sittign but for some places the storms are
rolling in. (See our <a href="lg_mail.html">Mailbag</a> for soggy details.)

</p><p>
Meanwhile, it's getting toward Autumn.  The blustering winds are starting 
to tug at the leaves, the blustering television sings of back to school and 
fall fashions.  What have these to do with the world of techies?  Not much...

</p><p>
Well, hold on a second there.  Actually, the start of new academic
seasons give the open source world a new batch of bored students and busy
computer science departments with fat links to work on new projects.
Techie bits <em>have</em> come up in the fashion world - depending
on just how far away from the techie world you are, fashion might
have been what dragged Linux into your view, as the Burlington Coat
Factory sometime ago 
(<a href="../issue46/lg_bytes46.html">about 5 years now</a>) held a certain
large hardware vendor over a barrel by taking them up on their system
preload offer, but wanting the "ordinary consumer" class of systems
<em>en masse</em> rather than a few rackmount servers.  Since then, <a
href="http://www.linuxvalue.com/burlington.shtml">Burlington expanded
their Linux use company wide</a> and appear to be pretty darn happy
with it.

</p><p>
Let me take a woman's intuition on a little shopping trip, then,
and see where else Linux has come into fashion... I'm not talking
T-shirts, mind you.  I can get those at trade shows. I can buy them at
<a href="http://thinkgeek.org">ThinkGeek</a>.  I'm not talking about
silly tidbits like a tie with 47 pictures of Tux on it.  The ability to
wear bumper sticker and <tt>/usr/share/games/fortunes</tt> sorts of wit
is not fashion.  I'm talking about the world where some crazy designers
feel compelled to reinvent crayola colors every 6 months or so and force
beautiful slinky babes (of both genders) to walk up and down a long stage
wearing... err, well, sometimes it doesn't look silly, but often it does.

</p><p>
What doesn't help is how hard this can be to shop for.  Search engines are
with "in this fashion..." and "accessories" will get you peripherals.  I
really had to pull out the stops for this.  You won't find it on freshmeat
either (though I did find yet another lightweight wm called 
<a href="http://wmi.berlios.de">WMI</a>).

</p><p>
You want jewelry, you have to look for jewelry  - amd apparently it helps
if you spell this the long way.  <a href="http://www.linuxjewellery.com/">Linux
Jewellery</a> has quite the debian collection, and some BSD stuff too.

</p><p>
You ladies who want to show off your fondness for Red Hat instead, consider these.  Sorry it's not a fedora:
<a href="http://www.thesilvermonkey.com/redhatsocietythemefashionjewelry.html">http://www.thesilvermonkey.com/redhatsocietythemefashionjewelry.html</a>

</p><p>
OTOH, sometimes a hat is just a hat.  As early as 3 years ago some people
were seeking geek chic that didn't include looking like "the techie" from
several hundred feet away.  THis article from that time relates, and I'm
pleased to say many of its links are ever still good.  Dress shirts wired
for techie bits?  My goodness:
<br><a href="http://www.geek.com/pdageek/features/chic/index.htm">http://www.geek.com/pdageek/features/chic/index.htm</a>

</p><p>
That was 2001. In 2002, CNN wondered if wearable computing would hit the 
fall fashion highlights with an MP3 jacket. "We're just demonstrating the 
technology." they cried, it's not like we want <em>money</em> for this.
Working with partners, etc.  Get the giggles yourself while reding this:
<br><a href="http://news.com.com/2008-1082-941578.html">http://news.com.com/2008-1082-941578.html</a>
</p><p>
Will wonders not cease.  It was shown off, among other curious inncations
of the fashion world, at a fashion conference earlier this year.  Infineon
really has partnered with Rosner for a
<a href="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/OttawaSun/Business/2004/07/27/pf-558219.html">MP3 denim jacket</a>
(well it <em>looks</em> denim; I could be wrong) and O'Neill for a 
<a href="http://www.akibalive.com/archives/000512.html">MP3 enabled snowboarding jacket</a>
 -- now you "Extreme Linux" fans have something to wear. 
</p><p>
No idea what OS the players use, sorry - fashion doesn't care about that.
Is the open source concept affecting fashion more directly?  Maybe not.
But <a href="http://www.oekonux.de/projekt/liste/archive/msg03909.html">someone's thinking about it</a>.
</p><p>
Amazing.  Maybe we're getting somewhere.  Until next month, folks.  I and
my red straw hat are off shopping.
