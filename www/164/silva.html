<h1>Fedora 11 on the Eee PC 1000</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>


<p><img src="misc/silva/fedora11-Eee.jpg" align="right"> Red Hat's sponsored
<a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Project</a> just released its
11<sup>th</sup> version of the RPM based distribution this month, and as a
long time user, I thought I'd share a few things I had to do to get Fedora 11
running smoothly on my Eee PC 1000.</p>
<p>First things first, if time is an issue for you, I highly recommend
downloading the Fedora Live image, and laying out the image on a <a href= 
"http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/USBHowTo">CD or an USB key</a>.
Using this live image will save you time downloading the packages, and also
installing them on your computer, specially on netbooks like the Eee PC that
may have higher disk space constraints than other types of computers.</p>
<h3>Wireless</h3>
<p>With the Eee PC 1000, you will need to have access to the wired network
connection, since your wireless will not work out of the box. Here's what you
need to do to get it working:</p>
<p>The wireless drivers are available at the RPM repo site: <a href= 
"http://www.rpmfusion.org/">RPM Fusion</a>.</p>
<ol type='a'>
<li>Installing the yum repo:
<pre class="code">
su -c 'rpm -Uvh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-stable.noarch.rpm http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-stable.noarch.rpm'
</pre></li>
<li>Once the repo is installed, you will need to install the rpm for the
driver, as the root user:
<pre class="code">
yum install akmod-rt2860
</pre></li>
<li>Reboot the Eee PC. The first time the system will compile your driver at
boot time, so you will probably have to wait an extra minute for it to boot.
Reboot it again. Now the driver will be loaded. Once you login into GNOME or
KDE, you will be able to see the wireless access points available.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<ol type='a'>
<li><strong>On GNOME:</strong> Fedora 11 is using a new sound mixer in GNOME
that allows the user to have more flexibility in controlling the volumes of
different applications using the newer PulseAudio technology. Although I did
gain control over the sound volumes of my applications, at least on the Eee
PC I was not able to configure the volume on all the available channels
through the mixer's GUI. The workaround is simple:
<pre class="code">
alsamixer -c0
</pre>
<p>And you should be able to change the volume on the channels that may not
be showing up on the new Fedora volume control application.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>On KDE:</strong>
<p>Even though I am really liking KDE 4.2 on Fedora 11, I did find that, at
least on my Eee PC, PulseAudio and KDE aren't playing nicely together. What I
did to resolve the problem was to remove PulseAudio:</p>
<pre class="code">
yum remove pulseaudio
</pre>
<p>Which may not be optimal for some, since the bluetooth software that comes
on Fedora depends on the PulseAudio RPMs. A less drastic solution is to
remove the PulseAudio ALSA plugin:</p>
<pre class="code">
yum remove alsa-plugins-pulseaudio
</pre>
<p>Make sure that you don't forget to log out and log back in for the changes
to take effect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Touchpad</h3>
<p>The touchpad's 'tap-to-click' functionality is disabled by default. Here's
how to enable it:</p>
<ol type='a'>
<li><strong>On GNOME:</strong>
<pre class="code">
System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Mouse
</pre>
<p>Choose the 'Touchpad' tab, and click on 'Enable mouse clicks with
touchpad'.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>On KDE:</strong>
<p>To enable 'tap-to-click' I had add a shell script under
$HOME/.kde/Autostart/ with the following content:</p>
<pre class="code">
synclient TapButton1=1 TapButton2=3 TapButton3=2
</pre>
<p>The value for each button represents the number of fingers touching the
pad. That will enable 'tap-to-click' every time you login.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Suspend/Resume</h3>
<p>I am very pleased to see that suspend to RAM is working virtually
flawlessly for me. I haven't had the netbook fail to suspend or resume for
me, although every once in a while the battery meter applet seems to get
confused about how much 'juice' is actually left on the device.</p>
<h3>Google's Picasa</h3>
<p>You won't be able to login to your Google's Picasa Web on Fedora 11 using
Picasa 3, unless you install openssl-devel:</p>
<pre class="code">
yum install openssl-devel
</pre>
<h3>Firefox 3.5 (beta)</h3>
<p>One physical limitation of current netbooks is the size of the screen
associated with the resolution it supports. For example, the Eee PC 1000
comes with a 10.2" screen running at 1024x600 pixels making it important to
maximize your data display capacity while minimizing the screen space taken
by menus, task bars, etc. Here's what I've done:</p>
<p><img src="misc/silva/eee-pc.jpg" border='1'></p>
<p>I've removed Fedora's top panel while running GNOME, and added everything
I need from Gnome onto the bottom panel. As far as Firefox goes, here are a
few things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove 'Status bar' and 'Bookmarks Bar'. (Under 'View' on the main
menu).</li>
<li>Install the <a href=
"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/307">Littlefox</a>
theme.</li>
<li>Customize your toolbars to 'Use small icons'.</li>
<li>Install <a href=
"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1455">Tiny Menu</a>, once you
do that, move all of the items from your 'Navigation Toolbar' to the Main
Menu, and hide the 'Navigation Toolbar' under View.</li>
<li>Install <a href=
"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865">Adblock Plus</a> which
will eliminate a lot of junk ads from websites like cnn.com (see screenshot
above).</li>
<li>Install <a href=
"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5721">Fastdial</a> add-on,
that replaces the functionality of the 'Bookmarks Bar' in case you are lazy
like me.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A little less than 18 months ago, it was almost impossible to get Fedora
running smoothly on the 7" Eee PCs; back in those days Fedora had its own
spin called <a href= 
"http://magazine.redhat.com/2008/02/14/fedora-eee-pc-eeedora/">Eeedora</a>
that would give the Eee PC enough functionality to make it usable, but not
without its quirks. Now, with Fedora 11, the user is able to experience the
full flexibility and mobility of the Eee PC with virtually no headaches.</p>
