<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
Is there anyone using icewm+idesk combination ? I have seen that
wallpaper support is already there in idesk; more over changing the wall
paper from a source folder is also possible. But is it all theory ? I
can't get the wallpaper working in box. I am using idesk  0.7.5-4.
</p>

<p>
Any success from anyone ?
</p>

<p>
Please CC to me

It works fine for me; I described the setup in the article that I wrote
(<a href='../../../160/okopnik.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/160/okopnik.html</a>). You know, the one that I
pointed you to at the time. Have you read it yet? Perhaps you should.

Hello Ben,
</p>

<p>
Yes, I read it. But for me it is not working unfortunately. idesk always reports 
</p>

<pre>

[idesk] Background's source not found.
</pre>

<p>
Though I have the configuration in my .ideskrc
</p>

#Background.Source: /home/joy/pics/Father

<p>
In the example .ideskrc file at: 
<a href='http://idesk.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Idesk-usage'>http://idesk.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Idesk-usage</a>
</p>

<p>
it contains this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
Background.File: image.jpg
Background.Delay: 1
Background.Source: ~/.idesktop/icons
Background.Mode: Mirror
Background.Color: #C2CCFF
</pre>

<p>
which suggest that you need to provide these lines instead:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
Background.Source: /home/joy/pics/Father
Background.File: Father.jpg
Background.Mode: Center
Background.Color: #FFFFFF
</pre>

<p>
Can you try having a go with them?
</p>

<p>
Good luck,
</p>

&gt;
&gt; I don't know of any. I've just tried using "strace", but it shows idesk
&gt; reading the config file, then generating the 'not found' message - no
&gt; other info. Seems to me that idesk is broken in this regard: it works
&gt; fine when I use it my preferred way (i.e., a random image from a
&gt; directory), but doesn't work with a specified single image.

<p>
As a temporary workaround, have several copies of the image with
different filenames and have it randomly select from them.

Your best bet is to file a bug.
