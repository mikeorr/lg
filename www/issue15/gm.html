	After much delay, I've finally started learning about the Blue Moon
	Rendering Tools (BMRT).  It seemed only natural that I take what I
	learned and pass it on to my readers.  So, starting this month, I'm
	going to do a three-part series on BMRT and RenderMan&reg 
	shaders.  I've gotten help, of course.  My thanks go out
	to Paul Sargent for providing example code and a place to bounce
	ideas off and to Larry Gritz, author of BMRT, for general support 
	and technical assistance.
	The first in this three-part series is an
	introduction to the tools and some relatively simple
	examples on how to use them.
	
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	Although the BMRT articles are a big project in themselves, I don't
	want to devote 3 entire issues of the Muse to just BMRT.  
	In this months column I'll also be covering a few other topics.
	<UL>
		<LI> A review of Mark Kilgard's <I>OpenGL Programming for 
			the X Window System</I>.
		<LI> Information on scanner support for Linux.
	</UL>
	Both of these go into some detail.  Along with the usual set of 
	Mews offerings, this should be enough to hold you until next month.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	I was going to do a bit on John Beale's wonderful tool, HF-Lab, 
	this month but
	decided to wait until next month.  I happened to run across a few other
	POV-Ray tips recently and thought that the set of tips along with 
	the HF-Lab review would fit well together.  Look for them next month.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	An update on my crashed system woes:  my little network at home uses a
	386 16Mhz Dell computer as a server for doing backups.  I had set it up
	but had not implemented the backups when my main system bit the bucket.
	After getting my main system running again, I ended up with some extra
	drives that I wanted to put in my server.  I first tried to make backups of
	my main system, across the network, using a version of taper that I had
	installed on my main system and just copied over to the server.  That sort
	of worked, but for some reason taper wouldn't see some of my target
	directories.  I figured it was incompatible with the installation I had on
	the 386, so I upgraded to Linux Pro (which is what I installed on my main
	system).  Mistake.  The server stopped working.  The problem is a secondary
	IDE that I added to make use of the extra hard disks.  I mucked with it for
	a week, got fed up and now have a new Cyrix 166, motherboard, and mini
	tower on order.  The motherboard and 166 are going in the main box, and the
	old 486 and motherboard are going in the mini tower.  I'm retiring the 386.
	It will take its rightful place next to my retired Wyse286 PC with its
	20M hard drive.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	I never wanted to be a system administrator.  I just want to <B>use</B>
	my systems.  <I>sigh</I>  At least with Linux I have more control over
	what I use.
	<BR clear=both>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
	So, one month after disaster hit, I still don't have reliable backups 
	running.  There is money to be made in making backups easy for Linux
	users.  I guarantee it.

		<P><FONT size=3><B>Q and A</B></FONT>
		<P>
		<I>Q: Is displacment mapping the same thing as reaction-diffusion?
		</I>
		<P>
		A: 
		No.  Reaction-diffusion simulates the mixing of chemicals, which
		is theorized to have something to do with certain organic texture
		patterns, like leopard skin.
		<P>
		Bump mapping is perturbing the normal of an object to simulate
		bumps, but without actually moving points on the surface.
		<P>
		Displacement mapping does what bump mapping merely simulates -
		it actually distorts the surface points of the
		object which is being mapped.  This avoids
		artifacts you get from the bump mapping approximation (like actually
		making the silhouettes rough).                 
		You can think of it as a height field over an arbitrary surface.

		<P>
		<I>Q:
		What is a stochastic raytracer and are there any freely
		available?
		</I>

		<P>A:
		"Stochastic sampling" or "distribution ray tracing" (it's not called
		distributed these days) refers to placing samples at irregular
		intervals, rather than regularly spacing them.  It doesn't have
		anything to do with the number of rays per pixel -- 1 sample per pixel
		can easily be jittered, and 100 samples per pixel can be regularly
		spaced.  Also, it's not dependent on ray tracing -- PRMan uses
		stochastic sampling and it uses a scanline method.
		<P>
		Technically, stochastic sampling transfers high frequency signal
		energy above the Nyquist limit into noise, rather than having that
		energy alias as lower frequencies.  It's just trading one artifact for
		another, but by coincidence the human visual system appears to find
		noise less objectionable than aliasing.
		<P>
		BMRT is a stochastic raytracers.  POV-Ray is reported to be
		(but no official word if it is or not).
		Others include (not all are raytracers):
		PRMan, Mental Ray, and Alias.

		<P>
		Thanks to Larry Gritz for these definitions.

		<P>
		<I>Q:
		What is tessellation?
		</I>

		<P>A:
		Mark Kilgard writes the following in his 
		<I>OpenGL Programming for the X Window System</I>:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
		In computer graphics, tessellation is the process of breaking a
		complex geometric surface into simple convex polygons.  
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		The use of convex polygons allow for better performance in OpenGL.

		<P>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		There are a growing number of Application Programming 
		Interfaces (API's) available for Linux that enable software 
		developers to create programs that render 3D graphics.  
		Some of these are designed to allow programs to output
		data files that can be used by rendering engines to create
		a 3D image either to a display or to a file.  The libribout.a
		static library in the BMRT package is an example of this 
		kind of interface.   It allows the software developer to 
		write a program to output a RIB formatted file which can
		then be used by a RenderMan&reg compliant renderer.
		Other tools are designed for interactive 3D display.  
		One such developer tool is OpenGL.
		OpenGL is, if not the grandfather, the God Father
		of all interactive 3D development tools.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		OpenGL is an API designed by Silicon Graphics and now 
		managed by the OpenGL Architecture Review Board.  
		It is defined by the <I>OpenGL Programming Guide</I> 
		as follows:
		<BLOCKQUOTE>
			<FONT size=2>
			The OpenGL graphics system is a software interface to graphics 
			hardware.  (The GL stands for Graphics Library.)  It allows
			you to create interactive programs that produce color images
			of moving three-dimensional objects.
			</FONT>
		</BLOCKQUOTE>
		The interface is a window system independent interface
		to graphics hardware.  In order to use OpenGL with a particular
		windowing system, it must be used with a supplemental API.
		This supplemental API allows OpenGL to create its graphics contexts
		and windows in which OpenGL will do its rendering.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Linux uses as its windowing system the X Window System, as do
		most, if not all, other Unices.  To use OpenGL with X Windows, the
		software developer must become familiar with GLX, the X Extension
		for OpenGL, along with one or more toolkits such as the X Toolkit
		(Xt) and a widget set like Motif (Xm).  This is not a simple task.
		Just learning Xm can be a full time occupation (I know, it's what
		I do now).  Fortunately, Mark Kilgard has provided a very thorough
		text on integrating OpenGL with the X environment:
		<I>OpenGL Programming for the X Windows System</I>.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		This text contains 6 detailed chapters, 1 chapter devoted to 
		an example application, and a number of very useful appendices.
		The first two chapters introduce the reader to OpenGL and the
		two libraries that generally accompany it:  GLU, the GL Utility
		library that is used for certain operations that are hardware
		inspecific such as polygon tesselation, and GLX.  The introduction
		is quite good except for explaining the use of GLU.  All OpenGL
		functions are prefixed with "gl" except for the GLU functions which
		are prefixed with "glu".  I can understand why they did this, but
		it is confusing to remember that OpenGL is actually two sets of 
		functions with different prefixes (as if the X Windows system 
		didn't provide enough of these already).

		Chapter 3 is a detailed explanation of how to use OpenGL
		with Motif.  The basic premise is that you need to combine OpenGL
		(gl and glu routines) with the X Extension for OpenGL (GLX) and
		the widget set of choice (Xm along with Xt to manage the widget
		set).  That seems like a lot of work.  Not to mention that writing 
		an OpenGL application this way, with the X calls embedded in the source,
		removes the portability that a developer originally had with just
		OpenGL.  It would be nice if there were a way to remove the X
		calls and have a truly portable OpenGL application.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		There is.  Mark introduces the GLUT library in Chapter 4
		which hides most (not all) of the window system specific API calls 
		from the developer.  This toolkit, although not necessarily
		appropriate for full-featured OpenGL applications, provides an
		example of a toolkit which can handle window system API's for
		the developer and allow the developer to write a single source code
		base portable to any platform.  The toolkit itself can be implemented
		in X, Windows NT or any other windowing system.  The application
		developer only needs access to the toolkit.

		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Chapter 4 is an introduction to the more basic features of GLUT.
		It covers such topics as window management, callbacks, and font rendering.
		Chapter 5 goes into significantly more depth.  Its 90+ pages cover
		topics ranging from lighting and texture mapping to using images
		and bitmaps to curves and surfaces.  This chapter will be the one
		most readers will refer to repeatedly when they've gotten past
		their first sample OpenGL programs using GLUT.  Chapter 6 covers
		advanced topics such as the X Input Extension, Overlays, and
		peformance issues.

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		There are 3 appendices, the most interesting of which is the
		"Functional Description of the GLUT API".  This is a reference
		section for the most part although it is not formatted with one page 
		per function.  This makes it a little hard to find what you're
		looking for since more than one function can be on a page.  Other than 
		that it's a fairly complete description of the GLUT API.  There is
		also a glossary that follows the appendices.
		
		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Mark includes extensive sample code right from the start of the text.
		All the code is available for download from the Internet.
		The code is easy to follow and the accompanying text is well
		written.  Although Mark does not spend time explaining how to program 
		with the X Windows System (knowledge of which is a prerequisite 
		for this text)
		he does thoroughly cover how to integrate OpenGL with the X 
		environment.  After explaining how this would work he then provides
		detailed information about how to remove the windowing system
		specific calls by using GLUT.  

		<BR clear=both>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		I find <I>OpenGL Programming for the X Windows System</I>
		a very well-written, thoroughly descriptive explanation on how
		software developers can integrate OpenGL with their X Windows
		applications.

The following links are just starting points for finding more information
about computer graphics and multimedia in general for Linux systems.  If
you have some application specific information for me, I'll add them to my
other pages or you can contact the maintainer of some other web site.  I'll
consider adding other general references here, but application or site
specific information needs to go into one of the following general 
references and not listed here.
