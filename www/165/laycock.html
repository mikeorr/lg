<h1>GNOME and Red Hat Linux Eleven Years Ago</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/laycock.html">Oscar Laycock</a></b></p>

<p>
Four years ago, I switched on an old PC and found a seven year old (at
that time) copy of Linux on it. I still use parts of the 1998 Red Hat
Linux, today.  </p>

<h3>Red Hat Linux in 1998</h3>

<img src="misc/laycock/redhat.png" alt="powered by Red Hat Linux" width="107" height="58">

<p>
My copy of Red Hat Linux is 5.1, codenamed "Manhattan". It was released
on May 22, 1998. The first Red Hat Linux 1.0 was released on November 3,
1994. Finally, Red Hat Linux merged with Fedora on 22 September 2003,
when Red Hat started Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I bought an official
boxed set with a manual in the autumn of 1998, for &pound;29.95 (British
Pounds), from a mail-order catalogue. The catalogue also listed Slackware
3.5, Debian 1.3, TurboLinux 2.0, Caldera 1.2, FreeBSD 2.2.7, and BSD
Lite 4.4. Before then, I had been using <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_(operating_system)">Coherent</a>,
a Unix Version 7 clone, originally produced for the PDP-11 in 1980 and
ported to the IBM PC in 1983.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/box.jpg" alt="boxed set of Red Hat 5.1" width="412" height="309">

<p>
The kernel is 2.0.34. It does not support thread-local storage, so I get
an error when I run a program built with a recent compiler.  </p>

<p>
Red Hat Linux 5.1 includes a "Linux Applications CD", a collection of
third-party programs. It has versions of 
WordPerfect<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>, Tripwire, and
several relational databases.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/wordperf.png" alt="Wordperfect" width="600" height="450">

<h3>Free software in 1998</h3>

<img src="misc/laycock/linux.png" alt="Linux logo from LDP Linux Programming Guide" width="110" height="88">

<p>
Netscape <a
href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/netrev.html">released</a>
the source code of its browser and Communicator suite on March 31, 1998.
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/netscape.png" alt="Netscape Navigator" width="600" height="450">

<p>
The GNU C Library, glibc, for my Red Hat 5.1 is version 2.0.7. Red Hat
Linux 4.2, released in May 1997, was the last Red Hat Linux based on the
Linux libc "libc 5". The Linux kernel developers had forked glibc in the
early 1990's. Their last version was called libc.so.5. According to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libc6">Wikipedia</a>, "when FSF
released glibc 2.0 in 1996, it had a much more complete POSIX standards
support, better internationalisation/multilingual support, support for
IPv6, 64-bit data access, support for multithreaded applications, future
versions compatibility support, and the code was more portable. At this
point, the Linux kernel developers discontinued their fork and returned
to using FSF's glibc." The new glibc 2.x series was given the internal
name "libc.so.6".  </p>

<p>
It was the time of the EGCS fork of the GNU C compiler. EGCS stood for
"Experimental/Enhanced GNU Compiler System". My Red Hat 5.1 includes an
early version, 1.0.2, released on March 18, 1998. But the default
compiler is gcc for stability.  GCC development followed a "cathedral"
model and had become quite conservative. In 1997, a group of developers,
some from Cygnus, formed EGCS to merge several forks, including g77
(Fortran), Pentium optimizations and many C++ improvements. According to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">Wikipedia</a>,
"EGCS development proved considerably more vigorous than GCC
development, so much so that the FSF officially halted development on
their GCC 2.x compiler, 'blessed' EGCS as the official version of GCC
and appointed the EGCS project as the GCC maintainers in April 1999." It
was at that time that GCC was renamed the "GNU Compiler Collection".
</p>

<p>
Red Hat 5.1 came with a 2.0.1 version of PHP/FI. Developer Rasmus
Lerdorf warned that it is "quickly going to be superseded by Version
3.0", citing "dramatic improvements".  PHP3 was released on June 19
1998. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP_(programming_language)">Wikipedia</a>
says, "Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, two Israeli developers at the
Technion IIT, rewrote the parser in 1997 and formed the basis of PHP 3,
changing the language's name to the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext
Preprocessor<a href="#2"><strong>[2]</strong></a> ... Suraski and
Gutmans then started a new rewrite of PHP's core, producing the Zend
Engine in 1999. They also founded Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan,
Israel." </p>

<p>
KDE 1.0 was released on 12 July 1998. KDE was founded in 1996. In
November 1998, Qt became open source, dual-licensed under the open QPL
and a commercial license for proprietary development.  </p>


<h3>1998 GNOME beta</h3>

<img src="misc/laycock/logo.png" alt="GNOME logo" width="150" height="46">

<p>
Red Hat 5.1 includes a preview of the GNOME desktop environment, a beta
release.  The release notes say, "It is the results of about 4 months of
feverish work by an Internet-based development team." GNOME development
was announced in August 1997. The first major GNOME release, version
1.0, was to be in March 1999.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gnome.png" alt="GNOME" width="600" height="450">

<p>
The GNOME distribution's README file says: "It is indisputable that
Linux is a rock-solid server OS, but traditionally Linux has not catered
as much to the typical desktop user, who wants to write email, browse the
web, etc. The GNOME project aims to provide a desktop environment that
will be friendly to novice users, but at the same time provide the power
and flexibility that advanced users expect." </p>

<p>
GNOME did not come with a window manager. You could just run the GNOME
panel from your .xinitrc file, as in:
</p>

<pre>
panel &amp;
background-properties --init &amp;
keyboard-properties --init &amp;
mouse-properties --init &amp;
fvwm2 -f .fvwm2rc.gnome     # disable fvwm2 taskbar
</pre>

<p>
The background, keyboard, and mouse properties programs restore your
previous settings for the background image, mouse sensitivity, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>file manager</strong> is a GNOME version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Commander">GNU Midnight Commander</a>, a clone of Norton Commander. Midnight Commander has a text user interface and is still <a href="http://www.midnight-commander.org/">developed</a> today. 
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gmc.png" alt="GNOME Midnight Commander" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>image viewer</strong> is Electric Eyes, developed by "The
Rasterman", Carsten Haiztler, at Red Hat Advanced Development Labs. He
worked on the Enlightenment desktop. It was one of the first
applications to use Imlib, an X-based imaging toolkit. You can crop
images, do simple color table tweaking, and resize or rotate images. It
was superseded by Eye of Gnome and GQView, neither of which had any
image manipulation features. The last release of Electric Eyes seems to
be 0.3.12 in July 2000.<a href="#3"><strong>[3]</strong></a> It last
appeared in Red Hat Linux 7.3, released in May 2002. It still appeared in
Mandriva till 2007.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/ee.png" alt="GNOME Midnight Commander" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The release notes have a section on "GNOME Tricks", "a preview of the
awesome abilities DnD will bring to your desktop". You can drag an
image from GNOME Midnight Commander or Electric Eyes, onto the panel or
the background-properties dialog, to set their respective backgrounds. You
can also drag an image from GNOME Midnight Commander onto Electric Eyes.
You can print a file by dragging it from Midnight Commander onto the
print applet in the panel.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>GIMP</strong> is on the GNOME "graphics" menu alongside
Electric Eyes. It is version 0.99.28: </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gimp.png" alt="The GIMP" width="580" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>file open dialog</strong> is much simpler than today's:
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/fileopen.png" alt="File open dialog" width="385" height="376">

<p>
A <strong>message box</strong> looks like this: </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/question.png" alt="Question dialog" width="254" height="194">

<p>
<strong>GNOME terminal</strong> does not have modern features like tabs
or transparency. It was written by Miguel de Icaza, and used code from
the Zvt terminal widget by Michael Zucchi. Today's GNOME terminal
appears to date from 2002.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/terminal.png" alt="GNOME terminal" width="600" height="480">

<p>
In the GNOME <strong>audio</strong> menu, there is the Extace Waveform
display, an audio mixer, and a CD player. On my setup, Extace says it
cannot connect to esound, and I cannot get the mixer to work at all. The
CD player does better: </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/cd.png" alt="CD player" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The GNOME applications menu includes emacs and <strong>gEdit</strong>
0.4.0, written by Alex Roberts and Evan Lawrence. It is described as a
"small and lightweight text editor for GNOME/Gtk+". You can only open,
save and print files, cut and paste, and search and replace. The options
to change the text font and toggle auto-indenting do not seem to work.
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gedit.png" alt="gEdit" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>GNOME Calendar</strong> resembles the calendar app found in
Microsoft Outlook at that time: </p>

<p>
<img src="misc/laycock/cal1.png" alt="Calendar - day view" width="600" height="480">
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/laycock/cal2.png" alt="Calendar - week view" width="600" height="480">
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/laycock/cal3.png" alt="Calendar - edit appointment" width="600" height="480">
</p>

<p>
GNOME has <strong>GTimeTracker</strong> by Eckehard Berns. You select a
project and start and stop a timer. You can run a shell command every
time you select or deselect a project. You can create a log of all your
activities.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/timetrack.png" alt="GTimeTracker" width="600" height="480">

<p>
GnomeCard, an address book application, and the Gnumeric spreadsheet had
been added by the time of Red Hat Linux 6.0, which was released in April
1999.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>GNOME system monitor program</strong> is GTop 0.20 by Radek
Doulik. In the picture below, in the background, is a coloured chart of
memory usage. You can choose to see the total, shared, or resident sizes.
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/gtop.png" alt="GTop" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>system log monitor program</strong> is Logview 0.1, by Cesar
Miquel. You can choose a day on the calendar and see the relevant log
entries.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/logview.png" alt="Logview" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>GNOME Search Tool</strong> has options to specify a last
modified date range, file ownership, to use the "locate" command, to not
descend into mounted filesystems and to add extra "find" options. It
looks like you can search for specific content or apply a command.
Unfortunately, none of these options works.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/search.png" alt="Search Tool" width="600" height="480">

<p>
The <strong>GNOME Help Browser</strong> says it is "an interface to the
various forms of documentation present on your computer, and from other
computer via the Internet". It can load a GNOME help page for an
application, although "not much documentation in this format exists
currently". It will load HTML across the Web and present man and info
pages. It will do "whatis" queries, and load local files.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/ghelp2.png" alt="GNOME Help" width="600" height="450">

<p>
The <strong>games</strong> included are a solitaire card game,
minesweeper, mahjongg, and the "same game". Inspiration for the "same
game" came from the KDE game.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/freecell.png" alt="solitaire" width="600" height="498">

<img src="misc/laycock/mines.png" alt="minesweeper" width="216" height="234">

<img src="misc/laycock/mahjongg.png" alt="mahjongg" width="300" height="239">

<img src="misc/laycock/same.png" alt="same game" width="300" height="222">

<p>
GXSNMP is a basic SNMP <strong>network management</strong> application.
Unfortunately, I do not have a network!  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/snmp.png" alt="SNMP application" width="600" height="619">

<p>
On the GNOME system menu are various <strong>properties</strong> screens:
</p>

<img src="misc/laycock/background.png" alt="Background properties" width="504" height="474">
<img src="misc/laycock/screensaver.png" alt="Screensaver properties" width="504" height="474">
<img src="misc/laycock/bell.png" alt="Bell properties" width="504" height="308">
<img src="misc/laycock/keyboard.png" alt="Keyboard properties" width="504" height="349">
<img src="misc/laycock/mouse.png" alt="Mouse properties" width="504" height="239">
<img src="misc/laycock/lookfeel.png" alt="Look and feel properties" width="504" height="176">

<p>
There are two menu options to run a command. They lead to the
<strong>"grun"</strong> program, which shows a simple dialog with an input
box, which runs the typed command in my root xterm. It does not seem to
do anything else.  </p>

<p>
There is also yagIRC, "Yet Another GTK+ based IRC client" and GHex, a
binary file editor. The browser is Netscape Navigator.  </p>

<p>
The <strong>panel applets</strong> include Wanda the Fish, ready with a
fortune cookie. There are CD player and audio mixer applets. I do not
appear to have a mixer, so it is not shown.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/wandaapps.png" alt="Wanda and CD player panel applets" width="211" height="52">

<p>
There are four "monitor" applets available in the panel, showing battery
usage, CPU load, disk/memory usage, and disk usage: </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/monitorapps.png" alt="Monitor panel applets" width="372" height="52">

<p>
The "network" applets comprise: a PPP dialer, a mailcheck, modem lights,
network load monitor and a "Web control" to launch Netscape Navigator.
(The network load applet says it needs IP accounting turned on in the
kernel, to work.) </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/networkapps.png" alt="Network panel applets" width="440" height="52">

<p>
There are several "utility" applets for the panel, including a clock, a
clock and mailcheck together, a floppy drive mounter, and the
drag-and-drop printer applet. There is also a workspace pager (not
shown), which says it needs a window manager with the XA_ extensions. I
am using "twm", which is probably not sufficient.  </p>

<img src="misc/laycock/utilityapps.png" alt="Utility panel applets" width="283" height="52">

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
From switching on, I can get to the 1998 GNOME desktop in two to three
seconds, whereas with a recent kernel and KDE it takes thirty. I like
the simplicity. The programs do most of what I want.  </p>

<p> [1] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  That would
be Corel WordPerfect 8.0 Download Personal Edition, which was really
an extraordinary product: a stable, fast, polished, full-featured
word processor running in about 6 MB of RAM, compiled from the fabled
WordPerfect Corporation portable C version that they originated
on NeXTStep.  It's still a credible Linux option to this day (if
barely), which is amazing - although the problem of retrofitting needed
support libs is onto modern Linux distributions, by now, daunting and 
can only get worse.
</p>

<p>
It's poignant to consider how much better Corel might be doing if they'd
stuck with quality portable C code, rather than dallying first with a
buggy and resource-grabbing Java rewrite, and then with yet another
ground-up rewrite in C++ / Microsoft Foundation Classes, which in turn
forced them to abandon all OS platforms other than Win32.  
</p>

<p>Fans of the 1990s WordPerfect for Linux 8.x series can get
information including the fix for the Filtrix bug, language packs, and 
other useful resources via my 
<a href="http://en.tldp.org/FAQ/WordPerfect-Linux-FAQ/">WordPerfect for
Linux FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
The version of Tripwire you mention was "Tripwire Academic Source
Release (ASR)", a no-charge for non-commercial usage licence.  About a
year later (October 2000), Tripwire, Inc. converted the product over to
GPL (with a proprietary variant also available with additional features
and support).
</p>

<p> [2] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  In the grand
open source tradition of Slightly Dopey Initial Project Names They'd
Rather We No Longer Remember, Rasmus's language and related code were
originally called "Personal Home Page".  (See also "Kool Desktop
Environment".)
</p>

<a name="3"></a>
<p> [3] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  I hear that
the show-stopper with Electric Eyes was Imlib's limitations:  Rendering
and scaling were primitive and memory-management faulty, and it was
missing too many needed features.  Eye of GNOME was based on gdk-pixbuf, a 
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/feature/archive/gdkpixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.html">specific
replacement</a>.
