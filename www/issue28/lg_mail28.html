Subject: <B>Patch troubleshooting</B> 
<P> 
It is common nowadays for s/w to be delivered in form of patches, which
makes sense in terms of saving network bandwidth and time.
However, as a end user, when somehow a patch fails, I don't know what do
do, except email to the original author.
<P> 
I'd therefore like to see an article describing patches, i.e.,
<ul>
<li>what are they for ?
<li>How to apply one ?
<li>How to create one ?
<li>How to check integrity of s/w patch
<li>what to do if the patch gives you errors ?
</ul>

I'm running Red Hat 5.0 on my machine, and I've just bought a HP DeskJet 
722C printer, but I couldn't get it to work. I asked around on the IRC 
channels, and so far everyone has answered that Linux does not support 
it - is it a windows-only printer?
<P>
If so, is it possible to write a driver for it? or does anyone know of 
where I can get my hands on the driver (if it's already been written, of 
course). I would love to try and write one, but unfortunately I'm new to 
Linux and to programming.

I am wondering if someone out there knows of a package to change

installed KDE and I really like it and I was thinking of using the SysV
init editor that comes with it, but it would be nice to have something to
start with rather than starting from scratch.

At the department where I am sitting they are planning to buy a PC-bar,
and they intend to put NT on the machines. I would benefit from them
putting Linux on them, since I could then use them for simulations

<P>
I started talking to the ones buying it and my arguments stopped, when
they said that one reason for using NT was that they should be running
finite elements programs on them and that the frontier for those programs
was now on the windows platform. I don't know s... about that, so I am
looking for info; should I accept their arguments or is it that he just
does not know what can be gotten for Linux? Commercial Finite Element
Method (FEM) programs are also in the searchlight!

Our company runs two major apps using a Btrieve database. I was
wondering if anybody has ported either Btrieve server or client to
Linux. It is an extremely fast database (and highly underrated too)
which would be excellent if ported to Linux. I'm not too sure if the
developers of our Btrieve applications would move to Linux, but if I
could test a Linux-based solution with sample datasets, perhaps they'd
be more amenable to the idea of moving to a Linux platform (as an
alternative, at least).

because of the .94 indicates that they are almost ready for the next

<P> 
The problem I have is ppp 2.3.3  I downloaded is read the README
compiled the required parts and installed flawlessly...Now I CANNOT
conect to my ISP..  They are running a linux network with redhat 5 for
web hosting and slakeware controling the raid and passwords.  I'm
running slackware. (redhat would crash every couple days wipeing out my
harddisk...got tired of rebuilding my system...got real good at backups
: )  )
<P> 
the ppp-2.2 I was using I had to use the +ua &lt;file&gt; switch where file
contained the username and password for upap auth.  after upgrading this
swich was no longer available so I simply added it to my
/etc/ppp/pap-secretes file:
<PRE> 
username    *    password
</PRE> 
this didn't work. So, I tried the following:
<PRE> 
localhost    *    username:password
*                 *    username:password
</PRE> 
 My ISP hangs up on me.  I changed the order of the fields every which
way I could thing of but nothing worked.  I would like to get my linux
box back on the net because of better transfer times and a more stable
environment.  (linux connected at 33.6 and windoz connects and 24.# with
the same serial settings modem init etc.)

Please help...I hate to downgrade after houres of work upgrading.

You recently wrote to the Linux Gazette to express your aggravation
about the use of apostrophes and the world "alot" in many articles and
letters.  You are correct - both of these are misused often in email,
even more so in general email not destined for an online magazine.
I often find myself trying to reword a sentence to not use "alot", and
am aggravated with myself for having used it so often I can't think of
more proper wording!  You also mentioned that there were online
dictionaries available.  My only problem with your letter was you didn't
mention where these could be found.  If you have a few references, a
follow up letter to the Gazette would be grealy appreciated.  I know I
often have need for a dictionary and a theasaurus in my own writings.
Although I have one of each, they are pocket editions and somewhat
limited.  I realize I could look for references via Yahoo or other
online search engines, but I thought since you had mentioned their
existance you might already have the references.

<P>
I hope you have the space to publish all of this letter.  I would certainly
appreciate it if you did.
Back in the Feb 98 issue of LG, my request for help with installing X on the
old IBM monitor I have was published, and I received a number of replies,
from all over the world as you'll see.  I wish to thank:

        Robert Reid &lt;reid@astro.utoronto.ca&gt;; and,
        Miss Valarie Frizzle
</PRE> 
Many advised using 'xvidtune' to get the proper settings, and a couple
advised me to get RH5.0.  I only got around to trying out anything about two
weeks ago.
<P> 
Now this may come in handy for anyone else with a monitor like mine.  It was
so simple it was foolish.  First, I couldn't find 'xvidtune' after
reinstalling RH4.2, so I figured I'd play around with the X configuration.
If I blew the monitor, well.....
<P> 
In the RH installation, when I got to the selection of monitors, I bit the
bullet and selected 'custom'.  A new menu came up, and guess what?  In it
was a listing for an 'IBM 8514 or compatible'.  (As the younger people say
today, I said "Duh?")  I kind of figured my monitor was as compatible as it
could get!
<P> 
After I clicked on that and popped in what freqs I knew, X worked perfectly.
Which is a nice end to the tale, but doesn't address the problem.
The problem was that I was afraid to (as Ms. Frizzle says) 'Take chances;
get messy.'  I was too happy webbing along in the Win95 world.  To newbies
like me out there, all I can say is:  do just that.  I advise having a
notebook and pen handy at all times, though, to write down anything you
change and where you changed it.
<P> 
Does RTFM sound familiar?  Do that, too.  A lot.  Linux can be confusing,
especially when you're trying to do something supposedly simple like
installing PPP (I'm *still* working on that) and at different web sites you
find three or four different ways to do that, and none seem to work in your
case.
<P> 
That's when you take chances and get messy.  And you may well (as I've had
to do), hit the big RESET button when it's a total SNAFU, and maybe have to
reinstall.  Breaks of the game.  And that's where the notebook you've been
writing all your changes comes in very handy.  If you try to keep it all in
your head, the kumpewter will win every time.
<P> 
In addition, there is a lot of help from off-line sources, like library book
sales.  Last year, for example, I picked up an 'outdated' SAMS book
entitled, "X Window System Programming".  That was before I even thought
about putting together another 'puter - over eight years from touching a
keyboard.  I may never use it; but it only cost $.50.
Local gurus; if you're lucky enough to have them, be subtle in your approach
to them.  Like, 'Uh, gee, you can really get your (whatever it is) really
whipping up a storm.  Mine kinda...', and let it drag out.  Ten years ago
when I was a supposed 'guru', that *always* got me going.  And I learned
from a guy who had a really modern system  back in the '80s, so I got one
just like it.
<P> 
When you say, "TRASH-80", you better smile, pardner!  Mod-1, no less.  4K RAM.
Damn thing could do just about anything.
<P> 
Your ISP may or may not be a help, but try it.  Where I am, when I walked in
to sign up and the word Linux passed my lips, I thought they'd hang balls of
garlic around their necks.
<P> 
But if you want to do it, you will.  I still don't have PPP on Linux, for
example, so under Win95, if I find something tempting on the web, I still
download it.  It can always be put on a disk, if necessary - say you don't
have a dos mount - and then tarred to your Linux partitiion.
<P> 
But write it down; write it all down.
<P> 
That's all I have to say, except I again all those who sent me help.
That's what Linux is all about anyway, isn't it.
<P>
PS:  I hope I was correct in the above to please the English purists.  If
not:  mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maximum culpa.

Subject: <B>Bazaar ISP...</B> 
<P>
Hello, I was wondering if anyone has ever considered the idea of a bazaar
model for running an ISP.  By a Bazaar model, I of caurse refer to the
infamous Cathedral vs. Bazaar model for software development.  So what do
I really mean.  I mean an ISP by the people for the people.  I have found
that most ISP's are very restrictive in how things are run, i.e., many of
the interesting utilities are strictly off limits.  For example, I was
recently trying to setup cvs to work as a server.  The normal way to do
this is by adding a line to inetd.conf.  However, being only a "user" on
my ISP, I had no way to accomplish this.  So I though of a more complex
way to set this up, but that method require the use of crontab.  Again
this service is not available to Joe User.
<P>
I am very aware of the obvious security issues, but surely there must be a
way to improve the situation in someway.  I cannot but think about rms
(Richard Stallman) and some of his lestures on the evils of a sysadmin and
thinking, "how true".  But how can one deal with the open system issue,
while still maintain a certain level of system security.  I would be very
pleased to see this erupt into a deep and lengthy thread somewhere.  Just
my 2 cents.

Subject: <B>Linux is not ready for the desktop</B> 
<P>
David Wagle ("Evangelism: A Unix Bigot and Linux Advocate's Spewings",
Linux Gazette #27) points out some good reasons why converting people
to Linux can be harder than we expect.
<P>
But he seems to shy away from the natural conclusion.  It is not
currently possible to put together a setup which makes it possible for
people to do normal day-to-day work and simple admin without serious
trouble---whether or not they care about abandoning their existing
Windows software.  Ergo, Linux is simply not, in all conscience, a
suitable platform for unsupported users who just want to get their
jobs done.
<P>
It very nearly is.  I run the maximally friendly Linux installation
with Red Hat, linuxconf, KDE, Netscape and Word Perfect; my experience
is that intelligent non-Unix users can manage fine 90% of the time.
The remaining problems are very obvious, but here there are anyway
spelt out in order of seriousness:
  <UL>
  <LI> Few of the heavyweight GUI apps and tools mentioned above work
       reliably: they suffer at least as many bugs and crashes as
       their Windows equivalents (KDE, of course, is still in beta).
       While on the other hand ...
  <LI> ... The classic Unix applications (emacs, tex <I>etc.</I>) are
       rock steady; but they are not wonderful enough, outside certain
       narrow (generally academic) domains, to offset the difficulty
       and crankiness which everyone freely admits they exhibit.
  <LI> The GUI tools cannot handle all day-to-day tasks; and
       to achieve the best coverage, you have to use
       tools from several different stables, which is
       confusing---especially when they interact poorly with each
       other.
  <LI> Some classes of desktop application simply do not exist for
       Linux at any price, or are far inferior to their Windows
       counterparts.  Try getting something to typeset music.
  <LI> Nothing even attempts to achieve the kind of effortless
       networking which Windows users take for granted.  (Don't
       flame me---go and try Windows.)
  <LI> The underlying OS does have a few bugs, minor perhaps, but
       nevertheless showstoppers for unsupported users.  "Just stop
       lpd, remove the lp kernel module, modprobe it again and restart
       lpd" is not what they want to hear.

Yes, progress over the last year or two has been breathtaking.  The
developer community has shown itself capable of coming up with really
lovely utilities and tools for non-initiates, and it no longer seems
implausible that Linux will soon develop into something that rivals NT
for ease of use.  But in the mean time, proposing Linux to anyone not
already conversant with Unix is tantamount to suggesting a new hobby:
one with tangible rewards, to be sure, but let's admit that's what it
is.  Linux is <B>not</B> ready for the desktop.
