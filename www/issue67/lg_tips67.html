<P>
When you visit some sites with Konqueror, the icon in the upper left
corner and the icon in the location window will sometimes become the
logo for the site.  You can add your own with the <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> icon editor.
</P>
<P>
Just create a 16x16 PNG file and save it in
$HOME/.kde/share/icons/favicons
</P>
<P>
as &lt;domain name&gt;.png.  For example, I created a "G" logo for visiting i
the www.packers.com site.  I saved my icon as "www.packers.com.png."

Hi,
</P>
<P>
regarding your recent answer to [subj]:
</P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
[Mike] Your hub is connected directly to the DSL modem? In that case, you
will have to contact your ISP to get a second dynamic address from them...
if you can.
A more common scenario is to have one computer (the server) connected to the
modem and also to the hub. The second computer is connected only to the hub.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P>
Not widely known is this alternative (assuming that pppoe is used):
</P>
<P><ul>
<li>Connect the DSL modem to a hub
<li>connect another computer to the same hub
<li>configure this computer as a firewall/router/NAT and use the <EM>same</EM>
network card for IP and PPPOE connections
<li>just point all other computers to this box as router
</ul></P>
<P>
This solution has two advantages:<ol>
<li>It still allows every box on the net to directly connect via DSL if
necessary (for example if the router goes dead)
<li>It saves one network card 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</ol></P>
<P>
There are of course also drawbacks:<ol>
<li>If the ISP is not very very careful it could happen that somebody uses
this connection to monitor internal network traffic.
<li>It could be confusing if both alternatives (via router <TT>/</TT> direct
connection) are possible. One never knows which one should be used.
</ol></P>
<P>
Let me also point you to <A HREF="http://www.fli4l.de"
	>http://www.fli4l.de</A>, a linux router project called
"Floppy ISDN for Linux" which also supports DSL. It is a great solution for
most router needs and very easy to configure. You don't even need a Linux
box to install/configure it since it comes with tools for Windows <TT>/</TT> DOS as
well. All you do is use the Windows based configuration program or a text
editor to adjust a configuration file, run a script <TT>/</TT> batch file to create a
boot floppy and boot from it.
I have discovered it a month ago and switched my old <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> based router to
this one immediately.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately the documentation is so far mostly German, but they are
working on an English translation.

Hi,

<P><STRONG>
I am having Ps/2 mouse . my startx is fine but i dont see any mouse
movements . i tried attaching different mouse but the result is the
same. can u help me how to make out whether its a problem of mouseport .
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Regards
<br>Anil
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
Firstly you need to know on what port X is looking for a mouse and then make
sure that this device actually exists and is supported by the kernel.
</P>
<P>
In <TT>/etc/XF86Config</TT> you should find a section called "Pointer" mine reads as
follows.
</P>
<Pre>
Section "Pointer"

Protocol "PS/2"
Device   "/dev/mouse"
</Pre>
<P>
<TT>/dev/mouse</TT> is a symbolic link to <TT>/dev/psaux.</TT>
</P>
<P>
Hope this will help.

<!-- ::
Anyone burning a CD should know...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:: -->
<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
I'd like to respond to a question in the April MailBag about burning .iso cd images from Windows.
</P>
<P>
When downloading an .iso image off the internet there are several steps
involved.  One should of course download the image and burn it to a CD.
However there is a step in the middle that is even more important...getting
an MD5 checksum against the resulting file.
</P>
<P>
Most sites that allow you to download an .iso file also have a matching
MD5SUM file that goes with the .iso file.  Go ahead and download that too.
It is a very small file and is basically your insurance against making
coasters (an invalid CDRom disc ).
</P>
<P>
The file really contains an MD5 digest of the .iso file.  It is in ascii text and is viewable with notepad in Windows.   What is an MD5 digest you ask...it is a 128-bit digital fingerprint of the file.  If you want to know more you can read the spec for the algorithm at:  <A HREF="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/rfc1321.txt"
	>http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/rfc1321.txt</A>
</P>
<P>
Because you require a way to get the MD5 digest of a file from a windows perspective, you'll need a WIN32 app that can run the digest.  This utility can be picked up at:  <A HREF="http://www.etree.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi/software/md5sum.exe"
	>http://www.etree.org/cgi-bin/counter.cgi/software/md5sum.exe</A>
</P>
<P>
Save it to C:\WINDOWS.  Just invoke it in a dos window with the following command line (replacing the .iso filename with the name of the .iso that you downloaded).
</P>
<P><CODE>
md5sum -b myimage.iso
</CODE></P>
<P>
It's gonna run for a while....ok probably 10 minutes or so...be patient.  The utility will then spit out something like:  379d89e83825d11d985b1081ab0de6de *myimage.iso
</P>
<P>
Now look at the the the number stored in the MD5SUM file that you downloaded for the .iso file.  If they match, you have my approval to go for the burn...if not...try again.
</P>
<P>
There are also some low cost methods of getting the CD for just about any linux distribution like <A HREF="http://www.cheapbytes.com"
	>http://www.cheapbytes.com</A> or <A HREF="http://www.linuxmall.com"
	>http://www.linuxmall.com</A> these both will do all the dirty work, including checking for valid .iso  and burning it properly, for around a 5-spot.
</P>

<P><STRONG>
I'm a candidate for the doctor's degree on electronic. I'm working
on a DSP and data adquisition card for ISA bus (as begin). I wrote a
device driver
for Linux (a file .o), and then make a special file in <TT>/dev</TT> directory
with
mknod; However, I don't know if I have to re-compile the kernel for
associate my special file with my device drive ( any.o ). My questions
are:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Which are the steps for make a device drive and install it? And then,
Which
are the steps for redistribute it? Where can I get more information? .
Thanks a lot by anyway.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hiya!
</P>
<P>
I've written a couple of Linux device drivers,  and I found most of the
information I needed in one of these two locations:
</P>
<P><dl><dt>
"Linux Device Drivers" 
	<dd>by Alessandro Rubini 
	<br>published by O'Reilly,
	<br>ISBN 1-56592-292-1

<P><DL><DT>
"The Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide, version 1.1.0" 
<dd>by Ori
Pomerantz 
	<br>published by the Linux Documentation Project at
<br><A HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/linux-doc-project/module-programming-guide/lkmpg-1.1.0.pdf.tar.gz"
	>http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/linux-doc-project/module-programming-guide/lkmpg-1.1.0.pdf.tar.gz</A>
</DL></P>
<P>
The first is a paperback book giving all the gory details of how device
drivers work under Linux,  including how to write them as modules so that
the kernel can dynamically load and unload them as needed (this saves
recompiling the kernel all the time).  The book is based around kernel
version 2.0,  but includes lots of pointers for 2.2.  I guess a new version
for the 2.4 kernels will come along soon.
</P>
<P>
The second,  web reference is a more general guide to writing modules,  and
may be slightly less useful to you.
</P>
<P>
The third place I looked for help was in the kernel source tree:  lots of
skilled programmers have written lots of device drivers and made the source
available to you.  Pick one or two modules that drive similar hardware to
your device and read the code thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
Hope it helps!
</P>
<P>
Mike.

<P>
This should spark some interest in some quarters (Hi Dan):
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
From PLWM's info page:
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
plwm is not a normal window manager, in fact, it isn't a window
manager at all.  Instead it is a collection of Python classes which you
can use to build your own window manager.  You can include the features
you like and easily write your own extensions to make your plwm
behave exactly as you want it to.  Eventually, you will have a perfect
symbiosis of user and window manager, you and the computer will be a
beautiful Mensch-Maschine!
</P>
<P>
One basic idea is that the mouse should be banished, and everything
should be possible to do without moving your hands from the keyboard.
This is the pointless bit of plwm.
</P>
<P>
The other basic idea is to make a window manager which is is pure Unix
Philosophy: a lot of simple tools you combine to make a powerful
application.  The "tools" are Python classes which makes it easy to
inherit, extend, mixin and override to get exactly the functionality you
want.
</P>
<P>
This makes plwm extremely configurable by sacrificing ease of
configuration: you actually have to write some Python code to get the
window manager exactly as you want it.  However, if you was moved by the
first paragraph, then you're probably already a hacker and will relish
writing your own window manager.
</P>
<P>
A typical plwm might look rudimentary, even hostile, to people used
to the glitz and glamour of more conventional window managers.  However,
there are a lot of powerfull features, making it really user-friendly.
Provided that the user is friendly to plwm, of course.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Could I suggest you point this person at "The POSIX programmer's guide"
(ORA, ISBN 0-937175-73-0, Donald Levine)? In particular chapter 8 describes
the tc* functions, including stuff like break handling, parity generation,
cooked mode, turn echo on or off, etc, etc. You can do a few more things
with termios but not many and termios is a bit less portable. I think
termios is quite well documented in the GNU C library manual.
</P>
<P>
I suspect the same reference will answer a lot of the other questions that
this breed of program raises. Incidently just coyping the header file is
unliekly to work, it just delies the problems until link time. Depending on
the progrm curses/ncurses might or might not be the right thing, and it is
not possibe to judge this sans the program in question.

Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hello,
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I have recently installed RHL6.2 on my machine. The default
window manager for this is Gnome. Being more familiar with
fvwm2 and olvwm, I would like to know if there is any way
of making these window managers available at the login time.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If it is not possible to have these WM listed under "sessions",
is there any way by which as soon as I log in, fvwm2/olvwm will
start instead of Gnome?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
If you go into <TT>/etc/X11/gdm</TT>, you'll see a Sessions/ directory. Inside of
there, you'll see scripts that launch different WMs.  Add scripts for
the WMs you want to launch and they'll show up automagically when you
reboot.

Hello,

Thanks for the tip. That solved my 90% of the problem. But
I figured out that there is something additional that needs
to be done to get the window managers running. I had to
edit <TT>/usr/X11R6/bin/RunWM</TT> and add entries for the new window
managers. I don't know if this change is required only for
my machine or is a generic one.

</P>
<P>
Hello,
</P>
<P>
After reading the Answer Gang article in the above URL of your Linux
Gazette, I realised that I had this similar problem.   My problem may or may
not be related.
</P>
<P>
I see that Gabriel Florit was using RH7 with some updates installed from
up2date.   I ran this recently on RH7 and had some problems mounting vfat
partitions afterwards.   I believe, based on the list of packages that were
installed, that this was due to a new version of mount being installed.
There were new kernel sources with these round of updates.   Until I
recompiled the kernel using this new source, mount would give the same error
message as Gabriel is experiencing, every time.   Then, after compiling the
new kernel with the new source, the problem was gone.
</P>
<P>
Apolgies not being about to tell you exactly which kernel was replaced by
which, I am on a work machine at the moment and have upgraded to the 2.4
kernel under RH7.1 now anyways, but I may be able to find out if I didn't
delete the old sources.
</P>
<P>
Hope this helps,
</P>
<P>
D.

I would like to be able to allow other users to do a shutdown, or to
create a special user who can be used to poweroff the system. I am not
concerned about anyone turning the system off when I don't want it to
happen, as there is not anything critical on the system (okay there
is, but it is not a time critical type thing).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I can't just give my root password out so that someone can shut the system
down......
</STRONG></P>
<P>
To do a shutdown on ctrl-alt-delete, you can put this in <TT>/etc/inittab:</TT>
</P>

<blockquote><pre># What to do when CTRL-ALT-DEL is pressed.
ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -h now
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(Most distributions make it a shutdown -r but you can make it a shutdown
-h.)
</P>
<P>
Or, install sudo, make a group "shutdown" and put something like this
in <TT>/etc/sudoers:</TT>
</P>

<blockquote><pre>%shutdown ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Then other users will be able to shutdown with
</P>

<blockquote><pre>sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
The advantage of the second approach is that sudo will log who did it.

Hi All:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
How to create entries under <TT>/dev</TT> direcory on linux ( <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.1 )? RedHat linux
has a script <TT>/dev/MAKEDEV</TT> which can be used for this.
I looked at <TT>/etc/init.d/*</TT> scripts on SuSE linux7.1 installation CD but
couldn't find how it creates entries under <TT>/dev</TT> directory. I want to create
entries for all the devices manually. If SuSE7.1 already have some script like
MAKEDEV will be quite helpful.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks
<br>Sachin
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You create device files with the mknod command. The major and minor numbers for
devices can be found in the kernel source documenation directory in devices.txt

I got several network cameras in our office (axis 2100 with own

generate to our webserver which got a MUCH bigger bandwidth

I want that every camera only pushes the stream once though our

the stream.

Have a look at Samba: Thats a server running running on *NIX and allows to
connect Windows clients to it for file and printersharing.

You could start at:

<P>
or simply type samba in any search engine (like www.google.com).
The  Samba home page is: <A HREF="http://samba.org"
	>http://samba.org</A>
</P>
<P>
You will wan't to run the snmb server for the actual exporting and nmbd who
is handling the Windows query protocoll -- so the Linux box will answer if
you doubleclick "network" in Windows and scan the environment.

There are some GUI tools for it, but they still somewhat expect that
you know what you want.  Unless somebody has changed your setup, most
distros' copy of samba contains a sample smb.conf (try looking in <TT>/etc</TT>
or using locate to find it) with comments for all the options.
</P>
<P>
Other than that, the best step-by-step I know, though it's not "down to
the bits" would be samba's own DIAGNOSIS.TXT file.  I've configured a
lot of samba boxes.  So far I haven't seen a single problem that wasn't
solved by going through this from beginning to end.  It has 11 tests
and it's over 300 lines long, in the version I've got.
</P>
<P>
The Samba site has many mirrors, but you can at least find their docs
online at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.samba.org/pub/samba/docs"
	>ftp://ftp.samba.org/pub/samba/docs</A> -- there is a lot of good
reading in there.
</P>
<P>
We also had an article in issue 48 (<A HREF="../issue48/blanchard.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue48/blanchard.html</A>) about setting up Samba, which you might find useful.

Well, two things come to mind: every script I've ever seen (except for
yours 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> looks for "ogin:" and not "Login:".  You may want to do that as
well, since every box you telnet to may not use a capital L for the word
login (my other linux boxes don't).

csk

But, based on this output, what I said above won't help.  So here, I
would suggest putting another "expect" in before the "ogin:".  Say,
something like
</P>
<P>
expect "scape character"
sleep 5
expect "word:"
</P>
<P>
or something along those lines.

Back to the problem, though....I don't know what the
underlying problem was but I seem to have fixed it by
forking out $50 for partition magic which sorted it
out. It would have been nice to have found someone who
could've sorted it without the cost but there you go,
I was in a hurry and couldn't find what I needed in
all the reference and help info out there. I did look
though, believe me(Sometimes there's just too much).
Anyway, thanks for your reply; I'll try to phrase my
question better next time.

We're a bit late for him, but if resizing a vfat or ext2
partition is something you need to do, try parted.  It
isn't as pretty (looks a bit like fdisk, really) but, it's
in the major distros now and a cheap download from freshmeat
or the debian archives if you don't have it.  In this case,
something unknown was funny about the partitions, and the
corrective ability in resizers was able to fix it.
