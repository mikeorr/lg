<h2>News in General</h2>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Open Source Development Labs and Free Standards Group
Merge; form the Linux Foundation</h3>

<p>The big news in January was the merger of Open Source Development
Labs and Free Standards Group. The new
organization hopes to accelerate Linux growth by providing
a comprehensive set of services to compete effectively with proprietary
platforms. Founding platinum members of Linux Foundation include
Fujitsu, Hitachi, HP, IBM, Intel, NEC, Novell, and Oracle. Jim Zemlin,
Free Standards Group's former executive director, leads the Linux
Foundation. Other members include every major
company in the Linux industry, including Red Hat, as well as numerous
community groups, universities, and industry end-users.</p>

<p>Of course, Linus Torvalds need not fear, since the new
foundation announced that it will continue to sponsor his work. The
Foundation's major goals include protecting Linux by sponsoring key
Linux developers, and providing legal services. The press release states:
"It is vitally important that Linux creator Linus Torvalds and other key
kernel developers remain independent. Linux Foundation sponsors them
so they can work full time on improving Linux. Linux Foundation also
manages the Linux trademark (<a href="http://www.linuxmark.org">http://www.linuxmark.org</a>) and offers developers
legal intellectual property protection through such initiatives as the
Open Source as Prior Art project (<a href="http://www.osapa.org">http://www.osapa.org</a>), the Patent Commons
<a href="http://www.patent-commons.org">http://www.patent-commons.org</a>), and sponsorship of the Linux Legal Defense
Fund."</p>

<p>Other major goals are standardizing Linux and improving it as a
platform for software development, and providing a neutral forum for
collaboration and promotion.</p>

<p>The merger is pending ratification by the two organizations'
respective memberships, and is expected to be completed in early
February. For more information, please visit <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Fedora Summit Offers
Road Map for Community-Wide Changes</h3>

<p>The Fedora Group recently held a three-day summit to establish short-
and long-term plans for future Fedora Projects. The summit drew 10 top
Red Hat and Fedora team members to the table, including Jesse Keating,
Fedora's release engineer; Fedora developer Jeremy Katz; engineer and
original Fedora Project founder Warren Togami; Greg DeKoenigsberg,
community development manager for Red Hat; and Fedora Project Leader Max
Spevack. The meeting was also transcribed live to an IRC channel, where
more that 100 members of the community contributed.</p>

<p>The summit resulted in a road map that will lead to changes for the
community as a whole. The most important change is the merging of Fedora
Core and Fedora Extras. It is hoped that this will lead to lowering a
barrier for community involvement, and increase the contributions made
by Red Hat and members of the Open Source community as a whole.</p>

<p><a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Jeremy Allison Resigns From Novell</h3>

<p>The legendary Jeremy Allison (of Samba fame) has resigned from Novell
in protest over the Microsoft-Novell patent agreement. He felt that the
deal was "a mistake" that will be "damaging to Novell's success in the
future." His main issue with the deal, though, was "that even if it does
not violate the letter of the licence, it violates the intent of the GPL
licence the Samba code is released under, which is to treat all
recipients of the code equally." He was quickly snapped up by Google,
and has begun working there in the new year.</p>

Novell.</p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Microsoft Hands out
16,000 SUSE Linux Subscriptions</h3>

<p>Undeterred by harsh criticism over their controversial
interoperability and patent protection agreement, Microsoft has managed
to hand out over 16,000 subscription certificates for SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server. Several large enterprise customers such as Deutsche
Bank AG, Credit Suisse, and AIG Technologies have been amongst the first
to take advantage of the new-found interoperability between Windows
Server and SUSE Linux.</p>

<p>As part of the deal between the two companies, Microsoft said it would
distribute 70,000 coupons a year for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, so
that customers could benefit from the use of an interoperable version of
Linux with patent coverage, as well as the collaborative work between
the two companies.</p>

<p>According to <a
href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/microsoft_starts_handing_out_suse_linux_subscriptions.html?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">eWeek</a>,
some of these seats might have come at Red Hat's expense. The Forrester
Research group had earlier suggested that this might be the case, and, if
these reports are true, Red Hat might be getting worried.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Will Sun's Solaris
Trump Red Hat Support?</h3>

<p>Sun Microsystems is following Oracle in attacking Red Hat, claiming
that the leading open source Linux company is under-serving customers,
and that Solaris can do the job better. "The big take-away is that it is
not just the [Solaris] technology," said Rich Green, executive
vice-president of software at Sun. "There is a vacuum that is not being
served by Red Hat or served by Microsoft. We are well positioned and
fully intend to fill the gap."</p>

<p>Sun offers free access to Solaris 10 as well as support that the company
claims is 20 to 50 percent cheaper than Red Hat support, and is priced
competitively with Oracle Red Hat support. Sun has always said that
Solaris is superior (more robust, secure, and supportable) to Red Hat
Linux or other distributions for enterprises as well as smaller
businesses and startups, and there is some evidence of this.</p>

<p>Sun's attack on Red Hat might sound good on paper, but the actual
success of this campaign will only be seen in a few months. Yahoo
Finance has a 
<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/seekingalpha/070117/24374_id.html?.v=1">write up</a>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />EU Commission Study Finds OSS Saves Money</h3>

<p>The EU Commission's Final Report on its "Study on the Economic Impact
of Open Source Software on Innovation and the Competitiveness of the
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector in the EU" has
just been released. The study was done by an international consortium,
led by the United Nations University/University of Maastricht's
department of innovation. The 287 page report is <a
href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/ict/policy/doc/2006-11-20-flossimpact.pdf">freely
available.</a></p>

<p>This study categorically debunked the idea that total cost of
ownership will rise if a company or a government switches to open source
software. Section 12.7 of the study states: "Our findings show
that, in almost all the cases, a transition toward open source reports
of savings on the long term -- costs of ownership of the software
products." Of course, training costs and other costs are a factor, but
the study has taken these into account before coming to this
conclusion.</p>

<p>This study should give an added impetus to the attempts of various EU
members to switch to open source software.</p>



<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Audi engineering luxury cars on Linux</h3>

<p>
Over the past several years, Audi AG, a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group,
has been migrating its engineering systems to Linux. The company has
been upgrading to 64-bit Linux for its Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)
servers, whose simulation software allows designers to craft automobile
components, engineers to run crash-test simulations, and other 3D
visualizations. The move to X86_64 and Itanium 2 has allowed for better
runtimes for CAE's power-hungry processes, using the architectures'
larger caches.  </p>

<p>
Audi's migration is not limited to its servers, using Linux for its
workstations, WebCenter intranet and Web applications, and public and
private servers, using the array of publicly available packages. By
cutting the number of operating systems employed, Audi cut IT costs.
However, because machines became cheaper to employ, the number of
machines grew, causing operating costs to remain relatively the same.
</p>

<p>
These considerations and others are outlined in the <a
href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/12/21/1640241">original
article</a>, along with quotations from Florian Kienast, Audi's spokesman.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Fab@Home: Another Mainframe to PC Story?</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.fabathome.org">Fab@Home</a> is an open source
project that provides a low-cost solution to desktop manufacturing. This
self-assembled device fabricates 3D objects by layering liquid or
powdered material, a process that was previously not feasible for
individuals due to its high cost. Unlike many commercial machines of its
kind, Fab@Home's fabricators can use different building materials:
everything from silicone to chocolate. The fabricator is plugged into
the user's computer, using software to control its mechanical functions.
</p>

<p> Users of Fab@Home have contributed basic and advanced 3D designs to
the community, allowing new users to climb a potentially steep learning
curve more quickly; a catalog of these designs is hosted on <a
href="http://www.fabathome.org/wiki/index.php?title=Fab%40Home:Design_Library">Fab@Home's
web site</a>. Users of the fabricator are also encouraged to modify the
design, hopefully contributing their ideas to the community.  </p>

<p>
Even the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fabathome/">software
client</a>, which interfaces between the user and the fabricator, is
open source; the source code was posted on 1/17/07.  </p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Gentoo/FreeBSD on Hold Due to Licensing Issues</h3>

<p>Flameeyes (a Gentoo/FreeBSD developer) recently discovered serious
licensing issues in the various *BSD projects who use BSD-4 licensed
code. In a post on his <a
href="http://farragut.flameeyes.is-a-geek.org/articles/2007/01/07/gentoo-freebsd-license-problems-requires-a-development-pause">blog</a>,
he states how he discovered the license problems with libkvm and
start-stop-daemon. "libkvm is a userspace interface to FreeBSD kernel,
and it's licensed under the original BSD license, BSD-4 if you want, the
one with the nasty advertising clause." The good news is that the
University of California/Berkeley has given people permission to drop the
advertising clause. The bad news is that libkvm has code from many other
sources, and each of them needs to give their permission for the license
to be changed.</p>

<p>Linux.com has an 
<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/01/08/224251">article</a>

informative, funny, and off-topic 
<a href="http://bsd.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/08/1219254">comments</a> 
on the subject.
The problem seems to have been temporarily resolved, but could crop up
again in different code.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Sun To License
OpenSolaris Under GPLv3?</h3>

<p>Sun Microsystems is set to license OpenSolaris under the upcoming GNU
General Public License Version 3 in addition to the existing Common
Development and Distribution License, according to a 
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2084284,00.asp">story in
eWeek</a>. OpenSolaris currently is licensed only under Sun's CDDL. The
article quotes sources as saying that this is very likely to happen
after the release of that version of the GPL, which currently is being
rewritten and is expected to be made final soon.</p>

<p>The <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Fedora 6 Zod Live CD Released</h3>

<p>After lots of feedback, bug fixing, and testing, the Fedora Project is
pleased to announce the first official Fedora live CD. This live CD is
based on packages from the Fedora Core 6 and Fedora Extras package
collections, and comprises 100% free software. The live CD features
ver 2.6.18 of the kernel, GNOME 2.16, AIGLX and Compiz, and the usual
plethora of desktop applications. Some notable features are the
inclusion of VPN connectivity through vnpc and OpenVPN, a R/W 
filesystem that allows you to install software on the running live CD, and
the ability to run completely from RAM, if you have 1GB or more.</p>

<p>The CD can be downloaded <a
href="http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/projects/live/FC-6-i386-livecd-1.iso">
here</a>. Currently, the CD is only available for i386 architectures,
but support for PPC and x86_64 is planned.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Linspire opens up CNR</h3>

<p>Linspire announced plans to expand its popular Click 'N Run digital
download and software management service to support several of the most
popular desktop Linux distributions in 2007. Previously available only
for Linspire and Freespire desktop Linux users, the CNR service will
begin providing users of other desktop Linux distributions a free and
easy way to access over 20,000 desktop Linux products, packages, and
libraries.</p>

<p>Initially, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, and Ubuntu will be supported,
using both .deb and .rpm packages. More distributions will be added,
later this year. Linspire CEO Kevin Carmony goes into more detail about
this in an <a

released, with this statement from the developers: "This release is the
culmination of 3 years of work, starting with Hideya-san who originally
conceived of a bold, new type of window system, through the initial
shake down of the proof-of-concept demo by an internal Sun community,
followed by the open sourcing of the technology, which generated such
enormous interest that it brought down the java.net servers several
times. From that point on, many people from around the globe have
contributed to the project; contributing to the core, contributing
applications, performing testing, writing and translating documentation,
etc. The project owners (Hideya, Paul, Krishna and I) are very
grateful for all of the great contributions we have received from you,
the LG community."</p>

often lack the expertise needed to effectively configure these
capabilities.  Tresys Brickwall builds upon leading open-source
technologies to control SELinux security functions without requiring
special knowledge of the SELinux policy language. </p>

<p>Tresys Brickwall Security Suite includes three editions: Standard,
Professional,and Enterprise, to meet varying levels of end-user needs.
With the Enterprise edition, the first-ever network management console
for SELinux, administrators can apply enhanced security across an entire
enterprise, allowing administrators to configure SELinux for groups of
systems and apply and monitor this security remotely. Key features of
the suite include the ability to define network access settings for
individual programs, built-in protection for many applications and
services, customization of resource and file protection settings, and
ability to create custom policy targets for new applications. The
Standard Edition is a free version, while the Professional and
Enterprise Editions provide scalable security for any size
organization.</p>

Aditya was bored one day in 1997 and decided to take a look at this
 "linux thing". After installing Red Hat 5, and looking at the blinking
 cursor, he promptly removed it and went back to Windows. And then
 reinstalled a few days later, determined to figure it out. So far, he's
 figured some stuff out, but he's still trying, and he's still having
 fun.

<p>
Samuel Kotel Bisbee-vonKaufmann was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA
area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age
of 10, Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science
and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a
href="http://www.oftc.org">http://www.oftc.org</a>), had his first article
published, and became more involved in various communities and projects.
</p>

<p>
Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?
</p>

<p>
Sam prefers programming in C++ and Bash, is fluent in Java and PHP, and while
he can work in Perl, he hates it. If you would like to know more then feel free
to ask.
