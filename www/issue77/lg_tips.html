<P>
I would still suggest ram, even if it didn't cause problems before.
Everything has to have a first time failure. I had a ram board that
would work merrily along for days before suddenly locking up. I presume
it would have shown itself sooner had I changed to something needing
more ram to work well.
</P>
<P>
Secondly I'd look at heat. Is this machine in a warm place? A hot CPU is
a grumpy CPU. Video players can put a strain on them.
</P>
<P>
Third, power supply. RH7.2 requires more resources than 6.2 required.
More resource needs will put a strain on the power supply.  Not
necessarily a likely problem, but the symptoms certainly suggest it as a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
Video cards can do this, as can sound as you suggested.
</P>
<P>
Finally, I've had problems with this myself, all caused in the past by
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>, gnome and screensavers. I have a friend that turned of f the
screensavers in gnome and ran xscreensaver and his crashes stopped. He
did the same in KDE and, again, crashes disappeared. This would also
suggest a relationship between video boards, libraries, compile-time
options, etc. Since most people use "outta the box" RPMs, the compile
options aren't necessarily optimized to work with their other hardware.

<br>asked by Mike "Iron" Orr, <em>LG</em> Editor

<P><STRONG>
There's a program in <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> unstable called xt (xtraceroute). It's
supposed to plot the traceroute path on a picture of the earth.
However, it doesn't seem to have enough location coordinates in its
database to do anything. Has anybody used this program? Did you
have to enter your own coordinates for all the hosts you traceroute
from and to?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I am not subscribed to the list, or however it works, so please forgive
me if this is going to the wrong adress, I did my best to accertain that
this was the one. In anycase, I believe I can give an answer.
</P>
<P>
Many routers, and other end nodes, can be configured to know what thier
geographical location is in longitude and latitude coordinates. This
allows diagnostic information, and the curious, to find where on earth a
particular device is located. However, network administrators may be too
lazy to look up and configure such information, and/or not really care
to. There really isn't any good reason to do this, except for satisfying
the curious people.

does linux support the playback of .dat files and what are the
recommended (easiest/most powerfull/stable) player
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hi!
</P>
<P>
Well, probably you mean vcd (video-cd) data files (there is the actual
movie data in there). If anything is related in some way to movie,
<EM>always</EM> take mplayer (mplayerhq.hu). I follow their mailing-list
closely and mplayer plays (nearly) every movie format you throw at it,
for example *avi (divx), mpeg1/2, divx5, fli, film (from sega game cd)
roq (id film sequences, for instance from quake 3 or rtcw), qt kinda,
rm kinda, asf streaming even, wmv ....
</P>
<P>
So, take a look, it works great.

<br>asked by bharath kumar

<P><STRONG>
hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
we are working on a project which involves
playing with the network for capturing the packets.
Right now we are stuck because we only know about
SKBUFF i.e. socket buffer.But we are not able to
track any detailed information about how to use it.
Everywhere there is a brief introduction to the
SKBUFF functions but not on how to use it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If your team can help us in
directing to a site or some other source through
which we can capture each &amp; every packet traversing
through the network into our own Queues(userspace)
it would be a great help to us.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
We would be very grateful to u if u can help us
in this matter.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanking you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Regards
Bharath Kumar
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hi Bharath Kumar,
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure about the SKBUFF functions, but you have at least three tools
available for just viewing network traffic and saving the data to files for
later playback.
</P>
<P>
You have tcpdump, ethereal, and tethereal.  Ethereal gives
you a GUI-based package where you could collect packets and view the stuff
later with a detailed dissassembly of the packets.  Tethereal gives you a
text based equivalent version of ethereal.
</P>
<P>
Tcpdump is the old standby program which is yet another command line
application.  You get dumps of packets to the display, you get filtering
capability, and you could save the dumps to a file.  I should mention that
ethereal also lets you filter the data.  I have not tried filtering with
tethereal.
</P>
<P>
Regards,
Chris Gianakopoulos
</P>
<P>
man tcpdump, and the related software, like the pcap packet capture
library.  You might find that just letting tcpdump will be good enough
for you; if not, the sources will likely serve as a hint.
</P>
<P>
Cheers,

<P><STRONG>
i have a cd of a <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> distrobution, is it posible to find the
background folder and copy it to my mandrake 8.1 box, so that i can use
the debian swirl as a background to Gnome and <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
thanks from elliot
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I'm sure that it's possible, if not very easy.  You would have to find the
file in question and copy it from the CD to the appropriate dir of your
mandrake system.  The trick is finding the file.  I don't use kde or
gnome, so I can't be of much help with very specific information.
However, if you have midnight commander installed (if you don't, then you
should!) you can probably get the file you need - it will require also
having "dpkg-deb" installed.  That will allow you to open the Debian pkg
file where the kde <TT>/</TT> gnome backgorind of interest is, and copy it to your
system.  It is probably a little beyond the level of neophyte though, so
would require some reading up &amp; digging for info on your part as to the
whereabouts of those files under kde <TT>/</TT> gnome.

Someone forcing you to use Mandrake and you want to show your debian colors?
</P>
<P>
Hmm, other than that it seems highly wierd to put a debian swirl on a
Mandrake box (doesn't someobdy have a sufficiently cool magic hat and
wand?) ... you might check in what is called the "propaganda" collection
of wallpapers.  I think it usually ships with large K setups anyway, but
it has a repository on the net.
</P>
<P>
Also there are lots of themes at themes.org - probably the ol' Progeny theme
is up there, and that probably has the Great Swirl on it.

<br>asked by dwulkan from earthlink.net

<P>
Answer by Eduardo Perez Esteban:
</P>
<P>
Yes, you can tell DHCP to answer requests coming only from a specified
set of MAC adresses. Use the "deny unknown-clients" flag for this.
</P>
<P>
Note that this is a very weak security enhacement: an attacker only
needs to know the network address you are using and try several IPs
until he finds an empty one.
</P>
<P>

Edu.

<HR width="10%" align="center"><P>
Answer by Bill Barber:
</P>
<P>
This would be my suggested entries to <TT>/etc/dhcpd.conf</TT>
</P>
<P>
The xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:01; represents your MAC addresses and the belief would be
if the MAC address is not in the list, it would not get an assigned IP
address, I do these type of entries for my servers, but I also have
non-MAC-specified hosts, so I don't know if it would refuse with just that.
I think if you dropped the subnet portion, you would get an error.

<BR>asked by Jacqueline Faherty 


<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Alright I am getting close with running <A HREF="http://www.dosemu.org/">DOSEMU</A> but I have run
into a glitch.  It loads and runs MSDOS but I can't get Himem.sys to
install properly.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have added the proper lines to my msdos config.sys file.  Here is
what it reads:
</STRONG></P>
<Pre><STRONG>
DOS=HIGH,UMB
BUFFERS=30
FILES=50
STACKS=0,0
LASTDRIVE=Z

device=c:\dos\himem.sys
devicehigh=c:\dos\emm386.exe ram
</STRONG></Pre>
<P>
You mean that this is the adequate setup for your applications under
`true' ms-dos, right? If so, can you check what the `mem' command
says once you have booted your machine into a real-mode dos session?
It'll be a good starting point to determine what your memory
requirements actually are (see below).
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Then the config.sys within freedos reads:
</STRONG></P>
<Pre><STRONG>
DOS=UMB,HIGH
lastdrive=H
files=20
rem buffers=10
device=c:\dosemu\himem.sys
devicehigh=c:\dosemu\emm386.exe ram
rem devicehigh=c:\dosemu\cdrom.sys
shell=c:\command.com /e:1024 /p
</STRONG></Pre>
<P><STRONG>
But when I start dosemu I get the following messages:
</STRONG></P>
<Pre><STRONG>
HIMEM: DOS XMS Driver, Version 3.10 - 09/30/93
Extended Memory Specification (XMS) Version 3.0
Copyrigth 1988-1993 Microsoft Corp.

ERROR: An Extended Memory Manager is already installed.
XMS Driver not installed
</STRONG></Pre>
<P>
Yep. This is caused by the `himem.sys' line for sure.
</P>
<P>
Since an extended memory manager is already integrated in dosemu's
core, you don't actually need `himem.' All the necessary XMS
functions are available upon startup even without it -- hopefully.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
EMM386 not installed - protected mode software already running.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The original `emm386' won't run if the CPU is not in real-mode (as
opposed to protected/virtual mode). Linux being run in protected mode,
this is the reason why an alternative `ems.sys' is shipped with dosemu.
Normally this replacement expanded memory manager should provide the
same facilities to dos programs as its MS counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The largest part of EMS memory management code is probably hidden deep
within dosemu itself (ems.sys is only a few hundred bytes in size!)
Advantage: more memory available for dos programs 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I know emm.sys comes with DOSEMU but I need to load emm386.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Mmm... What makes you think so?
</P>
<P>
AFAIK the only tunable settings regarding the memory management in
dosemu are:
</P>
<ul>
<li> The amount of `conventional' memory seen by dos (normally 640 Kb).
<li> The location of the EMS page frame in (low) memory.
<li> The amount of memory to reserve for XMS, EMS and DPMI respectively.
<li> A set of locations/ranges of hardware RAM zones (none by default).
</ul>
<P>
All this is controlled by the dosemu built-in memory managers.
</P>
<P>
By using the output of the abovementioned `mem' command in a `true' dos
session, you should be able to set up the relevant parameters in your
dosemu.conf file and get your application programs happy; e.g.
</P>

In your dosemu.conf file the corresponding settings would be:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>$_dosmem = (640)        # in Kbyte, &lt;= 640 (default)
$_xms = (98304)         # in Kbyte (instead of the default 1024 Kb)
$_ems = (32768)         # in Kbyte (instead of the default 2048 Kb)
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
In fact you should not give such high values to dosemu. 16 megabytes
for each (or even less) may still meet your actual requirements.
Begin with large enough values then decrease them and retry until you
find the optimal setup.
</P>
<P>
If this method doesn't succeed, well... I don't know. Maybe the apps
you're trying to run do not comply with the EMS official specs.
Aren't there Linux ports or equivalent programs?
</P>
<P>
Oh, and don't forget to replace the himem and emm386 lines in
your config.sys with:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>device=c:\dosemu\ems.sys

(or devicehigh=...)

</STRONG></P>
<P>
And in fact the system won't let you do that unless you increase the
kernel SHMMAX setting (amount of IPC shared memory available for user
processes) as well. The Linux kernel (2.4.x) default value is 32
megabytes. In the above example you would need at least 96 + 32 = 128
Mb of shared memory.
</P>
<P>
For in such a case, dosemu would complain about being unable to satisfy
the user's memory settings (see the boot.log file). Assuming you have
enough RAM in your system, you'd have to issue (as root) a command like:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>echo 134217728 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
The actual value -- expressed in <EM>bytes</EM> -- would depend on the total
amount of memory (XMS + EMS + DPMI) set up in your configuration file.
</P>
<P>
However strangely enough the 2.2.x kernel doesn't seem to impose such
restrictions (although the <TT>/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax</TT> entry is present).

Hi Brian!

under dos too:

The owner has a big fat (no wait, ext2 <img src="../gx/dennis/smily.gif"
alt=":D" align="botton">) WARNING: that write support is
at the moment very, very risky.  Which I guess puts it in the same boat as
Linux' NTFS support...
</P>
<P>
Peter van Sebille wrote FSDEXT2 as a standard MSwin filesystem driver (Jay
found it too.  "Hi Jay!" she says waving cheerily), but it does not write
at all;  he had "0.16" stable and "0.17" dev (the dev
one under GPL)... but another fellow Gerald Shnabel seems to have taken up
the torch, at least enough to make it work on his win98 systems, and
released version 0.163.  For you license fans out there, he derived it
from the license-unknown 0.16, but explicitly put copyrights and announced
that it's under the GPL:
<A HREF="http://www.schnabel-online.de/fsdext2.html"
	>http://www.schnabel-online.de/fsdext2.html</A>

<P>
Way back in 1995 the Linux Gazette mentioned ext2tool, and since I found it
mentioned in the dosutils directory on my <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.3 stuff, I guess the thing
still exists.  Too bad SuSE only provided the sources (eep) so it makes me
really wonder how long it's been since they were last tested...

filing system is ntfs.  If I need to partiton the disk is there some
very, very, very simple info on how to do it available.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Yes you need at least one partition for Linux, preferably several. There's
some info at <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Linux+WinNT.html"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/mini/Linux+WinNT.html</A>
</P>
<P>
If you don't want to reinstall from scratch your best bet is to buy/borrow a
copy of PartitionMagic and use that to shrink your XP partition and make
space for Linux partitions.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to run Linux off just one partition, but well chosen multiple
partitions make it more robust, as filling one partition won't bring the
whole system down.
</P>
<P>
As a minimum you need a root partition and it's rare to run Linux without a
swap partition as well. There are some recommendation for partition sizes in
the Answer Gang Knowledgebase at
<A HREF="../issue58/tag/11.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue58/tag/11.html</A> and you may also want to

<BR>asked by halblas from weos.de


<P><STRONG>
Hi! All
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Does anyone know of a linux site which gives a brief description of each &amp;
every option given in the "xconfig screen"
while recompiling a linux kernel.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Besides the help button next to each of them which <EM>have</EM> useful information
in most of the cases -- no I don't know websites having a full list.
Also the ones difficult to choose are not the standard options which have
very helpful entries in the "help" anyway. Mostly the problem is with short
lived hacks which are there for some few kernel versions and disappear again.
It would be rather difficult to keep a website up to date.
</P>
<P>
A look into the kernel source is always helpful (for example one could search
recursively through all *.c and *.h file in the kernel tree where the
OPTION_FLAG is actually used and have a look in that file. Some of the
sources are extensively commented, especially the details of some hacks or
the consequences of using/not using certain options. I remember lot of
configurable (and documented!) options directly in the source of the aic7xxx
SCSI module which now gradually moved over to xconfig entires.
</P>
<P>
There are webpages (like www.kernel.org) where you can have annotated kernel
source, browse it and have direct access to the changelog files which also
are helpful in some cases for choosing kernel options.
</P>

<P><STRONG>
Sir,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have been unable to print with my Printer (NEC PinWriter 5300) I
am using RH 6.0 and my printer is an (old) NEC pinwriter. I'll already
email the manufacturer of this Printer then they told me used Epson
LQ850. I use the Epson LQ850 driver with Windows. Where i can get the
postscript of this printer. I checked all the How-To but I am still
clueless. Could you please help?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I recommend visiting <A HREF="http://www.linuxprinting.org"
	>http://www.linuxprinting.org</A>
</P>
<P>
I cant find the specific pinwriter, but the epson LQ850 is there, reported as
working perfectly with the ghostscript driver lq850
</P>
<P><DL><DT>
see:
<DD><A HREF="http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=63360"
	>http://www.linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=63360</A>
</DL></P>
<P>
So you have to setup your printing with the lq850 driver. To check if it's
supported by your ghostscript run:
</P>
<P><CODE>
gs --help
</CODE></P>
<P>
it seems not to be compiled into the standard ghostscript (coming with <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>
Linux [67].?) so you may have to recompile ghostscript and put the driver
lq850 in the right makefile/includefile. See the README and INSTALL coming
with ghostscript.

<P><STRONG>
Hi friends,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have tried using the mmap function
in linux and succeeded.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The Info Pages say about a particular flag in calling mmap.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
`MAP_ANON'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This flag tells the system to create an anonymous mapping,
not connected to a file.  FILEDES and OFF are ignored, and
the region is initialized with zeros.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anonymous maps are used as the basic primitive to extend the
heap on some systems.  They are also useful to "share data
between multiple tasks without creating a file".
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I want to know how 'mmap' can be used to "share data between
muliple tasks without creating a file" as is said above.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
See section 14.9 of "Advanced programming in the Unix Environment" by W
Richard Stevens. To summarise briefly, if this is used together with
MAP_SHARED, this region can be shared by the creating process and any child
processes created with fork. According to section 12.9 memory mapped regions
are not inherited across an exec.

Hi Ming,

<P>
Linux Net4 is based on Swansea University Computer Society NET3.039.  The
TCP/IP protocol suite, TCP-Reno is Berkeley code (the BSD stuff).  It is
my belief that Net4, although it may be influenced by other protocol suites,
was written from scratch (other than being derived from NET3.)

ISTR that you can't do this sort of thing remotely. If you want to muck about
with ownership you need to do it on the exporting server. I forget the
details but essentially you are only root for local filesystems, thus
limiting the damage that remote hosts can do on exported filesystems.

we have all the linux gazette on the school intranet and from reding the
artcles i find myself hooked on linux, i have one question though does
installing Nvidia drivers for a Geforce 2 GTS overwrite Xfree 4.0.? or
are drivers and xfree different as i would like to play quake and unreal
on mandrake 8.1 Kernel 2.4.? but xfree 4.0.? is only 2D and xfree 3.36
with experimental 3D is very Poor.
HI,
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
The nvidia drivers are just modules that plug into XFree86-4.
Installing the nvidia drivers will not overwrite the Mandrake X drivers.
</P>
<P>
The reason being... the nvidia drivers are closed source, and there is
only a binary distribution available from nvidia.   There is an
opensource project that writes open drivers (The ones installed by
Mandrake)
</P>
<P>
In the XF86Config-4 file (edit with care in mandrake) the drivers are
named "nv" for the open source ones and "nvidia" for the closed source
ones.
</P>
<P>
The closed source drivers are far superior with very good 3d support.
You will not win any brownie points from RMS for infecting your system
with these.... but boy they run.
</P>
<P>
On the nvidia web site there is RPMs compiled for Mdk8.1, they work very
well.
</P>
<P>
The "nvidia" drivers need a kernel module called "NVdriver", that has to
be compiled agains the kernel headers for your current kernel.  This is
a non event with a standard Mandrake install, if you have downloaded
that spunky new 2.4.18 kernel and tweaked it... download the source
release for the NV_Kernel module from nvidia and recompile against the
new kernel headers.
</P>
<P>
Some of these steps are tricky, if you are unsure, let me know... I have
done this a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
Kind Regards
Johan H.

Do you happen to have Memory with parity? I've never seen a message like
yours -- but this looks like a detected unrecoverable memory fault. (this
bank 1 line gives me the hint).
</P>
<P>
grab memtest86 from somewhere and run it as long as it needs to throw the
memory errors at you. Could be over night.....
Check if the memory modules are sitting tight in their sockets and repeat.
Exchange the memory modules and test again. If still errors occur throw it
away and get a new one.

</P>
<P>
If you've got, say, four modules, do this: swap 1 and 2. If the error
address doesn't change, then the problem is not in those; if it does, then
swap 1 and 3. If the address doesn't change after that, the error is in #2;
otherwise, it's in #1. I'm sure you can figure out the rest of the
troubleshooting method from there.

i have a 32 mb geforce 2 GTS running with a 21&quot; monitor under mandrake
8.1 using xfree86 4.1.0 and latest nvidia drivers at 1600x1200
my question is can i run this resolution and put a 32mb tnt2 PCI
graphics card in aswell to run at 800x600 i have run two montiors before
on my windows box but both cards have to be at the same resolution, i am
asking this as i have a spare graphics card and old 15" monitor laying
around and want to put them to good use

I guess this release notes could give a hint:
<DD><A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/RELNOTES4.html#17"
	>http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/RELNOTES4.html#17</A>
</DL></P>
<P>
I myself run the NVdriver on a laptop -- but there use the nvidia TwinView
option and it's one card with two screens. It rather convienient to define
different resolutions and relations of the two screens (like the small one is
s specific part of the large one for presentations where you can have
additional shell windows nobody else is seeing on the beamer 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> or you can
tell it that the CRT is left (or right, above,...) the Laptop.
Then the two screens act as one huge one. The same "restrictions" as in the
XFree link  apply: most Window managers just don't care about the screens and
open the windows where ever they please -- which might be right across both
screens.
</P>
<P>
The "normal" (i.e. not xinerma or Twinview) mode is to run two X-displays on
the two screens. Then you can't just cross from one screen to the other
dragging some window. You have to give it a "-display :0.0" or :0.1 as display
name and the window will go there.
</P>
<P>
Since you've got the cards how about trying ? PCI ad AGP cards should be able
to share or rearrange their resources so the can coexist.
</P>

<P><STRONG>
after reading my favourite computer mag i became interested in one main
topic of their ramblings
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
that was that there may be a operating system available soon called
winux
that can run linux and windows programs natively, i am unsure of who is
trying to make this or wether it will go ahead, perhaps you know
something about this new OS, because it seems quite interesting.
</STRONG></P>

I think that's LindowsOS, see <A HREF="http://www.lindows.com"

Among other things the newer code is now less idiotic regarding the
perfectly good S3 family cards I have around my place.  However I'm not
jumping from working X 3.3.6 for that alone.  Lots of other new drivers
to clue in on either older cards, or bleeding-edge-new cards.  The mice
drivers are sparter now.  Gamers and other GL fans will be pleased to know
Mesa got merged.  Other cool things.  PEX and XIE extensions are deprecated
and SuperProbe was removed (waaaah, I liked being able to ask the darn thing
what it thought it was finding, seperately of a startup attempt).
</P>
<P>
One of the beauties of free software, as well as the "everything is parts"
UNIX-like philosophy, is that (drum roll please) you do <EM>not</EM> have to upgrade
to the latest-and-greatest all the time just to make a few major apps work.
</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
i am currently using version 4.01 on linux mandrake 8.1 and have =
downloaded the nvidia drivers for my geforce 2gts
i am unsure of what files i need to download as i cannot see a single =
file, all i see is confusion as i am very new to linux,
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
the nvidia site is somewhat confusing there, I agree. But then it's only a
very long list of binary distributions -- you want to get one of them only if
it's matchings yous exactly.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Otherwise take the generic source tgz packet and compile yourself. The README
contains the steps necessary to install them. It's long and goes through all
of the various packages for all the distributions so you need to read only
some part up front and then the specific part for the package you actually
got.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Generally you will need the GLX-package and the kernel package.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
can i install the nvidia drivers on xfree 4.01 and upgrade to xfree 4.2 =
later.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
no idea -- I'm running the 1.1514 nivida drivers right now and that does not
require 4.2, so I didn't bother upgrading a running system.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Hmm, 4.2 says it released late January, so maybe if my more experienced eyes
surf over to nVidia...
</P>
<P>
Hmm, "Drivers" at the top of the Nav, "Linux" last among the bullets, new
driver release posted March 7.  (wow, only a few days ago)  Not that hard
to find, at all.
</P>
<P>
The part more likely to be confusing to newbies is that the driver comes in
two parts -- a component to be added to your X server, and a component to be
added to your kernel source before building a fresh kernel.  That means you'll
want to have sources around for X (oh dear, building X isn't for novices) and
for your kernel (make menuconfig is pretty easy to use).
</P>
<P>
Or, if you happen to use one of the two distros the nVidia people themselves
use, you can get <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> or Mandrake packages... no <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>, eh?  that sucks.
I seem to recall nVidia doesn't want other folks shipping their binaries?
(clicking open that "Legal Info" link) hmm, standard corporate "this is ours
not yours and you're licensed for one copy at a time" stuff.  That would
suggest that I'm right in this regard.  Checking <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, there's a package
'nvidia-glx-src' which builds it for you, but the version in testing is
(no big surprise to me) not the one posted a few days ago.  Which is ok since
it still has xfree 4.1 in it too.
</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
also how can i boot to console mode to install the nvidia drivers, or =
can you just do it from an rpm installer in x.
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>
nVidia notes that they have an NVchooser script you can use, and it will get
you the right rpm.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
You may be able to upgrade from X -- overwriting the former X drivers present.
On reboot this could get you in trouble if your default is a graphical login.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I <EM>really</EM> would have X turned off while you update it.   And I <EM>really</EM> would
back it up, since if your X already works it's a running setup, and if the
new stuff doesn't work so happily, you'd lose your GUI.  Which is even worse
than annoying if you use a GUI login prompt 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
Anyways the real reason it's important is that file handles for any old parts
which are open, will not be re-opened to clue in.  To be sure you did that
you'd need to stop X anyway.  Safer to <EM>know</EM> it all got tweaked at once, then
turn it back on...
</P>
<P><STRONG>
You could try typing (as root):
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><CODE>
init 1
</CODE></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
on the commandline of a shell which would bring you down to a text-login
screen in single user mode. To test the news drivers you could try "startx"
to get an X-screen back.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You might have to turn networking back on... single user mode strips a lot
more than most people want.   Me, I favor keeping a text mode runlevel around;
that'd usually be telinit 3.
</P>
<P>
One of the few things that gives me a headache in Debian is that when you add
new bits that darned thing tends to add them to ALL the runlevels.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
If it's ok end it again and issue "init 3" or 5 (?) to get back to the
graphical login.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
traditionally it's been 5, but you <EM>really</EM> have to check your own system's
init sequence to be sure.  Before you start poking around in single user
you can run the command 'runlevel' and it will tell you where you're at
already. For me <TT>/sbin/runlevel</TT> generates
N 3
</P>
<P>
meaning, I didn't have a "previous" runlevel, and I'm currently at runlevel
3 (consistent with me preferring text logins).
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm not running mandrake so I can't give you too much specifics on the init
levels they use or if there is something like startx.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
K.-H.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I believe they still have a directory structure similar to RH in that regard.
I haven't encountered distros without startx in a loooong time, but, if you
use a GUI login that's not how you're normally launching it, but gdm or its
cousins tend to use the same xinitrc under the hood.
