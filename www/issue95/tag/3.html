Please note I am trying to configure IP on a <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 9

default DHCP configuration to a STATIC configuration.

<P><STRONG>
I have tried a couple of things only to trash a test

I know the hostname is saved in

What are the other files necessary to changing the

<blockQuote>
once logged in (as root) do
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
ifdown eth0
ifconfig eth0 address &lt;your ip address&gt;
then if you access a router directly do
route add gw &lt;name of your default gateway&gt;
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If this works add to <TT>/etc/hosts</TT> a line
&lt;your hostname (machie name)&gt; &lt;your machines IP address&gt;

I felt stupid reading that, too.  I've complained for years at the lack
of documentation for those.  Sometimes I just read through the rc
scripts that source the <TT>/etc/sysconfig</TT> files to figure how which names
they want to use.  Sometimes I just run the silly GUI config tool
(when I can remember which name it goes by in which versions of Red
Hat).  I had never found this particular file.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I still think it's a bug.  Red Hat should include a set of comments in
each <TT>/etc/sysconfig</TT> file that list all of the valid variable names and
show examples of the valid values.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now that the "Red Hat Distribution" is a "community maintained project"
rather than a shrink wrapped product ... heck with it; I'll still
recommend that advanced Linux users switch to <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> and that
businesses pressure Oracle and other ISVs to support Debian.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I think the "Red Hat community project" should set a goal for itself --
to provide a transition to Debian over the next several releases.  They
can write rpm command wrappers around apt-get/dpkg, add or help Debian
add the -V and -K (verification and GnuPG key package signing) features
to the .deb package format and the <TT>/var/lib/dpkg</TT> "database"), etc.

Gack, I hope that never happens, I dislike Debian intensely. I use it on
some of my servers and I grate my teeth every time I need to do
something with it. Debian needs a lot more then just a rpm wrapper. I'll
try not to start a religious war here and simply say you stick with
Debian and I'll stick with Red Hat and I hope they get more compatible
but I hope that happens by Debian getting closer to Red Hat and not the
reverse (except apt-get, that is quite nice).

Yeeew. I sure hope that never happens either. I really hate the "papa
knows best, just watch the blinkenlights" approach of RedHat, and money
is what it takes to get me to play with it these days.

Fortunately, none of this is an issue since we <em> _do</em> have both of these
distros plus a whole lot of others, which seems to satisfy a broad range

I strongly disagree here. The beauty of Linux and the various projects
is there is no "one true way" and those who like it different can have
it that way. Otherwise you are just like Microsoft and Apple each having
a single "true way".

I have similar opinions on gentoo; why create a new distibution when
they could have poured that energy into creating a Debian build system
that could build your entire distribution from sources, with locally
defined optimization and other flags).  (BTW: the argument that this
results in significant performance gains seems to have been somewhat
refuted:

I knew my statement was likely to rankle.  However, without it
degenerating into a religous war, what specific things do you dislike
about debian?  <TT>/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*</TT> versus
<TT>/etc/network/interfaces?</TT>  The installer?  Lack of Kickstart?  The
dpkg commant?  dpkg-reconfigure or dpkg-repack?  The fact that many
packages ask configuration questions during pre-install or
post-install?  The fact that you can't tell the package manager to
exclude the docs during installation?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I want to know because I'd like to see Debian make the necessary
changes or options available to make Red Hat users happier.

This is important in the business world where you need 50 machines
exactly the same, not close but exactly the same. Also unless you make
your own Debian depository the changes in the Debian tree make it all
but impossible to do this if you are installing machines over the course
of several months.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Another irritant is that Debian package
maintainers patch the packages to run in funny places and have odd
patches on them. We were running SAMBA on one machine and we were having
a major problem that we could not explain. As luck would have it I was
able to get tridge to take a look and even he was mystified for several
hours. As it turned out the package maintainer had really messed up the
package. There is not enough testing done on the edge cases by the
Debian developers, so either leave the source alone or truly understand
it and test all possible uses of the package which in the case of SAMBA
is impossible, the SAMBA developers have spent a huge amount of time
getting donated machines available to be able to test the edge cases,
there is no way a Debian developer is going to have access to the same
resources that the SAMBA developers have.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
At tridge's advice and this is advice I've been given many times from
others as well. "Use Debian as a base install but for packages you
really care about make your own from source as you never quite know what
they've done to them." The problem with this of course is if I can't
trust what I'm installing then why am I installing it at all?

Followed by the fact that stable is most always too old thus forcing me
to use testing which gets broken at times.

I don't think it's possible for Debian developers to make Red Hat users
happier, they like to do things their way and the hell with the rest of
the folks. An example, change the init levels to match Red Hats, make
init 3 the normal run level sans X and level 5 with X. Virtually every
other Linux distro is the same as Red Hat very very few are different.
But as a business software developer I need to know that if my package
it to be installed on both Red Hat and Debian I need to install my
startup scripts in different run levels or bad things happen. That is
silly.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I agree that one does need to minimize <EM>gratuitous</EM> differences so
tackle the run level differences first, if you can get that changed
(which I strongly doubt) perhaps there is a possibility that Debian can
become a stronger player in the Corporate market place. What I think you
will get is many reasons why Debian is correct but that is irrelevant,
it's not about being technically correct it's about minimizing
<EM>gratuitous</EM> differences, and I don't think it's possible for the Debian
community to change.

Well "funny places" is the main sort of gratuitous change I also object
too.  FHS was supposed to reduce this (and probably has, somewhat).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
We could argue that Red Hat and <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> put their stuff in "funny"
places; then we could both reach for copies of the FHS to bolster
our arguments.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I agree about the runlevels and the way the run xdm as an rc script
rather than in inittab.  Those are gratuitous and Debian should bow
to the more widespread convention in both cases.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As for the Samba anecdote: so what.  Red Hat applies over a 100 patches
to their kernels and they apply patches to many packages, including
core packages like Samba.  We could exchange package maintainer horror
stories for hours.  <EM>Usually</EM> the Debian packaging is better than
Red Hat packaging.  Debian has a published policy that is derived from
the consensus of it's maintainers/developers.  There are ongoing
discussions on how to change that policy.  Maintainers that don't
conform to the policy see NMUs (non-maintainer uploads) of their
packages and are eventually replaced by new maintainers.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course it's possible for them to change.  It is easier for us to
change Debian than it would be for us to change Red Hat Inc.

Jim, here again we differ, I feel it's easier to change Red Hat all it
takes is cash, nothing more nothing less. Changing Debian is akin to
herding cats you have to get a large portion of the entire development
community into agreement which is damned hard if not impossible to do.
You need to join them in overwhelming force in order to out vote them on
policy. Any single person is doomed to failure, it was designed that way
and it works quite well. Debian is a hackers play land, it was designed
to be that and that it will stay, the bylaws they live by are
specifically designed to keep it that way and human inertia and apathy
will tend to keep it that way.

How long did it take to fix the networking init script that would only
start networking and not stop or reset it take? More then 3 years by my
count, if you can't fix something like a simple init script how you
expect to fix a fundamental difference in philosophy?

To effectively change Red Hat Inc. we have to either buy them, or
represent a large enough portion of their revenues that they'll listen.
To change Debian all we have to do is join them, work on the project and
explain our reasons for recommending the change.
</blockQuote>

My problem with the Red Hat "distribution" is that it's been
essentially abandoned by Red Hat Inc.  Now, the community will maintain
it; RH Inc. will take parts that they like and fold them into their
proprietary AS/ES products.  However, RH will also make changes that
may make AS/ES diverge somewhat from the RH distro.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
My comments are mostly intended to discourage people from create
<EM>yet another</EM> distro for broad consumer use.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm not saying everyone should just abandon the RH distro -- just
try to transition <EM>some</EM> parts to the Debian base (where that makes
sense) <EM>and</EM> to join Debian in sufficient numbers and quality to effect
changes there.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Notice that I'm mostly a proponent of changing Debian in many of the
specifics.  The one thing that I would push on the other distros
is the use of the same package/dependency infrastructure and
granularity.  I'm not talking about the commands used to manipulate
the packages (apt-get, dpkg, aptitude, rpm, etc) --- I personally
would prefer to see a command named 'pkg' taking arguments somewhat
like the rpm command (except for that idiocy of -U being "upgrade"
<EM>and</EM> install thus necessitating the odd -F --freshen switch to mean
just "upgrade").  The difference would be that pkg -i foo would
look at your local policy file (<TT>/etc/apt/sources.list</TT>) and know how
to fetch the foo from your preferred location or media.

That is not the only problem, as far as I can tell, when a package
changes (is updated) there is no history, the old package is removed and
the new inserted replacing it. I could be wrong but the gents I used at
my last place were dedicated Debian devotees and they could not find
where "outdated" packages were stored. Thus if a package was "updated"
you were screwed and could not make an identical from that point forward
unless you went to the extreme of maintaining your own Debian
depository.

If it happens at all I expect it to take several years and releases
of each of the two distributions.  We've already seen lots of people
implementing apt on RPM based distributions.  The problem with that
superficial approach is that the underlying granularity and dependency
cycle problems remain.  The real value of Debian in in that
acyclic dependency tree.

Joining the distro wars once more ...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Just some random points.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
1. While Kickstart is a great idea, systemimager is not a bad
replacement. For the more hardcore debian-ers, Kickstart seems too
complicated when compared with "dpkg --get-selections" in combination with
"dpkg --set-selections".
</blockQuote>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] I have to agree here. I have used RH's kickstart one when I first setup
my little 386 server. It was a pain to begin with.
</blockquote></font>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Kapil] 
2. When comparing "rpm" with "dpkg" (or deb) what is lacking in dpkg is
the automated signature/md5sum checking. On the other hand try to unpack
an "rpm" on a non-RedHat machine...not all that automatic (you need to
install "alien"). To unpack a "deb"...you will (most likely) find "ar" on
any machine and so can unpack deb's quite easily.
</blockQuote>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] I have to disagree slightly here. If one does not care for the "install"
script that is inherent in either a .deb or .rpm (depending on which
distro it is) then using "mc" is an efficient alternative to view the
package in question and manually copy the files across to the specific
directories. I don't recommend this for hugely dependent packages, but
it is an effective means for smaller packages, where there are no
dependencies
</blockquote></font>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Kapil] 
3. I don't dislike RedHat as intensely as David seems to dislike Debian!
However, the choice was made for me by RedHat when they decided to exclude
text-mode tools for installation and management. Even "dselect" is
better than nothing except "rpm". I used "purp" on RedHat systems for
a while but it was always in "contrib" and often out-of-date.
</blockQuote>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] Using "dselect" under Debian is NOT a good idea -- it is extremely
clunky, not to mention it has a terrible UI. I would always recommend
people to use "aptitude"; both as a replacement for "dselect" AND
"apt-get". It functions as both dselect (without any arguments) and as
apt-get on invocation. It also handles dependencies and logging much
better, in my opinion.
</blockquote></font>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Kapil] 
4. Re: xdm. I think all daemons were "meant to be" started from rc scripts
so in fact the RedHat policy of starting "xdm" from inittab is strange.
For example, in the old days it was possible for the console user
to somehow "kill" the xdm/gdm/kdm on RedHat (possibly by killing the
X server or something) causing all external Xterminal users to be
logged out!
</blockQuote>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] Exactly! I have had this very gripe with RH and even tried e-mailing
them to ask them why they did not move xdm et al to rc scripts. They
never did reply to me. As Kapil notes, if something goes wrong with xdm
then it can be of consequences to other processes.

5. Finally, about building things from source. To some extent I agree. It
would be nice if we had the following set-up:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
A. All the system administrator had to do to was install a base system.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
B. Most utility/application packages could be installed
by <EM>users</EM> in (say) <TT>/opt/username/packagename/{bin</TT>,lib,...}.
</blockQuote>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] I disagree with this suggestion. Instead installing applications to
$HOME is still an acceptable solution as $PATH usually includes
$HOME/bin anyhow.
</blockquote></font>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Kapil] 
C. There would be a user-level package management system that would
allow users to mix and match their requirements by creating symlink
farms in <TT>/home/username/{bin</TT>,lib,...} that point to different packages
under <TT>/opt</TT> possibly installed by different users.
</blockQuote>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] Hmmm, installing applications system-wide and then allowing users to
have custom settings in $HOME is no more different than the
suggestion above.

This way, those users who need "cutting edge" or even "bleeding edge"
tools could install them. The system could remain "stable" and
(hopefully) "secure". Such a setup may even be useful on single-user
systems as the user could play with upgrades without messing up the
running system. Disk space is not really an issue any more unless you
use "<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>" or "Gnome" or "Openoffice"
