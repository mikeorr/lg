COMDEX in Chicago (April 20-23) was a titanic Linux hit. Vendors around us were astonished
by the attention and business we drew to our booths.
<p>
The Linux Pavilion had a huge sign overhead (thanks to Carlie Fairchild of
<i>Linux Journal</i> and Andy Wahtera, our new ZD/COMDEX representative), and
multiple large floor signs guided people entering COMDEX to the Linux
International Pavilion. We had a page on the COMDEX Web site, mention in
the Show Daily and other marketing ``aids''.
<p>
Linux International vendors with booths in the Pavilion were Caldera, S.u.S.E., InfoMagic
Inc., <i>Linux Journal</i> and Red Hat Software, Inc., a small number of vendors,
but big in heart.
<p>
While smaller in attendance than its Las Vegas cousin, COMDEX in Chicago
seemed to have a lot more end-user customers than the Las Vegas
show--not
really surprising when you consider Chicago is a cultural, economic and
manufacturing center. While Mr. Bill was still trying to boot Windows 98 and
have it stay up, the Linux International Pavilion was singing a sweet song.
Some people thought we had set a new world's record for ``longest line at
COMDEX''--the line where people waited to pick up a free Linux CD-ROM.
<p>
I accompanied Red Hat's ``booth gang'', Anna, Terry and
Mike, to visit the Argonne National Laboratory and Western Suburban Chicago
Linux Users Group (which thankfully is abbreviated AALUG and has its web site
at http://hydra.pns.anl.gov/lug/lug-main.html). The meeting was actually held
at the Fermi National Lab, which recently announced that Linux will be
officially supported at their laboratory and with their applications. Donnie
Barnes flew in from Durham, North Carolina to give a talk on Red Hat 5.0, and
to help give out Red Hat ``souvenirs''. I gave a brief talk at the end of
Donnie's epic speech.
<p>
After the meeting ended, Dr. G. P. Yeh, a physicist in the computing division,
invited us on a tour to see a particle-collider detector. Fermi is expanding
their collider, and the new one is expected to produce more than 20 times the
data of its predecessor. To expand the computing power to analyze and
store this data in real time with traditional methods would have been very
costly, so now Fermi is building a 1000-node Beowulf system to detect quarks
(and other little things). Dr. Yeh
told us that without Linux and the concept of Beowulf systems, the costs of supplying computer power for the next
generation of collider would be many times what they are now forecasting.
<p>
Our sincere thanks to Dan Yocum for setting up the meeting at Fermi and
advertising it, and to Dr. Yeh for showing us the collider.
<p>
On Wednesday S.u.S.E. gave a talk at the Chicagoland Linux Users Group, and
on Thursday I gave a two-hour ``ramble'' to the same group after COMDEX
was over. Then, tired and thirsty, most people retired to the Goose Island
Brewpub.
<p>
The Chicagoland Linux Users Group (http://clug.cc.uic.edu/) helped to staff
the Linux International booth, hand out flyers and line up user group
meetings. So ``thank you'' to Clyde Reichie, Don Weimann, Simon Epsteyn,
William Golembo, Gennagy ``Ugean'' Polishchuk, Long Huynh, Perry Mages, Viktorie
Navratilova, Ben Galliart, Richard Hinton, and especially to Dave Blondell,
the president, who organized the group and the schedules.
<p>
Linux International would like to encourage other Linux vendors to join us in
the next Linux Pavilion at COMDEX, whether it be in Las Vegas or Chicago. We
are definitely looking forward to the next COMDEX in the windy city. For
