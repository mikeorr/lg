<h1>A way to connect an iPod Touch to a MIPSnetbook</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/borisov.html">Anton Borisov</a></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
A couple years ago, I had a chance to work with industrial MIPS-based VME
boards. It was so unusual to see that the modern failure-proof world
actually extends beyond x86-architecture. Those VME boards had a Linux
distrubution running, so no special knowledge was required to log in, and
perform a task. Being designed for industrial purposes, it would be
irrational to buy it for home use - so when I heard about a Chinese
hardware company named Lemote <a href="#borisov.html_1">[1]</a>, which has
MIPS-based products in its portfolio, my first thought was
- &quot;Those guys have what I need - MIPS netbooks. I want it here, by my
side&quot;. That's how the story began. 
</p>

<p>
If you're a reasonably literate user of GNU/Linux system, then your
experience with any netbook should be quite smooth - just as it was for me.
As a matter of fact, the Yeeloong netbook has Debian preinstalled, with
repositories tuned to update the &quot;lenny&quot; release. My first step
was to upgrade Debian to the latest packages available. It's generally nice
to have the most recent applications, the important ones in my case being
gcc and building tools. 
</p>

<h3>Connecting to iPod via iTunnel transport</h3>
<p>
Apple fans should know that to synchronize/copy files to an iPod or iPhone,
an average user needs to have iTunes installed on a PC.  It's ludicrous,
but iTunes is only available for Mac OS/X and Windows - and the most
ludicrous thing about iTunes is that it's compiled for x86 architecture
only. No more PowerPC, only x86/x86_64. Should I even bother mentioning
Linux and MIPS here? 
</p>

<p>
I have an iPod Touch, second
generation. A very handy device, with multi-touch and mobile Safari
to surf the net via Wi-Fi. However, I faced a tough problem - how do
I copy audio and video files onto it without Microsoft Windows and
iTunes, i.e., directly from Linux?  There is a solution, actually - you
might be interested in doing a <em>jail-break</em> for your iPod, in order to
install an SSH server and make a direct connection by means of SSHFS<a id="borisov.html_2_back"></a><a href="#borisov.html_2">[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
While writing about performing a jail-break is beyond the scope of
this article, I can gladly tell you - it was scary, but at the end, I
had a wonderful feeling - <em>it works!</em>  And to cheer you up even
more, there is no  chance of turning your iPod into a brick. It's an
absolutely amazing device in terms of recovery and hardware design. 
</p>

<p>
Okay, back to basics. I managed
to flash an updated, i.e. 'JB' firmware with an activated SSH server.
Now, it was time to log into iPod's operating system. You can do it
via Wi-Fi network, or alternatively, via USB-cable by means of the
iTunnel <a id="borisov.html_3_back"></a><a href="#borisov.html_3">[3]</a> package. Let's see how it
works in practice. 
</p>

<p>
I grabbed the source code, and did a compilation. No external
dependencies or additional libraries were required. Kudos to
iTunnel and libiphone authors! 
</p>

<pre class="code">loongson@debian:~$ cd src/itunnel-0.0.9/
loongson@debian:~/src/itunnel-0.0.9$ make clean &amp;&amp; make</pre><p>

I'm an unprivileged user at Yeeloong netbook, so I decided to use
port 12022. 
</p>

<pre class="code">loongson@debian:~/src/itunnel-0.0.9$ ./itunnel 12022
get_iPhone() success
- successfully got device
server waiting for ssh connection on port 12022

server accepted connection, clientfd:5
client thread fd(5) running, server port 12022 , peer port 45964
tunnel now running.
SSH to localhost port 12022 to get to iPhone.
 (use ssh -D  to create SOCKS tunnel.)
do Ctrl+C to quit the server (can take a few seconds).</pre><p>

Well, everything's ready to login to iPhoneOS. Let's get to it. Don't
forget about default password though: every Apple device seems to
have a built-in 'mobile' user with password set to 'alpine'. 
</p>

<pre class="code">loongson@debian:~/src/itunnel-0.0.9$ ssh -l mobile -p 12022 localhost
mobile@localhost's password:
localhost:~ mobile$ uname -a

Quite the usual Linux environment, almost all user-space utilities have
been ported from the bigger PCs:

Of course, switching to a higher level via the 'su' command allows you to
see even more information. For instance, all the logging information
about the Wi-Fi network iPod has managed to connect to is available
through 'dmesg' output: 
</p>

<pre class="code">AppleBCM4325::setASSOCIATE() [configd]:  lowerAuth = AUTHTYPE_OPEN, upperAuth = AUTHTYPE_NONE, key = CIPHER_NONE, flags = 0x2
AppleBCM4325 Joined BSS:     BSSID = 00:14:d1:4b:e6:f7, adjRssi =  44, rssi = -46, rate = 54 (100%), channel =  1, encryption = 0x1, ap = 1, hidden = 0, directed = 0, failures =   0, age = 1, ssid = &quot;my_net&quot;
AirPort: Link Up on en0</pre><p>

Having SSH server up and running on the iPod Touch gives us the ability
to connect to it via SSHFS-connection. Let's mount iPod' storage now!
</p>

<pre class="code">loongson@debian:~$ sudo sshfs -p 12022 -o allow_other mobile@localhost:/private/var /media/usb
mobile@localhost's password:
loongson@debian:~$ df
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on

<p>
Now, let's do some simple benchmarking - copy a single file from
iPod Touch to a netbook's local filesystem: 
</p>

<pre class="code">loongson@debian:~$ rsync -v /media/usb/mobile/Media/mp3/Madonna/greatest_hits/106\ Crazy\ For\ You.mp3 .
106 Crazy For You.mp3

sent 5859015 bytes  received 31 bytes  1065281.09 bytes/sec
total size is 5858218  speedup is 1.00</pre><p>

About 1MiB/s - that's pretty fast. 
</p>

<p>
And let's perform the backward operation, i.e. copy a single file
from netbook to iPod: 
</p>

<pre class="code">loongson@debian:~$ rsync -v --progress ./wine-1.1.23.tar.bz2 /media/usb/mobile/Media/
wine-1.1.23.tar.bz2
    11075584  71%  140.08kB/s    0:00:30</pre><p>

Frustrating, isn't it? What reasonable explanation could there be?
Well, I guess the bottleneck is that the performance of iPod's CPU -
ARM processor clocked at 533 MHz could be too slow to handle encrypted
SSH packets. What should I do? Simply login to iPod, and secure copy
a necessary file from a host (i.e., Yeeloong) machine. Like this: 
</p>

<pre class="code">localhost:~ mobile$ scp loongson@10.10.1.1:/home/loongson/Kylie* .
loongson@10.10.1.1's password:
Kylie Minogue - Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi.mp3             100% 5655KB   1.1MB/s   00:05</pre><p>

<em>Voila</em> - it works! The same bandwidth in both directions!
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The approach of performing a jail-break first, and then attaching
iPod's storage to PC via SSHFS is a long way to go for something so simple.
But - and this is essential - Linux users have no other means of
transferring files to the iPod, due to a) iTunes being available for
Mac- and Windows-platforms only; b) iTunes being compiled against x86
CPU only (PowerPC/SPARC/MIPS/ARM Linux users should wave "bye-bye"!), and
c) there being no means to log onto an iPod without the SSH
server being pre-installed. On the other hand, once you have done so,
you have a full control over your lovely iPod Touch.
