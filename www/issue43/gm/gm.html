actually had a fun time putting this months column together.&nbsp; In the
past I had been trying to find technical issues to talk about from a layman's
point of view - graphics for the masses.&nbsp; This month, I just sat down
and thought about it the way I do things.&nbsp; I play.&nbsp; I find something
new and fiddle with it.&nbsp; If it's easy to learn and I can do something
useful with it in a few minutes, I keep fiddling.&nbsp; If not, I lose
interest and come back some other time, hopefully when the application
has evolved a bit more.&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>This month I started out
by looking for video editing software for Linux.&nbsp; Now, don't get your
hopes up.&nbsp; As with many good ideas, it started in one direction and
headed slightly off center - I didn't do a write up on video editing software.&nbsp;
Instead, I looked at video viewing software.&nbsp; This is something I
thought the average user might have real use for.&nbsp; But if you're still
hoping to find out what's in store for the video editing world, don't lose
hope.&nbsp; I plan on visiting that arena soon.&nbsp; We just need the
tools that are currently available to mature a little more, and we also
need a few more options to choose from for our video editing needs.</font></font>

Map Creation</a> (http://www.aquarius.geomar.de/omc/).&nbsp; You can generate
a map, download it's Postscript version and/or view and download it's GIF

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>...you can use the Iomega
Buz with Linux?&nbsp; Take a look at <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gz/buz/">http://www.lysator.liu.se/~gz/buz/</a>.&nbsp;
The Buz is a multimedia box that allows you to connect video and audio
inputs directly into your computer.&nbsp; At about $200, this is a pretty
inexpensive way to get into video editing.&nbsp; The bad news is that getting
it working on Linux requires some fairly technical understanding and willingness
to use command line tools (no graphical editing tools yet).&nbsp; This
is not for the faint of heart, the drivers required for this are somewhat
bleeding edge.&nbsp; You'll need to know how to compile kernels and install
drivers modules.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>...there is a <a href="http://linuxpower.org/display_item.phtml?id=120">good
article on producing movies on LinuxPower.org.</a>&nbsp; This article is
apparently going to be the start of a series of articles on producing movies
on Linux.&nbsp; I'll be interested to see what they say about transferring
the images to film/video (something I haven't figured out how to do on
Linux yet).&nbsp; This first article is fairly introductory and regular
readers of the Muse should be able to follow it quite easily.&nbsp; The
good news:&nbsp; it talks about all the tools we've talked about here in

<h2>
Q and A</h2>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Q:&nbsp; Anyway, I've been
experimenting with BMRT and it seems much slower than POVRay, even without
using radiosity.&nbsp; Using BMRT's area lights are really slow (but probably
more accurate) compared to POV's, although the difference doesn't seem
noticeable.</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A:&nbsp; BMRT renders with
2x2 forced oversampling by default, the adaptive oversampling it uses is
not very useful except for very high numbers of samples, because it uses
stochastic sampling.&nbsp; 2x2 oversampling is usually sufficient, but
slows it down a lot.&nbsp; As to radiosity, you can start out by setting
rsamples to 1, and most of the times the 20 or less iterations are more
than enough.&nbsp; So try</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>rendrib -samples 1 1 -radio 10 -rsamples
1 -res 640 480</font></tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>for a test image.&nbsp; Or use
the non-standard Options</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>Option "radiosity" "steps" [10]</font></tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>Option "radiosity" "minpatchsamples" [1]</font></tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you notice radiosity artifacts
(heavy banding) on large uniformly colored areas, increase the rsamples
value (this chops each face into at least this number squared patches).&nbsp;
If your modeller supports this you may also set the subdivision on a per
object basis using the non-standard attribute</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>Attribute "radiosity" "patchsize" ps "elemsize"
es "minsize" ms</font></tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For details see the BMRT documentation.</font></font>

<p><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Q.&nbsp; I have a simple
image I made with BMRT and would like to see how it would look illuminated
with radiosity.&nbsp; Does anyone have any tips on using the radiosity
settings with BMRT?</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>For simple scenes radiosity
is quite quick, and remember that it's not dependent on the image size.&nbsp;
If it takes too long you can exclude certain objects from the radiosity
calculations using the non-standard attribute</font></font>

considering doing a second course at another college which involves web
page design (HTML/Javascript etc.) and graphic design/animation (use of
Adobe, Photoshop etc.)</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In your expert opinion: is
it worth doing a structured course like this or buying a couple of web
design books and learning at home??</font></font></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><font color="#993300">'Muse</font></b>:&nbsp;
This is highly dependent on your own motivation and learning habits.&nbsp;
I, personally, learn much more on my own than in a class, but often take
a class when just starting a new topic to get me pointed in the right direction
(like photography, which I just got into recently).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>HTML is easy enough to learn
on your own - there really isn't that much too it.&nbsp; If you need to
learn a slew of specific applications it often helps to take a class (it's
often harder to learn to use the applications than just writing the HTML
yourself).&nbsp; Java is a language unto itself and I'm certain a structured
course would help.&nbsp; Design animation as a class covers a very broad
range of topics - colors, structures, paint and animation techniques, procedural
animation, etc.&nbsp; That's not a class, really - it's a whole degree.&nbsp;
Using Photoshop or some other specific tool is like what I said previously,
it helps to take a class if the tool is sufficiently complex.&nbsp; I don't
think Photoshop is hard to learn (the Gimp is easier - you could always
buy my book on how to use it, of course).&nbsp; But learning what buttons
do what functions in only a small part of the job.&nbsp; The bigger part
is how to use those buttons creatively to produce interesting effects,
sometimes to the point of being able to reproduce the effect quickly (like
drop shadows for logos, which is a very common requirement from clients)
and in the same manner each time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you're just learning web
design for fun, or even for your business, and are confident in your own
ability to teach yourself new topics, then skip the class.&nbsp; But if,
like me, you find a little push in the right direction helps, then take
the structured class.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Of course, if it makes any
difference, I've never taken any classes on HTML or computer graphics.&nbsp;
It's all self taught (except for some minor OpenGL experience, but I never
really used what I learned).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Hope that helps.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Now, on the subject of image
resolution and printing, I found this post from Brian Reynolds on one of
the Gimp mailing lists:</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>David Fokos has
written a very good paper on creating half-tone digital negatives for contact
printing.&nbsp; You can find it at Bostick &amp; Sullivan's web site at:</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><a href="http://www.bostick-sullivan.com/Technical%20papers/Digital%20Info/Dave_Fokos/davetech.htm">http://www.bostick-sullivan.com/Technical%20papers/Digital%20Info/Dave_Fokos/davetech.htm</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Besides discussing all the
details about making negatives for contact printing, this paper has a very
good explanation of the resolution metrics (dpi, ppi, lpi) for the various
types of equipment used for digital input and output and how they relate
to each other.&nbsp; The paper assumes you are using Photoshop, but gives
general enough descriptions that you aren't tied to it (as opposed to another
book on digital negatives that assumes Photoshop is the only software available).</font></font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I read the paper and Brian is
right - you can apply the digital techniques David discusses to the Gimp
just fine.&nbsp; You might need a bit of background on photography for
this paper, but it's well worth the read.</font></font>

Interactive Management of Image Maps</h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of the tools lacking from
the Linux arsenal these days is a really good interactive Web page builder.&nbsp;
I use Netscape Composer for all my pages, but this lacks any sort of integrated
graphics editor.&nbsp; You can configure it to launch an external editor,
however, and this is where the ever popular <a href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a>
comes in.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Gimp is, of course, the
best raster image editor on Linux.&nbsp; Not only does it have support
for many different effects and filters, it also has a dynamically extendable
interface through the use of plug-ins.&nbsp; One of the latest plug-ins
to gain popular attention is the <a href="http://home-2.consunet.nl/~cb007736/imagemap.html">Image
Map</a> plug-in from <a href="mailto:lpeek.mrijk@consunet.nl">Maurits Rijk</a>.</font></font>

</table>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Image Maps, for those unfamiliar
with their use, are an HTML construct that allows an Web page author to
specify regions within a single image to be used as links to different
URLs.&nbsp; Regions can be specified using rectangular, oval and polygonal
coordinates.&nbsp; Both server and client side maps are possible, although
client-side image maps are the more popular of the two types.&nbsp; This
column uses a client-side image map for navigation at the top of the page
(upper left corner of the page, just below the Graphics Muse logo).&nbsp;
By providing a method of mapping the single image into multiple links,
image maps reduce the overhead that multiple images positioned using tables
would require.</font></font>
<p><font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The current version of the
Image Map plug-in is 1.1.1.&nbsp; This version includes recent support
for HTML <i>onBlur</i> and <i>onFocus</i> tags.&nbsp; Although the interface
is fairly well designed, the program currently provides no documentation.&nbsp;
Building from source (which is how this plug-in is distributed) is simple
enough:&nbsp; just unpack it and type <i>make</i>.&nbsp; There shouldn't
be any editing of Makefiles or other configuration files necessary.&nbsp;
After compiling you can either do a <i>make install</i> or simply copy
the binary (named <b><font color="#CC6600">imagemap</font></b>) to your
</font><tt>$HOME/.gimp/plug-ins
</tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">directory
and restart Gimp.&nbsp; Once installed, the plug-in can be accessed via
the <i>Filters->Misc</i> submenu of the Image Window menu.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The interface consists of
a scrollable window on the left and the set of URL links on the right.&nbsp;
The scrolled window is a full size copy of the original image.&nbsp; Two
menu bars are provided - one using traditional pull down text menus and
the other an icon based version of the same features.&nbsp; An additional
icon based menu of region shapes (rectangular, oval, polygonal and so forth)
runs along the left side.&nbsp; The icon menus are all detachable - you
can click on the rough edged left side of each and drag it out of the main
window, although what advantage this might provide I don't know.</font></font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In order to start specifying
regions for the image map, you might first consider turning on the grid
lines.&nbsp; This can be done quickly using the Grid icon in the icon menu
bar, but you'll probably also want to adjust the granularity of the grid.&nbsp;
This can only be done by selecting Goodies->Grid Settings from the text
menus.&nbsp; This will open a dialog box where you can specify the width
and height of the grid boxes, the method for displaying the grids (lines,
crosses or hidden), an offset from the upper left corner in which to begin
the grid and, most importantly, whether region shapes are snapped to grid
intersections.&nbsp; This last item is what will make creating your image
maps rather quick and painless.</font></font>

<h2>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Linux Video Choices: A review
of Xanim, MainView, MpegTV and RealVideo.</font></font></b></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I don't do much video work on
Linux yet.&nbsp; I have a sufficiently fast box for it, I just haven't
had much more than a passing interest in it since there aren't many video
editing tools available yet.&nbsp; Still, viewing animation's (in something
other than GIF format on a browser) or streaming video has become an important
part of the Internet in the past few months.&nbsp; So I thought I should
at least take a look at what tools are available from a viewers perspective.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Now, there are a probably
a couple dozen projects underway for viewing video and animations on Linux.&nbsp;
I can't review all of these, there just isn't enough time in the day to
do them justice.&nbsp; So I've chosen four viewers that I think represent
varying aspects of digital video as well as varying support for different
video formats.&nbsp; The four tools are <b><font color="#993300">Xanim</font></b>
by Mark Podlipec, <b><font color="#993300">MainView</font></b> by MainConcept,
<b><font color="#993300">MpegTV</font></b>
by MpegTV, and <b><font color="#993300">RealVideo</font></b> from RealNetworks.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In order to test these I
decided to download a series of RealVideo, MPEG, and Quicktime files, both
with and without audio, and see how each tool that supports them performed.&nbsp;
For RealVideo and MpegTV, I used appropriate URLs.&nbsp; The test system
was configured with 256Mb of memory using a <a href="#truecolor">TrueColor
visual </a>under the Xi Graphics Accelerated X server with a Matrox Mystique
4Mb video card and the commercial Open Sound System drivers for a Generic
MAD16 Pro (OPTi 82C929) soundcard.&nbsp; For animation's or streaming video/audio
which were used in these tests and for which I know a URL, I have provided
links to the test files.&nbsp; I can't post the video files here since
the Linux Gazette (which is the main location for the Muse column) gets
distributed to a lot of places that wouldn't be happy downloading 2Mb+
video files.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A note about file types</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you're not familiar with
the codec types, just look for animation files with suffices like .mov
and .anim( both are versions of Quicktime, I believe), .fli (FLI/FLC),
.ram, .rm and .rv (RealVideo files), and .mpg (MPEG animation's).</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://xanim.va.pubnix.com/home.html">Xanim</a></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Latest version: 2.80.1</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Long before the others arrived
on the scene, Mark Podlipec's xanim was serving up video files to the masses.&nbsp;
Supporting AVI, Quicktime, FLI/FLC, Amiga, and JFIF file formats along
with GIF and DL Animation's as well as a number of audio formats, the X
Windows System based xanim can play just about any popular animation files
you might find on the Internet.</font></font>

</table>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Xanim is provided in source
format for the main engine, with binary dynamically loadable libraries
(DLLs) provided for various codecs for which the copyright owner would
only provide information if Mark signed an NDA.&nbsp; In a sense, I think
Mark's solution to the proprietary vs. open problem is probably not a bad
compromise.&nbsp; In any case, the source is portable to many Unix (and
other) platforms.&nbsp; Building the source is fairly easy for Linux systems.&nbsp;
Unfortunately the package doesn't support autoconf&nbsp; based compilation,
but I'm not one to complain much about that (considering my own XNotesPlus
doesn't support it either - who has time to learn all these tools?).&nbsp;
Mark provides a build based around imake, which isn't too bad a substitute
for autoconf.&nbsp; The Imakefile only needs one modification for building
on Linux - in section IVb add this line:</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>EXTRA_DEFINES = -I/usr/X11R6/include/X11</font></tt></blockquote>
<font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is necessary, even though
the Imakefile says it shouldn't be required, because Mark doesn't prefix
his use of the X header files with "X11/&lt;header file>" but the standard
imake templates assume that applications do so.&nbsp; Since Mark apparently
does his builds on Linux too, the rest of the Imakefile should probably
work just fine as it is.&nbsp; You then run "</font><tt>xmkmf; make xanim</tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"
to build the program.&nbsp; Then just copy it to an appropriate directory,
such as </font><tt>/usr/local/bin</tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">.&nbsp;
Installation, from build to running my first animation, took about 10 minutes.</font></font>
<p><font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The interface for xanim is
rather small, but it supports starting, stopping, rewinding and audio levels.&nbsp;
You can step through a video by clicking various mouse buttons in the display
window.&nbsp; Most of the options supported by xanim are accessible only
from the command line.&nbsp; You can find what options are available using
the traditional </font><tt>--help</tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica"> command
line option.&nbsp; There is a remote interface available that allows external
programs to control xanim and I believe there are GTK, TK and KDE based
front ends to xanim now, although I didn't specifically look for them.&nbsp;
Note that there is no built-in help facility to xanim.&nbsp; You'll need
to read the documentation or visit the Web site for details.&nbsp; But
for most animation's, especially on systems with TrueColor visuals (i.e.
16.7 million color displays), you simply run "</font><tt>xanim &lt;filename></tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">".&nbsp;
Pretty straight forward, really.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Xanim played all 14 of the
videos I tried with absolutely no problem.&nbsp; I tested Quicktime, MPEG,
FLI and IFF animation's.&nbsp; There was little jitter or no obviously
skipped frames and the sound was perfectly synchronized with the animation's
which came with audio (which, as it turns out, was just the Quicktime files).&nbsp;
Tests were run in both TrueColor and 256 color modes.&nbsp; Xanim had no
problems mapping the full color videos to the lower bit planes.&nbsp; In
fact, it did a better job of doing it than I could using various command
line color related options.&nbsp; By default xanim will loop through the
animation indefinitely.&nbsp; You can change this behavior using command
line options.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>By supporting dynamic loading
of video codecs, Mark has made it easier for end users to add support for
any new codecs that might come along.&nbsp; Now you can simply download
the appropriate binary codec from his site, unpack it, and restart xanim.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Recompilation is no longer necessary.&nbsp; Despite it's apparent visible
simplicity, xanim is still the best all around video player for Linux.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="http://www.mainconcept.com">MainView</a></font></b>
<br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Version 2.06</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>In trying to figure out a
topic for this month's Musings, I started to look around for video editing
software.&nbsp; I'd heard a few packages were available, but had never
tried any of them.&nbsp; One package I did run across was a new commercial
package (currently freely available as a beta distribution) from a German
company called MainConcept.&nbsp; This package included a video display
tool called MainView.</font></font>

</td>

</table>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>MainView is actually an external
viewer application to the larger MainActor Video Editing system.&nbsp;
It can, however, be run independently of MainActor.&nbsp; The interface
is even more sparse than xanim's, but doesn't appear as cramped.&nbsp;
Run time options can be accessed through a menu which you can open by right
button clicking with your mouse over the animation window.&nbsp; Options
include changing the speed of the animation and various audio options.&nbsp;
Audio, unfortunately, didn't work at all on any of the animation's I tried.&nbsp;
It always played very loud and completely distorted audio.&nbsp; I ended
up turning audio off after testing it on all the files for audio support
so I could continue testing video playback.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Video support is much better
than audio, fortunately.&nbsp; All 14 of the animation's I tried played
flawlessly under a TrueColor display.&nbsp; When I started MainView the
very first time, I noticed that it complained about requiring the XFree86
DGA (Direct Graphics Extension) extension, but still started anyway.&nbsp;
The extension, it turns out, is only needed if you want to run in full
screen mode.&nbsp; As long as you're not trying to do that, the video portion
of MainView works fairly well.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One nice feature of MainView
is that it remembers the last directory you were in between sessions.&nbsp;
I like this because I can launch MainView from my FVWM2 GoodStuff bar and
have it be in a directory where I save animation files.&nbsp; MainView
will start by providing a file browser window from which you can select
an animation to view.&nbsp; It then closes the file browser and starts
the video playback window.&nbsp; There doesn't appear to be a way to return
to the file browser, however.&nbsp; That sure would make it easier to browse
through multiple video files without having to restart MainView each time.&nbsp;
MainView also doesn't automatically loop through videos.&nbsp; In fact,
I couldn't find a way from within MainView itself to get a video to loop.&nbsp;
MainActor does allow you to set a repeat count, but not an infinite loop.</font></font>

and required by, quite a few applications in the future.&nbsp; For MpegTV,
SDL is only required to run MpegTV in full screen mode.&nbsp; One problem
I had with this was that the SDL installation tool installs the library
under /usr/local/lib by default (you can change this during the installation
process).&nbsp; MpegTV requires that the library be installed under /usr/X11R6/lib.&nbsp;
I installed the library under /usr/local/lib and added symbolic links under
/usr/X11R6/lib.&nbsp; This should have worked, but for some reason MpegTV
failed to load the libraries.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, there is nothing
wrong with the symbolic links so I suspect that the library
<b><u>must</u></b>
really be under /usr/X11R6/lib in order to work with MpegTV.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>the company's Web site offered
two test animation's, a short animation of bouncing boxes and an old Star
Wars trailer.&nbsp; Both of these played just fine.&nbsp; There is also
a link to a site with more links to MPEG animation's on the net.&nbsp;
I bounced around a few of those but couldn't find anything more interesting
than the 3 other MPEG animation's I already had.&nbsp; MpegTV played them
all just fine (if you ignore the Registration dialog problem).&nbsp; Additionally,
MpegTV can also play Video CDs, such as the video portion of music CDs.&nbsp;
It doesn't play DVD, however.&nbsp; Although my RH 5.2 system appears to
have the VCD patch applied, and xreadvcd does appear to read the video
cd contents, I couldn't get MpegTV to read the CD nor could I get xreadvcd
to write the MPEG stream to a file.&nbsp; There is something wrong with
my kernel configuration, apparently, so I couldn't really test the Video
CD support in MpegTV.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Interestingly enough, after
downloading the two test MPEG files from the MpegTV site and trying them
with mtv, I then went back and tried them with xanim.&nbsp; I couldn't
play either of them correctly with xanim.&nbsp; I then tried some of the
other mpg files I had used with xanim under mtv.&nbsp; They all played
about the same except for one - monopoly.mpg.&nbsp; Under xanim this played
rather slow, with distinct stoppage between frames.&nbsp; Under mtv this
played just fine.&nbsp; The frames flowed by seamlessly.&nbsp; So, mtv
appears to deal with MPEG files better than xanim, although mtv appears
to have some nasty bugs, at least in the unregistered version.</font></font>
<p><font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">MpegTV will play MPEG streams
direct from the Internet if you supply a URL on the command line or through
the </font><tt>Play From URL </tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">option from
the File menu in the control window.&nbsp; I tried this with one site but
found the stream to be too slow to play interactively.&nbsp; After the
20 minute download, which did play while it was being downloaded even though
it looked like only one frame every so often was playing, I tried to replay
it and save it.&nbsp; I could do neither.&nbsp; I don't know if this is
a limitation in the unregistered version or not, however.</font></font>

G2 Beta version</a></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One of my favorite tools
to be ported to Linux is the RealVideo G2 player from RealNetworks.&nbsp;
While working for Samsung in Dallas, and forced to use an NT box for email,
I got hooked watching and listening to Bloomberg TV financial reports.&nbsp;
I was able to do this only because I was stuck with that NT box (which
sat to one side and collected dust most of the time) and G2 didn't run
on my Solaris box.&nbsp; Now that I'm working from home, I'm thrilled to
be able to view this same content from my Linux box.</font></font>

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(Synchronized Multimedia Integration

</td>

<p><font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The G2 player can play any
of the streaming video and audio formats from RealNetworks.&nbsp; This
includes the older .ram and .rm audio files as well as the new Synchronized
Multimedia Integration Language - SMIL, yet another of the HTML-style formatting
languages - files, suffixed with </font><b><tt>.smi</tt></b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">.&nbsp;
It doesn't play MPEG or any of the formats the other players support, however.&nbsp;
So you need to find sites that support the RealNetworks formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Fortunately, these sites abound on the Internet.&nbsp; RealNetworks was
one of the first to provide a usable streaming media format for the Internet
and it caught on very fast.&nbsp; Many news sites support RealVideo these
days.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The Linux version is still
in beta, at least to my knowledge.&nbsp; I've had no serious problems with
it although sometimes the video window can get visual artifacts when you
switch sites.&nbsp; It also had a few problems with refreshing the video
window when another window had partially hidden the G2 player, and then
the other window was moved away.&nbsp; These problems only happened with
static parts of the video window - any animation's forced window updates
and so they appeared to work just fine.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Playing of the streams has
been pretty good.&nbsp; I think I have more problems with network delays
than with playing the streams.&nbsp; The G2 player comes with a host of
options to configure the player for best performance.&nbsp; It can work
behind firewalls if you're network administrator permits passing the right
port numbers.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The player itself is made
up of a primary video display window surrounded by associated controls.&nbsp;
The NT version includes a scrolling icon-based playlist on the left of
the video window but the Linux version lacks this currently.&nbsp; I don't
think there are any serious technical reason they can't add it in the future,
though.&nbsp; Information about the clip currently playing can be scrolled
through the Clip Info window, or this can be disabled to help increase
performance just a bit.&nbsp; The audio support is very good - RealNetworks
chose to allow skipped video frames in exchange for a fluid audio performance.&nbsp;
I find that appealing as I often just listen to the streams while doing
other work.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Streaming video is still
a jumpy affair.&nbsp; You don't get the smooth frame-by-frame animation's
you get when playing an MPEG or Quicktime file directly from your hard
disk.&nbsp; But the format does support moving anywhere within the stream
at any time.&nbsp; I can jump to the middle and pick up playing from that
point if I choose.&nbsp; Or I can rewind or start over at any point within
the currently playing stream.&nbsp; And I don't have to wait for the entire
file to download in order to do this.&nbsp; I still think streaming audio
is a better media for this technology due to general limitations in bandwidth
to the user, but once we all have higher speed connections, streaming video
will offer choices that TV and cable never could.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Other tools</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>One other player I tried
was <a href="http://www.freeyellow.com/members4/heroine/">XMovie</a>.&nbsp;
This is a program that runs off of a library built to run Quicktime movies.&nbsp;
It's part of a series of tools that include another video editor called
BCast2000.&nbsp; However, there are licensing limitations with Quicktime
that XMovie can't get around.&nbsp; I don't know if that was the reason
or not, but XMovie couldn't play any of the animation's I tried.&nbsp;
Whatever codecs it supports, it's not the ones being used in the video
files I found on the Internet.</font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Places to find video files online</font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>You can always check many
of the entertainment sites online, such as <a href="http://www.eonline.com">E!
Online</a>, and <a href="http://www.comcentral.com/download/index.shtml">Comedy
Central's</a> download site.&nbsp; Additionally, you can find clips and
links to other online sources of video files at <a href="http://www.uslink.net/~edgerton/index.html">Jesse's
Movies</a>, and <a href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Movies_and_Film/Multimedia/Video_Clips/">Yahoo!'s
set of movie clip links.</a>&nbsp; Streaming MPEG and MPEG files sites
can be found at <a href="http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/bitstreams.html">MPEG.org's
MPEG Bitstreams page</a>.&nbsp; RealVideo clips can be found at the
<a href="http://www.real.com/showcase/realplayer/index.html">RealVideo
Showcase</a> site and a their <a href="http://realguide.real.com/">Real
Guide</a> site.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Keep in mind that playing
movies like this doesn't require huge amounts of hardware - a 32Mb Pentium
133 should work just fine, although some animation's may play a little
slow and audio might not sync all that well.&nbsp; But you certainly don't
need the 256Mb of memory I used, nor do you need the latest CPU.&nbsp;
And you certainly don't need a 3D accelerated video card.&nbsp; These animation's
are basically all just a series of individual raster images played very
fast.&nbsp; It's like using a flip book of pictures - the faster you can
flip through the pages, the faster the animation appears to work.&nbsp;
Except on computers and with the right player, you have more control over
the speed.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I have to admit, I'm still
a big fan of xanim over any of the other players I've tried.&nbsp; For
95% of the animation's out there it's just the right tool for the job.&nbsp;
But it doesn't, to my knowledge, support streaming video/audio.&nbsp; Since
I don't have cable television anymore (what a waste of money that is),
I get my news and information online.&nbsp; I find myself listening and
even watching streaming audio and video with RealVideo quite often these
days.&nbsp; Since the information streams, I can leave it running while
I work and just listen to the bits and pieces of what ever interests me.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Like whether or not my shares
of Disney are ever going to go back into positive territory.&nbsp; Maybe
if they released all their films as streaming MPEGs....</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Since I've always been a
fan of visual media, I find the opportunity to build my own webcasts rather
enticing.&nbsp; Streaming video and audio are the best future for online
video because they don't require the user to download the entire file to
play it.&nbsp; At some point in the future, I hope to be able to put together
some live interviews for webcasting, but I have to investigate what that
will cost and where it can be hosted.&nbsp; In the mean time, at least
I have the right tools to view other webcasts and online video.</font></font>
