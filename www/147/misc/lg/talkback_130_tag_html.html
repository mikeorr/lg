Ben, 
</p>

<p>
I had to edit a file to add myself to the folks including cups who
could use your ben@Fenrir:~# head -60 /usr/share/dict/words &gt; /dev/lp0
to get the printer going?  Where and what was that file.  I've looked
back at article 130 and am not able to see it.  
</p>

<p>
Regards Plain text Ian.
</p>

I'm not sure what you mean, Ian; simply dumping text to a device doesn't
require editing any files. You may need to confirm permissions and
ownership for the device, like so:
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ ls -l /dev/lp0
crw-rw---- 1 root lp 6, 0 2007-12-15 21:16 /dev/lp0
ben@Tyr:~$ groups
ben adm mail dialout cdrom floppy lp audio dip video plugdev
</pre>
The device, in the above case, has owner/group set to 'root' and 'lp' -
just what I'd expect - and permissions set to "read/write" for owner and
group. When I check the list of groups to which I belong, it includes
'lp' - which means that I have access to the device. That's all that's
necessary.
