<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif"> Bob Hepple </H4>
<A HREF="mailto:bhepple@pacific.net.sg">Bob Hepple</A> has been hacking at Unix 
since 1981
under a variety of excuses and has somehow been paid for it
at least some of the time. It's allowed him to pursue
another interest - living in warm, exotic countries
including Hong Kong, Australia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Lesotho
and (presently) Singapore. His initial aversion to the cold
was learned in the UK. Ambition - to stop working for the
credit card company and taxman and to get a real job - doing
this, of course!

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this month's issue!
<p>
I'm very excited to edit the Linux Gazette for October.
<br>
At my last job, where I fixed computers for a big
company, I was talking with a woman about life in general 
while fixing her computer, and suddenly she blurted: 
"Oh my God!  You're really a computer geek!"  
She immediately apologized and explained that she didn't
mean any offense, even though I had a huge smile on my face 
and was trying to explain that I appreciated the compliment.
<p>
After many experiences like that, working with
SSC has been a welcome change.  And since Linux Gazette is one of
the places where geeks come home to roost, I'm happy to be a part of it.
<p>
I just came back from the <a href="http://www.systers.org/hopper">
Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing</a>,
which was held in San Jose, California this year.  To quote Bill and Ted,
it was totally awesome!  I got to meet the illustrious Anita Borg, the 
amazing Ruzena Bajcny, and the inspiring Fran Allen from IBM, as well
as many many many others who came from all over the country, and from dozens
of countries from around the world.  It was the most incredible even that I have
ever attended, and I encourage everyone to go to the next one which
will be in the year 2000. 
<p>
Margie Richardson will return next month as Editor-In-Chief, and I'll be helping out on the sidelines.  I'm really glad that I got the chance to be the Big Cheese for a month. :)  <br>
Keep sending those articles to <a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net">gazette@linuxgazette.net</a>!
<p>
Until next month, keep reading and keep hacking!
