<P> <HR> 
<p>After I finish these Gazette articles and get them uploaded to SSC,
I can usually count on a URL changing or a newer version of a program being
released.  Sometimes that very day!  The Gazette readers are also quick to let
me know of any factual errors I've made.  I've accumulated
several of these corrections and updates and shall present them here.

<center><h3>GV</h3></center>

<p>Last month I wrote a short piece about GV, a new Postscript file viewer.
I received a letter from the maintainer of the Debian GV package:<br><pre>

       Hello Larry!

       I enjoyed reading your article, but there are two remarks I want to
       make:

       - Your screen capture is one of the one modified gv that works with
       all Athena Widgets, including the standard one. These modifications
       were made by me (although it wasn't very hard once I realized how
       well Johannes separated the Xaw3d stuff from the rest).
       It would have been better to have a screen capture using libXaw3d, as
       that is the standard look and feel. The last statement about having
       to have Xaw3d is not very convincing this way.
      - There is a gv homepage now:
                   <a href="http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/">
                    http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/</a>

      This page currently features gv version 3, which can no longer be
       used without libXaw3d. The last version of gv supporting standard
       Xaw was 2.9.4 which will soon be available on a debian archive site.
       Version 3 is even better than version 2 with respect to look and feel
       (one of the first really convincing applications using Xaw3d, IMO)
       and an improved postscript scanner.

      While I'm sure that it isn't possible to change/add to the article,
      there could be a short notice in the next gazette.

              Helmut

<center><h3>FileRunner</h3></center>

<p>FileRunner has been updated several times since I reviewed it several
months ago.  The latest version, 2.3, has improved FTP capabilities (including
the option of downloading files with a separate background process).  I must
confess I'm addicted to this file-manager.  Once you get the hang of it file
manipulation and directory traversals become so speedy that using it as
<b>root</b> can be risky!  Check the <a
href="http://www.cd.chalmers.se/~hch/filerunner.html"> FileRunner WWW
site</a> for latest releases and news.

<p>Here's an example of a user-configured action-button for FileRunner, which
will mostly interest XEmacs users (though it could probably be adapted easily
for use with GNU Emacs).  Create a file in the <b>~/.fr</b> directory named
<b>cmds</b>,  then enter this text into it:<pre><code>

# This is an example of user-defined commands. This file should be named
# cmds and placed in your ~/.fr directory. It will then be read by 
# FileRunner at startup.  Versions of FileRunner prior to 2.3 need to have
#the file named .fr_cmds and placed directly in the home directory.

# This list should contain all user-defined commands formatted as:
# { { &lt;button-title&gt; &lt;procedure-name&gt; } {..} {..} }
set config(usercommands) { 
    { XEmacs xemacs }
 }
#
proc xemacs { filelist srcdir destdir } {
  cd $srcdir
#  set l {}
  foreach f $filelist {
  exec gnuclient -q $f
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>For this to work, you must have <i>gnuserv</i> running; this can be started
from your <i>~/.xemacs-options</i> file by including the line<br>
<code>(gnuserv-start)</code><br> in the file. What this button does is send
the files you've selected to an already-running XEmacs process (I usually have
one running in a different virtual desktop than the one FileRunner is using).
XEmacs will then open up a new frame in your current desktop with the file(s)
displayed in it.  This is handy for browsing source code.

<center><h3>wm2 and wmx </h3></center>

<p>In LG #14 I wrote about the minimalist window-manager wm2, written by
British programmer Chris Cannam.  Since then wm2 has spawned a variant, known
as wmx.  Evidently Mr. Cannam felt that spartan wm2 was becoming decadently
featureful.  Wm2 was stripped down to the bare minimum; no more
frame-background pixmaps,etc.  Wmx is just wm2 with the afore-mentioned
pixmaps and a basic virtual-desktop utility.  It has one more feature which I
thought was very cleverly designed: if you click the middle mouse button on
the desktop an application menu appears.  Unlike most window-managers, the
entries on the menu are a snap to set up.  Simply create a subdirectory
stemming from your home directory called <i>.wmx</i> and symlink executables
to it.  This can be even done while wmx is running.  Whatever appears in
<i>~/.wmx</i> will appear in the menu.  The menu can be configured with a
transparent background so that it has a very stylish and spare appearance.  As
with wm2 the configuration can only be changed by recompiling, but this can be
done very quickly as the source is not large or complex.  Source for either
wm2 or wmx can be obtained from 
<a href="http://www.netcomuk.co.uk/~cannam/wm2.html">
the wm2 web-site.</a>

<center><h3>Afterstep</h3></center>

<p>A reader pointed out an error in my description of the Afterstep
window-manager in LG #14.  Rather than being based on Fvwm2 code, Afterstep is 
based on Fvwm version 1 code.  Incidentally, pre-release 6 has been released
and is well worth a trial.  Several bugs have been fixed but the improved
documentation alone makes it worth the download. 

<center><h3>Xvile</h3></center>

<p>Lately it seems that a fad is sweeping the insular world of vi-like
editors.   First the X versions of Elvis and Vim appeared with
pull-down menus; now it appears that Xvile will soon have a menubar as well.      
If <b>a:</b> you like vile/xvile and <b>b:</b> you have the Motif libs
installed, you may want to take a look at the patches for vile 7.00 available
from the <a href="ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/vile/patches">Vile ftp site.</a>
The patches A through G need to be applied to the vile 7.0 source.  It looks
like the menu items will be fairly easy to set up, as they make use of the
standard vile functions.  An implementation for non-Motif X setups is
planned.  

<p>I have mixed feelings about GUI conveniences such as menus in a vi editor.
One of the appealing traits of these editors is the lack of such visible
features combined with a wide array of invisible and powerful commands.
Little overhead but great power and speed.  If you have to reach for the mouse 
and select a menu-item, why not use Nedit (for example) which is designed as a 
mouse-oriented editor?  On the other hand, how many users have had an
unpleasant first-time experience with vi and rejected it forever?  At 
least the menubar will have a "quit-ZZ" item, allowing a novice to end a
first session without having to desperately flee to another virtual console
and kill the vi process from afar! 

<center><h3>TkDesk</h3></center>

<p>The latest version of this versatile desktop/file manager can be found at
<a href="http://sun1.rrzn-user.uni-hannover.de/~zzhibol/tkdesk">the TkDesk home site.</a> Version 1.0b4 has been released and many
minor bugs have been fixed.  There are three patches available on the web-site 
which should be applied by users of the program.  Two of them are changes to
<i>*.tcl</i> files, whereas the third is a c-source-level change which
requires recompilation.  Debian users can instead install a patched TkDesk
package which is available from the <i>/bo/binary-i386/x11</i> directory of
ftp.debian.org and its mirrors.

<center><h3>The Midnight Commander</h3></center>

<p>For the past several months a beta development cycle has been underway in
preparation for the release of mc-3.1.5.  The recent releases (the latest as
of this writing is patchlevel 25) have been very stable and usable.  If you
use the Midnight Commander frequently it might be worth your while to try the
new version, as many improvements have been made.

<p>An internal editor has been incorporated into mc, though you still can
change the settings and use any console-mode external editor.  The FTP
capabilities of mc have been augmented and the Tk version has made great
strides and needs just a few more features to be the equal of the
classic console version.  mc now has the ability to dive into <i>*.rpm</i> and 
<i>*.deb</i> files in the same manner it has been able to do with <i>*.tgz</i> 
and <i>*.zip</i> files, allowing you to inspect their contents without
unpacking the archives.

<p>It's only available in source form, but it comes with a good configure script
and compiles easily here.  The source is available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/Midnight/devel">the mc home site</a>.

<center><h3>XEmacs Update</h3></center>

<p>Last month I wrote about the release of XEmacs 19.15.  The XEmacs team
didn't stop and rest on their laurels (probably because some unexpected
problems showed up after the release!);  beta releases of XEmacs 20.1 began
showing up about twice a week at <b>ftp.xemacs.org</b>.  It looked as if
version 20.1 was about to be released, but for some reason the release was
cancelled and they moved on to betas of 20.2.  I'm running beta 2 now,
and have found that several small problems with 19.15 have been fixed.  The
Customization utility works quite a bit better now, for one.  When 20.2 is
released I would recommend obtaining it, as it looks like it will be an
improvement over 19.15.  Another approach if you've already installed 19.15 is 
to visit <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/xemacs-19.15-patches/patch-page.html">
the XEmacs patches page</a>, which offers patches to upgrade 19.15 to
patchlevel 2.  The problems dealt with are described on the page; if the
patches concern modes or utilities you never use, there's no point in applying them.
