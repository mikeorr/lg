Hi Tag, 
</p>

<p>
I am currently running Fedora 11 on my Laptop and have run into some problem. My Laptop has been spewing random errors on boot up, displaying the following 
"crc error kernel panic - not Syncing VFS unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0,0). 
The boot process fails at this point. 
Following this, i tried to boot the Laptop using a Linux Dvd and run into the following roadblock. The error message displayed is " RAMDISK:  incomplete write  (13513 != 32768) write error 
Kernel Panic - not Syncing: VFS : unable to mount root fs on unknown block (0, 0). 
Has anyone experienced a similar problem. Kindly assist on how i can recover from the error. Thanks in advance. 
</p>

<p>
Regards,    
</p>

Do you have a separate /boot partition? What does ls -alh /boot say, if 
that's the case? df -ah?

Hi Tag,
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough the laptop has finally booted without the ?kernel panic
error?. Prior to this, I had run out of space and decided to free up some
4GB of disk space.
Anyone with prior experience to the root cause of such problems and
possible solutions, kindly gibe me some pointers.
As for Aioanei, I could not run any commands but will check them out.

Hi,
  Really strange that both the livedvd and the hard disk gave the same error and even more strange that the error went away alone.Perhaps is an spurious error, if that's it, think of it as a warning of something failing in the hardware. I had I/O errors before my hard disk died.

This is perhaps not the most cheerful news, but whenever I see errors of
that sort - and doubly so when they're intermittent - I always suspect
hardware. Testing your HD (and perhaps your memory while you're at it)
would not be a bad idea.

Thanks for that.
Lastly, the system has been alternating between these two errors ""crc
error kernel panic - not Syncing VFS unable to mount root fs on 
unknown block (0,0)." and "CRC Error - System Halted".
The laptop is barely a year old, so I would love to rule out a physical
hardware error. 
This errors only began a few days ago after I ran out of space on my hdd
and decided to free up some space, "I deleted lots of files". 
Any nice tools out there that can scan  the disk for inconsistencies and
also probably do a de-fragmentation on Linux?

You might want to try temporarily plugging in another HDD, just as a
test. Swapping SIMMs can also be a pretty good diagnostic.

<p>
Linux filesystems don't work like that; files don't really get
fragmented in the first place, so no defragging is ever needed.

<p>
If you get the same or similar errors whether you boot from HDD or
DVD, then either 
</p>

<p>
	you are not achieving what you think you are achieving
or
	you have a problem outside both those devices
</p>

<p>
Yes, you HDD may be broken, but IMO you need to step back and look
earlier in the boot process for the problem.
</p>

<p>
Exchanging hardware as Ben suggested will give you more data points;
since this is starting to look like hardware, it may also mask the
problem or make it go away.
</p>

<p>
My first thought was memory.
</p>

<p>
I would start by trying to get into the BIOS. I can't remember if a
BIOS has any tests built into it.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if the laptop is under a year old, is it still under
warranty? It might be worth getting the supplier to look at it.
</p>

<p>
Other things to try:
</p>

<p>
	other live dvds/cd (I find Knoppix excellent)
	on a time when it boots, try to run the memory tests
		(memtest86)
	if you are comfortable opening up, reseat memory, etc
</p>
