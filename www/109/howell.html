<h1>SuSE Linux 9.2 - An Early Evaluation</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Early in October SuSE's latest was released but it was the very
last weekend of October when I finally had the time to check it
out. In a word: <strong>nice</strong>.</p>

<p>Not wanting to endanger a functional system, the first install
was to a second drive that I let SuSE partition. After that worked,
I updated 9.0 on the big drive. Other than the problems you expect
when a boot loader on the other drive gets in the way of an
installation procedure that wants to reboot in the middle of the
installation process, things went extremely smoothly.</p>

<h3>A Clean Install</h3>

<p>It didn't take even an hour to install to the drive turned over
to SuSE - about 10 minutes of answering questions with the mouse
and then the usual inserting and removing of CDs. By pretty much
just taking the defaults and only getting picky when it really made
a difference (like the hostname), SuSE's installation procedure
produced a very usable system.</p>

<p>The swap file was 500+ MB, about the size of RAM. Less than 2 GB
of the rest was used for the installed software, leaving over 1.5
GB available. This was basically what I have come to know as SuSE's
standard office system: KDE with Open Office and, of course,
Konqueror.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>

<p>SuSE 9.2 has 5 CDs and 2 DVDs, one of which contains the source
RPMs.</p>

<p>Firefox is something I had wanted to look at. And there it was!
Hmmm, so now how am I going to check it out?</p>

<p>Although my wife uses a PC at work, she is about as interested
in computers as I am in cars; they're both just tools, really. She
puts up with the former as I do with the latter. So she wanted to
spend some time on the Internet. Did she ever! Kept asking
questions, but they had nothing to do with Firefox: What was that
URL? What do you think of this hotel?</p>

<p>If the word "intuitive" still has any meaning left at all, it
can be applied to Firefox. I played with it a bit and it could well
become my surfing platform of choice. But where's the e-mail
plug-in? Oh, did SuSE jump the gun on release 1?</p>

<p>Some of what SuSE automatically installs I found unnecessary and
so removed - e.g., things like the dictionaries (I prefer to accept
responsibility for my spelling mistakes) - but I added Mozilla, the
e-mail plugin and, of course, Firefox. Still, the standard
installation should be great for most situations, like a small
office or home computer. And SuSE's YaST makes adding or removing
individual pieces of software extremely convenient.</p>

<p>I've been very happy with Open Office since the Star Office days
(even paid Sun real money for the 5.1 CD to be able to install it
under Win 95, OS/2 and GNU/Linux). Compatibility of data remains
something to consider if it is necessary to exchange diskettes, USB
sticks, or the like with friends or customers. But for many years I
have relied on Open Office for all correspondence and a number of
spreadsheets.</p>

<p>Migration away from some other environment is a completely
different topic, but the software included in SuSE 9.2 should fill
the bill for anyone needing a machine to deal with typical small
office tasks.</p>

<h3>The Update</h3>

<p>The 4 GB install performed so well right off the starting blocks
that I decided to go ahead and update the 80 GB drive. This was
something I had never done before. Somehow a clean install had
always seemed best. But so many settings have been tweaked that I
decided to try it out.</p>

<p>Updating was a very pleasant surprise, not a lot of questions
and pretty straight-forward (however, see <a href="#batch">"Batch"
Install</a>, below). Worked like a charm. I'm a believer. Of
course, the step from 9.0 to 9.2 isn't too great. Would it have
worked as well starting at, say, 8.1?</p>

<p>I did encounter problems with a conflict between the UIDs on the
partition updated when I did a soft link from there to the Mozilla
mailbox on the clean install - from one hard drive to another.
Procmail had trouble delivering and and put a few items in the
default mailbox. Under 9.2 SuSE starts user IDs at 1000, used to be
500. Not a problem if you either don't update or do assign user
IDs. Or just avoid linking to data outside of the partition!</p>

<p>On the other hand, NFS is (or was) supposed to be sensitive to
UID problems. There was no trouble accessing either version from
another machine via NFS. Although it does let you override IDs, it
was so easy to set up that I honestly don't recall whether I even
bothered to do that.</p>

<h3>Caveat</h3>

<p>Installing an operating system on a brand-new machine without
any data on it is nothing to get excited about. But nobody wants to
start learning about partitioning and differences in drive names
between operating system and boot-loader right in the middle of
installation! Are you really sure you know where that MBR was
put?</p>

<p>I will no longer have any hesitation about recommending
GNU/Linux as an alternative to anything else on the desktop. But
the process of how it gets there remains significant. In my opinion
it would be very bad advice to suggest that anyone without
considerable experience should install this on a machine that
already has an operating system and data on it. During installation
and without access to partition contents it is just too easy to do
something with the wrong partition!</p>

<h3>Additional Work</h3>

<p>Setting up the HP Printer under YaST was much like former
experience with installing drivers for other operating systems:
answer a couple of questions about model etc. and maybe print a
test page. Pretty straight-forward. However, see <a href=
"#cups">Printing with CUPS</a>, below. I wonder if the USB Lexmark
will be as successful when I do a clean install on the AMD
notebook.</p>

<p>Even in small offices, it is more and more the case that there
are several computers connected to each other. It is no particular
problem to set this up but it of course increases the time required
for installation accordingly. However, networking is a topic in its
own right. And clearly, no default installation can automatically
be made part of an existing network. To install SuSE 9.2 on a
machine that needs to be networked requires a bit more effort. But
then, if you already have a network, you know your topology, IP
addresses, host names, etc. And given this knowledge, it is not
particularly difficult to integrate the machine into the current
network. Just takes a little bit more time.</p>

<p>In point of fact, it took very little time to set up networking.
YaST asks the right questions but the answers won't necessarily be
obvious to anyone unfamiliar with networking. I assume Samba works
as in the past but haven't investigated it yet because I rarely
have an operating system running that requires it. Note, however,
that this network is so small that I just edit /etc/hosts et
al.</p>

<h3>Progress</h3>

<p>With every new release of any software there are improvements,
some only of cosmetic nature. But there were several things that
struck me as worth pointing out.</p>

<h3>mount</h3>

<p>Tired of having to mount removable devices? That's past tense.
It didn't take long to get used to not trying to mount something.
That command seems only to be needed for hard-drives or partitions
that aren't automatically mounted via /etc/fstab. But there are
differences between floppy, CD-ROM and USB.</p>

<h4>Floppy</h4>

<p>Insert a floppy and not much happens. Without mounting anything
the command "ls /media/floppy" shows its contents. However, if you
do try to mount it, you get a message that mtab shows it to be
mounted.</p>

<h4>CD-ROM</h4>

<p>CD-ROM is similar but different. Insert one and the drive reacts
(in fact KDE announces it as well). An attempt to mount it produces
the same reaction as with the floppy. Same with ls. Interesting is
that if the drawer is still open, ls closes it for you.</p>

<h4>USB</h4>

<p>USB is something completely different. My impression is that it
is treated as a removable hard-drive. Plug in a USB stick and KDE
tells you it's there and offers to show you the contents of the
directory.</p>

<p>The command "ls /media" will show you the name of the
newly-available directory. But given the directory name, e.g.
"/media/usb-07480C81059A:0:0:0p1", you may want cut-and-paste with
the left and middle keys on the mouse.</p>

<p>On the other hand you might just want to try the following,
which I fetched via cut-and-paste. Believe me, as bizarre as the cd
command may appear, it works!</p>

<p class="editorial">[ The "cd" command in Unix has always been
fine with wildcards, at least in the years that I've been using it.
Using the completion feature in the modern shells - i.e., typing
"cd /media/u" and pressing the Tab key - would work just as well.

<pre>
        web@LohgoPC2:~&gt; ls /media
        cdrecorder  dvd     sda1  sdc1  sde1  sdg1
        cdrom       floppy  sdb1  sdd1  sdf1  usb-07480C81059A:0:0:0p1
        web@LohgoPC2:~&gt; cd /media/usb*
        web@LohgoPC2:/media/usb-07480C81059A:0:0:0p1&gt;
</pre>

<p>Midnight Commander also shows the directory name in full and
permits easy copying of something but of course no
cut-and-paste.</p>

<p>And Open Office just uses it as one would expect. For what it's
worth, I wrote this article using Open Office (which handles HTML
well) with the file on a USB stick, no problem.</p>

<p>As best I can tell, the output to USB is not deferred, no need
for sync. When told to write, both Open Office and vi (my all-time
favorite word processor) cause the LED on the USB stick to
flicker.</p>

<h3><a name="batch" id="batch">"Batch" Install</a>
</h3>

<p>Another really big item for me is the ability within YaST to
write to a file (user.sel) information on what was just selected
for installation. For several years I have wanted something like
this to make sure that, for example, PC and notebook have the same
software. This works so well that in fact the update even had the
same two error messages as the install because I had deleted
something needed later (not dependencies, xinit and some kernel
module). Nonetheless, potentially a real time-saver.</p>

<p>Actually that has been there for quite a while but I just hadn't
found it. Under 8.0 in YaST when you install software, if you click
on the right-most box (Extras) in the next-to-the-bottom line, the
first line of the pop-up is an option to save or load settings.
Well hidden. Under 9.2 this function is under 'File' on the top
line of the window.</p>

<h3>On-Line Update</h3>

<p>SuSE's YOU - YaST Online Update - was impressive. In 5 minutes
with a 56k modem several pieces of software were updated online.
And this release hadn't even been available for anywhere near 3
weeks at the time I did this! There was a patch for tiff, so I
assume that problem has been taken care of. I think I'm going to be
checking in there regularly in the future.</p>

<p>Prior to this update /var/lib/YaST2/you/ was empty. Afterwards,
this is what it looked like:</p>

</pre>

<p>The reference to "Delta" means that SuSE doesn't download the
entire RPM, only what is needed to provide changes since the
previous version.</p>

<h3><a name="cups" id="cups">Printing with CUPS</a>
</h3>

<p>Something that really blew me away is that CUPS does magic with
the old HP Office Jet 500. That thing is so old and has been
printing such GDI poor quality for several years that I only use it
as a fax and to make copies where the print quality isn't
particularly important. The last color cartridge was just to keep
it functional, never even try to print in color on it anymore.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is printed output from Linux! Not the quality
wanted for correspondence or anything leaving the office, but that
isn't there anyhow. And it does lose a line of data with page
eject. But with this printer that is still very impressive progress
on the proprietary printer front.</p>

<h3>Open Office</h3>

<p>I really like the fact that Open Office is - albeit slowly -
outgrowing its origins. Suddenly there are two, count'em, scroll
arrows for up and down right next to each other, one above the
other, just like on the Zaurus and most of what I use regularly.
The other up arrow is way up there, if you happen to need it.</p>

<h3>Complaints?</h3>

<p>I wish SuSE had included 'mailfilter' like back in the good, old
8.0 days. The version that I use wants a different libc. And
compilation fails because a header is missing. Did I omit something
from the development package? Most of it, actually... Problem
resolved, but on my wish-list.</p>

<p>Although I kind of like the way removable devices are handled,
there remains a gap: mount (or cat /etc/mtab) now shows what is
available, not whether anything is there; df shows USB but not e.g.
floppy. So we don't really have any way of knowing what media
currently are present. Yeah, I hear you, just look at the
drive!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>So SuSE 9.2 is a system that is extremely easy to install, at
least to an empty machine. It updates a prior version very well.
Adding and removing software packages is essentially a no-brainer.
It now deals with removable media as many people expect, including
USB. Printer support has improved dramatically, although
proprietary anything does remain problematic. And it has the
stability only available from GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>SuSE 9.2 is ready for the desktop.</p>
