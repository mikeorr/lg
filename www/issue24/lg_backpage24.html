Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
Margie and I had a great Christmas break in Houston, Texas, where much of
her family lives. Besides visiting with family and numerous friends we got
to tour the Cockrell butterfly habitat, which was very pretty. Mostly sunny
days and highs in the 60s made it tough to return to the middle of a
Seattle winter, but we managed.
<p>
Have fun!
