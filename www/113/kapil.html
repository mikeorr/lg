<h1>Roll your Desktop into a USB stick/CD</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> Here is a short course (with some excursions) to help you take your
existing Desktop, roll it into an ISO pipe and smoke a USB stick or CD.
This is not a task for the faint-hearted - there are no automated scripts
in here!

<p> Part of the reason for this hands-on approach is that each desktop
system will have its own quirks, so writing scripts which handle the
various conditions which might arise is painful. Secondly, there are
numerous choices possible - you must mix your own. Finally, I must confess
that I do not feel energetic enough to write the scripts at this point.
Instead, you have this article!

<p> So if you have spent a lot of time fine-tuning your configuration and want
to waste some more time putting it onto a (re)movable drive - read on.

<h3>Making a read-only root filesystem</h3>

<p> Since the chosen medium for our ``live'' portable system is a CD or
USB stick we do not want to write to it often. In fact, in the case
of a CD-R we can only write to it once. It should be obvious, however,
that a ``live'' system <em>does</em> need to write <em>something</em> if it is
to be counted as among the living!

<p> While many mechanisms have been suggested to handle this, <em>we</em>
will (essentially) follow the system chosen by <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/bootcd"><tt>bootcd</tt></a>. To do this,
we need to create a directory <code>/wraith</code>, an archive
<code>/wraith.cpio.gz</code> and a script <a
href="misc/kapil/undead.sh.txt">/etc/rcS.d/S01undead.sh</a>.

<p> The contents of the archive are rather system specific so <em>you</em>
will need to choose its contents. However, if you are <em>really,
really</em> impatient you can download the
<a href="misc/kapil/wraith.lst.txt">listing</a>
of the archive that I use and run the following:

<pre class="code">
 cd /
 cat wraith.lst | cpio -o -H crc | gzip -c -9 &gt; /wraith.cpio.gz
</pre>

Did you get a lot of error messages? No? Are you <em>really</em> sure
that your system is almost identical to mine? Yes? Then you can skip
the next subsection.


<h3>Choices, choices...</h3>

<p> How does one find out what files need to be written to on a live system?
One way would be to <code>find</code> all the files that <em>have</em> been written
to on your current desktop. To do this first find out when the system was
booted - a good measure of this is when the root filesystem was last mounted.
So for example

<pre class="code">
 # Use your real root device in place of /dev/root.
 last_boot_time=$(dumpe2fs -h /dev/root | \
  sed -n -e's/Last mount time: * //p')
</pre>

You may wish to use the log files or the <code>last</code> command instead.
You only need to know the last boot time approximately; subtract a minute
or so from it just to be on the safe side - unless you boot the system
more often than that! Now create a file with that time stamp using the
<code>touch</code> command:

<pre class="code">
 touch -d "$last_boot_time" /tmp/lastboot
</pre>

You can now create the list of all files that were modified since that
last boot (for simplicity we will only bother with the directories
<code>/etc</code> and <code>/var</code>; you can add some other directories if
you so desire):

<pre class="code">
 find /etc /var -newer /tmp/lastboot &gt; /tmp/changed
 # And, just for fun...
 find /home -newer /tmp/lastboot &gt; /tmp/home_changed
</pre>

Have a look at these lists but don't delete them just yet. You should notice
that there are three types of files that are written to on a running
system.

<ul>
<li> Files that are automatically written to but can be empty at the
start like log files or the <code>mozilla</code> cache directories.
<li> Files that have information which we may want
to change but rarely. Most configuration files fall into this category.
<li> Automatically generated databases of system information. Since
our system is going to be ``static'' we actually do not want the
system to update these databases. Thumb-rule: If the file is large in
size it probably belongs here!
</ul>

We will split up our list, <code>/tmp/changed</code>, according to this
classification: <code>/tmp/write</code> will consist of those files (mostly
directories) that are empty at boot time but get written to as the system
runs; <code>/tmp/links</code> will consist of the files that will be
quasi-static - we will keep a static version of these files at boot time
but we might want to change them on a running system. We will include the
third category of files in <code>/tmp/links</code> as well, since we will not
treat them differently - but ultimately you may want to change this.

<p> We first create a directory to hold the files that will be modifiable
at run-time - say <code>/wraith</code>. Mount a RAM-based file system on it
by <code>mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /wraith</code>. <strong>Big Fat
Warning</strong>: This file system is ephemeral and will be <em>lost</em>
when you halt the system. If you wish, you can use the directory as-is
(without the <code>tmpfs</code> mount) during this subsection, but don't
forget to clean up its contents once you have created the archive as
explained below.

<p> In <code>/wraith</code>, we will create the top-level directories like
<code>etc</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>tmp</code> and so on that we will
want to write to. In these directories we will create the files as per the
classification above.  First, we'll do the writable but empty files:

<pre class="code">
 cd /
 cat /tmp/write | cpio -pdum /wraith
</pre>

We expect these files to be empty at start-up so we will ``zero''
them. Do this only to the files for which you don't want to keep the
contents. For now I assume these are all the files in the list
<code>/tmp/write</code>:

<pre class="code">
 for file in $(cat /tmp/write)
 do
  if [ -f $file ]
  then
   &gt; /wraith/$file
  fi
 done
</pre>

Of course, we also need an empty <code>tmp</code> directory:

<pre class="code">
 mkdir /wraith/tmp
 chmod 1777 /wraith/tmp
</pre>

Next, we create the links.

<pre class="code">
 cd /
 for i in $(cat /tmp/links)
 do
  dir=$(dirname $i)
  top=$(echo $dir | cut -f2 -d'/')
  rest=$(echo $dir | cut -f3- -d'/')
  name=$(basename $i)
  mkdir -p /wraith/$dir
  ln -s /wraith/$top.ro/$rest/$name /wraith/$i
 done
 # As a safety measure to ensure that all configuration files
 # have been created
 mkdir -p /wraith/etc
 cd /etc
 for i in *
 do
  ln -s /wraith/etc.ro/$i /wraith/etc/$i
 done
</pre>

This is more complicated and needs further explanation. The idea is to
make the ``static'' versions of the files available under the <code>.ro</code>
top-level directories. So, for example <code>/wraith/etc/hostname</code> will be
a link to <code>/wraith/etc.ro/hostname</code>.

<p> To see this at work create <code>etc.ro</code> and <code>var.ro</code> as
sub-directories in <code>/wraith</code>. For each of these directories (say <code>etc</code>)
we run a pair of commands like the following. (Warning: Be careful here. If
you haven't created all the links in <code>/wraith/etc</code> as above you may crash
your running system).

<pre class="code">
 mount --bind /etc /wraith/etc.ro
 mount --bind /wraith/etc /etc
</pre>

After these mounts, the file <code>/etc/hostname</code> is a link to
the original <code>hostname</code> file which is now available as
<code>/wraith/etc.ro/hostname</code>. Since the left-half of this
link is on the RAM disk we can perform replacement surgery on it:

<pre class="code">
 vi /etc/hostname.new
 mv /etc/hostname.new /etc/hostname
</pre>

On the other hand, if you want to change a file in a sub-directory of
<code>/etc</code>, it's a little more complicated:

<pre class="code">
 mkdir /etc/X11.new
 ln -s /ram/etc.ro/etc/X11/* /etc/X11.new
 mv /etc/X11.new /etc/X11
</pre>

After this you can edit the files in <code>/etc/X11</code>. Yes, this is quite
twisted but (once you get the hang of it) not difficult to
manage - especially since we expect that we will edit these files
only rarely. An alternate approach is to create the directory tree under
<code>/etc</code> in its entirety only leaving links to the files. 

<p> You <em>can</em> use the above mounts to test your choices of
<code>/tmp/links</code> and <code>/tmp/write</code>, but the real test will
come later. For now, undo the above mounts by a pair of commands like:

<pre class="code">
 umount /etc
 umount /wraith/etc.ro
</pre>

You can also remove the <code>.ro</code> directories if you like.
Finally, we create an archive of this directory:

<pre class="code">
 cd /wraith
 find . -xdev | cpio -o -H crc | gzip -c -9 &gt; /wraith.cpio.gz
</pre>

The <code>cpio</code> command will tell you how many 512-byte blocks you
wrote. If the archive is really large (more than 1MB or so) then you
probably need to re-do your choices.


<h3>Bringing the wraith to life</h3>

<p> We need a mechanism to bring the <code>/wraith</code> directory into
operation at boot time.  To do this, install a script like the following
one to run early at boot time. For example you could install the script as
<code>/etc/rcS.d/S01undead.sh</code>.

<pre class="code">
 #
 
 # undead.sh Mount and load up the /wraith directory for use
 #
 # Version: 0.3  01-Feb-2005  
 #

 # If this has already been run then don't run it again.
 # We can't handle two wraiths!
 [ -f /wraith/live ] &amp;&amp; exit 0

 # Create writable space
 mount -n -t tmpfs tmpfs /wraith


 # Create the directory structure
 cd /wraith
 gzip -dc /wraith.cpio.gz | cpio -idum
 cd /

 # Perform the cross mounts with bind
 # which is like a directory hard link.
 cd /wraith
 for i in *
 do
  mkdir $i.ro
  # We use mount with the -n
  # To avoid confusing the mtab
  mount -n --bind /$i /wraith/$i.ro
  mount -n --bind /wraith/$i /$i
 done
 cd /

touch /wraith/live

: exit 
</pre>

Finally, you edit <code>/etc/fstab</code> so that the root filesystem is
mounted read-only at the next boot - just change <code>defaults</code> to
read <code>ro,defaults</code> in the appropriate entry.


<h3>Don't stop just yet</h3>

<p> Reboot and that's it! You have a read-only root system... or
almost. Actually, it is likely that you will find a number of places where
you didn't create the links you need or created the wrong links. Don't
worry. You can modify the <code>/wraith.cpio.gz</code> archive to your heart's content.
Make the changes you need to the ``live'' <code>/wraith</code> directory.
Now copy all the changes from <code>/wraith</code> into <code>/tmp/ghost</code>. The command

<pre class="code">
 cd /wraith
 find . -xdev | grep -E -v '^./((live)|([^/]*\.ro))' &gt; /tmp/list
</pre>

will generate the newer list of files. You can unpack the older
archive and compare its list of files with <code>/tmp/list</code>.

<pre class="code">
 mkdir /tmp/ghost
 cd /tmp/ghost
 zcat /wraith.cpio.gz | cpio -idum
 find . -xdev &gt; /tmp/oldlist
 wdiff -a /tmp/list /tmp/oldlist
</pre>

Using the differences you can see what files you need to create in
<code>/tmp/ghost</code> in order to match it up with the running
<code>/wraith</code>. You can save your changes by something like

<pre class="code">
 cd /tmp/ghost
 find . -xdev | cpio -o -H crc | gzip -c -9 &gt; /tmp/wraith.cpio.gz
 mv /tmp/wraith.cpio.gz /wraith.cpio.gz
</pre>

The changes will become automatic at the next boot. Of course, once you
write the filesystem to a CD, you will have no chance to revise it again!


<h3>Undo</h3>

<p> All this looks too complicated and life is too short? Just remove the
script <code>/etc/rcS.d/S01undead.sh</code>, the archive <code>/wraith.cpio.gz</code>
and the directory <code>/wraith</code>. You will have your system as pristine
as before.


<h3>Making the initrd</h3>

<p> We want our system to ``run anywhere'' - in particular, we should be
able to mount our root file system whether it resides on a CD or USB
stick (or perhaps even hard disk). If we use a CD then on
most systems this will be on the device <code>/dev/hdb</code> or <code>/dev/hdc</code>.
The USB stick usually shows up as <code>/dev/sda</code> or
<code>/dev/sdb</code>. It should be relatively simple to just
create a kernel which supports IDE CD drives and USB block devices.
When we boot such a kernel (with the correct <code>root=&lt;device&gt;</code>
parameter) the system will start up as expected on 90% of all systems
that one is likely to encounter. If this is OK with you then you
don't <em>need</em> an initrd so skip the rest of this section and read
the
<a href="http://www.digitalhermit.com/linux/Kernel-Build-HOWTO.html">HOWTO</a>
on building the kernel with IDE CD and US support - don't forget
support for the ISO 9660 (CD), ext2 and vfat (Win95) file systems.

<p> What about the remaining 10%? That will take 90% of the work as
usual. One possible solution could be to build <em>all</em> the drivers
of all possible CD drives, USB readers and the like into the kernel.
Unfortunately, automatically probing for some of these devices will
occasionally cause other devices to choke-up. It also seems like a bit
of a waste to take up such enormous amounts of kernel memory for unused
drivers. The solution provided by our intrepid kernel hackers is the
modules+initrd mechanism which allows you to write a script that chooses
which drivers to load depending on the devices found.


<h3>The steps</h3>

<p> The boot loader (see the next section) will load the kernel and the
initrd into memory. We will use a ``standard''
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/kernel-image-2.6-686">Debian kernel image</a>
which has essentially everything modularized (``essentially'' since we
must have support for at least one file-system built into the kernel
in order to load the init RAM disk - this could change if I understand
<code>initramfs</code> better).

<p> After the kernel has done its thing, it sets up the file-system with root
on the initrd and executes <code>/linuxrc</code> but doesn't quite fully let
go - when <code>/linuxrc</code> exits, the kernel executes <code>/sbin/init</code>.
We follow Debian's choices when we visualize the boot process as follows:

<dl compact><dt>
<b>linuxrc</b><dd> This script doesn't do much since we <em>want</em> the
kernel to let go and execute <code>/sbin/init</code> (still on the initrd).
<dt><b>init</b><dd> The program <code>/sbin/init</code> <em>on the initrd</em> is a script
that will run the following scripts:
<dl compact><dt>
<b>loadmodules</b><dd> This script loads the modules necessary to read
the CD and/or USB stick.
<dt><b>script</b><dd> This script will provide the subroutine <code>mount_root</code>
to recognise and mount our chosen file system on <code>/mnt</code>.
</dl>
The final steps of <code>init</code> are

<ul>
<li> Mount the root file system on <code>/mnt</code> and <code>cd</code>
to it.
<li> Execute <code>pivot_root</code> which makes the current directory the
root directory for the kernel and mounts the old root directory at
<code>/initrd</code>. After this our ``real'' root file-system <em>is</em>
mounted as root.
<li> Execute <code>chroot .</code> to change the root device of the
current process so that <code>/initrd</code> is free to be unmounted. We
must do this so that the RAM disk is free to be unmounted which frees
its space for use by other processes.
<li> Finally execute <code>/sbin/init</code> on the <em>real</em> 
root file system. This is the ``real'' <code>init</code> program which will
initialise the live system.
</ul>
</dl>

Debian has already provided the package
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/initrd-tools">initrd-tools</a> which
automates the building of the initrd. This already creates the
<code>/linuxrc</code> and <code>/sbin/init</code> needed for the initrd. So we
only need to provide the scripts <code>loadmodules</code> and
<code>script</code>.


<h3>Driver loading</h3>

<p> Writing these scripts was one of the most complex steps for me as it
deals with the aspect of Linux that I usually encounter the least - at
least on a working system - booting! On the other hand, this
<em>is</em> the job for which most installers and other forms of pre-install
detection tools have been written. So we follow the ``teacher'' Tom
Lehrer's dictum:

<pre>
   Plagiarize,
   Let no one else's work evade your eyes,
   Remember why the good Lord made your eyes,
   So don't shade your eyes,
   But plagiarize, plagiarize, plagiarize...
   (Only be sure always to call it please, "research".)

   -- Tom Lehrer, "Lobachevsky"
</pre>

<p> There is a good IDE driver detection routine that is part of the standard
Debian initrd. The Knoppix initrd gives us a safe order in which to load
all the SCSI modules. The Linux-Live initrd has a list of the necessary USB
modules to boot off a stick. So we put all these together to get routines
which I call <code>loadmodules_ide</code>, <code>loadmodules_scsi</code> and
<code>loadmodules_usb</code>. The <code>loadmodules</code> script on the initrd will then
act as a dispatcher - it will choose which routine to run depending
on what boot time parameters we give.

<p> Still, we should do <em>some</em> work. So (plagiarising from the
<a href="http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/">hotplug scripts</a>)
I also wrote a procedure <code>loadmodules_pci</code>
that loads only those modules which correspond to devices
in <code>/sys/bus/pci/devices</code> which match the data found in
<code>/lib/modules/kernel-version/modules.pcimap</code>. This procedure
makes use of the <code>sysfs</code> file system that was introduced with Linux
2.6.x but something similar may be possible using <code>/proc/bus/pci</code> in
Linux version 2.4.x. The principle is that the kernel <em>does</em>
provide a list of all the PCI devices that it found; for each such
device it also provides <em>some</em> device information - the interface for
this is the <code>sysfs</code> file system or (in 2.4.x) the <code>proc</code> file system.
On the other hand, each module writer makes a list of all devices that
the driver is known/expected to work for - the kernel build process writes
these to <code>modules.pcimap</code>. By matching the two lists we should be
able to load only those modules which have a matching device. This only
works with PCI devices but most devices on PC's nowadays
(including SCSI cards and the USB controller) <em>are</em> PCI devices.

<p> <a href="misc/kapil/loadmodules.txt">Here</a> is the script
to loadmodules that resulted from the above deliberations. This
scripts depends on a <a href="misc/kapil/allmod.list.txt">list</a> of
modules that are related to block devices.


<h3>Mounting the root file-system</h3>

<p> The second <a href="misc/kapil/script.txt">script</a> we will use
provides the routine to mount the root device. Again the <code>sysfs</code>
file system provided by the 2.6.x Linux kernel comes to the rescue. Under
<code>/sys/block</code> we find a list of all the block devices on the
system. If the <code>root=</code> option is given to the kernel we can
check whether this block device is available. Otherwise we check each
available block device to find evidence that it is our root file system -
by checking for the existence of the archive, directory and script that we
created above.


<h3>Using <tt>mkinitrd</tt></h3>

<p> The Debian <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/initrd-tools">initrd-tools</a> package is
a collection of scripts and so can be installed on any GNU/linux system
(for example use the source package directly). The main script is
<code>mkinitrd</code> which will create the standard Debian initrd. We will
run this script and make some changes in order to create our ``special''
initrd. First off all create some directory say
<code>/tmp/mkinitrd.confdir</code>. In this directory we will create the
file <code>exe</code> containing the list of executables that we want in
addition to the ``standard'' ones like <code>/bin/sh</code> - in our case
we need <code>/bin/grep</code>. Next we create a list of all the additional
files that we want to include; this is mainly the list of all modules that
are in some way connected with the use of block devices; <a
href="misc/kapil/files.txt">here</a> is my list. Finally, we also need a <a
href="misc/kapil/mkinitrd.conf.txt">configuration file</a>. We are set to
use <code>mkinitrd</code> with this directory as our configuration
directory.

<pre class="code">
mkinitrd -r "" -k -d /tmp/mkinitrd.confdir -o /dev/null
</pre>

This will tell you the name of the working directory which will be
something like <code>/tmp/mkinitrd.1234</code>. Now you need to edit the
<code>/tmp/mkinitrd.1234/initrd/linuxrc.conf</code> file to reflect the
various file systems that you may use for your root file system.
Finally, you copy the scripts you created above and generate the
initrd with <code>mkcramfs</code>.

<pre class="code">
dir=/tmp/mkinitrd.1234
rm $dir/initrd/scripts/*
cp allmod.list $dir/initrd/etc
cp loadmodules $dir/initrd
cp script $dir/initrd
chmod +x $dir/initrd/loadmodules
chmod +x $dir/initrd/script
mkcramfs $dir/initrd initrd.img
</pre>

If you build a kernel with <code>ext2</code> filesystem support instead of
<code>cramfs</code>, then you need to create an <code>ext2</code> filesystem
image based on the <code>/tmp/mkinitrd.1234</code> directory instead.


<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p> We now combine the ideas of the previous two sections. I assume that
you have managed to make your root filesystem boot in a ``read-only''
mode and that you are currently running in that mode. I also assume
that you have created an initrd that can boot on ``any'' machine.

<p> I <em>know</em> that the latter requirement is hard to check given that you
have access to only one machine at a time. Moreover, it is difficult to
find friends who will agree if you say ``I have on this floppy an initrd
and kernel that I would like to test on your system''; those
few will <em>not</em> remain friends if your kernel+initrd manages to
fry their system. 


<h3>Selecting the boot loader</h3>

<p> In order to boot off a CD or USB stick we need some software that can
do that. The nominees are <a
href="ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/syslinux-2.10.tar.gz"><tt>isolinux</tt></a>,
<a href="http://elserv.ffm.fgan.de/~lermen/"><tt>loadlin</tt></a> and <a
href="ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/"><tt>grub</tt></a>... and the winner,
in this case, is... <code>grub</code>. 

<p> The main file for booting using <code>grub</code> is called <code>stage2</code> or
<code>stage2_eltorito</code> in the case of booting CD's. When these files
are properly installed (see below how this is done for CD's), they are
loaded and run by the booting machine. They look for a configuration
file <code>/boot/grub/menu.lst</code>. We use a <code>menu.lst</code> file that 
looks like:

<pre class="code">
default  0

<p> timeout  5

<p> # Pretty colours
color cyan/blue white/blue

<p> title  Debian GNU/Linux with myinitrd
root  (cd)
kernel  /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.8-2-686 root=auto ro quiet vga=791
initrd  /boot/initrd.img
boot
</pre>

Other than the kernel and the initrd, we need <code>stage2</code> and
<code>menu.lst</code> in order to complete the list of steps given at the
beginning.


<h3>Making the CD</h3>

<p> First you need a ``pristine'' copy of the root file system.
If you used the <code>bind</code> mounts procedure to make the root
file-system read-only, then you can just do

<pre class="code">
 mkdir /tmp/pristine
 mount --bind / /tmp/pristine
</pre>

You then make a compressed tree of this file system:

<pre class="code">
 mkzftree -x /tmp/pristine /hugeroom
</pre>

where <code>/hugeroom</code> is some place with a lot of disk space.
Remove the directories <code>/hugeroom/lost+found</code> and
<code>/hugeroom/boot</code> from under this directory. Create an empty
<code>/hugeroom/boot</code> directory to which we copy the kernel image and
initrd. Into the <code>/hugeroom/boot/grub</code> directory goes the file
<code>stage2_eltorito</code> along with <code>menu.lst</code>.  These files
will not be compressed.

<p> We now create the CD image:

<pre class="code">
 mkisofs -R -J -z -hide-rr-moved -cache-inodes \
  -b boot/grub/stage2_eltorito -b boot/boot.cat \
  -boot-info-table -boot-load-size 32 \
  -no-emul-boot -o mylivecd.iso /hugeroom
</pre>

Then we blank a CD (if necessary) and write our image to it. For a
USB stick, we just create a partition and dump the entire image to
this partition using <code>dd</code>. Since I do not have a system that can
boot off a USB, I can only check the floppy based boot for such a
system. Perhaps one of the readers can enlighten me on how this is to
be handled for USB-booting BIOSes.


<h3>What else?</h3>

<p> You'll probably want to add a writable <code>/home</code> directory to
your system.  You need to further customise <code>wraith.cpio.gz</code> for
that. Another thing that you probably want to do is to fix the
<code>/etc/fstab</code> file that goes onto the CD. Other config files may
also need to be customised; <code>/etc/X11/XF86config-4</code> comes to
mind - for this to work ``anywhere'' it is best to use the
<code>vesa</code> driver.  Similarly, use <code>dhcp</code> to configure
ethernet rather than a hard-coded IP address in
<code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>.  On most systems there <em>is</em> a
hard disk and it is shame not to use it. You can set-up a swap partition
after you boot from the CD - be careful not to trash the host machine
though!


<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p> Today one can find a number of GNU/Linux systems that work off Live
CD's. There is <a href="http://www.knoppix.net">Knoppix</a> - and then
there are its <a
href="http://www.knoppix.net/wiki/Knoppix_Customisations">Klones</a>.
There is <a href="http://www.lnx-bbc.org">LNX-BBC</a>, <a
href="http://www.toms.net/rb">tomsrtbt</a>, <a
href="http://www.ltsp.org">LTSP</a> and even one called <a
href="http://www.goosee.com/puppy">Puppy</a>! There are the CD-based
installers for the common distributions. <em>But</em>, I am still not
satisfied. Each of these make choices that I am not comfortable with.  They
choose KDE, Gnome or <code>fluxbox</code>, when what <em>I</em> want is
<code>fvwm</code>; or they choose <code>xmms</code> when what I want is
<code>alsaplayer</code> (in daemon mode)... and so on.

<p> What's wrong with <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue87/sunil.html">Sunil's excellent
article</a> then? - just take a minimal Knoppix-like DSL and re-master it.
I would object that Knoppix puts everything in a <code>cloop</code> image
which makes it difficult to read the ``real'' contents of the CD on a
generic system; further this also makes it difficult to master and/or
re-master.

<p> There are other approaches like that taken by
<a href="http://www.gibraltar.at/">Gibraltar</a>,
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/bootcd"><tt>bootcd</tt></a> or
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/dfsbuild"><tt>dfsbuild</tt></a> or
<a href="http://www.linux-live.org"><tt>linux-live</tt></a>.

<p> The first two keep the files in a compressed ISO file-system. That
makes it usable ``anywhere''. I did try these but for one reason or another
they didn't work for me. For example they required the installation of
additional packages on my desktop.

<p> Ultimately, it comes down to this: I'm a terribly nit-picky kind of
person, and I have spent a lot of time fine-tuning my system and <em>no
one</em> is allowed to dictate what packages I must install and how they must
be configured. 

<p class="editorial">[ I <em>like</em> this Kapil guy, and the way he
thinks. :) -- Ben ]</p>

I enjoy tinkering with such things, and so I must have a system that I
understand fully. People also mentioned additional kernel features in late
2.4.x and early 2.6.x that simplify the building of a live CD. Finally,
isn't it fun to ``roll your own''?

Kapil Hari Paranjape has been a ``hack''-er since his punch-card days.
Specifically, this means that he has never written a ``real'' program.
He has merely tinkered with programs written by others. After playing
with Minix in 1990-91 he thought of writing his first program---a
``genuine'' *nix kernel for the x86 class of machines. Luckily for him a
certain L. Torvalds got there first---thereby saving him the trouble
(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those
days---much to the dismay of many around him who think he should
concentrate on mathematical research---which is his paying job. The
interplay between actual running programs, what can be computed in
principle and what can be shown to exist continues to fascinate him.
