Since I got commit access to Tesseract, I've been getting a little
more interested in image recognition in general, and I was pleased to
find a Java-based 'face annotation' system on Sourceforge:
<a href='http://faint.sourceforge.net'>http://faint.sourceforge.net</a>
</p>

<p>
The problem is, it doesn't support face detection on Linux, but it
does have a relatively straightforward way of annotating the image
using XMP tags. Perl to the rescue - there's a module called
Image::ObjectDetect on CPAN... it's a pity the example in the POD is
incorrect.
</p>

<p>
Here's a correct example that generates a simple HTML map (and nothing else <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;
use strict;

use Image::ObjectDetect;

my $cascade = '/usr/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml';
my $file = $ARGV[0];
my @faces = Image::ObjectDetect::detect_objects($cascade, $file);
my $count=1;

print "&lt;map name='mymap'&gt;\n";
for my $face (@faces) {
    print "  &lt;area shape='rect' alt='map$count'
href='<a href='http://www.google.com'>http://www.google.com</a>' coords='";
    print $face-&gt;{x}, ", ";
    print $face-&gt;{y}, ", ";
    print $face-&gt;{x}+$face-&gt;{width}, ", ";
    print $face-&gt;{y}+$face-&gt;{height}, "'/&gt;\n";
}
print "&lt;/map&gt;\n";

print "&lt;img src='$file' usemap='mymap'/&gt;\n";
</pre>

<p>
(to install Image::ObjectDetect, you first need OpenCV. On Debian, that's
apt-get install libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev<br>
cpan Image::ObjectDetect<br>
and you're done <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I've done a lot of work on image transform domains, edge-detection, etc.,
from static images (steganography related), so if you have any questions,
just ask.

Well, the part that interested me most about Tesseract was that it
came complete with tools to train it for a new language (none of the
other open source OCR systems do): the image processing parts are all
pretty complete, I'm only really reading up on things as a bug takes
me into a new area of the code. None of the bugs so far have been
critical to me, so I'm having fun with it.
</p>

<p>
There's code for face detection in Faint, using OpenCV, that would
only take a line or two of changes to work on Linux, but I don't have
the diskspace to check it out at the moment (y'know, Java, 350 million
.jar files in the SVN repository), so writing a quick script or two
seemed like a good compromise to tide me over until I'm motivated to
sprint clean my disk.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the offer, though.
