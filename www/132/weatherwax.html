<p>
When I first started reading "Classic Shell Scripting" by Arnold Robbins
and Nelson H. F. Beebe, the quality of the content inspired me to write
a review of this book. As opposed to most books on the subject that only
explain and give examples of syntax, this book aims to develop in the
reader a deeper understanding and true mastery of the POSIX shell.
</p>

<p>
The UNIX toolbox philosophy has been (to use a description from Robert
Floyd's acceptance of the ACM Turing Award) a staple "Programming
Paradigm" for UNIX programmers for several decades. In addition, to
developing a better understanding of existing UNIX tools, this book will
help programmers understand the ideas behind "pipeline programming":
producing programs that take data sources, process the data in a
sequence of serially connected steps and output the end result.
</p>

<p>
For example, the "wc" command provides standard counts of characters,
words, and line numbers in a given file.  To count all of the non-comment
lines in all shell scripts (assumed to end with .sh) in ~/bin: </p>

<pre class="code">cat `find ~/bin/ -name "*.sh"` | sed -e '/^ *#/d' | wc -l</pre>

<p>
This simple pipeline creates a data source containing all lines from all
shell scripts ending with .sh in your ~/bin directory. The sed command
then deletes any lines beginning with comments and the wc command counts
the remaining lines.  Commands like this make it easy to report how many
lines of code an application has.  This is a simple example of what can
be done with UNIX pipelines. This book helps the reader develop the
skills to write such programs.  </p>

<p>
The book begins with an inviting preface and draws the reader in, right
away.  The authors mention that the point of learning shell scripting is
to obtain proficiency in using the UNIX toolbox philosophy.  This
entails using a combination of smaller specialized tools to accomplish a
larger task.  As such, the book focuses on several main themes: </p>

<ul>
<li>
What the Unix tools are, specifically the reasons why the various
commands were created and the special jobs they were intended to do.
</li>

<li>
How to combine these Unix tools using pipes and file redirections.
</li>

<li>
Popular extensions to standard tools, specifically the use of GNU- or 
BSD-derived Unix systems and some indispensable nonstandard shell tools.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each chapter contains background and introductions into the Unix toolbox
philosophy. Collectively, they emphasize the need for and eventual
standardization of the Unix utilities through the POSIX standard, the
main points of which are: </p>

<ul>
<li>
Each command should do a single task (only) and do it as well as possible.
</li>

<li>
Process input and output lines of text, not any specific binary format.
</li>

<li>
A thorough understanding of regular expressions will ease many text processing tasks.
</li>

<li>
Default input and output comes from the keyboard and goes to the console respectively.
</li>

<li>
A program should do its task as quietly as possible and operate with no unnecessary output.
</li>

<li>
Borrow from the work of others: Learn as much as possible about existing
commands and use them whenever possible.  If no command exists to do the
task at hand ... invent one.  This is the focus of this book.  Use the
commands already in existence to construct new ones.  </li> 

</ul>

<p class="editorial">
[ Much of the above recapitulates the "Main Tenets" from Mike Gancarz' "The UNIX Philosophy" (Digital Press, Newton, MA 1995, 151 pp., $19.95, ISBN
1-55558-123-4) - another excellent read. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
I found the book to be a plethora of interesting ideas and command
descriptions.  Rather than describe each chapter in detail, I have chosen
to present a sequence of "factoids" containing the "Classic Shell
Scripting" content I found most interesting.  I should mention that
these are just a sample of the types of things you can learn by reading
this book.  </p>

<h4>Portability of "echo"</h4>

<p>
The built-in command echo is not as universal as you might first think.
The BSD version allowed the switch "-n" to disable the printing of a
newline after the string: </p>

<pre class="code">echo -n "Enter Choice: "</pre>

<p>
The System V version of echo used another approach for the same purpose:
They choose to implement a version that recognized a special escape
sequence "\c", so the above would become: </p>

<pre class="code">echo "Enter Choice: \c"</pre>

<p>
The current POSIX standard on echo does not include the "-n" option. On
my Linux system there are two echo commands: one in the shell and other
located in /bin.  The System V behavior can be implemented with a "-e"
switch </p>

<pre class="code">echo -e "Enter Choice: \c"</pre>

<p>
The purpose of this discussion is that echo in shell scripts may not be
as portable as one imagines.  For very simple string printing, this is
not usually a problem. For more complicated situations, one should use
the POSIX standardized command "printf". To do the above with printf, one
would use (as the newline is provided by default): </p>

<pre class="code">printf "Enter Choice: "</pre>

<p>
If a newline was desired, it could be inserted with "\n".
</p>

<h4>Debugging Shell Scripts:</h4>

<p>
Debugging shell scripts can be a simple as inserting a "-x" in the
shebang head of a shell script.  For instance, replace
<!-- Perhaps "shebang" should be replaced by something else - Hugo -->
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh</pre>

<p>
with
</p>

<pre>#!/bin/sh -x</pre>

<p>
The "-x" flag results in the shell echoing each and every command before
the command gets executed. Each sub-shell created also increments a prompt, 
so you can tell at what stack level each command executed.  For
instance, if your script is </p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

cat $1
echo `wc $1`
</pre>

<p>
Given an input set of files (file{1,2,3}) like the following (the $
being the shell prompt) </p>

<pre class="code">
$cat file1
file2
$cat file2
file3
$cat file3
Finally some data!
</pre>

<p>
the script (degEg.sh):
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh -x

cat file1
cat $(cat file1)
cat $(cat $(cat file1))
</pre>

<p>
produces for output
</p>

<pre class="code">
+ cat file1
file2
++ cat file1
+ cat file2
file3
+++ cat file1
++ cat file2
+ cat file3
Finally some data!
</pre>

<p>
Each level of "+"'s denotes the stack level in the script.  For
instance, the first command "cat file1" is at stack level 1 and 
produces the result "file2".  The next command is </p>

<pre>cat $(cat file1)</pre>

<p>
which must execute cat file1 first, before it can execute the "cat"
command on the existing result.  This "inner" call is performed at stack
level 2, represented in the above as </p>

<pre>++ cat file1</pre>

<p>
this result is file2, and is subject to the next cat command given in
debugging output like </p>

<pre>+ cat file2</pre>

<p>
with the result of "file3".  The rest of the example is similar.
</p>


<h4>Internationalization of your commands</h4>

<p>
There has been a recent push in the POSIX community aimed at
internationalization.  As such, you can make your computer speak Italian
and display help for the ls command, with </p>

<pre>LC_ALL=it_IT ls --help</pre>

<p>
These are just a small sample of some of the interesting things this
book has to offer. If you are a shell programmer who wants to take
his/her skills "to the next level", you should consider reading this
book.  </p>

<p>
John Weatherwax started running Linux when his undergraduate Physics
laboratory switched to it from a proprietary UNIX system.  He was
overwhelmed with the idea that by individual donations of time and
effort such a powerful operating system could be created.  His
interests are particularly focused on numerical software and he is
currently working on some open source software for the solution of
partial differential equations.  He hopes to complete that project
soon.
</p>

<p>
When he is not working on his various scientific endeavors he spends
his free time with his wife and their 9 month old daughter.
