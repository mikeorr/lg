&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; My customer located in West Austin is searching for a recent graduate
&gt; that has significant academic / internship experience with embedded
&gt; software development.  They seek someone with C programming experience
&gt; in a Linux / QNX environment.
&gt; 
&gt; If you or someone you know qualified, please call me or have them call me directly.
&gt; 
&gt; My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX
</pre>

<p>
Thanks for letting us know... that you're a spammer. I will not, for the
moment, report you to the Federal Trade Commission's "spam@use.gov", the
FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center, or your state's attorney - but
that's only because this is the first time you've done this here. For
now, I'll grant you the courtesy of believing you to be completely
clueless and ignorant rather than assuming that you knowingly violated
Texas law (<a href="http://www.spamlaws.com/state/tx.shtml">http://www.spamlaws.com/state/tx.shtml</a>) as well as your
network provider's Acceptable Use Policy.
</p>

<p>
I have, however, blocked you from this mailing list. Have a pleasant
day.

The worst part is that you have already paid him for using your
bandwidth;  You have, by providing him with the use of your server, and
taking the time to answer him, effectively provided him with your
services free of charge.  To add insult to injury, spammers often format
their mail using bandwidth-hungry graphics to bypass the spam filters.

<p>
   - loss of employee productivity
</p>

<p>
   - loss of business opportunity

No disagreement there. There are a few good solutions - Rick, for
example, has written here in LG about SPF (SMTP-based spam blocking),
and I've mentioned teergrubing (tarpitting) - but too few people
implementing them. It's a problem that will remain a problem until a
critical mass of people in responsible positions sign on to the
necessity of making the effort to deal with it.

That's a very gracious attitude you have there.  I am afraid I can't lay
claim to the same.  I get very irritated when technologists come up with
a good idea such as e-mail which some unscrupulous business people
immediately interpret as a free ride.  MS is actually the exception- I'm
actually grateful to them;  If it were not for them driving the
industry, I would not have the hardware I do to run Linux.  They've even
had a couple of good ideas on their own, I think.

This is something that happens with every single human invention; it's
just a simple fact, known (or should be) to every inventor and
discoverer - their inventions are going to be used for every purpose,
including evil ones. It couldn't have been more than a second between
the original discovery that a rock could be used to crack a coconut and
the thought that it could also be used to crush an enemy's skull.
Rutherford split the atom in 1919 and dreamed of free power for the
entire world... and barely two decades later, millions of dollars were
spent on focusing this new amazing discovery into the world's most
powerful weapon. My only hope is that the idiots don't manage to kill us
all off before we, as a race, grow up... I suppose you could call it the
ultimate test of fitness. We <strong>may</strong> well go the way of the mammoths. As a
humanist, I believe that we will survive; I have to, no other attitude
makes sense. As a rational man, I see powerful weapons placed in the
hands of the megalomaniacs and the idiots... and I have to hold on,
hard, to my best hopes.

It's pretty good at keeping some spam at bay, but the spammers are
keeping up. Some mail admins already see spambots retrying. In addition
to that most spam is now sent by using botnets. If you get frequent SMTP
TCP connections from pools of dynamic addresses, the greylisting might
not work. Until now if works, but it is only part of the mail filtering.
</p>

<p>
I use a combination of greylisting, (E)SMTP protocol checks, content
checks, real-time blackhole lists, DSPAM
(<a href="http://dspam.nuclearelephant.com/">http://dspam.nuclearelephant.com/</a>) and Spamassassin. Both DSPAM and
Spamassassin get feedback of their false positives and negatives. I
usually never see any spam emails; once a month some get through because
DSPAM purges its old tokens from the database, but that's about it.

I have to admit to having thought that way in the past - until I
realized just how passive ans supine a position pessimism represents.
That view, I realized, was not consistent with my belief in myself as a
man of integrity and courage. Out the door it went, with a "...and
<strong>stay</strong> out!" and a boot in the ass to help it on its way. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

...voluntary cooperation in a win-win mode is the rule in 99.95% of
human interactions, otherwise the streets would run with blood. Trade in
the market, ordinary social communication, and even our use of language
with each other are all systems of voluntary cooperation far more
elaborate than the open-source movement. Yet <strong>those</strong> we take for granted
and do not even register as cooperation, persisting despite the evidence
of our own daily experience in the belief the "natural" behavior of
human beings is a sort of dog-eat-dog Hobbesian strife [...] It's absurd
when you think about it.

&gt; Believe it or not, no. Given Rick Moen's prompt and careful attention to
&gt; handling spam on this list, the greatest majority of it never makes it
&gt; through - so the little that does is more of an opportunity for
&gt; entertainment and dissection than an irritant.

<p>
Rick does his best[0] on badly overstrained 11-year-old hardware[1]
running a system whose pending rebuild on less-ancient hardware is
overdue.  Greylisting is a must, after completing migration to the
replacement host, and meanwhile one of the more effective things I do to
tune the existing setup is feed recent spam to the Bayesian classifier.
 
I resumed doing the Bayesian retraining within the past couple of weeks,
after neglecting it for a long time.  The improvement was immediate and
dramatic.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; No disagreement there. There are a few good solutions - Rick, for
&gt; example, has written here in LG about SPF (SMTP-based spam
&gt; blocking)...
</pre>

<p>
SPF doesn't block spam.  It <em>does</em> permit detecting and disallowing of
"Joe-job" forgeries, which is a valuable thing in itself.

[1] I have everything I need, except free time.  Existing system
description, for comedy's sake:  circa-1997 VA Research, Inc. model 500
2U rackmount server, w/256MB RAM and 2 x 9GB SCSI-2 hard drives -- which
also runs all of my <em>other</em> Internet operations including usage by quite
a few remote shell users -- one of whom is, like me, a GNU Screen
addict, which is death to available RAM.

As any good Viking could have told you, it's an <em>awful</em> tool for

You're right; it's not a directly-intended result. However, it does
tends to block spam as a secondary effect in many cases - since spammers
often spoof the source addresses to get around the RBL and such.
</p>

<p>
The interesting part of this is that a lot of spammers are publishing
their SPF records in order to pass SPF checks. This, as I see it, is a
big win: if you're spammed from a server that has a published SPF
record, you will now <em>know</em> that it's that server rather than some
spoofed victim - and will be able to deal with it appropriately.

Your "benign neglect" has worked quite well over time. I recall what it

<p>
Yes.  In fact, right there, you've efficiently recapped the entire
now-traditional series of debate points on SPF.[1]  Well done.  ;-&gt;
</p>

<p>
I spoke up mostly because the most-common, and least sensible, criticism
of SPF is that it "does nothing to block spam, and spammers merely
publish SPF records" -- which misses the point entirely, for exactly
the reasons you cite, and wastes readers' time on a red herring.  (Also,
even if SPF <em>didn't</em> ensure that reputation loss affected the real
malefactors' sending domains, its ability to protect <em>reputable</em> domains
from forgery would be worthwhile.)
</p>

<p>
[1] Well, almost.  The collection would be complete if we had "SPF is no
good because it's not the same as DKIM/Domain Keys."  This is a moronic
argument for a number of reasons, including the fact that the two
schemes for authenticating envelope senders are <em>not</em> mutually exclusive.
(For completeness's sake, I'll also mention Microsoft's extension to SPF,
called "SenderID", but it has patent-encumbrance problems.)

&gt; I'm sending this to let you know, if you're not already aware, that
&gt; [198.144.195.186] is listed on the backscatterer.org RBL. We're kind of
&gt; aggressive and block rather than increment the message's SA score.
&gt; 
&gt; Usually that works OK but this is a case where it doesn't.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll whitelist [198.144.195.186] on our end.
&gt; 
&gt; I am a little surprised that you're using call backs, though.
</pre>

<p>
Hi, Keith.  I do use a particular type of callout, in a way that I have
taken care to make sure is (IMO, and I'm willing to be convinced
otherwise) not abusive.
</p>

<p>
1.  I recognise backscatter to be a very serious problem, and try to
make sure my systems are not guilty of same.
</p>

<p>
2.  My Exim4 MTA is configured to callout to the claimed delivering
domain's MX and test using RCPT TO (_not_ VRFY) that the claimed sender
address is deliverable, and that postmaster@ and abuse@ are deliverable.
Claimed delivering domains that fail those tests get told 550.  
</p>

<p>
It doesn't perform these tests on <em>every</em> attempted delivery; test
results get cached and reused, specifically to avoid abuse.
</p>

<p>
The guidelines at
<a href="http://www.backscatterer.org/index.php?target=sendercallouts">http://www.backscatterer.org/index.php?target=sendercallouts</a> seem to
suggest that systems get listed if they do such callouts at all, without
regard to whether the level of such traffic is problematic or not.  I
understand their perspective, but do not concur with the implied "No
level of callouts is permissible" assumption.
</p>

<p>
I attempt to operate a reputable mail system -- though of course I could
be misguided or be guilty of operating a misconfigured system.  I'll
study the backscatterer.org RBL docs more closely, but my immediate
inclination is that I'm not misguided in this case.

Hi, Rick --

&gt; level of callouts is permissible" assumption.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Given that we drop before DATA (unless postmaster@ or abuse@) if a system
is on the backscatterer.org RBL, I guess that's more-or-less implicit
agreement with the assumption on our part. I'm not so sure I'm comfortable
with that decision. It's been a while since I implemented that RBL and I
don't recall them having a "wait for the listing to expire or pay us 50
euros" policy which I see there today. That adds to my discomfort level.
</p>

<p>
Sure. I didn't mean to suggest otherwise. I added linuxmafia.com server to
our whitelist because I felt that backscatterer.org got it wrong; I saw no
reason to honor their listing. In writing you, I just wanted to point out
that the server was listed there.
