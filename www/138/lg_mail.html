&gt; First off, TWDT is no longer TWDT. If you click on TWDT you find that the

<p>
Well, I've fixed up the mailbag-processing script to produce a TWDT
"insert" that is a flat representation of the mailbag (and we actually
have code in the scripts that will use this file if it's in
'$LG_ROOT/data/twdt/'.) However, in order to use it, we need some
Pythoneer to fix the build scripts so that they'll ignore the
lg_{talkback*,tips,launderette}.html while building the TWDT.

Volunteers, please do step forward and be counted.

&gt; &gt; The lack of any errors suggests to me that the problem is not with the

&gt; &gt; reasonable conclusion from the data available?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I have tried reseating the controller card and cables, and moved the SATA
&gt; &gt; cable to the secondary port on the SATA controller.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Is there anything else I should be trying?
&gt;
&gt; Coming at it from the hardware end, I'd say that you have the right
&gt; idea: throwing in a different controller would be a pretty good test.
&gt; Shotgunning <em>does</em> make sense as a troubleshooting technique, when the
&gt; possible number of affected parts is low.
</pre>

<p>
I've finally got round to putting in a new SATA controller, and it seems to 
have helped; it may even have solved the problem. Previously, trying to copy 
large amounts of data to the SATA disk would bring the system to a complete 
halt. The last time I tried to copy a 1.5GB file to the SATA disk, it died 
after 60MB. Now, I can copy the same file without any obvious problems. 
</p>

<p>
There are still SATA errors on boot, which are a cause for concern, so I'll 
want to run for a while with that disk as my main disk, before I'm totally 
confident.
</p>

<p>
The errors on boot look like 
</p>

<pre>
ata2.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
ata2.00: tag 0 cmd 0xb0 Emask 0x2 stat 0x50 err 0x0 (HSM violation)
ata2: soft resetting port
ata2: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 310)
ata2.00: configured for UDMA/133
ata2: EH complete
</pre>
and that repeats a dozen times. It doesn't mean much to me, so I guess I'll 
need to spend some time with Google.

Dear Gang..
</p>

<p>
Any of you know what tools (preferrably open source) I can use to 
generate a predefined amount of CPU load in Linux? For example, the tool 
can receive an argument to generate 40% CPU load:
<pre>
./loader -l 40
</pre>
I plan to use such tool to generate background load, and do certain tests 
with another application to test scheduling latency. Thanks in advance 
for your advice.
</p>

<p>
regards,

<h3>A window manager for Inkscape</h3>

Hi gang - 
</p>

<p>
After all this time editing the mailbag, I finally have an actual
question for The Answer Gang. (I've searched the Net, and also asked at
mailing lists for icewm and Inkscape.)
</p>

<p>
I've been using icewm as my window manager, but, at this point, I either
need to find a way to configure it differently, or switch window
managers altogether.
</p>

<p>
The basic problem is that icewm takes the input and processes it before
Inkscape. (Input in this case is alt-click; there may be other input
that is also an issue, but this is the one I'm aware of.) If I can, I'd
like to bypass it, or alter the keypress combination that icewm is
looking for.
</p>

<p>
The other possibility is finding a better window manager. As an interim
measure, Ben found that ratpoison will at least ignore the alt-click
issue. Unfortunately, ratpoison makes it harder to work in gimp. I know
there are dozens if not hundreds of other window managers, but I'd
really rather not test every single one of them.
</p>

<p>
When I was using ThatOther "OS", one of the things I used quite often was
the IME (Input Method Editor), which allowed me to use a sequence of
keystrokes to alter the way that my keyboard and mouse input was
interpreted. Is there some equivalent that might be my answer here?
</p>

<p>
Hopeful,

<p>
Hi All,
</p>

<p>
I'd like to have 2 users using separate X-sessions on the same CPU - simultaneously.  That is, two
different monitors plugged into two different graphic-cards (or a single dual-headed card), each
matching two different keyboards and mice, but all using one CPU.
</p>

<p>
I know this can be done with Linux, but the information I found on how to do this is over a year
old, is for a 2.4 series kernel, and instructs the user to patch the kernel and/or X in order to
get the keyboards to be treated as separate from each other.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to avoid any patching, if possible, because I like to keep my kernel and X server up to
date and don't want to have to re-patch them every time I get another update.  I'm currently
running an up-to-date Fedora Core 5 system (2.6.20-1.2300.fc5smp and
xorg-x11-server-Xorg-1.0.1-9.fc5.6), and will be moving to a FC6 kernel and xorg-x11 server soon. 
I found the "startx -- -layout Multihead" command, and intend to buy a second video card
(PCI-based), monitor, USB keyboard and mouse.  Assuming I do a fresh install of FC6 with both sets
of equipment installed, will patching still be required, and what else might I have to do?  Thanks
in advance.
</p>

Hi gang - 
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to figure out how to view a multipage tif. It's something
that Wind0ws handles just fine, but I don't have the right tools to do
it here on my Debian system.
</p>

<p>
When I try to view it in Gimp, it comes out <strong>very</strong> distorted, and pretty
much illegible. (It's Japanese, so every pixel counts.)
