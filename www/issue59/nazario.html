<h2>
Abstract
</h2>
<p>
Often someone will write to a Linux help list asking for help with a
particular device they want to get working under Linux, and a standard
reply is "check the output of the dmesg command". This leaves a lot of new
users befuddled, and this document is here to hopefully help them navigate
this powerful debugging tool. Two sets of kernel boot messages are
presented and annotated, from an i386 system and a Linux-Pmac system.

<p>
<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
The Linux kernel is the central interface between the user and the
hardware. As such, it has to incorporate support for hardware if you are
to use it.  Often, though, cryptic device names are used by the system,
making it difficult at first inspection to determine if some particular
hardware is supported. The command 'dmesg', which is used to print kernel
messages, is very useful in determining if a piece of hardware has been
found, and if so, what the system is referring to it as.
<p>
This artcle, including the title and format of the dmesg comments, were
directly inspired and copied from the OpenBSD Explained article by the
same name. I felt one on Linux would be useful for people. 
<p>

The manpage for dmesg is quite simple:
<pre>
DMESG(8)                                                 DMESG(8)


NAME
       dmesg - print or control the kernel ring buffer

SYNOPSIS
      dmesg [ -c ] [ -n level ] [ -s bufsize ]

DESCRIPTION
       dmesg is  used  to  examine  or  control  the kernel ring
       buffer.
<BR></pre>

Upon boot, the dmesg output is from the kernel booting, showing the
devices it has found and if it has been able to configure them at all
(aside from userland configuration). This log is also available in the 
file <tt>/var/log/dmesg</tt>.
<p>
<h2>
Kernel output on an i386 system
</h2>
<p>

Shown below is a dmesg from an x86 system immediately after boot. The
output is indented by several space, and comments and descriptions are
left justified.
</p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Linux version 2.2.14-5.0 (root@porky.devel.redhat.com) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #1 Tue Mar 7 20:53:41 EST 2000
</ul>
</tt>
<p>
First up is the kernel version (2.2.14) and build (5), along with who built it, with what compile it was built, and when it wass built. This can be some inportant information, as some kernel versions and the GCC project don't interact correctly.
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Detected 300683434 Hz processor.
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
My K6/2-300 processor running at 300 MHz.
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Console: colour VGA+ 80x25
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
A standard PC console screen (15 inch monitor).
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Calibrating delay loop... 599.65 BogoMIPS
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
The useless benchmark of BogoMIPS. They're bogus (hence the name), but are often used as a relative processor speed indicator.
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Memory: 63008k/65536k available (1084k kernel code, 412k reserved, 968k data, 64k init, 0k bigmem)
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
My memory statistics. My machine has 64MB of real memory.
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Dentry hash table entries: 262144 (order 9, 2048k)
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
The dentry cache (dcache) represents the kernel's view of the namespace of
mounted filesystems.  There's pretty good documentation of it in
Documentation/filesystems/vfs.txt in the kernel source tree.
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Buffer cache hash table entries: 65536 (order 6, 256k)
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
In 2.2, the buffer cache is used for caching and aggregating data for
writes to block devices.  After 2.3.6, it is used for caching fs metadata,
such as inode information.
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Page cache hash table entries: 16384 (order 4, 64k)
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
In 2.2, the page (VM) cache is used for caching swap, read and mmap data
(which was bad, because shared writable mappings were ugly). After 2.3.6,
it also is used for write data (i.e., the buffer and page caches are
mostly unified), and all became happiness and light (sorta like BSD).
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     VFS: Diskquotas version dquot_6.4.0 initialized
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
My kernel support quotas (though I'm not using them).
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     CPU: AMD AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor stepping 00
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
A quick identification of the processor.
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Checking 386/387 coupling... OK, FPU using exception 16 error reporting.<br>
     Checking 'hlt' instruction... OK.
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
I seem to recall there being some Intel processor issues, which the kernel has to know about if it's to invoke corrections.

<p>
</ul>
</tt>
At this point, the kernel is done booting and we're ready to start /sbin/init (unless we supplied some information about init upon boot). The system then starts rc.sysinit and begins normal boot operations. The kernel has finished booting.

<p>
<h2>Kernel output on a Linux-Pmac system
</h2>

<p>
And, for comparison's sake, this is the output of Linux 2.2 on a PowerPC
system. Again, the dmesg output is indented and the description and
comments are left justified. For this system I was using BootX, which loads 
the kernel into memory from within the MacOS, then completes bootstrapping 
it after ditching the MacOS. Options can be passed to the kernel, as you 
would with LILO on an Intel based PC, from within the app.

<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     device tree used 17860 bytes
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
PowerPC systems use what is known as OpenFirmware, rather than a PC like
BIOS, and it has a 'device tree', which is arranged a bit like a UNIX
filesystem. This one uses about 16kb.
<p>
<ul>
<tt>
     Total memory = 72MB; using 512kB for hash table (at c0280000)

</ul>

Again, total physical RAM available.

     EDT 1999
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
Kernel version (2.2.6 build 15 on a Pmac), who built it
(root@video.linuxppc.org), what version of gcc (or egcs), and when it was
built. This can be diagnostic as some versions of the Linux kernel don't
play well with some versions of GCC.

     eth0: MACE at 00:05:02:10:e6:6d, chip revision 9.64
<p>

Good old eth0, the ethernet device. It's MACE on a PowerMac. If this had
been a modular driver, it wouldn't have shown up here but only after the
module had been inserted.

     Partition check:<br>
     sda: sda1 sda2 sda3 sda4 sda5 sda6<br>
     sdb: sdb1<br>
     sdc: sdc1 sdc2 sdc3 sdc4<br>
     sdd: sdd1 sdd2 sdd3 sdd4<br>
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
The partition check is useful for knowing what the disks are laid out as.

     Adding Swap: 131428k swap-space (priority -1)
<p>
</ul>
</tt>
And we're done booting.

<h2>Concluding remarks
</h2>
<p>
Like I noted above at the end of the i386 dmesg output, the kernel, once 
finished, then moves on to <tt>/sbin/init</tt> unless an argument poiting it elsewhere
has been passed to the kernel at boot time. An example would be telling the
kernel "<tt>init=/bin/sh</tt>", such that it would execute a shell upon boot, rather
than <tt>/sbin/init</tt> (and what follows). Note that the kernel only mounts the
root filesystem read-only, so if all you do is boot the kernel you have
to mount your disks read-write in order to affect changes on them (ie
editing <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> to rescue root's password).
<p>
While this isn't the most thorough of jobs, I hope that this little tour
has been enjoyable for everyone, and educational.
