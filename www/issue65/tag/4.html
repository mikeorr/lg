<p><strong>From Alessio Frenquelli 
</strong></p> 
<p align="right"><strong>Answered By  Heather Stern
<br></strong></p>

<!-- sig -->

<p><strong>
Hello,
<br>I start thanking you for any help ... I am stuck at this stage, I am not a
GURU on LINUX and I cannot overcome the problem.
</strong><p>
<P><STRONG>
Therefore I cannot really point to what has been changed or went wrong.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Under the Internet I found many, many errors entries pointing to LILO not
being able to load in a disk that is above the 1024 cylinders
</STRONG></P>

Yes, it used to be LILO's biggest bug, though not its loudest (that one is
people using it wrong and then wailing what are they going to do now that
their MBR is mangled).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But ever since the new version those are old messages.  The normal solution
until it came out, was to create a tiny <TT>/boot</TT> near the beginning of the
free space - even most dual booters could manage to slip a 20 Mb partition
below the boundary.  This works because on the <EM>kernel</EM> and <EM>bootmap</EM> needs
to be below the line;  once the kernel is loaded you are no longer working
with real mode BIOS issues at all, you are fully in protected mode and can
access everything the kernel is built for.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
In my case LILO always worked so far, and I did not surely changed the disk
size, done any repartitioning under Windows NT nor under Linux.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Under Windows, I have run Program =&gt; PartitionMagic =&gt;PartitionInfo and I am
attaching the output of the command to this email in case you need to see in
details my machine's partitioning.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

	> []
So you normally use partition magic for your dual boot menu, I'm guessing.
If so, that is what is presently in your MBR, and would be overwritten
(***warning warning danger will robinson*** or at least look real carefully
that you've set up stanzas for NT also first!) if you change boot = <TT>/dev/hda</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h4>ENVIRONMENT</h4>
<p><strong>
Dual bootable Laptop, Toshiba Tecra 8100; one partition is Windows NT
workstation, the other is Linux RedHat 6.1.
</strong><p>
<h4>PROBLEM</h4>
<p><strong>
Linux 6.1 LILO does not longer boot properly. Just stop at the word "LI".
</strong><p>

<h4>SOME TROUBLESHOOTING INFO</h4>
<strong>
Fortunately I have the boot diskette, and booting from it, I can
successfully get to Linux.
</strong><p>
<p><strong>
When running : &lt;&lt; <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> &gt;&gt;  I got messages:
</strong><p>

<strong><pre>[root@afrenquelli /etc]# lilo

	> [Heather]
You used to get this before, or you now have a bigger disk than you
used to?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By the way, Redhat 6.1 is a bit old, and lilo itself was updated last
year so that 1024 cylinder issues are not a problem for it. (You'll
also want to keep up to date on RH security updates, not quite as
drastic as upgrading the system entirely.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
With the newer version, you can add the keyword
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>	LBA32
</font></code></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
into the top of your <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> and it would use a different method
to know where things are on the disk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Being a boot loader, it's critical for lilo to know <EM>precisely</EM> where
the kernel resides on your drive.  Moving your kernel file (even if you
then moved it back) or your system maps is a good reason to run <TT>/sbin/lilo.</TT>

No relation.  Lilo puts its bits into the Master Boot Record, which is
not shown here.  If ordered to, it could also use the superblock but,
that is also not shown here, as it's reserved space for the filesystem
driver.

Do you have an NT boot menu pointing you into Linux?  Because I also

Thinking that the latest version of LILO "could" have fixed this problem, I
have downloaded LILO 21.6.1-1 from

Although I'd like to note at this time that making sure your backups of your
personal data on both OS setups are in current state, and good working

of ZIP cartridges maybe.

lilo has actually very excellent documentation that comes with it... much
finer than many application packages in fact.  If you run 'locate lilo'
a bunch of things will scroll by, and several be from the doc directory
tree somewhere on your disk.  I'm guessing <TT>/usr/doc/lilo-</TT> (some version
number) but I'm not near a RedHat system right now to look.  Anyways
on my <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> system it's in <TT>/usr/doc/packages/lilo</TT> ... I have some dvi
files (readable or printable by LaTeX tools) and some compressed postscript
files (but ghostview ... the command gv ... is glad to show these to me).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The README, however, is the right place to start, because unlike most
readme files around here (which can be summarized "so this is the foo
program, I created it because bla bla.  It's under the GPL/artistic/whatever
license, see COPYING.  If there are any bugs (hope not) get in contact
with me at ...") it has some serious data in it.  Consider it your quickstart
guide to a working LILO.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You've already done a number of the obvious things, so, let us know if the
uninstall/reinstall trick works, and if that readme isn't helpful to you
we may be able to translate it to plainer english.

Here's where my "doc" script would come in really handy: all you'd have to
do is type something like "doc lil", and it would give you a numbered list
of all the subdirectories in your "doc" directory that start with 'lil'.
Typing that number enters the directory and shows you a numbered file list;
typing one of <EM>those</EM> numbers displays the file, no matter what its format
is. When you exit the viewer, it shows you the list again, and gives you a
chance to "fish around" in subdirectories and other files.

I will provide here some answers from the queries that you had.
At this stage it seems that the problem is caused by one of our product,
that I have recently installed under Linux. After reporting the LI problem
to our support team, I received a reply where they state that this product
ast times seems to affect LILO, and to cause the problem that I have
described to you.

I am still awaiting from our support team, if they know how to fix the
problem of LILO.

 Any recent changes?  The next L should represent finding the second stage
 loader so the kernel can get going.  These could be disk-ish things like
 you caught a virus and successfully cleaned it out, had a hard crash and
 needed to reboot, etc

<li> Run /sbin/lilo -v  (make sure no errors are displayed)
<li> Insert a new diskette and mount it:
<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>	mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
</font></code></blockquote>
<li> df -k gives me 2 filesystems:
<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>	/dev/hda7 Mounted /
<br>	/dev/hda5 Mounted /boot
</font></code></blockquote>
<li> run command :

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>	dd if=/dev/hda7 of=/tmp/bootsect.lnx bs=512 count=1
</font></code></blockquote>
<li><tt> cp /tmp/bootsect.lnx /mnt/floopy</TT>
<li> shutdown and reboot under NT
<li><tt> copy c:\bootsect.lnx c:\bootsect.lnx_old</tt>
<li><tt> copy a:\bootsect.lnx c:\bootsect.lnx</tt>
<li> reboot under Linux
</ol></strong><p>
<p><strong>
PROBLEM solved, LILO loads correctly.
