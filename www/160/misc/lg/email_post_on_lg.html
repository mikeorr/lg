   I read a post of yours on mass emailing on Linux Gazette -- I found the
   post since I was looking for information on mall emailing in Linux.  Since
   we have a small gourmet foods shop in New Jersey and have compiled a
   customer list of nearly 1000 emails, we figured we'd use it to announce a
   sale and specials; nothing nefarious about our intentions.  It turns out
   kmail and evolution aren't well-suited to the task, a significant
   proportion of emails have been changed (earthlink/mindspring -&gt;
   embarqmail), mistyped into the database, or have simply been abandoned; we
   got about a 15% bounce rate.
</p>

<p>
   I imagine a good mass mailer would have hooks for database import (MySQL
   on a LAMP server) and have a means for "fixing" the database based on
   bounces and "UNSUBSCRIBE" requests.

<a href='http://www.openemm.org/'>http://www.openemm.org/</a> might be interesting. There was a review in a
German GNU/Linux magazine a few months ago.

Neither of the above is very surprising, of course; GUI clients tend not
to be very useful for script-type processing, and link rot/email rot
occurs at a steady pace.

This might be a bit of a paradigm shift - but I would consider using a 
mailing list instead of trying to cobble together a solution. It's got
all the features you're looking for (unsub/bounce/defer/reject handling,
etc.), and most of them use, or can use, a database as a back end.
</p>

<p>
What we use here is Mailman, one of the most popular list managers out
there. As far as I know, it stores its member data in text files - but
it can use MySQL via the "MySQL Member Adaptor":
</p>

<p>
<a href='http://loeki.tv/log/archives/81-Setting-up-Mailman-to-store-members-in-a-MySQL-database.html'>http://loeki.tv/log/archives/81-Setting-[...]o-store-members-in-a-MySQL-database.html</a>
<a href='http://trac.rezo.net/trac/rezo/browser/Mailman/MySQLMemberAdaptor'>http://trac.rezo.net/trac/rezo/browser/Mailman/MySQLMemberAdaptor</a>
</p>

<p>
Although with only 1000 members, I wouldn't bother. Even if you grow
significantly, Mailman can handle it without any trouble. I've heard of
people running it with ~20k subscribers, and they have no complaints.

Thanks, sometimes the solution is "right under the nose" -- since we use
OpenSuse, I can simply install mailman from the distribution.  Of
course, since it's in Python, it may not be too difficult to use PyODBC
to access our database.

That's a lovely thing about Linux. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Pretty much everything and
anything is there, already in the repositories. Glad I could help, and
good luck!
