<h1>Encrypted Storage with LUKS, RAID and LVM2</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

<p>
Some people have a need for storing data securely. Sometimes this means not only redundant
disks (and a good backup strategy) but also encryption. Fortunately, the Linux kernel has
all the features to use multiple RAID devices, pool them to a Logical Volume, and encrypt
every block of the filesystem. Just don't forget your passphrase!
</p>

<h2>
Creating RAID devices
</h2>

<p>
The first step involves the creation of a Linux software RAID device. For the sake of
simplicity we will stick to RAID level 1, i.e. mirroring two disks or disk partitions.
A RAID1 can be done with any two (or more) parts of block devices that have the same size.
Usually you mark these partitions when installing the system. The installers of most
GNU/Linux distributions have an editor that allows you to do this. We will assume that
we already have a system, and prepare four partitions for the use of two RAID1 devices.
You simply have to edit the partition table. I like to use the <tt>cfdisk</tt> tool
for that.
<pre>
osiris:~# cfdisk /dev/sdc
</pre>
Prepare your partitions and mark them with the type code <b>FD</b>. This code marks the
partitions as <i>Linux RAID autodetect</i> and allows the system to activate them at
boot time. Remember, all the partitions should be of the same size.
<pre>
osiris:~# cfdisk /dev/sdd
</pre>
I chose <tt>/dev/sdc1</tt> and <tt>/dev/sdd1</tt>. Now let's create the RAID. You will
need the <tt>mdadm</tt> tool for this.
<pre>
osiris:~# mdadm --create /dev/md6 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
</pre>
After pressing enter the kernel creates the device and starts synchronising the
blocks. You can check the progress of this operation by looking into <tt>/proc/mdstat</tt>.
This file gives you status of all RAID devices in the system.
<pre>
osiris:~# cat /proc/mdstat 
Personalities : [raid1] 
md1 : active raid1 sdb2[1] sda2[0]
      3903680 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md5 : active raid1 sdb3[1] sda3[0]
      4883648 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md2 : active raid1 sdb5[1] sda5[0]
      1951744 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md4 : active raid1 sdb7[1] sda7[0]
      297435328 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md6 : active raid1 sdd1[1] sdc1[0]
      488383936 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
md0 : active raid1 sdb1[1] sda1[0]
      489856 blocks [2/2] [UU]
      
unused devices: <none>
osiris:~#
</pre>
If you see an output like this, the RAID devices are in a consistent state. The
<tt>mdadm</tt> packages provides utilities for monitoring the state of RAIDs.
This is very useful otherwise you may not notice when your disks and your RAID
is dying.
</p>
<p>
Now create a second RAID device. I use <tt>/dev/md4</tt> from the output above
as the second device to be added to our encrypted logical volume.
</p>

<h2>
Encrypting the Block Devices
</h2>

<p>
Our tool of choice will be <tt>cryptsetup</tt> for enabling encryption. Before you
use block devices as encrypted storage, it is recommended that you overwrite them
with random bit patterns. The easiest way to do this is by using <tt>dd</tt>.
<pre>
osiris:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/md4
osiris:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/md6
</pre>
Depending on your hardware this can take several hours. Make sure not to use
<tt>/dev/random</tt> or these commands will take several days or weeks. You don't
have to do this. However if you leave any recognisable pattern on the device,
it is easier to spot the encrypted blocks, and concentrate code breaking on them.
</p>
<p>
After your disks have been overwritten with random garbage you can encrypt them.
<pre>
osiris:~# cryptsetup -c aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 -y -s 256 luksFormat /dev/md4
osiris:~# cryptsetup -c aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 -y -s 256 luksFormat /dev/md6
</pre>
Make sure you don't forget your passphrase! If you forget it, your data is pretty
secure and unrecoverable. Bear in mind encrypting data and throwing the keys away 
is the industrial standard for data destruction (of course assuming that you are
using something better than ROT13 or XOR). The block devices are now ready for
encryption.
</p>
<p>
The commands above initialise the devices for use with the AES algorithm. The key
length is 256 bit, and we use a method called ESSIV or <i>E(Sector|Salt)</i> in order
to avoid weaknesses in the choice of initial values for the encryption algorithm.
</p>

<h2>
Unlocking the Block Devices
</h2>

<p>
Every time you wish to use your encrypted block devices you have to unlock them.
That's the idea. Unlocking can also be done with <tt>cryptsetup</tt>.
<pre>
osiris:~# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md4 crypt1
osiris:~# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md6 crypt2
</pre>
You will be prompted for your passphrase. After unlocking, the devices can
be accessed by using <tt>/dev/mapper/crypt1</tt> and <tt>/dev/mapper/crypt2</tt>.
Note that we won't use the RAID devices directly anymore. We access the storage
space through an encryption layer. The data stored in the blocks of our RAID
is encrypted.
</p>

<h2>
Pooling Block Devices into a Logical Volume
</h2>

<p>
The Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is a tool for combining multiple physical
block devices into volume groups, and for creating logical volumes out of them.
The LVM2 has its own HOWTO where everything is explained in great
detail. We only need to know how the storage areas are organised. The order is
as follows.
<ol>
<li> Physical extents (block devices, partitions)</li>
<li> Volume groups (consisting of physical extents)</li>
<li> Logical volumes (combining parts of volume groups)</li>
</ol>
So far we have only the RAID devices which correspond to the lowest layer of the LVM2.
We still need to create physical extents, assign them to a volume group and create
a logical volume. Filesystems can only reside on these logical volumes. The following
figure illustrates how the different storage layers are connected.<br>
<img src="misc/pfeiffer/lvm2.png" width="624" height="244" alt="LVM2 diagram">
</p>
<p>
Ok, so let's mark our encrypted RAID1 devices as physical extents and create a volume
group.
<pre>
osiris:~# pvcreate /dev/mapper/crypt1
osiris:~# pvcreate /dev/mapper/crypt2
osiris:~# vgcreate -v cryptvg /dev/mapper/crypt1 /dev/mapper/crypt2
</pre>
The commands <tt>pvscan</tt> and <tt>vgdisplay</tt> shows you the result of the commands
above. The <tt>vgdisplay</tt> is especially useful since it shows you the number of
physical extents available in a volume group. We now want to use the complete
volume group <tt>cryptvg</tt> for a logical volume. Therefore we tell <tt>lvcreate</tt>
the number of extents to use.
<pre>
osiris:~# lvcreate -l 191849 -n backuplv cryptvg
</pre>
That's all we need. Our new logical volume can now be accessed by the device file 
<tt>/dev/backup/backuplv</tt>. We format this device with an XFS filesystem (of course you
can use whatever filesystem you wish, XFS is just an example).
<pre>
osiris:~# mkfs.xfs -d agcount=48 -L backup /dev/backup/backuplv
</pre>
That's it. We can now mount this volume and use it as we like. Don't forget
to write an entry for your <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> in order to have all mount options
ready. A possible configuration would be like this one:
<pre>
/dev/backup/backuplv /backup xfs ikeep,noatime 0 0
</pre>
</p>

<h2>
Mounting and umounting 
</h2>

<p>
You have to do some steps to activate and deactive your new encrypted volume. Most
things will be taken care of by the Linux kernel (such as autodetecting the RAID
devices and starting them). Some things can't be taken care of automatically.
Here is a simple script that does all the necessary steps.
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

echo "Unlocking /dev/md4"
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md4 crypt1
echo "Unlocking /dev/md6"
cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/md6 crypt2
echo "Scanning for volume groups"
vgscan --mknodes
vgchange -ay
echo "Mounting /backup"
mount /backup
</pre>
<tt>cryptsetup</tt> will ask you once per RAID device for your passphrase(s).
The shutdown sequence is the reverse order.
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

umount /backup
# Mark the logical volume INACTIVE (can be restored with 'lvchange -ay')
lvchange -an backuplv
# Mark the volume group INACTIVE (can be restored with 'vgchange -ay')
vgchange -an cryptvg
cryptsetup remove crypt1
cryptsetup remove crypt2
</pre>


Most GNU/Linux distributions have start/stop scripts that can take care of
the activation and deactivation sequences. Nevertheless it's good to know
how to do it (maybe for cases when the system isn't available anymore).
</p>

<h2>
Important: Field Tests
</h2>

<p>
Now that your new shiny encrypted logical volume is empty, you have a once in a lifetime
chance of <b>testing</b> the storage mechanism. Don't miss to do this! Try simulating
a disk failure. Switch off the power and reboot. Do a filesystem check. Create
thousands of files and delete them. Copy loads of big ISO images. Do whatever
could happen to your storage and see if your data is still there. XFS' <tt>mkfs</tt>
command has the <tt>-p</tt> switch that allows you to populate a freshly created
XFS filesystem with files and directories according to a prewritten description
of the filesystem layout. This is a very useful feature for testing.
Use it. Simulate everything that can go wrong. When you are satisfied with your testing,
put your valuable data on it. And always keep backups.

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.
