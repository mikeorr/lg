<h1>A New Windoze Notebook &mdash; Now What? Knoppix!</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>For a brief period of time this office had been Windows-free, in
theory at least. The combo printer requiring '95 had stopped using
black ink and '95 had stopped booting, making both obsolete. And
'98 on the old notebook doesn't shutdown properly, which turns
booting into an adventure. Just hadn't quite got around to dumping
all this junk.</p>

<p>Then fate sent a project my way that required some variety of
Windows. The one tool I absolutely need I got familiar with many
years ago under OS/2. Unfortunately it no longer exists in any such
incarnation. So it was time to clench my teeth, say good-bye to
dreams of a notebook completely unexposed to Windows and
order a Dell with whatever is current from Redmond now-a-days.</p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>

<p>We ordered the Dell with twice the hard-drive and 4
times the memory advertised, so we just reduce the partition a bit
and put SuSE 10.0 on there and be up and running in nothing
flat.</p>

<p>This is something I've done for years. One of my favorite
commercial tools had been Partition Magic. Pretty easy to reduce a
partition in size and use the free space for some other
purpose.</p>

<p>But as Robert Burns put it: The best laid schemes o' Mice an'
Men, Gang aft agley.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>If in the past I have ever said anything nice about products
from Redmond, I really do regret it. If anything, I have certainly
been far too polite in just using words like "junk". There are
other 4-letter and longer words far more suitable.</p>

<p>Consider: you buy a machine with one pre-installed operating
system on an 80GB drive and cfdisk reports:</p>

<pre class="code">
              First       Last
 # Type       Sector      Sector   Offset    Length  File System Type (ID) Flags
-- ------- ----------- ----------- ------ ----------- -------------------- -----
 1 Primary           0      176714     63      176715 Dell Utility (DE)    none
 2 Primary      176715   146544929      0   146368215 HPFS/NTFS (07)       Boot
   Pri/Log   146544930   146560994      0       16065 free                 none
 3 Primary   146560995   156296384      0     9735390 CP/M / CTOS / . (DB) none
</pre>

<p>Mount the 3 primary partitions and df shows:</p>

<pre class="code">
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
[...]
/UNIONFS/dev/sda1        88136      6654     81482   8% /mnt/sda1
/UNIONFS/dev/sda2     73184104   7132524  66051580  10% /mnt/sda2
/UNIONFS/dev/sda3      4858184   3167052   1691132  66% /mnt/sda3
</pre>

<p>Why is there more than one primary partition? The hardware
architecture only supports 4, they're valuable! None is
particularly full. And that gap in the middle?! Can we spell
"fragmentation"? Define it?</p>

<p>Maybe people living in the wild and wooly world of Windows are
used to things like this and don't consider it fraudulent when
deprived of about 14GB out of 80. But to have that much real estate
taken away without even asking!? Consider the percentage if I
hadn't chosen a drive twice the size of normal.</p>

<p>Is there any need to point out the bizarre file system types?
And I don't do NTFS!</p>

<h3>Tabula Rasa</h3>

<p>But it gets better, or worse. Back in '95 days, you got a CD
with the operating system, probably also pre-installed on the
machine.</p>

<p>With '98 the system was pre-installed and you got a so-called
"Recovery CD" along with it. At some point in time you were forced
to use the infernal thing and that was when you learned that it
wouldn't just restore the operating system but would return the
entire partition to the status it had originally had when the
machine left the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Like good-bye data if you don't have adequate back-ups and/or
another bootable partition (this was long before Knoppix). But if
you modified the partition size in order to install something else
as well, the "Recovery CD" fails &mdash; after it has formatted the
partition it can't use! And the last Partition Magic I bought
couldn't help because instead of running under DOS it required
Windows. A perverse Catch-22. Been there, done that, wore out the
T-shirt.</p>

<p>But at least you had a CD with the system software on it.</p>

<p>Dell/Microsoft didn't even provide one! Just how expensive are
CD-ROMs today? In bulk?</p>

<p>That's what those other partitions are all about. In other words
it is impossible to do something simple like format the drive,
allocate partitions, and install software. So now what?!</p>

<h3>Tools and Toolboxes</h3>

<p>In spite of having used other fine tools in the past to work
through problems, Knoppix has become my toolbox of choice because
it gives me an environment I am familiar with, GNU/Linux, and lots
and lots of tools.</p>

<p>Of course the first thing I did &mdash; after minimal setup, as
little as possible &mdash; was to change the boot sequence on the
notebook to enable using Knoppix. I had to know how to do this (F2,
DEL early in the boot process are good candidates): other than one
large piece of paper (roughly 2-times legal-size) describing the
external features of the hardware, Dell included no significant
printed documentation. It's all on the hard-drive.</p>

<p>Above, you have already seen some of the information available
from use of the tools on the Knoppix CD/DVD. By the way, here I am
using a DVD with Knoppix 4.0.</p>

<p>So far all we have been able to do is to confirm that we have a
major problem. Bizarre HD configuration. Unfamiliar file
system.</p>

<p>So let's see what tools Klaus Knopper included in his
toolbox:</p>

<pre class="code">
knoppix@3[knoppix]$ apropos NTFS
libntfs-gnomevfs (8) - Module for GNOME VFS that allows access to NTFS filesystems.
mkntfs (8)           - create a NTFS 1.2 (Windows NT/2000/XP) file system
ntfscat (8)          - concatenate files and print them on the standard output
ntfsclone (8)        - Efficiently clone, image or restore an NTFS filesystem
ntfscluster (8)      - identify files in a specified region of an NTFS volume.
ntfsfix (8)          - tool for fixing NTFS partitions altered by the Linux kernel NTFS driver.
ntfsinfo (8)         - dump a file's attributes
ntfslabel (8)        - display/change the label on an ntfs file system
ntfsls (8)           - list directory contents on an NTFS filesystem
ntfsprogs (8)        - several tools for doing neat things with NTFS partitions
ntfsresize (8)       - resize an NTFS filesystem without data loss
ntfsundelete (8)     - recover a deleted file from an NTFS volume.
smbcquotas (1)       - Set or get QUOTAs of NTFS 5 shares
knoppix@3[knoppix]$  
</pre>

<h3>Plan B</h3>

<p>From looking at a couple of the man pages it would seem that
this collection of tools has been around for 10 years or so, well
beyond release 0.0 by now.</p>

<p>So let's use ntfsclone to push an image of the bootable
partition over the LAN onto another machine. Once we have that as
back-up we can use ntfsresize to shrink the partition down to
something reasonable. After that it should be easy enough to create
an extended partition with a couple of logical partitions for
Linux.</p>

<p>I'm not at all familiar with these tools but it is always fun to
learn something new. And the time is right.</p>

<h3>Backing Up</h3>

<p>Again, nothing ever quite works the way one expects. Making the
image was no exception. Here is one of the unsuccessful
attempts:</p>

<pre class="code">
knoppix@3[knoppix]$ su
root@3[knoppix]# ntfsclone --save-image --output - /dev/sda2 | gzip -c | \
ssh -l web lohgopc2 'cat &gt; /DATA/NO_BACKUP/DELL/sda2.img.gz'
ntfsclone v1.9.4
The authenticity of host 'lohgopc2 (192.168.0.102)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 65:32:cc:81:8f:eb:73:24:7b:b3:18:a8:66:fa:7c:ae.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? NTFS volume version: 3.1
Cluster size       : 4096 bytes

100.00 percent completed
Accounting clusters ...
Space in use       : 7304 MB (9,7%)
Saving NTFS to image ...

root@3[knoppix]#
</pre>

<p>After "Saving NTFS to image ..." nothing further happened and I had to cancel with
CTRL-C.</p>

<p>Here is what finally worked:</p>

<pre class="code">
knoppix@1[knoppix]$ su
sudo: unable to lookup Knoppix via gethostbyname()
root@1[knoppix]# ntfsclone --save-image --output - /dev/sda2 | gzip -c | \
ssh -l web lohgopc2 'cat &gt; /DATA/NO_BACKUP/DELL/sda2.img.gz'

Saving NTFS to image ...

Warning: No xauth data; using fake authentication data for X11 forwarding.
100.00 percent completed
Syncing ...
root@1[knoppix]#
</pre>

<p>Other than the obvious difference between success and failure,
from a quick glance at the output it isn't clear why one worked and
one didn't. But look at the lines ending in "NTFS volume version:
3.1".</p>

<p>On the unsuccessful attempt I had failed to note that ssh wanted
confirmation that it was OK to establish a connection with the
other machine. It was patiently waiting for me to enter "yes" while
I was scratching my head trying to figure out why nothing was
happening!</p>

<p>Success the next morning &mdash; a good night's sleep can do a world
of good &mdash; didn't include that question because I had already told
ssh that it was OK and it had "permanently" (until next boot with
Knoppix) recorded this fact. Refreshed and thinking clearly, I
remembered that the password was needed and saw the request from
ssh.</p>

<h3>Resizing</h3>

<p>Now that our safety-net was in place the first thing to do was
to check out the partition:</p>

<pre class="code">
knoppix@4[knoppix]$ sudo ntfsresize --info /dev/sda2
sudo: unable to lookup Knoppix via gethostbyname()
ntfsresize v1.9.4
NTFS volume version: 3.1
Cluster size       : 4096 bytes

Multi-Record       :      8393 MB             9
You might resize at 7303708672 bytes or 7304 MB (freeing 67637 MB).
Please make a test run using both the -n and -s options before real resizing!
knoppix@4[knoppix]$
</pre>

<p>Rather than reducing the partition as far as possible, let's
follow that advice and see what it looks like if we leave some room
for data and the tool that has yet to be installed:</p>

<pre class="code">
root@0[knoppix]# ntfsresize --no-action --size 10G /dev/sda2
ntfsresize v1.9.4
NTFS volume version: 3.1
Cluster size       : 4096 bytes

The read-only test run ended successfully.
</pre>

<p>OK, go for it.</p>

<pre class="code">

IMPORTANT: When recreating the partition, make sure you
  1)  create it with the same starting disk cylinder
  2)  create it with the same partition type (usually 7, HPFS/NTFS)
  3)  do not make it smaller than the new NTFS filesystem size
  4)  set the bootable flag for the partition if it existed before
Otherwise you may lose your data or can't boot your computer from the disk!
root@0[knoppix]#   
</pre>

<p>Now that we have reduced the size of the area used within the
physical partition (comparable to de-frag under Windows, maybe) it
is safe to use cfdisk /dev/sda</p>

<pre class="code">

<p>This was the step where extreme care was called for. A mistake
with ntfsresize produces an error message or warning. To me the
partition table is comparable to the base register in some
assembler languages: something that cannot be verified, a promise,
not a guarantee. Mess it up and you may never be able to recover.
Pay very close attention to the changes you make and back out if
there is anything at all that you don't fully understand!</p>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>

<p>Once again, in the white hat, Linux wins! The backup was
unneeded, although I never would have continued without one.</p>

<p>When booted into Windows, it did whatever it is that it does
while it is doing what it does when one doesn't know what it is
doing. So that worked. I guess.</p>

<p>Creating the extended partition and a couple of logical
partitions inside it is quite straight-forward and doesn't deserve
further discussion here. Although I grew up with fdisk, I will
repeat the recommendation in the documentation to use cfdisk
instead. Interactive and keeping one apprised of current status, it
was very easy to get used to.</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>In retrospect it wasn't necessary to jump back and forth between
normal user and root as in the cut-and-paste from screens, above.
But there is a time and place for each. On more than one occasion I
have failed to notice that I had returned to a virtual terminal
with root privileges. Bad! The preferred idiom with Knoppix is
"sudo". You won't need a root password but it keeps you aware of
where you are and what you are doing.</p>

<p>After having gone through this exercise it occurred to me that a
better long-term solution might be to back up the Windows partition
as described after major changes, i.e. installation of the tool I
need. The other two as well of course, just in case something goes
wrong. And then when the time comes that the Windows partition
becomes unusable and restoring is necessary, just do it from the
network. That should make those other two partitions obsolete and
recover a bunch of disk space. Way down the road.</p>

<p>The modem is presumably one of those nefarious "winmodems". I
didn't check it out, ISDN currently, not analog. The network card
works without problem. And the Kensington Mouse at the USB port was
recognized by Knoppix off the starting blocks. It is really neat,
the cable winds up into it, to the length needed, from 0 to
whatever. I may even take it along when on the road.</p>

<p>The Dell hardware is actually very nice. If you could just get
it without having to pay for an operating system you normally don't
need...</p>
