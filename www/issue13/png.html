<H4>History of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format</H4>
by <A HREF="mailto:newt@pobox.com">Greg Roelofs</A>
</A>


<P>
<B>Prehistory</B>
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The Story of PNG actually begins way back in 1977 and 1978 when two Israeli
researchers, Jacob Ziv and Abraham Lempel, first published a pair of papers on
a new class of lossless data-compression algorithms, now collectively referred
to as ``LZ77'' and ``LZ78.''  Some years later, in 1983, Terry Welch of Sperry
(which later merged with Burroughs to form Unisys) developed a very fast
variant of LZ78 called LZW.  Welch also filed for a patent on LZW, as did two
IBM researchers, Victor Miller and Mark Wegman.  The result was...you guessed
it...the USPTO granted both patents (in December 1985 and March 1989,
respectively).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Meanwhile CompuServe--specifically, Bob Berry--was busily designing a new,
portable, compressed image format in 1987.  Its name was GIF, for ``Graphics
Interchange Format,'' and Berry et al. blithely settled on LZW as the
compression method.  Tim Oren, Vice President of Future Technology at
CompuServe (now with Electric Communities), wrote:  ``The LZW algorithm
was incorporated from an open publication, and without knowledge that Unisys
was pursuing a patent.  The patent was brought to our attention, much to our
displeasure, after the GIF spec had been published and passed into wide use.''
There are claims [1] that Unisys was made aware of this as early as 1989 and
chose to ignore the use in ``pure software''; the documents to substantiate
this claim have apparently been lost.  In any case, Unisys for years limited
itself to pursuit of hardware vendors--particularly modem manufacturers
implementing V.42bis in silicon.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
All of that changed at the end of 1994.  Whether due to ongoing financial
difficulties or as part of the industry-wide bonk on the head provided by
the World Wide Web, Unisys in 1993 began aggressively pursuing commercial
vendors of software-only LZW implementations.  CompuServe seems to have 
been its primary target at first, culminating in an agreement--quietly
announced on 28 December 1994, right in the middle of the Christmas
holidays--to begin collecting royalties from authors of GIF-supporting
software.  The spit hit the fan on the Internet the following week; what
was then the comp.graphics newsgroup went nuts, to use a technical term.
As is the way of Usenet, much ire was directed at CompuServe for making
the announcement, and then at Unisys once the details became a little
clearer; but mixed in with the noise was the genesis of an informal Internet
working group led by Thomas Boutell [2].  Its purpose was not only to design a
replacement for the GIF format, but a successor to it:  better, smaller,
more extensible, and FREE.


<P>
<B>The Early Days (All Seven of 'Em)</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The very first PNG draft--then called ``PBF,'' for Portable Bitmap Format--
was posted by Tom to comp.graphics, comp.compression and
comp.infosystems.www.providers on Wednesday, 4 January 1995.  It had a
three-byte signature, chunk numbers rather than chunk names, maximum pixel
depth of 8 bits and no specified compression method, but even at that stage
it had more in common with today's PNG than with any other existing format.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Within one week, most of the major features of PNG had been proposed, if
not yet accepted:  delta-filtering for improved compression (Scott Elliott);
deflate compression (Tom Lane, the Info-ZIP gang and many others); 24-bit
support (many folks); the PNG name itself (Oliver Fromme); internal CRCs
(myself); gamma chunk (Paul Haeberli) and 48- and 64-bit support (Jonathan
Shekter).  The first proto-PNG mailing list was also set up that week; Tom
released the second draft of the specification; and I posted some test results
that showed a 10% improvement in compression if GIF's LZW method was simply
replaced with the deflate (LZ77) algorithm.  Figure 1 is a timeline listing
many of the major events in PNG's history.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Perhaps equally interesting are some of the proposed features and design
suggestions that ultimately were <I>not</I> accepted:  the Amiga IFF format;
uncompressed bitmaps either gzip'd or stored inside zipfiles; thumbnail
images and/or generic multi-image support; little-endian byte order; Unicode
UTF-8 character set for text; YUV and other lossy image-encoding schemes; and
so forth.  Many of these topics produced an amazing amount of discussion--in
fact, the main proponent of the zipfile idea is still making noise two years
later.


<P>
<B>Onward, Frigidity</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
One of the real strengths of the PNG group was its ability to weigh the pros
and cons of various issues in a rational manner (well, most of the time,
anyway), reach some sort of consensus and then move on to the next issue 
without prolonging discussion on ``dead'' topics indefinitely.  In part this
was probably due to the fact that the group was relatively small, yet possessed
of a sufficiently broad range of graphics and compression expertise that no
one felt unduly ``shut out'' when a decision went against him.  (All of the
PNG authors were male.  Most of them still are.  I'm sure
there's a dissertation in there somewhere...)  But equally important was Tom
Boutell, who, as the initiating force behind the PNG project, held the role 
of benevolent dictator--much the way Linus Torvalds does with Linux kernel
development.  When consensus was impossible, Tom would make a decision, and
that would settle the matter.  (On one or two rare occasions he might later
have been persuaded to reverse the decision, but this generally only happened
if new information came to light.)

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In any case, the development model worked:  by the beginning of February 1995,
seven drafts had been produced, and the PNG format was settling down.  (The
PNG name was adopted in Draft 5.)  The next month was mainly spent working
out the details:  chunk-naming conventions, CRC size and placement, choice 
of filter types, palette-ordering, specific flavors of transparency and 
alpha-channel support, interlace method, etc.  CompuServe was impressed 
enough by the design that on the 7th of February they announced support for
PNG as the designated successor to GIF, supplanting what they had initially
referred to as the GIF24 development project. [3]  By the beginning of March,
PNG Draft 9 was released and the specification was officially frozen--just 
over two months from its inception.  Although further drafts followed, they 
merely added clarifications, some recommended behaviors for encoders and
decoders, and a tutorial or two.  Indeed, Glenn Randers-Pehrson has kept some
so-called ``paleo PNGs'' that were created at the time of Draft 9; they are
still readable by any PNG decoder today. [4]


<P>
<B>Oy, My Head Hurts</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But specifying a format is one thing; implementing it is quite another.
Although the original intent was to create a "lightweight" format--and,
compared to TIFF or even JPEG, PNG <I>is</I> fairly lightweight--even a 
completely orthogonal feature set can introduce substantial complications.
For example, consider progressive display of an image in a web browser.
First comes straight decoding of the compressed data; no problems there.
Then any line-filtering must be inverted to get the actual image data.
Oops, it's an interlaced image:  now pixels are appearing here and
there within each 8x8 block, so they must be rendered appropriately (and
possibly buffered).  The image also has transparency and is being overlaid
on a background image, adding a bit more complexity.  So far we're not much
worse off than we would be with an interlaced, transparent GIF; the line
filters and 2D interlacing scheme are pretty straightforward extensions to
what programmers have already dealt with.  Even adding gamma correction to
the foreground image isn't too much trouble.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But wait, it's not just simple transparency; we have an alpha channel!  And
we don't want sparse display--we really like the replicating progressive
method Netscape Navigator uses.  Now things are tricky:  each replicated
pixel-block has some percentage of the fat foreground pixel mixed in with
complementary amounts of the background pixels in the block.  And just
because the current fat pixel is 65% transparent (or, even worse, completely
opaque) doesn't mean later ones in the same block will be, too:  thus we have
to remember all of the original background pixel-values until their final 
foreground pixels are composited and overlaid.  Toss in the ability to render
all of this nicely on an 8-bit, colormapped display, and most programmers'
heads will explode.


<P>
<B>Make It So!</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Of course, some of these things are application (presentation or front-end)
issues, not general PNG-decoding (back-end) issues.  Nevertheless, a good 
PNG library should allow for the possibility of such applications--which is
another way of saying that it should be general enough not to place undue 
restrictions on any programmer who wants to implement such things.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Once Draft 9 was released, many people set about writing PNG encoders
and/or decoders.  The true glory is really reserved for three people,
however: Info-ZIP's Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler (both also of gzip fame),
who originally wrote Zip's deflate() and UnZip's inflate() routines and
then, for PNG, rewrote them as a portable library called <I>zlib</I> [5]; and Guy
Eric Schalnat of Group 42, who almost single-handedly wrote the <I>libpng</I>
reference implementation (originally ``pnglib'') from scratch. [6]  The
first truly usable versions of the libraries were released two months after
Draft 9, on the first of May, 1995.  Although both libraries were missing
some features required for full implementation, they were sufficiently
complete to be used in various freeware applications.  (Draft 10 of the
specification was released at the same time, with clarifications resulting
from these first implementations.)


<P>
<B>Fast-Forward to the Present</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The pace of subsequent developments slowed at that point.  This was partly
due to the fact that, after four months of intense development and dozens of
e-mail messages every day, everyone was burned out; partly because Guy
controlled libpng's development and became busy with other things at work;
and partly because of the perception that PNG was basically ``done.''  The
latter point was emphasized by a CompuServe press release to that effect in
mid-June (and one, I might add, in which their PR guys claimed much of the
credit for PNG's development, sigh).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Nevertheless, progress continued.  In June of 1995 I set up the PNG home page,
now grown to roughly a dozen pages [7]; Kevin Mitchell officially registered
the ``PNGf'' Macintosh file ID with Apple Computer.  In August Alexander 
Lehmann and Willem van Schaik released a fine pair of additions to the NetPBM
image-manipulation suite, particularly handy under Linux:  pnmtopng and
pngtopnm version 2.0.  And in December at the Fourth International World Wide
Web Conference, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released the PNG
Specification version 0.92 as an official standards-track Working Draft.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
1996 saw the February release of version 0.95 as an Internet Draft by the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), followed in July by the Internet
Engineering Steering Group's (IESG) approval of version 1.0 as an official
Informational RFC.  (However, the IETF secretary still hasn't issued the 
actual RFC number at the time of this writing, five months later.  Sigh.)
The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) Architecture Group in early
August adopted PNG as one of the two required image formats for minimal
VRML 2.0 conformance. [8]  Meanwhile the W3C promoted the spec to Proposed
Recommendation status in July and then to full Recommendation status on the
first of October. [9]  Finally, in mid-October the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) formally approved ``image/png'' as an official Internet
Media Type, joining image/gif and image/jpeg as non-experimental image
formats for the Web.  Much of this standardization would not have happened
nearly as quickly without the tireless efforts of Tom Lane and Glenn
Randers-Pehrson, who took over editing duties of the spec from Thomas Boutell.


<P>
<B>Current Status</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
So where are we today?  The future is definitely bright for PNG, and the
present isn't looking too bad, either.  I now have over 125 applications
listed [10] with PNG support either current or planned (mostly current); 
among the ones available for Linux are:

<UL>
	<LI>XV (image viewer/converter)
	<LI>ImageMagick (image viewer/converter)
	<LI>GRAV (image viewer)
	<LI>Zgv (image viewer)
	<LI>xli (image viewer)
	<LI>XPaint (image editor)
	<LI>The GIMP (image editor)
	<LI>Image Alchemy (image converter)
	<LI>pnmtopng/pngtopnm (image converters)
	<LI>XEmacs (editor/web browser/operating system/etc.)
	<LI>gforge (fractal terrain generator)
	<LI>Fractint (fractal generator)
	<LI>Ghostscript (PostScript viewer/converter)
	<LI>GNUplot (plotting program)
	<LI>PV-WAVE (scientific visualization program)
	<LI>POV-Ray (ray-tracer)
	<LI>VRweb (VRML browser)
	<LI>X Mosaic (web browser)
	<LI>Arena (web browser)
	<LI>Chimera (web browser)
	<LI>Grail (web browser)
	<LI>Amaya (web browser/editor)
	<LI>Mapedit (image-map editor)
	<LI>WWWis (HTML IMG sizer)
	<LI>file(1) (Unix file-type identifier)
</UL>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Discerning readers will note the conspicuous absence of Netscape Navigator.
Despite the fact that Netscape was aware of the PNG project from the 
beginning and unofficially indicated ``probable support''; despite the nice
benefits gamma correction, alpha support and 2D interlacing bring to WWW
applications; despite the fact that the WWW Consortium, of which Netscape is
a member, released the PNG spec as its first official Recommendation; despite
the requirement to support PNG in VRML 2.0 viewers like Netscape's own Live3D
plug-in; and despite considerable pestering by members of the PNG group and
the Internet community at large, Netscape is still only ``considering'' future
support of PNG.  Until Netscape either supports PNG natively or gets swept
away by Microsoft or someone else, PNG's usefulness as an image format for 
the Web is considerably diminished.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
On the other hand, our buds at Microsoft recognized the benefits of PNG and
apparently embraced it wholeheartedly.  They have not only made it the native
image format of the Office97 application suite but have also repeatedly
promised to put it into Internet Explorer (theoretically by the time of the
4.0 betas--we'll see about that).  Assuming they do, Netscape is almost
certain to follow suit.  (See?  Microsoft <I>is</I> good for something!)  At
that point PNG should enjoy a real burst of WWW interest and usage.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the meantime, PNG viewing actually is possible with Linux Netscape; it's
just not very useful.  Rasca Gmelch is working on a Unix plug-in with (among
other things) PNG support.  Although it's still an alpha version and requires
ImageMagick's <B>convert</B> utility to function, that's not the problem; Netscape's
brain-damaged plug-in architecture is.  Plug-ins have no effect on HTML's
IMG tag:  if there's no native support for the image format and no helper
app defined, the image is ignored regardless of whether an installed plug-in
supports it.  Instead you must use Netscape's EMBED extension.  That means
anyone who wants universally viewable web pages loses either way:  PNG with
IMG doesn't work under Netscape, and PNG with EMBED doesn't work under much
of anything except Netscape and MSIE (and those only if the user has installed
a working PNG plug-in).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
But support by five or six other Linux web browsers ain't bad, and even
mainstream applications like Adobe's Photoshop now do PNG natively.  More
are showing up every week, too.  Life is good.


<P>
<B>The Future</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
As VRML takes off--which it almost certainly will, especially with the 
advent of truly cheap, high-performance 3D accelerators--PNG will go along
for the ride.  (JPEG, which is the other required VRML 2.0 image format,
doesn't support transparency.)  Graphic artists will use PNG as an intermediate
format because of its lossless 24-bit (and up) compression and as a final
format because of its ability to store gamma and chromaticity information for
platform-independence.  Once the ``big-name'' browsers support PNG natively,
users will adopt it as well--for the 2D interlacing method, the cross-platform
gamma correction, and the ability to make anti-aliased balls, buttons, text
and other graphic elements that look good on *any* color background (no more
``ghosting,'' thanks to the alpha-channel support).

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Indeed, the only open issue is support for animations and other multi-image
applications.  In retrospect, the principal failure of the PNG group was its
delay in extending PNG to MNG, the "Multi-image Network Graphics" format.
As noted earlier, everyone was pretty burned out by May 1995; in fact, it
was a full year before serious discussion of MNG resumed.  As (bad) luck
would have it, October 1995 is when the first Netscape 2.0 betas arrived
with animation support, giving the (dying?) GIF format a huge resurgence
in popularity.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
At the time of this writing (mid-December 1996), the MNG specification has
undergone some 27 drafts--almost entirely written by Glenn Randers-Pehrson--and
is close to being frozen.  A couple of special-purpose MNG implementations have
been written, as well.  But MNG is too late for the VRML 2.0 spec, and despite
some very compelling features, it may never be perceived as anything more than
PNG's response to GIF animations.  Time will tell.


<P>
<B>At Last...</B>

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It's always difficult for an insider to render judgment on a project like
PNG; that old forest-versus-trees thing tends to get in the way of objectivity.
But it seems to me that the PNG story, like that of Linux, represents the
best of the Internet:  international cooperation, rapid development and the
production of a Good Thing that is not only useful but also freely available
for everyone to enjoy.

<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Then again, maybe I'm just a shameless egotist (nyuk nyuk nyuk).  You
decide....

of it is particularly relevant to planetary research.  Go figure.)
