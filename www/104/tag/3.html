I'm having some difficulty getting my CD player to play through my
speakers.  I have a Dell Dimension 2350 running <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 9. I got this
Red Hat 9 by downloading the ISOs from the Red Hat site. When I bring up
the saw CD player, the screen comes up, I can see the elapsed time tick
by, but there is no sound coming from my speakers. I can plug into the
headphone jack on the CD drive and get sound.

The problem is probably the fact that there's actually two ways to play CDs.
One way is for the software to just tell the CD drive to start playing: The
sound will play in the little jack on every CD drive in existance that nobody
ever uses anyway. There's also supposed to be a cable running from the CD
drive to the soundcard inside a computer, which is how things work normally.

While this is true, this is only applicable if you're using a CD-Player
that extracts sound using analog. While most do, Windows applications
don't (Media-Player being an example). For the case of laptops, sound is
extracted using raw audio.

So the sound never actually gets to the software. And in this case, the sound
never actually gets to the sound card because a connection is obviously
missing on your laptop.

<blockQuote>
The other way to play CDs is read the CD "raw" and then just send the sound to
the sound card.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Some software tries to do it one way, some the other.

Try this:

<blockquote><pre>$ play -t cdr /dev/hdc

Thanks. Jason's explanation of the two ways to play CDs clears up a lot
of confusion. I have succeeded in getting my CD to play thru my speakers
(with xmms, not the CD player that comes up with RED Hat -&gt; Sound &amp;
Video -&gt; CD Player).

I have not yet taken the skins off of my Dell Dimension 2350 (this is
not a laptop as some thought, but Dell's low end tower, a 2 GHz P4) but
will do so after the mail I got. Just to check the cable people have
referred to. From what I read so far I think my sound card is integrated
on my motherboard and not actually a separate card. The RedHat Hardware
browser says 82801DB AC'97 Audio, Mfg Intel, Driver i810_audio.

	> [Thomas] i810_audio is courtesy of Intel and probably at the time this was

there (or should I say embedded chip) but it does the job quite well.

I issued a play -t cdr <TT>/dev/cdrom</TT> and a play -t <TT>/mnt/cdrom</TT> and got no
response at all.

This is because "<TT>/mnt/cdrom</TT>" in this context doesn't point to anything.
One does not mount audio CDs and so the actual device (<TT>/dev/cdrom</TT>) must be
used.

From the information there I downloaded xmms-cdread-0.14a.tar.gz from
<A HREF="ftp://mud.stack.nl/pub/OuterSpace/willem"
	>ftp://mud.stack.nl/pub/OuterSpace/willem</A>, unzipped, untarred, built and
installed. I am now listening to CD output thru my speakers!

This method is still using audio-extraction which often makes the CD-ROM
drive spin around very fast. This can be quite noisy, especially on
laptops.

All is not perfect, however. If I put in a new CD, the default CD player
starts up automatically. This player does not work and never has. I have
clicked on preferences for this player (the knife and fork icon) in an
attempt to not have it load automatically. I specified no action on CD

You don't say what window/desktop manager you're using, but if I recall
correctly. RH9 uses <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> as the default desktop manager. It's possible
that the settings were/are not saved until you logged out...

load; but it still comes up and tries to play when I load a new CD. I
see the elapsed time tick by and get no sound thru the speakers. I have
to kill this player and bring up xmms, click on play, and then all is
well.

This comes back to what Jason and I said earlier about how audio is
extracted. Since XMMS defaults to using Raw audio, and other players use
analog, without the use of such a cable, you just won't hear any sound.
