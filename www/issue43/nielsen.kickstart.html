<h1> What is Kickstart?</h1>
<p>
One note, 
I think it would be a good
if someone made a follow-up article for other Linux distributions. I would
be more than happy to help. 

<p>
KickStart for RedHat makes it so you can do a quick installation of RedHat 6.0
without having to go through all the installation menus. It automates it
for you from start to finish (assuming nothing goofs up in between). This
is handy for multiple installations. 
All
you have to do is create a "ks.cfg" file on the RedHat 6.0 boot disk. Then
boot off of the disk, type in the command "linux ks=floppy" on the first screen, 
and if you are lucky, when it starts the installation process, it should
be able to grab that file and do the whole installation for you. 
<p>
Here are the key points you need to be aware of, 
<ol>
<li> If you don't have a bootdisk for RedHat 6.0, you need to make one. 
Either use "rawrite" that comes on a RedHat 6.0 cd while in DOS, or mount the
cd in Linux and assuming you mounted the cd at /mnt/cdrom and you have
a floppy disk in (that doesn't have anything important on it), 
     <br> cd /mnt/cdrom/images
     <br> dd if=boot.img of=/dev/fd0
     <br> ## OR if you are installing off the net
     <br> dd if=bootnet.img of=/dev/fd0
<li> The RedHat 6.0 boot disk is formatted as an msdos disk, thus you can
   copy the "ks.cfg" file to it in Windoze or in Linux. If you need to
   mount the floppy disk in Linux, try, 
   <br> mkdir -p /mnt/floppy
   <br> mount -t msdos /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy    
<li> Kickstart can be installed using a cdrom, over the net through 
ftp or nfs, and for multiple computers you can use DHCP. It has other features
as well. For this example, we will use a static ip addresses. 
<li> It is assumed we are using standard IDE hard drives and cdroms. If you
have SCSI devices, or other weird devices, you will have to modify the
kickstart file so that it will work. 
<li> Something weird happened on one of my installs. After installing
RedHat 60, I tried to do an upgrade and somehow it found over 100 megs
of programs to install as an upgrade even though I didn't do anything to
the system. Weird. I did it again, and it installed 115 packages which
had a total of 112 megs. I don't think it had to install those rpms again, 
but that it was an automatic thing with the upgrade option , whether or 
not you have those
rpms installed.  
</ol>

<a name="Gripes"></a>
<h1> Gripes and Complaints</h1>
Well, I have some gripes and complaints. Overall, the kickstart disk is pretty
cool and has improved since 5.2, but still, it seems a little braindead
or it doesn't give you the absolute power you need sometimes.
I want the ability to shoot myself in the foot if I want to. It might sound
weird, but here are my points:
 
<ol>
<li> I couldn't find a "select all rpms" option. This makes it annoying
   since I have to list all the rpms. Perhaps I was blind, but I
   didn't find that option.
<li> I can't tell it to force a graphics card and monitor settings with
    a certain resolution. This is annoying. Xconfigurator doesn't work
    for me half the time, and I need to configure Xwindows after an
    installation. An easy way to do this, in a manual installation, 
is to set the computer to 
    VGA 16 and to install the drivers for the true card later. If you
    set it to VGA 16 and it thinks it is something else, kickstart will 
    error and stop the installation process and ask you for more info.
<li> I wish I could force the name of the computer so that it doesn't 
   stop and ask you what the name of the computer should be if it doesn't
   find it in the DNS server. I would like the ability to shoot myself
   in the foot and put in incorrect settings just because I want to. 
<li> It is pretty stupid about making Linux partitions. It only wants
   to see one primary partition and to put everything else into 
   logical partitions. This is silly especially in multi-boot systems.
   It just grabs the rest of the hard drive space after the primary
   partition and puts it all into one extended partition. I would like
   the ability to specify primary or logical partitions. 
   It would be
   nice if someone were to help make it so you can create a script
   which would automate the commands for fdisk. Perhaps there is
   and I just don't know about it.  

<li> Is there a way to tell it to use a partition that is already defined?
   It seems as though it only can use the partitions that it creates. It
   would be nice if I could define the partitions ahead of time, 
   and in the kickstart disk tell it which partitions go to which
   directories.    
</ol> 

Don't get me wrong, kickstart is a cool way of doing things, I just would
like to see it brought to a different level where it is "very" cool. Cool =
give me all the power to shoot myself in the foot just so I can see what
happens. A little bit of pain never hurts anyone. Also, I am not a real
expert at Kickstart, so perhaps I just didn't catch some of the options I 
am griping about. I have only been using it for about 2 months at the time
of this document.

<h1> Cdrom upgrade example</h1>
<p>
Copy what is between the lines to a file called "ks.cfg" to your boot disk. 
Then, when you get to the
first screen of the Linux installation, type "linux ks=floppy". Also, 
before you do this, make sure the BIOS in your computer is set to boot 
off of the floppy drive.  

<br>

<pre>
#         Copy this file as "ks.cfg" to the boot disk that comes with
#		RedHat 6.0. Or make your own boot disk. Anyways, the
#		 bootdisk is formatted msdos, so you can use a Windows	
#		computer to copy this file to it. Also, when the prompt
#		comes up after you boot off of the floppy disk, type
#		linux ks=floppy
#		and press enter. 

#  This is just the configuration you need to do an upgrade using a cdrom.

<a name="ftp"></a>
<h1> An installation over ftp</h1>
<p>

Well, this configuration uses ftp, and if you wanted to use nfs,
 you could comment
the ftp option and uncomment the nfs option. All you need is a floppy
drive and a network card. Makes things a little easier if you can cut
out a cdrom drive in each of your computers. Also, use a 100 mbit network.
My installations using ftp were actually faster than installing off of
the cdrom when I had a 100 mbit network. A 40 speed cdrom still isn't as
good as a fast network with a few computers. A 100 mbit hub is really
cheap these days.

<h1> Conclusion -- it is good</h1>
I think the RedHat Kickstart stuff is good. I never did find out if the 
other distributions have it, didn't have enough time. Oh well. It still needs
a lot of work to make it a really cool way of doing installations. The
problem is, instead of just bitching about it, if it needs work, and you like
it, contribute to the cause and help develop kickstart for RedHat or for
any other Linux distribution. I wrote this article, now, you 
help out and contact the RedHat folks or other people to make the process
even more cool!
<p>
Overall, I give Kickstart method a "B" for 6.0, and a "C" for the 5.2
version. It is cool compared to the corrupted commercial alternative which
forces you to reboot 10 times before it is done installing. The potential
for Linux is amazing compared to commercial closed sourced alternatives.
When software is written not because of profit but because it is cool
and/or because people want it done right, 
the long term potential far outweighs the short-term
profit-minded mentality of people who cannot write good software 
or who just
want things done "just to get it to work". Kickstart has the potential to
reduce the overall cost of consulting and the time it takes to install Linux
systems on a mass scale (which benefits the novice and expert
 computer consultant). It is funny to watch commercial companies who are
trying to emulate what Linux and other UNIX systems can do. I see commercial
products out there which attempt to do mass installations for closed
sourced corrupted operating systems and I laugh at all the hard work they
have to do. I want to stress something, this method I have shown today
is not the easiest method to install Linux. I will explain this in 
another article someday. It will make any commercial or closed sourced
operating system look like garbage compared to Linux.

<a name="script"></a>
<h1> My perl script</h1>

I used this perl script to extract a list of rpms from the /RedHat/RPMS
directory on the cdrom. I only had about 6 corrections to make and figured
it would take me longer to fix the perl script that it would be to fix
the list. There has to be a simpler way of getting the list with exact
results, but often
it is just a decision between what you know works, and taking the time
to figure out a better way. It only took me 5 minutes to write this 
script. Most of the time wasted was booting off of the kickstart disk
to see how many errors I got.    

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

my @RPMS = &lt;/home/ftp/RedHat60/RedHat/RPMS/*.rpm&gt;;
my $Dest = "/tmp/List_2.txt";

open(FILE,">$Dest");

foreach $Rpm (@RPMS)
  {
    ## Would be easier if I had used ? instead of /
  $Rpm =~ s/\/home\/ftp\/RedHat60\/RedHat\/RPMS\///;

  if ($Rpm =~ /\-[0-9]+\-[0-9]+\./) 
    {($Rpm,$Junk) = split(/\-[0-9]+\-[0-9]\./, $Rpm,2);}
  elsif ($Rpm =~ /\-[0-9]+\./) 
    {($Rpm,$Junk) = split(/\-[0-9]+\./, $Rpm,2);}
  else {($Rpm,$Junk) = split(/\-[0-9]/, $Rpm,2);}

  print FILE "$Rpm\n";
  }
</pre>
