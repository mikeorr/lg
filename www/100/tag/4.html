	>Updating Libc and Gcc Support on Older Distros?</H3>


<p><strong>From Steve 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>

<p align="right"><strong>Answered By:  Thomas Adam, Ben Okopnik
</strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
I have an old Pentium I (166Mhz) that runs <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.0 beautifully.
I will run SuSE 9.0, but it is ponderously slow, so I went back
to 7.0.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have wanted to update my browser (among other things), but find
that support is needed for the above captioned pieces from later
releases.  I have asked the question on various boards and chat
lines but have not gotten any definitive answers.  The most
complete answer I received was "don't".  It seems that updating
library and compiler support are risky, but it seems to me that
is has to be possible.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there any advice or specific information you can give me about
this?  My old copy of Netscape 4.76 is really out of date and
crashes on a lot of modern sites.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks in advance for your help.
</STRONG></P>

My answer also is "don't". Attempting to upgrade libc and gcc without
doing the rest of the distribution is fatal. <EM>Everything</EM> you run depends
on those set of core libraries whether implicitly or not.

Remember that if you did upgrade libc then all your programs wouldn't work
since the version that they were compiled against is now at an older
version than the one you have installed.

In short, do a full update of SuSE.

My take on it is a bit milder than that - I've done libc, etc. upgrades
and survived them just fine, although I have to give most of the credit
to <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>'s dependency-resolution mechanism. It's not "fatal" as such
because the calls supported by libc aren't going to change - there may
be new ones added, but the old ones aren't generally going to go away
without a whole lot of lead time. If you do the upgrade correctly,
everything will continue to work fine; if that wasn't the case, old
Linux software wouldn't work at all - and I've run some quite ancient
binaries that worked happily and without a glitch.

However, I do agree with Thomas that it's a pretty big undertaking and
many things <em>  can  </em> break, explode, and fly off the handle if you do it
wrong; doing a full distro upgrade (after, of course, backing up your
data for safety's sake) is really the best way to go.
