Hello Gang!!!
Thanks and congratulations for your good work!!!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm Santiago (santyx), from San Rafael-Mendoza-Argentina.
I don't speak English very well, but I hope you understand my question.
I'm working in a LAN in my University and I've installed a <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux 7.1
in my work station (puesto17).
The LAN looks like this:
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/map-university-network.txt">map-university-network.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
Where SANRAFAEL is a WINDOWS NT server for the 192.168.2.X subnet and CHARLY
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
is a <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> LINUX server for the 192.168.1.X subnet.
SANRAFAEL is connected to the Internet, and allowing all the work stations
in
the network to connect to the Internet too, with a proxy software.
As you see, I don't have a direct connection to the Internet from puesto17.
I can do "ping" to 192.168.1.X or 192.168.2.X, but I can't do "ping", for
example, to <A HREF="http://www.argentina.com"
	>http://www.argentina.com</A> if I want.
I can do "traceroute" to 192.168.1.X or 192.168.2.X, but I can't do
"traceroute", for example, to <A HREF="http://www.hotmail.com"
	>http://www.hotmail.com</A> if I want.
I can do "ftp" to 192.168.1.X or 192.168.2.X, but I can't do "ftp", for
example, to my ISP to upload web pages if I want.
I can't connect to the News Servers in the Internet and I can't use my pop3
mail server from my work station.
I can't go out of my network!!!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Which is the best way to change this?
Can I change this from my Linux box?
Or the only way is changing the things in the SANRAFAEL Server?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I really need a solution, specially for the FTP, since I'm working in a web
site for my University.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks in advance!!!.
Santyx.
</STRONG></P>

Hi, Santyx -
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It sounds like SANRAFAEL is running a firewall that's blocking (at
least) ports 7 (echo), 21 (ftp), 110 (pop), and 119 (nntp). Your system
administrator would have to open those for you.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Another possibility, depending on how your proxy is set up, is that you
might also be able to get out through that proxy. To do that, you'd have to
define some environment variables:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre># Most programs want this in lowercase, but there are some that want it
# capitalized!
export http_proxy=http://x.x.x.x:y
export HTTP_PROXY=http://x.x.x.x:y
export ftp_proxy=http://x.x.x.x:y
export FTP_PROXY=http://x.x.x.x:y
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
'x.x.x.x' is the IP address of the proxy; 'y' is the proxy port.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Note that the "http://" part of the proxy location stays the same
even when you're defining an FTP proxy. Strange, but that's how it
works.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Again, this is only a possibility; you'd have to discuss the setup with
your system administrator to be sure.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [K.-H.] 
If that NT box is only running a proxy service for http that's all you get.
If on the other hand machines off sanrafael (IP probably 192.168.2.X ) have
full access (including ping, outside pop accounts, ftp,...) the NT box seems
to run a port-forwarding firewall ... or maybe merely ip masquerading...
and you should basically be able to do the
same -- <EM>IF</EM> the NT box is offering the service for 192.168.1.X.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
What happens if you do all your tests from Charly?  Charly probably also
has no internet connection  (besides the http proxy).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Also for ftp through firewall make sure you run ftp in "passive" mode. For
ftp originally the server was opening a connection back to your client on a
different port -- which usually fails for through firewalls (so might not
fail with recent firewall port masquerading).
On a "recent" *nix ftp client typing "passive" before trying to "ls" or
get/put will do.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But I guess (like Ben) that the NT box is blocking you.
</blockQuote>

	> [John K.] 
Do you have DNS referencing (i.e., etc/resolve.conf) setup on CHARLY?
As K-H mentioned, it would seem that IP masquerading should be set up on
CHARLY if it isn't already.  You need to have the packets from the
192.168.2 subnet appear as 192.168.1 subnet packets to get the same
treatment from the NT server for the .2 subnet as it gives to the .1
subnet.

Hello Gang!!!
Santyx again.
Thanks for your answers about "A LAN Question"
The net admin of my University made the changes in the sanrafael server,
and now I can do telnet from
my work station, but I can't do FTP.
When I connect to sanrafael doing FTP from Linux the proxy answer well,
the connection is done.
But the commands don't answer and I got to kill the connection from another
console.
It doesn't happens from windows.
</STRONG></P>

Try the same FTP connection using a web browser (even lynx, the
venerable text-mode curses or w3m, a newer curses mode browser).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If that works than you probably have a problem with your firewall
(or packet filters) that rejects "active" mode FTP connections.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In FTP the session you establish is a control channel, it's used to
send your FTP client's commands (you say "get" and your client changes
that to RETR, you say "ls" and your client sends 'LIST' or 'NLIST',
or whatever).   The response codes (numeric and text) are also returned
on this control channel (which is on destination port 21 on the server
from some unprivileged port on your client host).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In active FTP the FTP server attempts to create a data connection for
each stream of data that you get.  That includes each file that you
fetch, of course.  However it also includes connections for directory
listings.  The problem is that most firewalls and packet filters block
inbound connections (from the FTP server back towards your client) on
low numbered (privileged) ports.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
With passive FTP the client specifies a non-privileged port (greater than
1024) for the data channels.  The back channel is still inbound from the
server back to the client.  The difference is that the client specificies
an available port (by sending a PORT command over the control connection).
That works with most packet filter configurations and firewalls.  However,
it won't necessarily work with all of them.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In most FTP clients you can set passive mode by typing a command like
"quote pasv" (in ncftp you can use the command "set passive").
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If a web browser works using an ftp://.... url, then passive mode from
your FTP client should work as well.  Most web browsers default to
passive mode.  If passive mode doesn't work, then you may need to use
a proxy system.  I won't go into details on those --- you'd be best
checking with your local system/network administrator if you think you
need that.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Occasionally I've found other causes for the situation you describe.
However, they are much less likely.  In one case I found that it was
related to MTU (maximum transmission units).  Web and other traffic would
work, but FTP data connections would fail (apparently because it was
more likely to use maximum sized packets --- due to its socket options).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I doubt you'll encounter this sort of problem.

I got another question.
It's about GNU Grub.
I've installed the 0.92 version to load win98 and Red Hat Linux 7.1
Everithing goes O.K, but I want to make a graphic menu and I can't.
I put the following line in the menu.lst to show a graphic file
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>splashimage=3D(hd0,1)/boot/grub/fun.xpm.gz
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Where (hd0,1) is the Linux partition and <TT>/boot/grub/fun.xpm.gz</TT> is the path
of the graphic file.
The image is 640x480, 4 colors.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But nothig happens.
How can I make my own menu for Grub?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks again.

RedHat'S GRUB version has a splashimage patch applied. It can read XPM's
and display them. The patch and a vga-16 patch are available on the net
for GRUB 0.91, but not part of the standard GRUB package. So you have to
hunt down a patch for 0.92, apply and rebuild.
