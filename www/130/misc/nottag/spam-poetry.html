<h2 class="title">Spam Poetry</h2>
<!-- Date: Sat, 10 Jun 2006 10:39:41 -0400 -->
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Once in a while, I actually glance at the content of the spam that I
get, just to stay current with what the idiots are doing. Since these
days, they tend to throw in a bunch of random verbiage to confuse spam
filters (not that this affects Spamassassin :), I'm sometimes rewarded
with abstract poetry like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
near-by novel-crazed paper carrier olive gnat parcel-divine
n-dimensional one-piece patchouli oil Middle west oil-fired
paper stainer one-pipe mummy brown murmur diphthong
pauper-fed oyster agaric opossum tree mora hair mighty-spirited
passenger car oak blight
oblique-angled orange orchard passage-free
oyster fork oxyhydrogen blowpipe Paleo-american night-tripping night
raven os magnum moon-crowned pale-looking paper birch opening bit
Parma red out-group moon-born
out-of-school office-seeking ninety-ninth orange-hued needle fir
nimble will pea flower out-of-towner oil gland
one-lunged needle spar passion-wasted oil gauge middle-shot wheel New
years eve nose pipe moose elm Michaelmas sitting page gauge mui-tsai
mint camphor Pan-celticism
opium-smoking pain-fearing pea blight out-of-turn Middle high german
night parrot neural axis never-lasting mis-con
one-word New thoughtist Mid-april morning campion paper-whiteness
paving roller paddle shaft
pantechnicon van passage grave Neo-punic
mist-blotted obturator fascia money-mad multiple-toothed oat-crushing
neat-fingered object matter naked-flowered
</pre>
<p>Isn't that lovely? Absent the spam content (a link), it could actually
be seen as somebody's attempt at real abstract poetry. Hell, I've seen
lots worse done on purpose. :)</p>

Yeah, i get that too...</p>
<p>Here's one my filter caught (missing just the pic that was to cover up
the text, i guess)</p>

<p>I wonder if it's a part of someone's abstract poetry?</p>
<p><strong>[Jason]</strong>
I suspect it's generated by Markov chains (or something similar) from
some large corpus like, e.g., project Gutenburg texts.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Hmmm, possible.</p>

this process.</p>

By the way, Ben, have you been to Canada recently?  If so, I think you
may have dropped a pair of sunglasses by my place...</p>

In fact, Ben and I are in Montreal right now!

Anyone with hot tips about what to do/see/(and most importantly) EAT in this lovely 
city please speak up! -->

Just for the heck of it, I fed that through Danny O'Brien's found-haiku
(yeah, senryu) Perl script.  Here are some of the better works of
literature that result:</p>
