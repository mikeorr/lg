Linux&reg; Trademark Resolution
</H3>
<P> 

<b>Ownership of Linux&reg; Trademark Resolved</b>

<p>Monterey, California, August 20, 1997 - A long standing dispute over
ownership of the Linux&reg; operating system trademark has been resolved.
As a result of litigation brought by a group of five Linux companies and
individuals against William R. Della Croce, Jr. of Boston, Massachusetts,
Della Croce has assigned ownership for the registered mark to Linux Torvalds,
the original author of Linux, as part of the a settlement agreement.

<p>The plaintiffs in the suit were Linus Torvalds; specialized Systems Systems
Consultants, Inc. (the <I>Linux Journal</I> of Seattle; Yggdrasil computing,
Inc. in San Jose; Linux International, Amherst, NH; and Work Group
Solutions of Aurora, CO. Non-plaintiffs Red Hat Software, Inc., Metrolink
Inc., and Digital Equipment Corporation supported the litigation and
contributed to the cost of the litigation.

<p>The five plaintiffs brought suit against Della Croce in the U.S. Trademark
Trial and Appeals Board, in November 1996. Della Croce had obtained
registration of the Linux mark in September 1995, which created a storm of
protests by the Linux community, who felt the mark belonged to Torvalds or
the Linux community and not to any individual. In an attempt to correct the
situation, the plaintiffs retained the internationally known intellectual
property law firm of Davis & Schroeder of Monterey, California, who handled
the case on a greatly reduced fee bases, as a service to the Linux
community.

<p>The five plaintiffs, through their attorneys, announced that (1) the
matter has been settled by the assignment of the mark to Linus Torvalds, on
behalf of all Petitioners and Linux users, and the dismissal with prejudice
of the pending PTO Cancellation Proceeding; and (2) that Respondent was
reimbursed for his trademark filing fees and costs by Petitioners. The other
terms of the Settlement Agreement are confidential.

<p>All inquiries should be referred to Petitioners' law firm, Davis &
Schroeder at 408-649-1122 or by email at <a href="mailto:ggd@iplawyers.com">ggd@iplawyers.com</a>. A copy of the
original Cancellation Petition filed in the TTAB, can be found at

Linux Aptitude Test
</H3>


<p>There is a project which is trying to establish a quantitative measure 
to assist in determining a person's knowledge and general usefulness in Linux
setup, configuration, and maintenance. The project is aiming to create a
test that can be used to assess an employee's strenths and general
understanding of Linux.

The Hawkeye Project
</H3>
<P> 


<p>"Hawkeye" is the name of a new Linux Web server program, which has recently
been released to the public.
IT is an Internet/Intranet server suite, implementing 
Internet protocols for information interchange. 
A short list of the most important functions of Hawkeye: 
<ul>
<li>HTTP 1.0 Server, HTTP 1.1 coming soon
<li>POP3 / SMTP Server (E-Mail) 
<li>NNTP Server (Newsgroups) 
<li>FTP Server (File area) 
</ul>

<p>Hawkeye is running under the LINUX operating system and requires the
Linux SQL database MySQL <a href="http://www.tcx.se/">http://www.tcx.se/</a>.
Hardware requirements are much like what you would need to build a
normal Linux system. For optimal performance, we recommend a Pentium
machine withat least 16 Megabytes of RAM. Hawkeye itself uses very
little Harddisk space, so the size depends mainly on your site.
