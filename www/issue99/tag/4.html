Try disabling acpi. In my laptop, if I move the mouse and kde wants to look
what the battery status is the mouse jumps all over the place. Maybe yours
is worse.
append acpi=off should do the trick.

Interestingly enough, ACPI is what works here, while APM doesn't. I've
had to install the entire ACPI kit'n'kaboodle (kernel recompilation,
userland stuff) and remove APM to make it work. Don't have suspend going
yet, but all the other power management stuff works.

ACPI overrides APM in its functions and callings. On my laptop it works
rather well, and coupled with swsusp is a dream to suspend to disk.

A kernel compilation is again going to have to ensue, but afterwards, you
can do cool things like:

That does look pretty cool... however, I'm not really all that wild
about having to maintain a stable of patches. I might do it anyway - I
really want that "suspend to swap" feature - but it just seems like an
annoying thing to have to remember in addition to the kernel upgrades.

Radeon Mobility 9200 (9M+). New enough that "pci.ids" in the 2.6 kernel
(I had to upgrade - just moving the mouse (Synaptics touchpad) would
completely lock the machine with 2.4.22!) doesn't have it yet, although
the folks that actually maintain "pci.ids" already have it. I'd tried,
several times, to use the "experimental" xfree86 server, which
supposedly can handle it via the "ati" driver, but no luck - so I'm
stuck with the proprietary ATI driver. However, I'm a lot happier with
that than Dell's nVidia; at least I know that in a year at most, ATI
will release the interface.

There are four partitions on the new machine's HD: Wind0ws C:, Wind0ws
D:, "suspend", and... ready for this?... Linux. I kid you not.  This
gadget has what's called "EFI", which I just happened to read about the
day before I bought it by pure coincidence (I had no idea that this
machine would have it) - it's a BIOS "replacement" that allows much
easier pre-boot programming. What these folks have done, clever buggers
that they are, is create an app - two of them, really - called "Arcade"
(plays VCDs/DVDs, shows your picture repositories, etc. - sound
familiar? Think "MoviX", etc.) and put a button on the front of the
laptop. When the 'top is _off,_ pushing this button fires up "Arcade"

Aside from that, though - obviously, FIPS won't work with this rig. What
I need to do is shrink that first partition (Wind0ws) and put Linux into
the newly-created second partition (I don't want to just blow away

I'd say they connected this to the internal usb plug and so this should be
easy to get working: enable "probe all LUNs" in the scsi section and then it
should show up with scsi-emulation on.

Hmmm... I just thought of something. I <em>could</em> blow it all away, install
Linux - I'd have at least console-mode stuff, which would be sucky but
workable, and copy everything over from the old machine. Then, when I
come back, I could buy an external HD for backup, copy it all off,
reinstall Wind0ws, and be abck to the same status. Hm. Frankly, this
sounds <em>really</em> last-ditch. Worst of all, the new 'top has no serial
port, so I wouldn't be able to use my cell phone to connect to the Net.

The first thing I could be inclined you did, Ben, is provide your "lspci"
output, along with "lspci -n". What you should probably ensure is that
your PCI entry is valid for the detected card.

<blockquote><pre>PCI:nn:nn:nn

where nn is your numbers from the correct entry for your card, <EM>but</EM> they
HAVE to be in decimal format. lspci gives you them in hexadecimal and do
you have to convert them. Using my example then...

I installed the 2.6.0-test11 kernel so I could do the "swsusp" patch -
haven't yet, the network here at the hotel died for an hour or so and
just came back up - and compiled it (I think this is where the
framebuffer stuff came from; I hadn't changed anything in that section.)
Previously, though, I got a very thin lead from a discussion I saw where
somebody recommended turning off AGP in the kernel config, since the ATI
driver does its own, followed by someone else recommending trying it
both ways - according to them, some ATI cards will <em>only</em> work with
ATI's AGP while some others work <em>only</em> with in-kernel AGP. Actually,
that didn't help anything, but while twiddling this, and making
corresponding tweaks in the ATI "fglrx" driver configuration, I got an
error from trying to load "fglrx" - 'The fglrx module must be loaded
before any other DRM driver!' From there, it was a short trip back to
the kernel, compiling the ATI Radeon DRM as a _module,_ then loading
"fglrx" followed by "radeon" in <TT>/etc/modules</TT>, and - <TT>/voila/!</TT> Well,
partially.

I now have 1280x800 video with 24 bit color (still not fantastic as
compared to what the card/screen can do, but certainly better.)
According to the messages in the X log, this is the best that the ATI
driver can do - which is pretty sad, but what can you do. Hopefully,
they'll make it better as time goes on.

Not at all. My first experience with the 2.6 kernel was this past week,
and I was greatly tickled by the fact that it automatically takes the
previous .config and (obviously) does a bit of intelligent parsing. You
can even (and this is what I did) do
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>make oldconfig
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
after installing the new kernel, and it will load up the old config file
and only ask you about the differences (there weren't any between 2.6.0
and 2.6.0-test11.)

Well, at this point, I've managed to take a largish step back. :/
"swsusp" docs say that you should have at least $MEMSIZE * 1.3 in swap,
so I blew off the empty partition that I had following swap, deleted
both of them, resized swap and created a partition out of what
remained... and now, when I boot, "fsck" falls down with a loud "THUD"
and cries that it found an error and I should re-run it as root without
"-a" or "-p". When I do so, it tells me I have a mismatch between what
the BIOS and the partition info say (about 2,000 sectors) and requires
me to press 'Enter' 6,000 times (it generates 3 error messages/prompts per
sector.) No, you cannot pipe the output of 'yes' to it. Laying a weight
on the 'Enter' key (hi-tech solutions is us!) gets it done in about five
minutes... after which it proceeds to repeat exactly what it did before.
However, in this case, "Hit Ctrl-D to continue normal startup" actually
does work, so here I am. [sigh]

Hmm, did you use cfdisk for this? It might be that you have to have a new
map file in your <TT>/boot</TT> partition. Try running lilo again to see if that'll
kick it? It might be worth just disabling swap for the time being and
manually running:

it's fixed already.

Not enough of them - tapping the touchpad, which has always worked, got
borked in the process, and "gpm" doesn't work with the "synaptic" driver
in the kernel (TONS of spurious messages.) Fortunately, I found patches
for both of them. Tapping still doesn't work in the console, but it's
not a huge issue. Also, the touchpad buttons are arranged like this:

Dell Inspirons (and maybe others) had 1600x1200/15" for some years now
at least starting with the Insp. 8000 on which I'm typing. There were
Insp. 5000 with high res 15" screens as well. The current 8600 or higher
have an even higher resolution on the top models. As you sit rather
close to a lapscreen I like the display. I had to switch some fonts to a
slightly larger one, but the displays are very sharp at the native

The Inspirons use either nvidia Geforce 2 (or up in later models) or ATI

I don't have the HD installed (although I have it with me), but what I

system with a large tarball in "<TT>/</TT>". Looking inside the tarball revealed
a more complete system; presumably, it works something like the LNX-BBC
system (Oy, Heather!) by using the basic system to fire up, then
decompress the tarball into memory and "pivot_root" (I'm guessing here.)

Well, you should then write the mplayer folks a nice email telling them
that. Quite recently they even started a new ml called mplayer-legal...
Or do you think you can get the sources somewhere?

It's quite cute, with a bunch of "lilo.conf.X" entries in <TT>/etc</TT> - obviously
in case the partition ends up being anything other than hda4 which is where
it is by default. Cuter yet, there's no alternate VT you can flip to - but
there <em>is</em> a getty running on a serial port, and "<TT>/etc/passwd</TT>" doesn't have
an entry for "root" but does contain one for "ava:0:0:..." Ain't that
preeeecious?

Heck, I might just copy the thing and put in on a CD for a stand-alone
movie/slideshow/etc. player.

I've actually considered doing that [a howto], on the principle that if I had that
much trouble, other people surely will as well. However, I've held off so
far because I'm not quite finished yet; I've zapped the original HD back
into the Acer, and am now trying to split hda1 into hda1 and hda5, for
Wind*ws on 1 (10GB or so) and Linux on 5 (40GB). However, the DVD+R media
that I bought for backing up hda1 turns out to be incompatible with the drive
(which does only DVD-R and down), so I have to go back to the store.... all
this in between yoga classes, a flight medical (I now have my class III
flying license), actual flying, chanty singing with a reenactment group,
trying to somehow get Net access going (I've sorta got it - by buying a new
cellphone), patching a leak that my dinghy has mysteriously developed,
dealing with a couple of clients who have picked this time to play some
highly shitful games with paying me (until I threatened legal action),
fixing a recalcitrant propane heater in my aft cabin, and handling the
initial stages of what looks like a local romantic involvement.
