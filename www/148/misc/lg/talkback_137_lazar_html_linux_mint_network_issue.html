Loved the article, but what if you have DHCP and Linux Mint still doesn't
find the Internet (so no updates of new programs;{
Went to Network and filled in workgroup and machine names, my router hands
out IPs...System see's the hardware...do I have to Mount the eth0, and if so
how does one do that.
Thanks for the great web page, and in advance for your help. This is the 4th
Linux I've tried over the years, looks ALMOST easy enough for me!
This machine dual boots to Xp and that can see the Internet, home built
Athlon 1700 machine, multiple hard drives, wired to the router, and through
that to cable.

best,

DHCP doesn't have much to do with "finding" the Internet; you appear to
be confused about the difference between your internal network and your
external (i.e., Internet) connection.

Well, you don't "mount" eth0 - in fact, we have no way of knowing that
your network device is called 'eth0' - but you can check to see if it
exists (and if it's active) with "ifconfig eth0". Once you've got that,
and given that your internal network is OK, you need to focus on the
external one. Can you ping your cable modem? If yes, can you ping any
external hosts by IP (say, cnn.com which resolves to 64.236.16.52)? If
yes, can you ping them by name?
</p>

<p>
Figure out where this process is breaking down for you, then
troubleshoot that bit and let us know how it comes out.

Glad that you've found it helpful. I'm CCing the author of the article -
I'm sure he'll enjoy knowing that his writing is appreciated!
