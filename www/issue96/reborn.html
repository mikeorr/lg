<h1>The Linux Gazette, Reborn</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Nothing lasts. Favorite toys finally fall apart; old cars, the pride and
joy of your high school days (and nights!) rust out, fade away, languish for
lack of available parts. Relationships, business and personal, once so bright
and exciting, wither like houseplants exposed to the desert sunlight and blow
away like tumbleweeds.</p>

<p>During the past month, the Linux Gazette, as we and our readers have known
it for a number of years, has come to an end. SSC, the company who had been
hosting - and, to some degree, supporting - our efforts since shortly after
the inception of the Gazette has decided that it somehow <b>belongs</b> to
them, to change, adapt - or to destroy - at their pleasure. We - the people
who have volunteered our efforts to write for it, assemble it, produce it,
and publish it - disagree... and the wind of the desert howls over all,
blowing away what once was, leaving nothing but the pure idea that still
lives, independent of hardware, software, and corporate manipulation, and
existing only in the minds of those who believe in it.</p>

<p>The smoke of the past rises in the air, dissipates... and is gone. But the
spirit of things, if they are worthwhile, endures, and follows the original
forms. "The King is dead - long live the King!" Mark Andreessen's Mosaic
morphs into Netscape Navigator changes into the Communicator Suite mutates
through (and survives!) The AOL Corporate Hellbeast emerges as Mozilla. The
Linux Gazette, slated by SSC to slip off into a muddy swamp of CMS,
obscurity, and the inevitably short slide into destruction, arises like the
Phoenix from its intended pyre - purified, bright, and new.</p>

<p>Our mission, renewed and all the stronger for going through the fire,
remains what it has been all along: "making Linux a little more fun." The
core format of the Gazette will remain what it has been as well, static
(and thus universally accessible and mirror-able) HTML and text and
available for reading or download via the Web. (<b>BONUS:</b> For those of
you who wish to read the text version on your Palm Pilots, or other
handhelds that can read the <a href="http://www.palmdigitalmedia.com/">
Palmdoc</a> format, I will be introducing our new PDB version as well.)
Obviously, our URL and <a href="../contact.html">email addresses</a> will
change - we are now located at <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/">
http://linuxgazette.net</a> instead of the old ".com". The largest changes
are going to be under the hood, where DNS, mirroring, site structure,
author submission/input/feedback, and The Answer Gang lists live; all of
these are intended to improve the process, making it easier for all of us
to continue bringing - and hopefully improving - our content for you, our
readers.</p>

<p>Welcome to the new Linux Gazette.</p>

<BIG><STRONG>Release Notes</STRONG></BIG>, by 
<A HREF="../authors/orr.html">Mike Orr ("Sluggo")</A>

<P> Most of the basic features of LG are in place.  The following features,
however, are changed:

<UL>
<LI> We have started a new <A HREF="../mirrors.html">mirrors list</A> from
scratch, and are re-adding only mirrors that confirm they are actively being
maintained.  <P>

<LI> The <A HREF="../authors/index.html">authors index</A> now has a link on
the Front Page menu since many readers don't know it exists. <P>

<LI> The tarballs for off-line browsing (aka. the "FTP files") are now
delivered via HTTP rather than FTP.  Their new location is <A
HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/ftpfiles/">http://linuxgazette.net/ftpfiles/</A>.
We figure anybody who has access to an FTP client nowadays also has access to a
web browser, so this saves us from running an otherwise-unused FTP server.
Some of the <A HREF="../mirrors.html">mirrors</A> do still serve them via FTP.
<P>

<LI> In four months, LG will reach its 100th issue.  We will change the 
issue-naming convention from issue## to ### for three-digit issues.  This
will allow them to fall in their natural order in an alphabetical directory
listing, although the two-digit issues will follow the three-digit issues.
(You can't have everything; and LG needs to preserve old URLs that have been
bookmarked.)  Likewise, the FTP files will be called lg-###.tar.gz instead of
lg-issue###.tar.gz.  If you have a script that calculates the issue name, 
you'll have to modify it.  <P>
</UL>

The following pieces are unfinished:

<UL>
<LI> The search engine is not operational yet. <P>

<LI> Several of the back issues are missing their TWDT files.  But that 
doesn't matter since they're also missing their links to the TWDT files!
This is a problem we discovered just before press time. <P>

<LI> The author pages don't have links for the current issue yet. <P>

<LI> There's probably a couple things I don't remember.... <P>
</UL>

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.

<em>
<p>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.

<p>His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.

<p>He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
