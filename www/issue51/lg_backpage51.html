<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Shane Collinge</H4>
Part computer programmer, part cartoonist, part Mars Bar. At night, he runs
around in a pair of colorful tights fighting criminals. During the day... well,
he just runs around.  He eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's sleepy.

Now I'm working on

Department of Physics, with special experience about security.

troubleshooting.  In his free time, he hacks on Linux (of course) and maintains
<A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~edward_leah/linux">Edward's Linux
BrainDump</A>.  He is thinking about joining a support group for computer geeks
who take on too many responsibilities.  (And if there isn't such a group, maybe
he can start one?  How much work could that be?)

Alex is a Lead Software Engineer at Motorola. He is always taking some sort of
class.  He just finished the class work toward a Ph.D.  in computer science,
but only time will tell if it goes any further.  His wife, Diane, is certainly
his best friend and biggest fan. He enjoys his two Schnauzers, Brutus and Cleo,
and his dozens of African Ciclids, too. He is a licensed amateur radio
operator, as is Diane, and they spend more than a few nights together observing
the skies through their 5-inch telescope.  They like to get out and stay
active, to enjoy life together.

<P> This caricature of your humble editor is by Shane Collinge, who draws our <A HREF="collinge.html">HelpDex</A> series.

<P> The post-WTO protest to shut down Microsoft (or at least annoy them) took
place as scheduled, but your editor had a doctor's appointment and couldn't
attend.  News coverage was scanty except for this
<A HREF="http://archives.seattletimes.com/cgi-bin/texis/web/vortex/display?storyID=38a091f3a4&query=microsoft+protest+dan"><I>Seattle Times</I> article</A>.
The <I>Seattle Weekly</I> later did an
<A HREF="http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0008/features-howland.shtml">
analysis</A> of the event, although only the first part of the article is
direcly about Microsoft.

<P> Ironically, Microsoft Singapore sent the <I>Gazette</I> a nice piece of
spam about a "Windows 2000 Professional Sales Training"
seminar.  "Come and learn all about Windows 2000 Professional, then take the
online test.  Microsoft will award all who pass with a certificate you can
frame and show others your achievement."  I can't wait.  Not.  

<P> Thanks for sending in your articles and 2-cent tips.  
Remember to have fun with Linux this month!
