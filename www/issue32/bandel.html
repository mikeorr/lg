Linux is many users' introduction to a truly powerful,
configurable operating system. In the past, a Unix-like operating
system was out of reach for most. If it wasn't the operating
system's 4-digit price tag, it was the hardware. Even the now
free-for-personal-use SCO Unixware requires a system with
SCSI drives, and most of us are using IDE to keep costs down. Along with
the power that Linux brings
comes the need to perform a task users have not had to do on
simpler operating systems: configure the kernel to your hardware
and operations.
<p>
Previous installation kernels from 1.2.x and before <i>suggested</i>
that you rebuild; however, with the new 2.0.x kernel, rebuilding has almost
become a necessity. The kernel that comes with the installation packages from
Red Hat, Caldera, Debian
and most others, is a generic, ``almost everything is included''
kernel. While rebuilding a kernel may seem like a daunting task
and living with the installed kernel may not be too bad, rebuilding is a
good introduction to your system.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Why Roll Your Own?</h3>
<p>
The standard installation kernels are an attempt to make
as many systems as
possible usable for the task of installing a workable Linux system. As
such,
the kernel is bloated and has a lot of unnecessary code in it for
the average machine. It also does not have some code a lot of users
want.
<p>
Then, of course, there's always the need to upgrade
the kernel because you've bought new hardware, etc. Upgrading within
a series is usually very straightforward. When it comes to
upgrading, say from 1.2.something to 2.0.something, now the task is
beyond the scope of this article and requires some savvy.
Better to get a new distribution CD and start fresh--this is also true
for upgrading to the experimental 2.1.x kernels.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Kernel Version Numbering</h3>
<p>
All Linux kernel version
numbers contain three numbers separated by periods (dots). The
first number is the kernel version. We are now on the third kernel version,
2. Some of you may be running a version 1 kernel, and I am aware of
at least one running version 0 kernel.
<p>
The second number
is the kernel major number. Major numbers which are even numbers
(0 is considered an even number) are said to be stable. That is, these
kernels should not have any crippling bugs, as they have been fairly
heavily tested.
While some contain small bugs, they can usually be upgraded for
hardware compatibility or to armor the kernel against system
crackers. For example, kernel
2.0.30, shunned by some in favor of 2.0.29 because of reported bugs,
contains several patches including one to protect against SYN denial
of service attacks.
The kernels with odd major numbers are developmental kernels. These
have not been tested and often as not will break any software packages
you may be running. Occasionally, one works well enough that it will
be adopted by users needing
the latest and greatest support before the next stable release.
This is the
exception rather than the rule, and it requires substantial changes
to a system.
<p>
The last number is the minor number and is
increased by one for each release. If you see kernel version 2.0.8,
you know it's a kernel 2.0, stable kernel, and it is the ninth release
(we begin counting with 0).
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<p>
I hate to
make any assumptions; they always seem to come back to bite me. So I
need to mention a few things so that we're working off the same sheet of
music. In order to compile a kernel, you'll need a few things. First,
I'll assume you've installed a distribution with a 2.0.x kernel,
all the base
packages and perhaps a few more. You'll also need to have installed
<b>gcc</b> version
2.7 and all the supporting gcc libraries. You'll also need the
libc-dev library and the binutils and bin86 packages (normally
installed as part of a standard distribution install). If you download
the source or copy it from a CD, you'll also need the <b>tar</b> and <b>gunzip</b>
packages. Also, you'll need lots of disk real estate.
Plan on 7MB to download, another 20MB to unpack this monster and a few more
to compile it.
<p>
Needless to say, many of the things we will discuss
require you to be logged in as root. If you've downloaded the kernel
as a non-privileged user and you have write permission to the /usr/src
subdirectory, you can still do much of this task without becoming root.
For the newcomers to Linux, I highly recommend you do as much
as possible as a non-privileged user and become root (type:
<tt>su&nbsp;-&nbsp;face</tt>) only for those jobs that require it.
One day, you'll be glad you acquired this habit. Remember, there are
two kinds of systems administrators, those who have totally wrecked a running
setup inadvertently while logged in as root, and those who will.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Obtaining/Upgrading the Source</h3>
<p>
Kernel sources for
Linux are available from a large number of ftp sites and
on almost every Linux distribution CD-ROM. For starters, you can
go to ftp.funet.fi,
the primary site for the Linux kernel. This site has a
list of mirror sites from which you can download the kernel. Choosing
the site nearest you helps decrease overall Internet traffic.
<p>
Once you've obtained the source, put it in the /usr/src directory.
Create a subdirectory to hold the source files once they are unpacked using
tar. I recommend naming the directories
something like linux-2.0.30 or kernel-2.0.30, substituting your
version numbers. Create a link to this subdirectory called linux using the
following command:
<p>
<pre>
ln -sf linux-2.0.30 linux
</pre>
I included the <tt>-f</tt> in the
link command because if you already have a kernel source in /usr/src,
it will contain this link too, and we want to force
it to look in our subdirectory.
(On some versions of <b>ln</b> (notably version 3.13), the force option
(<tt>-f</tt>)
does not work. You'll have to first remove the link then establish
it again. This works correctly by version 3.16.)
The only time you may have a problem is if linux is a
subdirectory name, not a link. If you have this problem, you'll
have to rename the subdirectory before continuing:
<p>
<pre>
mv linux linux-2.0.8
</pre>
Now issue the command:
<p>
<pre>
tar xzvf linux-kernel-source.tar.gz
</pre>
I have a habit of always including <tt>w</tt> (wait for
confirmation) in the tar option string, then when
I see that the .tar.gz or .tgz file is going to unpack into its
own subdirectory, I <tt>ctrl-C</tt> out and reissue
the command without the <tt>w</tt>.
This way I can prevent corrupted archives from unpacking into the current
directory. 
<p>
Once you have the kernel unpacked, if you have any
patches you wish to apply, now is a good time. Let's say you don't
wish to run kernel 2.0.30, but you do want the tcp-syn-cookies. Copy
the patch (called tcp-syn-cookies-patch-1) into the /usr/src
directory and issue the command:
<p>
<pre>
patch &lt; tcp-syn-cookies-patch-1
</pre>
This command
applies the patch to the kernel. Look for files with
an .rej extension in in the /usr/src directory.
These files didn't patch properly. They may be unimportant, but
peruse them anyway. If you installed a Red Hat system with some but not all of
the kernel source (SPARC, PowerPC, etc.), you'll see some of these files.
As long as they're not for your architecture, you're okay.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>
As a final note, before we change (<b>cd</b>) into the
kernel source directory and start building our
new kernel, let's check some links that are needed. In your
/usr/include
directory, make sure you have the following soft links:
<p>
<pre>
asm - /usr/src/linux/include/asm
linux - /usr/src/linux/include/linux
scsi - /usr/src/linux/include/scsi
</pre>
Now, you see another reason to
standardize the location of the kernel. If you don't put the latest
kernel you wish to install in /usr/src/linux
(via a link), the above links will not reach their intended target
(dangling links), and the kernel may fail to compile.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>How to proceed</h3>
<p>
Once everything else is set up, change directories into /usr/src/linux.
Although you may want to stop off and peruse some of the documentation in the
Documentation directory, particularly if you have any special hardware
needs. Also, several of the CD-ROM drivers need to be built with
customized settings. While they usually work as is, these drivers
may give warning messages when loaded. If this doesn't bother
you and they work as they should, don't worry. Otherwise, read the
appropriate .txt, .h (header) files and .c (c code) files. For
the most part, I have found them to be well commented and easy to
configure. If
you don't feel brave, you don't have to do it. Just remember you
can always restore the original file by unpacking the gzipped tar file (or
reinstalling the .rpm files) again. 
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Beginning to Compile</h3>
<p>
The first command I recommend you issue is:
<p>
<pre>
make mrproper
</pre>
While this command
is not necessary when the kernel source is in pristine condition,
it is a good habit to cultivate. This command ensures that old object files are
not littering the source tree and are not used or in the way.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Configuring the Kernel</h3>
<p>
Now, you're ready to configure
the kernel. Before starting, you'll need to understand a little
about modules. Think of a module as something you can plug into the
kernel for a special purpose. If you have a small network at home
and sometimes want to use it (but not always), maybe you'll want to
compile
your Ethernet card as a module. To use the module, the machine must
be running and have access to the /lib/modules
This means that the drive (IDE, SCSI, etc., but could be an
ethernet card in the case of nfs), the file system (normally ext2 but could be
nfs) and the kernel type (hopefully elf) must be compiled in and cannot be
modules. Modules aren't available until the kernel is loaded, the drive (or
network) accessed, and the file system mounted.
These files must be compiled into the kernel or
it will not be able to mount the root partition. If you're mounting
the root partition over the network, you'll need the network file
system module, and your Ethernet card compiled.
<p>
Why use
modules? Modules make the kernel smaller. This reduces the
amount of protected space never given up by the kernel. Modules load and
unload and that memory can be reallocated. If you use a module more
than about
90% of the time the machine is up, compile it. Using a module in
this case can be wasteful of memory, because while the module takes up the
same amount of memory as if it were compiled, the kernel needs
a little more code to have
a hook for the module. Remember, the kernel runs in protected
space,
but the modules don't. That said, I don't often follow my own
advice. I
compile in: ext2, IDE and elf support only. While I use an Ethernet
card almost all
the time, I compile everything else as modules: a.out, java, floppy,
iso9660, msdos, minix, vfat, smb, nfs, smc-ultra (Ethernet card),
serial, printer, sound, ppp, etc.
Many of these only run for a few minutes at a time here and there.
<p>
The next step is to configure the
kernel. Here we have three choices--while all do the same thing,
I recommend using one of the graphical methods. The old way was to
simply type: <tt>make&nbsp;config</tt>. This begins a long series of
questions. However, if you make a mistake, your only option is to press
<tt>ctrl-C</tt> and begin again. You also can't go
back in the sequence, and some questions
depend on previous answers. If for some reason you absolutely
can't use either of the graphical methods, be my guest.
<p>
I recommend using either <tt>make&nbsp;menuconfig</tt> or
<tt>make&nbsp;xconfig</tt>. In order to use <b>menuconfig</b>,
you must have installed the ncurses-dev and the
tk4-dev libraries. If you didn't install them and you don't want to
use the next
method, I highly recommend that you install them now. You can always
uninstall them later.
<p>
To run <tt>make&nbsp;xconfig</tt>, you must install and configure X.
Since X is such a memory hog, I install, configure and
<b>startx</b> only for this portion of the process, going back to a console
while the kernel compiles so it can have all the memory it needs. The
xconfig menu is, in my opinion, the best and easiest way to
configure the kernel. Under menuconfig, if you disable an option, any
subordinate options are not shown. Under xconfig, if you disable an
option, subordinate options still show, they are just greyed out. I
like this because I can see what's been added since the last kernel.
I may want to enable an option to get one of the new sub-options in order
to to experiment with it.
<p>
I'm going to take some
space here to describe the sections in the kernel configuration and tell
you some of the things I've discovered--mostly the hard way.
<p>
The first section is the code-maturity-level option. The only
question is whether you want to use developmental drivers and code. You
may not have a choice if you have some bleeding edge hardware. If
you choose ``no'', the experimental code is greyed out or not
shown. If you use this kernel for commercial production purposes,
you'll probably want to choose ``no''.
<p>
The second section concerns
modules. If you want modules, choose ``yes'' for questions 1
and 3. If you want to use proprietary modules that come with certain
distributions, such as Caldera's OpenLinux for their Netware support, also
answer ``yes'' to the second question since you won't be able to recompile
the module.
<p>
The third section is general setup. Do compile the
kernel as ELF and compile support for ELF binaries. Not compiling
the proper support is a definite ``gotcha''.
You'll get more efficient code compiling the kernel for the machine's
specific architecture (Pentium or 486), but a 386 kernel will run in any 32-bit
Intel compatible clone; a Pentium kernel won't.
An emergency boot disk for a large number of computers (as well as
distribution install disks) is best compiled as a 386. However, a 386 will
not run a kernel compiled for a Pentium.
<p>
Next comes block
devices--nothing special here. If your root device is on an IDE drive,
just make sure you compile it.
<p>
Then comes networking. For
computers not connected to a network, you won't need much here unless
you plan to use one computer to dial-out while others connect through
it. In this case, you'll need to read up on such things as masquerading and
follow the suggested guidelines.
<p>
SCSI support is next, though
why it doesn't directly follow block devices I don't know. If your
root
partition is on a SCSI device, don't choose modules for SCSI support.
<p>
SCSI low-level drivers follow general SCSI support. Again,
modules only for devices that don't contain the root partition.
<p>
The next section takes us back to networking again. Expect
to do a lot of looking for your particular card here as well as some
other support such as <b>ppp</b>, <b>slip</b>, etc. If you use <b>nfs</b> to
mount your root device, compile in Ethernet support.
<p>
For
those lucky enough to be needing ISDN support, the ISDN subsection will
need to be completed.
<p>
Older CD-ROMs may require support from the next
section. If you're using a SCSI or IDE CD-ROM, you can skip
this one.
<p>
Next comes file systems. Again, compile
what you need, in most cases ext2 and use modules for the rest.
<p>
Character devices are chosen next. Non-serial mice, like
the PS/2 mouse are supported. Look on the bottom of your mouse. Many
two-button mice are PS/2 type,
even though they look and connect like serial mice. You'll almost
certainly want serial support (generic) as a minimum. Generic printer support
is also
listed here.
<p>
The penultimate section is often the most troubling:
sound. Choose carefully from the list and read the available help.
Make sure you've chosen the correct I/O base and IRQs
for your card. The MPU I/O base for a SoundBlaster card is listed as
0. This is normally 330 and your sound module will complain
if this value is incorrect. Don't worry. One of the nice things about
modules is you can recompile and reinstall the modules as long as the
kernel was compiled with the hook. (Aren't modules great?).
<p>
The final section contains one question that should probably be
answered as ``no, kernel hacking''.
<p>
Save your configuration and exit.
<p>
I have, on several occasions,
had trouble editing the numbers in menuconfig
or xconfig to values I knew were correct. For whatever reason, I
couldn't change the
number or <b>config</b> wouldn't accept the number, telling me it
was invalid. For example, changing the SoundBlaster IRQ from the
config default of 7 to 5, and the MPU base I/O from 0 to 300. If
you experience this problem, but everything else went well, don't
despair. The file you just wrote when you did a ``Save'' and
``Exit'' is an
editable text file. You may use your text editor of choice: Emacs, vi,
CrispLite, joe, etc. Your configuration file is in the /usr/src/linux
directory and
is called <tt>.config</tt>. The
leading dot causes the file to be hidden during a normal directory listing
(<b>ls</b>), but it
shows up when the <tt>-a</tt> option is specified.
Just edit the numbers in this file that
you had trouble with in the configuration process. Next, type
<tt>make&nbsp;dep</tt>
to propagate your configurations from the .config file to
the proper subdirectories
and to complete the setup. Finally, type <tt>make&nbsp;clean</tt>
to prepare for the final kernel build.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Building the Kernel</h3>
<p>
We're now ready to begin
building the kernel. There are several options for accomplishing this task:
<p>
<ul>
  <li> 	<tt>make zImage</tt>: makes the basic,
compressed kernel and leaves it in the /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot
directory as zImage.
  <li> 	<tt>make zlilo</tt>: Copies
the zImage to the root directory (unless you edited the top-level
Makefile) and runs LILO. If you choose to use this option,
you'll have to ensure that /etc/lilo.conf is preconfigured.
  <li> 	<tt>make zdisk</tt>: Writes zImage to a
floppy disk in /dev/fd0
(the first floppy drive--the a: drive in DOS). You'll need the disk
in the drive before
you start. You can accomplish the same thing by running
<tt>make&nbsp;zImage</tt> and copying the
image to a floppy disk
<tt>cp&nbsp;/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage&nbsp;/dev/fd0</tt>
Note that you'll need to use a high-density
disk. The low density 720k disks will reportedly not boot the kernel.
  <li> 	<tt>make boot</tt>: Works just
the same as the zImage option.
  <li> 	<tt>make bzImage</tt>: Used for big kernels
and operates the same as zImage. You will know if you need this
option, because <b>make</b> will fail with a message that
the image is too big.
  <li> 	<tt>make bzdisk</tt>: Used for big kernels
and operates the same as zdisk. You will know if you need this
option, because make will fail with a message that
the image is too big.
</ul>
Other <b>make</b> options are available,
but are specialized, and are not covered here. Also, if you need
specialized support, such as for a RAM disk or SMP,
read the appropriate documentation and edit the Makefile in
/usr/src/linux (also called the top-level Makefile) accordingly.
Since all the options I discussed above are basically the same
as the zImage option, the rest of this article deals with
<tt>make&nbsp;zImage</tt>--it is
the easiest way to build the kernel.
<p>
For those of you who wish to speed up the process and won't be doing
other things (such as configuring other applications), I suggest you
look at the man page
for make and try out the <tt>-j</tt> option (perhaps with a limit like 5) and also the <tt>-l</tt> option.
<p>
If you chose modules during the configuration process,
you'll want to issue the commands:
<p>
<pre>
make modules
make modules_install
</pre>
to put the modules
in their default location of  /lib/modules/2.0.x/,
x being the kernel minor number. If you already have this
subdirectory and it has subdirectories such as
block, net, scsi, cdrom, etc., you may want to remove
2.0.x and everything below it unless you have some proprietary modules
installed, in which case don't remove it. When the modules
are installed, the subdirectories are created and
populated.
<p>
You could just as easily have combined the last three
commands:
<p>
<pre>
make zImage; make modules; make modules_install
</pre>
then returned after all the disk churning
finished. The ; (semicolon) character separates sequential commands on one line and
performs each command in order so that you don't have to wait around just
to issue the next command. 
<p>
Once your kernel is built and your
modules installed, we have a few more items to take care of. First, copy
your kernel to the root (or /boot/ or /etc/, if you wish):
<p>
<pre>
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/zImage /zImage
</pre>
You should also copy the /usr/src/linux/System.map
file to the same directory as the kernel image. Then
change (cd) to the /etc directory
to configure LILO. This is a very important step. If we don't install
a pointer
to the new kernel, it won't boot. Normally, an install kernel
is called vmlinuz. Old-time Unix users will
recognize the construction of this name. The trailing ``z'' means the
image is compressed. The ``v'' and ``m'' also have significance and
mean ``virtual'' and ``sticky'' respectively and
pertain to memory and disk management. I suggest you leave the
vmlinuz kernel in place, since you know it works.
<p>
Edit the /etc/lilo.conf file
to add your new kernel. Use the lines from the
<tt>image=/vmlinuz</tt> line to the next
<tt>image=</tt> line or the end. Duplicate what you see, then
change the first line to <tt>image=/zImage</tt>
(assuming your kernel is in the root directory) and choose a
different name for the <tt>label=</tt>.
The first image in the file is the default, others will have to be
specified on the command line in order to boot them. Save the file and
type:
<p>
<pre>
lilo
</pre>
You will now see the kernel labels, and the first
one will have an asterisk.
If you don't see the label that you gave your new kernel or LILO
terminates with
an error, you'll need to redo your work in /etc/lilo.conf
(see LILO man pages).
<p>
We're almost ready to reboot. At this point, if you know your
system will only require one reboot to run properly, you might want
to issue the command:
<p>
<pre>
depmod -a 2.0.x
</pre>
where x is the minor number of the kernel you just built. This command creates the dependencies
file some modules need. You'll also want to make sure you don't boot
directly into <b>xdm</b>. For Red Hat type systems,
this means ensuring the /etc/inittab file
doesn't have a default run level of 5, or that you remember to pass
LILO the
run level at boot time. For Debian systems, you can just type:
<p>
<pre>
mv /etc/init.d/xdm /etc/init.d/xdm.orig
</pre>
for now and move it back later.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Normal Rebooting the New Kernel</h3>
<p>
Reboot your machine using:
<p>
<pre>
shutdown -r now
</pre>
While typing <tt>reboot</tt> or pressing the
<tt>ctrl+alt+del</tt> key combination usually
works, I don't recommend either one.
Under some circumstances, the file systems won't be properly
unmounted and could corrupt open files. At the LILO
prompt, if you need to boot the old kernel or pass some parameters for
bootup and you don't see the <tt>boot:</tt> prompt, you can try
pressing either the
<tt>shift</tt> or <tt>ctrl</tt> key, and the
<tt>boot:</tt> prompt should appear. Once you have
it, press <tt>tab</tt> to see the available kernel labels. Type the label and
optionally enter any parameters for bootup. Normally, however, the default
kernel should boot automatically after the timeout interval specified in
the /etc/lilo.conf file. During bootup,
you may see a few error messages containing: SIOCADDR or the
like. These usually indicate that a module (normally a network module)
didn't load.
We'll handle this shortly. If you got the error, ``VFS, cannot mount
root'', you didn't compile the proper disk or file-system support into
the kernel.
<p><HR> <P> 
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>
Due to the different
ways in which each distribution handles daemon startup
from /etc/inittab, it is difficult in this article to cover all the
possible
reasons your bootup may not have gone smoothly and the
reasons why.
However, I can tell you where to start looking.
<p>
First, run <tt>depmod&nbsp;-a</tt>
to ensure you have an up-to-date, module dependency file (it will
be
created in the appropriate subdirectory). If you
get a string of errors about unresolved dependencies, old modules
are present in the modules subdirectories, and you didn't configure
the kernel with ``Module Versions''
enabled. This is not a fatal error. The
modules you compiled and installed are good. Check the
/etc/conf.modules file and make sure that any lines pointing to
/lib/modules are complete:
<pre>
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/xx
</pre>
(Note: the grave quote on each side of <tt>uname&nbsp;-r</tt>
is located above
the Tab key in the upper left corner of the keyboard on a
U.S. keyboard).
<p>
Make sure <b>kerneld</b> is running and that it is
loaded early in the bootup process. If it is, then
the system doesn't need to explicitly load modules, kerneld will
handle it. Be careful about calling kerneld too early in the first
rc script. kerneld will stop the bootup process forcing a hard reboot
via the reset button or power switch, if it is called before the system
knows its host name. If this happens to you, you can reboot passing LILO
the <tt>-b</tt> argument which prevents <b>init</b> from executing any rc scripts.
Next, look in /etc/rc.d/ at the
rc, rc.sysinit and rc.modules files. One or more may point to a directory
such as /etc/modules/`uname -r`/`uname -v`
where a list of bootup modules are located. You can just copy the old
file over to the new directory; 
<pre>
mkdir /etc/modules/`uname -r` ;
cp /etc/modules/2.0.xx/g#1 Thu 3 Sep 1997.\
	default /etc/modules/`uname -r`/\
	`uname -v`.default&quot;&quot;
</pre>
Your system will almost certainly have a different
date for the modules file. Your system also may or may not use the
default extension. Pay close attention to the use of grave quotes
and double quotes in the above example, since both are needed in the proper
places. Once you have found the keys to your system, you should be
able to reboot into a properly functioning system. If
you experience further problems, the best place to get quick, expert advice
is on a mailing list dedicated to your particular distribution. Those
successfully running a particular distribution usually delight in
assisting novices with problems they may encounter. Why? Because
they hit the same brick walls when they were novices and received
help with many problems. Lurk a few days on a list, and
if your question isn't asked by someone else, ask
it yourself. Check the mail-list archives first, if any are present.
These archives contain answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ).

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
While building a kernel tailored to your
system may seem a daunting challenge for new administrators, the time
spent is worth it. Your system will run more efficiently, and more
importantly, you will have the satisfaction of building it yourself.
<p>
The few areas
where you may encounter trouble are in remembering to rerun LILO after
installing the new kernel, but you didn't overwrite your old one (or
did you?), so you can always revert to one that worked from the
<tt>lilo:</tt> prompt. Distribution
specific problems during bootup may also be encountered
during the
first reboot but are usually easily resolved. Help is normally
only an e-mail
away for those distributions that don't come with technical support.
