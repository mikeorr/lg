<h1>Measure CPU Fan Speed with an RTAI/LXRT Stroboscope!</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>The BIOS on most modern motherboards will show you the
rotational speed of the CPU fan. Let's design a simple
&lsquo;optical&rsquo; experiment for verifying whether the value
reported is indeed correct. For maximum voodoo effect, the
experiment should be conducted at night with the only source of
light being an LED blinking under the control of some dark and
devious <a href="http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai">RTAI/LXRT</a>
code!</p>

<h3>What is the big idea?</h3>

<p>Think of a fan with four blades rotating at a speed of 3600
rotations per minute (RPM.) Let's mark a part of one of the blades
with a distinct color, say white. Once the fan starts rotating, it
will be difficult for us to differentiate this blade as everything
becomes blurred. Each full rotation takes 1/60th of a second. What
if we look at the blades for a very brief period only once in that
1/60th of a second? It will appear as if the white mark is
motionless because each time we will see it at almost the same
position each revolution. A light source (like an LED) can be made
to generate short bursts of light at fairly high frequencies; an
object illuminated by such a source will be seen only during those
periodic short bursts of light. When the frequency of the bursts
match the frequency of rotation of the object being observed, the
object appears to be stationary. This is the principle of the
<a href=
"http://homepages.which.net/~paul.hills/Circuits/Stroboscope/Stroboscope.html">
stroboscope</a>.</p>

<h3>The hardware</h3>

<p>There is almost always a cooling fan attached to the CPU in a
desktop computer; your only job is to &lsquo;mark&rsquo; one of the
blades. I did this by pasting a small piece of white paper onto one
blade and it seems to work well.</p>

<p class="editorial">[Editor's note - leaving a high-speed fan
unbalanced <b>will</b> shorten the life of its bearings. I strongly
advise you to remove the marker from the fan when you are done with
the experiment! &mdash; dsrich]</p>

<p>The light source is a &lsquo;high-brightness&rsquo; LED
controlled by the parallel port. It's better that the LED is driven
by a transistor other than the parallel port output to increase the
amount of current through the LED and therefore its brightness. If
you are new to PC interfacing, please proceed with caution,
preferably after reading the material presented on web sites such
as <a href=
"http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/parallel_output.html">this
one</a>.</p>

<h3>The software</h3>

<p>Generating small (and precise) time delays under a general
purpose operating system like Linux is not an easy job. In one of
my <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue95/pramode.html">earlier
articles</a>, I had explained the use of an exciting technology
called &lsquo;Real Time Application Interface&rsquo; (RTAI) which
converts GNU/Linux into a hard real-time OS capable of doing
complex timing-sensitive control operations. The trouble with the
&lsquo;classical&rsquo; RTAI approach was that timing sensitive
code had to be written as modules and loaded into the kernel. The
more &lsquo;modern&rsquo; way of doing things is to use a component
of RTAI called LXRT and code real-time tasks as ordinary POSIX
threads.</p>

<h3>Setting up RTAI/LXRT</h3>

<p>RTAI/LXRT is composed of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A kernel patch which does some low level magic to convert your
Linux kernel to a &lsquo;real time OS&rsquo;.</li>

<li>A set of kernel modules which implement functionality like
intertask communication.</li>

<li>A library which gets linked with your application code and
helps to convert it into a real-time application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the steps required to get RTAI/LXRT running on your
machine:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download a a &lsquo;plain&rsquo; Linux kernel (from kernel.org)
- I used linux-2.6.10.</li>

<li>Download rtai-3.2-test3 from <a href=
"http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai/">here</a></li>

<li>When you untar the RTAI source package, you will see several
patches under the <code>base/arch/i386/patches</code> directory.
Apply the proper patch to your newly downloaded Linux kernel
(hal-linux-2.6.10-i386-r9.patch, in case you are using Linux
2.6.10). The patch should apply cleanly.</li>

<li>Configure and compile the kernel. When you configure the
kernel, make sure that module versioning support is disabled. The
experimental &lsquo;pass parameters in registers&rsquo; feature
should also be disabled. You can verify both by reading your
.config file (after you have done <code>make menuconfig</code>)
which should contain the lines:

<pre>

# CONFIG_REGPARM is not set
# CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is not set

</pre></li>

<li>Configure and compile rtai-3.2-test3. The configuration and
compilation process is fairly simple - you just have to do:

<pre>

make menuconfig; make; make install

</pre>
When you run <code>make menuconfig</code>, you will be asked to
provide the full path to the RTAI-patched Linux kernel source tree.
During <code>make install</code>, a few directories will be created
under /usr/realtime/ - the header files, libraries and kernel
modules required to do RTAI/LXRT development will be found under
these directories.</li>

<li>Reboot with the newly compiled kernel. Go to the
<code>/usr/realtime/modules</code> directory and try to insert the
modules rtai_hal.ko and rtai_lxrt.ko:

<pre>

cd /usr/realtime/modules/
insmod ./rtai_hal.ko
insmod ./rtai_lxrt.ko

</pre>
The modules should load cleanly. Check the output of the program
<code>dmesg</code> if there is any problem.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Blinking LEDs</h3>

<p>The traditional &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; program of the
hardware enthusiast is a simple LED blinker. Let's code it as an
RTAI/LXRT application:</p>

<p>[Download <a href="misc/pramode/listing1.txt">Listing 1</a>]</p>

<pre class="code">

/* led1.c, an LXRT LED blinker */

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai_lxrt.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;

// delay in nanoseconds
#define TICKS 500000000 

main()
{
        RT_TASK *task;
        int priority = 0, i;
        int stack_size = 4096;
        int msg_size = 0; // use default

        // get enough privilege to 
        // access the I/O ports.

        iopl(3);

        task = rt_task_init(nam2num("main"), 
                        priority, stack_size, msg_size);
        if(task == 0) exit(1);
        rt_set_oneshot_mode();
        start_rt_timer(0);
        mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE);
        rt_make_hard_real_time();

        for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
                outb(0xff, 0x378);
                rt_sleep(nano2count(TICKS));
                outb(0x0, 0x378);
                rt_sleep(nano2count(TICKS));
        }
        // back to non-rt land!
        rt_make_soft_real_time();
        stop_rt_timer();
        rt_task_delete(task);
        return 0;
}

</pre>

<p>The <code>rt_task_init</code> function registers our program
with the RTAI/LXRT kernel subsystem - the return value is a
pointer. Each task should have a name associated with it - we have
assigned the name <code>main</code> to our task.</p>

<p>Timing delays in RTAI/LXRT are generated by using the hardware
timer chip found on the motherboard. The timer is capable of
generating interrupts and can run in two modes - periodic and one
shot. When running in periodic mode, it keeps generating interrupts
at a fixed rate (say once every 1 millisecond). If all the time
delays required in your code can be expressed as multiples of a
&lsquo;base&rsquo; period (say 1 millisecond), you can think of
using the periodic mode. In the &lsquo;one-shot&rsquo; mode, the
timer will generate just one interrupt at a time after a certain
delay. This mode provides more flexibility as the timer can be
reprogrammed repeatedly to fire at differing intervals.</p>

<p>The <code>mlockall</code> function is called to disable paging
of program memory - paging might result in the program being
transferred to persistent swap store medium thereby affecting its
real-time behavior.</p>

<p>The <code>rt_make_hard_real_time</code> function transfers
control of our application to the RTAI/LXRT realtime scheduler. The
effect of this transition is that our code will never get disturbed
by normal Linux processes or activities going within the Linux
kernel. Note that once the program becomes &lsquo;hard real
time&rsquo;, it should never invoke Linux system calls - doing so
will result in the task becoming non real-time.</p>

<p>The <code>nano2count</code> function converts time specified in
nanoseconds to some &lsquo;internal count units&rsquo; specific to
RTAI/LXRT. We have defined TICKS to be 500 milliseconds; so</p>

<pre>

rt_sleep(nano2count(TICKS))

</pre>
will suspend our task for half a second. If we run the code with an
LED connected to an output pin (pins 2 to 9) of the parallel port,
we will see it blinking on and off ten times.

<p>The program should be compiled like this:</p>

<pre>

cc led1.c -I/usr/realtime/include -L/usr/realtime/lib -lpthread -llxrt

</pre>
Before running the code, make sure to edit your /etc/ld.so.conf
file so that it contains the path to the directory containing the
LXRT library (say /usr/realtime/lib); the <code>ldconfig</code>
command should also be executed.

<h3>The LXRT stroboscope!</h3>

<p>I enter the CMOS setup program of my Athlon64 machine and note
that my CPU fan is running at a speed of about 3900 rotations per
minute, or 65 rotations per second. The time for one rotation is
therefore (1000000000/65) nanoseconds, or 15384615 nanoseconds. The
idea is to blink an LED connected to pin number 2 of the parallel
port at this frequency.</p>

<pre>

LED on + off time = 15384615 nanoseconds
LED on time = 15384615/12 nanoseconds

</pre>
Out of the total period of 15384615 nanoseconds, the LED would stay
on for (1/12)th of the period and would be off for the remaining
time. The fan (and the white paper stuck onto one of the blades)
will be visible only during this brief period; by the time the LED
is on again, the blade with the paper will have returned back to
its original position. Thus, we should be able to see an almost
static image of the paper pasted onto the blade.

<p>In practice, I had to continuously tweak the period to get an
almost static image. This might be because the fan speed is not
remaining constant and keeps on changing slightly.</p>

<p>The code I had written is shown below:</p>

<p>[Download <a href="misc/pramode/listing2.txt">Listing 2</a>]</p>

<pre class="code">

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai_lxrt.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;

#define ONE_ROTATION   15384615

volatile int stop = 0;
unsigned int on_time, off_time; 

void* led_task(void *arg)
{
        RT_TASK *task;
        int priority = 0, i;
        int stack_size = 4096;
        int msg_size = 0;

        printf("LED started ...\n");

        task = rt_task_init(nam2num("led"), 
                        priority, stack_size, msg_size);
        if(task == 0) exit(1);
        mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE);
        rt_make_hard_real_time();

        while(!stop) {
                outb(0xff, 0x378);
                rt_sleep(nano2count(on_time));
                outb(0x0, 0x378);
                rt_sleep(nano2count(off_time));
        }
        rt_make_soft_real_time();
        rt_task_delete(task);
        return 0;
}

main()
{
        RT_TASK *task;
        int priority = 10, i;
        int stack_size = 4096;
        int msg_size = 0;
        pthread_t t1;

        on_time = ONE_ROTATION/12;
        off_time = ONE_ROTATION - on_time;

        task = rt_task_init(nam2num("main"), 
                        priority, stack_size, msg_size);
        if(task == 0) exit(1);
        rt_set_oneshot_mode();
        start_rt_timer(0);
        
        pthread_create(&amp;t1, 0, led_task, 0);
        getchar();
        stop = 1;
        pthread_join(t1, 0);
        stop_rt_timer();
        rt_task_delete(task);
        return 0;
}

</pre>
Note that the main thread is spawning a new thread which calls
<code>rt_make_hard_real_time</code> - this is the real-time LED
flasher. The main thread remains non real-time because it has to
interact with Linux (the <code>getchar</code> function will call
the <code>read</code> system call). This is typical of LXRT code;
one or more non real-time threads will do all the Linux-interaction
part and the hard real-time threads will do some hardware
manipulations without invoking any system calls.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>As I mentioned in the beginning, do this experiment at night,
preferably near around midnight! Whether you see the stroboscopic
effect or not, your friends (or family members) who might catch you
in action staring at the open motherboard of the machine in pitch
darkness with an LED light in your hands are sure to get a very
favorable impression about your general geek qualities!</p>

<p>If you have trouble compiling your RTAI patched Linux kernel, 
<!-- 20050508 dsrich Moved config.txt to local directory, changed link. -->
you might try using my <a href="misc/pramode/config.txt">.config
file</a> (Linux 2.6.10, patched with the corresponding RTAI patch.)
You should modify the CPU type to match your computer before
compilation.</p>

<p>You can learn more about RTAI/LXRT by reading the paper <a href=
"http://people.mech.kuleuven.ac.be/~psoetens/portingtolxrt.html">Porting
your C++ GNU/Linux application to RTAI/LXRT</a>. The <a href=
"http://www.fdn.fr/~brouchou/rtai/rtai-doc-prj/doxyapi/lxrt_faq.html">
LXRT-Informed FAQ</a> is good reading too. The <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobe_light">wikipedia entry on
strobe light</a> links the phenomenon to &lsquo;aliasing&rsquo;
which is common in digital signal processing.</p>

<p>As we are not dealing with sub-millisecond time periods here,
the usual Linux delay mechanisms (based on the system clock running
at 1KHz on the 2.6 kernel) should be sufficient for this
experiment. Doing so is left as an exercise to the reader!</p>
