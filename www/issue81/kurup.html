<h2>Intent</h2>
        The intent of this article is to provide an understanding  of  memory
 leak detection and profiling tools currently available. It also aims  at
 providing  you with enough information to be able to make a choice between
   the different  tools for your needs.<br>
               
<h2>Leaks and Corruption</h2>
        We are talking software here, not plumbing. And yes, any fairly large,
   non  trivial program is bound to have a problem with memory and or leaks.<br>
               
<h3>Where do problems occur?</h3>
        First, leaks and such memory problems do not occur in some languages. 
  These languages believe that memory management is <i>so important</i> that 
 it should never be handled by the users   of that language. It is better 
handled by the <i>language designers</i>. Examples  of such languages are 
Perl, Java &nbsp;and so on.<br>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, in some other languages (notably C and 
 C++)   the language designers have felt that memory management is <i>so important</i>
 that  it can only be taken care of by the <i>users</i> of the language.
A leak is said to occur when you dynamically  allocate  memory and then forget
to return it. In addition to leaks, other memory problems  such as <a
 href="http://www.tuxedo.org/%7Eesr/jargon/html/entry/buffer-overflow.html">buffer
 overflows</a>,&nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.tuxedo.org/%7Eesr/jargon/html/entry/dangling-pointer.html">dangling 
   pointers</a> &nbsp;also occur when programmers manage memory themselves.
  These problems are caused where there is a&nbsp; mismatch between what
the   program (and by extension the programmer) believes the state of memory
is,   as opposed to what it really is.<br>
               
<h3>What are the problems?</h3>
        In order for programs to be able to deal with data whose size  is 
not   known at compile time, the program may need to request memory from
the  runtime environment (operating system). However, having obtained  a
chunk  of memory, it may be possible that the program does not return  to
back to  the environment after use. An even more severe condition results 
 when the  address of the block that was obtained is lost, which means that 
 it is no  longer possible to identify that allocated memory. &nbsp;Other 
problems include trying to access memory after it has been returned (dangling 
pointers). Another common problem is trying to access more memory that was 
originally requested and so on (buffer overflow).<br>
               
<h3>Why should these problems bother me?</h3>
        Leaks may not be a problem for short-lived programs that finish their
work quickly. Unfortunately, many programs are designed to function
 without termination for a long period. A good example would be the Apache
 webserver that is  currently  providing you this web page. In such a situation,
 a malfunctioning leaky program could keep requesting memory from the  system
 and not return it. Eventually  this would lead to the system running out
of  memory and all programs running  on that machine to suffer. This is obviously
  not a &nbsp;good thing. In addition  to a program requiring more memory,
 leaks  can also make a program sluggish.  The speed at which the program
is context-switched in and out can decrease if the memory load increases.
 While not as severe as causing the machine  to crash, an excessive memory
  load on a machine could cause it to thrash,  swapping data back and forth.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dangling pointers can result in subtle corruption 
and   bugs that are extremely unusual, obscure and hard to solve. Buffer overflows
  are probably the most dangerous of the three forms of memory problems.
They   lead to most of the security exploits that you read about[<a
 href="#Secure_Programming_">SEC</a>].      &nbsp;In addition to the problems
 described above, it may be  possible  that the same memory chunk is returned
 back to the system multiple   times.  This obviously indicates a programming
 error. A programmer  may wish to see how the memory requests are made by
a program over the course  of the lifetime of the program in order to find
and fix bugs.<br>
               
<h3>Combating these problems</h3>
  There are some run time mechanisms to combat memory problems.  Leaks can
 be solved by periodically stopping and restarting the offending program
<cite></cite>  [<a href="#OOM_killer">OOM</a>]. Dangling pointers can  be
made repeatable  by zeroing out all memory returned back to the operating
 systems. Buffer  overflows have a variety of solutions, some of which are
described in more  detail <a
 href="http://www.geocities.com/madhumkurup/papers/Buffer.ps">here</a>.  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, the overhead of combating these problems at
 runtime or late in development cycle is so high  that finding them and
fixing  them at the program level is often the more optimal solution.<br>
               
<h2>Open Source </h2>
               
<h3>GCC-based alternatives</h3>
        The <a
 href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gcc/boehm-gc/">gcc</a>     toolset
now includes a garbage collector which facilitates the easy detection   
 and elimination of many memory problems. Note that while this can be used
    to detect leaks, the primary reason for creating this was to implement
 a  good garbage collector[<a href="#Garbage_Collectors">GC</a>]. This work
 is currently being led by Hans-J. Boehm at HP.&nbsp;        
<h4>Technology</h4>
        The technology used here is <a
 href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/gcdescr.html">Boehm-Demers-Weiser</a>
    technique for keeping track of allocated memory. Allocation of memory
is  done using the algorithm's version of the standard memory allocation
functions.  The program is then compiled with these functions and when executed,
the algorithm can analyze the behavior of the program. This algorithm is
fairly   well known and well understood. It should not cause any problems
and/or interfere   with programs. It can be made thread safe and can even
  scale onto  a multiprocessor system.<br>
               
<h4>Performance</h4>
        Good performance with reduction in speed in line with expectations. 
 The   code is extremely portable and is also available directly with gcc. 
 The version  shipped with gcc is slightly older, but can be upgraded.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no interface - it is difficult to use 
and   requires  much effort for it to be useful. Existing systems may not 
have  this compiler  configuration and may require some additional work to 
get it going. In addition,  in order for the calls to be trapped, all memory 
calls (such as <i>malloc()</i> and <i>free()</i> ) have to be replaced with 
equivalents  provided by the garbage collector. One could use a macro, but 
that is still  not very flexible.&nbsp; Also this approach implicitly requires 
source code for all pieces that require memory profiling with the ability 
to shift from the real functions to those provided.<br>
               
<h4>Verdict</h4>
        If you need a solution across multiple platforms (architectures,
operating  systems) where   you have control over all relevant source, this
could be  it.<br>
               
<h3>Memprof</h3>
        <a href="http://people.redhat.com/otaylor/memprof/">Memprof</a> is
 an  attractive  easy to use package, created by Owen Talyor of Red Hat. This 
 tool  is a nice  clean GNOME front-end to the Boehm-Demers-Weiser garbage 
collector.<br>
               
<h4>Technology</h4>
        At the heart of the profiling, memprof is no different from the toolset
 described above. However, how it implements this functionality is to trap
 all   memory requests from the program and redirect it at runtime to the
garbage   collector. While not as functional as the gcc alternative on threads
and  multiprocessors, the program can be asked to follow forks as they happen.<br>
               
<h4>Performance</h4>
       The performance of this tool is pretty good. The GUI was well designed,
   responsive and informative. This tools works directly with executables,
 and  it works without any changes needed to the source. This tool also graphically
 displays the memory profile as the program executes which helps in understanding 
   memory requirements of the program during its lifetime.<br>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This tool is currently available only for the x86 
 and   PPC architecture on Linux. If you need help on other platforms, you
  will need to look elsewhere. This tool is not a GTK application, it needs
  the full-blown GNOME environment. This may not be feasible everywhere.
   Finally, development on this tool appears to be static (version 0.4.1.
for  a while). While it is possible that it does what it is required to do
well,  it does not seem that this too will do anything more than just leak
 detection.<br>
                 
<h4>Verdict</h4>
         If you like GUI tools and don't mind GNOME and Linux, this is a
tool   for  you.<br>
               
<h3>Valgrind</h3>
        <a href="http://developer.kde.org/%7Esewardj/">Valgrind</a> is a
program     that attempts to solve a whole slew of memory problems, leaks
being just    one of them. This tool is the product of Julian Seward (of
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/index.html">bzip2</a> and <a
 href="http://www.cacheprof.org">cacheprof</a> fame). It terms itself "an open source 
  memory debugger for x86 linux" and it certainly fits that bill. In addition, 
  it can profile the usage of the CPU cache, something that is fairly unusual.
         
<h4>Technology</h4>
        The technology used in this program is fairly complex and <a
 href="http://developer.kde.org/%7Esewardj/docs/techdocs.html">well documented</a>.
    Each byte of memory allocated by the program is tracked by nine status
 bits,   which are then used for housekeeping purposes to identify what is
 going on.  At the cost of tremendously increasing the memory load of an
executing   program, this tool enables a much greater set of checks. As all
the reads   and writes are intercepted, cache profiling of the CPU's  various
L caches   can also be done.<br>
                 
<h4>Performance</h4>
        The tool was the slowest of the three detailed here, for obvious
reasons.    However, for the reduction in speed, this tool provides a wealth
of information    is probably the most detailed of the three. In addition
to the usual suspects,   this tool can identify a variety of other memory
and even some POSIX pthread   issues. Cache information is probably overkill
for most applications, but   it is an interesting way to look at the performance
of an application. The   biggest plus for Valgrind is that it is under rapid
development with a pro-active   developer and an active community. In fact
the web page of Valgrind proclaims   the following from the author - &nbsp;<i>"If
you have problems with Valgrind,  don't suffer  in silence.  Mail me."</i>.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tool however, is very x86 specific. Portability 
 is  fairly limited and to x86 Linux. The interface is purely command-line 
 driven  and while usable, sometimes the tool gives you too much information 
  for it to be useful. This tool also directly works with binaries, so while 
 recompiles  are not required, it will require diligence to go through the 
 output of this  tool to find what you are looking for. You can suppress memory
profiling  for various system libraries by creating suppression files, but
writing these  files is not easy. In addition, threading support is not complete,
 although this  tool has been used on Mozilla, OpenOffice and such other
large threaded programs. If this tool had a GUI front end, it would
win hands down.<br>
                 
<h4>Verdict</h4>
        If you are on x86 and know your code well and do not mind a CLI interface,
 this  program   will take you another level.<br>
         
<h3>Other Open Source tools</h3>
     Before I get sent to the stake for not having mentioned your favorite
 memory  tool, I must confess that few compare in completeness to these three
 in terms  of the data that they provide. A more&nbsp; comprehensive list
of leak detection  tools is available&nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.sslug.dk/emailarkiv/bog/2001_08/msg00030.html">here</a>. 
  <br>
               
<h2>Commercial</h2>
        These tools are mentioned here only for completeness.           
<h3>Purify</h3>
        The <a href="http://www.rational.com/products/pqc/pplus_ux.jsp">big 
 daddy</a>   of memory tools, does <i>not work</i> on Linux, so you can stop 
 asking that question.     
<h3>Geodesic</h3>
        A latecomer to this arena, <a
 href="http://www.geodesic.com/solutions/solutions_linux.html">Geodesic</a>
    is known most in the Linux community for their <a
 href="http://www.geodesic.com/solutions/products_gc_demo.html">Mozilla</a>
    demo, in which they use their tools to help find memory problems in the
  Mozilla  codebase. How much use this has been to the Mozilla team is yet
 to be quantified,  but their open-source friendliness can't hurt. Works
for  Solaris/Linux with  a fully functional trial. Works on Windows as well.<br>
         
<h3>Insure++</h3>
     A C++ specific tool, but still fairly well known, Parasoft's <a
 href="http://www.parasoft.com/jsp/products/home.jsp?product=Insure">Insure++</a> 
  is a fairly complete memory profiling / leak detection tool. In addition, 
it  can find some C++ specific errors as well, so that can't hurt. This tool 
 works with a variety of compilers and operating systems, a free trial version 
 is available too.          
<h2>Miscellaneous Notes:</h2>
       
<h3><a name="Secure_Programming_"></a>Secure Programming </h3>
    Secure programming involves many components, but probably the most significant
  is the careful use of memory. More details are available&nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.theorygroup.com/Theory/FAQ/Secure-Programs-HOWTO-1.html">here</a>.<br>
               
<h3><a name="OOM_killer"></a>OOM killer</h3>
     Some the newer Linux kernels employ an algorithm which is known as the 
Out  Of  Memory (OOM) killer. This code is invoked when the kernel completely 
runs out of memory, at which point active programs / processes are chosen 
to be executed (as in killed, end_of_the_road, happy hunting grounds, etc). 
More details are available&nbsp;<a
 href="http://linux-mm.org/docs/oom-killer.shtml">here</a>.<br>
         
<h3><a name="Garbage_Collectors"></a>Garbage Collectors   </h3>
        One of the other reasons why garbage collection is not always a preferred 
  solution is that it is really tough to implement. They have severe problems 
  with self-referential structures (i.e. structures that link to themselves) 
  as aptly described <a
 href="http://www.tuxedo.org/%7Eesr/jargon/html/Some-AI-Koans.html">here</a>.<br>
