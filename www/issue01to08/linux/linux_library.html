<HR>

<P>Welcome to the <B>Linux Library</B>!  Before we go much further let me explain
just what the Linux Library <I>is</I> and <I>is not</I>...

<H3>What the Linux Library is NOT</H3>
<P>This is not a collection of FAQ's, HOWTO's, Linux Documentation Project (LDP)
docs, or the usual stuff you'll find in any self-respecting &quot /doc &quot
directory in your favorite Linux archive.  As you've probably noticed by now,
Matt Welsh <I>et. al</I>, have done a marvelous job of collecting these sorts
of things and made them eminently accessible at the <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/linux.html">
Linux Documentation Project</A> homepage.  If you're looking for any of these,
go to Sunsite! :-)

<H3>What the Linux Library actually is</H3>
<P>It is an attempt to gather together something of the <I>rest</I> of the documents
that have been written and left lying around the Internet.  A lot of documentation
besides just FAQ's and HOWTO's has been written for various programs and is often
found at the archive sites where the source files reside.  Problem is, these documents
don't always make their way into the various distributions together with the
program files.  Hence, you can spend a LOT of time trying to figure out how to
set up, for example, Taylor UUCP 1.05 and not know that there's a handy How-To-Set-It-Up type
document available for it.  

<P>That's where the Linux Library comes in.

<P>Actually, that's where I've started.  What this really attempts to bring 
together are three things:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#software_docs">Software Documentation</A> for various programs which are not usually included
in the documentation subdirectories at most archive sites.
<LI>Links to the major <A HREF="#archive_sites">Archive Sites</A> for the larger software packages such as
XFree86 (X Window), Andrew User Interface System (AUIS), TeX and LaTeX (CTAN
archives), InterViews, and several others.
<LI>Links to <A HREF="#online_docs">On-Line Documentation</A> such as HTML authoring or setting up the
NCSA HTTPD Web Server.
</UL>

Admittedly, this is not going to be exhaustive,  but I've tried to include as
much as I can find initially and will add to it as time permits.  <B>Please
don't hesitate to email me and make suggestions regarding additions!</B>

<P>Enjoy!

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="software_docs">Software Documentation</A></H2>
<P>The following represents what I've been able, over a relatively short amount
of time, to cull from various archive sites.  Admittedly, this is far from
exhaustive.  I'll add to it as I can -- if you come across something that you
think would be helpful to others, let me know and I'll include it!

<H2><A NAME="archive_sites">Archive Sites</A></H2>

<DL>
<DT><B>Major Linux Archive Sites</B>
<DD>There are several major Linux archive sites including:
	<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="ftp://nic.funet.fi/pub/OS/Linux/">nic.funet.fi</A> in Finland
	<LI><A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/">sunsite.unc.edu</A> at University of North Carolina
	<LI><A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/">tsx-11.mit.edu</A> at M.I.T. in Boston
	</UL>
These are major software repositories and most have a large number of mirror
sites.  Mirror sites are generally preferable as they carry <EM>exactly</EM> the
same software and are usually less crowded.

<DT><B>Andrew User Interface System (AUIS)</B>
<DD>Developed and available at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/AUIS/"> 
Carnegie Mellon University</A>, the Andrew User Interface System is an X Window
system encompassing software development, WYSIWYG word processing, and
mail handling.  Impressive and huge.

<DT><B>X Windows XFree86 Project</B>
<DD>The X Window system was originally developed at <A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/X11/">
Massachusetts Institute of Technology</A> where ongoing development of the freely
available <B>XFree86</B> version continues.

<DT><B>InterViews</B>
<DD>InterViews was developed by the folks at <A HREF="ftp://interviews.stanford.edu/pub/">
Stanford University</A>.  It's an extensive graphical environment that incorporates
a C++ interface.  The system includes a WYSIWYG text editor (doc), a vector-oriented
drawing program (idraw), an interface interface builder (ibuild), and a C++ class
browser (iclass).

<DT><B>GNU Software</B>
<DD>GNU (&quot <B>G</B>NU's <B>N</B>OT <B>U</B>NIX) &quot) software repository
at <A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">Massachusett's Institute of Technology</A>
remains a veritable cornucopia of excellent software.  Often considered better
than the original version, GNU software forms much of the foundational utilites
and programs for most Linux distributions.  This is a fun place to browse.

<DT><B>Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN)</B>
<DD>The <A HREF="ftp://ftp.shsu.edu/tex-archive/">Sam Houston State University</A> 
CTAN archive provides a wealth of information, software, documentation, and helps
for those interested in running Donald's Knuth's venerable TeX text-formatting
system.  If you're interested in, or simply having to use, TeX or LaTeX then
this is the place for you!

<DT><B>VI Editor archives</B>
<DD>There are actually a couple of extensive <B>vi editor</B> archive sites that
contain a number of helpful reference and tutorials to this revered editor:
	<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="ftp://cs.uwp.edu/pub/vi/">cs.uwp.edu</A>
	<LI><A HREF="ftp://alf.uib.no:/pub/vi/">alf.uib.no</A>
	</UL>
It also contains a variety of vi fix-me-ups to make using this rather spartan
editor a bit more pleasurable.

<DT><B>Kermit</B>
<DD>And talking about venerable old software... :-)<BR>
The Kermit telecommunications program developed at <A HREF="ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/">
Columbia University</A> is clearly one of the most widely ported programs in the
civilized (?) world.  Neither the fastest nor the most glamorous, this is the
comm program to use if you're having to communicate between widely disparate
platforms... besides, your friends will be very impressed when you
can tell them that you actually <EM>enjoy and know how to use</EM> this great
program. :-)

<DT><B>Sunsite .AU Sound file Collection</B>
<DD>If you've got a sound card then you <EM>need</EM> to check out the huge collection
of .au sound files located at the
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/multimedia/sun_sounds/">University of North Carolina's Sunsite</A>
archive.  A veritable smorgasbord of sound clips for trekkies, Monty Python fans, and
serious TV addicts.  

<DT><B>Kerberos</B>
<DD>OK... here's another major league package from the UN*X gurus at 
<A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/">MIT</A>.  Kerberos is a network security
package to keep all those hackers, crackers, and phreaks at bay.  Since I
don't run a network I can't tell you much about this one... it's here for
you guys that need such things.

goodly helping of information about installation, administration, and trouble-shooting.

<DT><A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html">NCSA's httpd</A> Online Documentation

<DT><B>HTML Authoring Helps</B>
<DD>There are innumerable online docs to help get your HTML authorship skills
honed.  For starters try:

<UL>

	National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)</A>.
