Is there a version of chmod/chown that recursively changes files only
if they're different from the specification?  The stock version
changes them unconditionally, which updates their 'ctime' and thus
makes 'rsync' transfer the inode properties even if there's no real
change.  I could write a Python version, but I was hoping there might
be a C version somewhere that would be more efficient with millions of
filenames.

<p>
By 'specification' do you mean a RPM spec file?
</p>

<pre>
rpm -V package to see what has changed
rpm --setperms and --setugids
</pre>

<p>
would do the trick.

 I guess he meant from what you specify - eg, if you chmod 777 a file,
and its already 777, it should skip the file, not set the permissions
again.

Yes, use find(1) to do this.

+1 on that...

<p>
find . -user xuser1 -exec chown -R user2 {} \;

<p>
or

<p>
find . -perm -220

No.  Not like that.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; or
&gt; 
&gt; find . -perm -220
</pre>

<p>
... and yes, exactly like that, if only because find will call stat(2)
directly to determine this, and if I am reading the source correctly for
find, it won't touch the file if it's matched the permission.  (It's unclear
from Mike whether "-perm /200" is more applicable here or not, but it's
academic at this point.)

Thanks.  I'll need to make it a bit more elaborate than that though
because I want to avoid '-R' completely.  What I really want to do is
find files that don't have a 'user1:group1:mode1' combination and
change those.  I guess I can do several finds over the same tree, or
make a Python program to set up the finds (which might be more
flexible anyway).

<p>
By the way, hi Anderson from long ago when I used to edit your
articles. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  Thanks for your help.

No need.  I guarantee you that find can do it all for you.

<p>
You find some of the techniques used here applicable:
