<center><h1>KDE and Gnome</h1></center>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>Watching the Linux operating system begin to mature is interesting these
days.  A couple of years ago much attention was devoted to incompatibilities
with various hardware components, networking, and the development of the
kernel itself.  Though these activities continue, it's no longer necessary to
follow these development efforts as closely in order to run a dependable Linux
system.  Distributions have improved immensely, and now more free-software
developers are turning their attention towards refinement and integration of
the user interface.  Two separate projects have arisen in the past year, KDE
(the K Desktop Environment) and GNOME (the Gnu Network Object Model
Environment).  Both of these projects include among their stated goals the
desire to make the administration and usage of a Linux system easier for
beginners, in part by employing a uniform look-and-feel for the most commonly
used applications and utilities, as well as interoperability of the system
components.  It's difficult to make much of a comparison between the two, as
KDE is much farther along than GNOME, but I'll make an attempt.

<center><h3>Commonalities</h3></center>

<p>There is one common structural aspect to these two projects.  They each
rely on a group of shared libraries, which provides the interface to basic OS
operations, such as file-reading and saving, as well as basic display and
appearance functions.  The end result of this is that an installation will
populate adirectory with a variety of shared libraries, which in turn
supports another directory of fairly small executables.  The Gimp works this
way as well; the individual plug-ins tand to be small, but rely on the
services provided by both the GTK and the Gimp shared libs.  This approach
facilitates contributions by programmers not directly involved with a project,
as many of the low-level and window-display functions are already written,
allowing a contributed application or extension to "hook" into them.

<center><h3>KDE</h3></center>

<p>The first of the two to gain momentum was KDE.  About a year ago a group of
developers, mainly European, began coding the components of this ambitious
project.  They chose the Qt toolkit (from TrollTech in Norway) as the GUI
framework, a decision which has since led to some controversy. Qt has a few
licensing restrictions which, though not onerous for end-users, can cause
problems for the creators of CDROM-based distributions.  Advocates of
GNU-style free software tend not to favor Qt, a circumstance which led to the
creation of the GNOME project.

<p>Setting aside the thorny licensing issues, the KDE developers have managed
to pull together quite a remarkable system in the past year, though numerous
bugs still remain evident.  The second public beta was released in November of 
1997, and I compiled and installed it soon after.  (I had briefly tried the
initial beta, but found it too unstable to evaluate).    

<p>This second release still has flaky aspects, but enough of it works to give 
the user an idea of what the developers are planning to accomplish.  In effect 
KDE is a sort of GUI wrapper around an existing Linux system, which attempts
to simplify system-administration tasks and offer interacting and compatible
utilities and applications.  Kfm is at the core of the system, as it is
intended to be left running in the background and serves as the help-viewer
for all of the KDE components.  Kfm is also a file-manager (icon-based, with
some resemblance to xfm and moxfm) and serves creditably as a web-browser.

<p>Kfm is an impressive application, and in itself justifies trying out KDE.
Many of the other applications are replacements for programs which most Linux
users probably already have and would only be desirable if a complete KDE
system is the goal. 

<p>KDE has its own window-manager, kwm, which had some display faults on my
system.  Due to these video artifacts I didn't use it much, but it did appear
stylish and well-designed.  It seems that these display bugs don't show up on
most systems; I suspect that it depends upon the video-card and X-server in
use.

<p>A new Linux user (especially someone accustomed to Windows or Macintosh
systems) might appreciate the relative ease of configuration and use which KDE
offers.  In a sense, KDE extends the scope of the tasks traditional
distributions perform.  One drawback might be the very comfort of the KDE
environment itself; the various system-administration tasks outside of KDE's
abilities might seem too daunting or unapproachable without a KDE interface.
This won't be seen as a drawback to prospective users who lack the fascination
with internals and configuration which in the past has typified Linux users.

<p>Some KDE users have reported that they find the system usable and useful,
but with my particular setup this wasn't the case.  But I have to say that my
extensively customized Linux installation seems perfectly satisfactory as is,
and I probably lack the motivation to spend the time learning to adapt KDE to
my needs.  If KDE had existed back when I first booted up a Slackware system
some years ago, who knows...

<center><h3>GNOME</h3></center>

<p>Miguel Icaza (head of the Midnight Commander development group) also seems
to be at the helm of the new GNOME development project, which has goals
similar to those of KDE, with one difference: the project is composed
completely of GNU-style free software.  This project is based upon the GTK
toolkit, the free successor to Motif in the Gimp development efforts.  The
project arose as a direct response to the KDE project, and the GNOME
developers have borrowed some code from KDE for a few of the applets.

<p>As of late December (version 0.10) GNOME as a whole isn't really suitable
for actual use, but several of the applets function well and the future looks
bright for the project.  Miguel Icaza is in the process of porting the
Midnight Commander file-manager to GTK, which will let it fit in with the
remainder of the GNOME applications.

<p>The Panel applet, written primarily by Federico Mena Quintero, is an
icon-bar and program-launcher which locates itself at the bottom edge of the
screen.  It features cascading menus which could be a substitute for the usual
window-manager root menus.  Most of the GNOME applets have been included in
the default menu of Panel, allowing this applet to serve as an entry-point to
the GNOME installation.  It takes a little fiddling around to get the hang of
using Panel, so don't give up if at first glance it seems like nothing is 
working

<p>The provided applets include a desktop-manager (which in part serves as an
interface to the <b>Xlockmore</b> screensaver), CroMagnon (an interface to
the crontab utility), an audio mixer, an interface to the elaborate LinuxConf
configuration manager, several nicely-done games (some of which were adapted
from KDE), and several others.  

<p>One major difference between GNOME and KDE is that KDE includes a
window-manager, whereas GNOME doesn't, and is designed to cooperate with a
user's current window-manager.  This may make GNOME more appealing to seasoned 
users who have extensively customized their window-manager resource files.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>As I write this only the source code is available for GNOME 0.10, and it's
tricky to compile.  An intel-Linux binary archive of the 0.9 release is
available from <a href="ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/GNOME">this site</a>, but I
would recommend waiting a while for either an updated binary release or an
easier-to-build source release.  The developers are hard at work these days
(judging by their mailing-list postings) and I think that, given time,
something both interesting and usable will appear. 

<p>Though KDE is closer to being "finished" (if such a state even
exists in the realm of software), it still has a ways to go.  Development is
proceeding rapidly, and I imagine that sometime this year a more polished
release will become available.

<p>The fate of a free-software project is interesting because of the inherent
unpredictability.  Anyone can start one, but whether it comes to fruition or
withers on the vine is up to the inscrutable software gods.  The timing may be
just right (i.e., it addresses many users (and developers!) needs) but
convincing enough programmers with time and inclination to become involved just
can't be forced or foretold.  These two projects seem to have attained that
essential momentum, and hopefully we shall see them evolve further.
