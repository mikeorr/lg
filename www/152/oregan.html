<h1>Apertium: Open source machine translation</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</a></b></p>

<h3>About Apertium</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.apertium.org">Apertium</a> is an open source
shallow-transfer machine translation (MT) system. In addition to the translation
engine, it also provides tools for manipulating linguistic data, and
translators designed to run using the engine. At the time of writing, there
are stable bilingual translators available for English-Catalan,
English-Spanish, Catalan-Spanish, Catalan-French, Spanish-Portuguese,
Spanish-Galician, and French-Spanish; as well as monolingual translators
that translate from Esperanto to Catalan and to Spanish, and from Romanian
to Spanish. There are also a number of unstable translators in various
stages of development. (A <a
href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/List_of_language_pairs">list of
language pairs</a>, updated daily, is available on the <a
href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Main_Page">Apertium wiki</a>).
</p>

<p>
In other words, Apertium is the open-source Systran (the engine that
powers <a href="http://babelfish.yahoo.com">Babelfish</a>).
</p>

<p>
Apertium version 1 was based on existing translators that had been designed 
by the <a href="http://transducens.dlsi.ua.es/">Transducens group</a> at the 
<a href="http://www.ua.es/">Universitat d'Alacant</a>, and funded by the 
<a href="http://www.opentrad.com/">OpenTrad consortium</a>. Subsequent 
development has been funded by the university, as well as by
<a href="http://www.prompsit.com/">Prompsit Language Engineering</a>. 
While Apertium 1 was designed with the Romance languages of Spain in mind,
Apertium 2 added support for less-related languages (Catalan-English); 
Apertium 3 added Unicode support.
</p>

<p>
Apertium is designed according to the Unix philosophy: translation is 
performed in stages by a set of tools that operate on a simple text stream. 
Other tools can be added to the pipeline as required, and the text stream can 
be modified using standard tools. There is also a wrapper script (called
simply <tt>apertium</tt>) that takes care of most of the details.
</p>

<pre>
$ echo 'Esta es Gloria, mi amiga argentina'|apertium es-en
This is Gloria, my Argentinian friend
</pre>

<p>
(That example was picked at random from 'Teach Yourself Spanish Grammar' - 
translation quality is not always that high, though).
</p>

<p>
Apertium packages are available for Debian and Ubuntu 
(<tt>apt-get install apertium</tt>); packages are not yet available for 
other distributions, though it has been used successfully on several
distributions. The mildly curious may prefer to try the
<a href="http://www.apertium.org/?id=surfandtranslate">Surf and Translate</a>
demo on the Apertium Web site.

</p>

<p>
I intend to follow this article with articles of a more tutorial nature;
the rest of this article is intended to give an explanation of the most 
common terms in machine translation. 
</p>

<h3>Types of Machine Translation</h3>

<p>
Machine translation systems differ in sophistication, and there are several 
basic approaches to translation. At the basic level, any translation 
system has to include dictionary lookup; however, this can also use a <em>stemmer</em>
to find the basic form of a word (instead of looking up 'beers' in the
dictionary, it looks up 'beer'), or a <em>morphological analyser</em> (which operates
much like a stemmer, but also includes grammatical information - Apertium's
analyser would return <tt>beer&lt;n&gt;&lt;pl&gt;</tt> from the word 'beers',
to tell the rest of the system that the word is a noun, and plural).
</p>

<p>
<em>Rule-based</em> systems were the first 'real' kind of machine
translation system. Rather than simply translating word to word, rules
are developed that allow for words to be placed in different places, to
have different meaning depending on context, etc. The <a
href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/701/701_translator.html">Georgetown-IBM
experiment</a> in 1954 was one of the first rule-based machine
translation systems; Systran and Apertium are RBMT systems.
</p>

<p>
<em>Example Based Machine Translation (EBMT)</em> systems translate
using the results of previous translations.  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_memory">Translation
Memory</a> systems are the most basic example of EBMT; more complicated
TM systems (such as <a href="http://www.omegat.org/">OmegaT</a>), which
use techniques such as fuzzy matching to suggest similar translations,
are closer to the original idea behind EBMT.
</p>

<p>
<em>Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)</em> is, at its most basic, a
more complicated form of word translation, where statistical weights are
used to decide the most likely translation of a word. Modern SMT systems
are phrase-based rather than word-based, and assemble translations using
the overlap in phrases.  <a
href="http://www.google.com/translate_t">Google Translate</a> is based
on SMT; there is also an open-source system for SMT called <a
href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/">Moses</a>.  
</p>

<p>
Interlingua systems are an extension of rule-based systems that use an
intermediate language instead of direct translation. Systems based on
Interlingua can then more readily translate between various combinations
of languages.  <a href="http://logos-os.dfki.de/">OpenLogos</a> is an
open-source Interlingua-based machine translator, based on the Logos
system; a competitor of Systran.  
</p>

<p>
Transfer-based systems are another approach to rule-based machine
transfer, influenced by the Interlingua idea. Instead of using a whole
language, an intermediate representation of equivalent pieces is used.
This still uses language-pair-specific translation, but the amount of
language-specific rules are reduced to a minimum. There are two kinds of
transfer-based translation: shallow transfer (syntactic), where words
are translated based on combinations of word types; and deep transfer
(semantic), which uses a representation of the meaning of each word as a
basis for how it should be translated.  
</p>

<p>
Most current machine translation systems are hybrid systems: Moses is
primarily SMT, but can use morphological analysers to add extra
confidence in translation options; Apertium uses statistical methods for
word sense disambiguation.  
</p>

<p>
SMT is the current focus of most serious research in MT, but rule-based
systems still have a number of advantages. First and foremost, SMT
systems require the availability of a large amount of text in both
languages<sup><a href="#note1" name="note-1">1</a></sup>, which for most
language pairs is not available. Secondly, the generated dictionaries
contain all likely word combinations for both languages, which both
consume a lot of memory and take much more processing time than do the
kind of dictionaries used in rule-based systems (which also have the
advantage of being useful as human-readable dictionaries - <a
href="http://www.tinylex.com">TinyLex</a> is a Java ME program for
bilingual dictionaries that uses Apertium data).
</p>

<p>
Another aspect of SMT that may or may not be a drawback, depending on your
perspective, is that they use monolingual models as a way of determining how
to combine the phrases they translate. The upside is that, unless they
encounter words that don't exist in their dictionaries, the output will 
be of better quality than with rule-based translation. The downside is that
this translation may bear very little relation to the source sentence.
With a rule-based system, a bad translation will look like garbage.
</p>

<h3>Why Open Source Translation?</h3>

<p>
The best translations depend on the closeness of the languages involved: all 
other things being equal, a Spanish - Portuguese translator will give a better 
translation than a Spanish - English translator. Another factor is the domain:
words that could be ambiguous in general use may only have one meaning in a
specific context. This is well known, and for this reason, most commercial
translation systems provide the ability to choose specific domains, and to
specify meanings in a user-defined dictionary that can override the system 
dictionary.
</p>

<p>
What they don't provide, however, is a way to specify custom rules. 
</p>

<p>
In the majority of machine translation uses, documents are translated in
bulk, and later edited. Human translators are expensive, and machine
translation is used to reduce this cost, or even to remove it entirely. 
In the majority of cases, the human editor will be expected to follow an 
in-house style guide; even if the translation is accurate and clear, it
would most likely still require editing to conform to this style guide.
Even if the translator can't give better accuracy, it can still reduce 
expense by reducing the amount of editing a document requires.
</p>

<p>
The usual solution to this is to combine translation memory with automatic
translation. A better solution would be to combine translation memory
with a fully customisable machine translator - an open source machine
translator.
</p>

<p>
SMT is starting to be used by companies who seek to provide 'bespoke'
machine translators with example-based features, which can adapt as
corrections are made to the translation. However, as the selection
of a phrase is based on the amount of occurrences, the same correction
has to be made a number of times - potentially hundreds or even
thousands of times.
</p>

<p>
Consider this example:
</p>

<blockquote>
Wol&#281; piek&#322;o chaosu od piek&#322;a porz&#261;dku.<sup><a href="#note2" name="note-2">2</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Polish, the preposition 'od' means 'from', with a few exceptions. The
above sentence is one example of such an exception:
</p>

<blockquote>
I prefer the hell of chaos <strong>to</strong> the hell of order.
</blockquote>

<p>
Writing a rule in Apertium to say that the preposition 'od' is 'to' 
following the verb 'wole&#263;' is quite simple, and takes a <em>lot</em>
less time than does writing enough examples for an SMT-based translator to
infer the same, and doesn't carry the risk of harming cases that were
previously handled correctly. 
</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Future</h3>

<p>
I hope I've made some of you more interested in Apertium: my next article
will be a tutorial covering the creation of morphological analysers in 
Apertium. Anyone too impatient for that can find more information on the
<a href="http://wiki.apertium.org">Apertium wiki</a>, and there are usually
a number of people available on <tt>#apertium</tt> on irc.freenode.org
available to answer questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="note1" href="#note-1">1</a>

In a <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/D/D07/D07-1005.pdf">paper</a>
from Google Research, they describe a method of overcoming this problem by
using the statistical translation probabilities of multiple languages (which
they have used recently, in their newest language additions); essentially,
cross-referencing multiple bilingual dictionaries to create new ones. The
tool that does this in Apertium is called <tt>apertium-crossdics</tt>.
(The paper also suggests that "One solution is to create such parallel data 
by automatic translation and then retaining reliable translations by using 
confidence metrics", which is a bit like saying that infinite monkeys can at 
least <em>translate</em> the works of Shakespeare).
