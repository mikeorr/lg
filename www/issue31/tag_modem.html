<p><strong>From WEMehl on Fri, 03 Jul 1998 

<br><br>
I purchased an <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> Aptiva last fall.  
It came with a LTwin modem installed. It tells me that its max speed is 
115K, but I never seem to be able to run at more than 34K.  Is it the 
modem (if so can I upgrade) or is it something to do with 
<a href="http://www.aol.com/">AOL</a>? Thanks.

  I think that this is a shameful bit of marketeering on the part of 
  whatever docs tell you this.   They probably mean "115K if you get
  better than average compression under ideal phone line conditions."
<br><br>

 Currently the highest speeds attainable by modems over traditional 
 telephone lines is about 56Kbps --- and that is asymetric.  In other
 words you can download stuff at close to 56K under ideal line 
 conditions --- but your upload speed will not approach that (a 
 non-issue for most Internet "web surfers" --- but it would have been
 a major issue for the old BBS users who used to run their Fido boards
 and use QWK messaging.
<br><br>

 I have no idea what AOL is currently doing.  It is likely that they
 haven't upgraded all of their modems (Points of Presence) to 56K 
 at this point --- and it's even more unlikely that they would have 
 upgraded their entire infrastructure to ensure that their hosts and
 LAN's would have the capacity and bandwidth to feed those thousands
 of high speed modems <em>at full speed</em>.
<br><br>

 As for upgrading --- you can almost certainly upgrade your modem.
 I've been working with PC clones for over a decade and I've never seen
 one that had a *modem* hardwired into the motherboard.  I've seen some
 with inferior serial ports --- serial ports with buggy and slow 16450 
 UART chips that couldn't be replaced or disabled.  However, this is 
 probably a typical internal modem --- just rip it out and throw it 
 away.  I personally recommend external modems.  
<br><br>

 For real speed upgrades you can get ISDN and FRAD (frame relay access
 devices) for PC's that are supported by Linux and can take you past
 modem speeds all the way up do T1.  You can also pop in an ethernet
 card (10Mbps) and get an ADSL or a cablemodem (router).  Naturally 
 you can't use this over your existing telco lines --- and you'd probably
 really hate to see how much a leased line (frame relay) or ISDN (metered
 service in most areas --- a penny a minute adds up pretty quick!) 
 would cost.  As for ADSL and cablemodem services --- the coverage 
 and availability are pretty spotty and the pricing isn't what an 
 AOL user is likely to be interested in spending.
<br><br>

 What really makes me curious about your message are two things:
   <blockquote>

	Are you running Linux?  Is that a "Winmodem"?  (The model
	designation certainly sounds like one).
   <br><br>

	If you're running Linux to access AOL --- what are you using
	to do it?  The AOL reps I've talked to have shown <em>no</em> interest
	in making Linux, Unix, Java, or other portable versions of their
	interfaces avaialable --- and hostility at the notion of 
	documenting their protocols and API's to the point where anyone 
	else could do a free implementation.
	<br><br>

	<em>[ Actually, their Instant Messenger is available in Java, and
	a recent note I sent their web staff asking after a Linux version of
	the main client got a friendly "we've forwarded that suggestion" 
	note back, from two different people. So, times change?  Meanwhile 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</a> is 
	rumored to have some success with AOL.  But if you're using something
	Linux native, I'd really like to know what it is. -- Heather ]</em>
   <br><br>

	If you're not running Linux, and you're not asking about 
	anything that's even vaguely Linux or Unix related... why are
	you posting a message to the 
<em><a href="http://www.linuxgazette.net/">Linux Gazette</a></em> "Answer Guy"?
	(No, I didn't pick the title --- my editors did that).
   </blockquote>

 As a final comment, I usually don't care much about questions like
 this one.  People read a bit of marketing fluff on the box or in the 
 ads for a product --- they draw an unrealistic conclusion based on an
 interpretation that's best described with the phrase "wishful thinking"
 then they perform highly unscientific metrics and benchmarks on which
 the fail to perform the most elementary critical analysis (of their
 experimental design, their results or their conclusions) --- and then,
 unsatisfied with their results they write to some unrelated support 
 guy hoping for a magical incantation that will make the product work
 as they <em>thought it would</em> from what they <em>thought</em> the marketers 
 meant in the <em>advertising</em> that they read.
 <br><br>

 If you're getting unsatisfactory results from this product --- talk
 to your vendor.  You paid them for it.  If you're just trying to see
 if your "missing out" (that some other people might actually be getting
 consistent 115K throughput on these) --- don't worry, it's not happening.
