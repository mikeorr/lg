<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far we have considered machines which have only a single
processor (known as the Central Processor Unit). Becoming more common these
days are multi-processor machines which may have a number of processors
(for example four or thirty two) which may provide true concurrency to
multiple tasks running on the machine. On these machines the <A HREF="schedule.html">scheduler</A>
will arrange for the execution of processes to occur in a manner selected
to take maximum advantage of the available processing capacity. Asymmetric
multiprocessing (ASMP) operating systems typically select one processor
to run operating system code, with the other processors running user jobs.
Problems with such systems include a lack of portability of the operating
system to other platforms. Symmetric multiprocessing systems (SMPs), which
include Linux, Sun's Solaris and Windows NT each allow the operating system
to run on any or all of the available processors, sharing memory between
them. The central unit for execution on such machines is the thread, with
multiple threads of a single process having the possibility to be spread
across multiple processors. The scheduling task on an SMP computer can
become extremely complex.</FONT>
