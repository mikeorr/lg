<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>You are doing some work on your home PC, connected to your favorite ISP - and
you decide you want to print a Word document on the high-speed color printer
at your office.
That printer is connected to the corporate LAN, but you can't talk to it
using LPR or IPP because it is hidden behind the corporate firewall.</p>

<p>You could perform a print-to-file operation, then email the file to somebody
at your office, and get them to send it to the printer. But there are a few
steps here - and it gets more complicated if there is a restriction on the
length of email messages which can be passed through one of the servers
along the way. You will then have to perform some sort of file-split operation
and send the individual parts.</p>

<h2>Client Software</h2>

<p>The people who make <a href="http://www.brother.com">Brother</a> printers thought
of all this, and developed a set of Windows printer drivers. These enable
users to print directly to a designated email address. The print-job is
automatically split into parts if necessary, and each part is base64-encoded
prior to transmission. Users can also nominate an address for email
confirmation.</p> 

<p>These Windows printer drivers (for Windows 95/98, and for Windows
NT-4.0/2000) can be downloaded from the Brother website.</p>

<h2>Printer Capabilities</h2>

<p>What the Brother people expect users to do their printing on is, of course,
a Brother printer - specifically, in this instance, one equipped with a
network card able to accept, decode and re-assemble mail messages directed
to it.</p>

<p>But what if you wish to print on a printer from another manufacturer?</p>

<h2>Doing it in Software</h2>

<p>My first stab at this was a Korn-shell program to which appropriate
incoming mail items were piped via a sendmail alias.  The program used
'awk' to extract information such as job and part number, then decoded
each such item into an appropriately named file in a designated directory.</p>

<p>After receiving a part, the program marked it as "complete", then
set an anti-simultaneity lock and went through a procedure to determine
if all necessary parts had been received in full. If they had, it
concatenated them in sequence, piped the result to the nominated printer,
and deleted them.</p>

<p>It was then that I started thinking: "What if there isn't enough room
to store all the parts for all the jobs which may currently be arriving?"
And: "How do the Brother people do it on a network card?"</p>

<h2>Doing it Without Local Storage</h2>

<p>The answer to my second question is: "They use a POP3 server!". The
components of each job stay on that server until the network card determines
that all necessary parts are available, at which stage it sucks them down
and decodes them in sequence, sending the output to the printer mechanism,
and requests their deletion from the server.</p>

<p>So here's how it can be done on a Linux machine. The program has been
written in Perl so that the NET::POP3 module can be used for easy access to
a POP3 server. It has been tested on both NetBSD and Solaris machines, so it
should work almost anywhere; all you'll have to change are the location of
the Perl interpreter, the name used for 'awk', and the format of the 'lpr'
command.

<h2>Program Walk-Through</h2>

<p>The program builds a small 'awk' program for later use; then, for each
printer declared on it's command line, it accesses a mailbox of the same
name and examines each message therein. If a message is stale, it is
deleted. Otherwise the contents of some Brother-specific lines are
extracted; these indicate
whether email notification is required, and which part of which job
is contained in the message.</p>

<p>If, during examination of a message, it is determined that all the parts
of its corresponding job have been seen in the mailbox, an email
notification is generated if required, and the parts are
extracted in sequence and piped via the 'awk' program (which decodes each
part as it arrives) to an appropriate printer command. Each part is deleted
as soon as it has been processed in this manner.</p>

<p>Ideally, we should wait
until success (or other) notification of print submission was obtained
before performing the email and deletion tasks; however, as noted in the
listing, this requires some local storage. In a like vein, whilst the
Brother client software allows selection of email notification for
several different conditions, we send notification of job submission unless
"None" has been selected.</p>

<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>

<p>This program contains a password, so it should be readable only by the user
who will execute it. No special privileges are required for execution, and your
entry for it in /etc/inittab should look something like:
<pre>bi:345:respawn:su - nobody -c "/usr/local/bin/BIPprint.pl lp1 lp2 &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1"</pre>

<p>If you have read this far, you are probably saying: "OK, so the program
doesn't need much local storage - but it sends its output to a print
spooler!  How bad is that?"  If the size of your spool area is of
concern, you can use something like 'netcat' or 'hpnpout' to send the job
directly to a printer port instead of spooling it. Or you may be able to
pipe your job through an FTP connection to your printer. If you do
bypass the spooler in this fashion, you should use a separate instance
of the program for each printer.</p>

<p>It's not rocket science, and there's no user-authentication or
content-encryption. But it may make your life a little easier. Enjoy!</p>
