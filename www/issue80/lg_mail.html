Hello,

Hi!

<P><STRONG>
I want to install a Linux on my PC. This PC has a Ethernet connection
towards a DSL modem. Across this Ethernet I had to use PPPOE. Is their an
image available with PPPOE support? The standard netboot.img has no support
for PPPOE. This image recognize my Ethernet but thus not allow me to
activate PPPOE across it.

I want to install Redhat 7.3 across the net.

Does anyone know of a reliable utility to alter parameters on an

In particular whether there is anything that will get rid of

I would just recompile personally but if anyone knows of a tool that

<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
I have a USB ethernet adapter based on the Pegasus/Pegasus-II chipset.  I tried to use
the pegasus driver with a 2.4.3 kernel but the driver is not claiming the vend/prod id
of the USB adapter.  Unfortunately I am unable to recompile a more recent kernel for
my system.  I would like to know if there is a way to spoof the vend/prod id somehow
(without flashing the USB adapter) so the pegasus driver claims the device. I am
thinking there is perhaps some kernel mechanism to increase the set of devices claimed
by a particular driver at runtime.  I think a more recent kernel version would solve
my problems but a recompile is not an option for me because of my particular setup.
Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
Ebo

Hello Jim,
</P>
<P>
Thanks so much for the note.  And yes, it's me.  Since the last submission
(now a couple years ago) I've been rather busy finishing up medical
training (Pathology and Medical Informatics at Yale) and my wife and I have
adopted a little girl from China (with another one on the way).  Thomas
Adam (the new maintainer of the Weekend Mechanic column) and I just started
corresponding and I took the opportunity to look over the latest edition of
the LG.  The folks at SSC have done a commendable job of keeping the LG
alive and very active.  I really appreciate the great job they've done.
</P>

cheers,
<br>John

I am enjoying it very much and I'm eager to learn
something about the 80x86 protected mode.

I also have a suggestion. In part II, I think the code for write.c can
be improved a little.
</P>
<P>
When reading sect2 with

<blockquote><pre>   file_desc = open("./sect2", O_RDONLY);
   read(file_desc, boot_buf, 510);
   close(file_desc);
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
instead of reading only 510, you can actually read 512 bytes with no
harm.
</P>
<P>
It doesn't hurt to be 510, but I think it would be more easy to
understand it's 512,
so that learners won't be thinking that the second sector also have to
finish with the magic numbers x55 xAA, just like the first sector does.

I'd like to know what do you think about it and if you agree.

At our company there has been some discussion as to the differences of the Journal
and the Gazette. Would you please respond with SSC's definitive description
of the difference and is both being published at this time. Thereby we can
put to rest any further discussion at our work place.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Regards,
<br>Wyman Griffin
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Linux Journal is a commercial print magazine.  Linux Gazette is a free e-zine
that SSC donates some employee time to.  LG was started by an individual, John
Fisk, then SSC took over responsibility for it when John no longer could.
</P>
<P>
LJ pays authors for their work.  It has a stricter standard for what it will
accept, does professional proofreading and technical editing, won't publish
anything that's been published elsewhere (with occasional exceptions), and doesn't
allow republishing without permission.  Each LJ issue has a theme, and articles
are solicited for that theme (although any issue will have lots of non-theme
articles too).  Space issues determine the number of articles and their length.
(Because the printer prints on 32-page sheets,  you have to add
pages in groups of eight.)  LJ also publishes several series of publicly-accessible
web articles at <A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com"
	>http://www.linuxjournal.com</A>, for which we pay the authors just
like magazine articles.  (The magazine articles are also available to the public
after three months.)  For specific questions about LJ, contact the Linux Journal
Editor, <A HREF="mailto:ljeditor@ssc.com"
	>ljeditor@ssc.com</A>.
</P>
<P>
LG does not pay authors, does less time-consuming proofreading, and publishes
pretty much anything we have permission to publish that's about Linux, contains
some significant content of a more or less permanent nature ("new information"
or reference material), doesn't unfairly slam/slander anybody, and isn't a
mindless advocacy rant.  But we don't go looking for content, we let it come
to us.  LG issues do not have a theme, we just publish articles whenever
they arrive.  There is no particular number of pages to fill, so we don't pay
attention to article count or article length, although we do try to keep the issue
size to less than 2 MB compressed (occasionally 4 MB).  LG does not accept
advertisements, although we do have a sponsorship program that gets your logo
on the home page.  LG is published under the Open Publication License, so
readers may copy and redistribute it (for free or profit) as much as they wish.

Point being, that the informational difference between their/they're, or more
appropriately, between "kernel core team has soundly reject suggestions that
Linux adopt..." and "kernel core team has soundly rejected suggestions that

native English speaker. Don't let him get too down on you -- we just are
pampered by having a MLA in the first place to standardize these issues.

Hi all!
Well, there is this "Is linux dead?" comment on <TT>/.</TT> and in the MSNBC
article (<A HREF="http://www.msnbc.com/news/772215.asp"
	>http://www.msnbc.com/news/772215.asp</A>) Fabor is quoted rather
extensively. The <TT>/.</TT> news comment is really bad (doesn't fit at all)
but Fabor comes along really nice.
</STRONG></P>

Thansk for the compliment.  When I first read the article, I was
sounding like Chandler Bing's ex-girlfriend on "Friends"

<blockquote>
&lt;Janice&gt;Oh - my - gawd!&lt;/Janice&gt;

The article was, IMO, a back-handed compliment.

<P><STRONG>
As a question to fabor: Why do you say (as the article quotes) "It's
for geeks"?
I mean, we're mostly geeks (ok, all) but those people who
write us with questions are most certainly not geeks (most of them)
since then they would probably figured out the thing themselves. These
lusers might have some probs with "linux" but only because when they
buy some win crap they wine to the support stuff of that firm, in
GNU/linux they get all the tools at once and don't have such a
technical support (suse and redhat for a short time at the beginning,
ok..) to ask questions. So they come to us and thats what TAG is
for. Bit I think that most luser get along with GNU/Linux pretty well
given the fact that GNU/Linux is <em>far</em> more powerful and
customizable. With most questions they come to either us or debianhelp
for example, they wouldn't even ask those questions on win since there
they wouldn't get the fix idea to run their own webserver just-for-fun
since there it isn't that much free (as in beer) software to play with
(that sentence is rather crap, granted, but I hope you get my general
drift) -- Robos
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">
I'll disagree to the extent that there is plenty of free-as-in-beer 
or shareware available for Windows, but to a certain degree you have to be 
geeky to know where to go looking for it. Been there, showing people cool 
stuff like virtual desktops and icon managers and replacement command shells.
-- Heather</font></blockquote>

<blockquote>
Well, you really need to hear the question I was asked!  I was asked
"Why is Linux popular in the enterprise and with upper management but
not popular on home PCs?"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
"It's for geeks and they thrive in the enterprise where the power of
Linux is appreciated."  Then I went on to mention about MS licensing
practices taht forbid other OSes or changing of the boot sequesnce.  I
said THAT was why Linux isn't popular on the desktop.  I even mention BeOS
and Hitachi.
</blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
So, to make it clear: I think with a little help (about as much as you
need in the beginning with windoze) and some distro like suse or
mandrake a pretty normal user can now easily use linux and the
accompained software (as long as they can and are willing to read).
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
I agree.  And while my student/attendee, Dave Potter, did say those
things, he came off alot different than the article sounds.

Anybody know of a course in "how to answer a journalists' questions without

<blockquote><font color="#000066">What Robos had to say only works if you know what 
parts they are likely to misrepresent.  Make them repeat it back.  Squeeze 'em if 
they can't get it right.  Unfortunately the cultural gap is likely to foster
addiitonal assumptions based on whatever you say or do to try and keep
matters straight.
