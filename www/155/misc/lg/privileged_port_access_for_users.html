<p>
Folks
</p>

<p>
For some reason i want one my service should use the port &lt; 1024
</p>

<p>
It says access denied for the users other than root. Can we have any workaround for this

Britto,
</p>

<p>
Can you be more descriptive in your question? Try giving us information
on what service your referring to what distro (Red Hat, Debian,
Slackware) what version of the software your running. Did you do a
package install or build the software from source? Stuff like that is
very important for the people to know if you want help. Give as many
details as you can possibly provide. The people on this list are very
knowledgeable and can help but not if you don't help them by telling
more about what the specifics are in regards to your problem.
</p>

<p>
Best,
</p>

<p>
Right -- so configure your warez^H^H^Hservice to listen on this port then.
</p>

<p>
Nope, since you've provided absolutely no information on what the service is.

Thanks Thomas and Joey.
</p>

<p>
The Operating system what i am using is Centos 5.2
</p>

<p>
We have our own java based software which is configured to use the port &lt; 1024 for some testing.when i try to start running my  process 
</p>

<p>
I see the  java exception which says  ":: java.net.BindException: Permission denied"
</p>

<p>
As a root i could start and use without any issue
</p>

<p>
It is a common "security" feature to only allow root to use ports &lt; 1024
</p>

<p>
There are a couple of solutions. Use an internet service launcher, like 
inetd or xinetd, to listen on the port and launch your application. I think 
xinetd can launch your application to run as a non-root user. However you'd 
have to alter you appl. to use stdin and stdout files instead of handling 
the sockets directly (actually this makes creating an itnernet application 
trivial - you don't need to understand sockets <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
Alternatively make your application setuid root (see man chmod), so that 
when it is executed it starts as root, so it can listen on the priveleged 
port, then it can make a system call to stop being root and alter to a 
normal user - the C lib function is setuid.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure you could do a google code search for some example code.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Maybe. Depends on what you're doing. You could, for example, start a
server on a low port as root and then drop the privileges of the server
process - this is a common (and smart, if done right) tactic.
