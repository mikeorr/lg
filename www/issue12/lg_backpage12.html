<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Randy Appleton</a></H4>
Randy Appleton is a professor of Computer Science at Northern Michigan
University. Randy got his Ph.D. at the University of Kentucky. He has
been involved with Linux since before version 0.9. Current research
includes high performance pre-fetching file systems, with a coming port to
the 2.X version of Linux. Other interests include airplanes, especially
home-built ones.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Larry Ayers</H4>
Larry Ayers lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">John M. Fisk</H4>
John Fisk is most noteworthy as the former editor of the <I>Linux Gazette</I>.
After three years as a General Surgery resident and
Research Fellow at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center,
John decided to &quot:hang up the stethoscope&quot:, and pursue a
career in Medical Information Management. He's currently a full
time student at the Middle Tennessee State University and hopes
to complete a graduate degree in Computer Science before
entering a Medical Informatics Fellowship. In his dwindling
free time he and his wife Faith enjoy hiking and camping in
Tennessee's beautiful Great Smoky Mountains. He has been an avid Linux fan,
since his first Slackware 2.0.0 installation a year and a half
ago.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Michael J. Hammel</H4>
Michael J. Hammel,
is a transient software engineer with a background in
everything from data communications to GUI development to Interactive Cable
systems--all based in Unix. His interests outside of computers
include 5K/10K races, skiing, Thai food and gardening. He suggests if you
have any serious interest in finding out more about him, you visit his home
pages at http://www.csn.net/~mjhammel. You'll find out more
there than you really wanted to know. 

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Andy Kahn</H4>
Andy Kahn is currently a graduate student in Computer Science at
UCLA, praying to finish his Masters degree sometime in the foreseeable
near future.  His primary research area is in parallel I/O.  On
the side, Andy also does Unix System Administration at Activision,
a well-known computer games company.  He also has had previous jobs,
including system administration and programming by masquerading
as a Software Engineer.  Andy has been an on and off Linux
enthusiast since his first SLS v1.02 installation over 3 years ago.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Jesper Pedersen</a></H4>
Jesper Pedersen lives in Odense, Denmark, where he has studied computer science
at Odense University since 1990. He expects to obtain his degree in a year and
a half. He has a great job as a system manager at the
university, and also teaches computer science two hours a week. He is very 
proud of his &quot;child,&quot; The Dotfile Generator, which he wrote as part of his
job at the university. The idea for it came a year and a half ago, when he had
to learn how to configure Emacs by reading about 700 pages of the lisp manual.
It started small, but as time went by, it expanded into a huge project.
In his spare time, he does Yiu-Yitsu, listens to music, drinks beer and has fun with
his girl friend. He loves pets, and has a 200 litre aquarium and two very cute
rabbits.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Robert G. Savage</a></H4>
Robert G. "Doc" Savage received his BSE(EE) at Arizona State University in
1974 and is now a senior networking engineer working for a
telecommunications consulting firm near St. Louis. An Internet veteran
since the earliest days of the Arpanet, he has designed, engineered,
installed, administered and consulted for a wide range of UNIX, Novell and
Microsoft network systems. He enjoys listening to Garrison Keelor's radio
broadcasts, reading Tom Clancy's books, acting in community theater,
cruising in his 300ZX twin turbo, tinkering with a tower server in his
living room (the hood is always up), and relaxing at the end of the day
with his two Siamese cats and a pint of Guinness.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Manuel Soriano</a></H4>
Manual Soriano lives in El Perello, Valencia, Spain. He works for a Swiss
based company called Dapsys S. A. that provides the Information Retrieval
Imaging System called IRIS. His job calls for quite of bit of traveling. He's
been in Swizterland, France, and most recently, Prince George, Canada. 
His FEddi-HOWTO article is the English translation of his article
FEddi-COMO that appeared in the October issue.

Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. 
<img src="./gx/turkey.gif" align=right alt="">
<P> 
Major "Not Linux" projects on my plate these days are the repair of a quilt
and Thanksgiving. 
<P> 
The "Sunbonnet Sue" quilt was
made for my sister Gaynell when she about 5, and is turning into more work than
I expected. But when I am finished, it will be beautiful again and
will make a good Christmas present for her. 
<P> 
Thanksgiving feels like an even
bigger project than the quilt repair--I get to host this year, which means
I do the major part of the cooking. I will be serving traditional Southern
fare, since I was raised in Texas. I feel like I should already be cooking
to be ready on time. At any rate, I am looking forward to visiting with
family, and eating too much. :-) I am also looking forward to the long
weekend--four days off from work feels like a vacation!
<P> 
Have fun!
