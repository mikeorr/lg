<h2>General News</h2>

<h3>Feisty Fawn Becomes Ubuntu 7, Adds Server Virtualization</h3>

<p>
Canonical set free its Feisty Fawn in April. Ubuntu 7.04 desktop edition
includes a ground-breaking Windows migration assistant, excellent
wireless networking support, and improved multimedia support.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu 7.04 server edition adds support for hardware facilities that
speed up the use of virtual machines, as well as other improved hardware
support, making it an excellent choice as a Web, database, file and
print server, the fastest growing area of Linux server use. Ubuntu's
support for thin clients is boosted with advanced print and sound
support. 
</p>

<p>
On x86 systems with the Intel VT or AMD-V extensions<a id="lg_bytes.html_1_back"></a><a href="#lg_bytes.html_1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>, Kernel-based
Virtual Machine support (KVM) allows users to run multiple virtual
machines running unmodified Linux. Each virtual machine has private
virtualized hardware: a network card, disk, graphics adapter, and so on.
Ubuntu is the first Linux distribution with Para-Ops and VMI support,
which provides optimized performance under VMware.
</p>

<p>
"Our users want choice and ease-of-use, so, whether as a guest or host
operating system, Ubuntu 7.04 will support commercial virtualization
products such as VMWare, as well as open source projects including Xen
and KVM," said Jane Silber, Director of Operations, Canonical.
</p>

<p>
7.04 adds a range of new performance improvements including better
performance on multicore processors, support for the Processor Data
Area, and optimizations for 64-bit architectures.  Secure remote network
installation using a remote SSH terminal is a new admin feature. [ED:
However, some early adopters suggest installing the Ndisgtk package, if
your wi-fi card isn't recognized.]
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu 7.04 supports the Linux 2.6.20 kernel, the recent GNOME 2.18
desktop environment, and thousands of additional applications. Download
Ubuntu from <a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download">www.ubuntu.com/download</a> .
</p>

<h3>Ubuntu and Sun Offer Java/Linux Integration</h3>

<p>
As 7.04 launched, it also offered a highly integrated Java developer
stack making it easier for GNU/Linux developers to leverage the Java
platform in their applications. This stack, which comprises key
popular Java technologies such as GlassFish v1 (the open source Java
Platform, Enterprise Edition 5 implementation), Java Platform, Standard
Edition (JDK 6), Java DB 10.2 (built from Apache Derby) and NetBeans IDE
5.5 - will be available in the Multiverse component of the Ubuntu
repository on April 19. These technologies will be available for Ubuntu
users to install easily over the network with apt-get and other standard
software management tools.
</p>

<p>
"Sun and Canonical are working together to bring the full power of the
Java platform in a fully integrated and easy to install fashion to the
free and open source software communities," said Ian Murdock, founder of
Debian Linux and now a chief operating systems officer at Sun.
</p>

<p>
More information on the work involved in packaging these applications
for inclusion in Ubuntu will be presented at this year's JavaOne(SM)
Conference in San Francisco during session TS-7361, by Harpreet Singh of
Sun and Jeff Bailey of Canonical entitled "Packaging Java Platform
Applications into Ubuntu". Other related JavaOne events are Ian
Murdock's talk on "Linux vs. Solaris?" at CommunityOne and an entire new
Open Source Track that will cover Sun's Free/Open Source Java software
strategy in depth, starting with Simon Phipps' talk TS-7498, "Liberating
Java: Free and Open Opportunity for the Future."
</p>

<h3>Microsoft Indemnifies Samsung on Linux Patents</h3>

<p>
Redmond's biggest employer continues to cross license its patent
portfolio with other companies, including NEC, Fuji-Xerox, Seiko-Epson
and Nortel, as well as Novell's cross-licensing imbroglio.
</p>

<p>
The Samsung deal in April allows Samsung and its distributors to utilize
Microsoft's patents in Samsung's products and gives Microsoft access to
Samsung's Media patents. It also protects Samsung from unidentified
software inventions MS claims are in Linux.
</p>

<p>
Samsung, the first company to introduce a Blu-ray disc player, will
introduce a dual format High-Definition (HD) optical disc player in time
for the holidays that will fully support both HD-DVD and Blu-ray Disc
formats and their interactive technologies, HDi and BD-Java. There are
unspecified monetary payments for access to the respective company's IP.
Samsung and Microsoft have previously collaborated in Pocket PC and
Windows Mobile designs and other media projects. 
</p>

<p>
See:
<a href="http://samsung.com/PressCenter/PressRelease/PressRelease.asp?seq=20070419_0000339316">Samsung's press release for more details</a> .
</p>

<h3>MS Plugin for Firefox Plays WMP Files</h3>

<p>
Now available from Port 25, the Microsoft Open Source site, this is a
plug-in for Firefox 2.0 that plays media files with an embedded Windows
Media Player.  The plugin functions as an OCX control. Other Firefox
plugins are expected from Port 25, including a CardSpace security
plugin.
</p>

<p>
Commentators point out that Microsoft's new Flash-killer, the
Silverlight project, will require near universal access to a
WMP-compatible player in the browser. The plugin will keep WMP as a
dominant Internet media format.

<h3>Linux Foundation Updates LSB and Testing Tools</h3>

<p>
The Linux Foundation has updated the Linux Standard Base (LSB) and
released a new testing toolkit.  The update to LSB 3.1 introduces new
automated testing toolkits for distributions and application vendors,
linking development more closely to certification. 
</p>

<p>
"All the moving parts are coming together to give the Linux ecosystem
its first testing framework that will coordinate development of upstream
code to standards and downstream implementations," said Jim Zemlin,
executive director of the Linux Foundation. "In order for a standard to
be effective, it needs to have a powerful - and usable - testing
infrastructure. Our testing framework will deliver that functionality
and allow the Linux ecosystem to collaborate and test code while it's
being developed....."
</p>

<p>
The LSB delivers interoperability between applications and the Linux
operating system, allowing application developers to target multiple
versions of Linux with only one software package. This allows Linux to
compete effectively against proprietary, monolithic platforms. The LSB
has marshaled the various Linux distribution vendors to certify to its
standards, including Red Hat, Novell, Debian, Ubuntu, Xandros, Mandriva
and more. 
</p>

<p>
Even though Linux is developed in a highly decentralized manner, Linux
must provide the same long-term compatibility guarantees and
comprehensive compatibility testing as proprietary platforms such as
Microsoft Windows. The LSB Test Framework enables interoperability for
applications targeted at LSB 3.0 and higher and will provide backward
compatibility so that these applications will continue to run correctly
on distributions compatible with future versions of the LSB.
</p>

<p>
The Linux Foundation initiated a multi-million dollar project to build
the first open source testing framework that will link upstream projects
to the LSB and downstream providers. The first result of that testing
partnership is available now: the LSB Distribution Testkit .
</p>

<p>
The LSB DTK introduces a Web-based front end testing process that
represents the first results of the Linux Foundation's partnership with
the Russian Academy of Sciences. ISV testing tools are also available
from <a href="http://developer.linux-foundation.org">http://developer.linux-foundation.org</a>; these include the LSB Application
Testkit, a lightweight download that contains just the LSB validation
tools needed for ISVs to check if their application is LSB compliant. 
</p>

<p>
The Linux Foundation urges distro and package developers, as well as
interested users, to use the LSB DTK. As an open source project, the
testing framework needs users to get involved, provide feedback and
patches for continued enhancement.  LSB 3.1 is available at
<a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/LSB">http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/LSB</a> .  The new testing kits can be
found at <a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Downloads">http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Downloads</a> .
</p>

<h2>Distros</h2>

<p>
The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is: 2.6.20.7
[For updates, see <a href="http://www.kernel.org">www.kernel.org]</a> .   
</p>

<h3>Debian 4.0 now available</h3>

<p>
The Debian Project is pleased to announce the official release of Debian
GNU/Linux version 4.0, codenamed "etch", after 21 months of constant
development. Debian GNU/Linux is a free operating system that supports
a total of eleven processor architectures and includes the KDE, GNOME
and Xfce desktop environments. It also features cryptographic software
and compatibility with the FHS v2.3 and software developed for version
3.1 of the LSB.
</p>

<p>
Using a now fully integrated installation process, Debian GNU/Linux 4.0
comes with out-of-the-box support for encrypted partitions. This release
introduces a newly developed graphical frontend to the installation
system supporting scripts using composed characters and complex
languages; the installation system for Debian GNU/Linux has now been
translated to 58 languages.
</p>

<p>
Also beginning with Debian GNU/Linux 4.0, the package management system
has been improved regarding security and efficiency. Secure APT allows
the verification of the integrity of packages downloaded from a mirror.
Updated package indices won't be downloaded in their entirety, but
instead patched with smaller files containing only differences from
earlier versions.
</p>

<p>
Debian GNU/Linux can be downloaded right now via bittorrent (the
recommended way), jigdo or HTTP; see Debian GNU/Linux on CDs or Debian's
<a href="http://debian.org">site</a> for further
information. It will soon be available on DVD and CD-ROM from numerous
vendors, too.
</p>

<h3>Announcing Fedora 7 Test 3</h3>

<p>
Fedora 7 Test 3 has been released featuring both GNOME and KDE based
installable live CDs, and a spin named "Prime" that combines desktop,
workstation, and server functionality. 
</p>

<p>
The merge of Fedora Core and Fedora Extras repositories and
infrastructure is in progress. The major components included in this
release are GNOME 2.18, KDE 3.5.6 and a 2.6.21rc5 based Linux kernel.
</p>

<h3>Mandriva "2007 Spring"</h3>

<p>
Mandriva has announced the release of Mandriva Linux 2007.1, marketed as
"2007 Spring".
</p>

<p>
Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring integrates the latest innovations in the
fields of office suite applications, Internet, multimedia and
virtualization technologies. Mandriva Linux 2007 Spring also includes
special new features such as WengoPhone, Google Picasa and Google Earth.
</p>  

<h2>Products</h2>

<h3>Public Beta of Launchpad 1.0</h3>

<p>
In April, Launchpad.net started public beta testing of Launchpad 1.0, a
free Web-based collaboration service that aides communication between
different software projects.
</p>

<p>
Collaboration has traditionally been difficult across communities that
use different tools to exchange information. Launchpad's new approach
links data from a variety of project-specific sources in different
communities and presents it in a unified interface, bringing those
communities closer together to solve common problems such as bugs in
shared code. This public beta includes a redesigned interface that
allows projects to brand their presence in the system and highlights the
current activity of project members to keep track of the latest changes.
</p>

<p>
The Ubuntu Linux distribution uses Launchpad to keep track of
conversations across hundreds of free software communities. The service
makes it possible for the Ubuntu team to coordinate work on tens of
thousands of bug reports, many of which involve third-party development
communities, and hundreds of feature proposals for each release.
</p>

<p>
Around 2,700 projects have been registered, and while many of those do
not use Launchpad as their primary hosting infrastructure, their
registration in Launchpad facilitates collaboration between other
projects who depend on their code.
</p>

<p>
Launchpad helps projects collaborate via team management, bug tracking,
code hosting and language tranlation facilitities.  As an example,
Launchpad offers automatic translation suggestions - from a library of
750,000 translated strings - and a community of 19,000 registered
translators to radically cut the time required to localise a project
into many languages.  Launchpad also uses the Bazaar revision control
system, which can link to projects using CVS or Subversion, and can
allow new participants in a community to have full revision control of
their own submissions using Bazaar before they have been given commit
access to a project's central CVS or SVN repository.
</p>

virtual server performs the same as the physical server.
</p>

<p>
Last year, SWsoft grew revenues from its Virtuozzo and Parallels
virtualization product lines by a remarkable 734 percent. An IDC
industry analyst report published last September cited SWsoft as growing
fastest among all vendors in the hot overall market for virtualization
technology.
</p>

<p>
SWsoft Virtuozzo dynamically partitions a single Windows or Linux
operating system instance into scalable virtual environments with up to
hundreds of virtual environments per physical server.  For more

<h3>Intel announces Penryn and Tolapai plans</h3>

<p>
At the Intel Developer Forum in Beijing in April, Intel executives
detailed over 20 new products and technology innovations aimed at making
computers and consumer electronics devices much more responsive and
secure.
</p>

<p>
Pat Gelsinger, senior vice present and general manager of the Digital
Enterprise Group, provided performance indicators for Intel's upcoming
Penryn family of processors. For desktop PCs, he said to expect
increases of about 15 percent for imaging-related applications; 25
percent for 3-D rendering; more than 40 percent for gaming; and more
than 40 percent faster video encoding with Intel SSE4 optimized video
encoders.
</p>

<p>
Gelsinger unveiled "Tolapai" plans, the first in what will be a family
of enterprise-class "system-on-chip" (SoC) products that integrate
several key system components into a single Intel architecture-based
processor. The 2008 Tolapai product is expected to reduce the chip sizes
by up to 45 percent, and power consumption by approximately 20 percent
compared to a standard four-chip design.
</p>

<p>
Gelsinger also outlined product plans, including Intel's high-end
multi-processor servers (codenamed "Caneland"). The quad- and dual-core
Intel Xeon processor 7300 series will arrive in 3Q07 in 80- and 50-watt
versions for blades. The new servers will complete the company's
transition to its Core microarchitecture for Xeon processors. Sun
Microsystems demonstrated its Solaris operating system running on an
Intel Xeon(R) 5100 series processor based system using Intel Dynamic
Power technology, a new capability focused on reducing the power
required for a memory subsystem.
</p>

<p>
For PC security and manageability benefits, Intel will introduce the
next-generation Intel vPro processor technology, codenamed "Weybridge,"
in the second half of the year and using the new Intel 3 Series Chipset
family, formerly codenamed "Bear Lake."
</p>

<h2>Magical Realism</h2>

<h3>Gravity Probe B Proves General Relativity Still Valid</h3>

<p>
The GP-B satellite was launched in April 2004 and collected a year's
worth of data to determine if predictions of Albert Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity are correct.  The ultra-sensitive gyroscopes
attempted to detect a tiny amount of precession, due to the effect the
Earth would have on local space-time around it.  So far, the data
analysis confirms that effect and General Relativity - at least near
Earth.
</p>

<p>
The experiment had to detect variances of less than 0.002 degrees.  Read
the full story at <a

<p> <a id="lg_bytes.html_1"></a><a href="#lg_bytes.html_1_back"><strong>[1]</strong></a> <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>: 
You can verify this CPU capability by booting Linux on the candidate
processor, using (e.g.) a Knoppix or other live CD and examining the CPU 
flags section of /proc/cpuinfo.  The minimal Linux kernel version for
this purpose is 2.6.15 on Intel or 2.6.15 on AMD.  Look for flag "vmx" 
on Intel CPUs, indicating presence of the Intel VT extensions.  Look for
flag "svm" on AMD CPUs, indicating presence of the AMD SVM (aka "AMD-V")
extensions.
