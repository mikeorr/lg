<CENTER><H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER>
<P>In this era of WYSIWYG editors and word processors it is remarkable that 
successors to the ancient (in computer chronology) vi editor are still 
under active development. Considering the seeming handicaps vi-style editors 
are burdened with, such as a lack of icons, pulldown menus, and graphical
glitz
in general, there must be some basic, behind-the-scenes functionality
involved 
which keeps these editors in use.<P>  A typical initial reaction to vi is 
confusion and repugnance.  There are no visual clues as to what to do in
order 
to even enter text;  my first experience with vi was mainly an exercise in 
figuring out how to exit the thing.  But once you manage to learn about a
dozen
or so basic keystrokes and begin to keep in mind which mode you're in, text 
manipulation really accelerates.<P> A few years ago Paul Fox began 
to tinker with the source code of the Microemacs editor.  He ended up with an

editor which had the basic vi command set, but with a layer of emacs-like 
control-key commands which added more functions to vi.   <U>V</U><U>I</U> 
<U>L</U>ike <U>E</U>macs.<P>The editor has been through quite a lengthy 
development cycle with many programmers joining in.  It's been ported to DOS,

Windows, OS/2, and of course all varieties of unix.  Excellent x-window
support
is now a compilation option.

<P><H3><CENTER>Installation</CENTER></H3>
<P>Compiling and installing vile and/or xvile is painless.  Makefiles are 
included for all the above-mentioned operating systems, and a well-done 
configure script tailors the makefile to your system.  Just type 
"./configure" for standard vile, or "./configure --with-screen=x11", then 
"./make", followed by the usual "./make.install" and "./make.man".
<P><CENTER><H3>Features</H3></CENTER> 
<P>Vile is not strictly speaking a clone of vi, but as Paul Fox puts it the 
editor has a "finger feel" like vi's.  Unlike vi, multiple windows and
buffers 
are implemented, as well as an easy-to-use keyboard-remapping and macro 
facility.  As in emacs, you can browse through directory listings and 
call up files to be edited.  This feature is not as option-rich as emacs' 
dired, but I don't require of an editor that it double as a full-featured 
file-manager.<P>"Infinite undo" is a really handy feature; you can step your 
way back through changes you've made as far as you want.<P>Various
programmer's
modes are available, as well as a "next error" command.  Keyword highlighting

is still under development in the form of a loadable module.<P> All of vi's 
good features have been retained, such as searching with the / and ? keys,
and 
command repeating with a ".".<P>The X-windows support is very complete. 
Xvile 
is configurable through entries in your .Xdefaults or .Xresources file,
giving 
the user control of fonts, screen colors, and the scrollbar.<P>A very
complete 
help file is available via a keystroke within the editor, which is a big help

for a new vi user.<P>Before I began using xvile, I would use gnu emacs for 
large editing tasks and something smaller like elvis or xedit for minor 
editing.  Emacs takes so long to load that it's not practical to be
constantly 
starting and quitting it, and I would rather not have it loaded all of the 
time.  It's a massive beast of an editor!  The vile editors are a happy 
medium between the two; xvile takes less than a second to start up on my 486,

and vile appears practically instantly. <P>I still use emacs when I have a
lot 
of cutting and pasting to do, and would like to be able to see the contents
of 
the various cut-buffers.  In vile you have plenty of buffers available but 
they're invisible, which makes them difficult to keep track of after several 
have been accumulated.<P>One feature which rapidly has become indispensable
to 
me, and should be valuable for anyone who spends much time in
DOS/Windows/OS/2,
is a specific mode for reading non-unix text files, with those annoying extra

^M's at the end of each line.  In this mode vile automatically strips off the

superfluous ^M characters, then restores them when you quit the file.  Since 
you can specify any .vilerc configuration file on the command line (or, as I 
do, in a vile icon's config file), vile can be started up in this dos-mode
and 
then you can edit files from a DOS or OS/2 partition to your heart's content.
<P>I didn't include a screenshot with this article.  Regular vile looks just 
like vi (with the addition of a configurable status-line at the bottom) and 
xvile looks like any other x-window, depending on what window-manager you
use. 
<P><CENTER><H3>Availability</H3></CENTER>
<P>The most recent version (as of this writing, 5.6) is available via
anonymous
ftp from<A HREF="ftp://id.wing.net/pub/pgf/vile">Paul Fox's ftp site.</A> 
The 
source code is there, as well as precompiled versions for DOS and OS/2.
<P><CENTER><H3>Conclusion</H3></CENTER><P>I hope I've convinced at least a
few 
of you to give vile a try. If you do, try out the sample .Xresource
foreground 
and background colors listed in the help-file.  The first time I did this, I 
looked at the resultant text and thought, "Where have I seen this before?" 
Then it dawned on me that the colors used were a pretty accurate recreation
of 
an old-style blackboard with chalk-colored text.
