	>Greetings from Jim Dennis</H3>
<!-- begin greeting -->
<p>
	I have some exciting news.

</p><p>
	I'm now working for Linuxcare  (<a href="http://www.linuxcare.com"
	>http://www.linuxcare.com</a>) --- the Linux support company.

</p><p>
	What does this mean for Linux Gazette readers of &quot;The 
	Answer Guy?&quot;  I think it means some very good things.

</p><p>
	Of course you might be concerned.  Does this mean that
	I'll be more "corporate?"  Will Linuxcare come to 
	own &quot;The Answer Guy&quot; column?  Will I answer all the 
	good questions with:  "Hey, pay for that answer from 
	..."

</p><p>
	I don't think so!  I've been running a quiet little 
	sole proprietorship consulting service for the entire 
	time that I've been writing for LG.  My consulting 
	service specialized in support and training of Linux
	sysadmins.  I've generally avoided "selling" my services
	through this column --- and I won't start now.

</p><p>
	Linuxcare has no intention of exerting any editorial
	control over, and has no connection to the Linux Gazette
	&quot;Answer Guy.&quot;  I might put in a disclaimer to that effect
	in future issues.  
	
</p><p>
	However, the "good things" in this are:

</p><blockquote>
		I can focus on technical issues rather than 
		worrying about billing and sales of my consulting
		services.  (Avoiding those is what kept 
		Starshine Technical Services "small" and "quiet").

</blockquote><blockquote>
		Fellow techs at Linuxcare and the systems lab that
		we'll be setting up will allow me to learn all the
		latest and coolest stuff.  My home network is 
		pretty big, for a *home* network (four servers
		five desktop systems, and four laptops --- all on
		two or three ethernet segments (depending one
		what I'm doing at any given time).  However, 
		Linuxcare will be able to do *much* more.
	
</blockquote><blockquote>
		In the past I've "shooed off" some classes of
		questions --- particularly regarding X Windows
		configuration and similar items.  I'm a self-admitted
		"curses curmudgeon" and prefer to stay out of X when
		I can.  Surrounded by younger techs, many of whom are
		more enamored of the modern GUIs --- I'll soak up 
		quite a bit of knowlege on these topics by osmosis.

</blockquote><p>
	For those times when I'm actually on the phones --- I'll
	probably get quite a lot of LG done.  I spent years in 
	technical support at places like Quarterdeck and Symantec's
	Peter Norton Group.  I can do phone support while reading 
	netnews, and writing e-mail.

</p><p>
	So, for my loyal fans (I know there are a few of you --
	I met one on the Caltrain the other day; "Hi, John"), 
	Don't worry.  Be happy.  Another Linux hobbyist can do what
	he loves and support himself doing it.

</p><p>
	(BTW:  Linuxcare is hiring.  If you are in the SF Bay Area
	and have a couple years of extensive and technical Linux
	expertise --- check out their web site).

</p><p>
	What does this mean for my other projects?

</p><p>
	I'll be giving my tutorial on "Linux Security for 
	System Administrators" at LinuxWorld Expo by the time you
	read this (9:00am Monday, March 1st).  If that is successful
	I may be giving similar (and updated) talks at future Linux
	events.  (LinuxWorld has already inquired about my availability
	for their next show).  For any of you that are going to 
	LinuxWorld Expo in San Jose, CA --- drop by Linuxcare's
	booth and meet me.

</p><p>
	I'm still working on my book (&quot;Linux Systems Administration&quot; 
	--- though the work is going a bit slower than I, my publishers 
	and my co-author would like.  The goods news there is that my
	co-author, M, is really taking charge of the scheduling
	and development of the manuscript.  Also the couple of hours
	a day that I spend on the train with my laptop (from Campbell 
	up into SF city and back) will help keep me focused on this
	and stop me from drifting e-mail, netnews, and slashdot as
	I'm wont to do from home.

</p><p>
	I'm still teaching one class (weekly on Saturdays)
	at Mission College (Unix Shell Programming).  I hope to
	continue doing that for the foreseeable future as well.
	My students were worried for the first couple of classes
	(as I was adjusting the level of discussion to their 
	background).  However, they seem to be catching on at this
	point and we have several more weeks to show them all the
	really cool things you can do with a Unix/Linux shell.
	(Yes, we've told them all about getting copies of Linux and/or
	FreeBSD to play with at home and at their offices.  The 
	school lab current runs on Sun Solaris systems --- though
	Linux is being installed in some of the college's new labs.
	
</p><p>
	I'm really surprised at how busy I've gotten this year.  I 
	was supposed to just work on the book and let Heather support
	me (mostly).  (Incidentally, Heather has resigned from her
	full-time position and may be interested in quality, Bay Area
	offers in the near future).

</p><p>
	So, enough of all this "chaos manor" stuff.  Let's go
	on to this month's selection of technical questions...
</p>
