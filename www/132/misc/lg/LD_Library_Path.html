Hi, Himanshu
</p>

<p>
I'm not James, but I might be able to answer your question.
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; Plz tell me what LD_Library_path does?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
LD_Library_path doesn't do anything. Primarily because what you are looking 
for isn't called "LD_Library_path". Instead, you want LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</p>

<p>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is the name of an environment variable that you can set before 
running a program. If your program is not a "setuid" or "setgid" program, the 
Linux program loader will first look in the directories named by the 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable for any shared object libraries that the 
program needs. If it finds the needed library there, it uses it. Otherwise, 
it continues to search in all the "regular" places until it either finds the 
library or it gives up.
</p>

<p>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is commonly used to override the shared object search paths, 
so that you can give the program a replacement for one of the standard 
libraries, or to give the program a library that hasn't otherwise been 
installed in one of the standard places yet.
</p>

<p>
The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable contains a colon-separated list of 
directories, just like PATH does.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps

nothing.

<p>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH on the other hand is telling the linker [LD] which path
[PATH] it should look for libraries [LIBRARY]. Terribly difficult to guess....

Himanshu --

<p>
As a Frequently Asked Question, this is covered in my knowledgebase, so
I definitely can answer it even though my name isn't "James".
</p>

<p>
(See:  "LD_LIBRARY_PATH" on <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Admin">http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Admin</a> for full
details.)
</p>

<p>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a shell environment variable that allows you to
specify where dynamic libraries can be found, in preference to any
runtime or default system linker path.
</p>

<p>
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is a bad kludge, because the risk of security problems
or unintended side effects (e.g., on other programs) is much too large.
A much better solution is to either run the program in question using a
wrapper script that defines the desired LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
<em>just</em> for that one program, or -- better -- just recompile it using 
LDFLAGS defined appropriately in your configure script, rather than
trying to fix library paths at runtime.  
</p>

<p>
If using a wrapper script, be aware that called programs will inherit
the parent process's environment, and thus the LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting.
</p>

&gt; culd u tel me in ur words wat exactly is the role of "AWK" in unix
</pre>
</p>

<p>
AWK is the initials of three of the early developers in the Unix environment. 
The A stands for Aho (A. V.), the W for Weinberger (P.J), and the K for 
Kernighan (B. W). At one point, these three developers cooperated and built a 
pattern scanning and processing language that they named AWK (after 
themselves). This language (developed sometime before Sept. 1978) became a 
standard tool for parsing and processing plain-text data. While mostly 
supplanted by more capable (and much more complex) text processing languages 
like Perl and Python, AWK remains one of the basic tools for text parsing 
available in Unix.
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; ...and wat is the name of filesystem which supports linux/unix...?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
/Which/ filesystem are you interested in? For Unix, there is/were several 
filesystems, including the original Unix filesystem and the Berkeley Fast 
Filesystem. There are others, mostly propriatary, that I can't name.
</p>

<p>
On the Linux side, there are ext (obsolete), ext2 and ext3. There's jfs, afs, 
reiserfs, xfs, minix, adfs, affs, coda, coherent, cramfs, efs, hfs, hpfs, 
iso9660, msdos, ncpfs, nfs, ntfs, qnx4, ramfs, romfs, smbfs, sysv, tmpfs, 
udf, ufs, umsdos, vfat, xenix, xiafs, along with some pseudo-filesystems like 
proc, tmpfs and usbfs. Which one are you interested in?

<p>
For a while, Debian cheated and used Perl's "a2p" ("AWK to Perl"
translator) instead of the real thing. Worse yet, they replaced that
wonderful, "complete programming manual for AWK" man page with a tiny
stub that essentially said "Read the Perl docs." As much as I like Perl,
I was Quite Peeved: AWK was a useful utility, that man page was really
well-written, and I just hated to see it go - I felt that new users
would be losing something important, since I consider AWK a good
stepping stone for those who want to learn the basics of programming.
However, a little current research says:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
ben at Fenrir:~$ readlink -f `which awk`
/usr/bin/mawk
</pre>
 - and the manpage looks like it's back to normal. Better yet, "apt-cache
search awk$" tells me that GAWK is available as well (in fact, I just
went ahead and installed it while typing this), so all is well in that
part of the world.

<p>
I assume you realise that the two questions you've asked aren't
related?  Awk, is simply a general purpose programming
language.  Nothing more.  It doesn't have a "role" in that it has some
default use or predefined purpose.  It's very useful for text-based
processing -- especially columnar data.
</p>

<p>
As to your second question, the usual filesystem you'll find on
linux-based systems is ext2/3 (ext3 is simply ext2 plus a journal).
Other variants of filesystem include: ReiserFS, MinuxFS, Ext, JFS, XFS,
etc.
</p>

<p>
If you provide us with more information, we might be abe to help you
further.
