[laugh] We got to see "The Phantom of the Opera" when we were in NYC a
while ago; a wonderful production. You'd do well; at least my image of
you slinking off into the shadows is just perfect for the role.

Oh yeah - that reminds me. The Travelling Okopniks are going to be in
L.A. for a few days starting on the 14th; then, we'll head up to
Sacramento on the 18th and muck about there until the 22nd - and might
try to slide in an evening in the Bay Area before flying out early the
next morning. Any of you folks that happen to be along the route and
have some time to hang out (and would like to meet The Cutest
Baby in the World) are invited to contact us; we'd be glad to see you in
the flesh.

If they're going to strip-search <em>all</em> of us, then you should carefully
consider exactly when to feed The Michael... and then fill him up till
