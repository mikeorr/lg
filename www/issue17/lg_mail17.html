<P> 
The last couple of months have been rather light on articles. It's been
helpful to have the new chapters for <I>Linux Installation and Getting Starting</I>
to include. So all you budding authors and Linux users out there,
send me your stuff. Don't depend on our regular authors to fill the gap. We
want to hear about all the neat tips and tricks you've found, as well as
all the neat applications your are writing or working with. --Editor

Subject: <b>Searching for Information On Newsgroups</b><br>
From: Roman, <a href="mailto:Roman@pussycat.ping.de">Roman@pussycat.ping.de</a><br>

<p>Hi folks!

<p>I'm installing a very small news- and email system at my local
university (peolpe there are studying arts, so there's no one to help me
with this). I set up one computer with Linux 2.0.29 which is permanently
connected to the 'internet' via ethernet. Then I want to connect a
second PC which is installed in the hallway via nullmodem-cable for all
the students to write and receive eMail. But the problem now is, that
the provider (another part of the university) doesn't give us access to
the newsgroups, so I want to set up at least some local newsgroups on
this Linux-station.

<p>But I just can't seem to find any documentation explaining how to set up
local newsgroups. smtpd and nntpd are running, but the manpages won't
tell anything about how to set up ng's (forgive me if I'm just too blind
or stupid to find the obvious source of information).

<p>So I don't want to bother you explaining me how to accomplish this task,
but perhaps someone can at least tell me where to find the desired
information.

<p>Best regards,
Roman.

Subject: <b>VGA_16 Server</b><br>
From:  Javier Viscain

<p>	Congratulations for the aim and contents of the Gazette.
	Here is an issue I've never seen addressed: the VGA_16
server maintains two monitors (the second monochrome with an
Hercules card) but what only works is the mouse movement, which
moves out of left and right to the other monitor, and console
switching. No window on the monochrome gets focus. Things that
moreless appear on the monochrome but don't work:
<ul>

<li>	Xeyes: both eyes are displayed, but the inner dots
appear as moving diagonal lines out of the eyes.
<li>	Xterm: an useless box appears.
	Xterm with exec: say "xterm -display xxx:0.1 -exec top &"
appears as an xterm box with the letters from "top" without any
order, in and out from the xterm box.
<li>	Xload: the "load" and letters appear out of the box.
</ul>

<p>	I think that the hardware absolute addressing is the
normal VGA one (0A0000 to 0AFFFF) and 64K for the Hercules
(0B0000 to 0BFFFF), which is correct.
	In adition, this server and the mono server are very
buggy when with only the Hercules.
<p>	Any easy solution, or is it that this configuration has not
been debugged?

<p>
TIA, Javier Vizcaino, Madrid, Spain.

Subject: <b>Initilation Files</b><br>
From Karl Easterly <a
href="mailto:bigtexan@mindspring.com">bigtexan@mindspring.com</a><br>

As an article Idea, I think an overview of the major boot scripts would =
be helpful.  The overview could include an objective view of the =
locations, functions, and nifty "tips and tricks" or such.  Also, links =
to how-toos for each script would future simplify the learning curve for =
new users.

<p>Another idea would be to do a chronological installations and =
customization series of articles.  Granted, hardware diversity might be =
a problem and could possibly be subverted by starting the series as =
though  a working installation of Linux has already been installed.  It =
would proceed as a rough idea like this.
<ol>
<li>Booting customization and kernel rebuilding.
<li>Xwin customization, to include the type of activities one =
would do in Win95 desktop setup.
<li>Getting dialup connectivity to work.
<li>Getting network connectivity to work.
</ol>
<p>These are just stabs at a scheme, the actual order would have to be =
hammered out before the series started, but in general, would be helpful =
to have a step by step issue oriented series of articles concerning the =
setup and customization of any linux installation.

Subject: <b>Ideas for Beginners</b><br>
From: stephen jarvis <a href="mailto:106363.2642@compuserve.com">106363.2642@compuserve.com</a>


<p>Hello 
<p>        I am 'the' absolute beginner.I have had a copy of Linux Slackware
and a copy of "Linux configuration and installation " by P Volkerding et al
for about two weeks.Prior to this I had dabbled at dos and wondered(?) at
windows.But when I heard about Linux in a magazine it occured to me that it
might be fun to have a go.And indeed it has been. 
<p>        The only problem I have had is with regard to the man pages. In
general they are technical to a degree that while appropriate for those who
can follow the argument from end to end,are pretty debilitating for the
newbie like me.Indeed I don't always get to the end.
<p>        Perseverence will no doubt pay off and I have expanded my
collection of books already,to take advantage of the possibility of
learning something about programming on Linux.But then I have always had
the kind of curiousity that,while not  enough to kill the cat,is enough to
keep me in the book shop.The point I think is that the man pages themselves
are a bit of a barrier to the wider useage of Linux.
<p>        No doubt others would say the detail and technical clout of this
source of information is needed for those who want to make serious use of
Linux.But not everyone who wants to escape from the soporific influence of
Microsoft is that demanding or that knowledgeable.I think someone needs to
pitch things at the introductory level.In the realms of 'this will get it
going'and 'try this out'.Merely a more chatty approach would help remove
the shiney armour of incomprehensibilty some pages deploy.
<p>        If this sounds a little unfair to the many people who have compiled
,man pages it is most definitley not meant to be.There is a need for
accurate and complete information especially as Linux is a cooperative
venture and everyone needs to have a common root of information.The
question is how can the benefits of Linux be made widely known to people
outside the existing network.What will grab their attention and take the
gleam off Windows 95?Something more open to a wider audience perhaps.
<p>        This does not have to be completely bland and overly simple just in
the range of every day usage.An approach that does not assume that everyone
reading knows the meaning of every term on the page.People need an
introduction to the language of Linux in the way that you might learn
French or English.Start with very basic things and build up in stages.Don't
launch straight into 'How To Compile Your Kernal '.Ok thats important ,but
I am sure most people still think a kernal is what you find inside a nut.I
hope you are getting the general idea.
<p>        What us new people need is probably a collection of basic texts
each about the length of a several page magazine article.Hopefully they
would cover the things that a hardend Linux user would be embarrassed to
ask about.'The kernal for beginners'.'Great now I can ask what it really
is'.If this undertaking was started then I am sure that the end product of
a few months could be published as a small book.Maybe you could publish
it.I think there is a potential market.Many magazines recently covered the
subject of Linux.That's how I got the bug.
<p>        Now it's true there are books already that cover Linux but there
are not many on line man pages or magazine articles that give the beginner
the feeling that they can actually get their system up and running
easily.So if you really want  to publish articles for absolute beginners
bear in mind the kind of language that is used. 
     
<p> Regards       
 Steve Jarvis

<p>ps.. here's some ideas   ' What is the kernal','The basic commands to get
around bash','What are disk partitions and why bother',' To Umsdos or not.
That's the question','Midnight Commander-an introduction','This is the
easiest editor  anybody ever used(insert your choice)','A glossary  of
general terms you'll find on a man page','These books are a good
read(assorted titles)'.'How to get around an info text  with less than 20
pages of instructions','Why the idea of a free and open o/s matters','X is
not a horror film'.

<p>Maybe these are a bit daft but they'd get my attention.They are the sort of
things I'd like to know about.

From: Dani Fricker <a href="mailto:101550.3160@CompuServe.COM">101550.3160@CompuServe.COM</a>

<p>first i wanna say thanx for the lj! great work and fun not even for linuxers!
i need your help. for some reasons i have to identify a user on my webserver by
his/her
ip-address. fact is that users logon comes from different physical machines.
that means
that i have to assign something like a virtual ip-address to a users log name.
something 
like a reversal masquerading.
my ip-gateway connects my inner lan over two token ring network cards 
(sorry, not my idea!) with the internet (lan <-> tr0 <-> tr1 <-> internet). the 
masquerading forward roule of ipfwadm gives me the possibility to indicate a
source and 
a destination address. 
do you see a possibility for an 'address assignment' between the two interfaces?
if you
do please let me know.

Subject:<b>HELP with Man Pages</b>
From: "Mauricio Naranjo N." <a href="mailto:davasgut@col2.telecom.com.co">davasgut@col2.telecom.com.co</a><br>

<p>Well, I have installed the linux toolkit / october 1996 and I have not
been able to install the man pages for commonly used commands like cat,
ls, and so on; instead I have installed the man pages for packages like,
fvwm, midnight commander, ....
<p>	So, I installed man2.tgz, man3.tgz, manpgs.tgz, but I still have not
been able to get installed the whole support for man;
	Can you tell me please, what's the matter????

		Any kind of help would be great appreciated, and excuses for ignorance
but I am new at this OS (finally I found a true one)

From: Jose, <a href="mailto:notDefined@novagate.com">notDefined@novagate.com</a><br>

<p>Hi,
Maybe you can help me with this. (I hope)
I switched motherboards, from a zeos pentium 90 that used a serial mouse to a
asus p/i-p55tvp4 motherboard that uses a port mouse. 
And now I can't get x-windows to run.
Any ideas?

Subject: <b>Linux</b><br>
From: Tred Riggs <a href="mailto:tred@oak.sfasu.edu">tred@oak.sfasu.edu</a>

<p>I am a college student attending Stephen F. Austin State University.  I
work in a Geographic Information Systems Laboratory (GIS) and we have
been just using AIX machines.  Howerver we do have a full blown linux pc
and it is great.  {Since then I stripped DOS off my PC and made me a
full blown linux box, which works wonderful.  We were considering to
upgrade to all linux PC's in out lab because they were cheaper and
faster than the AIX boxes, but we ran into a problem.  The Software we
need to run to make our GIS maps is not supported by ESRI, so we gave
them a call.  This is what they told us:

<p>"Linux will not be a supported platform.  They told me that product
ports are user driven and there is not enough users wanting this OS."

<p>I could not figure out how they could even say this when all you have to
do is get on the web and see millions of people using linux. So here is
what I want to happen.  I need linux users to E-mail ESRI at
buspartners@esri.com and tell them that you use linux and that there are
many more people using linux too.  ESRI needs to get there head out of
Microsofts world and see what is going on in the real world.

<p>Thanks for your time Linux Gazette,

Subject:<b>http://linuxgazette.net/index.html</b><br>
From: Duncan Simpson <a href="mailto:dps@duncan.telstar.net">dps@duncan.telstar.net</a><br>


<p>Given Micro$oft's tag line of "Yet another Web server powered by NT" maybe we should
collect a list of people doing this sort of stuff on Linux. I can add 3 items myself

<a href="http://mail.telstar.net">http://mail.telstar.net</a> is powered by Linux
The telstar mail service described there is also powered by the same linux box
Astra has switch from NT to Linux for its radius server. (NT was just too expensive
and no better than Linux (Un*x)---the price diffrernece was *1000s* of pounds, each
about 1.5 $ US).

Both astra (and telstar.net) DNS servers are linux.

<p>If the stats show that Linux is more popular for comercial web servers than NT, this would
be something nice to be able to point out...

<p>Duncan (-:
<p>P.S. Any bets when Truetype fonts can be used for proper typesetiing. At present they
lack litagures (fl and various other items that are tradionally rendered as single
characters)?
<p>P.P.S. The use of the present tense (switch) is apt because the change is happening
now. (Despite a bug that is now not being exercised due to an attempt to eradicate it
mail.telstar.net is more reliable than any of various NT machines at handling mail).

From: James Stansell <a href="mailto:james.stansell@wcom.com">james.stansell@wcom.com</a><br>

<p>The ifconfig command works, and may be the most authoritative on the
subject (except I believe the PPP log also contains your current IP),
but the ifconfig command returns a ton more information than I want.

<p>So I ask my machine at work who I am:

<pre>who am i

</pre>
<p>I've inserted your example IP address where my actual address
showed up.  If the DNS at work does happen to know a name for my
address, then it shows up instead of the IP.

  Sorry the URL didn't work for you; I recently got an email

version and he included a URL for a new GV home-page:

<a href="http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/">http://wwwthep.physik.uni-mainz.de/~plass/gv/</a>


<p>  The Debian version is in the /text section of the /i386 binary

<p>Good luck!
