<h1>A Shell Named Westley</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/ford.html">Theresa L Ford</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>I think of the different shells as clones of little worker guys.
<i>sh</i> drinks
beer, sports a nice beer belly, and is quite content to do what you ask him to.
<i>bash</i> drinks beer AND smokes cigars. <i>ksh</i> is an outdoor barbeque type who likes
food and sports with whatever drink is handy. <i>csh</i> only drinks dry martinis and
has a dark sense of humor. Each of these worker types speaks a slightly
different dialect and gets confused if you offer him beer when he distinctly
requires a dry martini. Each has his own unique DNA (sometimes referred to as
initialization scripts).

<p>You can change which shell worker type you want to order around on a routine
basis using a magic wand etched with the word 'chsh' to point at the one you
want to come running first. This doesn't limit you, though, because you can
always clone a new one of any type by saying his name. The conscription of new
workers can even be done inside files using a #! whip.

<p>Each worker does his job at a minimum wage of $0, but may require some
training and additional $'s, maybe 1-9, and will tell you how much you gave as
a simple $#. If you overpay him, you might have to shift his wages a little.
Sometimes, the worker can be paid in special loot like gems, $* (equivalent to
all given), or $@ (also equivalent to all given but requires that the worker
spend proceeds only after careful consideration of all estimate quotes).

<p>Additionally, each worker operates under specific user permissions and may
have problems if you tell him to do something he isn't allowed to do. He has a
distinct personality and only sometimes likes to interact with you; in fact,
these workers can hide from you in the background (sly buggers, these shells!)
or let you watch them operate.

<p>Each worker can request another worker clone (of any installed type), called
its child, through a process named 'spawning'. He can learn a specialized
vocabulary (if you define each new word as a variable) and is even capable of
sharing his vocabulary with his children, but only if you specifically tell him
to! Though he'll forget some of his words if you unsettle him.

<p>If you give him enough $$, he'll tell you who he is. If he's hiding, you
have to shout ($!) to get his attention so he'll tell you who he is. You can
ask him a question ($?) and he will tell you how he did at his task. In all, I
think I shall name all my shell worker clones "Westley", call them "Farm Boy",
and expect them to respond, "As you wish..."
