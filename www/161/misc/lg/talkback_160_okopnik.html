I just realized that I forgot one either minor or major thing in this
article, depending on how you look at it: how to actually auto-run
'idesk' under IceWM.
</p>

<p>
Since Ubuntu does its own thing with startup files, adding things to
~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession won't do anything useful. However, IceWM
itself supports an init file mechanism of its own: if you place a file
called 'startup' into your ~/.icewm directory and make it executable, it
will be run when you start IceWM. Mine consists of nothing more than
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
/usr/bin/idesk &amp;

Nice work.
</p>

<p>
Just a couple of points:
</p>

<p>
- 374 MB RAM for a 64bit machine is more like half of that on a regular
32bit cpu (give and take), unless you specifically optimize your code
(which I doubt most of the ports do)
</p>

<p>
- you could opt for openbox, it supports menus and configuration of the
FreeDesktop initiative - in my case the switch was waaay less painful than
going the old way with icewm- once you install obmenu and obconf, your
initial GNOME menus are transparently imported. And don't forget to remove
Nautilus, and use instead rox-filer or PCManFM as your file manager.

I realize that. The catch-22 here is that bringing the memory up to a
reasonable amount (e.g., 2GB) would cost about half of a brand-new
notebook with that amount of memory - but throwing away a perfectly-good
laptop would be a stupid thing to do as well. What to do?  Linux +
lightweight DM/apps is the best answer I know of.

I've got an even easier way to handle that one: menu-xdg (also from
FreeDesktop.) Once you've installed it, your IceWM (or whatever) menus
will be auto-updated with new apps every time that 'update-menus' is
run.

It is possible to run 32-bit code on a 64-bit machine. One way is to
run a 32-bit (s)chroot.

&lt;shameless_plug&gt; This was described in LG #150 &lt;/shameless_plug&gt;

Users of "icewm" (like me) will soon have to put in some work on
either on fixing this wm and/or its libs or on shifting to another wm
since it depends on older versions of libraries (imlib1).

The same unfortunately applies to "fvwm" (gtk1 and glib1).

Please don't "fix" it. I remember a time when fvwm was a light nimble wm,
just like openbox, icewm, and so forth. Then they added some crappy
dependencies, which weren't even necessary if you didn't care for the latest
"bling".. and bloated it 10 times.
</p>

<p>
The only fix needed is already there: SuSE 9.3 has the packages necessary to
import your menus into IceWm from KDE and/or Gnome, i.e. to make it
compliant with the FreeDesktop way of doing the menus. (just used that
couple years ago).
</p>

<p>
I know you can, problem is, any data type will roughly gobble twice that
much memory on your 64 bit system: this was EXACTLY what I was trying to
say, if you read my message.

<p>
No, there's nothing to fix.  The only GTK1 "dependency" if it's wanted
is FvwmGTK -- funnily enough this is being discussed on the
FVWM-workers mailing list at the moment.  No GTK1 libs means it's not
built at all -- so I am not sure what you mean at all by "fix" -- and
note this FVWM module is <strong>NOT</strong> about being able to access GNOME's or
KDE's menus -- there's separate ways to do that.  The same logic
applies to gdk-imlib.

<p>
Fantastic !
</p>

<p>
This is what I was refering to (menu-xdg and the xml way of doing menus-
well, more or less), but my memory betrayed me (oh yeah, long time ago ...)
And I agree, this is the way to go- was just pointing out that in your case
it is even more so: as if you would have a 200 MB ram 32bit system!
</p>

<p>
More or less to the point: I have an even older Inspiron 5000 lap: PIII 600
MHz, initially 256 MB. Using Metacity + Gnome, it would be very annoying to
try and watch movies. Just switching to a light wm like openbox or icewm
won't cut it, as long as you keep metacity alive, to give you all the
"bling". Going initially to a "bare" openbox session, I had a very spartan
(plug here: Go Green, Go MSU!) right click menu. Then back in Gnome,  I used
Ubuntu's (that's what I have on that machine) package manager to install
some more packages (again, sorry for missing all details- personal RAM has
major refresh problems .. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> ) and probably behind the scenes this installed
the xdg-menu scheme. Now I can happily switch into openbox AND icewm and all
Gnome menus are just a right click away, without Metacity.
</p>

<p>
Nice !  I can have an acceptable movie experience with scifi.com (hello to
all BSG fans out there), not great, but a-OK. Last week, I upgraded for
about $30 to 384 MB RAM, but I would not say it made a huge difference.
Another testimony to Linux done right.
</p>

<p>
Sorry for the long post, I hope someone may find it helpful, and maybe you
guys can fill in the missing pieces and write a new article about say
multimedia on crappy old hardware. Or just host a discussion where your
readers share their experiences/experiments.

Err, <strong>only</strong> if you want those features -- or turn them off at
./configure time -- you're free to do just that, you know.

<p>
And FVWM is still very light and nimble.

Sorry for the confusion,

<p>
I did not want to insult anybody, well, let's better say any of the
developers  involved in fvwm. What I was refering to, is that some distros
started about some years ago to package fvwm together with loads of other
dependencies, some necessary, some maybe not. Personally I can't stand when
for a simple header include of one function, I have to take in the rest of
tens of MB of the lib that provides it. But you are right, I know, that's
the beauty of open source.

Oh well, where are the days of installing Slackware 3 from 7 diskettes ...
maybe then people would start appreciating more the value of the megabyte !!

<p>
Don't top-post, please.
</p>

<p>
I suspect what you're looking at here is a distribution-policy aspect.
 Binary distributions (i.e., not source-based like Gentoo) have to
have a trade-off between adding in enough functionality for a good
user-experience, which invariably means annoying someone for having a
depenency where one poor user thinks this an infringement of disk
space when it's downloaded.  You think that's bloated with FVWM?
Balderdash, confer GNOME and KDE.  ;)
</p>

<p>
This is perhaps the only beneficial reason why source-based distros
might outweigh binary ones; such library depenencies can be turned
on/off at will for packages before they're compiled.  Then again, you
can still do that with binary ones, it's just typically after the fact
of having installed and downloaded the program in the first place.
