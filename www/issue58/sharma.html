<p>In this article I will explain&nbsp; how to make your Linux box secure by taking&nbsp; 
  basic security measures. This article will enable anybody to tighten the security 
  of a redhat Linux box. 
<p><b><u>BIOS Security</u></b> <br>
  Always set a password on BIOS to disallow booting from floppy by changing the 
  BIOS settings. This&nbsp; will block undesired people from trying to boot your 
  Linux system with a special boot disk and will&nbsp; protect you from people 
  trying to change BIOS feature like allowing boot from floppy drive or&nbsp; 
  booting the server without password prompt. 
<p><b><u>LILO Security</u></b> <br>
  Add the three parameters in "/etc/lilo.conf" file i.e. time-out, restricted 
  and&nbsp; password. These options will ask for password if boot time options 
  (such as "linux single") are passed to the boot loader. <br>
  <b>Step 1</b> <br>
  Edit the lilo.conf file (vi /etc/lilo.conf) and add or change the three options 
  : <br>
  boot=/dev/hda <br>
  map=/boot/map <br>
  install=/boot/boot.b <br>
  time-out=00&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>#change this line to 00</i><br>
  prompt <br>
  Default=linux <br>
  restricted&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>#add this line</i><br>
  password=&lt;password&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>#add this line and put your password</i> 
  <br>
  image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.14-12 <br>
  label=linux <br>
  initrd=/boot/initrd-2.2.14-12.img <br>
  root=/dev/hda6 <br>
  read-only 
<p><b>Step 2</b> <br>
  The "/etc/lilo.conf" file should be readable by only root because it contains 
  unencrypted passwords. <br>
  &nbsp;[root@kapil /]# chmod 600 /etc/lilo.conf (will be no longer world readable). 
<p><b>Step 3</b> <br>
  Update your configuration file "/etc/lilo.conf" for the change to take effect. 
  <br>
  &nbsp;[Root@kapil /]# /sbin/lilo -v (to update the lilo.conf file). 
<p><b>Step 4</b> <br>
  One more security measure you can take to secure the "/etc/lilo.conf" file 
  is to set it immutable, using the chattr command. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; To set the file immutable simply, use the command: 
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [root@kapil 
  /]# chattr +i /etc/lilo.conf <br>
  This will prevent any changes (accidental or otherwise) to the "lilo.conf" file. 
<p>For more information about lilo security, read my article on <a href="http://www.linux4biz.net/articles">LILO</a>. 
  
<p>&nbsp; 
<p><b><u>Disable all special accounts</u></b> <br>
  You should&nbsp; delete all default users and group accounts that you don't 
  use on your system like lp, sync, shutdown, halt, news, uucp, operator, games, 
  gopher etc <br>
  To delete a user account : <br>
  [root@kapil /]# userdel LP 
<p>To delete a group: <br>
  [root@kapil /]# groupdel LP 
<p><b><u>Choose a Right password</u></b> <br>
  You should follow the following guidelines before choosing the right password. 
<p>The password Length: The minimum acceptable password length by default when 
  you install your Linux system is 5.&nbsp; This is not enough and must be 8.&nbsp; 
  To do this you have to edit the login.defs file (vi /etc/login.defs) and change 
  the line that read: 
<ul>
  &nbsp;<i>PASS_MIN_LEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 <br>
  </i>To read:<i> <br>
  PASS_MIN_LEN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8 </i><br>
  &nbsp;The "login.defs" is the configuration file for the login program.
</ul>
<b><u>Enable shadow password support</u></b> <br>
You should enable the shadow password feature. You can use the "/usr/sbin/authconfig" 
utility to enable the shadow password feature on your system. If you want to convert 
the existing passwords and group on your system to shadow passwords and groups&nbsp; 
then you can use the commands <b>pwconv, grpconv</b> respectively. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
<u>T<b>he root account</b></u> <br>
The "root" account is the most privileged account on a Unix system. When the administrator 
forgot to logout from the system root prompt before leaving the system then the 
system should automatically logout from the shell. To do that, you must set the 
special variable of&nbsp; Linux named "TMOUT" to the time in seconds. <br>
&nbsp;Edit your profile file "vi /etc/profile" and add the following line somewhere 
after the line that read <br>
<i>"HISTFILESIZE="</i> <br>
&nbsp;<i>TMOUT=3600 </i><br>
&nbsp;The value we enter for the variable "TMOUT=" is in second and represent 
1 hours (60 * 60 = <br>
3600 seconds). If you put this&nbsp; line in your "/etc/profile" file, then the 
automatic logout after one hour of inactivity will apply for all users on the 
system. You can set this variable in user's individual ".bashrc " file to automatically 
logout them after a certain time. <br>
&nbsp;After this parameter has been set on your system, you must logout and login 
again (as root) for&nbsp; the change to take effect. 
<p><b><u>Disable all console-equivalent access for regular users</u></b> <br>
  You should disable all console-equivalent access to programs like shutdown, 
  reboot, and halt for regular users on your server. <br>
  &nbsp;To do this, run the following command: <br>
  [root@kapil /]# rm -f /etc/security/console.apps/&lt;servicename&gt; <br>
  &nbsp;Where &lt;servicename&gt; is the name of the program to which you wish to 
  disable console-equivalent access. 
<p><b><u>Disable &amp; uninstall all unused services</u></b> <br>
  You should&nbsp; disable and uninstall all services that you do not use so that 
  you have one less thing to worry about. Look at your "/etc/inetd.conf" file 
  and&nbsp; disable what you do not need by commenting them out (by adding a # 
  at the beginning of the line), and then sending your inetd process a SIGHUP 
  command to update it to the current "inetd.conf" file.&nbsp; To do this: <br>
  <b>Step 1</b> <br>
  Change the permissions on &quot;/etc/inetd.conf&quot; file to 600, so that 
  only root can read or write to it. <br>
  [Root@kapil /]# chmod 600 /etc/inetd.conf <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <b>Step 2</b> <br>
  ENSURE that the owner of the file &quot;/etc/inetd.conf&quot; is root. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Step 3</b> <br>
  Edit the inetd.conf file (vi /etc/inetd.conf) and disable the services like: 
  <br>
  &nbsp;ftp, telnet, shell, login, exec, talk, ntalk, imap, pop-2, pop-3, finger, 
  auth, etc unless you plan to use it. If it's turned off it's much less of a 
  risk. <br>
  <br>
  <b>Step 4</b> <br>
  Send a HUP signal to your inetd process <br>
  [root@kapil /]# killall -HUP inetd <br>
  <br>
  <b>Step 5</b> <br>
  Set "/etc/inetd.conf" file immutable,&nbsp; using the <i>chattr</i> command 
  so that nobody can modify that file <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; To set the file immutable simply, 
  execute the following command: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [root@kapil 
  /]# chattr +i /etc/inetd.conf <br>
  &nbsp;This will prevent any changes (accidental or otherwise) to the "inetd.conf" 
  file. The only person that can set or clear this attribute is the super-user 
  root.&nbsp; To modify the inetd.conf file you will need to unset the immutable 
  flag: <br>
  *&nbsp; To unset the immutable simply, execute the following command: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [root@kapil 
  /]# chattr -i /etc/inetd.conf 
<p><b><u>TCP_WRAPPERS</u></b> <br>
  By using TCP_WRAPPERS&nbsp; you can make&nbsp; your server&nbsp; secure against 
  outside intrusion . The best policy is to deny all hosts by putting "ALL: ALL@ALL, 
  PARANOID" in the "/etc/hosts.deny" file and then explicitly list&nbsp; trusted 
  hosts who are allowed to your machine in the "/etc/hosts.allow" file. TCP_WRAPPERS 
  is controlled from two files and the search stops at the first match. <br>
  &nbsp;/etc/hosts.allow <br>
  /etc/hosts.deny 
<p><b>Step 1</b> <br>
  Edit the hosts.deny file (vi /etc/hosts.deny) and add the following lines: 
  <br>
  # Deny access to everyone. <br>
  ALL: ALL@ALL, PARANOID <br>
  &nbsp;Which means all services, all locations is blocked, unless they are permitted 
  access by entries in the allow file. 
<p>&nbsp;<b>Step 2</b> <br>
  Edit the hosts.allow file (vi /etc/hosts.allow) and add for example, the following 
  line: <br>
  As an example: <br>
  ftp: 202.54.15.99 foo.com<br>
  &nbsp;For your client machine: 202.54.15.99 is the IP address and foo.com the 
  host name of one of your client allowed using ftp. <br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  <b>Step 3 </b><br>
  The <i>tcpdchk</i> program is the tcpd wrapper configuration checker. It examines 
  your tcp wrapper&nbsp; configuration and reports all potential and real problems 
  it can find. 
<p>&nbsp;*&nbsp; After your configuration is done, run the program tcpdchk. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Root@kapil 
  /]# tcpdchk 
<p><b><u>Don't let system issue file to be displayed</u></b> <br>
  &nbsp;You should not&nbsp; display your&nbsp; system issue file when people 
  log in remotely . To do this,&nbsp; you can <br>
  change the telnet option in your "/etc/inetd.conf".<br>
  To do this change the line in &quot;/etc/inetd.conf&quot;:<br>
<p><i>telnet&nbsp; stream&nbsp; tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nowait&nbsp; root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  /usr/sbin/tcpd&nbsp; in.telnetd</i><br>
  to look like:<br>
  &nbsp;<i>telnet&nbsp; stream&nbsp; tcp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nowait&nbsp; 
  root&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /usr/sbin/tcpd&nbsp; in.telnetd -h </i><br>
  &nbsp;Adding the "-h" flag on the end will cause the daemon to not display any 
  system information and&nbsp; just hit the user with a login: prompt.&nbsp; I 
  will recommend to use sshd instead. 
<p><b><u>Change the "/etc/host.conf" file</u></b> <br>
  &nbsp;The&nbsp; "/etc/host.conf" file specifies how names are resolved. <br>
  &nbsp;Edit the host.conf file (vi /etc/host.conf) and add the following lines: 
  <br>
  &nbsp;# Lookup names via DNS first then fall back to /etc/hosts. <br>
  order bind,hosts <br>
  # We have machines with multiple IP addresses. <br>
  multi on <br>
  # Check for IP address spoofing. <br>
  nospoof on 
<p>&nbsp;The first option is to resolve the host name through DNS first and then 
  hosts file.The multi option determines whether a host in the "/etc/hosts" file 
  can have multiple IP addresses (multiple interface ethN). <br>
  &nbsp;The nospoof option indicates to take care of not permitting spoofing on 
  this machine. 
<p><b><u>Immunize the "/etc/services" file</u></b> <br>
  You must immunize the "/etc/services" file to prevent unauthorized deletion&nbsp; 
  or addition of services. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; To immunize 
  the "/etc/services" file, use the command: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [root@kapil 
  /]# chattr +i /etc/services 
<p><b><u>Disallow root login from different consoles</u></b> <br>
  The "/etc/securetty" file allows you to specify which TTY devices the "root" 
  user is allowed to login . Edit the "/etc/securetty" file to disable any tty 
  that you do not need by commenting them out (# at the beginning of the line). 
  <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  <b><u>Blocking anyone to su to root</u></b> <br>
  &nbsp;The su (Substitute User) command allows you to become other existing users 
  on the system.&nbsp; If&nbsp; you don't want anyone to su to root or restrict 
  "su" command to certain users then add the following two lines to the top of 
  your "su" configuration file in the "/etc/pam.d/" directory. <br>
  <b>Step 1</b> <br>
  Edit the su file (vi /etc/pam.d/su) and add the following two lines to the 
  top of the file: <br>
  &nbsp;<i>auth sufficient /lib/security/pam_rootok.so debug</i> <br>
  <i>auth required /lib/security/Pam_wheel.so group=wheel</i> 
<p>Which means only members of the "wheel" group can su to root; it also includes&nbsp; 
  logging. You can add the users to the group wheel so that only those users will 
  be allowed to su as root. <br>
  &nbsp; 
<p><b><u>Shell logging</u></b> <br>
  &nbsp;The bash shell stores up to 500 old commands in the "~/.bash_history" 
  file (where "~/" is your home directory) to make it easy for you to repeat long 
  commands. Each user that has an account on the system will have this file "Bash_history" 
  in their home directory. The bash shell should store less number of commands 
  and delete it on logout of the user.<br>
  <b>Step 1</b> <br>
  The HISTFILESIZE and HISTSIZE lines in the "/etc/profile" file determine the 
  size of old commands the "Bash_history" file for all users on your system can 
  hold.&nbsp; I would&nbsp; highly recommend setting the HISTFILESIZE and HISTSIZE 
  in "/etc/profile" file to a low value such as 30. <br>
  &nbsp;Edit the profile file (vi /etc/profile) and change the lines to: <br>
  HISTFILESIZE=30 <br>
  HISTSIZE=30 <br>
  &nbsp;Which mean, the "Bash_history" file in each users home directory can store 
  20 old commands <br>
  and no more. <br>
  &nbsp;<b>Step 2</b> <br>
  The administrator should also add into the "/etc/skel/Bash_logout" file the 
  <br>
  "<i>rm -f&nbsp; $HOME/Bash_history</i>" line, so that each time a user logs 
  out, its "Bash_history" file will be deleted.<br>
  &nbsp;Edit the Bash_logout file (vi /etc/skel/Bash_logout) and add the following 
  line: <br>
  &nbsp;<i>rm -f $HOME/Bash_history</i> 
<p><b><u>Disable the Control-Alt-Delete keyboard shutdown command</u></b> <br>
  To do this comment out the line (with a "#") listed below in your "/etc/inittab" 
  file . <br>
  &nbsp;To do this, edit the inittab file (vi /etc/inittab) and change the line: 
  <br>
  &nbsp;<i>ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now </i><br>
  To read: <br>
  <i>#ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now </i><br>
  &nbsp;Now, for the change to take effect type in the following at a prompt: 
  <br>
  &nbsp;[root@kapil /]# /sbin/init q 
<p><b><u>Fix the permissions under "/etc/rc.d/init.d" directory for script files</u></b> 
  <br>
  &nbsp;Fix the permissions of the script files that are responsible for starting 
  and stopping all your normal&nbsp; processes that need to run at boot time.&nbsp; 
  To do this: <br>
  &nbsp;[root@kapil/]# chmod -R 700 /etc/rc.d/init.d/* <br>
  &nbsp;Which means only root is allowed to Read, Write, and Execute scripts files 
  on this directory. 
<p><b><u>Hide your system information</u></b> <br>
  &nbsp;By default, when you login to a Linux box, it tells you the Linux distribution 
  name, version, kernel&nbsp; version, and the name of the server. This is sufficient 
  information for a crackers to get information about your server. You should 
  just prompt users with a "Login:" prompt. <br>
  &nbsp;<b>Step 1</b> <br>
  To do this, Edit the "/etc/rc.d/rc.local" file and Place "#" in front of the 
  following lines as shown: 
<p># This will overwrite /etc/issue at every boot.&nbsp; So, make any changes 
  you <br>
  # want to make to /etc/issue here or you will lose them when you reboot. <br>
  #echo "" &gt; /etc/issue <br>
  #echo "$R" &gt;&gt; /etc/issue <br>
  #echo "Kernel $(uname -r) on $a $(uname -m)" &gt;&gt; /etc/issue <br>
  # <br>
  #cp -f /etc/issue /etc/issue.net <br>
  #echo &gt;&gt; /etc/issue <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;<b>Step 2</b> <br>
  Then, remove the following files: "issue.net" and "issue" under "/etc" directory: 
  <br>
  &nbsp;[root@kapil /]# rm -f /etc/issue <br>
  [root@kapil /]# rm -f /etc/issue.net 
<p><b><u>Disable unused SUID/SGID programs</u></b> <br>
  &nbsp;A regular user will be able to run a program as root if it is set to SUID 
  root. A system administrator should minimize the use of these SUID/GUID programs 
  and disable the programs which are not needed. <br>
  <b>Step 1</b> <br>
  *&nbsp; To find all files with the `s' bits from root-owned programs, use the 
  command: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [root@kapil]# find / 
  -type f \( -perm -04000 -o -perm -02000 \) \-exec ls &shy;lg {} \; 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp; To disable the suid bits on selected programs 
  above, type the following commands: <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [root@kapil /]# chmod 
  a-s [program] <br>
  &nbsp; 
<p>After following the above security guidelines, a system administrator can maintain 
  a basic level of system security. Some of the above tasks are a continuous process. 
  The system administrator has to continuously follow the above guidelines to 
  keep system secure. <br>
