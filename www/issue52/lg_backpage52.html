Part computer programmer, part cartoonist, part Mars Bar. At night, he runs
around in a pair of colorful tights fighting criminals. During the day... well,
he just runs around.  He eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's sleepy.                                           

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Fernando Correa and Luis Strano</H4>
Fernando is a computer analyst just about to finish his 
graduation at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Now, he has built
with his staff the best 
<A HREF="http://www.olinux.com.br">Linux Portal</A> in Brazil and have further 
plans to improve services and content for their Internet users.

<P> Luis is a 17-year-old student in Sao Paulo and a volunteer in
this section at OLinux.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Sean Lamb</H4>
I'm currently working on completing my BS degree in Computer Science at Lakeland
College (begun earlier at the University of California, Riverside). I've been
involved in computer support for the past 6 years, via phone, fax, and email,
and I have created documentation for use by end users (some articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base) and other support staff (published in-house as either
individual documents or on the support intranet), and I contributed some
chapters to "Special Edition Using KDE" from Que publishing (now in print). I
have done some application development on MS-DOS platforms and have begun
developing a pair of applications for my Linux box. I am currently employed as
a software developer working in C++ with Informix on a mix of Linux and AIX
servers. When I'm not playing with or writing about Linux, I can usually be
found working on my model railroad.

A cyberjack-of-all-trades, Ben wanders the world in his 38' sailboat, building
networks and hacking on hardware and software whenever he runs out of cruising
money. He's been playing and working with computers since the Elder Days
(anybody remember the Elf II?), and isn't about to stop any time soon.

Mike is the Editor of the <I>Linux Gazette</I>.  You can read what he has to 
say in the Back Page column in this issue.  He has been a Linux enthusiast
since 1991 and a Debian user since 1995.  He is SSC's web technical
coordinator, which means he gets to write a lot of Python scripts.

Esperanto.

<P> Next month <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> will have a new Editor: Jason Kroll.
Jason is the Technical Editor for <EM>Linux Journal</EM>, so you may know
him from his product reviews and Stupid Programming Tricks column.  He is
a strong supporter/activist for free software, and I predict he is going
to have a lot of fun running the <EM>Gazette</EM>.  Especially considering
the enthusiasm of its readers and contributors, as I have always commented.

<P> I will continue to work on technical aspects of SSC's web sites, which
means writing more web applications in Python, such as the <EM>LG</EM> 
Discussion forums unveiled last month.  (What do you guys think of them, by
the way?)

<P> Next month, Jason and I will be working together to produce the May issue.
The following month, he'll be on his own, because I'll be on VACATION in 
England and Scotland, and not turning on a computer at all if I can help it!

<P> The following quote was sent to me by a coworker.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The classically minded among us may have noted a new TV
ad for Microsoft's Internet Explorer e-mail program which uses the
musical theme of the "Confutatis Maledictis" from  Mozart's Requiem.

<P> "Where do you want to go today?" is the cheery line on the screen.
Meanwhile, the chorus sings "Confutatis maledictis, flammis acribus
addictis."

<P> This translates to "The damned  and accursed are convicted to the
flames of hell."

<P> Good to know that Microsoft has done its research.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Thanks for sending in your articles and 2-cent tips.  
Remember: don't just use Linux this month, have fun with it!
