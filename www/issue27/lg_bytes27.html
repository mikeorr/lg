Linus Torvalds Receives VA Research Excellence Award
</H3> 
<P>
February 26, 1998<BR> 
VA Research granted its Excellence in Open Source Software Award to
Linus Torvalds, father of the Linux operating system and one of the most
important leaders in information technology.  Linus received a
VArStation YMP, worth $4500, at 
The Silicon Valley Linux Users Group meeting in March. (See <A
HREF="./dibona.html">article</A> in this issue by Chris Dibona.)
<P>
The VA Research Excellence in Open Source Software Award honors
exceptional individuals within the free software community.  Torvalds led
this community to create Linux, a freely distributable multi-user,
multi-tasking Unix-like operating system.  Linux is now used in a range of
applications from mission critical servers to desktop workstations.
<P>
VA Research is the oldest and largest Linux systems company.  Founded in
1993 by electrical engineering doctoral students at Stanford University,
VA Research pioneered high performance workstations and servers based on
Linux.  In 1997, VA Research became an affiliate of Umax.

New Linux and Open Source Business Usage Advocacy page
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Thu, 12 Mar 1998 21:06:35 +1100 (EST)<BR> 
There is a new advocacy page for Linux (and other
open source, free software). This site is primarily focused on solid
business reasons as to why companies should use Linux. The opening
blurb states:
<P>
...
We (and a growing number of other firms) are heavy users of software such
as Linux, GNU and FreeBSD which can be classified as 'freely redistributable' or 'co-operatively developed',
but feel that there is considerable lack of knowledge of these systems and applications in the
general business community. We (and some of the companies listed below) are therefore
building this web presence to help provide information, documentation, showcase projects, links to
related sites and other useful resources to to help redress this. This will include freely
redistributable systems software, and free and commercial applications which run on these systems which may
be of interest to helping you run your business.

Samba: Integrating UNIX and Windows
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Fri,  6 Mar 1998 08:36:32 GMT<BR> 
Samba is the tool of choice for providing Windows file sharing and
printer services from UNIX and UNIX-like systems. Freely available
under the GNU Public License, Samba allows UNIX machines to be
seamlessly integrated into a Windows network without installing any
additional software on the Windows machines. Used in tandem with Linux
or FreeBSD, Samba provides a low-cost alternative to the Windows NT
Server. 
<P>
This book, a combination of technical tutorial, reference guide, and
how-to manual, contains the depth of knowledge experienced network
administrators demand without skipping the information beginners need to
get fast results.  UNIX administrators new to Windows networking will find
the information they need to become Windows networking experts.  Those new
to UNIX will find the details they need to install and configure Samba
correctly and securely.
<P>
The book also contains a CD-ROM containing version 1.9.18 of the Samba
server, a library of useful tools and scripts, the Samba mailing list
archives, and all examples discussed in the book.

Netscape turns to Debian for Licensing Guidance!
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Fri,  6 Mar 1998 09:23:38 GMT<BR> 
When Netscape decided to make their client software free, they
used the Debian Free Software Guidelines for a guide on how to
write their license. You can find the draft Netscape license at
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/">http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/</A>.
This is a historic day for us, since it
means that "Mozilla" (Netscape Communicator) will eventually be in the
"main" part of Debian and all Linux systems, instead of the "non-free" section
as it is now.
<P>
A link to a Netscape press release (containing a quote from Bruce Perens)
can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease579.html">

Open Source promotional program for free software can be found at

<P>
There is work yet to be done - a few license bug-lets will be resolved
within the next few days, and once the source code is released there are
some parts that Netscape does not own that will most likely have to be
replaced with free software.

Perl Conference 2.0 - Call for Participation

The second annual <A HREF="http://conference.perl.com/">O'Reilly Perl
Conference</A> will be held August
17-20, 1998 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, California. The
conference will feature two days of tutorials followed by a two
day conference. The conference will include sessions for
submitted papers on practical and experimental uses of Perl;
invited presentations; daily Q and A sessions with leading
Perl developers and trainers; a by-invitation Developers
Workshop; and nightly user-organized Birds-of-a-Feather sessions
for special interest groups.
<P>
In the practical spirit of Perl, we seek papers that describe
how you are using Perl right now for work or play, and how your
experience and your code can help others. This is not a
traditional solicitation for academic papers. While we look
forward to papers on new and useful extensions, applications,
and tools, we are most interested in receiving papers that show
Perl hard at work, saving time, money, and headaches for you and
your organization. We welcome submissions that work under both
Unix and non-Unix systems, such as Win32.

Socket Script v1.5
</H3>
<P> 
Date: Tue, 10 Mar 1998 13:30:15 GMT
   Socket Script has been made for people who wants to create
   networking-oriented programs, but don't want to learn all the socket
   stuff. It has multiple network commands that enable you to tell the
   SScript interpreter where you want to connect, and all you have to
   do is focus on the script itself, leaving the connection parts to
   SScript. The best part is that most scripts will run on most Unix
   workstations, and win32 platforms.

Cecilia2.0 - electroacoustic music software
</H3>
<P> 
Date: Tue, 17 Mar 1998 08:45:31 GMT<BR> 
<P>
We are happy to announce version 2 of CECILIA, the musician's software that
makes you funnier, smarter and more attractive to the opposite sex. 
<P>
Cecilia was developed by composers of electroacoustic music for composers of
electroacoustic music. If you have to ask, don't bother.
Cecilia is probably the wackiest sound maker in the world at this time. In fact,
we believe nothing else even comes close.
Cecilia is for high-concept audio processing. It is not for sequencing your
rinky-dink samplers and synths. 
<P>
Cecilia is freeware at present. The next version will not be. Count your blessings.
Cecilia runs on Macintoshes, Linux boxes and SGIs. It does not run on
Windows. When it does, we'll sell it and become obscenely wealthy.
<P>
Cecilia is strictly for people who have a sense of humour. We, on the other
hand, are very cranky people.
<P>
Cecilia is available for download at :<BR>

Mtools 3.9 - Access MS-Dos/Win 95 disks from Unix without mounting

Date: Tue, 17 Mar 1998 08:38:33 GMT<BR> 
I would like to announce a new release of Mtools, a collection of
utilities to access MS-DOS disks from Unix without mounting them.
<P>
 Mtools supports Win'95 style long file names, FAT32, OS/2 Xdf disks
and 2m disks (store up to 1992k on a high density 3 1/2 disk). Mtools
also includes mpartition, a simple partitioning programming to setup
Zip and Jaz media on non-PC machines (SunOs, Solaris and HP/UX).

New XML.com site
</H3>
<P>
Date: Wed, 25 Mar 1998 20:08:29 -0800 (PST)
SEBASTOPOL, CA--XML, the industrial-strength mark-up language
used for  Web development, is a
tool for electronic commerce and information management. 
With the recent approval of the XML Specification by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), interest in XML development has picked up
considerable steam.
<P>
To promote the development and commercial acceptance of XML, three
companies that have long been Web insiders--O'Reilly & Associates,
their affiliate Songline Studios, and Seybold Publications--have joined
together to create XML.com (http://www.xml.com), a new Web site that
serves as a key resource and nerve center for XML developers and users.
A preview site is now available, and the launch date for the full site
is May 1, 1998.
<P>
XML.com features a rich mix of information and services for the XML
community.  The site is designed to serve both people who are already
working with XML and those HTML users who want to "graduate" to XML's
power and complexity.
