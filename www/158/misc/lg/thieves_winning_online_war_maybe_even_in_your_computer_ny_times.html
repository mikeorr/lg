<p>
<pre class='code'>
Despite the efforts of the computer security industry and a half-decade
struggle by Microsoft to protect its Windows operating system, malicious
software is spreading faster than ever. The so-called malware
surreptitiously takes over a PC and then uses that computer to spread
more malware to other machines exponentially. Computer scientists and
security researchers acknowledge they cannot get ahead of the onslaught.
</pre>

<p>
(Full story here:
<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/technology/internet/06security.html'>http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/06/technology/internet/06security.html</a>)
</p>

<p>
Gosh, that last sentence has me all terrified. "Cannot get ahead of the
onslaught", even.
</p>

<p>
I remember the last time I had a virus. I downloaded it, compiled it (in
a chroot-jail sandbox, just in case), and played with it for a bit - it
created a neat little "/tmp/.bliss" log file for me to read. Then, I ran
it again with an option that told it to go away, and it was gone.
</p>

<p>
It didn't make me feel onslaughtered (I think that's the proper
verb... &lt;barbie_mode&gt;English is *hard!&lt;/barbie_mode&gt;) at all. I don't
know what those other people's problem is.
</p>


<p>
Seriously - it's a badly-written article, with lots of name dropping and
little actual research. The author doesn't even mention Linux (or BSD,
or any options beyond OS/X.) The general point is that the Bad Guys are
making lots of money ripping off the poor little users... but this is
just the same old three-card monty multiplied by a few million naive
hayseeds just off the train. Yep, there are more con men and more
suckers, as well as more unsuspecting mules. [shrug] It's called a
"growing population" and "better communications". That, as always,
presumes either A) an increased ability to swim with the sharks or B)
accepting, however unwillingly, your role as an <em>hors d'oeuvre</em> . There
is no option C - and never has been.
</p>

<p>
I guess the NYT needs some low-calorie filler for their Technology
section once in a while...

Reviewing that article would provide some good material for a LG
article - And that really makes me wonder if he gets some cash from M$
or he didn't ever heard of Linux...

Oh, I think it's a case of "ignorance/stupidity before malice". Malice
takes effort and intent (barring a few truly disturbed individuals);
ignorance and stupidity are as common as hydrogen. Also, I find that
assuming the former rather than the latter creates a bit more peace of
mind.
</p>

<p>
I'm only annoyed because I expected NYT to do a bit more fact-checking,
a little journalistic integrity.
