<h4 align="center"><br>Lifehacks
</h4>
<P><STRONG>
<a href="http://www.lifehacks.com/wiki/FrontPage">Lifehacks</a>
are an idea that was put forward by
<a href="http://www.oblomovka.com/">Danny O'Brien</a>
at the
<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/et2004/view/e_sess/4802">O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference</a>.
 Lifehacks are the result of taking one of the basic principles of
self-help -- find out how the experts work,
and emulate them -- and applying it to geeks.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
One of the least surprising discoveries of the Lifehacks research is
that "Overprolific Alpha Geeks" spend most of their working lives using
the shell. Two of the
<a href="http://craphound.com/lifehacks2.txt">conclusions</a>
of the talk are that geeks will have private blogs/RSS feeds.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Why would you use private blogs?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Most people need to provide their bosses with periodic reports. Because
feed aggregators are available for almost every imaginable platform,
reading feeds is not an issue. Having reports available in a private
blog offers two immediate benefits: each report is archived in a known
location; and the feed reader provides notification of new entries (as
well as keeping its own archive of entries). Making reports available as
a feed can also boost productivity and increase communication --
sysadmins, for example, can generate many of their reports from log
files, and add this to the feed so their boss no longer needs to wait
around for a formal report; programmers can use scripts in CVS (or other
version control systems) that generate a report containing a list of
changed files and the log message for every commit.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
A popular use of blogs is as a whiteboard -- people thinking out loud,
inviting passers-by to offer suggestions or criticism which may help to
improve an idea. By maintaining different blogs with varying levels of
availability, people can share ideas with the appropriate audience
without revealing things they would prefer to keep secret.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The most basic advantage of writing down an idea is that you no longer
have to worry about remembering it. Even writing to a completely private
blog, as a "todo" list, has advantages. Writing an idea forces you to
clarify your own thoughts: the simple act of writing an idea down to
remember it can lead to you expressing it well enough to share it with a
wider audience. Once an idea is written, it can then be refactored --
you can share it at a later date, when you have developed it further.
Another advantage is that each blog entry is automatically dated, so
each idea can be compared with public blog entries from the same time,
so you can discover why the idea was relevant; and if nothing else, a
blog provides you with a single place where you can archive your ideas
and
<a href="http://www.lifehacks.com/wiki/SecretScripts">"secret scripts"</a>
in case you need them again.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Semi-public blogs, available only on a company or department intranet,
allow co-workers to keep track of each others activities and to offer
and receive suggestions about ideas without publicly exposing company
secrets. Information put on a semi-private blog may later become
suitable for public consumption, such as a note about a bug in a
product, or information about server downtime.
</STRONG></P>

This is the sort of thing that I've been doing unconsciously for the
last 20 years, and what's been lacking is the vision to make it a
conscious process.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Every machine I have does webserving, I drop stuff into the serving
space for testing, for review, for remembering.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I put stuff on my public site so that when I forget I ever knew how to
do a thing, I can google for the answer and find what I wrote once upon
a time (that's happened THREE times in the last year).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I <EM>rsync</EM> everything, everywhere. <EM>Cron</EM> takes care of most of it,
occasionally I'll manually run a set to a sometimes running box, and
then shut it down and put it in the basement. Mostly that's private
stuff, and not the things that can be replicated or are static,
committed to DVD+R (like the ogg collection).

I run
<a href="http://www.phpgroupware.org/">phpGroupWare</a>

everything from a demo of how the Windows messenger error looks when
Samba +

+Samba-vscan catches an inbound virus, to the mods I might
make to my cube to get a nerf-weapon war type of battle-cube.

All of my email accounts are IMAP, I have 5 active places, and I copy

I do the same. Anything that I <em>  really  </em> like, or may need in real life,
I email to my phone (my phone has Blackberry email, so email to my

I don't have a useful PDA. I've had FUN ones, linux-based, but I'm
thinking I need a real one, one of these days. Useful AND used. All the
Linux ones provided tools to sync/work with Windows boxen. Um, sorry,
don't run that one, got any other choices? I'm leaning towards Treo. Any
thoughts?

I have one "blog" that I'm experimenting with, using
<a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>
. There are parts of it I like, but for many purposes I really like the
read-in-time-ordinal of journalling rather than the reverse mode of
Blogging. I suppose that's why I've never really mentally connected with
RSS feeds, even though a great number of people I know think that feeds
are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Are these "problems" for me?
Am I just in the wrong phase of a Candlestick-Two Faces conundrum?
Thoughts, please...

Heh. That was an obvious use I didn't see mentioned. Back in college I
used to have a bunch of scripts that ran grep over various log files,
diffed them against yesterday's, and mailed the result to an admin account.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I used them to track things like who used su and when etc., and had
something similar in root's .bash_logout so I could compare and see who
was doing what (not to snoop, just to offer a helping hand to the newbie
admins).

Since the USB card reader doesn't ALWAYS see media inserted, a quick
cfdisk brings that problem to an end. I mount the card, copy the
contents to the directory I specified on the commandline. Ick, no test
for correct input, eh? Unmount, prompt, call another script to convert
all to 640x480. use
<a href="http://gqview.sourceforge.net/">GQview</a>
to pick and choose. Those I keep, I may edit
using
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>
from within GQview. When I'm done, I have the 640x480 snaps
that I'll use on the website. Exit GQview and the script continues. Make
thumbnails of the remaining files. Copy everything into my local copy of
the webtree. Blow the whole processing tree away, leaving me with camera
originals on the disk. I don't use this one much anymore, because I have
a new camera and a new method of doing some of that stuff. I haven't
automated it yet because I've been too busy to save time. Sigh.

I keep my photos on

flickr), and my links on
<a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>

I have another little script, a three liner that drops me down into the
current year's working directory in my web space, pops a firefox window
pointing at <b>http://localhost/xxx/xxx/blah.php</b>, and fires up bluefish
with the most recently edited page in the window.

I have a number of scripts dedicated to setting up ssh tunnelling for

PlannerMode is an organizer and day planner for Emacs. It helps you keep
track of your pending and completed tasks, daily schedule, dates to remember,
notes and inspirations.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
emacs-outline-mode:
very useful if you are writing an outline for an
article or just taking notes. (I find wiki-mode more user friendly, see
below)

emacs-wiki-mode:
This is a Emacs mode for maintaining a local Wiki.
Though I use it for making outlines of articles and keeping notes during
meetings.  The main idea is that you write using plain text, but it is
rendered on emacs as html. (emacs-wiki-mode comes with emacs-planner-mode)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Instead of having a personal blog to keep a track of
personal-todos/inspirations etc. , I use a wiki:

The great thing about
<a href="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/">MoinMoin</a>
is, it supports access control lists,
so it can be public and private spaces at the same time.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Yeah, pardon my dust over there at SysadMoin, it's only available inside
our LAN at the moment while I'm preparing an upgrade.  Not moin's fault - I
had a hard disk go <EM>crunch</EM> - most annoying - geez, it's a good thing I make
regular backups.  A few merges, oh, I have to re-do my dark theme too...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Ahhhhh, backups.  If there's one "hack" I've taken back
out of the computer world into my real life, it's making sure to have
backups.  Backup plans, backup copies of contact info, someone to backup
for me if that old problem about not being able to be in two places at
once strikes home.  Save early, save often, save extras.

<blockQuote>
Over in #moin on freenode, where I have been hanging out a lot lately,
there's one fellow (deitarion) who's cleaning up not only a lifetime
of loose notes but also organizing and commenting on a number of files
he's gathered over time, using MoinMoin Desktop Edition, in other words,
a wiki <EM>designed</EM> to be personal:
<A HREF="http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/DesktopEdition"

He seems to have saved a bunch of space already and be working on some
search engine tricks for it, combining it with
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/gtktalog/">GTKtalog</a>
(commandline fans may prefer
<a href="http://www2.gvsu.edu/~swietonm/index.html">SwissDB</a>
)
and planning on a local web proxy to manage his external bookmarks.
He's working on saving enough space and/or being clear enough on what's
his, to have this help his emigration from his current distro to Gentoo.

One of the best tips I saw is one from JWZ. He keeps an <TT>/etc/setup</TT>
script, and every time he does anything from the root account, copies
and pastes it into the script, and comments it saying why, before
copying it to his other machines, so he can have every machine set up to
exactly the same state whenever needed.

Jim (the Answer Guy) and I both keep a README file for each of our
machines, either in <TT>/etc</TT> or in <TT>/</TT> (I like to hardlink them together;
keeping <TT>/etc</TT> on a seperate partition from <TT>/</TT> is rare and creepy, but a
symlink would do nicely - hardlinks, though, protect it from being
deleted by the fs if one of the links is removed).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
This file datestamps any interesting changes we do to a machine,
possibly including script bits, fstab tweaks, etc.  Reading it <EM>should</EM>
be enough to figure out how to spin up another machine just like this
one even without the box itself.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I also keep one of these in each complete chroot area I set up, since I
treat them like whole machines.  Which brings me to the next Lifehack :)
For chroot'd environments that aren't just the single app, I change its
<TT>/etc/hostname</TT> to something that clarifies what it is (past examples
include "rescue", "minideb", "dev-potato", "memoryalpha" for my trek
stuff), and I change the part in the root user's setup (<TT>/root/.bashrc</TT>)
so that instead of asking for hostname:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>export PS1='\h:\w\$ '
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
...it uses the contents of the hostname file:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>export PS1="-=[ `cat /etc/hostname` ]=- \w\$ "
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Note the doublequotes - if you use single quotes, the command to cat the
file is going to be used every time, and you don't really change a
chroot's hostname all the time, do you?  (I certainly don't.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Since my chroot'd prompt also looks different, even without colorization
tricks that I use on my terminals, I can easily tell that I'm in the
chroot, and which one I'm in.   So nice when I'm ssh'd in and using a
screen session heavily.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you haven't heard of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a>
then for goodness' sake get it.  Job control
is nice, but this gives whole windows with real terminals, so the
<EM>human</EM> can multitask too;  things that you might want to background can
be run in another window where they think they have foreground;  it can
be told to log one of its windows (great when a compile or some other
scripted thing is about to spout lots of text you want to read later, or
grep through); with some rather careful permission settings it can even
be used in multi-user mode, so you can show a junior admin, your kid
sister, or a linux newbie you're helping spin up to speed, the exact
things that you're doing.  With screen you don't need X and vnc unless
you need graphics :)
