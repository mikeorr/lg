Dear Jim,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am in need of a way to secure a modem line (serial) of an
assigned tty port, from dial out. This seems like an impossible
task. Do you have any suggestions, words of wisdom?  I'm running
2.0.35 currently, a <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> 3.5 distribution.
</STRONG></P>

You want to prevent some or all of your users from
dialing out a modem that's on one of your serial ports?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's easy.  Just change the ownership on the device
node (/dev/ttyS* and/or the deprecated <TT>/dev/cua*)</TT> and
(possibly) on every installed program that uses the modem
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Actually there is a minor complication here.  Conventionally
modem using programs are SGID to the "uucp" or "modem"
group.  That is to say that these programs execute as
members of that group regardless of whether the user that
started them was in the group or not.  So the question
becomes:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote>
"How does one limit execution of SGID" programs?
</BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you strip off the world-execute bit with a command like
chmod o-x, then you'd have to add the users who <EM>do</EM> need
access to this program to the "modem" group.  But then they
wouldn't need to access your modem <EM>using</EM> the SGID program
--- and they wouldn't have to respect the modem lock files
or any other restrictions on the use of the device.  So,
we can't limit it that way.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We could make these programs SUID and change the ownership
(rather than just the group assignment) of the device node.
Then the devices wouldn't have to be group writable, and
we could create a special group of modem users, assign
our  modem programs to that and add our authorized modem
users to that group.  However this poses a greater security
risk.  If someone subverts (tricks) an SGID program they
can only do relatively limited damage.  If they subvert
an SUID program they can change the permissions and
executable files owned by that program's account.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hmm.  Such a conundrum.  The answer is pretty easy ---
but I had to invent it myself.  I've never seen it written
up in any book or article (other than the ones that I've
written).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
THE WHOLE PATCH IS A SET OF ACCESS CONTROL POLICIES!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, you create a directory full of your SGID programs.  you
can asign it to any arbitrary group.  Make the directory
inaccessible to "others" (mode 550 or 750 for example).
Now, only the owner of the directory and members of the
associated group can access any of the links (filenames) in
that directory.  You can replace the original file link
(under <TT>/usr/bin</TT> or wherever) with a symlink to the
restricted directory.  That symbolic link can only be
followed by members of the associated group.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can even make two different "group restricted"
directories --- associated with different groups.  Each can
contain HARD links to the same SGID world executable file.
Members of either group can then access their link to the
program, and thus execute it.  Other users can "see" (or
access or execute) the program.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You could also require that a user concurrently be a member
of multiple different groups to access a program or other
file. You just put one group limited directory under
another.  The whole path is a set of access controls.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course there is a downside to this.  Let's say that you
wanted to grant 'minicom' access to members of "staff" and
of "wheel."  So you create a <TT>/usr/bin/staff/</TT> and a
<TT>/usr/bin/wheel.</TT>  Each is set to mode 750 and each as a hard
link to the minicom program.  You ensure that now other
(world accessible) links exist to the program).  Now these
users have to use different paths to access the same
program.  This suggests that members of each group needs
additional entries on their $PATH environment string.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even though its not explicitly covered in any of the books
I've read I'm sure some sysadmins sometimes use a scheme
such as I've described.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's not so bad.  It's a bit confusing --- but then, so
are "access control lists" (ACLs) as supported by Netware,
NT, and some other versions of Unix.  I note that the
versions of Unix which support ACLs (Solaris, HP-UX, AIX,
etc) make no use of them by default.  Professional sysadmins
almost never use them.  This suggests that the stock Unix
"permissions" scheme is enough for almost all practical
purposes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You have to do this for every program which is SUID or SGID
to the "modem" group (or whatever group you assigned your
<TT>/dev/ttyS</TT> node to).  Many sites use the "uucp" group for
this (since the 'uucico' command, from the UUCP subsystem
was one of the first commands used for this sort of thing).

Thanks for a response, I know how popular you are.
