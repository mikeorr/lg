<h1>Populating a Filesystem with Random Data</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

<p>
Occasionally, I test filesystems. Especially since Ext4 was taken into
the Linux kernel, I've set up a couple of partitions and used them for
storing data. Sometimes, you don't want to copy existing data on new
filesystems when testing. Why not use random data? Now, where is the tool
for doing that? I asked The Answer Gang, and so got another excuse for
coding a tool.
</p>


<h2>
Why Random Data?
</h2>

<p>
One of the easier methods of filling a filesystem is to use download
tools, extract the content of GNU/Linux distributions (do a standard
installation and use the root filesystem), or simply copy parts of
<tt>/dev/zero</tt> by using <tt>dd</tt>. You can even put backups on the
filesystem, and thus fill it sensibly. All these methods work, but
copying means you have to take it from somewhere. There's always a
source and a destination. I don't want a source; I want to create data
out of thin air and just use a single target. Besides, when doing
testing of filesystems and something goes wrong, you probably don't want
to publish parts of this filesystem in the bug report with your backup
data on it. In addition, I just want to give the limits in terms of
directory depth, number of files/directories, and maximum number of bytes
per file and be done with it.  </p>

<h2>
Using a Bash Script
</h2>

<p>
Soon after my question was sent to the mailing list, Ben answered with a
Bash script.
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Wed Jul 16 18:04:33 EDT 2008

########    User settings     ############
MAXDIRS=5
MAXDEPTH=2
MAXFILES=10
MAXSIZE=1000
######## End of user settings ############

# How deep in the file system are we now?
TOP=`pwd|tr -cd '/'|wc -c`

populate() {
	cd $1
	curdir=$PWD

	files=$(($RANDOM*$MAXFILES/32767))
	for n in `seq $files`
	do
		f=`mktemp XXXXXX`
		size=$(($RANDOM*$MAXSIZE/32767))
		head -c $size /dev/urandom &gt; $f
	done

	depth=`pwd|tr -cd '/'|wc -c`
	if [ $(($depth-$TOP)) -ge $MAXDEPTH ]
	then
		return
	fi

	unset dirlist
	dirs=$(($RANDOM*$MAXDIRS/32767))
	for n in `seq $dirs`
	do
		d=`mktemp -d XXXXXX`
		dirlist="$dirlist${dirlist:+ }$PWD/$d"
	done

	for dir in $dirlist
	do
		populate "$dir"
	done
}

populate $PWD
</pre>

<p>
This gets the job done. It uses Bash's built-in pseudo-random-generator
(PRNG), then recursively creates and descends into the directory until the
maximum depth is reached. The shell is perfectly suited for this. You
can also do this in Perl, Python, or any other scripting language.
</p>

<h2>
Using C++
</h2>

<p>
The reasons for writing a C++ version of the script are purely educational.
It doesn't hurt to write code. Step by step, you can learn things and
improve, which isn't a bad thing. My main intention was to try the program
option parsing library of the Boost project. The algorithm is already laid
out in the shell script, so all we have to do is to get the user's options,
and create the files and directories.
</p>

<h3>
Program Options
</h3>

<p>
The command-line options usually consist of a couple of switches. Some take
an argument, some don't. Very often, there's a help option presenting a
little help text, describing all possible options and their defaults. The
Boost program options library lets you do this very easily.  You create a
<tt>options_description</tt> object, and simply describe what you want to
have.
</p>

<pre class="code">
popt::options_description desc("Options for fspopulate");
desc.add_options()
    ("debug,d", popt::value&lt;unsigned int&gt;(&amp;opt_debug)-&gt;default_value(0),
     "Set debug level of the code.")
    ("dirlevels,D", popt::value&lt;unsigned int&gt;(&amp;opt_dirlevels)-&gt;default_value(16),
     "Set maximum number of directory levels.")
    ("help,h", "Show a short help message with explanations.")
    ("logfile,l", popt::value(&amp;opt_logfile), "Log file for recording information.")
    ("maxfilesize", popt::value&lt;unsigned int&gt;(&amp;opt_max_filesize)-&gt;default_value(INT_MAX/2),
     "Maximum size of created files.")
    ("maxnamelen", popt::value&lt;unsigned short&gt;(&amp;opt_max_namelength)-&gt;default_value(100),
     "Maximum length of file and directory names.")
    ("numdirs", popt::value&lt;unsigned int&gt;(&amp;opt_number_directories)-&gt;default_value(512),
     "Maximum number of created directories.")
    ("numfiles", popt::value&lt;unsigned int&gt;(&amp;opt_number_files)-&gt;default_value(1024),
     "Maximum number of created files.")
    ("path,p", popt::value(&amp;opt_path), "Path to directory that is to be populated.")
    ("quiet,q", popt::bool_switch(&amp;opt_quiet), "Be quiet about the whole operation.")
;
</pre>

<p>
This sets all options, default values, and data types, and provides a
little help string literal. As you can see, it is possible to provide
multiple switches such as <tt>--debug</tt> and <tt>-d</tt> for setting the
debug level. All we have to do now is to parse the command-line vector. You
do this by creating a <tt>variables_map</tt> object and using the
<tt>store</tt>/<tt>notify</tt> methods.
</p>

<pre>
popt::store(popt::parse_command_line(argc, argv, desc), vm);
popt::notify(vm);
</pre>

<p>
That's it. Now you can access the command-line options through the
<tt>vm</tt> object. Checking for the presence of an option and extracting
the value can be done like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
// Check for help option.
if ( vm.count("help") &gt; 0 ) {
    cout &lt;&lt; desc &lt;&lt; endl;
    return(rc);
}
// Extract debug level
if ( (vm.count("debug") &gt; 0) or (vm.count("d") &gt; 0) ) {
    opt_debug = vm["debug"].as&lt;unsigned int&gt;();
}
</pre>

<p>
In addition, the Boost program options library allows you to parse the
options from a configuration file.
</p>

<h3>
Filenames and Paths
</h3>

<p>
Filenames and paths are basically strings with some extra properties.
This is no problem, as long as you write code for a single system. If you
are interested in writing portable code, you have to deal with directory
separators ("/" or "\"), drive letters, and other peculiarities. The
Boost filesystem library helps us to handle filenames and paths
transparently. You just use a <tt>path</tt> object, and the library takes
care of the local path translation.
</p>

<p>
The object <tt>path</tt> represents a path. The object is aware of the
valid directory separator your operating system uses.  It knows about
concepts such as root directory, and you can easily extract the base
name of a file by calling the <tt>leaf()</tt> method. (You can do more,
there is a list showing the <a
href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/filesystem/doc/reference.html#Path-decomposition-table">path
decomposition table</a> that shows what you can extract and how you do
it.) You can also use iterators to recursively browse a filesystem. In
addition, the library overloads operators, so that constructing path
objects is as easy as writing <tt>newpath = arg_path / "foo" /
"bar"</tt>. People using script languages will probably yawn at this
point. Well, now you can do the same in C++.
</p>

<h2>
Twisting Randomness
</h2>

<p>
Now, we need a decent random source for our code. Using
<tt>/dev/random</tt> is out of the question; this resource is too precious
to create random numbers, since the size of the entropy pool is limited.
<tt>/dev/urandom</tt> sounds better, but reading from it also depletes the
kernel's entropy pool, albeit much more slowly. Imagine we populate a
filesystem with gigabytes of data. This would leave next to no entropy in
the pool, although <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> doesn't block and continues to
supply random numbers. If an application simultaneously reads from
<tt>/dev/random</tt>, it has to wait for the entropy pool to fill again.
There has to be another way. We really don't need entropy for our tasks,
since pseudo-randomness is more than enough for our case.  We could use C's
<tt>lrand48()</tt> function, but there are other options. The Mersenne
Twister PRNG (=Pseudo RaNdom Generator) is quite fast, and features
implementations in C. There's even a version that takes advantage of
the hardware optimisations of certain CPUs. Let's try that.
</p>

<p>
We link our C++ code with the code from the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne
Twister implementation. It's very easy to do. The code provides the usual
functions for initialising the PRNG state and extracting random numbers in
32-bit/64-bit integer or floating point format.
</p>


<ul>
<li> <tt>init_gen_rand()</tt> initialises the generator with a seed value.</li>
<li> <tt>gen_rand32()</tt> and <tt>gen_rand64()</tt> return integer random numbers.</li>
<li> <tt>genrand_res53()</tt> provides a random number in floating point format (53 bits). The
     number is internally generated from integer random numbers.</li>
<li> <tt>fill_array32()</tt> and <tt>fill_array64()</tt> fill an array of 32-bit/64-bit integer values 
      with random data. These functions are well suited for the bulk creation of random numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The include file <tt>SFMT/SFMT.h</tt> in the sample code lists all
functions. When using <tt>fill_array32()</tt> or <tt>fill_array64()</tt>,
you have to be careful. If you use one of the <tt>gen_randXX()</tt>
functions before the <tt>fill_arrayXX()</tt> functions, you have to reseed
the PRNG state, or the code will abort with an exception. This is due to
the algorithm, but it took me one hour to spot the hint in the source code
comments.
</p>

<p>
The code can take advantage of the Streaming SIMD Extensions 2 (SSE2)
instruction set of modern CPUs. SIMD means <em>Single Instruction, Multiple
Data</em>, and its commands can use 128-bit registers that allow faster
vector operations. The SSE2 instructions are also very useful if you do
floating point arithmetic, since they handle the floating point data
differently than does the CPU's FPU. The Mersenne Twister uses vectors, so
SSE2 can speed up the internal computation. You just have to compile the
code with <tt>-DSSE2</tt> if your CPU has SSE2. (You can check this by
inspecting <tt>/proc/cpuinfo</tt>.) If you deal with SIMD code, be careful
to align your data structures properly. In SSE2 mode, all bitwise block
pointers must be 16-byte aligned to avoid crashes.  That's why we use
<tt>memalign()</tt> for allocating memory.
</p>

<p>
The Mersenne Twister algorithm can use different periods for its
pseudo-random numbers. Usually the period is given by the Mersenne exponent
(<tt>MEXP</tt> in the C source) based on a Mersenne prime number. The prime
is represented as 2<sup>MEXP</sup>-1. If you inspect the C source, you will
see a list of possible Mersenne primes. They can be chosen at compile time,
by setting <tt>MEXP</tt> accordingly.  (<tt>SFMT-params.h</tt> looks for
the symbol and includes the appropriate header file.)
</p>

<p>
Yes, clearly this is overkill, but, again, this is a nice opportunity to
create example code, in case you ever really need these features in other
projects.  </p>

<h2>
Recursively Populating
</h2>

<p>
The core of the C++ code is a single function that basically does the
same as does Ben's shell script.  The only parameters are the initial path
and the directory depth. The function calls itself recursively, when
entering a new subdirectory. It keeps track of the depth level, and
returns as soon as the limit is reached.

<pre class="code">
namespace fs = boost::filesystem;

void populate( fs::path path, unsigned int level ) {
    unsigned int i;
    unsigned int depth_level;
    string dirname;
    string fullpath;
    unsigned int nr_directories;
    unsigned int nr_files;
    unsigned int size;

    fullpath = path.root_directory() + path.relative_path().string();
    if ( opt_debug &gt; 0 ) {
        cout &lt;&lt; "DEBUG: Entering &lt;" &lt;&lt; fullpath.c_str() &lt;&lt; "&gt;" &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    if ( chdir( fullpath.c_str() ) != 0 ) {
        cerr &lt;&lt; "ERROR: Cannot chdir into directory &lt;" &lt;&lt; fullpath.c_str()
             &lt;&lt; "&gt; (" &lt;&lt; strerror(errno) &lt;&lt; ")" &lt;&lt; endl
             &lt;&lt; "ERROR: Level " &lt;&lt; level &lt;&lt; endl;
        return;
    }
 
    // Keep track of directory depth level
    depth_level = level+1;

    // Create files in current directory
    nr_files = (gen_rand32() % opt_number_files)+1;
    for ( i=1; i&lt;=nr_files; i++ ) {
        size = gen_rand32() % opt_max_filesize;
        if ( ! create_random_file( size, opt_max_namelength ) ) {
            cerr &lt;&lt; "ERROR: Cannot create file (" &lt;&lt; strerror(errno)
                 &lt;&lt; "). Aborting." &lt;&lt; endl;
            return;
        }
    }

    // Check for depth, we only create directories when not scratching the depth limit.
    if ( depth_level &lt; opt_dirlevels ) {
        // Create random number of directories
        nr_directories = (gen_rand32() % opt_number_directories)+1;
        for ( i=1; i&lt;=nr_directories; i++ ) {
            // Create name and directory
            dirname = create_random_string(opt_max_namelength);
            if ( mkdir( dirname.c_str(), S_IRWXU|S_IRWXG|S_IROTH|S_IXOTH ) != -1 ) {
                // Populate directory
                fs::path newpath = path / dirname;
                if ( opt_debug &gt; 0 ) {
                    cout &lt;&lt; "DEBUG: New path &lt;"
                         &lt;&lt; newpath.root_directory() + newpath.relative_path().string()
                         &lt;&lt; "&gt;" &lt;&lt; endl;
                }
                populate( newpath, depth_level );
                // Change to upper directory again. This is important since populate() chdirs into
                // a deeper directory and we can't climb up again if we don't do a second chdir()
                // after the function returns.
                if ( chdir( fullpath.c_str() ) != 0 ) {
                    cerr &lt;&lt; "ERROR: Cannot chdir into directory &lt;"
                         &lt;&lt; fullpath.c_str() &lt;&lt; "&gt; (" 
                         &lt;&lt; strerror(errno) &lt;&lt; ")" &lt;&lt; endl;
                }
            }
            else {
                cerr &lt;&lt; "ERROR: Cannot create directory (" &lt;&lt; strerror(errno) 
                     &lt;&lt; "). Aborting." &lt;&lt; endl;
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    return;
}
</pre>

<p>
You can find the full source along with a <tt>Makefile</tt> and the SFMT
code in a <a href="misc/pfeiffer/fspopulate.tar.gz"> downloadable
archive</a>. Please study the source, since I have only given the key ideas
on the code. The <tt>Makefile</tt> might need some tweaking, because I used
the latest Boost library (1.35 at the time of writing this article).  I
only used basic features, so you should be fine with older Boost libraries.
I added some variants for the <tt>CFLAGS</tt> and <tt>LDFLAGS</tt> to the
<tt>Makefile</tt>.  
</p>

<p>
Be careful about the limits when trying the code. Being too generous
results in <em>really large amounts</em> of data written to the filesystem.
Consider the directory limit. Ext3 has a subdirectory limit of 32768, so
it's probably not wise to test-drive the full range of the directory limit
option, unless you have some terabytes to spare.
</p>

<h2>
Notes
</h2>

<p>
Of course, the shell script is fine, and you really don't need SSE2 for
this task. But <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_is_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">TMTOWTDI</a>
isn't the privilege of Perl alone. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=";-)" /> 
</p>

<p>
And please test Ext4. It's a great filesystem, and it needs more feedback:
Without feedback and users, code cannot improve. Maybe
<tt>fspopulate</tt> can help you with testing.  </p>

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.
