<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3>Red Hat Releases Enterprise Linux 5.0</h3>

<p>
The new RHEL 5.0 release introduces Xen for virtualization, IPv6 support,
improved SELinux management tools, and a number of new services.  Red Hat
also includes a preview of a new encrypted file system, co-developed with
IBM.  
</p>

<p>
The new version of RHEL changes the user's license choices.  No more
conundrum between desktop, workstation, and server. There are now 2 base
classes: "Client" and "Server", each having license variations with
different degrees of virtual hosting.  There are 2 versions of server, where
the base server licence can only support up to 4 OS virtual guests, and the
advanced server license has no limitation on virtual guests.  Red Hat has
also developed technology to deliver software and updates to customers, even
in virtualized environments. Red Hat Network Satellite provides
capabilities to manage virtualized systems, including the ability to detect
and create Enterprise Linux-based guests and bring them into a managed
environment. RHEL subscribers now have the ability to manage dozens or
thousands of virtual systems as a single system.  
</p>

<p>Here is Red Hat's
technical review of its new Enterprise Linux 5:
<a href="http://www.press.redhat.com/2007/03/14/red-hat-enterprise-linux-5-technical-attributes/">http://www.press.redhat.com/2007/03/14/red-hat-enterprise-linux-5-technical-attributes/</a> .
</p>


<h3>Red Hat, Exadel Open Source Commercial Products under JBoss.org</h3>

<p>
At EclipseCon 2007, Red Hat and Exadel, a provider of rich application
components, announced a strategic partnership that will add mature,
Eclipse-based developer tools for building service-oriented architecture
(SOA) and rich, Web 2.0 applications to Red Hat's integrated platform,
including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and JBoss Enterprise Middleware. This
means that a mature, high-caliber set of Eclipse-based developer tools will
be available in open source. It also means that Red Hat is now supporting
Java Developers, following Sun's release of Java to open source.
</p>

<p>
Exadel Studio Pro provides an advanced Web development environment that
allows developers to work with multiple frameworks within a single
environment. RichFaces and Ajax4jsf offer powerful yet simple models for
building rich Internet and Web 2.0 applications, and supports JSF, Struts,
Hibernate, Spring, and many other platforms.
</p>

<p>
By combining Exadel's developer tools with JBoss Enterprise Middleware, Red
Hat offers a complete development and deployment platform that enables Java
programmers to assemble SOA components and Web 2.0 applications with
dramatically less coding, and reducing development and run-time errors.
</p>

<p>
RichFaces and Ajax4jsf are now available as JBoss RichFaces and JBoss
Ajax4jsf, respectively, on JBoss.org under the LGPL license. Red Hat is
currently working to open-source Exadel Studio Pro as Red Hat Developer
Studio under a GPL-based license. Availability for Red Hat Developer Studio
is planned for the first half of this year. For more information on the
projects, visit: <a href="http://www.jboss.org/">http://www.jboss.org/</a> .
</p>


<h3>Oracle Commits TopLink to JPA Open Source</h3>

<p>
Also at EclipseCon, Oracle announced that it was contributing its TopLink
database connectivity suite for Java to the Eclipse Foundation.  Besides
the code, Oracle announced the proposal of a new Eclipse project to deliver
a comprehensive persistence platform based on the contribution of Oracle
TopLink, a component of Oracle Fusion Middleware, source code, and test
cases.  
</p>

<p>
Oracle TopLink is an award-winning Java persistence framework
offering object-to-relational, object-to-XML, and Enterprise Information
System data access through all of the major standards, including the Java
Persistence API (JPA), Java API for XML Binding, Service Data Objects, and
the Java Connector Architecture.  (Whew... that's a lot of standards!)
Oracle TopLink works with any database, any application server, any
development toolset and process, and any Java application architecture.  In
addition to its code contribution, Oracle proposed a new Eclipse run-time
project to provide a set of persistence services that can be used in
Java and OSGi environments. Working closely with the Eclipse Foundation,
Eclipse member companies, and other contributors, Oracle will use the
existing code base of Oracle TopLink as the starting point for this
project. Through its participation in the OSGi Enterprise Expert Group,
Oracle will also work with the group members to create a set of blueprints
that define how OSGi applications can access standardized persistence
technologies.  
</p>

<p>
The Eclipse Persistence Platform project will be available
free of charge under the Eclipse Public License. For more information about
Oracle's development and contribution of open source solutions, visit:
<a href="http://otn.oracle.com/tech/eclipse/">http://otn.oracle.com/tech/eclipse/</a> .

<h3>Ian Murdock Joins Sun</h3>

<p>
Ian Murdock is leaving the Linux Foundation, and has joined Sun as the new
Chief Operating Platforms Officer. While Ian is not giving out too much
information yet about what he will be doing, we understand that he will be
responsible for building a strategy to evolve both Sun's Solaris and
GNU/Linux. 
</p>

<p>
As the founder of Debian, along with the work he has done as the
CTO of the Linux Foundation and the head of the Linux Standard Base, he
will bring a fresh perspective to Sun's OS strategy.  Ian wrote recently in
his blog: "The last several years have been hard for Sun, but the corner
has been turned. As an outsider, I've watched as Sun has successfully
embraced x86, pioneered energy efficiency as an essential computing
feature, open-sourced its software portfolio to maximize the network
effects, championed transparency in corporate communications, and so many
other great things. Now, I'm going to be a part of it."

<h3>GlassFish V2 Released</h3>

<p>
In other Sun news, Sun and the GlassFish community announced the beta
release of GlassFish V2, the next major version of the open source Java
EE 5 application server, and the release of the Sun Web Developer Pack, a
toolkit designed for simplifying and enabling advanced rich Internet
applications for the Java platform. These releases help enterprises build
and deploy SOA and Web 2.0 applications and services, leveraging 
next-generation Web technologies such as AJAX, scripting, and REST that 
simplify development and deployment of scalable, interactive applications.  
</p>

<p>
GlassFish V2 Beta adds all the enterprise features from Sun's Java System
Application Server Enterprise Edition, such as clustering, administration,
Web Services Interoperability Technology (WSIT), and load balancing to
support highly scalable, volume enterprise deployments for SOA and Web 2.0
applications.  Sun is also announcing creation of a Java Specification
Request (JSR) 311 (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311">http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311</a>), focused on
providing support for RESTful Web Services in the Java Platform, working
with other vendors such as BEA, Apache, Google, JBoss, TmaxSoft, and Jerome
Louvel (author of the Restlet project). This JSR will help further promote
standardization around next-generation Web technologies, and will aim to
provide an easy-to-use API for developers for Java EE or Java SE platforms.
</p> 


<h3>Microsoft Offers Source Code Access to FoxPro Extensions</h3>

<p>Yes, even Redmond is doing an open source jig, of a sort. The
venerable code base for FoxPro has not had a major update in a while,
and hasn't been much of a revenue source since... perhaps Windows 95.
However, there will be what Microsoft calls "shared source" for the
extensions to the FoxPro codebase called the Sedna Project.
</p>

<p>
There had been an overly optimistic report (Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols's
article at 
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2105307,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03129TX1K0000616">http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,2105307,00.asp?kc=EWRSS03129TX1K0000616</a>) that all of FoxPro would become open source, but that invoked a strong denial on the Microsoft
Developer Network Web site:
</p>

<p>
"To reiterate, today we are announcing that we are not planning on
releasing a VFP [Visual FoxPro] 10, and will be releasing the completed
Sedna work on CodePlex at no charge.  The components written as part of
Sedna will be placed in the community for further enhancement as part of
our shared source initiative. You can expect to see the Sedna code on
CodePlex, sometime before the end of summer 2007."
(<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vfoxpro/bb308952.aspx">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vfoxpro/bb308952.aspx</a>)
</p>

<p>
Sedna is about .Net and SQL server integration, and also MSbuild
integration, but not changes to the DB engine.  That code will remain
proprietary.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft hasn't specified which license will be used, but, in practice,
the term Microsoft Shared Source Initiative can include a bit of genuine
open source, along with some proprietary licences.
</p>

<p>
Too bad, because turning FoxPro, and xBase DBMSes in general, into an
open source project could lead to a renewal of the focused and fast
small apps that FoxPro and Clipper were famous for, in the late '80s.
</p>


<h3>Chip Wars Continue: AMD's Volley</h3>

<p>
In early December, AMD began showing off its true quad-core "Barcelona"
Opteron 8000 chip, which is expected to show a 40-70 performance gain over
its current Opteron dual-core performance.  The sample chip was shown
running in a 4-socket test system at the AMD Industry Analyst Forum, in
Berkeley, CA.  The test system was upgraded from 2-way chips to 4-way chips
in the same sockets (with a BIOS upgrade), as a proof of concept.  See the
demonstration at <a href="http://www.amd.com/quadcoredemo/">http://www.amd.com/quadcoredemo/</a> .
</p>

<p>
The "Barcelona" is initially aimed at multithreaded applications like
databases or guest operating systems, and will appear in systems supporting
up to 4 such chips, for an inexpensive 16-way server. It is also the first
65 nm chip AMD has produced.
</p>  

<p>
Unlike Intel's approach of first releasing a design with 2 dual cores in
the same case, the quad-core Opteron has faster internal data paths and
more shared cache memory. The future AMD 4-core chips will be called the
Opteron 8000 Series. Intel's quad chips include the Core 2 Extreme QX6700
for gamers, and the Xeon 5300 for servers.
</p>

<p>
AMD and IBM also announced a collaboration at the International Electron
Device Meeting last month, to build 45 nm chips by 2008. This development
makes use of immersion lithography using a transparent liquid to fill the
space between the projection lens and the wafer that contains hundreds of
microprocessors. This process provides increased depth of focus, and
improved image fidelity that can improve chip-level performance and
manufacturing efficiency.
</p> 

<p>
Intel is already experimenting with fabricating 45 nm chips, and has
finished designing its first 45 nm chips for release in 2008. Called the
'Penryn' family, these chips will also have 48 new media instructions.
Intel may beat AMD to market with the first 45 nm chips, but it is a
horse race.  AMD has quietly begun selling 2 new 65 nm chips with
performance and power consumption specs similar to that of Intel's
current high-end Xeon chips.   (Engineers at Sun tell <em>LG</em> that
the Intel Woodcrest family chips are very good at processing small and
medium data sets, while the AMD Opterons excel at moving large data sets
through the processors.)

<h3>France Gives Students the Gift of Open Source</h3>
<p>
The French National Assembly will open their next session on new Linux
computers.  These systems will probably be running Ubuntu or France's own
Linux distribution, Mandriva.  Beyond a switch to new Linux desktops for the
French government, other parts of the French government are currently using
the Apache Web server and the Mambo content management system.  Parisian
high school students will also be gifted with free software / open
source applications.  From a ComputerWorld report: 
</p>

<p>
"French authorities will give out 175,000 USB memory sticks loaded with
open-source software to Parisian high school students, at the start of the
next school year... The sticks will probably contain the Firefox 2 Web
browser, Thunderbird e-mail client, an office productivity suite such as
OpenOffice 2, an audio and video player, and software for instant
messaging.... "

<h3>OpenMake Announced the Release of Mojo 7.0 at EclipseCon</h3>

<p>
Mojo 7.0 is a free, community-oriented solution for automating
build-to-release tasks. This build-to-deploy automation solution is
complete, regardless of platform or development language
environment -- unlike other workflow tools designed to only support single
development environments, such as either Java or C.  Developers code,
maintain, manage, and orchestrate hundreds of make and Ant scripts, to
support their build-to-release process. In an effort to bring some order to
the chaos, they look to process-automation solutions that can sit on top of
these scripts, create a central place to execute the scripts in a precise
order, and log results. OpenMake's Mojo solution will provide 
enterprise-level process automation for managing the execution of ad hoc build,
testing, and deployment scripts. OpenMake's solution will interoperate with
other application life cycle tools through "Adaptors".  The Adaptors
provide "out of the box" integration with deployment tools for packaging,
testing tools for test script execution and SCM tools for check-in,

<h3>SC Magazine Selects Core Impact Penetration Tester for Its Security Lab</h3>

<p>
Core Impact, a leading penetration testing product for assessing
information security risks, earned a perfect score and received one of the
first Lab Approved awards from <a href="http://scmagazine.com/us/">SC Magazine</a>. In its group test of
vulnerability assessment products published in the January 2007 issue, 
<em>SC Magazine</em> recognized Core Impact for its comprehensive
capability in a production environment, performance, and ease of use.
</p>   

<p>
The <em>SC Magazine</em> Lab Approved distinction is awarded to extraordinary
products that fit into the SC Lab environment, and which will be used in
its test bench for the coming year. Core Impact received a perfect five
(out of five) stars across all categories of the evaluation, which included
Features, Ease of Use, Performance, Documentation, and Value for Money.
</p>

<p>
According to the review, penetration tools tend to be designed for very
skilled users. They often run from command lines, and run individual
exploits only. While this is adequate for a research laboratory, for
production testing of large networks, speed, accuracy, and repeatability are
critical. This is where Core Impact shines. Core Impact is developed by
Core Security Technologies.
</p>

<p>
This latest industry accolade joins a growing list of honors for Core
Impact, including <em>eWeek</em> Excellence Awards for Best
Vulnerability Assessment &amp; Remediation Solution, <em>SC
Magazine</em> Reader Trust Award for Best Security Audit Product, the
<em>Info Security Products Guide</em> Hot Companies 2006 Award, and the
company's recognition by leading analyst firm Gartner as a Cool Vendor
in Security and Privacy.

<h3>Compact Optical Buffer Tested in Silicon</h3>

<p>
Let there be light... in the Data Center.
</p>

<p>
In the premiere January issue of the scientific journal <a
href="http://www.nature.com/nphoton/index.html">Nature
Photonics</a>, an IBM team reports optical buffering of 10 bits of
information on a tiny part of a silicon chip.  This advance could allow
supercomputers to use fast optical interconnects and achieve better
performance.  
</p>

<p>
This demonstration is a major milestone in development of all-optical
buffers for system interconnects inside systems and between servers. To
avoid data congestion in a switching fabric today, multiple
electrical-to-optical (EO) and OE conversions are necessary to convert
optical signals and store the packets in memory, until the congestion is
resolved. Avoiding multiple EO/OE conversion would not only drive the
cost/performance down significantly, but also might result in better signal
integrity and lower overall power consumption.
</p>

<p>
One way to delay light is to pass it through optical fibers. However,
current "delay line" devices are too big to fit on a microchip. IBM control
the light signal by passing it through a new form of silicon-based optical
delay line, built of up to 100 cascaded "micro-ring resonators." With the
optical waveguide curved to form a ring, it forces light to circle multiple
times, delaying its travel. The resonators are built using current silicon
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication tools, and will
fit on a microchip.
</p>
  
<p>
This device can to store optical information for data streams as fast at
20 Gbps (gigabits per second). The device comprises up to 100
identical micro-ring resonators, all working in tune to produce
very large optical delays in excess of 500ps. Results represent at least a
factor of 10 improvement with respect to previous efforts.  Interestingly,
the actual demonstrated buffering capacity of 10 bits on a footprint of
0.03mm2 is only about 10 percent of a floppy disk's surface storage density.
</p> 

<p>
This is also an important technological advancement in the area of
nanophotonics. To create the experimental delay lines, significant efforts
were applied to design lossless coupling between the resonators, and to
control geometric parameters of all resonators to within just a few atomic
layers of silicon.

<h3>iRobot Unveils Ready-to-Roll Programmable Robot</h3>

<p>
iRobot Corp. has released iRobot Create, an affordable, programmable robot
designed for aspiring roboticists. Create comes pre-assembled, so
developers can design new robots without having to build a mobile robot
from scratch. The latest robot is available at <http://www.irobot.com>www.irobot.com</a> , and pricing
starts at US $129.99.
</p>

<p>
Create is based on the core technology of iRobot Roomba, the vacuuming
robot that is cleaning millions of homes worldwide, and is compatible with
Roomba's rechargeable batteries, remote control, and other accessories.
</p>

<p>
With Create, developers can now begin designing new robot applications, out
of the box. This new platform provides access to robot sensors and
actuators, via an open interface. Create also features standard connections
for electronics, and threaded mounting holes that allow users to secure
their inventions to the robot, streamlining additions such as sensors,
cameras, arms, and wireless connections.
</p>

<p>
A variety of methods and programming languages can be used to control
Create. Beginners can observe the robot's behavior in one of ten
demonstration modes, or they can program the robot directly by downloading
short scripts with any basic terminal program. More advanced users can
write programs for completely autonomous robot behavior in C or C++, using
the iRobot Command Module. Developers can also create custom software and
interact with Create using a variety of methods, including Microsoft
Robotics Studio, a Windows-based development toolkit.
</p> 

<p>
Helen Greiner, co-founder and chairman of iRobot says, "Innovators
dream of creating useful robots, but often get bogged down with designing a
mobile platform that works... iRobot Create fills a need in the robot
industry for a standard, durable hardware platform on which to rapidly
develop new, innovative mobile robots."
