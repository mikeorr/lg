As Kapil Hari Paranjape said, my main point was that "utf-8" is not 
a language name.  But unlike Kapil says, lang is a _language code; 
it has nothing to do with the encoding.

  lang = language-code [CI]
      This attribute specifies the <em>base_language</em> of an element's
      attribute values and text content.
 
  Language information specified via the lang attribute may be used
  by a user agent to control rendering in a variety of ways.

<p>
The base language of the Linux Gazette looks to be English.  So 
use "en".  If you want to be perfect, mark any snippets in other 
languages with the appropriate lang attribute.

I'm not sure who that "you" refers to, but - I did. Perhaps someone else
accidentally dropped the CC when following up, but assuming unkindness
where the reason is most likely a simple error is unwarranted. It also
implies that any errors that you make (such as this one) should be taken
as intentional unpleantness, and responded to in that manner.
</p>

<p>
You may want to reconsider that approach in the future. Meanwhile, I'll
respond in the same spirit.

Erm, no. Your main point, as expressed in your original email, was that
LG's setting of 'lang="utf-8"' somehow "made" your Firefox use an ugly
font. The actual problem appeared to be that your Firefox settings - and
perhaps your lack of a decent Unicode font - made your display ugly.
Kapil pointed out an error (or perhaps a misunderstanding) in your
statements; it's nice to hear that you agree with his explanation, but
claiming that it was your "main point" is just a little misleading.
</p>

Good luck with that imperative attitude that you seem to have developed;
I understand that treatment has recently become available, and is mostly
successful.

<p>
I leave chasing after perfection to fools who think that such a thing
exists. I'm always glad to take <em>useful</em> input on how LG can be made
better - but pet peeves don't interest me at all, and demands don't
impress me in the least.

Nevertheless the line "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=3Dutf-8" works
fairly well in mail clients regardless of the language the email was
written in. This is one of the big advantages of Unicode.

I experienced the same "problem" and Ben is right. Some default
installations lack suitable fonts. Depending on your system
(distribution, display hardware, rendering options, graphic card
settings, X server, and all the information we don't know about your
particular configuration) you may have to add matching fonts. I tried
doing this with my desktop and my laptop, it works fine.
</p>

<p>
You might also want to try enabling true type font support, this can
improve rendering in certain cases.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.
