<h1>Running XBoard in Irssi</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/creighton.html">Jason Creighton</A></b></p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>Recently, I have been playing chess on <a href=
"http://freechess.org">FICS</a>, a free service that uses the ICS
(Internet Chess Server) protocol. ICS is a telnet protocol, so you
can "telnet freechess.org 5000", login, and play with an ASCII
chess board if you want Here is what FICS output looks like: (I
made up most of this output as an example, but the actual output is
in the same format.)</p>

<!-- 20050227 Added the obs command and its output board to clarify what is meant by ASCII board,
and boy did I get lucky in the choice of games to observe to do it.  -->
<pre class="code">

<p>Now, you could play chess this way, if you don't mind using an
ASCII chess board and entering all your moves manually, but most
people use an interface program to provide them with a graphical
chess board. I use <a href=
"http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/xboard/">XBoard</a> for my
graphical interface, which 
<!-- 20050227 dsrich I think that Mr. Creighton had stdin and stdout reversed in the next two lines, so I swapped them -->
 provides a nice board, but it directly passes the ICS output to
stdin, and sends its stdout to the ICS. That is to say, you start
xboard in an xterm, and it's almost as if you'd used telnet to
connect except you have a graphical chess board. This isn't so bad,
except:</p>

<ul>
<li>The server will output a line while you are in the middle of
typing something, so that half of your message ends up on one line
and half on another This can be confusing and difficult to
use.</li>

<li>Those <tt>fics%</tt> prompts waste a lot of space. (Up to half
of the lines on the terminal.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>Enter <a href="http://www.irssi.org/">Irssi</a>.</p>

<p>Irssi is the IRC client I use. Well, it's mostly an IRC client.
There are modules for other protocols, such as ICQ.</p>

<p>I thought I could run XBoard in an Irssi window, filter out the
prompts, and have more fun. It's possible, you just have to tweak
things a little.</p>

<h3>Configuring FICS</h3>

<p>One problem with playing on FICS this way is that FICS will send a bell
(i. e., the ASCII BEL character) when the board is updated, letting you
know it's your move. However, they are sent without a newline, and since
Irssi's exec module will only print complete lines, you don't hear the bell
until the next newline, which could be with, for example, a chat message,
which will come an indeterminate amount of time after the BEL is sent. So
it's best to turn off bells on the FICS side with this command:</p>

<pre>
set bell off
</pre>

<p>This tells FICS not to send BEL characters on every board
update.</p>

<h3>Configuring XBoard</h3>

<p>Having turned off server-side alerts, you probably want to hear
some sort of sound when the opponent moves, but since just ringing
the terminal bell won't work, you'll have to use a sound file. Here
are my settings for XBoard in my .Xresources file:</p>

<pre class="code">
# xboard options
XBoard*showCoords: True
XBoard*highlightLastMove: True
XBoard*colorizeMessages: True

# Sounds
XBoard*ringBellAfterMoves: True
XBoard*soundMove:       /home/jason/sounds/fanfare.wav
XBoard*soundChallenge:  /home/jason/sounds/bridge2.wav
XBoard*soundRequest:    /home/jason/sounds/bridge2.wav

# ICS-related
XBoard*internetChessServerHost: freechess.org
XBoard*internetChessServerHelper: timeseal
XBoard*internetChessServerLogonScript: /home/jason/chess/.logon-script-freechess.org
</pre>

<p>The above configuration (among other things) sets "fanfare.wav"
to be played when the opponent moves and "bridge2.wav" to be played
on either a "Challenge" (When you're challenged on ICS) or a
"Request" (A request for something: draw, abort, adjourn, takeback,
etc.) Note that, in order for XBoard to heed "soundMove",
"ringBellAfterMoves" must be on.</p>

<p>Your configuration will differ, of course, and XBoard has scads
of options, so please refer to the 'xboard' man page for a full list
of supported sound events. (Among other things.)</p>

<p>When giving the names of sound files, you can also specify "$"
as a filename to have XBoard emit a BEL character for that event.
This is, of course, totally useless for the "soundMove" event for
reasons discussed earlier, but every other event that XBoard sees
involves something being printed, and thus Irssi will see the BEL
in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Note that, in order for the ICS-related sound events to work,
you must have 'colorizeMessages' enabled.</p>

<p>If you don't have some handy sound bites laying around, google
for "free sound files". Just be careful not to spend too much time
searching for suitable sounds, browsing site after site, staying up
all night, with your skeletal frame leaning limply against your
chair, the flickering light of your monitor casting a pale glow on
your bloodshot eyes, your mailbox overflowing as your quest causes
you to totally withdraw from society, becoming a sad, pathetic
little vegetable whose only joy in life is finding those perfect
sounds for every possible event.</p>

<p>Well, probably not, but you can spend a lot of time on it.
:-)</p>

<h3>Configuring Irssi</h3>

<p>Irssi doesn't really require much tweaking. If you have XBoard
beeping (i. e., you've specified "$" for one or more of XBoard's
sounds), you'll want to "/set bell_beeps on" in order to have Irssi
not ignore any BEL characters it sees. This is the alias I use:</p>

<!-- 20050227 dsrich Broke this single-line PRE block into multiple lines to fit my screen. -->
<pre>
/alias xboard window new hide; window name xboard; exec -name xboard -window -interactive \
xboard -ics -sgf ~/chess/fics.pgn | sed --unbuffered 's/^fics% //\;T\;/^\$/d'
</pre>

<p>Note that, in the alias, we have to quote ";" and "$", because those
characters have special importance to Irssi. XBoard is started in ICS mode,
appending any games played to <code>~/chess/fics.pgn</code>. The 'sed'
command (which filters out the FICS prompt) is a little more complex, so
I'll take the easy way out and not attempt to explain it in detail. The
irrepressibly curious can refer to the 'sed' man page.</p>

<p>And that's all there is to it. You could, of course, use a
different ICS interface such as <a href=
"http://eboard.sourceforge.net/">eboard</a>, but I prefer XBoard,
and this configuration works for me.</p>

<p>I have used "FICS" to refer to the chess server throughout this
article because that's what I use, but this should work with most
any ICS, provided you modify the 'sed' incantation appropriately.</p>
