<FONT SIZE=3>The Linux Professional Institute(LPI) has been very
busy. With the help of volunteers from around the world, an advisory
council which includes individuals from the top Linux related
companies, and sponsors which help promote their agenda, LPI is
poised for global recognition. Since it's inception two years ago,
the mission has been simple and straightforward; to deliver &quot;a
standardized, multi-national, and respected program to certify levels
of individual expertise in Linux&quot;.</FONT></P>
<P>
<BR>
</P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>In less than two short years, the dream has become a
reality for the founders of LPI. With a Linux Professional Institute
Certification(LPIC) now positioned to become the de-facto
certification worldwide, the hard work and sponsorships are having
their desired effect. Much work must yet be done; volunteers and
sponsors are always needed; as the non-profit organization plans to
make their certification available to anyone around the world.</FONT></P>

their web site </SPAN><A HREF="http://www.lpi.org/">http://www.lpi.org/</A></FONT></SPAN></SPAN>
has been translated into Japanese and German, with French and Chinese
to closely follow. Other languages are in the process of being added,
with many volunteers assisting in the endeavor. Anyone wanting to
volunteer to help the translation team is asked to contact Duane
Dunstan by e-mailing him at <A HREF="mailto:pdunstan@pfeiffer.edu">pdunstan@pfeiffer.edu</A>.
An LPI-Japan has been established with directors from Turbolinux
Japan, IBM Japan, Linuxcare, and assistance from Fujitsu, Hitachi,
NEC, Keio University and others. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The organization has been
contacted by interested parties to create an LPI Greater China, with
an Official Office in Hong Kong and Representative Offices in China
and Taiwan. Invitations have been extended to attend and speak at the
upcoming IDG shows in Beijing, China(Aug. 29-Sept.1); with Jon Maddog
Hall representing LPI; Taipei, China(Sept.7-9), and Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia(Nov. 7-9); with Dan York speaking on certification.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A book has been written;
specifically for the LPIC Exam 101; by the publishing giant
MacMillan. IBM has embraced the LPIC, making it a technical
prerequisite for their own &quot;Solution Technologist&quot;
e-business certification. According to Dan York; president of the LPI
board of directors; &quot;This relationship with IBM provides a path
for those professionals to further develop and validate their
skills&quot;. IBM's Scott Handy declares that &quot;Linux plays a
critical role in today's world of e-business. Ensuring our partners
have a strong, consistent knowledge of the Linux operating system,
... is critical to us, our partners and our customers.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A search for &quot;Linux
certification&quot; under Yahoo; <A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/</A>
; yields LPI and Lintraining. Anyone interested in Linux
certification should visit both websites for information on testing
centers, training materials, instructors or trainers. To visit LPI's
preparation web site, go to <A HREF="http://www.lpi.org/c-preperation.html">http://www.lpi.org/c-preperation.html</A>.
There are currently 361 locations around the globe offering linux
training. For a comprehensive list, go to <A HREF="http://www.lintraining.com/">http://www.lintraining.com</A>.

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The first web based LPIC
Level One course has been started through CyberState University. The
cost for the course is currently set at $995 and qualifies the
student to take the Level One exam from LPI. The V.P. of Curriculum
Development for CyberState University; David Clarke; states
&quot;CyberStateU.com's approach...is unique...it integrates a
real-world hands-on lab environment rather than a simulated
environment. Real world experience is a critical success factor in
passing LPI's rigorous exams&quot;.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Some of the events which
the LPI has participated in since January of this year, have included
the countries of France, Germany, Australia, England, Canada, the
United States and Japan. Upcoming events this year, will be in China,
Malaysia, New Zealand and the United States(Atlanta:Sept.26-28/Linux
Business Expo, and Las Vegas:Nov.13-17/Comdex). 
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">With a furry somewhat
like that of a wildfire out of control, LPI has gone from infancy to
a global organization in relatively short time. LPI encourages
participation and public involvement through its mailing lists and
web site. A Japanese translation of the web site is available at
<A HREF="http://www.yesitis.co.jp/LPI/">http://www.yesitis.co.jp/LPI/</A>.

center, visit the Virtual University Enterprise at

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For Linux enthusiasts,
there is finally a platform for advancing their knowledge and
abilities. It now appears that Linux is here to stay, and for the
Linux Professional Institute, their future looks long and brite. For
a grass roots effort to come so far in such a short time, shows the
true value of a world wide community working together. Stay tune and
look for a lot more from this organization.</P>
