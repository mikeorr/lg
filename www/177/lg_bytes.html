<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Rackspace and NASA Open Source Cloud Platform</h3>

<p>In July, Rackspace Hosting announced the launch of OpenStack, an 
open-source cloud platform designed to foster the emergence of 
technology standards and cloud interoperability. Rackspace is donating 
the code that powers its Cloud Files and Cloud Servers public-cloud 
offerings to the OpenStack project. </p>

<p>The project will also incorporate technology that powers the NASA 
Nebula Cloud Platform. </p>
<p>Rackspace and NASA plan to actively collaborate on joint technology 
development and leverage the efforts of open-source software 
developers worldwide.</p>

<p>"We are founding the OpenStack initiative to help drive industry 
standards, prevent vendor lock-in and generally increase the velocity 
of innovation in cloud technologies," said Lew Moorman, President, 
Cloud and CSO at Rackspace. "We are proud to have NASA's support in 
this effort.  Its Nebula Cloud Platform is a tremendous boost to the 
OpenStack community. We expect ongoing collaboration with NASA and the 
rest of the community to drive more-rapid cloud adoption and 
innovation, in the private and public spheres."</p>

<p>A fully distributed object store based on Rackspace Cloud Files is now 
at OpenStack.org.  The next component planned for release is a 
scalable compute-provisioning engine based on the NASA Nebula cloud 
technology and Rackspace Cloud Servers technology. It is expected to 
be available later this year.  Using these components, organizations 
would be able to turn physical hardware into scalable and extensible 
cloud environments using the same code currently in production serving 
tens of thousands of customers and large government projects.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Marvell Open-sources Easy Plug Computer Installer</h3>

<p>Marvell announced the availability of the open source Easy 
Plug-Computer Installer (EPI) to simplify Plug Computing software 
deployment. EPI is a wizard-based installation tool for Marvell's Plug 
Computer design, providing Plug Computer developers with a faster way 
to build their low-power Plug Computing solutions.  Plug Computers are 
headless servers with open source HW and SW specifications.  Some of 
the common parts are used in mobile phones and run at very low power.</p>

<p>The award-winning Plug Computer design makes always on, green 
computing readily available for developers and end-users. Plug 
Computers feature a 2 GHz Marvell ARMADA 300 processor, and optional 
built-in hard-disk drive and embedded Marvell Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 
technologies. The enclosure can be just a few cubic inches with an 
ethernet port and a USB port.  Additional peripherals such as Direct 
Attached Storage (DAS) can be connected using the USB 2.0 port. 
Multiple standard Linux 2.6 kernel distributions are supported on the 
Plug Computer development platform. The enclosure plugs directly into 
a standard wall socket and draws less than one tenth of the power of a 
typical PC being used as a home server. For more information, please 
visit <a href="http://www.plugcomputer.org">http://www.plugcomputer.org</a>.</p>

<p>Bob Salem, director of marketing at Marvell, told Linux Gazette that 
"... its a bit tedious to reprogram the plug. Our new EP installer 
makes this simpler and faster.  There is no jtag, no set up. EPI 
allows our partners to remotely upgrade their hardware in the field."</p>

<p>"Marvell wants to encourage more developers to explore Plug Computing 
and the high performance, eco-friendly open source computing 
platform,"said Viren Shah, Senior Director of Marketing Embedded 
Systems at Marvell's Enterprise Business Unit.</p>

<p>Examples of Plug Computers currently available for purchase at $89-$99 
are Cloud Engines' PogoPlug, Axentra's HipServ for PlugTop Computing, 
and the TonidoPlug low-power, personal server and NAS device which 
uses embedded Ubuntu 9.04 Linux.</p>

<p>EPI can be used to install Linux distributions, file systems, file 
system images or single applications. The application provides USB key 
and HTTP-based list retrieval, further expanding the ways in which 
developers can access and update Plug Computers. Developers also will 
have access to step-by-step instructions for successful deployment, 
along with access to new developments put forth by the Plug Computing 
community. The EPI is compatible with Fedora 11, Ubuntu 9.04, Windows 
XP SP2/3, and Mac OSX (Leopard).</p>

<p>The Easy Plug-Computer Installer and Marvell Plug Computers were on 
display at the OSCON 2010 tradeshow in Portland, Oregon in July.  EPI 
and supporting information is currently available for download at 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/esia/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/esia/</a>.</p>

<p>Marvell will host first meeting  of the new devleoper community at the 
Plugin Developer Day at their Santa Clara headquarters on Aug 18. </p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">MeeGo Platform Chosen by the GENIVI Alliance</h3>
<p>The Linux Foundation announced that GENIVI, an auto-alliance driving 
the adoption of In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI), will adopt MeeGo as the 
standard for IVI in vehicles manufactured by car companies like BMW 
and General Motors. It had voiced support for MeeGo before but is now 
officially using it for its next IVI reference release (called 
Apollo). </p>

<p>MeeGo is an open source platform hosted by the Linux Foundation that 
brings together Intel and Nokia's previous mobile projects for 
computing devices such as smartphones, netbooks, tablets, mediaphones, 
connected TVs and IVI systems. MeeGo's platform contains a Linux base, 
middleware, and an interface layer that powers these rich 
applications.</p>

<p>IVI is a rapidly evolving field that encompasses the digital 
applications that can be used by all occupants of a vehicle, including 
navigation, entertainment, location-based services, and connectivity 
to devices, car networks and broadband networks. MeeGo will provide 
the base for the upcoming GENIVI Apollo release that will be used by 
members to reduce time to market and the cost of IVI development.</p>

<p>"We selected MeeGo as the open source basis for our platform because 
it is technically innovative and can provide the cross architecture 
build support we require for our references," said Graham Smethurst, 
President of GENIVI. "Working with MeeGo we expect to establish a 
solution that effectively merges IVI needs with those of the other 
MeeGo target device categories."</p>

<p>GENIVI is a nonprofit industry alliance with founding members BMW 
Group, Wind River, Intel, GM, PSA, Delphi, Magneti-Marelli, and 
Visteon.</p>

<p>An initial release of the MeeGo platform is available now from 
<a href="http://www.meego.com/downloads">http://www.meego.com/downloads</a>. The MeeGo project encourages all 
automakers or industry groups to participate in the MeeGo project or 
make use of its software to power their own distributions.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">OpenDocument 1.2 available for review for 60 days</h3>

<p>The complete draft of version 1.2 of the OpenDocument (ODF) standard 
was made publicly available in early July. Developers, potential users 
and others are invited to submit their comments on the draft before 
the 6th of September. Before the end of the fourth quarter of 2010, 
the members of the OASIS working group lead by Rob Weir, followed by 
the entire OASIS (Organisation for the Advancement of Structured 
Information Standards) membership, will vote then on whether to adopt 
the draft as an official OASIS standard.</p>

<p>If approved, the standard will then be presented to the ISO 
(International Standardisation Organisation) to be ratified as the 
current version of the ISO 26300 standard. OASIS is in charge of 
maintaining this standard, which will  promote the exchange of 
documents between different office suites.</p>

<p>Version 1.2 of the ODF has been particularly improved in terms of 
mathematical formulae.  According to a blog post by Rob Weir, the use 
of OpenFormula is not just designed to be used as a part of ODF, but 
also as a stand-alone syntax for other applications such as a separate 
equation parser.</p>

<p>Microsoft in particular had repeatedly criticised the previously only 
rudimentary definition of mathematical formulae in ODF spreadsheets as 
an interoperability flaw of the OpenDocument standard. The competing 
OOXML standard, driven by MS, describes every mathematical function 
that may appear as part of a formula in an Excel spreadsheet cell in 
great detail - which is one of the reasons why the Microsoft standard 
in turn has been heavily criticised for its more than 6,000 printed 
pages. The ODF 1.2 specification including OpenFormula comprises 1,100 
pages.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2 Integrates Server and Desktop</h3>

<p>From the RED HAT SUMMIT & JBOSS WORLD in June, Red Hat announced the 
general availability of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2. In 
addition to providing the first release of Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization for Desktops, the 2.2 update includes new scalability 
capabilities, migration tools and features to expand the performance 
and security of the solution.</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.1, which introduced Red Hat 
Enterprise Virtualization for Servers, was released in November 2009. 
Designed as a foundation for the virtualization of Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux and Microsoft Windows, with Microsoft SVVP certification, as 
well as for cloud computing environments, Red Hat Enterprise 
Virtualization has gained momentum with customers, including Fujitsu, 
IBM and NTT Communications, for their cloud deployments. </p>

<p>"As enterprises look to move beyond initial server consolidation to a 
more pervasive datacenter-wide virtualization strategy, they are 
looking to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization to provide leading 
scalability and economics," said Navin Thadani, senior director, 
Virtualization Business at Red Hat. "Already experiencing traction 
with server and cloud deployments, the solution expands its reach 
today with the delivery of our desktop virtualization management 
capabilities to help more customers to break down the barriers to 
virtualization adoption."</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for Desktops, introduced in today's 
2.2 update, allows customers to deploy Hosted Virtual Desktop (HVD) 
configurations, also known as Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), 
bringing scalable, centralized provisioning and management of their 
desktop systems. It provides a web-based connection broker that allows 
end users to access their hosted virtual desktops, coupled with the 
open source SPICE remote rendering technology, which offers a rich 
multimedia experience, including multiple monitors, HD-quality video 
and bi-directional audio/video for video conferences. Other features, 
such as templating, thin provisioning and desktop pooling, are also 
included. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization for Desktops supports 
Microsoft Windows XP, Windows 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Desktop.</p>

<p>With the 2.2 release, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization also features 
industry-leading scalability, supporting guests with up to 16 virtual 
CPUs and 256 gigabytes of memory per virtual machine. The release 
additionally provides new virtual machine conversion capabilities 
through a V2V tool designed to automate the conversion of VMware or 
Xen virtual machines for use within Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization. 
To further simplify moving virtual machine images between 
environments, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2 also includes the 
ability to import and export virtual machine images and templates with 
the Open Virtualization Format (OVF).</p>

<p>"With today's announcement of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2, 
customers can utilize the Cisco Unified Computing System and the 
Virtual Interface Card to drive virtualization efficiency through 
Cisco's extended memory and I/O virtualization technology," said Ed 
Bugnion, vice president and chief technology officer for Cisco's 
Server Access & Virtualization Business Unit. "We look forward to 
continued collaboration with Red Hat to offer our customers more 
choices, allowing them to take advantage of virtualization in their 
datacenter infrastructures."</p>

<p>"This release of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization is a major 
milestone toward establishing KVM as a world-class open source 
hypervisor," said Bob Sutor, vice-president of Linux and Open Source 
at IBM. </p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 2.2 is globally available today. To 
learn more about Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, visit

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">openSUSE 11.3 is Out</h3>

<p>The openSUSE Project has announced the release of the openSUSE 11.3, 
with support for 32-bit and 64-bit systems. openSUSE 11.3 has new 
features and updates including SpiderOak to sync files across the 
Internet for free, Rosegarden for free editing audio files, improved 
indexing with Tracker, and updates to Mozilla Firefox, and 
Thunderbird.</p>

<p>Among these new features, openSUSE also provides support for netbooks 
and the Btrfs file system. Users can expect to see improved hardware 
support with the 2.6.34 Linux kernel and updated graphics drivers. And 
there is support for the next generation of interactive touchscreens 
like the HP TouchSmart.</p>

<p>openSUSE continues to deliver the popular KDE, GNOME and Xfce desktop 
environments, and now also provides the lightweight LXDE desktop 
environment. GNOME uses the 2.30.1 version and a preview of the 
upcoming GNOME 3.0. Or choose to use KDE SC 4.4.4.</p>

<p>The openSUSE community also announced the availability of openSUSE 
Edu: Linux for Education (or Li-f-e). Li-f-e is built on openSUSE 11.3 
but also provides education and development resources for parents, 
students, teachers as well as IT admins running labs at educational 
institutions. It comes bundled educational software covering subjects 
such as IT, mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, electronics, etc.</p>

<p>The next release will be openSUSE 11.4 in March, 2011.</p>

 
 
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM Announces Open Beta Program AIX 7</h3>

<p>IBM has announced an open beta program for AIX 7, the company's open 
standards-based UNIX operating system. AIX 7 builds on the 
capabilities of previous releases of AIX and can use the energy 
management capabilities of the new POWER7 servers.</p>

<p>AIX 7 provides full binary compatibility for programs created on 
earlier versions of AIX including AIX 6, AIX 5, and 32-bit programs 
created on even earlier versions of AIX. This means that clients can 
protect previous investments in Power Systems by moving existing 
applications up to AIX 7 without having to recompile them. AIX 7 will 
also be supported on systems based on earlier generations of 
processors including POWER6, POWER5, and POWER4.</p>

<p>Many clients running prior generations of POWER hardware would like to 
consolidate on newer, more efficient POWER7 servers, but simply do not 
have the administrative resources to upgrade a large number of 
servers. AIX 7 introduces new technology to help simplify 
consolidation of these older workloads onto new systems. Clients can 
back up an existing AIX 5.2 environment and restore it inside of a 
Workload Partition on AIX 7, which can allow them to quickly take 
advantage of the advances in POWER technology.</p>

<p>Some of the key features of AIX 7 include:</p>

<p> * New support for very large workloads with up to 256 cores/1024 
 threads in a single AIX logical partition - four times greater than 
 that of AIX 6;<br />
 * Built-in clustering to simplify configuration and management of 
 multiple AIX systems for high availability;<br />
 * Simplified AIX configuration management for pools of AIX systems.</p>

<p>"The planned release of AIX 7 underscores the IBM commitment to 
continued UNIX innovation. ...Building on the success of AIX 6's open 
beta that helped hundreds of ISV's deliver certified applications at 
general availability, our AIX 7 open beta will help deliver smarter 
applications as well." said Jeff Howard, director of marketing for IBM 
Power Systems.</p>

<p>The beta program is open to all, and is designed to provide clients 
and independent software vendors (ISVs) with early access to the AIX 7 
operating system. Clients and other interested parties can participate 
in the beta by visiting ibm.com/aix and following the links to the 
open beta Web page at 
<a href="http://www14.software.ibm.com/iwm/web/cc/earlyprograms/websphere/aix7ob/">http://www14.software.ibm.com/iwm/web/cc/earlyprograms/websphere/aix7ob/</a>.
The beta code is packaged as a DVD ISO image that beta 
participants can burn to physical media.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Mozilla releases first Firefox 4 beta</h3>

<p>The Mozilla development team has released the first beta for version 
4.0 of the Firefox web browser.  Changes include better HTML 5 support 
and UI improvements.</p>

<p>According to Firefox development director Mike Beltzner, this beta is 
aimed at providing "an early look at what's planned" for the browser 
update. Firefox 4 will be the next major release of Mozilla's popular 
open source browser and will include a number of improvements, updates 
and new features.</p>

<p>Firefox 4 Beta 1 is based on version 2.0 of the Gecko rendering 
platform - the Firefox 3.6 branch uses Gecko 1.9.2 - and features a 
new Add-ons Manager and extension management API, and a number of 
Windows only changes, such as a new default 'tabs on top' layout for 
Windows systems. Mac OS X and Linux systems will receive the new tabs 
on top layout in a future update "when the theme has been modified to 
support the change". Other Windows improvements include a new Firefox 
Button on Vista and Windows 7 systems, replacing the menu bar, and an 
experimental Direct2D rendering back end - currently disabled by 
default.</p>

<p>Other changes include API improvements for JS-ctypes, a new HTML5 
parser, more responsive page rendering, support for additional HTML5 
form controls and partial support for CSS Transitions. User interface 
(UI) updates include a new default Bookmarks Button that replaces the 
Bookmarks Toolbar and a new single button for stop and reload. Native 
support for the HD HTML5 WebM / VP8 video format and full support for 
WebGL - a JavaScript binding to OpenGL ES 2.0 with industry support 
from Google, Mozilla and Opera - (currently disabled by default) have 
also been added.</p>

<p>Originally introduced in Firefox 3.6.4, version 4.0 includes enhanced 
crash protection technology from the Mozilla Lorentz Project. This is 
aimed at bringing full process isolation to Firefox, separating web 
pages and plug-ins from the main browser by running them in their own 
processes. Crash protection is now supported on Windows, Mac OS X and 
Linux, and currently protects the browser against crashes in the Adobe 
Flash, Apple QuickTime or Microsoft Silverlight plug-ins.</p>

<p>Beltzner notes that the developers plan to release a new beta version 
"every two to three weeks". A first release candidate (RC) for Firefox 
4 is currentlyscheduled to arrive in October of this year. A final 
release date, however, has yet to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Firefox 4.0 Beta 1 is available to download for Windows, Mac OS X and 
Linux. The latest stable release of Firefox is version 3.6.6 from the 
end of June.</p>

<p>Firefox binaries are released under the Mozilla Firefox End-User 
Software License Agreement and the source code is released under 
disjunctive tri-licensing that includes the Mozilla Public Licence, 
GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Apache Announces Tomcat Version 7.0</h3>
  
<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) announced Version 7.0 release of 
Apache Tomcat, the award winning Open Source Java Application Web 
server. One of the ASF's earliest projects, the Tomcat code base was 
first donated to the ASF in 1999; the first Apache release, v.3.0, was 
made later that year. Apache Tomcat 7 is the project's first major 
release since 2006, fully implementing the Java Servlet 3.0, 
JavaServer Pages (JSP) 2.2, and Expression Language (EL) 2.2 
specifications for easier Web framework integration.</p>
 
<p>Tomcat 7 provides out-of-the-box support for development features that 
would otherwise be coded manually.  Apache Tomcat is shepherded by 
dozens of volunteers who contribute updates to its code base; its 
day-to-day operations, including community development and product 
releases, are overseen by a Project Management Committee.</p>
 
<p>With more than 10 million downloads to date, Apache Tomcat powers a 
broad range of mission-critical Websites and applications across 
multiple industries and use cases, from Fortune 500 conglomerates to 
service providers to eCommerce systems.</p>
  
<p>"I am delighted to see this first release of Apache Tomcat 7. Tomcat 
has always been the most popular deployment platform for Spring-based 
applications and this new release adds some great production 
technology," says Rod Johnson, general manager of the SpringSource 
division of VMware. "Tomcat's small footprint and reliable execution 
make it the ideal choice for the runtime component of SpringSource's 
tc Server. These features are also proving particularly important as 
organizations move their workloads to the cloud."</p>
 
<p>Developers using Tomcat 7 will also benefit from improved memory leak 
detection and prevention and support for 'aliasing' directories into 
an application's URL space. All known bugs reported in previous 
versions of Tomcat have been fixed in v.7.0.</p>
 
<p>Tomcat versions 5.5.x and 6.0.x will continue to be supported, 
however, bug fixes or updates to possible security vulnerabilities in 
earlier versions may be slightly delayed.</p>
 
<p>Tomcat 7 is released under the Apache Software License v2.0. 
Downloads, documentation, and related resources are available at 
<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">http://tomcat.apache.org/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Suricata: Free intrusion detection & prevention engine</h3>

<p>The Open Information Security Foundation(OISF) has released version 
1.0 of its open source intrusion detection and prevention engine - 
Suricata.  Unlike Snort, another popular open source network intrusion 
prevention and detection system, Suricata runs multi-threaded and 
offers a number of advanced configuration options.</p>

<p>This first stable release includes a number of improvements and new 
features over the previous development releases, such as support for 
DCERPC (Distributed Computing Environment / Remote Procedure Calls) 
over UDP and the tag keyword. Additionally, CUDA (for Compute Unified 
Device Architecture) issues were fixed and it's performance was 
improved.</p>

<p>The OISF is funded by several US agencies, such as the Department of 
Homeland Security's Directorate for Science and Technology HOST 
program (Homeland Open Security Technology) and various members of the 
OISF Consortium, including a number of specialist IT security 
companies.</p>

<p>Suricata 1.0 source is available to download from the foundation's web 
site and is licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License 
(GPLv2). The sourc courd can be used for
Linux/FreeBSD/UNIX, Mac, and Windows platvorms.</p>
