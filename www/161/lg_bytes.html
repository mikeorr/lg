<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IDC: IT Turning to Linux in Economic Downturn</h3>

<p>A recent market survey conducted by IDC (and sponsored by Novell)
reveals a surge in the acquisition of Linux as the worldwide recession
deepens. More than half of the IT executives surveyed will accelerate
Linux adoption in 2009. Specifically, more than 72 percent of
respondents say they are either actively evaluating or have already
decided to increase their adoption of Linux on the server in 2009,
with more than 68 percent making the same claim for the desktop.</p>

<p>The study surveyed more than 300 senior IT executives spanning
manufacturing, financial services, and retail industries across the
globe, as well as government agencies. The number one motivation
executives gave for migrating to Linux was economic and related to 
lowering ongoing support costs. </p>

<p>"The feedback gleaned from this market survey confirms our belief
that, as organizations fight to cut costs and find value in this tough
economic climate, Linux adoption will accelerate," said Markus Rex,
general manager and senior vice president for Open Platform Solutions
at Novell. "Companies also told us that strengthening Linux
application support, interoperability, virtualization capabilities and
technical support will all fuel adoption even more."</p>

<p>Additional key survey findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>67 percent of respondents stated that interoperability and
manageability between Linux and Windows is one of the most important
factors when choosing an operating system.
<li>The retail industry showed the greatest potential for
acceleration in Linux adoption with 63 percent of respondents planning
an increase on the desktop and 69 percent considering the same on the
server. The government sector lagged.
<li>Almost 50 percent of respondents plan to accelerate adoption of
Linux on the desktop, especially for basic office functions, technical
workstation users, and higher education/K-12.
<li>Nearly half of respondents stated that moving to virtualization
is accelerating their adoption of Linux. Eighty-eight percent of
recipients plan to evaluate, deploy or increase their use of
virtualization software within Linux operating systems over the next
12-24 months.
<li>From a regional perspective, Asia/Pacific is the most bullish on
increasing Linux adoption, as 73 percent of respondents said they
would increase deployments on the server and 70 percent on the
desktop. In the Americas, 66 percent of respondents said they are
either evaluating or have already decided to increase adoption of
Linux on the desktop and 67 percent on the server.
<li>The economic crisis has had the biggest effect on the Americas,
and in financial services and government. More than 62 percent of
respondents said that their budget has been cut or that they are only
investing where needed.
</ul>

<p>The research conducted in February 2009 showed 55 percent of
respondents had Linux server operating systems in use, 39 percent had
Unix server operating systems in use, and 97 percent had Windows
server operating systems in use. Respondents were pre-screened via
demographics screeners and completed the survey online. Novell was not
involved in recruiting, and respondents did not need to be Novell
customers.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Microsystems Unveils Open Cloud Platform</h3>
<p>At its CommunityOne developer event in mid-March, Sun Microsystems
showcased its Sun Open Cloud Platform.  Sun previewed plans to launch
the Sun Cloud, its first public cloud service targeted at developers
and startups, and to provide public APIs.</p>

<p>Sun is opening its cloud APIs for public review and comment, so that
others building public and private clouds can easily design them for
compatibility with the Sun Cloud. Sun's Cloud API specifications are
published under the Creative Commons license, which essentially allows
anyone to use them in any way. Developers will be able to deploy
applications to the Sun Cloud immediately, by leveraging pre-packaged
VMIs (virtual machine images) of Sun's open source software,
eliminating the need to download, install and configure infrastructure
software. To participate in the discussion and development of Sun's
Cloud APIs, go to <a href="http://sun.com/cloud">http://sun.com/cloud</a>.</p>

<p>At the core of the Sun Cloud will be the first two services - Sun
Cloud Storage Service and Sun Cloud Compute Service - which will be
available this summer. Customers will be able to take advantage of the
combined benefits of open source and cloud computing via the Sun Cloud
to accelerate the delivery of new applications, reducing overall risk
and quickly scaling compute and storage capacity up and down to meet
demand. Sun is leveraging its extensive portfolio of products,
unparalleled world-class professional services and extensive expertise
in building open communities and partner ecosystems to deliver the Sun
Cloud. Sun will also take the technologies and architectural
blueprints developed for the Sun Cloud and make them available to
customers building their own clouds, ensuring interoperability among
clouds.</p>

<p>Sun is leveraging several technologies to make its Sun Cloud
incredibly easy to use - from deploying applications to provisioning
resources. At the core of the Sun Cloud Compute Service are the
Virtual Data Center (VDC) capabilities acquired in Sun's purchase of
Q-layer in January 2009, which provide everything an individual or
team of developers needs to build and operate a datacenter in the
cloud. The VDC provides a unified, integrated interface to stage an
application running on any operating system within a cloud, including
OpenSolaris, Linux or Windows. It features a drag-and-drop method, in
addition to APIs and a command line interface for provisioning
compute, storage and networking resources via any Web browser. The Sun
Cloud Storage Service supports WebDAV protocols for easy file access
and object store APIs that are compatible with Amazon's S3 APIs.</p>

<p>Sun announced that leading partners and key advocates for cloud
standards are supporting its goal to deliver an open cloud platform.  <a
href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com">Cloud Foundry</a>, <a
href="http://www.rightscale.com">RightScale</a> and <a
href="http://www.zmanda.com">Zmanda</a> are three of the many cloud
application providers, cloud management solution providers, Service
Providers and cloud consulting companies partnering with Sun.
<a href="http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu/">Eucalyptus</a>,
an open source infrastructure for implementing cloud computing, is also
supporting Sun's approach to drive standards-based, open source cloud
platforms and applications, enabling users to integrate with other
platforms and services.</p>

<p>To view the CommunityOne event webcast live at 9 am ET, go to <a
href="http://sun.com/communityone">http://sun.com/communityone</a>. It will
also be available on-demand.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Eclipse Announces First Release of Swordfish, a Next Generation ESB</h3>
<p>At the EclipseCon conference in April, The Eclipse Foundation
announced the first release of Swordfish, a next-generation enterprise
service bus (ESB) that provides the flexibility and extensibility
required by enterprises to successfully deploy a service-oriented
architecture (SOA) strategy. Swordfish is based on the OSGi standard
and builds upon successful open source projects, including Eclipse
Equinox and Apache ServiceMix.</p>

<p>Swordfish provides the features and extensible framework required by
enterprises and system integrators to customize their ESB to meet the
specific needs of an enterprise.  These features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for distributed deployment, which results in more
scalable and reliable application deployments by removing a central
coordinating server.
<li>A runtime Service Registry allows services to be loosely coupled,
making it easier to change and update different parts of a deployed
application. The Registry uses policies to match service consumers and
service providers based on their capabilities and requirements.
<li>An extensible Monitoring Framework manages events that allow for
detailed tracking of how messages are processed. These events can be
stored for trend analysis and reporting, or integrated into a complex
event processing system (CEP).
<li>A Remote Configuration Agent makes it possible to configure a
large number of distributed servers from a central configuration
repository without the need to touch individual installed instances.
</ul>

<p>"We are developing Swordfish to meet the requirements we experienced
deploying large scale SOA applications at Deutsche Post and other
large enterprises," explained Ricco Deutscher, CTO of Sopera and a
member of the Eclipse Runtime Project Management Committee. "Using
Equinox and OSGi, we are able to provide the flexible and extensible
architecture required for SOA deployments to be successful."</p>

<p>"Last year we announced a strategy to provide open source runtime
technology based on Equinox and OSGi," remarked Mike Milinkovich,
Executive Director of the Eclipse Foundation. "The first release of
Swordfish is a great example of the progress that is being made to
develop our runtime technology portfolio. Over the next year I expect
we will see more interesting runtime technology built at Eclipse."</p>

<p>The first release of Swordfish 0.8 will be available for download the
first week of April from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swordfish/">http://www.eclipse.org/swordfish/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Pulsar Mobile Group formed by Eclipse</h3>

<p>In March, the Eclipse Foundation announced Pulsar, a new industry
initiative to define and create a standard mobile application development
tools platform. The initiative is led by Motorola, Nokia and <a
href="http://www.genuitec.com">Genuitec</a>. Other participating members
include IBM, <a href="http://www.rim.com/">RIM</a> and Sony Ericsson.</p>

<p>Pulsar will support major mobile development environments such as 
JavaME, mobile Web technologies, and native mobile platforms.</p>

<p>Instead of requiring mobile developers to use a variety of software 
development kits (SDKs) to develop their applications for different 
handset manufacturers, Pulsar will define a common set of 
Eclipse-based tools in a packaged distribution that will inter-operate 
with the various handset SDKs. This will enable developers to stay 
within one familiar development environment while creating mobile 
applications that target multiple device families.</p>

<p>The Pulsar initiative will focus on four areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>The creation of the packaged distribution called Eclipse Pulsar 
Platform;
<li>A technical roadmap to advance the capabilities of the platform;
<li>A set of best practices which includes documentation and test 
suites; and
<li>Education and outreach to drive adoption of Pulsar with mobile 
application developers.
</ul>

<p>The first release of Pulsar Platform is expected to be available at 
the end of June 2009 and will be part of the Eclipse Galileo annual 
release.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Open Source AWS Toolkit for Eclipse available now</h3>
<p>The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse was announced at a keynote presentation at 
EclipseCon 2009. This is a new plugin for Eclipse, targeted for Tomcat 
or other application servers running in the Amazon cloud. Support for 
Glassfish, JBoss, WebSphere, and WebLogic will be coming.</p>

<p>The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, based on the Eclipse Web Tools Platform, 
guides Java developers through common workflows and automates tool 
configuration, such as setting up remote debugger connections and 
managing Tomcat containers. The steps to configure Tomcat servers, run 
applications on Amazon EC2, and debug the software remotely are now 
done seamlessly through the Eclipse IDE.</p>
 
<p>The new plugin requires Java 1.5 or higher. The Eclipse IDE for Java 
Developers 3.4 is recommended. Find more info here:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 Beta</h3>
<p>Red Hat is now testing the beta release of RHEL 4.8
(kernel-2.6.9-82.EL) for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 family of
products</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 is in development and the implemented
features and supported configurations are subject to change before
the release of the final product. The beta CD and DVD images are
intended for testing purposes only. Benchmark and performance results
cannot be published based on this beta release without explicit
approval from Red Hat.</p>

<!-- Ben please rewrite the following para. -->

<p>While 'anaconda' upgrade option upgrade from Red Hat Enterprise Linux
4.7 to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 beta, there is no guarantee
that the upgrade will preserve all of a system's settings, services,
and custom configurations. For this reason, Red Hat recommends a fresh
installation rather than an upgrade. Also note that upgrading from
beta release to the GA product is not supported.</p>

<p>Red Hat is moving GCC4 from Tech Preview to supported but notes that
GCC4 in Enterprise Linux 4 is not fully ABI compatible with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5. Applications compiled on the older version,
Enterprise Linux 4, are expected to continue to work on the newer
version 5 as long as they use libraries that are also supported on
Enterprise Linux 5 (either directly or via compatibility libraries).</p>

<p>RHEL 4.8 is available to existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscribers
via RHN.  Installable binary and source ISO images are available via Red
Hat Network at: <a
href="https://rhn.redhat.com/network/software/download_isos_full.pxt">https://rhn.redhat.com/network/software/download_isos_full.pxt</a>.</p>
