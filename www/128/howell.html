<h1>A Brief Introduction to VMware Player</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>

<p>The other day on the way home from work, between the streetcar
and the bus, I spent a couple of minutes at the train station
bookstore, and picked up a magazine with a DVD containing 10 new
"Linux-PCs". Hmmmm...</p>

<p>After getting off the bus, but before I had a chance to
complete the walk home, it began to rain. That ruined all hopes
of being able to mow the lawn... so I decided to investigate the
DVD, instead.</p>

<p>As it turned out, it contained VMware Player and 10 virtual
machines, or VMs: Damn Small Linux, Fedora Core 4, Pocketlinux,
and so on. It was beginning to look as if the weekend would have
some sunshine, after all!</p>

<h3>Just What Is VMware?</h3>

<p>For those not familiar with virtualization in general, or
VMware in particular, virtualization has been around in the
mainframe world for some 30-odd years. It enables effectively
simultaneous execution of more than one instance of operating
systems &mdash; including, in the case of VMware, ones that would
not normally even be able to execute on the physically available
hardware. This is a remarkable accomplishment that requires
convincing the operating system that it really has sole ownership
of the hardware environment it requires.</p>

<p>This unfairly terse description falls horribly short of doing
justice to the amazing feat - but there is no shortage of
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/">far more detailed
descriptions</a> on the Internet.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>As usual, the first step is to install VMware Player. Well
organized by VMware, <a href=
"misc/howell/install.txt">installation</a> was a real no-brainer.
I did read the prompts and consider the responses, but wound up
just accepting the defaults offered by the installation
script.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was an idiosyncrasy of the particular magazine that
I picked up (it actually addresses users of Wimp/OS), but they
had used a compression program I neither had nor had ever heard
of. No problem - it was available at SourceForge, and just needed
to be installed.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ '7zip' is actually not a Wind0ws-centric
program at all; it's been available for Linux for quite a while
now. To quote Debian's package listing, <strong>"7-Zip is the
file archiver that archives with the highest compression ratios.
The program supports 7z (that implements LZMA compression
algorithm), ZIP, Zip64, CAB, RAR, ARJ, GZIP, BZIP2, TAR, CPIO,
RPM and DEB formats. Compression ratios with the new 7z format
are 30 to 50% better than ratios with the ZIP format."</strong>
Good stuff, in other words... except that their RAR compressor
is non-free. -- Ben ]</p>

<p>After that, installation of the VMs was quite
straight-forward.</p>

<p>Now, VMware Player was fully functional and could execute the
available VMs.</p>

<h3>Using Virtual Machines</h3>

<p>Under SUSE with KDE, click on the panel icon for K Menu, then
'System' -&gt; 'More Programs' -&gt; 'VMware
Player'.</p><img src="misc/howell/vmw01.jpg" alt="image1">

<p>Navigation is not particularly challenging. As a first test, I
chose Damn Small Linux from the 'vm' directory.</p>

<p>Solitaire is a bit sluggish on this 2.6 GHz Celeron(tm), but
bearable. In any case, the following definitely isn't
SUSE!</p><img src="misc/howell/vmw02.jpg" alt="image2">

<p>When the bottom line shows "To grab input, press Ctrl+G", you
can move the cursor over the window as usual. Once you press
Ctrl+G, the cursor belongs to that window, and it is necessary to
press Ctrl+Alt to effectively de-activate that window and free
the cursor. Ctrl-Alt-F2 and the like still work as usual.</p>

<p>At this point, I halted the VM and shut VMware Player down.
Then, I rebooted the hardware. Upon restarting this VM, the
former status was restored:</p><img src="misc/howell/vmw03.jpg" alt="image3">

<p>Before re-starting VMware Player, I also added another couple
of VMs. The following looks interesting for this long-time SUSE
user, at least:</p><img src="misc/howell/vmw04.jpg" alt="image8">

<p>Indeed, after logon:</p><img src="misc/howell/vmw05.jpg" alt="image4">

<p>And for the skeptics in the crowd, yes, both are active at the
same time:</p><img src="misc/howell/vmw07.jpg" alt="image5">

<p>The initial boot of a VM takes quite a while, just as does
booting hardware. On the other hand, restarting a VM that has
been active for a while is extremely fast.</p>

<p>Activating the network was no problem at all. In each of two
VMs, after a right-click on the "Ethernet" button, I selected
"host-only" and then assigned IP-addresses as in "ifconfig eth0
172.16.48.130 up". After that, ping worked as
expected:</p><img src="misc/howell/vmw10.jpg" alt="image6">

<h3>Sharing Hardware</h3>

<p>VMware Player seems to share the hardware with the native
operating system quite well. While using Midnight Commander under
SUSE to copy VMs from the DVD into the appropriate directory, I
started Ubuntu under VMware, and it discovered the DVD drive and
went into update mode (synaptic). That slowed down the copying
considerably, but it worked just fine.</p>

<p>It is interesting that there is almost no limit to the number
of VMs available. VMware doesn't use partitions; each VM exists
within its own directory. I renamed the Ubuntu directory and
unpacked it again, creating a clone. When the renamed VM was
started, it came up with the status at the point where it had
been shutdown. The new VM went through the usual (simulated)
hardware boot.</p>

<p>The SUSE VM is 10.0, which is my most-current version. After
placing the distribution DVD in the drive and clicking on the
"CD-ROM" button, there was no problem using YaST to add software
to the VM. Although VMware Player doesn't support creating new
VMs, they clearly can be updated. Since YaST uses RPMs,
installing one ought to work, and I would expect that to be the
case for a tarball, as well.</p>

<h3>Finite Resources</h3>

<p>But don't get over-confident in starting VMs! At least
<strong>my</strong> resources are finite:</p><img src=
"misc/howell/vmw08.jpg" alt="image7">

<h3>Networking</h3>

<p>After assigning an appropriate IP-address such that the Ubuntu
VM was on the same sub-net as the network printer, it was
possible to ping it. Similarly for the notebook, manually
assigned IP-address 192.168.0.100. This required using the
"Ethernet" button to change the status of the network from
"host-only" to "bridged".</p>
<img src="misc/howell/vmw11.jpg" alt="image8">
<p>
There was no trouble using SSH to log onto the notebook from
Ubuntu, or the other way around, although this of course required
using the ad-hoc IP-addresses rather than host names.
</p>

<h3>Why Bother?</h3>

<p>Some time ago, when I mentioned to someone that I was
interested in checking out virtualization on a PC, his response
was "Why?" Wow, someone even more skeptical than I am! But the
question is certainly legitimate.</p>

<p>Typically the "traditional" reason to use virtualization in
this environment has been consolidation of servers, as in a
server farm that has lots of hardware idle most of the time.
Particularly if hosting for customers who may be competitors,
virtualization provides clean separation of VMs as opposed to
simply providing service for many customers on one machine.</p>

<p>However, I don't have a server farm in need of consolidation
in the office at home, and I doubt that most readers do either.
However, if you think about it, this can be a very interesting
technology, although certainly not of use to everybody.</p>

<p>As you saw above, given available VMs, it is essentially
trivial to make an unfamiliar environment available in a
non-trivial way. As a long-time SUSE user, I'm not at all
familiar with GNOME. Disparaging comments by others
notwithstanding, I am interested in playing around with GNOME,
which is very different from what I am used to.</p>

<p>Indeed, this environment should be ideal for both teachers and
students. One of the things that I really appreciate about
GNU/Linux is the ability to learn new things at my own pace, at
home, when I have the time and at no or minimal expense. Without
a great deal of effort on my part, I can now get familiar with
several distributions I might never have had the time for.</p>

<p>Someone teaching a course could set up a series of exercises
for his students, and just needs to copy a handful of VMs onto
CD-ROM. This would be very effective for a course on some Linux
distribution, particularly if the students have only Wimp/OS at
home.</p>

<p>Or consider the need to do regression tests. The fact that
every VM restarts at the point it had been shut down would be
extremely nice for testing. Set up initial conditions and save
the directory to ensure that every test later run actually is
testing the same thing, unaffected by any side-effects of
something else run between tests.</p>

<h3>Philosophy 101</h3>

<p>To those who might object to VMware's proprietary business
model, I would reply that it is another tool on the market, and,
from my perspective as a consultant, I like having it in my
toolbox. Very many years ago, on a job-interview, I had to admit
that I didn't yet have any experience with one particular
package. Someone else got that job. Made sense then, makes sense
today. Do you want to be the one to say "I can learn that"? How
about "Been there, done that"?</p>

<p>In my opinion, virtualization is going to be very important,
very soon. I am really looking forward to my first machine with
Vanderpool or Pacifica technology.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This "brief" introduction comes nowhere near doing justice to
the accomplishment of VMware. It can be installed under Wimp/OS
to run GNU/Linux or the other way around (if your proprietary
EULA license gives you access to or permits your producing the
appropriate VM). Or merely to isolate a test-bed from a
production environment, as in the above.</p>

<p>There were problems, but not all of them were due to the
product. Likely attributable to VMware are problems with reboot
and date/time, although it might be argued that these are not
bugs but features. Using "reboot" or "shutdown -r now" returns
the VM to single-user mode. I couldn't figure out how to get
"startx --:1" under SUSE to do any good. And after having used
VMware's "Quit" button to shut down a VM for a couple of days, on
restart it has the date and time of shutdown. Well, in some
scenarios that does make sense.</p>

<p>VMware certainly does require significant resources. The
version of Solitaire that comes with SUSE will finish a game
automatically if told to try; natively, on a notebook with 1 GB
of memory, it moves about 5 cards per second. Under VMware,
however, it takes about 2 seconds per card. ping can take so long
that it seems to have hung: in spite of reporting 0.352 ms, the
wall-clock time was closer to 10 seconds!</p>

<p>This is not the responsibility of VMware, but my PC has only
512 MB - which sure seemed like a lot at the time. Two instances
of Ubuntu can be started in that, but their response times are
egregiously slow. A third instance fails due to lack of
memory.</p>

<p>A general problem with an environment where several different
systems can be played with is inexperience with each, by
definition (again, not relevant to VMware specifically.) It took
frustratingly long to find a command line with GNOME. Although
Ubuntu claimed to be using a German keyboard, it wasn't and I
couldn't convince it to do so &mdash; but, then, SUSE with the
same problem was difficult, because SaX2 wouldn't execute
consistently.</p>

<p>If the VM available to you doesn't correspond to your
hardware, you might be in trouble. Given appropriate distribution
media, it is possible to update software. However, what if the VM
doesn't even know about DVDs or writing to CD? Well, there's
always networking out to the native operating system.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, never was it so easy -- without having to worry
about repartitioning or zapping the MBR -- to get so many
different operating systems functional on one machine, not only
without their getting in each other's way but able to co-operate
with each other.</p>
