Hello,
</p>

<p>
			 I have a problem in accessing the serial port. I am trying
to send data to another system using null modem. When we are using the
program in loopback method it's working fine like we are able to
transmit data and receive the data on a pc. But when trying to
communicate between two systems based on linux (using c code) we are not
getting the output. When writing to the port it is showing that it has
written the data to the port. But on other side (i.e.,  on another
system) we couldn't read the data which we have sent from first system.
What to do? Tried h/w flow control &amp; sftware flowcontrol but no use.
Till now it was showing error like " error no.11,Could not read , the
resourcet is temporarily unavailable. Now It's saying like reading the
port successfully. But the number of bytes it's showing is zero. We
could nt understand if the data we are writing in first system is
reaching the second system with null modem and the other system is
having a problem in reading the data or what ? Kindly suggest where the
problem could be?
</p>

<p>
Thanks &amp; Regards,
vasavi

In situations like this I use minicom or kermit on the receive side
to confirm that the serial data is actually being transmitted.

<p>
Remember you have to have all the serial paramaters set correctly - baud 
rate, number of data bits, whether parity is added, number of stop bits,
hardware/software flow control, whether to ignore DTR/DSR etc.
</p>

<p>
Once I confirmed my transmission code proved, then I use minicom or kermit
to transmit to my receiving software. Once I've got that sorted it should 
work fine.

Serial programming under *nix systems can be a bit daunting. You have to 
telling the kernel how to handle the incoming data, is it coming in raw, or 
"cooked". Check out the serial programming howto at
