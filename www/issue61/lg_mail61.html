Hi Folks.
</P>
<P>
I've taken a quick look around the web for Linux based Internet
Cafe Software, with no luck. There's a few windows based packages
around, but that will just not do. What I'm looking for is
something which can record when people login and logoff and
calculate how much they should pay. Have you seen anything like
that? Even a set of instructions on how to do it with a set of
scripts would be cool.
</P>
<P>

</P>

<p>Can any of our fair readers find some good internet cafe or "walk in ISP"
	software?  We can only offer the following leads: </p>

<em>
<p>Try looking around including the keyword Coffeenet.  That was a Linux
based cafe in the S.F. area; he closed shop when he had his lease end,
but it was successful before that, the building owner just didn't want
to renew.  I'm pretty sure he open sourced the distro he created, but
note, it depends on having a serious NFS server in the back.
</P>
<P>
I know the <A HREF="http://www.valinux.com/">VA Linux</A> "mail garden" machines and his, had a similar feature
of cleaning up after anything local, so the machines never have any
interesting leftovers from previous clients.  xdm or gdm have control
files for stuff to do before and after a session, so it should be possible
to add accounting functions to logging in and out, and to add cleanup
to logging out, quite easily.    Keeping people from accessing text mode
is a little more work, but I don't think Coffeenet was preventing that.
</P>
<P>
Neither of these actually kick someone out when their time is up, so you
still have some work to do if your shop is too big to merely keep an eye
on people and rely on a popup "you've been on for awhile" note.
<br>-- Heather
</P>
</em>
<P>
I don't know of any scripts, but "last" gives you login/logout times
by user.  Should be possible to dump the output into a database
via some pretty simple awk, perl, python, or even sh scripts.
</P>
<P>
Last reads wtmp, so watch out for when your wtmp gets rotated.
Most log rotation scripts will move wtmp to a backup, for example
wtmp.1, and "last" will take a filename as a parameter.
</P>
<P>
Sample output from "last":

<P>
Hi guys (and Heather 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">!
</P>
<P>
I've got an interesting little problem with Samba and hiding shares when
multiple networks are involved.  I'm hoping one of you can help out, or maybe
one of the Gentle Readers has already done this.
</P>
<P>
I have one Samba box with two network interfaces (on one NIC using virtual
lans), say 192.168.1.10 and 192.168.2.10. Two companies sit on each network and
can't learn about the other. Let's call them "Acme, Limited" (192.168.1.0/24)
and "Coyotes-R-Us" (192.168.2.0/24). They, of course, use Another Operating
System.
</P>
<P>
What I want to do is to create shares on the Samba box for Acme and Coyote to
store their files.  That's easy enough, the problem is in restricting what they
see.
</P>
<P>
If I create Acme and Coyote as users and share the home directories via the
[homes] default share, Acme will not see Coyote's share and vice versa.  This
is good.  However, if the CEO of "Coyotes-R-Us", Mr. Wiley, logs onto the Acme
network, he will see the Coyote [home] share appear on the Acme network.  This
is NOT a Good Thing.
</P>
<P>
(I tested this by placing a Windows box on Acme's network via a port on a Cisco
switch that was set up to handle only Acme's vlan.)
</P>
<P>
If, OTOH, I set them up as separate shares and restrict them via IP addresses a
la "allowed_hosts=", both companies can see the other's share, which is Not A
Good Thing, even though they cannot access the other's share (always a good
thing).
</P>
<P>
I've been hacking at this for several days trying to figure something out, as
well as surfing Google, Deja.com, the samba mailing lists, and any other place
I could think of. You are my Last Great Hope.

LG is awesome, if you charged for it I would subscribe. When I
get some free time one of these I hope to pen a few articles and
such.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks.  Linux Gazette was established as a free zine and we firmly
intend to keep it that way.  There are already paid magazines out
there (we publish one of them 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">, but LG fills a unique niche.  No
other e-zine I know of (Linux or otherwise) is read, not just
through a single point of access, but in large part via mirrors or
off-line (via FTP files, CD-ROMS, etc).
</P>
<P>
Also, because LG's articles are written by our readers, you
(readers) are truly writing your own magazine.  I only put things
together and insert a few comments here and there, and occasionally
write an article. If it weren't for our volunteer authors, there
would be no Linux
Gazette.  When I first took over editing in June 1999, I used
to wonder every month whether there would be enough articles.  But
every month my mailbox magically fills with enough articles not
just for a minimal zine (5-10 technical articles), but for a robust
zine with 15+ articles covering a variety of content (for newbies
and oldbies, technical articles and cartoons).  A year ago, we
never predicted there would be cartoons in the Gazette, but the
authors just wrote in and offered them, and it's been a great
addition.  It is truly a privilege to work with such a responsive
group of readers, and years from now when I'm retired (hi,
Margie!), I'm sure I will remember fondly what an opportunity it
was.
</P>
<P>
Our biggest thanks go to The Answer Gang, especially Heather and
Jim, who each spend 20+ hours a month <em>unpaid</em> compiling The Answer
Gang, 2-Cent Tips and The Mailbag.  This has really made things a
lot easier for me.
</P>

<p><em>Awwww, shux.  I do get the occasional consulting lead from this,

And you other readers who haven't contributed anything yet, get off
your asses and send something in!  Write a letter for the Mailbag,
answer a tech-support question, join The Answer Gang, do a
translation for our foreign-language sites, or write an article.

I can't speak for the whole Answer Gang, nor do I set Linux Gazette policy
- but I, for one, have absolutely zero interest in being a free
one-on-one tutor for the general public, although I'm always willing to
help my friends. I enjoy the fact that the effort I expend in answering
these questions goes toward helping everyone in the Linux community: even
those that don't read the LG benefit from the general dispersion of good,
useful Linux knowledge. This is precisely <EM>why</EM> I expend the effort, or is
at least one of my major motivations for doing so.
</P>
<P>
For anyone wanting one-on-one tech support and tutoring, it's "cash on the
barrel" in a "what you get is what you pay for" economy. Cash preferred,
bank checks are OK, major credit cards cheerfully accepted.

Hi Mike,
please find attached the
&lt;A HREF="lg_bytes61.html"&gt;news bytes 61 file&lt;/A&gt;.
I did go through the SSH issues, and summarised them briefly. I kind of
skirted around the SSL because it seemed less clear cut, and very much an
issue of implementation and protecting users from themselves. Most
discussion in the links focussed on SSH in any case.
</P>
<P>
I would recommend, not an article on Holes in SSH, but rather an article on
security in general. Lots of contradictory messages on Slashdot indicate
that people still don't really understand what is going on or how exactly to
administer a public key system.
</P>
<P>
The issues are not new, but are inherent in public key systems.
pgp,gnupg is the same (how can i be sure the key i think is yours is really
yours?). The biggest issue is probably users (lusers) ignoring warning
messages.
</P>
<P>
The new dsniff software is probably worth commenting on also. I included a
link in my short discussion, but have not studied it. What could be very
interesting would be for an article to highlight how to use tools like this
to strengthen your system/network by scrutinising it and probing it. Focus
tends to be on how these tools allow malicious people to break other
people's systems.
</P>
