<H1>THE FOURTH ANNUAL LINUX EXPO CONFERENCE</H1> 
<P>
Research Triangle Park, NC--March 23 1998--The Linux Operating System
is making waves in the news, and now is the opportunity for the world
to find out why.  Get ready for the largest gathering of the best and
brightest minds in the computer world--all there to discuss Linux!  For
three business-centered and technology-packed days, May 28-30, the
fourth annual Linux Expo will take over Duke University in Durham, NC.
<P>
This year's Linux Expo is a can't-miss event.  Make plans now to visit
the record number of Expo exhibitors showing the latest in Linux-based
hardware, software, and service solutions.  And stop in on the business
and technical discussions to hear talks by some of the most important
names in technology today.   From Alan Cox on porting Linux to the
Macintosh to Darryl Strauss on the use of Digital Domain's Linux
rendering farm in "Titanic" to Jon 'maddog' Hall on Linux around the
world to Linus Torvalds, the original developer of the Linux kernal and
the Expo's keynote speaker,  the Linux Expo has something for everyone.
<P>
In addition to the hardware, software, component and applications
vendors, the Linux Expo will also have a Quake Fest, Games Forum,
Editor Wars,  and an Email Garden.  Tutorial sessions with top Linux
developers will also prove to be a large draw at the Expo.
<P>
For more information about the Linux Expo or to register for the events
of the Expo, please see http://www.linuxexpo.org or call 919-547-0028
