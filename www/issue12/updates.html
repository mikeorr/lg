<center><h1>Updates to My Past Reviews</h1></center>

<p>I've been writing these short reviews and other articles for the Gazette
since issue number seven. Even with the short lead time inherent in a
WWW-based publication it seems like new releases and URL changes often happen
right after I submit an article. The status of several of the programs has
changed since I wrote of them, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to list
some of these changes.

<p>By the way, I appreciate all of the email I've received in response to my
articles; feel free to write if you have any comments or criticism.

<ul>

  <li><b>Moxfm</b> hasn't been updated since version 1.00 was released
      several months ago, but it's working well in the current version.  I've
      included it here because I've received several e-mail messages stating
      that the URL in the article wasn't working.  The current URL of the
      Moxfm home page is
      <a href="http://sugra.desy.de/user/mai/moxfm">http://sugra.desy.de/user/mai/moxfm</a>. 
      The source and binaries are in uuencoded form; just let them display on
      the screen of a web-browser, save them to a file, then run "uudecode
      filename.uue". 

  <li><b>TkDesk</b> has been through several versions since I wrote of it;
      the current one is 1.0b3, released on Sept.25, 1996.  There are many
      new features; one which I use often is a file pop-up menu-item which
      hands the file over to a running Xemacs on another desktop.  There is a
      similar capability involving HTML files and Netscape (or another
      browser).  Check out the
      <a href="http://sun1.rrzn-user.uni-hannover.de/~zzhibol/tkdesk">TkDesk
      web-page</a> for the latest news. 

  <li><b>FileRunner</b> has been developing rapidly in the past few months. 
      It's current version is 2.1.1, and many refinements have been made. 
      It's FTP capabilities have been greatly improved; FTP downloads can now
      run as a background process, and directories can be displayed
      date-ordered.  Remote FTP directories can be saved as bookmarks
      (accessible from a menu).  Many configuration options have been added
      as well.  The built-in shell windows which follow you from directory to
      directory are very handy.  They allow you to see the output of
      non-interactive commands (such as compilation) and can be dismissed
      when not needed.  There is a
      <a href="http://www.cd.chalmers.se/~hch/filerunner.html">FileRunner
      web-page</a> from which the source can be obtained, as well as from
      <a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/X11/xutils/managers/">the Sunsite
      archive.</a>. 

  <li><b>Elvis</b> has finally made it to a major release; version 2.00 was
      announced recently. It's available from its
      <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/elvis/">official site</a>. Elvis is
      remarkable for the small size of the compiled binary, considering how
      powerful an editor it is.  Elvis's ability to display HTML in a readable
      form meshes well with the HTML format of the extensive help files.

  <li><b>Vile</b> has a new official maintainer; Paul Fox has handed over the
      reins to another of the primary Vile developers, Thomas Dickey.  Version
      6.2 was released recently.  For some reason Vile doesn't seem to be as
      popular as Vim and Elvis (judging by news-group postings).  I urge
      anyone who favors vi-style editors to give it a try; it really grows on
      you. Vile's new official release site is
      <a href="ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/vile/">ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/vile</a> 

  <li><b>XaoS</b> in its current release (1.2) has a new feature which increases
      its usability for those running X with more than 256 colors: it'll run!
      Previous releases only worked on 8-bit displays.

  <li><b>Yodl</b> version 1.08 has been released; it's mainly a
      "small-bug-fix" release, i.e. if a previous version does what you want,
      you probably don't need it.  It's at sunsite.

  <li><b>Procmeter</b> has been updated to version 2.2; changes include a
      choice of solid or bar-type graphing, and refinement of network packet
      transfer display.

  <li><b>Xmosaic</b> development has slowed since my review.  The
      powers-that-be at the University of Illinois have decided that Xmosaic
      will be the second, rather than the first, GTK (Graphics ToolKit)
      client to be developed.The GTK is a programming toolkit which will take
      the place of Motif in Xmosaic.  Scott Powers, Xmosaic's project leader,
      stated in a message to the mailing list that development will resume in
      a couple of months.  The up side to this news is that the GTK is the
      "hard part", so that once work resumes on Xmosaic development progress
      should be rapid.  </ul>
