Dear all,
</p>

<p>
I have already moved into icewm, idesk, claws-mail, aterm, VLC,
audacious etc... with some other light application to realize speed in
my linux box.
</p>

<pre>
CPU -- AMD Duron 1.5 GHz
RAM -- 128 MB
Swap -- 512 MB
Video Shared memory -- 8 MB
</pre>

<p>
I'm happy to see the quick response time of my system ( comparably fast
than kde ). I also like to add some nice look to my desktop with
calendar, clock, volume control etc... Hence I am thinking to use
adesklets as it is fast due to imlib2. I know some
of you are using adesklets. What is your experience about it ? Is it a
right choice to use it with a system which I have ?
</p>

<p>
Please share your thoughts. Kindly CC to me.

<p>
Thanks

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
    I have read the article of yours from
   <a href='../136/anonymous.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/136/anonymous.html</a>. I am trying to write a small
   driver program, i have written it, but little bit of redesigning is
   needed. So it would be great anyone of you can help me.. i am posting my
   question below ..
</p>

<p>
   I wrote a simple keyboard driver program, which detects the control k
   (CTRL + K) sequence [I have written the code to manipulate only ctrl + k].
   I also have a simple application program which does a normal
   multiplication function.
</p>

<p>
   I need to invoke that application program from my driver when I press ctrl
   + k in my keyboard [once I press the ctrl + k, driver will send a SIGUSR1
   signal to my application program. That will accept the signal and perform
   multiplication]. I could do that if I hardcode the pid of application
   progam [pid of a.out fille] in driver. Ie, inside the function
   kill_proc(5385, SIGUSR1, 0), the first parameter is the pid of application
   program.
   But this is not a correct method, every time I need to compile the
   application program open the driver add the pid to it, compile it using
   Makefile then insert the .ko file, it doesn't look good. I tried using -1
   as the first parameter for kill_proc () [to send the SIGNAL to all the
   process that are listening], since my application program is also
   listening to the SIGNAL, ideally it should catch the SIGUSR1 signal and
   execute It, but it's not working* 1/4.
</p>

<p>
   Can you suggest any method to send the SIGUSR1 signal from my driver
   [which is in kernal spcae] to application program [which is in userspace]?
</p>

<p>
   Having an entry of pid to /proc also i can achieve this, but that is not a
   good design. <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">, Can it be implemented through ioctl?
</p>

<p>
   I am pasting my codes below...

<p>
Hello all,
</p>

<p>
Linux port of DTrace has been moving for some time now.
</p>

<p>
I just tried the latest bits from
<a href='ftp://crisp.dynalias.com/pub/release/website/dtrace'>ftp://crisp.dynalias.com/pub/release/website/dtrace</a> and the initial
impression is we got really cool stuff (in the making here).
</p>

<p>
Besides, GCC, Kernel headers, you will need the following stuffs to
compile and load the DTrace kernel module:
</p>

<pre>
   * libelf-dev: Working with 'elf' files
   * zlib libraries: working with the zlib files
   * bison, flex
</pre>

<p>
Once you have got them, extract the sources and do:
</p>

<pre>
  1. make all
  2. sudo make install
  3. sudo make load
</pre>

<p>
If you do not see any error message, then the DTrace kernel module
'dtracedrv' has been correctly insrted.dtrace -l should display a long
list of the currently available probes.
</p>

<p>
Read the rest at <a href='http://amitksaha.blogspot.com/2009/03/dtrace-on-linux.html'>http://amitksaha.blogspot.com/2009/03/dtrace-on-linux.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
(The code doesn't format properly here, hence the link to the blog)

Best,

<p>
Well done, Arild! Yep, exactly what I mean.
</p>

<p>
What this implies to me is that 1) you have "tripwire" installed (which
you don't need), and 2) that you <em>don't</em> have the "siggen" package (as
contrasted against the "siggen" program) installed. If you had both, the
latter would normally get executed first - because it gets installed in
a "higher priority" directory.
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ apt-file search bin/siggen
siggen: /usr/bin/siggen
tripwire: /usr/sbin/siggen
</pre>

<p>
In the default execution path, "/usr/bin" comes before "/usr/sbin" - so
"/usr/bin/siggen" would get executed first. Here's what you need to do
to fix it:
</p>

<pre>
sudo dpkg -P tripwire
sudo apt-get install siggen
</pre>

<p>
That should take care of it. After you've run the above two commands,
you should be able to type "siggen" at the command line and see the
sound generator application.

Hello everyone.
</p>

<p>
Im needing to configure a temporary internet server here, and after
reading a lot, I'm kinda confused :P
</p>

<p>
I need a non-transparent proxy (asks users for theyr username/pass),
with the ability to block access to certain pages and services (like
www.orkut.com or MSN), plus the ability to generate usage reports.
</p>

<p>
I saw several programs that can do that, but each article I read uses
a diferent combo - thats what confused me <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
So, the question is, what software would you use to create such a
configuration?
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the input

</p>

<p>
Almost not worth mentioning, but I've made a substantive albeit
de-minimus addition to your editorial note, consisting of the words
"non-root":
</p>



<p>
&lt;p class="editorial"&gt;[ A common application of this would be to run a Web
or FTP server chrooted in a directory like /home/www or
/home/ftp; this provides an excellent layer of security, since even a
malicious non-root user who manages to crack that server is stuck in a
"filesystem" that contains few or no tools, no useful files other than
the ones already available for viewing or downloading, and no way to get
up "above" the top of that filesystem. This is referred to as a "chroot
jail". -- Ben ] 
</p>



<p>
Take my word for it, without that qualifier, you'd attract quibbles from
people repeating the usual mantra:  "chroot(8) is not root safe."
(Ditto the chroot() system call.)
</p>

<p>
That is, the root user, and thus also any process that can escalate to 
UID0 privilege can trivially escape from any chroot jail:
<a href='http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Abusing_chroot'>http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Abusing_chroot</a>
<a href='http://unixwiz.net/techtips/chroot-practices.html'>http://unixwiz.net/techtips/chroot-practices.html</a>
<a href='http://www.bpfh.net/simes/computing/chroot-break.html'>http://www.bpfh.net/simes/computing/chroot-break.html</a>
</p>

<p>
(You'll note that the article lists other ways of <em>indirect</em> ways of
escalating privilege, plus "Why would anyone put <em>that</em> in a chroot
jail?" methods such as "Follow a pre-existing hard link to outside the
jail.")
</p>

<p>
If you want to be <em>almost</em> safe against kibbitzers writing in to 
say "chroot is not a security tool!" (another common mantra), amend your
footnote to say that the tool must be used with care as some known means
exist to attack it, and that it's no substitute for eschewing dangerous
software and configurations.  And maybe link to one or more of those
links.
</p>

Hi Gang...
</p>

<p>
here's the situation:
Suppose I log on into server A twice using same user ID (let's say
johndoe). Technically, Linux in server A will create two /dev/pts for
johndoe, likely /dev/pts/0 and /dev/pts/1
</p>

<p>
Is there any way that for johndoe in pts/0 to read what the other
johndoe type in pts/1? Possibly in real time? Initially I thought it
could be done by using "history" command (in bash shell), but it
failed.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

Mulyadi.

Reason I'm asking is that an organisation I help out has had someone

<p>
Hello TAG!
</p>

<p>
Im doing some PHP coding on my machine, and I have apache running on
another machine. I setup'ed a shared folder, and everytime i want to
test something, I put it on the shared folder, then change to the
other machine (on a KVM switch), and do "sudo cp -r * \var\www" and
"sudo rm -r *" (on the shared folder of course), then switch back to
my machine, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Question is - is there any simple way of automatizing that? I didnt
want complex systems, I wanted something that detected when there is
any file in the shared folder, then moved it to /var/www.
</p>

<p>
So, any of you got something that does that?
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the attention
</p>

<p>

Subject: Re: Securing a Network - What's the most secure Network/Server OS?

<p>
This sounds a lot like "I'm taking a course, and I'd like the Internet 
to do my homework for me."   I'll give you generally correct advice, 
with enough lies in here to give you a failing grade if you don't verify 
my statements.
</p>

<p>
If I were setting up a system as you described, I'd focus on what the 
network clients are capable of, and what requires the least non-standard 
configuration on them (because misconfiguration of the client 
workstation is an easy way to introduce insecurity, and it's hard for 
you to enforce their config).
</p>

<p>
The Windows boxes want Windows networking, the Unix-like ones want Unix 
networking.  A Unix server is most likely to give you both easily, 
although almost any server OS can.
</p>

<p>
So the servers should be running SAMBA for Windows logon and network 
shares, plus LDAP and NFS for Unix logon and sharing.  SAMBA can be 
configured to authenticate against the local LDAP server, so it can 
become your single source of knowledge for user accounts.  You can share 
the same directories on the server via SAMBA and NFS, so they become 
your centralized storage.
</p>

<p>
Encrypting network traffic is very much the least of your concern.  So 
many people think security means "encrypt stuff!", when it is the high 
level protocols (logon, authorization) that matters.  Nobody will bother 
with packet sniffing when they can just read the files directly from the 
file server.  Besides, in a wired network, the switches will ensure 
packets only go to the machines where they are supposed to be, so 
sniffing is pointless.  If you really want to waste your time, ipsec, or 
tunneling NFS through SSL will work (wireless should use WPA2 with as 
many bits as makes you happy.
</p>

<p>
To make the network fast, you should grease your network cables.  
Security can be improve by adding cable locks to all the computers, and 
putting in a steel door with a deadbolt, and bars on the windows.

Ben Okopnik recommended a software program called "xoscope" and gave a

card.

I now have the sound card microphone input working and the Xoscope

xoscope display.  What do I do to link the two?

Hello everyone.
</p>

<p>
I just finished installing/configuring squid on a Ubuntu 8.10 server,
and im having the following problem:
</p>

<p>
Clients time-out when trying to access any webpage - access.log gives me:
<pre>
179383 192.168.0.1 TCP_MISS/504 2898 GET <a href='http://www.google.com/'>http://www.google.com/</a> -
DIRECT/209.85.193.104 text/html
</pre>

<p>
after reading about it, i thought adding no_cache allow localnet to my
squid.conf file would fix the problem, but it doesnt (I already have
an ACL saying localnet = 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and an http_access
allow localnet in the same config file)
</p>

<p>
Anyone know what might be the problem?

<p>
Thanks

This cutting and pasting  between various screens on two different computer 
is a real PITA.
</p>

<p>
As you can see from  the forwarding I also had to invoke the use of a third 
computer on a different address. I have no way to directly link  the two 
different computer directly. At least none that I know  of.   And having to 
copy  down  letter by letter what I see on one machine  to get it into the 
other machine is error prone.  Is there a quick way to  network  a Windows 
and a linux machine together so the two can see each other and copy each 
other's files?

&gt; Don't know how to do that in Linux.  Can't seem to figure it out.
&gt; 
&gt; Judging by how my query on siggen is being handled I despair of ever
&gt; figuring  out these other issues.  Maybe I should stick to Windows.
&gt; I am just getting more confused by all the jargon.
</pre>

<p>
Here is an analogy that may help you understand the distinction.
</p>

<p>
A man who has only ever ridden in a taxi decides to take a bus one
day. The bus stops and he gets in along with the other people waiting
at the stop.
</p>

<p>
He starts to occupy a seat when the driver (or in India the
conductor) asks him to buy a ticket before getting in. He is
annoyed: "I have to pay <em>before</em> I get to my destination?"
However, he agrees as tries to pay $50 -- which is refused. Other
passengers try to help him and suggest that he use a smaller
amount. Somehow he manages to find some small change and pay
his fare.
</p>

<p>
He then tells the bus driver he wants to go to the airport. The people
in the bus tell him he got into the wrong bus and that he should get
off this bus at the next stop and get into a different one. Now he is
quite annoyed and has started yelling at people saying that they are
making him really confused. He tells them that he has taken Shuttle
services (which are a shared transport service) and even there he has
never been made to do things so differently from a simple taxi ride.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
There are many ways this story could end:
</p>

<p>
 1. One kind old lady says she is going to somewhere near the airport
 and will get off with him at the next stop and get him on the right
 bus. The guy calms down and agrees.
</p>

<p>
 2. The guy finds a booklet in the bus that explains the way the bus
 system operates. He is fascinated and reads it all the way through.
 Of course, as he is engrossed in his reading he then reaches the last
 stop of the bus he is on but by then he knows the system well enough
 that he can get to the airport from there by bus.
</p>

<p>
 3. The guy yells and screams at everybody and gets off at the next
 stop and vows to always only travel by taxi ever again.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

I just realized that I forgot one either minor or major thing in this
article, depending on how you look at it: how to actually auto-run
'idesk' under IceWM.
</p>

<p>
Since Ubuntu does its own thing with startup files, adding things to
~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession won't do anything useful. However, IceWM
itself supports an init file mechanism of its own: if you place a file
called 'startup' into your ~/.icewm directory and make it executable, it
will be run when you start IceWM. Mine consists of nothing more than

<h3>2-cent Tip: Screenshots without X</h3>

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I had to do this to debug a program so I thought I'd share it.
</p>

<p>
X window dump without X
</p>

<p>
How does one take a screenshot without X? (For example, from the text
console)
</p>

<p>
Use Xvfb (the X server that runs on a virtual frame buffer).
</p>

<p>
Steps:
<pre class='code'>
  1. Run Xvfb
       $ Xvfb
     This will usually start the X server :99
       $ DISPLAY=:99 ; export DISPLAY
  2. Run your application in the appropriate state.
       $ firefox <a href='http://www.linuxgazette.net'>http://www.linuxgazette.net</a> &amp;
  3. Find out which window id corresponds to your application
       $ xwininfo -name 'firefox-bin' | grep id
     Or
       $ xlsclients
     Use the hex string that you get as window id in the commands
     below
  4. Dump the screen shot of that window
       $ xwd -id 'hexid" &gt; firefox.xwd
  5. If you want to, then kill these applications along with the 
     X server
       $ killall Xvfb
</pre>

<p>
'firefox.xwd' is the screenshot you wanted. Use 'convert' or on of
the netpbm tools to convert the 'xwd' format to 'png' or whatever.
</p>

<p>
Additional Notes:
</p>

<p>
A. You can use a different screenshot program.
</p>

<p>
B. If you need to manipulate the window from the command line, then
programmes like 'xautomation' and/or 'xwit' are your friends.
Alternatively, use a WM like "fvwm" or "xmonad":
<pre>
  DISPLAY=:99 xmonad &amp;
</pre>
This will allow you to manipulate windows from the command line if
you know some Haskell!
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

<h3>2-cent Tip: Lists of files by extension</h3>

<p>
Recently, I decided to sort, organize, and generally clean up my rather
extensive music collection, and as a part of this, I decided to
"flatten" the number of file types that were represented in it. Over the
years, just about every type of audio file had made its way into it:
FLAC, M4A, WMA, WAV, MID, APE, and so on, and so on. In fact, the first
step would be to classify all these various types, get a list of each,
and decide how to convert them to MP3s (see my next tip, which describes
a generalized script to do just that.)
</p>

<p>
The process of collecting this kind of info wasn't unfamiliar to me; in
fact, I'd previously done this, or something like it, with the "find"
command when I was trying to establish what kind of files I'd want to
index in a search database. This time, however, I took a bit of extra
care to deal with names containing spaces, non-English characters, and
files with no extensions. I also defined a list of files that I wanted
to ignore (see the "User-modified vars" section of the script) and
provided the option of specifying the directory to index (current one by
default) and the directory in which to create the 'ext' files
(/tmp/files&lt;random_string&gt;) by default; the script notifies you of the
name.)
</p>

<p>
This isn't something that comes up often, but it can be very useful in
certain situations.

<h3>2-cent Tip: Converting from $FOO to MP3</h3>

</p>

<p>
Recently, while organizing my (very large) music library, I analyzed the
whole thing and found out that I had almost 30 (!) different file types.
Much of this was a variety of info files that came with the music (text,
PDF, MS-docs, etc.) as well as image files in every conceivable format
(which I ended up "flattening" to JPG) - but a large number of these
were music formats of every kind, a sort of a living museum of "Music
Formats Throughout the Ages." I decided to "flatten" all of that as well
by converting all the odd formats to MP3.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, there's a wonderful Linux app that will take pretty much
every kind of audio - "mplayer"
(<a href='http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html#ac'>http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html#ac</a>). It can also dump
that audio to a single, easily-convertible format (WAV). As a result, I
created a script that uses "mplayer" and "lame" to process a directory
of music files called "2mp3".
</p>

<p>
It was surprisingly difficult to get everything to work together as it
should, with some odd challenges along the way; for example, redirecting
error output for either of the above programs was rather tricky. The
script processes each file, creates an MP3, and appends to a log called
'2mp3.LOG' in the current directory. It does not delete the original
files - that part is up to you. Enjoy!
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IDC: IT Turning to Linux in Economic Downturn</h3>

<p>A recent market survey conducted by IDC (and sponsored by Novell)
reveals a surge in the acquisition of Linux as the worldwide recession
deepens. More than half of the IT executives surveyed will accelerate
Linux adoption in 2009. Specifically, more than 72 percent of
respondents say they are either actively evaluating or have already
decided to increase their adoption of Linux on the server in 2009,
with more than 68 percent making the same claim for the desktop.</p>

<p>The study surveyed more than 300 senior IT executives spanning
manufacturing, financial services, and retail industries across the
globe, as well as government agencies. The number one motivation
executives gave for migrating to Linux was economic and related to 
lowering ongoing support costs. </p>

<p>"The feedback gleaned from this market survey confirms our belief
that, as organizations fight to cut costs and find value in this tough
economic climate, Linux adoption will accelerate," said Markus Rex,
general manager and senior vice president for Open Platform Solutions
at Novell. "Companies also told us that strengthening Linux
application support, interoperability, virtualization capabilities and
technical support will all fuel adoption even more."</p>

<p>Additional key survey findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>67 percent of respondents stated that interoperability and
manageability between Linux and Windows is one of the most important
factors when choosing an operating system.
<li>The retail industry showed the greatest potential for
acceleration in Linux adoption with 63 percent of respondents planning
an increase on the desktop and 69 percent considering the same on the
server. The government sector lagged.
<li>Almost 50 percent of respondents plan to accelerate adoption of
Linux on the desktop, especially for basic office functions, technical
workstation users, and higher education/K-12.
<li>Nearly half of respondents stated that moving to virtualization
is accelerating their adoption of Linux. Eighty-eight percent of
recipients plan to evaluate, deploy or increase their use of
virtualization software within Linux operating systems over the next
12-24 months.
<li>From a regional perspective, Asia/Pacific is the most bullish on
increasing Linux adoption, as 73 percent of respondents said they
would increase deployments on the server and 70 percent on the
desktop. In the Americas, 66 percent of respondents said they are
either evaluating or have already decided to increase adoption of
Linux on the desktop and 67 percent on the server.
<li>The economic crisis has had the biggest effect on the Americas,
and in financial services and government. More than 62 percent of
respondents said that their budget has been cut or that they are only
investing where needed.
</ul>

<p>The research conducted in February 2009 showed 55 percent of
respondents had Linux server operating systems in use, 39 percent had
Unix server operating systems in use, and 97 percent had Windows
server operating systems in use. Respondents were pre-screened via
demographics screeners and completed the survey online. Novell was not
involved in recruiting, and respondents did not need to be Novell
customers.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Microsystems Unveils Open Cloud Platform</h3>
<p>At its CommunityOne developer event in mid-March, Sun Microsystems
showcased its Sun Open Cloud Platform.  Sun previewed plans to launch
the Sun Cloud, its first public cloud service targeted at developers
and startups, and to provide public APIs.</p>

<p>Sun is opening its cloud APIs for public review and comment, so that
others building public and private clouds can easily design them for
compatibility with the Sun Cloud. Sun's Cloud API specifications are
published under the Creative Commons license, which essentially allows
anyone to use them in any way. Developers will be able to deploy
applications to the Sun Cloud immediately, by leveraging pre-packaged
VMIs (virtual machine images) of Sun's open source software,
eliminating the need to download, install and configure infrastructure
software. To participate in the discussion and development of Sun's
Cloud APIs, go to <a href="http://sun.com/cloud">http://sun.com/cloud</a>.</p>

<p>At the core of the Sun Cloud will be the first two services - Sun
Cloud Storage Service and Sun Cloud Compute Service - which will be
available this summer. Customers will be able to take advantage of the
combined benefits of open source and cloud computing via the Sun Cloud
to accelerate the delivery of new applications, reducing overall risk
and quickly scaling compute and storage capacity up and down to meet
demand. Sun is leveraging its extensive portfolio of products,
unparalleled world-class professional services and extensive expertise
in building open communities and partner ecosystems to deliver the Sun
Cloud. Sun will also take the technologies and architectural
blueprints developed for the Sun Cloud and make them available to
customers building their own clouds, ensuring interoperability among
clouds.</p>

<p>Sun is leveraging several technologies to make its Sun Cloud
incredibly easy to use - from deploying applications to provisioning
resources. At the core of the Sun Cloud Compute Service are the
Virtual Data Center (VDC) capabilities acquired in Sun's purchase of
Q-layer in January 2009, which provide everything an individual or
team of developers needs to build and operate a datacenter in the
cloud. The VDC provides a unified, integrated interface to stage an
application running on any operating system within a cloud, including
OpenSolaris, Linux or Windows. It features a drag-and-drop method, in
addition to APIs and a command line interface for provisioning
compute, storage and networking resources via any Web browser. The Sun
Cloud Storage Service supports WebDAV protocols for easy file access
and object store APIs that are compatible with Amazon's S3 APIs.</p>

<p>Sun announced that leading partners and key advocates for cloud
standards are supporting its goal to deliver an open cloud platform.  <a
href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com">Cloud Foundry</a>, <a
href="http://www.rightscale.com">RightScale</a> and <a
href="http://www.zmanda.com">Zmanda</a> are three of the many cloud
application providers, cloud management solution providers, Service
Providers and cloud consulting companies partnering with Sun.
<a href="http://eucalyptus.cs.ucsb.edu/">Eucalyptus</a>,
an open source infrastructure for implementing cloud computing, is also
supporting Sun's approach to drive standards-based, open source cloud
platforms and applications, enabling users to integrate with other
platforms and services.</p>

<p>To view the CommunityOne event webcast live at 9 am ET, go to <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Eclipse Announces First Release of Swordfish, a Next Generation ESB</h3>
<p>At the EclipseCon conference in April, The Eclipse Foundation
announced the first release of Swordfish, a next-generation enterprise
service bus (ESB) that provides the flexibility and extensibility
required by enterprises to successfully deploy a service-oriented
architecture (SOA) strategy. Swordfish is based on the OSGi standard
and builds upon successful open source projects, including Eclipse
Equinox and Apache ServiceMix.</p>

<p>Swordfish provides the features and extensible framework required by
enterprises and system integrators to customize their ESB to meet the
specific needs of an enterprise.  These features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for distributed deployment, which results in more
scalable and reliable application deployments by removing a central
coordinating server.
<li>A runtime Service Registry allows services to be loosely coupled,
making it easier to change and update different parts of a deployed
application. The Registry uses policies to match service consumers and
service providers based on their capabilities and requirements.
<li>An extensible Monitoring Framework manages events that allow for
detailed tracking of how messages are processed. These events can be
stored for trend analysis and reporting, or integrated into a complex
event processing system (CEP).
<li>A Remote Configuration Agent makes it possible to configure a
large number of distributed servers from a central configuration
repository without the need to touch individual installed instances.
</ul>

<p>"We are developing Swordfish to meet the requirements we experienced
deploying large scale SOA applications at Deutsche Post and other
large enterprises," explained Ricco Deutscher, CTO of Sopera and a
member of the Eclipse Runtime Project Management Committee. "Using
Equinox and OSGi, we are able to provide the flexible and extensible
architecture required for SOA deployments to be successful."</p>

<p>"Last year we announced a strategy to provide open source runtime
technology based on Equinox and OSGi," remarked Mike Milinkovich,
Executive Director of the Eclipse Foundation. "The first release of
Swordfish is a great example of the progress that is being made to
develop our runtime technology portfolio. Over the next year I expect
we will see more interesting runtime technology built at Eclipse."</p>

<p>The first release of Swordfish 0.8 will be available for download the
first week of April from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swordfish/">http://www.eclipse.org/swordfish/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Pulsar Mobile Group formed by Eclipse</h3>

<p>In March, the Eclipse Foundation announced Pulsar, a new industry
initiative to define and create a standard mobile application development
tools platform. The initiative is led by Motorola, Nokia and <a
href="http://www.genuitec.com">Genuitec</a>. Other participating members
include IBM, <a href="http://www.rim.com/">RIM</a> and Sony Ericsson.</p>

<p>Pulsar will support major mobile development environments such as 
JavaME, mobile Web technologies, and native mobile platforms.</p>

<p>Instead of requiring mobile developers to use a variety of software 
development kits (SDKs) to develop their applications for different 
handset manufacturers, Pulsar will define a common set of 
Eclipse-based tools in a packaged distribution that will inter-operate 
with the various handset SDKs. This will enable developers to stay 
within one familiar development environment while creating mobile 
applications that target multiple device families.</p>

<p>The Pulsar initiative will focus on four areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>The creation of the packaged distribution called Eclipse Pulsar 
Platform;
<li>A technical roadmap to advance the capabilities of the platform;
<li>A set of best practices which includes documentation and test 
suites; and
<li>Education and outreach to drive adoption of Pulsar with mobile 
application developers.
</ul>

<p>The first release of Pulsar Platform is expected to be available at 
the end of June 2009 and will be part of the Eclipse Galileo annual 
release.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Open Source AWS Toolkit for Eclipse available now</h3>
<p>The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse was announced at a keynote presentation at 
EclipseCon 2009. This is a new plugin for Eclipse, targeted for Tomcat 
or other application servers running in the Amazon cloud. Support for 
Glassfish, JBoss, WebSphere, and WebLogic will be coming.</p>

<p>The AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, based on the Eclipse Web Tools Platform, 
guides Java developers through common workflows and automates tool 
configuration, such as setting up remote debugger connections and 
managing Tomcat containers. The steps to configure Tomcat servers, run 
applications on Amazon EC2, and debug the software remotely are now 
done seamlessly through the Eclipse IDE.</p>
 
<p>The new plugin requires Java 1.5 or higher. The Eclipse IDE for Java 
Developers 3.4 is recommended. Find more info here:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 Beta</h3>
<p>Red Hat is now testing the beta release of RHEL 4.8
(kernel-2.6.9-82.EL) for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 family of
products</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 is in development and the implemented
features and supported configurations are subject to change before
the release of the final product. The beta CD and DVD images are
intended for testing purposes only. Benchmark and performance results
cannot be published based on this beta release without explicit
approval from Red Hat.</p>

<!-- Ben please rewrite the following para. -->

<p>While 'anaconda' upgrade option upgrade from Red Hat Enterprise Linux
4.7 to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 beta, there is no guarantee
that the upgrade will preserve all of a system's settings, services,
and custom configurations. For this reason, Red Hat recommends a fresh
installation rather than an upgrade. Also note that upgrading from
beta release to the GA product is not supported.</p>

<p>Red Hat is moving GCC4 from Tech Preview to supported but notes that
GCC4 in Enterprise Linux 4 is not fully ABI compatible with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5. Applications compiled on the older version,
Enterprise Linux 4, are expected to continue to work on the newer
version 5 as long as they use libraries that are also supported on
Enterprise Linux 5 (either directly or via compatibility libraries).</p>

<p>RHEL 4.8 is available to existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscribers
via RHN.  Installable binary and source ISO images are available via Red
Hat Network at: <a

<h1>Upgrading your Slug</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
If you installed Debian on an NSLU2 device ("Slug") following <a
href="../138/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape's instructions in LG
#138</a>, then you might now wish to upgrade from <tt>etch</tt> (old
stable) to <tt>lenny</tt> (current stable).  Debian itself contains
instructions for doing this, which you can follow if you like (but see the
note below about the locales package causing a crash). If you use the
NSLU2's watchdog driver, then I recommend first booting without it,
otherwise the general unresponsiveness caused by the upgrade can cause the
watchdog to reboot when the system is unbootable, and you'll have to
restore the filesystem from backup.  However, following the standard Debian
dist-upgrade will still leave you running <tt>lenny</tt> using the
<tt>arm</tt> architecture.  Debian's <tt>arm</tt> port is now considered
deprecated, and in future releases will be replaced by the <tt>armel</tt>
port, which has (among other things) significant speed improvements in
floating-point emulation just by changing the handling of the ARM's
registers, stack frames, etc.
</p>

<p>
If you want to move to <tt>armel</tt> at the same time as you're upgrading
to <tt>lenny</tt>, this normally requires re-installing from scratch (since
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArchTakeover">ArchTakeover</a> is not
implemented, yet.)  However, there is also a way to do it incrementally.
Martin Michlmayr has produced an <a
href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/nslu2/unpack.html">unpacked version of
the lenny armel install</a>, which can be downloaded and untarred into a
subdirectory of your etch system.  Etch will not be able to chroot into
this, but at least it lets you compare key configuration files and make
needed changes from the comfort of a working system.
</p>

<h3>Moving Files and Setting up Configuration</h3>

<p>
The first thing you need to do is copy <tt>fstab</tt> from the
old <tt>/etc</tt> to the new one; you'll also need <tt>resolv.conf, hostname,
hosts, mailname, timezone</tt>, and <tt>adjtime</tt>.  You might also like to copy
apt/sources.list (change it to "lenny" or "stable", if it says "etch"), and
the following files if you have customised them: <tt>inittab, inetd.conf,
logrotate.conf</tt>.  For the password files (i.e., <tt>passwd, shadow, group,
and gshadow</tt> - you don't have to worry about any backup versions ending in
<tt>-</tt>), it is best not to simply copy them from etch, because that can
delete the new accounts that various lenny base packages use. Instead, you
can use <tt>diff -u etc/passwd /etc/passwd | grep \+</tt>, pick out the
real user accounts, and merge them in (and do the same with <tt>group,
shadow, gshadow</tt>).  To review <em>all</em> changes that the new
distribution will make, do something like <tt>diff -ur /etc etc|less</tt>
and read through it, looking for what you want to restore. (However, note
that some packages won't be there yet; try searching the list for "Only in
/etc" to see which new config files you might want to copy across in
preparation for them.) Note that lenny uses rsyslog.conf instead of
syslog.conf.
</p>

<p>
After you are happy with <tt>/etc</tt>, please remember to copy across the
crontabs in <tt>/var/spool/cron</tt>. (I've lost count of the number of
times I as a user have had to re-instate my crontab because some admin
forgot to copy the crontabs during an upgrade).  Also, take a list of the
useful packages you've installed that you want to re-install on the new
system.  Finally, <strong>remove</strong> (rm -r) the following top-level
directories from the new system (make sure you're in the new system, not in
<tt>/</tt>!): <tt>media, home, root, tmp, lost+found, proc, mnt, sys,
srv</tt>.  Removing these means they will not overwrite the corresponding
top-level directories from the old system during the next step.
</p>

<p>
The new system now needs to be copied onto the old one (with the old
directories being kept as backups), <em>and</em> the NSLU2's firmware needs
updating to the lenny version (also downloadable from the above-mentioned
site) using <tt>upslug2</tt> from a desktop, as documented. The directories
are best copied over from another system: halt the NSLU2, mount its disk in
another system, and do
</p>

<pre class="code">
cd /new-system
for D in * ; do
  mv /old-system/$D /old-system/$D.old &amp;&amp; mv $D /old-system
done
</pre>

<p>
substituting <tt>/new-system</tt> and <tt>/old-system</tt> appropriately.
(This assumes you have room to keep the *.old top-level directories on the
same partition; modify it, if not.)
</p>

<h3>Partitioning Complications</h3>

<p>
Because Martin Michlmayr's downloadable firmware image was (at the time of
writing) generated from a system that assumes /dev/sda2 is the root device,
you should make sure that your root filesystem is on the disk's second
partition. If it is on the first, then you can move and/or shrink it
slightly with <tt>gparted</tt>, create a small additional partition before
it, and use fdisk to correct the order if necessary. (The fdisk commands
you need are x, f, r, w, and q.)  Then, put <strong>only</strong> that disk
back into the NSLU2, and switch on.  If all goes well, you should now boot
into the new distribution.  Then, you can start installing packages and
re-compiling local programs, and do <tt>apt-get update</tt>, <tt>apt-get
upgrade</tt> and <tt>apt-get dist-upgrade</tt>.  You might still need to
run <tt>dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</tt>, even though it should show your
correct timezone as the default choice.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you have 2 disks connected at boot time, then there's only a
50/50 chance it will choose the correct one to boot from. (If it doesn't,
disconnect and reconnect the power and try again, or boot with only one
disk connected.)  If you have set up your /etc/fstab to boot from UUIDs,
then this will take effect when you install your own kernel (which should
happen automatically as you upgrade the lenny packages).  You can get a
partition's UUID using <tt>dumpe2fs /dev/sda2 | grep UUID</tt>, and use
UUID=(this number) in place of <tt>/dev/sda2</tt> or whatever in
<tt>fstab</tt>, as long as it's not a swap partition. One trick for getting
swap to work is to ensure that it is on a partition number that is valid on
only one disk, and then list <em>all</em> the disks having swap partitions
with this number. The correct disk will be used, and the others will cause
harmless errors during boot.
</p>

<p>
You may experience further complications on account of the differences
between ext2 and ext3 filesystems: In Debian Etch, if you wanted to
reduce the wear on a flash disk, you could tell /etc/fstab to mount the
partition as ext2, even though the installer formatted it as ext3.
Mounting as ext2 simply leaves out writing the ext3 crash-recovery
journal. Apparently, however, the newer kernel in lenny cannot really
mount an ext3 partition as ext2 (it tells you it's doing so, but it
doesn't, see <a
href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/251999">Ubuntu
bug 251999</a>), and moreover, if your fstab says it's ext2, the
<tt>update-initramfs</tt> utility's omitting the ext3 module from the
kernel will result in an unbootable system when you try to upgrade to
lenny's latest kernel (but you can still boot Martin's kernel, which
expects ext3).  Conversely, if your filesystem really is ext2, you won't
be able to boot Martin's kernel. Therefore, you have to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the filesystem is ext3 before booting Martin's kernel</li>
<li>Make sure the filesystem is ext2 before booting your own kernel, if you
have ext2 in your /etc/fstab</li>
</ul>

<p>
To convert an ext3 partition back to ext2, connect the disk to a separate
computer and, if for example the partition is <tt>sdb2</tt> on that
computer, make sure it is unmounted and do
</p>

<pre>
e2fsck -fy /dev/sdb2
tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sdb2
e2fsck -fy /dev/sdb2
</pre>

<p>
and to convert it back to ext3,
</p>

<pre>
tune2fs -O has_journal /dev/sdb2
</pre>

<p>
Martin has filed <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519800">Debian bug
#519800</a> to suggest that initramfs support both versions of extfs no
matter what <tt>fstab</tt> says, which should mean (when fixed) you don't
have to run <tt>tune2fs</tt> just to get a bootable system. You might still
want to do it anyway to work around the other bug (kernel updating the
journal even when ext2 is requested).
</p>

<h3>Locales Package</h3>

<p>
When doing an apt-get upgrade or dist-upgrade, make sure the
<tt>locales</tt> package is not installed, or at least that you are not
generating any locales with it.  That package's new version requires too
much RAM to generate the locales; the 32MB NSLU2 cannot cope, and may
crash.  If you need any locales other than C and POSIX, then you can get
them from another Linux system by copying the appropriate subdirectories of
<tt>/usr/lib/locale</tt> (and possibly <tt>/usr/share/i18n</tt> if you want
<tt>locale -m</tt> to work, too).
</p>

<h3>Sound</h3>

<p>
If you have fitted a "3D Sound" USB dongle, you might find that, in the new
distribution, the audio becomes choppy and/or echoey.  This seems to be on
account of an inappropriate default choice of algorithms in the ALSA
system, and it can be fixed by creating an <tt>/etc/asound.conf</tt> with
the following contents:
</p>

<pre class="code">
pcm.converter {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:0,0"
    rate 48000
    channels 2
    format S16_LE
  }
}
pcm.!default converter
</pre>

<p>
Note that this configuration deliberately bypasses the mixer, so only one
sound can play at once. Mixing sounds in real time on an embedded system
like this is likely to be more trouble than it's worth.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it no longer seems possible to drive the soundcard itself at
lower sample rates and channels, which is a pity because having to
up-convert any lower-samplerate audio (such as the mono 22.05kHz audio
generated by eSpeak) not only wastes bandwidth on the USB bus but also
seems to slightly reduce the sound quality, but the difference is not
immense.
</p>

<p>
If you are playing MP3s, then you also have the option of getting
<tt>madplay</tt> (rather than the ALSA system) to do the resampling, and
this could theoretically be better because <tt>madplay</tt> is aware of the
original MP3 stream, but I for one can't hear the difference.
</p>

<pre>
madplay file.mp3  -A -9  -R 48000 -S  -o wav:-|aplay -q -D hw:0,0
</pre>

<p>
On lenny (unlike on etch), recording works, too, and it can be done with
<tt>arecord -D hw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 24000 test.wav</tt>, but the quality is
not likely to be good. (Mine had a whine in the background.)
</p>

<h3>Everything Finished</h3>

<p>
If you have done this, then you should, with luck, have an NSLU2 running
lenny on the <tt>armel</tt> architecture, which has significantly faster
floating-point emulation (although it's not as fast as a real
floating-point processor), and perhaps more important has better
long-term support. (You won't be stuck when <tt>arm</tt> is dropped in
the release after lenny.) 
</p>

<p>
The *.old top-level directories created above can be removed when you are
sure you no longer need to retrieve anything from them, or you can rename
them to "old/bin", "old/usr", etc., and have a chroot environment in
<tt>old/</tt>. (The new kernel can run an old system in chroot, but not
vice-versa.)

<h1>Away Mission: 2008 in Review - part 3</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
April is another Mad Month with competing tech events. Besides the
events reviewed here, there are Black Hat Europe 2009, April 14-17, in
Amsterdam, and the USENIX LEET (Large-Scale Exploits and Emergent
Threats) conference in Boston, April 21-24.
</p>

<p>
This year will feature a new major event - the Linux Collaboration Summit,
organized by the Linux Foundation. The 3rd Annual Collaboration Summit will
be co-located with the CELF Embedded Linux Conference and the Linux Storage
and Filesystem Workshop.  It occurs April 8-10 in San Francisco.  More
information is here: <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit/">http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit/</a>
</p>


<h3>Web 2.0 Expo and Velocity</h3>
<p>
Over the years, the Web 2.0 event has split into the Expo, for Web
production people; and the Web 2.0 Summit, for the leaders (which
operates by invitation only).  More recently, the Web 2.0 Expo has
become a forum for social networking and Web designers.
</p>

<p>
The better bet for sysadmins and Linux hackers is the O'Reilly Velocity
Conference in June, which was spun off from the Web 2.0 Expo last year by
presenters from the tech tracks who wanted a dedicated event. It was very
successful, even though the tech community was given barely 3 months
notice. If you have to choose only one or two conferences this year, and
you build or maintain data centers, Velocity should definitely be on your
short list.
</p>

<p>
For starters, all the good tech presentations were repeated at
Velocity. Many of those were expanded, and the networking
opportunities are different. Web 2.0 Expo is about the nexus of art,
Web tech, and - to some extent - marketing. Velocity is about getting
things to work at Web scale and Web velocity. It's fundamentally
nerdier.
</p>

<p>
Since social networking was a big piece of the show, there was a
social networking site for Web 2.0 Expo San Francisco, used to find and
connect with people at the conference and for general opinion mongering.
See what people said: <a href="http://webexsf2008.crowdvine.com/">http://webexsf2008.crowdvine.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
Another social networking site connected to the Web 2.0 Expo is
<a href="http://socialtext.net/web20sf">http://socialtext.net/web20sf</a>.
</p>

<p>
Praise: there is breakfast every AM - fruit, bagels, cream cheese,
juice... which stayed out through the mid-morning break.
</p>

<p>
No praise: the coffee and tea disappeared after the AM break, and 
returned only for the short mid-afternoon break. Moral? Get caffeine
early.
</p>

<p>
Conference attendees get a box lunch, each day. There were special
requests, but a lot of those got lost the first day. They also tried to
limit the number of vegetarian lunches, saying they were out temporarily.
A long line waited against the wall on Wednesday, and seemed rather
unhappy. (That seems to have been fixed on Thursday with a full table, one
of four. That's only fair, as carnivores can eat vegetarian lunches, but
vegetarians can't eat carnivore lunches.)
</p>

<p>
The sense I got from the panoply of 50-minute breakout sessions is
that more people are using open source, and using it in more
sophisticated ways for cutting-edge Web sites. There was some buzz
around OpenID and OAuth, and also around open platforms such as the
Google APIs and Google App Engine, the new Yahoo Social APIs, and lots
of wiki and community hosting sites like Vox and Movable Type.
</p>

<p>
Although mashups and social networking are "so 2007", there are also
lots of new platforms and frameworks to make it easier to roll your
own site and (attempt to) bring these technologies into the
business enterprise. Another emerging trend is the increasing interest
corporate IT is showing in these technologies.
</p>

<p>
Some session presenters, mostly from platform companies or custom
software houses, reported several large IT organizations experimenting
with Web 2.0 and letting the business execs bring in (with some
control and reservations) SaaS versions of the tools they want to
use. The demand is getting to be too big to wait another year. However,
those IT shops are trying to identify the data that needs serious
protection, and trying to quarantine just that, as enterprises become
porous and more vulnerable to penetration.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is talking about making the huge amount of data from social
networks both easier to leverage and more protected for user privacy. That
means increased use of Open Social and similar APIs and identity federation
management frameworks. The work never seems to end.
</p>

<p>
There aren't really tracks for presentations at Web 2.0, but three rooms
are set aside for "sponsored presentations". That often means a bit of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchitecture">marchitecture</a> in those
presentations, but most were hardly any different from the main
presentations, except that the presenters were from bigger companies.
</p>

<p>
The sponsor session with Adobe's Duane Nuetall was actually a very
technical discussion on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomies</a> and
ontologies, and did not mention any Adobe products because they aren't in
the ontology business. Rather, much like the rest of us, they are
interested in using semantic technology as it matures. The
Microsoft-sponsored presentation, however, was on their new Mesh product,
and it was heavy on the marketing side.
</p>

<p>
Other praise-worthy details: The keynotes and breakout sessions
have no power taps or extension cords for users, except those built
into the fixed walls (and in very, very few rooms). I have been
bringing a 15-foot extension cord of my own to allow sitting at some
distance from the outlet if necessary, and sharing one plug with up to
3 users.  I don't know if I've inspired folks or if it's just the
zeitgeist, but I am seeing others now emulating my actions, sometimes
with only a 3-way tap. On Thursday, I saw some one with a full 
6-tap power-strip!  Bless that person.
</p>

<p>
On the last day, there was a block of sysadmin-oriented sessions, two of
them in the same room. (There it is, again, another room scheduling
issue.) As it turns out, all were to be technical presenters at the new and
upcoming O'Reilly Velocity conference in June. That conference and these
sessions took a bead on performance and capacity issues for the operations
crowd.  Seems that the O'Reilly folks understand that the interactive Web
requires more than design artists and AJAX.
</p>

<p>
Steve Souders' presentation at Web 2.0 Expo 2007 was rated #2, which isn't
that surprising since he also worked on YSlow extension for Firefox.
Formerly the head performance guy at Yahoo, and now doing a similar job at
Google, he is focused on the the client side or front end of Web
transactions.  He already has a recent O'Reilly book out on "Web Site
Performance" that provided part of his talk at the 2007 Web 2.0 conference,
and is now preparing a second book, which covers the user side of the
equation.
</p>

<p>
His "Even Faster Web Sites" presentation was a gem, as was its follow-up at
Velocity, a few months later. I'll distill a little of it here. Souders'
research shows that most major sites spend 80-95% of their net time on
front-end processing and browser issues. It's gotten to this state due to
the ubiquity of JavaScript and the proliferation of scattered, individual
scripts.
</p>

<p>
Even a 50% improvement on back-end performance yields only 5-10% gain for
the user. However, simple changes in a few lines of source code can work
wonders. According to Souders, you can easily get a 25% advantage in page
load times by applying 14 performance rules.  Just pick a few appropriate
ones to get a fair gain. Here are a few:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Make fewer HTTP requests, or bundle them up for less network delay.
<li> Use a CDN (content distribution network - use edge delivery as Akamai 
     does).
<li> Add an Expires header, especially with a CDN.
<li> gzip components.
<li> Use YSlow and Firebug to test the load times and performance of 
     individual items.
<li> Since scripts block other content downloading - move 'em to the end 
     of the page code.
<li> Use multiple content domains for even faster downloads.
</ol>

<p>
The last three points were subjects for the second half of the
presentation. There are multiple JavaScript-Fu techniques to break up
the monolithic script payloads. One of these calls for making scripts
individual elements in the DOM (used at MSN.com.) Others use separate
script payloads in different Iframes, or XHR injection (which may be
best for the same domain) and no ordering of the scripts. Another
option is to move some scripts to an external script, which can allow
parallel downloads. Souders also suggests ordering the scripts so they
can be executed in the order they're received.
</p>

<p>
See slide 31 from his presentation, showing the effect of script
loading and execution on a Wikipedia page here:
<a href="misc/dyckoff/Script-Load-Wikipedia.otp">misc/dyckoff/Script-Load-Wikipedia.otp</a>
</p>

<p>
For the full description of these techniques with code samples and a
decision tree for selection of the most suitable in your environment,

</p>

<p>
Jesse Robbins and Artur Bergman of O'Reilly Radar presented an entertaining
and informative review of major failures, disasters, and painful lessons
learned in the past year. Check it out here: <a
href="http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/1769">Failure
Happens: What Broke Since Last Year (and What We Learned from It)</a>
</p>


<p>
The conference party was an outside event... literally. It was a pub crawl
through the restaurants and bars of the artsy, techy San Francisco South
Park area - a brilliant stroke for pleasing the 30-something and
20-something crowd. The crawl had some sprawl and also was over 5 blocks
from the Convention Center on a cold, foggy night.  With a bag on each
shoulder - a laptop bag and a tote with mags and swag - I opted for an
early night and the faster subway ride home. That may have been the better
choice, since many pub crawlers missed the earlier Friday AM sessions.
</p>

<p>
If Web design or social networking sites are your bag, then this is a
must-attend event.  However, if you are working the infrastructure and
biting the scaling bullet, you might take a shine to the Velocity
conference. Some people attend both.
</p>


<h3>RSA for Security Trends</h3>

<p>
Still one of the first-tier security events, RSA 2009 returns to San
Francisco the same week as the MySQL conference in Santa Clara. Both
are excellent, and have different audiences.
</p>

<p>
Alert: Last year (and 2009 as well), both TCG (Trusted Computing
Group) and several identity communities under the auspices of the
Liberty Alliance and Concordia Project held separate semi-public
sessions on the first day of the RSA conference. The identity event
includes representatives from major initiatives in the global identity
sector, and is focused on how the identity industry can deliver new
benefits to users of enterprise and Web 2.0 identity-enabled
applications and services.
</p>

<p>
These sessions are open to all registrants, which should include expo
pass holders.  Since that day was (and continues to be) committed to
tutorials, this is effectively a free extension to the conference.
However, pre-registration is a requirement.
</p>

<p>
For 2008, the identity management workshop was titled, "Identity
Federation &amp; Web Services: Happening Today - Enabling Tomorrow".
Materials from that event are here:
<a href="http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/Concordia_workshop_RSA_2008_notes">http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/Concordia_workshop_RSA_2008_notes</a>
and the actual slide deck is here:
<a href="http://projectconcordia.org/images/7/76/Concordia-Apr2008-wiki.pdf">http://projectconcordia.org/images/7/76/Concordia-Apr2008-wiki.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
For 2009, the event is longer - 8 am to 5 pm - and is titled,
"Harnessing the Power of Digital Identity: 2009 and the Promising Road
Ahead". It is supposed to be open to the public. A detailed workshop
agenda and registration information is available at
<a href="http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/April_20_pre-conference_workshop">http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/April_20_pre-conference_workshop</a>
</p>

<p>
At the separate TCG session, the room was broken up into a main area
and four mini-classrooms where network and data security presentations
could be given hourly. I believe they also provided box lunches and a
USB drive with some of the presentation materials. The slide deck for
the TCG 2008 presentation is here:
<a href="https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/news/events/rsa_2008/">https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/news/events/rsa_2008/</a>.
</p>

<p>
I heard that the attendance was up for RSA 2008, after 2 or 3 years of
modest decline. Pre-conference, the number was projected to be 17,000
 - quite respectable. I hope they don't suffer a significant decline
in this extreme recession.
</p>

<p>
I found the conference very well organized, with things to do for both
full attendees and expo-only types. There was a hacker smack-down
contest setup in the main corridor, and adjacent to it was a
Jeopardy-like contest during day hours.
</p>

<p>
There was also the "crypto commons" lounge with plenty of space to sit down
and charge up that laptop between conference sessions. Rows of tables
allowed more focused work, and there were Ethernet drops too.
</p>

<p>
Most of the tracks were exclusively in single rooms, which minimized travel
for attendees focused on a single area. Besides the two concurrent Hacker
Tracks, there was an ID Management track, a very popular developer security
track, a business track, a sponsor track for items that didn't rate a
keynote, and also a new legal track. Of course, similar content might
appear in different tracks, like presentations on XACML by Oasis Members.
</p>

<p>
One highlight of RSA 2008 was the Cyber Security Town Hall meeting,
open to expo attendees as well. For 2008, this featured a
presentation by Greg Garcia, the Department of Homeland Security
Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Telecommunications (who also
spoke in 2007). Garcia spoke on the then recent Cyberstorm II exercise
results. Unlike Cyberstorm I, which was more like a board game, this
was a real-time cyber-attack scenario. The exercise planning began in
2007 and culminated in March of 2008, involving 40 companies, 9
states, and 5 countries (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, and
the UK). One thing DHS learned from the effort, Garcia said, was just
how important critical vendors and support staff are in an
international emergency. This sentiment was echoed by reps from EMC
and Microsoft at a participant panel after Garcia's talk.  Collect
business cards from your peers at events like RSA, and be prepared for
cyber-disruption, they advised.
</p>

<p>
Presentations and other conference materials for RSA 2008 are locked
up, but many presenters post their own presentations on-line. So,
looking up the presenter and the presentation title may turn up a
presentation you want. This link offers several presentations from RSA
conferences here and in Europe, including "Darwin and Security: What
Evolution Tells Us About the Past and Future of Security:
<a href="http://www.cryptography.com/research/presentations.html">http://www.cryptography.com/research/presentations.html</a>
</p>

<p>
The RSA conference archives have articles and podcasts that are
public.  See it here:
<a href="https://365.rsaconference.com/community/rsaconference_archives">https://365.rsaconference.com/community/rsaconference_archives</a>
</p>

<p>
Also see this link:  Podcast Series: RSA Conference 2008
<a href="https://365.rsaconference.com/blogs/podcast_series_rsa_conference_2008">https://365.rsaconference.com/blogs/podcast_series_rsa_conference_2008</a>
</p>

<p>
I'd also recommend Bryan Sullivan's highly rated presentation from RSA
Conference 2008 on "AJAX Security".  This is an update of the RSA 2008 talk
which was called: "AJAX applications: A blueprint for Disaster" due to the
greatly expanded attack surface.
</p>

<p>
I do have some quibbles about the once spectacular "Cryptographers
Bash", the night before the last day.  I don't know if the ballrooms at
the Marriott Hotel were collectively smaller than the Treasure Island
venue, but the crowd seemed much smaller and the food stations had only
a few variations repeated in all the ballrooms.  It seemed like a step
or two down from previous bashes.
</p>

<p>
While the variety of food and entertainment was already much more
limited, some crazy person thought it best to hold back the desserts
until after 9 pm, long after a sizable chunk of party-goers had
departed to sleep off alcoholic and carnivorous excesses. Perhaps this
reflected some new-felt economy measures, but for the folks who had
eaten something before, it was an excessive wait.  Many of us just
left before they rolled out the sweets.
</p>

<p>
End day end-game: 3 track sessions without a break in the AM, and 2
keynotes in the afternoon. The first keynote featured Hugh Thompson in his
techno-celebrity incarnation. He had also closed out RSA 2007.
</p>

<p>
The real closing honor went to Al Gore and his Green Energy message.
Unfortunately, Gore's keynote was contractually a non-Press event. That
meant all bloggers, tech writers, and local news hacks were escorted out
before he spoke - by security staff. And that included this lowly <em>Linux
Gazette</em> reporter. Of course, some press people had obtained separate
expo passes, and snuck in anyway.
</p>

<p>
That event was not recorded or posted publicly, but Gore also spoke
at the Web 2.0 Summit last November, and that video is in the
conference archive.  Check it out here:
<a href="http://www.web2summit.com/web2008/public/schedule/detail/5068">http://www.web2summit.com/web2008/public/schedule/detail/5068</a>
</p>


<h3>MySQL - No Disappointments</h3>

<p>
The MySQL user conference never disappoints, and is usually tightly
scheduled and well-organized. It features keynotes by technologists and
researchers, and presentations by the MySQL development team and key
partners.  With nearly 2,000 attendees, this is the probably the world's
largest community event for open source database developers and users.
</p>

<p>
Last year's event followed soon after Sun's purchase of MySQL, but the
conference was substantially unchanged.  Former CEO Marten Mickos
addressed concerns and anxieties during and after his keynote, noting
that Sun provided the resources that MySQL needed at that stage of its
growth.
</p>

<p>
Mickos had tripped off concern in the blogosphere and on Slashdot that
MySQL was moving in a proprietary direction by mentioning that "commercial
extensions" planned for 6.0 would only be available to subscribers to
the enterprise edition of MySQL 6.  However, these management additions are
really an outgrowth of the MySQL Network subscription for enterprise
users, and have little impact on the user community.
</p>

<p>
Rick Falkvinge, of Swedish Pirate Party, gave a challenging keynote on
"Copyright Regime vs. Civil Liberties" on the second day. He and his
party consider modern copyrights and their legal regime a threat to
civil liberties, taken from a very long historical viewpoint.
</p>

<p>
Recounting the battles between the medieval church and printing press, and
later the exclusive charter to London printing guild by Henry VIII,
Falkvinge described our rules of intellectual property as protections
almost entirely for the publishers, not the creators. So, it seems not that
much has changed in over 300 years.
</p>

<p>
Originally, copyrights were about public use and public performances of
copyrighted materials.  Now, IP owners like record companies are arguing
against messenger immunity, an idea going back to the Roman Empire. They
are also arguing for the right to inspect private e-mail and to pierce
postal secrets and common carrier privacy. He argued that this undermines
whistle-blowers and freedom of press, which need privacy to protect these
"private" communications. 
</p>

<p>
Some presentations at the user conference dealt with performance
improvements and tuning in the then-new 5.1 release of MySQL, and
other sessions discussed planning for a future 6.0 release, probably
after 2010. That will probably be a major discussion point at the
2009 MySQL user conference.  Here is the schedule for the upcoming
2009 conference:
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/grid">http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/grid</a>
</p>

<p>
One potentially interesting session for 2009 talks is on "Drizzle", a fork
of the MySQL server targeted at Web development and cloud computing.  Monty
Taylor, a very senior MySQL/Sun engineer, is working on it full time.
Drizzle is also discussed at a panel session discussing the MySQL roadmap.
Check out the keynotes and presentations at the O'Reilly archives. (See
below.)

quickly, and these are publicly accessible.

<h1>Playing with Chroot</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/laycock.html">Oscar Laycock</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
It took me a while to realise what chroot does.  As I found out, it runs
a command with the root directory for file name translation changed to the
specified directory. Usually, only root can do this. <a
id="laycock.html_1_back"></a><a href="#laycock.html_1">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
Here is a quick example:
</p>

<p>
First, I use ldd to print the shared libraries needed by my bash: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
    libtermcap.so.2 =&gt; /lib/libtermcap.so.2
    libdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib/libdl.so.2
    libc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/libc.so.6
    /lib/ld-linux.so.2 =&gt; /lib/ld-linux.so.2
</pre>

<p>
Then, I create a directory and copy in the files:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    myroot/bin:
        ls bash
    myroot/lib:
        ld-linux.so.2 libc.so.6 libtermcap.so.2 libdl.so.2
</pre>

<p>
then I just:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    chroot myroot /bin/bash
    cd /
    ls
</pre>

<p>
Note: the bash prompt will very likely say "I have no name!", as there is
no /etc/passwd file in the chrooted structure.
</p>

<h3>In the Kernel</h3>

<p>
The chroot program is part of the GNU shell utilities package. It is tiny,
merely calling the C library function chroot() and then executing its
second argument (or the default /bin/sh) with the C function execvp().
Here, it uses the shell PATH, or "/bin:/usr/bin" if it is not set.  The
chroot library function has its definition in unistd.h:
</p>

<pre class="code">
/* Make PATH be the root directory (the starting point for absolute paths).
      This call is restricted to the super-user.  */
extern int chroot (__const char *__path)
</pre>

<p>
Inside the kernel is the function "sys_chroot". It checks for the
CAP_SYS_CHROOT capability. Then, it simply changes the "current-&gt;fs"
global structure's "rootmnt" and "root" fields to the filename's
"dentry". Other code then uses these fields to determine the root
directory. Have a look in the kernel sources in fs/open.c and
fs/namespace.c (the function name is 'set_fs_root') for more info.
</p>

<h3>Chroot in Linux from Scratch</h3>

<p>
Chroot is a key part of the <a href="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org">Linux
from Scratch</a> (LFS) project, which allows you to build a handmade Linux
system. The actual chroot command there is a bit more complex:
</p>

<pre class="code">
chroot "$LFS" /tools/bin/env -i \ 
    HOME=/root TERM="$TERM" PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \ 
    PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/tools/bin \ 
    /tools/bin/bash --login +h 
</pre>

<p>
The -i option gives an empty environment. Bash hashing is switched off, as
we will be changing the location of the tools.
</p>

<p>
You can see how chroot fits in the whole LFS project. Once we have the
above set up, we take the following steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new partition and base directories (/lib, /bin, /usr, etc.)</li>

<li>Build a new "toolchain" in the partition, comprising binutils (the
assembler and linker), the gcc compiler, and the large glibc (C
library).
</li>

<li>Rebuild gcc, using configure options to use the new glibc and changing
the gcc specs to use the new glibc's dynamic linker. (You usually
"configure", "make", and "make install" when building a program from source
code. Try running "gcc -dumpspecs" to see the mysterious compiler
specs.)</li>

<li>Rebuild binutils using the '--prefix' option of "configure" to use the new glibc.
</li>

<li>Build lots of tools such as bash, core/file utils, make, perl, and so on.</li>

<li><em>CHROOT INTO THE NEW PARTITION'S DIRECTORIES!</em></li>

<li> Rebuild glibc.</li>

<li>Rebuild binutils and gcc, changing the directories to be relative to the chroot top directory.
Build all the tools again.
</li>

<li>Build a kernel.</li>

<li>Add the new partition and kernel to the bootloader.</li>
</ol>

<p>
As you can see, you end up building the basic tools three times! Luckily,
there is another LFS project that automates this process, with scripts.
Even more, the "Beyond Linux from Scratch" project shows you how to add
much more, such as Web servers and the GNOME and KDE desktop environments.
</p>

<h3>A Quick Compiler</h3>

<p>
I am currently building an LFS system on an old laptop a friend gave me.
I started with a kernel, and some small tools (fdisk, ls, cp, etc.),
statically built and squeezed onto a floppy. I then copied across Damn
Small Linux (DSL), floppy by floppy, before setting up a ppp link with a
serial cable. DSL does not have a compiler by default, and I wanted to get
one going quickly. The compiler seemed to conflict with the DSL system (a
smaller old 2.4 kernel with no "thread local storage" for the C library to
use), so I created a chroot directory with just enough to build a simple
"hello world" program. I added the following files. (I believe "crt" stands
for "C run-time", and "begin" files are code added at the start of the
program(?). A prefix or suffix of "s" usually means using shared libraries as
normal.)
</p>

<pre class="code">
myroot/usr
|
+---include:
|       a.out.h ... xlocale.h
|
+---lib:
|       Mcrt1.o Scrt1.o crt1.o crti.o crtn.o gcrt1.o

A common application of the chroot call would be to run a Web or FTP server
chrooted in a directory like /home/www or /home/ftp; this provides an
excellent layer of security, since even a malicious non-root user who
manages to crack that server is stuck in a "filesystem" that contains few
or no tools, no useful files other than the ones already available for
viewing or downloading, and no way to get up "above" the top of that
filesystem. This is referred to as a "chroot jail".
<br>
Do note, however, that allowing a user to log in as root into your chroot
account is <em>not</em> safe: root can break out of a chroot jail with
trivial ease. Please see the following links for more information:

<h1>Bash configuration under Ubuntu</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
[ From a moldering fragment of ancient writings discovered among the
dustbunnies in an abandoned computer room ]<br>
<blockquote><em> "...And when Ubuntu first came into the land, there was much rejoicing
at the nice interface, the ever-reliable "dpkg" package system, the
user-friendly community, and the rest - and all was good. But lo, there came
the darker days of further discovery: those who had, for ages untold, set
up their environment variables and other configuration bits in their
~/.bash_profile suddenly discovered that this was no longer processed.
Furthermore, they found that seeking advice in the wonderful Ubuntu user
forums availed them not. And there arose a cry in those latter days of
'Dude - WHAT HAPPENED TO MY RESOURCE FILES?'" </em></blockquote><br>
With luck, this article will answer that question - and maybe even tell you
what you can do about it.
</p>

<h3>The Way Things Were, and The Way They Are</h3>

<p> Once upon a time, life with Bash under X was easy and predictable: when
you booted your system, the final runlevel either A) handed you a login
console, which started your login shell and read all its init files, at
which point you could start X, or B) ran a graphical display manager that
would start X, fire off a login shell (which read its init files), and hand
control over to your ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession, where you could run up
whatever X configuration, programs, and desktop manager you wanted. Lots of
flexibility, plenty of choices - although that latter could be somewhat
confusing to Linux newcomers - and all was well.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu, however, did something different: the runlevel passes control to
the GNOME display manager (GDM), which runs your desktop manager (GNOME)
and... that's pretty much it. Sure, it's easier for newcomers - but there's
no such thing as control over the shell behavior anymore; in fact, there's
no login shell, which means that the per-user configuration files are no
longer sourced at login time. There's also no standard way to fire up any X
startup-time configuration. What to do?
</p>

<p>
When I switched to Ubuntu, I found the situation unpleasant but dealt with
it in various ways (mostly hacks involving becoming root and messing about
with Deep GDM Magick - not something I'd recommend for a new user, since
it's a good way to quickly make your system unbootable). Recently, though,
I decided to see if it could be fixed within the limits of what the average
user could do.
</p>

<h3>Following the Wily X Beast</h3>

<p>
First, I traced the execution of the X startup scripts in /etc/X11 and
/etc/gdm; this mostly involved chasing the path through the Xsession file,
which sets up variables and loads the external files, then hands control
off to the display manager defined in /etc/X11/default-display-manager
(gdm).  GDM, in turn, runs its own version of Xsession (/etc/gdm/Xsession)
which goes back and reads a series of scripts in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/, and
so on.  In the process, I noticed that one of the resources read by
/etc/gdm/Xsession was a file called "$HOME/.xprofile". Bingo - a
user-controllable resource! There was one catch, however: since the shebang
line at the top of /etc/gdm/Xsession consisted of "#!/bin/sh", this meant
that .xprofile would be read by that shell - not by Bash - which meant that
I had to avoid any "Bashisms" (i.e., structures or commands specific to
bash as contrasted against ones executable by a plain Bourne shell.) The
positive side to this was that Bash would inherit any of the variables set
by the Bourne shell (I guess some kids <em>do</em> listen to their
parents...) Overall, this didn't look like much of a hardship: it just
required a little extra caution. Previously, I would have just edited the
shebang in /etc/gdm/Xsession - but I was determined to do this from the
non-root perspective, so that option was out.
</p>

<p>
Since the default shell under Ubuntu is Bash, I knew that every invocation
of the shell would read the ~/.bashrc file. The traditional use of the two
bash resource files has always been to place the "run once" stuff like
PATH, functions, "mesg n", etc. in ~/.bash_profile, and "run for every
shell" stuff like aliases in ~/.bashrc. The latter was to be kept as small
and simple as possible, since it was run for <em>every</em> shell
invocation. Given this new system, though, that would have to change a bit:
</p>

<ol>
<li> I decided to leave my ~/.bash_profile alone. As a result of Ubuntu's
hackery, it's not being sourced now, but that doesn't mean that it won't be
at some point in the future - and if I move to some other distro, it's
still as valid as it always was.

<li> ~/.xprofile would now take over - more or less - the function of
~/.bash_profile, but would have to follow Bourne syntax. This means that
functions can no longer be exported (as Bourne does not support the "export
-f" convention), but must be moved into ~/.bashrc. Furthermore, since all of
it is being read <strong>before</strong> a console is spawned, any
tty-specific functions (e.g., "mesg") also need to be moved there. I also
made sure not to include the lines from ~/.bash_profile that sourced
~/.bashrc; that would be sourced every time I spawned a shell, but was not
wanted when X was sourcing ~/.xprofile.

<li> ~/.bashrc would now carry a bit more of a load: all the functions would
now be defined there (meaning they don't have to be exported any longer
- every shell gets the whole set as it starts up), and all the console
configuration would be there as well. The alias definitions, which were in
there previously, would stay just as they were.
</ol>

<p>
In essence, what I ended up doing is combining ~/.bash_profile and
~/.bashrc and splitting them back out into ~/.xprofile and ~/.bashrc,
according to the new "rules" that I set up above.
</p>

<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>
Be aware that you'll be "judged harshly" if you make a mistake: any error
in ~/.xprofile will crash your /etc/gdm/Xsession and cause GDM to show you
an error message - something like <em>"Your session lasted for less than 10
seconds. Failed to start the X server (your graphical interface).  It is
likely that it is not set up correctly. [...]"</em> If this happens, go to
'Options/Select session' in GDM and choose 'failsafe', check out your
~/.xsession_errors to find out why it crashed and fix that problem, then
try again.
</p>

<p>
Just below, I'll give (somewhat reduced) examples of my ~/.bash_profile,
~/.bashrc, and ~/.xprofile. The important thing to note is what got moved
out of the former and where it went, or if it went anywhere at all. I'll
highlight the ~/.xprofile lines in blue and the ~/.bashrc lines in green;
anything in bold black got left out because it was no longer applicable.

<h3>Wrap-up</h3>
<p>
In practice, the only concern that I had - i.e., that each shell invocation
would now load more slowly due to a larger ~/.bashrc - did not prove to be
a problem; testing it with 'time bash -c exit' showed a load+exit time of
0.004 seconds. For the moment, I'm willing to consider this problem solved
to my satisfaction.

This month's article covers configuration of the Squid proxy server on RHEL
5.x. Squid is best known for its Web proxy caching functionality; it's
deployed in a vast number of installations in this aspect, and can
drastically reduce server load by reusing commonly requested Web pages. It
is also very handy as an access control mechanism for managing an internal
network. Squid is very effective - but it takes proper configuration to
make it do exactly what you want. This article is intended as a guide for
achieving that configuration.
</p>

<p>
The Squid configuration file that comes packed with version 2.6 for
RHEL-5.x has some 4,325 lines in it. That's a big file, and it's easy to
lose track of what's been done in it. In my opinion, it is best to use
external files to deal with frequent changes - By doing things in this
modular fashion, changes can be done quickly and safely. So, after making a
backup of the original, we'll get started.
</p>


<strong>Access control lists</strong>

<p>
Access control lists work very simply in Squid. These definitions come
directly from the Squid site <a
href="http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/acl/">
http://www.squid-cache.org/Doc/config/acl/</a>, where you will find a
multitude of ACL guidelines and samples. Here are the basics, to get you up
and running:
</p>

<pre>
Defining an Access List

	Every access list definition must begin with an aclname and acltype, 
	followed by either type-specific arguments or a quoted filename that
	they are read from.

	   acl aclname acltype argument ...
	   acl aclname acltype "file" ...

	When using "file", the file should contain one item per line.

	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE.  To make
	them case-insensitive, use the -i option.
</pre>


<p>
Some examples:
</p>

<pre>
<b>acl</b> <i>aclname acltype (ip-address/netmask or .domain.com)</i>

acl   aclname   src         ip-address/netmask 		       # clients IP address
acl   aclname   src         addr1-addr2/netmask 	       # range of addresses
acl   aclname   dst         ip-address/netmask  	       # URL host's IP address
acl   aclname   myip        ip-address/netmask 		       # local socket IP address
acl   aclname   srcdomain   .foo.com       	               # reverse lookup, from client IP
acl   aclname   dstdomain   .foo.com            	       # Destination server from URL
acl   aclname   dstdomain   "/etc/squid/allow/safe-sites"  # file must exist
acl   aclname   srcdom_regex [-i] \.foo\.com ...	       # regex matching client name
acl   aclname   dstdom_regex [-i] \.foo\.com ...	       # regex matching server

http_access allow aclname  # allow access 
http_access deny aclname   # deny access

http_access allow localhost  # allow localhost
http_access deny all         # deny access not specifically allowed
</pre>

<strong>Caching Server</strong>

<p> The image below is an example of how our classrooms are set up here
at my college.  The proxy has multiple network cards in it and acts as 
a simple caching proxy.
</p>
 
<img src="misc/prestia/proxy.jpg" width="338" height="348" alt="Proxy Sample Image">

<p>
Getting Squid up and running as a simple caching proxy web server is
very easy, and can save on bandwidth. We can just change the default
listening port, define a source network address, set that up with an
<code>http_access allow <i>aclname</i></code>, and be done with it.  The
lines we will need to search for and modify in the squid.conf file are
shown below, along with the changes I made.
</p>

<strong>Example of a Basic Proxy Server Configuration</strong>

<pre class="code">
# Squid normally listens on port 3128
#http_port 3128

# Joey 1-12-09 changed http_port to use port 80
http_port 80


#acl our_networks src 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.2.0/24
#http_access allow our_networks

# Joey 1-12-09 changed source network for caching 
acl our_networks src 192.168.7.0/24
http_access allow our_networks
</pre>

<p>
For a caching server, you would merely have to modify the lines as shown
above, adjust the network source address(es) to accommodate your situation,
save the changes, and restart the server. Then, point your internal
machines to this server's IP address and port as their proxy.  Don't forget
to check your firewall to make sure connections are permitted.
</p>

<h3>Configuration for Restricting Sites</h3>

<p>
Let's say our employer wants to prevent all employees from accessing Web
sites that are detrimental to productivity. That is an ideal job for Squid.
</p>

<p>
As always, you should have a good concept of the big picture as pertains to
your company, so that you can design your implementation well. Important
factors include the company's projected growth and overall business
plan: don't build a non-scalable network, for instance. You most certainly do
not want to spend a lot of time fixing problems caused by unexpected
company growth. 
</p>

<p>
The following configuration samples may be used individually or in
combination.  When making changes, it's best to do one at a time, reload
Squid, and <em>test your results</em> before going on.
</p>

<strong>Setting Default Port</strong>

<p>
To get this up and running, there are some things we might want to modify.
For example, the default <code>http_port</code> is 3128: most admins will
want to change that. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Squid normally listens on port 3128
http_port 3128
</pre>

<strong>Visible Hostname</strong>

<p>
The next thing we want to set is the visible_hostname directive. This will
make it easier for you to find the appropriate server if needed, and make
changes if an issue arises. You can specify what you want, or you can have
the return value of gethostname() as stated in the comments. It is mainly
useful for managing clusters. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
#  TAG: visible_hostname
#       If you want to present a special hostname in error messages, etc,
#       define this.  Otherwise, the return value of gethostname()
#       will be used. If you have multiple caches in a cluster and
#       get errors about IP-forwarding you must set them to have individual
#       names with this setting.
#
visible_hostname restrictor1.example.com
</pre>

<strong>Cache Manager</strong>

<p>
You will probably want to have the e-mail address of the cache
administrator displayed. This would, for example, allow a junior member to
receive requests for access, and update the access files as needed. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
# ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  TAG: cache_mgr
#       Email-address of local cache manager who will receive
#       mail if the cache dies. The default is "root".
#
#Default:
# cache_mgr root
# Joey 1-12-09 changed cache_mgr to Orion. He has permissions to 
# authorize and allow new sites and reload Squid. 
cache_mgr orion@example.com
</pre>


<p>
The following configuration examples are various ACL rules that you may 
want to change.
</p>

<strong>Unrestricted Access for a Subnet</strong>

<p>
This one will allow unrestricted access for a subnet, if the server is on
several networks. Set the source <code>src</code> network in a statement
and allow unrestricted access for administrators (or others).  
</p>

<pre class="code">
# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
# Example rule allowing access from your local networks. Adapt
# to list your (internal) IP networks from where browsing should
# be allowed
#acl our_networks src 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.2.0/24
#http_access allow our_networks

# Joey 1-12-09 allow unrestricted access for admin staff on subnet
acl admin src 192.168.5.0/24
http_access allow admin
</pre>

<strong>Using Reference Files to Control Access</strong>

<p>
Here, you need to create a directory and put the files you reference in it.
The files should contain the domains you will allow or deny access to. 
</p>


<pre class="code">
# Joey 1-12-09 otherguys are all other employees and have restrictions
# Edit the referenced file - not this one - to make a change!!!
acl otherguys dstdomain "/etc/squid/approved-sites/safe-sites-gov"
acl otherguys dstdomain "/etc/squid/approved-sites/safe-sites-com"
acl otherguys dstdomain "/etc/squid/approved-sites/safe-sites-net"
acl otherguys dstdomain "/etc/squid/approved-sites/safe-sites-edu"
acl otherguys dstdomain "/etc/squid/approved-sites/safe-sites-org"
acl otherguys dstdomain "/etc/squid/approved-sites/safe-sites-non-us"

http_access allow otherguys

# And finally, deny all other access to this proxy

http_access allow localhost
http_access deny all
</pre>

<p>
This is what our safe-sites-org reference file could contain. Note that the
file should contain one item per line. The comments are strictly for future
reference.
</p>

<pre class="code">
.pbs.org                     # PBS - News
.publicagenda.org            # Public Agenda - News
.ortl.org                    # Oregon Right to Life - Research
.acponline.org               # American College of Physicians - Research
.afsp.org                    # American Foundation Suicide Prevention - Research
.dioceseofnewark.org         # Episcopal Diocese - Research
.internationaltaskforce.org  # Task Force on Euthanasia - Research
.policyalmanac.org           # Almanac of Policy Issues - Research
.content.nejm.org            # The New England Journal of Medicine - Research
.npr.org                     # NPR - News
.ncsl.org                    # National Conference of State Legislatures - Research
</pre>

<strong>ACL to Restrict Allowed User Agents</strong>

<p>
Maybe you've heard by now that Internet Explorer has a lot of
vulnerabilities? Why not just prevent it from being used, altogether? This
ACL does just that.
</p>

<pre class="code">
#acl with_allowed_useragents browser (Firefox) 
acl MSIE browser MSIE
http_access deny MSIE
</pre>

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

<p>
Most new users trying out Squid get intimidated by the number of comments
in the file, and quickly get discouraged when trying to set it up. There are
lots of configurable options in Squid, and it can take time to learn them
and get the setup just right. The way to success is to change only one
option at a time and make sure it works properly before moving on. Students
frequently come into the Red Hat lab, try to configure multiple options at
once, and break Squid because of it. It also pays to use <code>tail -f
/var/log/squid/access.log</code> to watch and read messages. Another good
troubleshooting method is to run Squid in debug mode, with <code>squid -NCd1
</code>. Squid has countless possibilities, and this article goes
into just a few of them. Be sure to read the manual, and see more of what it
can do.

Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.
