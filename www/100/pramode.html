<h1>Python Generator Tricks</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
The Python programming language's support for generators is
described in <a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0255.html">PEP 255</a>.
This article demonstrates a few simple programs which make use of
this feature to do some fun stuff like filtering out prime numbers,
representing an `infinite' series expansion in a finite way, applying
the Euler `accelerator'  to make a series converge faster etc. Many of the programs
which I describe here have been taken from `test_generators.py' which is
available with the Python source distribution. A few ideas have been
stolen from the Computer Science classic, <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp">Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>.

<h2>What is a Generator?</h2>
<p>
A generator is, simply put, a function which can stop whatever
it is doing at an arbitrary point in its body, return a value
back to the caller, and, later on, resume from the point it
had `frozen' and merrily proceed as if nothing had happened.
Here is a simple example:
<p>
[ <a href="misc/pramode/gen1.py.txt">Listing 1</a> ]
<pre>

from __future__ import generators

def foo():
	print 'hello'
	yield 1
	print 'world'
	yield 2

</pre>
<p>
I am using Python 2.2 - in order to use the generator facility, a special `import' 
statement should be placed at the very beginning of the file. It may not be required
in later versions.
<p>
Note the `yield' keyword. A function which contains a yield statement anywhere in its
body is considered to be special by the Python interpreter - it is treated differently
from ordinary functions. Let's see how:
<pre>

&gt;&gt;&gt; from gen1 import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a
&lt;generator object at 0x8158db8&gt;

</pre>

<p>
We note that calling the function did not result in the function getting executed.
Instead, the Python interpreter gave us a `generator object'. This is one of the 
implications of using the yield statement in the body of the function. Now, what do
we do with this generator object?
<pre>

&gt;&gt;&gt; a.next()
hello
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.next()
world
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.next()
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "&lt;stdin&gt;" line 1, in ?
StopIteration

</pre>
<p>
Calling a.next() resulted in the function beginning its execution - it prints hello and comes
to a dead stop at the `yield' statement, returning the value 1 to the caller. The function
has gone back to its caller, but its `local state' has been fully preserved. Another invocation
of a.next results in the function restarting from where it had stopped earlier - it prints
`world' and stops after returning the value 2 to the caller. Yet another invocation of a.next
results in the function `falling off' the end - because our function is a special `generator
function', this will result in an exception, StopIteration, being raised.
<p>
Let's now try running a for loop on our generator:
<pre>

&gt;&gt;&gt; a = foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in a:
...    print i
...
hello
1
world
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; 

</pre>
<p>
The for loop works by invoking a.next() and assigning the value obtained to i,
which then gets printed. The strings 'hello' and 'world' get printed as 
part of the execution of `foo'. It would also be interesting to try out 
invoking the `list' function on the generator object - we will get a list
[1,2] as the result. In both cases (for loop as well as `list'), iteration
stops when the StopIteration exception is raised.
<p>
The body of a generator function should not contain a return statement of the
form `return expr' - a simple `return' is allowed. The <a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0255.html">
PEP </a> discusses this and many more things. You should try running the
following code:
<p>
[ <a href="misc/pramode/gen2.py.txt">Listing 2</a> ]
<pre>
from __future__ import generators

def foo(n):
	if (n &lt; 3): yield 1
	else: return
	yield 2
</pre>
<p>Try running a for loop over the generator objects returned by say, foo(10) and
foo(1). Also, try calling next() on these objects.

<h2>Representing infinite sequences</h2>
<p>
Generators present us with some fun ways to manipulate infinite sequences -
though some people might question their practical utility! As far as we 
are concerned, being fun is reason enough!
<p>
[ <a href="misc/pramode/gen3.py.txt">Listing 3</a> ]
<pre>
from __future__ import generators

def foo():
	i = 0
	while 1:
		yield i
		i = i + 1
</pre>
<p>
What we have above is the simplest possible `infinite' generator. Try calling
next() on the generator object returned by calling `foo'. Give this object as
an argument to a `for' loop - you will see that the loop keeps on printing 
numbers. If you wish Python to eat up memory, try running `list(foo())'. Try
writing a more interesting function, say a Fibonacci series generator.
<p>
Here is an infinite series of alternating positive and negative terms:
<p>
1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...
<p>
This series converges to PI/4. We will write a Python generator for
it.
<pre>

def pi_series():
	sum = 0
	i = 1.0; j = 1
	while(1):
		sum = sum + j/i
		yield 4*sum
		i = i + 2; j = j * -1

</pre>
<p>
Each `yield' statement keeps on returning a better approximation
for PI. Test it out by calling `next' on the generator returned
by invoking pi_series. We note that the series does not converge
very fast.
<p>
It would be convenient to have a function which would return
the first N values yielded by a generator.
<pre>

def firstn(g, n):
	for i in range(n):
		yield g.next()

</pre>
<p>
Note that the first argument to this function is 
a generator object. Here is what I got when I tried
out `list(firstn(pi_series(), 8))':
<pre>

[4.0, 2.666666666666667, 3.4666666666666668, 2.8952380952380956, 
3.3396825396825403, 2.9760461760461765, 
3.2837384837384844, 3.0170718170718178]

</pre>

<p>
We can apply a `sequence accelerator' to convert a series of terms
to a new series which converges to the original value much faster.
One such accelerator, invented by Leonhard Euler, is shown below:

<P>
<IMG ALT="Sn+1 - [(Sn+1 - Sn)*(Sn+1 - Sn)]/[Sn-1 - 2*Sn + Sn+1]"
     SRC="misc/pramode/euler.jpg" WIDTH="159" HEIGHT="35">

<P>
<TT>(Sn+1)</TT> stands for the (n+1)th term, <TT>(Sn-1)</TT> for the
(n-1)th term.

<p>
If Sn is the n'th term of the original sequence, then the 
accelerated sequence has terms as shown in the equation
above. 

<p>
Let's try writing a generator function which accepts a generator
object and returns an `accelerated' generator object.

<pre>

def euler_accelerator(g):
	s0 = g.next() # Sn-1
	s1 = g.next() # Sn
	s2 = g.next() # Sn+1
	while 1:
		yield s2 - (sqr(s2 - s1))/(s0 - 2*s1 + s2)
		s0, s1, s2 = s1, s2, g.next()

</pre>

<p>
Here is what I got when I tried printing the first few terms of this
series:

<pre>

[3.166666666666667, 3.1333333333333337, 3.1452380952380956, 
3.1396825396825401, 3.1427128427128435, 3.1408813408813416, 
3.1420718170718178, 3.1412548236077655]

</pre>

Note that the series is converging much faster! You can get the
program as a whole:

<h2>The Eratosthenes sieve</h2>
<p>
A cute idea for `filtering out' prime numbers, invented by
the Alexandrian mathematician Eratosthenes, works as follows.
Suppose you want to find out all prime numbers below, say,
1000. You first cancel all multiples of 2 (except 2) from a
list 1..1000. Now you will cancel all multiples of 3 (except 3).
4 has already been canceled, as it is a multiple of 2. Now you
will take off all multiples of 5, except 5. And so on. Ultimately,
what remains in the list would be prime numbers! 
<p>
Let's start with a generator which gives us all integers 
from `i' onwards:
<pre>

def intsfrom(i):
	while 1:
		yield i
		i = i + 1

</pre>

Now let's write a generator which will eliminate all multiples
of a number `n' from a sequence:

<pre>

def exclude_multiples(n, ints):
	for i in ints:
		if (i % n):
			yield i

</pre>

An invocation of the generator, say, list(firstn(exclude_multiples(2, intsfrom(1)), 5)), will
give us the list [1,3,5,7,9].

<p>
Now, its time for us to build our `sieve'.
<pre>

def sieve(ints):
	while 1:
		prime = ints.next()
		yield prime
		ints = exclude_multiples(prime, ints)

</pre>

You can get the source file containing these function
definitions from here:

<p>
[ <a href="misc/pramode/gen5.py.txt">Listing 5</a> ]

<h2>Recursive Generators</h2>
<p>
Generator functions can call themselves recursively. It takes some time
getting used to it. Let's try analyzing the way the following functions
work:

<p>
[ <a href="misc/pramode/gen6.py.txt">Listing 6</a> ]
<pre>
from __future__ import generators

def abc():
	a = deff()
	for i in a:
		yield i
	yield 'abc'

def deff():
	a = ijk()
	for i in a:
		yield i
	yield 'deff'

def ijk():
	for i in (1,2,3):
		yield i
	yield 'ijk'

</pre>
An invocation of abc will yield a generator object. Calling `next' on it 
would result in `abc' starting execution. The very first line of `abc' invokes
`deff' which returns a generator object. After that, a.next() is invoked as
part of the very first iteration of the for loop. This results in `deff' starting
execution the same way. The body of `deff' builds a generator object by calling
`ijk' and calls its `next' method as part of the for loop. This results
in `ijk' starting execution and yielding 1, `deff' also yields 1, and `abc' also
yields 1. Calling the `next' method (of the generator object returned by
invoking `abc') two more times will result in the values 2 and 3 getting 
propagated up. Yet another invocation will result in the string `ijk' 
propagating up the call stack because the for loop in the body of `ijk'
has terminated. Calling `next' again will result in the body of `ijk'
terminating, with the result that the `for' loop in `deff' gets a 
StopIteration exception, which results in that loop terminating and
the function yielding the string `deff'. Subsequent invocation of
`next' will result in `abc' being returned to the top level caller. The
final invocation of next (again, note that we are invoking `next' on
the object returned by calling `abc') will result in the caller
getting a StopIteration exception because the body of `abc' has
also been executed in full.

<p>
Let's now look at Guido's binary tree example. The classical inorder
traversal is coded as below:
<pre>

def inorder(t):
	if t:
		for x in inorder(t.left):
			yield x
		yield t.dat
		for x in inorder(t.right):
			yield x

</pre>
Let's think of invoking inorder on a tree with only one node (say containing
data 50).  Doing `for x in inorder(t.left)' is same as:
<pre>

a = inorder(t.left)
for x in a:
	....

</pre>
Because t.left is 0, calling a.next() (which the for loop does) results
in a StopIteration exception - this terminates the loop immediately. The
next statement in the body is `yield t.dat' - this returns 50. The next
for loop also terminates immediately because of a StopIteration. It should
be easy to visualize the way the code works for more complex tree structures.
Here is the source for the program - [<a href="misc/pramode/gen7.py.txt"> Listing 7 </a>].

<h2>Zero crossing detector</h2>
<p>
Let's define a `signal' as a stream of positive and negative
integers. 
<p>
1 2 -1 -4 3 2 -3 -4 2 3 4 -2 ...
<p>
A zero-crossing detector outputs a signal which describes the zero crossings of
the input signal - the resulting signal is +1 whenever the input signal changes
from negative to positive, -1 whenever input signal changes from positive to
negative and 0 otherwise. We shall assume that 0 is positive.
<p>
Here is the zero-cross detector:
<p>
[ <a href="misc/pramode/gen8.py.txt"> Listing 8 </a> ]
<pre>

def zerocross(g):
	a = g.next()
	b = g.next()
	while 1:
		yield cross_detect(a, b)
		a, b = b, g.next()

</pre>

If the signal is coming from a sensor, noise will lead to spurious zero
crossings. So, we can think of `smoothing' the signal (using some form
of `moving average' computation) and then detecting the zero crossings.
