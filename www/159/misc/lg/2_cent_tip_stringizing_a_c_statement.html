I recently discovered you could "stringize" a whole C++ or C statement with the pre-processor. For example:
</p>

<pre>
#define TRACE(s) cerr &lt;&lt; #s &lt;&lt; endl; s
or:
#define TRACE(s) printf("%s\n", #s); s
 
....
TRACE(*p = '\0');
p--;
</pre>

<p>
(I found this in "Thinking in C++, 2nd ed. Volume 1" by Bruce Eckel,
available for free at <a href='http://www.mindview.net'>http://www.mindview.net</a>. By the way, it seems a good
introduction to C++ for C programmers with lots of useful exercises.
There is also a free, but slightly old, version of the official Qt book
(the C++ framework used in KDE), at
<a href='http://www.qtrac.eu/C++-GUI-Programming-with-Qt-4-1st-ed.zip'>http://www.qtrac.eu/C++-GUI-Programming-with-Qt-4-1st-ed.zip</a>. It is a
bit difficult for a C++ beginner, and somewhat incomplete without the
accompanying CD, but rewarding none the less.)
</p>

<p>
Bruce Eckel adds: "of course this kind of thing can cause problems,
especially in one-line for loops:
</p>

<pre>
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++)
TRACE(f(i));
</pre>

<p>
Because there are actually two statements in the TRACE( ) macro, the
one-line for loop executes only the first one. The solution is to
replace the semicolon with a comma in the macro." 
</p>

<p>
However, when I try this with a declaration. I get a compiler error:
<pre>
	TRACE(char c = *p);
 
s.cpp:17: error: expected primary-expression before 'char'
s.cpp:17: error: expected `;' before 'char'
</pre>

<p>
I'm not sure exactly why!?

Better yet, always use braces with your for/if/else/while statements, even if 
there is only a single line now. It avoids later editing errors and problems 
with "too clever by half macros.

<p>
It's obvious. Do the substitution and you get:
</p>

<pre>
cerr &lt;&lt;  char c = *p &lt;&lt; endl; char c = *p;
</pre>

<p>
which is obviously garbage. It's never going to work where the statement is a 
declaration.

&gt; I thought it was 
&gt; because the comma operator separates statements not declarations. For
&gt; example:for (i = 0; i = 0; ; i++, j++) {}I'm learning C++ so I can't say
&gt; for sure!
</pre>

<p>
Yes. I missed out the stringizing of the part inside cerr. It is still garbage 
because, as you say, "the comma operator separates statements not 
declarations".
