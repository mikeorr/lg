<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
Here is a way to copy a partition which is mounted <strong>without</strong> copying
all the other partitions that are under it.
</p>

<p>
Let /patha be the mountpoint of the partition from which you want to
copy (it could even be the root path /).
</p>

<p>
Let /dev/new be the device to which you want to copy the data.
<pre>
	mkdir /var/tmp/src
	# The bind mount is the crucial thing!
	mount --bind /patha /var/tmp/src
	mkdir /var/tmp/target
	mount /dev/new /var/tmp/target
	cd /var/tmp/src
	# I find this a neat way to copy all files
	# and permissions
	find . | cpio -pdum /var/tmp/target
	umount /dev/new
	umount /var/tmp/src
	rmdir /var/tmp/{src,target}
</pre>
And you are done!
I hope the above commands are self-explanatory. If not, then I can
explain further.
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

I'm not sure what this does that wouldn't be done by 'cp -ax'?

<p>
Lots.  cp -ax wouldn't handle non-regular files, and would suffer the
same file limit restructions as shell globbing would, hence you'd have
to mitigate it with xargs, etc.
</p>

<p>
Note that the tar equivalent would be something like:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
(tar cf - *) | ( cd /target; tar xfp -)
</pre>
Plus various different incantations thereof.

...e.g., '-mount' or '-xdev', which tell 'find' not to descend into
directories on mounted FSes. I've never used either of these options, so
I may be off, but I recalled seeing them in the 'find' man page and
thinking "oooh, nifty tool."

Plus the added dis-incentive that this "-x" switch is something handled
by libc rather than the kernel. This means:
	(0) There may be "hidden" directories that have been mounted over
	    which are seen by the "--bind" approach but are not seen
	    by the libc approach.
	(a) It may not work with "diet" libraries.
	(b) It may not work with "busybox" versions.
	(c) since it involves system calls it may be slower.
These assertions are untested but I believe (0) <strong>must</strong> logically be
true!
