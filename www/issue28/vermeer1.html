<H1>Linux Fax for Dummies :-)</H1>
<H4>By <a href="mailto:mv@fgi.fi">Martin Vermeer</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  

<I>If you are like me, you may be all the time on the lookout for nifty
little utilities and the like, that might make life easier and more pleasant
for end users. I came into Linux rather late in the process, February 1997,
and although I know how to program (and have written a few handy little
things too, using this great new language<B> tcl/tk</B></I>)<I>, due to
time constraints, I have felt no strong inclination to join ranks with
the hacker community. Heck, I never even compiled my own kernel!</I>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>For someone as ancient as me (vintage 1953) it is probably better to
concentrate on things that I am good at, without requiring a substantial
investment in time. So, I have been looking around, learning <B>tcl/tk</B>,
and writting little things that make life easier especially for people
that are not very computer literate. Because, what is happening now to
Linux, is that it is gaining a technically less sophisticated user base.
We should adapt to this. Part of this adaptation is taking place; the new,
gorgeous-looking desktop environments such as KDE and Gnome are soon becoming
standard stuff on the Linux desktop, and more and more software is acquiring
a graphical user interface.<B> tcl/tk</B>, <B>perl/tk</B>, <B>gtk</B>,
and <B>java</B>, are among the tools that make this possible. <B>tcl/tk</B>
especially is ideal for "glueing" already existing command-line oriented
utilities together into great-looking desktop thingies.

<P>A recommended fax package for Linux is <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">fax/efax/efix</FONT>
by Ed Casas.<FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"> fax</FONT> is an ordinary
shell script, containing calls to the binary modules <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">efax</FONT>
(taking care of the difficult, low-level faxing stuff) and <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">efix</FONT>
(taking care of some file format conversions needed). They work, but are
command-line stuff; not for dummies.

<P>For sending faxes using <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">efax</FONT>
you can use <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">LyX</FONT>, the graphical
word processor running on top of <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">LaTeX</FONT>.
I can really recommend this word processor: especially the new release
0.12&nbsp; is great, with lots of new features including on-the-fly localization.
See the <A HREF="../issue27/ayers5.html">review by Larry Ayers</A> in the last issue of Linux Gazette, and a
picture (I couldn't resist) below.

<P><IMG SRC="./gx/vermeer/lyx.jpeg" ALT="[lyx picture]" HEIGHT=393 WIDTH=569>

<P>For receiving faxes, it is possible to install <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">efax</FONT>
as a daemon through the bootup script (see man page), so it continually
waits for faxes to come in. It is even possible to do this in such a way,
that it does not get in the way of outgoing traffic, e.g. an Internet connection.
Then, when this connection closes, the deamon starts again listening to
the serial port.

<P>Any faxes received will be stored into a spool directory, typically
(Red Hat)<FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"> /var/spool/fax/</FONT>. You
can make <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">xbiff</FONT> or <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">xmailbox</FONT>
look if faxes have arrived into the spool directory, and signal it to the
user. I haven't tried this, though. There are various ways to read messages
from the spool directory. Ed Casas' script <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">fax</FONT>
can be used, but is <I>so</I> unbecoming. I really would love it if there
was a graphical client to do this!

<P>So... I decided to do a search, an extensive one, using Alta Vista.
No luck.&nbsp; Following links, I found a number of&nbsp; listings of fax
and communication software, including Hylafax, which is a fax server application
for network use, undoubtedly good, but not what I was looking for. Then
I decided, OK, it cannot be too hard to write a thing like this myself.
I started coding, and after three hours or so, I had the skeleton of a
working graphical fax client running.

<P>I wanted my skeleton script to use the existing utility <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">viewfax</FONT>
(a GNU product) to display fax pages on the screen. The program -- found
in the RPM package <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">mgetty-viewfax</FONT>
--&nbsp; is very fast and very convenient, but with a slightly "emacsish"
user interface. Well, what the heck. I read the man page and found there
a reference to <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">faxview.tcl</FONT>, a <B>tcl/tk</B>
"graphical front end" to viewfax. Precisely what I was trying to write!
<BR>.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./gx/vermeer/faxview.jpeg" ALT="[faxview GUI]" HEIGHT=479 WIDTH=444></CENTER>


<P>I downloaded the <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">faxview-1.0</FONT>
tarball from the ftp server at <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier"><A HREF="ftp://ftp.UL.BaWue.DE/pub/purple/fax">ftp://ftp.UL.BaWue.DE/pub/purple/fax</A></FONT>,
extracted the files <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">faxview</FONT> (the
<B>tcl/tk</B> script) and <FONT FACE="Courier New,Courier">faxview.1</FONT>
(the man page) from it. It worked great (see picture)! The author of this
software is Ralph Schleicher from Ulm, Germany. So much for reinventing
the wheel... this really raises some questions:
<UL>
<LI>
Do we really <I>know</I> all the Linux software that is out there?</LI>

<LI>
Are many authors too modest about their products, in other words, do they
rather keep their software -- even just "scripts" -- to themselves, where
a professional Windows programmer would have happily marketed commercially
a Visual Basic script of the same quality?</LI>

<LI>
Is it really easy enough to post announcements and even source code for
new software, for people that have not been part of the "circuit", and
is the infrastructure in place to make people find the information that
they need on the existence of such software?&nbsp; Referring to my above
negative Alta Vista and software list experience.</LI>
</UL>
If anyone has any useful software to refer me to, found by accident against
the slings and arrows of poor posting... let me know! What is your favourite
"under-advertised" Linux software?
