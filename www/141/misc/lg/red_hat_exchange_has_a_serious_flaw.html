</pre>
Dear Ashlee:
</p>

<p>
I note with interest your recent articles in ElReg: "Red Hat's Exchange
roars like a muted lamb" and "Red Hat RHXes out to open source
partners".  However, I'd like to point out one problem you haven't yet
covered: 
</p>

<p>
Many of Red Hat Exchange's offerings, although all are implied to be open
source, are in fact nothing of the kind.  For example, the offered
products from Zimbra, SugarCRM, Compiere, CentricCRM, and GroundWork are
very clearly under proprietary licences of various descriptions.
</p>

<p>
When I attended Red Hat's RHEL5 product launch in San Francisco on March
14, I heard RHX described for the first time, immediately noticed the
problem, and quietly called it to the attention of Red Hat CTO Brian
Stevens.  Stevens acknowledged the point, and said (loosely paraphrased)
that their Web pages should to be adjusted to make clear that not all
RTX offerings are open source -- which is indeed a sensible remedy, but
it hasn't yet happened.
</p>

<p>
I also attempted to call Red Hat's attention to the problem via the
designated RHX feedback forum, at
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/feedback/feedback.jspa">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/feedback/feedback.jspa</a> .  (You'll note my
comment near the bottom.)
</p>

<p>
I'm sure it's an honest slip-up, but, accidentally or not, Red Hat has
mislead its customers for the past several months on this matter, and is
continuing to do so.
</p>

<p>
Best Regards,
Rick Moen

Quoting Ashlee Vance (ashlee.vance@theregister.co.uk):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Thanks so much for this, mate. Will investigate.
</pre>

<p>
Sure.  In case it will help:  
</p>

<p>
Most if not all of those codebases are ASP (Web app) code, which poses a
thorny problem:  Suppose you are, say, Google, and wish to behave
benignly towards open source with your Web apps.  You deploy a Web 2.0 
hosted application, and release its source code to the community under a
proper, forkable licence such as BSD / MIT X11 (simple permissive type)
or GPLv2 (copyleft), that fully satisfies the Open Source Definition.
For the sake of illustration, let's assume GPLv2.
</p>

<p>
Google's competitor EvilCo swoops by, grabs the source tarball, modifies
it extensively behind closed doors, and deploys it under a completely
different name as a hosted Web app (product/service) of its own, bearing
very little resemblance to Google's original application.  Let's say
that EvilCo nowhere mentions its borrowing from Google, and that EvilCo
doesn't provide anyone outside its employees access to the modified
source code.
</p>

<p>
Probably, Google would never even realise that EvilCo had deployed a
derivative of its work.  If it came to realise that fact, and asked
EvilCo for a copy of the matching (modified) source code, EvilCo could
entirely lawfully say "No."
</p>

<p>
Wait, you ask:  Wouldn't that violate clause 3b of copyright owner
Google's licensing terms under GPLv2, and hence constitute the tort of
copyright violation?  Nope:  EvilCo has no copyleft obligation to
make available source code unless and until it <em>distributes</em> the work or
a derivative of it.  And ASP/Web deployment doesn't require code
distribution.
</p>

<p>
That's the bone of the matter:  A reputable, open-source-respecting Web
2.0 firm that releases source code under (most) open source licences is
at the mercy of less-scrupulous competitors creating, Web-deploying, and
commercially exploiting undisclosed, proprietary forks of its creations.
</p>

<p>
So, the problem is real.  The solution so far has been problematic:
</p>

<p>
Faced with this dilemma, a group of ASP firms lead by SugarCRM has
started creating what Bruce Perens (and I) call "badgeware" licences.
Typically, these are created by adding proprietary addenda to Mozilla
Public License 1.1 -- addenda that require third-party users to retain 
graphical and linkback advertisements of the "original contributor" on
(typically) "all user interface screens" on any derivative works.
Often, the addenda also explicitly deny third-party users any rights to
the "original contributor" trademarks embodied in the graphical
advertisements and other mandated advertising.  (This is seen by many
including me as a deliberate attempt to impair use in <em>commerce</em> by 
third parties:  You have to fear trademark-infringement lawsuits.)
</p>

<p>
There are about a dozen or so "badgeware" firms in the SugarCRM camp.  
I have written, off and on, about the problem in _Linux Gazette_:
<a href="../../../134/moen.html">http://linuxgazette.net/134/moen.html</a>
<a href="../../../135/misc/lg/talkback_134_moen_html.html">http://linuxgazette.net/135/misc/lg/talkback_134_moen_html.html</a>
</p>

<p>
There have been new developments, that I have not yet covered in _Linux
Gazette_:  After extensive discussion of the modified-MPL licences, none
have yet been OSI-approved (actually, most of the firms have very
scrupulously avoided <em>submitting</em> them for OSI scrutiny), and consensus
is so far strongly against them being OSD-compliant, despite much futile
arm-twisting by big-money VC interests behind some of them.  <em>Some</em> of
the firms are showing some signs of an attempt at good-faith compliance
without putting themselves at the mercy of EvilCo ploys -- but things
are not yet fully worked out.
</p>

<p>
Also, OSI President Michael Tiemann has finally put his foot down and
deplored the practice of all such firms of promoting themselves as "open
source" when their licences aren't OSI approved and in general they are
plainly proprietary on their face:  <a href="http://opensource.org/node/163">http://opensource.org/node/163</a>
</p>

<p>
I intend to catch up on recent developments soon, but haven't yet done
so.
</p>

<p>
I should also note that <em>some</em> ASP/Web firms aren't even within a
country mile of OSD compliance, and offer only what are absolutely
without any room for dispute proprietary programs:  CentricCRM, which
you'll note is featured on Red Hat Exchange, would be a classic example.
</p>

<p>
I hope this explanation helps.
</p>
