<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LPI to launch new LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 certification programs</h3>

<p>The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) has completed an update of the 
exam objectives for its popular LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 certification 
programs. New versions of these exams will be published and available 
on April 1, 2009. Exams taken before that date will continue to be 
based on the older, current objectives and materials.</p>

<blockquote>"This update of our LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 certification program is a 
significant milestone in LPI's history and exemplifies our extensive, 
ongoing and transparent communications with industry leaders and the 
Open Source community on what are the necessary skill sets for a Linux 
professional," said Jim Lacey, President and CEO of the Linux 
Professional Institute. Mr. Lacey noted many of the changes to the 
exams are the result of extended consultations with partner 
organizations in the field and others that support LPI's certification 
program: "As an example, we have broadened the scope of the LPIC-1 
exams to appeal to a wider range of Linux professionals while focusing 
in-depth system administration and networking skills in the LPIC-2 
certification."</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Lacey also indicated that the increasing global relevance of the 
LPIC program has made it necessary that these new exams are much more 
sensitive to non-English exam candidates and include a greater number 
of questions around localization, internationalization, and 
accessibility issues.</p>

<p>Revised exam objectives for LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 are available on LPI's 
public wiki: 
<a href='https://group.lpi.org/publicwiki/bin/view/Examdev/WebHome'>https://group.lpi.org/publicwiki/bin/view/Examdev/WebHome</a>.</p>

<p>The Linux Professional Institute also announced in December 
improvements to its growing training partner program. LPI has more 
than 220 approved training partners in 35 countries around the globe. 
In the last six months alone, LPI has added training partners in 
Belgium, Canada, Hong Kong, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, the Philippines, 
Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, and the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Fedora 10 Adds Security and Virtualization</h3>

<p>The Fedora Project, a community-supported open source collaboration 
project, announced the availability of Fedora 10 in late November.</p>

<p>Fedora 10 is the tenth community release in five years. It 
features substantial virtualization improvements for remote 
installation and management of storage provisioning. These features 
will make system administration of virtual machine hosts and guests 
easier and more capable of automation, especially as they are 
integrated into Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Additionally, Fedora 10 
includes NetworkManager connection sharing, allowing laptop users with 
an Ethernet or mobile broadband connection to provide Internet routing 
to others through the laptop wireless interface, for instant 
collaboration anywhere, anytime.</p>

<p>This release includes the premiere of a new graphical boot system 
called Plymouth, designed to speed up the boot process by taking 
advantage of a new kernel mode setting feature. </p>

<p>Fedora 10 also features a new security auditing and detection toolkit 
called SecTool, and a brand-new set of Python bindings that allow 
programmers to use the FIPS-140 validated NSS library for rapid 
development of secure applications. The distribution also extends the 
Live USB persistence feature that was pioneered in Fedora 9, adding 
support for a separate user data area with optional encryption for the 
ultimate experience in secure, portable computing.</p>

<p>Among its new features, Fedora 10 includes the new OpenOffice.org 3.0 
and GNOME 2.24.1;  a rewritten audio system for faster response and 
lower power usage; a full set of appliance building tools; and support 
for more PC hardware.</p>

<p>For more information on Fedora 10, to download the distribution or to 
join this community effort, please visit <a href='http://fedoraproject.org/'>http://fedoraproject.org/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SUSE Linux Real Time Sets Performance Record</h3>

<p>In independent tests performed by the Securities Technology Analysis 
Center (STAC), SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time delivered the lowest 
mean and maximum latencies ever recorded with the Reuters Market Data 
System (RMDS), as well as the highest RMDS throughput for a two-socket 
server. These impressive results for Novell were significantly better 
than similar benchmark tests performed by STAC on other Linux and UNIX 
operating systems.</p>

<p>In its newly-released report, STAC measured the performance of a 
market data stack based on the Reuters Market Data System when running 
on SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time and compared it to the same stack 
using a general purpose operating system and gigabit Ethernet 
technologies.</p>

<p>According to the independent tests performed by STAC, SUSE Linux 
Enterprise Real Time delivered 10.1 million updates per second, the 
highest throughput ever recorded on their standard benchmark test for 
a two-socket Linux or UNIX system configuration - more than 670 
percent higher than an alternative solution using a general purpose 
operating system and gigabit Ethernet technologies. In the same tests, 
SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time achieved the lowest mean RMDS 
latencies recorded to date by STAC on Linux or UNIX systems at nearly 
all throughput rates. SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time was able to 
maintain under 0.67 milliseconds of mean latency at rates of up to 
750,000 updates per second and maximum latencies never exceeded 3.01 
milliseconds.</p>

<p>The tests were conducted using the latest HP blade servers and Intel 
Quad-Core Xeon processors, along with Voltaire InfiniBand hardware and 
Voltaire Messaging Accelerator (VMA) software. The specific solution 
independently tested by STAC is available for customers to purchase 
and implement today and is fully supported by Novell and its partners.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Flash Security Patch</h3>

<p>Adobe has issued critical security patches for the Linux 
version of its Flash player. Older versions have a vulnerability can 
be exploited through a specially crafted SWF file. The vulnerability 
affects Adobe Flash Player versions 10.0.12.36 and earlier and 
9.0.151.0 and earlier.</p>

<p>Linux users are urged to update the Flash Player on their systems to 
version 10.0.15.3.</p>

<p>More information about this update can be found on <a href='http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb08-24.html'>http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb08-24.html</a></p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Contributes Data Integrity Code to Linux Community</h3>

<p>To advance Linux use in enterprise, Oracle contributed block I/O 
data integrity infrastructure code to the 2.6.27 Linux kernel in 
December. This open source code, in part developed with Emulex, 
exposes key data protection information to the Linux kernel. This can 
enable subsystems for the first time to utilize crucial data integrity 
features - and now extend protection from applications to storage to 
Linux operating system - for comprehensive data integrity 
capabilities across the entire software stack. This can reduce system 
downtime and provides cost savings to end users while meeting more 
stringent government regulations.</p>
 
<p>Oracle and Emulex are also working together to conduct an early 
adopter program where a select group of customers can test the 
end-to-end data integrity features in real world environments. </p>
 
<p>Additional Details:<br />
    * This code contribution includes generic support for data 
    integrity at the block and file system layers, as well as support 
    for the T10 Protection Information Model (formerly known as DIF) 
    and the Data Integrity Extensions.<br />
    * The Data Integrity Extensions, developed in collaboration with 
    Emulex, augment the T10 standard by allowing protection 
    information to be transferred to and from host memory, enabling 
    end-to-end data integrity protection.<br />
    * The Oracle-developed code is the first implementation of the T10 
    Protection Information Model standard for an operating system. </p>

<p>The INCITS/T10 "Protection Information Model" will help provide 
end-to-end data protection for block devices.  Read more at Oracle's page:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Toshiba, IBM, and AMD Develop World's Smallest SRAM Cell</h3>

<p>Toshiba Corporation , IBM, and AMD have together developed a Static 
Random Access Memory (SRAM) cell that has an area of only 0.128 square 
micrometers (&micro;m<sup>2</sup>), the world's smallest functional SRAM cell that 
makes use of fin-shaped Field Effect Transistors (FinFETs).  This cuts 
the size of SRAM cells by more than 50% while improving memory 
stability.  The technology positions FinFETs as an attractive 
structure for SRAMs in the 22nm node and beyond.</p>

<p>SRAM cells are circuit components in most systems-level, large-scale 
integrated circuits such as microprocessors, and smaller SRAM cells 
can support smaller, faster processors that consume less power. The 
technology was announced on December 16 in a technical paper presented 
at the 2008 International Electron Devices Meeting 
(<a href='http://www.his.com/~iedm/general/'>http://www.his.com/~iedm/general/</a>) in San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>Researchers from the three companies fabricated a highly scaled FinFET 
SRAM cell using HKMG (the high-k dielectric and metal gates process). It is the smallest nonplanar-FET SRAM cell yet 
achieved: at 0.128&micro;m<sup>2</sup>, the integrated cell is more than 50 percent 
smaller than the 0.274&micro;m<sup>2</sup> nonplanar-FET cell previously reported. To 
achieve this goal, the team optimized the processes, especially for 
depositing and removing materials, including HKMG from vertical 
surfaces of the non-planar FinFET structure.</p>

<p>The researchers also investigated the stochastic variation of FinFET 
properties within the highly scaled SRAM cells and simulated SRAM cell 
variations at an even smaller cell size. They verified that FinFETs 
without channel doping improved transistor characteristic variability 
by more than 28 percent. In simulations of SRAM cells of
0.063&micro;m<sup>2</sup> 
area, equivalent to or beyond the cell scaling for the 22nm node, the 
results confirmed that the FinFET SRAM cell is expected to offer a 
significant advantage in stable operation compared to a planar-FET 
SRAM cell at this generation.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Adobe AIR 1.5 Now Available for Linux</h3>

<p>In December, Adobe Systems announced availability of Adobe AIR 1.5 
software for Linux operating systems. Adobe AIR 1.5, a key component 
of the Adobe Flash Platform, enables Web developers to use HTML, 
JavaScript, ActionScript and the free, open source Flex framework to 
deliver Web applications outside the browser.</p>

<p>"The release of Adobe AIR 1.5 for Linux builds on our ongoing 
commitment to the Linux community and our legacy of creating 
technologies that work consistently across operating systems," said 
David Wadhwani, general manager and vice president of the Platform 
Business Unit at Adobe. "Using Adobe AIR, millions of Web developers 
can now be Linux developers, and with little effort and no additional 
costs, companies can now target emerging markets and a broad set of 
new devices where Linux is growing in popularity." The graphical 
capabilities of Adobe AIR, along with its access to operating system 
functionality, give AIR applications the capacity to provide 
unprecedented user experiences and brand differentiation for the 
developers and companies creating them.</p>

<p>AIR 1.5 includes functionality introduced in Adobe Flash Player 10, 
such as support for custom filters and effects, native 3D 
transformation and animation, and extensible rich text layout. 
Offering new features and performance improvements to create more 
expressive AIR applications, Adobe AIR 1.5 incorporates the open 
source WebKit HTML engine and now accelerates application performance 
with "SquirrelFish," the new WebKit JavaScript interpreter. Adobe AIR 
1.5 also includes an encrypted database for enterprise security 
compliance requirements.</p>
