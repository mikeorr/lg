There was an article about our Welsh translator in yesterday's
Guardian: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/aug/14/freeourdata.opensource">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/aug/14/freeourdata.opensource</a>
</p>

<p>
"Flummoxed by a document in Welsh? Now you can get a free translation
at cymraeg.org.uk. The Apertium-cy software, described as the first
free automatic translator from Welsh to English, is the fruit of a
multilingual effort involving developers in Spain, Wales and Ireland
pushing forward the possibilities of open-source software and, they
hope, free public-sector data."
</p>

<p>
The focus of the article is on how we weren't able to use public data
compiled by the Welsh Language Board:
</p>

<p>
'When we contacted the Welsh Language Board, however, it said the
Apertium team couldn't be more wrong. "We welcome re-use," it said.
Although the small print forbids unauthorised reproduction, the board
says it would be delighted to consider requests. Where feasible, it
will make products available under what it says would be "a suitable
free non-commercial agreement".'
</p>

<p>
Well, if they had ever returned any of my phone calls, maybe we could
have used their data. Maybe they'll give me an answer now <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; On available evidence, Apertium (which is GNU GPL) would have been able

&gt; 'non-commercial agreement'.

Clearly not open source compatible.

<pre>
&gt; Maybe the distinction between 'free' and 'free' is clearer in Cymraeg.

<p>
It seems to be <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> 'am ddim' for 'no cost', 'rhydd' for 'at liberty'

I think the main issue that the Welsh Language Board is likely to have
is of not wishing modified lists to be misrepresented as being
'official'. We have a mechanism for annotating each entry with its
author individually. My assumptions are - and I hope that you'll
correct me if I'm wrong - that copyright law forbids the
misrepresentation of your work as someone else's just as much as the
opposite (for our use, that we mark modified versions of their work as
such), and that, if someone attempts to extract only the WLB's terms,
that the WLB's collection copyright, and thus their licence, is in
effect, rather than ours (or is it safer to try to avoid that
completely?)

<p>
In the UK, the right to be secure against misrepresentation of your work
as someone else's is part of what are called the 'moral rights' of
authors, which are secured by Parliamentary statutes, EU directives, and
provisions of the Berne Convention.
</p>

<p>
(I'm going to be lazy and not going to chase down specific legal
citations for you, in part because it's not a very controversial point
of law -- but you'd search for phrases like 'right of attribution' and
'moral rights'.

'Moral rights' was the phrase I needed - thanks Rick!
