Microsoft Customer
</PRE> 

We noticed that you X11 users still buy mice.

<PRE>
this is the latest version of security update, the
"November 2003, Cumulative Patch" update which resolves
all known security vulnerabilities affecting
MS Internet Explorer, MS Outlook and MS Outlook Express
as well as three newly discovered vulnerabilities.
</PRE>

<P> Vulnerabilities for Linux users running IE include extra memory usage
for WINE or VMware, spurious attempts to run activeX widgets, and much
pointing and laughter by your peers.

<P> Vulnerabilities for Linux users seeking to run Outlook include WINE not
liking the latest version much, too.  Maybe you'd enjoy balsa or sylpheed.
The most dangerous vulnerability is being possibly saddled with Exchange...

<P> Newly discovered vulnerabilities include a potential for contracting the
gullibility virus.  That is, being gullible enough to think someone dumb
enough to send executable attachments in the modern era has any IDEA
what you should install on your computer.

<PRE>
Install now to protect your computer
from these vulnerabilities, the most serious of which could
allow an attacker to run code on your computer.
</PRE>

<P> Take all these antihistamines! (but I'm not allergic to anything right
now) You have to!  Right nowwwwww!  (Did you know that having too many
*anti* histamines gives most people reactions resembling flu?  Thus the
admonitions about heavy vehicle use and so on.  What if it gives you the
"my bones ache and I feel queasy" edition of "flu" - then you're stuck - sick.)

<P> Piss-Off-Curious-Newbie-So-They-Will-Never-Run-Linux-HOWTO:
Install Linux right nowwwww.  Don't even ask how to partition it or
anything.  Just do it!

<P> Folks, if you dunno what you want, why the heck would you think somebody
who can't use a normal and legitimate address for some important announcement
would have any idea what's good or bad for your computer?  Do you let
complete strangers off the street tune your car too?

<PRE>
This update includes the functionality of all previously released patches.
</PRE> 

<P> This virus contains the hubris of all previously released worm trojan
thingies, since those lunks at the antivirus companies haven't caught me yet.
 
<PRE>
Microsoft Product Support Services and Knowledge Base articles can be found on the Microsoft Technical Support web site.
http://support.microsoft.com/
</PRE>

<P> True, for what it's worth.  Most of their entries regarding linux are
chock full of FUD ranting.  But also for the record, so can all of their
*real* updates be found, on the site that they really control.

<P> Think, folks.  If MS really was going to bother the world with their
updates, would they:<BR>
	1. flood the world with heavy spam (attachments)<BR>
	2. flood the world with light spam (mention a URL for download)<BR>
	3. install "Update Me" software in their latest OS releases?

<P> Golly gosh.  You think that (3) was there for a reason?

<PRE>
	Greetings Microsoft Customers.
	We wish you to be happy and safe this season.
	Please download the security updates promptly at
http://www.microsoft.com/security/
</PRE>

<P> Even if you don't decide to solve it by installing something else that's
less vulnerable.  FreeBSD maybe, if you don't like Linux.

<PRE>
Thank you for using Microsoft products.
</PRE>
 
<P> It makes my virus campaign so much easier when people leave
"Administrator" group privileges on because it's such a pain to turn
them off. (Win2K, WinNT.  Maybe WinXP tho I wouldn't know.  Never touch
the XP stuff, even worse EULA than the other ones, and the "break when
you upgrade your hardware too much" feature is beyond even viral
programming talent.  Stands for Xtremely Painful.)

<P> Or better yet if all users have the same powers, basically to control
anything on the system. (Win9x)

<P>
So all you Linux people, if you could run wine as root, then install my
uber bug, I'm kinda hoping for some test sites for a distributed denial 
okay?  thx suXXerZ!

New domains are being release for
the European Union. The launch of
eu domain names has been approved
and they are expected to go live
in early 2004.

<P>
New countries are being created every day!  Prussian princes everywhere
will want their very own .eu domain.

Protect your business name by
buying your .eu domain before they
are available for purchase at public
registrars where anyone can buy them.

Hi JimmyO'Regan!

Just so you know I saw your name in the
newsgroup alt.fan.pratchett. So I emailed you.
</pre>

<p> Of course, it was still obviously spam. Maybe trying to go back to the 
traditional style of spam, where you have actual English instead of <tt>V I A 
G R A</tt> might fool someone, but when you're sending to addresses harvested
from a newsgroup, there's always a chance someone might <a 
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=2jfnd7F10n8d5U1%40uni-berlin.de&rnum=1">start
a thread</a>. Of course, anyone who might have been taken in would be
undeceived by the second spam I received from this crowd:
