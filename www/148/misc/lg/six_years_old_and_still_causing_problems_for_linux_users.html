Hello Ben,
</p>

<p>
I thought you might be interested in the information below on a
six-year-old virus that is still causing problems for Linux users.  In
fact, the problem is so common that 70 percent of Linux infections are
because of the virus.  In response to this problem, Sophos has made
available a free detection tool for Linux users to determine if they are
infected by the virus. 
</p>

<p>
If you are interested in discussing this virus with Sophos, don't hesitate
to contact me.  
</p>

<p>
Best,
</p>

<p>
Stephen

<p>
      Six Year Anniversary for Linux Virus Rst-B - Are You Infected?
</p>

<p>
          Sophos Makes Available Detection Tool for Linux Users
</p>

<p>
IT security and control firm Sophos is warning Linux users of the
importance of properly securing their Linux systems, following findings
from SophosLabs(TM) that a long established threat, known as Linux/Rst-B,
is still infecting computers and servers.
</p>

<p>
Analysis of malware has shown almost 70 percent of the infections are due
to this six-year-old malicious program. Today, SophosLabs has made freely
available a small detection tool to help Linux users find out whether they
are unwittingly infected with this virus.
</p>

<p>
Linux servers are very valuable to hackers, according to SophosLabs
experts. Servers, by their nature, are rarely turned off and often found
to be running no or insufficient protection against malware attacks. This
makes the Linux systems ideal candidates for the role of controller in a
botnet - the central control point when creating and managing an army of
infected computers, known as bots or zombies. Where Linux systems are most
often found to be running as a server, Windows machines are more
frequently used at home or as a desktop machine in an office, and these
computers are regularly switched off. This makes them less attractive as
controllers, but ideal as bots or zombies.
</p>

<p>
Hackers typically gain control via weak SSH password or some other
vulnerability. Once in, they install IRC based malware and use IRC
channels to control their bots.
</p>

<p>
"The number of malware in existence is around 350,000, and while only a
teeny number of these target Linux, it seems as though hackers are taking
advantage of this false sense of security," said Carole Theriault, senior
security consultant at Sophos. "It was very surprising to see that a
six-year-old virus seems to be responsible for a large proportion of the
malware collating in our Linux honeypot, and we hope that Linux users who
aren't running security will at least run this tool to find out if they
are infected with this granny virus."
</p>

<p>
Information on the Linux/Rst-B detection tool is available on the
SophosLabs blog. Sophos underlines that running the detection tool will
only detect versions of Linux/Rst-B.
</p>

<p>
Sophos encourages all Linux users to consider running an up-to-date
anti-virus to ensure the integrity of their computers and servers is not
compromised.

&gt; Hello Ben,
&gt;
&gt; I thought you might be interested in the information below on a

&gt; fact, the problem is so common that 70 percent of Linux infections are

</pre>

<p>
70% of how many exactly?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; "It was very surprising to see that a

&gt; aren't running security will at least run this tool to find out if they

</pre>

<p>
How is your "honeypot" set up and secured? Can you give details of the 
installed software, distro and so on?
</p>

<p>
Again, how much malware is there, and of what types.
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying the virus doesn't exist, nor that we should be complacent in 
securing linux boxes, but you have given very little information to support 
your claims.
</p>

<p>
Your competitors don't seem too concerned either.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>

<p>
Steve

I agree.

<p>
Normally each security related problem is recorded as a security
alert. Security alerts are co-ordinated amongst various security sites.

<p>
Could the reporter of this problem please provide a reference for
the relevant security alert if it exists?

The only recent references to this virus stem from the Sophos labs,
all worded very similarly to the parent email.
</p>

<p>
Symantic, Trend and McAfee all rate this a low risk.

This is why I forwarded this here - pretty much as entertainment
material for the Gang. Sure, PR is usually about high-flying hype, but
there's such a thing as TOO MUCH. Just as commercial pilots, who are
allowed to fly higher than 18,000', are aware of the implied risks of
doing so, the same applies here - and this particular one has gone into
jet upset.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_upset">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_upset</a>
</p>

<p>
It's a classic example of FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt - usually
spread for the purpose of terrifying users into buying Mafia-like
"protection") and reflects no credit on Sophos.
</p>

<p>
Here's a summary of Symantec's page about the "virus" - the word isn't
really applicable to Linux, despite Sophos' hype:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
Linux.RST.B
 
Risk Level 1: Very Low
Discovered: April 23, 2002
Updated: February 13, 2007 12:21:47 PM
Also Known As: Linux.RST.b [Kaspersky], Linux/RST.B [RAV]
Type: Virus
Systems Affected: Linux
 
Threat Assessment
 
Wild
 
  * Wild Level: Low
  * Number of Infections: 0 - 49
  * Number of Sites: 0 - 2
  * Geographical Distribution: Low
  * Threat Containment: Easy
  * Removal: Easy
</pre>

<p>
In addition, a bit of research shows that it's a file infector with <strong>no</strong>
distribution mechanism. I.e., some skript kiddie might get "infected" by
downloading it and screwing around with it, but it represents no danger
whatsoever to an actual normal Linux system.
</p>

<p>
Again, according to Sophos, it's distributed via an "SSH
vulnerability"... if someone can find and exploit an SSH vulnerability,
<strong>that</strong> would be a report worth following up. "After someone breaks into
your house, they can <strong>really</strong> mess up your flower arrangements" is not.

&gt; 
&gt; Hello Ben,
&gt; 
&gt; I thought you might be interested in the information below on a
&gt; six-year-old virus that is still causing problems for Linux users.
</pre>


<p>
This is, in short, a junk news story (or rather, a vendor-puffery 
press release) about a pathetic ELF-infector that is sometimes a 
_minor aftereffect_ of system compromise through unrelated means entirely.  
</p>

<p>
Telling people they need to be protected against Rst-B is pretty much
like telling them they need protection from bicycles, after noting a
pattern of people who'd been three-pack-a-day smokers for decades
collapsing in the street and then getting hit by bicycle traffic.
</p>


<p>
If your system has been root-compromised, you have a great deal bigger
worries than the Rst-B detritus that got deposited afterwards.  I note
that Sophos Plc. don't bother to point out that extremely crucial fact;
but, then, I guess nobody's paying them to.
