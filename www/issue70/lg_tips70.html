<BR>Jim Dennis (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">The Answer Guy</a>)
<p>
 Sometimes you'd like to configure an application so that it
 starts for any user who uses 'startx' (or logs in through xdm?).
 For example, I have a policy on my systems that all users should
 be running xautolock (a program that invoke an xscreensaver or
 xlock module after a period of mouse/keyboard inactivity).
</p><p>

 On a Debian Woody/Sid (2.2 or later) system this can be done by
 copying or linking a file into  <tt>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/</tt>.  This would
 be a script similar to one you'd add to <tt>/etc/init.d/</tt>.  For example
 I added a file called <tt>60xautolock</tt> consisting of the single line:
</p><p>
<code>
 	/usr/bin/X11/xautolock -time 2 -corners 00-+ -cornerdelay 2 &amp;
</code>
</p><p>
 I suspect it should be marked as executable; I just set the perms on
 mine to match the others therein.

</p><p>
 (BTW: this xautolock enables a "blank now" hot spot in the lower right
 corner of the screen, and a "never blank" hot spot in the lower right;
 so a user can blank the screen with a 2 second delay by shoving their
 mouse pointer far into the corner; it also sets the automatic blanking
 to occur in 2 minutes: the default of 10 min. is way too long!)

Tue, 14 Aug 2001 16:03:41 -0700 (PDT)
<BR>Jim Dennis (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">The Answer Guy</a>)


<P>
Here's another <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> tip:
</P>

</p><p>
 Debian normally configures xdm to invoke the X server with the
 <tt>-auth</tt> argument.  This allows one to configure their X session to
 allow remote clients, or local clients under other user IDs to
 connect to the X server (to run in your X session).
</p><p>

 This is useful even if you've accepted the recommendation to configure
 Xfree86 4.x with the "<tt>-nolisten tcp</tt>" option (to disable remote clients
 from direct X protocol access).  It allows you to run X under you're
 own user ID while allowing root to open programs on your display
 (particularly handy if you want to run ethereal, which will refuse to run
 SUID/root but which needs access to X and root permission to sniff on
 your network interfaces).
</p><p>

 The problem is that Debian doesn't normally invoke X with the 
	<tt>-auth</tt> option
 when you use the startx script.  Of course you could use 
	<tt>xhost +localhost</tt>;
 but this allows <em>any</em> local user to access your X session; rather than
 allowing you to control it in a more fine-grained fashion.
</p><p>

 The solution is to edit the <tt>/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc</tt> file, inserting
 one command and adding an option to another:
</p><pre>

#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/X11/xauth add :0 . $(dd if=/dev/urandom count=2 2&gt; /dev/null | md5sum)
exec /usr/bin/X11/X -dpi 100 -nolisten tcp -auth $HOME/.Xauthority
## . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

</pre><p>
 ... last comment line (starting with ##) underscores the addition
 to that command.  The xauth command is being used to create the
 <tt>~/.Xauthority</tt> file.

</p><p>
 For root to gain access to this session you'd issue a command like:

</p><p>
<code>
 	xauth -f ~$YOU/.Xauthority extract - `hostname`/unix:0 | xauth merge -
</code>
</p><p>
 ... from a root shell (perhaps by opening an xterm and using the
 su or sudo commands).  (Hint: obviously anyone who can read your
 <tt>.Xauthority file</tt> can use it to gain access to your X sessions;
 so maintaining these on NFS home directories is BAD; yet another reason
 why NFS stands for "no freakin' security").
</p>

<FONT COLOR="navy">for remote X client access: USE SSH with X11 forwarding!</FONT></H3>
Tue, 14 Aug 2001 16:03:41 -0700 (PDT)
<BR>Jim Dennis (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">The Answer Guy</a>)

</p><p>
 That's the easiest and most secure means available for supporting
 remote X clients; if you call the OpenSSH client with the <tt>-X</tt> 
 (enable/request X11 forwarding) and if the remote ssh daemon allows it; 
 and if you
 have your DISPLAY variable set (which is always the case when you start
 an xterm under X; since it's how the X libraries linked into xterm
 "found" your X server) then the remote daemon will spawn off a proxy
 --- an instance of the daemon that will "pretend" to be an X server on
 display number 10, 11, or higher.  That daemon will automatically relay
 Xprotocol events to your client which will relay them through the local
 Unix domain socket to your server.  This is all automatic with most versions
 of ssh (except for the newer OpenSSH client which defaults to disabling X11
 forwarding and thus requires the -X switch).

</p><p><em>Please make sure you use capital X, as <tt>-x</tt> in lowercase
	tells it to disable this feature, even if the local sysadmin has
	chosen to okay a tunneled X connection by default. -- Heather
</em></p><p>
 This allows you to run X with ports 6000 (and up) <em>closed</em>; (preventing
 remote systems from even seeing that you're running it; much less giving
 them the opportunity to attack your X server) and still allows you to
 easily support remote X clients.

</p><p>
 SSH X11 forwarding also works through NAT/IP masquerading and any
 firewall that allows other ssh traffic.
</p>

<BR>Yan-Fa Li (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">yanfali from best.com</a>)

<p><em>This matter has come up many times before, and will surely come up many
	times in the future.  I hope by putting Yan-Fa's crisp description and
	our extra notes in Tips, that more people who need it, will find it
	easily. -- Heather</em></p>

<strong>
<P>
There's a simpler way to put a new root password on a linux
system if you've forgotten it and have physical access.
Which I haveto assume this person has since they're messing
with partitions.
</P>
<P>
If you have lilo installed, interrupt the boot up process
at the lilo prompt and type:
	<br>kernelImageName <tt>single</tt>
	<br><em>(one example would be <tt>linux</tt> as your kernelImageName.)
	-- Heather</em>
</P>
<P>
This will boot you up in single user mode and allow you to
chance the password.  This has the added advantage of running
all the standard run level 1 processes, including mounting
of partitions.
</P>
<P>
Yan-Fa Li
</P>
</strong>

<p>Things to look out for, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>That actually depends on how your system is configured.
	For instance, the default <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> 
	configuration makes you type in the root password before going into 
	single-user mode. -- Mike
	<br>That feature is called sulogin. -- Heather
<li>Another way to do this: at the bootprompt, enter
	<br>kernelImageName <tt>init=/bin/sh</tt>
	<br>No password required, unless you've been so prudent as to
include
	<br><tt>password=something
	<br>restricted</tt>
	<br>in your lilo.conf before running lilo.
	<br>-- Dan Wilder

If you like to get your hands dirty you can also edit the

Hi,
</P>
<P>
From the Department of Scripting Newbieville, here's a tiny function
I've added to my <tt>.bashrc</tt> and ended up using quite often:
</P>
<Pre>
addy ()
{
  if [ $# -eq 1 ]
  then
    grep -i "$1" "$HOME/.mail_aliases" | mawk '{ print($3) }'
  else
    echo "Usage: addy &lt;searchstring&gt;"
  fi
}
</Pre>
<P>
Given a search string (part of a name, nickname or address) as
input, it'll output any matching email addresses it finds in an
email aliases file (<tt>~/.mail_aliases</tt>, in this case). The alias file
contains lines in the format used by mutt - for example:
</P>
<Pre>
alias nickname whoever@wherever (Real Name)
</pre>
<P>
If you use WindowMaker and have xmessage, you can add something
similar to a menu by adding the following, as a single line, to the
menu config file of your choice:
</P>
<Pre>
"Find email address..." SHEXEC "xmessage -nearmouse
  `grep -i \'%a(Email address finder,Enter search string:)\'
  .mail_aliases | mawk '{ print($3) }'`"
</Pre>
<P>
Thanks to everyone involved with Linux Gazette - you're great!
<br>Tim

<li>Slackware:
apsfilter is what you will probably want to use.  You can find it
in <TT>/usr/lib/apsfilter</TT>.  There is a setup program that you can run.  
It's not as friendly as printtool, but it should get you going.
	<br>-- Daniel S. Washko
<li>Slackware:
Look in <TT>/usr/doc/apsfilter-6.1.1</TT>. The setup program should be

I have recently had the same problem with random seg faults that you 
addressed in August TAG.
</P>
<P>
I bought a new computer, pieced it together, and put 384M in it.  When I 
initially installed linux, it was dog slow, and running top, I noticed that
 I only had 64M visible (I think, incredibly less that 384 to be sure).  
I did a little checking and learned that the motherboard has a
known problem of not seeing all the memory.  So I entered the line 
"mem=384M".  I then started getting random seg faults.  I couldn't figure 
it out for a long time. 
</p><p>Even though I had a graphics card with on-board
 memory, my bios still alotted 64M to the AGP device on the
motherboard.  I reduced this (couldn't get rid of it, or set to 0), and 
allowed for the use in my <tt>lilo.conf</tt> entry, and all is wonderful now.

Sorry about the verbosity.

</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I volunteer for a non-profit freenet ccil.org and would like to setup smtp
authenication so that CCIL users who buy connectivity from other ISP's
will continue to use our stable and reliable mail sevices.  The system our
mail runs on is a <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> potato box running the default smtp server exim.
<br>Can you point me to a HOWTO?

<P><STRONG>
Thanks,
<br>Chuck
</STRONG></P>

<P>
Are you asking how to allow users of your systems to access mail on your system
even though they are not in your domain?  If so, you want a program called
pop-before-smtp (here's one URL I found over on google:
<A HREF="http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/PLDtest/i686/pop-before-smtp-1.21-3.noarch.html"
	>http://rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/PLDtest/i686/pop-before-smtp-1.21-3.noarch.html</A> ).
</P>
<P>
It's easy to setup and allows your users to access their email from anywhere
in the world.

<P>
Has anybody tried Subversion?  According to the web page
(<A HREF="http://subversion.tigris.org"
	>http://subversion.tigris.org</A>), it's at Milestone 2 alpha
development, and aims to have all CVS features plus:
</P>
<P><ul>
<li> versioning of directories, permissions, etc.
<li> symbolic and hard links.
<li> better merge algorithm to minimize conflicts requiring human intervention.
<li> natively client/server.
</ul></P>
<P>
It was recommended by someone on the Cheetah (<A HREF="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org"
	>http://www.cheetahtemplate.org</A>)
mailing list.
</P>

<p><em>At print time, it reached its Milestone 3, is now self hosted (they use
	their own code and not CVS anymore), and they hope to be feature 
	complete in early October. 
</em></p>
<p><em>Compare also Bitkeeper, (<a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">www.bitmover.com</a>), a project by Larry McVoy and others aimed toward successful source
control of big, complicated projects.  -- Heather</em></p>

Hi,
</P>
<P>
Can you use the same source for compiling a kernel on both an Intel based
machine as well as a Sun?
</P>
<P>
I would like to know before I break my Sun
</P>
<P>
thanx
<br>Danie

<P>
It should automatically detect the architecture it's compiling on and
produce the right kernel.
</P>
<P>
However, whenever you install a new kernel, you always want to have a plan
of escape in case the new kernel doesn't boot.  That means making sure
your old kernel is still ready to go and you know how to switch back to it.
Popular ways to do this are to put the new kernel on a boot floppy, leaving
the hard-disk setup alone, or arranging for LILO to boot one or the other
from its menu.  I'm not sure if Sun computers have LILO (Alphas use a multi-OS
program called MILO instead), but they should have something equivalent.
-- Mike</P>

<em>
<P>
I can answer that.  They use SILO, which works a little differently from LILO,
but in a way, it makes it much easier to have multiple kernels.
</P>
<P>
Booting a Sparc takes more code than a PC does, but the disk partitioning
utilities available to linux are not real clear on that concept.  So SILO
installs a <strong>tiny</strong> first stage loader whose only job in the 
whole world is to find the second stage.  The second stage has more room 
than LILO does, so it is also smart enough to read its own config file.  
Thus SILO doesn't need to be re-invoked all the time when you make 
configuration changes.
</P>
<P>
But I wouldn't change what you let the bootprom memorize, until you are dead
certain the new one works.
</P>
<P>
I'll add that the Sparc <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> disc 
might make an acceptable rescue disc if you get really screwed up, but 
it's still better to be careful. -- Heather
</P>

<strong>
<P>
What combination of open source software should be used to create a
portal site? How could a beginner build and test such a site?
</P>
</strong>

<p>The Gang replies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metadot
(<A HREF="http://freshmeat.net/projects/metadotportalserver"
	>http://freshmeat.net/projects/metadotportalserver</A>)
	<br>is a nice portal software....    
	I use it at <A HREF="http://www.gmnow.net"
	>http://www.gmnow.net</A>
	<br>-- Guy
<li>Mike Orr mentions several ...
	<br><em> The best ones are based on a widely-used
programming language and allow customization in that language, in case
the default features are not adequate. You could also write your own in 
Python, PHP or as a Java servlet.</em>
	<ul>
	<li>Python-based:  
	<UL><LI>Zope (<A HREF="http://www.zope.org" >http://www.zope.org</A>).  
	<br>You can use the default portal user interface or design your own 
		using Zope's tools.  
	<LI>There are also Zope Products like Squishdot you can plug in that 
	offer an alternate user interface, talkback features, etc.  
	<LI>Webware (<A HREF="http://webware.sourceforge.net"
	>http://webware.sourceforge.net</A>)
	is not a portal but provides modular tools to build one.
	</UL>
	<li>PHP-based:  
	PHP Nuke (<A HREF="http://phpnuke.org"
	>http://phpnuke.org</A>).  Warning: low on documentation.
</ul>
</Ul>

<strong>
<P>
Thank you for the reply.  It is very helpful.  Gives me a lot of new places
to look.
</P>
<P>
peace
