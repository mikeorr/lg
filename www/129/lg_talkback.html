<strong><p>Dear Kapil, 
</p>

<p>I just read your blender/gimp/StereoGraph tutorial. I am hoping to
create my own simple stereographs. I tried to create an image in the
gimp using the leopard patter that was 640x480 (though yours seemed much
thinner than that) and created another image in the gimp that was a
simple white and gray design with a black background saved in tga
format. When I tried to use the stereograph parameters you gave I got
the following output:
</p>

<pre>
initializing renderer...FAILED;
illegal parametre;
</pre>
<p>Is the texture image supposed to be 480 wide? Do I really have to use
blender? What I want to make is very simple...
</p>

<p>Thanks!
</p>
<p>-David
</p>
</strong>

<p>[Kapil] - 1. The texture should not be as wide as the image but much
narrower.  As per the man page of "stereograph" the texture should be about
100 pixels wide for a 640x480 stereogram. You can experiment with larger
sizes for larger images.  </p>

<blockquote><p>2. Since what you want to make is very simple you can
experiment with creating the image directly using a simple graphics editor.
However, the sensation of depth will depend significantly on how accurately
the height (in the 3D image) is mapped to the gray-level of your image.
</p>

<p>Hope this helps.

<strong><p>How does IP cop reac to VNC?</p>

<p>Cheers</p></strong>

<p>[Thomas] - Woah! Hold back there. You've given us <em>way</em> too much
information.  It's going to take me a long time to sieve through it all.
</p>

<p>
Really -- do you <strong>honestly</strong> think that if it was me asking that question to
<strong>you</strong> that you would have any idea what I was asking? No -- you probably
wouldn't, and I daresay you'd want to have a lot more information than just
two very sporadic and disparate setences such as the ones you have used
above.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you're going to ask an actual question you ought to at
least read the following which will help you:</p>

<p><a href="../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a></p>

<p>I am at a loss as to what &quot;reac&quot; is supposed to mean. Do you
mean &quot;react&quot;? If so, that's probably not the right word either --
the two are not even related. You might have meant &quot;compare&quot;, but
again, the two don't compare since they do different things. So maybe
you're just interested in setting up VNC, and <strong>maybe</strong> making sure that any
ports it uses aren't firewalled?  If that's your actual question then
rephrase it as such with more pertinent information. Configuring VNC really
isn't that hard. Google for &quot;vnc howto&quot;, you'll get lots of hits
there.</p>

<p>Too vague? That's a shame. But then so was your question.
:P</p>

<p>[Ben] - That's one of the reasons that I'm not a big fan of KDE <em>or</em>
  GNOME; in some ways, I see them as replicating Micr0s0ft's "Do not fear,
  little human - Wind0ws(Linux) will not harm you" user interface dynamic.
  "Let's make Wind0ws users feel at home" is all fine and dandy - but not at
  the cost of injecting Wind0ws terminology into places in Linux where it
  doesn't belong, or trying to "soften the impact" of having to deal with a
  computer by pretending that it's only a fuzzy-wuzzy cuddly loveable version
  of your file cabinet, yes indeed! Bleh.  </p>

<p>
[[[Ben]]] - [cough] That's not anything to be surprised by, at least in my
experience. There are many college professors who know their subject and
their business (teaching), and are excellent at both. These, however,
are a rarity - I always treasured them whenever I was lucky enough to
have one. I guess I've done something right lately, because my current
professor is indeed one of this select group: at the age of 72, Ken Hyde
is an excellent welder, an amazing teacher, and a damn fine human being
overall.

<strong>

<p>Just reading this article on fonts and I find it interesting that the
  article refers to the font server port as unix/:7100. I'm using Mandriva
  2006 and it uses unix/:-1. Okay, so this is probably (??) the same as 65535
  ... but, if I check /etc/services there is no port 65535 (or anything past
  60179. AND, the fontserver port is 7100.  </p>

  <p>I can confirm the -1 by doing an 'xset q' as well as by looking that the
  xorg.conf file.  </p>

  <p>So, is there a significance to the value -1?  </p> 

</strong>


<p>[Thomas] - Early versions of Redhat (versions up to 6.0, IIRC) used to
  define the fontserver's address as unix/:-1 -- perfectly valid too, and
  caused no end of issues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never understood <em>why</em> Redhat used to insist on installing two font
  servers in the vaguest hope they were going to be any good -- they aren't,
  and commenting out that line entirely is the best course of action, since
  it's much more trouble than its worth. </p> 
</blockquote>

<p>[[BobV]] - I will have to try outcommenting that just to see. On the
  other hand, so long as it works I may leave well enough alone :) </p>


<p>[Thomas] - [Quoting BobV]:
<blockquote>

&gt; the xorg.conf file.
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>What about:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
sudo netstat -apvn | grep -i xfs
</pre>
</blockquote>

[[BobV]] - 

<pre>
netstat -apvn | grep -i xfs
netstat: no support for `AF IPX' on this system.
netstat: no support for `AF AX25' on this system.
netstat: no support for `AF X25' on this system.
netstat: no support for `AF NETROM' on this system.
unix  2      [ ACC ]     STREAM     LISTENING     12007  5435/xfs /tmp/.font-unix/fs-1
unix  3      [ ]         STREAM     CONNECTED     2398890 5435/xfs /tmp/.font-unix/fs-1
unix  2      [ ]         DGRAM                    11994  5435/xfs
</pre>
<p>Translation?</p>

<p>[[[Thomas]]] - Without going into too much detail (it's boring) what that's
  saying is that the font server has a connection open (a socket, hence
  STREAM) and that the socket is used in a connectionless mode (i.e. a
  Datagram).  Essentially, the communication is established with the font
  server as and when it is needed, and isn't always there hanging to the
  local XServer.  This has to be the case, else the network traffic involved
  would be very high.  </p>

<p>[Thomas] - </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
&gt; So, is there a significance to the value -1?
</pre>
<p>It's just another number -- God knows why they chose it, since serving
fonts on port 7100 has been normal now for many years.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>[[BobV]] - Yes, but should the port number (in this case -1) show up in
/etc/services? Oh, wait ... my /etc/services does say: </p>

<blockquote>

  <pre>
	# The Dynamic and/or Private Ports are those from 49152 through 65535
  </pre>

  <p>so, I suppose that the -1 is a dynamic/private port?  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>[[[Thomas]]] - As far as I know, yes.</p>

<p>[Faber] - IIRC, the -1 says use unix sockets instead of unix ports.
</p>

<p>[[Thomas]] - Can you confirm that?  I thought this as well, but I can't
  find any documentation which says that.  </p>

<p>[Edgar] - Hi Richard, </p>

<blockquote>

  <p>No, I haven't yet discovered Qemu, although I have seen references to
  it.  Is it perhaps a further development of DOSEMU?  Used to use that back
  in my CompuServe/Tapcis days.  </p>

  <p>At the moment I am playing with (I refuse to say "fighting") XEN, which
  also is free software.  Since non-proprietary it allows lots of tweaking
  which means lots of things can go wrong.  </p>

  <p>If you are comfortable enough with Qemu to recommend it, would you
  consider an article on it for Linux Gazette?  I would be interested in
  reading about it from someone who went through the process of getting it
  functional.  </p>

  <p>There is no one "right" way and often the sheer number of choices makes
  it difficult to decide, particularly for people new to Linux.  An article
  from someone who has been there can be a huge help.  </p>
