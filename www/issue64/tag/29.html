<p><strong>
i just read one of your previous posts re removing linux from a system.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
i installed linux mandrake 6 in a dual boot win98 setup.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
i just wanted to learn about linux a bit at a time but now im tired of it
and want to remove it and lilo completley. I formatted the entire c drive
and nothing would run because lilo was still there and parts of linux. How
and where do I remove lilo? I read about the lilo -u , but where,when do i
do this?
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Since I'm bothering you anyway.. I have a compaq presario with all the
pre-installed crap. I would like to format everything completley and
install a clean win98-me but even prior to any linux i tried this and it
says this version of win is unsupported by your bios .so i am forced to
use the compaq re-install disk that has all the garbage. what can I do
to nuke everything and start fresh ??

thanks for any help

Strange; a quick Google search of the Web gives me over 1200 hits on
"uninstall Linux" with 68 of those containing the word "Mandrake". Even a
search of the past issues of LG comes up with 16 hits. What is your
definition of "high and low"?

I have an HP Pavilion that <EM>had</EM> windows 98 on it.
After exhausting all

doing a recover once or

What could you possibly hope to recover after doing a "full fdisk"? I
don't know which recovery CD you ran - Windows? Mandrake? There is no such
generic term as a 'recovery CD', anyway - or what it was supposed to do,
so the above provides no useful information.

Linux would still be there, I would get the root

Have you checked Microsoft's site for instructions on how to get rid of
Windows? I haven't but I'd be willing to bet that you won't find anything
like that - any more than you will find instructions on the General Motors
site on how to trade in a Chevrolet on a Ford. You're looking for
information in a place that obviously would not have it.

I am a very irritated customer of Linux. All I want
to do is a
successful uninstall of the O/S and no matter where I
look in your
documentation, I cannot find <EM>any</EM> info on this!
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

No, you're not an irritated customer of Linux. You may be irritated, and
you may be someone's customer - Mandrake's, perhaps? that is, assuming that
you actually bought their CD - but not of Linux, since Linux doesn't have
customers. Friends, perhaps. Fans. Advocates. Customers, no. Linux is an
operating system and a community - not a business.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whenever someone writes in with a misconception as basic as that, I usually
ignore their request, since it carries the presumption of "you <EM>owe</EM> me
help, I'm an irritated customer!", and it's one I don't appreciate. All of
us here at TAG are volunteers, and we put out the effort to do this for
our own reasons - but I believe that all of us like to have our efforts
recognized and appreciated; for me, it's one of the major 'returns' on my
investment of time and effort here. To be told that we "owe" it is an
up-front refusal to "pay" that appreciation and recognition, and a demand
that I, personally, find delete-worthy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I'm going to go ahead and assume that your statement was based in
lack of understanding rather than a "reputation hostage play" - plus, I
have a habit of "paying in good coin" whenever I hijack someone's request
to discuss a point of my own. So, here is my slight variation on what Jim
Dennis has so capably covered in the past issues of LG (#s 25, 36, 46, and
48, to be exact):
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
Assuming that you want to clear off the entire drive and have no concerns
about losing any of the data that is on it, boot Linux and enter
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
NOTE: this will completely wipe your entire Master boot Record! Not only
will you not be able to boot from this drive, you will not even be able to
read it once you've rebooted: it will require partitioning (via fdisk) and
formatting. Be sure that you have your new OSs boot floppy close to hand!
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you wish, you can partition the disk while still in Linux (wiping out
the MBR only makes itself felt after you reboot); "fdisk" and "cfdisk"
will happily write DOS partitions to your drive.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have to do this from DOS, try entering the following commands:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>lock c:
fdisk/mbr
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Several folks have reported having no luck with "fdisk <TT>/mbr</TT>" - which, in
my long experience with it (I discovered it by reading the strings in
"command.com" in  DOS5.0 well before someone documented it as an
"undocumented feature") both succeeds and fails silently. I believe that
in the case of Windows-based installs, this is due to the fact that Windows
disallows "raw writes" to the disk: a useful thing to prevent a certain
percentage of viruses, but a hindrance when you need to fix something.
"lock c:", above, "locks" the drive to allow them, and should make
"fdisk/mbr" effective.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have further questions, or need a really radical (but guaranteed to
work) solution, please see my article "Clearing out the Master Boot Record"

Dear Answer gang
<br>Mandrake is the only system that I know of that uses a Linux extended
partition that nothing else can read. could this be part of the problem.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

Just to correct wrong information: 'ext2' is the <EM>standard</EM> filesystem for
Linux, whether Mandrake or otherwise. Saying that "nothing else can read
[it]" shows, at the very least, lack of familiarity with the issue (a
number of other OSs, including Solaris and MSWindows, are capable of
reading 'ext2'-formatted partitions - though software may be required.)

I formatted my hard drive before I found this out. Personally I find
<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> the easiest to set up  &amp; 
the most stable of the 6 or 7 distros that I have tried.

I am very sorry about my previous statement. However what I actually
meant is that Mandrake marks the extended partition type 85.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have made a mistake when I stated windows that I lost windows. I had
windows98 on a primary partition
and Windows 2000 on the first logical drive Windows2000 was no longer bootable
after installing Mandrake. whereas redhat suse and others mark the
extended partition as a win or dos type.

As they say, "no worries". The etiquette of getting along with other,
perhaps strongly opinionated, people ("opinionated, <Em>me?</em> <strong>Surely</strong> you
don't mean <Em>me!</em>" &lt;grin&gt
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> is a learned skill - one that I find is somewhat
forcefully taught in the various Linux (and other) newsgroups. Be sure to
bring along an asbestos overcoat at first, though. &lt;smile&gt;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By the way, good move on downloading the back issues of LG. I find that
they are an excellent "local" reference for me: I've zipped all the text
versions into a single file, and do a "zipgrep" on it whenever I can't
find an answer to a Linux question in the manpages or "<TT>/usr/doc</TT>". As a
side note, I use "zip" and "zipgrep" because that combination returns the
"internal" filename that matches the "grep", whereas "gzip" and "zgrep" do
not.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I haven't played with Mandrake all that much, except for fixing up a minor
configuration problem on a friend's machine, but I do find it sort of
surprising that it would mess up another OS. Does Mandrake actually
<EM>automatically</EM> mark the partition with type 85, or is that an install
option? If I recall correctly, '85' says that the entire extended partition
should be of type 'ext2',
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather]
This is not <EM>quite</EM> correct.  While it is true that the (linux) fdisk label
for type 85 is "linux extended" - it merely means logical sub items (I am led
to believe) are allowed to be larger than those of DOS... I've never seen
anything that enforced that its further contents should be ext2 at all, except
(merely?) that DOS won't even look in there.  It would be less useful if it
did - swap volumes aren't ext2 !
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've actually <EM>had</EM> to personally use this type to keep win98 from spotting
the extend; with a standard type 5 extend... it went into deep space looking
for a D: that simply wasn't there :(  And hanging a newbie's system on boot
we know is a Bad Thing(tm)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

... which would indeed prevent Windows from being
installed there, but it definitely should not do so automatically -
especially if there's already a defined extended partition in place (I
believe that it would be marked as '5' (DOS extended) or 'F' (Win95
extended). 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather]
It should be possible to allow the D: and any other extra partitions to
live in a type 5 or type F while declaring a new Extend of type 85 to house
Linux partitions.  That's the other thing.  You can't have two of the DOS
type extend volumes or MSwin will have a tantrum.  I'm not sure two of type
85 will be allowed either.  But I think you <EM>can</EM> have one of each safely.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Someone ought to test that.)

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

Overwriting an existing partition definition would be even worse
than anything that Windows does (overwriting an existing boot sector),
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Heather]
<EM>This</EM> I agree with!  Anyways the much more critical thing is that all the
DOS visible portions have to be to the front of the drive.  Unless MS has
changed something this winter, it will stop searching when it finds partition
types it disfavors, and if it doesn't know how to boot by then, you <EM>will</EM>
hang.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Which, sadly, is why we have all these questions about having a horrible
time with a replaced MBR - most flavors of MS' bootloader simply won't
chain over to other OS partitions (NT a possible exception, forcing it
with LOADLIN is also possible) - so we have to replace the MBR with our
own, which can be trained to do the reverse (boot windows safely).  But, it
isn't always perfect and when it fails - ouch! People have a good reason then
to bail, but rarely know what it's safe to do next...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...of course the glitzy installers do NOT anticipate failing at their job, so
folks have no real instructions what to do.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There have been some fairly creative self-inflicted disasters seen amongst
our querents.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There needn't be very many of the linux-adopting population suffering this
problem anymore - until it's just plain zero, I can simply say, every one of
them who does, will be gnashing their teeth and asking <EM>someone</EM> for help.

... and
would merit an emergency-level bug report to Mandrake. You might want to
play with that, and if you can confirm it, you'd be doing the entire Linux
community a favor by reporting it.

You might want to revisit that decision. Consider that your experience has
caused this very useful (to any Mandrake folks) bit of information to
percolate into a widely-read publication. That's a contribution that's got
some good value to it - and the real strength of Linux, its underpinnings,
is the fact that folks who use it are willing to give feedback on their
experiences, good or bad. You've made a small but positive difference - and
I invite you, and all of our readers, to set that sort of good example.
