<h1>A New Scanner with XSANE and Kooka</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Long before my old copier (a multifunction unit) died, I was
looking for a long-term, non-combo solution. For quite a while I
have wanted a flatbed scanner to enable copying not only something
from the revenuers for our accountant but also the occasional page
from a book or magazine without having to destroy the publication
first, so I really wanted a single-function device.</p>

<p>I also did not want another something requiring ink or toner or
whatever. Besides, a satisfactory network printer was available.
All that was really needed was a source of input, i.e. a
scanner.</p>

<p>After much researching of product reviews and a bit of ping-pong
with <a href="http://SANE-project.org">http://SANE-project.org</a>, I
settled on something with which I am quite happy.</p>

<h3>The Scanner</h3>

<p>For what it is worth, my choice was a <a href="http://www.canon-europe.com/for_home/product_finder/scanners/flatbed/lide20/index.asp">Canon LiDe 20</a> which cost &euro;55
(about US$70 last summer) from Amazon - no shipping charges,
delivery in about 10 days. The LiDe 30 is supposed to produce
slightly better quality than the LiDe 20, but not in proportion to
the difference in price.</p>

<p>This is not heavy-duty hardware, and it is not intended to be
out for lots of use every day. Instead it has a foot that lets it
be stored upright out of the way on the floor next to the PC when
not in use. It connects to the PC through USB connection when in
use. It seems to be ideal at home or in a small office.</p>

<p>But the hardware isn't as important as the software and the
process of obtaining and using it. And thanks to the help of the
folks at SANE-project.org, selecting hardware was almost a trivial
exercise and using it equally easy. They have an incredible amount
of information on the performance of various scanners under
GNU/Linux. I did glance at the literature that came with the
hardware but none of the information or software provided by the
manufacturer was needed.</p>

<h3>Software Choices</h3>

<p>In place of the manufacturer's software, I installed XSANE (the
graphical front-end for SANE). Since SuSE had Kooka (the KDE
equivalent of XSANE), I installed that as well. Because much of my
research had been at the SANE project, I planned on using XSANE,
but then decided "why not Kooka?" <!-- It, too, is just a graphical
front-end for SANE. --></p>

<p>Usually GUI-based programs are flexible, have lots of choices
and can be tweaked on-the-fly as needed. They don't necessarily
work well with repetitive, run-of-the-mill situations, however.
What I really wanted was exactly that: a quick copy off to the
network printer. So, OK, it isn't yet apparent how these guys can
help, but let's check them out.</p>

<p>As it turns out, for me at least, Kooka has one advantage: it
can print without having to first save a file, then start some
other program to do the actual printing. That makes it simple to
use it with the scanner and network printer as an alternative to a
single-purpose copier.</p>

<h3>Running the Programs</h3>

<p>When started, both ask for confirmation of the device to use.
But Kooka starts a single window, subdivided into 3 sections for a
list of recent scans, settings, and preview/current scan, while
XSANE starts 4 separate windows (there are more available)
providing preview and the like. Since I am a keyboard aficionado
from the days of the typewriter and not a mouse-user at all, I
prefer Kooka's behavior - XSANE turns Alt-TAB (tabbing among
windows on the current desktop) into a bit of a farce.</p>

<p>Both allow selecting either color, black-and-white, or grayscale.
They also have buttons for the usual manipulations to rotate or
mirror and the like. And they each show you the results of scanning
as well as offering a preview scan, again Kooka within a section
inside the window, XSANE starting another window for this.</p>

<p>To me it seems pretty clear that printing was never really high
priority in either software package, at least not in the sense of
using a scanner as part of a replacement for a copier. Kooka has a
print button, and XSANE allows access to Gimp with which one can
print (at least in theory; this is something I haven't yet
pursued).</p>

<p>Kooka also turns about 2/3 of a printed page into almost 14MB
for the postscript printer. <strong>Patience...</strong> The
quality isn't bad, though. To be fair, the quality on the CRT is
far better than on the printer, not a photo-quality device.</p>

<p>Since I am very new to the scanning game, I don't yet appreciate
or even understand much of the available functionality, but there
is <em>lots</em> more!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>When all is said and done, I am extremely impressed with what
SANE, the two GUI interfaces, and the hardware accomplish. Super
quality on a CRT, ideal for sending to someone as an attachment to
an e-mail -- although I do need to play around with formats to find
something less than 1MB for my analog modem.</p>

<p>Recently a scan of less than one printed page from a newspaper
produced a JPEG of less than 150K, quite acceptable for forwarding
as an attachment. This wasn't even on my original wish-list!</p>

<p>As far as the occasional "quick copy" is concerned there is a
trade-off. It requires some time to move the scanner to a free area
somewhere and attach it to a USB port. And then to start one of the
GUIs. But copying has never been a frequent requirement in this
SOHO and I have regained a bit of desk space.</p>

<p>This is clearly not the way to go for everybody, especially not
if you are short on space, such as in student housing or a small
apartment. It is ideal for a small office without continual need
for copying. In any case, do check out SANE before you look for
scanners or copiers.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>Use of scanners or copiers involves risk of violation of
copyright. To my knowledge in some jurisdictions there is the
concept of "fair use" which includes quotes of ill-defined length.
When I copy something it is either (1) for my own personal
temporary use because I don't want to risk loss of or damage to the
original or (2) to forward to a friend along with attribution,
which I consider not only "fair use" but advertisement for the
source. I am not a lawyer, so use your own judgment.</p>
