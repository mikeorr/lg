<p><strong>From Kate Stecenko on Tue, 14 Apr 1998 </strong></p>

<p><strong>
Hi !

<br><br>
I have some problem, can you help me?

<br><br>
Our network has 2 segments.
Each segment have a lot of stations Win 95 & Win NT OS.
Segments are connected via router.
Router is Linux box with Mars NWE for IPX routing & internal kernel
IP routing.

<br><br>
I need that all computers from all segments will be visible by each
other by NetBIOS (in Network Neibourhood/Microsoft Windows Network).
Not all computers in out network have TCP/IP stack (it's impossible
by important reasons), so I cannot use NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
If there are any way to make my Linux box and Samba work with NetBEUI
or run NetBIOS over IPX?

	I heard NetBEUI is not routable.  Novell's IPX/SPX is
	routable to about 16 hops --- and a properly configured
	Netware system should automatically route IPX.  I don't
	know about IPX routing through the Linux kernel (it 
	might require some static tweaking).

<br><br>
	I don't know of any way to tunnel NetBIOS traffic over
	IP or IPX.  

<br><br>Other Options: 
<dl>
<dt>Bridging

<dd>I think you can configure Linux to do ethernet <em>bridging</em> 
	(seems that an experimental config option for this has 
	crept into the recent 2.0.x kernels).  Bridging is a 
	process where ethernet frames are copied from one interface
	(segment) to another.  This is different from routing in
	that the router works at a higher level in the OSI reference
	model (it's at the transport layer while bridging occurs at
	the network layer and normal ethernet hubs work at the 
	physical layer).

<br><br>
	One cost of this is that the bandwidth from one segment is
	usually no longer isolated from the other (meaning that
	your utilization may become unacceptable high).  Some 
	bridges are more "intelligent" than others --- and they 
	"learn" which ethernet cards are on which segment (by
	promiscuously watching the MAC --- media access control ---
	addresses on all ethernet frames on each interface).

<br><br>
	The smart switches or bridges then selectively forward
	frames between the segments.  (I use the term frames to
	refer to ethernet data structures or transmission units
	and "packets" to discuss those from the upper layers).

<br><br>
	Some switching hubs (like the Kalpana) are quite expensive
	but perform all of this in hardware/firmware.   The advantage
	is that traffic that's local to a segment won't be copied
	to the other --- which should reduce the overall bandwidth
	utilization of this approach.

<br><br>
	The disadvantages involve NetBIOS and Netware/IPX.  NetBIOS 
	is a "chatty" protocol involving <em>lots</em> of broadcasts, 
	particularly by servers (which in '95, NT, and WfW is 
	<em>every</em> machine with any "shares").  IPX is better, for 
	the most part, but most of the servers and services utilized by 
	Netware require SAP's (service advertising packets).  These are 
	broadcasts as well.

<br><br>
	(SAP's are why you don't have to configure a Netware client 
	system with information about default routers, DNS servers,
	and things like that.   The client listens to the wire for
	some period of time and hears a list of these periodic SAP's.
	The disadvantage in large networks with lots of servers, 
	print servers, and other services is that the SAP's can chew
	up a sizable portion of your bandwidth --- and they <em>are</em>
	routed).

<dt>Gateways:

<dd>Rather than trying to get this to work at a layer <em>below</em>
	the transport (NetBIOS, TCP/IP, IPX/SPX) you could try to
	get above it, into the presentation, session or application
	layers.  These approaches are generically called "gateways."

<br><br>
	However.  I don't know of any gateways that are appropriate
	to SMB servers.

<dt>Warning:

<dd>
	The rumors I've been hearing are that Microsoft will be phasing
	NetBEUI out in favor of TCP/IP.  So your organization's 
	constraint may not be feasibly in the long run (the next year
	or two).

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"
	align="left" border="0">Conclusion:

<br><br>
	Question your management's constraint about TCP/IP.
	NT and '95 both include it (so it can't be a cost issue).

<br><br>
	TCP/IP is the most widely used and deployed set of networking
	protocols in the world --- and has been around longer than
	anything else in current use.  It is clearly scaleable
	(despite the naysayers and doomsdayers -- "the Death of 
	the Internet" is not imminent).  It doesn't suffer from
	the limitations of IPX and NetBIOS.

<br><br>
	I suspect that your management's proscription is based 
	on ignorance.  They probably think they know just enough
	about TCP/IP to worry about security and not enough to
	know that protocol selection has little to do with system's
	security.  I've seen this discussed several times on the
	<a href="news:comp.unix.security">comp.unix.security</a> and 
	<a href="http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/">BugTraq</a> 
	mailing lists.  

<br><br>
	If they are concerned about where to get IP addresses it's
	simply a non-issue.  They should read <a 
href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1918.html"
	>RFC 1918</a>.  This RFC establishes several sets of IP 
	addresses to be used by "disconnected" networks. In this case 
	"disconnected" means "behind a firewall" or "not connected to 
	the Internet" (your choice).

<br><br>
	You can use any of these that you want --- you don't have
	to ask anyone's permission.  It is your responsibility to
	prevent any such packets from being routed to the Internet
	(which is where we get all the discussion of "IP Masquerading"
	"NAT: network address translation" and "applications proxies"
	(a form of "gateway").

<br><br>
	If their concern is about preventing propagation of "forbidden" 
	protocols (applications layer) or "sensitive" information across 
	the their routers --- there are well established ways of doing
	that (built right into the Linux kernel, among other
	places).  It's much easier to prevent <em>all</em> propagation than it
	is to selectively allow access to specific protocols like
	HTTP (web), SMTP (e-mail) and especially to FTP (which is an
	ugly protocol for firewall designers to support --- but just
	as easy as any other to block).

<br><br>
	So, I have to question their "important" reasons and suggest
	that <em>if</em> these reasons are that important and bridging
	is not feasible than the probably have an unresolvable 
	conflict in their requirements.

<br><br>
	(They might consider running polling processes on the 
	Linux Samba/NWE server to replication/mirror all of the 
	data that must be accessible between the segments.  This 
	would be a big win in a couple of ways --- if feasible
	given their usage patterns.  It cuts down traffic <em>across</em>
	the routers (speed/latency benefits for all) and ensures
	that an extra "backup" of all the relevant data is available.
	The obvious problems involve concurrency if you allow 
	write access on both sides of the fence.  However, if the
	data is of a type that can be "maintained" on one side and
	published across in a read-only fashion it is worth a look).

<br><br>
	In many ways I'd even question their requirement to share
	these as files.  If you have a few-well managed servers
	it may be reasonable to make them all "dual homed" (put
	two ethernet cards in every server and let them all straddle
	the segments).  If they are requiring the propagation of 
	shares created and maintained by desktop users than they 
	probably have a major management problem already.

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" width="50" height="28"

	hope the explanation helps.  Just off hand it sounds like
	you've been saddled with a poorly considered set of 
	constraints and requirements.  

<br><br>
	It happens to alot of sysadmins and netadmins.  While it
	exercises are creativity and encourages us to socialize
	(in our mailing lists and newsgroups) --- it also leads
	to premature graying (or baldness in my case).

<br><br>
