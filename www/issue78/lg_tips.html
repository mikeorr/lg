<P>
Well, I found a solution - but that solution is part of a package that's
interesting for more reasons than one. AccessControl, a package of useful
tweaks designed to help folks with disabilities, had what I needed and
more, along with a control panel that pulled it all together (of course,
the individual utilities could still be used as stand-alone programs.) It's
available at &lt;<A HREF="http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/accessx/"
	>http://cmos-eng.rehab.uiuc.edu/accessx/</A>&gt;.
</P>
<P>
Interestingly enough, Dan Linder (the author) says that a similar panel has
been incorporated into X11R6.6 - a Very Good Thing, in my opinion. However,
for those of us who'd like (or need) a bit more control over our keyboards,
mice, display, etc. and are not willing to chase the bleeding edge, this
package can be a useful tool in the sometimes confusing "battle of the
interfaces".

<BR>Ben Okopnik (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2078%5D%202c%20Tips%20%232%20URLs">The Answer Gang</a>)

<P>
After going back to my tried-and-true "icewm" (KDE was just <EM>too</EM> bloated
for my 366MHz/64MB laptop), I gave a bit of thought to "URL clipping",
which - if not over-automated - could be a handy feature indeed. Then, I
remembered the "xclip" utility.
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tips/clipurl.bash.txt">clipurl.bash.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
All that was left was tying "clipurl" to a key sequence in "icewm". To do
that, I simply added the following line to my "~/.icewm/keys" file:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>key "Alt+Ctrl+u" clipurl
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Now, when I select a URL and want to launch it, I press "Alt-Ctrl-u", and -
presto! A new Netscape window pops up (if Netscape is already running, it
spawns a new one). It also works for files in your home directory, or
"clips" that contain the entire path as well as the filename.
</P>
<P>
One of these days, I might write a little "chooser" for "ftp://", etc.
URIs... but so far, it hasn't been a problem.
</P>

<P>
My tip concerns the CUPS configuration utility that is accessed through the
webbrowser at <A HREF="http://localhost:631/"
	>http://localhost:631/</a>
</P>
<P>
My default browser, galeon, takes awhile to start on my machine. If all I
want to do is run the CUPS interface to change a printer parameter, then it's
much quicker to call it up with the w3m webbrowser in an xterm. Though text
based, w3m even supports inline images. I put a "printer" button on my gnome
panel that launches the following command when pressed:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>"xterm -title CUPS -bg black -fg white -geometry 110x46+240+50  -fn 7x14 -e w3m http://localhost:631/printers"

<blockquote>
Apparently you are not the only one in the world who is inclined to change
the boot logo, but finds it hard to figure out where you would tweak the
kernel code to use your own.  So these people have a patch that makes it
easy for everybody, not just kernel-hackers, to put in a new image.

Hi Mailgang,
</P>
<P>
Concerning the question of Donal Rogers (rogers from clubi.ie) in the
Mailbag of LG76 I found the following in:
<A HREF="http://users.pandora.be/sim/euro/112/kde/kbdandbdf.html"
	>http://users.pandora.be/sim/euro/112/kde/kbdandbdf.html</A>
<A HREF="http://www.interface-ag.com/%7Ejsf/europunx_en.html"
	>http://www.interface-ag.com/%7Ejsf/europunx_en.html</A>
</P>
<P>
So: you may start a new xterminal screen with the Euro-enabled font:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>xterm -fn -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-ISO8859-15 &amp;
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
In this terminal you can use the Euro-symbol (eg. echo -e "\244"). The
question I cannot answer is: how do you force all of your applications to
use this font (if indeed that is the best solution). But I hope it gives
you something to start working with.

<BR>Question from cka74 (cka74 from yahoo.com)

<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please kindly advise me on PPP.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm using RedHat 7.2, somehow I having difficulties in getting the modem
setup and recognized.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I compiled the new kernel with PPP add-on: Network Device Support -&gt; (Y)
PPP Support -&gt; (Y) PPP Support for async serial ports
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1. My external modem was connected to com1, so when I echo &gt; <TT>/dev/ttyS0</TT>,
my TR on modem get lighted.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
2. I set; setserial -g <TT>/dev/ttyS0</TT>, it shows: <TT>/dev/ttyS0</TT>, UART: 16550A,
Port: 0x03f8, IRQ: 4
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
OK - those numbers look fine, and the above test says that you're
definitely on the right port.
</blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I ensured that IRQ 4 is not used by other program by cat <TT>/proc/interrupts</TT>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
3. When I performed; wvdialconf <TT>/etc/wvdial.conf</TT>, the results show ttyS0
modem was not found.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tested out on 2 external modems, same problem arise. but of course my
both modems (one of them was MERZ 566) were in working condition.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Where did I went wrong?
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
As far I can tell, you didn't; "wvdialconf" does not guarantee to detect
all modems. Try using "minicom" to test it: do the serial port setup (it's
pretty self-explanatory) and see if the modem will respond to simple
commands like "AT" (it should come back with "OK"), "AT&amp;V" (show the
profiles), "ATDT5555555" (dial those numbers), etc. If it responds, just
use those values in your "<TT>/etc/wvdial.conf</TT>", and everything will be fine.
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 3 2 4 5"
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
If that works for you, you can place the expression (the part between the
double quotes) in a ".Xmodmap" file in your home directory - or launch it
directly by specifying the entire command line in your "~/.xinitrc" or
"~/.xsession" file, depending on how you start your X session.

I read recently in Linus Torvalds' "Just for Fun" (and again in
in Glyn Moody's "Rebel Code") that the TCP/IP implementation in
Linux was written from scratch in order to avoid being hassled by
AT&amp;T, who owned UNIX at the time. I suppose AT&amp;T was using their
legion of lawyers to go after other UNIX implementors for royalties.

Hi Brian,
<br>That makes sense.  I've read somewhere that the book, "The Design of the Unix
Operating System" by Maurice Bach, influenced Linus Torvalds with respect
to his Linux stuff.  The book described the algorithms of System V Release
2.  Of course, other stuff influenced him also.  Thanks for that info,

<BR>replying to the Gang's previous Thread

<P>
Hi there Ben,
</P>
<P>
I am responding to you as you were first on the list of answer people:-
</P>
<P>
I refer to "ntfs clobbered my ext3fs!!" in Linux Gazette 77 in which the
questioner asks about a partition overlap.
</P>
<P>
I have encountered this twice. Both times it has been with a mixed
Windows/Linux drive and using automated partitioning (ie Disk Druid or
DiskDrake). Your questioner has exactly this scenario.
</P>
<P>
Now, I never use automated partitioning and I partition the drive using
parted before I start the installation. I use primary partitions where
possible and avoid mixed Windows/Linux disk setup.
</P>
<P>
I have experienced the overlapping partition syndrome and have found it very
difficult to overcome. I have not been able to sort it out using fdisk as
either Linux or Windows fdisk can not do anything to such corrupted
partitions. I have only been able to recover using disk manager software and
this was a destructive recovery.
</P>
<P>
Regards
<br>Frank Brand

<P><STRONG>
Simple question: What is a ".RPM" and how do I use them. I assume they
are a type of compression file, but what do I need to use them.
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
RPMs are RedHat Package manager files. They contain the necessary files for a
package, including setup scripts to be run pre- and post-install. They also
have a list of dependencies, so they can determine whether you have installed
the other packages on which this one depends.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Simple usage
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>rpm -Uvh pkg.rpm	# install package from pkg.rpm
rpm -Fvh pkg.rpm	# freshen (update) package from pkg.rpm
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote>
In both the above examples v is verbose and h is using a hash mark progress
indicator.

<BR>QUestion from Francoise Guilbault (guilbaultf from em.agr.ca)


<P><STRONG>
Why when starting SSH client does a subset of sftp open up in the
background by default?
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
Take a look at the last line of your "<TT>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</TT>":
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>Subsystem	sftp	/usr/lib/sftp-server
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote>
Also, from "man sshd":
</blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>Subsystem
   Configures an external subsystem (e.g., file transfer daemon).
   Arguments should be a subsystem name and a command to execute
   upon subsystem request.  The command sftp-server(8) implements
   the &quot;sftp&quot; file transfer subsystem.  By default no subsystems
   are defined.  Note that this option applies to protocol version 2
   only.
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote>
I find the next-to-the-last sentence very interesting... on Solaris, for
example, it's defined but commented out. On <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> Linux, it's defined
<EM>and</EM> enabled by default. I suppose you could turn it off by commenting out
the line, but I'd make absolutely certain that I didn't have any need for
it first.

<FONT COLOR="navy">Make sure sshd is "always" there for you</FONT></H3>
Mon, 29 Apr 2002 19:16:33 -0700
<BR>James T. Dennis (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2078%5D%202c%20Tips%20%2317">The Answer Gang</a>)

<P>
Make sure sshd is "always" there for you.
</P>
<P>
Using OpenSSH (circa 2.95 or later?) you can configure the sshd to
run directly from your <TT>/etc/inittab</TT> under a "respawn" directive by
adding the -D (don't detach) option like so:
</P>

<blockquote><pre># excerpt from /etc/inittab, near end
ss:12345:respawn:/usr/sbin/sshd -D
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
This will ensure that an ssh daemon process is always kept running
even if the system experiences extreme conditions (such as OOM,
out of memory, overcommitted memory) or a careless sysadmin's
killall which kills the running daemon.  So long as init can function
it will keep an sshd running (just as it does with your existing
getty processes).
</P>
<P>
This is particularly handy for systems that are co-located and which
don't have (reliable) serial port console connections.  It just might
save that drive across town or that frustrating, time consuming and
embarassing call to the colo staff, etc.

<h4 align="center"><br>Python recursion limit
</h4>
<P>
If Python's built-in recursion limit keeps your incredibly cool
recursive function from working, you can temporarily set a different
recursion limit with the sys module.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>oldlimit = sys.getrecursionlimit()
sys.setrecursionlimit(len(big_hairy_list))
incredibly_cool_recursive_function(big_hairy_list)
sys.setrecursionlimit(oldlimit)
</pre></blockquote>
<HR width="10%" align="center">
<h4 align="center"><br>Ssh2 client to ssh1 server
</h4>
<P>
If you have an account on a system where only your ssh1 key is
installed in your authorized_keys file, you can force your ssh
connection to use version 1 of the protocol with ssh -1 example.com.
</P>
<P>
Then you can use scp with the -1 option to transfer your ssh2 key
there, so that you can use version 2 to connect from now on. Paranoid
sysadmins are turning off version 1 access, so you should be using
version 2 everywhere by now to be on the safe side.
</P>
<HR width="10%" align="center">
<h4 align="center"><br>Making executables smaller
</h4>
<P>
To make executables smaller, try running strip(1) with the options -R
Comment -R Note. This removes "comment" and "note" sections that the
compiler and linker may have added during the build process.
</P>

<h4 align="center"><br>Headphone volume control
</h4>
<P>
If you're running your headphones straight out of your sound card's
"Line out" jack, you might notice there's no volume control. Instead
of trashing your ears or firing up a audio mixer every time you need
to set the volume, just bind the commands
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>   aumix -v+4 # crank up the volume!
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
and
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>   aumix -v-4 # turn that crap down!
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
to two spare function keys. (In Sawfish, this is under the "Bindings"
menu in the sawfish-ui program.) Presto--free and easy volume control
straight from the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
There are also nifty little volume control applets for the <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> taskbars, but why spend pixels on a common task when you have
all those keys just sitting there?
