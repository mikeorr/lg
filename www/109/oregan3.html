<h1>Accessing a Bluetooth phone</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>I recently bought a <a href=
"http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,47814,00.html">Nokia 6820</a>. After
years of using a 5110, I wanted to get a phone with all the bells
and whistles: Bluetooth, Infrared, Java, Camera, etc. The 6820 not
only does these things, but it also has a video camera, so I was
sold on it. (Plus, my brother has had one for a few months without
having any problems and I got Blackberry email on it).</p>

<p>As it happens, there was a story in the news about <a href=
"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/4033231.stm">Nokia malware</a>, but this
doesn't affect my phone, and it seems you have to be incredibly
gullible to be affected.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll need to do is install <a href=
"http://www.bluez.org">Bluez</a>. You may need to patch your
kernel, but I didn't, so I'm not going to go into that. As well as
whatever 'libbluez' packages your distro has, you'll also need the
'bluez-utils', 'bluez-bluefw', and 'bluez-pin' packages (though the
'bluez-pin' package will probably not be necessary if you're using
KDE).</p>

<p>To transfer files to and from your phone, you'll also need
<a href="http://openobex.sourceforge.net/">OpenOBEX</a>. Even if
you never use the command line, the libraries supplied by this
project are used by both GNOME and KDE.</p>

<p><a href="http://triq.net/obex/">ObexFTP</a> is really useful
from the command line, and from scripts. I have a short script that
grabs what my phone is seeing using Gammu and ObexFTP.</p>

<h3>Setting up</h3>

<p>At first, my Bluetooth adaptor refused point blank to be
recognized, giving me this output:</p>

<pre>
# hciconfig
hci0:   Type: USB
        BD Address: 00:00:00:00:00:00 ACL MTU: 0:0  SCO MTU: 0:0
        DOWN
        RX bytes:0 acl:0 sco:0 events:0 errors:0
        TX bytes:0 acl:0 sco:0 commands:0 errors:0
</pre>

<p>Eventually, Google lead me to <a href=
"http://kotinetti.suomi.net/mcfrisk/linux_gprs.html#id2490745">this
page</a>, which has this note:</p>

<blockquote>For some reason the USB dongle does not work right
after loading modules the hciconfig outputs a 00:00:00:00:00:00
address to the card. The dongle did wake up after I did a
<tt>hciconfig hci0 down &amp;&amp; hciconfig hci0
up</tt>.</blockquote>

<p>This was the tip I needed. <tt>hcitool</tt> gave me some real
output:</p>

<pre>
# hciconfig
hci0:   Type: USB
        BD Address: 00:0F:3D:3D:43:36 ACL MTU: 192:8  SCO MTU: 64:8
        UP RUNNING PSCAN ISCAN
        RX bytes:77 acl:0 sco:0 events:9 errors:0
        TX bytes:31 acl:0 sco:0 commands:8 errors:0
</pre>
I can now search for my phone using <tt>hcitool</tt>. Once I've
found it, hcitool can then give me more information, or I can use
<tt>l2ping</tt> to check the connection:

<pre>

<p><tt>hcid</tt>, the daemon that provides the above, requires D-Bus to be
running; <tt>dbus-daemon-1 --system</tt> works for me. You also need to
have <tt>sdpd</tt> running: this lets other devices know which services
your computer provides.</p>

<p>Once you're able to see the phone, you'll need to configure
<tt>hcid</tt>. I had a problem at this stage, because one of the
many pieces of software I installed kept adding a second PIN helper
program.</p>

<p>To use most of the services on a mobile (or most Bluetooth devices, as
far as I can tell), the mobile and the computer must first be paired.
Basically, this involves both having the same PIN code entered -- just
imagine how horrible it would be if anyone could browse around the files on
your phone, or use your computer as an Internet gateway.</p>

<p>This is what my <tt>hcid.conf</tt> file looks like:</p>

<pre>
options {
        autoinit yes;

        security user;

        pairing multi;

        pin_helper /usr/lib/kdebluetooth/kbluepin;
}

# Default settings for HCI devices
device {
        # Local device name
        #   %d - device id
        #   %h - host name
        name "jimmy";

        # Local device class
        class 0xff0100;

        # Default packet type
        #pkt_type DH1,DM1,HV1;

        # Inquiry and Page scan
        iscan enable; pscan enable;

        # Default link mode
        #   none   - no specific policy 
        #   accept - always accept incoming connections
        #   master - become master on incoming connections,
        #            deny role switch on outgoing connections
        #
        lm accept,master;

        # Default link policy
        #   none    - no specific policy
        #   rswitch - allow role switch
        #   hold    - allow hold mode
        #   sniff   - allow sniff mode
        #   park    - allow park mode
        #
        lp hold,sniff,park;

        # Authentication and Encryption
        #auth enable;
        #encrypt enable;
}
</pre>

<p>The most important part is the <tt>class</tt> line, which
describes the capabilities of the PC to any Bluetooth device that
comes in range. It also seems to be important to disable the
<tt>auth</tt> and <tt>encrypt</tt> lines when you're talking to a
mobile phone.</p>

<p>The <tt>pin_helper</tt> line is probably the least important
detail: it's necessary, don't get me wrong, but most of the
software available for accessing bluetooth devices seem to come
with its own PIN helper, and I don't really see why: the PIN
helper does little more than return 'PIN:xxxx' (where 'xxxx' is the
PIN).</p>

<h3>ObexFTP</h3>

<p>ObexFTP is really intended to be a backend command, but it's
still usable as a command line application.</p>

<p>To list a path: <tt>obexftp -b [phone address] -l
[path]</tt></p>

<p>To get a file: <tt>obexftp -b [phone address] -g [path]</tt></p>

<h3>Phone Video</h3>

<p>Nokia phones save their video as '.3gp' files. These are
quicktime files with audio that uses the samr codec, and video that
uses the H.263 codec (called s263 in the files).</p>

<p>To play the video, just find this section of your
<tt>.mplayer/codecs.conf</tt>:</p>

<pre>
videocodec ffh263
  info "FFmpeg H263+ decoder"
  status working
  fourcc H263,U263,h263,X263
  fourcc viv1 h263
  driver ffmpeg
  dll h263
  out YV12,I420,IYUV
</pre>
and change the first 'fourcc' line to

<pre>
  fourcc H263,U263,h263,X263,s263
</pre>

<p>The audio is a little more awkward: you have to download two zip
files and unzip them as subdirectories of the <tt>avcodecs</tt>
directory of ffmpeg (or mplayer): <a href=
"http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/2004-03/Rel-5/26_series/26073-530.zip">
amr</a> and <a href=
"http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/2004-03/Rel-5/26_series/26104-540.zip">
amr_float</a>.</p>

<p>This is required because there is no explicit copyright on the
code - if it was properly open source, it'd be part of ffmpeg, but
as it is, things are vague -- and as <a href=
"lg_laundrette.html#laundrette.vague">Thomas said</a>, "Vagueness
makes baby Jesus cry".</p>

<p>I've included a <a href="misc/oregan/Video015.3gp">sample
video</a> anyway, though, of my friend Marion (yes, she loves the
camera, but it's mutual).</p>

<h3>Desktop integration</h3>

<p>Both GNOME and KDE have Bluetooth integration available. (On
Mandrake, the packages are 'gnome-bluetooth' and 'kdebluetooth',
respectively).</p>

<p><a href="http://usefulinc.com/software/gnome-bluetooth/">GNOME
Bluetooth</a>
<!-- Link Broken, even from usefulinc site itself 20:45 EST 28 November 2004 -->
<!-- Seems to have become un-broken now - Wed Dec  1 10:28:39 EST 2004 -->
 comes with a desktop daemon that listens for incoming
OBEX transfers, and integrates with Nautilus to allow you to send
files from the file manager.</p>
<img src="misc/oregan/gnome-bt.png" alt=
"GNOME scanning for Bluetooth devices">
<p>KDE's Bluetooth support is part of KDE. Its support is a lot
more extensive than GNOME's: it allows you to use your computer's
audio equipment as a hands-free kit, for example. It also allows
scripts to be run whenever a certain device comes within range, so
you can have your files backup without intervention.</p>
<img src="misc/oregan/bt-kde.png" alt=
"Viewing Bluetooth services in KDE">
<p>KDE's ioslaves provide a convenient set of URI types to allow
you to use Bluetooth. <tt>bluetooth:/</tt> allows you to see which
devices are in range, <tt>sdp://[00:0E:ED:80:7B:38]/</tt> shows the
services available on the specified device, and
<tt>obex://[00:0e:ed:80:7b:38]:10/</tt> allows you to treat your
phone as if it were a regular filesystem.</p>

<h3>Gnokii</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.gnokii.org">Gnokii</a> is a program that
gives access to many of the features of Nokia phones. It's been
around for years, and though it doesn't support many of the
features of newer phones, it's still useful to have around.</p>

<p>First of all, edit your <tt>.gnokiirc</tt>. To use bluetooth,
you need to set <tt>connection = bluetooth</tt> and <tt>port</tt>
to the address of your phone. If your phone isn't supported, it
shouldn't be too hard to find a similar model that is.</p>

<pre>
[global]
port = 00:0E:ED:80:7B:38
#Gnokii doesn't know about my phone yet.
model = 6310i
initlength = default
connection = bluetooth
#It's recommended to set this to 'yes', but it doesn't work for me
use_locking = no
serial_baudrate = 19200
rfcomm_channel = 1
smsc_timeout = 10
</pre>

<p>The first step is to make sure that gnokii can see the
phone:</p>

<pre>
$ gnokii --identify
GNOKII Version 0.6.3
IMEI         : xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Manufacturer : Nokia
Model        : NHL-9
Revision     : V 4.25
</pre>

<p>You can check the results by typing *#0000# on the phone, which
gives a result like this:</p>

<pre>
V 4.25
27-05-04
NHL-9
(c) Nokia
</pre>

<p>The most useful feature that Gnokii has (and that Gammu lacks)
is the ability to grab the contacts list from your phone and
convert it into a useful format. This command takes the contacts
from the phone's memory (ME), starting at 1 and continuing to the
end, saving it as a VCard (<tt>-v</tt>).</p>

<pre>
gnokii --getphonebook ME 1 end -v &gt; phone.vcs
</pre>

<p>Another feature I like is 'getnetworkinfo', because it tells you
which cell you're currently in. There are a number of programs
available for Series 60 phones that work like a mini-GPS, and can
trigger actions on the phone based on where you are, but I haven't
found any that will work on mine. At least I can console myself
with the knowledge that the information is there.</p>

<pre>
$ gnokii --getnetworkinfo
GNOKII Version 0.6.3
Network      : O2 Communications (Ireland) Ltd (Ireland)
Network code : 272 02
LAC          : 4a56
Cell id      : 20b1
</pre>

<h3>Gammu</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.mwiacek.com/gsm/soft/gammu.html">Gammu</a>
started as a fork of Gnokii, but has much better support for newer
phones. (It does lack some of Gnokii's features, though, so both
are worth using).</p>

<p>Like Gnokii, you need to set up your <tt>.gammurc</tt> file
first.</p>

<pre>
[gammu]

device = 00:0e:ed:80:7b:38
#Gammu doesn't support the 6820 either
model = 6800
connection = bluephonet
synchronizetime = no
logfile = gammulog
logformat = textall
#same problem as gnokii
use_locking = no
gammuloc = locfile
startinfo = yes
gammucoding = utf8
</pre>

<p>Unlike Gnokii, Gammu doesn't provide common output formats for
contacts etc. Also unlike Gnokii, Gammu <em>has</em> got a Python
interface available, so I'll see if I can manage to get something
useful done for next month.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier that I have a script that lets me see what
my phone currently sees. This would be a lot more useful if the
camera wasn't on the bottom of the phone, but it's a great way to
amuse my<strike>self</strike> son.</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash

gammu --nokiamakecamerashoot
obexftp -b 00:0E:ED:80:7B:38 -g Gallery/GammuShot
display GammuShot
</pre>

<h3>Open Source software for the Phone</h3>

<p>The first hurdle in using most software on a mobile phones is
that most providers have two sets of internet access settings: one
for WAP, the other for full access. Fortunately, there's a
Linux-friendly site that provides details about most European
providers: <a href=
"http://www.easyconnect.linuxuser.hu/modules.php?name=index">Easy
Connect</a>.</p>

<p>You can use Gammu to install software to your phone by using
this command:</p>

<pre>
gammu --nokiaaddfile Application Virca
</pre>

<p>This looks for two files, <tt>Virca.jar</tt> and
<tt>Virca.jad</tt>, which it then sends to the phone. To install a
game, change 'Application' to 'Game'.</p>

<p>The first piece of software I installed was <a href=
"http://phoenix.inf.upol.cz/~polakr/">Telnet midlet</a>. (There's
also an SSH midlet available from the same site). I managed to
connect to a server without fuss, but quickly became frustrated
with the input method it uses -- any input has to be done through a
separate screen, which is the perfect method for most phones, but
painful on mine, which has a fold-out keyboard. <a href=
"http://www.xk72.com/midpssh/">MidpSSH</a> is a SSH client, based
on Telnet midlet, that supports Telnet, SSH1 and SSH2. It looks to
have a much better interface, but unfortunately none of the many
versions provided would work on my phone.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vidarholen.net/contents/virca">Virca</a> is
an open source IRC client for MIDP 1.0 compliant devices. It
doesn't support things like DCC, but it's quite impressive for such
a small package. I can imagine it being useful on long
journeys.</p>

<p>Looking at the things that are possible with the phone, I'm
tempted to learn Java (despite <a href=
"../authors/adam.html">Thomas's</a> warnings).</p>

<p>If anyone knows of any good MIDP 1.0 programs, please <a href=
"mailto:jimregan@o2.ie">let me know!</a> I want to see how much my
phone can do!</p>
