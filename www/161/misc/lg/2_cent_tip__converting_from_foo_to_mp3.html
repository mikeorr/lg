Recently, while organizing my (very large) music library, I analyzed the
whole thing and found out that I had almost 30 (!) different file types.
Much of this was a variety of info files that came with the music (text,
PDF, MS-docs, etc.) as well as image files in every conceivable format
(which I ended up "flattening" to JPG) - but a large number of these
were music formats of every kind, a sort of a living museum of "Music
Formats Throughout the Ages." I decided to "flatten" all of that as well
by converting all the odd formats to MP3.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, there's a wonderful Linux app that will take pretty much
every kind of audio - "mplayer"
(<a href='http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html#ac'>http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html#ac</a>). It can also dump
that audio to a single, easily-convertible format (WAV). As a result, I
created a script that uses "mplayer" and "lame" to process a directory
of music files called "2mp3".
</p>

<p>
It was surprisingly difficult to get everything to work together as it
should, with some odd challenges along the way; for example, redirecting
error output for either of the above programs was rather tricky. The
script processes each file, creates an MP3, and appends to a log called
'2mp3.LOG' in the current directory. It does not delete the original
files - that part is up to you. Enjoy!
</p>
