<h3>Patching closedShop</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Make "cgi-bin" 755 as usual.
<li> Create a "vars" subdirectory in "cgi-bin"; set its ownership and group to "nobody/nogroup" (or "apache/nogroup", as appropriate) and the permissions to 775.
<li> Create an empty ".htpasswd" file in "vars".
<li> Save <a href="cS.diff">this patch</a> in your "cgi-bin" and
run <strong><code>patch -d . &lt; cS.diff</code></strong> at the prompt
(you may delete the diff file after you've done this.)
<li> Continue to set up closedShop as per the instructions in the article.
</ol>
