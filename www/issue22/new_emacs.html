<center><h1>GNU Emacs 20.1</h1></center>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>Richard Stallman and the other members of the GNU Emacs development team
are a rather reticent group of programmers.  Unlike many other development
projects in the free-software world, the Emacs beta program is restricted to a
closed group of testers, and news of what progress is being made is scanty.
In the past couple of months hints found in various usenet postings seemed
to intimate that a new release of GNU Emacs was imminent, so every now and
then I began to check the GNU main 
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu">FTP</a> site on the off-chance that a
release had been made.

<p>Early on the morning of September 17 I made a quick check before beginning
my day's work, and there it was, a new Emacs 20.1 source archive.  As with all 
Emacs source packages, it was large (over 13 megabytes) so I began the download
with NcFtp and left it running.

<center><h3>Building It</h3></center>

<p>There is always a delay between the release of a new version of a software
package and the release of a Linux distribution's version, such as a Debian or
RedHat binary package.  Even if you usually use RPMs or <i>*.deb</i> releases
(in many cases it's preferable) a source release of a major team-developed
piece of software such as GNU Emacs will usually build easily on a reasonably
up-to-date Linux machine.  The included installation instructions are clear:
just run the configure script, giving your machine-type and preferred
installation directory as switches.  In my case, this command did the trick:
<br>

<p><kbd>./configure i586-Debian-linux-gnu --prefix=/mt</kbd><br>

<p>The script will generate a Makefile tailored to your machine;
<kbd>make</kbd>, followed by <kbd>make install</kbd> and you're up and
running.

<center><h3>So What's New?</h3></center>

<p>It's been about a year since the last public GNU Emacs release, so there
have been quite a few changes.  One of the largest is the incorporation of the
MULE (<b>M</b><b>U</b>lti<b>L</b>ingual <b>E</b>macs) extensions, which give
Emacs the capability of displaying extended character sets necessary for
languages such as Chinese and Japanese.  This won't be of interest to most
English-speaking users, but if you're interested the necessary files are in a
separate archive at the GNU site.

<p>Here's a partial list of changes and updated packages:

<ul>
  <li>For some reason, the scroll-bar is now on the left, but it can be
      changed back to its old position on the right with the new Customize
      facility.  Some day it would be nice if someone implemented a real
      scrollbar for GNU Emacs, with the usual buttons or arrows at top and
      bottom which allow smooth scrolling rather than paging, but it seems
      this is a low priority for the developers.
  <li>Per Abrahamsen's <b>Customize</b> package is now thoroughly integrated
      with the majority of the included LISP packages, allowing easy
      customization of all sorts of options, with the results appended to your
      <i>~.emacs</i> file.  This so much easier than hacking on the
      <i>.emacs</i> file; I don't know how many times I've had a misplaced or
      unbalanced parentheses, causing Emacs to quit loading the file and
      giving me the dread message: <b>Error in init file</b>.
  <li><b>Viper</b>, <b>CC-Mode</b>, the <b>GNUS</b> newsreader, and many other
      extension packages have been updated.
  <li>The default values for many configuration parameters have been changed
      to values more likely to be acceptable to most users, the sort of thing
      which would be entered in an <i>~/.emacs</i> file.
  <li>The syntax-highlighting color default values are now sensitive to
      whether you have a dark or light screen background; for the most part
      the dark-background default colors are readable, with enough contrast.
  <li>The text-filling commands now handle indented and bulleted paragraphs
      more effectively.
  <li>The word <b>Emacs</b> no longer is shown in the mode-line, allowing more
      room for line and column numbers, mode specifications, time of day,
      etc.
  <li>For programmers, there are new commands for looking up symbols or files
      in the Info documentation files.  As an example, in C mode the GNU libc
      Info files would be searched for a reference to the symbol or file at
      the cursor position in the current buffer.
  <li>Another programmer's feature: <b>Alt-tab</b> (with a numeric argument)
      will now perform completion on a symbol name in the current buffer,
      using Info files as above.  
  <li>The main /lisp directory has been subdivided into several
      sub-directories, which makes individual files much easier to find. 
</ul>

<p>Have you ever been puzzled or annoyed by the peculiar way the Emacs screen
scrolls when using the up- or down- arrow keys?  It's a jerky scroll,
difficult for the eye to follow, which could only be partially alleviated by
setting scroll-step to a small value.  In 20.1 this has been changed, so that
if you set scroll-step to 2 <kbd>(setq scroll-step 2)</kbd> the screen
actually scrolls up and down smoothly, without the disorienting jerks.  This
feature alone makes the upgrade worthwhile! 

<p>Another Emacs quirk has been addressed with a new variable,
<kbd>scroll-preserve-screen-position</kbd>.  This variable, if set to <b>t</b>
(which means "yes"), will allow the user to page-up and page-down and then
returns the cursor to its original position when the starting page is shown
again. I really like this.  With the default behavior you have to find the
cursor on the screen and manually move it back to where it was.  This variable
can be enabled with the line<br>

<p><code>(setq scroll-preserve-screen-position t)</code>

<p>entered into your <i>~.emacs</i> init file.

<center><h3>The Customization Utility</h3></center>

<p>What a labor-saver!  Rather than searching for the documentation which
deals with altering one of Emacs' default settings, the user is presented with
a mouse-enabled screen from which changes can be made, either for the current
session or permanently, in which case the changes are recorded in the user's
<i>~.emacs</i> file.  It appears that a tremendous amount of work went into
including the customization framework in the LISP files for Emacs' countless
modes and add-on packages.  A Customize screen can be summoned from the
<b>Help</b> menu; the entries are in a cascading hierarchy, allowing an easy
choice of the precise category a user might want to tweak.  Here's a
screenshot of a typical Customization screen:<br>

<p>Per Abrahamsen is to be congratulated for writing this useful utility, and
for making it effective both for XEmacs and GNU Emacs users.

<center><h3>Musings</h3></center>

<p>Emacs used to be thought of as a hefty, memory-intensive editor which
tended to strain a computer's resources.  Remember the old mock-acronym,
<b>E</b>ight <b>M</b>egabytes <b>A</b>nd <b>C</b>onstantly <b>S</b>wapping?
These days it seems that the hardware has caught up with Emacs;
today a mid-range machine can run Emacs easily, even with other applications
running concurrently. Memory and hard-disk storage have become less expensive
which makes Emacs usable for more people.

<p>Some people are put off by the multiple keystrokes for even the most common
commands.  It's easy to rebind the keys, though.  The function keys are handy,
as they aren't in use by other Emacs commands.  As examples, I have
<b>F1</b> bound to Kill-Buffer, <b>F2</b> bound to Ispell-Word (which checks
the spelling of the word under the cursor), <b>F3</b> and <b>F4</b> put the
cursor at the beginning or end of the current file, and <b>F7</b> is bound to
Save-Buffer.  Of course, these operations are on the menu-bar, but using the
keyboard is quicker.  If you are accustomed to a Vi-style editor, the
<b>Viper</b> package allows toggling between the familiar Vi commands (which
are extraordinarily quick, as most are a single keystroke) and the Emacs
command set.  This emulation mode has been extensively improved lately, and is
well worth using.

<p>Even with the exhaustively detailed Info files, the tutorial, etc. I would
hesitate to recommend Emacs for a novice Linux user.  There is enough to learn
just becoming familiar with basic Linux commands without having to learn Emacs
as well.  I think Nedit would be a more appropriate choice for a new user
familiar with Windows, OS/2, or the Macintosh, since its mouse-based operation
and menu structure are reminiscent of editors from these operating systems.

<p>Emacs has a way of growing on you; as your knowledge of its traits and
capabilities increases the editor gradually is molded to your preferences and
work habits. It <em>is</em> possible to use the editor at a basic level,
(using just the essential commands), but it's a waste to run a large editor
like Emacs without using at least some of its manifold capabilities.
