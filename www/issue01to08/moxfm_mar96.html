<CENTER><H3>Introduction</H3></CENTER> 

Included with many Linux distributions is the Xfm file-manager,
developed by Simon Marlow and Albert Graef.  I used and appreciated this
program when I first installed Linux, but when I upgraded the xpm
libraries  (which was necessary to allow many newer programs to
function) xfm lost the  ability to read icons, and I never could get it
to work right.  So I began  trying out other x-window file-managers; one
day a link on the WWW led me to Oliver Mai's home-page. His Motif-based
revision of xfm sounded great, with  many new features.  I immediately
downloaded the source package from ftp.x.org, only to find out that the
Motif libraries are needed for successful  compilation.

<P> Back at Mai's home-page, I noticed that a statically-linked Linux
binary was available for download as a uuencoded ascii file directly
from the website. It didn't take long to download, and the
installation was simply: <EM>make install</EM> and <EM>make
install.man</EM>.

<P> 
Since I began to use it the program has become indispensable to me.

<CENTER><H3>Features</H3></CENTER> 

Moxfm expands upon the extensive feature set familiar to users of xfm.
Oliver Mai has added seamless mounting of cdrom and floppy drives: click
on  /cdrom and the cdrom drive is mounted and its directory displayed.
When you move on to another drive the cdrom is unmounted.  This feature
will conflict with the default setup of a Slackware installation in
which the cd drive is mounted during bootup.  A workaround for this is
simply editing out the statement:

<PRE> 
"if [ -r /etc/rc.d/rc.cdrom ]; then 
 . /etc/rc.d/rc.cdrom 
 fi " 
</PRE> 

from the /etc/rc.d/rc.M file. 

<P> 
One of the menu-bar commands which I use all the time is &quot;start
xterm&quot;  which opens an xterm in whichever directory is currently
displayed.  Let's say  you've just downloaded source-code for something
new. In the application   window you bring up the <EM>Toolbox</EM> page,
drag the *.tgz file over to the  <EM>Untgz</EM> icon, and open up the
newly created directory in the adjacent directory window.  After reading
the README and INSTALL files,  you can bring up  an xterm in the current
directory and compile the source.

<P> 
The optional separate application window holds several pages of
categorized  icons, which are easily editable and can represent
applications, files, drives, etc.

<P> 
Additional directory windows can be opened and drag and drop is
well-supported; a limitation of the current beta (0.98) prevents you
from  moving files between partitions, but the soon-to-arrive version 1
is supposed to support this.

<P>
In the best unix tradition all configuration is done with ascii text
files.    During installation a directory named ".xfm" is created under
/etc/X11;  this subdirectory contains several "dot-files" which allow
extensive customization.    One essential file is moxfmdev, which tells
moxfm which directories you'd like your   floppy and cdrom drives to be
mounted upon.

<P> 
Like fvwm, moxfm can look like an entirely different program at the
end of a  customization process. <P>Configuration file entries for the
application-window icons can be easily edited   by means of a
right-mouse-button menu selection; after changing a setting,   (perhaps
the setting for the icon to be displayed),  you can preview the changes
and choose whether or not to save them.

<P> 
In the forthcoming version 1.00, any application, drive, or device
icon can be   displayed directly on the desktop.  The settings for these
icons will be directly   editable in the same way, and their positioning
is variable as well.

<CENTER><H3>Bugs and Drawbacks</H3></CENTER> 

<P> 
Sound too good to be true?  You end up paying for these features
with an  increased load on your system.  Moxfm seems to consistently use
12-14% of total memory and the cpu usage varies from 7% to around 15%.

<P> 
Startup time is a consideration; on my 80 mhz. 486 with 16 mb. of
memory  Moxfm takes around five seconds to appear.

<P> 
Occasionally while trying to read a large directory (like /usr/bin)
the  program will appear to hang, but if you give it a moment it'll
recover. (I usually switch to another desktop so screen-redraw won't be
a factor)

<P> 
Moxfm seems to have trouble with directories like /proc and /dev,
which don't contain the usual sort of files. Killing and restarting is
the quickest way to deal with situations like these.

<P> 
I assume some of these glitches will be cured in the next release,
but don't let them stop you from trying it out!  It's worth the
occasional problem.

<P> 
Personally I like to have a good console-mode file-manager available
as  well; when working at a text-mode console the Midnight Commander is
hard to  beat.

<P>
If you are fortunate enough to have the Motif libraries on your
system you can download the pre-release version 1.00 source-code for
Moxfm from Oliver  Mai's  home-page: 
<A HREF="http://ips105.desy.de:8675/~mai/moxfm">Moxfm Website</A> 

<P> 
For those without Motif the statically-linked binary (beta 0.98) is
also there.  The source code for version 0.98 is also at
ftp.x.org/contrib/applications.

<P> 
By the time you read this version 1 should have been released and
hopefully  Oliver Mai will have uploaded it to the big ftp sites.

<P> 
Mr. Mai states that he will make available a statically-linked
binary of  version 1 soon after the release of the code.

<P>
Incidentally, I should mention that Moxfm is GNU software.

<CENTER><H3>Addendum</H3></CENTER> 

<P> Since writing the above I've had the opportunity to try out a
preliminary version of moxfm version 1.00,  and can report that many of
the above drawbacks   have been addressed;  the speed and stability have
improved, and several nifty   new features have been added.  In addition
to the above-mentioned desktop   icons,  moving files and directories
from one drive or partition to another is now   supported.
