<P>
In order to minimize the development and debugging efforts, a project
like this would ideally use as much ``off-the-shelf'' technology as
possible.
<P>
We first considered using a commercial DBMS, due to the many available options:
file/server systems such as FoxPro or MS-Access and client/server
systems such as Oracle, Sybase or SQL-Server.  However, it soon became apparent
that a file-server solution would not perform adequately in a modem-based
network.  Also, of the client/server technologies, only Oracle offered
a cryptographically secured solution (Secure Oracle).  While this
appeared to be a sound technology, the licensing costs alone would have
exceeded the total project budget.
<P>
Not only was price a significant problem, but we were also unsure of the
performance implications of running Oracle's SQL*Net protocol over
a 30kbps link.  SQL*Net is designed for a LAN environment, where
1Mbps can usually be sustained for the life of a transaction.
<P>
There had to be a better way!
