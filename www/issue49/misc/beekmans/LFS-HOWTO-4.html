<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Installing Sysvinit</A> </H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Preparing Sysvinit</A>
 </H2>

<P>Under normal circumstances, after the kernel's done loading and initializing
various system components, it attempts to load a program called <CODE>init</CODE> which
will finalize the system boot process. The program found on most Linux systems
is called Sysvinit and that's the program we're going to install on our LFS
system.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the Sysvinit archive</LI>
<LI>Go to the src directory</LI>
<LI>Edit the <CODE>Makefile</CODE> file</LI>
<LI>Somewhere in this file, but before the rule <EM>all:</EM> putt his variable: <EM>ROOT
= $LFS</EM></LI>
<LI>Precede every /dev on the last four lines in this file by <EM>$(ROOT)</EM></LI>
</UL>
<P>After applying the $(ROOT) parts to the last four lines, they should
look like this:
<P>
<PRE>
   @if [! -p $(ROOT)/dev/initctl ]; then \
   echo "Creating $(ROOT)/dev/initctl" \
   rm -f $(ROOT)/dev/initctl; \
   mknod -m 600 $(ROOT)/dev/initctl p; fi
 
</PRE>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Compile the package by running <CODE>make LDFLAGS=-static</CODE></LI>
<LI>Install the package by running <CODE>make install</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Configuring Sysvinit</A>
 </H2>

<P>In order for Sysvinit to work, we need to create it's configuration file.
Create the <CODE>$LFS/etc/inittab</CODE> file containing the following:
<P>
<PRE>
# Begin /etc/inittab
 
id:2:initdefault:
 
si::sysinit:/etc/init.d/rcS
 
~~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin
 
l0:0:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 0
l1:1:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 1
l2:2:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 2
l3:3:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 3
l4:4:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 4
l5:5:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 5
l6:6:wait:/etc/init.d/rc 6
z6:6:wait:/sbin/sulogin
 
ca:12345:ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t1 -a -r now
 
1:2345:respawn:/sbin/sulogin
 
# End /etc/inittab
 
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Copying passwd &amp; group files</A>
 </H2>

<P>As you can see from the inittab file, when we boot the system, init will
start the sulogin program and sulogin will ask you for root's password. This
means we need to have at least a passwd file present on the LFS system. We'll
use the passwd and group files from the current running Linux system. Since
the passwords are encoded it's just easier to copy the already present file
and use that, instead of retyping the encoded password. Mistakes are easily
made and this way we can avoid extra hassle afterwards.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Copy the <CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE> and <CODE>/etc/group</CODE> files to <CODE>$LFS/etc/</CODE></LI>
<LI>Edit the <CODE>$LFS/etc/passwd</CODE> file and remove every line, exceptthe line
for the user root</LI>
<LI>Edit the <CODE>$LFS/etc/group</CODE> file and remove every line, except the line
for the group root</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Installing a root shell</A>
 </H2>

<P>When sulogin asks you for the root password and you've entered the password,
a shell needs to be started. Usually this is the bash shell. Since there are
no libraries installed yet, we need to link bash statically, just like we did
with sysvinit.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the Bash archive</LI>
<LI>Configure the package by running <CODE>configure --enable-static-link</CODE></LI>
<LI>Compile the package by running <CODE>make</CODE></LI>
<LI>Copy the binary <CODE>bash</CODE> to <CODE>$LFS/bin</CODE></LI>
<LI>Create a symlink that links <CODE>$LFS/bin/sh</CODE> to <CODE>$LFS/bin/bash</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Testing the system</A>
 </H2>

<P>After you've completed this section, we can test the system and see if
we can logon to it. Please note that you will get errors regarding the init
program not being able to start the rcS and rc scripts. We will install these
scripts in a later stage.
<P>Also note that you won't be able to shutdown the system with a program
like shutdown. Although the program is present, it will give you the following
error: &quot;You don't exist. Go away.&quot; The meaning of this error is that
the system isn't able to locate the password file. Although the shutdown program
is statically linked against the libraries it needs, it still depends on the
nss library (Name Server Switch) which is part of the GNU C Library, which
also will be installed in a later stage. This NSS library passes on information
where (in this case) the passwd file can be found.
<P>For now you can reboot the system using the <CODE>reboot -f</CODE> command. This will
bypass shutting down the system using the shutdown program and reboot immediately.
Since the file system is mounted read-only this will not harm our system in
any way (though you might get a warning next time you try to mount the system
that it wasn't unmounted cleanly the last time and that you should run e2fsck
to make sure the file system is ok).
