Well, in order to get Q3 to play under linux you need the *.pak files
and the linux binary of the game. This binary is available from id
itself, they have a "demo" version for linux. If you have the full
*.pak files this demo will grow to a full version (haven't done this,
I bought the linux version).

There is a linux distribution coming with a specialized wine version which
seems to be able to run many popular windows games.
erm.... can't remember the name, sorry. Maybe search through linuxgazette --
I think I picked it up here some few months ago.

Mandrake Gaming Edition.  Hmm, maybe they'd let him upgrade his regular
Mandrake over to it.

Concerning Counter-Strike, three days ago I finally managed to get CS
to run with transgaming.com's WineX. You can check out their WineX at
their sourceforge-site for free (no support then of'cos). After
installation (I`m not entirely sure how's best: doing it their
Readme-way:
./tools/wineinstall
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
did not work for me, but at least this created all the necessary files
and dirs. When I did it with good'ol:
<TT>./configure</TT>, make depend, make, make install
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
it worked...) do a: wine hl.exe -- hl.exe --console --game cstrike
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(you have to have the halflife dir in the "c" path). The menu works
<em>really</em> slow, but the game is normal speed. My sound is kinda broken,
but that is probably my bad onboard-sound...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The transgaming-folks have a list of games running as well as a rate
how good somewhere on their site, take a look. As do the wine folks at
codeweavers.com.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
And there is a halflife-wine howto and others at linuxgames.com.

Make sure you nvidia drivers are running properly:  Fire up the gears screen
saver and verify they are not running at 1 fps.  If they are, read the
Nvidia howto thoroughly.

Oh yeah, I didn't even go into how many "clone" games we have of popular
games - stopped counting how many minesweepers, tetris, and solitaire too.
We've more "asteroids" clones than you can shake a joystick at, too.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But also: Lincity:Simcity :: Maelstrom:Asteroids :: crafty:Warcraft ... uh
or was that aleclome?  Maybe I should check the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> "availables" list for
the word "clone".  Or <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A>.net for it.  Hmm, had to narrow it down to
"clone game" in order to get 61 projects show there, all of whom have a
very good likelihood of being playable stuff

then there are many commercial ones from a company porting them to linux
(mostly 1st person ego shooters) and there is civilisation (call to power)
somewhere out there as well.

I'm looking at Myth II and Terminus on my desk -- Myth II was a Loki project,
Terminus by Vatical says "PC - Mac - Linux" on the package front.  In short
they don't care which OS we're running, let's just get to the gaming.  An
excellent attitude, in my opinion.

ps i have read that winex has just ported Max Payne to linux making it
the first ever direct x 8 game to be supported under winex.
that is great and hopefully this means that linux will soon be able to
equal windows in terms of games availabilty and entice a few more
newbies to linuxing..............

<blockquote><em><font color="#000066">So far, so good, you would think.  About 4 of a gang of answerfolk had
the time as well as any past experience in the use of WINE to give him
some comment about how to get his games going.  The same fellow also
got other threads, one in where I commented to Jay that by my admittedly
wimpy requirements, WINE runs acceptably on a mere Pentium II.  It
certainly runs better than VMware -pretending- to be a P150.  But, for
some reason, he decided to mail again.

where would i find the excecutible files to run windows versions of
quake 3 arena, unreal tournament , i know i can use winex but ive read
in a linux pocket book that i can download a "linux patch" i have bean
told that if i download the linux quake 3 arena demo and i have the
windows pak files it will make it the full version
what games also allow me to do this counter strike perhaps?
and which type of file should i look for on the websites, they are
excecutible right?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
any help would be great as i have a pile of windows games that i would
love to run in linux but hoepfully not through winex or a windows
compatibility layer eg. win4lin/vmware

OK pal, have you even read what I've told you the last time you asked?
And it <EM>really</EM> isn't difficult to find the demo of q3-linux. Google:
q3 linux demo -&gt; 9th hit.

Because of id's engagement for opengl their games are easy to port to
linux, macos and I even saw quake1 for neXt IIRC. But, those other
a**holes like to stick to win crap directx and since that is only on
win you're fscked. How about you don't write to us that you want to play
games under linux but rather to the ones that make the games? Then
they see that there is a market and will produce accordingly.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Concerning CS: if you would have tried what I told ye you would have
noticed that there is no performance loss (as far as I was concerned)
in the wine emulation, so whats the point?

<blockquote>If you want Linux to run a piece of software you already bought for
Windows - whether it's a game or something else - then you are almost
certainly going to find that WINE is part of your solution.  This is
not about whether you are old enough to play with alcohol 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  WINE
is the way that UNIX-like operating systems these days, just happening
to include Linux at the forefront, run the MSwin "protected mode exec"
file format and answer MSwin library calls.  Heck, sometimes it even
works pretty well.  WineX helps because it means we can then answer
the library calls to that bare-metal abuse the MSwin developers call
"DirectX".

<blockquote>There are occasionally people who will write readers for some data
normally sold on CD to MSwin users.  One such example is Robert MIbus'
"ency", which reads the Star Trek Encyclopedia discs.  You're more
likely to want one of the GUIs other people have wrapped around it,
but those are easy to find from his site.  If you mail him how cool
it is, tell him his Comp Ops says "Hi!"

<blockquote>If you want "purity" - a real Linux binary - in many cases like Quake
they exist.  Go to linuxgames.com or freshmeat.net and look them up.
But if they do not, you will have to TELL THE MANUFACTURER that this
is something that you will spend money on at the mall.  Otherwise every
time you buy an MSwin game just to run it under WineX they will tell
themselves they have another happy Win2000 customer.  They just can't
tell by the Visa receipt that you use Linux, folks.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>And all of this aside, we have squadzillions of native games for Linux
that have never been in shrinkwrap.  Not all of them are clones of
anything nor even available for Windows.  ("Thomas T Tuxedo, A Quest
For Herring" comes to mind.)  The index servers have troves of them. Some
of them are even GLitzy (okay, bad pun.  OpenGL is very cool.)  Go
forth and have fun!
