Does this affect the status of software patents in Europe?  Is patent

Af far as I can overview the connections between all this:
The Software patents are most successfully lobbied with the European
commission and the Comission is the instance that waved them through.
The EU Parliament was opposed and even in the Comission a recent poll
would not have been in favour of the latest SP draft. The constitution
would strengthen the parliament in comparison to the comission.

Microsoft is cooperating with China's government to censor MSN's Spaces

words as <EM>democracy</EM>, <EM>human rights</EM>, and <EM>Taiwan independence</EM>.  5 million
blogs have been created since the service started on 26 May 2005.  China

You know. Those Little Annoying Things about Windows that make you think that
this time, maybe you just will switch OSes. Or rather, in the rhetoric of the
*nix cadre, "start using a real OS". You didn't think those things about
Windows were inherent, did you? Oh, no, it's clearly a conspiracy where the
*nix cadre sneak onto the machines of the Windows faithful to infect our
machines with Linux-pixies.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Like the one that made my Windows box refuse to connect to the hotel's wireless
connection. There's my beloved, editor of Linux Gazette and a longtime *nix
whiz, happily toodling around the 'net, grabbing his e-mail, doing who knows
what else while I'm poking and prodding at panel after panel of interfaces for
the wireless card and the web browser and the net connection wizard. I've done
everything I can do based on the little standup info card the hotel has
helpfully left on the desk. Calling tech support will be next. I've already
asked Mr. *Nix Whiz to see what he can do, and his first few passes haven't
fixed much.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Tech support wants me to go down the hallway, disable my wireless card and then
re-enable it, so that it'll connect to the proper channel. It seems that either
Windows or my network card or both are too stupid to configure themselves
properly through any less drastic measure.

My in-house Linux wizard did something that made all the obstacles vanish,
finally.

Clearly, it had to do with removing the Linux-pixies.  I mean, really, do you
expect me to believe that there's something wrong with Windows?!

I'm sure there's some reason why I'm clinging to my Windows box.  Yep.  If I
don't figure it out soon, though, I think it's curtains for Microsoft on my machine.

Here's an interesting spam.  It's HTML followed immediately by a

past the filters.)  Note how the image is a "cid:" URL, whatever that is.
Also, the skiddie seems to disapprove of WebCrawler and has ghastly
punctuation.  Or else it's a code to reassemble.  I wonder if the
ylonchaez is the skiddie giving himself away or an innocent victim.

It's a URL that, along with "mid:", allows you to reference body parts
of messages; see RFC1738, where they're reserved but not defined.
Micr0s0ft, of course, is using them full-blast (is anyone surprised?)
and praying that others will pick up their implementation. [Yawn] Have
we seen this before, or have we seen this before?

It helps to have read Richmal Crompton's "Just William" British boys'
novels as a sprog, and to have read <em>  Paradise Lost  </em> as a teenager.  I
thought <em>  Good Omens  </em> was a hoot even though I never saw the dreadful
Gregory Peck <TT>/</TT> Lee Remick occult movie that it also parodied.

Hmmm. This was actually June's cover story in Scientific American.
There's quite a bit more to it than "zombie dogs". They were trying to
replicate some of the effects of extreme de-oxygenation that allow
multi-year "hibernation" or dormancy (think sea monkey (brine shrimp)
embryos) and some "ice-water" drowning victims to be recuscitated an
hour or more after clinical death.

<blockQuote>
Additionally, of interest in the SA article, there were experiments with
inflicting injuries on hibernating and non-hibernating arctic ground
squirrels. Upon autopsy three days later (after euthanizing), it was
found that the level of cellular damage other than the immediate injury
was minimial in the hibernating animal, by contrast with a wide area of
damage caused by inflammation in the non-hibernating animal.

A quick trip back to the dictionary later: fire is ogien'. I bought a
Russian phrase book a while back (there's a <EM>lot</EM> of Central and Eastern
Europeans moving to Ireland these days), and the difference between
Russian and Polish seems about the same as that between Irish and Welsh:
mostly the same words, but with different spellings and pronunciation

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The best example I saw is 'stol'. In Polish, that has an o acute and an
l slash. When you're just using the nominative, it's pronounced 'stoo',
but in the genetive the o acute becomes an o, and the l slash becomes an
l before adding the genetive ending ('em' in this case).

Heh. Babelfish is... odd, and amusing. Yeah, you're pretty close -
"khvostik" would be a little tail. I don't know what the Russian term is
for the diacrit above, say, the Russian "i-short" letter is, but I could
definitely see 'ogonyok' as being a candidate. When I was taught Proper
Cursive back in first grade (yeah, yeah, I had a trilobite for a pet and
Chicxulub had just happened the week before), we were taught to actually
form that mark as a sort of a short vertical tilde.

It's called a breve in English, or informally a cup.  I wouldn't think

My Russian teacher used to ding people for not using the cup, saying
"it's not a diacrit, it's part of the letter".  Unlike the e-umlaut,
which was OK to leave off because most Russians do.

That's not how I was taught to write it. I've seen it that way, yeah,
but your teacher's preference isn't necessarily the One True way - just
a preference. A quick review of the fonts on my system shows a fairly
random mix: a couple of the 10646 fonts have it as a breve, but many
others - e.g., "-ttf-tl help
cyrillic-medium-r-normal-regular-0-0-0-0-p-0-iso8859-1", use an accent
mark (the "forward slash" type) over it, while yet others use a short
horizontal bar. (You really don't want to know what Kirillica and Lavra
do to the poor thing. Old Slavonic - on a <EM>computer</EM>

Ah, OK. My argument was with your calling it a breve - I'd always
thought of it as more of an accent-shaped diacrit. Yeah, there's a big
difference in using it vs. not; almost exactly like using an 'i' instead
of a 'j'.

That's one of the reasons I like Vim. ":dig" shows you the list of
available digraphs (I'm using UTF8, so I've got the whole kit); Russian
letters are almost all encoded as '&lt;sensible_transliteration&gt;=', so that
the Cyrillic 'n', for example, is 'n='. Oh yeah - you have to hit
'Ctrl-K' to insert a digraph.

[ NOTE: This has NOTHING to do with Linux, except that I composed and
sent this message using Mozilla Thunderbird version 1.0, commenting on a

From the inaugural "Ponders Corner" article, Rick writes:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
"Pretty soon, having a mail server available for redelivery of mail to
and from everyone came to be seen as a public menace, like having an
unfenced swimming pool in a neighbourhood full of children."
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I either missed that, or let it pass unscathed as it traversed my inbox.
Most likely I'm so absorbed in making sure I learn the lesson that Rick
so effectively teaches that I neglected to pay attention to the humorous
(but in a deadly serious sense) possibilities in that line.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This problem first came to my attention when we were living at the
corner of Mary and Remington in Sunnyvale, some years back. The building
maintenance people had been tasked with blocking off every opening
larger than 4" wide from "outside" to the pool area in each of the
buildings. The people whose doors opened into the pool area were to look
out for themselves, one presumes.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I watched them doing this work, and commented on their contravention of
the positive application of Darwin and Wallace's discoveries to the
improvement of the human species. When they prevent children that are
inquisitive enough to crawl through spaces smaller than their skull in
order to jump in some water and drown, they remove opportunities for
genetic improvement in the species.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Floyd looked at me and remarked, "You don't have kids, do you?"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"Nope. But that doesn't matter. All kids do stupid things. You did, I
did. But we survived, which is the very first qualifier for reproductive
excellence. If a being doesn't survive until reproductive age, then
something which might have been passed on to future generations has been
nipped in the bud."
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Now I'm not suggesting that people actually send their children out to
play in traffic. Well, some people probably should, but that's another
topic, I guess.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyway, I consider an unfenced swimming pool in a neighborhood full of
children as a fun thing for children who manage to enjoy themselves
without drowning, and a complete <EM>public good</EM> for those children who do
manage to drown themselves.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Besides, more children, in an urban environment, is counter-productive.
In an agrarian society, children are the ultimate unpaid labor -- the
more kids you have, the more land/animals you can handle. In an urban
setting, children are only assets if you're welfare farming.

Doesn't matter either way. Expediency has no relation to morality. I'm
not saying you're wrong. People often give away safety in favor of
other things. For instace: motor vehicles. 42,065 people[1] died in
1996 in car accidents. Fourty two thousand people who would probably
still be here today, fourty two thousand souls who would still be
laughing at books that say "Complete works. Volume I" on them, fourty
two thousands people going to work, buying food, running fast and
jumping high. All that, gone.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, what should we, who supposedly care about innocents dying, do
about this? There's a couple things that could be done, none of which
will ever be seriously proposed or acted upon because it's not
"practical" for Americans.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One would be just to stop driving and just go to public transit,
biking and walking. Americans wouldn't do this. We love our cars
literally more than life itself.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Or harsher penalties for reckless driving. If you're at fault, and you
killed somebody, while drunk or not, would the death penalty be too
far out of line? No, seriously?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
But nobody thinks about it, and nobody talks about it, because those
deaths are nessesary to live life that way we want to. It sounds harsh
to say it that way, but that's the way it is.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, is it really wrong? You could make the counter-argument, and
claim that emergency services saved at least that number of people in
that year.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm not proposing that any of those things actually be done. I'm just
saying, it's worth considering the questions, "Is this worth it?". And
nobody asks, or cares, because in America (and most other places as
well), we have plenty of means, but few ends. Drive to work, drive
back, don't ask why.

I found myself in agreement with the general sentiment of your mail
until I hit the above paragraph, the word "crawl" in
particular--children still at crawling age are not generally familiar
with the fact that a swimming pool is not a solid surface, hence the
need for fences. You could, of course, argue that these children have no
business near a swimming pool in the first place (and I could possibly
resist the urge to be trite and say "Exactly! Put a fence around it"),
but you'd be surprised how far a toddler can crawl in the blink of an eye.

I <EM>am</EM> so aware, but there's only so much that can be done in the name
of protecting children from themselves, and they were closing up 8" wide
openings at a height of 4' off the ground. But if I lived in a complex
with [un|under]protected swimming pools, then I'd be responsible for a
toddler gate at MY door. So, once the little rascal got out of the
burlap sack, through the triple-bolted bedroom door, and into the front
room, well then, by golly, if she could pick the Ilco brass lock, then
she's fit to drown herself, walking or crawling.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You see, at this particular complex, families with babies <EM>were</EM>
permitted to rent units that opened onto the pool area directly. This
fencing kept non-resident and other-resident children from drowning
inappropriately.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hmmm. Since it comes down to the parent wanting to protect the children,
then it's up to the parent. Good parenting skills will propogate, too,
neh? Bad parenting skills could (should???) be "punished" by both
removing the child from the shallow end of the gene pool, and training
the parents to be more careful in the future.
</STRONG></P>

Of course, I was raised by a good Catholic mom, who still was capable of

Ah. But I wasn't going to go there. The moment someone says "fittest",
it becomes a judgement call. Just because I don't think that hemophilia
is a long-term survival trait, doesn't mean that I don't think that a
person with hemophilia isn't fit to survive. But if I were that person
with hemophilia, I'd do my darndest to ensure that I didn't pass that
gene on to any kids of mine.
</STRONG></P>

Same thing if I lived in a double-wide in the Texas panhandle. It's just
not survival-oriented. It may be genetic, one just can't always tell...

Firstly, I don't think evolution happens on such short time scales. This
confusion about time scales is something that the above POV shares with
the opposition to the theory of evolution (which seems to be unable to

What sort of time scale were you thinking of? Greg Cochran's article [1]
is looking at round-about 1000 years making perhaps up to 1 standard

perhaps the mechanic's) fault that the somebody broke in and wrecked the
interior - or that the car had been stolen and used in a bank robbery.

<blockQuote>
They would occasionally, just for experimentation's sake, pour a 10-lb.
bag of cement into the oil fill and a gallon of molasses into the gas
tank. The result would, of course, be the car's fault - because they
Didn't Do Anything Different (or, better yet, Couldn't Be Expected To
Know.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
They would rip off the carburetor "because it was making that annoying
noise". They would smash the low-oil and alternator lights "because
the red glow was distracting". They would hacksaw the airconditioning
pump out of the engine compartment (letting out all the refrigerant as
well as cutting the fuel line and the electrical harness in the process)
"because I'd read that Freon was harmful to children." The result would
be towed to the garage and blamed on the mechanic because he had
replaced a fuse six months before.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
They would let the village idiot - as long as he spouted
automotive-sounding gibberish - do anything he wanted to the car,
including using it as a toilet. When the mechanic hinted that this was
not the wisest thing to do, they would get huffy and tell him it was
"only his opinion".

That other bit about fixed attributions making a work

derivative works by <em>  default action of copyright law ,</em>  so it is utter

to that same effect make the work non-free through it "failing the

However, of course, the OpenSolaris codebase apparently (as everyone
suspected) includes quite a lot of binary-only, proprietary "secret sauce"
components.[2]  How useful the CDDL (and other open source <TT>/</TT> free-software)
portions would be without them is an open question.  My own expectation
would be "Not very; probably even substantially less than the

The only thing I remember seeing mentioned specifically is drivers, which

Linux drivers for Solaris--device support isn't one of great plusses of

I tend to take an optimistic view of these things that look like naivete
from a certain perspective - any move in the direction of Open Source by
the historically-proprietary software companies is good for us. One of
the many underlying reasons for that is what I like to call "time in
grade": the longer these people spend using Open Source methods - to
whatever degree - the more these get embedded in their culture and the
environment around them. After a while, they're impossible to eradicate.
As for "the abyss looking back at you", I rely on the GPL and its ilk to
keep the resulting influence on the world of Open Source to a tolerable
minimum.

Heh. I think there will be a lot of public contributions to the code, if
only to clean it up. I never really understood why so much research goes
into code comprehension (well, aside from the fact that C lecturers write
some of the worst C around): open source projects <EM>need</EM> to have code that's
as clear as possible, otherwise noone can contribute. Heck, even Wine,
which (of necessity) has some of the most cryptic code I've ever seen
(self-modifying blobs of x86 binary code, C emulations of C++ exceptions
and classes, etc), is a model of clarity, as far as it can be.

<P><STRONG>
Not so Open Solaris. Their tar implementation is one 182k .c file; their
nroff implementation uses the original Unix naming convention for files
(n1.c etc). I'm sure they'll get plenty of clean-up patches from people
cringing on Sun's behalf

I didn't have much time to really look into this yesterday (but I did
get some really good coding done, and had the very satisfying experience
of solving a thorny problem that's been bugging me for a couple of
years!); today is a new day, and I'm wasting^Wspending my morning
checking out the buzz on this. Fascinating - it looks and smells real.
In fact, reading Tim Bray's blog and the link tree that branches out
from it - thanks, Raj! - I'm slowly growing convinced that Sun has
finally clued in, bought the stock, drank the Koolaid. All I can say, in
stunned admiration, is "Bravo" - I had not expected it, and was actually
rather cynical about it, having built my expectations based on what I
saw from my little corner of the Sun culture. It seems I was wrong.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The interesting bit about this is that the Solaris kernel has been a
strictly "hands-off" affair since time immemorial; you could tweak some
user-space settings to influence its operation in some mild ways, but
that was about all (and learning to do even that required a three-day
class and using ADB [shudder].) As well, some of the operational
algorithms - e.g., the exact process of deciding how to accept/reject
TCP connections - were generally hinted at but the details were
<em> intentionally  </em> shrouded in mystery (security through obscurity, even
though Sun showed itself to be totally aware, in other places, that this
is not a useful approach.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There's also the fact - and I'm <em>  not  </em> snarking at Sun in the least, but
applauding their moving with the times - that Solaris installations are
growing far fewer percentage-wise; this latest change may just be a
simple recognition of fact and adaptation to it. I've spoken to many
people in the large corporate culture, in many places and many different
companies, and have heard the story/complaint/simple fact repeated many
times: "so this new guy comes into IT, and before anybody knows it, he's
got 30 Linux boxes up in one day..." Cost of software: zero. Cost of
machines: hauled out of a closet where it was stored due to being old
and unusable. That's a <EM>hard</EM> combination for a commercial machine+OS to
beat, stony hard - and companies that _aren't_ having to spend a million
bucks a year on buying new are starting to notice. Many of them -
including banks, the traditional stronghold of conservatism - are
quietly dropping their "no non-commercial OSes" policy.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Sun is an <em>  excellent  </em> hardware company; the cost of their gadgets is
quite high as compared to the commodity PC, but the quality and the
reliability that you get from the stuff can be absolutely stunning to
someone who's never experienced them. I've never had Sun stuff "fight"
me the way, e.g., a PC SCSI card has; the documentations was always
available, and the relevant setup was as obvious as it could be made and
robust. Solaris, seen in that light, has always been a house divided
against itself - and Sun appears to have finally resolved the ambiguity.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Bravo; bravo indeed. The Open Source world has grown - and it's quite

And I got a $1 CD from a thrift shop this weekend that looked like punk
from the cover but was metal, ugh.  A black-and-white cartoon of a chick
with boxing gloves punching out a dude.  But I can't complain; I got nine
CDs for $9, so the two that I liked cost $4.50 each.  One is Global
Communication's ambient album, which I already have but I got a second
copy for when the first one breaks.  I had this album originally when it
came out in 1994, but all my CDs were stolen in 1998.  Then I forgot about
it until a roommate moved in who was an electronic DJ, and I started
remembering all the ambient stuff I used to like.  But GC vanished without
a trace after putting out one album, which wasn't popular but to me is the
best ambient album ever.  So I looked for two years for a copy, then
finally found one last year at a used record store.  But I really distrust
CDs, you never know when they'll self-destruct for no visible reason.
I've gone back to vinyl for everything that's available on it, because if
it skips you can <EM>see</EM> what the problem is, and if it has no visible
scratches it'll play on any record player, period.  Contrary to my CD
player which sometimes plays certain disks and sometimes won't, and won't
play disks my computer plays perfectly, and won't play CD-R's at all.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The other CD I got was Buck O'Nine.  I remembered the name but couldn't
remember what they sounded like.  But it was from Taang Records (a little
oi label in LA) so I figured it must be at least passable.  Turned out to
be a third-wave ska group.  Mediocre but OK.

A propos of nothing in particular, though I've never seen the flick in

popcorn-worthy, and was not disappointed.

"What started out as an election contest between Democrat Christine
Gregoire and Republican Dino Rossi may be turning into a fight between
Democratic felons and Republican felons.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In the ongoing dispute over Gregoire's 129-vote victory over Rossi in
the governor's race, the state Democratic Party said yesterday it has
sent the GOP a list of 428 felons who apparently cast illegal votes in
the election.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Eventually, state Democratic Party Chairman Paul Berendt said, his side
expects to meet or beat the total of 946 felon voters the GOP has
claimed in its legal challenge to the election, set for trial May 23 in

On the other hand, the vast majority of people are seething mad the
parties got the courts to overturn the blanket primary system (where
people could vote for any candidate regardless of party).  The parties
(R, D, and Libertarian) claim they have the right to choose candidates
without interference from non-members.  The people say they have the
right to ignore whatever the parties want, and view it as a power grab
by the parties to gain influence.  Curiously, the parties can't prevent
self-proclaimed Rs and Ds from getting on the ballot even if the party
disapproves, haha.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have to say, Gregoire was fully ready to concede if she lost.  Rossi
(and moreso the GOP chairman) are acting like elections are only
legitimate if they win.  One side takes pains to enfranchise all
qualified voters; the other side worries about felons voting.  (Hint:
the side that's more concerned about felons than enfranchisement is the
same party Jeb Bush belongs to.)  And they wonder why we question their
commitment to democracy....

I think both parties have about the same level of disrespect for
democracy/rule of law. I hate the concept of a recount. We're going to
count the votes over, using the exact method we used the first time, and
the results are somehow going to be more accurate. It would probably
work better if we said "no recounts, coin flip in case of ties".
Seriously. If you have a tie, what's a fair way to break it? Flipping a
coin is as good as any other way I can think of.

Nobody has dared touch the issue of why are felons prevented from voting
anyway?  Are people afraid they'll vote for candidates who'll overturn
the laws they were convicted on?  Puh-lease, there aren't enough felons
to make a difference in that.  I suppose a more likely scenario is a
governor courting the "felon vote" and then pardoning them all, but even
that's ridiculous.  One "Politician for the Cons" headline and they'd be
creamed at the polls.  As for arbitrarily restricting felons' rights to
make life uncomfortable for them, there are rights and there's the
fundamental characteristic of democracy.  Which part of
d-e-m-o-c-r-a-c-y don't they understand?  Have they not heard of
taxation without representation?

Well, everybody pays taxes, through inflation and the higher prices they
cause. I'm 17, working (part-time), paying taxes, and I can't vote. Is
that so wrong? I don't really think so. The nation as a whole is
probably better off without the under-18 crowd voting. But it's hard to
talk like that. Would 16 be a better voting age? 21? We've essentially
said "Everybody has the right to vote, except for..." and then proceed
to exclude those who we feel would abuse the privledge. And trouble is,
we're right. Think if literally everyone could vote. Can you imagine a
6-year-old kid trying to understand the issues involved? So we take
blocs of the population and tell them they can't vote 'cause they're not
smart enough. I'm not sure if that's okay or not, but I think the
alternative is worse.

This makes a lot more sense when you come to realize that most Roman
political structures were designed so that you couldn't get ahead by
stabbing your colleague. Given some of their early (pre-Republican)
history, this is not in the least surprising.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The weakness of this system was, of course, demonstrated when you had
two consuls who hated each other (Gaius Julius Caesar, everybody's
favorite fair-haired boy-hero, was paired up with such a critter during
one of his terms, but - as usual - managed to work his way around the
obstruction); nothing would get done due to constant deadlocks.
However, most Romans - at least those who got to that exalted position -
cared enough about their prestige (<TT>/dignitas/</TT> and <TT>/auctoritas/</TT> both)
that they would try to at least work out some sort of compromise for the
good of Rome.

The lady at the tea shop
insisted Dragon Phoenix Pearl was the same thing, but I was afraid to try
the pearls because it looked like the disgusting Tea of Inquiry (roasted
rice) I had the displeasure of trying once.  She said the pearls would
unfold when it was steeped.  Well, they did unfold, and it tastes almost
but not quite as good as loose green tea with Jasmine flowers.  Actually,
it tastes kind of like root beer.  Jasmine green has now beaten Earl Green

Usenet thread in question (cross-posted between rec.sport.cricket and
comp.lang.python) features some amiable railery about regional accents
and cultural perception thereof, e.g., traditional jokes about
unsophisticated Kerrymen in Eire, the West Country and Yorkshire in the
UK, "Ockers" in Australia.  (The latter term is not regional but denotes
a rough-hewn, rustic working man, and is taken from the name of a
character played by Aussie comedian Ron Frazer on the satire programme
"The Mavis Bramston Show", 1965-68.  It's a variant form of "Oscar".)

I'd forgotten about this one, having moved back to the USA so many years
ago, and adopted Yank pronunciation in most matters:  In American usage,
silent-h "herb" denotes a plant leaf used for food or medicine,
distinguishing it form hard-h "Herb" as a given name.  In Commonwealth
English, the h is always pronounced.

Taken either from Greek "basilikon" = royal or Latin "basilisk".  Either
way, the American hard-a departs further from the historic pattern.
Interesting to note that, again, Yanks use different pronuncation for
the given name "Basil", to distinguish it from the herb.

Against this background he said basil was
so-named because it was considered the "king" of herbs.  So I guess
basil has a long and honorable history in Greek.  As for basiliscus, it
seems to come from basileus too.  "dict basilisk" says:

I'm no authority on regional usage, since travel has made me hopelessly

Incidentally, when I was growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, we lived
in several US states.  Though it may have just been one of those bizarre
results of chance, it wasn't until the late 1970s that I came across
"buffet" to refer to a self-service meal.  Prior to that, the only word
I'd ever encountered for that was "smorgasbord."  (central California,
Florida, Tennessee)  Since 1980 or so, I've seen the word "smorgasbord"
at a restaurant only once, as far as I can remember.

I've never heard "smorgasbord" used for an actual meal, only buffet.  Bay
Area 1966-72, Seattle 72-onward.  Half the Seattle natives are Norwegian
to some degree (as I am), so you'd think they'd have lots of smorgasbords.
But no.  "Smorgasbord" seems to be more an abstract term, meaning "lots
of different food together".  Buffets require a dedicated serving table,
but smorgasbords don't.  A large dining table with people around it and a
wide variety of food in the middle is also a smorgasbord.  But smorgasbord
also connotes "sandwich fixin's" -- little slices of bread, cold cuts,
cheese, sliced vegetables.  A typical family-style dinner (meat, potatoes,
salad, cooked vegetables) is not a smorgasbord.  A Thanksgiving dinner,
maybe.

"dict smorgasbord" has an amusingly precise definition (WordNet):  "an

Dear Word Detective: English is not my mother tongue, and sometimes I

Could you please tell me something about its meaning and origin (if it

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Smorgasbord" does indeed exist in English, and I'm surprised that your
co-workers don't know it. A "smorgasbord" is an offering of food,
ranging from simple hors d'oeuvres to a full dinner, presented as a
serve-yourself spread on a sideboard or table separate from where diners
are seated. Granted, "smorgasbord" started out as a Swedish word, but it
has been used frequently in English since the late 19th century, long
enough to qualify as an English word as well.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The roots of "smorgasbord" speak to its origins as an assortment of
simple appetizers set out for dinner guests. "Smorgas" in Swedish means
"slice of bread and butter" (the "smor" is related to the English
"smear"), and "bord" simply means "board," or in this case "table."

Today, however, the term is usually taken to mean a full and often
elaborate assortment of dishes, and any host who led his guests to
expect a "smorgasbord" and presented them with naught but bread and
butter might well end up on the evening news. Since the late 1940s,
"smorgasbord" has also been used in a metaphorical sense to mean "a wide
variety or range," as in "The defendant faces a smorgasbord of charges
ranging from mopery to vote tampering."

If
your friends are unfamiliar with the word, it's probably because they
know the "serve yourself" dining arrangement as a "buffet," a meal, like
a "smorgasbord," served on a sideboard or separate table. "Buffet" is an
imported French word of unknown origin for a side table, common in
English since the early 18th century. "Buffet" dining in the U.S. today,
aside from dinner parties and the wretched "breakfast buffet" offered in
many motels, is usually found in all-you-can-eat emporiums where
customers can (and, from the looks of some of them, do) graze until the
cows come home.

Isaac Asimov (an accomplished biochemist before he became Master
Explainer to the world) once lavished one of his very engaging essays,
entitled "The Mispronounced Metal", in _The Magazine of Fantasy and
Science Fiction_ (Oct. 1973, reprinted in <em>  Of Matters Great and Small ,</em> 
1975) on this question:  He pointed out that Humphry Davy, discoverer of
the element, at first used "alumium" for the element in 1808, but soon
thereafter changed that to "aluminum" (current American usage), to match
the Latin root.  As he discovered and named other elements, though,
those tended to get "ium" suffixes:  potassium, sodium, magnesium,
calcium, strontium.  So, he agreed in 1812 to change element 13 to
"aluminium" in the name of uniformity.  Americans at first used this
form, but then went back to "aluminum" in the late 1800s.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Asimov provided a scholarly but very entertaining explanation (which I
can no longer recall) of why the chemistry and physics of the element --
even if not spelling uniformity with other Davy-discovered elements --
strongly favours "aluminum", not "aluminium".  I can't find the essay
online (no surprise), but did find this citation of its opening
paragraph:

What do you call that nice, shiny white metal they use to make
sidings and airplanes out of? Aluminum, right? Aluminum, pronounced

hear anything so ridiculous? The French and Germans spell it
'aluminium', too, but they're foreigners who don't speak
Earth-standard.  You'd think the British, however, using our

When Humphrey Davey believed he had isolated a metal from alumina, he
called it "aluminum".  However, due to the chance vagaries of
language, many metals were prepared from compounds ending in "i", and
became therefore ----ium.  The momentum of the times carried aluminum
with it.

<blockQuote>
Until 1880 no element had an English name with more than four
syllables, except aluminum in Britain.  Even now, those that do are
not common.

<blockQuote>
Therefore, it is <EM>aluminum</EM>, NOT <EM>aluminium</EM>.

I would speculate that the latter forms are not any form of Americanism,

Now, granted, I don't hear the name said aloud very often, but...

Shawn is an American spelling of Sean (which is not an English name, by the 
way, it's Irish. It does appear in Scotland, but IIRC, the Gaelic version is 
Ian). Caitlin is also an Irish name, pronounced the same as 'Kathleen', not 
'Kate Lynn'.

At the risk of sounding (or being) stubborn, I'd say this means you've
encountered people not familiar with the name, all the way from

It's a Basque name, the <em>  only  </em> Basque name (to my knowledge) that gets any
kind of exposure outside that small mountain region -- and known to the
world because of the tireless -- but mostly futile -- Jesuit missionary
work of one Francis Xavier (1506-1552) in Japan.

It has also become a common Spanish name, including LG's own Javier
Malonda.  Spanish pronounces x like Spanish j (kh) and sometimes spells it
that way too: Quixote/Quijote, Mexico/Mejico, Texas/Tejas. 
(Interestingly, I've never seen texano, only tejano ("person from Texas").
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>
X at the start of a word is usually pronounced z (xylophone, Xerxes), so
Xavier follows that tradition.  But it can be hard not to say Ksevier when
you're reading the word (as opposed to remembering how people say it).

Rome canonised him in 1622, even though the man spent a huge amount of
the Society of Jesus's wealth trying to convert the Japanese, with only
about 1% success for their pains.  Xavier's biggest problem, fatal to
his ambitions, was that he hadn't a clue about Japanese internal
politics, wasn't aware that the emperor he pinned all his hopes on was a
figurehead, and wasn't aware that he himself was a pawn in Japan's
ongoing civil wars.

Anyhow, the name is reasonably well known in Spanish-speaking countries,
especially among devout Catholics, but pretty darned exotic in
English-speaking ones.  Two out of three people in your office tried to
tackle an impossibly difficult-looking, foreign name that they didn't
know, and missed.  That doesn't tell you bupkes about "standard
pronunciation".

I think English-speakers everywhere, including the USA (and yes, in

Really?  As with "ah-thuh-lete", I wince and pity the speaker -- which
is the sort of response that makes possible the theatrical
anti-Eastern-liberal-elitism posture some people aim at, in deliberately
adopting those and similar examples of semiliterate pronunciation.  Thus
my point.

I guess I'm too much of a philistine.  Nook-you-lr and ath-uh-leet are
what I grew up saying coz everybody said it that way.  At some point I
unconsciously switched to nook-lee-r most of the time but never 100%.
(Maybe.  I don't know which one I say when I'm not consciously thinking
about it.)  Certainly I've never heard "nukular is wrong" or "nucular
sounds uneducated" before.

[blink] Mike, are you serious? Over time, I've probably seen hundreds if
not thousands of occasions where someone lampoons that pronunciation in
order to imply ignorance. From the other direction, I don't think I've
heard even a dozen people use "nukular" in a serious fashion.  As to
"ath-uh-leet" - although I don't think it gets used the same way as
"nukular", to me it implies at least a lack of linguistic
sophistication. IMO, it's a regional variant, generally in the South:
since I'm in Atlanta right now, I would not be surprised if I heard it,
especially from older black people.

English pronunciation is a notorious basket case, for readily understood
historical reasons (being the result of a violent collision between a
dialect of lowland German aka Old English and late Gallic Latin aka
Norman French), but not generally to the point of inventing entire
imaginary syllables.

The <em>  Brits ,</em>  now:  They do excruciating things to words, especially
those of French extraction, but also others for which they have no
excuse (Marylebone, lieutenant, Ralph, Worchestershire, Chomondeley)
-- but their sin is generally <em>  dropping  </em> entire syllables or using odd
but barely logical sounds in them.  Not dropping in extra rubbish in a
manner suggesting a whole tribe of people all aping the same dyslexic
and never bothering to check the spelling.

I can imagine an actor playing an uneducated Texan saying, "I don't know
if that newfangled nook-you-lr ree-act-or we got in town is safe."  That

Heh. I tried the Tagalog and Polish samples, because I work with native
speakers of both, and none of the samples sounded anything like the
people I work with. In fairness, though, the samples seem to be of
people who have been speaking English for a fairly long time - the
Polish samples had 'th' sounds (the people I know generally go with 'd'
for the 'th' in 'brother' and 't' or 'f' for the 'th' in 'things' (apart
from one girl, who manages to say 'tf' there)) and the Tagalog samples
have 'f' and 'v' sounds (most of the guys I know can't manage either,
except when they're saying 'for fuck's sake', in which case they say it
with a fairly thick Irish accent

[About a virtual reality experiment gone horribly wrong, but in this

"I don't know how you stand that woman the way you do," Sherri said.
"She's so gross with her 'I've got this' and 'I've got that' all the
time.  But you can just stand there and say 'that's nice' like you do.
You'll have to teach me how to do it.

Corrigan smiled wryly.  "Oh, that's an old Irish story," he said.
"You'd have no problem if you knew it."

"Well, tell me, then," Sherri invited....
</STRONG></P>

"It's like this," he said.  "Two woman are sharing a hospital room in
Dublin, you see.  One is from Foxrock.  That's south of the city, where
all the money is -- she'd be one of your Delilas.  The other's the
complete opposite: bottom end of the social spectrum--what we'd call a
roight auld slag."
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"You mean like parts of the South Bronx?"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"Maybe.  Anyway, Delila wants to make sure there's no mkstake about who
she is, see.  So she says to the other..."  Corrigan mimicked a prim
tone:  "'Ah, I hope you don't imagine I am accustomed to sharing like
this.   Usually, I go to the private wing.'"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
He changed to a shrill, coarser accent.  "'Oh, yiss?' says the other,
who we'll say was Mary.  'Dat's noice.'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'I'll have you know,' says Delila, 'that my husband is an extrememly
successful man and takes very good care of me.  The last time I was a
patient, he took me on a Carribean cruise to recuperate.'
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"'Dat's noice.'

"'And on the occasion before that, he bought me a diamond pendant to
