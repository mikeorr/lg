Hey all,
</p>

<p>
As I am sure many of you know, I don't get on with hardware.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
Thanks to Ben's suggestion I now have a USB Sun keyboard though, and
despite people's horrific claims, <strong>I</strong> at least like it.  So thanks,
Ben.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
My next question concerns a possibe replacement for my workstation.
I've had my current PC for about three years now, kindly donated by a
friend of mine.  It's a nice system, but it needs replacing.  I've had
enough of the CPU being at 70C plus, despite cooling attempts.
</p>

<p>
So I was looking at buying a Shuttle PC.  Specifically the SD39P2
which would be a bare-bones system [1].  What I'm curious to know is
whether any of you have used one, and how they stack up against a
regular PC?  My reading suggests they can act as a pretty good desktop
replacements.  Whilst the model I'm looking at only has two PCI slots,
I only really need to add a wireless PCI card and an NVidia graphics
card, so that's perfect.
</p>

<p>
Does the model I'm listing [1] suggest any problems with running Linux
on it?  I can't see how it would at a cursive glance of what's
available.  My only real reservation is what would be the driving
force of me buying this model when I could go to Dell and spend an
equivalent amount of money and get a whole lot more.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Kindly,
</p>

<p>
Thomas Adam

If you are looking for small form factor machines you should probably
check Mac-Mini (and the AOpen(?) open spec version). These come with
bluetooth, wifi, ethernet and a couple of USB ports in addition to
the usual HDD and CD drive for about $300-400.
</p>

<p>
The shuttle is IMHO only an alternative if you want to tinker around
(or want someone else to tinker around) with the inside. Even then
the AOPen machine with its open specs may compete. The Mac Mini like
other Macs should probably not be opened except by a company man.

Ah, yes.  I don't want a Mac-Mini though.  I don't like the thought of
it going wrong, and as you have said already, if it goes bang, the
only people who can open it are Apple themselves.  For a computer...
that just seems wrong.
</p>

<p>
I'll look into the AOpen.  I know I've heard of them.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

A colleague uses them as desktop machines and he is quite satisfied.
I just checked the hardware on the SD39P2 and it seems the Linux kernel
has drivers (the BCM5789 is supported, as is the ICH7R controller).

<p>
I don't think so. Most of the new Intel-based systems run fine (I tried
several new Asus boards with an Core 2 Duo CPU), you just have to be
careful about the new Ethernet and PATA/SATA chips.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.

Yup -- that was the conclusion I came to as well, which is good.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Well that's OK.  Nothing I have here runs SATA, I only have IDE drives
at present.

Well -- we run two older shuttles with Intel P4s  here and do even some
number crunching on them. They are pretty stable, they did take a new
graphics card and a gigabit ethernet (which wasn't on board in this old
version) and they are not extremely silent -- but astonishingly quiet
considering they sit right next to you on the desk. The heat pipes seem
to work pretty well, and thats the realy TDP nightmare generation of
P4s we have in there.
</p>

<p>
What is a bit limiting -- the two PCI slots only. There is no way put
anything additional in now. No second HD (-&gt; no raid), no second
optical drive (-&gt; burner has to do all the reading as well -- but
considering the price drop on standard burners thats no big deal).
</p>

<p>
So if you fancy the small size and don't want to have a bix box sitting
under your desk -- I would go for something in the shuttle category.

Well, I did just that.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  I am now a proud owner of a Shuttle-SD39P2
with an Intel Core 2 Quad CPU (2.4 GHz), 2GiB RAM, a 500 GiB SATA
drive and an NVidia card.  This thing is damn quiet, and not to
mention it <strong>flies</strong>.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't all that difficult to put together, either.  Took me about
an hour; the instructions that come with it are very clear, with a
step-by-step process.  I think I might have used a little too much
silver thermal paste.  According to the BIOS the machine is running at
about ~43C over all, which is a vast improvement over my 70C+ startup
temperature with the old Athlon XP chip.

<p>
Thanks all for the recommendations.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
