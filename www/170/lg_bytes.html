<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Novell Collaboration Platform for E2.0 Links to Google Wave</h3>

<p>In early November, Novell announced its real-time collaboration
platform, Novell Pulse. Pulse combines e-mail, document authoring, and
social messaging tools with robust security and management
capabilities.</p>

<p>Novell Pulse was demonstrated on November 4, 2009, during the
"Integrating Google Wave into the Enterprise" keynote at Enterprise 2.0 in
San Francisco.  Beta availability will be early 2010, followed by 
general availability in the first half of 2010 via cloud deployment. Novell
Pulse interacts with Google Wave through Wave's federation protocol,
letting Novell Pulse users communicate in real-time with users on any
other Wave provider.</p>

<p>"We designed Google Wave and its open federation protocol to help
people collaborate and communicate more efficiently", said Lars
Rasmussen, software engineering manager for Google Wave. "We are very
excited to see Novell supporting Wave federation in its innovative
Novell Pulse product."</p>

<p>"Security and identity management remain top concerns for 
companies considering real-time social solutions", said Caroline Dangson,
analyst at IDC.  "Novell has a proven record in security and identity
management, an important strength for its new collaboration platform."</p>

<p>Key features draw on best practices for e-mail, instant messaging,
document sharing, social connections, real-time co-editing, and enterprise
control. These include single sign on, identity management, editable
on-line documents, and a unified inbox.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">ECMA Proposes Revised JavaScript Standard</h3>

<p>The future of JavaScript - at least for the next 3 years - will be
determined by ECMA's General Assembly in early December.  At that
time, ECMA's membership will vote on the ECMAScript 3.1 proposal, a
technology compromise from ECMA's contentious Technical Committee 39.</p>

<p>Factions within TC39 worked on JavaScript revision for several years,
but AJAX's success upped the stakes for v. 4.0 - which is far from
complete - so a smaller set of improvements went into the 3.1 draft.
However, both Adobe and IBM are dissatisfied, and are lobbying to defeat
it.</p>

<p>Doug Crockford, who represents Yahoo on TC39, delivered a keynote on
the draft spec and its importance recently, at QCon in San Francisco.
Doug explained that the sudden explosion in use of JavaScript (formally
called ECMAScript) - both upped the stakes on revisions and intensified
risks.  One example is an on-going problem with representing decimal
numbers.   Original JavaScript can represent small and large integers,
but often gives erroneous results for decimal arithmetic (e.g., 0.1 +
0.2 != 0.3).</p>

<p>IBM has proposed a revision ("754-r") to the 1970s-era IEEE 754 spec
for floating point processing.  However, this change would result in
significant performance penalties on arithmetic unless implemented in
silicon, which IBM has already done in Power CPUs.  Speaking with
<em>Linux Gazette</em>, Doug said IBM may be attempting to increase the
value of its Power servers, or may be encouraging Intel to modify its own
chips.</p>

<p>The committee is also discussing a longer-term set of changes to
JavaScript / ECMAScript, with a working title of Harmony. Some additions
could include enhanced functions and inclusion of a standard crypto
library.  However, many of those changes could break existing Web
applications; implementations will have to do as little damage as
possible.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Fedora 12 Released in November</h3>
<p>The Fedora Project, Red Hat's community-supported open source group,
announced availability of Fedora 12, the latest version of its free,
open-source distribution.  The new release includes robust features for
desktop users, administrators, developers, and open source enthusiasts.
Enhancements include next-generation Ogg Theora video, virtualization
improvements, and new capabilities for NetworkManager.  </p>

<p>"Fedora always tries to include cutting-edge features in its
distribution.  We believe Fedora 12 stays true to this pattern, packing
a lot of punch across its feature set", said Paul Frields, Fedora Project
Leader at Red Hat. "Our community of global contributors continues to
expand, with 25 percent growth in Fedora Accounts since 
Fedora 11. We've also seen more than 2.3 million installations of Fedora
11 thus far, a 20 percent increase over earlier releases."</p>

<p>Notable feature enhancements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Theora 1.1, enhancing free video's quality to better meet user
expectations. Ogg Theora video delivers crisp, vibrant media, letting
users stream and download high-definition video, while using 100 percent
free and open software, codecs, and formats.</li>
<li>NetworkManager, a network configuration tool, has been improved to
make it easier for users to be online using mobile broadband, to
configure servers, and to handle other special situations.</li>
<li>Virtualization improvements include better virtual disk performance
and storage discovery, hot changes for virtual network interfaces,
reduced memory consumption, and modern network booting infrastructure.
</li>

</ul>

<p>Other improvements are PackageKit command-line and browser plugins;
better file compression; libguestfs, which lets administrators work
directly with virtual guest machine disk images without booting those
guests; SystemTap 1.0, to help developers trace and gather information
for writing and debugging programs, as well as integration with the
widely-used Eclipse IDE; and NetBeans 6.7.1.</p>

<p>The Fedora community held fifteen Fedora Activity Day events across
the globe in 2009. These are mini-conferences where Fedora experts work
on a specific set of tasks, ranging from developing new features and Web
applications to showing contributors how to get involved by working on
simple tasks.  During that same period, the Project also held three
Fedora Users and Developers Conferences (FUDCons), in Boston, Porto
Alegre, and Berlin.</p>

<p>The next FUDCon is scheduled for December 5 - 7, 2009, in Toronto,
Ontario, Canada. For more information about FUDCon Toronto 2009, visit <a
href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FUDCon:Toronto_2009</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Knoppix 6.2 Released</h3>

<p>"Microknoppix" is a complete rewrite of the Knoppix boot system from 
version 6.0 and up, with the following features: </p>

<ol>
<li>High compatibility with its Debian base: Aside from 
configuration files, nothing gets changed in Debian's standard 
installation.
<li>Accelerated boot procedure: Independently from the usual SysV 
bootscripts, multiple tasks of system initialization are run in 
parallel, so the user reaches an interactive desktop very quickly.
<li>LXDE, a very slim and fast desktop with short start time and 
low resource requirements, is the desktop environment. Because of 
its GTK2 base, LXDE works together nicely with screenreader Orca.
<li>Installed software in this first CD version has been greatly 
reduced, so that custom CD remasters are again possible. The 
DVD edition offers KDE4 and GNOME, with many applications
originating from these popular desktops.
<li>Network configuration is handled by NetworkManager with 
nm-applet in graphics mode, and by textual GUIs in text mode 
(compatible with Debian's /etc/network/interfaces specification).
<li>A persistent image for saving personal settings, and additionally 
installed programs, KNOPPIX/knoppix-data.img, is supported on the 
boot device, optionally encrypted using 256-bit AES. In general, 
Knoppix recommends live system installation on flash. </ol>

<p>The current 6.2 release has been completely updated from Debian
"Lenny".</p>

<p>Also included is A.D.R.I.A.N.E. (Audio Desktop Reference Implementation
And Networking Environment), a talking menu system, which is supposed to
make work and Internet access easier for computer beginners.</p>

<p>The current public 6.2 beta (CD or DVD) is available 
in different variants at the Knoppix Mirrors Web site 
(<a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/index-en.html">http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/index-en.html</a>).</p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intalio Announces Jetty 7</h3>
<p>Intalio, Inc., has released Jetty 7, a lightweight open source
Java application server. The new release includes features 
to extend Jetty's reach into mission-critical environments, and 
support deployment in cloud computing.</p>

<p>Jetty 7 brings performance optimizations to enable rich Web
applications. Thanks to small memory footprint, Jetty has become the
most popular app server for embedding into other open source projects,
including ActiveMQ, Alfresco, Equinox, Felix, FUSE, Geronimo,
GigaSpaces, JRuby, Liferay, Maven, Nuxeo, OFBiz, and Tungsten. Jetty is
also the standard Java app server in cloud computing services, such as
Google's AppEngine and Web Toolkit, Yahoo's Hadoop and Zimbra, and
Eucalytpus.</p>

<p>This is the first Jetty release developed in partnership with
Eclipse.org, where the codebase has gone through IP auditing, dual
licensing, and improved packaging for such things as OSGi integration. 
In addition, Jetty 7 makes some of the key servlet 3.0 features, such as
asynchronous transactions and fragments, available in a servlet 2.5
container.</p>

<p>Jetty provides both asynchronous HTTP server and asynchronous HTTP
client, thereby supporting both ends of protocols such as Bayeux, XMPP,
and Google Wave, that are critical to cloud computing &mdash; and can be
embedded in small and mobile devices:  Today, Jetty runs on J2ME and
Google Android, and is powering new smartphones from Verizon and other
manufacturers soon to start production.</p>

<p>"Jetty 7 significantly reorganizes packaging and jars, and makes 
fundamental improvements to the engine's underlying infrastructure",
said Adam Lieber, General Manager at IntalioWorks.</p>

<p>The Jetty distribution is available via <a
href="http://eclipse.org/jetty">http://eclipse.org/jetty</a> under 
the Apache 2.0 or Eclipse 1.0 licenses, and covered by the
Eclipse Foundation Software User Agreement. The distribution furnishes
core functionality of HTTP server, servlet container, and HTTP client.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">One Stop Systems Introduces First GPU/SSD 2U Server</h3>
<p>One Stop Systems, Inc. (OSS), a manufacturer of computer modules and
systems, announced the first server to integrate an AMD-based
motherboard featuring dual "Istanbul" processors and eight GPU boards
providing 10 TeraFLOPS computing power. The server can also accommodate
a combination of GPU boards and SSD (solid state drive) boards.</p>

<p>Four GPU boards and four 640GB SSD boards provides 5TFLOPS GPU
processing and 2.5TB memory, in addition to the dual six-core CPUs'
computing power. In addition, OSS has packed even more storage capacity
into the system, with four hot-swappable hard disk drives and an internal
RAID controller. The server is powered by dual, redundant 1,500 watt
power supplies and housed in a 2U-high chassis tailored for rigorous
environmental demands.</p>
 
<p>"The Integrated GPU Server represents a combination of One Stop
Systems's areas of expertise; designing and manufacturing
rugged, rackmount computers and PCI Express design", said Steve Cooper,
CEO. "At the heart of this server is the dual Opteron processor board.
With a motherboard based on the SHBe (System Host Board Express) form
factor for industrial computing, it's built for long-life service.
Then, we employed multiple PCIe switches to provide the 80Gb/s bandwidth
to each slot. Using the latest AMD-based GPU boards, we produce
greater than 10 TFLOPS  of computing power. The system is then powered
by dual redundant 1,500 watt power supplies with ample cooling."</p>

<p>The system supports two six-core Opteron processors and up to 96GB
DRAM in six DDR2 DIMM slots, plus dual gigabit Ethernet ports, four USB,
PCI Express 2.0, and ATI Radeon graphics. It supports four SATAII/SAS
drives, and includes an LSI RAID controller.</p>

<p>The system can be configured to provide eight PCIe x16 Gen 2 slots for 
single-wide I/O cards, or four slots for double-wide cards. While GPUs 
offer the greatest amount of compute power, customers who want to mix 
other cards in the system can do so. A common example is to install 
two or four GPU boards with four SSD (solid state drive) boards.</p>
