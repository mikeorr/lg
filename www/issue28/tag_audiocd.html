		Right Speaker Channel</H3>

<p><strong>From Birger Koblitz on Fri, 24 Apr 1998</strong></p>

<p><strong>
Hi,
<br>I'v got a strange problem with my Toshiba 12X-SCSI-CDRom and 
<tt>xmcd</tt>. Since I started to use this program, music from audio CDs 
is only played through the left speaker, the right speaker is dead. The 
strange thing is, all this worked well on Windoze before. Now even the 
windoze player uses only the left channel. This doesend seem to be a 
hardware problem allthough there now is only one channel available out of 
the Headphone connector on the front of the device,too, since I tried the 
progam also at a friend with a Sanyo SCSI-CDRom resulting in the same 
problem (but both channels available from the front plug there). My friend 
is now quite angry since evrything worked fine under windoze for him before...
It seems that xmcd turns of one of the channels of the CDRom. Sadly
using the balance control within <tt>xmcd</tt> doesnt turn it on any more. Is
there a way to get things working again?

<br><br>
Yours, Birger.

	align="left" border="0">That's 
	very odd.  I've never heard of any CD's or 
	sound cards with NVRAM in them.  I presume  you've 
	powered off the affected systems, let them sit for 
	a minute or two and tried again (under the formerly 
	"known working" configuration).

<br><br>
	I suppose it would give offense to suggest that you 
	actually check the wires that lead to that speaker?
	
<br><br>
	Traditionally I've been a curmudgeon about "toys" like
	CD players and sound cards (never used them under DOS,
	Windows or Linux).  My traditional opinion has been that
	CD-ROM's are for data --- and that there are perfectly 
	good, inexpensive, devices for playing audio CD's ---
	devices that require no special drivers and have no
	opportunity to conflict with your other equipment and
	software.  (You don't want to know how I feel about those
	loathsome bandwidth robbers with their "Internet Telephone" 
	and "Cyber Video Phone" toys either.  That's <em>our</em> bandwidth
	they're hogging).

<br><br>
	However, yesterday (by coincidence) I bit the bullet and 
	spent a little time compiling a new kernel with sound support.
	Then I went into the CMOS and re-enabled the sound support that's 
	on the motherboard of that machine I bought from VAResearch.

<br><br>
	So, I slipped in a copy of Aaron Copeland's Greatest Hits, 
	logged into to my virtual console, (I still prefer text consoles 
	for most of my work, especially for e-mail), fired up <tt>xmcd</tt> 
	(X Motif CD Player) and let it loose.

<br><br>
	Strains of "<em>Celebration</em>" are streaming out of both
	speakers as I type this.   (Yes, I [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[F1]'d 
	back to my text console after starting <tt>xmcd</tt>).

<br><br>
	So, it's not inherently a problem with <tt>xmcd</tt> under Linux.
	This particular installation is a S.u.S.E. 5.1 running
	under a 2.1.97 kernel that I just grabbed off of 
	<a href="http://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a> yesterday.
	
<br><br>
	So, that leave us with other questions.  

<br><br>
	Do you have a sound card or are you playing this through a
	headphone jack on the front of your CD player?  (I'm not 
	familiar with the specific CD drives to which you refer, but
	many of them have built in head phone jacks.  Mine is a 
	Toshiba 3801 which I gather is sold as a 15x drive).

<br><br>
	Are there any configuration or diagnostic utilities for your
	CD drive and/or sound card?  (Presumably they would be DOS
	or Win '95 utilities that shipped with the device or that you
	might get from their web site, ftp site, or BBS).
	
<br><br>
	Have you called your CD-ROM or sound card vendors (or 
	BCC'd their support on this e-mail)?

<br><br>
	Did you do an Alta Vista or Yahoo! search?  (I used
	"<tt>+xmcd +sound +problem</tt>") or check out the 
	<tt>xmcd</tt> home page:

<br><blockquote>
		<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/~cddb/xmcd/"
		>http://sunsite.unc.edu/~cddb/xmcd/</a>

</blockquote><br>
	... which has links to their FAQ (and other useful) info.

<br><br>
        There was an FAQ entry about 
        <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/~cddb/xmcd/faq.html#19"
                >Toshiba drives and "sometimes" getting "no sound."</a>  
        Although it doesn't sound like it matches your symptoms exactly 
        you might read that and try the suggestions they list.
	
<br><br>
	Just off hand I don't know of any newsgroups or mailing 
	lists that are particularly good venues for this questions 
	(which I suspect it why you sent it to me).  
	<a href="news://comp.os.linux.hardware"
		>news:comp.os.linux.hardware</a>
	might be one.  Another might be 
	<a HREF="news:comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.cd-rom"
		>news:comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.cd-rom</a>
	or <a HREF="news:alt.cd-rom">alt.cd-rom</a>.

<br><br>
	Hope that helps.  However, it's still hard to imagine
	any problem that would match these symptoms and persist
	through a power cycle (<em>not</em> just a reboot -- a power cycle).
