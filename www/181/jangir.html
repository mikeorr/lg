<h1>Linux Sound System</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/jangir.html">Mohan Lal Jangir</a></b></p>


<p>In two decades, Linux has grown from an early nascent stage to maturity.
In the field of multimedia, for example, today Linux supports almost all
audio/video formats and sound cards - something that was lacking in the
early days.  Sound support in Linux has had an interesting journey passing
through the different phases. This article aims to summarize the Linux
sound system development history, give a comparison of different
architectures, and conclude with two real (albeit small) audio
applications.</p>

<p>In 1992, Hannu Savolainen wrote the first driver for the Sound Blaster
card which was the only available sound card at that time. He called it the
Linux Sound Driver. As more sound cards appeared, he went on to develop the
Open Sound System (OSS) - one neat little package providing an API for
audio applications.</p>

<p>The OSS API was based on standard UNIX devices and system calls (i.e.
POSIX open, read, write, ioctl), and therefore developing audio
applications became pretty similar to developing other Linux applications.
<!-- This dangling clause makes no sense, unfortunately. - Ben
(for playing a sound, <i>"cat sample.wav &gt; /dev/dsp"</i> and for
capturing voice <i>"cat /dev/dsp &gt; sample.wav"</i> are good enough.)
-->
Moreover, audio applications were portable across all UNIX variant
operating systems (UNIX, Linux, BSD etc).</p>

<p>The OSS source code was released under the GPL, and Linux included OSS
in the mainline kernel. While OSS development was still in progress, Hannu
Savolainen was contracted by 4Front Technologies and they decided to make a
living with an OSS commercial version. Subsequently, Hannu stopped working
on the GPLed version of OSS and continued to develop the proprietary OSS
for 4Front Technologies.  The result was that kernel sound drivers were
frozen at OSS v3.8.</p>

<p>Later, Red Hat Software sponsored Alan Cox, a noted Linux developer, to
enhance and modularize the kernel sound drivers. Alan Cox and others made
many bug fixes and added drivers for new sound cards. The modified drivers
were released for the first time with Red Hat 5.0. Being under GPL, those
modifications were later included in the mainline Linux kernel. However,
the progress hit a road block after Red Hat stopped sponsoring Alan Cox, as
there was no dedicated maintainer for GPL OSS. </p>

<p>The pro-GPL community did not like OSS. In 1998 Jaroslav Kysela wrote a
driver for the Gravis Ultrasound soundcard, which he later developed into a
new sound architecture called ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture).
ALSA development went on independently until 2002, when ALSA was included
in the 2.5 kernel along with OSS.</p>

<p>ALSA architecture distinctly moved away from the POSIX API and
introduced a much bigger as well as a more complex API set. While the
pro-GPL community endorsed ALSA, it did not find much support from audio
application developers who had to re-write their applications using complex
ALSA API. The other factor was the risk of losing application portability
since ALSA is available only on Linux.</p>

<p>To overcome this problem, ALSA introduced an OSS emulation layer. This
made it possible to run OSS audio applications on the ALSA architecture
without modifying the application. </p>

<p>However, as anticipated, a heated discussion about the OSS and ALSA
merits/demerits started. ALSA was designed to have some additional features
which were not present in OSS at that time; however, OSS 4.0 (the
proprietary one) claimed to have fixed them all. While ALSA was criticized
for its complex API set, OSS had the advantage of having POSIX compliance.
On the other hand, OSS was criticized for its non-GPL status, somethign
that ALSA had in its favor.</p>

<p>Finally, ALSA got a big thumbs up from Linux: in the 2.6 kernel, Linux
replaced ALSA as default sound architecture and OSS was marked as being
deprecated. </p>

<p>In 2007, in a surprising move, 4Front Technologies released OSS v4.0
under GPL - which raised many eyebrows. While some experts termed it as "too
little and too late", some predicted it as a possible OSS re-entry into the
kernel.</p>

<p>Before we conclude the article, letâ€™s take a look at a small audio
application written using both APIs to see a real comparison.</p>

<p>This sample application can play an uncompressed PCM, 2-channel (stereo)
file. Following are the properties of the audio file shown by file command and
mplayer.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>
root@localhost:/root# file sample.wav <br>
sample.wav: RIFF (little-endian) data, WAVE audio, Microsoft PCM, 16 bit, stereo 44100 Hz <br>
<br>
root@localhost:/root# mplayer sample.wav<br>
==========================================================================<br>
Forced audio codec: mad<br>
Opening audio decoder: [pcm] Uncompressed PCM audio decoder<br>
AUDIO: 44100 Hz, 2 ch, s16le, 1411.2 kbit/100.00% (ratio: 176400-&gt;176400)<br>
Selected audio codec: [pcm] afm: pcm (Uncompressed PCM)<br>
==========================================================================<br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
You can use any .wav audio file with similar properties. We used a
.wav-format audio file because these are not encoded (for the same reason,
you should not use mp3 or other encoded audio files with this application.)
</p>

<p>Following table shows OSS and ALSA applications side by side:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snd_pcm_close(handle);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0;<br>
}<br>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The first difference you will observe is the APIs. As mentioned before,
the OSS application uses the POSIX APIs, while the ALSA application has
different ones. Also, when you compile the applications, note that the OSS
application compiles directly but the ALSA one must be linked with
<em>libasound</em> (which means you must have ALSA library installed).</p>

<p>The API differences and their capabilities is an endless debate. As of
the 2.6.36 kernel, Linux continues to use ALSA. However, many audio
application developers are keenly awaiting to see OSS alive!</p>
