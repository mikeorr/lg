I would like to thank everyone for their comments.  I do hope the topic has
not made too many peoples blood pressure to rise to "dangerous levels",
although it is clear a topic several people are passionate about.
 
In summary it looks to me that Linux could be used on one of two basis's;
 
</p>

<p>
1.	If we were not a UK company (or any company citied in the
restrictions).  To resolve this we could establish an off shore company to
provide the distribution to circumvent this restriction. 
</p>

<p>
2.	Encryption was removed from the package.  A task I believe is
relatively simple to achieve.
</p>

<p>
Two points I would like to make for your information and further comment is
that I believe the restriction on US content is 10% not 1% as one person
commented.  Secondly I will of course seek legal advice before proceeding
but wanted to see if this issue had been seen before, by the experts (the
legal guys don't tend to know what they are talking about anyway).
 
Thank you once again and if you have further advice on the issue it would be
gratefully appreciated.

[grin] Everyone is just fine, I'm sure; many of us were weaned on the
'vi vs. emacs' and 'KDE vs. Gnome' religious wars, so this wouldn't even
ruffle the surface. I do thank you for starting an interesting
discussion, though.

...and possibly get whacked for trying to circumvent the law in that
way, unless you were very, <strong>very</strong> clever about it.

<p>
Again, please don't take my opinion as any guarantee, but this approach
sounds to me like the right one - assuming it satisfies both the legal
and the technical requirements.

<p>
I think we've got a bit of confusion going on here. The numbers weren't
about the allowable export content or whatever - they were estimates of
US-based developers' contributions to Linux, which certainly exceeds
10%.

<p>
Well, they do have their bailiwick - but for commercial law, they need
to know a given industry's specific legal needs as well as its
challenges, and to have some experience in dealing with threading that
needle. Otherwise, you're right; since a lawyer's training is about
preserving the status quo and fitting everything within that box,
they're not worth much for dealing with new problems.
