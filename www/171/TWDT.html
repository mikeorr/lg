<p>
This is a pre-release of apertium-en-ca (because there are some bugs
you can't find until after you've released...)
</p>

<p>
New things:
<pre>
Vocabulary sync with apertium-en-es 0.7.0
English dialect support (British and American)
Initial support for Valentian forms
Start of Termcat import - Thanks to Termcat for allowing this, and to
Prompsit Language Engineering for facilitating it.
At the moment, only a few items have been important. They have mostly
been limited to terms which include ambiguous nouns (temps, estació,
etc.)
</pre>
Caveats:
</p>

<p>
The vocabulary sync is not complete: specifically, I skipped some
proverbs, and had to omit the verb 'blog'.
The Valentian support is not as complete as apertium-es-ca (on the
other hand, the English dialect support is better than en-es)
</p>

<p>
This release also includes several multiwords harvested from Francis
Tyers' initial investigations into lexical selection (and others
suggested by it).

<p>
Announcing apertium-ht-en 0.1.0
</p>

<p>
In response to a request from volunteers at Crisis Commons
(<a href='http://crisiscommons.org'>http://crisiscommons.org</a>), we have put some effort into creating
a Haitian Creole to English module for Apertium. We do not usually
make releases at such an early stage of development, but because of
the circumstances, we think it's better to make available something
that at least partly works, despite its numerous flaws, than to
hold off until we can meet our usual standards.
</p>

<p>
The present release is for Haitian Creole to English only; much of
the vocabulary was derived from a spell checking dictionary using
cognate induction methods, and is most likely incorrect -- CMU
have graciously provided Open Source bilingual data, but have
deliberately used a GPL-incompatible licence, which we cannot use.
We hope that they will see fit to change this.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks to Kevin Scannell for providing us with spell checking
data; to Francis Tyers and Kevin Unhammer for their contributions;
and to the Apertium community for their support and indirect help.
</p>

<p>
I would like to dedicate this releas to the memory of my grandmother,
Anne O'Regan, who passed away on Monday the 18th, just after I began
working on this.

<h3>Creating appealing schemas and charts</h3>

<p>
Dear TAG,
</p>

<p>
unfortunately I have to create a whole bunch of schematas, charts, diagrams, 
flow charts, state machines (fsm) and so on for my diploma thesis - and I was 
wondering if you happen to know some good tools to create such graphics.
</p>

<p>
Of course I know about dia, xfig, (open office draw), gimp, inkscape - but 
either the diagrams look really really old-fashioned (dia, xfig) or are rather 
cumbersome to create (gimp, inkscape, draw) - especially if you have to modify 
them afterwards.
</p>

<p>
So I'm looking for a handful of neat tools to create some appealing schematas.
Unfortunately I can't provide a good example - but thinks, like colors, 
borders,round edges are definitely a good start <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I have to admit that it is arguable whether some eye-candy is really necessary 
in a scientific paper - however adding a bit of it, really helps the reader to 
get the gist of the topic faster.
</p>


<p>
Thanks,
Peter
</p>

<p>
Hey,
</p>

<p>
I know it sounds kind of weird but I want to know if it is possible to 
identify what process/program is creating this particular directory on 
my system.
</p>

<p>
Basically, in my home folder a directory called "Downloads" keeps 
getting created at random times. The directory doesn't have any content 
inside it and is just an empty folder.
</p>

<p>
I thought that it was probably being created by one of the applications 
I run at the time but when I tried to narrow down the application by 
using each one separately and waiting for the directory to be created I 
wasn't able to replicate the issue.
</p>

<p>
I also tried searching on Google for this but seems like no one else is 
having this issue or maybe my searches are too generic.
</p>

<p>
I am running Debian Testing (Squeeze)  and the applications I normally 
have running are:
</p>

<pre>
* Firefox (3.6)
* Thunderbird (3.0.1)
* Dolphin (Default KDE 4.3.4 version)
* Konsole (3-4 instances)
* EditPlus using wine
* Amarok (1.4.10)
* ksensors
* Tomboy Notes
* xchat
* gnome-system-monitor
</pre>

<p>
BTW, I noticed the same behavior when I was using Ubuntu last year (9.10).
</p>

<p>
Any idea's on how to figure this out? Have any of you noticed something 
similar on your system?
</p>

Subject: Thanks for your DNS articles in LG
</pre>
Hi Rick,
</p>

<p>
I just stumbled upon your DNS articles in Linux Gazette and although I first 
though this topic is not that interesting for me it turned out to be really 
really interesting!
</p>

<p>
I found out that the dns I used to use (dns from my university) was horribly 
slow and seemed not to use any caching mechanism - first request 200-300ms, 
second request 200-300ms :/
</p>

<p>
Then I checked out other dns servers like googles and opendns which were quite 
fast (1st -&gt;130  2nd -&gt;30ms). 
</p>

<p>
But as I don't like using google for everything (no googlemail account here <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> 
and I really dislike the "wrong" answer of opendns for nonexistent domains  
(as it breaks google search by typing into firefox url bar)
</p>

<p>
-&gt; I eventually installed Unbound and I'm really really happy with it.
</p>

<p>
Installation was really easy and the results are tremendous (especially given 
the fact that I surf most of the time on only a handful pages) - so speedup 
from 300ms to 0(for the second hit) - that's really nice. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<p>
The only minor drawback I see is that (as I have to run it locally on my box - 
yes I'm one of your oddballs <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> it looses its cache after reboot. - do you 
happen to know if there is something I could do against that?
</p>


<p>
Anyways - thank you for your great articles and improving my internet 
experience even further.
</p>

<p>
Kind regards,
Peter
</p>

<p>
Most CLI aficionados use this kind of construct when executing a
command over "find" results:
</p>

<pre>
$ find ~ -type f -exec du -k {} \;
</pre>

<p>
Nothing is wrong with that, except that "du" is repeatedly called with
single argument (that is the absolute path and the file name itself).
Fortunately, there is a way to cut down the number of execution:
</p>

<pre>
$ find ~ -type f -exec du -k {} +
</pre>

<p>
Replacing ";" with "+" would make "find" to work like xargs does. Thus
du -k will be examining the size of several files at once per
iteration.
</p>

<p>
PS: Thanks to tuxradar.com for the knowledge!

<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux.com Launches New Jobs Board</h3>

<p>The Linux Foundation has created a new Linux Jobs Board at Linux.com:
<a href="http://jobs.linux.com/">http://jobs.linux.com/</a>. The new Linux.com Jobs Board can provide
employers and job seekers with an online forum to  find the best and
brightest Linux talent or the ideal job opportunity.</p>

<p>The JobThread Network, an online recruitment platform, reports that
the demand for Linux-related jobs has grown 80 percent since 2005,
showing that Linux represents the fastest growing job category in the
IT industry.</p>

<p>"Linux's increasing use across industries is building high demand for
Linux jobs despite national unemployment stats," said Jim Zemlin,
executive director at the Linux Foundation. "Linux.com reaches
millions of Linux professionals from all over the world. By providing
a Jobs Board feature on the popular community site, we can bring
together employers, recruiters, and job seekers to lay the intellectual
foundation for tomorrow's IT industry."</p>

<p>Employers interested in posting a job opening have two options; they
can post their openings on Linux.com and reach millions of
Linux-focused professionals, or they can use the JobThread Network on
Linux.com to reach an extended audience that includes 50 niche
publishing sites with a combined 9.8 million visitors every month. For
more information and to submit a job posting, please visit:
<a href="http://jobs.linux.com/post/">http://jobs.linux.com/post/</a>.</p>

<p>Job seekers can include their LinkedIn details on their Linux.com
profiles, including their resumes. They can also subscribe to the
Linux.com Jobs Board RSS feed, receive alerts by e-mail, and follow
opportunities about Linux-related jobs on Twitter at

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google moves to ext4</h3>

<p>Search and software giant Google is now in the process of upgrading
its storage infrastructure from the ext2 filesystem to ext4.</p>

<p>In a recent e-mail post, Google engineer Michael Rubin explained that
"...the metadata arrangement on a stale file system was leading to
what we call 'read inflation'. This is where we end up doing many
seeks to read one block of data."</p>

<p>Rubin also noted that "...For our workloads, we saw ext4 and xfs as
'close enough' in performance in the areas we cared about. The fact
that we had a much smoother
upgrade path with ext4 clinched the deal. The only upgrade option we
have is online. ext4 is already moving the bottleneck away from the
storage stack...."</p>

<p>In a related move, Ted Ts'o has joined Google, after concluding his
term as CTO of the Linux Foundation. Ts'o participated in creating the
ext4 filesystem.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Firefox Grows 40% in 2009, 3.5 now most Popular</h3>

<p>Usage data gathered by Statcounter.com at the end of December showed
Mozilla's Firefox 3.5 finally surpassed both IE 7 and IE 8 to become
the world's most popular Web-browsing software.  Holiday sales brought
IE 8 within a hair of overtaking Firefox, but the latter still was ahead in
mid-January.  See the graph for all browsers, here:
<a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-weekly-200827-201002/">http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-weekly-200827-201002/</a>.</p>

<p>However, combined usage of both IE 7 and IE 8 was almost 42% vs. 30.5%
for both the 3.0 and 3.5 versions of Firefox.</p>

<p>According to the Metrics group at Mozilla, the worldwide growth rate
for Firefox adoption was 40% for 2009.  The number of active daily
users was up an additional 22.8 million for 2009, higher than the 16.4
million users added in 2008.</p>

<p>This increase occurred despite delaying the release of Firefox 3.6
until late January. This next version of the open source browser from
the Mozilla Foundation will feature improvements in stability,
security, and customization, and will also offer features for
location-aware browsing.</p>

<p>A release candidate for 3.6 was available in mid-January. The next
milestone release, version 4.0, has been pushed back until the end of
2010.  It will feature separate processes for each tab, like Google
Chrome, and a major UI update.</p>

<p>According to StatCounter, this was Firefox's market share as of Dec '09:<br />
29% Africa<br />
26% Asia<br />
41% Europe<br />
31% North America<br />
32% South America</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">European Commission Approves Oracle's Acquisition of Sun</h3>

<p>On January 21, Oracle Corporation received regulatory approval from 
the European Commission for its acquisition of Sun Microsystems.  
Oracle expects approval from China and Russia to follow, and expects 
its Sun transaction to close quickly.</p>
 
<p>The European Commission had been under pressure from some of the 
founders of MySQL to separate it from the Sun acquisition on 
competitive grounds.  However, Marten Mickos, the former CEO of MySQL, and 
others had argued that the famed open source database was already on a 
dual commercial and open source development model, and that the large 
community around it could resist any efforts by Oracle to stunt its 
development.</p>
 
<p>The Commission found that concerns about MySQL were not as serious as 
was first voiced. "The investigation showed that although MySQL and 
Oracle compete in certain parts of the database market, they are not 
close competitors in others, such as the high-end segment", the 
Commission said in its announcement. It also concluded that PostgreSQL 
could become an open-source alternative to MySQL, if that should prove 
necessary, and was already competing with Oracle's database.  The 
Commission also said that it was now "...satisfied that competition 
and innovation will be preserved on all the markets concerned."</p>

<p>Oracle hosted a live event for customers, partners, press, and analysts 
on January 27, 2010, at its headquarters in Redwood Shores, 
California.</p>

<p>Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, along with executives from Oracle and Sun, 
outlined the strategy for the combined companies, product roadmaps, 
and the benefits from having all components - hardware, operating 
system, database, middleware, and applications - engineered to work 
together.  The event was broadcast globally, and an archive should be 
available at <a href="http://www.oracle.com/sun/">http://www.oracle.com/sun/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Microsystems Unveils Open Source Cloud Security Tools</h3>
<p>As part of its strategy to help customers build public and private
clouds that are open and interoperable, Sun Microsystems, Inc. is
offering open source cloud security capabilities and support for the
latest Security Guidance from the Cloud Security Alliance. For more
information on Sun's Cloud Security initiatives, visit
<a href="http://www.sun.com/cloud/security/">http://www.sun.com/cloud/security/</a>.</p>

<p>Leveraging the security capabilities of Sun's Solaris Operating
Systems, including Solaris ZFS and Solaris Containers, the security
tools help to secure data in transit, at rest, in use in the cloud,
and work with cloud offerings from leading vendors including Amazon
and Eucalyptus.</p>

<p>Along with introducing new security tools in December, Sun also
announced support for the Cloud Security Alliance's "Guidance for
Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing - Version 2.1." Sun privacy
and security experts have been instrumental in the industry-wide
effort to develop the security guidance, and have been active
participants in the Cloud Security Alliance since its inception. The
new framework provides more concise and actionable guidance for secure
adoption of cloud computing, and encompasses knowledge gained from
real world deployments. For more information, visit
<a href="http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/guidance/">http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/guidance/</a>.</p>

<p>Sun also published a new white paper, "Building Customer Trust in
Cloud Computing with Transparent Security," that provides an overview
of the ways in which intelligent disclosure of security design,
practices, and procedures can help improve customer confidence while
protecting critical security features and data, improving overall
governance. To download the paper, visit
<a href="http://www.sun.com/offers/details/sun_transparency.xml">http://www.sun.com/offers/details/sun_transparency.xml</a>.</p>

<p>Sun announced availability for several open source Cloud Security
tools including:</p>

<ul>
<li>
OpenSolaris VPC Gateway: The OpenSolaris VPC Gateway software
enables customers to quickly create a redundant, secure communications
channel to an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud without the need for
proprietary networking equipment. To download the OpenSolaris VPC
Gateway tool, visit <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/osolvpc/pages/Home/">http://kenai.com/projects/osolvpc/pages/Home/</a>;
<li>
Immutable Service Containers (ISC):  Incorporating many of the
security features of the OpenSolaris operating system, including
Solaris ZFS, Solaris Containers, and Solaris IP Filter and Auditing,
the ISC architecture leverages service compartmentalization and
improved integration techniques to create virtual machines with
significantly improved security protection and monitoring
capabilities. To download the ISC software or pre-built images, visit
<a href="http://kenai.com/projects/isc/pages/OpenSolaris/">http://kenai.com/projects/isc/pages/OpenSolaris/</a>;
<li>
Security Enhanced Virtual Machine Images (VMIs): Using many of the 
techniques developed for the Immutable Service Container project, Sun 
created several security-enhanced VMIs for the Amazon Elastic Compute 
Cloud (EC2). These virtual machines leverage industry accepted 
recommended practices including non-executable stacks, encrypted swap 
and auditing enabled by default. Beyond simple OpenSolaris images, Sun
has also published integrated software stacks such as Solaris AMP and 
Drupal built on these security-enhanced images. To download the VMIs, 
visit <a href="http://www.sun.com/cloud/security/">http://www.sun.com/cloud/security/</a>;
<li>
Cloud Safety Box: Simplifies managing encrypted content in the 
Cloud. Using a simple Amazon S3-like interface, the Cloud Safety Box 
automates the compression, encryption, and splitting of content being 
stored in the cloud on any supported operating system, including 
Solaris, OpenSolaris, Linux, and Mac OS X.
</ul>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Canonical Announces Bazaar Commercial Services</h3>
<p>Companies and open source projects interested in using Canonical's 
popular version control system now have access to a suite of 
commercial services - Consultancy &amp; Conversion, Training, and Support - 
allowing them to migrate, deploy, and manage Bazaar.</p>
 
<p>Used by Ubuntu and other open source and commercial projects, Bazaar 
(bzr) is a version control system (VCS) that supports distributed 
development environments. Many existing version control systems use a 
centralised model, a particular challenge to globally distributed 
'chase the sun' development teams. Although bzr itself is open source, 
there is no requirement for commercial projects to make their code 
publicly available.</p>
 
<p>Sun Microsystems migrated the code for its MySQL database software a 
year ago, using bzr conversion and support services. "We wanted to use 
a tool which suited our distributed contributor model for MySQL, but 
we needed the reassurance of access to the Bazaar development team 
through our transition and use of the VCS," said Jeffrey Pugh, vice 
president of MySQL Engineering, Sun Microsystems. "We have found bzr 
works really well for our model, and that the bzr support team and 
developers have been responsive to our requirements."</p>
 
<p>"The increasingly distributed nature of software development has 
allowed Bazaar to grow in popularity," said Martin Pool, project 
manager at Canonical. "Our Consultancy &amp; Conversion, Training, and 
Support services give new and existing customers piece of mind when 
setting up such a vital piece of infrastructure."</p>

<p>Canonical is now offering comprehensive training in Bazaar to get 
staff up-to-speed quickly and transfer best practice knowledge. Both 
the content and delivery are tailored to meet the needs of individual 
teams and development environments, so developers can get the most out 
of the training sessions.</p>

<p>Visit the project site here: <a
href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/">http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/</a>, or Canonical's Bazaar page here: <a href="http://www.canonical.com/projects/bazaar/">http://www.canonical.com/projects/bazaar/</a>.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Canonical offers support program for Lotus Symphony</h3>

<p>At IBM Lotusphere in January, Canonical announced a dedicated support
program for Lotus Symphony, the no-charge office productivity
component of the IBM Client for Smart Work (ICSW) on Ubuntu. This
support is made available to customers by Canonical through the IBM
and Canonical partner network.</p>

<p>The IBM Client for Smart Work helps organisations save up to 50
percent per seat on software costs versus a Microsoft-based desktop,
in addition to avoiding requisite hardware upgrades. The package
allows companies to use their existing PCs, lower-cost netbooks, and
thin clients.</p>

<p>The open standards-based core solution comprises of Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
Desktop Edition and Lotus Symphony, which includes word processing,
spreadsheets, and presentations, fully supported by Canonical at US $5.50
per user, per month based on 1000 seat deployment.
Optional solution components include desktop virtualisation and
recovery options using VERDE from Virtual Bridges, and a variety of
Lotus collaboration capabilities with choice of delivery model: on
site, on the cloud, or using an appliance.</p>

<p>"The economic case for Ubuntu and the IBM Client for Smart Work is
unarguable," says Shiv Kumar, EVP of Sales at ZSL, one of the first
IBM and Canonical partners to make this solution available. "The
addition of support from Canonical at super-competitive pricing means
companies have the reassurance of world class support through the
entire stack."</p>

<p>IBM Client for Smart Work for Ubuntu core solution is available
(unsupported) at no charge from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/partners/icsw">http://www.ubuntu.com/partners/icsw</a>.</p>

<h3>Author's Note</h3>

<em>
<p>
I am trying to compile a body of work on an overall theme that I call
Taming Technology. (I have wrestled with several different names, but
that is my title du jour.) The theme deals with troubleshooting,
problem solving, problem avoidance, and analysis of technology failures.
</p>

<p>
Case studies are an important part of this ambitious project.
"Installing Fedora Core 10" is an example. It deals with my attempts
to perform a network kickstart install of Fedora Core 10.
</p>

<p>
Part 1, Lessons from Mistakes, outlines my plans, briefly compares CD
installation with network installation, and proceeds to early success and
unexpected debacle.
</p>

<p>
In Part 2, Bootable Linux, I discuss some of the uses of the Knoppix Live
Linux CD, before explaining how I used Knoppix to gather information
needed for a network installation. I also use Knoppix to diagnose the
problems encountered in Part 1. This leads to the discovery that I
have created even more problems. Finally, I present an excellent
solution to the major problem of Part 1.
</p>

<p>
In Part 3 and 4, I finally get back on-track, and present detailed
instructions for installing Fedora Core 10 over a network, using PXE
boot, kickstart, and NFS. Part 3 details PXE boot including
troubleshooting; Part 4 takes us the rest of the way.
</p>

<p>
I think it's important for people to realise that they are not alone
when they make mistakes, that even so-called experts are fallible.
</p>

<p>
Isaac Asimov wrote a series of robot stories. (I don't imagine for one
moment that I'm Isaac Asimov.) To me, the most captivating facet of
these stories was the unanticipated consequences of interactions
between the Three Laws of Robotics. I like to think that I write about the
unanticipated consequences of our fallible minds: we want X, we think
we ask for X, but find we've got Y. Why?
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Highly amusing coincidence: a possible answer to Henry's question is
contained in the "<a href="http://perlmonks.org/?node_id=542341">XY
Problem</a>" - except for the terms X and Y being reversed. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
In my real life, I embark on a project, something goes wrong, there is
often the discovery that the problems multiply. After several detours,
I finally get a happy ending.<br>

<hr>

<p>
The Cowboy materialised at the side of my desk. I wondered uneasily
how long he had been standing there.
</p>

<p>
"When you've got some time," he began, "can I get you to look at a
problem?"
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about it," I replied.
</p>

<p>
He looked around, and pulled up a chair. This was going to be
interesting. His opening gambit is usually, "Quick question," almost
invariably followed by a very long and complicated discussion that
gives the lie both to the idea that the question will be short and the
implication that it won't take long to answer.
</p>

<p>
To me, a quick question is something like, "Is today Monday?" The
Cowboy's "quick" questions are about the equivalent of, "What's the
meaning of life?" or "Explain the causes of terrorism."
</p>

<p>
If he had decided to sit down, how momentous was this problem?
</p>

<p>
By way of preamble, he conceded that The Russian had been trying to
install Oracle on the machine in question. He wasn't sure if there was
a connection, but now The Russian couldn't run VNC. It turned out that,
when he tried to run a vncserver, he got a message like:
</p>

<pre>
	no free display number on suseq
</pre>

<p>
Sure enough, when I tried to run a vncserver on suseq I got the
same message. I used ps to tell me how many vnc sessions were actually
running on this machine (ps auxw | grep vnc); a small number (3 or 4).
</p>

<p>
When I tried picking a relatively high display number, I was told it
was in use:
</p>

<pre>
	vncserver :13
	A VNC server is already running as :13
</pre>

<p>
Similarly for a really really high number:
</p>

<pre>
	vncserver :90013
	A VNC server is already running as :90013
</pre>

<p>
This perhaps was enough information to diagnose the problem (it is, in
hindsight), but seemed too startling to be believable.
</p>

<p>
To get a better understanding of why vncserver was behaving so
strangely, I decided to trace it<a id="grebler.html_1_back"></a><a
href="#grebler.html_1">[1]</a>. I used a bash function called 'truss'<a
id="grebler.html_2_back"></a><a href="#grebler.html_2">[2]</a>, so the
session looked a bit like this:
</p>

<pre>
	truss vncserver

	New 'X' desktop is suseq:6

	Starting applications specified in /home/henryg/.vnc/xstartup
	Log file is /home/henryg/.vnc/suseq:6.log
</pre>

<p>
This was even more unbelievable - if I traced vncserver, it seemed to
work! (It doesn't really matter whether it actually worked, or just
seemed to work; tracing the application changed its behaviour.) This
may be a workaround, but it explained nothing and raised even more
question than were on the table going in.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I suggested to The Cowboy that it did not look like the
problem would be solved any time soon, and he might as well leave it
with me. I also thought a few minutes away from my desk wouldn't hurt.
</p>

<p>
After making myself a coffee, I went over to Jeremy and told him about
the strange behaviour with trace. I wasn't really looking for help;
just wanting to share what a weird day I was having.
</p>

<p>
I went back to my desk to do something that would succeed. There are
times during the task of problem-solving when you find yourself
picking losers. Whatever you try backfires. Several losses in a row
tend to send your radar out of kilter. At such times, it's a good idea
to get back onto solid ground, to do anything that is guaranteed to
succeed. Then, with batteries recharged after a couple of wins, your
frame of mind for tackling the problem is immensely improved.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later, Jeremy came to see me. He had an idea. At first, I
could not make any sense of it. When I understood, I thought it was
brilliant - and certainly worth a try.
</p>

<p>
He suggested that I trace the bash command-line process from which I
was invoking vncserver.
</p>

<p>
So, in the xterm window where I had tried to run vncserver, I did
</p>

<pre>
	echo $$
	5629
</pre>

<p>
The number is the process id (pid) of the bash process.
</p>

<p>
In another xterm window, I started a trace:
</p>

<pre>
	truss -p 5629
</pre>

<p>
Now, back in the first window, I invoked vncserver again:
</p>

<pre>
	vncserver
	no free display number on suseq
</pre>

<p>
So, Jeremy's idea had worked! (Trussing bash rather than vncserver had
allowed me to capture a trace of vncserver failing.)
</p>

<p>
I killed the truss and examined the output. What it showed was that
the vncserver process had tried many sockets and failed with "Address
already in use", e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
	bind(3, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(6099),
	sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = -1 EADDRINUSE (Address
	already in use)
</pre>

<p>
The example shows an attempt to bind to port 6099. This was near the bottom
of the truss output. Looking backwards, I saw that it had tried ports 6098,
6097, ... prior to port 6099. Clearly vncserver had cycled through a fairly
large number of ports, and had failed on all of them.
</p>

<p>
Why were all these ports busy? I tried to see which ports were in use:
</p>

<pre>
	netstat -na
</pre>

<p>
Big mistake! (I should have known.) I was flooded with output. How
much output? Good question:
</p>

<pre>
	netstat -na | wc
</pre>

<p>
After a very long time (10 or 15 seconds - enough time to issue the
same command on another machine), it came back with not much less than
50000! That's astronomical! On the other machine with the problem,
there were more than 40000 responses - still huge. A typical machine
runs about 500 sockets.
</p>

<p>
After that, the rest was easy. The suspicion was that Oracle was
hogging all the ports. That's probably not how it's meant to behave,
but I don't have a lot of experience with Oracle.
</p>

<p>
I suggested to The Russian that he try to shut down Oracle and see if
that brought the number of sockets in use down to a reasonable number;
If not, he should reboot.
</p>

<p>
In either case, he should then start a trivial monitor in an xterm:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	while true
	do
		netstat -na | wc
		sleep 1
	done
</pre>

<p>
and then do whatever he was doing to get Oracle going. As soon as the
answer from the monitor rose sharply, he would know that whatever he
had been doing at that time was probably responsible. If he was doing
something wrong, he might then have an indication where to look. If
not, he had something to report to the Oracle people.
</p>


<h3>Lessons</h3>

<p>
1. Not all exercises in problem-solving result in a solution with all
the loose ends tidied up. In this case, all that had been achieved is
that a path forward had been found. It might lead to a solution, it
might not. If not, they'll be back.
</p>

<p>
2. Never underestimate the power of involving someone else. In this
case, the someone else came back and provided me with a path forward.
</p>

<p>
Often, in other cases (and I've seen this dozens of times, both as the
presenter and as the listener), the person presenting the problem
discovers the solution during the process of explaining the problem to
the listener. I have been thanked profusely for helping to solve a
problem I did not understand. It is, however, crucial that the listener
give the impression of understanding the presenter. For some reason,
explaining the problem to the cat is just not as effective.
</p>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>
<a id="grebler.html_1"></a><a href="#grebler.html_1_back">[1]</a> "Tracing"
is an activity for investigating what a process (program) is doing. Think
of it as a stethoscope for computer doctors. The Linux command is strace(1)
- "trace system calls and signals." 
</p>

<p>
<a id="grebler.html_2"></a><a href="#grebler.html_2_back">[2]</a> After
years of working in mixed environments, I now tend to operate in my own
environment. In a classic metaphor for "ontogeny mimics phylogeny", my
abbreviations and functions contain markers for the various operating
systems I've worked with: "treecopy" from my Prime days in the early '80s,
"dsd" from VMS back in the mid '80s, "truss" from Solaris in 1998, etc.
</p>

<p>
In this case, I used my bash function, "truss", which has all the options I
usually want adjusted depending on the platform on which the command is
running. Under Solaris, my function "truss" will invoke the Sun command
"truss". Since this is a SUSE Linux machine, it will invoke the Linux
command "strace" (with different options). It's about concentrating on 
<em>what</em> I want do rather than <em>how</em> to do it.

<h1>Random signatures with Mutt</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/appaiah.html">Kumar Appaiah</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Ever since the start of the Internet, electronic mail has been a
mainstay for communication. Even as new social networking
phenomena such as online-friend connection databases and
microblogging are taking communication on the Web by storm, e-mail still
remains a preferred means of communication for both personal and
official purposes, and is unlikely to fade away soon.
</p>

<p>
One aspect of e-mail that we often observe is the sender's
signature - the tiny blurb that appears on the bottom. If it's an
official e-mail, then you're most likely constrained to keep it something
sober that talks about your position at work, or similar
details. However, if you are mailing friends, or a mailing list, then
wouldn't it be nice to have a signature that is customized and/or
chosen from a random set of signatures? Several Web-based e-mail services
offer this already; a cursory Web search reveals that services such as
GMail offer this feature. However, the customizability is limited, and
you are restricted in several ways. However, if you use a customizable mail
client like Mutt, several fun things can be done with e-mail
signatures, using more specific details that are within your control.
</p>

<p>
In this article, I describe one of the possible ways of having random
signatures in your e-mail in the <a
href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> mail client, and switching
signature themes and styles based on certain characteristics, such
your inbox or recipient. I will, therefore, assume that you have a
working configuration for Mutt ready, though the concept I describe
applies equally well to other mail clients which support this, such as
Pine. I'll make use of the <tt>BSD/Unix fortune</tt> program
(available in almost all GNU/Linux and *BSD distributions) in this
article, though any solution that chooses random quotes would do.
</p>

<h3>Preparation: collect your signatures for <tt>fortune</tt></h3>

<p>
The Unix <tt>fortune</tt> program is a simple program that uses a
database of strings (called "fortunes") to randomly choose a string
and display it onto the screen. The program is named appropriately,
since it uses a collection of files on various subjects to display
messages, much like those on fortune cookies.
</p>

<p>
It is usually easy to install the program on most GNU/Linux
distributions. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu-like systems, the
following command will fetch the fortune program and several databases
of strings:
</p>

<pre>
apt-get install fortune-mod fortunes
</pre>

<p>
Similarly, <tt>yum install fortune-mod</tt> should help on Red
Hat/Fedora-like systems. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to
install it on your GNU/Linux or BSD distribution.
</p>

<p>
Once installed, you can test out the existing files. For example, on
my Debian machine, the following command lists a random signature from
one of the <tt>/usr/share/games/fortunes/linux</tt> or
<tt>/usr/share/games/fortunes/linuxcookie</tt> files:
</p>

<pre>
fortune linux linuxcookie
</pre>

<p>
If you now open one of the files in
<tt>/usr/share/games/fortunes/</tt>, such as <tt>linux</tt>, you'll
observe that they consist of strings which are separated by the "%"
sign, resembling the format of this file:
</p>

<pre>
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
%
A stitch in time saves nine.
%
Haste makes waste
</pre>

<p>
Also, associated with each file, such as <tt>linux</tt>, is a
<tt>.dat</tt> file, e.g. <tt>linux.dat</tt>. The way <tt>fortune</tt>
works is that it looks for the file specified at the command line,
(absent such a command line option, choosing a random file among those
in the path searched by default), and looks for a corresponding .dat
file, which has a table of file offsets for locating strings in that
file. If it doesn't find the dat file corresponding to a text file
with signatures, it ignores that file.
</p>

<p>
While you can use the signatures present already, if you want to
create and use your own signatures, get them from wherever you want,
and place them in a file, separated by % signs as discussed above. For
example, I'll put the above file in a location called
$HOME/Signatures. Let me call my file $HOME/Signatures/adages. To use
it with <tt>fortune</tt>, I use the <tt>strfile</tt> program to
generate the table of offsets:
</p>

<pre>
[~/Signatures] strfile adages
"adages.dat" created
There were 3 strings
Longest string: 38 bytes
Shortest string: 18 bytes
</pre>

<p>
Now, running <tt>fortune</tt> with the full path of the file causes a random
string to be displayed from the above file. (Note that the full path
must be provided, if the file is outside the default fortunes
directory.)
</p>

<pre>
$ fortune $HOME/Signatures/adages
Haste makes waste
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>fortune</tt> program is versatile, and has several options.
Be sure to read its manual page for more details.
</p>

<h3>Tailoring <tt>fortune</tt> output for signatures</h3>

<p>
The <tt>fortune</tt> output is a random string, and often, these
strings are too long for use as good signatures in your
e-mail. To avoid such situations, we make use of the <tt>-s</tt>
option so <tt>fortune</tt> will display only short strings. The default
definition of a short string is up to 160 characters, but you can
override it with the <tt>-n</tt> option. For example:
</p>

<tt>fortune</tt> -n 200 -s &lt;files&gt;

<p>
could be a suitable candidate as a signature file.
</p>

<h3>Configuring Mutt</h3>

<p>
Now, you're ready to use your neat fortunes in Mutt. If you have no
custom signature, and want to uniformly use a random signature from
your newly created signature file, as well as the default
<tt>linuxcookie</tt> file, then add the following to your
<tt>.muttrc</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
set signature="fortune -n 200 -s linux $HOME/Signatures/adages|"
</pre>

<p>
If this is what you wanted, you're done. However, if you want to
customize the signatures based on other parameters such as recipient,
or current folder, read on.
</p>

<h3>Customizing your signature based on different criteria</h3>

<p>
Let me describe my setup here. I use the <tt>procmail</tt> program
to filter my mail, and let's say that I've got the following folders
of interest:
</p>

<!--"personal e-mail arrive" ? Is this a Brit-usage mass noun? Kat -->

<ol>
<li><tt>inbox</tt>: where all my personal e-mail arrives.</li>
<li><tt>linux</tt>-list: which consists of my local Linux user group mail.</li>
<li><tt>work</tt>-mail: where I read all my work mail.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, I want to have the following configuration:
</p>

<ul>
<li>When I reply to or compose mail in the work mail folder, I want a fixed signature.</li>
<li>When I send to linux-list, I want a signature from the linux fortunes database.</li>
<li>Finally, in all other situations, I want a signature from my adages list.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are simple steps to achieve this using the hooks in Mutt. Note that
I have interspersed it with some other configurations for
demonstration.
</p>

<pre>
# Set the default options
folder-hook . 'set record=+sent; set from=me@my-personal-email; set signature="fortune $HOME/Signatures/adages|"'

# Set the custom hooks
send-hook linux-list@example.com 'set signature="fortune -n 200 -s linux|"'
folder-hook work-mail 'set record=+sent-work; set from=me@my-work-email; set signature="$HOME/.signature-work"'
</pre>

<p>
What the above snippet does is to set, amongst other things, the
default signature to be my adages set, and automatically switch the
signature to a fixed file, <tt>$HOME/.signature-work</tt>, when I move
to the <tt>work-mail</tt> folder. Finally, if I send mail to the
<tt>linux-list@example.com</tt> mailing address, the signature is
altered to display a fortune from the <tt>linux</tt> fortunes
file. Simple enough, and the possibilities are infinite!
</p>

<h3>Getting good fortunes</h3>

<p>
You can scout the Internet to get nice quotations and
interesting messages to add to your signatures collection; all you need to do is
to put each in the right format, use <tt>strfile</tt> to enable fortune
to use it, and plug it into your Mutt configuration. I often like to
hunt for quotations on <a href="http://www.wikiquote.org">Wikiquote</a>,
amongst other Web sites. While I am sure most of us don't mean any harm
while using other people's sentences in our signatures, ensure that
you stay on the right side of the law while doing so.
</p>

<p>
I wish to make a mention of the <a
href="http://lost.sourceforge.net/">Linux One Stanza Tip</a> project,
which provides a very nice set of signatures with GNU/Linux tips, and
more, in their distribution. They also provide templates for you to
generate your own signatures with designs and customizations. Sadly,
the project doesn't seem to be that active now, but the tips and
software provided are very apt and usable even today.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
In conclusion, I hope I've managed to show you that with Mutt, you
can customize the way you handle signatures in a neat manner. Should
you have comments or suggestions to suggestions to enhance or improve
this workflow, or just want to say that you liked this article, I'd
love to hear from you!

<h1>The Next Generation of Linux Games - Word War VI</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/crosby.html">Dafydd Crosby</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>Many people have made the switch to Linux, and the question that has
continued since the kernel hit 0.01 is "where are the games?"</p>

<p>While the <a href="http://www.winehq.org">WINE project</a> has done a
great job at getting quite a few mainstream games working, there are also
many Linux-native gems that are fantastic at whittling away the time. No
longer content with Solitaire clones, the community is responding with a
wide array of fun games.</p>

<p>In this month's review, we are looking at Word War VI. With graphics
that initially look straight out of the Atari days, one might be tempted to
overlook the game for something a little showier. However, within minutes I
was hooked with the Defender-like gameplay, and the fireworks and
explosions rippling across the screen had satisfied my eye-candy
requirements.</p>

<img src="misc/crosby/wordwarvi-2.png" />

<p>The graphics look like the old 80's arcade shooters, but the polish and
smoothness of the visuals make it quite clear that this is an intentional
part of the game's aesthetic. Also, a quick look at the game's
<strong>man</strong> page reveal that there is a wealth of options:
adjusting how the game looks, the difficulty settings, the choice of bigger
explosions (which look <i>awesome</i>), and even a mode where you play as
Santa Claus (<strong>wordwarvi --xmas</strong>).</p>

<p>The controls are simple, mostly relying on the spacebar and arrow keys.
The goal is to grab as many humans while avoiding various missiles, alien
ships, and other enemies. The real beauty is the 'easy to learn, hard to
master' approach, which suits the space-shooter genre just fine.</p>

<img src="misc/crosby/wordwarvi-1.png" />

<p>Stephen Cameron's little side-project about "The Battle of the Text
Editors" has blossomed into a respectable game. He has done a great job
documenting on how to hack the game and extend it even further, leaving
endless possibilities of more fun and crazy modes. The source is located at
<a href="http://wordwarvi.sourceforge.net/">the Word War VI website</a>,
though the game is likely already packaged by your distribution.</p>

<h1>The Gentle Art of Firefox Tuning (and Taming)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Linux users tend, I've noticed, to complain about suckiness on the Web
itself, and in their own Web browsers &mdash; browser bloat, sites going
all-Flash, brain damage inherent in AJAX-oriented "Web 2.0" sites<a
id="firefox.html_1_back"></a><a href="#firefox.html_1">[1]</a>, and
death-by-JavaScript nightmares. However, the fact is: We've come a long
way.
</p>

<p>
In the bad old days, the best we had was the crufty and proprietary
Netscape Communicator 4.x kitchen sink^W^W"communications suite"
into which Netscape Navigator 3.x, a decent browser for its day, had
somehow vanished.  That was dispiriting, because an increasing number of
complex Web pages (many of them Front Page-generated) segfaulted the 
browser immediately, and Netscape Communications, Inc. wasn't fixing it.
</p>

<p> 
Following that was a chaotic period:  Mozilla emerged in 1998, with Galeon
as a popular variant, and Konqueror as an independent alternative from the
KDE/Qt camp.  Mozilla developers made two key decisions, the first being 
the move in October 1998 to write an entirely new rendering engine,
which turned out to be a huge success. The rendering engine is now named
Gecko (formerly Raptor, then NGLayout), and produced the first
stunningly good, modern, world-class browsers, the Mozilla 0.9.x series,
starting May 7, 2001. I personally found this to be the first time it
was truly feasible to run 100% open source software without feeling like
a bit of a hermit.  So, I consider May 7, 2001 to be open source's
Independence Day.  
</p>


<p> 
The second turning point was in 2003, with the equally difficult decision
that Mozilla's feature creep needed fixing by ditching the "Mozilla
Application Suite" kitchen-sink approach and making the browser separate
again:  The Mozilla Project thus produced Firefox (initially called
"Phoenix") as a standalone browser based on a new cross-platform front-end
/ runtime engine called XULRunner (replacing the short-lived Gecko Runtime
Environment).  At the same time, Galeon faltered and underwent a further
schism that produced the GNOME-centric, sparsely featured Epiphany browser,
and the XULRunner runtime's abilities inspired Conkeror (a light
browser written mostly in JavaScript), SeaMonkey (a revival of the
Communicator kitchen-sink suite), and Mobile Firefox (formerly Fennec,
formerly Minimo).
</p>

<p>
Anyway, defying naysayers' expectations, Firefox's winning feature
has turned out to be its extensions interface, usable by add-on code
written in XULRunner's XUL scripting language.  At some cost in browser 
code bloat<a id="firefox.html_2_back"></a><a href="#firefox.html_2">[2]</a> 
when you use it extensively, that interface has permitted development
of some essential add-ons, with resulting functionality unmatched by any
other Web browser on any OS.  In this article, I detail several
extensions to tighten up Firefox's somewhat leaky protection of your
personal privacy, and protect you from Web annoyances.  (For reasons
I've <a href="../118/weatherwax.html#1">detailed
elsewhere</a>, you should if possible get software from distro packages
rather than "upstream" non-distro software authors, except in very
exceptional circumstances.  So, even though I give direct download links
for three Firefox extensions, below, please <em>don't use those</em>
unless you first strike out with your Linux distribution's own
packages.<a id="firefox.html_3_back"></a><a
href="#firefox.html_3">[1]</a>)  I also outline a number of modifications
every Firefox user should consider making to the default configuration,
again with similar advantages in user privacy and tightening of security
defaults.  For each such change, I will cite the rationale, so you can
adjust your paranoia to suit.  
</p>

<h3>The "Rich Computing Experience"<a id="firefox.html_4_back"></a><a href="#firefox.html_4">[4]</a> and Its Discontents</h3>

<p>
Here begins the (arguable) mild-paranoia portion of our proceedings:
Have you ever noticed how eager Web-oriented companies are to help you?
You suddenly discover that your software goes out and talks across the
Internet to support some "service" you weren't aware you wanted,
involving some commercial enterprise with whom you have no business
relations.  There's hazy information about this-or-that information
being piped out to that firm; you're a bit unclear on the extent of it
&mdash; but you're told it's all perfectly fine, because there's a
<em>privacy policy</em>.  
</p>

<p>
There's a saying in the Cluetrain Manifesto, written in part by longtime
Linux pundit Doc Searls, that "Markets are conversations."  That is, 
it's a negotiated exchange:  You give something; you get something.  
Sometimes you give information, and, oddly enough, Linux people seem to
often miss the key point: <em>information has value, even yours.</em>  In a 
market conversation, you're supposed to be able to judge for yourself
whether you want what's being offered, and if you want to donate 
the cost thereof (such as some of your data).  If you have no use
for what's being offered, you can and should turn off the "service" --
and that's what this article will cover (or at least let you decide what 
"services" to participate in, instead of letting others decide for you).
</p>


<h3>The Essential Extensions</h3>

<p>
<em>NoScript</em>:  The name is slightly misleading:  This marvelous
extension makes JavaScript, Java, Flash, and a variety of other possibly
noxious and security-risking "rich content" be selectively disabled 
(and initially disabled 100% by default), with you being able to enable
on a site-by-site basis, via context menu, which types of scripting you
really want to execute.  More and more, those scripts are some variety
of what are euphemistically called "Web metrics", i.e., data mining
attempts to spy on you and track your actions and movements as you
navigate the Web.  NoScript makes all of that just not work, letting you
run only the JavaScript, Flash, etc. that you really want.  As a
side-benefit, this extension (like many of the others cited) in effect
makes the Web significantly faster by reducing the amount of junk code
your browser is obliged to process.  Available from: <a
href="http://noscript.net/">http://noscript.net/</a> 
</p>

<p>
<em>Adblock Plus ("ABP")</em>:  This extension does further filtering, making
a variety of noxious banner ads and other advertising elements 
just not be fetched at all.  Highly recommended, though some people 
prefer the preceding "Adblock" extension, instead.  Privacy 
implication?  Naturally, additional data mining gets disposed of, into
the bargain.  Available from:
<a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/">http://adblockplus.org/en/</a>
</p>

<p>
ABP's effectiveness can be substantially enhanced through adding <a
href="https://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions">subscriptions</a> to
maintained ABP blocklists.  I've found that a combination of <a
href="http://easylist.adblockplus.org/">EasyList and EasyPrivacy</a> is
effective and reliable, and recommend them. (EasyList is currently 
an ABP default.)  Since these are just URL-pattern-matching blocklists,
subscriptions are not as security-sensitive as are Firefox extensions
themselves, but you should still be selective about which ones to adopt.
</p>

<p>
<em>CustomizeGoogle</em>:  This extension largely defangs Google search
engine lookup of its major advertising and data-mining features, makes
your Google preferences persistent for a change, adds links to
optionally check alternative search engines' results on the same
queries, anonymises the Google userid string sent when you perform a
Google Web search (greatly reducing the ability of Google's data 
mining to link up what subjects you search for with who you are), etc.  
Be aware that you'll want to go through CustomizeGoogle's preferences 
carefully, as most of its improvements are <em>disabled by default</em>.  
Available from:
<a href="http://www.customizegoogle.com/">http://www.customizegoogle.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
For the record, I like the Google, Inc. company very much, even 
after its 2007 purchase of notorious spying-on-customers firm
DoubleClick, Inc., which served as a gentle reminder that the parent
firm's core business, really, intrinsically revolves around data
mining/collection and targeted advertising.  What I (like, I assume, 
<em>LG</em> readers) really want is to use its services only at my
option, not anyone else's, and to negotiate what I'm giving them, the
Mozilla Corporation, and other business partners, rather than having it 
taken behind my back.  For example, Ubuntu's first alpha release of
10.04 "Karmic Koala" included what Jon Corbet at LWN.net called "<a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/345945/">Ubuntu's multisearch surprise</a>":
a custom Firefox search bar that gratuitously sent users to a Google
"search partner" page to better (and silently, without disclosure)
collect money-making data about what you and I are up to. (This feature
was removed following complaints, but the point is that we the users
were neither informed nor asked about whether we wanted to be monitored
a bit more closely to make this "service" possible.)
</p>

<p> 
<em>User Agent Switcher</em>:  This extension doesn't technically
concern security and privacy, exactly, but is both useful in itself and
as a way to make a statement to Web-publishing companies about
standards.  It turns out that many sites query your browser about its
"User Agent" string, and then decide on the basis of the browser's
answer whether to send it a Web page or not &mdash; and what Web page to
send.  User Agent Switcher lets you pick dynamically which of several
popular Web browsers you want Firefox to claim to be, or you can write
your own.  I usually have mine send "W3C standards are important.
Stop f---ing obsessing over user-agent already", for reasons my friend Karsten
M. Self has 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Web/user-agent-string.html">cited</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
In the finest Alice's Restaurant tradition, if one person does this,
they may think he's sick, and they'll deny him the Web page. If two
people do it, in harmony, well, they're free speech fairies, and they
won't serve them either. If three people do it, three, can you imagine,
three people setting their user-agent strings to "Stop f---ing obsessing
over user-agent...". They may think it's an organization. And can you
imagine fifty people a day? Friends, they may think it's a movement. And
that's what it is...  If this string shows up in enough Web server logs,
the message <em>will</em> be felt. 
</blockquote>

</p>

<p>I list a number of other extensions that might be worth considering
on my personal <a
href="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/index.php?page=kicking#linuxbrowser">pages</a>.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ I can also recommend the <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/">Web Developer</a> toolbar extension.
Even if you're not a Web developer, the tool can help you to deactivate 
obnoxious style sheets and layouts. In addition, you can instantly clear 
all cookies and HTTP authentications for the site you are viewing 
(by using the menu item <em>Miscellaneous/Clear Private Data/...</em>). 
-- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<h3>Configuration of the Browser Itself</h3>

<p>
<em>Edit: Preferences: Content:</em> Select Advanced for "Enable JavaScript"
and deselect all.  Reason:  There's no legitimate need for JavaScript to
fool with those aspects of your browser.  Then uncheck Java, unless you
actually ever use Java applets in your Web browser.  (You can always
re-enable if you ever need it.)
</p>

<p>
<em>Edit: Preferences: Privacy:</em> Uncheck "Accept third-party
cookies." Reason:  I've only seen one site where such were essential
to the site's functionality, and even then it was clearly also being
used for data mining.  Enable "Always clear my private data when I close
Firefox". Click "Settings" and check all items.  Reason:  When you 
ask to delete private data, it should actually happen.  Disable
"Remember what I enter in forms and the search bar".  Reason:  Your
prior forms data is often security-sensitive.  Consider disabling
"Keep my history for n days" and "Remember what I've downloaded".
Reason:  You don't get much benefit from keeping this private data 
around persistently, so why log it?
</p>

<p>
<em>Edit: Preferences: Security:</em> Visit "Exceptions" to "Warn me
when sites try to install add-ons" and remove all.  Reason:  You should
know.  Disable "Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a suspected attack
site" and "Tell me if the site I'm visiting is a suspected forgery".
Reason:  Eliminate periodic visits to an anti-phishing, anti-malware
nanny site.  Really, can't you tell EBay and your bank from fakes, and 
can't you deal with malware by just not running it?  "Remember passwords
for sites":  If you leave this enabled, remember that Firefox will leave
them in a central data store that is only moderately obscured, and then
only if you set a "master password".  Don't forget, too, that even the 
list of sites to "Never Save" passwords for, which isn't obscured at
all, can be very revealing.  The cautious will disable this feature
entirely &mdash; or, at minimum, avoid saving passwords for any site that
is security-sensitive.
</p>

<p>
<em>Edit: Preferences: Advanced</em> On General tab, enable 
"Warn me when Web sites try to redirect or reload the page".  Reason: 
You'll want to know about skulduggery.  On Update tab, disable
"Automatically check for updates to: Installed Add-ons" and
"Automatically check for updates to: Search Engines", and select
"When updates to Firefox are found: Ask me what I want to do".
Reason:  You really want those to happen when and if you choose.
</p>

<p>Now we head over to URL "about:config".  You'll see the
condescending "This might void your warranty!" warning.  Select the
cutesy "I'll be careful, I promise!" button and uncheck "Show this
warning next time".  Reason:  It's your darned browser config.
Hypothetically if you totally screw up, at worst you can close Firefox,
delete ~/.mozilla/firefox/ (after saving your bookmarks.html), and try
again.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "browser.urlbar.matchOnlyTyped = true":</em>  This disables the
Firefox 3.x "Awesome Bar" that suggests searches in the Search box based 
on what it learns from watching your bookmarks and history, which is 
not (in my opinion) all that useful, and leaves information on your
browsing habits lying around.<br>
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "browser.tabs.tabMinWidth = 60" and "browser.tabs.tabMaxWidth =
60":</em> Reduce tab width by about 40%.  Reason:  They're too wide.</p>

<p>
<em>Set "bidi.support = 0":</em>  Reason:  Unless you're going to do data
input in Arabic, Hebrew, Urdu, or Farsi, you won't need bidirectional
support for text areas.  Why risk triggering bugs?</p>

<p>
<em>Set "browser.ssl_override_behavior = 2" and
"browser.xul.error_pages.expert_bad_cert = true"</em>:  This reverts
Firefox's handling of untrusted SSL certificates to the 2.x behaviour.
Reason:  The untrusted-SSL dialogues in Firefox 3.x 
are supremely annoying, "Do you want to add an exception?" prompt and
all.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "network.prefetch-next = false":</em>  Disables link prefetching of
pages Firefox thinks you might want next.  Reason:  Saves needless waste
of bandwidth and avoids sending out yet more information about your
browsing.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "xpinstall.enabled = false":</em> Globally prevents Firefox from
checking for updates to Firefox and installed extensions.  Reason:
This really should happen on your schedule, not Firefox's.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "permissions.default.image = 3":</em>  This control specifies which
images (picture elements) to get, where 1 = all regardless of origin
(default), 2 = block all, 3 = fetch only from the site you're browsing.
Reason:  Images from third-party sites are banner ads or Web bugs, 99%
of the time.  Note that the ability to block third-party images used to 
be part of regular Mozilla/Firefox preferences, but was banished to
"about:config" as part of a general dummying down.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "network.dns.disableIPv6 = true":</em>  Prevents Firefox from
attempting IPv6 lookups.  Reason:  At the moment, for most people,
there's no point to this function, and it wastes network traffic trying
IPv6 before falling back to regular IPv4.  If the world changes, you can
toggle this setting back.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "extensions.blocklist.enabled" to disabled:</em>  Stops Firefox
from repeatedly polling a remote site for a malware blacklist.
Reason:  Wasted traffic, and usual logic about malware applies.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set the three "browser.contentHandlers.types.[012].uri" items to 
blank:</em>  Stops Firefox from repeatedly polling Bloglines, My Yahoo, and
Google for RSS feeds that you don't necessarily care about at all.
Reason: Wasted network traffic.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "plugin.default_plugin_disabled = false":</em> This prevents
Firefox's libnullplugin.so from popping up annoying dialogues suggesting
you go hunting for plugins/extensions every time you encounter a file
on the Web with an unfamiliar MIME type.  Reason:  Stops Firefox's 
repetitive suggestions (in a yellow bar at the top of the page) that you
install yet more plugins/extensions.
</p>

<p>
<em>Set "geo.enabled" to disabled:</em> This is yet another Google 
service that they swear up and down is absolutely not a privacy
violation, and they have a privacy policy, etc.  In this case, it's
"<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/geolocation/">location-aware
browsing</a>", where, on "location-aware Web sites", Google will
estimate your latitude/longitude and provide enhanced services
such as lo! there's a pizza restaurant on the next block.  Reason:
Obvious, I imagine.  Disabling that key makes the feature go away
entirely.
</p>

<h3>Other Ideas</h3>

<p>
We've already lightly touched on a favourite tinfoil-hat obsession: browser
cookies.  Like many other browser features, cookies have a fine
legitimate purpose, that of offering a persistent-data store for what's
normally a stateless protocol (HTTP), e.g., for session data.  Of
course, the feature was abused about a millisecond after its invention,
but the aforementioned unchecking of "Accept third-party cookies" in my
view controls such abuse well enough.
</p>

<p>
What's often neither understood nor controlled are <em>Flash</em> cookies, 
which Adobe calls
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Shared_Object">Local Shared Objects</a>", 
a hidden datastore, holding up to 100kB per domain, maintained by the 
local Adobe (ex-Macromedia) Flash interpreter under your
~/.macromedia tree, in files with .sol filename extensions.  What data?
Anything and everything, but mostly the usual obnoxious per-user tracking, 
except with 25 times the storage and effectively no scrutiny.  Bad?  You bet.
<a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/08/you-deleted-your-cookies-think-again/">Researchers</a>
have found that companies have taken to using Flash cookies not only to
track users but also to re-create, behind the user's back, regular
browser cookies he or she has deliberately deleted -- invisibly to
browser privacy controls and outside their reach.  It should also be
noticed that data in Flash cookies are also queryable by any other 
Flash-enabled application.
</p>

<p>
The standard recommendation to control Flash cookies (which, of course,
are far less of an issue with NoScript and Adblock Plus than without
them) is another Firefox extension, 
<a href="http://netticat.ath.cx/BetterPrivacy/BetterPrivacy.htm">BetterPrivacy</a>
&mdash; but I would like to <em>specifically disrecommend that solution, 
because BetterPrivacy is proprietary software for which source code is
never even available for inspection</em>.  Can you imagine going to all
the trouble of running an open-source browser on an open-source OS, and
then throwing in a "hey, trust me" proprietary binary-only module from
someone you don't even know?
</p>

<p>A new, genuinely open source alternative is Greg Yardley's 
<a href="http://objection.mozdev.org/">Objection</a>, which seems worth
looking into.  Alternatively, it seems almost as easy to write a dirt-simple 
weekly cronjob to delete unwanted Flash cookies by filename.  (E.g.,
you might want to keep certain domains' cookies, that seem to hold only
innocuous Flash-related settings such as Flash games' settings and some
sites' login data, and lop off the rest.)  

<p>
Adobe Systems, Inc., themselves, offer a third alternative:  Visiting a 
set of Adobe Web pages called 
<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">Flash
Settings Manager</a> lets you view and control Flash Cookies via &mdash;
guess what &mdash; a Flash-based control panel the company provides
for that purpose.  Use it if you like.  Personally, I find the notion of
using Adobe's help to control a privacy risk they created to be...
unwise, on balance &mdash; although viewing its settings was enlightening
and worthwhile.  
</p>

<p>
There are plenty of <em>aesthetic</em> improvements one might also
make to clean up Firefox's appearance, but those are obviously highly
individual, so I'll omit my prejudices in that department.  Suffice it
to say that delving through all of the Edit: Preferences and the View
menu will be well worth your time.

<hr>

<p>
<a id="firefox.html_1"></a><a href="#firefox.html_1_back">[1]</a> IT
columnist David Berlind defined "Web 2.0" as "When the Back button
doesn't work". 
</p>

<p>
<a id="firefox.html_2"></a><a href="#firefox.html_2_back">[2]</a>: 
Firefox bloat generally is a real concern.  Starting around 2006,
Jason Halme has shown starkly just how severe the bloat is, by releasing
an optimally configured and compiled (but proprietary-licensed) variant called
<a href="http://getswiftfox.com/">Swiftfox</a>, which is markedly faster
in launching and rendering, and also includes protection against buffer
overflow attacks.
</p>

<p>
Probably inspired by Halme's work, developer "SticKK" has released
a very similar variant under Firefox's original MPL 1.1 open-source
licensing, called <a
href="http://swiftweasel.tuxfamily.org/">Swiftweasel</a>, 
which is well worth considering instead of vanilla Firefox, and is 
packaged by common Linux distributions.  It's fully compatible with
Firefox extensions.  (If you're a Mozilla Thunderbird user, "SticKK's"
Swiftdove lends the same advantages to that program, too.)
</p>

<p> 
<a id="firefox.html_3"></a><a href="#firefox.html_3_back">[3]</a>:  
For example, Debian and Ubuntu both offer maintained packages for Adblock, 
Adblock Plus, NoScript, and the Web Developer extension mentioned by 
Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer.  A package of User Agent Switcher is currently
<a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-mozext-maintainers/2009-April/000020.html">proposed</a>.  And even Fedora, not the most lavish of
desktop distributions, at least packages NoScript.  So, check your 
distribution-of-choice's package listings.
</p>

<p>
Linux and BSD users' ability to rely on their distribution package maintainers 
as gatekeepers against security problems, quality problems, and even against 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/332093/">misbehaviour "upstream"</a> 
(a term used to refer to original authors' source code that
is selectively picked up and packaged, often with some tweaks, by Linux 
distributions) gives them a huge advantage that MS-Windows and MacOS users
can only dream of.  A decade-plus of experience suggests you're greatly
safer when you rely on that gatekeeping function, and go outside that
regime to "upstream" sources only with great caution if ever.
</p>

<p>
"Upstream sources" of what, you might ask?  Firefox extensions would
be one excellent example.  Make no mistake:  These are programs, and you
need to be on-guard.  Browse the listings at Mozilla Organization's
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/">https://addons.mozilla.org/</a> 
"portal" site skeptically, and you soon notice that the site says
nothing about each entry's licensing or source code, and instead rushes
you towards the big "Download Now!" button.  In fact, many extensions 
listed turn out, upon more-careful scrutiny, to be <em>proprietary,
binary-only software</em> that isn't audited by anyone you would have 
confidence in and never will be.  In any situation where you find
yourself casually expected to run code from nobody in particular --
a fair description of unauditable proprietary extensions from people
you've never heard of -- your first reaction should be "No.  Why on
earth would I?"  All of the extensions Ren&eacute; and I have cited are 
genuine open source, and from people with established (generally good) 
reputations, notwithstanding which you should <em>look among your 
distribution's packages for them first</em>, before resorting to 
fetching "upstream" code from the authors' sites.
</p>

<p>
The advantage:  The distribution package maintainer should be accepting
code from upstream only when it's been checked for quality, made to 
comply with your Linux distribution's policies, not a buggy beta 
(not all new code from upstream is necessarily an improvement), 
read to (with luck) catch any unpleasant surprises, and verified to be 
signed by the real upstream coder to eliminate the possibility of
trojaned (booby-trapped) substitute code inserted by malign parties
in place of the author's real code.  Plus, you will get subsequent updates
semi-automatically in a rational fashion, with your regular package
updates, as a harmonised part of your Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>
Other examples of third-party additions include Web apps enticingly offered 
as directly downloadable .tar.gz (or zip) archives, all manner of third-party 
.deb / .rpm packages, alleged screensavers, alleged Internet poker
games, alleged video codecs, alleged desktop themes, alleged 
"birthday cards", alleged ancillary software, etc.  You need to be on
your guard:  You might not be worried about the security of screensaver
modules because they're just gloried wallpaper, but suppose one is
published on a community site in .deb format (and you're on, say,
Ubuntu).  You need to install that with your software package installer,
using sudo or root authority, right?  Oops, bad idea, because that means
you'll be running any included scripts with root authority, and how much
did you trust the unknown person behind this screensaver?  This
scenario's already <a
href="http://amarok.kde.org/blog/archives/1153-The-Malware-Problem-and-a-solution.html">happened</a>,
and unwary novices shot themselves in the foot by installing trojaned
software -- by trusting an alleged screensaver from nobody in particular
who'd listed it on <a href="http://gnome-look.org/">gnome-look.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
It's important to realise that no security protections can protect a 
user who defeats his/her system's security by running untrustworthy
software from nowhere in particular.  If you go out of your way to fetch 
that metaphorical gun and aim it at your feet, the resulting hole in
your pedal extremity is your responsibility.  The best the Linux
community can do is help train you to know when your danger alarms
should be ringing loudly -- and going outside your system's packaged
software regime to any source of third-party software is one of the
chief signs of danger.

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one

away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and

LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access

timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer

</p>

<p>
<p>
Here's all you probably want to know about <em>Linux Gazette's</em>
copyediting staff &mdash; short version: there are a few of us, we disagree
on many things, there are good and compelling reasons why we'll 
never agree, our job is to make your articles as good as possible while
doing no harm, and we not only don't mind authors who disagree with our
policies but think it's healthy and natural.  
</p>

<p>
The rest of this article details tidbits about our editing that yr.
humble author, <em>LG's</em> Proofreading Coordinator, thinks he can
make interesting. (Contentious points will get stressed,
disproportionately: They're more interesting.  Also, be warned that
you're not guaranteed to hear anyone's opinion but the author's, but,
hey, it's my article.)  Note: Please don't think this article aims to
change how you write.  Our mamas having raised no fools, we don't expect
that: this piece just describes how we<a id="nonstyleguide.html_1_back"></a><a href="#nonstyleguide.html_1">[1]</a>
edit.  
</p>

<h3>
Where You Can Stuff Your Chicago Manual of Style
</h3>

<p>
There are good reasons why <em>Linux Gazette</em> neither follows your
favourite house-style writing manual nor has one of its own.  Mainly, it's
because we're (1) international, and (2) not anyone's employer.  Because
we accept pieces from, and publish to, the entire planet, good Australian,
Indian, Irish, Zambian, Fijian, Canadian, and Kiribatian English need
to be respected as much as are, say, UK and US English. Because we don't
fund anyone's daily bread, we wouldn't dream of imposing top-down
rulesets like the <em>Chicago Manual of Style's</em> absurdities about
"open style" reversing everything else in that book. We wouldn't put up
with that sort of arbitrary regimentation for zero money; why would you?
</p>

<p>
We've read your <em>AP Stylebook</em>, <em>New York Times Manual of
Style and Usage</em>, <em>Fowler's</em>, <em>Cambridge Guide</em>, 
<em>Follett's</em>, and <em>Garner's</em>, and think their foibles are
pretty funny (but that the <em>Merriam-Webster</em> guide's free of 
such inadvertent comedy) &mdash; but, more important, that they're 
a poor tool for our mission: that mission is simply to help you
express yourself well and clearly, in your own way of speaking, by
making minimal tweaks to your articles so that, with luck, you're 
pleased with how well you wrote but can't even tell we touched anything.  
</p>

<h3>
The Gazette Is People
</h3>

<p>
It might be nice if we could say what copyediting will and will not
occur, but that's not how the world works.  In the real world, policy 
doesn't get work done; people do.  If the final staffer to touch
your article prior to publication abhors the word "utilize", he/she
will change it to "use" (and who can blame such a staffer, right?).
</p>

<p>
As it turns out, the staff are in cheerful ongoing disagreement on many
key points.  E.g., most of the staff think "website" is a perfectly fine
English word, but the Proofreading Coordinator doesn't, and cares more, so he 
corrects it to "Web site", every time.  That's just the way it works:
Those who put in time and effort get to have their way (but try to use 
that power, such as it is, wisely, and to improve, never to annoy).
</p>

<p>
This article, in fact, basically tells you what corrections are likely
to be done to correct articles by people, notably the Proofreading
Coordinator, in the absence of a house style &mdash; but also
acknowledging the truth that outcome depends on who does the work, because
of the staff's disagreement on significant points.  
</p>

<h3>
The Argument Clinic's That-a-Way
</h3>

<p>
Feel very welcome to tell us why our editing is horribly evil and a sign
of the impending Apocalypse (not to mention that an English teacher once 
mugged you and stole your lunch):  we don't mind, but don't promise to 
take your objection seriously, especially if it's one of the Obnoxious Three: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>"But Chaucer did it."  Poor Geoffrey Chaucer, here, is a placeholder
for any and all historical writers:  The argument in question is that 
[historical writer X] wrote in some questionable way (using "gender" for 
a biological category, mixing "which" and "that", singular "they", 
"quote" as a noun, confusing "imply" with "infer", confusing "nauseous"
with "nauseated"), so it's OK for you, too.</li>
<li>"The English language should be allowed to change."  This is a non-sequitur,
irrelevant point.  Just because LASER became a common noun in ten years
doesn't mean <em>your</em> bizarre neologism is automatically OK.</li>
<li>"[Person X] disagrees with you."  Noted, and so what?  We won't take the 
Appeal to Authority fallacy seriously, nor are we running a popularity
contest or putting our editing practices up for modification by public poll.
Sorry, it just doesn't work that way.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We won't be offended if you send in junk arguments &mdash; on the contrary,
at least it shows you care about writing (and what would the Internet
do without opinions?) &mdash; but you might want to avoid wasting your time.
</p>


<h3>
Flamewar Issues Cannot Be Avoided, So We Just Deal with Them
</h3>

<p>
There's a good reason we don't aim at perfect, pure English:
it doesn't exist and never has, the language having after all resulted from an
unfortunate collision between mediaeval Norman French and lowland German
(loosely speaking).  Many structures in English remain badly broken, and
the ability to speak precisely in it is only thanks to tireless efforts
by many countries to bridge or rope off its crevasses.  Thus the old
joke about a rancher trying to deal with his snake problem: "Dear sirs,
I'd like to order two mongooses."  (He frowns, crosses that out.)
"Dear sirs, I'd like to order two mongeese."  (Frowns, crosses out, tries 
again.)  "Dear sirs, I'd like to order a mongoose.  While you're at it,
please send a second one."
</p>

<p>
One of the numerous eternal and inescapable flamewars about English
revolves around its lack of a generally usable, non-peculiar
third-person singular pronoun that isn't gendered.  Yes, we know this is
a big problem (and part of an even bigger one whereby the language
encourages sexist bias), can quote Douglas Hofstadter's "Person Paper on
Purity in Language" fluently, and (I think I can speak for the staff,
here) agree wholeheartedly with him.  The fact remains that using "they"
(as is often done, these days) to fill the gap tends to destroy that
word's ability to clearly distinguish between singular and plural.<a
id="nonstyleguide.html_2_back"></a><a href="#nonstyleguide.html_2">[2]</a>  
Most on the staff think this damage is perfectly OK; the Proofreading
Coordinator politely and firmly disagrees (and, e.g., doesn't care
whether Chaucer used it, nor 
<a href="http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html">Jane Austen or
any other number of famous authors</a>).  So, don't be surprised if 
your singular "they" becomes "he or she" (one of many imperfect solutions, 
but one that is at least grammatical).  
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Ah, but Rick, now you're assuming everyone is either male or female! <img
src="../gx/smile.png" alt=";)">  -- Kat ]
</p>

<p>
Our copyeditors' most important principle, in that and other areas, is
rather like that of medical schools' maxim of "Primum non nocere"
("First, do no harm").  I call our version Rule Zero:  "Ignore any rule,
rather than doing anything peculiar that will tend to call attention to
itself."
</p>

<p>
Another inescapable flamewar is correction (or not) of quoted text.  The
stilted alleged quotations festooned around many "News Bytes" columns
are a case in point: 
</p>

<blockquote>
"Launchpad accelerates collaboration between open source projects," said
Canonical founder and CEO Mark Shuttleworth. "Collaboration is the
engine of innovation in free software development, and Launchpad
supports one of the key strengths of free software compared with the
traditional proprietary development process. Projects that are hosted on
Launchpad are immediately connected to every other project hosted there
in a way that makes it easy to collaborate on code, translations, bug
fixes, and feature design across project boundaries. Rather than hosting
individual projects, we host a massive and connected community that
collaborates together across many projects. Making Launchpad itself open
source gives users the ability to improve the service they use every
day."
</blockquote>

<p>We of the editorial staff would be thunderstruck, and also dismayed,
if Mark Shuttleworth had <em>actually</em> uttered that mouthful of stilted 
marketing bafflegab (quoted in issue 166).  He seems like a pleasant and
intelligent fellow, so the smart money's on that prose emerging from
someone in Canonical, Ltd.'s corporate PR department (or hired PR agency),
working from a generic press release template.  More to the immediate
point, you should have seen how dreadful these press releases were
before we fixed them.  But, you ask, "How dare you fix a direct quotation?
Isn't it presumptuous to change what someone said?" 
</p>

<p>
You have part of the answer already:  in corporate PR, what you say is
often not what <em>you</em> say.  Accordingly, we have few qualms about
fixing some marketing ghostwriter's bad grammar, spelling, and punctuation.
As to the rest, if a quoted person ever complains "Hey, <em>Linux
Gazette</em> presumed to make me sound literate.  The bastards!" we
will be looking forward to the novelty and to apologising winningly if
insincerely.
</p>

<h3> 
A Few Guidelines Peculiar to the Magazine, Itself
</h3>

<ul>

<li><p><em>Square brackets:  Not yours.</em>  Sorry, but <em>Linux
Gazette</em> generally reserves square brackets for visually indicating 
comments inserted into (or, better yet, at the bottom of) someone else's 
article by the editors themselves.  If we end up speaking rubbish, we 
don't want you to take the blame.  So, you as an author may not use
square brackets (with obvious exceptions such as code where syntax
requires it); it would be confusing.  If you try, we'll change them to
parentheses every single time.  (I'm talking to you, Howard.)</p></li>

<li><p><em>Legal clutter need not apply.</em>  Yes, you want
everyone to put an R-in-circle after your company name Yoyodyne, to
render obeisance to your trademark.  We know.  We don't care.  "TM",
"R", and all of that stuff gets stripped out.  We actually have bothered
to learn the law, and know that we have no obligation to replicate your
marking of your corporate territory, only to avoid infringing your
property rights, which is not the same thing.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Weird lettercase will be ironed out.</em>  Over the
years, corporate branding has asked people to do some extremely peculiar
things with lettercasing of company and product names.  We tend to
politely say "no".  You can write "nVIDIA" or "NVIDIA" all you want,
but in our magazine it's Nvidia &mdash; and "CorelDRAW!" is Right Out.</p>

<p>There are debatable cases; the world isn't perfect.  Novell's
preferred lettercase is "openSUSE", which is only slightly peculiar:
We'd probably change it to "OpenSUSE" because it's a proper noun, 
but maybe not.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Physical styling HTML tags ("i", "bold", "underscore",
"strike") are almost always inappropriate</em> and will be removed. 
Appropriate logical styling will be used where appropriate 
("em", "strong"...).</p></li>

<li><p><em>Strong-text ("strong") HTML tags are viewed skeptically</em>, 
often being typographical excess, and may in those cases be 
amputated.</p></li>

<li><p><em>Tuck punctuation inside a quotation only if it's part of the
quotation.</em>  Generations of editors have imposed the "'Zounds,' Tom
expostulated" convention on authors; we do not, because of the risk of 
ambiguity it creates in technical English.  Consider a sentence 
ending with a reference to "string."  The contents of that text string
might be "string" or might be "string."; it's impossible to tell.</p>

<li><p><em>Consistency, lack of:</em>  Spelling from either side of the 
Atlantic, sneakers vs. trainers, program vs. programme, parka vs.
anorak, quarter note vs. crochet is fine by us.  All we ask is that you
pick <em>one</em>.  If you piece wanders between two otherwise
acceptable usage, spelling, or punctuation patterns concerning the same
thing, one of them is by definition wrong and will be fixed.  We get to
pick which one.</p>

</ul>


<h3>These Are a Few of Our Favourite Peeves</h3>

<p>Here's a grab-bag of the most-encountered blunders (that we imagine
might be interesting):
</p>

<p><em>"spell check":</em>  Unless you mean something that checks
spells (and J.K. Rowling will be jealous, if you do), you should write 
"spelling check".</p>

<p><em>"vice president":</em>  This term is correct if you're referring
to a president in charge of vice (an enviable career option), but not
otherwise.  More than likely, the intended term is "vice-president".</p>

<p><em>"web":</em>  Wrong.  It's a proper noun, "Web" (unless you're
talking about spider extrusions or analogous woven structural meshes, or
a type of offset printing machine).  Note that "webmaster", "weblog",
"webcam", etc. are not proper nouns, so they're lowercase.</p>

<p><em>"website":</em>  Wrong.  It's two words, "Web site".  (But why,
we hear people asking, is "website" an impermissible coinage if
"webmaster", "weblog", and "webcam" aren't?  Because new words were
needed for those concepts.  We already had "Web site"; it works just
fine.  Don't tell us it's too exhausting to include the space character
and lean on your shift key:  We won't buy that.)</p>

<p><em>(lack of) serial comma:</em>  The "a, b, and c" pattern is
preferred over "a, b and c" by many of our editors.  It improves
clarity, and avoids the accidental perception of b and c being a grouped
pair or otherwise having more in common with each other than they do
with a.</p>

<p>In case you doubt this, consider the classic example of a sentence
that really, <em>really</em> needs the serial comma (quoted by Teresa
Nielsen Hayden from a probably apocryphal book dedication):  "I'd like
to thank my parents, Ayn Rand and God."</p>

<p><em>"Free Software":</em>  Sorry, no.  It's just not a proper noun
(except when used as part of an actual name such as Free Software
Foundation or Free Software Definition), so the correct usage is "free
software" as a noun, and "free-software" as a (compound) adjective.</p>

<p>Sure, we know some folks try to draw a distinction between "Free
software" (meaning free as in freedom) and "free software" (meaning free
as in cost).  However, that doesn't work, sorry.  Your readers still
won't get it.</p>

<p><em>"Open Source":</em>  Sorry, no.  It's just not a proper noun
(except when used as part of an actual name, such as Open Source
Initiative or Open Source Definition), so the correct usage is "open
source" as a noun and "open-source" as a (compound) adjective.</p>

<p><em>"email" vs. "e-mail":</em>  The Proofreading Coordinator prefers
the spelling "e-mail" over "email", even though many others on our staff
consistently feel otherwise:  The rationale for the hyphen is that
"email" is too easy to misparse as a one-syllable word, and also is in
fact identical to a somewhat obscure synonym for "enameled" (taken from
the French word for that concept).  This is probably a lost cause, but
don't be surprised if the word does get hyphenated in your article.</p>

<p><em>Apostrophes on plurals of acronyms (and initialisms):</em>  Don't.
It should be 1950s rather than 1950's, 100s rather than 100's, and
BASICs rather than BASIC's (for the plural forms).  Think of it this
way:  That apostrophe serves no purpose and creates confusion with the
possessive case, so Rule Zero dictates leaving it out.  (If you don't,
we will.)</p>

<p><em>Speaking of possessives:</em>  The possessive of "emacs" (a
singular noun) is "emacs's", not "emacs'".  Similarly, the possessive of
"Xandros" (a singular noun) is "Xandros's", not "Xandros'".  Get it?</p>

<p>We could go on.  We shouldn't &mdash; and we know all of the above
will keep on needing correction.  That's OK, really.</p>


<h3>Don't Take It Too Seriously</h3>

<p>The English language is a train-wreck.  Don't sweat it.  We just aim
for it to be a well-swept, orderly train-wreck &mdash; solely so that
<em>your</em> work as authors gets displayed as well as we can
manage.</p>

<p>There's an old joke among copy-editors:  "Q:  Should the phrase
'anal-retentive' be hyphenated?  A:  Always when it's used as a compound
adjective. Never when it's a compound noun."  If you found that amusing,
you might just be one of us.</p>

<p><a id="nonstyleguide.html_1"></a><a
href="#nonstyleguide.html_1_back">[1]</a>:  Some uses of "we" in this piece
are covered by the middle fork of Mark Twain's dictum that the "editorial
we" is permitted only to kings, editors, and people with the tapeworm.
</p>

<p><a id="nonstyleguide.html_2"></a><a
href="#nonstyleguide.html_2_back">[2]</a>:  Erosion of English speakers'
ability to distinguish singular from plural has become unmistakable:
For example, not long ago, I heard a radio announcer say "Levitz is
having a sale at their Oakland warehouse."  Such phrasing makes my head
spin, but now passes without comment among the general public.  
</p>

[ I'm sorry it makes your head spin, Rick, but I suspect your problem lies
here: <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun/</a>

is a major difference in usage between British and American English, as
with this example: "In AmE, collective nouns are usually singular in
construction: the committee was unable to agree... " (from <a

<p class="editorial">
[ "The Devil", as someone once noted, "is in the details." The general
thrust of this article is indeed spot-on; there's much disagreement on
editing technique, but it's not a problem, since the edits are serially
applied. The individual editors' and proofers' styles, though, can vary quite
a lot: e.g., while Rick's focus may be on good grammar, mine is more
about clarity and readability of the entire piece.  He prefers a light touch,
while I don't hesitate to hack'n'slash mercilessly in the service of making
an article as comprehensible as possible (and, much like him, I've still yet
to hear from an outraged author whose work I've "damaged" with this
treatment). We do our best to leave the style of the writing alone, though;
the author's voice is indeed an important and valuable part of the
whole, and deserves to be heard.
</p>

<p class="editorial">The important point here - the really important
point - is that this is how true cooperation works. Rick and I are not
competing with each other, nor are we competing against the other editors
or proofreaders; we are all fellow contributors, with each adding his or her
effort into the common pot. The end result, the work that we produce,
benefits not only from our combined effort, but from the synergy that
results from intentional cooperative efforts of a group. This, folks, is
open source in action. -- Ben ]
</p>

<hr>

<p class="editorial">
[ Ben, I can't help mentioning that you almost certainly mean "differ",
when you say that "editors' and proofers' styles can very quite a lot."
If something varies, that means it, itself, is undergoing change over
time.  If it differs, that merely means it is unlike something else.
Your average jockey and basketball players' heights differ.  Each of
them has a height that varies only over, say, his or her teenage years.

Did I ever mention that copyeditors are incurable wiseasses? -- Rick ]

<p class="editorial">
[ Rick, I can't help mentioning that you almost certainly mean
"v<strong>a</strong>ry quite a lot" when you (mis)quote me in your
wisecrack. From The Jargon File: "It's an amusing comment on human
nature that spelling flames themselves often contain spelling errors."
</p>

<p class="editorial">
As for your grammar correction, I can't help mentioning (well, I could, but
it wouldn't be any fun) that you've tripped over your own shoelaces. I
quote Webster's Dictionary: "2. To differ, or be different; to be unlike or
diverse; as, the laws of France vary from those of England." No time
component stated or required; in fact, none of the meanings cited by
Webster or WordNet require one.

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/cabal/os-suck.html">sucked less</a>, he blew
away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and
support.  He helped plan the LINC Expo (which evolved into the first
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access
to a card-walloping IBM mainframe at Stanford (1969).  A glutton for
punishment, he then moved on (during high school, 1970s) to early HP
timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer
sessions, and so on.  He's thus better qualified than most, to know just
how much better off we are now.

<P> When not playing Silicon Valley dot-com roulette, he enjoys
long-distance bicycling, helping run science fiction conventions, and
concentrating on becoming an uncarved block.

<h1>Bidirectionally Testing Network Connections</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
Beginning in Spring 2009, I started seeing network problems at some
customer sites: data transmissions would hang and time out; connections via
OpenVPN links would work at first but time out as soon as more data was
transmitted; VPN connections using UDP would not work at all (but would
work magically when changing OpenVPN's port to 80/TCP). All these symptoms
are usually tied to traffic shaping, problems with the maximum packet size
(maximum transfer unit, MTU) or other issues usually found between the
end-points of the transmission. But how do you test and record the
performance of "your" Internet?  
</p>

<h3>
Using Network Tools for Debugging
</h3>

<p>
First of all, you can use network tools to inspect the path between the
two communication partners.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <tt>hping3</tt> is a tool to construct arbitrary TCP/IP packets and
     send them to hosts.  This is very useful for sending TCP SYN packets and
     seeing if TCP SYN+ACK packets return.  You can also send packets with a
     custom payload, and check for MTU issues.</li>
<li> <tt>ping</tt> is a well-known tool for sending ICMP Echo Request
     packets.</li>
<li> <tt>tracepath</tt> is used for discovering the MTU between source
     and destination. It uses UDP packets, starting with a size of 65536 byte
     and reducing the size after receiving timeouts or errors.</li>
<li> <tt>traceroute</tt> is the classic tool for displaying the 
     intermediate hops between source and destination.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most tools display error messages, round-trip/response times and other
useful information.  Although many people rely on the results of tools,
always keep in mind that sending test packets is not the same as sending
real data over different protocols. There are routers and other network
devices out there that do not treat every packet equally.  
</p>

<p>
One site reported very strange effects. Immediately after you used a
Bittorrent client or a protocol over "bad ports", the bandwidth for
"regular" network traffic dropped notably.  After half an hour or more, the
performance would return to normal. This behaviour may indicate a violation
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">net
neutrality</a>, the presence of filters, or other defects. The big problem
is to find the cause, since it could be the network path, flaky hardware,
broken software, prioritisation of network traffic, policy enforcement, or
some entirely different reason. If there are intermediate network devices
manipulating your packet flow, then there's a chance you will never
identify or "see" these devices with the tools available.  
</p>

<h3>
Using Data Transmissions for Debugging
</h3>

<p>
Using "real" data and "real" protocols for testing is better, but how do
you do that? Clicking on download links in your Web browser and using a
stop watch isn't well suited to finding hard facts.  What about the other
direction? Downloads are treated differently from uploads, if you're on
an asymmetric Internet connection. You need to test transfers in both
directions, and you need to use different protocols and ports. Why not
let a script do all of this, and collect a nice summary?  
</p>

<p>
First, we thought to use a shell script containing a few tools, and send
data around. The problem is that you might want to do some statistics.
Filtering the output and calculating transmission rates can be quite
difficult. That's why a Perl script was created. It uses HTTP, HTTPS, SCP,
FTP, SMTP, and IMAP. All protocols except SMTP are automatically used
bidirectionally. The script uses a configuration file where login,
password, paths, and other parameters can be configured. You can use
different servers for every protocol, if you want. The data to be
transferred can be given explicitly by file. If no file is given, then the
script will create a given amount of random data using OpenSSL's
pseudo-random generator code. The full configuration file with all entries
looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Size of data - you can either provide a file or a number of bytes.
# If the file is set to "none", the number of random bytes is used.
data_bytes=65536
data_chunk=8192
data_file="none"
logfile="result.log"
tests=3
# Send report by email
email="recipient@example.net"
cc="none"
smtp_relay="localhost"
# HTTP URLs
http_download="http://www.example.net/tmp/crypto_schrift.png"
http_upload="http://www.example.net/internettester.php"
# HTTPS URLs
https_download="https://www.example.net/tmp/crypto_schrift.png"
https_upload="https://www.example.net/internettester.php"
# FTP
ftp_server="ftp.example.net"
ftp_username="ftpuser"
ftp_password="password"
ftp_path="none"
# IMAP connection (we use the INBOX)
imap_server="mail.example.net"
imap_port="143"
imap_messages=5
imap_username="mailuser"
imap_password="password"
imap_ssl="no"
# SCP connection
scp_server="www.example.net"
scp_port=22
scp_path="/tmp"
scp_username="user"
# SMTP
smtp_server="mail.example.net"
smtp_port=25
smtp_subject="This is a automatically generated email from internettester.pl (%u)"
smtp_from="tester@example.net"
smtp_to="devnull@example.net"
# SSL parameters
ssl_ca=""
ssl_cert=""
ssl_key=""
# Temporary directory
tmpdir="/tmp"
</pre>

<p>
It is important that the HTTP and HTTPS upload URLs handle POST
requests. One way of doing this is to place the PHP script <a
href="misc/pfeiffer/internettester.php.txt">internettester.php</a> on a
Web server. The script receives the POST requests, checks the
parameters, and discards the upload data.  If you need to use SSL with
certificates, then you can add the path to a certificate, key, and
certificate authority to the configuration, too. (See the section "SSL
parameters".)
</p>

<p>
The results are printed on standard output. If you want the results by
e-mail, then you can set the parameters <em>email</em>, <em>cc</em>, and
<em>smtp_relay</em>. The output is then put into an e-mail message and
sent via SMTP.
</p>

<p>
In order to do the actual measurements, you will need at least one
endpoint with an Internet connection with known parameters. You can use
a place on a co-located server, but bear in mind that the connectivity
will most probably be shared. 100 Mbit/s or more sounds a lot - if you
have well-behaving neighbours. The bandwidth should at least be higher
than the one at the endpoint you are interested in testing.  
</p>

<p>
The <a href="misc/pfeiffer/internettester.pl.txt">script itself</a>
needs only Perl and a couple of modules for all the protocols used. You
can check if you have all modules by using <tt>perl -cw
internettester.pl</tt> on the command line. On Debian or Ubuntu systems,
the packages of the Perl modules start with <em>lib</em> and end with
<em>-perl</em>. So the module Crypt::OpenSSL::Random translates to the
package <em>libcrypt-openssl-random-perl</em>.  
</p>

<h3>
Running the Script
</h3>

<p>
Running the script is fairly straightforward. It takes only two optional
parameters.  By using <tt>--config</tt>, you can direct the script to use
a configuration file. By default, it uses <em>internettester.cfg</em>.
The other parameter sets the debug mode.  It lets you see what the
script does.
</p>

<pre class="code">
lynx@nightfall:~$ ./internettester.pl --config lg.cfg

<p>
I cut the output after the first two protocols. The script measures only 
bandwidth. Packet loss and round-trip time are not recorded. You can see
the mean, maximum, and minimum of the measured rates. They are computed
with the help of the Statistics::Descriptive module. The fourth value is
the standard deviation. It indicates how far away the measurements are
away from the mean. Low values of standard deviation indicate low
variations of the individual transfer rate. Make sure the number of
tests is not too low for a statistical analysis.  
</p>

<p>
A word of warning: The tests will probably saturate your Internet link.
All tests use TCP, which will tend to grab all your bandwidth (on a
"standard" link). Measurements during office hours should be
coordinated.  
</p>

<h3>
What's next?
</h3>

<p>
The script is no magic bullet, and won't detect all of your network
problems, but can perform automated tests and record the bandwidth
used. Feel free to adapt the code to your requirements.

<h1>Sharing a keyboard and mouse with Synergy (Second Edition)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a> and <a href="../authors/milner.html">Steve 'Ashcrow' Milner</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p> 
<a href="http://synergy2.sf.net/">Synergy</a> is an open source project
that allows you to share a keyboard and a mouse among several different
computers, each connected to some sort of monitor, without any extra
hardware (e.g., KVM switches). Synergy runs over the network, and can be
used with several different operating systems.
</p>

<p>
Synergy runs as a client/server application, where the server is the
computer that will have the keyboard and mouse attached to it, and all
others will connect as clients. Switching from one display to another is
only a matter of moving the mouse to the edge of the screen, and Synergy
will detect the mouse pointer leaving one screen and entering another.
</p>

<h3>
Advantages of using Synergy
</h3>

<ul>
<li>You can copy and paste between computers, because Synergy merges 
    clipboards across the systems.</li>
<li>It synchronizes screen savers (lock screens), so they start up 
    at the same time.</li>
<li>If you have an old computer or laptop, you can use it as a Synergy 
    client through an SSH session, and you can make your multi-computer 
    environment behave like a multi-display workstation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Installing Synergy<br>
</h3>

<p>
If you use a Debian-based distribution, you should be able to run:
</p>

<p>
<code>sudo -c apt-get install synergy</code>
</p>
  
<p>
While on an RPM-based distribution, you can install by running:
</p>

<p>
As root:
</p>

<p>
<code>yum install synergy</code>
</p>

<h3>
Setting up Synergy as the server
</h3>

<p>
Create a config file called <tt>synergy.conf</tt>. (You may place it in /etc or in
~/.synergy.conf.) Below is a basic example of the synergy.conf file that
configures a client workstation to the right of the server. Notice that,
under the options section, we have turned on screensaver
synchronization.
</p>

<pre class="code">
section: options
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;screenSaverSync = true
end
section: screens
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;server.hostname:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;client.hostname:
end
section: links
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;server.hostname:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;right = client.hostname
client.hostname:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;left = server.hostname
end
</pre>

<p>
The screens section defines what screens are available. In the links
section, the screens are set up relative to each other.  
</p>

<p>
You can find more detailed configuration options at <a
href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/configuration.html">Synergy's
configuration file format page</a>.
</p>

<h3>
Starting up Synergy as the server
</h3>

<p>
As your regular (non-root) user, start the server:
</p>

<pre class="code">
synergys --config /etc/synergy.conf
</pre>

<p>
The Synergy web site also has a dedicated session for <a
href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/autostart.html">auto-starting the
Synergy server on different platforms</a>.
</p>

<h3>
Setting up Synergy as the client
</h3>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have installed the Synergy package on your client 
    machines, just as you did on the server.</li>
<li>Make sure your client and server have defined hostnames
    other than localhost. If not, you can still use an IP address to 
    designate Synergy's hostname.</li>
<li>Make sure you are logged in to your X environment.</li>
<li>Don't run synergyc as root</li>
<li>Open a terminal, and start up the client:
<code> synergyc -f server.hostname</code>
<br>
<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
If the connection is successful, you will see the message below, as 
part of the output from the connections:
</p>

<pre class="code">
NOTE: synergyc.cpp,247: connected to server
</pre>

<p>
If the connection fails, the client will keep trying to re-connect a few
more times, but we recommend you look at 
<a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/">Synergy's troubleshooting
page</a>. Once you have successfully connected the client and the
server, you can remove the <code>-f</code> option
from the synergyc command, and it will run as a background process on
your computer.  
</p>

<h3>
Firewall
</h3>

<p>
As with any good server-client application, it is important to remember
that you may need to configure your firewall to allow the connections
between synergys and synergyc to be established. Synergy runs on port
24800 by default, but by using the -a option, you can customize the
server to listen on a different socket.  
</p>

<h3>
Privacy
</h3>

<p>
Note that, if you will be using Synergy over a network that is shared
with other users, you may want to look into wrapping your usage with <a
href="http://www.stunnel.org/">stunnel</a> or 
<a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/security.html">SSH</a>.  
</p>

<h3>
Synergy+
</h3>

<p>
Since 2006, there haven't been any updates to Synergy. Since then,
a 'maintenance fork' has been created and called 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/" id="wvc9"
title="Synergy+">Synergy+</a> (synergy-plus). The new project has posted a
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/list?can=1&amp;q=status:ReallyFixed,MaybeFixed,AlmostFixed"
id="i_qr" title="list of fixes">list of fixes</a> its developers have
implemented so far, and 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/synergy-plus/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=&amp;sort=-milestone&amp;colspec=ID%20Stars%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary"
id="ycfh" title="issues">issues</a> they want to fix or implement in future
releases, including the implementation of secure connections between
client and server.  
</p>

<h3>
QuickSynergy
</h3>

<p>
To make life even easier, two developers from Brazil, C&eacute;sar L. B.
Silveira and Ot&aacute;vio C. Cordeiro, have developed a GUI for configuring
Synergy. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/quicksynergy/" id="vn8a"
title="Quicksynergy">Quicksynergy</a> is available in several Linux
distributions, and is also available under Mac OS X (Leopard).  
</p>

</div>

<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>

<p>
With Synergy set up and installed, you no longer have to envy coworkers
with multi-monitor setups, and you will be able to breathe new life into
your old computers and displays.

<em>
<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?

The following is a sampling of the responses we got to our recent <a

every one of these with interest, and am considering how to integrate the

<h3>
Don't die, improvise
</h3>

<p>
I see <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org">linuxquestions.org</a> is quite busy
and I have found it a good place to look for ideas on related problems to
mine. Similarly Google, with the right choice and order of keywords works
wonders these days. I still find that I have a big need (when I try to get
around to it) for well written howtos on things like setting up a simple
home DNS, sendmail, IP traffic accounting per day per machine, mumble, etc.
(Read: A five easy step wizard type thing for my distribution is required).
Things like IPtables and sendmail configuration files, .m4 are still
daunting to me. Real scary stuff. The moment I sit down, starting to read
up on it, someone in the house would like to do this or that and would just
like to ask...
</p> 

<p>
What I would not mind is a monthly email reminder on the
latest linuxgazette issue. (The LQ email is not too much spam for me.)
Whenever I have come across your magazine, I never have been disappointed
with the read and always tried to make a mental note to come back to it,
but just like the commercial magazines sites just lay there as a possible
reference for new information. (Yes, I am not a frequent reader.) I would
like to know which howtos are newly updated and worth a read and which are
too outdated (for the current releases of which distributions) How about
more cross links to and from new and updated articles in previous and
current issues - like LQ's list at the bottom of the page.  I would like to
know more about the kernel development (in a nutshell) that I can
understand.  What info is just as well documented on wikipedia?  To what
extend would articles already published elsewhere (commercially) be allowed
to be published here later (on LG.net)?
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ We send out a monthly reminder e-mail, with the article titles and
summaries, via the <a
href="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/listinfo/lg-announce">lg-announce
mailing list</a>; we also notify the world via a note on Facebook and
Twitter (thanks to Anderson Silva). Meanwhile, funny you should mention -
Rick Moen just wrote a series on DNS in issue 170. As far as links to and
from old issues, our <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/faq/kb.html">Knowledge Base</a> has lots of
links to our previous articles. Do be aware, however, that many articles
drift out of scope after a while; Linux tends to grow by leaps and bounds,
so relevant information changes over time.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
As to republishing articles, that depends on how restrictive the original
publication license was (essentially, how much of their rights to the work
the author has signed away or retained.) Assuming that we can re-release it
under the OPL, and the subject matter is relevant to LG's mission, I'll be
happy to take a look at it. ]

<h3>
Why I hope that the Linux Gazette continues to publish
</h3>

<p>
I saw your Back Page letter in the December issue, asking to hear the
voices of your readers.  As a long-time silent reader of the Linux
Gazette, I guess I am overdue in letting you know why I find the Gazette a
valuable resource.
</p>

<p>
Although I could probably ramble on for quite a while, I'll limit myself
to the following four reasons why I hope that the Gazette lives for years
to come.
</p>


<h4>
1.  The Linux Gazette provides original content.
</h4>

<p>
In earlier times, sites with original content were not hard to find on the
Internet.  A search engine might direct you to dozens of sites run by
people or organizations that were actively involved, or at least
well-versed, in the subject you were seeking information about.  Often
times these sites existed because the people that created them had a
passion for the subject, wanted to share their knowledge of it, and took
pride in doing so.
</p>

<p>
These days, instead of dozens of sites, a search engine might direct you
to hundreds or thousands of sites.  Unfortunately, most of these sites
will contain information simply copied from other sites -- often sites
that have already copied it from somewhere else.
</p>

<p>
The people behind such sites do not have a passion for your subject of
interest, and they take no pride in presenting accurate information. These
sites exist in hopes of generating advertising revenue.
</p>

<p>
The Linux Gazette, on the other hand, has roots that go back to the days
when the desire to share helpful information was often the main
inspiration for creating a web site.  And the folks behind the Gazette
have continued the tradition to the present.
</p>

<p>
When I am looking for Linux-related information, <tt>"site:linuxgazette.net"</tt>
are often the first words I type into the search engine.  Often I will
find just what I need.  And when I don't find what I need, I will soon
know that; I won't have had to wade through a lot of crap before coming up
empty-handed.
</p>


<h4>
2.  The Linux Gazette focuses on substance over style.
</h4>

<p>I don't go to my web browser because I want to look at the latest artistic
creation of some overpaid web designer.  I want information.  And I don't
want to see the latest state-of-the-art methods of distracting me from
getting to and reading the information.
</p>

<p>
The Linux Gazette is mostly just good ol' HTML.  (Well, these days I guess
it is actually XHTML, but isn't that mostly good ol' HTML?)  And that is
all that it needs to be.  And that means that anyone can actually read it
with any browser, with no need to update to this week's version, or
reading and agreeing to a long license agreement for and downloading some
proprietary "helper".
</p>

<p>
While things like javascript and flash certainly have their place in the
world, when they are used for content which could easily be presented with
HTML they are an unnecessary complication.  And I appreciate it when web
sites are designed without unnecessary complications.
</p>

<p>
To say that the Gazette focuses on substance over style, certainly does
not mean that it lacks style.  I find the elegantly simple style to be a
welcome change from the overly-busy pages that seem to predominate on the
Web today.
</p>

<p>
Let's see, you go to linuxgazette.net and are presented with a list of
issues.  Clicking on an issue brings you the table of contents for that
issue.  Clicking on an article name brings you to the article.  What could
be more straight-forward than that?  And if you are looking for something
other than the content of the magazine, there is a clearly-labeled
navigation bar at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
By contrast the current fashion seems to be to provide multiple lists of
links -- on the left side, on the right side, in the middle, at the top,
at the bottom, wherever links can be placed to allow you to go directly to
almost any other page on the web site and half a dozen other web sites as
well.  Never mind that I came to the page for some specific content
(perhaps one of those many lists) and don't want to spend time looking
around the page to see where it is hiding.
</p>

<p>
Give me a nice hierarchical layout like LG uses any day.
</p>

<p>
Centuries ago, newspapers realized that text was easier on the eyes if the
lines were not too long.  Because the Gazette minimizes its formatting, I
can (as I prefer) use a small window for my browser and the text, being
HTML, will be adjusted into lines that are a length which is easy to read.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, many sites these days override this wonderful feature of
HTML, and force me to read lines of a length that have been hard-coded by
their web site designers.  And these designers have not had a good
conversation with newspaper publishers, so I am forced to read long lines
in a wide window or do a heck of a lot of horizontal scrolling.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'm not just saying that I appreciate the style of the Gazette.
I'm also saying that I appreciate the fact that you spend time on the
content that might otherwise be wasted designing a complicated style (and
probably redesigning it every year when you got tired of it).
</p>


<h4>
3. The Linux Gazette is a serial publication.
</h4>

<p>
I know that early in every month I can go to linuxgazette.net and find new
content.  I also know that if I am busy and don't visit until late in the
month (as was the case this month), the new content will still be there
waiting for me -- I don't have to keep checking frequently to ensure that
I don't miss something.
</p>

<p>
Many web sites that host Linux information seem to be forever in a state
of flux.  Sometimes that is because they are for ever being redesigned
("what are we paying our web designer for if the web site never gets
redesigned?"), and sometimes it is in the nature of the the design to be
forever changing: new information replaces the old; old information
vanishes or goes into hiding.
</p>

<p>
With the Linux Gazette, I know that if I find a useful article today, it
will still be available tomorrow, next week, and next month.  Even next
year it will still be available in the archive.  And -- except on the rare
need to correct some gross error -- the article will not have changed from
the time I first read it.  I won't have the aggravation of trying to track
down something that no longer exists.  (Much as I like Wikipedia -- at
least for its links to _real_ sources -- its dynamic nature can leave one
wondering about one's rate of advancing senility when revisiting a page
read in the past.)  The Gazette has a solid feel to it -- not quite as
solid as a stack of paper magazines sitting on a shelf, but much better
than the vast majority of what is found on the Web these days.
</p>


<h4>
4.  The accuracy of information at the Linux Gazette is well above
average.
</h4>

<p>
People, organizations, and corporations can mix varying amounts of fiction
into the factual content of their web sites.  In many, perhaps most, cases
the authors do not even realize it is fiction.
</p>

<p>
While the Linux Gazette is certainly not totally immune to this, I believe
it has far less of a problem in this department than many other sources.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, as touched on in item 1, above, when people take pride in what
they write (which I believe is a main reason that LG authors write -- they
certainly aren't doing it for the money), they are more likely to spend
time getting their facts straight.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, LG articles are read by someone other than the author before
publication.  And while the editors may not yet have achieved infinite
knowledge, there is more of a chance of misinformation being caught at
this stage.
</p>

<p>
Thirdly, LG has an auto-immune system known as Talkback.  When mistakes
are made, there is a good chance that someone will spot it and point it
out, as readers are encouraged to do by the availability of the Talkback
link.  Sometimes, even when no mistake has been made, this encourages a
reader to clarify something, or add additional information that was not in
the original article.
</p>

<p>
(The advantages of multiple people reviewing the content, be it before or
after publication, extends to the area of LG beyond the articles, such as
The Answer Gang and Two-cent Tips.  Hearing multiple voices adds to the
confidence level the reader has in the information (except, of course, in
those rare times when nobody can agree on anything).)
</p>



<p>
Okay, so there is one man's view of some reasons why the Linux Gazette has
certainly not "outlived its usefulness to the community".
</p>

<p>
If the Gazette ceased to publish new issues, the archives could still
exist.  However it would be a shame to let the archives get moldy with no
fresh input.  In a short time they would be of more interest to historians
than people looking for current information.
</p>

<p>
I hope that many other readers will share their thoughts with you, and let
you know that the work that you and everyone who contributes to the
Gazette is certainly not for naught, and is well appreciated.
</p>

[ Norm, thank you for your detailed and thoughtful input! It's nice to know
that our various editorial choices are appreciated. That is indeed why we
have a serial presentation, and a relatively simple layout. I like your
description of Talkback as "an auto-immune system" - it's become one of my

<h3>
Write about it!
</h3>

<p>
Hallo,
     I've just finished reading your Back Page in the last issue of LG. 
It made me feel like I just _had to_ jump to Thunderbird and write you 
an e-mail!
</p>

<p>
Your article is really inspiring and makes one really want to think 
about one of the thousands ideas that come to mind during a week of work 
with Linux and write about it...
</p>

<p>
I have wanted to do it some times. I also know myself enough to be sure 
that when I'll calm down, a few minutes from now, I'm likely to forget 
about all this and never write anything.
</p>

<p>
BUT.
</p>

<p>
I'll bookmark this article and put it at the top in my list, so next 
time an idea comes to me I'll remember I'll _have_ to at least try and 
write about it. And send it to LG!
</p>

<p>
And by the way, I've been and LG reader for some months now and I've 
never said thank you for your work. I do it now.
</p>

<h3>
And who are our readers?
</h3>

<p>
I finally had time to catch up on LG and the Back Page #169 requested a
little feedback.
</p>

<p>
Consider this it.
</p>

<p>
Who am I (And where have I heard that before?)?   I'm a retired Industrial
Electronic Tech, one of those twigits with dirt under the fingernails.    We
were stuck with that M$ creature at work, but at home, I ran Linux.   I
currently have 5 boxes networked at the house and all but one are Linux -
PCLinuxOS 2009, to be exact.    The one Windows machine is my wife's HP
laptop (Vista) that is dedicated to her embroidery machine, which can dual
boot to SimplyMepis.
</p>

<p>
I've been distro hopping since the around 1995.   Geez, I was on the
Internet when it was all text and you had to go thru a bulletin board that
had Internet access.   Then you had to know a few Unix commands to find your
way to a server and log in.   Remember when the search engines were named,
'Gopher', 'Archie', 'Veronica' and the like?   My God!  I think I'm old...
I started with FreeBSD way back when, then Debian and the whole schemer.
My favorite was the Debian based Kanotix.   But when it went under the bus,
I didn't care for the replacements: Sidux and the re-dazzled Kanotix, which
seemed pretty much a step-child.
</p>

<p>
When I hit PCLos, I found what I was looking for.   A tool that just works,
like a good table saw or a solid lathe.   The reason the wife's laptop has
Mepis is it was the first distro that would configure that machine's
Broadcom 43xx wireless chip out of the box.
</p>

<p>
I'm also a Ham Radio operator - AI4KH - and refuse to use MS for anything
Ham related.   Although, DXLab's suite, is my favorite, I've given it up
rather than go thru the pain of opening and, especially, closing any MS
operating system.    I get by with the Linux apps for digital operation and
logging,
</p>

<p>
If I was a programmer like my daughter, I'd be helping with some of the
Linux apps.   Alas, I'm also a woodworker, shooter, and Scottish Country
Dancer besides being active in US Submarine Veterans (USSVI).  I retired
from the Navy in '74, so I'm not a kid anymore.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I do touch base with LG when I have a chance, just too see what's going
on.   There is just  sooo much stuff out there, it's nice to know I can
still count on LG for honesty.
</p>

<p>
I hope this wasn't too long-winded for you.   I tend to run on at the
keyboard.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,<br>
Ron Gemmell<br>
Canton, GA<br>
</p>

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a>, <a
href="../authors/okopnik1.html">son</a> and daughter; his Palm Pilot is
crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
