<H1>Quick autofs Tutorial</H1>

What is autofs? Autofs uses automount to mount cdrom and floppy drives 
(and other things) to your computer as you need them and umount as
they are not being used. What is mount and unmount? Mount and umount
are programs to mount a device ontop of a directory. For example, 
this command would mount the first floppy drive (drive a: in DOS terms)
to the directory "/mnt/floppy" so that everytime you access "/mnt/floppy" 
to access your floppy drive.
<p>
<pre>
mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
</pre>
<p>
And this command unmounts or frees up the floppy drive from being used.
<p>
<pre>    
umount /dev/fd0 
</pre>    

<p>
Now, in DOS terms, your floppy disk is accessed as you need it. For normal
users, that is what they would expect. They wouldn't want to use
mount and umount because it is time consuming and because they might not
get it right. 
<p>
I assume "/dev/cdrom" is your cdrom drive and "dev/fd0" is your
floppy drive. I am also assuming you will backup your "/etc/auto.master"
file. 
Use this script to create the following threes files and restart autofs.
 Login as "root", goto 
your home directory, copy whatever between
the next two lines to a file called "CreateAutofs.script" and execute 
the script with the command 
<pre> 
source CreateAutofs.script
</pre>

<HR> 
<pre>
cd
echo "Please ignore any errors when making directories"
     ### Let us make sure the two directories exist, ignore errors
mkdir /mnt/floppy
mkdir /mnt/cdrom
     ### Let us backup the auto files in case they haven't
mv /etc/auto.master /etc/auto.master_old
mv /etc/auto.floppy /etc/auto.floppy_old
mv /etc/auto.cdrom /etc/auto.cdrom_old
     ### Create the files for autofs
echo "/mnt/cdrom /etc/auto.cdrom --timeout 10" > /etc/auto.master
echo "/mnt/floppy /etc/auto.floppy --timeout 1" >> /etc/auto.master
echo "floppy   -user,suid,fstype=msdos :/dev/fd0" > /etc/auto.floppy
echo "cdrom    -fstype=iso9660,ro   :/dev/cdrom" > /etc/auto.cdrom
     ### Create the links to the floppy drive and cdrom drive
ln -s /mnt/floppy/floppy a:
ln -s /mnt/cdrom/cdrom d:
ln -s /mnt/floppy/floppy floppy
ln -s /mnt/cdrom/cdrom cdrom 
     ### Lets retstart autofs, you might have to reboot
cd /etc/rc.d/init.d
./autofs restart
     ### If it didn't work, you might have to reboot 
     ### Try "./autofs start" if the restart claims autofs has not been
     #### started
cd

</pre>
<HR> 

<p>
The end of your results should look something like the following if it
was sucessfull
<pre>
Start /usr/sbin/automount --timeout 10 /mnt/cdrom file /etc/auto.cdrom
Start /usr/sbin/automount --timeout 1 /mnt/floppy file /etc/auto.floppy
</pre>

Now put a floppy disk formatted for MSDOS and a cdrom in and execute the
commands 
<pre>
ls a:
ls d:
</pre>
to see if there is anything on them. Hopefully you don't get any error
messages. 

<p>
Personally, my /etc/auto.floppy file looks like 
<pre>
floppy          -fstype=auto,defaults,user,suid :/dev/fd0
</pre>
and my /etc/auto.cdrom file look like this
<pre>
cdrom           -fstype=iso9660,user,suid       :/dev/cdrom
</pre>

The reason why I gave conservative values in the script was the fact the
my values might be security hazards. But since I am the only person
using my computer, I wanted to make sure my personal account had full
access to the floppy and cdrom drives. Also, -fstype=auto doesn't seem
to work quite right when your disk is formated for MSDOS, but works
fine with ext2. "-fstype=auto" tries to autodetect the file format. 

<p>
If you noticed the timeout value for the floppy drive is 1 second. 
This makes it so that by the time the floppy drive light has gone out, 
your floppy disk is unmounted and  a normal user 
can take the floppy
disk out and "nothing bad happens". I made the timeout value for the cdrom
10 seconds because it wasn't working really well at 1 second, and I
figured it was because the drive didn't have enough time to "warm up"
before it was being shut down. You might want to test what the timeout
value for your cdrom drive should be. 

<p>
To get more information about autofs, do the commands
<pre>
man 5 autofs
man autofs
</pre>
and look the the directory "usr/doc" for the directory "autofs-0.3.14"
or something similar to it. 

<h2> Now to explain it </h2>
Okay, here is my brief explanation for what is happening. Read the man
pages and any docs first.

<p>
Your "/etc/rc.d/init.d/autofs" script first looks at "/etc/auto.master".
That file usually has three things on each line. It has
the directory which all mounts will be located at. Then next to that value
is the filename which contains the configuration(s) for what devices you
want mounted. We will call these filenames the "supplemental" files. Next
to that value is the timeout which you want to
occur after so many seconds of inactivity. The timeout will free or umount
all devices specificed in the supplemental files after so many seconds of
inactivity. 
<p>
Now, the supplemental files can have more than on entry, but for my
purposes I don't do that. Read below for the explanation. The supplemental
files can be named anything you want them to be named. They also have
three values for each entry. The first value is the "psuedo" directory. I
will explain this later. The second value contains the
mount options. The third value is the device (like "/dev/fd0" which
is the floppy drive) which the "psuedo" directory
is connected to.
<p>
The "pseudo" directory is contained in the directory which is defined
in "/etc/auto.master". When people try to access this "psuedo" directory,
they will be rerouted to the device you specified. For example, the above
script will generate a link called "a:" which if you list with the
command "ls a:" will give you a list of files in the floppy drive. Or, a
similar command would be "ls /mnt/floppy/floppy". But if you do the
command "ls /mnt/floppy", you don't see anything even though the directory
"/mnt/floppy/floppy" should exist. That is because "/mnt/floppy/floppy"
doesn't exist as a file or directory, but somehow the system knows that
if you specifically ask for "/mnt/floppy/floppy", it will reroute you
to the floppy drive. 
<p>
Now as to the reason why I didn't combine the floppy drive and cdrom drive
into the same supplementary file. Each definition in the
"/etc/auto.master" file will have its own "automount" program running for
it. If you have several devices running on the same automount program and
one of them fails, it could force the others not to work. That is why
I want every device running on its own automount program which means
there is one device per supplementary file per entry in the
"/etc/auto.master" file.
