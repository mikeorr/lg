   This column is devoted to making the best use of Emacs, text editor
   extraordinaire. Each issue I plan to present an Emacs extension
   which can improve your productivity, make the sun shine more brightly
   and the grass greener.

<h2>Internet-ready!</h2>

<p> You've probably heard the hype about ``Internet-ready'' operating
    systems where you can access the Internet with a click of your mouse.
    Well, users of the customizable <a
    href="http://www.jimpick.com/gnome/ui-proposal/">Emacs user
    interface</a> have had the Net only a keypress away since as early as
    1989!

<p> Emacs has built-in networking capability, which it uses for connecting
    to news or SMTP servers and for web browsing. To illustrate its use,
    here is a bit of code which opens a TCP connection to port 13 of your
    local machine to request the current time&nbsp;:

<pre>
    ;; usage: M-x display-date
    (defun display-date ()
       (interactive)
       (let ((stream (open-network-stream "DAYTIME" nil "localhost" "daytime")))
          (set-process-filter stream 'my-process-filter))
    
    (defun my-process-filter (proc string)
       (message "Current date is %s" (substring string 0 -1)))
</pre>

<p> This code --which assumes you're running inetd-- should display
    something like the format of <code>date</code> in the minibuffer. The
    rich set of primitives and the integrated error management provided by
    Emacs make it easy to program useful utilities; consider how many
    lines of code would have been required to provide the equivalent
    functionality in C.


<h3>Ange-ftp</h3>

<p> <b>Ange-ftp</b> is a package by <a
    href="http://hplbwww.hpl.hp.com/people/ange/">Andy Norman</a> which
    allows Emacs to see the entire Internet as a virtual filesystem. It
    adds remote editing capability by mapping requests for remote files to
    FTP commands. For example, if you ask Emacs to open a file named

<pre>
    /marsden@ondine.cict.fr:~/.emacs
</pre>

<p> then ange-ftp will spawn an FTP process, connect to the host
    <tt>salines.cict.fr</tt> as user <tt>marsden</tt>, CWD to my home
    directory, GET my Emacs initialization file and display the file as if
    it were on your local filesystem. If ange-ftp needs a password it will
    read one from the minibuffer. If you make changes to the file and save
    it, it will be PUT back to the server for you. You can even copy files
    from one remote machine to another by typing <code>M-x copy-file RET
    /user1@host1:/path/to/file1 RET /user2@host2:/path/file2</code>&nbsp;;
    ange-ftp looks after opening two ftp connections for you.

<p> Ange-ftp comes pre-installed with Emacs (XEmacs features <b>efs</b>, a
    complete rewrite by the same author). The only customization you might
    need to make is to configure a gateway, if you don't have direct
    Internet access. You can use <tt>~/.netrc</tt> to configure default
    logins for oft used hosts in the traditional way (and even passwords if
    you're foolhardy).

<p> Perhaps the most elegant feature of ange-ftp is its seamless
    integration with Emacs; the only visible change it introduces is the
    extended filename syntax. Filename completion (by pressing <tt>TAB</tt>
    in the minibuffer) is available on remote hosts in the same way as on
    your local machine. Ange-ftp works well with Dired, the directory
    editor, allowing you to browse though distant machines, operate on
    several remote files at once, etc. It also works with <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/texinfodoc/emacs_14.html#SEC71">bookmarks</a>,
    so you can memorize an interesting spot on your favorite ftp server,
    and jump back to the same spot next week with ease. Take a typical
    usage: ask Emacs to open the following directory (with <code>C-x
    C-f</code> or from the Files menubar)&nbsp;:

<pre>
    /anonymous@ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/
</pre>

<p> You will be presented with a directory listing many different releases
    of Linux kernels (if you have a line like <code>default login anonymous
    password user@site</code> in <tt>~/.netrc</tt> then ange-ftp can infer
    the <tt>anonymous@</tt> for you automatically). Type <code>C-x r
    m</code> to bookmark the location. There's more on bookmarks in Jesper
    Pedersen's <a
    href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue01to08/emacs_mar96.html">article</a>
    in issue 7 of the <i>Linux Gazette</i>.

    

<h3>Web browsing</h3>    

<p> <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html">Emacs-w3</a>
    (also referred to by some as <i>Gnuscape</i>) is a web browser written
    by William Perry in Emacs Lisp. It is fairly sophisticated in certain
    respects, having been the first production browser to support cascading
    style sheets. It understands tables, and can display images inline
    under <a href="http://www.XEmacs.org/">XEmacs</a>, or by invoking
    external viewers when hosted by GNU Emacs. Its author notes that
    Emacs-w3 is yet another reason never to leave the comfort of the One
    True Editor, but to me it serves more as a reminder of the deficiencies
    of Emacs Lisp : it is slow, and has a tendency to block while waiting
    on a slow link (unfortunately Emacs is not multi-threaded, though you
    can set the variable <tt>url-be-asynchronous</tt> to t to reduce this
    annoyance). If you want to try it out get the latest version from the
    <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/elisp/w3/.betas/">betas
    directory</a>, which has many improvements over the version distributed
    on most Linux CDROMs.

<p> <b>browse-url</b> is an nifty Emacs extension which can dispatch
    references to URLs to Mozilla or to Emacs-w3. It does this by using
    Netscape's <a
    href="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/x-remote.html">remote
    invocation protocol</a>, which as a side note even works when you're
    running the browser on a distant machine (the implementation uses the
    X11 inter-application communication protocol). Emacs features its own
    remote control mechanism which lets you send commands to a running Emacs
    (even on another machine), called gnuserv/emacsclient, which I might
    talk about another time.

<p> Recent versions of Emacs are set up to use browse-url in mail and news
    reading modes. URLs should be highlighted when you pass the mouse over
    them, and you can click on them with the middle mouse button to invoke
    your favorite browser. Here's how you can set up browse-url to use
    Mozilla when you're running X11 and Emacs-w3 otherwise&nbsp;:

<pre>
    (if (eq window-system 'x)
        (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-netscape
              browse-url-new-window-p t)
        (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-w3))
</pre>

<p> Another more indirect use of browse-url is <a
    href="http://nwv.www.media.mit.edu/people/nwv/projects/webjump/">WebJump</a>
    by Neil W. Van Dyke. This Emacs plugin provides a programmable hotlist
    of interesting web sites with which to feed your browser. Perhaps its
    most interesting feature is the ability to send a query to Internet
    search engines such as <a
    href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">AltaVista</a> and <a
    href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> without having to load the
    first page of ads, but it also includes features for dispatching
    searches to FAQ and RFC archives, to the <a
    href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary.htm">online Webster</a> or <a
    href="http://www.thesaurus.com/">Thesaurus</a>, or to bring up an
    appropriate page of the Java API. Naturally (this is Emacs) you can
    extend it to include your own favorite sites. You might find yourself
    using it more than your browser's bookmarks.

    
<h3>Files at your Fingertips</h3>

<p> <b>ffap</b> is a powerful package which extends the
    <code>find-file</code> command (the one which prompts for a file name
    in the minibuffer, normally bound to <code>C-x C-f</code>). It searches
    the text around the cursor position for something which might represent
    a filename -- a file in the current directory, a C #included file, a
    newsgroup reference, an ange-ftp style reference to a file on a remote
    machine or an URL -- and prompts you either to open that file, or to
    send the URL to a browser (via browse-url). Once experiencing this you
    quickly get sick of typing filenames into the minibuffer, and may find
    yourself inserting ``hyperlinks'' in strategic places in your files to
    save typing. ffap is distributed with both Emacs and XEmacs; I bind it
    to the F3 key as follows&nbsp;:

<pre>
    (autoload 'find-file-at-point "ffap" nil t)
    (define-key global-map [(f3)] 'find-file-at-point)
</pre>

<p> or if you prefer you can simply override the traditional
    <tt>find-file</tt> by saying

<pre>
    (autoload 'find-file-at-point "ffap" nil t)
    (define-key global-map [(control x) (control f)] 'find-file-at-point)
</pre>

<p> ffap is pretty good at determining interesting filenames; it even knows
    how to recognize RFC names, and from which server they may be obtained.
    It goes to the trouble of pinging remote machines to determine whether
    they are alive, and can naturally be extended to recognize personal
    types of filename references. To conclude on filename shortcuts, you
    might enjoy Noah Friedman's <a
    href="http://www.splode.com/users/friedman/software/emacs-lisp/index.html#fff">fff</a>
    (Fast File Finder) which helps you find files hidden somewhere deep in
    inode-space by querying your <tt>locate</tt> database (part of the GNU
    findutils).



<h2>Feedback</h2>

<p> Several people wrote to me with comments on last month's article on
    <b>jka-compr</b>. <a href="mailto:cbbrowne@hex.net">Chistopher B.
    Browne</a> told me he prefers <a
    href="ftp://archive.cis.ohio-state.edu/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/misc/crypt++.el.Z">crypt++</a>,
    which provides on-the-fly decryption and encryption as well as
    automatic compression and decompression. Whereas jka-compr trusts the
    filename extension, crypt++ reads the first few bytes of the file to
    determine its type. The package also has functions for dealing with
    DOS-style linefeeds which you might find useful if you have to exchange
    files with other operating systems, although you could just as well say
    <code>(standard-display-ascii 13 "")</code>, which simply hides those
    <tt>^M</tt> characters. Crypt++ is not a standard part of Emacs (it's
    not included in the GNU Emacs distribution, though it is bundled with
    XEmacs). I haven't tested its cryptographic capabilities, because

<blockquote>    
    <tt>&lt;POLITICS&gt;</tt> <br>

    As a French citizen I am <a
    href="http://cwis.kub.nl/~frw/people/koops/cls2.htm#fr">prohibited</a>
    from using any form of encryption. In France encryption requires
    authorization from the <a
    href="http://www.elysee.fr/pdt/pdt.htm">President</a>, which is
    accorded only to large military companies and to financial institutions
    (and then only if the keys are held in escrow). These laws are <a
    href="http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9611/0396.html">one
    of the reasons</a> holding back the incorporation of kernel-level
    support for encryption in Linux. Before accusing France of being
    backward, please consider the fact that countries such as Iran, China
    and Russia impose similar restrictions on the freedom of their
    citizens.

    <br> <tt>&lt;/POLITICS&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>

<p> If you're using the latest version of XEmacs (20.3 stable as of this
    writing), the suggestion I make last month for enabling
    <b>jka-compr</b> won't work. The XEmacs maintainers have decided that
    the behaviour of your editor shouldn't be modified by loading an
    extension module, but by calling an appropriate initialization
    function. The correct way of enabling jka-compr is to say
    <code>(toggle-auto-compression 1 t)</code>. Sorry 'bout that, folks.



<h2>Next time ...</h2>

<p> In the next issue I'll review ediff, a powerful interface to diff
    and patch. Don't hesitate to contact me at
    <tt>&lt;emarsden@mail.dotcom.fr&gt;</tt> with comments, corrections or
    suggestions (what's <em>your</em> favorite couldn't-do-without Emacs
    extension package?). <code>C-u 1000 M-x hail-emacs</code> !

<p> <b>PS</b> : Emacs isn't in any way limited to Linux, since
    implementations exist for many other operating systems. However, as one
    of the leading bits of <a
    href="http://earthspace.net/~esr/open-source.html">open-source</a>
    software, one of the most powerful, complex and customizable, I feel it
    has its place in the <i>Linux Gazette</i>.
