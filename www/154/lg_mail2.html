&gt; I have a couple of older FC2 machines running bind DNS. Is there an rpm

&gt;the choice of compiling from source or upgrading the OS?
</pre>

<p>
You need a version of bind9 that is less than 2 months old.  bind8 is
not being fixed.  If Redhat do not have a recent bind9 for FC2 then get
the latest src.rpm and build your own.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively install a small machine running a newer OS with a fixed
DNS server and direct all DNS queries via that machine.  It is only the
final query (the one that hits the outside world) that needs to come
from a fixed DNS server.  Add firewall rules to block DNS queries from
any other machine to the outside world.
</p>

<p>
Also turn off recursion for DNS queries that come from outside your
site and are not for sites in your DNS.  One of the ways that attackers
are getting information is by issuing recursive requests to your DNS
and pointing back at their machines.  If you allow external recursive
requests then it is much easier for an attacker to get information
about your DNS's internal state.
</p>

<p>
Not sure how to turn off recursion for external requests?  See

Again, I'd suggest a direct fix to any suspect nameserver software,
rather than iptables wrapping -- but it's good to know that sharp eyes
are attempting to ensure that the latter approach can also be made
workable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;   
&gt;&gt;How does Linux NAT assign port numbers?
&gt;
&gt;2.6.26 should do random port mapping.  It starts off by trying to
&gt;preserve the original (hopefully random) source port number.  If the
&gt;original source port number is already in use by another NAT entry then
&gt;it should generate a random source port number.  I say "should" because
&gt;the code tests for flag IP_NAT_RANGE_PROTO_RANDOM and a quick check of
&gt;the source did not find anywhere where that flag was set, I'm still
&gt;looking.
</pre>

<p>
Recent kernels should do random mapping but they do not.  I just ran a
test masquerading DNS queries to a small range of source port numbers
and it went sequential <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">.  This has not been fixed as of yesterday's
git patch; a bug report is on its way.
</p>

<p>
Having said that it goes sequential, the fact that masquerade tries to
preserve the original source port number will mitigate against this
bug.  In most cases the original (random) source port number will be
preserved, unless you force the source port into a particular range.

As mentioned on Dan's blog however, there is a work-around that does 
create random source ports:

Subject: [conspire] Kaminsky presentation slides
</pre>
Dan Kaminsky gave his "Black Ops 2008" talk (continuing a series he's
been giving for years at LISA conferences and elsewhere) about two hours
ago at Black Hat, Caesar's Palace, Las Vegas.  No downloadable audio 
file (one very nice thing about LISA conferences) yet, but Kaminsky has 
committed PowerPoint:  <a href="http://www.doxpara.com/DMK_BO2K8.ppt">http://www.doxpara.com/DMK_BO2K8.ppt</a>
</p>

<p>
Major points:
<pre>
0.  Bad guy induces a nameserver to issue queries for 1.foo.com,
    2.foo.com,... and floods it with forged responses delegating the
    query to claimed nameserver (or CNAME alias) "www.foo.com", and 
    trying to race that info back before the genuine response does.  
    Any response that succeeds and gets cached also carries the 
    (unrequested) "ADDITIONAL INFORMATION" datum that the forward-lookup 
    IP of www.foo.com is $EVIL_IP.  That unrequested info then gets 
    cached for a <em>long</em> time-to-live (TTL).  Voila!  Cache poisoning.
    Notice that the forged, malign data is in-bailiwick for foo.com.
1.  There are a huge number of ways to induce "safe" machines behind
    firewalls to ask about hostnames of an attacker's choosing:
    o  Web hyperlinks, with or without Typhoid Marys Javascript, Flash, 
       Java, etc. (though an attack can use those Typhoid Marys to 
       induce severe mischief by inducing reverse-DNS lookups).
    o  Practically any part of an attempted SMTP mail delivery.
    o  Logfiles that do reverse-DNS lookup (e.g., Web servers).
    o  "Web bugs" in documents.
    o  IDS paranoia that makes <em>them</em> do reverse-DNS lookups.
    (Kaminsky talks at length about ways to make this scale, practical,
    and more revealing of details of company-internal networks.)
2.  Making sure UDP source ports are random is a stopgap, as DNS's
    protocol design leaves it pretty unreliable.  (Duh.)
3.  DNS clients (resolver libs) are a little vulnerable <em>if</em> you
    can flood them with fake responses -- but at least don't cache.[1]
4.  Web (etc.) SSL certs don't necesssarily paper over the problem,
    because of dependency on DNS.  (For example:  Did you make your
    browser trust my Thawte cert for example.com?  Cool!
    That means it'll typically also accept my cert for paypal.com
    that has the same signature.  Or, hey, if I can convincingly forge
    paypal.com's DNS, I can register a Thawte certificate for paypal.com
    myself, because I can make the confirmation mails come to me.
    Ditto, almost everyone's "I forgot my password" link trusts DNS
    to some extent.)
5.  Risks also affect some internal networks, for several reasons including
    active internal code and routing that rely on DNS.  (Duh.)
6.  NAT is a sore point.
 
Choice quotation from the first slide:
 
    "-- I found a really bad bug a while ago.
        o   You might have heard of it...."
</pre>

<p>
As usual for a Kaminsky talk, he's also done quite a great deal to trace
out possible ramifications.  Recommended.

Rick,
</p>

<p>
First of all, a huge thank you for posting this very clearly written
report /with prescription/. I'm an expert in some tiny little areas, and
DNS isn't one of them. This is useful to me in quickly getting from poor
safety maybe not to excellent safety but perhaps to "pretty good" safety.
</p>

<p>
I appreciate the sharing tremendously. Rick, you are a guy.

Please don't read this as a complaint, but rather as a caution about
terminology:  Most people reserve the term "DNS resolver" to refer only
to the DNS <em>client</em> piece (the one that on Linux is built into libc and
has conffile /etc/resolv.conf).  Being careful about terminology can
help avoid confusing one's self.

<h3>DNS source port randomisation</h3>

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
Most of you must have heard about Dan Kaminsky's discovery of a flaw
in the DNS protocol and its standard implementation (in glibc and
bind 8).
</p>

<p>
I thought of a quick fix for source port randomisation for DNS
queries using iptables.
</p>

<p>
 <a href="http://www.imsc.res.in/~kapil/blog/dns_quickfix-2008-07-10-17-07">http://www.imsc.res.in/~kapil/blog/dns_quickfix-2008-07-10-17-07</a>
</p>

<p>
Basically, the idea is to use iptables feature of source nat coupled
with source randomisation.
</p>

<pre>
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ! lo -p udp --dport 53 \
    -j MASQUERADE --to-ports 1024-65535 --random
 
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ! lo -p tcp --dport 53 \
    -j MASQUERADE --to-ports 1024-65535 --random
</pre>

<p>
After writing this I realised that the randomisation only works with
kernels version than 2.6.22.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.
