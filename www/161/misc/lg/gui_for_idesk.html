&gt; So, if you're willing to wait a couple of days - our next issue comes
&gt; out on the 1st - you'll have access to a very nice GUI for idesk. As far
&gt; as I know, there isn't one available outside of that.
</pre>

<p>
"idconf" or some such name is what I recall of there being an idesk GUI.

<p>
I've just searched around for 'idconf', and found a very poorly-written
script (e.g., one of the entry fields is labeled 'Comma' - and you're
supposed to figure out that it means 'Command'.) A bit more searching
around turned up a page (<a href='http://fixxxer.cc/blog-en/?p=6'>http://fixxxer.cc/blog-en/?p=6</a>) which lists the
various configurators for 'idesk'; most of them had died (at least,
searching Google produced no results), and most of the rest were pretty
useless.
</p>

<p>
One, however, was interesting: "idesktools" by Vadim A. Khohlov
(<a href='http://icecc.sourceforge.net/idesktools.html'>http://icecc.sourceforge.net/idesktools.html</a>) looks like a neatly-done
Python app with reasonably good functionality which allows you to
configure both your ~/.ideskrc file and to create your .lnk files. I
haven't done much testing on either tool, but they seem usable.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, I prefer my own version; I like being able to select
the icon visually, and none of the other apps give you that option.

Really? 'Cause I usually read code with the assumption that all the
variable names are a 0,5 substring of the noun they represent. Maybe
that's just a byproduct of going through CS courses with a Java
curriculum instead of C++. Those gosh darn kernel hackers are just too
verbose with their comments and descriptive variable naming!

This is really a good option.
I am eagerly waiting to check it once completed.

Good Luck

Sam!!! Nice to see you, even when you're spouting absolute nonsense. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

[ Kat, over my shoulder: "What do you mean, 'even when'?" ]
</p>

<p>
Yeah, Certain People should learn about 'Ctrl-N' in Vim or something
similar. There's nothing illegal or immoral about long varnames, and
given a reasonable programmer's editor, take no more to type than the
short ones.
