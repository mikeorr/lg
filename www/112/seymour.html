<h1>Design Awareness</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/seymour.html">Mark Seymour</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Logorrhea</h3>

<p>Snow is falling outside my window as I write this, so it's still
officially winter. But this month we'll leverage off our winter sports
company logo to discuss the basics of logos and logotypes.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.jpg"
alt="Alpine Gear logo" border="0">

<p>The AlpineGear logo, just to be confusing, is actually a logotype, or a
logo constructed solely from letters or words. We could refer to logotypes
as a subgroup of logos, but there isn't a different word for a logo that's
just an image rather than text, so this system is illogical:

<dl><dt>Logo:<dd>Logo<br>Logotype</dl>

<p>If someone knows of a word that would be more representative than the
"logo:logo" construct, or can make up a good one, let me know.

<p>As I noted in the January column, a pure logo (that
darned<em>logo:logo</em> naming problem again) is an icon, a picture, a
'bug' that communicates the image (and hopefully, if only subconsciously,
the name) of the company without additional words. Companies that sell
products (something that needs to be recognizable at a distance, whether on
a building or a shelf) often use logos, and for companies where instant
recognition (from a freeway at high speed, for example) is important, this
is a defining quality of the mark.

<p>Here are some well-known examples (well, to Linux users, anyway):

<p>
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleAqua.jpg" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/Linux.jpg" alt="" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/Olympics.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="100" width="185">
<img src="misc/seymour/Shell.jpg" alt="" border="0">

<p>Note that the first and last images are capable of communicating the
name of the company (at least to English-speakers, though even in other
languages they'll know what it refers to) to someone who has never seen the
logo before, or may never have heard of the company before. Now
<b>that's</b> good design!

<p>An entire study could probably be done just on logos using various ring images:

<p>
<img src="misc/seymour/Audi.jpg" alt="" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/Mercedes.jpg" alt="" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/Olympics.jpg" alt="" border="0">

<p>Isn't the mind amazing? There's not a name in sight, and yet you
<b>know</b> who these represent, don't you?

<p>Here are some familiar logos that incorporate letters or words into a
logo-shaped image and, while very recognizable (even at a distance), are
neither pure logos or pure logotypes (by my definition, anyway):

<p> <img src="misc/seymour/BMW.jpg" alt="" width="75" height="75"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/CNN.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="155"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/IBM.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="173"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/LG.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="75"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/Virgin.png" alt="" height="75"
width="75" border="0">

<p>Without prior knowledge, of course, you couldn't determine from these
designs that BMW stands for Bayerische Motoren Werke (or that the logo is
derived from a spinning propeller, since BMW really started out as
Bayerische Flugzeug-Werke, making aircraft engines during World War One),
or that CNN stands for Cable News Network, or that IBM stands for
International Business Machines, or especially that LG doesn't stand for
anything (though it's apparently derived from their product lines, two of
which are 'Lucky' and 'Goldstar', and represents the 'Face of the Future').
Virgin, of course, is into so many business segments now (including space
travel) that almost any other logo would be too limiting.

<p>Oftentimes, to provide otherwise obscure name information, the company
will settle on a combination logo/logotype:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Ford.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="181"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/GSK.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="204"
border="0">

<p>But fewer and fewer people know that Henry Ford perfected the assembly
line and made cars cheap enough for the working man to own. (Among car
company names, even fewer people remember the racing career of R.E. Olds,
founder of the Oldsmobile company, let alone the line of trucks by his REO
company.) GSK reportedly paid a million dollars for the 'guitar pick' logo
and then had to settle a suit with the pork producers (not that I'm
implying <b>any</b> similarity, of course, in shape, type style, bleed, or
other graphical aspects):

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Pork.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="92"
border="0">

<p>A logotype is the company name used in a particular typography that,
hopefully, also communicates the image of the company. Here are some recent
examples from the Internet (the Mapquest and Yahoo! logotypes even come
complete with their own punctuation, though I'm never sure if that Mapquest
logo is excited or just sweating):

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AltaVista.jpg" alt="" height="77" width="199"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/eBay.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="70"
border="0"><img src="misc/seymour/Google.jpg" alt="" width="276"
height="110" align="top" border="0"> 

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Mapquest.jpg" alt="" width="384" height="51"
border="0"><img src="misc/seymour/Yahoo.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="44"
border="0">

<p>And, just to be fair (<i>as if</i>; see caveat below), the Gates Empire
logotype and logo/logotype:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Microsoft.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="245"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/Windows.jpg" alt="" height="75"
width="74" border="0">

<p>Here are some more, from various points on the economic compass. These
are designed to work well at different sizes, which is important when
you're using it on everything from signage to small objects or packaging:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Ace.jpg" alt="" width="144" height="75"
border="0"><img src="misc/seymour/Craftsman.jpg" alt="" height="75"
width="333" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/WellsFargo.jpg" alt=""
height="75" width="75" border="0">

<p>The true classic among logotypes, of course, is this one:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/CocaCola.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="217"
border="0">

<p>Along with the trademarked shape of the original glass bottle, it is the
most widely recognized brand symbol in the world. (If a designer were to
emulate it today, including its illegal drug reference and obscure
agricultural product reference and archaic script design, he'd likely be
fired by the client.)

<p>But, even with the best of intentions, sometimes you never know how your
logo is going to end up being used:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/HomeDepot.jpg" alt="" height="75" width="75"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/HomeDepotApron.jpg" alt="" height="75"
width="67" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/HomeDepotRacing.jpg" alt=""
height="75" width="100" border="0">

<p>Companies often can't make up their minds whether they want a logo or a
logotype, and so they end up with a mark that's both (and often doesn't
work well as either):

<p><img src="misc/seymour/BofA.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="230"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/Citizens.jpg" alt="" height="50"
width="180" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/Fandango.jpg" alt=""
width="123" height="50" border="0">  <img src="misc/seymour/Southwest.jpg"
alt="" height="50" width="147" border="0">
<div align="left">

<p>Most of these, like many current logos and logotypes, violate my old
typography instructor's adage about not using all-caps: it's not nearly as
readable, especially in small sizes, as upper and lower case. (Though the
Fandango and Citizens logos try to cheat by using a big leading cap with
the small caps; the late Professor Arnold Bank, bless him, would give them
all a bad grade.)

<p>These four examples show why you should make a choice early on, and get
the client to agree. Remember, as we showed above, the best logos stand on
their own without any text, and the best logotypes don't have any imagery
attached. As Chuco might have said in a graphic designer's cut of <i>The
Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</i>: &quot;If you're going to logo, logo. If
you're going to logotype, logotype&quot;. My sentiments exactly.
<div align="left">

<p>[Caveat for the following: I worked for Apple/Claris for a dozen years,
and still do my own work on a Macintosh. I was even involved for awhile at
Regis McKenna Advertising when Apple barely existed, during the time the
striped logo was born. It took weeks, and many thousands of dollars in
color separations, to determine the exact percentages of four-color-process
used in the now-almost-forgotten rainbow stripes. (And, no, the stripes had
nothing to do with the gay pride movement when they started or when they
ended.) For those interested in the history of these changes, see the <a
href="http://www.kelleyad.com/histry.htm">Kelley Ad site</a> for some of
the earliest work on the Apple logo, along with this list of sites of <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/7588/">Apple
history</a>.]
</div>
</div>

<p>Note that companies like Apple may use a logo in one situation on a
product and a logotype in another situation, but not usually both in
combination; this avoids excessive and sometimes difficult trademarking
requirements (remember to multiply your trademark registration by about 50
for worldwide coverage; see these lists of trademarks from both <a
href="http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/appletmlist.html">Apple</a> and
<a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/library/toolbar/3.0/trademarks/en-us.mspx">Microsoft</a>
for how many logotypes may need to be designed and trademarked for a large
client):

<p><img src="misc/seymour/MacMini.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/iMac.jpg" alt="" height="100"
width="104" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/iWork.jpg" alt=""
height="100" width="80" border="0">

<p>Logos or logotypes may change, due to graphic style changes or market
pressures, during the company's lifetime. The Apple logo is a classic
example:

<p> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleFirst.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="69"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleII.jpg" alt="" height="100"
width="246" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleSerif.jpg" alt=""
height="100" width="240" border="0">

<p>Even when they decided to kill the text portion of the logo and just
concentrate on the fruit, it was redesigned (or at least recolored) many
times over the years:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AppleStripe.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="84"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleRed.jpg" alt="" height="100"
width="84" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt=""
height="100" width="84" border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleWhite.jpg"
alt="" height="100" width="84" border="0"><img
src="misc/seymour/AppleAqua.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="100"
border="0">

<p>Sometimes more than one variant existed at the same time, for differing
uses; the solid red and solid black logos were used alongside each other
for many years, and the white logo appeared at first only on brown
cardboard product boxes. The Aqua logo, of course, ushered in the OS X era,
and engendered an entire new graphic gestalt now used for products and
services totally unrelated to the Macintosh, or even computers.

<p>Other than a trip down memory lane for those Apple fanatics among us (so
sue me; this column is free), what have we learned from this review of
corporate marks about designing logos and/or logotypes?

<p>First off, decide what's important. Is the name of the company (Fred's
Shoes) the most vital information, or is it having brand recognition (Nike)
no matter where the mark appears? If it's the name, consider a logotype. If
it's a universal mark, consider a logo.

<p>Weigh the need to have both a 'bug' and the company name as part of the
design. My own work is often done under the trademark 'Proofmark' for
design jobs or <a href="http://www.proofmark.com">Proofmark Publishing</a>,
and I use a mythological beast as my icon:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/Gryphon.png" alt="" width="100" height="100" border="0">

<p>While my gryphon often sits alongside or atop the Proofmark logotype, it
is not a required part of it. The two pieces can coexist, with different
positioning or scaling as appropriate, or appear separately; this gives my
own corporate identity more flexibility. If, for instance, I was producing
a piece for or sending an invoice to some country or organization that
disliked mythological beasts (and don't think they don't exist), I could
leave it off without having to totally rework all my pieces.

<p>This points out the need to review the scope of the use of the logo. Is
it for Fred's Shoes, and won't be seen outside the circulation of the local
newspaper or the range of the local television station? (You <i>did</i>
think about how it was going to be used in video images, didn't you? Or in
PowerPoint presentations?) Or is it for some multinational corporation
whose products are sold in 172 countries? If it's global, you need to worry
about your logo symbology and how it will be perceived in those markets;
dogs aren't perceived well in certain countries, and other images can
appear either too sacred, like crosses, or too profane, like body parts, in
some cultures. If you're using a name or word, does it translate into
something counterproductive (the famed 'Nova' car from Chevrolet; meaning
'no go', it didn't sell in Latin America for some reason) or downright
obscene in another language?

<p>How many countries your mark will be used in drives how many trademark
applications you'll have to make. (See <a
href="http://www.inta.org/">http://www.inta.org/</a> for help with this.)
Remember, however, that you should protect your marks even in countries
where, for the moment, you're not selling or even planning to sell;
graymarket (quasi-legal) or blackmarket sales can be used to defeat your
trademark in those and other countries. Real words (screwdriver or feather)
are going to be harder to trademark; this is why there's an entire industry
built around naming products with nonsensical or semi-recognizable names.

<p>Then there's scalability and legibility.

<p>Scalability means you can use the mark really big or really small, and
have it be recognizable at either extreme:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="100" width="84"
border="0"> <img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="10"
width="8" border="0">

<p>Don't think you'll ever need it really big? What about when the client
wants it to fill the entire back wall of her store? Or a street-level
billboard? Don't think you'll ever need it really small? Take out your
designer sunglasses and look at the logo or logotype on the inside of the
temples. <b>That's</b> small.

<p>Legibility means the mark is readable against a wide range of
backgrounds; using different color ways can seriously improve legibility,
especially in smaller sizes:

<p>
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleBlack.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleWhite.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleRed.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleRed.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleRed.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="42" border="0">
<img src="misc/seymour/AppleAqua.jpg" alt="" height="50" width="50" border="0">

<p>But there are cases where you, as the designer, will just have to stamp
your pretty little boot-shod foot and insist that, in order for your
precious logo design to work, all underlying screen images, corporate
identity paper, bus stop transparencies, box cardboard, and email
backgrounds will have to represent the color PMS 666. (Just kidding; a cool
designer would specify a Toyo color, right?) 

<p>Insisting that a mark must sit on a specified color has its own
limitations, of course; paper doesn't always come in the right color for a
particular usage (laser printers, box board), and you can't afford to print
four-color-process on every job. It also binds your hands when you're
designing for the Web, as photos and small text don't show well on a
colored background.

<p>Mostly, you should start the design with white as a background; paper
always comes that way, and most electronic media display white as a
default. However, there are going to be times where, for cost or marketing
or political reasons (printing on recycled paper, for instance), you will
have to use your mark on a background that's a color. This is where a
universal mark (if there is such a thing; I can think of situations, like
metallic labels, where almost no color other than black works well) or a
predetermined range of 'legal' logo colors comes in handy.

<p>Font usage has become more critical, as well, since so much corporate
information is now being presented via the Web. Using cross-platform and
cross-browser fonts can reduce how much data needs to be generated as
images and how much can relied on to be in the viewer's font list. (This
column, for instance, is set to display in the generic fonts on your
machine.) Anything that is spec'd for a particular font runs the risk (or
near-certainty) of 'blowing up' on a viewer's computer. Any piece that must
be imported as a graphic image slows down web file transfer, and runs the
risk of printing incorrectly.

<p>Let's analyze our own logo against these criteria:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.jpg" alt="Alpine Gear logo" border="0">

<p>It's a logotype, pure and simple. It will have to be provided
electronically as a PNG or similar format, as few computers will have the
fonts in residence, but it prints well, both in commercial and desktop
forms.

<p>It scales well: <img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.jpg" alt="Alpine Gear logo" height="12" width="58" align="absmiddle" border="0"> but does better small, as do most logos, in one color: <img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGear.png" alt="" height="12" width="58" align="absmiddle" border="0">

<p>We've provided it in several colorways, for good legibility in different media:
<table width="150" border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#999999"><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearWhite.png" alt="" height="30" width="145" border="0"></td>
<td><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearOnBlue.jpg" alt="" height="30" width="145" border="0"></td>
<td><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.jpg" alt="" height="30" width="145" border="0"></td>
<td><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGear.png" alt="" height="30" width="145" border="0"></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>It totally fails as a recognizable mark outside  English-speaking
countries, unless it garners enough familiarity (think Adidas, Nike, Kodak,
Apple, even Microsoft) for that not to matter. Of course, that may be
enough marketplace for even a large company, and people using the Internet
in other countries are used to dealing with English-only websites. (Note,
however, that we provided access on the Landing Page in the February column
to translated pages for  customers in major non-English-speaking markets.)

<p>I hope this has helped you analyze your own logo projects. As ever, let
me know if there's a particular aspect of design you'd like covered.
