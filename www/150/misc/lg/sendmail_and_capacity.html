Hi guys and gals.
</p>

<p>
I have what I thought would be a simple question. How do you figure out how 
many emails sendmail can process and not drive the load average over say 2 or 
3? After much googling around and trying to glean information from the 
sendmail FAQs, etc I am still stumped. I know it depends on hardware 
configuration, the number of mailboxes, how many emails are sent and received 
for a given time frame, etc. But I can't even find a general rule of thumb to 
even get a ball park idea. Can ya help me out?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I am approaching this from the wrong perspective as I realize the 
above statements are most likely way to general to give even a ball park 
answer, though if you could that would be great.

Possibly your problem is constraining your query by system loading:
A mail admin's attitude towards his MTA box tends to be that, if it's
loaded, it's loaded:  As long as the machine keeps up and doesn't fall
over, it really doesn't matter of load hits 50 for long stretches.  That
having been said: 
</p>

<p>
It's quite routine for commodity (but modern) white boxes running
sendmail to be able to send out a couple of _hundred thousand_ SMTP
messages per day before hitting I/O bottlenecks.  Those bottlenecks then
tend to be a result of filling the outbound bandwidth "pipe" to
capacity, not overtaxing the machine.[1]  <em>However</em>, if you really want
to be certain of the machine's ability to handle that level of traffic,
you should expect to spend US $10k per MTA host, and have a very beefy
SCSI (SAS)-based disk subsystem, preferably with a sizeable amount of
local disk cache to keep as much as possible of the outbound queue in
RAM and maxed-out system RAM.  You would also need to consider splitting
the load among multiple hosts, at some point.
</p>

<p>
Last, you'd really be best advised, with that sort of deployment, to
hire one of the houses that do this sort of system design and deployment
for a living.  
</p>

<p>
I hope that helps.
</p>

<p>
[1] That external contraint would be removed if, say, the machine were
used to handle mail only <em>within</em> a high-speed LAN, and not to/from
public networks.  But more-typical sendmail deployments deal with the
Internet, of course.

Thanks and it does help some. At least I know now it is a hard thing to 
determine unless a person is well versed with (in this case) sendmail and has 
a specific set of hardware in mind.
</p>

<p>
So ignoring the size of the pipes and considering mail exchange both ways and 
running sendmail on a AMD X2 4200+ with 4 GB ram. Any ball park idea how many 
emails it could process? I of course mean they arrive and ones are sent at a 
reasonable rate to not overload the box. Or is this type box now considered a 
commodity white box <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

In the context of someone using eyebrow-raising phrases like "ignore the
size of the pipes", I'd call that a commodity white box -- as opposed
to, say, a Sun Fire V890.  Also, if you're talking about that large an
installation, and aren't satisfied with my shirtsleeve figure of a few
hundred thousand messages per day, then the sponsoring organisation can
afford to do a couple of pilot runs for scaling and testing purposes.

Which neatly leads us to Ben's Rule of Bottlenecks: "It's <strong>always</strong> I/O".
Not 100% accurate, but it makes for a good reminder: given how cheap
memory, disk space, or even a new computer is, in most cases by far, I/O
is the most "immovable" limiting factor. It's also a good thing to keep
track of in programming: loading up the CPU or using more memory is
preferable to creating extra network traffic.
</p>

<p>
I recently read a story where a small dental partnership (three offices)
had decided to combine their practices and use a certain software
package, with all the records kept on a single database server. It had
worked fine at one office, but completely froze, everywhere, after the
transition. It seems that the people who wrote the package made the tiny
mistake of doing a 'SELECT * FROM table' (i.e., pulling down the entire
patient database) for <strong>every</strong> *single* <strong>query</strong> and then filtering it
locally... worse yet, since the individual offices now had to integrate
their records into the database, it was doing it for every single
record, times 3.
</p>

<p>
The upshot of the story was that the partnership broke up, with great
acrimony.

Ouch!  That kind of implementation sets PC-based RDMS back about 15
years, to the days of dBase technology, before client-server
technology was adapted to PC server platforms.  I find it incredible
that there are people in the IT field who could be so totally ignorant
and short-sighted.  Then again, it stirs memories of working in
environments where the ends always justifies the means.  In addition,
it has a certain familiarity to methods so often used when the
application is aimed at a mainframe.

I strongly suspect that it was a case of "Works Fine For Me" on a single
system - no matter how stupid the retrieval method, it wouldn't show up
(much) when it was all just going across the local bus. When that was
redirected across a network, however... well, as John Walker of Autodesk
once wrote (I'm misquoting from memory), "Make every part of your
software robust. People will use it for things you never expected and in
ways you never expected."
