<H2>How can I get help on Linux?</H2>
<ol>
<li>Try the help files already in your Linux system
<li>See what reading material is out there
<li>Ask experienced people for help
</ul>

<H3>Try the help files already in your Linux system</H3>

<p>The usual command to ask for a help page on the command line is the
   word <tt>man</tt> followed by the name of the command you need help
   with.  You can get started with <tt>man man</tt>.  It might help you to
   remember this, if you realize it's short for "manual."

<p>A lot of plain text documents about packages can be found in
   <tt>/usr/doc/packages</tt> in modern distributions.  If you installed
   them, you can also usually find the FAQs and HOWTOs installed in
   respective directories there.

<p>Some applications have their own built-in access to help files (even those
   are usually text stored in another file, which can be reached in other
   ways).  For example, pressing F1 in <tt>vim</tt>, ? in <tt>lynx</tt>,
   or ctrl-H followed by a key in Emacs, will get you into their help system.
   These may be confusing to novices, though.

<p>Many programs provide minimal help about their command-line interface if
   given the command-line option <tt>--help</tt> or <tt>-?</tt>.  Even if these
   don't work, most give a usage message if they don't understand their command-
   line arguments. The GNU project has especially forwarded this idea.  It's
   a good one;  every programmer creating a small utility should have it
   self-documented at least this much.

<p>Graphical interfaces such as <tt>tkman</tt> and <tt>tkinfo</tt> will
   help quite a bit because they know where to find these kinds of help files;
   you can use their menus to help you find what you need.  The better ones
   may also have more complex search functions.

<p>Some of the bigger distributions link their default web pages to HTML
   versions of the help files.  They may also have a link to help directly from
   the menus in their default X Windowing setup.  Therefore, it's wise to
   install the default window manager, even if you (or the friend helping you)
   have a preference for another one, and to explore its menus a bit.

<h3>See what reading material is out there</h3>

<P> Check the FAQ.  (Oh, you already are. 
<img src="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=":)">)    
    Somewhat more seriously, there is a Linux FAQ located at
<a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/FAQ/Linux-FAQ.html"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org/FAQ/Linux-FAQ.html</a> which you might
    find to be helpful.

<p>For people who are very new to Linux, especially if they are also new
   to computing in general, it may be handy to pick up one of these basic
   Linux books to get started:

<ul>
<li>Bill Ball's <em>Learning Linux in 24 Hours</em>
<li>Mark Sobell's <em>A Practical Guide to the Linux System</em>
<li>Either <em>Linux Installation and Getting Started</em> or the
	O'Reilly book <em>Running Linux</em>.  They're extremely similar
	so you should only need one of them.
</ul>

<h3>Ask experienced people for help</h3>

<p>Mailing lists exist for almost every application of any note, as well
as for the distributions.  If you get curious about a subject, and don't mind
a bit of extra mail, sign onto applicable mailing lists as a "lurker" -- 
that is, just to read, not particularly to post.  At some point it will make 
enough sense that their FAQ will seem very readable, and then you'll be well
versed enough to ask more specific questions coherently.  Don't forget to
keep the slice of mail that advises you how to leave the mailing list when
you tire of it or learn what you needed to know.

<p>You may be able to meet with a local Linux User Group, if your area has
one.  There seem to be more all the time -- if you think you may not have
one nearby, check the local university or community college before giving up.

<P>And of course, there's always good general resources, such as the Linux
Gazette <img src="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=":)">

<P> Questions sent to <A HREF=mailto:gazette@ssc.com>gazette@ssc.com</A> will
be published in the Mailbag in the next issue.  Make sure your From: or
Reply-to: address is correct in your e-mail, so that respondents can send you
an answer directly.  Otherwise you will have to wait till the following issue
to see whether somebody replied.

<P> Questions sent to <A HREF=../tag/ask-the-gang.html>The Answer Gang</A>
will be read by all the folks in the Answer Gang (some of whom have
<a href="../tag/bios.html">Bio notes</a>) and any answers may be published
in the Two Cent Tips or Answer Gang columns.

<P> If your system is hosed and your data is lost and your homework is due
tomorrow but your computer ate it, and it's the beginning of the month and the
next Mailbag won't be published for four weeks, write to the Answer Gang.  We
get a few hundred slices of mail a day, but when we answer, it's direct to
you.  We also copy the Gazette so that it will be published when the month
end comes comes along.

<P> You might want to check the new 
<a href="../../tag/kb.html">Answer Gang Knowledge Base</a> and see if your question
got asked before, or if the Answer Guy's curiosity and ramblings from a
related question covered what you need to know.
