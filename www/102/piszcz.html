<h1>Benchmarking Filesystems</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/piszcz.html">Justin Piszcz</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>INTRO</h2>

I recently purchased a Western Digital 250GB/8M/7200RPM drive and wondered
which journaling file system I should use.  I currently use ext2 on my other,
smaller hard drives.  Upon reboot or unclean shutdown, e2fsck takes a while on
drives only 40 and 60 gigabytes.  Therefore I knew using a journaling file
system would be my best bet.  The question is: which is the best?  In order to
determine this I used common operations that Linux users may perform on a
regular basis instead of using benchmark tools such as Bonnie or Iozone.  I
wanted a "real life" benchmark analysis.  A quick analogy: Just
because the Ethernet-Over-Power-Lines may advertise 10mbps (1.25MB/s), in real
world tests, peak speed is only 5mbps (625KB/s).  This is why I chose to run my
own tests versus using hard drive benchmarking tools.

       and with 1 user logged in.
NOTE5: All tests were run 3 times and the average was taken,  
       if any tests were questionable, they were re-run and 
       checked with the previous average for consistency.

<h4>REISERFS</h4>

<PRE>
root@p500:~# ./mkreiserfs /dev/hdg1
mkreiserfs 3.6.14 (2003 www.namesys.com)

A pair of credits:
Nikita Danilov  wrote  most of the core  balancing code, plugin infrastructure,
and directory code. He steadily worked long hours, and is the reason so much of
the Reiser4 plugin infrastructure is well abstracted in its details.  The carry 
function, and the use of non-recursive balancing, are his idea.

Lycos (www.lycos.com) has a support contract with us that consistently comes in
just when  we would otherwise miss payroll,  and  that they keep doubling every 
year. Much thanks to them.


Guessing about desired format.. Kernel 2.4.26 is running.
Format 3.6 with standard journal
Count of blocks on the device: 61048992
Number of blocks consumed by mkreiserfs formatting process: 10075
Blocksize: 4096
Hash function used to sort names: "r5"
Journal Size 8193 blocks (first block 18)
Journal Max transaction length 1024
inode generation number: 0
UUID: 8831be46-d703-4de6-abf3-b30e7afbf7d2
ATTENTION: YOU SHOULD REBOOT AFTER FDISK!
        ALL DATA WILL BE LOST ON '/dev/hdg1'!
Continue (y/n):y
Initializing journal - 0%....20%....40%....60%....80%....100%
Syncing..ok

Tell your friends to use a kernel based on 2.4.18 or later, and especially not a
kernel based on 2.4.9, when you use reiserFS. Have fun.

ReiserFS is successfully created on /dev/hdg1.

<h3>BENCHMARK SET 1 OF 4</h3>

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image001.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">In the first test, ReiserFS takes the lead, possibly due to its
balanced B-Trees.  <EM>(If the images are hard to read on your screen, here's
a <A HREF="misc/piszcz/lg-102-piszcz-images.tar.gz">tarball</A> containing
larger versions of them.)</EM>

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image002.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">All of the files systems faired fairly well when finding 10,000
files in a single directory, the only exception being XFS which took twice as
long.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image003.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">Both ext versions 2 and 3 seem to reap the benefits of removing
large numbers of files faster than any other file system tested.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image004.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">To make sure this graph was accurate; I re-benchmarked the ext2
file system again and got nearly the same results.  I was surprised to find how
much of a performance hit both ext2 and ext3 take during this test.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image005.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">Finding 10,000 files seemed to be the same except for XFS;
however directories are definitely handled differently between the tested file
systems.  Oddly enough, ReiserFS takes the largest performance hit in this
area.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image006.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">All of the file systems performed well in this area with the
exception of ext3.  I am not sure what could cause such an overhead for ext3
over all of the other file systems tested.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image007.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">As expected, ext2 wins here because it does not journal any of
the copied data.  As many would suspect, XFS handles large files well and takes
the lead for journaling file systems in this test.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image008.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">This benchmark represents how fast the tar ball can be read
from each file system.  Surprisingly, ext3 matches the speed of XFS.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image009.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">Surprisingly, ReiserFS wins, even over the non-journaling
filesystem ext2.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image010.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">The best journaling file system here is ReiserFS; however, ext3
comes in at a close second.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image011.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">ReiserFS once again surprises everyone and takes the lead; it
appears JFS has some serious issues removing large numbers of files and
directories.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image012.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">Obviously ext2 wins here as it does not need to journal its
copies but XFS is a close second, able to handle large files fairly well.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image013.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">If one must deal with consistently large files, XFS seems to be
the best choice for a journaling file system.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image014.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">Once again on the journaling side, XFS performs well with large
files; however, JFS wins by a hair.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image015.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">This test probably surprised me the most, so much so I re-ran
the test several times and got consistent results each time.  Both ext2 and
ext3 have serious problems splitting files into small pieces, while JFS,
ReiserFS and XFS do not seem to have a problem.

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image016.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">I figured people would ask for this test if I did not do it, so
here it is.  It appears that ReiserFS's balanced B-Tree's allow it to
outperform all tested file systems including ext2!

<P>
<img src="misc/piszcz/image017.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 450px; height: 450px; height: 300px;">
<br clear="all">JFS takes this test benchmark by storm; I was surprised that it
had performed so well.  However, once again dealing with large files, XFS is a
close second.

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<P> For those of you still reading, congrats!   The conclusion is obvious by the
"Total Time For All Benchmarks Test."  The best journaling file system to
choose based upon these results would be: JFS, ReiserFS or XFS depending on
your needs and what types of files you are dealing with.  I was quite surprised
how slow ext3 was overall, as many distributions use this file system as their
default file system.  Overall, one should choose the best file system based
upon the properties of the files they are dealing with for the best performance
possible!</P>

but I primarily used the CLI because xpmac and Gnome/KDE were not quite
complete yet.  Then in 1998 I built a good x86 box, and now use Red Hat

been using Linux every day since then.  I currently run Slackware 9.1 on
