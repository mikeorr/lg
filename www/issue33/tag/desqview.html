>Buying DESQview and/or DESQview/X</H3>
<p><strong>From Larry Herzog Jr. on 19 Sep 1998 </strong></p>

<p><strong>
Do you have any idea where someone can by the final releases of both
Desqview386 and Desqview/X??  
</strong></p>

>Larry,
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
Unfortunately I don't.  If they don't offer it direct from
<a href="http://www.quarterdeck.com/">Quarterdeck</a> (try calling and 
pestering for it via voice line) then I have no idea where you could get it.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
I presume you ask because you found a references to 
DESQview on my web pages.  The fact is that I gave up on 
DV (and MS-DOS in general) about five years ago --- when
I switched to Linux full time.
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
Linux will run on just about any hardware that could support
DESQview/386 --- and it's DOSemu package is just about as
good as DV ever got.  XFree86, the X Windows system
supported by Linux (and the other freenix varieties) is much
more stable and modern than DESQview/X ever was (although I
did like dwm --- their quick little window manager, and
"appman" (applications manager).
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
I think it's a pity that Quarterdeck as done so poorly.
However, I must say I saw it coming.  That's one of the
reasons I left their employ when I did (long before they
gutted the whole department I had been in).
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
I think that the best things that Quarterdeck could do now
are: 
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Release DESQview, QEMM386, the DESQview API
	programming kits etc all under the GPL.
	<em>[I think one of the other Open Source(tm) licenses would
	work fine, too;  for example, the NPL style with Quarterdeck filled
	in as originator. -- Heather]</em>
<li>Encourage <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> 
	(current owners of DR-DOS --- 
	and a major distributor of Linux) to incorporate
	these into their DR-DOS package (which is
	now targeted toward embedded x86 systems)
<li>Release the DV/X sources, dwm and the related 
	utilities.  
<li>Start writing Linux and freenix applications
	--- and adding some professional polish and
	consumer touches to various freeware projects
	and sell collections of these add-ons.
<li>Offer paid Linux telephone support (Quarterdeck
	had the most effective and efficient tech support
	department that I've ever seen or worked with ---
	with the most expeditious and sensible call 
	escalation methodology.  If they haven't
	obliterated that from their corporate memory 
	--- they could <EM>rock</EM>!  I, the Linux Gazette
	&quot;Answer Guy&quot; would call them in a heartbeat
	if they were offering commercial support.
</ul>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
But, alas and alack, it is not likely to be.  
Sorry I can't help you more than that.
