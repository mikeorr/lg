<pre>
&gt;Hi , my name is Jimmy,can anyone help me fix the time on my PC.  I
&gt;change the Battery so many time ,I mean the new CMOS Battery ,but my
&gt;time is still not read correct
</pre>

<p>
 Check the board jumper which reset the CMOS configuration and your
motherboard documentation - this jumper shall not be let in the "reset"
position while operating the computer...
</p>

<p>
 Just a guess.

<p>
Talking about rounding, I almost went crazy to find out why a perl program 
I was writing did not give the right result. Here is the code:
</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
#
$f = 4.95;
$F = (4.8+5.1)/2;
$F_spr = sprintf("%.10f", (4.8+5.1)/2);
 
printf "     f: %32.30f\n", $f;
printf "     F: %32.30f\n", $F;
printf " F_spr: %32.30f\n", $F_spr;
 
if ($f == $F) { print "\n f equals F!\n\n"; }
</pre>

<p>
The test fails even if $f and $F are the same! I solved by using $F_spr 
instead of $F, but it took me a day to find it out... 8-(
</p>

<p>
Ciao, Mauro

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I have a suggestion for the article about the Linux Console Scrollback that
appears in Linux Gazette #143 (October 2007).
</p>

<p>
He talks about the console scoll back function is not enough to see the
kernel messages, also he talks about see the message log that don't have
everything.
</p>

<p>
My suggestion is to mention the "kernel ring buffer" that can be accessed
and manipulated using the command "dmesg".
</p>

<p>
Of course change the size of the scroll back buffer in console has other
uses than to see the output of the kernel boot, but as he gives this as an
example I think is useful to talk about the kernel ring buffer.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>

<p>
Andre

<p>
While the coverage of this topic was generally thorough, there was one 
important point that was missed. If you want to use tar to directly 
split archives, you cannot use compression. If you want a compressed 
archive, you must compress it first then use split to break it into 
appropriate chunks.
</p>

<p>
However, if you do things this way, you must be aware that each chunk 
must be good for you to be able to rejoin them later. For example, if 
you were to split an archive into IG segments to back up to a UDF 
filesystem (until recent kernels there was a 1G limit on UDF files) such 
as a DVD-RAM, you must verify the copies to ensure you will be able to 
restore the original archive later. If one of the segments develops a 
bad sector, you may lose the entire archive.

&gt; Hi!
&gt; I read your post in
&gt; <a href="../135/misc/lg/diagnosing_sata_problems.html">http://linuxgazette.net/135/misc/lg/diagnosing_sata_problems.html</a>
&gt; Did you get your sata drive work?
&gt; I've got these kind of problems:
&gt; <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=591288">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=591288</a>
&gt; Can you give any advices?

<p>
I solved my problems by replacing the SATA card. I'm afraid I can't offer much 
advice. If it was working before you upgraded and you haven't touched the 
hardware then it sounds like software. I'd try a few different live CDs 
(Knoppix, Mint, etc), see which ones work and look at whether there are 
obvious differences, such as modules loaded. That might offer some clues.
</p>

<p>
I've Cced the Answer Gang to see if they can offer any more useful advice.

&gt;    hi brian,
&gt;    Sorry if I am bothering you with this email.
&gt;    This is in connection with your article about winmans in linuxGazette. It
&gt;    was very informative and good. I was struggling with installing fluxbox on
&gt;    RHEL 4.0 and I finally could do it with help of your article.
&gt;    Just that I have not understood what is the purpose of  the following
&gt;    files /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/fluxbox and the
&gt;    /etc/X11/dm/Sessions/fluxbox.desktop.
&gt;     
&gt;    Both have a exec command and I have entered the fluxbox binary only in the
&gt;    fluxbox.desktop file . It is working fine . What is the fluxbox file in
&gt;    gdm/Sessions dir for ?
&gt;    my files look like this :-
&gt;       /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/fluxbox file
&gt;        #!/bin/bash
&gt;        exec /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession FluxBox
&gt; 
&gt;        /etc/X11/dm/Sessions/fluxbox.desktop file
&gt;        [Desktop Entry]
&gt;        Encoding=UTF-8
&gt;        Name=FluxBox
&gt;        Comment=This session logs you into fluxbox
&gt;        Exec=/opt/fluxbox-1.0.0/src/fluxbox
&gt;        Icon=
&gt;        Type=Application
&gt;    I hate to bother you . Hope it is alright and you will help me out in
&gt;    understanding things better.
</pre>

<p>
No problem, Nishith. You're referring to this article, I think:
</p>

<p>
<a href="../108/bilbrey.html">http://linuxgazette.net/108/bilbrey.html</a>
</p>

<p>
I would hazard to guess that /etc/X11/dm is the default display manager
directory, where by default I mean "the place where Red Hat expects to
find display manager session stuff". Then there's directories for the
assorted actual display managers: xdm, kdm, gdm. That's for stock X, KDE,
and Gnome, respectively. But in each of those login manager screens, you
can select which window manager you want to use for that (and optionally
future) X sessions. So in each display manager configuration directory,
there are session files designed to work with that particular display
manager, for each installed Window Manager. So, for instance, if you
installed RHEL4 in kitchen sink mode, with both KDE and Gnome goo, then
you're likely to find these:
</p>

<p>
/etc/X11/
	dm
	xdm
	gdm
	kdm
</p>

<p>
Then, when you install a non-stock RPM of, say, fluxbox, you'll likely
find separate files for that window manager to define a session under each
of those DMs. That they're different (which seems to be your confusion) is
a function of the fact that each is a configuration file for a different
display manager.
</p>

<p>
But all of the others eventually refer back to files in /etc/X11/dm/Sessions
for the setup and startup of the window manager. In one Red Hat box I can
touch, I find /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/GNOME. That invokes
/etc/X11/xdm/Xsession with an argument of "gnome". Looking at Xsession, I
see that ... it leads elsewhere entirely: /usr/share/switchdesk.

Hello,
</p>

<p>
There was a discussion a while ago about Backup Strategies.
</p>

<p>
The enclosed URL points to some pre-strategic thoughts on Backup.
I have not yet used this thinking to formulate a proper Backup plan
that is consistent with it.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://www.imsc.res.in/IMScWiki/WhatIsBackup">http://www.imsc.res.in/IMScWiki/WhatIsBackup</a>

<p>
I have not yet submitted it as an article for LG since the actual
strategy is missing --- what good is theory without a practical
formula?!

<p>
Hello, all
</p>

<p>
In order to clarify a few points, set some issues to rest, and update
the listing of the source code that appeared in "A Question Of
Rounding", the following may be of interest.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I have to state unequivocally that there is no bug. There
never was a bug.  The printf() family of functions completely follow the
letter of both the C99 and IEEE specifications (at least for GLibC).
The matter has been completely explored and put to rest.
</p>

<p>
The issues brought to light in the article are, however very pertinent
to those of us who make a living producing code.  The listing below
addresses some of the real life issues some of us face when having to
deal with floating point arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Please refer to the discussion which follows for an explanation as to
why printf() behaves the way it does, and what this code does to address
some of the problems I highlighted in my article.  The discussion is
also a summary of some of the many points raised in the bug report
discussion, and the information provided to me during that process by a
few very smart people.
