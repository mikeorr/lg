I have a project, sitting here on the desk in front of me, for a menu
program that I need to decide on an implementation language for.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The target environments are SCO OS5 and quite some different number of
Linux distros; the possible languages are Python and Perl.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
While I don't especially care if the buyer can see the code, what I <EM>do</EM>
care about is not putting the installer into either dependency hell or
conflict hell, while still having the pieces I need to do the work.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This seems like a reasonably common problem; any suggestions on how to
approach it?
</STRONG></P>

I suppose that was pertinent, yes; it's a menu program; text, but full
screen.

Who cares what language you'll write it in? ncurses is ported to
Solaris, as is slang. You can probably even use "dialog". All of these
libaries have bindings to lots of languages. As for the "benefit" pffft.
Just use what comes naturally to you.

I apologize; I <EM>thought</EM> I'd made my specific point clear on the first
pass:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
This program, when done, sold and shipped, needs to be able to install
and run reliably on all target platforms without conflicting with, or,
really, depending on, whatever language runtimes might or might not
already be there.  I don't object to depending on what's there, or
brilliant installers, or any of that stuff, but on SCO, I'm likely to
have an ancient Perl and no Python at all...

Ok. So as long as you ensure you compile against a modern glibc, you
should be fine. But what you cannot expect is something near perfect. If
a potential target doesn't have XYZ installed then they should ensure
so. Clearly versions of dependencies &lt;= compiled_version will be OK, and
you can test for that.

and on Linux, you never know <EM>what</EM> will be there -- or what you might
break if you have library/module conflicts.

So, again, going back to Fred Brooks' System Program Product concept
(you know, the thing that takes 9 times as long as a simple hack? 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">,
what is the best approach to this?

	> [Thomas] 
Well, if you do have an antiquated version of XYZ where you know that in
most cases the software on the target machines might well be newer, it
should be a safe [1] approach to assume that the code you have is
"backwards compatible" with what you produced -- i.e. it won't be using
the newer features possibily present.

[1] In theory, great. In practice, err.....

I propose to deploy as a commercial product a program written in a
language which expects an <EM>installed</EM> interpreter, with a system-wide
directory of modules.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If that infrastructure exists, I don't object to using it (assuming
that everything's the right version).  But if it's not there, it's not
my place to install it -- the client isn't buying a-complete-perl-install,
and I don't want to be responsible for that, anyway.

OK. Well, most distributions tend to put things like that in standard
locations (<TT>/usr/share/$foo</TT> || <TT>/usr/lib/$foo</TT>)/ Often, these paths will
have various environment variables defined depending on the platform
you're installing it to, so that is definitely something to check. Of
course <EM>that</EM> depends on the language it is written in.

I know what you mean, time is short. What I really meant by this is
getting a Solaris machine, a linux machine, an HP-UX machine, whatever
and seeing what the differences are to compensate. How else will you
know otherwise?

<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

Because that doesn't take into account what might have already been
done adminstratively to the machine.

Ok.. well, what I would do in that case is rely on the fact that there
are <EM>known</EM> locations for modules or what have you for the said
language. Most distributions follow the LSB or FSH to an extent such
that all packaged versions of the languages should adhere to the agreed
paths. So you can make a default assumption of the <EM>likely</EM> place
they'll be, and if so, use the intended language to test for the
infrastructure of where everthing is (env vars, internal vars to the
language, etc).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If the administrator has been messing around with standard locations,
then he/she should have enough synapses left to know what to do. As a
default though, you could always install in: <TT>/usr/local/</TT> and export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH as necessary, and let the administrator know that if
they know of a better place to put them, to ensure that it is done.
