<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
  I have installed my ipsec tools in my linux-server. I am observing some
issues while testing.
</p>

<p>
These are the steps, i done:
<pre class='code'>
============================
 
   <a href='http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net'>http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net</a> <a href='http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net'>http://ipsec-tools.sourceforge.net</a> for
installation (tar file location)
 
   a. Copy the file *.tar.gz to your linux machine
   b. Untar the file tar xvzf *.tar.gz
   c. Then issue ./bootstrap
   d. Issue ./Configure
   e. Go to src directory. Setkey is installed
   f. Setkey is available in the /sbin directory. so i changed the name and
Copy the setkey directory to /sbin.
   g. Then created set-key file.
 
[root@linux scripts]$ cat set-key
#!/sbin/setkey -f
flush;
 
spdflush;
 
add 10.0.0.1 11.0.0.2 ah 500 -A hmac-md5 0xabcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234;

  h. The issue is, The file has full permission, but it says permission
denied.
 
-rwxrwxrwx  1 root     root 1054 Feb 26 04:44 set-key
[root@linux scripts]$ ./set-key
./set-key: Permission denied.  --------------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ISSUE

We've just released a new language pair, for English to Esperanto,
apertium-eo-en. It's the 27th released automatic translator developped
with the open-source Apertium machine translator engine, the 4th from
English and the 3rd to Esperanto.

Hi all
</p>

<p>
As the subject says, is that assumption true? I asked that because I
am confused whether Linux quota refers to filesystem block or it is
another kind of block?
</p>

<p>
thanks in advance...

In the headers, one notes:

 From: "Serge G." &lt;galabs2000@gmail.com&gt;
</pre>


<p>
So, the headers claim that it came from a typical throwaway GMail
account (though that might be a lie), but in any event the mail somehow
ended up at Canada.com, which is a commerical outfit billed as "Canadian
news, entertainment, television, newspapers, free email and more".  
So, in addition to blacklisting the (alleged) GMail sender, I attempted
to contact "abuse@canada.com" and "postmaster@canada.com", both of which
are RFC-required mail drops for any domain that does SMTP mail.
</p>

<p>
Why?  Because I really don't like having to blacklist entire large mail
concerns, just because one bad apple sneaked abusive mail through.
Those mail drops <em>are</em> the canonical places to get a provider's
attention to exactly such problems.  So, what happened next?
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
  This message was created automatically by mail delivery software. 
 
  A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its 
  recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed:
 
  postmaster@canada.com                                                         
     SMTP error from remote mail server after RCPT TO<img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":&lt;">postmaster@canada.com&gt;:
    host mx1.canada.vsi.net [64.22.133.10]: 550 Mailbox disabled for this recipient - &lt;postmaster@canada.com&gt;                                            
   abuse@canada.com
   SMTP error from remote mail server after RCPT TO<img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":&lt;">abuse@canada.com&gt;:        
    host mx1.canada.vsi.net [64.22.133.10]: 550 Account temporarily suspended   due to inactivity. User must login to reactivate mailbox.                      
</pre>


<p>
So, wow!  They've decided to <em>disable</em> postmaster, and to ignore the
abuse mailbox to the point where the software automatically disabled
delivery.  Well, if they want to completely disregard key RFC
requirements on all SMTP senders -- requirements so key that you need to 
go out of your way to <em>disable</em> them in commodity SMTP software -- then
my server doesn't need to hear from them again.

<p>
Hey Everyone,
</p>

<p>
I am trying to mirror an Invision Powerboard forum locally on my system 
(With permission from the admin) using wget and I am having issues.
</p>

<p>
When I start downloading wget visits each and every link and makes a 
local copy (like its supposed to) but in this process it also visits the 
"Log out" link which logs me out from the site and then I am unable to 
download the remaining links.
</p>

<p>
So I need to figure out how to exclude the Logout link from the process. 
The logout link looks like: www.website.com/index.php?act=Login&amp;CODE=03
So I tried the following:
</p>

<pre>
wget -X "*CODE*" --mirror --load-cookies=/var/www/cookiefile.txt 
<a href='http://www.website.com'>http://www.website.com</a>
</pre>

<p>
but it didn't work.
</p>

<p>
I can't exclude the index.php itself because all the links are based off 
the index.php with parameters.
</p>

<p>
I have tried searching the web but didn't find anything relevant.
</p>

<p>
Any ideas on how to do it?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

<p>
Suramya

In SUSE Linux Unleashed (pub 2005) on p20, there is a listing for Groups

   Ben;
</p>

<p>
   I read a post of yours on mass emailing on Linux Gazette -- I found the
   post since I was looking for information on mall emailing in Linux.  Since
   we have a small gourmet foods shop in New Jersey and have compiled a
   customer list of nearly 1000 emails, we figured we'd use it to announce a
   sale and specials; nothing nefarious about our intentions.  It turns out
   kmail and evolution aren't well-suited to the task, a significant
   proportion of emails have been changed (earthlink/mindspring -&gt;
   embarqmail), mistyped into the database, or have simply been abandoned; we
   got about a 15% bounce rate.
</p>

<p>
   I imagine a good mass mailer would have hooks for database import (MySQL
   on a LAMP server) and have a means for "fixing" the database based on
   bounces and "UNSUBSCRIBE" requests.

"tag@lists.linuxgazette.net" has never been the address of Jim Dennis.
It's always been the address of The Answer Gang, a public mailing
list associated with _Linux Gazette_ magazine.  Jim Dennis was for a
very long time a member of that mailing list, but hasn't been subscribed
for some years.
</p>

<p>
You might have gotten a clue about it being a mailing list from the word
"list" as the hostname, by the way.
</p>

<p>
Please make sure you excise "tag@lists.linuxgazette.net" from all of
your records as a means of reaching Jim:  I simply never <em>was</em> that, and
isn't now.
</p>

<p>
What you just did is the Internet equivalent of walking into a crowded
cinema during a movie and yelling out "Hi, I heard Jim Dennis might be
here.  I want to talk to him about a job opening."

Hi

<p>
When I am writing to my disk every now and again, the machine stops
responding for a period.  When I look in syslog I see messages like this

<p>
So far this appears to cause the hard drive to collect errors and
eventually for filesystem corruption to occur.
</p>

<p>
Has anyone seen this sort of thing before and are you able to shed any
light on what might be happening.
</p>

<p>
This has been on going for a while now, and I have tried different
drives and different cables.
</p>

<p>
Although it may not be immediately obvious its using SATA
</p>

<p>
Thanks

Is anyone of you using idesk presently ?

I have no idea about its present status. Is there any GUI available to 
configure the .lnk file and .ideskrc ? In my debian lenny apt shows only the 
idesk itself. 
</p>

<p>
I would by happy if there is any GUI ( preferably .deb ) which can configure

Hi,

<p>
I saw that you had some trademark info at <a href='http://www.lg.ps.pl/issue97/TWDT.html'>http://www.lg.ps.pl/issue97/TWDT.html</a>.  I don't know if you also have any interest in patents, but if so I wanted to suggest that you check out <a href='http://www.freepatentsonline.com'>http://www.freepatentsonline.com</a> and <a href='http://www.sumobrain.com'>http://www.sumobrain.com</a>

They are by far the best free patent searches on the web, and trademark data will shortly be added to them as well.

<p>
Hello everyone!
</p>

<p>
A student here brough to me a problem i couldnt solve, so i'm
forwarding it to tag.
</p>

<p>
After an hibernation, his laptop froze and he had to do a
hard-shutdown on it, and after that ubuntu stopped booting, giving him
this kernel panic message:
</p>

<pre>
[ 2.222518] Kernel panic - not sycing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on
unknown-block(0,0)
</pre>

<p>
After a few trys, he noticed that he can boot into other kernels he's
got on his machine, but they don't work properly (weird beeps,
auto-mount doesnt work, compiz - that kind of stuff)
</p>

<p>
Heres some messages:
<pre>
Mounting something without su:

Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply,
the message bus security policy blocked the reply,
the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.

/usr/bin/metacity
</pre>

<p>
--- Then several of the above errors ---
</p>

<p>
I checked his menu.lst, and heres the entry for the problematic kernel:
<pre class='code'>

splash
initrd		/boot/initrd.img-2.6.27-11-generic
quiet
</pre>

<p>
I noticed that weird root=UUID= on kernel, and changed it to
root=/dev/sda2 UUID=**** but it didnt work
</p>

<p>
Well, this is all for now - thanks for reading

I am concerned that despite the Conficker affair, the message about using
   Ubuntu isn't getting through especially to industry commentators. So I
   wrote to Mark Shuttleworth.
</p>

<p>
   Dear Mark Shuttleworth,
</p>

                                Marketing Ubuntu
</p>

<p>
   I am still delighted with Ubuntu, and believe me after using computers for
   40 years, it's quite the best OS/package I've ever come across.
</p>

<p>
   But the message isn't getting out there. I became aware how bad it was
   when I did a single word Google News search for 'Conficker'.
</p>

<p>
   You and I know that if only we could get people to put Linux on their pcs
   their malware problems would vanish. But that message is not getting
   through.

Hello,

<p>
 I have read the article of yours from
<a href='../136/anonymous.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/136/anonymous.html</a> . Sounds interesting and it was
very informative too. Thanks for sharing it.
</p>

<p>
I have a requirement, i need a device driver program which reads ctrl
+k, this key sequence will send a SIGUSR1 signal to another
application program which will just do a multiplication or sort of few
numbers once its recieve the SIGUSR1 signal.
</p>

<p>
We have written the application program, which is pretty easy though. Now in
need of a device driver program which reads ctrl + m and send SIGUSR1
signal.
</p>

<p>
I will be really thankful if you could help me in this.

<p>
Greetings:
</p>

<p>
I ran into some problems while searching for portions of words in one
of my indexes.  If the word "workstation" was present, I wanted to be
able to search for (say) "orksta" without getting 0 hits.  I can use
substrings like leading or trailing asterisks in a command-line search
by adding the "-sf" option:
</p>

<pre>
  me% estcmd search -sf -vu -max 40 $db/srch "$pattern"
</pre>

<p>
I'd rather avoid the wildcard stuff when doing a browser search using
estseek.cgi, and I found that adding a synonym list works really well.
To build a wordlist for synonyms, run "estcmd words" on your search index:
</p>

<pre>
  me% estcmd words srch | awk '{print $1}' | sort -u &gt; /path/to/synonyms
</pre>

<p>
Here are the changes to estseek.conf:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
   1  # phraseform: specifies the phrase form.  "1" is usual form, "2"
   2  # is simplified form, "3" is rough form, "4" is union form, "5"
   3  # is intersection form.
   4  phraseform: 2
   5  
   6  # candetail: specifies whether to enable detail display of a
   7  # document.  "true" or "false".
   8  candetail: true
   9  
  10  # candir: specifies whether to enable directory display of a
  11  # document.  "true" or "false".
  12  candir: true
  13  
  14  # If you want query expansion, enable an outer command by editing
  15  # qxpndcmd in estseek.conf.  It specifies the absolute path of
  16  # a command which outputs synonyms of a word specified by the
  17  # environment variable "ESTWORD".
  18  qxpndcmd: /usr/local/share/hyperestraier/filter/myxpnd
</pre>

<p>
Here's the expansion script "myxpnd":
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
   1  #!/bin/ksh
   2  # myxpand: list synonyms
   3  
   4  # set variables
   5  LANG=C ; export LANG
   6  LC_ALL=C ; export LC_ALL
   7  PATH="/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin" ; export PATH
   8  
   9  # show help message
  10  case "$1" in
  11      --help) echo 'List synonyms of a word'; exit 0 ;;
  12      *)      ;;
  13  esac
  14  
  15  # list synonyms
  16  exec fgrep "$ESTWORD" /path/to/synonyms
  17  exit 0
</pre>

<p>
Here's part of a search form that works:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
  &lt;form method="get" action="estseek.cgi"&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="phrase" value="" size="20" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="phraseform" value="2" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="perpage" value="10" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="qxpnd" value="1" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="hidden" name="navi" value="0" /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Search" /&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;

Hi,

<p>
I came across a post at

said that
</p>

<p>
"AllowTcpForwarding Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted. The
default is "yes". Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve
security unless users are also denied shell access, as they can always
install their own forwarders."
</p>

<p>
I was just experimenting around with tunneling and as to how to block it.
Please could explain to me how one can install their own forwarders if ssh
tunneling is blocked, or the name of such a forwarding software?

Thanks,

<p>
Hello
</p>

<p>
   Thanks for the article.  I'm attempting to make this work with the 64 bit
   version of Ubuntu server 8.10 and the 64bit version of vmware server
   2.0.   The install went fine but I cannot access the vmware console on the
   IP of my ubuntu server on port 8222?    I know it's alive on my network as
   it accessed packages from the internet and I have a windows server file
   share mounted.    Any Idea's what to check?  Thanks
</p>

</p>

<p>
Here's a follow-up to my 2005 article "WSGI Explorations in Python"
(<a href='../115/orr.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/115/orr.html</a>).  Michael Will asked me what
had happened since then, so I wrote this:
</p>


<p>
There is no state-of-the-Python-web overview that I know of, but a lot has
happened since I wrote that article.  Pretty much all new frameworks
are written for WSGI, and the older ones have been retrofitted.
(CherryPy can run as a WSGI server, Plone can run as an application,
parts of Zope have been extracted to independent Repoze components,
and Quixote has a WSGI gateway floating around somewhere.)  Django
works with WSGI sort of, and has been ported to Google App Engine via
WSGI.
</p>

<p>
I'm involved with Pylons, a framework that's fully WSGI and modular to
the core, built on top of Paste, which is a low-level WSGI library.
TurboGears 2 is being built on top of Pylons.  This means that
different frameworks with different goals and target users can share
the same technology, and essentially makes every TG developer a Pylons
developer, doubling our developer base.
</p>

<p>
There's a group of WSGI framework developers including
Pylons/TG/Repoze.BFG developers that is designing a new framework to potentially
supercede all of them, with plug-in personalities to reflect their
different application styles.  This is still at the idea stage but may
have some alpha code by the end of the year.  If so it could point the
way to the next generation of frameworks.
</p>

<p>
Another big issue is Python 3.  Over the next year frameworks will
either be ported to Python 3 or replaced by frameworks written for
Python 3.  (Though the Python 2 frameworks may continue in use for
several years.)  This has to be done on a dependency basis; e.g.,
Pylons can't upgrade until all the components it depends on have
upgraded.

<p>
Just ran across Yet Another Proprietary Format from Micr0s0ft: .mht
files. Seems that Internet Explorer saves emails and HTML as an ugly
mess that somewhat resembles an email; according to Wikipedia, there's
no single standard, and the state of the state is best described as
'sauve qui peut' (which translates, at least in Redmond, as "all your
ass are belong to me!") Bleh.
</p>

<p>
Searching the Web shows that there are a lot of people - the
just-converted-to-Linux newbies, particularly - who have loads of these
things and don't know what to do with them. Some people recommend Opera
(I <strong>suppose</strong> a couple of hours of Kiri Te Kanawa is good for relieving
all kind of stress...); some have had luck with various conversion
utilities. I looked at it, and it looked something like a mangled email
header, soooo...
</p>

<p>
I didn't go searching for more than just the one file that I had, but
here's what worked fine for opening it:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# Convert line-ends to Unix format
flip -ub file.mht
# Prepend a standard 'From ' mail header to the file
sed -i '1i\'"$(echo From $USER $(date))" file.mht
# You should now be able to open it with your favorite MUA
mutt -f file.mht
</pre>

<p>
It worked fine for me.

Not very Linux related, but this is a nice tip anyway.
</p>

<p>
If you use a future mail page (like <a href='http://www.futureme.org/'>http://www.futureme.org/</a> ) in
conjunct with a email to sms gateway (you can get a list here:
<a href='http://www.mutube.com/projects/open-email-to-sms/gateway-list/'>http://www.mutube.com/projects/open-email-to-sms/gateway-list/</a> ), you
can send reminders in a free, fast way, directly to your cellphone
(and futureme doesnt even need you to signup for an account)

You may not be aware of this, but TrueType files can be viewed with the

This will, of course, fail if the file is called something like

double-quote variables used as arguments.

Um... wrong tool for the job, I'm afraid. A "while" loop is a
state-tester (i.e., checks for true/false and loops); the "for" loop is
an iterator, which walks ("iterates") over a list of arguments - which
is the exact requirement here.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# Loop over the list of all command-line arguments
for f
do
	/usr/bin/convert "$f" "$f.jpg"
done
</pre>

<p>
...but since it's really a one-liner, I would just tend to type things
like
</p>

<pre>
for f in *ttf; do convert "$f" "$f.jpg"; done
</pre>

<p>
right on the command line. It's not much harder to remember than yet
another script name. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
If you're administering a Linux system with SELinux policy being
enforced, you'll know that most of the times you need to set security
context of certain files/directories so it can be properly accessed by
daemons or users.
</p>

<p>
If the task is something like "I create new directory /var/apache/html
to put HTML files for my new Apache virtual host", you should make
security context of /var/apache/html exactly like /var/www/html
(assuming it is the default DocumentRoot of Apache). This command does
that for you:
</p>

<pre>
# chcon --reference=/var/www/html /var/apache/html
</pre>

<p>
For additional information, chmod and chown also employ the same
option too. e.g:
<pre>
# chmod --reference=/var/www/html /var/apache/html
</pre>
makes the access permissions on both directories exactly the same.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I've written hundreds of scripts to help me with various
tasks. Many of them are still very useful - but whether my memory isn't
what it used to be (hmm... I wonder if I can write a script to fix
that...), or whether that's just too many things to keep in my head,
I've often found myself searching and cursing when I couldn't find the
script that I needed and <strong>knew</strong> I'd already written. Too many scripts!
</p>

<p>
To deal with this, I've started copying something that I already do
elsewhere. When I teach, I give my students a group of scripts that I've
made up for each class - and in each of these scripts, I insert an
explanatory comment on line 3 (1 is the shebang, while 2 is a comment
containing the author credit and a timestamp.) I try to come up with
keywords that will be obvious even if I can't remember what I wrote
originally. I also include a 'README' script which reports the third
line of every file in the directory. There's even a method for ignoring
files and adding your own descriptions (do try to avoid the latter, for
obvious reasons.)
</p>

<p>
So, all you need to do is get in the habit of commenting your scripts in
clear and obvious ways on the third line. Once you've done that, this
little script will save you much time and frustration. Enjoy!

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat and Redmond to Extend Virtualization Interoperability</h3>

<p>Red Hat announced in February that in response to strong customer 
demand, it has signed reciprocal agreements with Microsoft Corporation 
to enable increased interoperability for the companies' virtualization 
platforms. Each company will join the other's virtualization 
validation/certification program and will provide coordinated 
technical support for their mutual server virtualization customers. 
Other than for testing and certification, no funds will be exchanged.</p>

<p>With the efforts being undertaken today through this announcement, Red 
Hat and Microsoft customers will have the ability to run Microsoft 
Windows Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual servers on either 
host environment with configurations that will be tested and supported 
by both virtualization and operating system leaders.</p>

<p>The key components of the reciprocal agreements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Hat will validate Windows Server guests to be supported on 
Red Hat Enterprise virtualization technologies.</li>
<li>Microsoft will validate Red Hat Enterprise Linux server guests 
to be supported on Windows Server Hyper-V and Microsoft Hyper-V Server.</li>
<li>Once each company completes testing, customers with valid 
support agreements will receive coordinated technical support for 
running Windows Server operating system virtualized on Red Hat 
Enterprise, and for running Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualized on Windows
Server Hyper-V and Microsoft Hyper-V Server. </ul>

<p>The agreements establish coordinated technical support for Microsoft 
and Red Hat's mutual customers using server virtualization, and the 
activities included in these agreements do not require the sharing of 
IP. Therefore, the agreements do not include any patent or open source 
licensing rights, and additionally contain no financial clauses, other 
than industry-standard certification/validation testing fees.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Moonlight Now on the Linux Desktop</h3>

<p>Novell released in February the first open source implementation of 
Microsoft's Silverlight media framework: Moonlight 1.0.</p>

<p>The first and only open source project that provides Linux users 
access to Microsoft Silverlight content, Moonlight demonstrates 
Novell's commitment to making Linux a first-class platform for 
multimedia and Rich Internet Applications. Moonlight provides the 
platform Linux users need to use Silverlight and Windows Media 
content. In combination with Banshee, a Novell-sponsored project to 
produce an open source media player, Moonlight is part of a complete 
multimedia solution on Linux.</p>

<p>Available for all major Linux distributions, including openSUSE, SUSE 
Linux Enterprise, Fedora, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, Moonlight is in part a 
result of the existing technical collaboration between Microsoft and 
Novell that extends interoperability between Windows and Linux. 
Windows Media Video (.wmv), Windows Media Audio (.wma), and MP3 files 
are supported through the Microsoft Media Pack, a Microsoft-delivered 
set of media codecs that brings optimized and licensed decoders to 
every Linux user using Moonlight. Additionally, it allows developers 
to write Rich Internet Applications for multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Moonlight has already proven useful to tens of thousands of Linux 
users. A pre-release of Moonlight was delivered on January 19, 2009 to 
allow Linux users to stream Barack Obama's Inauguration. More than 
20,000 Linux users downloaded Moonlight to watch the Silverlight 
broadcast.</p>

<p>"Moonlight brings the benefits of Silverlight's popular multimedia 
content to Linux viewers,"said Miguel de Icaza, Mono project founder 
and Developer Platform vice president at Novell. "This first release 
delivers on the goal of breaking down barriers to multimedia content 
and creating parity in the user's viewing experience regardless of 
whether the user is on Windows or Linux."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Establishes Open Source Storage Encryption Standard</h3>

<p>This past February, Sun Microsystems released the first generic communication 
protocol between a key manager and an encrypting device into the open 
source community. This allows better management of encrypted keys and 
can avoid licensing fees for proprietary encryption schemes. The 
protocol is implemented as a complete toolkit and is downloadable from 
the OpenSolaris website: 
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/kmsagenttoolkit/">http://opensolaris.org/os/project/kmsagenttoolkit/</a>.</p>

<p>By releasing the Sun protocol as Open Source, Sun is taking steps 
towards unifying the technology. Sun continues to work with partners 
and with appropriate standards bodies such as IEEE 1619.3 Working 
Group and OASIS to further develop and formalize the interface as an 
industry standard. RSA is currently developing a solution using this 
protocol to work with their RKM key manager. IBM's drive division is 
working on supporting this protocol for their IBM LTO4 drive shipped 
in Sun Libraries. Additionally, Sun has shared this protocol with 
numerous other industry partners including computer OEMs, back up 
application providers, disk array and switch manufacturers.</p>

<p>Governments, finance, healthcare, retail, and other vertical markets 
need to comply with current regulatory laws that create mandates to 
protect sensitive stored data. To support these requirements, this 
protocol is available to customers using the Sun StorageTek KMS 2.0 
Key Manager and Sun StorageTek Enterprise Drives and Sun StorageTek 
LTO4 drives shipped in Sun libraries. A number of additional partners 
are developing products based on this protocol, including EMC, whose 
RSA security division has talked about releasing it as an option on 
their RKM Key Manager.</p>

<p>"Open Storage solutions allows customers to break free from the chains 
of proprietary hardware and software and this new protocol extends 
this lifeline into the expensive and highly fragmented encryption 
market," said Jason Schaffer, senior director, storage product 
management, Sun Microsystems, Inc. "Open source equals customer value 
for encryption solutions and Sun now offers the only solution on the 
market that works across multiple vendors and suppliers."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM Petaflop Supercomputer Europe's Most Powerful</h3>

<p>The German research center Forschungszentrum Juelich has selected IBM 
(NYSE: IBM) to develop the first supercomputer in Europe capable of 
one Petaflop, or one thousand trillion operations per second. IBM will 
partner with Juelich-based Gauss Centre for Supercomputing to install 
the new IBM Blue Gene/P System in the first half of this year.</p>

<p>This new system - financed by the German Government - will help assure 
Forschungszentrum Juelich remains one of Europe's most renowned 
research centers and continues to play an important role in the global 
high performance computing research community.</p>

<p>This new Blue Gene System is the first to include new water cooling 
technology, created by IBM Research, that uses room temperature water 
to cool the servers. As air moves through the server racks, heat is 
removed as it passes through the water-based cooling system before it 
enters the next rack of servers. This result is a 91 percent reduction 
in air conditioning units that would have been required to cool 
Forschungszentrum Juelich's data center with an air-cooled Blue Gene.</p>

<p>"With speeds over a Petaflop, this new Juelich-based supercomputer 
offers the processing ability of more than 200,000 laptop computers," 
explains Professor Thomas Lippert, lead scientist of the Juelich 
supercomputing center. "In addition to raw power, this new system will 
be among the most energy efficient in the world."</p>

<p>The new Blue Gene/P System will include nearly 295,000 POWER 
processors in 72 racks and also include over 144 terabytes of memory. 
It will significantly add to Forschungszentrum Juelich's existing 
supercomputing capability at the Center, which includes an additional 
six petabytes of hard disk drive space, the amount equivalent of more 
than one million DVDs.</p>

<p>Inauguration and naming of the new systems will take place at an 
opening ceremony in mid-2009. The new supercomputer will be the first 
for the German Gauss Center for Supercomputing (GCS).</p>

</p>

<p>The Cuban News Agency reported that the NOVA operating system and 
other free technologies are aimed at inexpert users or at those who 
are currently migrating to this Linux-based software programs from 
Windows. According to reports from Reuters, Cuban ministries are also 
concerned about security for the Windows-based computers they already 
have and believe US intelligence agencies have backdoor access to many 
of the Windows applications.</p>

<p>The NOVA OS, developed by the University of Information Technologies 
(UCI) in Havana, was one of the 23 Cuban products on display at the 
13th I.T. Convention and Fair. The NOVA team is based at the 
University and offers technical support, security patches and software 
updates.</p>

<p>There are over 1 million computer users in Cuba and currently about 
20% use Linux.  With the adoption of NOVA, the government there hopes 
exceed 50% Linux usage in 5 years.</p>

<p>This year's I.T. Convention was divided into two parts. The first 
consisted of a scientific event with 80 lectures, mainly by delegates 
and representatives from international organizations and institutions. 
The second was an exhibition with the participation of more than 140 
Cuban and foreign entities.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intrahealth Open Initiative to Fund Open Source Training for Health 
Workers in Africa</h3>
<p>IntraHealth OPEN is a global initiative that engages African 
technology, health leaders and students to develop and sustain 
software applications tailored to meet urgent health care needs. The 
project will strengthen African health professionals' ability to 
identify and implement appropriate technology solutions that make 
health services more cost-effective and accessible.</p>

<p>IntraHealth International has a global leadership role in developing 
and implementing open systems to support accessible, high-quality 
health care in Africa and on introducing systems to better plan and 
manage the healthcare workforce in Africa. IntraHealth currently has 
open source initiatives under way in nine countries in Africa.</p>

<p>IntraHealth International is partnering with Grammy Award-winning 
artist Youssou N'Dour on a charity album titled "OPEN Remix" 
benefiting a new initiative created to address critical health issues 
in Africa by putting the latest open source software technologies 
directly in the hands of health workers.</p>

<p>Nas, Duncan Sheik and Peter Buck of R.E.M. are among the headliners 
donating remixes of N'Dour's song "Wake Up" to raise funds and 
visibility for the IntraHealth OPEN Initiative.</p>

<p>Starting February 11th and rolling through Spring, free downloads of 
the songs will be available with a suggested donation through 
distribution partners including Rhapsody, iLike, Amazon MP3, and 
through IntraHealth's website at <a href="http://www.intrahealth.org/open">http://www.intrahealth.org/open</a>.</p>

<p>With growing connectivity and mobile phone use increasing at twice the 
global rate, Africa can take advantage of cutting edge eHealth 
technologies. Open source technology is ideally suited for application 
in low-resource environments since it is inexpensive, flexible, and 
collaborative.</p>

<p>IntraHealth has been collaborating with African governments and 
private institutions to design and apply open source solutions to 
strengthen their ability to use health information for strategic 
health policy and planning. Using web-based interfaces, mobile phones 
and PDAs, open source software systems can provide far-reaching and 
innovative tools to support increased efficiency, productivity, and 
performance of health services and information to meet the needs of 
families and communities across the continent.</p>

<p>To help shepherd its growing initiative, IntraHealth has assembled an 
OPEN Council made up of supporters and leaders in the fields of 
entertainment, technology, and public health. The OPEN Council members 
include recording artists and representatives from VH1, MTV Europe 
Foundation, ONE, Wikia, AEG Live, Rhapsody. iLike, Bowery Presents, 
Indaba Music, Tech Soup Global, Red Hat, inSTEDD, The Linux 
Foundation, GNOME Foundation, Creative Commons, Open Source Software 
Institute, OSU Open Source Lab, O'Reilly Media, Motorola, Novell, 
Brightkite, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, D-Tree 
International, Ushahidi, the Center for Children and Technology and 
Reseau Africain de L'Education Pour La Sante. The group is seeking 
funding and partners to help expand the program.</p>

the initiative

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Released</h3>

<p>The Debian Project has released Debian GNU/Linux version 5.0 
(codenamed "Lenny") after 22 months of development work. Debian 
GNU/Linux is based on the 2.6.26 Linux kernel and supports a total of 
twelve processor architectures including Intel and AMD (both 32bit and 
64bit), PowerPC, HP PA-RISC, MIPS, ARM and IBM S/390 platforms.</p>

<p>Live CD, USB images, CD, DVD and newly added Blu-ray disc images are 
available to download, via FTP, HTTP or BitTorrent.</p>

<p>Debian 5.0 includes the KDE, GNOME, Xfce, and LXDE desktop 
environments. It also features compatibility with the FHS v2.3 and 
software developed for version 3.2 of the LSB.</p>

<p>Debian 5.0 "Lenny" adds support for Marvell's Orion platform which is 
used in many storage devices. Additionally, "Lenny" now supports 
several Netbooks, in particular the Eee PC by Asus. "Lenny" also 
contains the build tools for Emdebian which allow Debian source 
packages to be cross-built and shrunk to suit embedded ARM systems.

software packages (built from over 12,000 source packages).</p>

<p>With the integration of X.Org 7.3, the X server autoconfigures itself 
with most hardware. Newly introduced packages allow the full support 
of NTFS filesystems and the use of most multimedia keys out of the 
box. Support for Adobe Flash format files is available via the swfdec 
or Gnash plugins. Overall improvements for notebooks have been 
introduced such as out of the box support of CPU frequency scaling.</p>

<p>Further improvements in system security include the installation of 
available security updates before the first reboot by the Debian 
Installer, the reduction of setuid root binaries and open ports in the 
standard installation, and the use of GCC hardening features in the 
builds of several security-critical packages.</p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Gives GlassFish Portfolio Integrated LAMP Stack</h3>
<p>Sun announced in February its Sun GlassFish Portfolio, an open source, 
high-performance Web platform, based on its GlassFish application 
server.</p>

<p>Built on leading open source projects - including Apache Tomcat, Ruby, 
PHP, Liferay Portal and GlassFish - the Sun GlassFish Portfolio 
packages these components into a complete, pre-integrated and 
fully-tested open source platform. This includes a packaged version of 
what was the WebSynergy project - Sun's portal software combined with 
LifeRay's portal.  It is now
available as Web Space portal, a partnered product. Web Space portal 
allows uses to create their own spaces for collaboration and social 
networking and is viewed as a FOSSw alternative to products like 
Sharepoint. The FOSSw version of Web Space is available at 
<a href="https://portal.dev.java.net/">https://portal.dev.java.net</a>.</p>

<p>"Companies are under huge pressure to do more with less, and more and 
more frequently they are turning to scalable, supported open source 
technologies," said Mark Herring, vice president, Software 
Infrastructure, Sun Microsystems. "With GlassFish Portfolio, Sun is 
providing customers with the highest-scaling, highest performance and 
lowest cost, open source platform. Companies developing Web 
applications with the Sun GlassFish Portfolio can expect to deploy 
quickly, see a seven-fold improvement in application 
price/performance at only 10 percent of the cost - over 
proprietary offerings."</p>

<p>The Sun GlassFish Portfolio offers a range of support and services 
options for customers, from basic patch services to 24x7 mission 
critical support. The Sun GlassFish Portfolio is available immediately 
via a flexible subscription-based pricing model starting at $999 per 
server (USD), making it a cost-effective solution. Also included is 
unlimited server pricing which can save 80-90% of costs compared to 
competitiors with fixed, per-server licensing. </p>

<p>To purchase the Sun GlassFish Portfolio, visit: 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/glassfish">http://www.sun.com/glassfish</a>.</p>

<p>According to Sun, this combines the most downloaded open source 
application server, GlassFish, with the world's most popular open 
source database, MySQL,  and allows customers to develop a unified 
open source strategy with simplicity-of-use for developers and 
administrators. GlassFish Portfolio and MySQL Enterprise are both 
available from Sun with consistent pricing and subscription support 
model that mirrors support at silver/gold/platnum levels.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss RESTEasy 1.0 Framework Goes GA</h3>

<p>The GA (General Availability) release of JBoss RESTEasy occurred in late
January. JBoss RESTEasy is a framework that allows writing RESTFul Web
Services in Java. It offers a fully portable implementation of the JAX-RS
specification for RESTful Web Services over HTTP.</p>

<p>RESTEasy can run in any servlet container, but tight integration with 
the JBoss Application Server is also available. While JAX-RS is only a 
server-side specification, RESTEasy brings JAX-RS to the client 
through the RESTEasy JAX-RS Client Framework. This client-side 
framework maps outgoing HTTP requests to remote servers using JAX-RS 
annotations and interface proxies.</p>

<p>Features include:</p>

<li> Fully certified JAX-RS implementation;</li>
<li> Portable to any app-server/Tomcat that runs on JDK 5 or higher;</li>
<li> Embeddedable server implementation for junit testing;</li>
<li> Rich set of providers for: XML, JSON, YAML, Fastinfoset, Atom, 
etc;</li>
<li> JAXB marshalling into XML, JSON, Fastinfoset, and Atom as well 
as wrappers for arrays, lists, and sets of JAXB Objects;</li>
<li> Asynchronous HTTP (Comet) abstractions for JBoss Web, Tomcat 6, 
and Servlet 3.0;</li>
<li> EJB, Spring, and Spring MVC integration;</li>
<li> Client framework that leverages JAX-RS annotations so that you 
can write HTTP clients easily (JAX-RS only defines server 
bindings).</ul>

<p>All documentation and download links are available at RESTEasy's 
<a href="http://jboss.org/">JBoss.org</a> project page.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LeftHand Networks Delivers Entry-level SAN for Virtualized Environments</h3>

<p>LeftHand Networks, an HP company, now has an entry-level storage area 
network (SAN) solution that improves performance and reduces storage 
costs within virtualized server environments for midsize businesses.</p>

<p>The LeftHand SAS Starter SAN helps customers efficiently deploy their 
first virtualization projects by simplifying the process of creating, 
accessing and managing shared storage resources.</p>

<p>The SAS Starter SAN includes management tools that provide 
replication, thin provisioning and snapshot capabilities. These

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">syslog-ng, Open Source Edition, Version 3.0 Released</h3>

<p>Following the release of the commercial version of syslog-ng last 
fall, its Open Source 3.0 Edition  is now available. The syslog-ng 
application is a mature system logger that is the default logging 
solution of the SUSE distributions and is estimated to run on hundreds 
of thousands of Linux and Unix computers.</p>

<p>Version 3.0 contains several new features that strengthen the range of 
syslog-ng's functionalities including support for the new syslog 
standard protocol and message format developed by the Internet 
Engineering Task Force (IETF). The application allows for filtering 
and segmenting  incoming log messages based on their parameters and 
content. The new version can even separate the content of the messages 
to name-value pairs, making it easy to process structured messages. It 
is also can rewrite and modify the messages when needed.</p>

<p>The syslog-ng application can directly send the log messages to SQL 
databases and log analyzing applications. Currently the MySQL, 
Microsoft SQL (MSSQL), Oracle, PostgreSQL, and SQLite databases are 
supported.</p>

<p>The syslog-ng application is optimized for performance and can process 
up to 75,000 messages per second real-time, that is, over 24 GB raw 
logs per hour on entry-level server hardware.</p>

<p>The application natively supports the reliable TCP and the encrypted 
TLS protocols.</p>

<p>The commercial syslog-ng Premium Edition features buffering the 
messages on hard disk, storing messages in encrypted log files, 
reading messages from arbitrary files, and  also support for Microsoft 
Windows operating systems.</p>

<h1>Away Mission - 2008 in Review - part 2</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
March is conference madness month in the San Francisco Bay Area with
week-to-week events that sometimes overlap. For the last few years, Open
Source developers and entrepreneurs have had EclipseCon, Dr. Dobb's
Software Development Conference (SD West), and the Open Source Business
Conference to choose from. Starting in 2008, if that audience was
interested in FOSS on mobile platforms, there was also the Emerging
Communications Conference (eComm), which was reviewed in <a
href="../159/dyckoff.html">part 1</a> last month.
</p>

<h3>EclipseCon-08</h3>
 
<p>
This conference actually went up a little in value in 2008 even with a
higher price because the tutorials were open to all conference
attendees. 
</p>

<p>
While EclipseCon is primarily about the Eclipse platform and the tools
for its myriad projects, it is also about community and the larger Open
Source ecosystem. There are sessions on creating and nurturing
communities, on the future directions of Java, and on the new scripting
languages that are supported on the Eclipse platform. There are
presentations and panels on software deployment, modeling languages, and
even SQL. In short, it's a really big tent.  The tracks were well defined
and taken all together were very comprehensive. Among the track topics were
Eclipse as a Platform, OSGi, SOA, Modeling, Performance, Web Tools, and
Emerging Technologies among others. However, some topics have sessions
that are scattered across different rooms. The EclipseCon color codes help
a bit with this to a degree, but with 8-10 simultaneous sessions, you could
be in for a little exercise.
</p>
 
<!--Previous paragraph's laundry list is incoherent, and what's with the
capitalization? Not sure where to go here.  KTO) -->

<p>
IBM held its own track on Tuesday, featuring its OpenUP Agile toolset and
the Agile-oriented Jazz collaboration suite, both heavily based on Eclipse.
In Jazz, and in Rational Team Concert, the team process is selected from
process templates including Scrum, OpenUP, and the Eclipse Way (or EPF,
the Eclipse Process Framework). You can also mix elements from these
processes in custom configurations reflecting the actual work process at
your own company or organization. Jazz uses Eclipse technology on both the
client and the server, and Team Concert provides agile teams with an
integrated tool set including source control, work item tracking and build
management with continuous integration.  The EclipseCon sessions are
<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/?page=sub/&amp;id=593">summarized here</a>.
</p>

<!-- I have no idea what "team process is selected from" means  KTO) -->

<!-- As I understand it, it's a decision on which methodology the team will
use in order to accomplish their task. All of the above workshops are about
frameworks that are used to structure large projects. - Ben -->

<p>
This is a very good set of collaboration tools, having been tested within
Eclipse Projects for more than a year and also getting the benefit of
IBM's own experience with the Rational RUP methodology, now available
as OpenUP. Some of this effort is occurring via the Project Zero website at
<a href="http://projectzero.org">http://projectzero.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
The presentations from the IBM Track are not in the EclipseCon archive for
2008, but here's a <a
href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rtc/v1r0m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.team.platform.doc/topics/c_jazz-platform-about.html">
link</a> to a representative Jazz web site at IBM Rational.</p>
 
<p>
I also attended a great late session on Groovy, a dynamic scripting
language that runs on JVMs. Groovy reduces the usual Java scaffolding for
developing code and simplifies Java syntax. Semicolons are optional and it
doesn't require getters and setters for each property; Groovy just does the
right thing. Groovy also simplifes testing right out of box, working
directly with JUnit. Groovy objects are called POGOs which are like Java
POJOs on steroids.
</p>

<p>
POGOS write their own property accessors and provide a default constructor
with named parameters. And like JRuby, Groovy compiles down to byte code.
Check out the PPT-formatted presentation here:
<a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/sub/attachments/Introduction_to_Groovy.ppt">Introduction to Groovy</a>.
</p>

<p>
EclipseCon offers lots of BOFs at night and several evening receptions with
food and drinks. I especially recommend the annual Poster Session where new
projects are presented by their developers with a pleasant dinner buffet.
The Higgins credential framework, for example, was just such a poster
presentation four years ago and is now widely used.
</p> 

<p>
Each morning had Euro breakfasts: brioche, bagels, and pastry with coffee
and tea. Sit-down lunches were the pattern again, with each table sporting
signage for different Eclipse topics and projects (EMF,RCP, AJAX, etc.)
There was plenty of choice here and lots of special meal categories were
coordinated. And beside networking opportunities, the food was pretty good.
The conference bag for 2008 was unfortunately just a canvas tote, but it did
have a zipper closure. Previous years have had distinctive backpacks.
</p>
 
<p>
EclipseCon generally gives attendees USB thumb drives with about half of
the conference presentations. The other presentations are available a day
or two after their sessions and can be added at update stations. Some
sessions show up weeks later. I personally think that is a problem for
attendees planning their day with so many sessions overlapping. Moreover,
many of the sessions on the USB drive get revised right before being
presented. Consequently, the update sessions are very busy and are a bit of
a bottle neck.
</p>
 
<p>
I also have to report a flaw in what is normally a very well organized
mid-sized conference. The check-in process on the first tutorial day backed
up badly and many attendees had to wait in line for 20-35 minutes. Clearly,
they didn't have enough stations and personnel to check IDs and hand out
badges and bags. But it was also asymmetric! They had 6 stations set up,
each handling 4 letters of the alphabet, the last station also handling Y
and Z. Last year, the A-D group was twice as long as any other and took the
longer 35 minute interval. They should have gone through the list of
registrants and set the letter groups up for roughly equal numbers of
attendees. So plan on showing up at least 30 minutes before your tutorial
if you want to attend EclipseCon this year.
</p>

<p>
Last year,  EclipseCon was be held March 17-20, the week before the Open
Source Business Conference (OSBC), but for 2009, EclipseCon is March 24-27,
and overlaps OSBC.
</p>

<p>
EclipseCon 2008 materials can be found
here: <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/">http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/</a>.
</p>

 
<h3>The Business of Open Source - OSBC</h3>
 
 
<p>
OSBC started a few years ago by discussing issues in OSS and legal
ramifications. In prior years, a lot of energy went into software patents
and the then-new <a
href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">GPLv3</a>. But in
2008, with few dragons left to slay, it was mostly about successful
adoption of OSS at the enterprise level. There were several presentations
on best practices and several case studies. For example, Weather.com and
Kaplan.com, the learning center company, revealed the works behind the
curtains a bit.
</p>

<p>
There are four tracks that run consistently over the two days of the conference:
one for CTOs, one for CFOs, one for lawyers or those interested in legal
topics, and a product and service track which also doubles as a track for
emerging trends. Each track has a dedicated room in close proximity to the
other sessions. There is little exercise in changing tracks here.
</p>

<p>
The agenda page lists the four parallel sessions and also has links to the
those presentations that are available online. Unfortunately, some of the better
presentations are not included, such as the opening keynote.
</p>

<p>
A more concrete presentation on the merits of going Open Source showed how
two developers moved the back end at the New York Times to FOSS. That led to
indexing 11 million PDF files, over 1.5 TB of data, in 24 hours with Amazon
Web Services and Hadoop for only $240. Now those files can be served with
the existing infrastructure and no new hardware. That presentation is here:
<a href="http://akamai.infoworld.com/event/osbc/08/docs/CIO-CTO-Gottfrid-Harris.pdf">http://akamai.infoworld.com/event/osbc/08/docs/CIO-CTO-Gottfrid-Harris.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
OSBC takes place at the Palace Hotel on Market Street in San Francisco,
near an exit of the Montgomery Street BART station and near several major
bus lines. This is a great location and allows attendees to use public
transportation easily. It is also a nice venue with a touch of Victorian
ambiance. However, power for laptops is an issue. Some rooms have power
strips near the front, but this is up to the organizers and was not true of
all session rooms. There are no power strips in the keynote room. The
moral here is to bring your own extension cord and maybe a multi-outlet
adapter to encourage sharing. We can all get along, right?
</p>

<p>
OSBC has usually provided a full breakfast buffet in the mornings, which is
taken away just before the keynotes start. So come fairly early to enjoy it
and to get a good seat.
</p>

<p>
The Open Source Business Conference will be held March 24-25, 2009. Last
year, OSBC followed EclipseCon, but in 2009, they will overlap.
</p>

<p>
For 2009, OSBC will have keynotes from Ron Hovsepian, CEO of Novell; Jim
Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat; Jonathan Schwartz, CEO of Sun Microsystems; and a
mystery speaker from Microsoft (yes, Redmond has a presence at OSBC.) There
will also be a keynote panel on the topic of "End Users and Linux: Do We
Have a Participation Problem?" led by Jim Zemlin, Executive Director of the Linux
Foundation.
</p>


<h3>SDWEST-08</h3>

<p>
Software Development West, or SD West, usually occurs in early March. Like
EclipseCon, SD West is held at the Santa Clara Convention Center. But the
perks and grub are more limited. The dates for 2009 are
March 9-13. This year, SD West is co-located with the Mobile Connect
conference.
</p>

<p>
The tracks here are expansive and cover most of the software development
lifecycle. The SD conference organizers claim to provide a global view of
the software industry and technological developments. There are separate
tracks for Java, C++, .Net, Web services, Agile processes, and security,
among others. New this year is the topical Cloud Computing and also a track
on Parallelism in software.
</p>

<p>
Another nice feature is the range of vendor-sponsored free technical
sessions. This year some of those sessions will be conducted by Coverity and
Open Make.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately for our readers, SD conference archives and presentations are
only available to conference attendees. The parent company for SD and Dr.
Dobbs - CMP - resells the content. So you have to go to SD West to get it.
</p>

<p>
I attended a lot of sessions on Agile process, modeling, and data
architecture. Many of these sessions were led by Scott Ambler or other
Agile leaders. I was generally satisfied with the sessions. I also attended
sessions on Web services and XML servers and distributed Ruby applications
which discussed SOAP4R, DRb and Rinda (which is a Ruby version of Linda, a
primitive paradigm for parallel processing).
</p>

<p>
An informative session on the developments surrounding HTML 5 was led by
Elliot Rusty Harold. Work around this emerging standard began accelerating
in 2008, because Microsoft finally decided to support the new standards
as the default behavior in IE-8. If they hadn't, it would have been a big
stumbling block.
</p>

<p>
Another somewhat tongue-in-cheek session discussed "Anti-Patterns in
Software Development".
</p>

<p>
The presenter, Rob Daigneau, was Director of Architecture at Monster.com
and currently host of www.designpatternsfor.net (he will also appear again
at this year's SD West, speaking on "Design Patterns for Domain Services").
Fortunately, he posts his presentations on that Web site and a 2007 version
of the slides are available <a
href="http://www.designpatternsfor.net/Presentations/AntiPatternsInSoftwareProjects.TheHumanFactor.V2.pdf">there</a>
as well.
</p>

<p>
Anti-patterns look like a good idea but backfire badly when applied. Here,
the anti-patterns referred to are ones of human behavior in SW projects, based
on roles and on personality types. Many of these behaviors impede the
success of a SW project. Among the personalities discussed were Code
Controllers, Perfectionists, Workaholics, and other behavior patterns for
managers and leaders.
</p>

<p>
The underlying anti-patterns include a lack of trust in team mates, or
optimizing too soon and too often, or - for Workaholics - too readily
accepting a culture of burnout at the companies we work for.
</p>

<p>
Daigneau spoke about larger organizational factors: a Fight Club mentality
that no one talks about with conflicts between groups or between tech leads
and architects and even between top executives. Daigneau noted that "fish
rot from the head down", meaning that real and sustained changes require
acceptance and support from top executives, who ultimately have
responsibility for lingering organizational problems.
</p>

<p>
What if the boss is a repeat offender? Daigneau says there are 3 choices:
adapt and adopt your boss' point of view, getting your boss or bosses to
change their practices, or to move on. That's the way the project
crumbles!
</p>

<p>
SD West has a lot of traditions and one of those is its campy Developer
Bowl, where teams from leading ISVs compete in a contest of technical and
industry trivia. Over the years the questions and the answers have gotten
pretty broad. Two years back, when Microsoft fielded a team, they appeared
in costume: Darth Vader and two Imperial Storm Troopers.
</p>

<p>
There are two matched competitions and then the winners of each face off. The
Developer Bowl in 2008 featured the return of Team Google, last year's
winner. But first up was CodeGear vs. IBM, last year's second place winner. IBM
passed them with ease to win the first set.
</p>

<p>
Second up was Google and Intel. Tim Matson of Intel introduced himself as a
kayaking instructor after his more senior team mates had introduced
themselves with variously 12 to 22 years of experience at Intel. The
Googlers responded with a wry ploy of each claiming 42 years of work at
Google, an indirect tribute to Douglas Adams of "Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Universe" fame. Intel, initially behind, pulled ahead on the last question
after a long tie.
</p>

<p>
In what was a close match with a tie score, IBM pulled ahead of Intel
during overtime. Several of the last computer trivia questions stumped both
teams, e.g.: "How are Dr. Dobbs and Kurt Cobain related?" (Answer, via
Courtney Love who was a relation of Dr. Dobbs). IBM prevailed in the end
after receiving the question about the number of "pockets" on an old punch
card reader - easy trivia for old IBMers. (The answer was a non-metric
'12', something typical of original IBM equipment. And for readers not old
enough to remember, the size of an IBM punch card matched the size of a
1950's dollar since every card reader represented cash for IBM.)
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Unfortunately, this is incorrect: the IBM card of the 1950s - actually
designed in 1928 - was 7.375" by 3.25" in size, while the US dollar bill,
the current size of which was set in 1929, is 6.14" by 2.61". The origin of
this myth is relatively obvious: the original Hollerith card of 1887 was
indeed the same size as the (large) US paper dollar of that time.
Suggestions for the choice of size were that the inventor, H. Hollerith,
felt that people would treat it with respect due to the similarity; that
boxes for currency were cheaply available; and that equipment for handling
media of that size was already being made for the US Treasury. However,
there is no actual evidence or support for any of these, and they must
remain urban legends. -- Ben ]

<h1>The Unbearable Lightness of Desktops: IceWM and idesk</h1>

<p>
<p>
For the last couple of years, I've been running Ubuntu on my HP Pavillion
zv6000 laptop (AMD Athlon&trade; 64 Processor, 374MB RAM, 40GB HD) - and
have often found myself grousing at the grindingly slow performance,
particularly when I wanted to run any heavy-duty applications. Until
recently, I took it for granted that running anything like GIMP or even
Firefox meant essentially constant swapping, huge latency, stuttering in my
audio programs, skipped frames in video apps... in short, behavior that
I would have expected out of some ancient decrepit piece of hardware rather
than a 64-bit powerhouse that this laptop is supposed to be. Even though I
got more or less used to it, there was always that bit of buried outrage
that one of the friendliest Linux distros out there consigned me to a life
of crawling while everyone else was sprinting. If a Windows user ever asked
me "so, is Linux faster than Windows?", I'd have to point them to other
people's machines - since my own was anything but an effective
demonstrator. It was time, and past time, to put some effort into resolving
the situation.
</p>

Sometimes, it takes a particular event to push us out of a rut; in my case,
the trigger happened when I recently attended the Ubuntu Bug Jam at SCaLE
(the Southern California Linux Expo.) 
<img width="248" height="66" src="misc/okopnik/globalbugjam-logo.png" alt="Ubuntu Bug Jam logo" align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
The local <a
href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CaliforniaTeam/Projects/Scale7x">Ubuntu
team</a> was comprised of a very nice group of helpful folks who helped me
out with an odd question that I had regarding font viewers under Ubuntu,
and who got me thinking of other problems that I wanted to address -
including this one. My questions about speeding up my machine didn't
produce any definitive answers, but the process did get me thinking in this
direction - which was enough of a start. Thanks, guys!
</p>

<h3>Back to the Future, or Forward to the Past?</h3>

<p>
The more I thought about it, the more I recalled my old (previous to
Ubuntu) setup: I was running Debian, with IceWM as the window manager and
'idesk' as an icon manager. The combination was highly flexible, very
powerful, and gave me everything that I wanted in a GUI (interestingly
enough, I found both GNOME and KDE lacking in several respects - even
though they had much more functionality in other ways.)
</p>

<p>
Installing both of the above under Ubuntu was trivially simple:
</p>

<pre class="code">
sudo apt-get install icewm idesk
</pre>

<p>
...which, of course, produced no visible result. Unsurprising, since GNOME
was still running; fortunately, the GNOME display manager (GDM) provides us
with a nice mechanism for changing WMs. All you have to do is restart X -
whether by logging out or by hitting the magic 'Ctrl-Alt-X' key combo which
kills the X server - and select 'Options/Select session'. This allows you
to start X with a different window manager, and to make that change
temporary or permanent. Initially, I used the "Just for this session"
version, but once I had everything configured the way I wanted it, I made
the change permanent.
</p>

<h3>Configuring IceWM</h3>

<p>
Like any properly-written application, IceWM will run just fine without any
special configuration - but configuring it "kicks it up to the next level".
From a very basic, boring desktop with minimal functionality, it can
quickly become a sleek, beautiful, responsive environment for any kind of
GUI operations that you can envision for a GUI manager. Now, I'll be
honest: I've looked at the IceWM GUI configurator (icemc) and... was not
impressed. No insult to the people who put it together, but I find that a
plain text editor works better, at least for me. The syntax of the various
toolbar and key configuration files is so simple and intuitive, especially
if you copy and edit the sample files that come with IceWM, that there's no
reason to add another layer of complexity between you and the results you
want.
</p>

<p>
Some of the most basic things - e.g., choosing a theme or a focus method -
are built right into the IceWM menus. As an example, in this image, I've
replaced IceWM's basic greenish-gray background with a snappy-looking
"Area51" theme just by choosing it from the menu (available either from the
button in the lower left corner or right-clicking on the desktop):
</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="375" src="misc/okopnik/icewm1.png" alt="IceWM: Area51 theme"><br>
<strong>IceWM: Area51 theme</strong>
</p>

<p>
I actually recommend choosing a theme for yourself before you start hacking
the rest of the settings - this will create a ~/.icewm directory and place
a 'theme' file in it containing the theme you've chosen. Since that's what
we need to do anyway, this saves us a bit of work.
</p>

<p>
By default, IceWM will read the configuration files in /etc/X11/icewm. If
you're going to tweak a lot of things, I'd suggest copying the files from
there as well as from /usr/share/icewm and modifying them: the format is
rather obvious in all cases, and it's a lot easier to change what already
exists than to try to remember something new and unfamiliar. In practice,
at least for me, this comes down to modifying only three files:
'preferences', 'toolbar', and 'keys'. The first one modifies the default
preferences for how IceWM itself acts and runs, the second determines the
mini-icons on the toolbar, and the third - in some ways the most useful -
allows you to define key combinations which will execute the programs that
you set for them. This last was, in fact, the functionality that I found
either missing or badly restricted in other WMs. Again, since the default
files are heavily commented, and the default state for each setting is
shown, tweaking these is very easy. Let's start with ~/.icewm/preferences;
please note that I've deleted all but the prefs that I want to be different
from the default setting.

<pre class="code">
#  Support mouse wheel
UseMouseWheel=1 # 0/1

#  Clock Time format (strftime format string)
TimeFormat="%T"

#  Show APM/ACPI/Battery/Power status monitor on task bar
TaskBarShowAPMStatus=1 # 0/1

#  Beep when new mail arrives
TaskBarMailboxStatusBeepOnNewMail=1 # 0/1

#  Count messages in mailbox
TaskBarMailboxStatusCountMessages=1 # 0/1

#  Execute taskbar applet commands (like MailCommand, ClockCommand, ...) on single click
TaskBarLaunchOnSingleClick=0 # 0/1

#  Icon search path (colon separated)
IconPath="/home/ben/Pics/icons:/usr/share/icons:/usr/share/pixmaps"

#  Command to run on mailbox
MailCommand="/usr/local/bin/rmutt"

#  Command to shutdown the system
ShutdownCommand="/usr/bin/gksudo /sbin/halt"

#  Command to reboot the system
RebootCommand="/usr/bin/gksudo /sbin/reboot"

#  Network device to show status for
NetworkStatusDevice="ppp0 eth0 wlan0"

# Workspace names
WorkspaceNames=" 1 ", " 2 ", " 3 ", " 4 "

#  Show workspace switching buttons on task bar
TaskBarShowWorkspaces=0 # 0/1
</pre> 

<p>
Hopefully, all of the above is clear enough; the names of the settings are
pretty self-explanatory, and the comments make the rest of it obvious.
</p>

<p>
One of the things I decided not to set here, although the capability
exists, is the desktop background. Instead, as you will see later in this
article, I've left that piece to be handled by idesk because I prefer the
way that it handles backgrounds - and it's nice to have that kind of
choices.
</p>

<p>
Next, I set up the toolbar file. By default, it shows only two mini-icons:
xterm and Mozilla. Since the toolbar is always visible no matter what
windows may cover the desktop, this is a good place to put your "must-have"
apps - and that's what I did, reserving the desktop for things that are
less immediate.
</p>

<pre class="code">
prog "BackFlip" "kmultiple_16x16.xpm" /usr/local/bin/bkgr
prog "Lock screen" "decrypted_16x16.xpm" /usr/bin/xlock -random
prog "Mix" "music_32ndnote_16x16.xpm" /usr/bin/tkmixer
prog "Firefox" "mozilla_16x16.xpm" /usr/bin/firefox-2
prog "JPilot" "pda_black_16x16.xpm" /usr/bin/jpilot
prog "Xcal" "spreadsheet_16x16.xpm" /usr/local/bin/Xcal
prog "Snap" "image_16x16.xpm" /usr/local/bin/snap
prog "Cell-up" "presence_online_16x16.xpm" /usr/local/bin/aircard-up
</pre>

<p>
Again, we have a simple layout: the popup label for the icon, the icon
image, and the program to run. Here, I made use of a number of scripts that
I've written over the years as well as standard Linux programs: "bkgr" for
changing the backgrounds at will, "Xcal" to display a convenient and simple
year-long calendar that I got from a <a
href="../118/tag/3.html">2-cent tip</a> here in LG,
and so on. The icons that I used are located in my ~/Pics/icons directory -
but IceWM knows about that because I set the "IconPath" variable in the
'preferences' file, above. No problem at all - except that I had to consult
my wife, the resident graphics designer, about the choice of icons. Oh well
- we all have our strengths...
</p>

<p>
Last, I set up the 'keys' file:
</p>

<pre class="code">
key "Alt+Ctrl+m" /usr/local/bin/rmutt
key "Alt+Ctrl+l" /usr/bin/xterm -e lynx
key "Alt+Ctrl+x" /usr/bin/xterm
key "Alt+Ctrl+g" /usr/local/bin/urlgrab
key "Alt+Ctrl+u" /usr/local/bin/urlsee
key "Alt+Ctrl+k" /usr/bin/xkill
key "Alt+Ctrl+a" /usr/local/bin/voladj -u
key "Alt+Ctrl+z" /usr/local/bin/voladj -d
</pre>

<p>
Again, obvious syntax and lots of scripts - 'rmutt' to set up and fire off
my Mutt email reader, 'urlgrab' to run "wget" on a currently-highlighted
URL (via 'xclip'), 'urlsee' to browse a URL, and 'voladj' to adjust the
audio volume on the system. Few other window managers make it this easy!
</p>

<p>
One of the really nice bits of running IceWM is the ability to test its
configuration quickly. Most of the changes - as far as I can tell,
everything except 'preferences' - happen immediately, as soon as you save
the relevant file; testing the changes in 'preferences' simply requires
selecting 'Window Managers/IceWM' on the menu, which restarts IceWM (a
matter of two seconds or so.) Instant feedback is great - especially if
you're used to having to restart GNOME or KDE, which takes a long time by
comparison.
</p>

<h3>Configuring idesk</h3>

<p>
Now that IceWM is up and running, you may decide that you want desktop
icons as well. Frankly, I see a number of arguments against doing so: given
the combination of the menu button (as well as right-clicking anywhere on
the desktop, which brings up the same menu), the toolbar icons, and the
fact that you can run programs by clicking the mail icon, the network
monitors, the CPU monitor, and the clock, and considering that the desktop
itself will be covered 99% of the time, it seems like gilding the lily.
However, if that's what you want to do, then I suggest sticking with an
equally lightweight option: idesk. This is a simple but capable icon
manager; its only weak point, in my opinion, is the lack of easy
configuration for its icon files - so, as is often the case, I've made up
the lack by writing a bit of code. This configurator is slightly clumsy
with regard to setup, but works pretty well.
</p>

<p>
There are two parts to setting up idesk: you need to create a ~/.ideskrc
file and the individual .lnk files in a directory called ~/.idesktop.
Sample files for these can be copied from '/usr/share/idesk/default.lnk',
but I'll make it even simpler than that (keep reading, and you'll see!)
Everything that goes into those is well documented in
/usr/share/idesk/README, but you don't actually need to go in there unless
you run into problems.
</p>

<p>
To make all of the above easy, I used a combination of the 'thttpd' web
server, a bit of CGI, and the Mozilla browser - along with some canned
links. Here's all you need to do to make it work.
</p>

<h3>Setting up</h3>

<p>
First, make sure to install the 'thttpd' web server and the
'gnome-icon-theme' package. Next, copy the default .ideskrc file and create
your .idesktop directory with a 'builder' directory under it:
</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install thttpd gnome-icon-theme
cp /usr/share/idesk/dot.ideskrc ~/.ideskrc
mkdir -p ~/.idesktop/builder
</pre>

<p>
Now, place the files from <a href="misc/okopnik/builder.tgz">this
tarball</a> into the '~/.idesktop' directory. This will also create a
symlink in '~/.idesktop/builder' called '24x24' that points to
/usr/share/icons/gnome/24x24:
</p>

<pre>
tar xvzf builder.tgz -C ~/.idesktop
</pre>

<p>
At this point, you have the minimal setup necessary to run idesk. Start it
from a terminal, watching for errors:
</p>

<pre>
idesk
</pre>

<p>
You'll probably see warnings when you do:
</p>

<pre>
Idesk starting in :0.0
[idesk] Background's file not found.
[idesk] Background's source not found.
</pre>

<p>
These are not critical, but they make a good reminder: you may want to add
a background image to ~/.ideskrc at this point (all of the following should
be added at the end of the 'table Config' section.) You could specify
either a <tt>Background.File: /absolute/path/to/image/file.ext</tt> or a
<tt>Background.Source: /directory/with/images</tt> for a randomly-chosen
background that changes every so often (<tt>Background.Delay: 5</tt> would
set it to every 5 minutes; the default is 0 - i.e., never changes - which
would just give you a random image once per session.) You might also
consider setting <tt>Background.Mode: MODE</tt>, which will modify how the
images are displayed; the valid modes are Stretch, Scale, Center, Fit, and
Mirror.
</p>

<p>
Once idesk is up and running, double-click the 'Desktop' icon that appears
on your desktop; this will start 'thttpd', bring up a Mozilla browser, and
show you the following interface:
</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="365" src="misc/okopnik/builder.png" alt="the Builder interface"><br>
<strong>The Builder interface</strong>
</p>

<p>
Simply enter the caption (i.e., the label which will show under the icon),
the name of the program - preferably including its path - and click on an
icon. Builder will create the .lnk file based on your choices and show you
the contents; you can then return to Builder to create another icon. When
you're done, just close the browser; this will also kill the web server.
To see your new icons, you'll need to restart idesk; this simply requires
double-clicking any of its icons with <em>both</em> mouse buttons. To edit
a link file manually, you need to double-right-click its icon; running the
program, as always, takes a double-left-click.
</p>

<h3>The Wrap-up</h3>

<p>
In this article, I've tried to present a cohesive setup for anyone
interested in converting their default Ubuntu setup to a lighter, faster,
sleeker configuration. Obviously, I can't guarantee any specific gains if
you do this, but on my machine, I've gone from a CPU that was always
showing a load of 1 or even slightly more <em>while completely idle</em> to
one that acts as a Linux machine should:
</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="35" src="misc/okopnik/top.png" alt="'top' output: load averages with IceWM"><br>
<strong>'top' output: load averages with IceWM</strong>
</p>

<p>
No longer is running Mozilla a concern, nor do I see much (if any) swapping
when I run GIMP, etc. In fact, for the first time ever on this machine,
I've been able to install and run 'openarena' (a video-heavy first-person
shooter) and have it actually <em>work</em> - no lag! - instead of chugging
slowly one frame at a time. Applications open with unbelievable speed, and
even flipping open an xterm feels like neck-snapping acceleration. For this
happy camper, IceWM and idesk provide a comfortable, competent, and above
all <strong>fast</strong> graphical environment for Linux. Give it a try!

<p>
It is often said that the real power of Linux lies at the command line -
and this is true. Unfortunately, many new Linux users start out trying
Linux as a desktop operating system and get frustrated when they discover
the frequent necessity of using the command line - an unfamiliar and thus
uncomfortable environment. This usually happens when they need to install
from a tarball (compileable source code in a tar.gz file) and discover that
they have to type commands or navigate to a specific directory. To make
matters worse, the directory-separator slash (/) is the wrong way if
they're used to DOS.
</p>

<p>
Or perhaps they need to get video playback to work right - something that
can still be quite challenging under Linux. These types of things can be
quite difficult for new users because of numerous differences in the
operating systems. My purpose here is to try to make the transition easier
by explaining some basics that should help, whether you are trying to learn
Linux formally or just starting out as a desktop user trying to break away
from Microsoft. 
</p>

<p>
In reality, Linux will become a whole lot easier if you get familiar with
just a few key concepts. Among those things is the directory structure: for
example, there's no more C:\ drive. Instead, Linux has the <em>root of the
file system</em> located at '/', which is equivalent to C:\ in Windows.  No
matter how many drives there are in a Linux system, there will only be one
filesystem tree - more drives just increase the available space. Linux does
not use the concept of one directory tree for each drive like Windows does.
</p>

<p>
Learning the structure of this directory tree is one of the biggest hurdles
for the new user. As an example, the part of the system containing your
personal files is referred to as your home directory; its name is the same
as your username, and it is located under the '/home' directory. There is a
link to a great little tutorial at the end of this article that may take a
couple of hours to go through, but it will definitely help you to get
familiar with Linux. 
</p>

<p>
Most commands in Linux are some short form of what the command does; e.g.,
the <tt>ls</tt> command stands for 'list', and <tt>cd</tt> being short for
change directory. Just by learning a few simple commands you will be able
to navigate your system effectively and perform many tasks, but be patient
- it takes time. Linux has around 3000+ commands.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Actually, that statement is both true and misleading. Every program in
Linux is a command, but you only need to know a tiny percentage of these to
work on the command line effectively. In general, the standard Unix toolkit
(e.g., <a
href="http://www.dataexpedition.com/~sbnoble/Tips/2commands.html">this
list</a> of commands) is all that's necessary - and even experts are
rarely completely familiar with all of these. In my opinion, knowing
about 40 of these commands will suffice the average user 99.9% of the time. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
All of these have similarities in their syntax, and there are some basic
concepts that are uniform across all commands. Perhaps the most important
thing to remember is the <tt>man</tt> command; whenever you need to use
some unfamiliar command, just type <tt>man <em>command</em></tt>. This will
pop up the <em>manual page</em> for that command, giving you information
that you may need before you execute it.
</p>


<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>
The syntax of a command refers to the grammar of the sequence that we enter
on the command line. To verify the syntax for a specific command, a quick
glimpse at the appropriate man page will usually clear things up; this
information is found under the SYNOPSIS heading. For most commands, the
syntax is '<strong><em>command options argument</em></strong>'.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Command</strong></dt> 
<dd>The name of a program like <tt>ls</tt> or <tt>cat</tt> or <tt>grep</tt>.</dd>

<dt><strong>Option</strong></dt>
<dd>A letter or a word preceded by a dash for "short options" or double
dashes for the "long form" of an option. <tt>-a</tt> is a short option and
<tt>--all</tt> is a long option; both mean the same thing.</dd> 

<dt><strong>Argument</strong></dt>
<dd>An argument may be a file name, a directory, a device specification
like <tt>/dev/cdrom</tt>. It is usually tied to the option (e.g., '--file
doc.txt') and is, in a sense, the object of the command.
</dd> 
</dl>

<p>
Most people have problems deciding where to put a space in the command
line. The best guideline is that there should be spaces after every command
and between all options preceded by a minus. Arguments may or may not
require preceding spaces. Again, the man page is often the best guide.
</p>


<h3>The Prompt</h3>

<p>
The first thing you'll see when working in the command shell is 
the shell prompt. Looking at it will normally tell you what user you are, 
your system hostname, and your location on the system.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ This is not necessarily true on many other Unix systems, or even in some
of the smaller Linux distros. Often, the prompt consists of nothing more
than '$', '%', or '#' to show your user level and shell type; for more
information, you may need to either configure the prompt or use some of the
toolkit informational commands. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
Looking at the sample below, we can see that our username is 'tom'. This is
followed by the @ symbol which separates the username from the system
hostname; if you never named your system, it may have 'localhost' in this
position. Following this, we have the '~' character which indicates that we
are in this user's home directory. Finally, we have the '$' character; this
tell us, in a general fashion, the level of permissions that we have as a
user. This varies across different shells; for example, the C shells (csh,
tcsh) will use '%' for a standard user, while the Bourne shell and its
derivatives (sh, ksh, bash, zsh, and a number of others) will usually use
'$'. The root user (the system's superuser) gets a special prompt of '#';
this lets the user know to be very, very cautious and precise in the
commands they issue, since the root user can easily destroy or damage the
system.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Regular User:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$            
</pre>
<p>
<strong>Root User:</strong>
</p>
<pre class="code">
[root@station1 ~]#
</pre>

<p>
Typing the command <tt>echo $SHELL</tt> tom finds out he is using Bash
(a.k.a., the "Bourne Again Shell".) The 'echo' command in this example
prints the value of the <tt>$SHELL</tt> variable to the screen. The Bash
shell is normally the default shell on most modern Linux systems.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$ echo $SHELL
/bin/bash
</pre>

<p>
If the current directory is not shown in the prompt, the first important
command you should learn is <tt>pwd</tt> which is short for "print working
directory". This will reveal the full path as we can see below.
</p>

<pre class="code"> 
[tom@station1 ~]$ pwd
/home/tom
</pre>

<h3>Commands</h3>

<p>
Commands are either shell built-ins, compiled executable programs, or
executable scripts located somewhere on your system. The shell is a command
interpreter which reads certain environment variables (you can see these by
typing 'env' at the command line) when you open a command shell. When you
type a command, the command interpreter will search the directories listed
in the PATH variable to find the program you've asked it to execute. If it
is not a shell built-in, an alias to a command, a defined function, or a
program in the defined path, the command interpreter returns the
'command not found' error.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$ print help me 
bash: print: command not found
</pre>

<p>
There are many commands - maybe too many. To see how many you have
available, just hit the 'tab' key twice in a terminal; this will show you a
number and ask if you actually want to see all of them.  Don't worry:
you'll never need to know most of them (many of these are invoked by other
commands or via GUI menus.) No one can remember them all - there wouldn't
be any point to it in the first place - and learning just a handful will
help you out greatly on any Linux system.
</p>

<p>
Commands are case sensitive and are normally lower case. Another important
thing to remember is that many commands (e.g., copying, moving, attaching a
device, etc.) work in a "what to where" fashion:
</p>

<pre class="code">
cp /my/source/file /destination/file/or/directory
mv /from/here /to/there
mount /dev/mydevice /directory/to/mount/in
</pre>


<h3>Switches and Options</h3> 

<p>
Switches and options are used to modify the action of the command. They are
usually preceded immediately by either a single or double dash, and are in
the form of letters or full words. Some commands will require options and
some will not. Here are some samples: 
</p>

<p>
Simple command:
</p>
<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$ ls
</pre>
<p>
Short option example:
</p>
<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$ ls -a
</pre>
<p>
Multiple short options: 
</p>
<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$ ls  -a -h -i
</pre>
<p>
Multiple short options can be grouped:
</p>
<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$ ls -ahi
</pre>
<p>
Long option example:
</p>
<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$ ls --all 
</pre>
<p>
Multiple long options:
</p>
<pre class="code">
[tom@station1 ~]$ ls --all --human-readable --inode
</pre>

<p>
Normally, short options can be grouped together if more than one is
required. In addition, some short options have equivalent long options
which perform the same action.   
</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<p>
An argument is usually an object that the command operates on; whether a
command takes an argument at all depends on the command. For example, the
command <tt>ls</tt> can take an argument, but if none is supplied the
command assumes the current working directory is the argument and lists the
current directory. An example of a command that takes no arguments is
'true': it takes only options.

<!-- Changed 'top' to 'true'. Joey, 'top' does indeed take arguments: e.g.,
'top -p pid [,pid, ...]' is valid usage. - Ben -->

Again, arguments vary depending on the command and a great many commands
have a default argument. 
</p>


<h3>Getting Help Using the Man Pages</h3>

<p>
When using the command line,  it is advantageous to get in the habit of
using Linux's built-in manual page system, also called the "man" pages. At
first glance, the man pages can look intimidating and very cryptic. Be
assured, though - they are very helpful and necessary.  By using them you
will greatly enhance the speed at which you are learning Linux.  To see
the man pages for a command, merely type 'man command' and a screen with
information will pop up. To navigate a man page, you use the arrow keys
and page-up/page-down keys to scroll, and the letter "q" to quit. There are
a number of other navigation keys for searching, jumping to the top or the
bottom, and so on; these depend on the pager program (usually 'more' or
'less', with the latter being most common.) You can read about these by
hitting the 'h' key (help) while browsing the man page.
</p>

<p>
When you look at any man page, you will notice several section headings:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>NAME:</strong></dt> 
<dd>The name of the command and often similar commands that may be of use.</dd>

<dt><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong></dt> 
<dd>This section will give you the detailed syntax for running the command
correctly. You may have to review the OPTIONS section, below, to get the
precise details. There are many commands that must have options supplied to
work at all.</dd> 

<dt><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong></dt>
<dd>Usually a brief to detailed technical description of what 
the command does.</dd> 

<dt><strong>OPTIONS:</strong></dt> 
<dd>Under this heading, there will be a listing of the long and short
options that the command accepts. You will almost always need to use some
sort of option with a command, so this section is quite important.  This
section can be fairly long. Since most commands use different meanings for
their options, be aware that whatever options you used on one command may
mean something completely different when used with some other command.</dd>

<dt><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></dt> 
<dd>When using unfamiliar commands I almost always look for this section so I 
don't foul something up. This section, if it exists, may further clarify up 
the syntax of the command being researched.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There may be more categories for some commands and less for others. This 
depends on the commands.
</p>

<p>
Learning Linux can be a long process but you will most definitely find it 
fun and rewarding as you discover the awesome power that it contains.   
</p>

<h3>Additional Help</h3> 

<p>
The Linux system was originally designed for the command line user, and if
you know how to find the help that you need, you will have access to far
more power than the average desktop user can even imagine.

<!-- Snipped poor example of 'updatedb' and 'makewhatis'. The 'Find' dialog
in Windows does that just as efficiently, and is perhaps easier for the
average user. In addition, both 'updatedb' and 'makewhatis' are usually an
automatic part of most distros, as well as being part of regular
maintenance handled by 'cron' files. - Ben -->

Another helpful source of information, if it is installed on your machine,
is the 'info' command; this is the Texinfo documentation system, which
contains the official documentation of the GNU Project. Some systems have
both 'man' and 'info' available. It is a good idea to check both and see if
one offers more information that is to your liking.  Generally info pages
tend to be easier to understand then the man pages, although in some
instances the information is identical. To use the info system, type
<tt>info <em>command</em></tt> or just <tt>info</tt> to get familiar with
it.
</p>

<h3>Tab Completion</h3>

<p>
Another helpful feature of the Linux command line is <em>tab command
completion</em> and <em>path completion</em>. If you are not sure of the
correct complete spelling of a command or a file name you can just type a
couple of the initial letters of that command and hit the 'tab' key to see
what the Bash shell comes up with for assistance. If the command specified
by what you've typed so far is unique, it will complete the task for you by
filling in the spelling; if not, it will present you with a list of
possible choices. 
</p>

<p>
Assuming, for example, that you need a command that can help you configure
your sound card but only remember that it starts with "syst". Just
type 
</p>

<pre class="code"> 
[tom@station1 ~]$ syst
</pre>

<p>
Then hit tab (you may need to hit it twice depending on your configuration)
which should reward you with the following output: 
</p>

<pre class="code"> 
system-cdinstall-helper          system-config-rootpassword
system-config-authentication     system-config-samba
system-config-date               system-config-securitylevel
system-config-display            system-config-securitylevel-tui
system-config-kdump              system-config-selinux
system-config-keyboard           system-config-services
system-config-language           system-config-soundcard
system-config-lvm                system-config-time
system-config-network            system-config-users
system-config-network-cmd        system-control-network
system-config-packages           system-install-packages
system-config-printer            systool
</pre>

<p>
From this, you can see the name of the command you need:
<tt>system-config-soundcard</tt>. This also works with paths to files.  To
use this feature and get the feel of how it works, start by typing a
directory path - but after typing a couple of characters hit the tab key
and see if it auto-completes for you. If it does not, it's because there is
not enough characters to differentiate it from another possible choice. You
can try adding another character or couple of characters and hitting the
tab key again; this will allow it to complete for you. This can actually
save you a lot of typing:
'cat&nbsp;/usr/include/c++/4.0.4/i486-linux-gnu/bits/messages_members.h' becomes
'cat /u&rArr;i&rArr;c+&rArr;&rArr;0.&rArr;i&rArr;b&rArr;m&rArr;' - 22 characters
instead of 66!
</p>

<h3>Command History</h3>

<p>
Using the arrow keys also can make things easier. In Bash, these are mapped
to what is called the <em>command history</em>: using the up arrow will
take you to the previous executed command, and hitting the up arrow twice
will take you back two commands. Of course, the down arrow does the
opposite and moves you forward in the command history until no more
commands are left. To see everything in the command history type
<tt>history</tt> on the command line; recalling a previous command anywhere
in the list can be done with 'Ctrl-R' and typing a part of that command.  A
command can also be recalled by noting its number in the 'history' output
and typing an exclamation point followed by that number.  There are many
more shortcuts available; you can read about these in the 'HISTORY' section
of 'man bash'.
</p>

 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This

<h1>SCaLE 7 Speed-through</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">Kat Tanaka Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p> 
Now in its seventh year, it's hard to believe  <a
href="http://scale7x.socallinuxexpo.org/">the Southern California Linux
Expo (SCaLE)</a> started off as a grouping of Southern California LUGfests.
Regular readers of LG may remember that <a
href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben</a> and I first attended two years ago,
mentioned in a series of writeups, in <a href="../136/">issue 136</a>. Our
now 18-month old son, <a href="../authors/okopnik1.html">Michael</a>,
attended for the second time as well, while his sibling-to-come upheld
family tradition by attending his or her first Linux convention <em>in
utero</em>. Some of the big names in Open Source attend this convention,
and the organizers have really applied every lesson they've learned along
the way to make this a smoothly-run success.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to the long lines reported at SCaLE 5, the organizers switched
to self-check-in, which cut delays substantially. The check-in printout
included a raffle ticket for the Saturday evening reception and a
personalized Web address for speaker surveys. The convention schedule was
well-designed and easy to read. Signs made what could have been "hard to
find" rooms merely a long walk.
</p>

<p>
There were signs of economic slowdown everywhere. Freebies were barely in
evidence, and most of those were inexpensive - distro CDs, pens, and
stickers. Some of the very few memorable ones were the ubiquitous flashing
FreeBSD felt devil horns on a headband, O'Reilly's selection of buttons,
and the ZenOSS squishy zebra. Michael's favorite was the collapsible
frisbee in a pouch from Bytware; his Mommy and Daddy really appreciated
that, too, as one of the best child-safe and attention-holding gimmes ever!
The convention itself gave away eco-friendly lightweight canvas totes
instead of T-shirts - a smart move away from the usual plastic or paper
bags.
</p>

<p>
The free WiFi available in many parts of the convention was maddeningly
slow. (Another unfortunate victim of budgetary constraints - truly adequate
bandwidth would have been prohibitively expensive, and efforts at more
creative solutions were stymied by lack of line-of-sight to appropriate
relay stations). The Westin itself is a T-mobile hotspot, so anyone
inclined to pay was probably well-served.
</p>

<p>
Friday started the weekend off with a full schedule:
</p>

<p>
What was once the "medical track" at SCaLE has become its own one-day
conference (Demonstrating Open-Source Healthcare Solutions - <a
href="http://www.dohcs.org/">DOHCS</a>). Ben and I didn't sit in on any
seminars, but it looked like it was well-attended and well-regarded by the
professionals it was designed for.
</p>

<p>
Fedora and ZenOSS had free-form tracks on Friday, respectively as "Activity
Day" and "Community Day", while Subversion opted for a series of organized
panels for their Community Day track. Sun had Solaris workstations set up
in the room that became the "Try It Lab" for the rest of the weekend; this
was a hands-on area with multiple workstations and a facilitator for trying
out everything from Ruby to Moodle to OpenOffice - a very nice opportunity
for anyone who wanted to get a little actual experience.
</p>
 
<p>
I stopped by one of the last panels in the Women in Open Source track on
Friday, after ignoring the room with the mysterious label "WIOS". I wish
they had opted for the complete expanded title instead. The OSSIE (Open
Source in Education) track was also very well attended - they managed to
fill an auditorium. This is the track that Ben regrets missing the most,
since education has always been near and dear to his heart; perhaps we'll
catch it in a future SCaLE.
</p>

<p>
Other multi-slot programming included BSD certification exams, the Ubuntu
Bug Jam, and the League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA)
running four half-day classes for sysadmins as SCaLE University. The
convention had its usual excellent spread of classes for all experience levels
from utter beginner to pro, with some big name speakers at all levels. Ben
and I didn't get to as many panels as we'd have liked, but we had a great
time over all. We did a lot of tag-team babyminding, and some fellow
attendees (and some staffers) entertained Michael as well. Many of the
presenters shared their information at the SCaLE Web site, and I will
definitely be following up on the ones I wish I'd seen. I wish I'd gotten
to participate in "Growing up Free", and hope that SCaLE expands that
concept along with the ubiquitous OLPC machines to a parent/child track
(especially if they incorporated childcare or child-friendly panels).
</p>

<p>
The "Weakest Geek Theatre" (actually, a panel-style game show with
contestants voting each other off for bad answers) was a lot of fun.
Topics ranged from the obvious to the obscure, and <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randal_L._Schwartz">Randal Schwartz</a>
was on hand to act as arbiter for the Perl questions.  Contestants started
to use "Al Gore!" (who, as we all know, <em>didn't</em> invent the
Internet), as their favorite way of saying, "bleeped if I know the answer
to that!", and I'm highly tempted take that on, myself.  Midway through,
someone announced the availability of FREE! beer in the back. Cue stampede
for free beer.  
</p>

<p>
As far as the venue itself, the Westin LAX's elevators were horribly slow,
but that, of course, is out of SCaLE's control - and there were signs
promising faster service (after renovation) coming soon. The front desk
staff was extremely gracious and helpful.
</p>

<p>
We met some LG alums - sorry to say I don't remember your names, having
been <em>slightly</em> distracted by the energetic explorations of Michael
throughout the weekend. Please do remind me! We learned about some great
open source software - a few games we had overlooked until now, and some
projects we hope to showcase in the coming issues.
</p> 

<p>
For anyone at any level of Linux expertise, SCaLE is a great "bang for your
buck" gathering and one we look forward to attending again.

<h1>Development Builds Layered on Top of a Stable System by Means of Unionfs</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/wallenstein.html">Dirk Wallenstein</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
    Unionfs is a filesystem type by which you can merge multiple directories into one mountpoint. 
    The source directories (branches) are stacked onto each other with filesystem entries 
    in the top layer hiding/overriding entries in the layers below. In this article I'd like 
    to show you how to set up a layered <code>/usr</code> directory, which
    allows you to push and pop a development directory onto/from your distribution's 
    <code>/usr</code> directory. That way you don't ever modify your stable system, and can still 
    test your work in a real context. Further I'll show you how to put boot options into place, to 
    choose between the stable system and the development system at bootup. 
    That way you can replace core system applications that are started by init.
</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
    The steps shown here will deeply interfere with your system's filesystem hierarchy and boot process. 
    You might render your system unusable or even lose all your data. 
    I cannot be held responsible for that. Reader beware; back up your system to a safe location.
</p>

<h3>Getting unionfs support</h3>
<p>
    Alas, no filesystem unification implementation has made it into the vanilla kernels, 
    and so you have to patch and compile a custom kernel to get the support.
    If you haven't done that before, there is a distribution specific kernel compilation series 
    on <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com">howtoforge.com</a>.
    They run under the title <em>"How To Compile A Kernel - The XXX Way"</em> where XXX is Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.
</p>

<p>
    You can get the patches for unionfs and further documentation at the 
    <a href="http://www.filesystems.org/project-unionfs.html">unionfs project</a>.
    Once you have applied the patch, there is very focused documentation below 
    <code>/linux/Documentation/filesystems/unionfs/</code>. I think <code>concepts.txt</code> 
    and <code>usage.txt</code> in particular give you all the information 
    you need to understand and operate a unionfs, and they aren't too long. 
    You'll need to activate unionfs support by checking <code>"File systems -&gt; 
    Layered filesystems -&gt; Union file system" (UNION_FS)</code> and 
    optionally <code>"Unionfs extended attribute" (UNION_FS_XATTR)</code> 
    next to it, in the kernel configuration. Now, compile and install the new kernel.
</p>

<h3>A New Filesystem Structure</h3>
<p>
    Unionfs hides everything below the mountpoint (like every other filesystem type), so we have to move 
    the stable branch (the <code>/usr</code> dir of the distribution) to another directory, and hide away this fact, by 
    using a bind mount back onto /usr. As you can guess, this will rumble a bit (i.e., you might miss some 
    commands on the way), and is thus best applied from a live distribution of your choice.
    In this example I'll use the following branches:
</p>

<pre>
        /usr                    # the mountpoint for your unionfs
        /usr_stable             # your distro's stable branch (formerly known as /usr)
        /mnt/devel/usr          # your development branch
</pre>
        

<p>
    So, let's assume you are running a live distro and your normal root filesystem is mounted on <code>/mnt/hda1</code>.
</p>

<p>
    1. Rename the stable branch:
</p>
<pre class="code">
            $ mv /mnt/hda1/usr /mnt/hda1/usr_stable
</pre>
<p>
2. Create the mountpoint. You can create fallback links within the mountpoint in case either of the 
       unionfs or the bind mount fails, and a sentinel file which you can check for existence in scripts:
</p>
<pre class="code">
            $ mkdir /mnt/hda1/usr
            $ cd /mnt/hda1/usr
            $ ln -sn -t . ../usr_stable/*
            $ touch YOU_SHOULD_NEVER_SEE_THIS_FILE
</pre>
<p>
3. Then create a bind mount for the stable system.
</p> 
<pre class="code">
            $ echo "/usr_stable  /usr none  bind" &gt;&gt; /mnt/hda1/etc/fstab
</pre>
<p>
Now you should be able to boot into your stable system, and everything should be like before.
</p>


<h3>Boot Script:</h3>
<p>
    The next step is to create a script that checks for a chosen identification string on the kernel command line, 
    and if given, releases the bind mount again and puts the union mount into its place. A call to this script must be inserted into
    the boot process right after the corresponding init scripts have processed <code>/etc/fstab</code> and mounted 
    all the given filesystems. Where and how to insert this script varies among the 
    different distributions; if you don't know, you'll have to consult the
    documentation of your distribution for this. To find the corresponding scripts,
    you can grep for <code>'mount'</code> or <code>'fstab'</code> in the
	<code>/etc/init.d/</code> scripts.
<pre class="code">
            $ grep -Hw -e mount -e fstab /etc/init.d/*
</pre>
    Good candidates are localmount, bootmisc or similar. Look for the <code>'-a'</code> flag to mount.
    In case of Gentoo the right place to insert the call is here (in this
    example the script is called <code>unionmount-usr</code>):
<pre class="code">
    --- /etc/init.d/localmount.orgy 2009-02-15 10:26:22.000000000 +0100
    +++ /etc/init.d/localmount      2009-02-15 10:33:02.000000000 +0100
    @@ -23,6 +23,9 @@ start()
            mount -at "${types}"
            eend $? "Some local filesystem failed to mount"

    +       # conditionally mount development branch through unionfs
    +       /etc/init.d/unionmount-usr
    +
            # Always return 0 - some local mounts may not be critical for boot
            return 0
     }
</pre>

<p>
    Note that for the approach given here to work (unmounting the default bind mount), you can't have 
    another bind mount on /usr_stable (or indirectly on <code>/usr</code>) unless you unmount and remount them too.
</p>

<p>
    Now, the script - this is just a very basic version to illustrate the necessary steps. You might, for 
    example, remount the bind mount if the union mount fails. In general, I like
    to have consistency checker script at the end of the boot process, where
    you can check for different vital things that you don't want to miss.
    Besides checking iptables rules and such, you could also check the
    sentinel file for existence there.
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #!/bin/bash
    # check the kernel command line (/proc/cmdline) for the id-String and if given release the bind mount on /usr.
    # and put the union mount in its place.
    UNION_WANTED_FLAG="UniteWithDevel"      # this is what would be given on the kernel cmdline
    MOUNTPOINT="/usr"
    STABLE_BRANCH="/usr_stable"
    DEVEL_BRANCH="/mnt/devel/usr"
    ERROR_LOG_FILE="/var/log/develUnionFailed.log"

    errorOut() {
        MSG="ERROR ${0} $(date) : ${@}"
        echo "${MSG}" &gt;&amp;2
        echo "${MSG}" &gt;&gt; "${ERROR_LOG_FILE}" 
        exit 88
    }

    wantUnionMount() {
        grep "${UNION_WANTED_FLAG}" /proc/cmdline &amp;&gt;/dev/null
    }

    wantUnionMount &amp;&amp; {
        echo "trying to unite..."
        umount "${MOUNTPOINT}" || errorOut "umounting failed"
        mount -t unionfs -o "dirs=${DEVEL_BRANCH}=rw:${STABLE_BRANCH}=rw" none ${MOUNTPOINT} || errorOut "mounting unionfs failed"
    }
</pre>

<h3>Final Step </h3>
<p>
    Now the final step is to create a boot menu entry which contains the
    <code>${UNION_WANTED_FLAG}</code> from above. You can put any string on the kernel command line (well, 
    maybe any byte value, I guess all ascii-chars, but at least all ascii-alphanum chars)
    and if the kernel doesn't know it, it seems to be silently ignored but
    still appears in <code>'/proc/cmdline'</code> (and in <code>`dmesg | grep 'Kernel command line'</code>)
    So, in the case of the example above, just create a boot menu entry with <code>"UniteWithDevel"</code> on the
    kernel command line and you can boot right into your development work, giving
    you the possibility to replace core system applications and daemons that get started
    by the init process (e.g.: ntp, iptables, sysklogd, etc). E.g:
<pre class="code">
        kernel /boot/unionkern-2.6.27.10/unionkern-2.6.27.10 root=/dev/hdc9 vga=0x31B UniteWithDevel 
</pre>



<h3>Some Unionfs notes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
          Symlinks start a new lookup. If a symlink on a bottom layer links to a
          file that is hidden by another layer, the topmost file is looked up.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
          You are not allowed to have a read-only branch as the topmost layer of a
          read-write-unification. Bummer! That prevents you from operating a
          stable-branch below a read-only devel branch, like you normally would without
          the devel branch (e.g. with the distro's package management system). This would only be accomplished by a
          policy that would deviate from normal mount policies, I guess. (You wouldn't be able to write 
          some of the files, even as root.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Two approaches came to my mind:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make a read-only union and thus prevent any writes. To manage the
                    stable-usr branch, put the bind mount back into place, or remove the
                    devel branch and remount the unionfs as read-write (see below).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put a blank read-write branch on top of the read-only devel branch
                    and capture all writes in this branch. Then use a shutdown script to
                    move possibly written files to the stable branch.
                    This affects only newly created files (or previously deleted and
                    recreated files). 
                </li>
            </ol>

    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
              If you get some error while mounting with <code>-t unionfs</code> (like wrong fs
              type), grep dmesg for the real cause, like:
        </p>

        <pre class="code">
                $ dmesg | grep unionfs
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
          If you remount unionfs, and in particular add or remove filesystems, you
          obviously can't trust the 'mount' output concerning that mountpoint anymore.
		 (Maybe that should be considered a bug?)
    </li>
    <li>
          If you are sure none of the apps on the devel branch are currently
          running, you can probably safely switch in different branches as
          the development branch, thus switching arbitrary versions of an app in and out, while the system is running.
          There are unionfs mount options that add and delete a branch from the union. E.g., you can remove the 
          devel branch and remount it as read-write, then remount
          read-only with another devel branch at the highest level in the stack: 
        <pre class="code">
          mount -t unionfs -o remount,rw,del=${DEVEL_BRANCH}          none ${MOUNTPOINT}
          mount -t unionfs -o remount,ro,add=${ANOTHER_DEVEL_BRANCH}  none ${MOUNTPOINT}
        </pre>
          See <code>linux/Documentation/filesystems/unionfs/usage.txt</code> for more.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Union Mount</h3>
<p>
      There's also an alternative implementation called union mount. For that, see 
      <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/312641/">"Unifying filesystems with union mounts"</a>.
      As far as I know, the corresponding patches are not yet considered stable at this time.
      Unionfs seems like it will never be supported, but the union mount patches will be. 
      See <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/265248/">"Unionfs and related patches pre-merge review"</a>.
      Nevertheless, unionfs is widely used (see 
      <a href="http://www.filesystems.org/project-unionfs.html">here</a>) and 
      I didn't have any problems with it (using xserver and xlib). So until 
      the union mount patches go mainline, unionfs seems to be a good opportunity.
      Obviously union mount would make fs-entries below the mountpoint
      accessible which would eventually obviate some of the steps above,
      making a test run much easier (e.g., you wouldn't have to move
      <code>/usr</code>.)
</p>

<p>
      I have used the term union mount at different places in this text and
      scripts, because it seems to describe what happens. That does not relate
      to the implementation that goes by that name. Everything except
      this paragraph is based on unionfs and <em>not</em> "union mount".
</p>

<h3>Populate</h3>
<p>
    If you have a binary (i.e., pre-compiled) distribution, there are certainly a lot of points to
    consider. Depending on how much "core" your application wants,
    you have to build the application with the right flags in case other apps make use of those features 
    (<code>--enable-this</code>, <code>--enable-that</code> and friends, in case it is based on autotools.) And of course, 
    you have to use the same paths that the installed package uses, to hide all the files in the stable branch.
    Actually you would probably only need to hide entry points for other
    applications, like binaries, headers, libs and such. If there are single
    differences, you can try to hide them by using symlinks at the topmost layer.
</p>

<p>
    So, with binary distributions, it is not that easy - but it is very easy with Gentoo, as Gentoo is
    about building apps from source in the first place. For example: to make
    little modifications to the xserver and try it out, it would only require something similar to this:
<pre class="code">
        $ ebuild /usr/portage/x11-base/xorg-server/xorg-server-1.5.3-r2.ebuild compile
            #... now modify the sources like so:
            $ cd /var/tmp/portage/x11-base/xorg-server-1.5.3-r2/work/xorg-server-1.5.3
            $ sed -i "s/\"(II)\"/\"(I am Bob and I almost completely rewrote the xserver)\"/g" os/log.c
            #... and restart the build process
            $ make
        $ ebuild /usr/portage/x11-base/xorg-server/xorg-server-1.5.3-r2.ebuild install
        $ cp -a /var/tmp/portage/x11-base/xorg-server-1.5.3-r2/image/usr/* /mnt/devel/usr/
</pre>
<p>
    The result would be exactly the same xserver like the one that is in the stable branch
    (if it was of version 1.5.3-r2) but it would show condign respect to your
    accomplishments in the servers logfile. 
</p>

<p>
    Another more useful example: As a non-native English speaker, I sometimes miss words
    from English movies. I like using <em>"kaffeine"</em> to watch movies, but the smallest step to
    skip backward is 20 seconds, which is far too long in response to "Come again?" 
    So, with the steps from the previous example adapted to kaffeine and a bit of source-code 
    browsing resulted in the following patch, which allows rewinding by 5 secs:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    --- kaffeine/src/player-parts/xine-part/xine_part.cpp.orgy      2008-11-10 19:24:18.000000000 +0100
    +++ kaffeine/src/player-parts/xine-part/xine_part.cpp   2008-11-10 19:24:23.000000000 +0100
    @@ -511,7 +511,7 @@ void XinePart::slotPosPlusSmall()

     void XinePart::slotPosMinusSmall()
     {
    -       slotJumpIncrement( -20 );
    +       slotJumpIncrement( -5 );
     }

     void XinePart::slotPosPlusMedium()
</pre>
<p>
    The point is that you can easily modify sources and test the results
    without ever messing up your stable branch. 
</p>

<p>
    <em><strong>Your fully functional stable system is just one reboot away.</strong></em>
</p>

<p>
    As a side note: You can, of course, also use this mechanism to try out
    different versions of an application. Just put a read-write mounted blank branch 
    on top of your read-only mounted stable-branch, and use your distribution's
    package management system to install another, possibly unstable, version
    of that application. If, in the course of that, you want to manage different top level branches,
    you might also consider using "<code>/mnt/devel/usr</code>" as a symlink,
    and let the <code>unionmount-usr</code> script above resolve that symlink
    to the branch you really want, by adding a line like:
<pre class="code">
    DEVEL_BRANCH=$(readlink -f "${DEVEL_BRANCH}") 
</pre>
<p>
    That way you can choose which branch is mounted at bootup by simply
    redirecting the symlink.
</p>

    
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>
    Now, you've probably guessed that I'm quite satisfied with Gentoo - once it's combined
    with a unification filesystem. Once you have set up and
    configured a Gentoo system, and know how to use portage (Gentoo's package manager), 
    updating applications is a no-brainer most of the time. 
    (Big kudos to all the Gentoo developers who make this possible.) 
</p>

<p>
    If you are interested, you can also get an initial binary
    distribution from Gentoo and then still use the source-based package
    manager afterwards on top of the binary packages. See 
    <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a> and 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentoo_Linux">wikipedia:Gentoo</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Then there is Sabayon which is based on Gentoo and also includes a binary package manager 
    but only supports x86 and x86-64 architectures. See 
    <a href="http://www.sabayonlinux.org/">Sabayon Linux</a> and 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabayon_Linux">wikipedia:sabayon</a>.
</p>

<h3>Can it get any better?</h3>
<p>
    Initially I wanted to share my musings about whether it would be possible to bring
    the demonstrated "Populate" approach to binary distribution as a
    distro-independent application. When I wrote the last paragraph I took
    the opportunity to finally have a more thorough look at Sabayon Linux.
    The impression I got is that you can have a more-or-less semi-annually updated binary base
    system while still having the opportunity to use all the versatility that
    Gentoo offers (trying the latest features of bleeding edge apps,
    always have the newest versions of exposed and endangered apps, and of course easily modifying
    selected apps). So, if you don't want to go "all source" you can still try
    Sabayon Linux as a compromise.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any interest in browsing, modifying, and testing open source
    programs, I strongly recommend giving Gentoo or Sabayon a try, getting accustomed to
    the Gentoo build system, and optionally trying a unified /usr-directory.
</p>

<p>
    Again, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to develop and test a program 
    while having a stable system just a reboot away. This makes development
    very pleasant. 
</p>

<p>
    And all the difficulties about dependencies and different build systems 
    are covered by portage. This makes tweaking selected apps very convenient.
