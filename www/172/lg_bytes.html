<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Novell and LPI Partner on Linux Training and Certification</h3>

<p>Novell and The Linux Professional Institute (LPI) have announced an
international partnership to standardize their entry-level Linux
certification programs on LPIC-1. Under this program, Linux
professionals who have earned their LPIC-1 status will also satisfy 
the requirements for the Novell Certified Linux Administrator (CLA)
certification. In addition, Novell Training Services has formally 
agreed to include required LPIC-1 learning objectives in its CLA course
training material.</p>

<p>Adoption of Linux, including SUSE Linux Enterprise from Novell, is
accelerating as the industry pursues cost saving solutions that deliver
maxiumum reliability and manageability. A 2009 global survey of IT
executives revealed that 40 percent of survey participants plan to deploy
additional workloads on Linux over the next 12-24 months and 49 percent
indicated Linux will be their primary server platform within five
years.</p>

<p>"This partnership represents the strong support the LPI certification
program has within the wider IT and Linux community. This historical
support has included contributions from vendors such as Novell and has
assisted LPI to become the most widely recognized and accepted Linux
certification," said Jim Lacey, president and CEO of LPI. "We look forward
to working with Novell to promote the further development of the Linux
workforce of the future. In particular, by aligning its training and exam
preparation curriculum to support LPIC-1 objectives, Novell has recognized
the industry's need for a vendor-neutral certification program that
prepares IT professionals to work with any Linux distribution in an
enterprise environment."</p>

<p>Under the terms of the agreement, all qualified LPIC-1 holders - except
those in Japan - will have the opportunity to apply for Novell CLA
certification without additional exams or fees. Novell Training Services
will include LPIC-1 objectives into its Linux Administrator curriculum and
programs which include self study, on demand, and partner-led classroom
training.</p>

<p>More information about acquiring dual certification status can be 
found at Novell here: <a href="http://www.novell.com/training/certinfo/cla/">http://www.novell.com/training/certinfo/cla/</a> and at 
the Linux Professional Institute here: <a href="http://www.lpi.org/cla/">http://www.lpi.org/cla/</a>.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">RHEL 5.5 Beta Available</h3>

<p>Red Hat has announced the beta release of RHEL 5.5
(kernel-2.6.18-186.el5) for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 family of
products including RHEL 5 Server, Desktop, and Advanced Platform for x86,
AMD64/Intel64, Itanium Processor Family, and Power Systems
micro-processors.</p>

<p>The supplied beta packages and CD and DVD images are intended for
testing purposes only.   Benchmark and performance results cannot be
published based on this beta release without explicit approval from
Red Hat.</p>

<p>The beta of RHEL 5.5, called Anaconda, has an "upgrade" option for an
upgrade from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.8 or 5.4 to the Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux 5.5 beta.  However Red Hat cautions that there is no guarantee the
upgrade will preserve  all of a system's settings, services, and
custom configurations.  For this reason, Red Hat recommends a fresh
install rather than an upgrade.  Upgrading from beta release to the GA
product is not supported.</p>

<p>A public general discussion mailing list for beta testers is at:
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhelv5-beta-list/">https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rhelv5-beta-list/</a>
The beta testing period is scheduled to continue through March 16, 
2010.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SimplyMEPIS 8.5 Beta5</h3>

<p>MEPIS has announced SimplyMEPIS 8.4.97, the fifth beta of the forthcoming 
MEPIS 8.5, now available from MEPIS and public mirrors. The ISO
files for 32 and 64 bit processors are SimplyMEPIS-CD_8.4.97-b5_32.iso 
and SimplyMEPIS-CD_8.4.97-b5_64.iso respectively. Deltas, requested by the 
MEPIS community, are also available.</p>

<p>According to project lead Warren Woodford,  "We are coming down the home
stretch on the development of SimplyMEPIS version 8.5. There is some work
to be done on MEPIS components, but the major packages are locked in to
what may be their final versions. We've been asked to make more package
updates, but we can't go much further without switching to a Debian Squeeze
base. Currently, we have kernel 2.6.32.8, KDE 4.3.4, gtk 2.18.3-1,
OpenOffice 3.1.1-12, Firefox 3.5.6-2, K3b 1.70.0-b1, Kdenlive 0.7.6,
Synaptic 0.63.1, Gdebi 0.5.9, and bind9 9.6.1-P3."</p>

<p>Progress on SimplyMEPIS development can be followed at
<a href="http://twitter.com/mepisguy/">http://twitter.com/mepisguy/</a> or at <a href="http://www.mepis.org/">http://www.mepis.org/</a>.</p>

<p>ISO images of MEPIS community releases are published to the 'released'
subdirectory at the MEPIS Subscriber's Site and at MEPIS public 
mirrors.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Tiny Core Releases V2.8</h3>

<p>Tiny Core Linux is a very small (10 MB) minimal Linux GUI Desktop. It
is based on Linux 2.6 kernel, Busybox, Tiny X, and Fltk. The core runs
entirely in ram and boots very quickly. Also offered is Micro Core a 6
MB image that is the console based engine of Tiny Core. CLI versions
of Tiny Core's program allows the same functionality of Tiny Core's
extensions only starting with a console based system.</p>

<p>It is not a complete desktop nor is all hardware completely supported.
It represents only the core needed to boot into a very minimal X
desktop typically with wired Internet access.</p>

<p>Extra applications must be downloaded from online repositories or
compiled using tools provided.</p>

<p>The theme for this newest release is to have a single directory for
extensions and dependencies. This greatly improves systems resources
by having a single copy of dependencies, also greatly improves
flexibility in "moving" applications present upon boot, dependency
auditing, and both batch and selective updating.</p>

Tiny Core V2.8 is now posted at
<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/tinycorelinux/2.x/release/">http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/tinycorelinux/2.x/release/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ksplice "Abolishes the Reboot"</h3>

<p>Ksplice Inc. announced its Uptrack service patching service in
February, eliminating the need to restart Linux servers when
installing crucial updates and security patches.</p>

<p>Based on technology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Ksplice Uptrack is a subscription service that allows IT
administrators to keep Linux servers up-to-date without the disruption
and downtime of rebooting.</p>

<p>In 2009, major Linux vendors asked customers to install a kernel
update roughly once each month.  Before Uptrack, system administrators
had to schedule downtime in advance to bring Linux servers up-to-date,
because updating the kernel previously required rebooting the
computer. By allowing IT administrators to install kernel updates
without downtime, Uptrack dramatically reduces the cost of system
administration.</p>

<p>Ksplice Uptrack is now available for users of six leading versions of
Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, Debian GNU/Linux, CentOS,
Parallels Virtuozzo Containers, and OpenVZ. The subscription fee
starts at $3.95 per month per system, after a 30-day free trial. The
rate drops to $2.95 after 20 servers are covered.  A free version is
also available for Ubuntu.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">MariaDB Augments MySQL 5.1</h3>

<p>MariaDB 5.1.42, a new branch of the MySQL database - which includes
all major open source storage engines, myriad bug fixes, and many
community patches - has been released.</p>

<p>MariaDB is kept up to date with the latest MySQL release from the same
branch. MariaDB 5.1.42 is based on MySQL 5.1.42 and XtraDB 1.0.6-9.

interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in
MariaDB.</p>

<p>MariaDB contains extra fixes for Solaris and Windows, as well as
improvements in the test suite.</p>

<p>For information on installing MariaDB 5.1.42 on new servers or
upgrading to MariaDB 5.1.42 from previous releases, please check out

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Moonlight 3.0 Preview Now Available</h3>

<p>The Moonlight project has released the second preview of Moonlight 3.0
in time for viewing the Winter Olympics.  The final release will
contain support for some features in Silverlight 4.</p>

<p>Moonlight is an open-source implementation of Microsoft's Silverlight
platform for creating and viewing multiple media types.</p>

<p>This release updates the Silverlight 3.0 support in Moonlight 2.0,
mostly on the infrastructure level necessary to support the rest of
the features.  This release includes:</p>

<ul>
<li> MP4 demuxer support. The demuxer is in place but there are no
codecs for it yet;<br /></li>
<li> Initial work on UI Virtualization;<br /></li>
<li> Platform Abstraction Layer: the Moonlight core is now separated
from the windowing system engine. This should make it possible for
developers to port Moonlight to other windowing/graphics systems that
are not X11/Gtk+ centric;<br /></li>
<li> New 3.0 Binding/BindingExpression support.</li>
</ul>
