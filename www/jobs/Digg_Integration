Research creating a "Digg this article!" button for each LG
article/discussion.

http://digg.com is a community-rating system for Web content - basically
a way for people to say, "hey everybody, check out this cool new thing
I've found!" The more people "digg" an entry, the higher it goes on the
list - and the more people read it. Very cool effect, somewhat /a la/
Cory Doctorow's "whuffie" concept (see http://www.google.com/search?q=define:Whuffie).

Time commitment:
	Research phase: (estimated) Less than an hour
	Scripting / template update: 1-2 hours
