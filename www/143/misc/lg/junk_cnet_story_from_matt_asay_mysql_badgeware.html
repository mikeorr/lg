<p>
Lawyer, ex-badgware firm Alfresco executive, and OSI Board member Matt
Asay writes a "NewsBlog" at CNet news.com, in which he comments on open
source.  A couple of days ago, that column published a compendium of
whoppers[1], attempting to accuse open source users of hypocrisy.
</p>

<p>
Quoting key parts:
</p>

<p>
  The open-source community's double standard on MySQL
  posted by Matt Asay
  [...]
</p>

<p>
  Remember 2002? That's when Red Hat decided to split its code into Red
  Hat Advanced Server (now Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and Fedora. Howls of
  protest and endless hand-wringing 
  [<a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513-5102282.html">http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513-5102282.html</a>] ensued:
</p>

<p>
  Enter 2007. MySQL decides to comply with the GNU General Public
  License and only give its tested, certified Enterprise code to those who
  pay for the service underlying that code (gasp!). Immediately cries of
  protest are raised [<a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/118489">http://www.linux.com/feature/118489</a>], How dare 
  MySQL not give everything away for free?
</p>

<p>
  Ironically, in this same year of 2007, SugarCRM received universal
  plaudits (from me, as well) for opening up _part of its code base_ 
  under GPLv3. Groklaw crowed
  [<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20070725161131598">http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20070725161131598</a>], 
  "SugarCRM Goes GPLv3!" People everywhere flooded the streets to wax 
  fecund and celebrate by multiplying and replenishing the earth.
</p>

<p>
  [...] I'm criticizing the open-source community for applying a
  hypocritical double-standard.
</p>

<p>
No, Matt.  Sorry, you lose.
</p>

<p>
First, the ZDNet link you cited simply did <em>not</em> feature even one
member of the Linux community being quoted as criticising Red Hat in any 
way, let alone failing to comply with GPLv2 or any other open source
licence -- for the simple reason that Red Hat didn't violate any 
licence, and in fact has published full source code RPMs for the full
software portions of RHEL, downloadable free of charge and fully
accessible to the public (which is far more than the licences require).
</p>

<p>
(RHEL includes two non-software SRPMS that contain trademark-encumbered
image files.  People who wish to have non-trademark-encumbered RHEL 
can create same by using different image files in their place, or can 
rely on CentOS et alii's ongoing work in doing exactly that.  I've
previously pointed this set of facts out to Matt directly, on an occasion
when he attempted to defend his own firm's then-usage of badgeware
licensing through the tu-quoque fallacy of criticising Red Hat.)
</p>

<p>
Likewise, the linux.com story you cited concerning MySQL AB's cessation of
offering source tarballs to the general public (though public access
to the SCM repository will remain) does <em>not</em> feature even one cry of
protest -- for the simple reason that MySQL AB is still offering a
fully, genuinely open source product.
</p>

<p>
(Accordingly, Matt's assertion about whom MySQL AB will "give its
tested, certified Enterprise code to" is simply false.)
</p>

<p>
Last, even Matt's third example, about SugarCRM, Inc., is crooked:
Matt's phrase "part of its code base" refers to the <em>entirety</em> of 
SugarCRM Community Edition, which in its entirety was formerly under the
deceptive, proprietary badgeware "SugarCRM Public Licence" (a licence
Matt's firm Alfresco also used, and pushed hard but unsuccessfully for 
OSI to approve), and which in its entirety was recently converted to
GPLv3.
</p>

<p>
Hypocrisy?  I think Matt's heard of the concept, but seems to have
misremembered where he saw it.

don't go there and help drive up their advertising revenues by posting
long analyses of why he's wrong, etc.  Companies like CNet specialise
in professional trolling, deliberately riling up tempting targets such
as open source users, to drive up hit count.  As a general rule, you 
want to avoid posting <em>anything</em> to such publications' "feedback forums" 
merely because some author has said something idiotic:  That just
rewards them for trolling.  Instead, please post critiques to <em>your</em> own 
Web space, or maybe as _Linux Gazette_ articles.
