The often quoted segment from the lilo readme is sort of backwards in both

I have installed RH's 8.0.  I'll have to admit I'm in Windows at the moment.

<P>
'sokay, that's fixable :&gt;  Or if you get really tricky you can convince
a good copy of <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A> to use the Windows setup, and run mswin apps even
when you are in Linux.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Also the e-mail program that came with 8.0 that isn't connected to a
browser retrieved my mail, but wouldn't, couldn't send my mail.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
That's probably:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Fetching mail from another serv explicitly (via POP3) works.  (This is
common.  Your ISP did all the work setting up and keeping that POP
server, your mailer just visits it once in a while.)
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
Sending mail outbound, no SMTP server is found to talk to.  (There are
a few browsers which will "speak SMTP" on their own, but they are not
very good mailers on the average, for other reasons.)
</P>
<P>
Adding an SMTP server to your setup is usually quite easy;  look for an
RPM package named any one of sendmail, qmail, or postfix.  (but you only
want one of them.)
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">and I forgot to mention that if your ISP actually gives you the explicit
address of an SMTP server to use, say, mail.isp.example.com, then you
could try telling that to your mailer, rather than worrying about
setting up your own.

<P><STRONG>
You lost me on the KPPP Tool and Linux.  Linux is an OS, right?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Indeed.  Thus the term "Linux Answer Gang", you see.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Now, where did I get your address?  I asked some friends about how to
get my telephone to operate through the PC.  One person sent me a
forward with "The Answer Guy" and the address.  I believe it to have
been a page from an old site that contained pertinent information, but
not the site itself.  Does this help?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Not nearly as much as it would if you inquired with that person and
tracked down the "old site" for us.  That would be much appreciated, as
we continue to be deluged with misdirected non-Linux queries.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I am self-taught, so do not confuse me with high-altitude techtalk,
just the facts.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Self-taught was at one time the only way to learn Linux, back when many
of us got started with it, so we sympathise, and now attempt to assist
others while, as we say, "Making Linux just a little more fun".
</P>
<P><STRONG>
What is my best approach for learning a program language?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, first you'd have to install a Linux distribution, of course.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Strictly speaking, most of these languages are available for Windows
too, but some of the mswin implementations may be less than perfectly
portable, or the documentation may suggest non-portable over portable
coding strategies.  Go for dual booting, perhaps.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
You'll find that it comes with an amazing variety of programming
language development kits, from C, C++, and Python through tk/tcl,
Java, Lisp, and heavens knows what else.  I personally maintain a list
of Integrated Development Environment software for Linux, here:
<A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/#idedev"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/#idedev</A> .  As you'll see, the list has
grown to pass 100 entries.
</P>
<P>
How you would proceed from there would depend on which type of
programming language you'd like to use, and what you want to do with it.
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
Rick Moen

Is it possible for me to run Routing Protocols(ospf,BGP,rip) on my
Linux Box connected to an ISP (through cable modem) and obtain all the
network (including subnetwork ip pool)ip pool range of my ISP.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[JimD] 
Look for GNU Zebra: <A HREF="http://www.zebra.org"
	>http://www.zebra.org</A>
It's considered to be the best available package for Linux, and
has (I'm told) syntax that's reasonably similar to Cisco's IOS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[someone else in the Gang expands] 
Of course you can!  This is not your grandpa's operating system, here.
OSPF v. 2 and BGP4/4+ are both supported by either the gated daemon or
the GNU zebra daemon, both of which should be standard on your Linux
distribution.  Zebra can also do pretty much every variety of RIP (v.1,
v.2, and RIPng).  The standard old routed (prounounced "route-dee")
daemon can do RIPv1, and gated can do RIPv2.  (gated will also do EGP,
thrown into the bargain.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for replying. But what I wanted exactly to know is that
should I need any kind of details from the ISP (like Router ip,ASN...)
or any permission from the ISP for my LINUX Router to have a OSPF
session with
the ISP Router.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I'm not able to verify this; it could just be the same problem as in
Konqueror 2.x, where the SSL support is a seperate package

Galeon and Mozilla will work, but you need to d/l the Personal Security

I've been looking around and can't find the info I need. How do I
configure Linux to run headless with a terminal connected to a serial
port?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Not quite headless, with a serial terminal connected.  I choose to
call the condition "nearly headless", after the phantom named
"Nearly Headless Nick" in the Harry Potter series.
</P>
<P>
Take a look at:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Documentation/serial-console.txt
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
in the kernel source.  This won't get you quite everything you'd
get from a console connected.  In particular, you don't have access
to the BIOS.  But if you can get past that, you're pretty much
there.  You can even tell LILO to use the serial port, as described
in the documentation file.  No doubt there's also a GRUB option
for serial console, if that's the boot loader you're using.
</P>
<P>
As I understand it, there's at least one card which will even
make the BIOS available via a serial port.

Though you never mentioned what your video card was, I will respond since I
was having a similar problem with Mandrake Linux 9.0 on my home-built
machine. I was getting lockups all the time and yet I could ssh into the box
from another machine and see that everything behind the scenes was still
running fine. Just X froze, but it also meant that I could not kill it with
CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE. I happened to have an ATI Xpert 2000 video card (Rage
128 chipset). The ONE item that fixed it was that the card does not seem to
handle DRI properly. I commented out the line in my XF86Config file that
said: load "dri", restarted X and I never saw the problem again. Perhaps
your problem is similar.

<P><STRONG>
after using linux for several years now on i-586 I tried to install it
on my imac-g4.  the problem: I do not get X to run, because of my
NVIDIA GeForce4 MX.  I am using debian woody for ppc and don't find
any hints in the net.  can anybody send me a working XF86Config for
XFree 4.1.0 or any other help.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It looks like you'll need XFree86 4.2.0 or later, and will have to use
the "vesa" driver (not the "nv" driver) in 16-bit mode, which is the
only one supported thus far.
</P>
<P>
As you may know, these things do tend to happen with newly introduced
video chipsets, and Nvidia have unfortunately been notably uncooperative
with the XFree86 Project.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">That they didn't buy into the XFCom release sequence (compatible
binaries, source eventually committed to the open source X code tree) and
want to roll their own we can understand; but they have to keep up with
the Xfree86 codebase or it makes them look slow.  And act slow, if one has
to back down to the generic servers in order to work...

<LI>Use a Tom's Root/Boot floppy.

<LI>Burn a bootable CD with the Tom's Root/Boot "El Torito" boot image
	 (and your new kernel, etc. in all that other CD-R space)

<LI>Use the ifconfig and route commands (on just about any rescue
	 CD or floppy) to manually configure your network, then fetch

If you want to repartition without losing data, GNU Parted is a great
tool. Details at:

You can also use fdisk or diskdruid but both will destroy the data after
repartitioning. These two should be installed by default in most of the
distributions.

<P><STRONG>
Friends,
Last week I posed a question for booting with 3 OSes. Thank U.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here I again partitioned ... [lots of stuff about prepared system]
I am trying boot from boot
disk. It is coming upto "localhost login:" after which GUI screen be
displayed. It displays the localhost login: prompt for a second or a half
and then hangs. I thought its a problem with monitor sync values. Mine was
samsung's samtron 56V model. But in the list specified - no exact match
for it. So I opted for the default given (unprobed type)and modified the
sync values with the ones given in my monitor manual. (My friends who have
already loaded windows, have not even changed the sync values). One of my
friend got the same problem. But his system didn't hang but it flashes
between blank screen and the text based localhost prompt.
</STRONG></P>

I'm not sure, but if he means that his computer used to handle the voice
lines in his office (and yes, there are such things, which have some
cute GUI app to configure them) ... then he may want to play with the
program Asterisk, and maybe the hardware "LineJack" or "PhoneJack" by
Quicknet, which are telephony cards you add to a computer.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If he just means that his computer needs to reach the internet, then
it's true we have a bunch of dialer-helpers (KPPP is one of the better
ones; xisp and a few others are out there) ... but he will still need
to know some basic things like his ISP's phone number, the username
he was assigned, and maybe some connection features like whether they
use PAP or CHAP to identify him.

Unfortunately this code is not close to what the querent was after.
He actually wants to have his program do something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br> 	if my input/output is a tty then:
<br>		if my tty is an inet domain socket then:
<br>			ask the socket for the remote (source) ip address
</font></code></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... which will involve the isatty(3) library function and the
getsockname(2) system call (and some other structs and munging).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There's an example of the code for this in Wietse Venema's
TCP Wrappers sources for tcpd.  That code is quite portable, well
testing (running on almost all mainstream Linux boxes for about a
decade, as well as most BSD systems, and many others.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your code relies on details about how a given system might be
logging connections via syslog/klog or similar externalities, and
it's inherently a race (other connections may be logged between the
time the message gets put in the dmesg ring buffer and the time when
his code is scheduled to run).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm not much of a C programmer.  I've done a little, even having written
a simple kernel device driver that's in production use.  However, I
rely very heavily on reading examples of similar code.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In general when looking for how to do something like this (figure out
the remote system's IP address from one of your file descriptors) I
try to think about which programs on my system must be doing something
similar.  Sometimes I run the similar program under strace, even ltrace
for some hints. Then I grab their sources and read up on it.  (Usually I
can use a man -k or two to make a pretty good guess at which library
functions or system calls are involved, even without an strace).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
George, I hope you don't think I'm being hard on you.  I realize that
tech support, particularly trying to help people with programming
questions, is difficult.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dave, I hope this helps.  I'm assuming you can figure out the actual
code on your own.  One reason I display my ignorance by telling
people <EM>how</EM> I discovered whatever I'm suggesting is to "teach the

hadn't ever noticed it until I did a man -k socket while writing this

After soo many years have I waited to use Linux as my principle OS as we
both know how much problems we have to go through with Microsoft. I've
waited for years for Linux to be user friendly and finally our prayers have
been answered. I have over twenty machines in my department and soon if I'm
able to resolve some of the problems with software compatibility and
substitutes. I would probably migrate everyone of us to Linux from Windows.

Quite a big confession that. Would other sysadmins be as honest and
own up?!

<P><STRONG>
I had Windows 2000
with Outlook 2000 and it worked perfectly. Now that I have installed <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>
Linux workstation, I successfully connected to the server via DHCP and I can
easily surf.  But what I can't do is check my email through Ximian Evolution
Email Service. My domain is MARS and the server name is MAIN. In exchange,
we have IMAP4 and POP3. In Linux, I tried to configure the Ximian Evolution
as <TT>IMAP.MAIN.COM</TT> and <TT>POP3.MAIN.COM.</TT> Ofcourse we don't have extranet so we
can't browse through the Browser. It doesn't work. I even tried my login
name with the hostname and it still doesn't work. Can you help me ?

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
Obviously you have confused Win NT domains with DNS domains. To have a
DNS domain (which you don't seem to need since you have no extranet)
you need to have an authoritative DNS name server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If your entire network is only served through Win NS you should check
up the documentation on Samba to configure your machine as a Win NS
client. You can stick with localhost.localdomain for your DNS name
unless you want to be more imaginative!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Halb] 
Maybe you should look into Ximian Connector, it will enable to use
Evolution as a complete Exchange client. Ximian will be happy to sell
you these at $69.00 a piece, but this sholud not be a real problem for a
company....... if this is the solution to your problem. Maybe Kapil Hari
Paranjape's answer is more the direction you should be looking at.

Hi there, I was wondering if you could help me out here. I have a dual boot
system running XP and red hat 8.0. I have just recently installed red hat
and am finding a few problems whilst setting up the system. My computer has
2 physical hard disks (primary master, and secondary master) the first
(hda1) has that nasty windows thingy on it (I left the file system as fat32
so I could go back to 98se if need b). Hda2 has red hat on. I can mount and
access hda1 when in Linux, but I cannot access my second (fat32) hard drive
at all. I have all my operating systems and software on the first hard drive
and all my work on the second, so this is starting to wind me up a bit now!
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">It's not entirely clear if he can still see that work drive from
Windows;  if he can, Halb's probably right.  John K's hints are good
before someone starts setting up, so people can have better results.
It may also be worth noting that hda2 is the second partition on the
first drive;  a second drive on the same IDE chain would be hdb, and
its partitions also numbered, so maybe he just needs to mount /dev/hdb1
as well.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Halb] 
By the look of things I would say you have NTFS on your second
Harddrive. This is common behaviour on M$ machines becouse FAT23
partition sizes are artificialy restricted to 32 Gigs ( not that big for
nowaday harddrives) M$ will automagicly change to NTFS, this might be
the reason why you are not able to mount it. This presumes that you have
made all the correct entries in your <TT>/etc/fstab.</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[John] 
My guess is that perhaps you lost your fat32 partition on the 2nd hd.  How
did you set up your partition(s) on hda2 when installing RH8?  The
recommended method would be something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockQuote><ul>
<LI>back up the existing partition if it contained anything of interest


<LI>use a non-destructive method of dividing the 2nd hd into multiple
partitions (e.g., GNU parted, fips, Partition Magic - there are several
to choose from).


<LI>install Linux on a newly-created partition on hd2
</ul></blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
also when I re-start my computer I need to mount the hda1 each time. Any
help would be greatly appreciated.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Halb] 
here you can make an
entry for <TT>/dev/hda1</TT> like this or whatever your liking is:

ISO9660 is the file format used for CD-ROMs, named after the International
Standards Organization's standard that defines it.  "ISO" is sometimes
used as an abbreviation.  Whether that's the format <EM>your</EM> file is in is
a different matter; it could be anything.  The .iso extension isn't
universal like .txt, .html, .jpg, etc.  What does the "file" command
say about your file?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Assuming the file <EM>is</EM> really an ISO9660 filesystem image, you can write
it directly to a CD and then either read the CD or boot from it.
You'd write the image using "cdrecord" on Linux
or one of its GUI front-ends like KOnCD in <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>.  Skip the first step
(making an image file from a directory hierarchy) because you already
have the image.

ISO files are binary versions of CDs.  If you were to copy a CD byte for
byte (NOT file for file), you would have an ISO file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
[Dreamgazer] 
and how can I open them without copying to cd
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I found out how to do this in Linux I was <EM>so</EM> impressed with Linux!
Let's say you have a directory called <TT>/mnt/my_iso</TT> and your ISO is called
<TT>/home/Dreamgazer/my_iso_file.</TT>  You can mount the ISO
with the command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop=/dev/loop1 /mnt/my_iso /home/Dreamgazer/my_iso_file
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
and then you can access any of the files in the ISO by going to the
<TT>/mnt/my_iso</TT> directory!  Cool, eh?!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's see Windows do <EM>that</EM> !
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Actually, just saying -o loop is enough; iso9660 defaults to read-only,
and you don't have to tell it which loop device comes next, it can
figure it out all alone.  I loopback mount CD images a <EM>lot</EM> myself.
I have to make sure not to run out of loops available.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Iron] 
It may fail for many reasons such as loop device busy (choose another
loop device <TT>/dev/loop*</TT>), your kernel not having loop device support, the
<TT>/dev/loop*</TT> files not existing, etc.  When you've finished inspecting the
files under <TT>/mnt</TT>, do:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>umount /mnt
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
to unmount the image (note the command name has one "n" instead of two).
See "man mount".  A couple details:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>You may be able to just use "-o ro,loop" instead and let it choose an
unused loopback device, see the manpage for details.


<LI>The manual says it's more convenient to mount and unmount loopback
devices if /etc/mtab is a regular file and not a symbolic link to
/proc/mounts.  That answers another question The Answer Gang was unsure
about a couple months ago, whether you lose anything by symlinking the
two together.  (What you gain by symlinking them together is that
/etc/mtab -- and thus what "mount" without options reports -- will
always be up to date.)

A free trial of mswin software that will let you open, create, and extract
(we guess this means "view the filesystem inside of")  ISO files.

You need a user account for the host you want to login to.
The server should be accessible over SSH (normally TCP/22), and should have
X11 forwarding configured.

Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I live in LaGrange, Missouri. I have downloaded the iso's for

Mandrake 9.0. I have installed it once. I then took it off to have
Windows again.

My brother had a Linux Router, and I wanted it to act as
a server, but he said it wouldn't.

Your brother is deluded

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
But I have a second computer in my
room. I want to add this behind my dad's desk with a 5' network cable,
instead some more 100' cable to run to my room. I wanted to know a good
app to run a remote desktop connection on it. I have downloaded one
program called X-Win 32.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
"A good app" -- well that depends on what you want the
server to do. Your server, once it is up and running
can support (amongst others): file serving, print
serving, webserver, phpserver, mysql server, mail
serving, etc...................
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">If you find you don't like that one, there arre a few other X servers
mentioned in
"(#tips.19)Remote X over ssh"
above.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I have Windows XP on my main computer. It has a
remote desktop built in.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">The open source client for that protocol is called rdesktop:
<A HREF="http://www.rdesktop.org"
	>http://www.rdesktop.org</A>
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">But I don't know if anything on Linux serves that protocol so the
windows remote-desktop client can view it.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">VNC is another possibility, and may be needed if you want to share
the desktop with more than one person - here's a KDE remote sharing
project that uses it:
<A HREF="http://www.tjansen.de/krfb"
	>http://www.tjansen.de/krfb</A>
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
I also wanted to know if it had to have a
keyboard, mouse, and monitor hooked up to it at all times, even though I
will have some sort of remote desktop app.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank You,
<BR>Brandon Dean
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
Nope, my 486 Server has no monitor, keyboard or mouse,
since during the odd occassion that I have to log into
the server, it is done via SSH which I can run from
the command-line.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Although if your using Windows, then I suggest the use
of "putty.exe".
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">This is also mentioned in the
"(#tips.19)remote X over ssh"
tip.
For occasional access over a serial cable, see the
"(#tips.6)headless server"
tip.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">As long as your BIOS is happy when you don't have these things,
