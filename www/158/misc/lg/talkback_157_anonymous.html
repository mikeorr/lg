Hello,
</p>

<p>
The article on Ubuntu and Keymap blues is (IMHO) too heavy
on opinion and too sparse in solutions. Here are some more detailed
comments:
</p>

<pre>
1. The author drops openSUSE because of KDE 4.1 and feels that
   openSUSE's support for Gnome is poor. So on to Ubuntu, only
   to worry about the <strong>console</strong> keymap. This is surely odd as
   one can use a terminal inside Gnome and configure its
   keymap using X or gconf or whatever.
 
   By the way the author talks about text-mode keymap when what is
   meant is the vt-console keymap.
 
2. The author could have consolidated the complaints about
   console-tools in one place and then gone on to explain how kbd is
   better and can be configured. Instead we have few hints on how to
   (for example) configure kdb to use the Dvorak keyboard (a problem
   stated at the beginning) and lot of complaints about differences
   between console-tools and kbd keymappings for function keys.
 
3. A sample keymap which is "sized down" and <strong>does</strong> fit the author's
   needs would have been a good attachment to the article.
 
4. The author ends with "However, to make them consistent, you need
   consensus." I would add that "To obtain consensus, you need a good
   consistent solution to all the woes of the Linux console." Is the
   author willing to propose such a solution?
</pre>

<p>
A bit annoyed-ly,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

<p>
Those are not fungible.
</p>

<p>
I have no comment on your other criticisms, but the author struck me as
making a vital point about conole keymaps having been given short shrift in
Ubuntu.  Working as a sysadmin, one finds that non-X11 console can be
really crucial.  It's important that text consoles not be messed up, and
disturbing that a modern Linux distribution would not bother to get it
right.  (One would be driven to wonder what <em>other</em> *ix fundamentals
they shipped in a malfunctioning state.)

<p>
I agree that a working terminal emulation on the vt-console is
crucial. However, I would be satisfied with a good dependable VT100
emulation.
</p>

<p>
I also agree with the author that a broken SysRq setup is going to
cause pain when you least need it.
