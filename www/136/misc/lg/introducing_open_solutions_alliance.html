Today's volleys in the licensing war.  Note that Timothy McIntyre 
is corporate counsel for one of the "Exhibit B" firms.  Earlier I 
"outed" him as a paid flack for one of the interested parties (a fact he
nowhere mentioned, at the time) when he posted his ostensibly personal
opinion that Socialtext's GAP licence [sic] should get OSI approval
because Attribution Assurance License had, earlier -- a non-sequitur
argument, and one that ignored AAL's clear violation of OSD#10, adopted
after AAL's approval.

</pre>
Back in mid-December, when discussion of Socialtext's Generic
Attribution Provision and "Exhibit B" clauses got going and I'd posted a
couple of initial comments (e.g., that the wording of Exhibit B clauses
seemed to stand in the way of code reuse), I was surprised to find Brian
Behlendorf querying me in offlist mail about my reaction to such
clauses.  Brian's a good guy, and I was glad to give my assessment (that 
there was nothing inherently wrong with forced advertising clauses per
se, that the OSD#10 gaffe needed to be fixed, and that intrusion on reuse
in commerce has to be minor enough not to violate OSD#3&amp;6) -- but found
the experience odd.  For what reason was I being so promptly sounded out
in private?
</p>

<p>
Brian was of course one of OSI's founding Board members.  Lately, I'm
pretty sure his main concern has been Collab.net.
</p>

<p>
I noticed recently that on February 15, at a panel discussion at the
OpenSolutions Summit in NYC, Brian, representing Collab.net, is going to
be introducing to the world a new "trade association", the Open
Solutions Alliance (OSA), about which curiously little is being said
except that it will be "focusing on business use of open source apps",
and "not as a standards body, but more like a Good Housekeeping Seal of
Approval thing.".  Robin Miller has an interesting article about it:
<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/03/1737253">http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/03/1737253</a>
</p>

<p>
Business use of open source apps is of course a very good thing.
However, somewhat disturbingly, the main backer of the OSA, and owner of
its OpenSolutionsAlliance.org domain, appears to be yet another
proprietary Web 2.0 company posing to the public as an open source firm:
Dark Horse Ventures, LLC of Norfolk, Virginia, DBA CentricCRM.
</p>

<p>
CentricCRM publishes a "Community Edition" that is professed to be open
source, but after you download it (which is possible only after
registering and logging into their site), key code turns out to be under
the "Centric Public License" (CPL), which is of course proprietary and
used as an inducement to get people to buy separate commercial-use
licences.
</p>

<p>
CPL itself can be viewed here:
<a href="http://www.centriccrm.com/ProjectManagementFiles.do?command=Download&amp;pid=56&amp;fid=344&amp;view=true">http://www.centriccrm.com/ProjectManagementFiles.do?command=Download&amp;pid=56&amp;fid=344&amp;view=true</a>
</p>

<p>
I note that the "Exhibit B" firms make a habit of using the concept of 
open source as "a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval thing", and have
seemed allergic to the concept of submitting their in-use licences to
the applicable standards body.  Coincidence, or the upcoming vehicle for
further circumvention of OSI scrutiny?

Subject: Attribution &amp; the Adaptive Public License
</pre>
As the OSI community considers approving a new "attribution" license, 
there's a key point that I think has been lost in the shuffle.  In 2005, 
the OSI approved the Adaptive Public License as satisfying all 10 
requirements of the OSD.  The APL includes a specific attribution 
provision.  It says:
</p>

<p>
"As a modest attribution to the Initial Contributor, in the hope that 
its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort 
invested in writing the Initial Work, the Initial Contributor may 
include in *Part 2 of the Supplement File* a requirement that each time 
an executable program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent 
Work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent 
display of the Initial Contributor's attribution information must occur 
(the "*ATTRIBUTION INFORMATION*"). The Attribution Information must be 
included at the beginning of each Source Code file. For greater 
certainty, the Initial Contributor may specify in the Supplement File 
that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable 
program resulting from the Initial Work or any Subsequent Work, but not 
a program dependent thereon. The intent is to provide for reasonably 
modest attribution, therefore the Initial Contributor may not require 
Recipients to display, at any time, more than the following Attribution 
Information: (a) a copyright notice including the name of the Initial 
Contributor; (b) a word or one phrase (not exceeding 10 words); (c) one 
digital image or graphic provided with the Initial Work; and (d) a URL 
(collectively, the "*ATTRIBUTION LIMITS*")."
</p>

<p>
--APL, section 3.10(a).
</p>

<p>
This OSI-approved attribution provision is quite broad.  It can apply to 
<strong>every</strong> executable program that results from the Initial Work or any 
Subsequent Work, regardless of whether such work is distributed or not.  
In addition, it can be applied to a program that is dependent upon the 
Initial or Subsequent Work.  Finally, it necessarily complies with OSD 
section 10, because the APL was approved in 2005, after section 10 was 
added to the OSD in 2002.
</p>

<p>
I bring this up because I've seen a lot of discussion / debate on this 
mailing list about which flavor(s) of attribution should be considered 
OSD-compliant, and I think the APL is a useful point of common reference 
and can help light the way.  To ignore the APL when deciding whether to 
approve any "attribution" license would risk muddying the water even 
further, IMHO.  What's that Bob Marley line?  "If you don't know your 
past, you don't know your future?"

It is a good point.  One thing about the wording is that it says it may 
not require more than...  One could argue that an attached provision 
could de-open source it.  Though the license is approved and allows 
exactly this kind of adware provision. 
</p>

<p>
Do you think SocialText would be willing to add this to their GAP 
supporting arguments page?  If not I again suggest that I'd be happy to 
help organize a paper on our wiki supporting the provision (even though 
I am not for the last version that was submitted and this form of adware 
generally).

Thanks for bringing this up.  I now recall the initial SocialText email
briefly mentioning it.  Interestingly, it seems APL itself was lost in
the shuffle when originally under consideration.  Russ said
(<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/license-discuss">http://www.mail-archive.com/license-discuss</a> at opensource.org/msg07431.html),
"Unfortunately, even after two tries there have been insufficient
comments on the Adaptive Public License.  Maybe the third's the charm?"
</p>

<p>
Later, it was forgotten for a year or so before Russ reported that the
committee recommended approval
(<a href="http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?3:mss:9268:apdpdalipapaedpgofih">http://www.crynwr.com/cgi-bin/ezmlm-cgi?3:mss:9268:apdpdalipapaedpgofih</a>).
</p>

<p>
I may be wrong, but in all that time it never seemed that anyone
considered the OSD #10 implications, so it seems a hazardous precedent.
</p>

<p>
  It says:

However, it is not so broad as GAP was in other ways.  Most importantly,
it didn't require keeping the same size.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I'm afraid you're putting a bit too much faith in OSI.  It
necessarily was approved after OSD #10; that <strong>should</strong> mean it complies
but may not.  I don't think it does for much the same reasons I've
explained elsewhere.  It doesn't allow for headless applications and
presents problems with command-line applications and such.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I bring this up because I've seen a lot of discussion / debate on this
&gt; mailing list about which flavor(s) of attribution should be considered

</pre>

<p>
I don't know about everyone else, but I've been discussing whether GAP
<strong>is</strong> compliant, not whether it should be.

<p>
A valid point, and thank you for bringing APL up.  However, OSI doesn't
have stare decisis.  It can certainly learn a lesson occasionally.

The Kremlinology around this is no doubt entertaining, but there's less 
here than might meet the eye.  I'll be moderating a panel on it next week, 
and by then CollabNet might be a member.  But I'm neither driving this nor 
introducing it personally.  I'd prefer to be able to name those who I know 
are involved, but since they've clearly wanted to wait until next week for 
the launch, I want to respect their wishes.  The only reason to keep that 
list secret is to be able to launch a set of names at once rather than 
dribble them out piecemeal as that might imply that the project is owned 
by one outfit or another.
</p>

<p>
The linux.com article got it right as far as I know - the focus is both 
promotion of open source business apps (as distinct from most of the rest 
of the advocacy today, which is around operating systems or developer 
tools &amp; frameworks) and on interoperability between them.  The first one 
is important - lots of us are gonna get creamed by the Sharepoint 
steamroller unless there's a message that makes sense for a certain kind 
of IT purchaser.  The second one is more important to me, though - it's 
just too hard, today, to get different web-based applications to work 
side-by-side for a single organization, unified in permissions management, 
search, user interface, avoiding duplication of function, and all that. 
Without the independents trying to standardize on a few things, only the 
monolithic players will win, which would suck.
</p>

<p>
The topic of not-OSI-approved-licenses hasn't yet come up in conversations 
I've been a part of, but I've only been a part of a few.  I would expect 
it to be a major topic after it's launched, though, as it directly relates 
to both purposes for the organization.  I've been very vocal in other 
settings (including here on this list) that one shouldn't even use 
little-o little-s "open source" to describe your software or initiative 
unless you're talking about an OSI-approved license - let alone Big-O 
Big-S "Open Source".  I don't see this outfit as being a trademark as 
enforcement organization the way that OSI should be, but nor do I see it 
condoning the kinds of behavior that have been mentioned on this list.
</p>

<p>
So don't expect "dazzling plans and a knock-your-socks-off marketing 
program on February 15".  Expect an exhibition of a list of companies 
interested in addressing the kinds of problems and willing to put a few 
coins and person-hours towards that.  Where it goes from there is anyone's 
guess.

I'm sorry you feel that way, and certainly meant no offence:  I mostly
noted the primary OSA backing (and presumable founding membership) from
Dark Horse Ventures DBA CentricCRM, whose supposedly "open source"
licensing is extremely and categorically proprietary by basically
anyone's standards, including (say) John Roberts / SugarCRM.  You say
you don't approve of that sort of behaviour, and I certainly believe you
-- and yet you're running the panel discussion that announces the trade
group's existence to the world?  I don't quite get that -- but look

My wife has a standard old joke about the Non Sequitur Society.  
(Their motto:  "We don't make much sense, but we do like pizza.") 
If there is such a group, just wave a printout of the above reasoning; 
I think you just aced their entrance exam.
</p>


<p>
Seriously, it's not difficult to make a fair case for existence of a
legitimate need for <em>some</em>, properly drafted "attribution" (mandatory
runtime credits) licence for Web apps and similar hosted code.  Here,
please let me show you how it's done:
</p>

<p>
Whether you as the creator of a Web application think there's a problem
_at all_ depends on whether you merely want credit (attribution)
included in the program output of works you create and distribute, or
whether you also wish to require all subsequent derivative works to
display that same output.  If the former, rejoice!  Just put insert your
copyright notice and publish using your choice of simple permissive
licence (BSD, etc.).  Anyone wanting to know who wrote Web app Foo need
only look closely at it, from that point forward.
</p>

<p>
(So, please, folks, spare us the bafflegab rhetoric about how your
badgeware clauses are supposedly necessary for "attribution".  They're
clearly not.)
</p>

<p>
The hitch comes when you're interested in shaping how derivatives behave
but find yourself having no leverage -- a problem known among copyleft
partisans as the "ASP Loophole".  Let's say you're SugarCRM, and your
biggest concern is proprietary competitor Salesforce.com.  If you
publish your CRM app's source code under any of the OSI-approved open
source licences (either permissive or copyleft), Salesforce.com could
lawfully scoop up your source code, modify and extend it to suit that
firm's needs, and use it to compete with the SugarCRM company, <em>without</em>
the displayed program output even revealing to customers and other
outsiders that it's re-using SugarCRM's work.
</p>

<p>
This is presumably exactly what Dave Rosenberg (MuleSource) had in mind
when he said
<pre>
   We have run into multiple issues with public and private companies 
   who have made attempts to skirt the MPL/MSPL/maybe anything and
   essentially take Mule as their own with no recognition of the author,
   copyrights, license agreements etc. Forking is one thing, stealing is
   another.
</pre>
Just to stress that I do try to listen fairly:  I do agree, Dave.  
It's a real concern.
</p>

<p>
Without something <em>like</em> MuleSource Public License 1.1.4's Exhibit B, 
third parties could take downloadable copies of Mule ESB and run it or a
derivative behind closed doors but usable over the Web, and not only
never publish their changes but also conceal <em>completely</em> their use of
MuleSource code.
</p>

<p>
Web apps and similar ASP (application service provider) software (AKA
"SaaS" = Software as a Service) are characteristically subject to this
problem, as re-users neither incur copyleft obligations nor need
distribute code at all:  Their model entails private code use only, with
only the <em>output</em> of execution displayed in public, rather than
redistribution of code itself.
</p>

<p>
Notice that copyleft provisions, if present, tend to have no traction
for lack of code redistribution.  Several new licences, none yet OSI
approved, have attempted to retrofit that traction.  One is Funambol's
(Fabrizio Capobianco's) Honest Public License = HPL [1].  Similar and
slightly gentler is the Affero Public License = APL[2].  And last, there
are the still-unfinished GPLv3 drafts.[3]  
</p>

<p>
Aside:  It strikes me as very odd that all 20-odd "Exhibit B" badgeware
companies (MuleSource and others) elected to hang their clauses off a
copyleft licence (Mozilla Public License) whose copyleft provisions
inherently have _zero force_ in their (and their competitors')
no-distribution ASP usage model.  Isn't that a bit like requiring
spelunkers to wear sunscreen?  Don't they realise that about 3/4 of
their chosen licence is a <em>NO-OP</em> for their entire market segment?
</p>

<p>
In sharp contrast to the MPL + "Exhibit B" licences with their ASP
Loophole-disabled copyleft provisions, HPL, APL, and the GPLv3 drafts 
have, by design, copyleft features that remain <em>functional</em> in ASP
markets.
</p>


<p>
But getting back to the point, the "Exhibit B" clauses do address the 
entirely real ASP Loophole concern for Web apps -- but do so in a clumsy 
fashion that impairs reuse; in particular, commercial reuse.  For the
most part, this seems to be quite deliberate, for reasons already cited.
Add to those the trademark clauses of most Exhibit B sections, e.g.:
<pre>
   This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
   "MuleSource", "Mule" and the "MuleSource", "Mule" logos even if such
   marks are included in the Original Code or Modifications.
</pre>
Aside from Larry Rosen's point in this space, that "forking is always
allowed for open source software regardless of the trademarks it bears,
but the licensor should fear that his trademark will become useless [RM:
i.e., generic] if he requires it to be displayed on those forks"[4],
don't trademark clauses such as the one quoted above look a whole lot
like efforts to curtail third-party use in commerce?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, closing the ASP Loophole if you <em>don't</em> care about functional 
copyleft obligations is pretty easy, and doesn't require mandating 
a bunch of graphical advertising shoved into every user's face, each and
every time the application is launched.  The alternative has been
mentioned here before:  It's a simple About screen, that is required to
be available from the main display.  To ease OSD#10
technological-neutrality concerns, make it be required only where the
derivative has program output and be in whatever supported format best
approximates the desired name + logo + URL display.  E.g., for a
derivative with only spoken-word output for the blind, that "About"
information could then reasonably be the spoken name of the firm + URL.
</p>

<p>
We've not yet seen such a licence.  If these 20-odd firms really care
about "attribution" and aren't after mandatory advertising, I'd suggest
that we really should.
</p>

<p>
I'd be glad to write one, as a substitute Exhibit B.  The above almost
qualifies by itself, I'd imagine.  (Unlike the ones we've seen thus far,
with the honorable exception of GAP, mine would aspire to be templated
and usable by anyone.)
