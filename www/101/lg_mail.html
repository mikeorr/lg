Hi, unfortunately I often have trouble decyphering <EM>all</EM> that information
that you poured into such a well thought out e-mail. You obviously spent a
lot of time thinking about your problem, listing all the symptoms, etc.
You should give yourself credit for it.

Here's a tip though:

Oh, if you send HTML e-mail to this list again, there's a high chance

The computer using today has Microsft ME os,  I cannot send any info to
you from my linux PC, as when I loaded the upgrade mandrake 10.0 on top
of my Mandrake 9.2-( purchased from Mandrake central USA} when after
some time(I thought it had installed 10.0) it returned to the welcome
desktop screen, from there it is completely frozen, the mouse, the arrow
keys , tab key and function keys, so restart many times( by power off
and on only,my only option at the moment} I arrive each time to this
situation, I cannot get to bios settings  to change device priority for
startup. to use  a boot disk or floppy.

[THomas] 
Presumably you managed to boot off of a CD just fine. In that case, I
suggest (no, I urge you) to download knoppix [1] and boot from that. If
you  have not the facilities to burn CDs, then find someone who can. Why
exactly can't you access your BIOS?

I purchased Mandrake 10.0 from
Linuz.org in USA  they sent two cd's by airmail  without any other info
except invoice.

Also, as this is Mandrake, I suggest when you next boot into Linux, you issue:

The book I used wqas "Running Linux", Matt Walsh, et al. Publsihed by
O'reilly. You'll find it on amazon no problems.

[Heather] 
The book I got started with was "Unix as a Second Language" by Sobell,
which has now become several books, for different flavors of UNIX.  The
current one of the Linux flavor shows a penguin belly flopping down a
snow bank 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

hour ...  Any of the series though, will definitely make your starting
out a little more fun.

Readers: more good book suggestions?

There's some dark chocolate waiting in the Answer Gang's back lounge for
new folk inclined to send in their good tips or a nice long chat about
how some useful part of Linux really works.   You don't have to join the

Glad you liked my .sig.

including the Sesame Street ones. Even have some mpeg's of them, such as two
aliens and a hippie singing "Manomonot" on the Muppet Show, as well as the
Intro to the Fraggle Rock show -- in Swedish (I think - it's called
"Fragglarna".)
</P>
<P>
IIRC, I saw a similar 1337 .sig on <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A> or somewhere a few years ago,
and adapted it for the Muppets.  I got a real charge out of seeing it posted
in LG.Net (twice now, no less!) and the response it generated.  LOL.

Hi, Gianfranco -

I'm not Heather, but I'm the fellow who receives mail at the editor@

I lost contact to Stephen Bint who used

to him are bouncing.

Please be so kind and let him know

Thank you very much.

Stephen Bint was never a member of The Answer Gang; he wrote a couple of
articles for LG. I'm afraid we have no way to contact him beyond his
email, and given his own statement of his lifestyle:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Stephen is a homeless Englishman who lives in a tent in the woods. He eats out
of bins and smokes cigarette butts he finds on the road. Though he once worked
for a short time as a C programmer, he prefers to describe himself as a "keen
amateur".
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
- losing track of him is not an unlikely occurence. I'll CC Heather on
this, but I doubt that she'll be able to help you any more than I could.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Presuming that he occasionally sneaks into a cybercafe to read <EM>LG</EM> and
write an article now and then, we'll pub the request in the <EM>Gazette</EM> and

visible.  I apologize in advance if the spambeasts find it too.

<P>
Hi all,
</P>
<P>
I spoke with Thomas on IRC last night about this but it was late and I'm
not sure I made myself clear.
</P>
<P>
I'd like to be able to read the lg on my palm device. Now I know I can
click the TWDT link on the front page of the site, whereupon some magic
cgi-bin foo generates a pdb file for me to download. I guess this is
taking the text version of TWDT and generating the pdb on the fly?
</P>
<P>
My question is this. That process is fine and dandy for the current
release, but I'd like to read older issues on my palm. Can the pdbs be
made available on the ftp site?
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
linuxgazette.net doesn't have an FTP site.  It now uses a portion of
the website for tarball downloads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The biggest issue with putting Palm-format files in that directory is
they will be picked up by the mirrors.  We'd have to check with the
mirrors whether the bandwidth/size would be a hardship.  We also look
at how widely used the files would be.  The tarballs can be used on any
platforms with any OS.  Palm files work only with certain brands of
palmtops and exclude everything else.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
Hence I agree that generating them on-the-fly (talking of that,
congratulations, Ben!!) is a far better thing to do.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Actually, AFAIK, the Palm Reader is available for several different
platforms; certainly for Wind0ws, WinCE and both of the Linux distros
made for the iPaq. However, I agree that we shouldn't clutter our
tarballs with these things; that was the point of doing this stuff "on
the fly" for the folks who want it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I could convert the files myself I suppose which would probably involve
lynxing the TWDT text version of the file and then using "some tool" to
generate the pdb from the .txt file. However I just wondered if as that
particular wheel has already been invented, it might save some work?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Cheers,
Al.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Nope, there's nothing set up. I'd suggest grabbing "bibelot" from
<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A> and converting whichever TWDT you'd like. Here's the simplest
way I can think of:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
lynx -dump -nolist <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/issueXX/TWDT.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issueXX/TWDT.html</A>|bibelot -f -t twdtXX.pdb
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
where XX is the number of the issue. If you wanted to do a bunch of them
in one shot, you could even do a "for" loop:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>for n in `seq $first $last`; do ... done
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
where $first and $last would delimit the range of issues that you want to convert.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Sure, and I wasn't suggesting that you should add pdb to the tarball or
the ftp server, just asking if the process is already there to generate
pdbs, why not make it available for back issues too?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hence me saying why reinvent the wheel.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I don't have a problem downloading the TWDTs and converting them, just
thought it would be easier to use whats already there.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Cheers,
Al.
</STRONG></P>
