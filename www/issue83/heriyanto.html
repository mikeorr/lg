<DIV>
This article will provide a guidance to create your own Makefile. The article will 
explain why we need a Makefile and will also list several things we
should consider in creating a Makefile. 
</DIV>
<P>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Imagine you are developing a program called <TT>foo</TT>, which consists
of five headers, that is <TT>1.h</TT>, <TT>2.h</TT>, <TT>3.h</TT>,
<TT>4.h</TT>, and <TT>5.h</TT>, six C-language source code files
named <TT>1.cpp</TT> to <TT>5.cpp</TT>, and a <TT>main.cpp</TT> file
(Remember: we do not recommend to use such file naming scheme in the real
life).

<P>
Suppose you find a bug in <TT>2.cpp</TT> and has fix it.
In order to get a new <TT>foo</TT> program, you have to recompile
all files, header and source code, even though you just change one
file. This is not a fun job, waiting for the computer to finished its
process compiling your program. Particularly if you don't have fast computer.

<P>
What can you do then? Is there any solution for this problem ?

<P>
Please do not worry my friends. That kind of problem has already been
experienced by our fellow computer hackers years ago. To tackle this
problem, they have developed a program called <TT>make</TT>. Instead
of build all of the source codes, this program will only build
source code that has been changed. If you change file <TT>2.cpp</TT>, then <TT>make</TT>
will only build it. Isn't it fun?

<P>
The followings are several other reasons why we need <TT>make</TT> [<A
 HREF="#lpu">2</A>] :

<UL>
<LI>A software project which consists of many source codes, can have
complex and long compiler commands. Using <TT>make</TT>, it can be reduced.
</LI>
<LI>Programming project sometimes need specialized compiler options
that are so rarely used they are hard to remember; with <TT>make</TT>
this can be reduced.
</LI>
<LI>Maintaining a consistent development environment.
</LI>
<LI>Automating the build process, because <TT>make</TT> can be
called easily from a shell script or a cron job.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Why Do We Need a Makefile?</A>
</H1>

<P>
Although <TT>make</TT> is very useful, it cannot do its job
without the instructions given by us, the programmer. <TT>make</TT>
instructions is stored in a text file. This file is usually called
<B>makefile</B> and contains commands that must be processed by
<TT>make</TT>.

<P>
This file is normally named <TT>makefile</TT> or <TT>Makefile</TT>. As a
convention, GNU programs named their makefile, <TT>Makefile</TT>, because
it is easy to see (if you do "ls" then this file is usually always on
the top of the list). If you give it another name, just make
sure you include option <TT>-f</TT> to <TT>make</TT> command in order
to let it know that you use it.

<P>
For example, if we have a makefile named <TT>bejo</TT>, then the
command we use to instruct <TT>make</TT> to process that file is :

<PRE>
make -f bejo
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Makefile Structure</A>
</H1>

<P>
A makefile consists of <I>target</I>, <I>dependencies</I> and <I>rules</I>
section. Dependecies are things or source code needed to make a target;
target is usually an executable or object file name. Rules are commands needed to make
the target. 

<P>
Following is a simple description of a makefile :
<PRE>
target: dependencies
	command
	command
	...
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
An Example of Makefile</A>
</H1>

<P>
The following is a simple makefile example (line numbers added for the article):

<P>
<PRE>
1 client: conn.o 
2	g++ client.cpp conn.o -o client
 
3 conn.o: conn.cpp conn.h
4   g++ -c conn.cpp -o conn.o
</PRE>

<P>
In the makefile above, dependencies is line contained <TT>client:
conn.o</TT>, while rules is line contained <TT>g++ client.cpp conn.o -o
client</TT>.  Note that <EM>every rule line begins with a tab, not
spaces</EM>. Forgetting to insert a tab at the beginning
of the rule line is the most common mistakes in constructing
makefiles. Fortunately, this kind of error is very easy to be
spotted, because  <TT>make</TT> program will complain about it.

<P>
Detail description of the makefile depicted above are as follows :

<UL>
<LI>Create an executable file named <TT>client</TT> as a target, which
depends on file <TT>conn.o</TT>
</LI>
<LI>Rules to create the target are in line 2.
</LI>
<LI>In the third line, to make target <TT>conn.o</TT>, <TT>make</TT>
needs files <TT>conn.cpp</TT> and <TT>conn.h</TT>.
</LI>
<LI>The rules to make target <TT>conn.o</TT> are in line 4.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
Comment</A>
</H1>

<P>
To give a comment in makefile, merely put '#' in the first column of each line
to be commented.

<P>
Below is an example makefile that has already been commented :

<P>
<PRE>
# Create executable file "client"
1 client: conn.o
2   g++ client.cpp conn.o -o client

# Create object file "conn.o"
3 conn.o: conn.cpp conn.h
4   g++ -c conn.cpp -o conn.o
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Phony Target[<A
 HREF="#gnum">1</A>]</A>
</H1>

<P>
A phony target is a fake filename. It is just a name for commands that
will be executed when you give an explicit request. There are two reasons
for using phony target : to avoid conflicts with a file with the same
name, and to enhance the makefile performance.

<P>
If you write a rule whose command will not create a target file,
those commands will be executed every time the target is remade. For example:

<P>
<PRE>
clean:
	rm *.o temp
</PRE>

<P>
Because the command <TT>rm</TT> will not create a file named <TT>clean</TT>,
that file will never exist. Command <TT>rm</TT> will always be executed
every time you called <TT>make clean</TT>, because <TT>make</TT>
assume that the <TT>clean</TT> file is always new.

<P>
The above target will stop working if a file named
<TT>clean</TT>  exists in the current directory. Because it does not require
dependencies, file <TT>clean</TT> will be considered up-to-date, and the
command 'rm *.o temp' will not be executed. To resolve this problem, you can explicitly
declare a target as phony, using special target command <TT>.PHONY</TT>. For example :

<P>
<PRE>
.PHONY : clean
</PRE>

<P>
In the makefile above, if we give instruction <TT>make clean</TT> from
the command-line, the command 'rm *.o temp' will always be run,
whether or not a file named <TT>clean</TT> exists in the current
directory.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Variable</A>
</H1>
To define a variable in a makefile, you can use the following command:
<PRE>
$VAR_NAME=value
</PRE>

<P>
As a convention, a variable name is given in uppercase, for example :
<PRE>
$OBJECTS=main.o test.o
</PRE>

<P>
To get a varible's value, put the symbol $ before the variable's
name, such as :
<PRE>
$(VAR_NAME)
</PRE>

<P>
In makefile, there are two kinds of variables, <I>recursively
	expanded variable</I> and <I>simply expanded variable</I>. 

<P>
In the recursively expanded variable, <TT>make</TT> will continue expanding
that variable until it cannot be expanded anymore, for example :
<PRE>
TOPDIR=/home/tedi/project
SRCDIR=$(TOPDIR)/src
</PRE>

<P>
SRCDIR variable will be expanded, first by expanding TOPDIR variable.
The final result is <TT>/home/tedi/project/src</TT>

<P>
But, recursively expanded variable will not be suitable for the
following command :
<PRE>
CC = gcc -o
CC = $(CC) -O2
</PRE>

<P>
Using a recursively expanded variable, those command will go to endless
loop. To overcome this problem, we use a simply expanded variable :
<PRE>
CC := gcc -o
CC += $(CC) -O2
</PRE>

The ':=' symbol creates the variable CC and given its value "gcc -o".
The '+=' symbol appends "-O2" to CC's value.

<P>

<P>
I hope this short tutorial will give you enough knowledge to create
makefile. Until then, happy hacking.
