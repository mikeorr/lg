Just wondering if you can point me to any good web resources on what
laptop hardware is currently supported under linux. What I've been able
to find are how-to's (as in how to install linux on a laptop. And these
seem to be out of date. You can't even buy the models listed anymore.)
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Alternatively you could cheat, and buy a laptop from a vendor that sells
laptops pre-loaded with Linux...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Distros have gotten better about being able to be installed on a laptop;
the rise of laptops with accessible CD bays has helped a lot too.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The important thing to know is that you should consider your parts of
hardware <EM>individually</EM> when looking at buying a laptop.  Model names and
numbers themselves are immaterial, except that those may make it easier
to find fellow users of the same hardware.  Yes, the same real manufacturers
sell through many vendors, with the exception of a few giants like Sony and
IBM that build their own stuff.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
USB
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
pretty much no problem.  The command 'lspci' can tell you if you have UHCI or OHCI,
then you can load up the right one and rock on.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Infrared
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Find out what chipset it has (this is harder than it looks, just
"fast" doesn't cut it).  Linux supports several but to get Fast IR
you need to know which kind, and it needs to be one of the small
handful we handle.  Mobilix has good info.

Mouse
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
luckily most mice are just PS/2;  there are a few synaptics style
touchpads out there, that have a PS/2 compatible mode anyway.  Those
"jogdial" things Sony has need a special program, but we have one.

... and now those of the USB variety are available.  I have been using one
for the past few months, since I purchased a Dell Inspiron.  This allows
using an external keyboard which helps to make the laptop a better
replacement for a desktop.  That way I can use both an external mouse and
keyboard, and still have the serial port free for an external modem should
I choose to use one.

Video card
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you're planning to slash the bleeding edge, you really have to
be sure on this one.  It's one of the parts you cannot easily
replace!  Note that some manufacturers throw their own cheap X
servers together - check into them further and see if they are
going the XFCOM route (which eventually leads to the source being
merged with XFree, when the card is yesterday's news) or staying
proprietary.  And whether they need a kernel module to support GL
and/or acceleration.  (hey, that'd be sweet.  But I wouldn't bet
on finding that.)  If you're a gamer, check if the video has proper
texturing support.  Many don't.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Also, X 4.1 is getting there, but there still might be a few cards
better supported under X 3.3.6.

For libvga I always recommend trying the VESA setting before giving
up.  And setting the VesaSave value to a different number can help
solve if it's coming out with a text mode that puts your cursor below

I had a rough time with the Inspiron - the only way I could get X to work
was by DL'ing the XF86Config file from the mfr's Internet site; and I have
yet to get it to work for other resolutions than 1400 x 1050.  Even though
they offer several to cover various resolutions, they did a very poor job
- some were just duplicates under different names.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Be careful of the ATI r128 chip series.  There are around 10 different
variations of that chip, designated as r128 SM, r128 RE, etc., and they
are not compatible; so check the X docs to verify that the chip is
supported - or better yet verify that the chip is indeed the same as one
of the models mentioned on one of the Linux laptop sites, i.e. that it
has not been changed by the mfr for the currently shipping models.

ATI is actually rather infamous in the community for generating
new troubles with every minor BIOS and circuitboard revision.
That problem is not at all limited to laptops

Your monitor
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Sounds odd, but yes, this needs to be considered seperately.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Try to get X modelines from someone else who has the same screen.
They don't need to be from the same distro, and in fact, you can
steal modelines from an XF86Config that's meant for version 3 and
use them on version 4 just fine.  You <EM>cannot</EM> steal the whole file
and use it though - the format has changed a bit.  Put your modelines
in the Monitor section, in either case.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Sound
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You actually have a pretty good chance here.  So far lspci has always
been good for me at coughing up what chipset the sound is, and after
that it's easy to look up.  (This doesn't work on older models that
have ISA sound, but you're talking about new machines here.) The
important tidbit is, there are three different ways to get sound
support working, and you only need one of them to work.  In order of
preference, it can be a normal kernel module, the ALSA project
probably has drivers for you, or you can use OSS.  <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> makes sound
setup easy.  Your distro may vary.

Ethernet
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Usually isn't much of a problem.  lspci should tell you what it is,
then just load the right module.  In fact lspci is usually better
than the box for telling what's in it;  many manufacturers are
licensing chipsets these days.

<blockQuote>
If you have a builtin modem...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Ouch.  Most of these are winmodems, er, 'scuse me, "controllerless".
In other words they are born missing one or two of the three core
chips that make a real modem work.  For anyone who's been under a
rock for the last few years, that means that they are "easily
upgradable" but also cheap and prone to breaking down under heavy
CPU load.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I list the ones mentioned at linmodems.org here, because many of
the projects have moved recently.  The linmodems links still work
too.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Don't be afraid to buy a PCMCIA card to replace these.  Nobody
will blame you.  But <EM>do</EM> check the resources at linmodems before
buying a card - some folks have been burned by PCMCIA softmodems,
those pretty much don't work for us.

<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

In my case, I had to DL the pcmcia pkg from the 'net and install it
separately after installing SuSE 7.1 due to a quirk with the newer TI
PCI4451 PC card Cardbus Controller chip that the machine uses.  Trying to
use the SuSE packaged version would hang the machine.  This was explained
in one of the pages about my machine referenced from the harker site.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Also, one can check the docs that are pkg'd with the pcmcia stand-alone
pkg.  There has in the past been a document included which lists the cards
known to work, with the caveat that card mfr's sometimes change the chips
inside the cards without changing the model designation - it's rare but
not unheard of, so you can find yourself with a card that doesn't work,
even though it's on the compatible list.  I've had pretty good luck with
Xircom in the past - a CEM33/10 and a CEM56/100 which both have a full
modem implementation rather than a winmodem (the only people who 'win' are
the mfr and Microsoft

<LI>For Motorola's SM56 they have shut down making softmodems, but still
provide the driver.  They built it under RH 7.1 so use a 2.4 kernel.
You can consider this modem doomed, since it's a binary driver and
Linus has long since stated that binary only drivers will be allowed
to break and no kernel developer will ever cry a tear about it.

<LI>Lucent's Microelectronics Group has been spun off to be called
Agere Systems, and they have a page with sources now, as well as
pointers to packages for a handful of distros. Use this for anything
calling itself an LTmodem, which may include some Xircoms.  There are
also other projects playing with LTmodems as their target hardware (see
the linmodems page), so you have more than one thing to try too.  At
least this modem will work.

best chance of working under Linux.

Dell was shipping two versions which they were designating as mini-pci
3com ether combo cards.  The one that was shipped in my machine is known
under the name of Actiontel, and has an LTModem paired with an Intel
eepro-100 ethernet chip - luckily for me both components are Linux
compatible; probably because they were offering machines pre-installed
with Linux.  They have since changed their policy and are no longer
offering pre-installed Linux, except on their servers.  Consequently they
are now shipping one of the modem chips mentioned above, which people
don't seem to having much luck with, and many have bought a pcmcia card to
use instead.  However, there are two items of interest in this regard,
IMO:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>many of the pcmcia cards seem to run quite warm, even hot - especially
the ether / modem combos cards, which adds extra heat to your laptop, and
also means more battery drain.


<LI>many laptops are implementing the ether / modem combo cards for the
mini-pci slot connector which is also being offered on many desktop style
mobos.  This connector very much resembles the one used for the type of
memory module (so)dimms currently being used.  Thus if desired it is
possible to purchase one of these from an after market 3rd party and
replace an incompatible card with one that is Linux compatible.

Oh, probably.  But if you have a feature listed that you're
wondering about, try Google! Linux (<A HREF="http://www.google.com/linux"
	>http://www.google.com/linux</A>
- and do NOT put a slash on the end) and type in the buzzword
or chipset.  Chances are good you'll find something on it.

... not too much!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Just one more thing.  We need to make the hardware co's more Linux
cognizant.  Be sure to mention that you're buying the machine because you
have reason to believe that it is Linux compatible, and if it wasn't you
wouldn't be purchasing from them!  Also mention any items that you know
not to be compatible, such as the winmodem.  Express your interest that
they consider increasing their Linux support in the future.
