<h1>GRUB, PATA and SATA</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a></b></p>

<h3>1   The Problem</h3>

<p>
Start your search engine and search for the following
keywords both on the Web and in the newsgroups:
</p>

<pre>
GRUB SATA confused
</pre>

<p>
You will get reports galore of GRUB failing with SATA, most
certainly failing when facing a mix of old IDE (PATA) and
new SATA disks. I'm submitting this as evidence, but I
personally don't need any, since GRUB cost me some 10 hours
of toiling in exactly this context.
</p>

<p>
You will find less evidence for Lilo, but Lilo will also
fail. Xandros 4.0, which relies on Lilo, gave me a bad time.
Further, Lilo is on its way out; the major distros rely on
GRUB.
</p>

<p>
So what is to be done, if you have a mix of PATA and SATA, and
want to have a few GNU/Linux distros ready to boot, and need
to have Windows anyway? Repeat after me: <em>do not install GRUB
to the Master Boot Record on the disk carrying the Windows C
partition.</em>
</p>

<p>
It is assumed the problem does not stem from the hardware,
because there are indeed mobos with both SATA and PATA, and
are able to handle them together.
</p>


<h3>2   Accessing the GRUB boot record</h3>

<p>
If we write a GRUB boot record to a partition, how do we
activate it? Not from GRUB's Master Boot Record (MBR); we
don't have one, given our earlier decision. The options are:
</p>

<p>
    (i)     from Windows's MBR
</p>

<p>
    (ii)    from a real floppy, from a (DOS floppy emulation)
            CD, or from a (DOS floppy-emulation) USB stick.
</p>

<p>
Although frequently recommended, (i) is not a solution. You
will fail if you install GRUB to a boot sector, extract that
boot sector to a file, and append an entry for that file in
boot.ini: It will not work with a mix of PATA and SATA.
Something else is needed.
</p>

<p>
Maybe you belong to the lucky ones who never had problems
with GRUB. Otherwise, here follow solutions A and B, for your
attention. They will work in most cases, but still there
might be hardware constellations where they will fail. There are
too many variations to test, and I certainly do not have
access to the hardware.
</p>

<p>
The instructions given here target Windows XP. They can
probably be adjusted for Vista.
</p>


<h3>3   Terminology</h3>

<p>
Some terminology first. Under Windows, the boot drive is the
one that carries <code>boot.ini</code> and the loader, <code>ntldr</code>. The system
drive is the one that carries the Windows directory. They
can be different, although often they're not. We say
"boot directory" to indicate the directory containing
<code>boot.ini</code>. For Windows XP, the boot partition has to be the
first one seen by the operating system - with the drive
letter C slapped on it. Apparently, Vista accepts any
partition, and just re-arranges the drive letters.
</p>

<p>
When installing or restoring or updating your Linux distro, make
sure that the Master Boot Record for the Windows boot drive
is not touched. If it is, you will have to go through some
rescue operations. That MBR is reserved for Windows - and GRUB
should keep its GRUBby fingers off it. Let it install a boot record
to the boot sector in the partitions - e.g., to /dev/hda4 - but
never to /dev/hda.
</p>

<p>
Be aware that the installation routine may seem set to
comply with your instructions, but then it may go ahead and
modify the MBR anyway. It's difficult to say whether the blame is
with GRUB directly or with the install routines, but it happens.
Be ready for a fight, be ready for emergencies. You might even
consider trying the following trick: let the boot record be
installed to a floppy, then do everything else by
hand. The trick works even if there is no physical floppy.
</p>

<p>
The trouble stems from one simple fact: when GRUB starts
from the Master Boot Record and is showing its menu, it sees
the available devices in an order which <em>may</em> differ from
the order it sees after launching <code>initrd</code> and then the
kernel. In other words, its device map changes on you
without any warnings or compliments. After activating
the required entry from the menu, all hell breaks loose because
essential files are not found. I.e., kernel panic.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu is trying to handle the problem using UUIDs for the
hard disks. UUID means Universally Unique IDentifier, and is
intended to be the immovable rock in the sea storm of boot
loader, <em>initrd</em>, and kernel. So you will see Ubuntu's GRUB
configuration showing lines like:
</p>

<pre>
    kernel /vmlinuz root=UUID=f0bfe866-2449-4d75-8222-b444ff564876
</pre>

<p>
Long story short - it does not help. This is my empirical
finding. Some theory from Linus Torvalds himself:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/65209/">http://lwn.net/Articles/65209/</a>
</p>


<h3>4   Method A</h3>

<p>
Method A uses the 'hide/unhide' feature in GRUB, to hide away
all boot partitions that are contributing confusion - in the
extreme case, all boot partitions but the one that has a
specific operating system. At that moment, there can be no
confusion in the device map, since only one entry is left.
</p>

<p>
This approach is explained here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.justlinux.com/forum/showthread.php?t=143973">http://www.justlinux.com/forum/showthread.php?t=143973</a>
</p>

<p>
It is based on a GRUB floppy, either as a real floppy or as a
floppy image burnt to a CD. It is not quick to set up, since
it requires extensive trial and error but - to be fair - the
other method is not much quicker.
</p>

<p>
Note that with this method, when you are running a distro,
Windows may be hidden away. If you want to transfer files
from the distros to Windows, you will have to have a FAT
partition accessible at all times - or have access to Linux
file systems from Windows (available only for ext2/ext3, as
far as I know).
</p>


<h3>5   Method B</h3>

<p>
Go and download a modified version of GRUB, including <code>grldr</code>
(mnemonics: 'grub loader'). Put <code>grldr</code> in c:\ and add the
following line to <code>boot.ini</code>:
</p>

<pre>
    c:\grldr = "sundry distros"
</pre>

<p>
You also need GRUB's <code>menu.lst</code> in the same directory. Edit it
as appropriate for each of your distros, and you are done.
</p>

<p>
Fine - but what is <code>grldr</code>, and where do you get it from? <code>grldr</code>
is a GRUB console that gets along with Windows booting, and
weighs less than 190K. It is part of a free software project
with a puzzling name:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://grub4dos.sourceforge.net/">http://grub4dos.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p>

<p>
You really only need that one file, <code>grldr</code>; the adventurous
can play around with the rest.
</p>


<h3>6   The Correct Device Map</h3>

<p>
As stated above, GRUB's problem with a mix of PATA and SATA
is that its device map shifts while the boot is in process. So,
if you opt for method B, what device map are you going to
throw at it? None: you do not need a <code>device.map</code> file for
method B. But you still need to edit <code>menu.lst</code>, and thus you
need to know what to call your available disks according to
both GRUB and kernel conventions.
</p>

<p>
Start with a <code>menu.lst</code> file that might be right. When the
GRUB menu pops up, go to the GRUB's command line and type
</p>

<pre>
    root (
</pre>

<p>
pressing 'Tab' to get a list of all possible completions, as
seen by GRUB here and now. This is the list of the available
devices. For each one of them repeat the trick, e.g.,
</p>

<pre>
    root (hd0,
</pre>

<p>
plus a 'Tab' will list all partitions in hd0. This way, you get
a list of all partitions on all disks with the correct GRUB
denomination and the partition type. Partitions from the
Unix world will be recognized; so will FAT partitions. NTFS will
not be seen in pure GRUB, but <code>grub4dos</code> can manage. That should be
sufficient for you to identify the hardware.
</p>

<p>
The hard part of the exercise is giving the devices correct
names according to kernel conventions. Would hd0 be <code>/dev/hda</code>,
or what? The shift in the device map occurs here, and you may
have to rely on trial and error. When you have the mapping
of the devices right, the mapping of the partitions is
trivial.
</p>


<h3>7   State of the Nation</h3>

<p>
All this looks like a royal hassle - and it is. Installing an
operating system should not affect operating systems already
installed. Windows has bad manners in this respect, but
does that mean that GRUB should also have bad manners? It should not;
actually, it's supposed to be friendly and co-operative.
</p>

<p>
Well, if you go to the GRUB Web site
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/</a>),
you'll learn that there is a <em>discontinued</em> GRUB version (0.97)
and a new GRUB version (1.95, as of the time of writing.) The former is called legacy
GRUB; the latter is called GRUB-2 and has been in the works
for 4-5 years. The FAQ for the new GRUB asks straight away
why there is a need for a fresh rewrite of GRUB. Excerpt
from the answer:
</p>

<pre>
    Because GRUB Legacy has become unmaintainable,
    due to messy code and design failures.
</pre>

<p>
It also says that the new version is "usable". Obviously, it
is not, since the major distros rely on legacy GRUB
(customized for their own purposes) and ignore the new one -
I was unable to find even one single distro that uses it.
</p>

<p>
Let's hope GRUB-2 will come up to speed very soon, and that it is
not going to turn into a repeat of the Hurd saga. The
situation is unbearable. While a Windows install takes over
the MBR and impedes booting other operating systems, Windows
still manages to pull itself up by its boot straps. With a
mix of PATA and SATA, installing SUSE or Ubuntu destroys the
Windows MBR, and then fails to boot ANY operating system at
all!
