WEP, since pretty much its very beginning, was acknowledged as a
stop-gap protocol. Seems that the gap has been bridged:

  Abstract: We demonstrate an active attack on the WEP protocol that is
  able to recover a 104-bit WEP key using less than 40.000 frames in 50%
  of all cases. The IV of these packets can be randomly chosen. This is an
  improvement in the number of required frames by more than an order of
  magnitude over the best known key-recovery attacks for WEP. On a IEEE
  802.11g network, the number of frames required can be obtained by
  re-injection in less than a minute. The required computational effort is
  approximately 2^{20} RC4 key setups, which on current desktop and laptop
  CPUs is neglegible.

<p>
The whole notion of wrapping an entire wireless session in crypto,
embedding that crypto in hardware, and declaring it blessed, was an
obviously bad idea all along -- and also unnecessary, since sound
algorithms for authentication and session encryption already exist
higher in the stack.  Smart people have therefore always simply ignored
WEP, and fortunately can just continue so doing.
</p>

<p>
For the same reason, whatever sucker bait eventually replaces the
"stop-gap protocol" will be equally easily ignored.

True, and you can easily combine 802.11b/g with IPsec or OpenVPN. Both
should be safe enough when coupled with X.509 certificates (remember,
short pre-shared keys can always be brute-forced). Keep a transparent
proxy near the access point for all unauthenticated users and XOR/ROT13
all their unencrypted packets. ;)
</p>

<p>
If you want to stay within the means of 802.11 go for WPA2 with a 64-bit
pre-shared key or again X.509 certificates (defined as per 802.11i). If
you have a RADIUS server at hand (or always wanted to configure one ;),
you can move the whole authentication and key management business off
your access point to other segments of the network (also called the
"enterprise mode"). Enterprise mode is reasonably safe provided no one
attacks the RADIUS&lt;-&gt;access point communication (RADIUS uses MD5-hashed
passwords).

<p>
That all seems like <em>drastic</em> over-engineering, to me.
</p>

<p>
Locally, in my house LAN, we have non-encrypted, non-authenticated,
no-fuss 802.11b wireless.  People who use the wireless networking simply
know that, and bear it in mind.   E.g., if you wish to conduct a
authenticated, encrypted session of any type of traffic, you use
whatever <em>application-level</em> handling gives you the desired sort of
authentication and encryption:  SSL/TLS SMTP, IMAP-SSL, ssh tunnels with
proper attention to key handling, and so on.
</p>

<p>
That is, if one assumes one's LAN or WAN link isn't inherently private
and intrusion-proof -- isn't wrapped in magic crypto pixie dust to make
it "blessed" and inherently trustworthy -- then the correct course of
action is entirely obvious.  And effective.  And doesn't risk becoming
unfixable in the future because a buggy or obsolete implementation has
been burned into some WAP's firmware, or deep in some networking gear's
infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
And, oddly enough, we take the exact same attitude to the house wired
LAN.  Why trust the wired LAN when I have random LUG members attending
user group meetings on my back porch every 2nd and 4th Saturday?  I
don't trust them with my paper-based banking details, either, so why
should I trust them with my networked computing data?
</p>

<p>
I developed that frame of mind during 1994-2000, when all my machines
lived on the same ethernet hubs as the Linux-based Internet cafe
downstairs that I helped build in San Francisco, and it's served me
extremely well.
</p>


<p>
And, before someone asks:  If someone ever parks out in my driveway and
connects to my wireless network, and attempts outbound SMTP spam-injection,
he/she can anticipate DoSing via annoyed homeowner with baseball bat.  ;-&gt;

Well, it might be, depending on what kind of access point you want to
have. Depending on the purpose either unencrypted, WEP, WPA/WPA2 or VPN
access points can make sense.

<p>
Yes, that's true, and I use encrypted application-level protocols where
possible and sensible. There's even a group that promotes secure network
design (<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/jericho/about.htm">http://www.opengroup.org/jericho/about.htm</a>) by "using a
well-defined mix of encryption, inherently secure protocols, and
data-level authentication".

<p>
I fully agree, and my suggestions wasn't meant to "secure" the access
point. Just adding encryption may not increase trustworthiness.

</pre>

<p>
It's possible my fundamental point might have been unclear:  I'd simply
rather _never assume_ that my networking infrastructure will protect 
against bad things (eavesdropping, forgeries), no matter what that
infrastructure is capable of -- for what I regard as sound policy
reasons.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't bother me if that infrastructure-level "protection" is
present as long as it doesn't interfere with my operations (though
experience suggests it frequently does interfere) -- but I don't rely on
it.  Having taken care of my own authentication and encryption needs at
the application level, those infrastructure mechanisms can be ignored as
superfluous -- which has proven a good thing in the wireless context, as
the protocols have been badly designed, brittle, poorly compatible, and
basically a lot of trouble and very little good.
</p>

<p>
Basically, starting in the early 1990s, I came to be comfortable with
dealing, on the level of each host, with the security exposures one sees
on the open Internet, decided there's little to be gained from regarding
<em>any</em> network connection as being any more trustworthy than the open
Internet, and adjusted my assumptions and practices accordingly.  Guess
what?  It works splendidly, facilitates <em>genuine</em> defence in depth (as
opposed to the "let's just wrap everything in another layer of software
and hope for the best" kind), and helps promote overall sysadmin
competence and self-reliance.
</p>



<pre>

</pre>

<p>
Let's just say that one reasonable and proportionate response to finding
one's self (at least somewhat) responsible for a LAN is to monitor what
occurs over it.

I guess it all depends on the size of the network, and on how secure you
need it to be - I wouldnt go trough all that to secure my home network (in
wich a MAC filter would be more than enough) - but we do use WPA along with
mac filtering in my work's wireless network, along with a proxy/domain that
requires auth.

I have found that configuring WPA2 with shared keys is as easy as
configuring WPA or WEP. Moreover, most hardware post 2004/2005
supports it. Why not use it?

That's pretty much my own approach whenever I have to deal with that
kind of an issue. I consider any network connections - anything past the
physical confines of my computer - to be part of the "Internet cloud",
and precisely as secure. In light of that, and given even the small risk
of break-in via the few network services that I run, I deal with my data
accordingly (essentially as if it was all on an open public network.)
</p>

<p>
I also appreciate Bruce Schneier's approach to a similar issue: open
wireless networks.
</p>

<pre>
  I'm also unmoved by those who say I'm putting my own data at risk,
  because hackers might park in front of my house, log on to my open
  network and eavesdrop on my internet traffic or break into my computers.
  This is true, but my computers are much more at risk when I use them on
  wireless networks in airports, coffee shops and other public places.  If
  I configure my computer to be secure regardless of the network it's on,
  then it simply doesn't matter. And if my computer isn't secure on a
  public network, securing my own network isn't going to reduce my risk
  very much.
