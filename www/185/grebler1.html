<h1>synCRONicity: A riff on perceived limitations of cron</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>


<pre>
	Insanity is hereditary; you get it from your children.
	    Sam Levenson
</pre>

<p>
My younger son (Rob, 22 soon) wants more Internet. Of course. 20GB a
month is not enough for him. While he was away, my wife and I were
pushing to use 20% of that.
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I have developed zillions of mechanisms to monitor our
Internet usage. Well, perhaps 5. Or maybe just one, which I refined 4
times. And what do I mean by <b>our</b> Internet usage?! Not
<b>our</b> usage; not mine, not my wife's; we're well behaved. Just
Rob's. If not for him, we wouldn't need to monitor anything.
</p>

<p>
So, if I'm going to monitor Internet usage at all, I may as well
monitor everyone's.
</p>

<p>
He has returned from 5 months studying in Malaysia. He comes to me
with ISP plans that provide 100 GB per month (with a catch or two).
Since the subject is on the table, I check what our usage is so far
this month.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who knows me knows I prefer to live in an xterm. I could go to
Firefox and navigate half-a-dozen screens to get the information I
want, but long ago I wrote an expect script, get_optus_usage.exp,
wrapped in a shell script, get_optus_usage.sh, to do the job for me.
</p>

<p>
I get back something like:
</p>

<pre>
   Plan Data Limit = 20000MB
   Data Used 17% (3517 MB)
   Days Elapsed 7% (2 days)
</pre>

<p>
Am I surprised? No. Annoyed? Sure; but surprised - never.
</p>

<p>
I decide it's time to run get_optus_usage.sh more frequently. I will
run it as a cron job every night at 23:55. Why that particular time?
Well, for most days, it will make no difference. As long as it runs
every 24 hours (more or less) I'll get an idea of the usage on each
day. But on the last day of the month, I'll know the usage for the
month. Shortly thereafter, my ISP will reset its counters.
</p>

<p>
Here's my problem. I know my script works: I just ran it. (I also know
that it doesn't always work. Whenever my ISP gets, um, creative and
starts rearranging the furniture, the script breaks. I then tweak it,
and it works until next time. But that's not my problem <i>du
jour</i>.) Will it work when invoked from cron?
</p>

<p>
My first answer is: not in a way that is useful. When run
interactively, it displays its answers on the xterm (stdout). If run
from cron, that output will be emailed to me. (Actually, it won't: I
don't run a mail daemon. Nevertheless, an attempt will be made to
email me.) I don't want the output in an email; I want it in a log
file.
</p>

<p>
Ok, so I will need to redirect stdout. I could do that in the crontab
entry, something like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
55 23 * * * get_optus_usage.sh &gt;&gt; /var/CableUsage/optus_usage.log
</pre>

<p>
(I already have /var/CableUsage from all the other monitoring I've
been doing - see above.)
</p>

<p>
But, in many years of writing cron jobs, I've learnt that it ain't that
simple. Jobs that work fine during development become quite
recalcitrant when run from cron.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure I'm not the only one who has this problem. I'll look it up
on the Internet. What am I looking for? "cron", of course. Maybe
"testing".
</p>

<p>
I am not alone! "About 1,450,000 results," says Google. But, wait.
They're not answers. They're zillions of befuddled folk like me
looking for answers.
</p>

<pre>
	How can I test my crontab?
	How can I test a new cron script ?
	is crontab working? how to test run scripts with crontab
	How do I test a cron for functionality?
</pre>

<p>
I spent quite a while reading the questions and the answers. The best
that people could come up with is to create a crontab entry to run
every minute (or in a few minutes - but you might need a lot of
repeats on that idea) and then tweak your job, wait until the next
minute, check the answer, etc.
</p>

<p>
There are just so many things that are wrong with that approach.
</p>

<p>
So I gave up. I wrote a wrapper script, cron_get_optus_usage.sh:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#! /bin/sh
#       cron_get_optus_usage.sh - interlude for when running from cron

        dir=/home/henryg/projects/TECH/web_capture
        $dir/get_optus_usage.sh &gt;&gt; /var/CableUsage/optus_usage.log
</pre>

<p>
It didn't work.
</p>

<pre class="code">
'...  Your Terminal type is unknown!....  Enter a terminal type: [vt100] '
</pre>

<p>
I added
</p> 

<pre class="code">
        TERM=xterm
        export TERM
</pre>

<p>
and then it worked. Pretty lucky. Only took two days.
</p>

<pre>

</pre>
</p>

<p>
Next day, I get an email from my other son, Mark:
</p>

<pre>
	I have a script that when I run from the shell, it works fine
	but when it's run from cron it doesn't work properly.
</pre>


<p>
My response contained all the advice I had acquired over many years of
dealing with cron; and it helped him to solve his problems.
</p>

<p>
But, clearly, the need is there.
</p> 


<h3>The Trouble with Cron</h3>


<p>
The main trouble with cron is that it is, in effect, a part of
production. Even if you are using your personal crontab, reporting
still uses the system logging facility, syslog; entries go into log
files in /var/log or similar; and communication with the user is
typically via the official mail system. So you would like to proceed
with caution.
</p>

<p>
If you're like me, you don't like your system logs filled with dross.
At some future date, it may interfere with the diagnosis of real
problems.
</p>

<p>
So you would expect to find a suitable test mechanism. Dream on.
</p>

<p>
With the default cron program, the degrees of freedom are: running in
the foreground, using a non-default mail program, and a couple of
other options which are not helpful for testing.
</p>

<p>
One thing you can't do is specify a different crontab from the
default. So if you add entries of your own and get distracted, you may
leave the crontab in an undesirable state.
</p>

<p>
You might try to run as a user other than root and only affect a
test-user's crontab. But, if your job needs to run as root (or some
other privileged user), that's going to create more problems.
</p>

<p>
There are two very important requirements for testing: the ability to
run the job now (ie on demand); the ability to run in a test
environment identical to the environment when run from cron.
</p>


<h3>Real Sysadmins</h3>

<p>
Just to be clear: I reject any macho notion of the sort that claims that
"real sysadmins" don't need this testing nonsense. <em>We get it right the
first time. What's wrong with you? Are you a pussy?</em>
</p>

<p>
My credo is to minimise risk.
</p>

<p>
I'm not saying that the use of test features should be made
compulsory. If you don't want to test, don't. I hope that you are
particularly brilliant or particularly lucky, because, to my mind,
your behaviour is unnecessarily risky.
</p>


<h3>Other cron programs</h3>

<p>
I investigated a few other cron programs.
</p>

<p>
Anacron(8) looked promising because you can use -t to specify an
alternate anacrontab. There is also the option -f to force immediate
invocation of all jobs in the anacrontab. There is also option -n to
run jobs now. No, I don't understand the difference between -f and -n
either; I just use both. You can run it in the foreground which has
the happy effect of displaying "informational messages to standard
error". But that's "as well as to syslog."
</p>

<p>
Sounds pretty good. Unfortunately, anacron reproduces the environment
of the interactive user.
</p>

<p>
I also tried fcron (http://fcron.free.fr/). It turned out to be no
more promising than anacron.
</p>

<p>
In fairness, anacron and fcron don't claim to be useful for testing.
As far as I could tell, they do what they are intended to do. They
just didn't help me.
</p>

<p>
So there is no assistance when it comes to testing cron jobs.
</p>


<h3>Refined</h3>

<p>
I've refined my script. It now looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
        dir=/home/henryg/projects/TECH/web_capture
        {
                cat &lt;&lt;EOF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
EOF
                date
                $dir/get_optus_usage.sh
        } &gt;&gt; /var/CableUsage/optus_usage.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<p>
It draws a line to separate entries, displays the date and time and
runs the real program (get_optus_usage.sh); and redirects all the
output to the log file.
</p>

<p>
And here is an edited log entry:
</p>

<pre class="code">
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wed Feb 23 23:55:01 EST 2011
Billing Period:           01 Feb 11 - 28 Feb 11
Last Update:           23 Feb 11 11:45 PM AET/AEDT
   Plan Data Limit = 20000MB
   Data Used 65% (13142 MB)
   Days Elapsed 79% (22 days)
</pre>

<p>
All very satisfactory for this particular task. But what about an
ability to test cron?
</p>


<h3>A Sufficient Solution</h3>

<p>
I have a solution of sorts. You could actually invoke it from cron. I
might be inclined to do so for the last run before considering a task
ready for production.
</p>

<p>
But I'm reasonably sure that the last step is not necessary.
</p>

<p>
Here's the script; I call it cronsim.sh:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#! /bin/sh
#       cronsim.sh - simulate the behaviour of invoking a job from cron

#----------------------------------------------------------------------#
# To customise, modify
#
#       CRONHOME
#       LOGDIR          (if required)
#
# for example
#
#       CRONHOME=/usr/local/cronsim
#----------------------------------------------------------------------#

        CRONHOME=/home/henryg/projects/TECH/cronsim

        if [ $# -eq 0 ]
        then
                TGT=$CRONHOME/TEST
        else
                TGT=$1
                if [ ! -e $TGT ]
                then
                        cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Specified target script ($TGT) not found.
EOF
                        exit 1
                fi
        fi

        TODAY=`date '+%Y%b%d'`
        LOGDIR=$CRONHOME/logs
        [ -d $LOGDIR ] || mkdir $LOGDIR || {
                cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Unable to create log directory $LOGDIR
EOF
                exit 1
        }
        LOG=$LOGDIR/log.$TODAY

        {
                cat &lt;&lt;EOF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
EOF
                date
                echo 'Calling args &lt;&lt;&lt;'"$@"'&gt;&gt;&gt;'
                ls -la $TGT
                [ -e $TGT ] &amp;&amp; env -i $TGT

                cat &lt;&lt;EOF
------------------------------------------------------------------------
EOF
        } &gt;&gt; $LOG 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<p>
It's not rocket science.
</p>

<p>
Typically, to invoke it, you provide it with the path to your proposed
cron script, for example:
</p>

<pre>
	cronsim.sh get_optus_usage.sh
</pre>

<p>
If cronsim.sh is unable to find or access the script being tested, you'll
get an error message.
</p>

<p>
Basically, it invokes the requested script, logs all output to a
date-stamped log file, records its input args, and does a bit of
prettifying.
</p>

<p>
The key fragment is
</p>

<pre>
	env -i $TGT
</pre>

<pre class="code">
ENV(1)                           User Commands                          ENV(1)

       env - run a program in a modified environment

       -i, --ignore-environment
              start with an empty environment
</pre>

<p>
Running your cron script with an empty environment is overkill. There
are probably some environment variables that are set when a cron job
is invoked. But it is sufficient: if your cron job runs (or can be
modified to run) from cronsim.sh, I'm pretty sure it will run under
any invoking conditions.
</p>

<p>
You can start with a script (or even part of a script) and satisfy
yourself that it does what you want when run interactively (ie like a
normal script) - even as a non-root user, if that makes sense. If
appropriate, you can then run it under cronsim.sh, still without root
privileges to ensure that it still works or to understand the sort of
adjustments that will be needed.
</p>

<p>
Almost certainly you will need to set your PATH variable.
</p>

<p>
I expect that as you get nearer to the final version of your script,
it will only make sense to run it with root privileges. You can still
invoke it from cronsim.sh (as long as you invoke cronsim.sh with the
relevant privileges).
</p>

<p>
Does that mean that by the time you put it into production your script
will be perfect? Of course not. But I would expect it to be much
nearer than if you just set it up to run from cron without testing.
</p>


<h3>Other Problems with cron</h3>

<p>
My Internet search indicated that people have other problems with
cron. They can't seem to get their jobs to run when they want them to.
I've never had that problem. It has been stated that cron syntax is
difficult. I suppose there are difficulties.
</p>

<p>
One difficulty I encountered came in monitoring our Internet usage. I
alluded to this earlier. Back then I wanted to run on the last day of
the month. There's no way to achieve that with cron. I settled for:
</p>

<pre>
55 23 28-31 * * get_optus_usage.sh
</pre>

<p>
If memory serves, in the past I have written scripts to expect to
get invoked as above, but to first perform the calculation as to
whether today is the last day of the month. If not, just exit;
otherwise, do the work.
</p>

<p>
There may be a solid argument for a better cron with a better
mechanism for specifying when jobs should run, but that's beyond the
scope of this article.
</p>

<h3>Wish List</h3>

<p>
What are the elements of a variant of cron that would make testing
more convenient?
</p>

<p>
I would like these abilities:
</p>

<ul>
<li>select an alternate crontab</li>
<li>run the job on demand</li>
<li>avoid sending messages to system logs</li>
<li>avoid sending emails</li>
<li>run a job under the same conditions as when run normally</li>
<li>nominate the user to run as</li>
</ul>



<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
I cannot claim thousands of hours of flying time with cronsim.sh (not
yet, anyway). But I have used it a few times, not so much because I
needed to, but to try to give it some testing.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that it will undergo refinement.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I might decide it's a lost cause and go back to the drawing
board. That might mean modifying the real cron to do what I want.
</p>

<p>
I like my script because limited testing has shown it to be
platform-independent. I've run it on Linux and FreeBSD. If I start
modifying cron, that means C and compiling - and a different
executable for different platforms.
</p>

<p>
I am interested to see whether this is an item with a market of one
(me) or whether I strike a responsive chord.
</p>

<p>
And, of course, if anyone has any suggestions, I'm interested. In
particular, if, out in the badlands of the Internet, there is a
variant of cron that I've missed and ought to consider, a variant that
is a good fit for my criteria above, I would like to hear about it.
