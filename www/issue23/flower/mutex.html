<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Allowing multiple processes access to the same resources
in a time sliced manner or potentially consecutively in the case of <A HREF="multiproc.html">multiprocessor</A>
systems can cause many problems. This is due to the need to maintain data
consistency, maintain true temporal dependencies and to ensure that each
thread will properly release the resource as required when it has completed
its action.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Deadlock is a <I>permanent</I> blocking of a set of processes
that either compute for system resources or communicate with each other
[MAEK87]. Deadlock may be addressed by mutual exclusion or by deadlock
avoidance. Mutual exclusion prevents two threads accessing the same resource
simultaneously. Deadlock avoidance can include initiation denial or allocation
denial, both of which serve to eliminate the state required for deadlock
before it arises.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Both Linux and Windows NT solve these problems in
different ways. Windows NT has functions which equate to all of the above
instances. Both implement multiprocessor mutual exclusion mechanisms called
<I>spin locks </I>which effectively stall the processor until a lock is
achieved for a critical section.</FONT>
