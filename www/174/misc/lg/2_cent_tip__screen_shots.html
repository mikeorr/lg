I was writing an article. I needed more than words; I needed screen
shots. Over the years, I've done this in different ways. Of late, I've
used ImageMagick(1) for this sort of work, in particular, 
</p>

<p>
	import  -  saves any visible window on an X server and outputs
	it as an image file. You can capture a single window, the
	entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.
</p>

<p>
I was capturing parts of web pages. Then I came to a roadblock. I
clicked on a button and it produced a drop-down list. I wanted to
capture the contents of the drop-down list. But, some drop-down lists
are unfriendly. For example, in Firefox, if I click on File, the usual
drop-down list appears, but now my keyboard is deactivated. I also
lose most mouse functions, except for moving the cursor. And, if I
click anywhere, the drop-down list disappears.
</p>

<p>
So how to take the screen shot?
</p>

<p>
I started up a vncserver and a vncviewer (client); and then invoked
Firefox inside the VNC client. 
</p>

<p>
Click on File, move the cursor out of the VNC client, and, voila - I
can now use import to take a screen shot of the menu of the Firefox
running in vncviewer.

I usually use ksnapshot for this task. You just set the timer, open the 
list, and when the time expires you can choose a region on the screen, 
including the list. Actually, Firefox lists are really unfriendly - you 
can't press Enter to capture the selected region as usually, but you can 
still use double-click.
</p>

<p>
import would do that well too, but it tries to grab mouse that, 
apparently, already was grabbed by Firefox, which results in error.

The latest versions of gnome (at least), just click the PrintScreen
button on your keyboard, and a screenshot is saved to your desktop.
