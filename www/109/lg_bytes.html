<font color="green">European Software Patents</font></h3>
<p>
The difficulties and delays dogging the European Union's attempts
to agree on a software patent policy continued in November, this
time to the benefit of anti-software-patent interests.
<P>
In September last year, the European Parliament (a directly
elected body, with representatives from all European Union member states)
voted to accept a directive on the "patentability of computer-implemented
inventions".  This directive was only accepted subject to a set of
amendments that constituted real and substantial limits on the
patentability of software.  This fact was recognised both by
<a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/log/03/epet0929/index.en.html">
gratified anti-software-patent campaigners</a>
and by
<a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/papers/europarl0309/aipla0310/index.en.html">
chagrined patent attorneys</a>.
<P>
However, following this initial success, May 2004 brought a
setback as the European Council of Ministers (a body composed of
ministerial representatives from EU member states' governments)
instead moved to advance a directive that excluded the
substantial amendments adopted by the Parliament.  As well as
disheartening Free Software advocates, this brought howls of
protest from the Parliamentarians who (in a not untypical tug of
war between the branches of EU administration) accused the
Council of flying in the face of democracy.  After May, the obstacles
still standing between the Directive and its final ratification
were for the Council to formally adopt the directive, and then
for the directive to pass before Parliament once more. This
brings us to the present day.
<P>
The directive has not yet found its way into parliament for an
encore, but instead has floundered in the Council chamber.
Poland, a new entrant into the EU (and apparently relatively
undecided on this issue in May), has 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/18/poland_vote_against/">
changed the position</a>
adopted by its
representative in the summer Council meeting and 
<a href="http://kwiki.ffii.org/index.cgi?Polon0411En">
now opposes the directive</a>
precisely because 
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=19736">
no effective limits are placed on the patentability of
software</a>.
<P>
This heroic about-turn by Poland, as well as similar
<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/business/legal/0,39020651,39174908,00.htm">
pronouncements emanating from Austria</a> should remind us that
this fight is certainly still there to be won.
The efforts of prominent Free and Open Software figures like
Linus Torvalds, Michael Widenius, and Rasmus Lerdorf
<a href="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/en/m/intro/app0411.html">
who have raised their voices</a> to say
"<a href="http://www.nosoftwarepatents.com/">No to Software Patents</a>"
are welcome, especially as they provide an example to all of us
that if we feel this issue is important then we should make our
opinions known.  Those supporting a future software industry
stretched on 
<a href="http://technocrat.net/article.pl?sid=04/11/08/1640206">
a rack of software patents</a> are certainly not shy about 
<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/developer/0,39020387,39172989,00.htm">
pushing their case</a>.
Truly, can we afford the luxury of silence? Wladyslaw Majewski,
president of the Internet Society of Poland puts the point
starkly:
<blockquote>
    "The questionable compromise that the EU Council reached in
    May was the biggest threat ever to our economic growth, and
    to our freedom of communication. The desire of the patent
    system and the patent departments of certain large
    corporations must never prevail over the interests of the
    economy and society at large."

<font color="green"> Novell vs. Microsoft</font></h3>
<p>
During November,
<a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/11/17/2359205&tid=223&tid=109&tid=123">
Slashdot highlighted and discussed</a>
a very illuminating 
<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20041114074810372">
article at Groklaw, written by a retired attorney</a>.  Written
in the context of Novell's current anti-trust case against
Microsoft, the article points out that quite apart from the
interest stirred up by the substance of this particular case,
this is also a great opportunity to store up ammunition for
future legal adventures.  The key to this opportunity is that the
discovery process will, at least temporarily, move a lot of
Microsoft material into the public eye.  The trick is then to
store it up for future use.

<p>
The Register and Security Focus
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/25/nmap_draws_fbi_subpoenas/">
have reported</a>
that Fyodor, the author of the 
<a href="http://www.insecure.org/">
port-scanning network security tool Nmap</a>, has found that his
software writing has brought him into surprisingly close terms
with the FBI.  Apparently the Feds have begun to look for access
to his webserver logs in order to identify individuals or
organisations downloading tools like Nmap.

<h3><img alt=" " src="../gx/bolt.gif">
<font color="green"> OSRM and Patent Risks </font></h3>
<p>
<a href="http://www.osriskmanagement.com/">
Open Source Risk Management</a> has steered a somewhat
controversial course since arriving on the scene offering to
indemnify open source developers against hostile intellectual
property lawsuits.  In a bid to encourage use of its services,
OSRM has at times appeared to over-emphasise the risks open
source software developers and users expose themselves to.  
<a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3440111">
As reported by internetnews.com</a>, this perception has now
resulted in Pamela Jones (<a href="http://www.groklaw.net/">of
Groklaw</a>) resigning her position as litigation risk research
director for the group.  In particular, Pamela wished not to
contribute to activities that she felt were creating fear and
doubt about Linux, and providing ammunition to anti-open-source
interests.
<P>
The potential damage caused by such publicity is demonstrated by
the usefulness of one particular OSRM report to Microsoft's Steve
Ballmer, who used it to claim in front of Asian business leaders
that
<a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1729352,00.asp">
Linux violates over 200 patents</a>.
However, one should not be too critical of OSRM, since quite
apart from any 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FUD">FUD</a> there does
appear to be a real and growing likelihood that open source
software will in the future be attacked using patents.
Microsoft's statements on the issue of intellectual property
point in this direction, as does its policy of substantially
increasing its own patent portfolio.  This portfolio can be used
either defensively, or offensively, but either way its existence
and rapid growth indicate a messy time ahead,
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/112506/">
and it seems the lawyers can already smell blood in the water</a>.
<P>
Highlighting this threat can lead to some bad publicity, such as
Ballmer's showboating in Asia, but it is also useful for
generating awareness.  And as pointed out by Ballmer,
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/19/microsoft_wto_winning_without_firing/">
and highlighted by The Register</a>,
our current framework of international agreements governed by the
WTO means that these issues will have ramifications right across
the globe.  How any possible patent-war will pan out is still an
open question, but having good awareness in the Free Software
ranks of the risks and dangers that are faced is sure to be a
good thing.
<P>
The FSF is already taking steps aimed at protecting Free Software
from hostile parties armed with heavy patent portfolios.
<A href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">
The GPL</a>, which is currently being redrafted towards a 3rd
revision 
(<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1730592,00.asp">considered
overdue by some</a>),
<a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1759,1730102,00.asp">
may yet offer some protection against patent attacks</a>.
Clever legal manoeuvres, however, are not necessarily a
sufficient condition for safety, so it is important to
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/server/takeaction.html">
be aware of opportunities for practical action</a>, and to try to
spread awareness of these risks as widely as possible.

<a href="http://europa.eu.int/ida/en/document/3434/469">
switch 2000 desktops to OpenOffice.org</a>.  As well as currently using
GNU/Linux in server applications, the local government  is
exploring the feasibility of migrating desktops to the operating
system, with initial estimates indicating that 20% of desktops
could be migrated without causing particular difficulties or
inconvenience to employees.
<P>
The Dutch prime minister and the office of the Irish prime
minister have also 
<a href="http://www.vnunet.com/news/1159547">
encouraged European governments to consider open source software
in the spirit of inter-agency collaboration</a>.  Now, while such
pronouncements are good to hear, this writer is relatively
familiar with Irish government policy on these matters, and it is
anything but coherent.  If this is the case elsewhere, then
if your elected representative pays lip-service to open source
and Free Software, then perhaps it would be helpful to follow up
on this with a letter, to let them know you paid attention, that
you'll remember what they said, and that if they do a U-turn on
it then they'd better knock on somebody else's door come election
time!
