Subject: Jbilling:  Possible unauthorised use of OSI Certified service mark
</pre>
Dear OSI Board members:
</p>

<p>
Please see <a href="http://www.jbilling.com/?q=node/7&amp;pl=pr">http://www.jbilling.com/?q=node/7&amp;pl=pr</a> 
Note OSI Certified logo. 
</p>

<p>
The company in question, Sapienter Billing Software Corporation, is yet
another Web 2.0 company using MPL 1.1 + an "Exhibit B" badgeware
addendum, calling it "open source".  However, this firm takes one step
further the stance characteristic of Socialtext, SugarCRM, Alfresco,
Zimbra, Qlusters, Jitterbit, Scalix, MuleSource, Dimdim, Agnitas AG,
Openbravo, Emu Software, Terracotta, Cognizo Technologies, ValueCard,
KnowledgeTree, OpenCountry, and 1BizCom, by using OSI's certification
mark in outright violation of OSI's licensing terms -- or, at least, I'd
be surprised to learn otherwise.  Therefore, I'm mentioning that use, in
case corrective action is needed.
</p>


<p>
I'd suggest Sapienter illustrates why "Exhibit B" licences (though
certainly <em>not</em> badgeware licences generically) have become, in my view,
a serious problem:  
</p>

<p>
o  Substantively all (probably literally all 19) of the above-listed firms 
   already have considerable history of claiming in public to be open source.
</p>

<p>
o  Few if any mention their licences' lack of OSI approval.  Many
   imply otherwise; one (Sapienter) outright claims approval (as noted).
</p>

<p>
o  Not ONE has applied for OSI approval, though many are demonstrably 
   aware of OSI's approval process.  It's also notable that 
   many of their modified-MPL licences were reportedly written by OSI
   General Counsel Mark Radcliffe in his private capacity -- so it's 
   doubtful many are unaware.
</p>

<p>
o  Several of those firms' officers have already turned a deaf ear
   (so far) to suggestions on OSI license-discuss that they make their
   licences comply with OSD#10 ("License Must Be Technology-Neutral" --
   the main problem) by adding "if any" qualifiers to their licences'
   requirements concerning "each user interface screen".
</p>

<p>
o  At least one, Socialtext, falsely claims in public to use MPL 1.1
   without mentioning its licence modifications at all.[1]
</p>

<p>
Aside from Sapienter's outreach breach of trademark law, some might
object that OSI simply cannot do anything, to correct this situation.  I
beg to differ, and ask that OSI take appropriate, measured, and
constructive action:  Please consider issuing a formal statement
deploring use of "modified MPL" licenses in circumvention of OSI
scrutiny, and especially their use without clearly disclosing lack of
OSI approval.
</p>

<p>
No one is denying the value of efforts to close the much-discussed ASP
Loophole through suitable "attribution" clauses that <em>do</em> respect the
OSD and substantively allow code reuse, forking, and other underlying
core notions of open source.  Reasonable people can create licences
containing such clauses and get them approved.  Unfortunately, the
above-cited companies are pointedly eschewing any such effort, thereby
making a mockery of OSI's moral and other authority over open source.  
</p>

<p>
Please help us of the open source community's desire to help the OSI, by
issuing a clear statement that we can use to enforce open source
standards within this troublesome area.  Thank you.

The mini-thread that follows is not the only discussion that's occurred:
It's been ongoing for about two months, but until recently I think few
people had realised the scope of this snow-job.  So, I decided to clear
the air.
</p>

<p>
In his responses (below) where he clearly is trying to spin the
situation, CEO Ross Mayfield, like a few other interested parties who
have profoundly failed to impress me with any display of candour,
perhaps might not grasp that techies tend to take it personally when
flacks and others try to con them.

</pre>

<p>
Thank you for saying that.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; However, ONLY ONE company that employs a provision similar to the
&gt; Generic Attribution Provision has breached this trust.  I believe you
&gt; have provided another reason for the GAP to be minded by OSI.
</pre>

<p>
Hmm, only one company mentioned (out of 20) actually is implementiong
GAP:  Intalio.  Every other one of the other 19 licences I cited,
including the one your company <em>uses</em>, i.e., Socialtext Public Licence
1.0.0, seems to me to require a considerably more expansive
implementation of "attribution" than does the GAP clause.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; It is inaccurate to say that NOT ONE company has applies for OSI
&gt; approval, that is precisely what Socialtext has.
</pre>

<p>
Do you mean you have submitted _Socialtext Public Licence 1.0.0_ for OSI
certification?  I attempted to search for any such indication, and found
none.
</p>

<p>
I respect highly Socialtext's intent in bringing the GAP memo in front
of the OSI Board, but it is my understanding that your firm uses SPL
1.0.0, <em>not</em> MPL + GAP (which Intalio proposes to use), for its
wiki software.  What I said to the Board was, of course, that none of
the 19 firms referenced in my list had submitted the licences they <em>use</em>
(and claim in public to be open source) to the Board for certification.
</p>

<p>
Socialtext's commendable intent seems noteworthy despite the fact that
Socialtext substantively ignored the process detailed on
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.php">http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.php</a> by not submitting
a <em>licence</em> at all, but rather a patch that Socialtext evidently wishes
the Board to consider as applied to some unspecified fraction of the 58
existing OSI Certified licences (those with modifiable content).
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And we clarified this blog post to say more than we were MPL with an
&gt; addendum, and have had the license available our open source wiki
&gt; since inception.
</pre>

<p>
Thank you for doing that, retroactively.  Your edit appears to have been
implemented _within the past hour_, I will note.  As you know, I'd
mentioned the misstatement of fact on license-discuss twice, the earlier
time having been on Dec. 20, i.e., right in front of you, nine days ago.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Deplorable is a strong word in the context of a community, especially
&gt; a welcoming one.
</pre>

<p>
Asking the Board to formally deplore the particular patterns of activity
I cited seems amply merited by the problem those 20 firms have created.
In fact, it strikes me as extremely mild, in the circumstances.  Other
actions, such as yours in sending and posting the GAP memo, should be 
praised and are quite appreciated.

I'm intimately familar with Mr. Berlind's excellent article, thanks.

</p>


<pre>
&gt; I did amend the blog post tonight to provide a link to the license.
</pre>

<p>
But <em>not</em> to mention that your firm's licence -- which it professes to be
open source -- has never been OSI certified and that Socialtext has in
fact avoided submitting it (the outcome being predictable).  Thus,
you're happy to continue, in effect, misleading the public.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; We did not submit the SPL which is consistent with OSD [...]
</pre>

<p>
...other than OSD#10, and substantively #3 (especially given the bit
about "the very bottom center of each user interface screen", which
makes derivative works using two such codebases under your licence
_impossible even in theory_).
</p>


<pre>
&gt; -- and instead sought to address the general problem we all face
&gt; through the GAP.
</pre>

<p>
To repeat, that was commendable.  However:
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And we would never use the OSI Certified mark unless under an OSI
&gt; approved.  That's the point.
</pre>

<p>
No, sir, that is very assuredly not the point.  Your firm lacks anything
like the clear degree of fault Sapienter displays, but regrettably seems
(along with SugarCRM) to have been a key part of the problem I cited --
and evidently wishes to continue being one.  Your firm and the others
are thus the reason I requested a measured, reasonable response from the
OSI Board.
</p>

<p>
I might as well use space here to thank Compiere, which until recently
used an MPL 1.1 + "Exhibit B" clause licence, but within this past month
seems to have ended the practice and joined the open source world.

<p>
Ross is said to be one of the <em>good</em> guys in this picture; I've been
getting vibes, both overt and indirect, that OSI would like me to go easy
on him.  Unlike all the other "Exhibit B" firms' guys, including the one
who's now on OSI's Board, Ross has actually taken the trouble to put a
licence proposal of sorts in front of OSI, and I'm guessing he means
well -- by his lights.
</p>

<p>
My guess is that there has been a bunch of behind-the-scenes coaxing,
attempting to avert a confrontation between OSI and this growing market
segment of insurgents who're abusing the heck out of the notion of "open
source" and are fully aware of doing so.  OSI doesn't actually have a
lot of strength other than moral suasion, no assets, no professional
staff, a strong interest in avoiding conflicts that can be reasonably
avoided.
</p>

<p>
Also, it's undeniable that the "ASP loophole" is a real problem, and
that there's nothing wrong per se with "attribution" generically as a
concept -- as opposed to the particular over-the-top solution they're
all currently using of a mandatory logo on every page.  OSI (and maybe
Ross) probably hopes that something reasonable can be found that
satisfies the "Exhibit B" companies' desire for recognition, while at
the same time not grossly violating OSD#10 (technological neutrality),
#6 (freedom to use in any field of endeavour, including commerce), and 
#3 (freedom to create derivative works).
</p>

<p>
Highly perceptive critic Nicholas Goodman, by the way, thinks people
like me aren't cynical enough, and that the "Exhibit B" companies
absolutely <em>do</em> want to impair commercial use.[1]
</p>

<p>
If so, OSI yielding substantively on that point would be a huge mistake, 
as the biggest threats to open source have always been people wanting to
use the open source community as a free-of-charge development and PR
house while reserving commercial rights to themselves.  I hope OSI
doesn't cut any such deal.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, having a bloc of high-profile (even if economically
paper-thin) firms prominently calling themselves open source while using
non-conforming licences -- the situation we have today -- is almost as
bad. 
</p>

<p>
Goodman fears[2] that continuing conflict will cause "a fork in open
source".  By contrast, I think SugarCRM, Socialtext, et al. left us long
ago, but want to pretend they haven't, for business / PR reasons.
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to not act on my gut-level reaction to the line of con-job
rhetoric evinced throughout this discussion by Matt Asay of Alfresco
(and OSI Board member) in his articles and blog[3], John Roberts of
Socialtext on his GAP information (advocacy) page[4], and Ross Mayfield
in some of his replies to me and others.  I suspect they're accustomed
to playing deceptive spin games with published information and not
having anyone dare (or bother) to call them on it, let alone take
offence.  That's a typical CEO / VP trait, I notice. 
</p>

&gt; My guess is that there has been a bunch of behind-the-scenes coaxing,
&gt; attempting to avert a confrontation between OSI and this growing market
&gt; segment of insurgents who're abusing the heck out of the notion of "open
&gt; source" and are fully aware of doing so.  OSI doesn't actually have a
&gt; lot of strength other than moral suasion, no assets, no professional
&gt; staff, a strong interest in avoiding conflicts that can be reasonably
&gt; avoided.
</pre>

<p>
As I see it, what OSI has - and is failing to use as effectively as it
might - is the belief of the Open Source community in their right to
define what Open Source licensing means (this is related to moral
suasion, but focuses on a slightly different perspective.) My take on
the situation, which I've spent some time exploring after Rick pointed
it out, is that a bunch of opportunistic business people are taking
advantage of a "soft", poorly-defined area of the licensing procedure,
and are trading on the forbearance that has been granted to them. It is
not a case of a mistaken understanding, or even of attempting to
redefine the meaning of Open Source for the general benefit; it is a
move designed to create a private, proprietary benefit for the companies
involved. Everything said by these companies' representatives in this
discussion supports that, in my view.
</p>

<p>
I do understand the desire to be lenient with "fellow FOSS community
members". The problem, however, is not that these companies have
"wandered from the path", or have made an innocent mistake: in my
opinion, they are grabbing a piece of something that does not belong to
them, and leveraging it as a commercially-valuable part of their
business. This is not a case for leniency or forbearance, but an
occasion for remembering the concept of adverse possession (a.k.a.
"squatters' rights"):
</p>

<p>
(Wikipedia cite)
<pre>
In common law, adverse possession is the name given to the process by
which title to another's real property is acquired without compensation,
by, as the name suggests, holding the property in a manner that
conflicts with the true owner's rights for a specified period of time.
</pre>
The fact that they have been allowed to trade on that leniency for this
long affects the very root of the moral suasion that OSI holds, and
<strong>must</strong> be strongly countered, as quickly as possible.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Highly perceptive critic Nicholas Goodman, by the way, thinks people
&gt; like me aren't cynical enough, and that the "Exhibit B" companies
&gt; absolutely <em>do</em> want to impair commercial use.[1]
</pre>

<p>
That's my conclusion as well. Primarily, I see that they want to
arrogate to themselves the right to benefit from Open Source while not
"paying the costs" for doing so.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; If so, OSI yielding substantively on that point would be a huge mistake, 
&gt; as the biggest threats to open source have always been people wanting to
&gt; use the open source community as a free-of-charge development and PR
&gt; house while reserving commercial rights to themselves.  I hope OSI
&gt; doesn't cut any such deal.
</pre>

<p>
If they do, they might as well pack their bags - they would have
surrendered the very reason for their own existence.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Goodman fears[2] that continuing conflict will cause "a fork in open
&gt; source".  By contrast, I think SugarCRM, Socialtext, et al. left us long
&gt; ago, but want to pretend they haven't, for business / PR reasons.
</pre>

<p>
I agree. These days, the ability to tag yourself/your company as "Open
Source" is a hot property, with a tremendous amount of commercial value.
I recall that when I visited a LinuxWorld show - a year after IBM jumped
on the Open Source bandwagon - they were claiming to have invested a
billion dollars in Open Source _and having recouped it all_ within that
year.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I'm trying to not act on my gut-level reaction to the line of con-job
&gt; rhetoric evinced throughout this discussion by Matt Asay of Alfresco
&gt; (and OSI Board member) in his articles and blog[3], John Roberts of
&gt; Socialtext on his GAP information (advocacy) page[4], and Ross Mayfield
&gt; in some of his replies to me and others.  I suspect they're accustomed
&gt; to playing deceptive spin games with published information and not
&gt; having anyone dare (or bother) to call them on it, let alone take
&gt; offence.  That's a typical CEO / VP trait, I notice. 
</pre>

<p>
I've run into it most often in my contacts with the advertising world;
it's also a very precise fit for the categories defined by Professor
Frankfurt ("On Bullshit", <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html">http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7929.html</a>).
</p>

<p>
Oh, and -
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
Funny thing about that: We tend to allow people to use transparent
bullshit to move onwards, when they're in an awkward spot and otherwise
trapped. Everyone knows that the excuse is devoid of merit, but nobody
comments on it. It's just social lubricant.
 
 -- Rick Moen, <a href="../../../130/misc/nottag/speaking.html">http://linuxgazette.net/130/misc/nottag/speaking.html</a>
</pre>
There's a good chunk of that going on here - precisely at the time when
it must not be allowed.
</p>

</pre>

<p>
I agree. The sooner that statement comes, and the clearer and more
definite it is, the better for the community <strong>and</strong> for OSI themselves.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; There remains also one other bit of unfinished business:  the 
&gt; role of OSI General Counsel Mark Radcliffe, docmented only by the

&gt; unhealthy.
</pre>

<p>
Fascinating article - thanks for pointing it out. Important extract:
</p>

<pre>
In hope of avoiding a conflict of interest or any sense of impropriety,
Mark Radcliffe has excused himself from the OSI's deliberations over
whether the attribution provisions in question should be approved by the
OSI. In other words, his position with the OSI when it comes to this
particular matter is irrelevant.
</pre>
As it happens, I strongly disagree with that last sentence: his position
with the OSI is indeed the only thing that matters - when it comes to
these companies' PR. The fact that he has recused himself is <strong>invisible</strong>
to the public; therefore, he appears to speak with the full authority of
the OSI in the matter. It is not credible, in my perception, that either
these companies or Mark Radcliffe himself could have missed this point;
in fact, I strongly suspect them of trading on that very fact.

<p>
  Fourth, we announced that we will release our entire BPMS under the
  Mozilla Public License (MPL) amended with an attribution clause. 
</p>

<p>
Actually, you announced specifically MPL with GAP.
</p>

<p>
  I have one question:
</p>

<p>
Do you intend to commence disclosing to the public that your intended
"open source" licence is not OSI-approved?  (I realise your software
under that licence has not yet been released, but you have already done
a considerable amount of publicity for it.)

[ ... ] in which every additional adjective makes the noun in question
less true:
 
"Cheese" = cheese
 
"processed cheese" = cheese, sort of
 
"processed cheese food" = cheese, sort of, plus other stuff that's not
	cheese
 
"processed cheese food snack product" = the food in question is orange,
	but contains no actual cheese
</pre>
I also wonder what color Open Source would leave behind after Open
Source has been completely removed from it by the above method. Gray?
Gray could be OK, I suppose, as long as it's a nice, tasteful,
understated sort of gray - a perfectly balanced Ansel Adams
18%-reflectivity sort of gray. I just hope it's not that nasty Day-Glo
green. I hate Day-Glo green.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
Maybe we should just skip the process completely. That would be best
overall, as far as I'm concerned.

&gt; I'm not sure I follow you. Isn't GAP an "attribution clause"?
</pre>

<p>
I'm sorry if I was unclear.  It is inaccurate to state that Italio's
press release had claimed the eventual release would be under merely
MPL + <em>some</em> "attribution" clause, when in fact the press release had 
specified in particular MPL + GAP.  Further, the implication of your quoted
sentence in the context of the sentence immediately after is that
Intalio would use whatever OSI approves, and that is, however, not what
your press release actually said.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, you are creating the impression that MPL + GAP is open
source, i.e., has been judged compliant with OSD, when that is not the
case.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And isn't the OSI currently reviewing proposals for acceptable
&gt; attribution clauses that could be added to MPL-like licenses?
</pre>

<p>
That is true in the minimal sense that it is inviting discussion that
might lead to a proposed licence.

<p>
In my view, you should cease referring to licensing not approved by the
OSI Board as "open source".  At the bare minimum, you should qualify any
mention of covered software being "open source" with a clarification
that its licence hasn't been OSI certified.

You're right, the press release should not have mentioned GAP, but just some

</p>

<p>
Now, with respect to the use of the term "Open Source", I personally believe
that an MPL-like license amended with an attribution clause qualifies to the
spirit of Open Source, especially due to the fact that the AAL is
OSI-approved. All we are doing is essentially merging two OSI-approved
licenses, and I like to believe that such merging is transitive. Do you see

Such a licence certainly <em>could</em> be, which is a very hopeful thing, and

<p>
GAP is <em>close</em> but not identical to the wording of the Attrubution
Assurance Licence, which the OSI Board did indeed approve, some years
ago.  Recent opinion on OSI license-discuss, for what it's worth, is
that AAL would <em>not</em> pass certification if it were proposed these days,
because its wording somewhat suggests the intent to categorically
require that derivative works have a "prominent display", i.e., that
they have user interfaces, which would thus prohibit creation of daemons
and similar code.  That prohibition would contravene OSD#10, "License
Must Be Technology-Neutral".
</p>

<p>
One of the core notions of open source is that of allowing for code
reuse (which is an essential route to continuity and evolution of code,
regardless of how relatively little used).  That is the background
reason for the wording of OSD#10 ("No provision of the license may be
predicated on any individual technology or style of interface"):  A type
of program output or other technology that seems essential and
inevitable today may become awkward, problematic, or just obsolete
tomorrow.  Thus, open source code must not be tied to same.
</p>

<p>
It is my personal opinion that MPL 1.1 with GAP addendum, <em>if</em> GAP's
term "display" were qualified with the phrase "(if any)", would fully
comply with the Open Source Definition -- and would deserve quick approval.
(I of course do not speak for OSI's Board.)
</p>


<p>
In any event, no, it's not actually the case that MPL 1.1 + GAP is the
merging of two OSI-approved licences, because GAP's wording does
actually differ somewhat from that of AAL.
</p>

<p>
Moreoever, OSI has always made it abundantly clear that modification of
licenses is supposed to trigger a re-submit to OSI before claiming that
the resulting derivative is still open source.  See
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php</a> for the full certification
policy.  The wisdom of that policy should be obvious, I think:  Even
<em>if</em> one were merely to concatenate two approved licences, it is by no
means certain that the result would necessarily, in fact, be
OSD-commpliant.  That question of fact would hinge on the net legal
effect of the textual merger, which would need to be measured against
the OSD.
</p>

<p>
Which is, of course, what OSI's certification process does, and is the
whole point of their policy.

I join Danese Cooper in thanking Ross Mayfield and Socialtext for
helping bring the Exhibit B-addenda issue to OSI's attention, and in
particular for the Generic Attribution Provision text, and Ross's
general spirit of dialogue.
</p>

<p>
If I've seemed a bit sharp, it's been partly because of some
forked-tongue statements and insultingly obvious distortions from
numerous other semi-related parties, which I've encountered both here
and elsewhere, which have correspondingly dominated the press's coverage
of this issue.
</p>

<p>
Let me give you one example (and many others could be cited):  CEO John
Roberts of SugarCRM, Inc., to my knowledge the original founder and main
exponent (well, alongside Matt Asay) of the MPL + Exhibit B
"Attribution" notion has for quite some time been going around telling
all and sundry[1] that <em>all</em> he did was "merely combine elements from
two existing open source licenses -- the Mozilla Public License and the
Attribution Assurance License".
</p>

<p>
Roberts is also directly quoted (by David Berlind, in a podcast
interview) as saying, even more strikingly, "If you look through the
Sugar Public License ...it is the combination of two OSI approved
licenses.  The MPL and the [Attribution] Assurance License."
</p>

<p>
I believe Roberts has also made that same assertion here in on this
mailing list.
</p>

<p>
And thus OSI has <em>already</em> been approving "attribution" licences[2] --
and SugarCRM has, we are told, has even been <em>more</em> pure in its
approach than merely drafting a brand-new licence:  Instead, they just
grabbed two OSI-approved messages, and combined them.  Logically,
shouldn't that thus result in open source (is the implied question)?
What could be more reasonable?
</p>


<p>
Only one problem:  It's just not true!  The whole ball of wax, the whole
megillah, le chose entier, the <em>entire</em> preceding line of reasoning, 
rests on a breathtakingly nervy misrepresentation of fact -- for, you
see, the Attribution Assurance License is <em>nothing</em> like SugarCRM's
Exhibit B addendum (nor at all like any of the other 18 firms' licences
I mentioned).  Compare:
</p>


<p>
Relevant section of Edwin A. Suominen's Attribution Assurance License:
</p>

<p>
  Redistributions of the Code in binary form must be accompanied by
  this GPG-signed text in any documentation and, each time the resulting
  executable program or a program dependent thereon is launched, a
  prominent display (e.g., splash screen or banner text) of the Author's
  attribution information, which includes:
</p>

<p>
  (a) Name ("AUTHOR"),
  (b) Professional identification ("PROFESSIONAL IDENTIFICATION"), and
  (c) URL ("URL").
</p>


<p>
Relevant section of SugarCRM Public Licence v. 1.1.3:
</p>

<p>
  [I]n addition to the other notice obligations, all copies of the Covered
  Code in Executable and Source Code form distributed must, as a form of
  attribution of the original author, include on each user interface
  screen (i) the "Powered by SugarCRM" logo and (ii) the copyright notice
  in the same form as the latest version of the Covered Code distributed
  by SugarCRM, Inc. at the time of distribution of such copy. In addition,
  the "Powered by SugarCRM" logo must be visible to all users and be
  located at the very bottom center of each user interface screen.
  Notwithstanding the above, the dimensions of the "Powered By SugarCRM"
  logo must be at least 106 x 23 pixels. 
</p>



<p>
How are we to respond when someone comes to us and bases his entire
argument on a fundamental assertion of fact that turns out, upon cursory
examination, to be just plain false?
</p>

</p>

<p>
[2] The Adaptive Public Licence also gets quoted in these advocacy
song-and-dance routines, as does Open Source License -- e.g., in the
long and equally distortive advocacy segments of Ross Mayfield's page
<a href="http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?attribution_memo">http://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?attribution_memo</a> .  Guess what?
Those licences are nothing like these Web 2.0 "Exhibit B" addenda, either.

I'm left vaguely pleased by this discussion, even if it's achieved
relatively little other than chew up some of my (and CEO Ghalimi's)
time.  I'm tempted to forward the entire dialogue over to OSI
license-discuss, and excuse the breach of privacy on grounds that it was
feedback to a magazine article.

Rick,

<p>
Thanks for the clarification. Indeed, GAP needs some more work, and
we're very interested to see what the OSI will come up with.
