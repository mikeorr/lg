Dear TAG,
</p>

<p>
unfortunately I have to create a whole bunch of schematas, charts, diagrams, 
flow charts, state machines (fsm) and so on for my diploma thesis - and I was 
wondering if you happen to know some good tools to create such graphics.
</p>

<p>
Of course I know about dia, xfig, (open office draw), gimp, inkscape - but 
either the diagrams look really really old-fashioned (dia, xfig) or are rather 
cumbersome to create (gimp, inkscape, draw) - especially if you have to modify 
them afterwards.
</p>

<p>
So I'm looking for a handful of neat tools to create some appealing schematas.
Unfortunately I can't provide a good example - but thinks, like colors, 
borders,round edges are definitely a good start <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I have to admit that it is arguable whether some eye-candy is really necessary 
in a scientific paper - however adding a bit of it, really helps the reader to 
get the gist of the topic faster.
</p>


<p>
Thanks,
Peter

<p>
In my limited experience with such tools and from what I have seen
from my research lab supervisor and members, its usually 'xfig' for
the gray scale ones and often MATLAB for the colored ones. (yes,
MATLAB is proprietary). In fact, one of my lab members have been using
Inkscape off late.
</p>

<p>
I hope there are better free alternatives out there!
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
Amit

I used this once for a simple diagram I needed, and it seems to have
everything you need.

For finite state machines, Ragel (<a href='http://www.complang.org/ragel/'>http://www.complang.org/ragel/</a>) has
a Graphviz visualisation mode. That it also generates code in several
languages is a bonus <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
