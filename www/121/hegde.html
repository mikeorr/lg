<h1>Using the GNU Compiler Collection (Part2)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/vinayak.html">Vinayak Hegde</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>In the <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/120/vinayak.html">last
article</a> we saw some of the basic GCC options, and noted that it
supports several CPU architectures. One of the topics we will cover
in this article is how to turn on optimizations for different
architectures and what happens when they are turned on. We will
also look at some other nifty tricks which we can do with GCC.</p>

<h3>Adding symbols for profiling and debugging</h3>

<p>Profiling is a method of identifying sections of code that
consume large portions of execution time. Profiling basically works
by inserting monitoring code at specific points in the program.
This code can be inserted by using the <tt>-pg</tt> option of
GCC.</p>

<p>When debugging we need extra information added to the binaries.
Programs compiled with the <tt>-g</tt> flag additional information
which can be used by gdb (or other debuggers) is added to the
binary. This increases the size of the binaries but is necessary
for debugging. When compiling debugging binaries we should turn off
all optimization flags. GCC can add debugging information in
several different formats such as stabs, dwarf-2 or coff
format.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -g -o helloworld helloworld.c #for adding debugging information
$ gcc -pg -o helloworld helloworld.c #for profiling
</pre>

<p>Programs compiled with profiling and/or debugging turned on are
usually referred to as <em>debug</em> binaries, as opposed to
<em>production</em> binaries which are compiled with optimization
flags.</p>

<h3>Monitoring compilation times</h3>

<p>We previously saw that the compilation of the program to get an
executable binary consists of different phases. 
<!-- Some of these phases are preprocessing, parsing, lexical analysis,
assembling and linking. --> Each of the main compile stages
(compiling to assembly language, assembling and linking) is done by
different executables (e.g. cc1, as and collect2). We use the
<tt>-time</tt> option to GCC to get a breakdown of the time
required for each stage.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -time helloworld.c
# cc1 0.02 0.00
# as 0.00 0.00
# collect2 0.04 0.01
</pre>

<p>We can also gather more fine-grained statistics about the
various stages of the compiler cc1 using the <tt>-Q</tt> option.
This shows the real time spent as well as time spent in userspace
and kernel modes.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -Q helloworld.c
 main
Execution times (seconds)
 preprocessing         :   0.00 ( 0%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.24 (38%) wall
 parser                :   0.01 (50%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.02 ( 3%) wall
 expand                :   0.00 ( 0%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.03 ( 5%) wall
 global alloc          :   0.00 ( 0%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.03 ( 5%) wall
 shorten branches      :   0.00 ( 0%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.04 ( 6%) wall
 symout                :   0.00 ( 0%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.01 ( 2%) wall
 rest of compilation   :   0.01 (50%) usr   0.00 ( 0%) sys   0.00 ( 0%) wall
 TOTAL                 :   0.02             0.00             0.64
</pre>

<h3>GCC Optimizations</h3>

<p>Before we move on to optimizations, we need to look at how a
compiler is able to generate code for different platforms and
different languages. The process of compilation has three
components:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>The Front End</b>: This is responsible for interpreting the
text and converting into an efficient form for manipulation by the
computer. This efficient form is generally a specialized form of
the tree data structure. There are hardly any optimizations done at
this stage. This stage will be different for each language
supported by GCC.</li>

<li><b>The Middle End</b>: In this phase, the tree data structure
is manipulated and pruned to improve the structure for the code
generation phase. The optimizations that are performed in this
phase are common to all languages and platforms. These include
constant folding, strength reduction, algebraic simplification and
common sub-expression elimination. Discussion of these
optimizations is beyond the scope of this article, but you can
refer to the "Compilers" book by Aho, Sethi and Ullman (ISBN
0201100886, also called the "Dragon Book") for more detailed
information.</li>

<li><b>The Back End</b>: This is the final phase before emitting
binary code for a particular platform. This is the phase in which
platform specific optimizations are done. The compiler can use
platform-specific information such as extended/specialized
instruction sets such as MMX/SSE2/3DNow!. Different CPUs have
different number of registers/internal caches/pipeline structures.
Optimizations can also be directed towards these architectural
differences to exploit them and maximize the speed of the binary
code emitted by the final code generation phase. The types of
optimization which can be done in this phase can mainly divided
into two categories - Register Allocation and Code Scheduling.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two kinds of optimizations possible - optimizations
for speed and optimizations for space. In an ideal world, both
would be possible at the same time, (Actually some optimizations do
both - such as common sub-expression elimination). More often than
not optimizing for speed increases the memory footprint (the size
of the program loaded in memory) and vice versa. Expanding
functions inline is a good example of this case. Inlining functions
reduces the overhead of a function call but ends up replicating
code wherever the inline function has been called, thus increasing
the size of the executable. Turning on optimizations will increase
the compilation time as the compiler has to analyze the code
more.</p>

<p>GCC offers four optimization levels. These are specified by the
-O&lt;Optimization Level&gt; flag. The default is no optimization
or -O0 (notice the capital O). Various optimizations are turned on
by the each of the different levels (-O1, -O2 and -O3). Even if we
give higher optimization levels such as -O25, they have the net
effect of enabling the highest level of optimizations (-O3). In
addition to these four optimization level there is another
optimization level -Os which enables all the optimizations for
space as well as those optimizations which do not increase the size
of the code but give speed improvements. In -O1 optimization level,
only those optimizations are done which reduce code size and
execution time without increasing compilation times significantly.
In -O2 optimization level, those optimizations which do have a
space-execution time tradeoff are done. Almost all optimizations
are turned on by -O3 optimization level but compilation time might
increase significantly by turning it on.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -O3 -o hello3 helloworld.c
$ gcc -O0 -o hello0 helloworld.c

$ ls -l
-rwxr-xr-x  1 vinayak users    8722 2005-03-24 17:59 hello3
-rwxr-xr-x  1 vinayak users    8738 2005-03-24 17:59 hello0

$ time ./hello3 &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.002s
user    0m0.001s
sys     0m0.000s

$ time ./hello0 &gt; /dev/null
real    0m0.002s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.003s
</pre>

<p>As seen above, compiling the program with -O3 optimization level
reduces the size of the executable compared to the compiling with
-O0 optimization level (no optimization)</p>

<p>It is also possible to have CPU or architecture specific
optimizations. For example a particular architecture may have
numerous registers. These can be utilized by the register
allocation algorithm intelligently so as to store temporary
variable between calculation to minimize cache and memory accesses
thus ensuring considerable speed ups in CPU-intensive operations.
Some of the platform specific optimization flags can be done using
-march=&lt;architecture type&gt; or -mcpu=&lt;CPU name&gt;. For the
x86 and x86-64 family of processors, -march implicitly implies
-mcpu. Some of the architecture types options in this family are
ix86 (i386, i486, i586, i686), Pentiumx (pentium, pentium-mmx,
pentiumpro, pentium2, pentium3 ,pentium4) and athlon (athlon,
athlon-tbird, athlon-xp, opteron). But executables built with
platform specific flags may not run on other CPUs. For example,
executables generated with the -march=i386 will run on i686
platform because of backward compliance of the platforms. However,
executables generated with the -march=i686 may not run on the older
platforms as some of the instructions (or extended instruction
sets) do not exist on older CPUs. If you use the Gentoo Linux
distribution, you might be already familiar with some of these
flags.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -o matrixMult -O3 -march=pentium4 MatrixMultiplication.c #optimise for Pentium 4
$ gcc -o matrixMult -O3 -march=athlon-xp MatrixMultiplication.c #optimise for Athlon-XP
</pre>

<p>Also you can give specific flags for optimizations at the
command line such as -finline-functions (for integrating simple
functions into their callers) and -floop-optimize (to optimize loop
control structures). The important thing to remember is that the
order of the flags on the command line matters. The option on the
right will override ones on the left. This is a good way to choose
particular options without cluttering the compilation command line.
It is also possible to do it for platform-specific
optimizations.</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -o inlineDemo -O3 -fno-inline-functions InlineDemo.c
$ gcc -o matrixMult -march=pentium4 -nosse2 MatrixMultiplication.c
</pre>

<p>In the example, the optimization level -O3 will enable inlining
of functions - the effect is same as -O2 -finline-functions
-frename-registers. So if you have the option -fno-inline-functions
on the right on the command line, it will disable inlining of
functions. This command will turn on all the Pentium4 specific
optimizations but code generated will not contain any MMX, SSE and
SSE2 instructions.</p>

<h3>Supported options</h3>

<p>All the options supported by GCC on your machine can be seen by
giving the following command:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ gcc -v --help | less
</pre>

<p>This will list out all the different options that are supported
by GCC and the processes invoked by GCC on your machine. This is a
pretty huge list and should contains most of the options discussed
by us in this article and the earlier one in this series and
more.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this article, we looked mainly at the various GCC
optimizations options and how they work. In the next part of this
series we will look at another development tool called make used
for building big projects.</p>
