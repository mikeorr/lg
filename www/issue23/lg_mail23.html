<P> 
We're back in business after a one month gap--no November issue--and we
need articles from you.
<P> 
So, all you budding authors and Linux users out there,
send me your material. Don't depend on our regular authors to fill the gap. We
want to hear about all the neat tips and tricks you've found, as well as
all the neat applications you are writing or working with. We also like to
hear how you are using Linux as a workplace solution. --Editor

<p>
Hi,
<p>
I've noticed recently that there's an increasing volume of
questions on fairly elementary topics to your help page.
<p>
There's probably a fairly large volume of readers, like myself,
who correspond with the querants offering help, pointers, and
suggestions in the hope that they may be useful. I'm NOT an expert,
by any stretch of the imagination, being a recent "convert" of
only 10 months vintage.
<p>
I think that there is an argument for the Gazette running a
series of articles outlining a step-by-step setup procedure
specifically targetted at people setting up Linux on home
machines connected over the POTS in spite of the fact that
this would be duplicating efforts elsewhere (in HOWTOs and
such).
<p>
Just a suggestion.
<p>
I love the Gazette, you have struck a fine balance well - there
is something for everyone. I read 22 "cover to cover".
<p>
Keep up the good work,
<p>
Emmet

Subject: LJ Howto get TECH Info for NEWBIES
<p>
	I have been reading LJ recently, and I would like to request that an
article be written.  I have recently had (2) problems which I
researched, and only seemed to find dead ends for.  I purchased a new
computer recently :-) and,  as is probably common with such, had some
unsupported hardware.  This did not surprise me, having worked with
computers for some time.  So I proceeded to search hardware listings,
currently active projects, etc in order to find an answer, and found
nothing.  (My problem was with my UDMA harddrive controller card from
Promise.)  I began to email news groups and  Promise trying to get the
information I needed to write the code for the controller card myself. 
I could not seem to dig up any help on the subject of support for new
hardware.  My question: Could you please address an article on how to go
about attaining the information necessary to code this?
	Q(2) Could you also address how to get involved in the linux project?
<p>
	I have tried to get involved with projects (I am a relatively new C++
programmer (2 years)), in college, and there is little for me to do in
my area of the USA in order to exercise my C & C++ skills.  If you could
help me out here I would appreciate it!

Subject: COMMENTS/SUGGESTION
<p>
Hi Folks,
<p>
First want to say I'm really glad the Gazette is on line... what
a great source for finding out new things!  Keep up the great
work - it's a real winner.  Next, want to suggest some needs on
this end you might find useful as an idea for a feature.  I run
a real tiny ISP biz in NM (my hometown, but live in CA) - and have
LOTS of questions related to running the system (do sysadmin via
telnet) - primarily system security issues, keeping the email
system running right, HTTPD (actually run Apache) questions,
and DNS issues.  What has most plagued me is the lack of a fresh
source of info to keep the system on the 'cutting edge' of new
developements in software.  One example is Java, something that
came along shortly after the server was first installed, which
I can not seem to get to run properly - and to date no one can
tell me why.  What I would like to see you try is a column that
addresses the questions/concerns of small POP's or ISP's - actually
anyone who is running Linux as a server on line would have similar
questions/concerns.
<p>
  Have a nice....

Subject: Clipboard Ideas <br>
<p>
Hello:
<p>
I am a bit new to Linux and my programming skills are poor (time solves
everything), but I have brain (well, 2 overclocked neurons) and I think that
Linux (and Unix) have a problem with "cut & paste", aka clipboard. GPM is
fine, xclipboard too, some other systems also work, but its hard to move
from one system to another, and not all data can be copied.
<p>
I want to start a team to implement a clipboard in Unix, maybe using files
stored under something like /tmp/clip/ (or another /dev/foo?). :]
<p>
The main thing is that it should be able to work with text, graphics and
binary (archives, ie), like other OS do. I think that if we use a system
based in /dev/ , the system will support old apps (you only have to save to
the correct place emulating an app behaviour, and a demon will convert non
standard files to the ones supported by the clipboard). We can even made the
new clipboard a multiuser one. Or one with multiple buffers per user (like
Emacs, doesn't it?).
<p>
If someone is interested, just write. I have a draft so we can start the
discussion now. I must admit that my idea maybe look mad or too simple, but
that only demonstrates that I believe that usefullnes is directionaly
proportional to simplicity. :]

no sound comes out.

Thanks very much!
<p>
        I am using Sound Blaster 16 for my system. My Linux version is
Redhat 4.2 with the kernel 2.0.30.

        I recompiled the kernel properly (I think) to make my SB16 work. It
now can play wave, mod, CD but NOT MIDI. 
<p>
        I can only use timidity to convert them into wave and then play.
This means that /dev/sequencer does not work properly.

Subject: Word Processing & Text Processing
<p>
In his article in Issue 22, subject as above, Larry Ayers indulges in
the requisite Unixworld denigration of word processor software and
its users, as contrasted with the virtues of software "which allows
the writer to focus on content rather than appearance". I suggest that
there are some errors in this ritual obeisance to received wisdom.
<p>
The first is that all who yearn for the services of a word processor lust
to inflict another Gibbon, "The History of the Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire", or Russell & Whitehead "Principia Mathematica" upon the
world. Were that so then the world would be more than hip deep in
rejected typescripts already. Rather, I, and I am sure most others,
wish to prepare snailmail with some attention to personalised format
and typography, which is exactly what a reasonable word processor
provides. I certainly do not look for the archetypal offense in Ayers'
universe of discourse, Microsoft Word for Windows. I have borrowed,
used, and rejected that, and I have owned, and given away AmiPro
(WordPro) and abhorred Word Perfect since its inception. What I would
like to use in Linux is some clone of Wordpad, of MS-Write, or of the
word processors included with MS-Works or ClarisWorks, wherein I can
govern not only the content but also the appearance of my message.
<p>
It is true that Lyx seems to be a reasonable compromise, unless you
find, as I do, that the assumptions built into its templates are
displeasing to the eye.
<p>
The second error is to assume as gospel the correctness of Unix
conventions for ASCII text. The ASCII encoding was officially adopted
by ISO in 1964. That included provision for the CR/LF pair, and a
functional backspace (not left-erase). Anyone familiar with hardcopy
terminals of the time, such as Flexowriters, will also remember the
joys of "line reconstruction" procedures, to encode, say, lines of
Algol 60 program text, in a useful internal representation. Tortuous,
but that's what we expect computers to do for us.
<p>
The text representation conventions of Unix were born together with
the limited representational capabilities of video terminals,
character generators with limited repertoires, no "backspace and
overtstrike" abilities, hence no way of effecting backspace or CR.
By the time proper graphic facilities, and hence font choices, became
available the Unix conventions for ASCII text had ossified, and the
flexibility actually made available by the original ASCII conventions
were treated with disdain. Had Unix embraced the full flexibility
offered by the ASCII encoding then things might have been otherwise.

Hi,
<p>
I've been reading the LG since issue 1 when I first stumbled upon John
Fisk's web page from an Alta Vista search for Linux info.  All of you at
SSC have done an unbelievably outstanding job with both LJ and LG, and I
just wanted to say thanks.  I look forward to the first week of every
month when there is a new LG to grab off the net, and a new LJ waiting in
my mailbox.  I read them both cover to cover each and every month.
<p>
I do Unix sysadmin for a living and still benefit from so much of what is
originally written with Linux in mind and am able to reuse it on other
"Unices" as well.
<p>
Also, I just checked out CANLUG On-line magazine.  It's not bad.  Maybe
you people (and the rest of us too) who have done such a terrific job with
LG, can give them a hand getting their's off the ground.  After all,
the whole spirit of the Linux community is helping one another :)  And we

Subject: word vs. text processing
<p>
While reading Larry Ayres's comments (mostly quite sound) about TeX,
LOUT, groff, etc., I noticed he was sort of behind the curve on *roff.
<p>
First, there are several *good* books on this family of text processors.
I have <I>troff Typesetting for UNIX Systems</I> by Sandra L. Emerson and
Karen Paulsell (Prentice-Hall, 1987), as well as <I>UNIX Text
Processing</I>
by Dale Dougherty and Tim O'Reilly (Hayden Books, 1987).  In addition
there is a rather specialized book on the tbl pre-processor called
something like "setting tables with tbl" -- I don't seem to be able to
lay hands on it right now.  (I might add that I consider tbl to be
considerably superior to LaTeX's clumsy handling of tabular material.)
<p>
After you read these books, it's easy to make up a set of formatting
macros that do for the *roff family exactly what LaTeX does for TeX.
You can then invoke these very much the way the LaTeX macros are
invoked; indeed translation from the *roff to the *TeX markup is pretty
easy at that point (though there are a few subtleties that cause
problems).  LaTeX has a very few advantages for very esoteric
mathematical equations; apart from that, the systems are very similar.
<p>
Yes, the underlying engine is opaque as hell to figure out;
nevertheless, it's powerful and effective.  I still prefer *roff to
LaTeX, but have been forced to live with *TeX because the journals I use
all employ it.
<p>
One more historical item: Larry called nroff "newer" than troff, but
it's the other way around.  Originally, there was some formatter called
roff (short for runoff); then came nroff for "new runoff" and then
*later* came troff for typesetting.

Subject: new_user_setup
<p>
Hi,
<p>
I too am a relative newbie (again) to Linux but am sold on a lot of the
conceptual aspects of the system (shareware, GNU, free downloads, world
wide support, etc.)  I am also quite comfortable with the stability and
security of the OS.  I'm not, however, satisfied with the quality of
support for new users or "non-experts."
<p>
My argument is this, if you are trying to compete in the world market
with the IBM's and Microsoft's you need to study what it is that made
them so popular in the first place.  Availability of applications,
which Linux is doing a much better job addressing, is one of the
pieces that make them so prominent, but it's only one of the pieces.
The popularity of WIN95 in particular is due to the ease of installation of
the wanted systems and applications, and the focus on the end user.
<p>
In the world of computer users the highest percentage of computers are set
up as single user systems linked to a network, or some central server
and/or ISP.  The majority of documentation material for Linux has done
an excellent job of describing how to create and maintain the system as
a central server, but very little copy is devoted to running Linux as a
client station.  Red Hat and others have made great strides toward
making the install process as painless as possible (my first install
attempt was back in the 0.98 days).  I am able to get most of the
systems up and running but any time I have questions about a particular
package, the files it accesses, and where the files reside, is always
viewed as a fishing expedition.
<p>
Also a great deal of software gets installed by the standard install
process with descriptive text about what the application is during the
install (I can't read that fast), with a memo at the end of
installation that a list of what was installed can be found in the log
directory.  When I went to look at the log what I found was a listing
of the package titles that were installed (little more than the
filename of the RPM file) and no description about what the package
does.  I found the HOWTO information, but I tend to work better when I
can read the instructions from hard copy while I work with the
application on the screen.  I could (and do) print out the docs I am
working with but the expense of this one-of printing is tedious since I
spent extra money to get the documentation.  It is also particularly
annoying because the documentation has highly detailed chapters on
how to recompile the kernel (which isn't broken and works just fine)
and little more than a paragraph making reference to creating a dial-up
client connection to an ISP (which is what most people want).
<p>
I am a computer professional who is quite familiar with OS systems and
embedded coding and would like to convince management that a Linux-based
development environment would be a good new direction for our
teams, but it is a hard sell when the response to on-line queries tends
to come off as the respondents turning up their nose saying "that
information is in the docs" and no clue as to which docs or where.  If
the respondents know the answer but are tired of answering this
question "again" either reprint the old answer, point out where the old
answer can be looked up, or answer the question "again," not blow the
person off because the question isn't interesting enough.  Microsoft
and IBM got where they are by taking special interest in always
answering the "elementary" questions.  I realise the nature of Linux
precludes focusing any resources since it doesn't really have any.  But
if the general Linux public would take a better attitude toward people
wanting to join up, and lend a helping hand when possible, Linux could
become a major force in the computer industry.

Hi, 
<p>
Thanks for that great journal, <I>Linux Gazette</I>, which I really like to
read.
Can I subscribe to have new issues mailed to me?

Subject: More Praise
<p>
You probably get enough of it. But here's more praise.
I've just come accross this magazine and its the most useful
and interesting thing I've come across since Linux itself.
<p>
Sorry to hear about the November issue but this magazine must
be so fundamental to everything that isn't Gatesian that you
have to keep on going.
<p>
I wish I had a huge bundle of cash to send you, but you'll have
to make do with this E-mail instead.
<p>
You should have a logo ready to go on every Linux web page 
everywhere.
<p>
I don't often gush with praise and I'd be embarassed if any
of my gum chewing friends read this. But you deserve it.
