<h1>AMD64 Linux kernel and the NX bit</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
Buffer overflows are not uncommon in C programs. Attacks
which exploit these bugs usually try to inject alien
code into the program and execute it by overwriting return
addresses stored on the stack. Hardware support for marking
areas of memory non-executable would make such attacks
difficult. The 64 bit processors manufactured by AMD have a
`no-execute' bit added to page table entries. The Linux kernel
compiled for X86_64 CPU's can make use of this bit to protect
user/kernel level code against buffer overflow exploits. This 
article describes a few experiments which I tried on an Athlon64
system running the Linux kernel 2.6.8.1 to understand some
of the issues behind the use of the NX bit. The on-the-stack
machine code generation trick which GCC uses (the so-called
`trampoline') to implement nested functions and its dependence
on an executable stack will also be examined in some detail.
<p>
All the programs presented in this article have been tested on
an AthlonXP (32 bit) system using gcc 3.3.2 (the code generated
by the compiler can vary as the version changes). Code which demonstrates
the utility of the NX bit has been tested on an Athlon64 system
running Fedora Core 2 (for x86_64). 

<h3>Let's execute the stack!</h3>
<p>
The `objdump' utility comes in handy when we wish to examine
the machine code produced by the linker. We write a simple
C program:
<pre class="code">

main()
{
}

</pre>
and compile and disassemble it by running:
<pre>

objdump --disassemble-all ./a.out

</pre>
Here is the output:
<pre class="code">

08048314 &lt;main&gt;:
 8048314:	55                   	push   %ebp
 8048315:	89 e5                	mov    %esp,%ebp
 8048317:	83 ec 08             	sub    $0x8,%esp
 804831a:	83 e4 f0             	and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
 804831d:	b8 00 00 00 00       	mov    $0x0,%eax
 8048322:	29 c4                	sub    %eax,%esp
 8048324:	c9                   	leave  
 8048325:	c3                   	ret    

</pre>
We note that the `ret' instruction has an opcode of 0xc3. We use
it to write a cute C program:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/1.c.txt">Listing 1</a>
<pre class="code">

main()
{
	char a[10] = {0xc3};
	
	((void (*)())a)();
}

</pre>
Now, what does that horrible looking cast do? We are telling the
compiler to treat the address of the array as the address of a 
function which returns void; so go on, generate code to execute
the array! What is proof that the code is really executing the array?
Well, it is not crashing, and that might be proof enough.
<p>
It's not too difficult to prove that the code actually executes the
array. Let's compile (with -O2 option) and disassemble the 
following C code segment:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/2.c.txt">Listing 2</a>
<pre class="code">

#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;
main()
{
	outb(0x34, 0x378);
}

</pre>
The disassembled `main' is: 
<pre class="code">

08048314 &lt;main&gt;:
 8048314:	55                   	push   %ebp
 8048315:	89 e5                	mov    %esp,%ebp
 8048317:	83 ec 08             	sub    $0x8,%esp
 804831a:	83 e4 f0             	and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
 804831d:	b0 34                	mov    $0x34,%al
 804831f:	ba 78 03 00 00       	mov    $0x378,%edx
 8048324:	ee                   	out    %al,(%dx)
 8048325:	c9                   	leave  
 8048326:	c3                   	ret    
 8048327:	90                   	nop    

</pre>
We note that the `outb' is getting encoded as 8 bytes: 0xb0, 0x34, 0xba,
0x78, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00 and 0xee.
With this information in hand, we write another program:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/3.c.txt">Listing 3</a>
<pre class="code">

#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;
main()
{
	char a[20] = {0xb0, 0x34, 0xba, 
                      0x78, 0x3, 0x0, 
                      0x0, 0xee, 0xc3};

	iopl(3);

	((void (*)())a)();
	printf("%x\n", inb(0x378));
}

</pre>
0x378 is the address of the PC parallel port. Because the
program is executing the array, it is writing 0x34 to the 
parallel port; which is verified by the subsequent `inb'.
<p>
If our program has a buffer overflow bug in it, a clever
attacker can exploit this to inject malicious code into the
program (after all, code is nothing but a sequence of numbers)
and execute it via some address overwriting tricks. But what if
the OS, with the help of the machine's hardware, prevents the
execution of memory areas which are supposed to contain only
data? This is what the AMD64 NX bit which is supported by the 
Linux kernel attempts to achieve.
<p>
An ELF binary (or shared library) can be `marked' as 
requiring (or not requiring) an executable stack. This
is done using the `execstack' command:
<pre>

execstack -s ./a.out #mark a.out as requiring
                     #executable stack (we will call this `turning 
                     #off the NX bit')
execstack -c ./a.out #mark a.out as not requiring
                     #executable stack (we will call this `turning
                     #on the NX bit')

</pre>
The results of running the previous program on a 32 bit Athlon
system with the executable marked first as requiring an executable
stack and then as not requiring an executable stack were identical -
in both cases, the program worked as expected, executing the
array and thereby writing to the parallel port. This is because the
hardware does not provide the no-execute facility. The program
was then modified a bit (GCC for x86_64 generates different 
code) and run on an Athlon64. When the executable stack bit was
turned off, the program segfaulted.
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/4.c.txt">Listing 4</a>
<pre class="code">

#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;
main()
{
	unsigned char a[] = {0xb8, 0x34, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
                             0xba, 0x78, 0x03, 0x0, 0x0,
                             0xee, 0xc3};

	iopl(3);
	((void (*)())a)();
	printf("%x\n", inb(0x378));
}

</pre>

<h3>Why turn off the no-execute bit?</h3>
<p>
It seems that having the NX bit on for all programs
is a good thing. But there are certain situations where
programming language compilers and interpreters might
generate native machine code on-the-fly (or generate
code which generates machine code on the fly), store it into
an array and execute it. For such programs to work
properly, an executable stack is a necessity. Let's look
at an interesting example where the stack has got to be
executable if the program is to work properly.

<h3>Nested Functions</h3>
<p>
GCC supports nested functions. Here is an example
program:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/5.c.txt">Listing 5</a>
<pre class="code">

void fun1()
{
	void fun2()
	{
		printf("fun2...\n");
	}
	fun2();
}
main()
{
	fun1();
}

</pre>
<p>
Let's try to understand how nested functions are implemented
by compiling a slightly more complex program
and reading the output produced by the compiler.
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/6.c.txt">Listing 6</a>
<pre class="code">

void fun1()
{
	int i = 10;
	void fun2()
	{
		i = 20;
	}
	void fun3()
	{
		fun2();
	}
	fun2();
}
main()
{
	fun1();
}

</pre>
The assembly output produced by the compiler is shown
in <a href="misc/pramode/7.asm.txt">Listing 7</a>. Let's say the
value of the stack pointer in the very first line of fun1
is 1000. 
<pre class="code">

	pushl	%ebp
	movl	%esp, %ebp
	subl	$8, %esp
	movl	$10, -4(%ebp)
	movl	%ebp, %ecx
	call	fun2.0

</pre>
After the pushl, it becomes 996. This value is copied to ebp.
The variable `i' is stored at location 992. The base pointer is
copied to ecx and fun2 is called.
<p>
The register ecx is used for holding the address of the
activation record of the function which lexically encloses the function
being called. Whether fun2 is being called from within fun1 or
fun3, the enclosing function is fun1 and that's where fun2 
should look for when it is searching for symbols. Let's look at
the segment of code where fun3 invokes fun2.
<pre class="code">

fun3.1:
	pushl	%ebp
	movl	%esp, %ebp
	subl	$8, %esp
	movl	%ecx, -4(%ebp)
	movl	-4(%ebp), %ecx
	call	fun2.0

</pre>
Within fun3 (the compiler has renamed fun3 to fun3.1), the
value in ecx is the address of the frame which encloses fun3, 
that is, fun1. Note that this value is simply passed on to
fun2. The important thing here is that the compiler is able 
to identify (at compile time) the address of the stack frame 
of the function which encloses fun2, irrespective of the 
location from where fun2 is being invoked because the function 
is being called by its name.

<h3>The trouble with function pointers</h3>
<p>
Compile time identification of the address of the
lexically enclosing function's activation record becomes
impossible when the function is called via a function
pointer. Here is an example:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/8.c.txt">Listing 8</a>
<pre class="code">

void fun1()
{
	int m = 5;
	void fun2()
	{
		printf("fun2: %d\n", m);
		m = 10;
	}
	void fun3()
	{
		void fun5()
		{
			printf("fun5:%d\n", m);
			m = 20;
		}
		void fun4(void (*p)())
		{
			p();
		}
		scanf("%d", &amp;m);
		if (m == 1)  fun4(fun5);
		else fun4(fun2);
	}
	fun3();
}
main()
{
	fun1();
}

</pre>
The question is what value should be put in ecx when the
function pointed to by `p' is called. If `p' contains the
address of fun5, it should definitely be the address of the
activation record of fun3; otherwise, it should be the address
of the activation record of fun1. The trouble is that the
actual address stored in `p' can be determined only at run
time depending on what value the user assigns to `m' from the
standard input.

<p>
Before we examine how GCC solves this problem, let's
write yet another  little C program and run it on a 32
bit system:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/9.c.txt">Listing 9</a>
<pre class="code">

fun1()
{
	printf("fun1...\n");
}

fun2()
{
	unsigned char a[100];

	a[0] = 0xe9;
	*((int*)(a+1)) = (int)fun1 - (int)(a+5);
	((void (*)())a)();

}

main()
{
	fun2();
}

</pre>
What is fun2 doing? The first cell of the array is filled
with 0xe9, which is the opcode for the JMP instruction. The
next four bytes get filled by the difference between the 
addresses of the jump target and the next instruction (which
is what jmp needs). The array is then typecast to a function
pointer and called. Executing the code in the array results
immediately in a jump to fun1; a return from fun1 will transfer
control back to the end of fun2.

<h3>Trampoline Magic</h3>
<p>
The solution to the problem is simple and efficient. At the
point where the address of the function is taken, GCC knows
the address of the activation record of the function which 
encloses it - GCC generates code which copies this 4 byte value on to the 
stack, prefixed with the opcode of the instruction which 
copies a value to the ecx register. The next byte will
be filled by GCC generated code with the opcode of the jmp
instruction. This is followed by a 4 byte number, let's call it X. If
we assume that the opcode of the instruction which copies
a value to ecx is at a location on the stack whose address is Y,
we have the following picture:

<pre>

   Y           --&gt;  Opcode of insn which moves a value to ecx
   Y+1 to Y+4  --&gt;  The 4 byte value to be moved (address of the
                       activation record of the function which encloses
                       the function whose address is being taken)
   Y+5         --&gt;  Opcode of jmp instruction
   Y+6 to Y+9  --&gt;  A 4 byte number, let's call it X
   Y+10        --&gt;  Next location on the stack.

</pre>
This 4 byte number is computed by GCC generated code as
follows (let's call the function whose address is being taken
`fun2'):
<pre>

X = address of fun2 - Y+10

</pre>
After doing all these subtle manipulations, the generated
code stores the address
Y in the function pointer, instead of storing the address of 
fun2. Now, if some other function tries to call fun2 via `p', 
the code which has been dynamically generated on the stack
starts executing. It fills the ecx register with the address of
the activation record of the function which encloses the function
being called and then jumps into the actual function to be executed
(ie, fun2). Let's try to trace this out by reading the code
which the compiler produces for the following function:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/10.c.txt">Listing 10</a>
<pre class="code">

void fun1()
{
	int m = 5;
	void (*p)();
	void fun2()
	{
		printf("fun2: %d\n", m);
		m = 10;
	}
	void fun3()
	{
		p();
	}
	p = fun2;
	fun3();
}
main()
{
	fun1();
}

</pre>
The assembly output is:
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/11.asm.txt">Listing 11</a>
<p>
Let's look at the body of fun1 - that's where all the 
action is. Note that -71 is in unsigned hex form 0xb9
(opcode of `mov to ecx' instruction) and -23 is 0xe9
(opcode of jmp instruction). Let's say the value of esp
upon entry to fun1 is 1000. 
<pre class="code">

fun1:
 pushl %ebp             ; esp = 996            
 movl %esp, %ebp        ; ebp = 996
 subl $40, %esp         ; esp = 956
 leal -40(%ebp), %eax   ; eax = 956
 addl $0, %eax
 andb $255, %ah
 movl $fun2.0, %ecx     ; ecx = address of fun2
 leal 10(%eax), %edx    ; edx = 966
 subl %edx, %ecx        ; ecx = address of fun2 - 966
 movl %ecx, %edx        ; edx = ecx
 movb $-71, (%eax)      ; location 956 = opcode of mov
 leal -8(%ebp), %ecx    ; ecx = 988
 movl %ecx, 1(%eax)     ; locations 957 to 960 = ecx
 movb $-23, 5(%eax)     ; location 961 = opcode of jmp
 movl %edx, 6(%eax)     ; locations 962 to 965 = edx
 movl $5, -12(%ebp)     ; location 984 = 5 (variable `m')
 leal -40(%ebp), %eax   ; eax = 956
 addl $0, %eax
 andb $255, %ah
 movl %eax, -16(%ebp)   ; location 980 to 983 = eax
                        ; (980 to 983 is the variable `p')
 leal -8(%ebp), %ecx    ; ecx = 988
 call fun3.1
 leave
 ret

</pre>
Locations 956 to 965 encode two instructions, a `mov-to-ecx'
and `jmp-to-fun2' instruction. What's being stored in the 
pointer variable `p' is the address 956. A look at the body
of fun3 shows that the statement:
<pre>

p();

</pre>
is getting translated to a call of the instructions stored at
956. Reading the code generated for fun2 makes it clear that
the function is able to properly access the variable `m' in the
outer scope.

<h3>The NX bit, again</h3>
<p>
Doing an:
<pre>

execstack ./a.out

</pre>
on a program with nested functions, where we do NOT 
take the address of a nested function, showed that the
binary is marked as not requiring an executable stack.
But, it was seen that whenever we took the address of a
nested function, GCC was careful to mark the binary
as requiring an executable stack. This was the case on
both the Athlon32 and Athlon64 systems. On clearing the
executable stack bit, the program was found to segfault
on the Athlon64 system running the x86_64 Linux kernel.
