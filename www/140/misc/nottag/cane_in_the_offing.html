<p>
Hi, folks -
</p>

<p>
Just FYI, I have the minor inconvenience of a hurricane heading for me,
and (theoretically) approaching my neighborhood just about the time that
I'm supposed to be publishing LG this month. I'm hoping to <strong>not</strong> have to
either a) publish LG from 30,000 feet without a plane or b) miss pubbing
on the 1st, but it's looking iffy at the moment.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;From the National Weather Service:

FORECAST VALID 30/1200Z 26.6N  80.4W...INLAND
MAX WIND  70 KT...GUSTS  85 KT.
50 KT... 50NE  50SE  25SW  25NW.
34 KT...120NE 120SE  50SW  50NW.

FORECAST VALID 31/1200Z 31.0N  80.0W
MAX WIND  75 KT...GUSTS  90 KT.
50 KT... 50NE  50SE  30SW  50NW.
34 KT...120NE 120SE  75SW  90NW.
</pre>

<p>
So, the current prediction is that around 1000 Zulu on the 31st (i.e.,
~3a.m. EST on the 1st), the center of the hurricane - which will be
blowing about 75 knots steady and gusting 90 knots - is going to visit
my neighborhood (29.9N 81.3W).
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, I recently bought a large anchor and some chain for
it. On the minus side, my engine is down for service at the moment, and
getting the boat to a hurricane hole without an engine is problematic,
to say the least. I'll be beavering away on that latter problem, and
keeping track of Ernesto as it spins its way toward me...
</p>

Thanks, Martin. It's not really so much a question of sinking as of
minimizing/preventing damage: with a steel boat and a class I hurricane,
my biggest concern is getting the boat into a "hurricane hole" where she
a) won't drag her anchors in the coming wind/wave conditions, and b)
won't do any damage to herself or anyone else if she does. Given that
one of my diesel's injectors just packed up, and I just spent a lot of
effort removing them to get them rebuilt, I won't be going too far... I
might reinstall the injectors as they are and run on three out of four
(*ugh*) just to get to a nearby hole, or I might use my dinghy to tow
her (but that's a long way to go with a 15HP outboard motor.)
</p>

<p>
For some reason, I <strong>still</strong> don't seem to have these hurricanes trained
to come when it's convenient to me. Perhaps I'm using the wrong
stimulus?

Ask Kat to look at the top of your head -- maybe you have "hurricane

Thanks! At this point, it looks like it's not going to be anything more
than a storm, but even that's less fun than it could be. Well, that's
why I pay that big money for those big anchors...

Well, I was planning on shaving it for him later today, so I'll see if I
can detect any eldritch or mundane sigils of hurricane attraction there.
(I presume a google image search will give me all the detail I need for
this.)

Thank you. I think out best "luck" is in the geography of St. Augustine
itself, but I think that if there's something Ineffable direction
hurricanes to Florida, it's just Mother Nature getting cranky about King
Jeb, Katherine Harris, and the U.S. refusal to sign the Kyoto accord.

We're working on a turbo'cane accellerator that'll make then hit
within five minutes of the prediction rather than a week.  But it
doesn't work quite yet.  Hurricanes are just so frustratingly <strong>slow</strong>
in their movements.  You can prod them but you can't make them run.
Pernicious creatures, they are.
</p>

<p>
Haha, this reminds me of _Prayers for the Assassin_, which I just
reread.  In the mid 21st century when the US has split into an Islamic
republic and the Bible Belt (the South), an ex-Fedayeen (=special
forces) soldier is being hunted by an assassin.  They both had the
same Fedayeen training so they know each other's strengths and
weaknesses, and they continually taunt each other.  You'd prob'ly
enjoy it, for the dry humor at least if nothing else.

Actually, I don't have anything to do with 'canes.  If you want to run

them up.

By the way, the state itself not a hyper-religious theocracy.  It's a
religious democracy which two groups of extremists are trying to take
over.  It starts when the Zionists, as it's believed, nuke NYC, DC,
and Mecca during the hajj.  World opinion turns against Israel, the
Arabs overrun it, and the Jews are taken in by Russia.  Large numbers
of Americans turn to Islam as the only viable ideology left.  They
divide into Fundamentalists, Moderates, and Moderns according to the
strictness of their practice.  Die-hard Protestant Christians migrate
to the Bible belt, and the civil war settles the border between the
Islamic Republic (IR) and the Bible Belt.  The Nevada Free State
remains independent as a center of finance and sin.
</p>

<p>
The government decrees equality for Catholics and tolerance of Jews,
and thus keeps the country from splitting further.  The main
police/military units are State Security and the Fedayeen (a kind of
special forces).  The Black Robes are an unofficial religious police
who cane women who aren't covered properly.  They supposedly have
authority only over Fundamentalists but have started harrassing
others.  The Old One is a different kind of extremist.  He wants to
set up a worldwide calphate with himself as leader.  Just like bin
Laden was trying to do, he says, only bin Laden was an incompetent
idiot.  His vision is more political than religious.
</p>

<p>
Rakkim is an ex-Fedayeen shadow warrior (like a covert CIA agent) who
had worked in the Bible Belt.  Now he lives in the Christian Quarter
(sin) in Seattle, owns a nightclub (sin) with music (sin) and dancing
(sin).  He operates an underground railroad to help those disfavored
by the regime -- Jews, homosexuals, dishonored women, etc -- flee to
Canada.  He was raised by the head of State Security, Redbeard, whose
daughter Sarah is a history professor researching the old regime.
Sarah finds information suggesting the nuclear attacks weren't done by
Zionists but by others who framed them.  She flees, her lover Rakkim
goes to find her, and the assassin is sent after both of them.
</p>

<p>
Each of the characters has a different motivation, and a different
view of the old regime.  Sarah wants the spirit of free inquiry and
science back.  Redbeard is glad nobody is hungry now.  Society seems
to function on the surface, but in reality it's living off the
remnants of old infrastructure/technology and is not maintaining them.
</p>

<p>
The book has some flaws.  Taxi drivers have bin Laden trinkets on
their windshields; a battleship and LAX are named after him.  That
sounds so offensive and impossible I wonder if the author hasn't
thought it through.  Adopting a religion with a long and rich history
is one thing; calling bin Laden a hero is quite another.  Besides, a
hero of *what*?  Not what the IR government believes in.
</p>

<p>
Another flaw is, where are the Asians?  What happened to all the
Buddhists and Hindus?  He seems to have forgotten they exist.  Did
they convert too?

If their aim (predicting system[s]) didn't suck, I wouldn't want to twit
them... and there'd be nothing to twit them about, either. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Meanwhile,
GFDL/SHIPS/NOCLUE/CRYSTAL_BALL or whatever else they use is mostly a
response mechanism: every time the hurricane changes course, they toss
up another set of paths, each more useless than the last. A comparison
of predicted tracks for 90% of the past hurricanes makes quite a
bemusing study...
</p>

<p>
They're reasonably honest about it - NHC forecasts include a warning
like "NOTE...ERRORS FOR TRACK HAVE AVERAGED NEAR 225 NM ON DAY 4 AND 300
NM ON DAY 5...AND FOR INTENSITY NEAR 20 KT EACH DAY" - but that gets
drowned in the huge mass of pretty pictures and ALL CAPS OFFICIAL
COMPUTERESE of the updates.
</p>

<p>
I'm not ungrateful for their work... but I do wish that they exposed the
guesswork factor in proportion to their actual use of it rather than
having it as a tiny footnote.
