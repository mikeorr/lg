Hi.
I'm in Sunnyvale now. I think I should be around after 6, if anyone  
can suggest a good meeting place.

Oh, the sad, sorry saga this was...
</p>

<p>
I seem to have a knack of turning all my attempts at travel into
farce; as this thread is already off-topic, I may as well recount some
of the saga.
</p>

<p>
I decided from the outset to only take the bare minimum of time
possible to attend the summit. I knew in advance that I would regret
this decision, and I do, but there were two primary motivations behind
this: firstly, my son has school holidays, and I didn't want to cut
into time I would otherwise be spending with him; and secondly, I'm
unemployed, and I simply couldn't afford it.
</p>

<p>
The flight I ended up taking would have left me in San Francisco
airport at 11:40pm. I planned to spend the night in the airport, and
trek to SF early in the morning for the bare minimum of
tourism/souvenir shopping. My son collects drumsticks from the Hard
Rock Cafe -- I promised I'd get him a set, plus it would be a nice,
sight-filled walk to Golden Gate from there. According to Google Maps.
Check-in at the hotel was at 3, so a meetup seemed feasible
afterwards.
</p>

<p>
It becomes relevant later, so I should mention that I was more than a
little excited about the trip, and only managed to drift off to sleep
after 3am; my train to Dublin was at 6:18, so I had less than 3 hours
sleep.
</p>

<p>
What actually happened was that my flight from Amsterdam to
Minneapolis was delayed by 5 hours, and the connecting flight to SF
was cancelled outright. Delta were wonderful, and arranged a hotel in
Minneapolis, and a replacement flight the following morning. The only
available shuttle was at 4am, and I only managed another 3 hours. I
had gotten a little sleep on each flight, but only the bare amount I'd
learned to get to avoid feeling my ears pop.
</p>

<p>
So, from the plane to SF airport, and a BART and Caltrain trip apiece
later, I was in SF itself. In the end, Google's estimates of how long
it should take to walk across the city were, in the presence of
baggage and other people on the streets, woefully underestimated, even
without the few wrong turns I needed to take to get my position on the
map on my iPod. (Positioning by wifi alone sucks, in case you didn't
know).
</p>

<p>
I got there eventually, but only had enough time to take a few
pictures of Alcatraz from afar and buy the souvenir I promised. (Along
the way I passed through Union Square and Chinatown, so not a total
loss). I tried to climb Russian Hill, but after the first sloped
block, I had to stop twice on the second (both times leaning against a
tree to not fall back down!), so I got the first No. 30 bus, to get to
4th Street. At the wrong point along the route, but the driver was
great and took me on the second route that took me there.
</p>

<p>
So, I got to hotel, only to be informed that my reservation had been
cancelled. They told me they could undo it, but only if I gave them a
credit card (I don't have one). Someone else intervened, and had them
look up my co-mentor, with whom I was meant to have been sharing a
room, and they passed me a note he had left for me: 'Jim, I'm at the
nearest bar. Meet me there.' They arranged that I would also share his
room, and I dumped my baggage, and met him at the bar (I'd have been
fine with taking the floor both nights, but he insisted on rotating.
I'd say I love that guy, but it's probably just the exposure to
Californians talking[1] <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I misplaced my power adapter and didn't bring my laptop to Google HQ
the next day[2], my email volume was too high to process on my iPod,
wifi was strained past breaking point at the hotel (300+ geeks in 1
place...) -- I eventually got Rick's email, but on Sunday; our
respective schedules didn't allow for a meeting to take place in the
end.
</p>

<p>
All that aside, I had a great time. I hope our application for 2010
will be successful and I get to repeat the experience, with a few
minor exceptions <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> The 'Advanced Trolling' session alone was worth
the trip.
</p>


<p>
[1] I'm already overusing the word 'awesome'; my friends and family
have promised to beat me out of that habit.
</p>

<p>
[2] Also, I was too hungover to search effectively... I managed to
write 'localisation' as L12N (adding in the 'l' and 'n') for our talk
topic; something I won't be allowed to live down in a hurry. That I
fell asleep at a table (drink + fatigue + not being able to remember
where 'my' room was) and had to be guided to my room was forgotten
after the next night. (I drank 'til 5.30 in a much more moderate way
(language nerds seem to out-party everyone else), and woke fresh as a
daisy at 8.30)

<p>
This, I think, needs more explanation.
</p>

<p>
The basic idea was:
</p>

<p>
1) To know when you're being trolled, you need to understand trolling
</p>

<p>
2) Trolling can lead to improvements =&gt; x.org no longer needs a config
file (at this, the ob. troll from the crowd rang 'But that used to be
the only decent documentation we got')
</p>

<p>
3) Trolling itself is a valuable part of nerd culture =&gt; Unix Hater's
Handbook; most e-mail from Linus.
</p>

<p>
There are some photos here:

(reverse order, so follow the 'Previous' button), but most of the
humour is lost in them.
</p>

<p>
For advanced trolling in action, Duke Leto's twitter stream is a good
start: <a href='http://twitter.com/dukeleto'>http://twitter.com/dukeleto</a> "~@al3x Obviously you are not hip
with the open source community. Trolling is the highest form of
flattery." "Hey @slava_pestov and @chromatic_x , who is working on
#factor on #parrot ? You do know the dinosaurs turned into birds..."
