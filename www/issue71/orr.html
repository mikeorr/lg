On September 6, I, um, dropped a fork on my hard drive while it was running.  
I asked The Answer Gang and Nick Moffitt what other foolish things they've done
with their computers, and here are the responses.

<H2>The Case of the Dropped Fork</H2>

<P> I keep my computer's
cover open to avoid overheating.  A fork fell off my desk, through the
computer case and landed on the hard drive.  The other half of the fork landed
on the, um, power supply.  Fortunately not *in* the power supply. 
<IMG ALT=":)" SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="24">  
I extracted the fork--being glad I didn't get a shock--and then discovered I
couldn't save my nedit files ("read-only file system").  The disk light stayed
on continuously.  I ran 'mount' and got an input/output error.  Suspecting the
drive was fried, I wrote down all the changes I'd made to my Python files in
the nedit windows.  I tried "su -c mount /Backups" to mount my backup partition
on the other drive, but it wouldn't do anything.  I got most of the way through
writing down my changes when nedit aborted.  I closed what I could and tried to
quit the X session, but the computer froze.  I pressed Reset, but it wouldn't
get past the BIOS.  I turned off the computer, waited a bit, and turned it back
on.  This time it booted OK.

<P> The computer ran for a couple days, then then it started crashing in
the middle of the night and on bad days I would get two Oopses a day.
My roommate
strongly hinted I fix my computer, because he works at night and depends on it
being the Internet gateway for his Windows boxen.  I wanted to install <A
HREF="http://www.rocklinux.org">ROCK Linux</A> and try it out, so this gave me
an excuse.  But I couldn't get through the installation routine without an
Oops.  It didn't matter whether both HDs were connected or only one.  Thinking
something unknown might be wrong with the computer besides just the hard drive,
I got the parts to build another computer: AMD Duron 800 (more than twice as
fast as my K6 350 woohoo!), the cheapest brand-name HD (10 GB), and a PCI
Ethernet card and sound card (because my new motherboard didn't have ISA
slots), and an ATX case.  Next month, I'll write about my adventures 
installing ROCK.

<H2>The Viking Ship</H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:nick@zork.net">Nick Moffitt</A> 

<P> I haven't got any blunder stories for you, but here's
something we used to do with computer hardware back in high school:

<P> My brother's school at the time had a bunch of surplus IBM
model Bs (predecessor of the XT I think) that I took home.  I only had
so many outlets in my room (I had used up all the plugs I dared, and
was using oil lamps to light the place, but that's another story), so
I had no use for most of them myself.

<P> My friend Jason had a bunch of clock-chip crystals from some
card that ran at 66MHz or something.  He probably got them from Boeing
Surplus, where you can buy drill bits by the pound, hard hats for a
dollar, and Ultrasparc pieces as-is.  At least, that was the way it
used to be.

<P> So we built a crude Viking ship out of spare plywood and set
a model B atop it.  I ran an extension cord out into the yard to power
it, Jason inserted the crystal, and we watched, entranced, as the poor
4.77MHz chip slowly slagged itself.  It smelled to high heaven, and
the boat didn't catch on fire, so we resorted to setting flaming peeps
adrift in his bathtub for our Viking funerals.

<P> "What do you suppose the reaction will be once they reach
Valhalla?" Jason asked.  

<P> "OLAF LOOK!  BUN-NY!" &lt;stomp&gt; &lt;squish&gt;

<H4>Iron writes:</H4>

When I worked at an ISP, we got our servers from the Boeing Surplus.  The owner
would buy ten of them at once, whatever model they were selling at $30 each
including monitor.  The first time, it was these miscellaneous stray 386s.  Two
years later, it was Dell 486s.

<P> At Bumbershoot (a multi-arts festival every Labor Day weekend), in the art
exhibit was a set of ferry-boat models made out of driftwood with scrounged
parts, with white Christmas lights inside.  They actually looked pretty cool.

<H2>Upgrade Hell</H2>
By <A HREF="mailto:stern@starshine.org">Heather Stern</A>

<P> Gosh, so many years in computing, hard to think what was the dumbest
thing... oh yeah, we can narrow it down to just Linux.

<P> Heh.

<P> I think the dumbest thing I've done with my laptop is upgrade it all in
one day before I needed it for something... but doesn't everyone do THAT?
Face it, upgrades are dangerous.

<P> But you know, if you ate whole herrings like Tux you wouldn't have had that
fork bomb.

<P> &lt;badum Ching!&gt;

<H2>I/O Cards</H2>
By <A HREF="mailto:pilolla@gateway.net">Chris Gianakopoulos</A>

<P> My dumbest computer act was unplugging and reinserting I/O cards in my
S-100 (CP/M) system because I didn't want to wait that long 3-second
duration for CP/M to reboot when I was fixing my hardware.  After about 40
Acts of Boldness, I finally plugged in the I/O card not quite so straight
into the socket and there were lots of sparks.

<P> I just took it apart, and after two weeks (front panel dangling on the
floor), I decided to fix the thing.  One killer, though.  The computer
would randomly crash and the front panel lights (it was an Altair 8800
with an 18-slot motherboard), would just light up.  After 4 months, when
it got in one of its moods, I got a frequency counter and saw that the
system clock was superposed where it should not have been.  Looking up the
signal definitions and the connector pinouts, I saw that there was a piece
of copper (from my hot-swapped I/O card connector fingers) shorting the
system clock to some other pin (I cannot remember the signals except that
one of them was the bus clock).  Yes I was electronically oriented (a real
computer hacker), and that's what made me so careless.

<P> Not only that, but I was unplugging and reinserting the
I/O card without removing power from the computer.  How cool I was!

<H3> <A HREF="mailto:jkarns@csd.net">John Karns</A> writes:</H3>

Hmm, you just dated yourself [about the Altair 8800]--and to join you, I'll
admit that I remember those!  I think it was the same model Altair that one of
my college classes was assigned to write a low-pass filter algorithm
for--assembler debugging was a bear, as programming tools were non-existent--at
least for us.

<H3> Chris writes:</H3>

Those were the days of CP/M.  But, now we have Linux, so that we have
those days and more!

<H3>Iron writes:</H3>

Especially with all those emulators Linux has.  

<H3>John writes:</H3>

<P> I still have a 486 / 100 on which I ran Slackware.  Although I haven't used
it in a while, it actually runs X tolerably well, thanks to the SCSI HD.

<P> I just wish they would offer SCSI on laptops - every time my system does a
disk buffer flush, there's a short and noticeable pause if I happen to be
moving the cursor around the screen to remind me that I'm running an IDE
HD.  IMO, using a SCSI HD yields a gain similar to having ample RAM in
the machine - helps smooth things out.

<H3>Iron writes:</H3>
What does "superposed" mean?  [Regarding the system clock that was 
superposed where it should not have been.]

<H3>Chris writes:</H3>

<P> I read too many linear systems books.  Some books will call the term
superposed, and other books will call the term superimposed (more
intuitive).  Anyway, it means one mathematical function algebraically
summed with another mathematical functions.  For example, you might have
a 5 volt DC signal with a 240 millivolt sinusoidal signal riding on top
of the 5 volt signal.  So, you would have a sine wave with an amplitude
of 240 millivolts and a DC offset of 5 volts.

<P> I suspect that you understand what I just said.  You were probably
wondering where the heck I concocted a word such as "superpose".
Usually the word is used in the context of superposition with respect to
a linear system.  I'm not gonna start talking about superposition,
because you will probably kill me for rambling (again).

<P> Anyway, I saw a 1-MHz signal appearing where it
shouldn't have been.
I'm sorry -- I talk so much.  Get me talking about science and stuff and
I ramble......

<H3>Iron writes:</H3>

<P> I figured it meant the same thing as superimposed.  I just couldn't,
with my puny understanding of electronics, figure out how a system
clock could "superimpose" itself somewhere, or why it would matter.

<H3>Chris writes:</H3>

<P> Oh, now I understand.  Utilizing my puny mind, I got bold and was
unplugging circuit boards (and plugging them back into the motherboard)
with the power on the computer!  After fixing my fried computer, every
now and then, I could not boot up the computer.  All of the front panel
lights, on the Altair 8800 computer, just lit up (abnormally).  When I
finally fixed the problem, I saw that there was a piece of copper
short-circuiting the system clock signal to an adjacent pin inside one
of the card edge connectors (These were 100-pin connectors - thus, the
S-100 bus).

<P> The piece of copper was a portion of foil that got sort of torn off
from the edge connector of the I/O card that I was constantly removing
and plugging into the computer.

<H2>Cold Therapy</H2>
By <A HREF="mailto:guy@gmnow.net">Guy Milliron</A>

<P> I do this (Sorta) all the time with my PCs (currently).  I have only one
floppy drive.  So when I need to use it on any system (Linux systems or my 
OS-challenged systems), I just hot-swap it in.. power, I/O cables and all!

<P> Reason: Just like you, I don't want to wait.  The Challenged OS takes 7
minutes to boot, linux only takes like less than two (But I lose my uptime
longevity).

<P> The most foolish thing I've done?   Has got to be when I had a 386 CPU that
would overheat and crash the system due to my power supply fan had gone out.
So three or four times daily I would take 2 zip lock bags and fill them with
ice cubes and put them IN the computer right on top of the CPU.  It actually
worked very well until I was able to buy a new system.

<P> BTW, I still have that same 386/33 motherboard.  Was going to make it a
Linux Router, till I found the LinkSYS router.

<H3>Iron writes:</H3>

That takes the cake!  If I could draw, I'd make a picture of a computer with
melting ice cubes in it.

<H2>Leaky Laptop</H2>
By <A HREF="mailto:jkarns@csd.net">John Karns</A>

<P> As recently as this past Spring I put my laptop into a backpack to bring
to a friend's house along with some other things, one of which was ... a
water bottle.  Well, the top wasn't really screwed onto the bottle very
securely, and ... you can guess what happened.  When I arrived at my
destination and pulled the backpack out of the car, I noticed that the
seat was very damp.  Upon checking the contents of the backpack and
removing the laptop, water sort of dripped out of the side of the machine
as I held it sideways / vertical.

<P> I took it inside and disassembled it partially, and left it on a table
with a fan blowing into it.  The important thing to remember in such cases
is not to turn on the machine (or other electronic device)!  After I took
it home I removed the mobo and left it over-night.  Luckily, the machine
survived the ordeal, without damage to the HD.  The screen showed a few
white spots, but those went away after a few weeks - sigh of relief.  I
was just glad that it was the older laptop and not the one I had just
bought a week before.

<H3>Iron writes:</H3>

That's another picture I'd draw: a laptop with water dripping out the side.

<P> <EM>If you would like to tell us about the most foolish thing you've done
with your computer, maybe we'll publish it.
