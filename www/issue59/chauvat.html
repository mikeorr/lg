<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Narval is an Intelligent Personal Assistant software, released under
the GNU Public License by <a href="http://www.logilab.org/">Logilab</a>.
It was used to set up Gazo, a bot that is assisting the group of
volunteers that translates <I>Linux Gazette</I> into French, by taking care
of most of the coordination-related work. Narval features artificial
intelligence and agent technologies and contributes to change the way we
use the Internet and computers. Narval stands for <em>Network Assistant Reasoning
with a Validating Agent Language</em>.</p>

<h2>Gazo, a real-life example</h2>

<p>When I took over the coordination of the <a
href="http://www.traduc.org/lgazette/">French translation of <I>Linux
Gazette</I></a>, I was quickly faced with the very same problem the former
coordinator had to deal with: time. Coordination is no brain work, but it
can quickly take up a large amount of time: scan your mailbox for e-mails
from people offering to translate an article, check that it is not taken
yet, send back an answer, update the web page, merge all the articles into
one monthly issue... It seemed to me that I was always losing most of my
time with repetitive tasks and losing other people's time when not being
able to send back an answer right away saying "go ahead" or "this one is
already taken". In other words, I had an itch to scratch.</p>

<p>I can hear you say "Just write a server script and let your
contributors ask for articles using HTML forms!". I had three reasons for
not doing it. The first one was that some people back then did not have
web access, only e-mail. The second reason was that I didn't want to cut
off the translation of <I>Linux Gazette</I> from the rest of the translation
of the LDP, hence I wanted to keep using the mailing-list<a href="#note1">[1]</a>.
Last but not least, I had already been doing some work in the field of artificial
intelligence and agents and thought it would be a nice opportunity to try
out a couple ideas. I named that agent Gazo, after the magazine you are
currently reading.</p>

<p>The first version of Gazo was nothing like the Narval framework. It was
a single python script that would get incoming mail from procmail. Gazo
was fed a copy of every e-mail I would receive and try to figure out if it
concerned <I>Linux Gazette</I> by looking for keywords in the subject. If it
did, it would parse the subject field using regular expressions, trying to
extract the demand of the user, which could be one of the following: ask
for an article, send a translation, send a proof-read translation or
abandon an article. A typical subject for offering to translate the
article F of the issue 58 was "<tt>[lg] asking for article 58 F</tt>". In
case Gazo found a match for the subject it would execute several
actions.</p>

<ol>
<li>When someone asks for an article, check he is not already
translating two articles and that the article is not already assigned to
someone else. If everything is OK, assign the article to that person, send
him a confirmation e-mail, update the web page and tell the coordinator
(me) what was done.</li>

<li>When someone sends a translation, check that the article was assigned
to him, save the attached file to the
<tt>in-progress/translated/</tt> directory on the FTP server, send an
e-mail to thank the contributor, pick up one of the volunteer
proof-readers who has the fewest articles assigned and notify him via
e-mail that he has a new article to proof-read, then update the web page
and tell the coordinator what was done.</li>

<li>When someone sends a proof-read translation, check that the article
was assigned to him, save the attached file to the
<tt>in-progress/proof-read/</tt> directory on the FTP server, thank the
sender, update the web page and tell the coordinator what was done.</li>

<li>When someone sends an abandon notification, save the attached file to
the <tt>in-progress/unfinished/</tt> directory on the FTP server, say
"thank you anyway", update the web page and tell the coordinator what was
done.</li>

<li>Every week, post a list of the articles waiting to be translated and
remind the people who are translating articles that they have not sent
their translation yet and can abandon it if they do not have time to
complete it.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, there's no surprise here, just writing e-mail, moving
files around and keeping everything synchronized. And as you probably know
already, in computer science, "without surprise" often rhymes with
"can be automated" (well, could have...;-).</p>

<p>That first script worked well for over a year, but proved to be
difficult to extend, because describing sequences of actions and testing
for all possible error cases required writing a lot of code. Another
itch needed scratching... but it took much longer than the first one and
more than myself to deal with it. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the Narval Project.</p>

<h2>Narval</h2>

<p>When you spend most of your day using your computer to work with other
people on several projects, keep in touch with friends, try not to lose
ground on the news front and answer phone calls, you soon realize that
what you really need is someone or something that does part of your work
for you. That someone exists and is called a secretary or an assistant.
They are real people, work for money, sleep at night and do not
necessarily add up two ten digits numbers in 10e-9 seconds. That
something exists too. There are a few instances of it in several AI labs,
but unlike the former, they're not that smart. Nonetheless, let's be
optimistic and call those somethings Intelligent Personal Assistants.</p>

<p>Narval is one of them. It borrows from advanced techniques like petri
nets, rule-based systems, programming by contracts, planning, automated
learning, component programming and XML, to let one release the pressure
of repetitive work.</p>

<p>Narval executes recipes, that are sequences of actions linked by
transitions. An action can be downloading a web page, performing a
database query, transforming a piece of XML, sending an e-mail or whatever
you may want to wrap in a few lines of python code. Conditions can be
associated to transitions so that you can control the execution path
through the graph representing a recipe. That gives you the basic
vocabulary to control the flow of execution through different branches of
your recipe and to coordinate concurrent tasks.</p>

<p>Using a graphical user interface named Horn (Narval is French for
narwhal or narwhale, see below), a user can create a new recipe in a few mouse
clicks by assembling building blocks (actions from the library, other recipes)
and specifying the conditions associated to the transitions that link blocks
together.</p>

<p>In Narval, everything is represented using XML: action prototypes,
pieces of information, recipes, etc. XML provides a basic format to
express the structure of the data that is manipulated. If you have ever
worked with a Unix shell, you probably have realized the power of the
pipes that let you do a lot of work by making a data stream flow thru
filters and programs. Similarly, Narval executes recipes by passing XML
fragments from an action to another, an important difference being that
with Narval, the stream of execution goes thru a graph, not a sequence. At
each step, pieces of XML are transformed and/or created. Narval keeps
track of what did what.</p>

<p>In Narval, actions have complex prototypes that borrow from programming
by contracts. A prototype specifies conditions on the XML nodes the action
needs as input and will return as output, whether it can process a list or
not, etc. For each input and output a set of XPath expressions is used to
define the name of the tag, the value of an attribute, etc. When executing
the actions, Narval will use these expressions to detect errors and
failures and abort the recipe if it has no way to recover. That provides a
permanent run-time verification mechanism that reveals itself quite useful
and that Eiffel programmers already know of.</p>

<p>The new version of Gazo is built on top of Narval as a set of recipes.
It does the same as its predecessor, but is expressed in a higher-level
graphical language, is easier to modify and maintain and will benefit from
the other capabilities of Narval, such as error recovery, learning (this
user always takes a lot of time, do not let him have more than one
article), etc. An image being worth a thousand words,  I won't go
thru the details of Gazo's behavior once again, just read the above
description while looking at the two screen-shots below, then
try to answer the following question: which one is more expressive,
those graphs or 1000 lines of python script? The labels prefixed by
<tt>Gazo</tt> correspond to bits of python code, the ones with underscores
are XSL transformations and the others are recipes. The first screen-shot
is the top-level recipe, the second one is the "Ask for article" recipe.</p>

<p>What's new in this? One may object that the coordination problem
described above could have been solved using a simple web application and
that commands have been included in the subject of e-mails even before the
first mailing-list management software. Both are true, but completely miss
the point. Narval is, in a sense, an interpreter for a high-level
graphical language, and draws its power and simplicity of use from
features such as complex action prototypes and contracts, run-time
arguments selection, rule-based mechanisms, large action library, etc.</p>

<p>Narval is not an application, but a framework to create your personal
assistant in a few mouse clicks.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Narval's ambition is to be the best Intelligent Personal Assistant
available on the Net and to grow into a software that really deserves the
adjective Intelligent.</p>

<p>In our group of developers, we already have a Narval that helps to
coordinate our projects. Each of us has its own Narval that assists him
by filtering out junk ads from web pages, fetches the daily cartoons,
summarizes in one page the news from different web sites, checks the agenda
and sends reminders for appointments, accepts voice commands and answers
using text-to-speech free software.</p>

<p>Applications are endless, as with any programming language. Our plans
are twofold. On the one hand, integrate in the libraries all the actions
we can think of: voice modem to be able to "phone home" and tell your
assistant what to do, home automation protocols like X10 to control your
home, cell-phone and PDA features, etc. As stated, new actions can easily
be added with a few lines of python code. On the other hand, we will
develop and implement the intelligent features the Narval framework was
designed for, but that are missing at the time of this writing: planning,
learning and cooperation with other assistants.</p>

<p><em>Planning</em>. Once you have a sufficient number of actions, a set of basic
recipes and a description of the relations between different concepts, you
can start doing planning: you give your assistant a goal, like "suggest me a
movie for tonight", and it will figure out a sequence of
actions that will make it fulfill that goal (extract critics or rankings from a
movie web site, compare to the user preferences, look up the theatre schedule
and send back the suggestion to the user). The prototypes of the
actions are particularly useful for this.</p>

<p><em>Learning</em>. In Narval, everything is represented using XML. Each piece
of information has a structure. Each piece of information has a timestamp.
Each piece of information has a trace: what produced it, what used it, for what
purpose, etc. If you have any experience with automatic learning, you know that
this is a valuable setup on top of which it is possible to implement many algorithms.
Using learning techniques, your assistant could realize that every Friday, you visit a
web site about movies, then offer you to add that site to your Friday daily
newspaper or start searching for movie critics.</p>

<p><em>Cooperation</em>. Making two people or two assistants cooperate is often
a matter of protocols. If you want them to be smarter, it becomes a
problem of recognizing what the other is doing. Having recipes as
explicit sequences of actions and having all the features mentioned about
learning is of real value in tackling cooperation.</p>

<h2>Are we alone out there?</h2>

<p>Narval is the only Intelligent Personal Assistant released as free
software that we know of. At least three companies have commercial
products that we consider related, even if they do not belong to the same
category for they are not as generic nor customizable and extensible as
Narval.</p>

<p>The first one is the software that comes with the <a
href="http://www.tivo.com/">TiVo VCR</a>. It fetches the TV program for
you, helps you to set up the recording of a show, and may even suggest a
movie to watch depending on what genre of movies you have watched
lately.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.prodyparrot.com/">Prody Parrot</a>, from Mindmaker, was
shipped with Sound Blaster sound cards for some time. Working on windows
only, it would help you sort your e-mail, remind you of your appointments,
download web pages and summarize them, entertain you by dialoguing as if
it were a psychoanalyst (ever tried Eliza in Emacs?), using speech recognition
and text-to-speech. Those are quite nice features, but you wouldn't set up an
assistant like Gazo with that software...</p>

<p>The last one is a web application named <a
href="http://www.oneredcube.com/">One Red Cube</a> that acts as a personal
communication hub that can redirect your phone calls, your faxes and your
e-mails from one device to the other. Nothing like an assistant, but the
idea of integration is there.</p>

<p>There are also three free software projects that work on things loosely
related to Narval and worth mentioning. The <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bayonne/bayonne.html">GNU Bayonne</a>
project, as a Computer Telephony Integrated server, could very well end-up as
a valid competitor to One Red Cube. The <a
href="http://misterhouse.sourceforge.net/">Mister House project</a> is a
nice home automation system that implements many features. Provided you're
not afraid to write some perl code and get your hands dirty, it will let
your house play a song when you walk up the stairs, ask quiz questions
during breakfast and download the weather forecast when you ask for it on
the phone. Last, the <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/piper/">Piper</a>
project is building a visual shell that let you federate resources from
different hosts using a graphical user interface to draw a flow chart
analogous to streams and pipes.</p>

<h2>Exotic whales</h2>

<P> Narval in French, narwhale in English, is a sea
mammal that lives in the Arctic Ocean. The male has a tooth that grows out
of his mouth and turns into a long tusk. The Narval's tusk was believed to
be a unicorn horn and sold in Europe during the middle ages (and later),
thus proving the existence of the unicorn.

<P> Our prototype system was called Al, named after the HAL computer in
<I>2001: A Space Odyssey</I>.  When we where looking for a name, we wanted to
keep the Al syllable, and we ended up with Narval.  It offers a nice acronym
and a nice mascot.(Linux has Tux the penguin; we have Ornicar the narwhale! :-)
Since the narwhale is known for its tusk, we wanted to use that name for the
companion user interface, but Horn offers a better acronym (Human ORiented
Narval interface), so we did as if it was a unicorn horn and not a Narval tusk.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope this article made you feel like trying Narval and learning
more about artificial intelligence, agent technologies and their
applications to real-life problems. Feel free to join our
<a href="http://www.logilab.org/dev.html#ml">mailing lists</a> to
discuss further these matters.</p>

<p>That's all folks, Happy Hacking!</p>

<p><a name="note1">[1]</a> Like the Linux Documentation Project itself, the French
translation project is volunteer work. The principal medium for discussion, help and
most of the coordination is a mailing-list.
