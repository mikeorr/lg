Anybody tried the ASUS eee PC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eee_pc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eee_pc</a>) ?
I'm thinking about getting the 8GB model which costs $500.  It's a 2
lb subnotebook with 1 GB RAM, 8 GB flash "memory", and Xandros (based
on Debian/Corel), and compatible with the Debian repository.  I
haven't seen one and they seem hard to find even mail order, though
some Best Buys have the 4 GB model.  My main concerns are the small
keyboard, 800x600 screen, and one-button touchpad.  But as a second
computer for running Python, Firefox, Kopete, gvim, and maybe the Gimp
when traveling, I think it might do OK.
</p>

<p>
Any opinions on the other Linux (sub)notebooks which have begun
appearling?  I thought about the Zonbu but it has a nonstandard
version of Gentoo tied to their subscription plan.

<p>
The 800x600 screen would be a deal-breaker, for me.  X11 simply sucks at
less than 1024x768.

Here's my reply to my mother-in-law, when she asked me about a different
(but related) "EEE PC" model:

Hadn't seen or heard of, before today.  I note the link to
<a href="http://www.itwire.com/content/view/15490/">http://www.itwire.com/content/view/15490/</a> , making clear that ASUS is
violating the copyright of Linux kernel maintainers and shipping
binary-only support for their ACPI firmware (possibly ineptitude rather
than malice, but it's still clear copyright violation).  Also that
they've put "warranty void seals" over the RAM bay and mini-PCI opening,
in violation of US consumer law.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASUS_Eee_PC</a> says there are actually four
models with the name "ASUS EEE".
</p>

<p>
It's pretty severely anemic:  900 MHz Celeron, 256MB standard RAM, 7"
display maxing out at 800 x 480.  (Ouch!)  Solid-state flash memory is
used as mass-storage, which is permanently soldered to the motherboard.
Preinstalled Linux distro is gimmicked to not see any RAM above 1 GB (if
you void your warranty and add RAM).
</p>

<p>
Motherboard is an Intel "Alviso-GM" aka 910GML, one of the "Centino
Mobile" series.  Northbridge is 82910GML.  Southbridge is one of the
ICH6M class.   Integrated Intel GMA900 video.
</p>

<p>
Basically, if you want a severely limited machine offered by a
manipulative firm with an attitude problem, it might be OK, but you can
get a much better machine for the same money on the used market.  The
screen is a particularly nasty limitation, because you can't upgrade to
fix it, even in theory.

Mike,
</p>

<p>
Recently, while visiting a car exhibition in Bangalore, I laid my
hands on this gadget (of course, it seems not connected, car
exhibition and subnotebooks !).
</p>

<p>
It was on display by an Indian company (SPIN something???) and I
managed to play around with this toy inspite of my daughter's
insistence to move on to the bigger stalls <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
The guys at the booth allowed me free access; it was loaded with a
modified version of Debian. Certainly, the screen and the keyboard are
a limitation if you consider to use it continuously for long periods.
Should be suitable for use while on the road <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
Sorry, I could not offer much on the applications' availability,
system features and other things.
</p>

<p>
One last thing, I did launch OpenOffice and used the Writer to type
(scribbled, to be correct) in few sentences to feel the keyboard.
That's when I felt the keyboard thing.
</p>

Yes -- a colleague of mine has one at work.  They're retailing for ~
?250 here in the UK which is very cheap.  It's a nicely designed
laptop, works well with Ubuntu, but the screen is rather small IMO, at
just 1024x768 resolution maximum.
