<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Processes operate within their own virtual address
space and are protected by the operating system from interference by other
processes. By default a user process cannot communicate with another process
unless it makes use of secure, kernel managed mechanisms. There are many
times when processes will need to share common resources or synchronise
their actions. One possibility is to use threads, which by definition can
share memory within a process. This option is not always possible (or wise)
due to the many disadvantages which can be experienced with threads. Methods
of passing messages or data between processes are therefore required.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Linux</FONT></B> supports
the following methods of communication. System V IPC refers to the version
of Unix in which the concepts noted below were first introduced.</FONT>

</TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Signals are used to signal asynchronous
events between processes. A process may implement a signal handler to carry
out required when an event occurs or may use the system default actions.
Most signals can be ignored or blocked, though the KILL signal cannot be
ignored and will result in a non clean process exit.</FONT></TD>

</TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><FONT SIZE=+1>A pipe connects the standard output
of one process to the standard input of another. They provide a method
of one-way communication between processes in a parent-child relationship
and for this reason may be called half duplex pipes.</FONT></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="20%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Named Pipes (FIFOs)</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Named pipes appear similar to
regular pipes but are implemented as device special First In-First Out
(FIFO) files in the file system. It is not necessary for processes to maintain
a parent-child relationship for them to communicate via named pipes. Named
pipes are persistent and may be reused after their initial setup.</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="20%"><FONT SIZE=+1>System V IPC Message Queues</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Message queues consist of a linked
list within the kernel's addressing space. Messages are added to the queue
sequentially and may be retrieved from the queue in several different ways.</FONT></TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="20%"><FONT SIZE=+1>System V IPC Semaphores</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Semaphores are counters used to
control access to shared resources by multiple processes. They are most
often used as a locking mechanism to prevent processes from accessing a
particular resource while another process is performing operations on it.
Semaphores are implemented as sets, though a set may have a single member.</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="20%"><FONT SIZE=+1>System V IPC Shared Memory</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Shared memory is a mapping of
an area of memory into the address space of more than one process. This
is the fastest form of IPC as processes do not subsequently need access
to kernel services in order to share data.</FONT></TD>
</TR>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="20%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Full-duplex pipes (STREAMS)</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><FONT SIZE=+1>STREAMS were introduced by AT&amp;T
and are used for character based I/O within the kernel and between it?s
associated device drivers as a full duplex transfer path between processes.
Internally pipes may be implemented as STREAMS.</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80%"><FONT SIZE=+1>Sockets allow local or network
connection between processes. Socket names are implemented within a domain.
In the UNIX domain a socket is given a path name within the file system.
Other processes may use that name to communicate.</FONT></TD>
