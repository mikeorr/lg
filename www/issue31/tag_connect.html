Dear Answer Guy,
</strong></p>


<p><strong>
I have a question that I can't seem to find any refernce to in any
of the regular documentation, (though I must admit, I only searched
for about an hour this time, and sporadically over the last month or so).
</strong></p>


<p><strong>
How can you tell the connection speed that a modem auto-negotiates
when dialing an ISP? My system log (<tt>/var/log/messages</tt> in RH5.1) does
tell me the line speed I have set in the chat script, but I would
like to know the connect speed as well (56K, 33.6, etc). I know this
info must be available somewhere/somehow.
</strong></p>

>I've gotten questions like this before and I never
did find an answer.  Indeed I actually beg the question
itself.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>My problem with the question amounts to a couple of 
rhetorical questions in return:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Who cares?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>What are you going to do based on this metric?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>At first these questions may seem hostile.  But
they aren't intended in that sense.  There are both
practical and philosophical aspects to this.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Are you going to return the modem to your vendor
or retailer if it doesn't "live up to" some speed?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Are you going to switch to a different ISP if 
their connect speed is better than your current average?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Are you going to force the phone company to 
pull new wire to your home, resplice their cables, or replace equipment 
in their CO based on these results?
</blockquote>

<blockquote>You used the term "info" --- the "info must be
available somewhere" --- but what is the real informational
content of this number.  Let's say you connect at 49000 bps
--- your effective throughput is likely to vary throughout
the duration of each call.  The factors involved may be
quite different but they all have one thing in common ---
they are probably not anything you can effectively do anything about.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Certainly you can do metrics on latency and throughput
by running scripts between two hosts (after synchronizing
their clocks).  That could give you highly accurate <em>data</em>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>I personally still question the <em>informational</em> content of
that data. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>So, I'm going to sound like a curmudgeon and say:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>I don't know how to get that data, and
I don't care to spend more time trying to find out.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>... However, I'll forward this for publication in 
this months LG --- and I'll forward any responses
back to you.  (To respect your privacy we normally 
don't publish your e-mail addresses in LG.  That does
result in a bit of extra work on my part --- but I don't mind).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>On an academic level I'm curious what answers and
suggestions we'll see.  I'll be curious where this
number comes from and what it "means."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>On a practical level I try to configure my systems 
and my work habits so I just don't have to care if
my modem is working at 28.8, 33.6, 14.4 or whatever.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you search the Answer Guy archives on the terms
"modem" or "benchmark and you'll probably also find 
some other choice comments I've made about the marketing 
claims of modem vendors (and CPU vendors for that matter).
</blockquote>


<blockquote>I have similar opinions about most claims of "speed" 
as a feature.

>PS, I am using the standard RH5.1 "if-up" scripts, but have used my
own "ppp-on" style script in the past. I currently wrap my "if-up"
script with a ppp-on script that looks like:
</p></strong>

<pre>
>-------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash


cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
./ifup-ppp ifcfg-ppp0 &amp;
-------------------------------------------------
</pre>


<STRONG><P>
and "ppp-off" looks like:
</p></strong>


<pre>
>-------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash


cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
./ifdown-ppp ifcfg-ppp0 &amp;
-------------------------------------------------
</pre>


<STRONG><P>
I can offer more information if needed. Thank you for any light you
can shed on this issue.

>I don't think these have anything to do with how 
fast or slow your modems are.  If you want to 
reduce the amount of traffic that flows over these
lines while running PPP --- run a caching <tt>named</tt< (and
point the first entry in your <TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT> to 
the localhost address: <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>) and a copy of Squid 
or <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>'s cache proxy 
and configure your browsers to use this WWW cache.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your frustration with slow modems seems palpable
--- and the great backward regulatory morass that 
is our telecommunications infrastructure doesn't 
leave you (or me) many alternatives.
