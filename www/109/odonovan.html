<h1>GNU Octave - An Introduction</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/odonovan.html">Barry O'Donovan</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>This is the first of a series of articles in which I will
introduce <a href="http://www.octave.org/">GNU Octave</a> and
demonstrate some of its many features. GNU Octave is a high-level
language for numerical computations. I use it every day in my PhD
research which involves manipulating large vectors and matrices. It
is very similar in syntax and function to a commercial application
called <a href="http://www.matlab.com/">Matlab</a>. The biggest
difference between the two is that Octave is released under the GNU
General Public License, which means it can be freely distributed
and/or modified, while a single-user academic license for the basic
Matlab currently costs US$700.</p>

<p>I have convinced a few of my colleagues to give Octave a try
instead of Matlab. In every case, once that person stops looking
for the differences between the two and decides to give Octave a
real chance, they begin to embrace its usefulness, its features and
its free availability. They realise that they can install a copy of
Octave onto every one of their simulation servers, their laptops
and their home computers without having to purchase costly new
licenses for each one.</p>

<h3>Installing and Running Octave</h3>
The source code for Octave can be downloaded from <a href=
"http://www.octave.org/download.html">http://www.octave.org/download.html</a>.
This site also contains information on where to get Octave in
binary form for Apple's OS X and Windows. Most Linux distributions
include Octave as standard and if it is not already installed on
your system it should simply be a matter of installing the Octave
package from your installation CDs or the Internet.

<p>Starting the Octave interpreter under Linux is as simple as
typing the `<code>octave</code>' command:</p>

<pre class="code">
$ octave
GNU Octave, version 2.1.50 (i686-pc-linux-gnu).
Copyright (C) 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 John W. Eaton.

</pre>

<h3>Documentation</h3>
A 380 page manual is included with the Octave source code in HTML,
DVI and PS format. This manual is also available on-line at
Octave's home page. For those of you who installed via binary
packages, you should be able to access the manual via the
`<code>info</code>' command:<br>
<code>$ info octave</code><br>
If you are unfamiliar with 'info', then try using KDE's interface to
info by typing `<code>info:octave</code>' into Konqueror's location
bar.

<p>In this article I only intend to touch on the very basics of
Octave to demonstrate just how easy it is to pick up and use
effectively. I would strongly recommend, at the very least,
skimming through the available documentation to get a fuller flavor
of what Octave has to offer.</p>

<h3>First Steps by Example</h3>
Let's look at the problem of solving a system of <em>n</em> linear
equations in <em>n</em> unknowns:

<pre>
         x + 3y - 2z = -3
         
        3x - 4y + 3z = 28
        
        5x - 5y + 4z =  7
</pre>

Such a system of linear equations can be written as the single
matrix equation <code>A<strong>x</strong> =
<strong>b</strong></code>, where <code>A</code> is the coefficient
matrix, <code><strong>b</strong></code> is the column vector
containing the right-hand side of the linear equations and
<code><strong>x</strong></code> is the column vector representing
the solution. If you've forgotten your linear algebra then don't
worry - this will all become at lot clearer as we use Octave to
solve this for us:

<pre class="code">
octave:1&gt; A = [ 1, 3, -2; 3, -4, 3; 5, 5, -4 ]
A =

   1   3  -2
   3  -4   3
   5   5  -4

octave:2&gt; b = [ -3; 28; 7 ]
b =

   -3
   28
    7

octave:3&gt; A \ b
ans =

  5.0000
  2.0000
  7.0000

octave:4&gt;
</pre>
You will notice that each line of the interpreter is numbered
sequentially; I will use these line numbers when referring to
particular commands. On line 1 I defined <code>A</code> as a
<code>3x3</code> matrix containing the coefficients of the linear
system above (a coefficient is the number to the left of the
unknown variables <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and
<code>z</code>). The rows are delimited with a semi-colon and the
individual elements on each row are delimited by a comma. Each of
these is recommended but optional: a space is all that is needed to
delimit elements in a row and the return key could have been used
instead of semi-colons. I defined the column vector
<code><strong>b</strong></code> on line 2 in the same way.

<p>Line 3 computes the solution of the linear system using the
`left division' operator which, for the mathematicians among you,
is conceptually equivalent to
<code>A<sup>-1</sup><strong>b</strong></code>. By solution, I mean
that <code>x = 5</code>, <code>y = 2</code> and <code>z = 7</code>
will satisfy all three equations of the linear system.</p>

<p>Plotting the solution to a problem in mathematics is often the
key to fully understanding that problem. Octave has a number of
functions for plotting two- and three-dimensional graphs which use
Gnuplot to handle the actual graphics themselves. As a simple
example, let's plot the <code>sin( x )</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:9&gt; x = [ -pi:0.01:pi ];
octave:10&gt; plot( x, sin(x) )
octave:11&gt;     
</pre>
Which produces:

<p><img src="misc/odonovan/plot.png" alt="[Plot of a sine wave]"
border="0">
</p>

<p>Let's examine line 9 above in more detail:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pi</code> is one of many constants built in to Octave for
convenience and evaluates as 3.1415...</li>

<li>Octave has a range operator of the form
<code>begin:step:end</code> such that <code>[ 1:1:5 ]</code> is the
vector <code>[ 1 2 3 4 5 ]</code>. The step is optional and if it
is omitted then a step size of <code>1</code> is assumed:
<code>1:1:5</code> is the same as <code>1:5</code>.</li>

<li>You might have noticed that line 9 above produced no output to
the screen like similar commands did before. This is because we
ended the command with a semicolon which suppresses the output. In
the case above, <code>[ -pi:0.01:pi ]</code> creates a vector of
length 629 which we really don't want to print to the screen!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Types, Simple Arithmetic and Standard Functions</h3>
Octave's built-in data types are real and complex scalars and
matrices, character strings and a data structure type. All of the
standard arithmetic functions are available for scalars and
matrices:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>a + b<br>
(a - b)</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Addition (Subtraction). If both operands are
matrices then the number of rows and columns must both agree. If
one operand is a scalar and the other is a matrix, then that scalar
will be added (subtracted) to (from) every element of the
matrix.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>a .+ b<br>
(a .- b)</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Component-wise addition (subtraction) (also known
as element-by-element addition).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>x * y</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Multiplication. If both operands are matrices then
the number of columns of <code>x</code> must agree with the number
of rows or <code>y</code>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>x .* y</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Component-wise multiplication.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>x / y</code>

(y<sup>T</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> * x<sup>T</sup>
)<sup>T</sup></code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>x ./ y</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Component-wise right division</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>x \ y</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Left division. Conceptually equivalent to
<code>x<sup>-1</sup> * y</code></td>
</tr>

<td align="center"><code>x .\ y</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Component-wise left division.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>x ^ y<br>

</td>
<td align="left">Power operator. See the manual for definitions
when <code>x</code> and/or <code>y</code> is a matrix.</td>

<td align="center"><code>x .** y</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Component-wise power operation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>-x</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Negation</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>x'</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Complex conjugate transpose.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>x.'</code>
</td>
<td align="left">Transpose.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>There are many standard functions built-in to Octave and these
include the scalar functions:</p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>sin()</code>
</td>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>asin()</code>
</td>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>log()</code>
</td>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>abs()</code>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>cos()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>acos()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>log2()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>sqrt()</code>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>tan()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>atan()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>log10()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>sign()</code>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><code>round()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>floor()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>ceil()</code>
</td>
<td align="center"><code>mod()</code>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>the vector functions:</p>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>max()</code>
</td>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>sum()</code>
</td>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>median()</code>

<td align="center" width="100"><code>norm(,p)</code>
</td>
<td align="left">- compute the p-norm of a matrix</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center" width="100"><code>rank()</code>
</td>
<td align="left">- the rank of a matrix</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Strings can be declared with either single or double quotes:<br>
<code>&gt; fname = "Barry";<br>
&gt; sname = "O'Donovan";<br></code> Strings can be concatenated
using the same notation as matrix definitions:<br>
<code>&gt; [ fname, " ", sname ]<br>
ans = Barry O'Donovan<br></code></p>

<p>There are many string functions available as standard, including
functions for converting strings to numbers and vice-versa. There
are also a number of functions for printing strings to the screen
such as <code>disp()</code> and <code>printf()</code>, and for
reading data from the user such as <code>input()</code>.</p>

<h3>The Octave Environment</h3>
In all the cases above where we had an assignment command such as
<code>A = ...</code>, the variable <code>A</code> is created or
overwritten with the information on the right-hand side of the
assignment operator (<code>=</code>). Variable names are case
sensitive and made up of letters, digits and underscores but must
begin with a letter or underscore. Variables remain in the
interpreter's environment until you either exit the interpreter or
clear the variable:<br>
<code>&gt; clear A</code><br>
deletes the variable <code>A</code>, while:<br>
<code>&gt; clear</code><br>
deletes <strong>all</strong> variables currently stored. The
<code>who</code> command can be used to list all variables
currently stored in the environment.

<p>We would often like to save the current environment to disk as a
backup or to come back to it later and continue on from where we
left off. We can use the following two commands for this:<br>
<code>&gt; save</code> <em>filename</em><br>
to save all of the currently defined variables to <em>filename</em>
and:<br>
<code>&gt; load</code> <em>filename</em><br>
to load them again at a later point.</p>

<h3>Loops and Conditional Statements</h3>
Just like any other programming language, Octave has its loop and
conditional constructs. The following example demonstrates how to
generate the first 10 values of Fibonacci's sequence using a for
loop:

<pre class="code">
octave:11&gt; fib = [ 0, 1 ];
octave:12&gt; for i = 3:10
&gt; fib = [ fib, fib( i-2 ) + fib( i-1 ) ];
&gt; endfor
octave:13&gt; fib
fib =

   0   1   1   2   3   5   8  13  21  34

octave:14&gt;
</pre>
Fibonacci's sequence is described by <code>F<sub>k</sub> =
F<sub>k-1</sub> + F<sub>k-2</sub></code> with <code>F<sub>0</sub> =
0</code> and <code>F<sub>1</sub> = 1</code>. It is often used to
describe the population growth of rabbits: suppose that a newly
born pair of rabbits produce no offspring in the first month of
their lives and one new pair on each subsequent month. Starting
with <code>F<sub>1</sub> = 1</code> pairs in the first month,
<code>F<sub>k</sub></code> is the number of pairs in the
<em>k</em>th month assuming that none of the rabbits die.
Fibonacci's sequence occurs naturally in a variety of places and it
is one of those rare occurrences in mathematics where a simple
formula can be truly fascinating.

<p>Notice that in the above code:</p>

<ul>
<li>we redefine the vector <code>fib</code> using itself and one
new value; and</li>

<li>we can access individual elements of a vector by specifying the
element number in parenthesis.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following example evaluates the randomness of Octave's
<code>rand()</code> function and demonstrates it's conditional
statements:</p>

<pre class="code">
octave:14&gt; a = b = c = d = 0;
octave:15&gt; for i = 1:100000
&gt; r = rand(1);
&gt; if ( r &lt; 0.25 )
&gt;     a++;
&gt; elseif ( r &lt; 0.5 )
&gt;     b++;
&gt; elseif ( r &lt; 0.75 )
&gt;     c++;
&gt; else
&gt;     d++;
&gt; endif
&gt; endfor
octave:16&gt; a,b,c,d
a = 25115
b = 24870
c = 25045
d = 24970
octave:17&gt;
</pre>
Line 14 sets the scalar variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>,
<code>c</code> and <code>d</code> to zero. We then generate 100,000
random numbers between 0 and 1 and increase <code>a</code> by one
if it falls between 0 and 0.25, <code>b</code> if it falls between
0.25 and 0.5, and so forth. Once the loop completes, we would
expect the values of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>
and <code>d</code> to be approximately 25,000 if
<code>rand()</code> generates truly random numbers, which, as can
be seen above, it does.

<h3>A Brief Overview of the Features of Octave</h3>
Octave was originally written and is still maintained by John W.
Eaton who made the first public release in 1993. Since then many
other people have contributed to it as they found it lacked
features they needed. As it stands, Octave comes with many built-in
functions grouped into related packages.

<p>Matrix manipulation is at the heart of Octave and it includes
all the operators you would expect for matrix arithmetic including
addition, subtraction, multiplication (matrix and component-wise),
division, transposition, etc. It also has a number of functions for
generating common matrices including:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>eye()</code> - the identity matrix;</li>

<li><code>ones()</code> and <code>zeros()</code> - a matrix of all
ones or zeros;</li>

<li><code>hankel()</code> - the famous Hankel matrix; and</li>

<li><code>hilb()</code> and <code>invhilb()</code> - the Hilbert
and inverse Hilbert() matrix.</li>
</ul>

<p>The groups of specialised functions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>input and output;</li>

<li>plotting;</li>

<li>matrix manipulation;</li>

<li>linear algebra;</li>

<li>non-linear equations;</li>

<li>differential equations;</li>

<li>optimisation;</li>

<li>statistics;</li>

<li>financial functions;</li>

<li>sets;</li>

<li>polynomial manipulations;</li>

<li>control theory;</li>

<li>signal processing;</li>

<li>image processing; and</li>

<li>audio processing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these are complete and some only contain a few
functions. Each is added by various people when and as needed. Over
the next couple of months we will look at creating new functions
with Octave as well as writing new functions in C++. The Octave
developers welcome new additions and hopefully by the end of this
series you might be writing and contributing your own Octave
functions.</p>

<h3>Final Words</h3>
Hopefully this article will have demonstrated just how easy it is
to pick up the basics of Octave. For any teachers or lecturers
trying to teach their students matrices and/or linear algebra, why
not introduce Octave into your course as a teaching tool? And for
the lecturers or students of university departments such as maths,
mathematical physics, physics, engineering, computer science, etc. - it's
often difficult to have to come up with new and exciting final year
projects every year. Why not have a student implement some
mathematical functionality that Octave lacks from your own area of
research that might be of interest to others?

<p><strong>Next month:</strong> Writing new Octave functions and
writing Octave scripts that can be executed from the command
line.</p>
