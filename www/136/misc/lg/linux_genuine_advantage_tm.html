Linux Genuine Advantage[tm] is an exciting and mandatory new way
for you to place your computer under the remote control of an untrusted third party!
 
According to an independent study conducted by some scientists, many users of Linux
are running non-Genuine versions of their operating system. This puts them
at the disadvantage of having their computers work normally, without periodically
phoning home unannounced to see if it's OK for their computer to continue functioning.
These users are also missing out on the Advantage of paying ongoing
licensing fees to ensure their computer keeps operating properly.
 
To remedy this, we have created a new program available as a required free
download: Linux Genuine Advantage[tm].

My favorite:

# loop continuously, checking periodically to see if the author of this program got paid.
# if no money has changed hands after 30 days, make the computer less useful as punishment.

 To design the perfect anti-Unix, write an operating system that thinks
 it knows what you're doing better than you do.
 And then adds injury to insult by getting it wrong.

It's sick and twisted -- and for some time has been where I link to from
the "Damn Straight, It's Powered by Linux" logo on the lower-right side
of my Web site's front page.
