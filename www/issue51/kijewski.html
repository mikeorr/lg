<P> The implementation was conducted in Jan III Sobieski Hotel - one of the
biggest, most luxurious and prestigious hotel facilities in Poland. The
hotel offers a wide variety of services, ranging from suite rental,
through restaurants to organisation of conferences. 

<P> The hotel has over 400 rooms and employs up to 600 persons. The office
and administration centre is located in a four-story building. The hotel
owns restaurants, underground car park, business centre, pay-TV,
information desks at the airport, etc. 

<P> Jan III Sobieski is a giant entity which could be compared to a large
factory. It is operated round-the-clock, as guests do not like to be
kept waiting. Since the prices reflect hotel's high standard, the guests
are keen on getting their money's worth. The expectations with regard to
the computer system are, therefore, very high. 

<P> The system has to provide for uninterrupted operation in continuous
traffic. Operating downtimes should be reduced to a minimum, as no time
is available to shut the server down for maintenance. The system should
provide for reliable customer service and ensure that the numerous,
large and critical databases be adequately protected.

<P> The following systems had been in use at Jan III Sobieski Hotel prior to
the network implementation:
<OL>
	<LI> The main hotel system developed by a German company operated on HP
UX and alphanumeric terminals. The system supported room reservations,
inventory settlements and accountancy. Its greatest weakness was the inability
to communicate efficiently with taxation modules, as the system supplier could
not keep up with the rapid changes in Polish legislation. 
	<LI> The office centre was operated in Windows 3.11 and MS Office 4.3
(Word 6.0, Excel 5.0) environment. Since the applications' processing capacity
became insufficient, a decision was made to switch to a 32-bit platform. 
	<LI> Novell NetWare was the file server. 
</OL>

<H1>Why Linux?</H1>

<P> The decision to implement Linux was made in 1998 when communication
problems with the taxation module were aggravated due to frequent
legislative changes. A decision was made to purchase an application
designed by a local provider and offering better support. The hotel
selected HS-Partner and their hotel and restaurant application.

<P> The HS-Partner application (now HS-Partner - Protest) operates on Linux
graphic terminals. The terminal comprises a PC in specialist casing, a
touch-operated LCD display and software: XWindow and specialist
libraries. It is based on QT with a number of adjustments implemented by
HS Partner programmers. 

<P> The actual program operates on a server based on the SQL database -
initially PostrgeSQL, now Adabas-D.

<P> The terminals themselves provide for secure operation in the kitchen and
the bar as they are resistant to temperature, humidity and do not need
to be repaired. It is a very important feature in a hotel and restaurant
environment.

<P> The application was implemented in the first half of 1999. The
management decided to switch to a 32-bit platform. The choice was
restricted to two platforms - Windows NT and Linux. 

<P> <A HREF="mailto:Pawel.Moszumanski@sobieski.com.pl">Pawel Moszumanski</A>, 
a manager of the
IT department and a great Linux enthusiast, played the vital role in the
decision-making process. Being aware of system capabilities as well as
the hotel's operating needs, Moszumanski was able to convince the
management to seriously consider the Linux option. 

<P> At that time, our company had already become known for forcing
StarDivision, the developer of the StarOffice package, to enter the
Polish market. We took an interest in StarOffice after we had
experienced difficulty in promoting our Linux solutions. Still, the
customers never ceased to ask the sacramental question: what about Word
and Excel?

<P> StarOffice was the only Linux package which could match Microsoft
solutions. Its operating standards resembled similar solutions developed
by the Redmond company. The only obstacle was the absence of a Polish
distributor and a Polish language version. 

<P> After laborious efforts (the Polish market has always been disregarded
by American software developers), our company finally became an official
StarDivision dealer and we could offer solutions based on the system.
Thanks to our PKFL activity and the recommendation of HS-Partner, we
were able to establish contact with Jan III Sobieski Hotel. 

<P> The hotel management were faced with a difficult choice - either to
spend a lot of money to develop Windows-based solutions or to acquire a
system whose advantages were recognised only by the professionals
without any marketing support. The main advantage of Linux was its
ability to maintain a uniform system platform, while Windows' strength
laid with its commercial popularity. Still, the numbers were on our
side. The cost of acquiring Windows-based software exceeded the Linux
solution five-fold. 

<P> For a large company like Jan III Sobieski Hotel, the cost of acquiring
software is not as important as overall system development costs. As it
turned out, the total software cost was ZERO!

<H1>Let's reduce TCO</H1>

<P> The cost of owning a computer is higher than the actual purchase cost.
The cost of installing 100 computers with NT Workstations would be: 
100 (computers) x 2 (hours to install the system, network and
applications) equals the monthly pay of a well-paid computer expert. 

<P> Additional costs would have to be incurred with regard to management,
maintenance and support. Jan III Sobieski Hotel is a large facility and
it takes more than a short walk to get from one building to another. A
system requiring less maintenance would be the preferred choice. 

<P> The alternative solutions were the Zero Administration Kit, PC Anywhere
and others. Still, they implied additional costs without a guarantee of
proper operation. 

<P> All those features were already present in the Linux System. A PC could
be transformed into a practically self-operated terminal, a remotely or
centrally controlled workstation. The high reliability of a Unix class
system also guaranteed safe data processing. 

<H1>One Company - One Platform</H1>

<P> The hotel management decided to implement a uniform system platform. A
decision was soon made to introduce the StarOffice package provided that
the HS-Partner system would be successfully implemented. The
implementation was completed in August 1999. The next step was to unify
the system platform. Negotiations were held on involving our company in
the implementation process. Our company had become known for a number of
successful StarOffice implementations based on Linux, for example in
Warsaw's BoatHouse restaurant. 

<P> The hotel management take credit for approaching the subject in the most
reasonable way - by stating the requirements and demanding results. They
did not intervene in technical details and provided the programmers with
the freedom to make the right decisions.

<H1>A present from Sun</H1>

<P> At that time, a fee was charged for commercial StarOffice applications.
Even though it was half the price of the MS Office package, we still had
to import it, pay the customs duty, wait and transfer the money. 
At low margin levels, it was not a very lucrative undertaking - our
company makes money on implementing, rather than selling software
packages. In the late summer of 1999, StarDivision was taken over by Sun
Microsystems and the StarOffice package became available to the public
for free. We no longer had to waste our time dealing with bureaucratic
chores and we were (and still are) the most competent company
implementing the StarOffice package based on Linux. 

<H1>What about the terminals?</H1>

<P> We suggested that Xterminals be used, but the idea was not picked up by
the hotel's IT department. Firstly, the terminals implied additional
costs. The hotel had an adequate PC base and only some of the computers
required upgrading. Secondly, a new server would have to be acquired to
prevent the loss of the system's calculating power on the terminals.
Server capacity was also questioned. 
The capacity of the Intel platform and servers with Linux support seemed
limited and other hardware platforms were not an option. The present
solutions ensure adequate processing capacity.

<P> The management decided to postpone the decision on buying terminals
until the existing stations became inadequate. A number of weaker
computers would still have to be configured as Xterminals. 

<H1>Setting to Work</H1>

<P> The contract was signed in October and it involved training and system
installation. We had to begin by developing a quick system installation
mechanism. 
The company called MandrakeSoft helped by releasing Linux-Mandrake.
This distribution was equipped with the KickStart mechanism which
provided for automatic installation based on previously developed
scripts. Our programmers wrote a set of scripts which installed the
system and the required applications with the developed computer base.
The script would be saved on a floppy disk and run to install the
abridged version of Mandrake, the StarOffice package, configure the
network and printers. 
Another set of scripts was used to automatically generate user
configurations. All those tools enabled us to install the system on
workstations practically overnight. 

<H1>Technical Aspects of the Configuration </H1>

<P> Workstations with the operating system and the StarOffice application
are installed on the local disk. The users' home directories are
installed from the server with the use of NFS. Authorisation control is
conducted with the use of yp. IPXutils is used to communicate with the
Novell server. 

<P> The only problem was NFS. NFS itself is not an optimal solution and is
probably the greatest weakness of Unix systems. The majority of hotel
users frequently browse through directories to find a given file - with
100 logged users, the capacity of the server using nfsd drops below the
allowable level. The Kernel nfsa driver - knfs - was used. At present,
processor load is negligent (the server has two processors) and the
network operates correctly. We did not experience any other
network-related problems. Thanks to remote access, user support became
possible without running from one floor to another. 

<H1>Training</H1>

<P> Training sessions were held in the hotel's training room. Two lecturers
trained two groups each. Courses were taught daily - one group in the
morning, the other in the afternoon. The course comprised 24 class hours
on package operation, basic Internet and e-mail skills, etc. The users
did not have any problems with the presented material despite the sudden
change of the working environment. The training session lasted less than
four weeks. Following the course, we provided the users with two weeks
of start-up support - a job well done by Piotr Duszynski.

<P> Most users are not familiar with the specific nature of the Linux system
and the system itself. They use the window manager interface to open
applications such as StarOffice, accounting applications and, in
justified cases, Netscape. Practically none of the users know how to
administer or configure the system, but such skills are not required. 

<H1>Present Condition</H1>

<P> The hotel currently relies on the above hotel system and the office
centre operates the StarOffice package. The HP UX accountancy system is
also used. The WWW and e-mail server operates on Linux. The Novell
NetWare system is integrated with Linux using IPXutils tools. 
The Windows system is used for pay-TV, which is the only hotel service
that keeps the IT department busy troubleshooting. 
 
<H1>The Story of Success</H1>

<P> The implementation was one of the few stories of success in the Polish
computer industry. I would rather not make any references to major
system failures experienced by large companies, but we tried to steer
clear of the common errors. The hotel management defined the goals and
the programmers developed the right implementation methodology. The IT
department is always short of people during system implementations which
is why we had to resort to outsourcing to a limited extent. Pawel
Moszumanski's managerial skills cannot go unnoticed - he scrupulously
supervised project goals and provided the team with organisational and
technical support. Much of the credit goes to the hotel's staff who
provided us with a friendly and stress-free working atmosphere. We also
received massive support from Arek Podg&oacute;rski, one of the top Linux
administrators and system designers, and Piotr Duszynski, implementation
expert. Lenin's theory that "all depends on the working class" was fully
proven. 

<H1>Other Applications</H1>

<P> A business application should be the key feature of a computer system. A
Unix class system proved to be a reliable platform for such
applications. Business applications should be selected to match the
company's operating profile, but the system's open architecture and
stability should also be taken into account. The costs of maintaining
and developing open applications and systems are half of those incurred
in closed systems. Linux and other Unix class systems, such as SCO and
Solaris, provide the perfect solution. The system selected for office
applications should be well integrated with the business application
system. Linux is the best solution in the Unix system category. It
provides for a single stable platform, uniform administration system and
lower costs. Network size is of minor significance - we have implemented
a similar solution (featuring Xterminals) in 5 workstations at Warsaw's
BoatHouse restaurant. A similar method can be applied in a network of
1000 workstations. Unix was developed for large networks, but Linux is
more flexible and can be used in both small businesses and giant
corporations. If its scaling capacity is exhausted, commercial Unix
systems can always be applied.
