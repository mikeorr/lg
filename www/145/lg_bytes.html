<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3>Xen gets pumped by Oracle and Sun</h3>

<p>At Oracle OpenWorld, new VM management suites based on Xen's
virtualization technology were spun out by the respective CEOs of Oracle
and Sun. Both claimed their tools offered the kind of monitoring,
management, and migration capabilities only available from VMware until
now. Both VM suites are free to download.
</p>

<p>First up was Oracle's Kevin Phillips, VP of Sales, who took the wraps
off Oracle VM (or OVM) at the first Oracle OpenWorld keynote. Larry
Ellison also spoke about OVM in his keynote.
</p>

<p>OVM is based on the Xen hypervisor and includes a Web-browser-based
management console that links to the Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)
product. OVM is free to download, but Oracle was not
clear on whether or not the source code would be available.
</p>

<p>OVM has support for Linux and Windows guest operating systems,
including Oracle Enterprise Linux 4 and 5; RHEL3, RHEL4, and RHEL5;
Windows 2003, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP. The Sun xVM
offering, described below, supports RHEL, SUSE, Windows, and Solaris as
guest operating systems.
</p>

<p>Customers who obtain paid support for Oracle VM receive access to
patches, fixes, and updates via Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) and
24x7 global support. Pricing for enterprise-class support for
Oracle VM system with up to two CPUs is priced at $499 per year per
system and a system with unlimited CPUs priced at $999 per year.
</p>

<p>Beyond the Oracle DB and Application Server, only the following Oracle
Applications are "supported" with Oracle VM at this time:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise 8.4.x and 9.0;
<li>PeopleTools 8.49.07 and above;
<li>Oracle Siebel CRM 8.0;
<li>Oracle's Hyperion 9.3.1
</ul>

<p>For more info, go to: <a href="http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+VM%20and">http://wiki.oracle.com/page/Oracle+VM
</a> and <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/virtualization/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/virtualization/index.html</a>
</p>

<p>Sun also got into the Virtualization act at Oracle OpenWorld with
announcement of its xVM FOSS project at Jonathon Schwartz's keynote 2
days later. He demonstrated two upcoming products at the core
of Sun's virtualization offerings: Sun xVM Ops Center, a unified
management infrastructure; and Sun xVM Server, an enterprise-grade
bare-metal hypervisor. Sun xVM will combine enhancements to Sun's
existing technology portfolio with new offerings that will help
customers to increase efficiency, while simplifying management and
saving money. Additionally, Sun will launch www.openxvm.org, an open
source community for developers building next-generation data center
virtualization and management technologies.
</p>

<p>The end-to-end software consists of Sun xVM Server and Sun xVM Ops
Center. Sun xVM Server is based on the open-source Xen hypervisor, and
is an open, cross-platform, high-efficiency, open-source hypervisor
family of servers capable of hosting Windows, Linux, and Solaris OS
guest instances. For the first time, Windows guests will be able to
benefit from built-in Sun technologies like predictive self-healing 
and the ZFS file system. Sun xVM Ops Center is the management
component -- a scalable management environment for the provisioning of
thousands of physical and virtual machines running across multi-vendor
x64/86 and SPARC systems.
</p>

<p>Also significant is that xVM is released under GPL v3. "We
are going to advance... with the GPL community, and this is an
important part of our strategy..." said Sun VP Rich Green at OpenWorld.
</p>

<p>From "Jonathon's Blog" on 11/14:

<blockquote>"...our xVM hypervisor is a very lightweight kernel that inherits
proven virtualization technologies
(like ZFS, FMA, Dtrace and Crossbow) from the Solaris kernel - while
supporting Linux, Windows and Solaris
as guests - imbuing guest OS's with the properties of the host
hypervisor. </blockquote>

<p>We also announced a variety of partners today, most importantly Red
Hat, who'll offer reciprocity with their hypervisor, like Microsoft."
</p>

<p>From the Sun press release on xVM:
</p>

<blockquote>"Red Hat and Sun are collaborating on virtualization and...
customers seeking a free and open source virtualization platform that
ensures interoperability and avoids proprietary vendor lock in, can look
to Sun and Red Hat solutions. Sun supports Red Hat's Linux Automation
strategy and Red Hat supports Sun's xVM strategy, both of which extend
the reach and value of open source. Red Hat and Sun will ensure
customers mutual certification and customer support across [their]
virtualization offerings. In addition, Sun and Red Hat are committed
to...  libvirt (www.libvirt.org), an open source community project for
cross-platform virtualization management."</blockquote>

<p>Some of the Oracle presenters thought that Sun was a bit insensitive
and had sprung the xVM announcement on Oracle organizers. But a
follow-up discussion with mangers from the Oracle Linux group revealed
that Sun had discussed xVM announcement before Oracle OpenWorld had
begun, and that it was no surprise. Wim Coekaerts of Oracle felt that
the Xen community would get to see both VM offerings and would get to
decide which features should be included in the Xen source tree.
</p>

<p>Sun intends to invest about $2 billion in developing and marketing vXM.
Sun said that its Ops Center, expected in December, has already been
validated on hundreds of system configurations.

<h3>Red Hat EL 5.1 Enables Broad Server Virtualization</h3>

<p>Red Hat has released Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1, with integrated
virtualization. This release provides the industry&rsquo;s broadest
deployment ecosystem, covering standalone systems, virtualized systems,
appliances and Web-scale "cloud" computing environments.
 Fedora 8 was also released at the same time. (See Distros section.)
</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualization includes the ability to perform
live migration, allowing customers to seamlessly move running
applications from one server to another, maximizing resource
utilization in the face of changing business requirements. Red Hat
Enterprise Linux's Advanced Platform includes high-availability
clustering, storage virtualization, and failover software to provide
enhanced levels of application availability, for both physical and
virtual servers. Red Hat worked closely with AMD and Intel to
provide support for the new hardware performance features such as Nested
Page Tables in the new release.
</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux's deployment flexibility uniquely allows
customers to deploy a single platform, virtual or physical, small or
large, throughout their enterprise by providing one platform that
spans the broadest range of x86, x86-64, POWER, Itanium, and mainframe
servers, regardless of size, core count, or capacity. Customers can gain
dramatic operational and cost efficiencies when compared to proprietary
solutions, and fully integrated virtualization is included at no
additional cost, which amplify its benefits. Notably, Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5.1 provides enhanced support for virtualization of Microsoft
Windows guests, providing significant performance improvements for
Windows XP, Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows 2008
beta guests.
</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.1 is immediately available to customers via
Red Hat Network, Red Hat's management and automation platform. Red Hat
Network provides customers a common platform for managing both physical
and virtual servers, eliminating the need for organizations to acquire,
manage and train their staff on new tools to manage virtual servers.
Red Hat Network allows customers to  monitor and manage their
servers throughout the entire lifecycle.
</p>

<p>Red Hat also announced the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.6, the
6th update to its Red Hat 4.x product line. This release
includes: OS package updates and install-time support for new hardware;
availability of updated Extras ISO images with third party package
updates; kernel features including: added getcpu system call on ia64
and added /proc NUMA maps support. Read the release announcement and
release notes for further details. The ISO images of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 4.6 are available to existing RHEL subscribers via Red Hat
Networks.
</p>

<h4>RHEL On Demand on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</h4>

<p>Red Hat announced in November the beta availability of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a Web
service that provides resizeable compute capacity in the cloud. This
collaboration makes all the capabilities of Red Hat Enterprise Linux
available to customers on Amazon's proven network infrastructure and
data centers. 
</p>

<p>The idea is to provides everything needed to develop and host
applications. Amazon provides the hosting infrastructure and
RH provides the OS and support, all on a usage basis.
</p>

<p>This also demos RH's virtual appliance technology and also is a major
foray into the SAAS (Software as a Service) market.  The SAAS model is
appealing to small and new businesses and non-profit organizations, and
could represent a significant revenue opportunity for Red Hat.
</p>

<p>According to the Amazon Web Services home page
(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361">http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=3435361</a>):
</p>

<blockquote>"This collaboration between AWS and Red Hat marries all the
capabilities of both RHEL and EC2. Now developers can pay as they go
for resizeable compute capacity in the cloud while accessing the Red Hat
Network management service, world class technical support, and over
3,000 certified applications."</blockquote>
</p>

<p>RHEL on Amazon EC2 is currently available as a restricted beta but will
go public in December or January. Server use prices are $19/month per
user and $0.21, $0.53, or $0.94 for every compute hour used on Amazon's
EC2 service, depending on compute instance size chosen - small, large,
or extra large - plus bandwidth and storage fees.
</p>

<p>More information about the joint service is available at
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/solutions/cloud/">http://www.redhat.com/solutions/cloud/</a>.

<h3>Distros</h3>

<h4>Community Welcomes Fedora 8</h4>

<p>Fedora 8 enhancements include the expanded ability for users to create
custom spins or appliances, increased security features, a new look and
feel, and numerous technical advances.
</p>

<p>First established in Fedora 7, the ability to create custom spins or
appliances that allow users to create a combination of specific
software to meet individual requirements has been expanded in Fedora 8.
Fedora 8 marks the debut of three new spins: Games, Developer, and
Electronic Lab spins offer prepared customization for users with 
specific interests in gaming, development, and electronics applications,
respectively. The new Fedora spins exemplify the easy customization of
the Fedora Project's newest distribution and demonstrate the freedom,
ability, and desire of the community of developers to remix Fedora in
the ways most useful to them.
</p>

<p>Fedora 8 offers both GNOME- and KDE-based Live CDs and a general-purpose
installable DVD for workstations and servers. It also includes improved
Live USB support, making it possible to install, boot, and run the
entire distribution off of a USB key without touching the computer's
hard disk at all.
</p>

<p>Fedora 8 incorporates a wide array of technical advances. This
distribution becomes the first to enable PulseAudio, a sound server
that acts as a proxy between all of a user's sound applications by
default. With PulseAudio, users can enjoy features such as different
volumes for different applications, hot-plugging support for USB sound
devices, and support for audio over the network. Fedora 8 additionally
includes improved graphical tools for firewall configuration, enhanced
printer management, and an update for Bluetooth integration. Network
Manager, the easy-to-use wireless configuration tool written by Red Hat
and adopted by many prominent Linux distributions, has also been
updated.
</p>

<p>Fedora 8 boasts an entirely new default look and feel on the desktop,
all based on community artwork. The Fedora 8 theme of "infinity"
includes a default background that changes shades, growing brighter or
darker in accordance with time of day.
</p>

<p>For more information on Fedora 8, to download the distribution, or to
join in this community effort, please visit 
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">http://fedoraproject.org/</a>.
</p>

<h4>MEPIS 7</h4>

<p>A GA release of MEPIS 7 is expected by mid-December. 
</p>

<h4>FreeNAS Beta</h4>

<p>The second beta release of FreeNAS 0.686, a FreeBSD-based operating
system providing free Network-Attached Storage (NAS) services is
available for testing. Beta 2 includes support for USB drives
and many bug fixes.
</p>

<p>FreeNAS is available here: <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/freenas/FreeNAS-i386-liveCD-0.686b2.iso">FreeNAS-i386-liveCD-0.686b2.iso</a> .
</p>

<h4>Fourth release candidate for NetBSD 4.0</h4>

<p>NetBSD 4.0 Release Candidate 4 has been updated to handle RAID volumes
larger than 4GB. This RC also has several bug fixes, including a
transition mechanism from Sendmail to Postfix, a security issue in
OpenSSL, a bug in MTRR handling causing a reboot on amd64 when starting
the X server, a security issue in FAST_IPSEC, and a heap corruption in
rpc.lockd.
</p>

<p>The RAID changes use bio(4), and this can cause a compatibility break
on 32-bit platforms. If you are using bio(4), you need a new bioctl
utility for the RC4 kernel. If you have updated only the kernel, either
rebuild bioctl after updating the headers in /usr/include, or use a new
binary from the release build. This does not affect upgrading from
previous releases of NetBSD, as no former release has bio(4).
</p>

<h3>Products</h3>

<h4>Dell to sell Servers with Solaris Installed</h4>

<p>Dell announced that it had formally certified Sun's Solaris on its
servers. By Spring of 2008, Dell will offer its servers pre-installed
with RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise
Server), Solaris and -- this just in -- Ubuntu to customers.
