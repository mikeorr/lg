<h1>Writing Your Own Shell</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/ramankutty.html">Hiran Ramankutty</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> This is not another programming language tutorial. Surprise! A few days
ago, I was trying to explain one of my friends about the implementation of
the 'ls' command, though I had never thought of going beyond the fact that
'ls' simply lists all files and directories.  But my friend happened to
make me think about everything that happens from typing 'ls' to the point
when we see the output of the 'ls' command. As a result, I came up with the
idea of putting the stuff into some piece of code that will work similarly.
Finally, I ended up in trying to write my own shell which allows my program
to run in a way similar to the Linux shell.  </p>

<h3>Shells</h3>
<p>
On system boot up, one can see the login screen. We log in to the system using our 
user name, followed by our password. The login name is looked up in the 
system password file (usually /etc/passwd). If the login name is found, the password is 
verified. The encrypted password for a user can be seen in the file <i>/etc/shadow</i>, 
immediately preceded by the user name and a colon. Once the password is verified,
we are logged into the system.
</p>

<p>
Once we log in, we can see the command shell where we usually enter our commands to 
execute. The <b>shell</b>, as described by Richard Stevens in his book 
<b>Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment</b>, is a command-line interpreter 
that reads user input and execute commands.</p>

<p>
This was the entry point for me. One program (our shell) executing another program 
(what the user types at the prompt). I knew that execve and its family of functions 
could do this, but never thought about its practical use. 
</p>

<h3>A note on execve()</h3>
<p>
Briefly, <b>execve</b> and its family of functions helps to initiate new programs.
The family consists of the functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>execl
<li>execv
<li>execle
<li>execve
<li>execlp
<li>execvp
</ul>

<pre>
int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
</pre>

<p>is the prototype as given in the man page for <i>execve</i>. The <i>filename</i> 
is the complete path of the executable, <i>argv</i> and <i>envp</i> are the  
array of strings containing argument variables and environment variables respectively.

<p>
In fact, the actual system call is sys_execve (for execve function) and other functions
in this family are just C wrapper functions around <i>execve</i>. Now, let us 
write a small program using execve. 
See listing below:
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing1.c.txt">listing1.c</a>

<p>
Compiling and running the a.out for the above program gives the output of <b>/bin/ls</b> 
command. Now try this. Put a printf statement soon after the <i>execve</i> call and 
run the code. 
</p>

<p>
I will not go in to the details of wrappers of execve. There are good books, one 
of which I have already mentioned (from Richard Stevens), which explains the execve family 
in detail.
</p>

<h3>Some basics</h3>

<p> Before we start writing our shell, we shall look at the sequence of
events that occur, from the point when user types something at the shell to
the point when he sees the output of the command that he typed. One would
have never guessed that so much processing happens even for listing of
files.  </p>

<p> When the user hits the 'Enter' key after typing "/bin/ls", the program
which runs the command (the shell) forks a new process. This process
invokes the <b>execve</b> system call for running "/bin/ls". The complete
path, "/bin/ls" is passed as a parameter to <b>execve</b> along with the
command line argument (argv) and environment variables (envp).  The system
call handler <b>sys_execve</b> checks for existence of the file. If the
file exists, then it checks whether it is in the executable file format.
Guess why? If the file is in executable file format, the execution context
of the current process is altered.  Finally, when the system call
<b>sys_execve</b> terminates, "/bin/ls" is executed and the user sees the
directory listing.  Ooh!</p>

<h3>Let's Start</h3>

<p>
Had enough of theories? Let us start with some basic features of the command shell. The listing 
below tries to interpret the 'Enter' key being pressed by the user at the command prompt. 
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing2.c.txt">listing2.c</a>

<p>
This is simple. Something like the mandatory "hello world" program that a programmer writes 
while learning a new programming language. Whenever user hits the 'Enter' key, the 
command shell appears again. On running this code, if user hits Ctrl+D, the program 
terminates. This is similar to your default shell. When you hit Ctrl+D, you will log out of 
the system. 
</p>

<p>
Let us add another feature to interpret a Ctrl+C input also. It can be done simply by registering 
the signal handler for SIGINT. And what should the signal handler do? Let us see the code in listing 3.
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing3.c.txt">listing3.c</a>

<p>
Run the program and hit Ctrl+C. What happens? You will see the command prompt again. Something that
we see when we hit Ctrl+C in the shell that we use.
</p>

<cite>Now try this. Remove the statement <b>fflush(stdout)</b> and run the program. For those 
who cannot predict the output, the hint is <b>fflush</b> forces the execution of underlying write 
function for the standard output.</cite>

<h3>Command Execution</h3>

<p>
Let us expand the features of our shell to execute some basic commands. Primarily we will read 
user inputs, check if such a command exists, and execute it. 
</p>

<p>
I am reading the user inputs using getchar(). Every character read is placed in a temporary 
array. The temporary array will be parsed later to frame the complete command, along with its
command line options. Reading characters should go on until the user hits the 'Enter' key. 
This is shown in listing 4.
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing4.c.txt">listing4.c</a>

<p>
Now we have the string which consists of characters that the user has typed at our command
prompt. Now we have to parse it, to separate the command and the command options. 
To make it more clear, let us assume that the user types the command 
</p>
<pre>
gcc -o hello hello.c
</pre>
<p>
We will then have the command line arguments as 
</p>
<pre>
argv[0] = "gcc"
argv[1] = "-o"
argv[2] = "hello"
argv[3] = "hello.c"
</pre>

<p>
Instead of using argv, we will create our own data structure (array of strings) to store 
command line arguments. The listing below defines the function fill_argv. It takes the user input 
string as a parameter and parses it to fill my_argv data structure. We distinguish the command and 
the command line options with intermediate blank spaces (' '). 
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing5.c.txt">listing5.c</a>

<p> The user input string is scanned one character at a time. Characters
between the blanks are copied into my_argv data structure. I have limited
the number of arguments to 10, an arbitrary decision: we can have more
that 10.  </p>

<p>
Finally we will have the whole user input string in my_argv[0] to my_argv[9]. The command will be 
my_argv[0] and the command options (if any) will be from my_argv[1] to my_argv[k] where k&lt;9. 
What next?
</p>

<p> After parsing, we have to find out if the command exists. Calls to
<i>execve</i> will fail if the command does not exist. Note that the
command passed should be the complete path. The environment variable
<b>PATH</b> stores the different paths where the binaries could be present.
The paths (one or more) are stored in <b>PATH</b> and are separated by a
colon. These paths has to be searched for the command.  </p>

<cite>The search can be avoided by use of execlp or execvp which I am trying to 
purposely avoid. <i>execlp</i> and <i>execvp</i> do this search automatically.</cite>

<p>
The listing below defines a function that checks for the existence of the command. 
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing6.c.txt">listing6.c</a>

<p>
<i>attach_path</i> function in the listing 6 will be called if its parameter <i>cmd</i> 
does not have a '/' character. When the command has a '/', it means that the user is specifying 
a path for the command. So, we have:
</p>

<pre>
if(index(cmd, '/') == NULL) {
	attach_path(cmd);
	.....
}
</pre>

<p>
The function attach_path uses an array of strings, which is initialized with the paths 
defined by the environment variable <b>PATH</b>. This initialization is given in 
the listing below:
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing7.c.txt">listing7.c</a>

<p>
The above listing shows two functions. The function <i>get_path_string</i> takes the 
environment variable as a parameter and reads the value for the entry <b>PATH</b>. For 
example, we have 
</p>

<pre>
PATH=/usr/kerberos/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/home/hiran/bin
</pre>

<p>
The the function uses <i>strstr</i> from the standard library to get the pointer to the beginning of
the complete string. This is used by the function <i>insert_path_str_to_search</i> in listing 7 
to parse different paths and store them in a variable which is used to determine existence of 
paths. There are other, more efficient methods for parsing, but for now I could only think of this. 
</p>

<p>
After the function <i>attach_path</i> determines the command's existence, it invokes 
<i>execve</i> for executing the command. Note that <i>attach_path</i> copies the complete 
path with the command. For example, if the user inputs 'ls', then <i>attach_path</i> modifies 
it to '/bin/ls'. This string is then passed while calling execve along with the command line 
arguments (if any) and the environment variables. The listing below shows this:
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing8.c.txt">listing8.c</a>

<p>
Here, <i>execve</i> is called in the child process, so that the context of the parent process 
is retained.
</p>

<h3>Complete Code and Incompleteness</h3>
<p>
The listing below is the complete code which I have (inefficiently) written. 
</p>

<a href="misc/ramankutty/listing9.c.txt">listing9.c</a>

<p>
Compile and run the code to see <b>[MY_SHELL ]</b>. Try to run some basic commands; it should 
work. This should also support compiling and running small programs. Do not get surprised 
if 'cd' does not work. This and several other commands are built-in with the shell. 
</p>

<cite>You can make this shell the default by editing <i>/etc/passwd</i> or
using the 'chsh' command.  The next time you login, you will see
<b>[MY_SHELL ] </b> instead of your previous default shell.  </cite>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p> The primary idea was to make readers familiar with what Linux does when
it executes a command. The code given here does not support all the
features that <i>bash</i>, <i>csh</i> and <i>ksh</i> do. Support for 'Tab',
'Page Up/Down' as seen in <i>bash</i> (but not in <i>ksh</i>) can be
implemented. Other features like support for shell programming, modifying
environment variables during runtime, etc. are essential. A thorough look
at the source code for <i>bash</i> is not an easy task because of the
various complexities involved, but would help you develop a full featured
command interpreter. Of course, reading the source code is not the complete
answer. I am also trying to find other ways, but lack of time does not
permit me. Have fun and enjoy......  </p>
