<P>
I am writing reguarding the Alcatel Speed Touch USB modem, under Linux,
particularly Mandrake Linux 8.1.
</P>
<P>
I have been trying to get this modem to work for about a month now.  It
seems I almost have it, at least compared to where I was a couple of
weeks ago.  I have been following the HowTo's, I've found on the
internet.  They seem to differ slightly from web page to web page, but I
believe I finally got the kernel and the drivers set up to work, but I
think I might have some setting messed up somewhere, or maybe a module
not loaded or something.  I was hoping you might be able to help me find
where I'm having a problem.  The message I get when I try to connect
with br2684ctl -b -c 0 -a 0.0.35 is something like
</P>

<blockquote><pre>RFC1483/2684 bridge : Created nas0 interface
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(something like that)
</P>

<blockquote><pre>RFC1483/2684 bridge : Connecting to ATM 0.0.35 Encapsulation LLC
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(again it says something like this)
</P>

<blockquote><pre>RFC1483/2684 bridge : fatal : failed to connect on socket
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
(here's the error message I get exactly as given to me)
</P>
<P>
Is there anything you might be able to tell me from the informatoin
given, what I should be looking at to correct my problem?  If you need
anymore info please let me know what it is and I will get it right to
you.
</P>
<P>
Thanks
<br>Tom

<P>
There's a program in <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> unstable called xt (xtraceroute).
It's supposed to plot the traceroute path on a picture of the
earth.  However, it doesn't seem to have enough location
coordinates in its database to do anything.  Has anybody used
this program?  Did you have to enter your own coordinates for
all the hosts you traceroute from and to?

Hi guys,
I don't know how much this will matter to the non-Europeans in the audience,
but how am I going to get the Euro symbol to appear in my favourite
applications? I have just installed <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 7.2 on my laptop, and would like
to indicate my preferred currency symbol in a spreadsheet or word processor
document. The only mention I can find in previous issues of LG (wonderful
publication - keep up the great work!), apart from a <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> Euro-HOWTO, is
the usual "just my .02 Euro". Does anyone have any ideas?
</P>
<P>
Regards,
<br>Donal.

Hi,

<P>
I've read where DHCP can return a fixed IP for specified MAC hardware
addresses.  My question is can DHCP be limited to return either fixed or
dynamic IP to only a list of MAC hardware addresses?  This would be a
security enhancement as only specified machines could get access to the
server?

<P>
Hi Gang!
Some time ago a friend of mine took me to a guy that - via some
strange ways - had gotten hold of some convex computers (2
refrigerator-sized boxes). They were struggeling to get them to boot
again (I think they called the OS spp-ux os something similar) and
maybe in the end getting them to boot linux (hey, not totally OT). So,
short question: does somebody of you know these beasts? If yes, I can
figure out more about'em, otherwise forget them (saw something like a
VAXbar some time ago, maybe that'll be their new purpose real soon

<P>
I am running RedHat 7.2 and using ext3 file system with software raid,
using 2 20gig drives.  The raid drive(s) are my boot drive.  The 2
drives are identical and are used something like this <TT>/dev/hda1</TT> = ext3,
<TT>/dev/hdb1</TT> = ext3.  I made everything between the 2 drives the same.  The
mirrored drive is <TT>/dev/hda1</TT> and <TT>/dev/hda2</TT> = <TT>/dev/md0.</TT>  The system has
been running very well.
</P>
<P>
I recently did a kernel upgrade.  The upgrade went ok and will boot and
run from a floppy drive with no problems.  But if I attempt to boot from
the hard drive(s) drive it will only boot the old kernel.  I have
updated the grub.conf and have even attempted to enter the commands for
booting from the command line.  The grub menu never shows the commands
entered into the grub.conf file and I receive a error "Can't find files"
if I attempt to enter the command line.
</P>
<P>
I have attempted to find what I need to change/fix but have not found
the information needed to update grub while booting from a raid/ext3
file system.
</P>
<P>
Anyone have any ideas?
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
<br>Joseph St.Clair

Hi Gang,
</P>
<P>
I recently upgraded from RedHat 6.2 to 7.2. Since then I have
experienced a number of incidents where the system simply froze up
solid. It would not respond to keyboard input or mouse clicks. Screen
was not being updated at all. The only way out was the Reset button.
This sounds similar to the problems reported by N.P.Strickland
(<A HREF="../issue74/tag/9.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue74/tag/9.html</A>), but I can relate my
incidents to some things which infer that the solutions suggested to
that post will not resolve my situation.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, this has only started happening since I upgraded. I never
experienced anything similar on RH 6.2 (or 5.2 fot that matter). The
hardware is unchanged, so I believe it must be caused by software, not
hardware.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, I am pretty confident that it is related somehow to sound. I
can bring on a freeze by running a number of multimedia programs (e.g.
XMMS, gtv). They appear to work fine for, say, 30 seconds, then Zap! the
system freezes up solid.
</P>
<P>
Can anyone shed any more light?
</P>
<P>
Thanks
<br>Ian Callahan

The only reason I'd be in a cybercafe is if I'm in a strange town and there

<P>
Ben,
</P>
<P>
Since I'm a relative linux newbie and software installation has been
learning process, I appreciatee your article on installing from source.
One question though.  After downloading and uncompressing the source,
installation seems to be pretty much a three step process.
</P>
<Pre>
./configure
make
make install
</Pre>
<P>
My question is this: should I become root in this process and if so at
what stage?  I'm thinking that I should become root after "make." and
not before.
</P>
<P>
Anyway I appreciated the article especially the part about analyzing a
failed install.  It would have taken me a while to figure that out on my
own.
</P>
<P>
Thanks,
<br>Adam York

Do you offer recommendations on the most successful ways to jump
from microsoft to LINUX? Any help that can save me pain would be greatly
appreciated i.e. hardware, linux flavor, good books for the beginner to read
before/during the move to lynux!
</STRONG></P>
<P>
That's a very general question, so I can offer only a general answer.
Look in The Answer Gang Knowledge Base:
<A HREF="../tag/kb.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/tag/kb.html</A>
especially under the sections "Linux Distributions", "Before you install Linux",
"Installing Linux", etc.  Also see the section "Linux tech support questions"
question "How can I get help on Linux?", which has a list of books and a link
to the <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A> (LDP) (Linux Documentation Project), which should be your first stop.

Hi Gang!
Just had some time and took a look into the howto section at
linuxdoc.org and found the Tips-HOWTO.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Nice thingies in there, although the last editing seems to be ages
ago.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Soooo, since LG is already present in there and you have such
wonderful ideas, scripts and perl-thingies (Ben?), after you have
discussed them here in the list and optimized them one could post it
to the maintainer of the Tips-HOWTO for inclusion.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What do you think? Thats a place a newbie finds rather easier than
this mailing-list, don't you think?
Just a suggestion.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
CU Robos
</STRONG></P>
<P>
&lt;grin&gt; Good idea, Robos. Instead of the Tips-HOWTO, however, the areas
you're asking about are a subset of the LG Knowledge Base that
Chris Gianakopoulos and I have been working on for the past month plus;
see &lt;<A HREF="../kb-faq.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/kb-faq.html</A>;. Better yet, wait 
a week or
so and see the new version - Chris has been doing a sterling job of adding
the stuff from the previous issues of LG while I'm banging away on
modifying the overall KB-FAQ, TAG-FAQ, etc. The difference between the last
month and the one that's coming up is going to be a large one - there are
many, many more articles/issues incorporated into it than there were the
last time - and it's really turning into a great resource. -- Ben

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Linux Gazette is slow to adopt new visual technology, kind of like the Amish.
We prefer to wait a few years and see which technologies would actually be a
long-term benefit to all our users.  It's an unusual kind of zine; I don't know
of any others like it.  Most people read it from mirrors in 47 countries,
through the Linux Documentation Project, download the FTP files, read it on a
CD-ROM, download the articles to their palm pilot, etc.
So anything dynamic is out because it would cut off a significant portion of
the readership.  We also don't want to impose any special software requirements
on the mirrors.  Two concessions to dynamism: the search engine and talkbacks
on the main site.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">We're also mindful of bandwidth restraints: many readers and mirrors live in
countries where they pay by the minute for Internet access, so I try to keep
each issue down to less than a megabyte or two (compressed).
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">We also have to piece together the whole thing into an all-in-one version (the
entire issue on one page), because that's how LG started and many readers prefer
to print it that way.  This rules out differing stylesheets per article, or
anything special the article needs in the HTML header.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Most of the editors subscribe to the "good website design" philosophy, meaning
content is king.  If you can't say it in text, it isn't worth saying.  Obviously
we don't go all the way on that, because we have been publishing several cartoon
series.  But still, all decorations are evaluated in terms of how essential they
are to the content.  If readers like the text, they'll be back.  if they won't
read it unless it has bells and whistles all around it, well, we don't want them
anyway.  There are plenty of sites that are highly graphical (and can't be
navigated unless you have Flash and Javascript enabled), and LG doesn't wish to
compete in that department.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">By the way, Your Editor has a strong adversion to "left column" and
"right column" sidebars (tables), and will resist them as long as he can.
Let the article text flow freely across the entire width of the browser,
outside a table, and in the default font.  Persumably, the reader has
adjusted his default font to his preference.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Not to rag too hard back, but:
<ol>
<li> Tell O'Reilly to get that wart zapped.  The last time I saw this
           was LWN having some problems with an ad provider whose "pull
           through" would bomb out that way about 1 time in 10.  I'm not
           sure if they fired the ad provider, or just made 'em fix it,
           but I know it's tricky to chase down problems that are hard to
           reproduce.

(CNRI?) stopped putting developer resources into it.  They did that because
they realized its features and speed were never going to compete with recent
versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">With Grail died the ability to run Python applets in a browser, but that's OK
because there never were any Python applets except a few demos.  But now there's
Jython, which is an implementation of Python in Java, so you can do almost the

Macromedia Flash, Javascript and fancy graphics would be possible since
they are self-contained (i.e., don't require particular software on the
web server).  However, they would have problems on non-major browsers,
and LG readers have a wide variety of browsers, and are more likely
than the general public to run experimental browsers on principle.
Also, some readers have older computers, and buying a new computer would
cost several months' salary.  Last year I got a letter from a reader in
Africa asking if there is an e-mail version of LG (there isn't),
because his school cannot afford to read it on the web.

stopped counting -- and Java is getting there.  People read us worldwide
including on PDAs and in libaries and coffee shops.  (ok, the coffee shops
probably can handle the cool stuff.  We've gotten lots of questions about
coffee shops running Linux.)  Also on "that slow old thing" and a cheap
dialup link while preparing the spiffy new box to run Linux. (Even though

focus in it would put it on topic), and Mike Orr 
(<A HREF="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net"
	>gazette@linuxgazette.net</A>) would be
glad to accept your submission.  If <EM>that</EM> excites you about us, read our
author guidelines in the Linux Gazette FAQ, and we look forward to seeing it!

Ben,

Don't take it so personal - the Editor explained everything very nicely,
I'm sorry if I offended - I am a graphical ponse, it's not my fault I
was born that way!!!!!!!
</STRONG></P>

</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">&lt;grin&gt; No worries, Leon - you didn't offend me. I got a little grumpy at
you telling us how we've got to do something without knowing our
requirements, but that's all; no offense involved.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">For myself, I like graphical stuff when done in appropriate amounts
relevant to the material at hand. Today, there are <EM>way</EM> too many web pages
that use graphics gratuitously, without any sense behind them - and I must
say that the page you pointed to does not fit that category, although it
has other problems (at least from my perspective.)
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">So, here's an idea for you; an opportunity to possibly convert a few folks
into "graphical ponses", if you will. Go with what Mike suggested: write an
article about Web page design; include some links to demonstrate each of
your points. Who knows?... it might become a graphical ponse revolution.

Heather,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
You write too much - I can't even type that fast and you want me to read
all that!????
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As I said I like the content - I'm sold an that - I also said I'm new to
Linux, thus may only be bagging what I don't understand....yet!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
All points on bandwidth, mirroring etc etc are taken - OK!!!!!
</STRONG></P>

I still hate Brussel sprouts with butter - I'd rather eat the tub of
butter.

Geez, I know not now to stir whith what ain't broken....
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Oh and to clarify - I Certainly Don't Work For O'Reilly!! (And I'm not
such a fan of Flash myself - but don't tell my boss!)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am glad to have stimulated some conversation though
</STRONG></P>
<HR width="10%" align="center"><P><STRONG>
Mike,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for an in depth reply : This shows me your commitment to uphold
all that is good and right in the computing world, and your reasons for
doing it.  Good on ya! - I can take much of what you have said about the
web and put it into practice - thanks - all points noted.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am pleased that you did in fact reply - you would be surprised how
many people would take a comment like my and ignore it - so thanks
again.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am what your world would call a Linux Newbie so your feedback and
explanations are essential to my development, and I suspect yours.  I am
looking forward to building new sites, I do have some commercial
Intranets on the build, and in use, none of which I can advertise -
interestingly enough, I am using mySQL, PHP on guess what: <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux
7.2.  They work a dream, and are - FULL of lovely graphics, but tied to
100Mbps LANs, so I can afford the bandwidth!  Call me a cheat!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Oh and thanks for the cauliflower laugh.
</STRONG></P>

I gave it some thought Mike - I dont know if I can match up to the class
of company - I have little Linux experience (love the 'Iron Orr' bit)
When I move jobs next week, (and desktop machines! yay to the end of
W2K) I'll have to set up some Linux servers, with RAID and  big network
transfer speeds for up to 20 Mac OSX clients running video editing
software - Utilising the network drives as a data bank, so clients can
log onto any machine to edit and be presented with up to 10GB of storage
space for the hungry video stuff.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Only 10GB?  What are they editing; news packages?

</P>
<P><STRONG>
After that I'll be in a position to answer some questions on Linux!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(If anyone has some pointers on the above problem please jump in - or
even if it is possible! specially Mac OSX Vs Linux issues.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
'till then Ciao!

The problem is <EM>sustained throughput</EM>.  TTBOMK, <EM>nothing</EM> is fast
enough at the network filer level at the moment to do anything much
faster than DV (3.5MB/s).  To beat that, you need, I think, to go to
NAS, or something similar: shared <EM>drives</EM>, rather than shared
filesystems.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps things have speeded up a bit... but be prepared to go to either
100Mbs Ether with dedicated adapters, or Gigabit shared... and
something more towards token than ether is not out of line.
</P>
<P>
Either that, or nasty buffering on the mount client.
</P>
<P>
Investigate Cinelerra, too.
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
