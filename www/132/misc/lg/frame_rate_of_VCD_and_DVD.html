Dear gang...
</p>

<p>
I face a trouble here. Does anyone know the frame rate of VCD and DVD? 
Also, what is the fps (frame per second) of movie trailers spreading on 
Internet? What is the right way to calculate the fps? 
</p>

<p>
My another problem is, suppose I have a video clip which has 30 fps. 
What should I do if I want to double the fps (i.e 60 fps)? Is there any 
tool available to do this?
</p>

<p>
Any hints would be greatly appreciated... Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>

</p>

Hi there,
</p>

<p>
I think the following link may be of help
</p>

&gt; spreading on Internet? What is the right way to calculate the fps? 
&gt; 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
If what you want to know is the fps of a video you have, you can
use mplayer with the "-identify" option to obtain it (plus much more
other info!)
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; My another problem is, suppose I have a video clip which has 30 fps. 
&gt; What should I do if I want to double the fps (i.e 60 fps)? Is there
&gt; any tool available to do this?

</p>

<p>
I have never tried it, but the -ofps option of mencoder looks
promising ...
</p>


<p>

<p>
Thanks a lot! Hm, so mostly are using 24,25 and 30 fps. I wonder, is 60 
fps a common one for video playback?
</p>


<p>

&gt; &gt; My another problem is, suppose I have a video clip which has 30

</p>

<p>
Thanks. I also tried Virtual Dub, seems it did what I need (increasing 
frame rate).
</p>

<p>
BTW, any of you have ever did a benchmark to find out the number of 
dropped/skipped frame on various hardware/software specification? Mind 
to share the way you do it?

<p>
that depends (what else?)
</p>

<p>
PAL uses 25 frames per second (European format)
NTSC uses either 23.976 or 29.97 frames per sec. (US standard)
</p>

<p>
This is complicated by interlaced/non interlaced material. 
</p>

<p>
TV is usually interleaved, i.e. every this frame contains every odd line,
every other frame every even line of an image. That allows a 50Hz
vertical rate of European TV's while only having 25 full images per
second. If done right, the interleaved frames contain actual information
at 50Hz i.e. you get the infamous stripes if you simplistically glue the
two interleaved frames together. 
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; Also, what is the fps (frame per second) of movie trailers spreading on 
&gt; Internet? What is the right way to calculate the fps? 
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Usually the same as the source material (i.e. PAL or NTSC).
 
</p>

<p>

<p>
None that I'm aware of, you would have to interpolate along the time axis. 
</p>

<p>
Linux tools I'm aware of are dvdrip (perl gui frontend) and transcode
which does all the work (used heavily by dvdrip). The CLI of transcode
is <strong>horrible</strong> so dvdrip is strongly recommended.
</p>

<p>
If a tool can upsample from 30 to 60 fps it might be transcode. 
</p>

<p>
mplayer/mencoder is also versatile player/encoder.

I don't know much about it, but that seems odd. One of the standard
tweaks in camera work, in the old days, used to be overcranking and
undercranking; ditto for playing the film. I'd have expected that
digitizing would make all of that seamless as well as extending the
range.
</p>

<p>
Looking at 'man mplayer', it seems like they've got several switches that are
applicable:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
  -fps &lt;float value&gt;
		 Override video framerate.  Useful if the original value is
			wrong or missing.
  -ofps &lt;fps&gt;
		 Specify a frames per second (fps) value for the output file,
			which can be different from that of the source ma?  terial.
			Must be set for variable fps (ASF, some MOV) and progressive
			(30000/1001 fps telecined MPEG) files.
  io=&lt;ifps&gt;:&lt;ofps&gt;
	   For each ifps input frames the filter will output ofps frames.
	   The ratio of ifps/ofps should match the -fps/-ofps ratio.  This
	   could be used to filter movies that are broadcast on TV at a
	   frame rate different from their original framerate.

Oh, <strong>brother</strong>... no kidding. The last time I used 'transcode', I gave up
trying to construct the command line on my own and just googled for
someone else who had used it for the same thing. Mind you, it worked
great - but a camel would die of dehydration if it had to traverse the
length of that statement. I've taken months to write programs that were
shorter.

That guy I shave has relevant documentation -- except you shouldn't
trust him.  (He's Scandinavian, and Tante Bjorg always warns me not
to trust those folk.  Also, Epimenides said they're worse than Cretans, 
just before he went off to help Bertrand Russell find the set of all
sets that don't contain themselves.)

What I meant was resampling <strong>without</strong> changing the speed -- i.e. if
dvdrip changes from NTSC 29.97 Hz to 25Hz for a PAL TV set it recodes so
the movie isn't slower. At least thats what I thought that particular
filter in dvdrip, inverse something, was meant for, which supposedly can
handle that without loosing audio sync. 
</p>

<p>
If speed change is what you want of course, just go ahead and let
mplayer play it faster. 
</p>

<p>
And BTW -- 60fps for action games might be appropriate but 60Hz movies
are not typical. 30Hz (or almost) are typical for NTSC on the other
hand, usually interleaved to 60 half frames.

Ah, now I see what you mean. I'm probably showing my ignorance here, but
- if you separated the audio and the video tracks, then ran the video at
a faster (29.97/25) rate, wouldn't that do the job? I'm probably opening
a large can of worms, but... I like fishing, anyway. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I guess something like that happens during the recode for PAL VCD. I had
trouble from time to time that tcmerge (?) refused to integrate the
audio and the VCD videostream or failed to synchronize for no (to me)
apparent reason. 
</p>

<p>
But without a TV I myself watch everything on a monitor attached to a PC
anyway -- and mplayer doesn't care if its PAL or NTSC or 23.xx 25 or
29.xx fps.

<p>
No, not speeding up. What I meant is like extrapolating (?) the existing 
frames. So, for example, currently a video clip has 30 fps and I need 
to convert it to 60 fps. I need the software to do something like:  
doubling the number of frames, creating in between frames, or anything 
else required to achieve 60 fps but NOT increasing the speed. 
</p>

<p>
Also, what I want to ask, when doing this kind of upsampling, what 
should I do to keep the audio video sync'ed? Or the tool like transcode 
will automatically do it for me? So far, I only test with virtual dub 
for Windows and seems like it works fine.... but I welcome more ideas.

if virtual dub does what you want -- stick with it. I use it
occasionally to create movies from photos which are supposed to run on
AnyWindows(tm) for presentations (LaTeX/beamer/acrobat for me). 
</p>

<p>
If you look for a linux only solution transcode can most probably handle
it, it's just that the command line might be really ugly. You would
strip vidoe and audio stream out of the original. Recode the video which
shoul carry some time code. Then you would reinterlace audio and video
data in a single stream hopefully keeping everything in sync (that would
be tcmerge). 
</p>

<p>
My I ask what you need 60fps for? Is that the US TV vertical refresh
rate? But that would be interlaced I guess, so what you would look for
is an interlaced stream with half frames. Hm... transcode can handle
de-interlacing with about 15 filters, but not interlacing it seems. 
</p>

<p>
On the other hand: From my experience dvdrip/transcode produce VCD
output which has a internal 25Hz framerate (PAL). The interlacing and
doubling of the apparent framerate is handled by the VCD-player to bring
it on the TV screen.

As far as I know, using Xine and mplayer "information" menu, i confirmed 
that the converted video clip has indeed 60 fps. It is AVI, and the 
size becomes approximately 50 times bigger ( ~500 MB) than the original 
MPEG's size. I don't know why, is it normal to see this big AVI?

Thank you for pointing me out. I shall take a note about it and do 
further research. Once I read a bit about transcode, that when I want 
to create a screen capture movie of my X display ... but never really 
use it.

Actually it is for personal experiment, and the result/conclusion will 
be presented for my upcoming article. Generally, I observe the effects 
of changing kernel HZ (system clock resolution) towards the desktop 
programs such as video playback, games, office suite etc.
</p>

<p>
High frame rate video clip captured my attention since I think it 
certainly need higher precision timing in order to display the frames 
at the right moment as correctly as possible. So far, my simple test 
proved that high HZ helps in this case, but  surprisingly HZ=1000 isn't 
always the best choice.

&gt; On the other hand: From my experience dvdrip/transcode produce VCD
&gt; output which has a internal 25Hz framerate (PAL). The interlacing and
&gt; doubling of the apparent framerate is handled by the VCD-player to
&gt; bring it on the TV screen.

Hmm .. again this is a new information for me. I shall keep it for my 
future reference.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for all the answers so far, it is really helpful. I don't know 
how to progress without the your and everyone else's help.

&gt; No, not speeding up. What I meant is like extrapolating (?) the existing 
&gt; frames. So, for example, currently a video clip has 30 fps and I need 
&gt; to convert it to 60 fps. I need the software to do something like:  
&gt; doubling the number of frames, creating in between frames, or anything 
&gt; else required to achieve 60 fps but NOT increasing the speed.

I'll have a close look -- but my 'need' is an old M$ codec (Indeo 3.2)
which runs Win95 to XP as far as I know[1]. And not just in Mediaplayer
but from the "multimedia stack" -- whatever that is. It <strong>means</strong> however
that acrobat/win can run movies inside its main window in full-screen
presentations.

[1] Only Win2k/XP which is installed by our computing center
do not run that -- but they don't run anything. I think they just
skipped thw whole multimedia stuff.

Judging by contents in lavcodec dir in avidemux source tree, Indeo 3 is supported
(indeo3.c is a clue, I guess ;).
You'll have to test it yourself, though.

Ah-- that is encouraging as the website only listed rather major free
and /or well enough documented codecs (mpeg4, divx, VCD, DVD foramt,..)
which have a *nix library implementation.

Nah... they don't really have a status page, but the changelog
(<a href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/changelog.html">http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/changelog.html</a>) is the next best thing.
MPlayer's status page (<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html">http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/codecs-status.html</a>)
lists codecs supported by ffmpeg (among others) if you really want a
"proper" status page.
