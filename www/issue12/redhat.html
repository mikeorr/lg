<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>The Adventure of Upgrading to Redhat 4.0</H1>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>(with advice for others)</H1>

<center><H4>By Randy Appleton, <A HREF="mailto:randy@EUCLID.ACS.nmu.edu">

<P> <HR> <P> 

<P>Here at <A HREF="http://www.nmu.edu">Northern Michigan University,</A>
we run a Linux lab with 14 workstations. Upgrading from Redhat 3.0 to Redhat
4.0 has been quite an adventure. This article describes the upgrading of
one workstation.</P>

<H1>Time</H1>

<P>The first thing to do when upgrading is to free up a significant block
of time. We used a day and a night to upgrade one machine. That included
downloading the software, making floppy disks, and fixing our errors along
the way. In fact, if you're a busy person, and Redhat 3.0 is working fine
for you, then you might choose to delay the upgrade, or even avoid it.
However, at the <A HREF="http://euclid.nmu.edu">Linux Lab at Northern Michigan</A>,
we try and stay near the cutting edge, so the upgrade was a must for us.</P>

<H1>Method</H1>

<P>The next step is to decide your upgrade method. The choices are the
same ones from Redhat 3.0:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Upgrade from an NFS mounted directory of files.</LI>

<LI>Upgrade from a CD-ROM disk.</LI>

<LI>Upgrade from a spare partition containing the needed files.</LI>

<LI>Upgrade directly from an FTP site.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The quickest and easiest way is to use the CD-ROM drive. This is the
only way if you don't have a direct Internet connection, since you cannot
download the necessary amount of data through a modem in any reasonable
amount of time Since our workstations don't have CD-ROM drives, and do
have an excellent Internet connection, we chose to do an FTP install.</P>

<H1>Download Boot Disks</H1>

<P>Before an FTP&nbsp;install can begin, two disks named <A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/current/i386/images/boot.img">boot.img</A>
and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/current/i386/images/supp.img">supp.img</A>
must be downloaded from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/current/i386/images/">ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/current/i386/images/</A>
. They can be written to the floppy disks with the commands</P>

<PRE>dd if=boot.img of=/dev/fd0 <B>(switch disks)
</B>dd if=supp.img of=/dev/fd0</PRE>

<P>The second disk is only needed for an FTP install. Redhat 3.0 required
three disks for all install types, so this change makes a significant savings
in user effort. However, we had used the Redhat 3.0 disks as emergency
boot disks to correct problems like forgetting the root password (yes,
this does happen). The Redhat 4.0 boot disks are missing several important
utilities (i.e. tar and vi) so cannot be used for this purpose. </P>

<P>Also, notice that these two disks work for any supported hardware configuration.
The older Redhat 3.0 required that the user search through a list of boot
disks for the correct choice based on his hardware. This search often took
more time than the download itself. Redhat 4.0 is much improved in this
regard (our favorite new feature).</P>

<H1>Bootup and Hardware Configuration</H1>

<P>The first thing you'll see after inserting the boot.img disk and rebooting
the computer is a LILO prompt. Just the words:</P>

<PRE>boot:</PRE>

<P>We would have liked more explanation of our choices here. Redhat 3.0
offered a very nice menu of help text that explained the possible parameters
and their effects. However, if you just wait in a perplexed fashion long
enough, the system will become impatient and boot Linux for you.</P>

<P>The first difference you'll notice is that Redhat 4.0 prompts you to
describe your hardware. It asks about SCSI controllers and network adapters,
showing you a list of possible choices. Behind the scenes the Redhat 4.0
install script loads kernel modules to access your hardware. </P>

<P>While this is happening is a good time to switch to virtual console
#3 (press &lt;ALT&gt;F3). This console shows what's happening in more technical
detail, describing things like the mounting and unmounting of file systems,
and the downloading of files. The older Redhat 3.0 did not have this feature,
which we often use to debug problems. You can switch back to the main action
by pressing &lt;ALT&gt;F1.</P>

<P>The install scripts also query the user for network information. You
should know your IP number, netmask, gateway, hostname, domain name, and
name server before starting the install. We notice that Redhat 4.0 creates
a default gateway and name server entry based upon your IP number and netmask,
but that these defaults are rarely right. Better in our opinion would be
to have no default at all than a misleading one.</P>

<H1>Choosing your Software</H1>

<P>Redhat 4.0 will show you a menu of possible software upgrades and additions.
This list is essentially the same as Redhat 3.0, except that most packages
have increased in version number.</P>

<P>The biggest problem we had involved the remote login software (rlogin,
in.rlogind, in.rshd and in.telnetd). These have been upgraded to use the
P.A.M. library and kerberos. However, we often login into our Linux workstations
from older Sun Sparcs that do not run this software suite. For some unexplained
reason, the SunOS clients could not access the Linux servers. We solved
the problem by simply re-installing the older software. </P>

<P>In general, we suggest letting Redhat upgrade everything you might ever
use. You should avoid downloading any software you are sure you will not
need. Avoiding unneeded software will decreases the total time needed and
the probability of network errors during the download.</P>

<H1>The Long Long Download</H1>

<P>Step one of the download process is to pick an FTP site. There are many
listed <A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/MIRRORS.html">here</A>. We started
by choosing a site with a fast 'ping time' from us, since ping time is
a reasonable approximation of FTP&nbsp;throughput and is quite quick to
gather. To find out the ping tome to a site like www.redhat.com, just type:</P>

<PRE>ping www.redhat.com</PRE>

<P>After ping runs for several packets, kill it with &lt;CNTL&gt;C. The
average ping time will be shown at the bottom. We saw ping times from 80
- 300 milliseconds. Downloads are four times faster from the best site
compared to the worst. It is well worth your time to explore sing ping
before picking a site at random. The fastest was the aptly named 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.real-time.com/pub/redhat">
ftp://ftp.real-time.com/pub/redhat</A>
. Unfortunately, they were not accepting FTP&nbsp;connections, so we used
<A HREF="ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/distributions/redhat">
ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/distributions/redhat</A>.
We could FTP to that site, but the download failed. It seems that the
download scripts also want to know the version and architecture of the packages
you are trying to download. Therefore, the correct URL&nbsp;is 
<A HREF="ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/distributions/redhat/current">
ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/systems/linux/distributions/redhat/current/i386.</A>
That was not obvious from the directions. We suggest that the Redhat folks
either change their script to add these subdirectories or make their directions
more clear.</P>

<P>For us, upgrading required downloading over 300 megabytes. I must say
the status screen during the download is quite nice. The biggest problem
with it is that it does not show the progress of downloading each package.
Since the download was so long, we left it running overnight. Unfortunately,
it failed on the download of <B>LILO.</B> The download script then waited
for us to press a key acknowledging the error, which meant it stopped downloading
some time during the night. Better would be to continue downloading while
informing the user of this error.</P>

<P>Once the download is finished, and you answer a few simple questions,
you get to reboot your computer into Redhat 4.0 (yea!!). </P>

<H1>The Upgraded System</H1>

<P>The first thing we noticed is that the kernel has been upgraded to Linux
2.0.19. Some problems we had before, like our tape drive not working, were
fixed with this upgrade. Also, our Adaptec 2740 SCSI controller was accessible
for the first time. Java support is included in the upgraded kernel.</P>

<P>We discovered the auto-mounter daemon (amd) was running, and had created
a directory named <B>/proc. </B>Inside <B>/proc</B> is every computer mountable
by your workstation. For example, <B>/proc/foo</B> is the root directory
of the host foo, assuming foo will allow outside access. Nice feature!!</P>

<P>The <B>ps</B> command has been changed. Formerly, we used '<B>ps -augx</B>'
to see all processes on our system. That command will no longer work. The
new equivalent is '<B>ps -ax</B>'.</P>

<P>The <B>passwd</B> command has been changed. In fact, my former password
is now considered ill advised, and I've had to pick a new password.</P>

<P>The window manager <B>fvwm95</B> has been included in the upgraded Redhat.
Surprisingly, <B>workman</B>, the musical CD player, was not. See <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/pkglist/rh40_i386/all-packages.html">http://www.redhat.com/linux-info/pkglist/rh40_i386/all-packages.html</A>
for the complete list.</P>

<P>Happily, the Redhat 4.0 upgrade left much of our custom configuration
intact. For example, we run a custom X server that Redhat left in place,
and our NFS mounts as described in <B>/etc/fstab</B> were retained, even
though the upgrade did change <B>/etc/fstab</B> to add other entries (like
the <B>/net </B>file system). We did have to re-edit <B>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</B>
to set our NIS domain.</P>

<H1>The Errata and Other Upgrades</H1>

<P>The errata can be found at <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl/rh40-errata-general.html">http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl/rh40-errata-general.html</A>
. It is actually quite long. Basically, the errata is a list of package
upgrades to Redhat 4.0, along with a description of applicability. We counted
up to 40 packages to download and install, depending on your configuration.
That just too many!! Why does not Redhat make these improved packages a
part of the latest redhat release, possibly called Redhat 4.0.1?</P>

<P>Luckily, the process is quite mechanical, and requires little thought.
Just download the needed files, and run <B>rpm -U </B>on them.</P>

<P>Netscape has upgraded since we did our original install. Unfortunately,
Redhat does not include Netscape, so Netscape must be updated separately.
Perhaps there are legal reasons Redhat does not include Netscape, but Redhat
does include other non-free software, such as <B>xv</B>.</P>

<P>During the upgrade, the install scripts creates backup copies of certain
files in <B>/etc/rc.d/rc*.d</B> with the extension &quot;.rpmsave&quot;.
Once everything is set up correctly, you can delete any files in <B>/etc/rc.d/rc*.d/*.rpmsave</B>.</P>

<H1>The Finished Product</H1>

<P>Overall, the Redhat package is well done. The installation is easier
for Redhat than any other Unix we know of. Redhat 4.0 is a collection of
small upgrades of many packages from Redhat 3.0. There are only a few new
packages (i.e.: <B>fvwm95</B>, <B>TheNextLevel)</B>. Overall, our system
is much as it was before, but with many small improvements. Unless you
have some need to upgrade, or just feel like messing around with your system,
we suggest the results may not be worth the effort. Even so, we like Redhat
4.0 very much.</P>
