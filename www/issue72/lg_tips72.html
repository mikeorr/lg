<!-- ::
EZ Email Security With Stunnel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:: -->
<P>
This is a little crash course in how to setup email over SSL painlessly
using Stunnel. With Stunnel you can keep your email passwords from being
sent as plain text and possibly intercepted by others. Stunnel is a program
that you can use to encrypt TCP connections in SSL. First you need to have
installed a mail transfer agent such as Exim, Sendmail, or Qmail to handle
the SMTP portion of the mail. Then you need to have installed either an IMAP
server or a POP3 server such as the Cyrus package or Cuci-pop.  Many
distributions come with Stunnel, if yours does not you can get it from
<A HREF="http://www.stunnel.org"
	>http://www.stunnel.org</A>.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining and installing Stunnel you need to make a SSL certificate
for use with Stunnel. A SSL certificate is a kind of unique "key" that is
used to encrypt the data. OpenSSL provides a makefile to do just that. In my
distribution it is located in <TT>/usr/share/ssl/certs</TT> . CD to that directory
and type make stunnel.pem to create the certificate that is named
stunnel.pem. Now you need to a few lines to your rc.local file to start
Stunnel at bootup (assuming you ever reboot that is) these lines are:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>  /usr/sbin/stunnel -d 995 -r 110
  /usr/sbin/stunnel -d 465 -r 25
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
This will start stunnel listening on port 995 for POP3 and 465 for SMTP. Now
all you need to do is edit the options for your mail client and there you
go. No need to worry about cleartext email passwords. If you are too
impatient to wait for the next reboot you can type the commands given
previously to start Stunnel right away.
</P>
<P>
There may be some problems with certificate validation for some email
clients. Make sure when asked by the makefile you get the server name
correct. If your email client will not let you add certificates you may need
to change clients or obtain a certificate from a certification authority. If
you cannot get the certificate vaidation worked out there is no way to
ensure that you are connecting to the correct machine.  Have a nice day.
</P>

<P>
Hi, I have gone thru your entire library since the begining but I could
find an answer to the following questions.
First after some time I have been able to setup a small network, one
server and 2 linux boxes and a windows box.
Using samba, the "clients can see the share". All the clients can read
and write to this share.
I have created a share with one of the user's names and add the others to
this in the smb.conf file.
I have change the owner and group for the share to be "today--name of the
group--and add all the users to this group.
The problem is the user A creates a file in the share, saves and closes,
then user B opens the file, edits and can't save unless it saves with
another name.
</P>
<P>
I have used all the combinations for the users, even using the "SETUID,
SETGUI" but nothing works.
</P>
<P>
At server level I can see that the main directory, sub directories and
files, with the format
.rwxwrxwrx  root (or user A) today etc.etc
</P>
<P>
User B, C, D are under the smb.conf share [A] and under group.conf
A::500:B,C,D or
A:x:500:B,C.D
</P>
<P>
If B creates a file all the rights are changed to B, ditto for A,C or D.
I can't even change the ownership from B to A, C, or D.
</P>
<P>
I've spent hours and hours of reading and searching on the web but still
can't find an answer?
</P>
<P>
is there one?
</P>
<P>
please let me know.
</P>
<P>
thanks
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike Martin] 
One or two things to check
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Do the permissions on the share when accessed through samba and directly
eg: share a on mount <TT>/mnt/a</TT>
Do you get the same output from ls -l (You may want them to differ, but
as a troubleshooting technique it may be an idea)
So you could check by accessing the share from your linux box , do an:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>ls -l
</font></code></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
and if you get:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>rwxr_xrwx
</font></code></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...then there is your problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
You might check if the users are all of the same group in <TT>/etc/passwd;</TT>
when you create new files, the <EM>files</EM> can only be in one group, and that's
where it generally comes from.

<P><STRONG>
Hi!
I have got a requirement of defining a share,where one user should have
reader rights &amp; other should be having write rights.The definition is as
below
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>comment = Testing Permissions
path = /usr/local/support
valid users = ibm, god
read list = ibm
write list = god
read only = No
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
when i define this the user=GOD gets permissions properly i.e=write
But the user=IBM also gets write permissions instead of read.
I have relaxed the permissions on unix by giving 0777 to the path
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
i.e drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 4096 Oct 9 11:53 support
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This happens to every share which i create &amp; my smb.conf file is tested
from the diagnosis.txt
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there any thing which I am missing
Please revert to me asap
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks in advance
Franco.F
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Sorry about the delay in answering, but I've been pretty busy ...
</P>
<P>
There are several parameters which affect this.  Usually I just try
juggling them until I get what I'm looking for.
</P>
<P>
One such parameter is
</P>

<blockquote><pre>[global]
   security = user
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
I put this in the global section.
</P>
<P>
Then for a user's smb share, I have found the following to usually limit
access.  The dir is made read only be default, and overridden by the
"write list" parameter:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>[joeBlow]
   comment = Joes smb share directory
   path = /usr/smbShares/jblow
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   create mode = 0770
   valid users = jblow
   write list = jblow
   public = no
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Hope this helps.
</P>

Assuming that not many of the user's have had

be routine enough to:

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
1. Backup (tar/gz??) files in "<TT>/var/spool/mail/*</TT>" and
dump them to a tape drive.

2. Or you move it to a separate drive that won't be
affected by this installation.

3. Seeing as you have a lot of users, is the $USER's
mailbox on a separate partition??? You see, if you
upgrade you can intruct Linux not to touch that
particular partition.

Hi there,
</P>
<P>
I'm running Linux 2.2.4-2 kernel Redhat Version 7.1
</P>
<P>
on a Celeron 500MHz Intel Chipset MB with 64 MB RAM.
</P>
<P>
Even after a fresh installation Gnome seems to crash
</P>
<P>
(I mean to say Gnome comes up but without Sawfish the
Window mamnager running and with an error message
saying urnot running a <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> compilant window manager)
with no options to close any windows running well it
looks like its got one single window for every icon on
the desktop and out of the 4 desktops only one can be
used ..... usually I worked around this problem by
running Sawfish manager from the RUN option, now even
that doesn't seem to start this Sawfish Can u please
help me out with this
</P>
<P>
waitin for ur reply
</P>
<P>
Joyer
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike Martin] 
Try this
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When gnome loads up type gnomecc as a command (either in a terminal or
as a command) then go to window manager section, change to other wm
click ok then change back to sawfish - should work

If it's a source module (*.c), you'll have to compile it according to its
README.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In <TT>/etc/modules.conf</TT>, you may want an "alias eth0 MODULE" line and/or a
"options MODULE io=0x330 irq=0xA" line or something like that, depending
on the module.  But <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> has a front end, <TT>/etc/modutils/aliases</TT>, where
you put your customizations, then run 'update-modules' to calculate and

Also see "man 5 modules.conf".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your network setup script then has to load the module, unless the kernel
is loading it automatically on demand, or unless <TT>/etc/modules</TT> takes care
of it.  "modprobe MODULE", or "modprobe eth0" if you've set up the alias.

Yes, it is possible to use a Linux box as router. You would need some
hardware (486 would probably do), &gt;= 1 network card(s) (ethernet probably).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For starters look at:
	<a href="../faq/kb.html">http://linuxgazette.net/faq/kb.html</a>
and search for "routers"

<FONT COLOR="navy">2-cent Tip: "De-enhancing" enhanced text</FONT></H3>
Fri, 26 Oct 2001 18:37:06 +0000
<BR>Ben Okopnik (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2072%5D%202c%20Tips%20%2311">fuzzybear from pocketmail.com</a>)
<BR>The Answer Gang (tag@lists.linuxgazette.net)

<P>
One of life's little problems that comes up once in a while is dealing with
enhanced text. You know, that stuff you get when you try to dump a man page
as text, or just in reading a file that somebody has "enhanced" - a few
minutes ago, I got an e-mail from someone using an NT box (!) that had the
stuff in it.  If you still don't know what I'm talking about, here's a
sample from the "thttpd" man page:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
N^HNA^HAM^HME^HE
       thttpd - tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server

S^HSY^HYN^HNO^HOP^HPS^HSI^HIS^HS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
So, how do we turn this mess into readable text? If you're using the "vi"
editor, it's a fairly simple task:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>:.,%s/.^H//g
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Note that to enter the actual "Control-H" sequence rather than a caret
followed by an "H" (which will not work), the key sequence is "Ctrl-v"
("Enter raw character") followed by a "Ctrl-h".
</P>
<P>
The above says
</P>

<blockquote><pre>:	Enter command mode
.,%	Apply to every line from the current one to the end of the file
s/.^H	Grab all "Control-H"s and the character that precedes them...
//g	...and delete no matter how many times they occur on a line.
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
In case you've been wondering, the above text "translates" into this:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME
       thttpd - tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server

SYNOPSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Deleting the preceding rather than the following character makes this trick
work with "enhanced-underlined" text (not shown here) as well as
"enhanced-bold".
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">I always call that "nroff format".
 -- Mike</font></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Dan Wilder] 
Actually it's impact printer format.  Works nicely for 9-pin
printers, as it did for daisywheel and type ball printers, or
for that matter, for chain printers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The use of character-backspace-character to produce bold
originated with the impact printer, and was used long before
nroff was written.  Nroff merely made use of what was already common
existing practice.  Calling it "nroff format" would be a little
like calling the rising sun "rooster-crow format".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"col -b" is an easy way to filter out the backspaces and duplicate
characters.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Interestingly enough, it's not really nroff format... (discussion
between Mike and Ben about output formats versus input formats, and
other truly odd things that can be done inside man pages, trimmed
for clarity.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
- "nroff" has its own weird way of doing things:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
The \fIlwp-download\fR program will download the document specified...
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What this stuff is is a hold-over from the Elder Days, when mighty heroes
wrestled giants and monitors were fancy things that only the richest of the
rich could afford; the rest of us scrounged wide-carriage printers and
bought greenbar by the metric assload (nobody was offering discounts on the
Imperial assloads (arseloads?)). "Control-H" is a backspace; in order to
print in bold, you printed a character, backed up over it, then printed it
again.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
H^HHE^HEL^HLL^HLO^HO!^H!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Underlining was done by much the same method, except that instead of
double-printing the character, you printed an underscore, backed up over it,
and printed the character:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
_^HG_^Ho_^H_o^Hd_^Hb_^Hy_^He
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
(You could do it in reverse, too, but this has become the standard format.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Underscore/bold combos were, of course, a horror to behold. As you can
imagine, all sorts of utilities to automate this were widely available.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
_^HG^HG_^Ho^Ho_^Ho^Ho_^Hd^Hd _^HG^HG_^Hr^Hr_^Hi^Hi_^He^He_^Hf^Hf!^H!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Until I started using Linux, I had not realized that someone had kept the
creature alive - which, in Unixland, it very much is. Most text utils -
including "more", "less", and "*cat*", fer Gossake - support it. Midnight
Commander even displays the stuff in nicely distinct reds and yellows.

<FONT COLOR="navy">2 Euro-Cent tip: Sophisticated excluding backup</FONT></H3>
Sun, 28 Oct 2001 21:44:37 +0100
<BR>Matthias Posseldt (<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2072%5D%202c%20Tips%20%2312">matthi from gmx.li</a>)

<P>
Hi all @ Linuxgazette,
</P>
<P>
I just wrote a small backup script (mpbackup), which has the option to
exclude files from the backup, and those files are read from
=2Eexclude_from_backup files in each subdirectory.
So you create a file <TT>/home/matthias/.exclude_from_backup</TT> and write
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>tmp
<br>build
<br>kde-cvs
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
in it. The script will read all .exclude_from_backup files in the
directories to backup and create a list of it.
It then creates a tar.bz2 file.
</P>
<P>
You can even write wildcards into the exclude files. All files mentioned
are relative to the .exclude_from_backup file's directory.
</P>
<P>
You need the included evaluate_file.sh in PATH (or have to edit the
script).
</P>
<P>
Hope that it helps someone. My 500+ megs home directory is now backed up
in about 100 megs, because I left out build trees and cvs trees. And every
user can configure which files go into the backup.
</P>
<P>
Ciao, Matthias

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hello,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a good shell script. I rememeber I wrote a
bash script called "keyfiles" when I was at school,
that ran on your proxy servers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(also activated via my "loop4mail" bash shell-script
daemon.....I think I might include it sometime in
LWM).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What would happen was that a file "<TT>/etc/keyfiles.conf</TT>"
would contain a list of files (with their respective
paths).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then tar would read the file line by line, add the
files to the archive, and dump the archive to a backup
partition.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is more or less what your script does.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
All in all well done!!!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
&lt;laugh&gt; Great minds think alike, Matthias. I wrote a backup script -
slightly different idea from yours, though - and have been evaluating it
for the past couple of months (a backup script is one of those things you
want to beat to death under various conditions; think of where it leaves
you if it fails silently...)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The idea behind mine is that there are a lot of files that you need to
transport between your desktop and your laptop if you travel a lot (as I
do) - things like your bookmark files, document directories, etc. This
script has two config files, both of them accessible from the script
itself: a permanent backup list, where you put the files and directories
that are to be backed up every time, and a temporary list of files that
will only be added to the current backup. It then restores the backed-up
files onto the target machine, saving the previous versions in a .tgz file
in case something has gone screwy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've had no problems with this thing for quite a while now - it has a fair
number of tests built in - and, heck, since you're putting yours up, I
might as well add mine to the list.

Hi Answer Gang
</P>
<P>
I was just reading the 'August 2001 - Nr.69' Issue. In your 2 Cent Tip's
there was a Question called
' <A HREF="<TT>../issue69/lg_tips69.html#tips/11"
	>Cannot Format Network Drive</A> </TT>'.
</P>
<P>
If i understood it right (english isn't my mother language) the person
wanted to wipe off every Partition and bevome a new clean and crispy
Harddisk?
</P>
<P>
Well, in this case i have another little Tip for him (or others with the
same problem).
</P>
<P>
I sometimes have the same or similar Problem, especially when the System
hosts Linux and Win200 or WinME. In this cases i use a Bootstrap Killer
Programm called zap wich comes from IBM.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately it's only avaiable for DOS, but it's a nice litte
utillity. You can get it from the IBM Storage Homepage or from this URL
"<A HREF="http://service.boulder.ibm.com/storage/hddtech/zap.exe"
	>http://service.boulder.ibm.com/storage/hddtech/zap.exe</A>" and it has
approx. 18 KB.
</P>
<P>
I know it's definitely not a LINUX Answer, but maybe it's a useful Hint.
</P>
<P>
Sincerely

[Ben] 
Very interesting site, Lisa! I'm afraid that I know very little about
implementing sign languages on a computer - despite knowing a little bit of
ASL (learned from the docents at the Renaissance Fair while working there.)
It would actually be an interesting challenge... Linux, along with the Unix
community in general, has supported access for people with disabilities
from its very early days - there is accessibility stuff built right into X,
there's lots of support for Braille output devices, and the Emacs "Audio
Desktop" is billed as "the first zero-cost Internet access solution for
blind and visually impaired users." A signwriting program would fit in
well, and (I would think) would be well received.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hmm. I can visualize a sign "editor" that would let you build each symbol
in the "sign group", one piece at a time, then let you jump to the next
position using a set of keys for direction... yeah, definitely a bit of a
challenge.
