What you're seeing there is a difference in one of the C lib calls (I
forget which -- use strace to find out).  I suspect there isn't an easy
way unless there's a wrapper library for it.

Also, "Cannot execute binary file" is usually a response to trying to
exec a non-Linux executable in Linux. You might want to check exactly
what is being executed as you call 'automount'; you may have, for
example, copied something from your Solaris boxes into your Linux
machines. As Thomas mentioned, 'strace' is your friend.

I was teaching a Linux class to a bunch of Windows C++ developers a
while back.  When I showed them strace, their eyes got wide.  When I
showed them how to strace an already running program, their jaws
dropped.  The lead developer said "I spent the last three days rewriting
my app to do that to trace a bug!"

<p>
There are times I think Windows developers don't truly grok computers.

Well, <strong>duh</strong>. Otherwise, they'd hear the horrible screams of the tortured
electrons and feel the suffering of the innocent CPU cycles as they are
mercilessly mangled by their OS of choice. No one could possibly grok
and withstand such horror.

Apropos of nothing, I wonder if drinking those 8 cups of double espresso
this morning has had any effect. Other than making my eyebrows climb to
the back of my head, I mean.
