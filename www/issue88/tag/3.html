Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am a Linux fan and user (although a newbie).  Recently I read the
paper entitled "Maintainability of the Linux Kernel"
(<A HREF="http://www.isse.gmu.edu/faculty/ofut/rsrch/papers/linux-maint.pdf"
	>http://www.isse.gmu.edu/faculty/ofut/rsrch/papers/linux-maint.pdf</A>) in a
course I am enrolled in at Colorado State University.  The paper is
essentially saying that the Linux kernel is growing linearly, but that
common coupling (if you are like me and cannot remember what kind of
coupling is what - think global variables here.) is increasing at an
exponential rate.  Side note, for what it is worth - the paper was
published in what I have been told is one of the "most respected"
software journals.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have searched around on the web and have been unable to find any kind
of a reply to this paper from a knowledgeable Linux supporter.  I would
be very interested in hearing the viewpoint from the "other side" of
this issue!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for your time,
Beth Richardson

Basically it sounds like they're trying to prove that bees can't
fly.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(Traditional aerodynamic theories and the Bernoulli principle can't
be used to explain how bees and houseflies can remain aloft; this
is actually proof of some limitations in those theories.  In reality
the weight of a bee or a fly relative to air density means that
insect can do something a little closer to "swimming" through the
air --- their mass makes air relatively viscous to them.  Traditional
aerodynamic formulae are written to cover the case where the mass of
the aircraft is so high vs. air density that some factors can be
ignored.).

I glanced at the article, which is written in typically opaque academic
style.  In other words, it's hard to read.  I'll admit that I didn't
have the time to analyze (decipher) it; and I don't have the stature
of any of these researchers.  However, you've asked me, so I'll give
my unqualified opinion.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Basically they're predicting that maintainance of the Linux kernel
will grow increasing difficult over time because a large number of
new developments (modules, device drivers, etc) are "coupled"
(depend on) a core set of global variables.

Wouldn't this affect <EM>any</EM> OS? I view modules/device drives depending on a core
as a good thing, when compared to the alterative, which is depending on a wide
range on varibles. (Or perheps the writers have a different idea in mind. But
what other alterative to depending a core would there be other than depending on
a lot of things?)

You said it yourself further down; "micro-kernel". It seems to be the
favorite rant of the ivory-tower CS academic (by their maunderings shall
ye know them...), although proof of this world-shattering marvel seems
to be long in coming. Hurd's Mach kernel's been out, what, a year and
more?

Here comes a Hurd of skeletons out of my closet! Being a very marginal
Hurd hacker myself, I couldn't let some of the remarks about the Hurd
pass. Most of the things below have been better written of elsewhere
by more competent people (the Hurd Wiki for example,
<A HREF="http://hurd.gnufans.org"
	>http://hurd.gnufans.org</A>) but here goes anyway...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The Mach micro-kernel is what the Hurd runs on the top of. In some
ways Hurd/Mach is more like <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>/Linux. Mach is <EM>not</EM> a part of the
Hurd. The newer Hurd runs over the top of a version of Mach built
using Utah's "oskit". Others have run the "Hurd" over "L-4" and other
micro-kernels.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The lack of <EM>hardware</EM> and other support in the existing micro-kernels
is certainly <EM>one</EM> of things that is holding back the common
acceptance of the Hurd. (For example neither "mach" nor "oskit" have
support for my video card--i810--for which support came late in the
Linux 2.2 series).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, if only Linux was written in a sufficiently "de-coupled" way to
allow the stripping away of the file-system and execution system, we
would have a good micro-kernel already! The way things are, the "oskit"
guys are perenially playing catch-up to incorporate Linux kernel
drivers. Since these drivers are not sufficiently de-coupled they are
harder to incorporate.
</blockQuote>

This suggests that the programming models are too divergent in
some ways.  For each class of device there are a small number of
operations (fops, bops, ioctl()s) that have to be supported
(open, seek, close, read, write, etc).  There are relatively few
interactions with the rest of the kernel for most of this
(which is why simple device driver coding is in a different class
from other forms of kernel hacking).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The hardest part of device driver coding is getting enough information
from a vendor to actually implement each required operation.  In some
cases there are significant complications for some very complex devices
(particularly in the case of video drivers; which, under Linux
sans framebuffer drivers, are often implemented in user space by
XFree86.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It's hard to imagine that any one device driver would be that difficult
to port from Linux to any other reasonable OS.  Of course the fact that
there are THOUSANDS of device drivers and variants within each device
driver does make it more difficult.  It suggestst the HURD needs
thousands (or at least hundreds) of people working on the porting.
Obiviously, if five hundred HURD hackers could crank out a device
driver every 2 months for about a year --- they'd probably be caught up
with Linux device driver support.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course I've only written one device driver for Linux (and that was
a dirt simple watchdog driver NAS system motherboard) and helped on a
couple more (MTD/flash drivers, same hardware).  It's not so much
"writing a driver" as plugging a few new values into someone else's
driver, and reworking a few bits here or there.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One wonders if many device drivers could be consolidated into some
form of very clever table-driven code.  (Undoubtedly what the UDDI
movement of a few years ago was trying to foist on everyone).

Linux was running on Mach (mkLinux) about 5 years ago.  I seem to
recall that someone was running a port of Linux (or mkLinux) on
an L4 microkernel about 4 years ago (on a PA RISC system if I
recall correctly).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It's still not HURD/Linux --- but, as you say, it could (eventually) be.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Linux isn't really monolithic, but it certainly isn't a microkernel.
This bothers purists; but it works.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Future releases of Linux might focus considerably more on restructing
the code, providing greater modularity and massively increasing the
number of build-time configuration options.  Normal users (server and
workstation) don't want more kernel configuration options.  However,
embedded systems and hardware engineers (especially for the big
NUMA machines and clustering system) <EM>need</EM> them.  So the toolchain
and build environment for the Linux kernel will have to be refined.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As for features we don't have yet (in the mainstream Linux kernel):
translucent/overlay/union filesystems, transparent process checkpoint
and restore,  true swapping (in addition to paging, might come
naturally out of checkpointing), network console, SSI (system
system image) HA clustering (something like VAX clusters would be
nice from what I hear), and the crashdump, interactive debuggers,
trace toolkit, dprobes and other stuff that was "left out" of
2.5 in the later stages before the feature freeze last year.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm sure there are things I'm forgetting and others that I've never
even thought of.  With all the journaling, EAs and ACLs, and the LSM
hooks and various MAC (mandatory access contol) mechanisms in LIDS,
SELinux, LOMAC, RSBAC and other patches, we aren't missing much that
was ever available in other forms of UNIX or other server operating
systems.  (The new IPSec and crypto code will also need considerable
refinement).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
After that, maybe Linux really will settle down to maintenance;
to optimization, restructuring, consolidation, and dead code
removal.  Linus will might find that stuff terminally boring and
move on to some new project.

LiS is there for those that really need it.  It'll probably never be
in the mainstream kernel.  However, I envision something a like a cross
between the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> APT system and the <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> ports system (or LNX-BBCs
Gar or Gentoo's source/package systems) for the kernel.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In this case some niche, non-mainstream kernel patches would not be
included in Linus' tarball, but hooks would be found in a vendor
augmented kbuild (and/or Makefile collection) that could present
options for many additional patches (like the FOLK/WOLK {Fully,Working}
OverLoaded Kernel).  If you selected any of these enhancements then the
appropriate set of patches would be automatically fetched and applied,
and any submenus to the configuration dialog would appear.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Such a system would have the benefit of allowing Linus to keep working
exactly as he does now, keeping pristine kernels, while making it vastly
easier for sysadmins and developers to incorporate those patches that
they want to try.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If it was done <EM>right</EM> it would be part of UnitedLinux, <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>, and
Debian.  There would be a small independent group that would maintain
the augmented build system.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The biggest technical hurdle would be patch ordering.  In some cases
portions of some patches might have to be consolidated into one or more
patches that exist solely to prevent unintended dependency loops.  We see
this among Debian GNU/Linux patches fairly often --- though those are
binary package dependencies rather than source code patch dependencies.
We'd never want a case where you <EM>had</EM> to include LiS patches because
the patch maintainer applied it first in his/her sequence and one of
its changes became the context for another patch --- some patch that
didn't <EM>functionally</EM> depend on LiS but only seemed to for context.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I think something like this was part of Eric S. Raymond's vision for
his ill-fated CML2.  However, ESR's work wasn't in vain; a kbuild
system in C was written and will be refined over time.  Eventually it
may develop into something with the same features that he wanted to
see (though it will take longer).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As examples of more radical changes that some niches might need or want
in their kernels: there used to be a suite of 'ps' utilities that
worked without needing <TT>/proc.</TT>  The traditional ps utils worked by
walking through <TT>/dev/kmem</TT> traversing a couple of data structures there.
I even remember seeing another "devps" suite, which provided a simple
device interface alternative to proc.  The purpose of this was to allow
deeply embedded, tightly memory constrained kernels to work in a
smaller footprint.  These run applications that have little or no need
for some of the introspection that is provided by <TT>/proc</TT> trees, and have
only the most minimal process control needs. It may be that <TT>/proc</TT> has become
so interwoven into the Linux internals that a kernel simply can't be built
with out it (that the build option simply affects whether <TT>/proc</TT> is
visible from userspace).  These embedded systems engineers might still
want to introduce a fair number of #defines to optionally trim out
large parts of <TT>/proc.</TT>  Another example is the patch I read about that
effectively refines the printk macro as a C comment; thus making a
megabyte (uncompressed) of <TT> prink()</TT>' calls disappear in the
pre-processor pass.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
These are things that normal users (general purpose servers and
workstations) should NOT mess with.  Things that would break a variety
of general purpose programs.  However, they can be vital to some
niches.  I doubt we'll ever see Linux compete with eCOS on the low end;
but having a healthy overlap would be good.

You know, every time I get to thinking about what the Linux kernel should have,
I find out it's in 2.5. Really. I was thinking, Linux is great but it needs
better security, more than just standard linux permissions. Then I look at 2.5:
Linux Security Modules. Well, we need a generic was to assign attributes to
files, other then the permission bits. 2.5 has extened attribues (name:value
pairs at the inode level) and extended POSIX ACLs.

What you are saying is true and is (according to me) <EM>the</EM> reason why
people will be running the Hurd a few years from now!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The point is that many features of micro-kernels (such as a
user-process running it's own filesystem and execution system a la
user-mode-linux) are becoming features of Linux. At some point folks
will say "Wait a minute! I'm only using the (micro) kernel part of
Linux as root. Why don't I move all the other stuff into user space?"
At this point they <EM>will</EM> be running the Hurd/Linux or something like
it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Think of the situation in 89-91 when folks on DOS or Minix were
jumping through hoops in order to make their boxes run gcc and
emacs. Suddenly, the hoops could be removed because of Linux. The same
way the "coupled" parts of Linux <EM>are</EM> preventing <EM>some</EM> people from
doing things they would like to do with their system. As more people
are obstructed by those parts---voila Linux becomes (or gives way to)
a micro-kernel based system.

Thus any change to the
core requires an explosion of changes to all the modules which
depended upon it.  They are correct (to a degree).  However they
gloss over a few points (lying with statistics).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
First point: no one said that maintaining and developing kernels
should be easy.  It is recognized as one of the most difficult
undertakings in programming (whether it's an operating system kernel
or an RDBMS "engine" --- kernel).  "Difficult" is subjective.  It
falls far short of "impossible."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Second point: They accept it as already proven that "common" coupling
leads to increasing numbers of regression faults (giving references
to other documents that allege to prove this) and then they provide
metrics about what <EM>they</EM> are calling common coupling.  Nowhere do they
give an example of <EM>one</EM> variable that is "common coupled" and explain
how different things are coupled to it.  Nor do they show an example
of how the kernel might be "restructured with common coupling reduced
to a bare minimum" (p.13).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, it's a research paper that was funded by the NSF (National Science
Foundation).  I'm sure the authors got good grades on it.  However,
like too much academic "work" it is of little consequence to the rest
of us.  They fail to show a practical alternative and fail to enlighten
us.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Mostly this paper sounds like the periodic whining that used to come
up on the kernel mailing list: "Linux should be re-written in C++
and should be based on an object-oriented design."  The usual response
amounts to: go to it; come back when you want to show us a working
prototype.

Couldn't parts of the kernel be written in C, and others in C++? (okay,
technically it would probably all be C++ if such a shift did occur, but
you can write C in a C++ compiler just fine. Right? Or maybe I just don't
know what I'm talking about.)

There are many view points to this. But why would you want to rewrite
parts of it in C++?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Popular answer is: C++ is object-oriented, it has
polymorphism, inheritance etc. Umm, I can do all that in C and kernel
folks have used those methods extensively. The function pointers,
gotos may not be as clean as real virtual functions and exception
handling. But those C++ features come with a price. The compilers
haven't progressed enough to deliver the performance equivalent to
hand-written C code.

I'm sure that the authors would argue that "better programming and
design techniques" (undoubtedly on their aggenda for their next
NSF grant proposal) would result in less of this "common" coupling
and more of the "elite" coupling.  (Personally I have no problem
coupling with commoners --- just do it safely!)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As for writing "parts" of Linux in C++ --- there is the rather major
issue of identifier mangling.  In order to support polymorphism and
especially function overloading and over-riding, C++ compilers have
to modify the identifiers in their symbol tables in ways that C
compiler never have to do.  As a consequence of this it is very
difficult to link C and C++ modules.  Remember, loadable modules in
Linux are linkable .o files.  It just so happens that they are
dynmically loaded (a little like some .so files in user space, through
the <TT> dlopen()</TT> API --- but different because this is kernel space and
you can't use <TT> dlopen()</TT> or anything like it).

I'm reminded of a quote: "Linux is obsolete" -- Andrew Tanenbaum. He said this
in the (now) famous flame-war between himself and Linus Torvalds. His main
argument was the micro-kernels are better than monolithic kernels and thus Linux
was terribly outdated. (His other point was that linux wasn't portable.) BTW, I
plan to get my hands on some Debian/hurd (Or is that "GNU/hurd"?

GNU/Hurd. There is a lot of work to do before we can make a release.

Do toss out a few bytes of info if you do download and install it. I'm
not against micro-kernels at all; I'm just slightly annoyed by people
whose credentials don't include the Hard Knocks U. screaming "Your
kernel sucks! You should stab yourself with a plastic fork!" My approach
is sorta like the one reported in c.o.l.: "Let's see the significant
benefits."

These were anecdotal comments in an press interview --- they were
not intended to be delivered with scholastic rigor.  I think it
weakens the paper considerably (for reasons quite apart from my
disagreement with the statements themselves).

What is "the Long run?"  Unix is a hair over 30 years old.  The entire
field of electronic computing is about 50 or 60 years old. Linux is
about 12 years old.  Linux is still growing rapidly and probably won't
peak in marketshare for at last 5 to 10 years.  Thus Linux could easily
last longer than proprietary forms of UNIX did.  (This is not to say
that Linux is the ultimate operating system.  In 5 to 10 years there
is likely to be an emerging contender like EROS (<A HREF="http://www.eros-os.org"
	>http://www.eros-os.org</A> )
or something I've never heard of.  In 15 to 20 years we might be
discussing a paper that quotes Linus Torvalds as saying: "I've read
some of the EROS code, and it's not going to be a success in the long
run."

(We won't even get into the criteria for "success" in Ken Thompson's
comment --- because I think that Linux' current status is already been
a huge success by the standards of it's advocates and to the chagrin
of it's detractors.  By many accounts Linux is already more
"successful" than UNIX --- having been installed on more systems than
all UNIX predecessors combined --- an installation base that is only
recently rivaled by MacOS X in the UNIX world)
