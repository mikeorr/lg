<h1>Functional Programming with Python</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
Programs written in a functional programming 
language (like say Scheme) mirror the structure
of mathematical expressions; math expressions
are composed of  strings of functions, each one
computing a value and producing absolutely no side
effects. The same function, called with the same 
arguments, yields the same result whatever be the
context in which it is called. There is
elegance in structuring code in this way (and also,
a certain amount of simplicity). The Python programming
language has all the features necessary to make it 
good at functional programming (FP). In this article, we
examine a few interesting FP ideas like higher order
functions, closures, lambda, currying, etc. from the
`Pythonic' point of view!

<h2>What is Functional Programming?</h2>
<p>
The functions we write as part of our programs are
only superficially similar to mathematical functions.
Let's say we write a function:
<pre class="code">

int current_balance = 100;
int withdraw(int w)
{
   current_balance = current_balance - w;
   return current_balance;
}

</pre>
An invocation of `withdraw(10)' results in a value of 90 being
returned. A subsequent invocation of `withdraw(10)' returns
80. Had `withdraw' been a `pure' mathematical function, it would
have returned the same result for both invocations as the value
being passed is the same. Our program basically `remembers' the
earlier invocations (it has `state') and returns a new value every
time. A mathematical equation like:
<pre class="code">

y = f(a) + g(b) + f(a)

</pre>
has the nice property that it can be reduced to:
<pre class="code">

y = 2*f(a) + g(b)

</pre>
It is virtually impossible for us to perform such reductions on
computer programs which are written as collections of functions
which modify global variables. Reasoning about the correctness of
computer programs becomes more of an activity of exploring all 
kinds of what-if situations rather than generating mathematical 
proofs.
<p>
The `assignment' operator creates its share of problems. Let's
look at a simple loop to compute the factorial:
<pre class="code">

/* Compute factorial of `n' */
int f = 1, n = 5;
while (n &gt; 0) {
   f = f * n;
   n = n - 1;
}
return f;

</pre>
A common mistake which we make is interchanging the two statements
within the body of the loop. The assignment operator, by changing the
value assigned to symbols, forces us to be careful about the order
in which we perform each and every action in our program. 

<p>
The functional programming paradigm encourages us to structure
our programs as collections of `pure' functions which do not have
any global state and which do not make use of the assignment 
operator (note that this is not possible in all situations; a 
banking system will surely have to `remember' lots of stuff). 
Functional programmers use recursive invocation of functions 
(iteration is considered to be a special case of recursion and specific
iteration constructs like the `while' or `for' loop may be
absent altogether) to program repetitive behaviour. Functions are
considered `first class', ie, they can be passed to other functions
and returned from other functions thereby facilitating the creation
of what are called `higher order functions' - a powerful idea
which can capture concisely many complex computational patterns when
combined with the idea of `closures'. 

<h2>Expressing recursion</h2>
<p>
There is nothing magical about defining recursive
functions in Python. Here is the classical factorial
written as a Python function:
<pre class="code">

def fact(n):
   if (n == 0): return 1
   return n * fact(n - 1)

</pre>

<h2>Functions as first class objects</h2>
<p>
Let's define  two functions at the interactive
Python prompt and try some experiments:
<pre class="code">

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;def sqr(x): return x*x
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;def cube(x): return x*x*x
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;sqr
&lt;function sqr at 0x402ba10c&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;a = [sqr, cube]
&gt;&gt;&gt;a[0](2)
&gt;&gt;&gt;def compose(f, g): return f(g(x))
...
&gt;&gt;&gt;compose(sqr, cube, 2)
64
&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre>
We first store the two functions in an array and then invoke
`sqr' as `a[0][2]'.  We then define a function called `compose'
and call it with the two functions `sqr' and `cube' as arguments.
Note the absence of any special notation; we are manipulating
functions as if they were objects like arrays and numbers.

<h2>The power of the higher order function</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation
of Computer Programs</a>, the legendary `wizard book' by
Abelson and Sussman, has a detailed description of the utility
of higher order functions.  A `function' (or a subroutine,
subprogram, procedure) is considered to be a mechanism for
capturing patterns. If we have many statements of the form
<pre class="code">

a*a*a
b*b*b
c*c*c
.....

</pre>

we can think of defining a function called `cube' which captures  the
essence of the pattern and gives it a name.  The ability to pass functions
as arguments to functions greatly broadens the scope of this `pattern
capturing' mechanism. Let's examine a simple function, `sum':
<pre class="code">

def sum(a, b):
   if (a &gt; b): return 0
   else: return a + sum(a+1, b)

</pre>
The function sums all numbers from `a' to `b'. We try to
broaden the scope of the function by making it capable of
manipulating arbitrary sequences, like say:
<pre class="code">

1/(1*3) + 1/(5*7) + 1/(9*11) + ...

</pre>
We note that the above sequence and a sequence like:
<pre class="code">

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ...

</pre>
are similar in the sense that both are `summations'. We
visualize a quantity `a' changing from 1 to 2, 2 to 3 and
so on. The change from 1 to 2 can be captured by means of
a function (a simple `add 1' function). In the case of the 
first series, this quantity is seen to be changing from 1 to 5,
5 to 9, 9 to 11 and so on. Here, the change can be captured
by an `add 4' function. Another small problem. The
terms of the series are not the numbers 1, 5, 9, 11 etc but
the numbers 1/(1*3), 1/(5*7)... But then, this transformation
also can be expressed in terms of a function! These observations
result in the formulation of the function `sigma':
<pre class="code">

def sigma(term, a, next, b):
   if(a &gt; b): return 0
   return term(a) + sigma(term, next(a), next, b)

</pre>

And here's how we call `sigma' to compute the sum of the sequence:
<pre class="code">

1/(1*3) + 1/(5*7) + 1/(9*11) + ...

</pre>
We shall define two functions:
<pre class="code">

def term(x): return 1.0/(x * (x+2))
def next(x): return x + 4

</pre>
and call:
<pre class="code">

sigma(term, 1, next, 1000)

</pre>
That should do the trick! Now it becomes possible for us
to sum any sequence provided we define  two auxiliary
functions. 
<p>
That's not the end of the story. We should think of generalizing
`sigma'. We note that `sigma' is simply `combining' terms of
a sequence using the combination function `add'. Why not have
a general procedure which will combine the terms of a
series according to a user defined function which is passed as
an argument? Readers should try this as an exercise!

<h2>Using `lambda'</h2>
<p>
We shall try the following at the Python prompt:
<pre class="code">

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;lambda x: x+4
&lt;function &lt;lambda;&gt; at 0x402ba25c&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;f = lambda x: x+4
&gt;&gt;&gt;f(3)
7
&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre>
The lambda keyword is used for creating anonymous functions.
The body of a lambda should be composed of simple expressions
only. In the above example, we use lambda to create a function
which accepts an argument and returns it after adding four. 
We should think of using `lambda' whenever we need to define a
function just for the purpose of passing it over to another
function. As an example:
<pre class="code">

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;map(lambda x:x*x, [1,3,7,9])
[1, 9, 49, 81]
&gt;&gt;&gt;filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, range(10))
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre>
The map function accepts a function and a list as argument
and returns the list obtained by applying the function on
each element of the original list. Filter is similar; it 
returns a list composed of only those elements for which the
function returns true.

<h2>Closures</h2>
<p>
Python allows function definitions to be nested. 
<pre class="code">

def add(x):
   return lambda(y): x+y

</pre>
Invoking add(3) will result in a function of one
argument being returned. Now, this function has a
peculiar property - it's capable of remembering the
environment in which it was created. The value of `x'
in the body of the function is the value supplied when
`add' was invoked. You call such functions `closures'.
Invoking add(3)(4) will result in this function executing
with value of x = 3 and y = 4.
<p>
You might have noticed something interesting here. Instead
of defining a function `add' which accepts two arguments, we
were able to get the same effect by nesting a one-argument
function within another one argument function. It's possible to
take this to any level:
<pre class="code">

def add3(x):
   return lambda y: lambda z: x+y+z

</pre>
Now, we can call `add3(1)(2)(3)'! This idea goes by the name
`currying' in the FP community.
<p>
Let's try to write a function for doing `numerical' differentiation.
<pre class="code">

def differentiate(f):
   return lambda x: (f(x+0.001) - f(x))/0.001

</pre>
The function can be tested out as follows:
<pre class="code">

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;p = differentiate(cube)
&gt;&gt;&gt;p(2)
12
&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre>
Calling differentiate with argument `cube' will result in a
one-argument function being returned which remembers the value
of `f' to be equal to `cube'. Now, calling this function with
argument say 2 will result in the evaluation of:
<pre class="code">

(cube(2+0.001) - cube(2))/0.001

</pre>

<h2>A bit more lambda fun</h2>
<p>
The idea of functional programming being `computing with functions'
can be taken to its extreme; one might even go so far as to say
that EVERYTHING (yes, I mean even things like integers, truth,
falsehood, literally EVERYTHING) can be expressed as functions. A
really smart guy called Alonzo Church had figured out how to do
this and produced a remarkable piece of work called the `Lambda Calculus'.
We shall not go into the details of Church's work - but will simply
look at a few functions just for the fun of it.
<p>
Let's have our own definitions for `true' and `false':
<pre class="code">

true = lambda x, y: x
false = lambda x, y: y
iff = lambda p, x, y: p(x, y)

</pre>
We define true as a function which accepts two arguments and returns
the first one; false returns the second argument. The logic of this
definition becomes clear when we look at the context where we make 
use of `true' and `false'; calling iff(true, 2, 3) will result in the
number 2 being returned and calling iff(false, 2, 3) will result in 3
being returned.
<p>
The claim is that all computational constructs can be defined
in terms of lambda. Let's try building up an elementary data
structure, a `pair'.
<pre class="code">

pair = lambda x, y: lambda f: f(x, y)

</pre>
The definition is a bit tricky: a `pair' is a function which
accepts two arguments and returns another function; this time,
a function which accepts one argument and applies that on x and
y. The idea becomes clear when we define two other functions:
<pre class="code">

first = lambda p: p(true)
second = lambda p: p(false)

</pre>
Now, we turn a bit philosophical and ask the question: "what is a pair?"
The answer is, "P is a pair of two objects x and y if there are two
functions `first' and `second' such that first(P) is x and second(P) is y."

Let's now try:
<pre class="code">

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;P=pair(2,3)
&gt;&gt;&gt;first(P)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt;second(P)
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;

</pre>
And that's magic! Think about it!
