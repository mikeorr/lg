<h2>The Case of the Mad Python Programmer</h2>

<blockquote>
<em> It started as a relatively innocent exchange...</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[laugh] Geek. Yeah, that's what makes us good at what we do... and crazy
the rest of the time.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
The *<b>rest</b>* of the time? No, no. I'm crazy 24/7.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Oh. Well, never mind, then. If you're going to be just like *<b>me</b>	*, then
all the rules change.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
The rules can do what they like - I'll just do what I've always done, 
and choose which ones I feel should apply to me.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
...and do what you want the rest of the time, provided you can get away
with it. Yep - been doing that for a *<b>LONG</b>* time.

<blockquote>
<em>But little did I realise just <b>what</b> Ben had been trying to get 
away with.</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[grin] S'all right, I've got it. Took a bit of wrestling this morning,
and I'm sure that any Pythoneer looking at it would have a heart attack,

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
The case was a tough one: for several weeks, various disappearances had 
been reported by Python user groups around Florida. There had been no 
fatalities, but it was only a matter of time.
  
<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
"Programmers missing; exposure to deadly code cited as possible cause.
St. Augustine man has been questioned and released into the wild on his
own recognizance, although no one is sure *why*."

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
We took him in for questioning, but no dice. He just sat there, unruffled, 
occassionally flashing a grin that could mean "who, me?", "I know something 
you don't know", or "I shouldn't be allowed to use cutlery unsupervised, 
even if it is plastic".

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
'Ey, that was just my dyspeptic look - I had a greasy breakfast that
morning! You can't prove anything, I wasn't there, and she showed me a
driver's license that said she was over 18 anyway.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
We knew it was him. He knew we knew. We knew that he knew that we knew. 
He knew that we knew that he knew that we knew that... Hey, is 'knew' even 
a word? We knew that it was, and he knew that we knew, but now we don't 
know, and he knew that we knew, but didn't know, and we knew that we didn't 
know, but we knew, and he knew that. And... damn!

<p>
We had to let him go, because even though we kn... were sure that it was him, 
nothing would stick. He was as slippery as a banana skin in an oil spill on an 
ice skating rink, just as dangerous, and even less likely. We tried to tail 
him, but started to think that he knew, and... well, you can guess the rest.

<p>
We had a hospital ward full of catatonic programmers, and no leads. The 
pressure was building, but we knew he'd slip - they always do. We pulled in 
favours everywhere we could, and set the perfect trap - a Python conference.

<p>
Now, we play the waiting game...

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
With the native cunning of the insane, the hunted man avoided the
Bantu man-trap, the Vietnamese punji-stake pit, and the Russian apartment 
building (designed to instantly collapse on those
unwary enough to enter it.) He peered suspiciously around the bush, and
seeing no Python code anywhere, stepped into the open...

<p>
<b>* SNAP!!! *</b>

<p>
"'Allo! Crocodile 'Untah 'ere, with a mad Python programmah caught in me
nets. Now - a good Wildlife Management professional always carries a
dual-Pentium Linux laptop with several gigaboits of mem'ry and just
simply _oodles_ of hard-drive space, as well as a satellite uplink, so I
think we can take care of this ornery little fella right 'ere and now..."

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Know...uh...now we kne....ng! had an idea of how to deal with him, we got 
our confession - we sent out mail to all the usual lists, asking if Python 
could be obfuscated. He didn't rise to the bait, until we declared all the 
examples we were given perfectly legible, and that all we could do now was 
learn C++... then we had him.

<p>
We moved in. It took six men just to hold him down, but he got an arm free 
and hit us with a regex to parse valid e-mail addresses. Poor Charlie got 
hit the hardest - the doctors says he'll be confined to Outlook for the 
rest of his life. In the end, all it took was our quick thinking Australian 
friend coming to the rescue by mentioning that the State Penn was switching 
to Linux.

<p>
There was an ugly incident when one of the guards made a wise-crack about soap, 
but he calmed down when he was told that function calls through XML has been 
ruled both a cruel and an unusual punishment, and has become a model prisoner. 
He's been tipped for early release, and mailed us a couple of times, thanking us 
for showing him the error of his ways, and even offered to take us to dinner when 
he gets out on parole. We've accepted, but only on the condition that it's a Chinese 
restaurant.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[laugh] ...with Perl one-liners hidden in the fortune cookies. Given how
many geeks hang out in Chinese restaurants (at least on the West Coast),
I wonder if that would be a profitable sideline?
