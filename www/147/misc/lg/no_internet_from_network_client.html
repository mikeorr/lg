I have been following "Serving Your Home Network on a Silver Platter
with Ubuntu" which is an August article.  Just what I needed <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
One problem is that I cannot access the Internet from a client.  Not
sure why and do not know where to look.  Any ideas please?
There are two NIC's, eth0 which connects only to the router and eth1
which is the local network connected to a hub.
This is the route from the server and it appears to work - I can ping
and download

<p>
This is the route from a client. I can access the server by putty but I
cannot reach the Internet.

</pre>
 This is the hosts file on the server
<pre>

This is the hosts file on the client (at present I need to switch the cable
to get the Internet which is why there are two entries for spider)
<pre>
127.0.0.1 localhost
 
127.0.1.1 client-1

And this is a trace from the client

Did you remember to turn on IP forwarding on the server?

Second thing is the "/etc/resolv.conf" on the client. It should point
to the server where your DNS caching service is running.

<p>
by default a linux-"server" will not accept and resend packages which
were not intended for itself. It will drop them silently. 
</p>


<p>
You need to do two things to get ip-forwarding for clients on a private
network: 
</p>

<pre>
1) tell the network module to do ANY forwarding at all
 
2) masq(erade) private IPs when sent out in the  WWWorld
</pre>
The following script does both. The echo switches on forwarding, i.e.
if the server gets an ip-packet which is intended for somewhere else,
it will now forward them according to the routing table. 
</p>

<p>
Then the firewall rules are completely wiped out and replaced by the
three allow everything rules followed by the masqerade rule which will
send ip-packets from clients on the private network (192,168.*.*) with
the real IP of the server and remembers where to send answers back to.
</p>



<p>
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
 
# einschalten des IP Forwarding
echo 1 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
 
# Leeren und loeschen aller evtl. existierenden Regeln
/sbin/iptables -F
 
# Wir erlauben einfach alles
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -j ACCEPT
/sbin/iptables -A OUTPUT -j ACCEPT
/sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -j ACCEPT
 
# Wir schalten nur noch masquerading an
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
</pre>
If you would like somewhat less open firewall rules you could set up a
few iptable rules yourself or you might want to look into firestarter,
which is a gui for firewall configuration. It even has a checkbox for
"ip forwarding" doing the above.

I am struggling on this ....  I have been trying to understand for the last
three hours.  Guess I must be real stupid though ...
</p>

<p>
I can change the resolv.conf simply through the network settings of the
nic.  Easy
</p>

<p>
For the firewall ....  I really think that the rules I followed in the
tutorial are properly entered.  They do seem to be following what you have
set out.
</p>

<p>
Taking one step back, is it possible that I have made a mess with the IP
addresses or at least the netmask ... ?  The reason for asking is that I saw
an error SIOCADDRT: No such process.  There is lots of information on google
but it is all over the place.  Generally google responses seem to suggest
that the address range is wrong but this seems a bit wild to me ....  the ip
calculators no doubt work but were written by people who really know.
Clueless me then has to try and work out what all the information means ....
<img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">  Since I have also seen an error of Network is unreachable I really
wonder if this is not a fundamental error of mine in setting up the NIC's

<p>
I have just completed playing with the IP settings ......  I changed
everything, got the same result and changed them back again.  Tried both
with Webmin and manually.
</p>

<p>
Also experimented in a similar way on the client.
</p>

<p>
I think that the router is kicking in and allocating the IP addresses - I
powered off the router and there were error messages and problems getting an
IP on the client.  I edited the router to act as a bridge but I could not
see any effect.
</p>

<p>
So I get the idea that this problem is all to do with how traffic is routed
which seems to support the error messages.

But I find this extremely difficult to read. Hm... why do you have TWO
private networks? Or is the one assigned from the router? 
</p>

<p>
Do you want the router to the NAT masquerading or do you want the linux
box to do the maquerading?
</p>

<p>
I guess from the "G" above that 192.168.1.1 is your router ?
</p>

<p>
Then your client would have 10.*.*.* IPs?

<p>
You should not have the same box twice with different IPs on the same
interface I think. You should decide if you have one private network
between your server and your router and another for the clients -- or
if you put your clients in the same subnet. If your router can do NAT
properly for more than one client (DSL router should, even if it has
only one eth-connector), I would give all clients a 10.*.*.* IP and
then you can switch off all firewalling on the server and activate the
forwarding (that echo line in the script, IMPORTANT!). 
</p>

<p>
 
Right now I guess your clients go to the router (you siad that works)
but have another private IP the router doesn't know about so the router
does its job and drops them. Or the server already is not forwarding
them.

Sorry that the information did not appear very well .....  sounds like
I have really made a mess.
What I was trying to do was to set up eth0 only for connection to the
router and to set up eth1 only for the local network.  I would like to
stay away from the router and get the server to do the NAT. Think I
have this set up correctly as part of the shorewall
configuration.Accessing the Webmin front end has now really slowed
down .....  perhaps this is a reflection of my having confused the
network traffic....  What should I now delete? (presumably the static
and active route to eth0 since it is already stated as a gateway)eth0
uses 192.168.x.x and eth1 uses 10.0.x.x  and yes, 192.168.1.1 is the
router.I have restated the routing table in a column form to try and
make it easier to read the information.

Just a follow up from my last message ......
</p>

<p>
I googled the webmin slow down and fixed it by deleting the static and
active route.  Nothing else changed though but webmin is back to fast.  I
restarted the network connections on the server and noticed that the IP for
eth0 may be coming from the router which is not what was intended.  I looked
at the leases in dhcp on the server and can only see the eth1 leases.
</p>

<p>
So it looks like if I can work out how to get eth0 to get its lease from the
server then perhaps it may then be identified and work .....  (perhaps is
probably  the right word)...

I am able to now browse websites, so squid is working and somehow finding

<p>

If I ping server eth0 from a client I get Network is not reachable.

I've always found that when things get this confusing, the best bet is
to go back to a "known state" and build up from there. I also suggest
making the changes - e.g., in your /etc/resolv.conf - by hand rather
than via some interface such as Webmin; that way, you know, 100%, that
those changes <em>have</em> happened, and happened corectly.
</p>

<p>
Step 1: Get your router connected to your ISP; make sure you can ping
your upstream host from it. Note its IP range for the local network. (For
ease of explanation, I'm going to assume that you're using a Linux box
as your router, that the router is called 'Tyr' and that the NATted host
is 'Fenrir' - because that's what mine are actually called. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> 
</p>

<p>
Example of a connected router:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">

</pre>
'ppp0' is the "outside" interface, connecting to the ISP; 'eth0' is the
inside one, facing the LAN.
</p>


<p>
Step 2: Connect the host for which you're going to do NAT to the router,
give it an IP (whether via a DHCP request - i.e., "pump", "dhclient", or
something similar - or manually, e.g. "sudo ifconfig eth0
192.168.0.101") and make sure that you can ping the router from that
host.

Step 3: Configure and enable forwarding on the router. Here's the script
that I use; note that I enable forwarding for anything <em>except</em> the
ports used by Spamassassin (it was a fix for an old problem, perhaps no
longer necessary, but - like dead yeast in beer - it does me no harm):
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Wed Mar 16 11:36:35 EST 2005
 
# Optional IP spec
ip=$1
[ -z "$ip" ] &amp;&amp; ip=192.168.0.101
 
# Flush iptables
iptables -F
 
# Masquerade any packets that go our from the specified address 
iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE -s $ip/32
 
# Forward any packets <em>for</em> host (except spamassassin)
iptables -I FORWARD -s $ip/32 --protocol tcp --sport ! 783 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -s $ip/32 --protocol udp --sport ! 783 -j ACCEPT
# Forward any packets <em>from</em> host (except spamassassin)
iptables -I FORWARD -d $ip/32 --protocol tcp --dport ! 783 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD -d $ip/32 --protocol udp --dport ! 783 -j ACCEPT
  
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre>
Step 4: Make sure that the routing and the DNS services are properly
configured on the local host. This means that the "route" command should
report the router as the gateway, and that 'cat /etc/resolv.conf' should
show the appropriate entries for your DNS server (either your router, if
it's configured to do that, or some other upstream DNS host.)
</p>

<p>
Note: the 'ping' and the 'host' commands are your friends in any
troubleshooting you do. The first will show you whether you have a
connection, at least locally (many Internet-connected hosts turn off UDP
to that port to prevent ping-flood attacks); the second will show you if
you're actually resolving host names.

Thanks for the response.  This information is very good .....  and it will
help me <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I have been thinking about what to do and I really do appreciate the
assistance that has been given to me ....  but I do not want to drive anyone
crazy.
</p>

<p>
I started this process with the server working but also not working in that
the network was not performing.  Then I surfed around and found the tutorial
in the August issue which is very good.
</p>

<p>
So the decision I have just made is that I am going to get out the install
CD and start again from scratch.  Having now been to hell and back again
means that I have at least some idea now. What I am going to do is to follow
the tutorial from the very beginning and see what happens.....
</p>

<p>
thanks for all the input and I will post soon when I have the system back up
again ....
</p>


<p>

<p>
Final response ......  just in the last few stages of setting up the server
from scratch.  All went reasonably well.  The biggest problem was the ISP
loosing the Internet just when I was updating ...  did not realize it was
their headache at the time .....
</p>

<p>
Quite why I had the initial problems I really do not understand since I
cannot see anything different in the process but things are now working <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Thanks to everyone who added comments.
