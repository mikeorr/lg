<P>
Dear and gentle readers.  Those who enjoy finding out what stumps the
mighty and shy among the Answer Gang.   Children of all ages, ladies
and... ahem.
</P>
<P>
I've just been through the troubleshooting time of my life, trying to
learn exactly where all my memory leaks are going.  Heck, I've even
chased down a few.  But what I'd like to know - among you out there who
play in somewhat deeper magic than I do - is how you find out what
within a kernel is using what memory?  I mean, if there aren't many
processes running, they don't look like they're using a lot, and I don't
have a ramdisk open, how can I tell what's using it up?
</P>
<P>
Of course <EM>I</EM> am interested in the answer to this question - and to be a
little more specific I'll not that I've spotted ext3fs journals and the
USB subsystem leaking so far, mainly by trial and error and science; invoking
different things while taking good notes.  Yes, I'll be trying some 2.6
kernels - do read a few of the 2c Tips this time around if you're
inclined to join me in that - but I just don't think I've found
everything.
</P>
<P>
If anyone would like to write an article on a particular problem, how
it stumped you, and how you worked your way past it to learn what
<EM>really</EM> happened under the hood -- I think we'd enjoy reading it.
See our see our <A HREF="../faq/author.html">author submission guidelines</A>  for details, and then send mail
to <A HREF="mailto:articles@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>articles@lists.linuxgazette.net</A>.
</P>
<P>
Simply good tips on troubleshooting tricks not found in the average
toolbox?  Send them to <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"

Okay, it's been in the Mailbag for 3 months running now, with different
voices out there.  Obviously there is sincere interest in a Windows
Defector column.   Now what we need is an author who wants to become
its regular columnist, and can keep to a schedule.
</P>
<P>
Send a note to <A HREF="mailto:articles@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>articles@lists.linuxgazette.net</A> describing your views for the
column, including some posible themes for your first two or 3 articles.

Benefits include full access to the snacks in the TAG fridge, some
good-natured ribbing, and the respect of a bunch of readers planning
their next move in the OS wars.

And I don't want Linux to look like Windows. The advantage of a GUI is
that it visually enumerates the possibilities. That's a mighty powerful
advantage. (Too bad GUIs don't have anything else going for them.)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Cute as that statement may be - and I'm definitely a CLI type of guy by
preference, so it strikes a chord - it's inaccurate. The largest
positive effect of GUIs, IMO, is their transfer of emphasis from
remembering and understanding things (command-line options, program
capabilities, etc.) to recognizing them visually. Note that this is not
much of a value to me - and doesn't seem to be to you - but the
population at large (read "non-technical users") have joyfully fallen at
the feet of the Great God GUI and sobbed in relief.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Jason] 
Doesn't the above paragraph simply say "GUIs visually enumerate the
possiblities"?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was not kidding when I said "That's a mighty powerful advantage". It
<EM>is</EM> a mighty powerful advantage. I was being a bit sarcastic with the
"Too bad GUIs don't have anything else going for them" line, but really,
they don't.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm still trying to get my ideas about computers sorted out. I've been
heavily influence by Chris Crawford's writings. His latest book, "The
art of Interactive Design" is, IMHO, very good.

[Ben] 
In short, GUIs have
made computers usable by the majority - without forcing them to learn
anything past a fairly basic interface (with extensions available for
programs that require higher complexity), and Xerox PARC and Apple
deserve all the recognition and kudos they can handle. Necessarily,
there's a tradeoff: really complex (and thus, most interesting)
functions that don't fit the model are often discarded. Thus, the
dumbing-down of the available software base - at least in the Wind0ws
world; thus, the love/hate relationship between us techies (who use
computers <EM>because</EM> of the really interesting stuff at the sharp edges)
and GUIs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that I am a big believer in writing to the Lowest Common
Denominator: that's how I design interfaces for all the programs I
write, at least if they're going out into the world. Where I differ
sharply from the average MS-flavored GUI is in what I consider the LCD
to be: theirs is set at about the level of the average 5-year-old (as my
gf in Baltimore expressed it upon seeing WinXP for the first time, "Fear
not, little human; Wind0ws will not harm you!");
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
I think this sentiment is demeaning to the level of intelligence and
more importantly the capacity for learning present within most 5-year
olds. In fact the quote you give later applies to children much more
than to (most) adults---they will do smarter things if we treat them as
if they are smart.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My take on this is that the MS-flavoured GUI is aimed at todays computer
illiterate adult who is in addition incapable of responding to such a
"smart approach" having been treated like an "idiot" for a long time.
(Think management and Parkinson's law).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(All this is based on a <EM>very</EM> small case study. My daughter at the age
of 5 had less resistance to using GNU/Linux that my colleagues!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Good grief, Kapil. Not in the least, certainly not by intention; I'm a
big-time fan of kids when it comes to learning ability, and am
absolutely awed by their emotional/nuance radar at that age (from the
start till a couple of years after, actually.) I don't see how saying
that certain material is set at the level of a 5-year-old maps to
5-year-olds being stupid, etc.; I smell an ax being ground. OK, to be
fair, I may have hit a hot button - sorry if so - but that's no reason
to misconscrew my statement completely out of shape.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
I demand more
intelligence and awareness from my users. "You must be at least <EM>this</EM>
intelligent to use my programs" - nope, I don't mind being an elitist at
all. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> I believe, strongly, that people respond to software at the
level at which they've been <EM>trained</EM> to do so: treat them like they're
stupid, and they will be; treat them like they're smart - as I believe
my method does - and they will amaze you with just how smart they are.

[Jason] 
OTOH, I really don't want to have to open a file-manager, browse to the
directory I want, select "remove", check "Force" and "Recursive", and
then click "OK" when I can just type "rm -rf whatever"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
&lt;grin&gt; Poor choice of example. Midnight Commander - it may be a
text-based GUI, but still a GUI - can do shell-based stuff like that
just as quickly or quicker <EM>and</EM> more intuitively (F8 deletes files or
directories - no need to remember "-r" or whatever.) However, in
general, I agree with you emphatically: there are tasks best done (or
that can <EM>only</EM> be done) in the shell. If my "Ten Feet Tall and
Bullet-proof: Java under Linux" article, I did something rather nasty to
all the Wind0ws-based programmers: showed a Perl one-liner that fixed
several thousand broken links in about a thousand files (a real
situation that I'd dealt with shortly before, BTW.) Try <EM>that</EM> in a GUI.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

alias rm='rm -r'

No need to remember F8 or whatever.

[Thomas] 
Hmm, not a recommended thing to do, as I am sure Jason was well aware.
Aliasing command names in that manner to do something potentialy
distructive such as a recursive approach (rm -r) is never a Good Thing

That's completely different from enumeration of possibilities - which,
incidentally, are not enumerated in a GUI but presented in menus and/or
icons. Unless you're using some special meaning of "enumerate", that is.

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> You're talking solely about visual presentation; I'm talking about
the influence it has on the way people use computers. Very different

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What a GUI does very nicely, is listing (Like that word better? 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> )
the choices visually for you. You don't have to know ahead of time that
there's a "Frob the bits" option for something, there's a nice checkbox
right there. No need to lookup --frob in the manpage.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Yes, and. The GUI methodology is that the user's world is shrunk down to
a small number of choices at all times: "File/Edit/Insert/Tools/Help" or
whatever. Click on "File" and you get "New/Open/Save/Save
As/Close/Quit", etc. No need to look up the manpage, right (although you
can always click "Help", for whatever good that's going to do) - but
<EM>also</EM> no need to memorize the manpage to know which functions are
available in that piece of software.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
One of the reasons why I migrated from Windows was that this so called
"common set" routine whereby each menu had a common set of items actually
didn't really exist in the Linux GUI. The diversity that each app had to
offer, appealed to me much more.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
You can always find out with just a
couple of clicks, because the world <EM>is</EM> subdivided into just a few
choices. Spell-checking? Sure, that would be under "Tools".  Paste an
image? "Insert", obviously. Even if you guess wrong, it only takes
another click or two to try again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The point is that someone with no computer skills whatsoever can learn
to operate a basic GUI in just a few minutes - and will be able to
muddle his way through other GUI-based progs, ones he's had no
experience with, on his own because the method of operation is similar
as long as the interface is consistent. (The question of whether
creating access to something as complex and potentially dangerous as
computers for non-technically-sophisticated users will be discussed
later in the Philosophy section of this course; bring your own earplugs
and set your "adult content" filter on "stun".)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
The problem with that is that many users may well rely solely on the use
of the GUI, and if the GUI doesn't have the necessary options that the
underlying CLI apps do, then you loose some of the functionality inherent
with the CLI application.
