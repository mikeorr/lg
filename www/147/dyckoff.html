<h1>Away Mission: David vs. Goliath Technical Conferences</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<h3>
A Review of Recent 2007 Events
</h3>

<p>
Small can be beautiful, as the adage goes. This can be especially true
at a small conference with a few focused tracks that are smack on for
your interests.  On the other hand, a big conference increases the
networking opportunities and also usually offers a large vendor expo.
More vendors often means more literature and swag, but also more noise
--  both literally on the show floor and figuratively with 'Me-Too'
keynotes and marketing slideware.   Those vendors are prospecting and
the target is on your back.
</p>

<p>
2007 brought us some tightly focused conferences, some brand new, that
were very satisfying to attend. One of the most interesting of this
crop was the first Q-Con, a new offering from InfoQ and the JAOO
conference.   This is reviewed below.
</p>


<p>
On the Goliath side are some pretty big events:  RSA World, VM World,
BEA World, Software Development, JavaOne, and, most recently, Oracle
OpenWorld.
</p>

<h3>
Oracle OpenWorld / November 2007
</h3>
<p>
The annual Oracle/Seibel/PeopleSoft/JDEdwards confab is by far the
biggest event I attended last year with over 40,000 attendees and
multiple venues to keep the user realms separate.   They succeeded to
a large measure in holding the business and executive tracks at
different locations from the technical and developer tracks, but the
armies of working tech people had to circumambulate between at least 3
different locations, one almost requiring a short bus ride.
</p>

<p>
There were lots of sessions, but sorting out the good ones from the
chaff was a significant problem, all the more difficult due to seating
limits and fire marshal rules.   Since we had to sign up days in
advance, there were few seats available for those who hadn't
registered or who left their assigned sessions.  Even more irritating,
Oracle seemed to reassign a lot of us to under-attended business and
product sessions --  this may have been a glitch since it occurred on
the second day only, but I couldn't find some of the sessions I had
applied for.   Now 2 or 3 of these were wait-listed for me, so that may
explain a few of the interventions, but the conference catalog was so
huge it was almost impossible to figure out where I had originally
applied.   And since all the good sessions were full, I was being
turned away from many alternate sessions I desired.
</p>

<p>
Oracle OpenWorld content is available here:
<a href="http://www28.cplan.com/cc176/catalog.jsp">http://www28.cplan.com/cc176/catalog.jsp</a>
</p>


<h3>
QCon / November 2007
</h3>

<p>
At the QCon website, they explain: "The QCon Conferences are organized by
the community, for the community. As software developers and architects
ourselves, we wanted to craft the ultimate conference that we would find
outstanding, as attendees. "  This conference was a good first effort.
</p>

<p>
Running up to 5 tracks that differed each day, there was less conflict
and craziness here than most conferences.  Session slides are
publicly posted.  Also, all sessions were audio taped and will be
posted during the year.
</p>

<p>
QCon gets extra points for the best real-time session evaluations.
No prep required, and no time during the session. At the door there
are 3 stacks of cards, These are green, yellow. and red, standing for
good, indifferent, or bad.   Pick a card, drop it in the box. Done.
</p>

<p>
Attendees got a free mini InfoQ book.   This was in lieu of conference
bags which were held up in customs, and this seemed to be more
appreciated by most attendees.
</p>

<p>
The evening keynote was especially entertaining.  Called "50 in 50" it was
an exercise in geek aesthetics and humor.  Dick Gabriel and Guy Steele
presented 50 years of computer languages in 50 minutes, and shared 50 remarks
of exactly 50 words each.  The Lisp section was accompanied by a parody
song, "God programmed in Lisp code", truly a hoot.
</p>

<h3>
EclipseCon / March 2007:
</h3>

<p>
The Eclipse Foundation leads one of  most vibrant open-standards
eco-systems around and that work is most accessible at its annual
March conference in Silicon Valley, EclipseCon.   This was a small
conference that has grown into a major event, with major sponsors, but
its community roots and open source focus save it from the Goliath
conference bloat -- so far.   The pricing used to be under $1000,
but it's now about $1500 at the door, so get those early-bird discounts
if you want to attend.
</p>

<p>
With its new emphasis on web tools and rich client applications, the
conference has gained new breadth.   Technical detail
remains good and the table topic format for the luncheons is one of
the best ways to really network with people sharing common interests.
 And where else can you get keynotes from Cory Doctorow and 'Fake'
Steve Jobs???
</p>

<p>
Several large vendors with primarily proprietary platforms are working
with Eclipse to attract the developer community.  This included BEA,
which is now an Oracle property, as a major participator that offered
free EclipseCon tutorials.   Since IBM seeded a lot of the Eclipse
code base, they also have a major presence.
</p>


<p>
EclipseCon 2008 has more than 350 tutorials and talks covering all
aspects of Eclipse technology and commercial interests. Topics range
from mobile computing to embedded devices and Java to C/C++.  There
are also special talks on business issues and open source.  EclipseCon
will be hosting the OSGi DevCon as well.

<h3>
Zend PHPCon  / Oct 2007
</h3>

<p>
This is a vest pocket conference with a very small expo and only 4
tracks.   That's really 4 session rooms and the tracks aren't that
distinct.   Technical content can be very good, but a few more
sessions in 2007 were vague or overview sessions.   There were
some killer sessions, especially the MySQL and PHP performance tuning
session on the last day.   (That would be the Jay Pipes session, MySQL
Performance Coding From Soup to Nuts, good enough to justify the whole
day spent at the conference.)  I would also recommend Ramsey's
presentation on 'memcached', if it finally gets posted to the Zend
DevZone.  Most of the Con's presentations are available from:
<a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/2637-ZendCon-07-Slides">http://devzone.zend.com/article/2637-ZendCon-07-Slides</a>
</p>

<p>
This conference has been small and focused and brings in a lot of
international users.   However, Sun's recent purchase of MySQL may
increase the presence of Sun and its partners in the future.
</p>

<p>
This year's major announcements included the Zend Studio 3 beta, the
release of Zend Core 2.5, and Micr0s0ft's improved support for PHP
including PHP scripts in IIS and a new SQL Server 2005 Driver for PHP.
</p>

<p>
There were ample opportunities for networking at the beverage and
snack receptions each evening and at the sit-down luncheons, but the
Wednesday evening Yahoo!  sponsored 'PHP Nightclub' was not well
attended early on -- it was too noisy to stay so I don't know how it
developed.   I think a lot  of the attendees were a bit older than the
Yahooligans who put it on.   Also it seemed that pretzels and licorice
sticks were the only food items present.
</p>

<p>
This one has been a good value for 3 years running so consider it in 2008.
</p>


<h3>
DreamForce / October 2007; Tour de Force / January 2008
</h3>

<p>
The annual user conference of SalesForce.com, the archetypal firm for
SAAS paradigms, was an event for partners, prospects, and business
users.   There were tech sessions amidst the 20,000 foot view slide
decks, but they were hard to find and of uneven depth.   The expo
was big, the vendors numerous and lots were giving away iPhones and
'touch iPods.
</p>

<p>
Better to attend the more technical "tour de Force" one day events for
developers and IT managers.   There was only one deep dive technical
session, but a lot of good intro material if you are just starting
with the SalesForce platform and the varied AppExchange for SalesForce
ISVs.    Build an app for the multitudes and SalesForce will host it
and bill for usage while you get fat and famous, unless the
competition does it better.   The traveling road show has a lot to
recommend it --  its FREE, its a single day, and attendees get two
books published by SalesForce to help new developers get used to the
platforms and the tools.   Those are free, too, and and there is a lab
area for a hands-on tutorial.   Did I mention this was free?  A
box lunch is included as well as a developer-level login to the
SalesForce platform.
</p>

<p>
At the kickoff event in San Francisco there were over a thousand
attendees.  There were about 5 times that many folks at the annual
conference, so this was the better way to meet other local users and
ISVs.   So with SalesForce.com, you can choose either the David or the
Goliath event.
</p>

<p>
A schedule of future Tour de Force events are here:
