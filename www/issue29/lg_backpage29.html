<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Tom Bryant</H4>
Tom has been working with computers since 1978.
Since then, I wrote my thesis (on emission lines in planetary nebulae)
on an Apple II, wrote the telemetry processing program with which NASA deduced
some of the early problems with the space telescope (its direct descendant is
still in use today), and lately a program that fixes a serious telemetry
formatting error on the EOS AM-1 satellite.  I've written programs that
display tesseracts, simulate a star cluster with accurate stellar motions,
implement a new language (related to forth), and play the piano!
My interests include (in alphabetical order) 35mm photography, the
American Civil war, Astronomy, Beethoven, Chopin, Classical piano,
Cryptography, Explorer post 1275, Fixing old cars, History, Mathematics,
Rachmaninov, Science, Single Malt Scotch, Sports cars, Telescope making...
My wife and I have 2 kids, 2 cars, 2 birds and 1 18 year old cat.

Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. And a special thanks to Heather Stern for the great job
she is doing on htmlizing "The Answer Guy". It looks good and she's saving
me a lot of work. :-)
<P> 
My wonderful father-in-law, Ralph Richardson, has moved to Seattle from
Southern California. He's been here almost 2 weeks now and it's been fun
helping him get settled in and seeing him on a much more frequent basis. I
know we'll get used to him being here all the time, but right now getting 
to see so much of him feels like vacation. And I can use as much vacation
as I can get! :-)
<P> 
Have fun!
