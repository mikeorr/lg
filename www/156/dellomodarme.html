<h1>A (not so) short overview of the Geographic Information System GRASS</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dellomodarme.html">Matteo Dell'Omodarme</a> and <a href="../authors/valle.html">Giada Valle</a></b></p>


<p>
The aim of this article is to introduce the GRASS GIS software and to show
its basic usage. As with all GIS software, it is quite complex: there
is a huge number of features and controls, and non-trivial theoretical
information is required even for basic use.  Nevertheless, we think that
the quick introduction presented here could be of some help for 
neophyte users who want to master a GIS program.  </p>

<p>
We chose to devote a large part of this article to practical use of the
software, in particular to real data gathering, reprojection of maps, and
output of results. The decision is motivated by the fact that it is very
difficult (and in some case impossible) to find this information
systematically presented on the Net. Conversely, the introduction to the
interface and the ancillary theoretical information are touched upon only
briefly, because they can be retrieved from many sources (see the section
at the end of this document.)
</p>

<p>
Since there are so many topics to introduce, and since we do not want to
sacrifice clarity to brevity, some topics (i.e., climatological
map-making, interfacing GRASS with statistical software, etc.) are postponed
until another article.
</p>      

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
A Geographic Information System (GIS) is software for
gathering, storing, managing, and presenting data that are
geographically referenced. The characteristic of a GIS is the capability
of examining different sets of geo-referenced data and reaching a
conclusion about the existing relationship among the data. 
In other words, a GIS can link information that is difficult to
associate by other means. 
</p>

<p>
For example, it is possible to relate some geo-referenced information
(e.g., disease foci) with other data (e.g., location of urbanized and rural
zones, climatological data). This can reveal new information that can lead
to better decisions about attempting to control the disease's spread.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, GIS software is used in several scientific fields, including resource
management, environmental impact assessment, ecology, archaeology,
cartography, and epidemiology.
</p> 

<p>GISes are normally capable of different types of spatial analysis
and geographical feature processing. Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Topological overlay</strong>: software can overlap the elements of two thematic
maps to create a new map (e.g., users can superimpose the boundary of a
natural park with the boundaries of municipalities to determine the areas
of responsibility of administration for each of these);</li>  
<li><strong>Buffering</strong>: the possibility of defining areas within a given
distance from an element (e.g., lake, hill, river);</li>
<li><strong>Network analysis</strong>: algorithms that, given a network of elements
(e.g., roads), determine the minimum routes between two points;</li> 
<li><strong>Geostatistic analysis</strong>: analysis of the correlation between
 geographically referenced variables (e.g., altitude vs. humidity).</li>
</ul>

<p>Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) GIS (<a
href="http://grass.osgeo.org/">http://grass.osgeo.org/</a>) is a
geographic information system released under the
GNU General Public License (GPL). 
GRASS is being developed for the GNU/Linux, Mac OS/X, and Windows
operating systems. 
GRASS development is split into stable and 
development branches. The first one is recommended for most
users.</p>

<p>
GRASS is capable of data management, image processing,
graphics production, spatial modeling, and visualization of many
types of data. It's an official project of the Open Source Geospatial
Foundation (<a
href="http://www.osgeo.org/">http://www.osgeo.org/</a>).</p>

<p>
GRASS was originally developed by the U.S. Army Construction Engineering
Research Laboratories (USA-CERL) as a tool for land management and
environmental planning by the military.  From 1982 to 1995, USA-CERL led
the development of GRASS, with the involvement of numerous others,
including universities and other federal agencies.
</p>

<p>
In 1995, the software's development was taken over by a group
formed at Baylor University. In this period, the package was ported to 
Linux. In 1998, Markus Neteler, current project leader,
announced the release of GRASS 4.2.1, offering major improvements
including a new graphical user interface. In October 1999, the license
of the originally public-domain GRASS software was changed to GNU
GPL (specifically, starting with GRASS v. 5.0). Users interested in 
additional historical background can
look at <a
href="http://grass.osgeo.org/devel/grasshist.html">http://grass.osgeo.org/devel/grasshist.html</a>.</p> 

<p>GRASS has now evolved into a powerful utility, with a wide range of
applications. It is currently used in academic institutions and commercial
companies around the world, as well as many governmental agencies and
environmental consulting companies.  
</p>

<h3>1.1 Basic features and documentation</h3>

<p>Upon starting GRASS, the user is presented with a Unix shell containing
a modified environment supporting execution of GRASS commands (known as
<em>modules</em>).  Users can also interface with the majority of GRASS
modules and capabilities through a graphical user interface (GUI).  There
are over 200 core GRASS modules included, and over 100 add-on modules
contributed by users and offered on the GRASS Web site. The GRASS libraries
and core modules are in C, while other modules are in C, Unix shell, Tcl,
or other scripting languages.
</p>

<p>Data managed by GRASS can be roughly divided into  <em>geometric</em>
and <em>attribute</em> data. In the first case, there are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Raster data</em>. Data continuously spread in space, 
structured in a matrix of quadratic cells. Each cell gets an attribute
(e.g., temperature, humidity, height, land use code, etc.) Remote
sensing (e.g., infrared images of aerial operations) and
satellite photographs are classical examples. Raster data 
are not associated with neighborhood relationships because
each pixel is defined by itself.</li>
<li><em>Vector data</em>. Used for storage of information about lines and
homogeneous areas defined by closed lines. A
line connects two end points, identified by their
coordinates. State boundaries are an example of such data. Each vector
object can be associated with several attributes.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Attribute data are attributes interconnected with the data types
mentioned above. For example, a vector layer representing countries
boundaries can be associated with data concerning state population, country
identification code, etc.  Data are usually saved within GIS or in a
database system coupled with GIS.</p>


<p>GRASS supports an extensive range of raster and vector formats through
binding to <a href="http://www.gdal.org/">GDAL/OGR libraries</a>. GRASS
release 6 introduces a new topological 2D/3D vector engine, and support for
vector network analysis. Attributes are usually managed in .dbf database
files, although other DBMSes can be used. The system is capable of
visualizing 3D vector graphics data.  
</p>  

<p>A huge amount of information, documentation, and other resources are
available for GRASS. The documentation includes a very useful internal help
system, a <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/faq/index.html">FAQ list</a>, and
a number of textbooks. In addition to the textbooks (<a
href="http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/books.php">http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/books.php</a>),
the <a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/index.php">GRASS documentation Web
page</a> also hosts various user-contributed documentation, such as
tutorials and courses (<a
href="http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/tutorials.php">http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/tutorials.php</a>)
as well as manuals (<a
href="http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/manuals.php">http://grass.osgeo.org/gdp/manuals.php</a>).
</p>

<p>Other GIS software is available, both open source and proprietary.
Among the former, GRASS is the most widely used, especially for academic
research. As for commercial products, the ArcInfo workstation from
ESRI and Mapinfo Professional from PitneyBowes Mapinfo are the market
leaders. The license price is 9,000-15,000 USD (depending on features)
for ArcInfo and about 1,700 USD for Mapinfo. Both programs have been
developed for Windows, GNU/Linux, and Unix operating systems but lack 
support for Mac OS/X.</p> 

<h3>1.2 Installing GRASS</h3>

<p>The latest version can be found at the
<a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/download/index.php">GRASS download
page</a>. Here, you can find precompiled binaries for several platforms
as well as the source code.</p>

<p>Installation from source requires at least two extra libraries: PROJ4
for management of projections and GDAL/OGR for reading and writing various
GIS data formats. These libraries must be installed in the right order,
before installing GRASS.</p>

<p>The first step is to download PROJ4 from <a
href="http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/">http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/</a>.  The
latest version of the library is 4.6.0. The installation
procedure is straightforward:</p>

<pre class="code">
tar zxf proj-4.6.0.tar.gz
cd proj-4.6.0/
./configure
make
make install
</pre>

<p> 
This library allows management of map projections, which are any
method used in cartography to represent the two-dimensional curved surface
of the Earth or another body on a plane.  Flat maps could not exist without
map projections, because a sphere cannot be laid flat over a plane without
distortions.  To run a GIS package, some details about this topic are
required. Some basic elements are given in the following:  
</p>

<p>The second step is installing the GDAL/OGR library combination. The 
latest version
(1.5.2) can be downloaded from <a
href="http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/">http://download.osgeo.org/gdal</a>.
The install procedure is, again, the usual one:</p>

<pre class="code">
tar zxf gdal-1.5.2.tar.gz
cd gdal-1.5.2/
./configure
make
make install
</pre>

<p>GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data, while the OGR
library (which lives within the GDAL source tree) provides a similar
capability for simple-features vector data. 
These libraries allow import and exchange of files between
different GIS programs.</p>

<p>Finally, GRASS can be installed. The last stable version of the
software (currently 6.2.3) is located at the <a
href="http://grass.osgeo.org/download/index.php">GRASS download
page</a>. The software is installed by the now-familiar method:</p>  

<pre class="code">
tar zxf grass-6.2.3.tar.gz
cd grass-6.2.3/
./configure
make
make install
</pre>

<h3>1.3 Running GRASS</h3>

<p> As a first step, the user is required to create a directory (GRASS
database) that will hold the GRASS data. A usual choice is to create a
directory named 'GRASS' (or 'grassdata') in the user's HOME directory.  </p>

<p>
A subdirectory tree, named <em>location</em>, is automatically created in the
GRASS database for each defined project region. All project data are saved
in the location subdirectory. The location can be further subdivided into
map subdirectories called <em>mapsets</em>.
</p>

<p>
All general information about the project area is stored within the
location in the PERMANENT mapset, which is automatically generated by
GRASS. A user can create one or several mapsets for a given location. They
can have the extent of the whole project or smaller.   This characteristic
makes it possible to have several users working on one project at the same
time, without the risk of destroying each other's data.  Other
information about the tree structure of a location can be found, for
example, at <a
href="http://www.gdf-hannover.de/lit_html/grass60_v1.2_en/node10.html">http://www.gdf-hannover.de/lit_html/grass60_v1.2_en/node10.html</a>.  
</p> 


<p>GRASS can then be started by typing the following at the shell
prompt:</p>

<pre class="code">
grass62
</pre>

<p>The program opens a modified shell and displays the following
text:</p>

<pre>
WELCOME TO GRASS              Version 6.2.3         2007

   1) Have at your side all available GRASS tutorials

   2) When working on your location, the following materials
      are extremely useful:
      - A topo map of your area
      - Current catalog of available computer maps

   3) Check the GRASS Web pages for feedback mailing lists and more:
      http://grass.itc.it/
      http://grass.ibiblio.edu/

Hit RETURN to continue
</pre>

<p>After the user presses Enter, GRASS displays a graphical window from which
one can choose the location and the mapset to open, as in the
following figure:</p> 

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/grass-welcome.jpg" alt="GRASS" width="552" height="586">

<p>From this window, one can read two important pieces of data:</p>

<ul>
<li>The database directory of the software (e.g., /home/matt/GRASS) where
all the GIS data reside.</li>
<li>The available locations in the database directory. In this case,
there are 4 locations. </li> 
</ul>

<p>
Besides choosing a defined location, it is also possible to create a new
location in three different ways. These methods differ in the amounts of
information required of the user. The simplest case occurs when
data about the location are self-contained in the imported map
(geo-referenced file); in these cases, no other information is needed. 
</p>


<p>The definition of a new location requires input (directly by
the user or indirectly from a map) of the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the coordinate system for the location;</li> 
<li>the minimum and maximum coordinates of the area of interest; and</li>
<li>the ground resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p>These settings are critical for correct display and management of
the location. Therefore, before going further, it's worthwhile to introduce
some theoretical information about projections and coordinate systems.</p> 

<h3>1.4 Excursus: projections and coordinate systems</h3>

<p>
In a GIS, the information is stored with coordinates; therefore, a
coordinate system has to be specified.  For geographical data, the
geographic system (the well known <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude">latitude</a> and  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude">longitude</a>) or a geodetic
projection like Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) or Gauss-Kr&uuml;ger
are the usual choices.
</p>
  
<p>
The UTM coordinate system is a grid-based method of specifying locations
on the surface of the Earth. It differs from the traditional method of
latitude and longitude in several respects. The Gauss-Kr&uuml;ger system is
similar to the UTM system with only small differences. More details on
these coordinate systems can be found in further readings listed in the
final section.
</p> 

<p>
To optimize the projection from the geoid into a flat map, the Earth is
approximated by an ellipsoid.</p> 

<p>Different projections are used because each projection is particularly
appropriate for certain uses or areas. For example, a projection that
accurately represents the shapes of the continents will distort their
relative sizes.  GRASS offers predefined projections, as well as the
geographic system and the possibility to define a geodetic projection by
yourself.  In this last case, the projection type, the ellipsoid and the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datum_(geodesy)">datum</a> (a reference
from which measurements are made) for referencing the ellipsoid have to be
specified.  </p>
 

<h3>1.5 Creating a location: the quest for data</h3>

<p>
The best way to appreciate the functionality of GRASS is to see it
in action on a real case-study. As a first step, let us introduce the
usual question that worries every new user: "Well, I have just
installed this wonderful software, and I have some geo-referenced
data to analyze and relate to geophysical characteristics of my
research area. But what about geophysical maps? Where can I get
them? What kinds of thematic data are available for my region of
interest?"
</p>

<p> 
The answer obviously depends on the analysis you have planned, and
on the geographic region of interest. Some frequently desired thematic
maps are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elevation data</li>
<li>Landsat data</li>
<li>Land use data</li>
<li>Climatological data</li>
<li>State boundaries</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us state clearly that, if you are interested in a very specific
and very high resolution map, your only hope is to find this resource
for a fee (usually substantially high) from a local agency. Sometimes,
these data are distributed in electronic format; otherwise, you have to
scan them from the hardcopy, yourself.
</p>

<p>
If you are instead interested in large-region medium resolution (30 -
100 m) maps, the Net hosts several amazing resources you should use.      
In the following section, we describe Net sources where this information is
available for free download, and how to import them into GRASS.</p>

<h3>2. Elevation data</h3>

<p>The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) obtained elevation data on a
near-global scale to generate the most complete high-resolution digital
topographic database of Earth.  SRTM consisted of a specially modified
radar system flown onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor during an 11-day
mission in February of 2000.  The SRTM data are available as 3 arc second
(90m resolution). 1 arc second data are available for US.  The Global Land
Cover Facility provides free access to the data (<a
href="http://glcfapp.umiacs.umd.edu:8080/esdi/">http://glcfapp.umiacs.umd.edu:8080/esdi/</a>).)
The data contains "holes" where water or heavy shadow prevented the
evaluation of elevation.</p> 

<p>In the following example we show how to obtain elevation data
for Tuscany (Central Italy), where we currently live.
</p>

<p>
Data gathering starts by connecting to the <a
href="http://glcfapp.umiacs.umd.edu:8080/esdi/">Global Land Cover
Facility</a> Web page. In the page, the three ways in which you can access
the data (Map Search, Path/Row Search, Product Search) are displayed. Let
us choose the first, Map search: the user must choose the desired product
in the left panel and select the world region of interest (map on the
right). Since we are interested in elevation data, we can choose one among
the four available options.  Note that GTOPO30 is a global digital
elevation model with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc seconds, so about
ten times less accurate than SRTM data.  The first two options are
different ways to access the SRTM dataset: the first one allows download of
tiles of 1 degree square, while the second accesses WRS-2 tiles to
approximate Landsat scenes, which we will introduce in the next paragraph.
For reasons that will become clear, we choose to select this second option.
</p>

<p>Now, we have to select the geographic region of interest, by clicking on
the place panel, just above the world map. In the displayed text box type
"Toscana, Italy" and press Enter. (In general, you type "Location, State".)
You should then see a page similar to the one displayed in the figure.</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/srtm.jpg" alt="srtm-1" width="600" height="420"> 

<p>There are 35 maps available in the selection. The next step is to
select the ones of interest. Having pressed the button "Preview &amp;
Download", the selection window is displayed. It looks like the
figure below:</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/srtm2.jpg" alt="srtm-2" width="650" height="364"> 
   
<p>The screen is divided into two zones. In the lower one available maps are
listed, with their associated information. In particular, you can see the
type of data (GeoTIFF format, a widely used raster format), the status
(unfinished, unfilled, finished-a, and finished-b in ascending order
of processing level and of our choice).  In the third column, there are
data which allow the identification of path/row attributes, used for 
Landsat satellite data. The user can select a map by clicking on its ID (first
column). In the upper area, information about the selected map is
shown. In the right part, the user can check which zone is covered by
the map. This picture can guide the selection of really interesting maps.
After identification of a desired map, the user should press the download
button, and download the .tif.gz file from the window that will open.  </p> 

<p>At the end of the scan, you will find that only four maps are required
for download: ID 180-332 (path/row: 191/030), ID 180-364 (192/029), ID
180-365 (192/030), and ID 180-408 (193/029). These files can be saved in a
directory, e.g., $HOME/SRTM, and uncompressed.  </p>

<h3>2.1 Importing a raster map</h3>

<p>GeoTIFF files incorporate information about the coordinate system, the
projection, and the datum used for their georeferencing. In this way, it is
possible to use them to define a new GRASS location, and subsequently
import them into the software. </p>

<p> The process is a little tedious. From the start page of GRASS
(displayed in the first figure of this article), define a new location by
pressing the button "Georeferenced file". In the window that will open,
insert the name of the new location (e.g., "tuscany"), and, in the last one,
select the path to one of the four downloaded files (e.g.,
SRTM_ffB03_p192r029.tif). End the location definition by pressing "Define
location". GRASS generates the tree for the new location, and displays a
warning requesting to close the program.</p> 

<p>At the restart, you will be able to see your first new generated
location!</p>

<p>Select the location tuscany, and the mapset PERMANENT, then click
on "Enter GRASS". The shell will display the following greeting
message:</p>

<pre>
Welcome to GRASS 6.2.3 (2007) 
GRASS homepage:                          http://grass.itc.it/
This version running thru:               TC Shell (/bin/tcsh)
Help is available with the command:      g.manual -i
See the licence terms with:              g.version -c
If required, restart the graphical user interface with: gis.m &amp;
When ready to quit enter:                exit

Mapset &lt;PERMANENT&gt; in Location &lt;tuscany&gt;
GRASS 6.2.3 &gt; 
</pre>

<p>Besides that, three more windows will open: the GUI (window GRASS
6.2.3 GIS Manager), the output window which will host the output of
all commands issued by means of GUI, and the map display window.<br>

At this point, the Tuscany location is created, but it hosts no
data. Importation of the four downloaded maps can be performed either
by shell command or by GUI. We illustrate first this second approach,
since it will also show the shell command associated with the GUI
procedure.</p>

<p>
From the GUI menu bar, select File / Import / Raster map / Multiple
formats using GDAL. Fill in the form that will open, as in the following
figure:</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/r-in-gdal.png" alt="r-in-gdal" width="529" height="572"> 

<p>The only required fields are the name of input file and the output
name, i.e., the internal name GRASS associates to this map. The box
"Extend location extents based on new datasat" will extend the
location to encompass the imported map.</p>

<p> In the window's last line, the shell command associated with the
import operation gets displayed. Its structure is really simple, and makes it
faster to import the other maps from the shell. At the shell prompt, insert
these commands:</p>

<pre class="code">
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/SRTM/SRTM_ffB03_p192r030.tif output=192_030
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/SRTM/SRTM_ffB03_p193r029.tif output=193_029
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, trying to import the fourth map, you receive an error:</p>

<pre class="code">
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/SRTM/SRTM_ffB03_p191r030.tif output=191_030

ERROR: Projection of dataset does not appear to match current location.
</pre>

<p>What is happening? The answer is simple, as is the solution. The
projection information associated with this map is different from the those
of the three imported maps. The simpler solution is to import the map in a
new location (say, "tuscany2"), which will be created ad-hoc, and then
reproject the data in the current location. The first step is accomplished
by adding a <em>location</em> parameter to <i>r.in.gdal</i>:

<pre class="code">
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/SRTM/SRTM_ffB03_p191r030.tif output=191_030 location=tuscany2
</pre>

<p> Since a map's projection does not extend the region boundaries on the
fly, you have to be certain that your region is large enough to contain the
projected map. In this case, this is false, because the fourth map is
partially outside the east boundary. You have to manually adjust this
boundary with the command <em>g.region</em> (Config / Region / Change
region settings from GUI), and then reproject (Raster / Develop map /
Reproject raster from other location from GUI).</p>

<p> Which value has to be set as the east boundary? To make an educated
guess, it is better to look at the coordinates of one of the imported maps.
You can do it by setting the boundaries of the location to match one of the
maps and then extrapolate where the fourth map will be located. For example:

<pre class="code">
g.region rast=192_029

g.region -p
</pre>

<p>The first command sets the location's boundaries 
to those of map 192_029. The second one queries all of the location's 
parameters; from its output, we can learn several
things, such as coordinate system, projection, datum, and
coordinates of the boundaries (Config / Region / Display region
settings from GUI): </p>

<pre>
projection: 1 (UTM)
zone:       32
datum:      wgs84
ellipsoid:  a=6378137 es=0.00669437999014138
north:      5065399.56462278
south:      4821139.56462278
west:       576236.63839707
east:       828866.63839707
nsres:      90
ewres:      90
rows:       2714
cols:       2807
cells:      7618198
</pre> 

<p>In the output above, the measures are in meters.
Now it is possible to set the eastern boundary:
</p>

<pre class="code">
g.region e=968866
</pre>

<p>And reproject the map in the current location:</p>

<pre class="code">
r.proj input=191_030 location=tuscany2 output=191_030 method=nearest
</pre>

<p>
The syntax of <em>r.proj</em> is self explanatory. The option
<em>method</em> chose the interpolation algorithm to be used. (Note: if you
set an incorrect east boundary, and you have to reproject the map, you
must add the flag --overwrite at the end of command <em>r.proj</em>.)</p>

<h3>2.2 Displaying and patching raster maps</h3>

<p>It is time to see some output from GRASS! Let us display one of the
imported maps, say, 192_029.  This is done by using the GUI and pressing
the "Add raster layer" button <img src="misc/dellomodarme/GUI-rast.png"
alt="GUI-rast" width="23" height="23">.</p>

<p>A new empty raster layer is then added for visualization in the upper
part of the GUI window. By clicking on the name of the layer, you cause 
the lower part of the window to display a form. Here, you can define
which map is associated with the layer. Press on the Base map button, and
select the map from the list that is then shown. At the end of the
procedure, the GUI should look like this:</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/GUI-layer-rast.png" alt="GUI-layer-rast" width="493"
height="508">   

<p>You should now admire the results of your work. In the Map display
window, press the "Display active layer" button (the first one). The window
will probably remain empty. In this case, we have to set the zoom of the
displaying window to the one of the region boundaries (which we set in the
previous paragraph). You should press on the button "Zoom to..." <img
src="misc/dellomodarme/zoom.png" alt="zoom" width="23" height="23">, and
select the option "Zoom to current region" as shown in the figure:</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/GUI-raster-1st.jpg" alt="GUI-rast"
width="550" height="482">   

<p>The displayed map should look almost red, with the exception of a few
yellow areas, which correspond to the no-data zones.  A useful instrument
available from the Map Display window is the query button <img
src="misc/dellomodarme/query.png" alt="query" width="23" height="23">.
Select it and then press over the map; the value associated to the cell is
shown in the output window. You will discover that, for example, no-data
areas are represented by value -32768.  </p>

     
<p>Now it's map-cleaning time! We have to patch the four maps to obtain a
new composite map. Before that, we have to clean up the maps. In fact, GRASS
expects that no data zones will be identified by a NULL value, while, as we
know, SRTM maps identifies no-data areas with the code -32768. The
following commands correct this problem (Raster / Develop map / Manage null
values from GUI):</p>

<pre class="code">
r.null map=191_030 setnull=-32768
r.null map=192_029 setnull=-32768
r.null map=192_030 setnull=-32768
r.null map=193_029 setnull=-32768
</pre>

<p>The next step is definition of the correct location boundaries.
GRASS can make boundaries from a series of maps. We use this
characteristic by issuing the command:</p>

<pre class="code">
g.region rast=191_030,192_029,192_030,193_029
</pre> 

<p>The resulting boundaries just encompass the four maps.</p>
 
<p>As our last step, we can merge the maps, and define an appropriate
colormap:</p>
<pre class="code">
r.patch in=191_030,192_029,192_030,193_029 output=elev
r.colors map=elev rules=srtm
</pre>

<p>The command <em>r.patch</em> (Raster / Overlay maps / Patch maps from GUI)
creates a new map, named <em>elev</em>, by merging the four existing ones,
while <em>r.colors</em> (Raster / Manage map colors / Set colors to
predefined color tables from GUI) defines a colormap using an appropriate
predefined ruleset (srtm).</p>  

<p>To correctly visualize the map, we have to restart GRASS after having
closed the session by entering <em>exit</em> at the shell prompt, and closing
the window manager.  After having restarted the software, we can display
the final result of our work: repeat the procedure used for displaying a
raster layer and select the map elev.  The map should look like this
one:</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/tuscany.jpg" alt="tuscany" width="600"
height="526"> 

<p>If the result is satisfactory, you can delete the four small maps.  From 
the GUI, the path is "File / Manage maps and volumes / Remove maps"
and fill the raster field with the name of the maps to delete.  From the shell,
type:</p> 

<pre class="code">
g.remove rast=191_030,192_029,192_030,193_029
</pre>

<p>At the end of this section, we have created an elevation map for the
Central Italy area. We will later extract from it the data related to
the Tuscany region, and discard the rest.</p> 

<p>As a final note, since the coverage of SRTM data is worldwide, the
procedure can be repeated for any location.</p>


<h3>3. Landsat data</h3>

<p>Landsat-7 is a satellite launched on April 1999. It has
sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit that allows it to record the surface of
the Earth in a pattern of overlapping 185 km swaths, completing one scan
every 233 orbits. The pattern is catalogued as a tiled global grid of 233
paths and 248 rows in the so called Worldwide Referencing System (WRS). We
have seen an example of this reference system when downloading SRTM
data.</p>

<p>The satellite is equipped with an instrument called the Enhanced Thematic
Mapper (ETM+), a multi-spectral radiometric sensor.  The sensor records
eight bands of data with varying spectral and spatial resolutions (30 m
spatial resolution for red, green, blue, near infrared, and two bands of
medium infrared; 60 m for thermal infrared; and a 15 m panchromatic band).
A list of the bands with their spanned wavelength (in micrometers) is given
below:</p> 

<ol>
<li>Blue-Green: 0.45-0.515 &mu;m</li>
<li>Green: 0.525-0.605 &mu;m</li>
<li>Red: 0.63-0.690  &mu;m</li>
<li>Near infrared: 0.760-0.900 &mu;m</li>
<li>Medium infrared:  1.550-1.750 &mu;m</li>
<li>Thermal: 10.40-12.5  &mu;m</li>
<li>Medium infrared: 2.080-2.35  &mu;m</li>
<li>Panchromatic: 0.52-0.92 &mu;m</li>
</ol>


<p>Landsat data are available from many sources. During April 2008, all data
gathered by the satellite were released into the public domain, so it is
possible to download scenes acquired in different months and different
years. (See <a
href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/products_data_at_no_charge.php">http://landsat.usgs.gov/products_data_at_no_charge.php</a>
for details.) We will show here a simpler method of download, limited at
one dataset acquired in the years 2000-2001, available at the <a
href="http://glcfapp.umiacs.umd.edu:8080/esdi/">Global Land Cover
Facility</a> Web page. Data gathering procedure is identical to that
described in the previous section. The user must select the right
product by checking the ETM+ box in the interface shown in second figure of
this document.</p> 

<p>The result should be similar to the figure below:</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/landsat.jpg" alt="landsat" width="650" height="343">

<p>The same path/row maps downloaded for elevation data are required; this
correspondence greatly accelerates the user choice. In this case, the map IDs
are: ID 036-387, ID 036-429, ID 036-430, and ID 036-128.</p> 

<p> By pressing the download button, you can see that the data are available
as a set of eight GeoTIFF files (one for each ETM+ band). They are much
bigger than SRTM data, since the resolution is about three times as great.
You can download whatever band you desire.</p>

<p> Landsat data can be used to assess the type, extent, and condition of
vegetation over a region, or vegetative change over time.  These studies
require that a vegetative index be calculated from sets of
remotely-sensed data. The most widely used index is the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDVI">Normalized Difference Vegetative
Index</a> (NDVI). The NDVI is calculated as a ratio between measured
reflectivity in the red and near-infrared portions of the electromagnetic
spectrum. These two spectral bands are chosen because they are affected by
the absorption of chlorophyll in leafy green vegetation and by the density
of the green vegetation on the surface. Moreover, in red and near-infrared
bands, the contrast between vegetation and soil is at a maximum.</p> 

<p>ETM+ bands 3 and 4 provide red and near-infrared measurements, and
therefore can be used to generate NDVI data sets with the following
formula:</p> 
<pre>
NDVI = (Band 4 - Band 3) / (Band 4 + Band 3)
</pre>

<p>The NDVI equation produces values in the range of -1.0 to 1.0.
Vegetated areas will typically have values greater than zero, and negative
values indicate non-vegetated surface features such as barren, water, ice,
snow, or clouds.  NDVI value are usually scaled for display, as is the
following equation:</p> 

<pre>
Scaled NDVI = 100 (NDVI + 1)
</pre>


<h3>3.1 Making a raster map from existing ones</h3>

<p>To evaluate the NDVI index for Tuscany, we have to download bands 3 and
4.  These files can be saved in a directory, say, $HOME/Landsat, and
uncompressed. </p>

<p>In order to preserve the projection values of Landsat data, the data can
then be imported in a new location, e.g., landsat, in order to preserve the
projection values of Landsat data. As shown in the preceding section, the
command (dataset 193/29, band 4) is:</p>  

<pre class="code">
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/GIS/Landsat/p193r029_7t20010801_z32_nn40.tif output=193_29_4 location=landsat
</pre>

<p>Restart GRASS, enter the new defined location, mapset PERMANENT,
and finish the import:</p>
<pre class="code">
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/GIS/Landsat/p193r029_7t20010801_z32_nn30.tif output=193_29_3

r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/GIS/Landsat/p192r029_7t20000620_z32_nn40.tif output=192_29_4
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/GIS/Landsat/p192r029_7t20000620_z32_nn30.tif output=192_29_3

r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/GIS/Landsat/p192r030_7t20000620_z32_nn40.tif output=192_30_4
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/GIS/Landsat/p192r030_7t20000620_z32_nn30.tif output=192_30_3
</pre>

<p>As seen previously, map 191/30 has a different projection, so you have to
read that map in a new location (one for each map), extend the region
boundaries, and reproject the maps in the current location:</p>

<pre class="code">
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/GIS/Landsat/p191r030_7t20010803_z33_nn40.tif output=191_30_4 location=landsat2
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/GIS/Landsat/p191r030_7t20010803_z33_nn30.tif output=191_30_3 location=landsat2b

g.region e=968866

r.proj input=191_30_4 location=landsat2 output=191_30_4 method=nearest 
r.proj input=191_30_3 location=landsat2b output=191_30_3 method=nearest 
</pre>

<p>As a last step, we can patch the maps together. Since, in this case, null
values are represented by zeroes we can skip the <em>r.null</em> call by
adding a <em>-z</em> flag to <em>r.patch</em>:</p>

<pre class="code">
r.patch -z in=192_29_4,192_30_4,193_29_4,191_30_4 output=Landsat_B4
r.patch -z in=192_29_3,192_30_3,193_29_3,191_30_3 output=Landsat_B3
</pre>

<p>Now, all the elements for NDVI calculation are on hand. It is time
to learn how to make a new map starting from existing ones!
</p>

<p>
The best approach is to use the shell command <em>r.mapcalc</em>:
</p>

<pre class="code">
r.mapcalc "NDVI=(float(Landsat_B4 - Landsat_B3) / (Landsat_B4 + Landsat_B3) + 1)*100"
</pre>

<p>To obtain a floating point division (the Landsat maps are integer maps),
the float function is required. The command makes a new map, called NDVI,
by operating, cell by cell, on the values in maps Landsat_B3 and
Landsat_B4.</p>

<p>Finally, you should reproject the NDVI map into the tuscany location. To
do that, exit from GRASS session, restart the program, and login into the
tuscany location. Then issue the command:</p>

<pre class="code">
r.proj input=NDVI location=landsat output=NDVI
</pre>

<p>If no problem arises, you will have two raster maps in this location. To
recover disk space, all other locations can be erased. This can be done by
exiting GRASS, changing directory to $HOME/GRASS, and deleting the
directories tuscany2, landsat, landsat2, and landsat2b. The resulting map
will be shown in the next section, once having learned how to "mask" it in
order to show only the pixels of Tuscany.</p> 

<p>As for SRTM data, Landsat data also is worldwide, so you can repeat
the procedure for any location on the Earth.</p>

<h3>4. Getting state and districts' boundaries</h3>

<p>States', districts' and municipalities' boundaries can be retrieved from
several sources, depending on the region of interest. In the case of
Italian regions, for example, these are available from the <a
href="http://www.istat.it/ambiente/cartografia/">ISTAT</a> Web site (in
Italian). The file of interest (<a
href="http://www.istat.it/ambiente/cartografia/regioni.zip">regioni</a>)
can be downloaded from the right panel.  This file contains Italy's regional
boundaries.
</p>

<h3>4.1 Managing a vector map</h3>

<p>Download the file into a new directory, e.g., $HOME/IT, then unzip
it. The content of the archive consists of several files, one of
which is a .shp file, a widely used vector type of data.</p>

<p>To read this type of data into GRASS, proceed in this way. Start
GRASS in the tuscany location, then issue the command (File / Import /
Vector map / Various formats using OGR from GUI):</p>
<pre class="code">
v.in.ogr -e dsn=/home/matt/IT/reg2001_s.shp output=reg_boundaries min_area=0.0001 snap=-1 location=italy_reg
</pre>

<p>The import requires the specification of a datum transformation
parameter. At the prompt, you can select parameter 8, valid for whole
European area.  At the end, you will have a new location, named italy_reg,
which will contain a vector map named reg_boundaries.</p>

<p>Now, logout from the GRASS session and restart in the newly created
location. The acquired vector map contains political boundaries of all the
Italian regions. For our example, only the Tuscany region is of interest, so
we have to extract an element from a map. For a vector map, this is a quite
simple operation, since it is equivalent to extracting records from a
database through a query. </p>

<p>To do the extraction, we should first learn how to inspect the database
associated with a vector map. This can be easily done in the GUI. Vector
layers are added to the display layer, in a fashion similar to the raster
layers. The only change is that users have to press the "Add vector
layer" button <img src="misc/dellomodarme/GUI-vect.png" alt="GUI-vect" width="23"
height="23">. </p>

<p>Select the added layer in the top part of the GUI window. In the bottom
part, which will become available, choose the vector map you want to
display, using the "Vector map" text field or the corresponding button.
There are many more options for vector maps than for raster maps. For now,
we are interested in the two buttons located at the end of the list. Scroll
down the window, and you should see the buttons "show attribute columns"
and "show attribute data". </p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/GUI-vector.png" alt="GUI-vector" width="505" height="605">

<p>These buttons access the database linked to the map and return,
respectively, the names of the database columns and the contents of the whole
database, as shown in the next figure where these outputs are displayed.
Note that each output is prefaced by the command forwarded from the
GUI to the shell interpreter.</p>  

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/vector-db-out.png" alt="vector-db" width="562" height="465">

<p>The database contains four columns: a key used to index the
table, the code of the regions, their names and their populations as 
recorded in 2001. The region code could be used for extraction of
Tuscany. You can do that typing the command:</p> 

<pre class="code">
v.extract in=reg_boundaries out=tuscany_boundaries new=-1 where="COD_REG=9"
</pre>

<p>The map tuscany_boundaries will be created. The option
<em>new=-1</em> preserves the database table, exporting it in the new
map.</p>
 
<h3>4.2 Vector to raster conversion</h3>
 
<p>Before exiting and connecting again in the tuscany location, we'll
demonstrate how to convert a vector map to a raster one. This step will
create a silhouette of the Tuscany region, which will later help us to
"cut" the map of elevation and NDVI to the required extent.  The resolution
of the vector map is much lower than the one of the tuscany location (check
it yourself: <em>g.region -p</em>). So, we increase the resolution and then
convert the vector map:</p>

<pre class="code">
g.region nsres=90
g.region ewres=90

v.to.rast input=tuscany_boundaries output=MASK use=val
</pre>

<p>This command makes the map MASK (a reserved map name), assigning to all
cells the same value (option <em>use=val</em>). When a raster map named MASK
exists in a location, most raster operations (on any raster map) will
take place only in the grid cells specified by the MASK.</p> 

<p>Now, restart GRASS, and access the tuscany location. Then, reproject the
vector and the raster maps from italy_reg:</p> 
<pre class="code">
v.proj input=tuscany_boundaries location=italy_reg output=tuscany_boundaries

r.proj input=MASK location=italy_reg output=MASK
</pre>

<p>If we try to display the elev raster map, as we did before, the result is
different. The elev map is masked, and only cells from Tuscany will be
shown. The same behaviour occurs for NDVI map. The two maps are shown in
the following figure (NDVI on the left, elevation on the right).</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/NDVI-elev.jpg" alt="NDVI-elev" width="573" height="313">

 
<h3>5. Land cover map</h3>

<p>Land cover data are available from different sources, depending on the
region of your interest. For European countries, you can refer to Corine
Land Cover (CLC). CLC is a map of the European environmental landscape
based on interpretation of satellite images; it provides comparable digital
maps of land cover for each country for much of Europe, and includes 47
classes of land cover. Data on land cover is necessary for environmental
policy, regional development, and agriculture policies.</p>

<p>Corine Land Cover 2000 data can be downloaded at 100 m horizontal
resolution in raster format (GeoTIFF) from the European Environmental
Agency Web site (<a
href="http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/dataservice/metadetails.asp?id=1007">http://dataservice.eea.europa.eu/dataservice/metadetails.asp?id=1007</a>).
Users are required to complete the "Agreement form for Corine Land Cover
2000", which is shown before
download. In this way, you can download the whole European area
contained in the file lceugr100_00EEA17938I.zip (approx 66MB).
The download page is shown in the following figure. 
In the same page, you will find the file (four formats are available)
containing the legend for interpretation of the map. 
</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/corine2000.png" alt="corine-download" width="650"
height="250">

<p>There is also the possibility of downloading data in vector
format (shapefile .shp), selecting on a
grid only the region of interest (see <a
href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/landuse/clc-download"> 
http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/landuse/clc-download</a>).
</p>

<p>After having downloaded the file into a directory, e.g., $HOME/CLC,
uncompress it; the files will be expanded in a subdirectory named
lceugr100_00. Then start GRASS in the tuscany location and import the data
into the new location (e.g., CLC):</p>
<pre class="code">
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/CLC/lceugr100_00/lceugr100_00_pct.tif output=CLC location=CLC
</pre> 

<p>CLC data can be reprojected in the current location:</p>
<pre class="code">
r.proj input=CLC location=CLC output=CLC method=nearest
</pre> 

<p>The new raster map can be displayed as shown before. The result is
in the following figure; the presence of the raster MASK will cut the
map at the desired boundaries.
</p>

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/clc.jpg" alt="corine" width="499" height="482">

<p>The various areas are depicted in different colors. The legend for
interpretation of the map can be found in the file 
$HOME/CLC/lceugr100_00/clc_legend.xls. From this file you can see
that, for example, CLC code 111 represents Artificial surfaces/Urban
fabric/Continuous urban fabric and is depicted in RGB color 230-0-77,
while code 221 is Agricultural areas/Permanent crops/Vineyards, and its
RGB color is 230-128-0.
</p>

<p>After a successful import of the map, you can recover a lot of disk
space by erasing the location CLC. This is done by exiting GRASS and
deleting the directory $HOME/GRASS/CLC.</p>
  

<h3>5.1 Land cover map of US</h3>

<p>When the research area is within the USA, the user can refer to the
National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001). It is an update of <a
href="http://landcover.usgs.gov/natllandcover.php">NLCD 1992</a>, and
includes 21 classes of land cover at 30 m cell resolution.  The 76 standard
NLCD mapping zones have been grouped into 15 larger zonal areas for easier
distribution and download.  The download site address is <a
href="http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd_multizone_map.php">http://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd_multizone_map.php</a>.
</p> 

<img src="misc/dellomodarme/USA-landcover.jpg" alt="USA landcover" width="650" height="325">

<p>This page also contains a link to a zipped <a
href="http://www.mrlc.gov/mapzone.zip">shapefile</a> (3 MB) with the
standard NLCD zones as well as a multizone attribute.  Download it into
$HOME/US directory, and unzip its content: a subdirectory named
<em>landcover_bndry_030607_shp</em> will be created in the process. There,
along with several other files, you'll find the
<em>landcover_bndry_030607.shp</em> shapefile, which we'll later import
into a new location.</p>

<p>The next step is to download the landcover for the zone of
interest: you have the option to download data
for a state or a superzone. As an example, let us choose the data for
superzone 13 by clicking on it over the displayed US map. In the page that will
open, select the link <em>Land Cover zip file</em>, and save the
associated file <em>area_13_landcover.zip</em> (130 MB) in the directory
$HOME/US, then unzip its content. Among other files, you will see the
raster file <em>landcover13_3k_022007.img</em>, which we are going to
import into GRASS.</p> 

<p>After restarting GRASS in the tuscany location, we can import the
superzone 13 raster data into a new location, i.e., USA:</p>
<pre class="code">
r.in.gdal -e input=/home/matt/US/landcover13_3k_022007.img output=area13 location=USA
</pre>
<p>The import requires specifying the datum transformation parameter. At
the prompt, you can select parameter 6, valid for whole North American
region.</p>

<p>Exit GRASS, and restart in the USA location. Then, import the shapefile
containing the states' boundaries, and extend the location boundaries to
match the ones of the vector map:</p>
<pre class="code">
v.in.ogr -o dsn=/home/matt/US/landcover_bndry_030607.shp output=boundaries min_area=0.0001 snap=-1

g.region vect=boundaries
</pre>

<p>Finally, we can display the resulting map, superimposing the vector
layer to the raster one. To do that, in the GUI, you can start by adding a
raster layer for visualization and selecting the raster map area13. Then,
add a vector layer and select map boundaries. Using the vector layer, you
can display a variety of objects: points, lines, centroids, and areas.  To
display only the boundary lines, deselect checkbox centroids and areas, as
in the figure below.  </p>

button. The zoomed result should look like this:

<h3>6. Climatological data</h3>

<p>Climatological data open a entirely new way of searching for
information. Whereas elevation data can be considered static
(i.e., their value does not change with time), and Landsat and land use
data evolve slowly in time (in fact, you can find research papers
comparing the Landsat situation in various decades to trace the
global climate evolution), climatological data change rapidly. So, the
first question you have to ask yourself is: "What type of data am I
searching for?" You might be interested in daily or even hourly
measurements, or in monthly means, or even in seasonal or yearly means.
Moreover, yearly and seasonal means can be evaluated over a long period
(say, 15 years) to smooth out the fluctuations introduced by a very hot
summer or by a very cold winter.</p>        

<p> The second aspect to be considered is the format in which data are
distributed. The measurements are usually provided in tabular format: the
tables contain the values recorded by a set of meteorological stations
distributed over the region of interest. The main variables recorded are
temperature (minimum, maximum, mean), humidity, and rainfall. Values in places
without meteorological stations can be obtained by the user by
mean of interpolation techniques. This is a difficult process, and requires
a deeper analysis, because it involves either data manipulation (e.g.,
transformation of daily data in the tables to obtain a seasonal mean;
selection of the interesting stations, etc.) or interpolation with
advanced statistical techniques (e.g. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging">universal kriging
interpolation</a>.) This last step can be performed by, for example,
interfacing GRASS with R, a statistical program which we briefly described
in <a href="../138/dellomodarme.html">issue 138</a> of the Linux Gazette.
</p>

<p>Since a detailed description of all these depicted procedures would
be long and complex, we'll postpone it until another article.  
</p>

<h3>Moving further</h3>

<p>
In this long excursus, we have introduced some basic features of the
software, but have neglected almost completely to describe the way in which
data could be analyzed and related to each other. This approach is
motivated by our experience with GRASS. In fact, when we started using this
software, we realized that there are many good tutorials and manuals
describing in great detail all the operations possible with the software -
but we had a great deal of difficulty in finding and acquiring thematic
maps, either because the tutorials are usually focused on a standard
dataset (provided as an example of location data with GRASS) or because the
information we needed was scattered all over the Net.  It is our hope that
the present document will contribute to filling this gap.
</p>

<p>While waiting for our next article, readers seriously interested in the
software can start by browsing the documentation pages available at the 
GRASS Web site, which also hosts some documents in non-English languages.
We recommend the following documents: </p>
