<h1>Freedom from Laptop Lugging or Thin Client with No Server</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/sevenich.html">Dr. Richard Sevenich</A></b></p>

<p class="editorial">
The solution proposed by Dr. Sevenich in this article is an important part
of what I see as the future of computer hardware. At the present time, we
lump several separate hardware resources under the generic label of
"Computer" - but considering them as distinct units that serve a common
purpose can be critical in determining the direction of development.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
Imagine an entire system based on the modular approach in this article:
say, a <a
href="http://crunchgear.com/2006/09/28/cambridge-geniuses-invent-practical-digital-scroll/">roll-up
screen</a> and keyboard, a <a
href="http://www.digi.com/products/embeddedsolutions/digiconnectme.jsp">tiny
CPU module</a> (perhaps as a removable part of the keyboard or display, or
as a part of a modern PDA with appropriate connectors), a touchpad (or a
tiny optical <a
href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/06/fingertip_mouse_for_.html">fingertip
mouse</a>) and a <a
href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10199">60GB USB
drive</a> configured as described below. There's very little volume (and
thus, essentially no problem at the airport), very little weight, the issue
of fragility effectively disappears, and - given components designed to fit
the system - there's no problem in device recognition or configuration.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
The benefits and rewards of producing such an easily configurable, user-serviceable,
fully-mobile computer system are large and obvious - both for the vendor and the
users; the hardware to do this already exists. We can only hope that some
company with the appropriate resources will pick up the challenge and help
bring that future a little closer.<br />

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>
Picture the security line at a major airport. It's long, maybe slow, and
many of the queued people are lugging laptops. Some of the luggers will use
the laptop on the plane; some will stow it overhead or underfoot. Its
virtue is that it provides a portable way to transport your work
environment with you, including Internet access. The problem is that the
laptop is an expensive, relatively heavy, relatively bulky, and vulnerable
piece of technology - with limited battery life. There are various
solutions to this problem, but none have so far been viable/convenient
enough to persuade the laptop luggers to change their ways.
</p>


<h3>The Solution is at Hand</h3>

<p>
We'll advance a solution here that uses pieces of existing technology,
but pieces that are not yet deployed together with this problem in mind. The
solution would seem to present an entrepreneurial opportunity and have
other follow-on benefits. The elements of the solution are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a bootable USB micro-drive or mass storage flash memory device,</li>
  <li>a computer with display, mouse, keyboard, USB port, and Internet
	connectivity - this computer can boot the USB micro-drive, and</li>
  <li>a boot up software system on the USB device rather like that on a liveCD.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's discuss each of these elements assuming that the operating system
is Linux. It could also be done with other operating systems, but for
something like Microsoft Windows it might require the proprietary
software vendor to change, or at least rethink, their licensing and
business models. In contrast, the fluid, adjustable, and unconstrained
Linux business model allows an entrepreneur to be more agile.
</p>


<h4>Bootable USB Device</h4>

<p>
We can easily find examples on the Internet where a USB device has been configured to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>be bootable,</li>
  <li>contain a compressed Linux kernel which is expanded and placed in RAM
	at startup,</li>
  <li>contain a read/write root file system.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In short, it works just like a typical hard drive. Some liveCD
implementations can install a bootable Linux to a USB device (e.g. the
Ubuntu family.)
</p>

<p>
These devices are quite small - i.e., the average flash device or
microdrive can easily fit in the palm of your hand - but possess
significant storage capacity. For example, at this writing I can go to the
local shopping mall and purchase an 8GB USB micro-drive for a cost of
about 100USD. Lastly, they do not require their own power supplies, because
they can be powered directly from a USB port.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, this is what we want the laptop luggers to lug instead of their
laptops. Note as well that it is relatively easy to back up the contents
of the whole USB device onto a second inexpensive USB device or other
external backup media.
</p>

<h4>The Computer</h4>

<p>
The computer needs to have reasonably standard devices for which Linux
device drivers exist. The entrepreneur implementing this solution would be
wise to choose devices whose source code is in the kernel tree, avoiding
binary-only drivers.  This would satisfy the needs of all users and
constitute a less brittle and more easily maintained product.
</p>

<p>
The computer needs a BIOS, or equivalent bootloader, that is configured
to boot from our USB device. It does not need its own hard drive - it's
essentially a Thin Client with No Server (TCNS). On the other hand, if
it is an existing desktop or laptop system with an internal hard drive,
that's not a fundamental problem, as long as it can boot the USB device. However,
as a new installation in an airport or in an airplane, the TCNS
approach yields a product which is less expensive and more durable.
</p>


<h4>Boot up Software System on the USB Device</h4>

<p>
The boot up software system on a liveCD is close to being the sort of
software we need, with its major drawback being that the read-only
nature of the storage medium. A liveCD is capable, on a good day, of recognizing and properly
deploying device drivers and configuration files for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>a wired Ethernet card,</li>
  <li>a wireless Internet card,</li>
  <li>a graphics card and display, and </li>
  <li>assorted other devices.</li>
</ul>

<p> This process doesn't always go well, but the major hurdle would
disappear if the target TCNS had reasonably standard devices for which
Linux device drivers existed in the source tree. Backward compatibility
problems may occur with randomly selected legacy desktop and laptop
machines instead of the more standardized TCNS. These problems would
disappear in most cases for 'mainstream' machines, as the needed device
drivers enter the Linux source tree. [We are resisting the temptation to
define a 'mainstream' machine as one for which the needed device drivers
<em>do</em> enter the Linux source tree.] </p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>
If we focus on the airplane traveller who currently carries a laptop, the
suggested solution involves considerably less:
</p> 

<ul>
  <li>hassle/stress,</li>
  <li>physical effort, and </li>
  <li>risk for the relatively vulnerable laptop.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It lightens the load for security personnel, moves the security line
more quickly, and allows the traveller more flexibility in choosing
carry-on items.
</p>

<p>
The focus on portability for air travel was chosen to illustrate a
general portability problem and its potential solution. The proposed
solution would also benefit:
</p> 

<ul>
  <li>students and instructors in academic settings,</li>
  <li>workers in office settings,</li>
  <li>parents of students who insist they need laptops for school plus a desktop at home,</li>
  <li>and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Further, the use of the TCNS approach could:
</p> 

<ul>
  <li>lessen system security burdens in certain settings,</li>
  <li>reduce power consumption, and </li>
  <li>provide interesting variations, such as VOIP.</li>
</ul>
