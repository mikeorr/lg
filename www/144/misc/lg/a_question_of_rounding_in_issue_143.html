<p>
Hello, all
</p>

<p>
In order to clarify a few points, set some issues to rest, and update
the listing of the source code that appeared in "A Question Of
Rounding", the following may be of interest.
</p>

<p>
First of all, I have to state unequivocally that there is no bug. There
never was a bug.  The printf() family of functions completely follow the
letter of both the C99 and IEEE specifications (at least for GLibC).
The matter has been completely explored and put to rest.
</p>

<p>
The issues brought to light in the article are, however very pertinent
to those of us who make a living producing code.  The listing below
addresses some of the real life issues some of us face when having to
deal with floating point arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
Please refer to the discussion which follows for an explanation as to
why printf() behaves the way it does, and what this code does to address
some of the problems I highlighted in my article.  The discussion is
also a summary of some of the many points raised in the bug report
discussion, and the information provided to me during that process by a
few very smart people.
</p>

    }    
  }
  printf("%i random floating point values tested\n", n);
  printf("  Number of dbl2buf failures: %i\n", nfails);
  printf("  Number of sprintf failures: %i\n", nspfails);
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Output:
<pre>
10000000 random floating point values tested
  Number of dbl2buf failures: 0
  Number of sprintf failures: 0
</pre>

<p>
The dbl2buf procedure implements a IEEE to decimal conversion similar
to snprintf().  The main differences are:
  a)  Usage of the "common rounding" rules where precision is lost,
      in a conversion as opposed to "bankers rounding" as implemented 
      in sprintf()
  b)  Recognises the loss of accuracy when a number was first
      converted from decimal=&gt;IEEE, and consequently limits 
      the allowable precision when converting back to decimal.  
      This internal precision is fixed at 15 significant decimal
      digits, for which decimal=&gt;IEEE=&gt;decimal is the identity.
  c)  Only supports fixed point output at present
  d)  It's slower <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

<p>
Discussion:
</p>

<p>
The C functions atof() and strtod() convert to a number from a string
containing a decimal representation.  IEEE often cannot store the
decimal number accurately, as:
</p>

<pre>
   a) Binary and decimal radix do not share the same set of irrational
      numbers
   b) The size of the floating point unit is constrained to a fixed 
      size.
</pre>

<p>
The above is untrue for the conversion from IEEE format to decimal,
where the width of the decimal number is unconstrained.  It is always
possible to convert IEEE=&gt;decimal in such a way that the exact same IEEE
number can be reproduced from the decimal buffer, provided the buffer is
big enough.  
</p>

<p>
Therefore, it is always possible to have
  IEEE=&gt;decimal=&gt;IEEE as the identity function,
but with
  decimal=&gt;IEEE=&gt;decimal 
it is only possible to retain identity by constraining the precision of
the decimal number you wish to reproduce to a maximum as dictated by the
size of the floating point unit.
</p>

<p>
The following examples all involve decimal=&gt;IEEE=&gt;decimal conversions.
The statement printf("%.5f", 1.234) tells the compiler to produce the
binary equivalent of 1.234 and store it on stack, or in an FP register
(decimal=&gt;binary) before calling the printf() function to convert it
back to decimal, and printing it to the screen.
</p>

<p>
printf() is not specified to allow for artificial precision constraints
when doing the binary=&gt;decimal conversion; as a result there is no loss
in accuracy for it's output.  This allows for reproducing an IEEE value
from it's result, and so you get for example:
<pre>
    printf("%.64f\n", 0.15);
    =&gt;0.1499999999999999944488848768742172978818416595458984375000000000
</pre>
such that
<pre>
    x = 0.15;
    sprintf(buf, "%64f", x);
    y = atof(buf);
    return x == y; // is the identity
</pre>
which is very nice if you want atof() to reproduce the original binary
number, but not so good if what you really wanted to see was
<pre>
    dbl2buf(sizeof(buf1), buf1, 0.15, 64);  printf("%s\n", buf1);
    =&gt;0.1500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
</pre>
Of course, we all know that 
<pre>
  printf("%.2f\n", 0.15); would have given us
  =&gt;0.15
</pre>
since printf() would round the number to the nearest value at decimal
place 2.  This is exactly what we would expect to see given the
circumstance.  But, how many people would have expected
<pre>
  printf("%.1f\n", 0.15);  to have given us
  =&gt;0.1  as a result?
</pre>

<p>
There is a perfectly logical reasons for this: The stored number, being
less than 1.5 (having lost accuracy in the decimal=&gt;IEEE conversion) is
accurately and correctly rounded to 0.1 since it is closer to 0.1 than
to 0.2.
</p>

<p>
what one might have preferred to see, is
<pre>
  dbl2buf(sizeof(buf1), buf1, 0.15, 2); printf("%s\n", buf1);
  =&gt;0.15
  dbl2buf(sizeof(buf1), buf1, 0.15, 1); printf("%s\n", buf1);
  =&gt;0.2
</pre>

<p>
We can correctly round the number in the above example only if we are
willing to dispense with some of the accuracy in the Floating Point
Unit.  There are a whole bunch of Floating Point numbers which would
produce the value 0.2 when rounded to a single decimal digit of
precision, or indeed the decimal number 0.150000000000000 rounded to 15
decimal digits of precision.
</p>

<p>
Constraining the precision of the target decimal value, though,
effectively makes it impossible to ensure that subsequent decimal=&gt;IEEE
conversion will produce the exact same IEEE number.
</p>

<p>
For this reason amongst many others, printf() cannot be altered to use
the above (precision constraint) logic, as the C specification
explicitly states that IEEE=&gt;decimal=&gt;IEEE must be the identity
function.
</p>

<p>
One more surprise awaits (some of) us, though: 
<pre>
  printf("%.64f\n", 1.25);
    =&gt;1.2500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
  printf("%.2f\n", 1.25);
    =&gt;1.25
  printf("%.1f\n", 1.25);
    =&gt;1.2
</pre>

<p>
This has a perfectly good explanation too.  Although we cannot blame the
accuracy of the floating point unit for this, we are looking at a
situation where 1.25 is no closer to 1.3 than it is to 1.2.  Either 1.2
or 1.3 would therefore suffice, and we fall back to the rounding rule
used by printf().  
</p>

<p>
For the GNU C library, the rounding rule used by printf() is "bankers
rounding" or "round to even". This is more correct than some other C
libraries, as the C99 specification says that conversion to decimal
should use the currently selected IEEE rounding mode (default bankers
rounding).
</p>

<p>
The dbl2buf() procedure though, is free to implement what is known as
"common rounding" or  "symmetric arithmetic rounding" which is commonly
tought in schools. It therefore produces
<pre>
    dbl2buf(sizeof(buf1), buf1, 1.25, 2); printf("%s\n", buf1);
      =&gt;1.25
    dbl2buf(sizeof(buf1), buf1, 1.25, 1); printf("%s\n", buf1);
      =&gt;1.3
</pre>

<p>
It should be stressed that neither "bankers rounding" nor "common
rounding" is necessarily the more "correct" way to round numbers.
Indeed, these are far from being the only two choices of rounding rules.
</p>

<p>
Bankers rounding produces less error when the number is used in further
calculations, as the error averages out.  However, common rounding is so
named, because it is the most common and well known form of rounding. 
</p>

<p>
It is relatively simple to adapt the dbl2buf() procedure for whichever
form of rounding is most suitable.
</p>

<p>
IEEE does not specify a "common rounding" or "round away from zero"
option, so again printf() would be wrong to implement common rounding-
even as an option.  For those of us who, like myself, need this sort of
rounding, we need to code our own binary to decimal conversions.  
</p>

<p>
Frankly, doing so has the distinct advantage of not being reliant on a
particular library's implementation of printf() and family.  If this is
your case, I hope the provided method will be of some use.
