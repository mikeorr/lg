<p>
I have come across this thing called FIFO named pipe. I can see how it
works, but I find no place where I can put it to good use (in a shell
script). Can someone give me a good application context where a shell
script would need to use FIFO ? I need a good and convincing example,
to be able to tell my students.

<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
[I wrote what follows nearly a month ago. Since I started working
full-time-plus, I have not been able to respond as promptly as I would
prefer. For many, I suspect, the subject has gone cold. Nevertheless,
...] 
</p>


<p>
As often happens, I have not phrased myself well. [sigh]
</p>

<p>
I apologise for trying to respond quickly, when clearly a fuller and
more considered response was indicated.
</p>

<p>
Let me try again.
</p>


<p>
As I understand it, this is the original statement of the problem:
</p>


<p>
	If you've ever tried to delete Emacs backup files with
</p>

<p>
	rm *~
</p>

<p>
	(i.e. remove anything ending with ~), but you
	accidentally hit Enter before the ~ and did "rm *", ...
</p>

<p>
Silas then goes on to suggest a solution.
</p>


<p>
Perhaps I took the problem statement too literally. When I wrote
cleanup.sh, it was aimed exclusively at emacs backup files. When I
talked about it, I was thinking exclusively of emacs backup files. I
am not aware of any other place where tildes are used.
</p>

<p>
If it's a file I've been editing with emacs, I've usually created it.
So I get to choose its name.
</p>

<p>
The message I am trying to convey to TAG's broad readership is this.
If you are happy with Silas's solution, that's fine. If you are happy
with any of the other solutions provided, that's fine too. I myself
have felt the need to deal with this problem. I offer my approach to
dealing with emacs backup files for your consideration.
</p>

<p>
Part of my approach is the cleanup script; this is the technical
outcome, the tangible I can offer to others.
</p>

<p>
More important is a holistic approach to the problem as originally
stated. I took it to mean that certain behaviours are more risky than
others. This is again in the eyes of the beholder. Some people always
alias 'rm' to 'rm -i'. If they do this, they will always be prompted
before deleting any file. If they specify multiple files, there will
be a prompt for each file individually.
</p>

<p>
Such an approach would have saved Silas.
</p>

<p>
Again, if such an approach appeals to you, by all means adopt it.
</p>

<p>
It seems to me ill-advised to adopt a safe behaviour in one
circumstance and a risky behaviour in another. The nett effect will
not be as safe as your safest behaviour, but rather as risky as your
riskiest behaviour. (A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.)
</p>

<p>
So, first of all, according to my philosophy, don't go creating files
with dangerous characters in them. It's really not important to me to
call a file 'a b' when I can just as easily call it 'a_b'. If I
download a file with spaces in the filename AND I plan to edit it with
emacs, it's worth renaming the file, replacing spaces with underscores
(or any other innocuous character).
</p>

<p>
And I am strongly recommending this behaviour of mine to others.
</p>

<p>
If you live largely in a Linux world, you should rarely encounter
filenames containing dangerous characters. If you are creating files,
you can choose to avoid dangerous characters. Or not. It's up to you.
<p>

<h3>Face detection in Perl</h3>

</p>

<p>
Since I got commit access to Tesseract, I've been getting a little
more interested in image recognition in general, and I was pleased to
find a Java-based 'face annotation' system on Sourceforge:
<a href='http://faint.sourceforge.net'>http://faint.sourceforge.net</a>
</p>

<p>
The problem is, it doesn't support face detection on Linux, but it
does have a relatively straightforward way of annotating the image
using XMP tags. Perl to the rescue - there's a module called
Image::ObjectDetect on CPAN... it's a pity the example in the POD is
incorrect.
</p>

<p>
Here's a correct example that generates a simple HTML map (and nothing else <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl

use warnings;
use strict;

use Image::ObjectDetect;

my $cascade = '/usr/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml';
my $file = $ARGV[0];
my @faces = Image::ObjectDetect::detect_objects($cascade, $file);
my $count=1;

print "&lt;map name='mymap'&gt;\n";
for my $face (@faces) {
    print "  &lt;area shape='rect' alt='map$count'
href='<a href='http://www.google.com'>http://www.google.com</a>' coords='";
    print $face-&gt;{x}, ", ";
    print $face-&gt;{y}, ", ";
    print $face-&gt;{x}+$face-&gt;{width}, ", ";
    print $face-&gt;{y}+$face-&gt;{height}, "'/&gt;\n";
}
print "&lt;/map&gt;\n";

print "&lt;img src='$file' usemap='mymap'/&gt;\n";
</pre>

<p>
(to install Image::ObjectDetect, you first need OpenCV. On Debian, that's<br>
apt-get install libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev<br>
cpan Image::ObjectDetect<br>
and you're done <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Hi Ben
</p>

<p>
I've read with interest the thread on C/R antispam technique.
</p>

<p>
The gmail solution sounds promising except in one use case - where you open an
account through a website. Unfortunately this often results in a confirmation
email - sometimes even with a username and password - exacly the kind of
information you would not want sniffed. One solution, as suggestesd by Martin
Krafft (<a href='http://madduck.net/blog/2010.02.09:sign-me-up-to-social-networking/'>http://madduck.net/blog/2010.02.09:sign-me-up-to-social-networking/</a>),
is to use a unique receiver address, such as myname-googlesignup at mydomain.co.uk
for these signups that you can whitelist in anticipation of a response, and
with the advantage that you can blacklist the address in the future if it gets
abused.
</p>

<p>
Please share with the list if you see fit.

I've enjoyed LG for many years, thanks.

Next time, please just copy and paste the error. It's plain text, so
there's no need for screenshots.
 
The error - which I've had to transcribe from your screenshot (an
unnecessary waste of time) - was
</p>

<pre>
Communications Error at ./cgate_migrate_ldap.pl line 175, &lt;DATA&gt; line 225.
</pre>

<p>
Taking a look at line 175 of the script shows a pretty good possibility
for where the possible problem might be:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
173 --&gt;  # Bind to servers
174 --&gt;  $mesg = $ldap_source-&gt;bind($binddn_source, password =&gt; 'ldapbppt');
175 --&gt;  $mesg-&gt;code &amp;&amp; die $mesg-&gt;error;
</pre>

<p>
That is, you're trying to bind to a server using the same password that
Rene had used in his article. Unless you're using that password, the
connection is going to fail.

&gt; First of all let me introduce my self:
&gt;

</pre>

<p>
Welcome! That's a good Alcoholics-Anonymous-style introduction. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I wanted to add many subjects to my search/clear function,
&gt; so i used a list.
</pre>

<p>
Not a bad idea so far...
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; while ( my $msg = $mb-&gt;next_message ) {
&gt;   my $flag = 0;
&gt;   my $s = $msg-&gt;header-&gt;{subject};
&gt; 
&gt;   if ( !$s ) {
&gt;     $s = "empty_subject";
&gt;   }
</pre>

<p>
If you're trying to set a default value for a variable, Perl has a nifty
way to do that by using "reflexive assigment":
</p>

<p>
$s ||= "empty_subject";
</p>

<p>
This essentially says "if $s is true - i.e., contains anything - then
leave it alone; otherwise, assign this value."
</p>


<pre>
&gt;   foreach (@subjects) {
&gt; 	  if ( $s =~ $_ ) {
</pre>

<p>
Although that will work, it's not a good idea: the binding operator (=~)
is intended to work with the match operator (/foo/ or m/foo/), and
omitting the latter makes your code fragile (i.e., since the usage is
non-standard, your code could fail with a later version of Perl.) In
addition to that, since $_ is the default binding for regexes, you don't
need to use it explicitly; you could just write
</p>

<p>
if (/$s/){
</p>

<p>
and be done with it.
</p>

<p>
However, there's a larger problem here: you don't need to build a state
machine to determine whether your messages contain one of the above
subjects - you can just use 'grep', or (my preferred method) a hash
lookup. I also noticed that you don't use the default value in "$s"
anywhere after defining it - and if you're just throwing it away, you
don't need to define it in the first place.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# Using grep
 
my @subjects = ("aaaaaa", "bbbbbb", "ccccc", "ddddd");
 
while ( my $msg = $mb-&gt;next_message ) {
	print "$msg\n" unless grep /$msg-&gt;header-&gt;{subject}/, @subjects;
}
</pre>

<p>
Alternate method, faster lookup with less grinding:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# Using a hash lookup
my %subjects = map { $_ =&gt; 1 } ("aaaa", "bbbb", "cccc", "dddd");
 
while ( my $msg = $mb-&gt;next_message ) {
    print "$msg\n" unless defined $subjects{$msg-&gt;header-&gt;{subject}};
}
</pre>

<p>
This latter version will also deal gracefully with undefined subject
lines.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; PS: Plz forgive me for my bad english - not my natural language.
</pre>

<p>
[smile] I'll be sure to "forgive" you - as soon as my Greek is as good
as your English (which, incidentally, is excellent as far as I can see.)
Again, welcome!

Hello TAG

<p>
I have an ubuntu linux machine here thats got a samba shared folder,
writable by anyone.
</p>

<p>
Is there any way i can know from what IP a certain file came?
</p>

<p>
Cause one of the windoze machines on my network is spreading some
virus, and I cant figure out what machine is that. It creates an
autorun.inf and a .exe on my ubuntu shared folder, thats the reason I
wanted to try to figure out where it came from.
</p>

Thanks

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Novell wins Final Linux Legal Battle</h3>
<p>After years of litigation, all of the SCO claims have been denied and 
it will be going into bankruptcy hearings in July - which had been 
delayed until the final judgement.</p>

<p>As noted on the Groklaw web site, Judge Ted Stewart ruled for Novell 
and against SCO. Futhermore, SCO's claims for breach of the implied 
covenant of fair dealings were also denied in the June jugement.</p>

<p>Here is the major part of Novell's statement from June 11:</p>

<p>"Yesterday, United States District Court Judge Ted Stewart issued a 
Final Judgment regarding the long standing dispute between SCO Group 
and Novell. As part of the decision, the Court reaffirmed the earlier 
jury verdict that Novell maintained ownership of important UNIX 
copyrights, which SCO had asserted to own in its attack on the Linux 
computer operating system. The Court also issued a lengthy Findings of 
Fact and Conclusions of Law wherein it determined that SCO was not 
entitled to an order requiring Novell to transfer the UNIX copyrights 
because "Novell had purposely retained those copyrights." In addition, 
the Court concluded that SCO was obligated to recognize Novell's 
waiver of SCO's claims against IBM and other companies, many of whom 
utilize Linux." </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">One Laptop per Child and Marvell To Redefine Tablet Computing</h3>
<p>In an agreement that could provide advanced, affordable tablet 
computers to classrooms throughout the world,  One Laptop per Child 
(OLPC), a global organization helping to provide every child in the 
world access to a modern education, and Marvell, a leader in 
integrated silicon solutions, will jointly develop a family of 
next-generation OLPC XO tablet computers based on the Marvell Moby 
reference design.  This new partnership will provide designs and 
technologies to enable a range of new educational tablets, delivered 
by OLPC and other education industry leaders, aimed at schools in both 
the U.S. and developing markets. Marvell is also announcing today it 
has launched Mobylize, a campaign to improve technology adoption in 
America's classrooms. </p>
 
<p>The new family of XO tablets will incorporate elements and new 
capabilities based on feedback from the nearly 2 million children and 
families around the world who use the current XO laptop.  The XO 
tablet will require approximately one watt of power to operate 
compared to about 5 watts necessary for the current XO laptop.  The XO 
tablet will also feature a multi-lingual soft keyboard with touch 
feedback, and will also feature an application to directly access more 
than 2 million free books available across the Internet. </p>

<p>The first tablets in the line will be based closely on the Moby, <em>not</em> 
the XO-3 design, and will focus more on children in the developed world. 
These will be on display at CES 2011 in January, and available next 
year for under $100. The original XO-3 design is still planned for 
2012 and will benefit from the experience of both the XO-1.75 and the 
Moby efforts.</p>

<p>"The Moby tablet platform - and our partnership with OLPC - represents 
our joint passion and commitment to give students the power to learn, 
create, connect and collaborate in entirely new ways," said Weili Dai, 
Marvell's Co-founder and Vice President and General Manager of the 
Consumer and Computing Business Unit. "Marvell's cutting edge 
technology - including live content, high quality video (1080p full-HD 
encode and decode), high performance 3D graphics, Flash 10 Internet 
and two-way teleconferencing - will fundamentally improve the way 
students learn by giving them more efficient, relevant - even fun 
tools to use.  Education is the most pressing social and economic 
issue facing America.  I believe the Marvell Moby tablet can ignite a 
life-long passion for learning in all students everywhere." </p>

<p>Powered by a high-performance, highly scalable, and low-power Marvell 
ARMADA 610 application processor, the Moby tablet features gigahertz 
processor speed, 1080p full-HD encode and decode, intelligent power 
management, power-efficient Marvell 11n Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/FM/GPS 
connectivity, high performance 3D graphics and support for multiple 
platforms including full Adobe Flash, Android, Windows Mobile and 
Ubuntu.  The Moby platform also features a built-in camera for live 
video conferencing, multiple simultaneous viewing screens and 
Marvell's 11n Mobile Hotspot which allows Wi-Fi access that supports 
up to eight concurrent users connected to the Internet via a cellular 
broadband connection. The ultra low power mobile tablet has a very 
long battery life. </p>

<p>Moby is currently being piloted in at-risk schools in Washington, DC, 
and Marvell is investing in a Mobylize campaign to improve tech 
adoption within US classrooms. This should help OLPC in the developed 
world.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">One Laptop Per Child To Provide Laptops To High Schools</h3>
<p>In June, One Laptop per Child (OLPC) was awarded a bid by Plan Ceibal 
to provide 90,000 updated XO laptops for high school students in 
Uruguay. This is the first time the OLPC XO laptops have been 
specifically designed for high school-aged students and represents a 
major expansion in its global learning program. </p>

<p>The XO high school laptop (XO-H) is built on the XO-1.5 platform and 
based on a VIA processor. it will provide 2X the speed of the XO 1.0, 
4X DRAM memory, and 4X Flash memory. The XO-H is designed with a larger 
keyboard that is better suited to the larger hands and fingers of older 
students. It will feature the learning-focused Sugar user interface on 
top of a dual-boot Linux operating system, with Gnome Desktop 
Environment that offers office productivity tools.</p>
 
<p>The XO-H will be delivered with age-appropriate learning programs 
adapted to the scholastic needs of secondary schools. A new color 
variation for the laptop's case (light and dark blue) will be an 
option for the high school model. The XO, specially designed for 
rugged environments, is well-suited for remote classrooms and daily 
transportation between home and school. The XO uses three times less 
electricity than other laptops and is built as a sealed, dust-free 
system. </p>

<p>The government of Uruguay through Plan Ceibal has completely saturated 
primary schools with 380,000 XOs and will now begin to expand the 
highly successful One Laptop per Child learning program to its high 
schools. There are 230,000 high school students in Uruguay.</p>
 
<p>"Until now, the 1.5 million students worldwide using XO laptops had no 
comparable computer to 'grow up' to," said OLPC Association CEO 
Rodrigo Arboleda. "The XO high school edition laptop demonstrates how 
the XO and its software can easily adapt to the needs of its users."</p>

<p>One Laptop per Child (OLPC at <a href="http://www.laptop.org">http://www.laptop.org</a>) is a non-profit 
organization created by Nicholas Negroponte and others from the MIT 
Media Lab to design, manufacture and distribute laptop computers that 
are inexpensive enough to provide every child in the world access to 
knowledge and modern forms of education.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Swype Beta for Android OS</h3>
<p>Swype is offering a narrowcast Beta on its updated Android keyboard 
application.  This application interprets word choices in real time 
from a dictionary database as a user slides a finger between letters 
in a continuous motion. </p>

<p>The Swype software is very tightly written with a total memory 
footprint of under 1 MB.</p>

<p>The patented technology enables users to input words faster and easier 
than other data input methods - over 50 words per minute. The 
application is designed to work across a variety of devices such as 
phones, tablets, game consoles, kiosks, televisions, virtual screens 
and more.</p>

<p>A key advantage to Swype is that there is no need to be very accurate, 
enabling very rapid text entry. Swype has been designed to run in 
real time on relatively low-powered portable devices.</p>

<p>The beta software has built-in dictionaries for English, Spanish, and 
Italian.  The beta software supports phones with HVGA (480h x 320w), 
WVGA (800h x 480w) and WVGA854(854h x 480w) screen sizes (screen size 
is detected by the software).</p>

<p>Here are some details on the beta:<br />
* It will be open for a limited time;<br />
* Initially, only English, Spanish, and Italian - more languages to 
come;<br />
* Some key features of Swype require OEM integration;<br />
* Limited End User Support - mostly forum.</p>

<p>If your phone came pre-installed with Swype, DO NOT download this beta 
(it won't work).</p>

<p>The beta is open to all phones using Android which do not already have 
Swype pre-installed. For more information on Swype and the current 
beta test, go to: <a href="http://beta.swype.com/">http://beta.swype.com/</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Novell Releases SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1</h3>
<p>Novell released SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 1 (SP1) in May, 
which delivers broad virtualization capabilities, high availability 
clustering, and more flexible maintenance and support options.</p>
 
<p>SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP1 is optimized for physical, virtuali, and 
 cloud infrastructures and offers numerous advancements, including: 
Broad virtualization support, including the latest Xen 4.0 hypervisor 
with significantly improved virtual input/output performance, support 
for KVM, an emerging open source virtualization hypervisor, and Linux 
integration components in Hyper-V - an industry first. 
Best open source high-availability solution, with clustering advances 
such as support for metro area clusters, simple node recovery with 
ReaR, a source disaster recovery framework, and new administrative 
tools including a cluster simulator and web-based GUI.
First enterprise Linux distribution with an updated 2.6.32 kernel, 
which leverages the RAS features in Intel Xeon processor 7500 and 5600 
series.</p>
<p>New technology on the desktop, including improved audio and Bluetooth 
support, as well as the latest versions of Firefox, OpenOffice.org and 
Evolution, which includes MAPI enhancements for improved 
interoperability with Microsoft Exchange.</p>

<p>With SP1, Novell is implementing more flexible support options that 
will allow customers to remain on older package releases during the 
product's life cycle, and will significantly lower the hurdle to 
deploy upcoming service packs. While current releases deliver the most 
value with proactive maintenance updates and patches, for customers 
that place a premium on stability, this program delivers superior 
control and flexibility by allowing them to decide when and how to 
upgrade.</p>

<p>Long Term Service Pack Support will continue to be available for 
customers that want full technical support and fixes backported to 
earlier releases.</p>

<p>IBM and other component, system, and software vendors like AMD, 
Broadcom, Brocade, Dell, Emulex, Fujitsu, HP, Intel, LSI, Microsoft, 
nVidia, QLogic and SGI leverage Partner Linux Driver Program tools to 
support their third-party technology with SUSE Linux Enterprise. 
Novell's partners provide more than 5,000 certified applications today 
for SUSE Linux Enterprise, twice that of the next closest enterprise 
Linux distribution provider.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Apache Announces Cassandra Release 0.6 distributed data store</h3>

<p>The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) - developers, stewards, and 
incubators of 138 Open Source projects - has announced Apache 
Cassandra version 0.6, the Project's latest release  since its 
graduation from the ASF Incubator in February 2010.</p>

<p>Apache Cassandra is an advanced, second-generation "NoSQL" distributed 
data store that has a shared-nothing architecture. The Cassandra 
decentralized model provides massive scalability, and is highly 
available with no single point of failure even under the worst 
scenarios.</p>

<p>Originally developed at Facebook and submitted to the ASF Incubator in 
2009, the Project has added more than a half-dozen new committers, and 
is deployed by dozens of high-profile users such as Cisco WebEx, 
Cloudkick, Digg, Facebook, Rackspace, Reddit, and Twitter, among 
others.</p>

<p>"The services we provide to customers are only as good the systems 
they are built on," said Eric Evans, Apache Cassandra committer and 
Systems Architect at The Rackspace Cloud. "With Cassandra, we get the 
fault-tolerance and availability our customers demand, and the 
scalability we need to make things work."</p>

<p>Cassandra 0.6 features include:<br />
* Support for Apache Hadoop: this allows running analytic queries with 
the leading map/reduce framework against data in Cassandra;<br />
* Integrated row cache: this eliminates the need for a separate 
caching layer, thereby simplifying architectures;<br />
* Increased speed: this builds on Cassandra's ability to process 
thousands of writes per second, allowing applications to cope with 
increasing write loads.</p>

<p>"Apache Cassandra 0.6 is 30% faster across the board, building on our 
already-impressive speed," said Jonathan Ellis, Apache Cassandra 
Project Management Committee Chair. "It achieves scale-out without 
making the kind of design compromises that result in operations teams 
getting paged at 2 AM."</p>

<p>Twitter switched to Apache Cassandra because it can run on large 
server clusters and is capable of taking in very large amounts of data 
at a time. Storage Team Technical Lead Ryan King explained, "At 
Twitter, we're deploying Cassandra to tackle scalability, flexibility 
and operability issues in a way that's more highly available and cost 
effective than our current systems."</p>

<p>Released under the Apache Software License v2.0, Apache Cassandra 0.6 
can be downloaded at <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">http://cassandra.apache.org/</a>.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Primal Launches Semantic Web Tools</h3>

<p>Paving the way to a Web 3.0 Internet, Primal announced its Primal 
Thought Networking platform and beta version of its newest service, 
Pages, from the 2010 Semantic Technology Conference in June. </p>
 
<p>Delivered on the  Software as a Service (SaaS) model, the Primal 
Thought Networking platform, using semantic synthesis, helps content 
producers to expand their digital footprint and improve engagement 
with their consumers, at lower cost. For consumers, the platform 
delivers a more personalized experience that is based on content 
relevant to their thoughts and ideas. Rather than sifting through page 
after page of content, the Thought Networking platform's software 
assistants automate the filtering processes, delivering more relevant 
content. </p>
 
<p>In addition to the launch of the Thought Networking platform, Primal 
also introduced the beta version of its newest offering, Pages. With 
Pages, users can now quickly generate an entire Web presence based on a 
topic relevant to their interests, which then may be explored, 
customized and shared with friends or the general public.  The Pages 
beta website generator utilizes Semantic Web technology that goes 
beyond the simple facilitation of content discovery, pulling 
information from sites like Wikipedia, Yahoo!, and Flickr, delivering 
relevant and useful content in a centralized view in real-time. </p>
 
<p>"Semantic synthesis is the ability to create in real time a semantic 
graph of what I need.  With our growing portfolio of IP and patents, 
we have spent the past several years developing an intuitive 
technology that annotates a person's thoughts and ideas," said 
Primal's Founder and Co-President Peter Sweeney, speaking live from 
the Semantic Technology Conference. "On the content manufacturing plane, 
we provide content developers with a completely new market of content 
but will also enable an entirely untapped group of people who would 
not otherwise have the technical aptitude, but have big ideas to 
share, to quickly and easily become content developers."</p>
 
<p>Using Primal's semantic synthesis technology, teachers will be able to 
seamlessly build a website of course materials for their students; 
hobbyists can create a one-stop, definitive source of information for 
their pastime; politicians can build hyper-local, targeted sites 
featuring local activities and news in support of their constituents.</p>

<h1>Pixie Chronicles: Part 4 Kickstart</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<strong>Keywords</strong>: NFS
</p>

<h3>The Story So Far</h3>

<p>
In Part 1 I outlined my plans: to build a server using network
install. However, I got sidetracked by problems. In Part 2 I made some
progress and dealt with one of the problems. In Part 3 I detailed the
first part of the network install -- from start to PXE boot. This part
details the rest of the procedure.
</p>

<p>
If you've been following me so far, you have a target machine which
uses the PXE process to boot into the PXE boot Linux kernel.
Importantly, you've tried it out and confirmed that this much of the
exercise behaves as desired.
</p>

<p>
The PXE boot process comes to the point where you see the prompt:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	boot:
</pre>

<p>
We have not yet set up enough to proceed to the next stage, for which
I used NFS.
</p>

<h3>Planning</h3>

<p>
First decide on an install method. My exercise was with Fedora
10. The possible install media are:
</p>

<pre>
	CD or DVD drive
	Hard Drive
	Other Device (presumably USB)
	HTTP Server
	FTP Server
	NFS Server
</pre>

<p>
Only the last 3 are network installs, which is all we are interested
in here. I chose NFS Server.
</p>

<p>
Further, I happened to have a machine which was PXE-capable. So my
plan was to turn on the machine and (as near as possible) have it
install all the software without my intervention.
</p>

<p>
If your machine is not PXE-capable in hardware, it may still be
possible to perform an unassisted install - but you will need to create
a CD or DVD to achieve the PXE part. It might be possible to create a
PXE floppy.
</p>

<p>
You will of course need a server to serve PXE data and other info over
the network. I chose my desktop as the PXE server.
</p>

<h3>Components</h3>

<pre>
	PXE client (see previous article)
	PXE server (see previous article)
		tftp
		dhcp
		pxelinux
	kickstart
	NFS (see below)
</pre>

<h3>NFS</h3>

<p>
Since the network method I chose was NFS, I had to set up NFS. I
judged that it would be easier to set up NFS than to set up HTTP; I
was probably a wee bit foolish not going for FTP -- at the time I had
security reservations, but I think for an internal private network
like mine, there is no difference in security between FTP and NFS.
</p>

<p>
Arguably TFTP would have been even better because it was already in
place having been needed at an earlier step. But it was not available
as an option.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	mkdir -p /Big/FedoraCore10/NFSroot
	ln -s /Big/FedoraCore10/NFSroot /NFS
</pre>

<p>
Create <strong>/etc/exports</strong>:
</p>

<pre>
#       exports

/NFS                    192.168.0.0/24(ro,no_subtree_check,root_squash)
/NFS/CD_images          192.168.0.0/24(ro,no_subtree_check,root_squash)

</pre>
</p>

<p>
All I've done here is allow any machine on my local subnet to access
NFS on the server (my desktop -- where I'm typing this).
</p>

<pre>
	NB exports do not "inherit". If you export "/NFS" that won't
	allow clients to mount "/NFS/CD_images".
</pre>

<p>

</p>

<pre class="code">
	mkdir /var/lib/nfs/v4recovery
	/etc/rc.d/init.d/nfs start
	exportfs -a
	exportfs -v
</pre>

<p>
I had all sorts of problems with NFS. I found it useful to test
locally using:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	mkdir /mnt/nfs
	mount 192.168.0.3:/NFS /mnt/nfs
</pre>

<p>
And if you want to snoop network traffic, you'll need:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	tshark -w /tmp/nfs.tshark -i lo
</pre>

<p>
This should behave in a way akin to what the client PC will see when
it tries to NFS-mount directories from the server.
</p>

<p>
The layout of the NFS directory:
</p>

<pre>
	ls -lA /NFS
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root staff 25 Nov 26 22:12 /NFS -&gt; /Big/FedoraCore10/NFSroot

	ls -lA /NFS/.
total 44
drwxrwxr-x 3 root   staff  4096 Nov 28 17:59 CD_images
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root   staff    13 Nov 27 10:31 b2 -&gt; ks.b2.cfg.sck
-rw-rw-r-- 1 henryg henryg 3407 Dec  7 18:28 ks.b2.cfg.sck

</pre>

<p>
The NFS directory also contains many other files left over from numerous
false starts. (Hey, I'm human.) 
</p>

<pre>
	ls -lA /NFS/CD_images
total 3713468
-rw-rw-r-- 2 henryg henryg 720508928 Nov 26 07:43 Fedora-10-i386-disc1.iso
-rw-rw-r-- 2 henryg henryg 706545664 Nov 26 08:03 Fedora-10-i386-disc2.iso
-rw-rw-r-- 2 henryg henryg 708554752 Nov 26 08:38 Fedora-10-i386-disc3.iso
-rw-rw-r-- 2 henryg henryg 724043776 Nov 26 09:17 Fedora-10-i386-disc4.iso
-rw-rw-r-- 2 henryg henryg 720308224 Nov 26 09:18 Fedora-10-i386-disc5.iso
-rw-rw-r-- 2 henryg henryg  83990528 Nov 26 10:15 Fedora-10-i386-disc6.iso
-rw-rw-r-- 2 henryg henryg 134868992 Nov 26 10:17 Fedora-10-i386-netinst.iso
</pre>

<p>
It is not necessary to mount the CD images; it seems that
<tt>anaconda</tt> (the program which performs the actual install)
knows how to do that. Sharp-eyed readers will have spotted that the
iso images are hard-linked in the /NFS/CD_images directory. That's
because I first downloaded the images to /Big/downloads thinking I
would need to mount them; later when I was setting up the NFS
directory I finally discovered that I needed the images as not-mounted
files. Rather than copy the files and waste a heap of disk space, or
move the files and risk making something else fail, I chose to
hard-link them and get "two for the price of one".
</p>

<h3>The kickstart file</h3>

<p>
I used system-config-kickstart to generate a first kickstart file. I
edited it to get more of the things I wanted and then decided to try
it out. After several go-arounds I got to the point which got me into
trouble (as described in Part 1).
</p>

<p>
Here is the final kickstart file:
</p>

<pre>
#	ks.b2.cfg.sck - created by HMG from system-config-kickstart for b2

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>
That's it. Here's a walk-through of what happens for an install.
</p>

<pre>
	User connects network cable to target machine and powers up.

	PXE gains control and asks network for an IP address and other
	information server has for this machine (at this stage
	identified by MAC address).

	Server sends the requested info.

	PXE configures the NIC with the received IP address.

	PXE uses tftp to download a Linux kernel.

	The linux kernel announces itself with the prompt "boot: ".

User enters <strong>b2</strong>. User is no longer needed.

	Still using tftp, the target machine downloads another Linux
	kernel. In accordance with the label <strong>b2</strong>, it then uses NFS to
	download the kickstart file.

	The kickstart file specifies that the install should also use
	NFS. The installer uses the parameters of the kickstart file
	to govern the installation.

	When the install is complete, the target machine (now a shiny
	new server) reboots.

	PXE gains control as before and the steps above are followed.
	However, at the "boot: " prompt, either the user simply
	presses Enter, or, more likely, because the user is not there,
	the boot loader times out. Either way, the default label <strong>lhd</strong>
	is taken: the target machine boots off the recently installed
	hard drive.

	Some time later, the user reboots and disables the PXE boot
	which is no longer needed.

<h1>Tacco and the Painters (A Fable for the Nineties)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p class="editorial">
Henry and I were having a conversation via e-mail, and happened upon a
subject of difficult clients. As in many things, he and I see eye to eye on
this issue - but he managed to do me one better: while I was still fuming
just a bit, and thinking about how to make things go better the next time,
Henry sent me this story that captured my (and clearly his) experience
perfectly, and ticked off all the checkboxes I was trying to fill. In fact,
I was bemused and stunned by how well it did so... but that is
traditionally the case with parables. They're timeless, and their lessons
endure.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
This tale may not have much to do with Linux, or Open Source in general;
however, part of LG's function, as I see it, is to educate and entertain -
or better yet, to educate while entertaining. For those of you who, like
myself, work as consultants, or plan to go on your own and become
consultants, I recommend this story heartily and without reservation: read
it, understand it, follow it. Someday, it may save your sanity; for the
moment, I hope that it at least tickles your funny bone.<br>
 -- Ben Okopnik, Editor-in-Chief
</p>

<hr>

<p>
"Here is our cottage," said Tacco. "We'd like it painted nicely."
</p>

<p>
"Of course," said Ozzy. "We always try to do a good job. Our workers
are very diligent. I'm sure you will be satisfied."
</p>

<p>
Tacco showed Ozzy all around the cottage. Ozzy asked the occasional
question and made some notes.
</p>

<p>
"We usually provide an estimate of how long the job will take and
charge time and materials," said Ozzy.
</p>

<p>
Tacco looked horrified. "No! We cannot agree to that!" he exclaimed.
"We will only proceed with you if you give us a fixed-price quote."
</p>

<p>
Ozzy looked uncomfortable. "We might be able to provide a fixed-price
quote. But we would need to have everything specified fairly precisely. We
wouldn't be able to permit <em>ad hoc</em> renovations once we start the
work."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right," said Tacco.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll bring in a couple of my estimators so that you and they can
agree exactly what the job is," continued Ozzy.
</p>

<p>
"When can you start? We want this job finished very soon because
people will be wanting to live in this cottage in the very near
future. We expect to have finished refurbishing in a couple of weeks."
</p>

<p>
They discussed dates for a while and finally agreed that the painting
would be finished in three months, at the end of May. They made an
appointment for Ozzy's estimators to go over the cottage with Tacco.
</p>


<p>
A few days later, Ozzy asked Tacco to go over the cottage in some
detail and tell the estimators and Ozzy the details of the painting
job: number of coats of paint, colour scheme and so on. The estimators
took measurements of the room sizes and layout.
</p>

<p>
Back in the office, Ozzy pored over the figures to come up with a
quote for Tacco. He had his secretary type it up and then he checked
all the details. He even had his estimators check his calculations. At
last, he mailed off the quote to Tacco.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, Tacco rang Ozzy to tell him the good news. Ozzy had
won the business. Tacco was eager to get the work under way. Ozzy's
team of painters would start the following week.
</p>


<p>
When the painters arrived, Tacco was there to meet them. He led them
to a building.
</p>

<p>
"This isn't the cottage that we looked at last time," said David, one
of the painters (who was also one of the estimators).
</p>

<p>
"No," agreed Tacco. "But its very similar to the one you saw. I'm sure
the differences are not important."
</p>

<p>
David was a bit doubtful, but he was reluctant to appear
uncooperative. So he bit his tongue and led his work-mate, Charlie,
into the cottage.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't look like the renovators have finished this cottage," said
Charlie.
</p>

<p>
"No, they haven't," agreed Tacco. "But they'll be finished by the time
you are ready to start painting."
</p>

<p>
"But I'm ready to start right now," wailed Charlie. "David and I were
going to start preparing the walls today."
</p>

<p>
"Well, can't you prepare the walls in those 2 rooms over there and
come back and prepare the walls in here another day?" asked Tacco.
</p>

<p>
"I can do that," agreed Charlie. "But I was counting on doing all the
preparation in one day."
</p>

<p>
Tacco gave him a look that suggested that Charlie was being most
unreasonable.
</p>

<p>
Charlie and David prepared the walls in the two rooms specified and
returned to the office. It was too late to start another job, so they
sat around playing darts.
</p>

<p>
A few days later, Charlie received a phone call from Tacco saying that
the renovators had finished all their modifications and so the rest of
the cottage was ready.
</p>

<p>
"When will you be here?" Tacco demanded.
</p>

<p>
Charlie was in the middle of some work for another customer. But Tacco
was so insistent and Charlie tried so hard to please his customers
that he agreed to go out that same afternoon.
</p>

<p>
When Charlie got to the cottage, Tacco's twin-brother Racco was there
obviously very busy performing renovations on the cottage.
</p>

<p>
"How come you're here?" asked Racco abruptly. "I said I'd ring you
when the renovations were finished."
</p>

<p>
"B-but Tacco rang me this morning," pleaded Charlie.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, it shouldn't bother you if the renovations aren't entirely
finished. There must be other things you can go on with because we
finished 4 other rooms yesterday. When you're ready to start work on
the new rooms, we will have finished them."
</p>

<p>
"But the cottage we first saw had only 4 rooms altogether. It sounds
like there are now 6 or 7 rooms. This is no longer a cottage, it's a
house."
</p>

<p>
"Stop complaining," demanded Racco. "The rooms we added on aren't very
big and they are basically exactly the same as the ones we showed
you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not supposed to do any more work until all the renovations are
finished," said Charlie.
</p>

<p>
"Oh well. Since you're here I'll get Jocco to finish these
renovations. It'll only take about 5 minutes. Can you wait?"
</p>

<p>
Charlie felt trapped. 5 minutes didn't seem like such a long time. It
would be churlish of him to walk out now.
</p>

<p>
"All right. I'll wait," he replied.
</p>

<p>
Charlie tried to go on with some other work that needed to be done. He
noticed that some of the walls that he had prepared last time had had
some further renovations carried out on them. I guess I had better
redo the preparations on these walls, he thought.
</p>

<p>
Just then Racco came back. "Look, is it all right if I just take some
measurements in here?" he asked, and without waiting for a reply began
to measure the walls.
</p>

<p>
Charlie was non-plussed. Now there was nothing he could go on with. I
guess I'll get myself a coffee, he decided.
</p>

<p>
As he was coming back with the coffee, he overheard one of Racco's workers
saying, "Those workers of Ozzy's are <a
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bludger">bludgers</a>. All they ever
do is sit around and drink coffee."
</p>

<p>
She betrayed no embarrassment at being overheard. Charlie was almost
in tears and turned away so as to hide his distress. He made a
production of drinking his coffee to calm himself.
</p>

<p>
An hour later, Racco came back and informed Charlie that the
renovations were now complete. He gave Charlie a few scribbled pages.
</p>

<p>
"These are the room numbers and the labels on the corresponding
keys," he explained to Charlie. "All the rooms are, of course, locked.
Check that each key works in the corresponding lock. Let me know if
there are any problems and I will have our Service Department provide
a new key."
</p>

<p>
Charlie looked at the list in dismay. There were 136 keys!
</p>

<p>
He put the list aside and decided he would deal with that another day.
For now, he would try to finish the preparation on 2 of the original
rooms.
</p>

<p>
After half an hour, he had nearly finished the first room. Charlie
found it most satisfactory to divide a room into sections. Each
section consisted of an area of wall 2 metres wide, from floor to
ceiling. He was just starting the last section when he heard a
crashing noise and found that the plaster sheet had fallen to the
ground and smashed to pieces.
</p>

<p>
He went to see Racco. Racco was very annoyed. "You must have hit it
with a sledge hammer - our plasterers guarantee that our walls can
withstand normal wear and tear."
</p>

<p>
They went to inspect the damage; all the while Racco muttered about
incompetent fools. "I'm going to have to get someone to rebuild this
wall," he complained.
</p>

<p>
"Look how strong these walls are," he announced, banging on another
section with his fist. "They're all built to the same standard," he
continued, banging on another wall. This time he banged a little
harder. "We've been guaranteed that they can withstand even the
heaviest pounding by the strongest fist. Of course, they're not
intended to withstand a sledge hammer."
</p>

<p>
Proudly, he banged on each panel in turn. Suddenly, there was a loud
crack, and the panel disintegrated. Racco swore loudly.
</p>

<p>
"Those bloody cretins in Building Maintenance," he yelled, inspecting
the underlying frame. "I told them to check the frames and replace any
rotten ones. It's not our fault. We only attach the plaster. If the
frames are rotten, the nails don't hold and the plaster falls off. It
happens all the time.
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't bother you though. You can continue working in one of the
other rooms. They're all the same so it shouldn't matter which room
you work on next."
</p>

<p>
Charlie tried hard to regroup. Things seemed to have gotten completely
out of hand. When had this exercise first left the rails, he wondered.
Which was the exact moment when things had started to go wrong? It was
an impossible question.
</p>

<p>
He left the building, thoroughly dejected.
</p>

<p>
The next day, Charlie and David went back to the house. "I'll start on
some of the new rooms," said David. "You see if you can't finish the 2
original rooms."
</p>

<p>
Charlie started mixing paints. This is better, he thought. He wasn't
too keen on preparation, although he understood the need for it. He
felt there was little to show for an awful lot of hard work. But
painting was dead easy, and the customers were always cheered when
they saw how nice a room looked once the painting had been finished.
They never seemed to understand the connection between fastidious
preparation and a stunning final result. But Charlie understood.
</p>

<p>
As he worked, he started to hum and his spirits soared. Then David
came into the room where Charlie was painting. He looked pale.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" asked Charlie.
</p>

<p>
"I've just tried the doors on half-a-dozen rooms," replied David. "None
of the keys fit!"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" asked Charlie. "You must have to jiggle them a
bit. Keys get stuck sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"No," cried David. "The keys DON'T FIT - I can't even get them in the
keyhole! They're the wrong sort of key for the lock!"
</p>

<p>
Charlie went back with David to check. Sadly David was right. They
went to see Racco.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not responsible for keys - that's Security Services. We have no
control over keys and locks." Racco paused for a moment. "Look, the
renovations are finished. We'll get Security Services to cut new keys.
They shouldn't take long. You'll have the new keys and you can try
them out," he concluded with some satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
"Gimme a break," cried Charlie. "Are you expecting me to try 136
keys?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm going to arrange to get them cut!" shouted Racco. "You
don't expect me to test them as well, do you? Look, by the time you
need to start work, all the keys will be done. Just tell me which room
you want to start work on and I'll get that key immediately. I can't
be fairer than that, can I?"
</p>


<p>
On their return to the office, Charlie complained to Ozzy, who rang
Racco. The response was staggeringly quick: there would be a
Meeting. Not just a meeting or a Meeting, but in fact A MEETING.
</p>

<pre>
	There was movement at the station, for the word had passed around...

	...So all the cracks had gathered to the fray.
	All the tried and noted riders from the stations near and far
	Had mustered at the homestead overnight,
	For the bushmen love hard riding where the wild bush horses are,
	And the stock-horse snuffs the battle with delight.

		'The Man from Snowy River', A. B. Paterson
</pre>

<p>
Everyone from Tacco's organisation was at THE MEETING. David and
Juliette were the only two representatives from Ozzy's office.
</p>

<p>
David tried to explain the situation.
</p>

<p>
Racco jumped to his feet. "That's bullshit!" he shouted. "It is not
our fault. Those guys from Ozzy's office don't know their job. They do
everything wrong. They couldn't even cut the keys for the locks. We
had to do that!"
</p>

<p>
Flacco was Tacco's boss. When she heard this outburst from Racco, her
eyebrows shot up. She seemed to be in a conciliatory mood.
</p>

<p>
"I suggest that Ozzy's people give us an Impact Statement," she
proposed. Turning to Juliette, she continued, "Produce a list
detailing things like the time the plaster fell off the walls, and how
much time was lost. We'll look at it."
</p>

<p>
Back at Ozzy's office, the staff went into a huddle.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Borodin spoke.
</p>

<p>
"We are not going to produce a detailed Impact Statement. Here is the
impact. We were asked to start this job in February. It was understood
that for us to do our painting, the renovations had to be finished. It
is now June. The renovations are still not complete. The impact is the
total time from February to June.
</p>

<p>
"Further, the impact continues until the renovations are complete. That
means 'completely complete'. Not complete in these 5 rooms and 80% in
the remaining 10. We want to go in on one day, start at one end and
finish the preparation all the way through to the other. Without bits
of plaster hitting the floor. Without discovering that the keys don't
work on Friday. Without discovering that the 7th of July is a Buddhist
holiday.
</p>

<p>
"We reject entirely the question, 'But isn't there something you can
go on with?' The issue is not whether some part of the building can be
accessed. The only issue is whether the building is completely
accessible. If it isn't, if renovations are still being performed,
people cannot start occupying the building, let alone us painting it."
</p>

<p>
He folded down a second finger.
</p>

<p>
"We were asked to give a fixed-price quote on painting a four-room
cottage. We were shown one cottage; we are being asked to paint an
entirely different cottage. And it isn't a cottage any more. It's been
renovated into a 16-room bloody mansion! And the renovations have
still not been completed.
</p>

<p>
Borodin brought down a third finger.
</p>

<p>
"Further, there does not appear to have been any design involved in
producing the mansion. The reality is, that we have been the guinea
pigs: when we have pointed out a problem, like the fact that there
were 4 bathrooms upstairs but no toilets, they have gone away,
scratched their heads and come up with a "solution". Which is why
there are so many extra rooms now. The building has grown, but it was
never planned.
</p>

<p>
"So we have no guarantee that it will ever be finished. Because I
don't think anyone knows what the building is meant to do. Since there
appears to be no definition of "finished", how will anyone recognise the
endpoint if it should ever miraculously appear?"
</p>

<p>
Borodin reached for his fourth finger.
</p>

<p>
"There is a serious problem to do with size. Tacco's crew are hoping
to accomodate 120 people in that mansion. But we have checked with
council. They will not permit more than 46 people on that block. We
have pointed that out to Macco. He says he knew there was a limit. In
fact, his understanding was that there was a by-law limiting
occupancy to 32 people.
</p>

<p>
"What is Tacco's response? Is there any point in us painting enough
rooms for 120 people when only 46 can be accommodated? We could argue
that that is Tacco's problem. But, ..." Borodin left the thought
hanging.
</p>

<p>
He opened his hand and took hold of his thumb.
</p>

<p>
"We have told Tacco that we expect to be able to finish the painting
in eight days. Originally, we quoted 39 days. Tacco might say to us,
'How can you claim an impact of the entire time when you originally
quoted 39 days and now you claim you are only 8 days from finishing?'
</p>

<p>
"The answer is simple. We are claiming an impact of the entire time
because we cannot claim an impact of more than the entire time. If we
could, we would. The real impact is in fact 90 days (or thereabouts):
from February to June. That is the time we have wasted due to Tacco's
incompetence. It may show that we were remiss in our estimation: we
allowed 31 days for Tacco's delays; there were actually 3 times as
many.
</p>

<p>
"We have actually worked (or tried to) during that time. We have
expended more hours than we budgeted. We have been prevented from
painting other houses. It has cost us even more than it appears on
paper. It is one thing to wear travel time of one hour if one actually
performs 6 hours of useful work at the site. How does one account for
the travel time if one goes out, discovers that one can't work
usefully and comes back an hour later? What about the case where one
goes out, performs 6 hours of hard work doing preparation on a wall,
only to discover the next time we arrive at the site that the wall has
collapsed in the meantime, has been rebuilt, and has to be prepared
again?"
</p>

<p>
He paused and looked around the room.
</p>

<p>
"None of what I have said up till now helps to fill the biscuit tin.
</p>

<p>
"Today is the first day of the rest of the project. We are basically at
the start of the project. There is a difference: usually, at the start
of a project, we don't know how well we can work with the customer. We
tend to assume that the customer will be moderately co-operative and
moderately competent.
</p>

<p>
"We have now had 3 months' experience with the customer. We know him to
be below par in competence and co-operation. We know that he
attributes absolutely no firmness to deadlines. Worse, he announces
deadlines and, in the same breath, assures us that these will NOT be
met.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever estimates we made 3 months ago, we now know them to be
naively optimistic. Back then, we expected to be finished in 39 mad-,
er, I mean, man-days. Consequently, we can expect this job to take
much longer than another 39 man-days.
</p>

<p>
"My guess is that it would be better value for us to cut our losses.
We were barely making money when we quoted 39 man-days. We sure in
hell are gonna lose money if the job takes another 39 plus, say 30%,
... what's that, um, ... 52 man-days.
</p>

<p>
"Can we expect the job to go better from now on? Let me tell you,
guys: I can't see it; I just don't think that it's likely.
</p>

<p>
"However, I think there is one slim possibility (even though I can't
see it happening). If, somehow, it can be arranged that someone
important from Tacco's place is in a position where his rooster is on
the solid piece of wood, there might be a chance.
</p>

<p>
"Then, there might be some resources allocated to this project. So
that, when we come into a room and discover that a wall has fallen
down, we can find someone to tell; and that person has been given the
job of keeping us going as his highest priority; and he has the
ability to either fix the wall himself or he has the resources at his
disposal to get the wall fixed.
</p>

<p>
"So that, when we get a little lost because there are so many rooms,
we can ask someone to help us navigate around the castle.
</p>

<p>
"So that there is a full-time person whose responsibility is to learn
how we prepare and paint rooms and who can help us to prepare and
paint rooms. Not because we can't do the job without him - on the
contrary, we can do the job much more quickly without him! But, the
existence of such a person serves a number of goals. First it shows a
commitment on Tacco's part. Secondly, it causes Tacco to feel some of
our pain when things get bogged down (because his person is also out
of action until the project is finished). Finally, one of Tacco's
requirements was that he wanted his staff to be able to perform
touch-up painting after we had finished.
</p>

<p>
"At the moment, we are the only one's whose roosters are vulnerable."
</p>

<p>
He stopped. Was there anything else?
</p>

<p>
"It's a huge shame, really. We started this project with a number of
technical concerns (could our painting machine handle some of the
tricky shapes in Tacco's cottage?). We passed all those tests with
flying colours. We adapted our painting machine and it is now bigger
and better than it used to be. It turns out that we haven't been able
to paint the cottage-house-mansion-castle because it isn't finished.
Technical problems were overcome with breathtaking alacrity.
</p>

<p>
"So, the last issue is: how will we look if we walk away from this
job? I can't answer categorically. I do know that we have walked away
from other customers who were unreasonable and it doesn't appear to
have hurt us. Generally, it has had a therapeutic effect on our
sanity! Because customers like that mess with your mind. They create
the suspicion that we have not given our all. They attempt to drag us
into the same pit of mediocrity and incompetence in which they lurk.
</p>

<p>
"My vote would be to call it quits.
</p>

<p>
"Can we take anything away from this debacle? I think so. I think
there is a lesson here for us for next time.
</p>

<p>
"Moral: Everyone must stand to lose a rooster."

<p>

<h3>Why this article?</h3>
	<p> The intent of this article is to exhaustively capture every step of
booting Knoppix Live CD from a PXE Server. Booting Knoppix from PXE is a
straightforward task. But here we would like to pinpoint some areas where
we faced difficulties in booting Knoppix from a PXE server so that it may be
useful for those who might be facing the same issues. We were attempting to
automate system maintenance tasks such as performing system BIOS updates,
updating firmware of system peripherals such as storage controllers, NICs,
etc. We planned to boot Knoppix from PXE and then customize it to execute
the .BIN upgrade packages (For upgrading system component firmware). We
came across the Knoppix Live CD and its' Howtos but we still hit
roadblocks which had to be sorted out before we could boot Knoppix
successfully from PXE on a Broadcom NIC-based system.</p>

<h3> Introduction:- </h3>
	<p>Knoppix is an amazing "one CD does it all" distro where you can
customize it and use it for running your customized programs. About 1900MB
of software compressed and stuck on a 700MB CD, with everything from sed to
Openoffice. Knoppix 6.2 DVD comes with lot of packages so most of the
needed programs / packages are covered in the DVD. Making it network boot
capable will be an advantage as we dont need to run around for a CD/DVD.
This article talks about how to create Knoppix Live CD/DVD PXE Boot capable
and the points to be noted if you use any Broadcom card as the PXE Bootable
NIC</p> 

<h3>Our setup:-</h3>
	<p> This article does not cover on how to create a PXE setup assuming
that the readers will have the knowledge to setup a PXE server. Refer the
following link <a
href="http://linux-sxs.org/internet_serving/pxeboot.html">for setting up a
PXE Server.</a></p>
	
<blockquote>
<h4>Requirements:-</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>A system with a CD/DVD Drive to boot Knoppix Live CD  (preferably
Knoppix 6.2.1 which is the latest release) .</li>
<li>A PXE server configured in your network. </li>
<li>A system running a NFS server. This is for holding the content of the
images that we are going to PXEBoot. The same PXE server can be used for
setting up the NFS Server for holding root filesystem.</li>
<li>Now you need the Knoppix Live CD ISO image burnt onto media. If you
have downloaded a Knoppix version of different langauage other than
English, you need to pass the param lang=us while booting to the live CD.
No one will download a different language version but it can happen. :-) </li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p><strong>That's it. You are ready to start... </strong></p>

<h3>Generating the required files - kernel (named vmlinuz)  and initrd images</h3>
	
<p>Knoppix has the built-in ability to auto-configure itself to network
boot itself, and this makes the process rather easy. Boot into the Live CD
(runlevel 5 - default one). Follow the steps to create the necessary
files:</p>
		
<ul>
<li> Start Knoppix Terminal server by going to Preferences Section in Start menu.</li>
<li>Note that this service will start DHCP server. So if you have a local
network where some other DHCP server is already running, make sure that
there is no network connection to this system till you complete creating
initrd image.</li>
<li>Follow the online instructions. During the creation of initrd and
vmlinuz, you will be prompted to "Choose network card(s) to support/probe
on client machines:". Make sure that you select all the required drivers
that you need in your client boxes. Drivers like bnx2,e1000 will be
included by default. But it's worth going through the list to include some
of the wireless drivers as well.</li>
<li>If you need root access in your client boxes, then make sure that you
disable "Secure: Disable Root access on client(s) option".</li>
<li>If you have any specific kernel parameters to be passed while booting
Knoppix on client boxes, you can even mention that in one of the steps.
Once all the above inputs are given, start running the server so that it
will create a kernel image and initrd image which contains the very limited
required drivers to boot into the client boxes.</li>
<li>Check the /tftpboot/ directory and there you can see files vmlinuz and
miniroot.gz. These are the kernel and initrd images respectively.</li>
<li>Copy these files to your PXE Server's /tftpboot/ directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Create an entry for Knoppix in your PXE Server menu  (/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default) as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>
		<dl>
		<dt>label Knoppix</dt>
    		<dt>kernel /path/to/vmlinuz</dt>
	        <dt>append nfsdir=NFS Server IP:/path/to/knoppix-CD-DVD-contents/ nodhcp lang=us ramdisk_size=100000 init=/etc/init apm=power-off nomce vga=791 initrd=/path/to/miniroot.gz</dt>
		</dl>
</strong>
<p> - where vmlinuz is the kernel image that we created from Knoppix Live
CD and miniroot.gz is the initrd image. Note that the complete Knoppix
CD/DVD contents is available at the NFS Server mentioned in the
Requirements list.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>NFS Server Configuration</h3>
<p>Installing an NFS server is beyond the scope of this document; however,
this will give you what's needed to configure your NFS server.</p>

In /etc/exports on the system (NFS Server), make sure that the share noted below is exported:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt><strong>/path/to/Knoppix-CD-DVD-contents *(ro,no_root_squash,async)</strong></dt>
	</dl></blockquote>

Note how this matches up with the initial nfsdir parameter in the
original knoppix pxelinux.cfg/default file. Do <em>exportfs -a</em> to make
the share visible to the outer world.
	
		<blockquote><dl><dt><strong>...&lt;NFS Server IP&gt;:/path/to/knoppix-CD-DVD-contents/...</strong></dt></dl></blockquote>

	<p>As mentioned above, copy the entire Knoppix CD/DVD contents to the
above-mentioned NFS share. Knoppix expects to mount a directory over NFS
and see the folder "KNOPPIX" right there. So In our NFS Server setup we
changed <em>nfsdir</em> line to match our server's IP address, and then
added an export on our NFS server as above.</p>

	<p>That's it. Your NFS Server is ready with Knoppix contents and now
it's time to boot the client boxes with Knoppix.</p>

<h3> Hold on... Do you use Broadcom Network cards as PXE Bootable devices in your client boxes??</h3>

	<p> <em>This is the heart of this article.</em> Till now you may have
seen other documentation which talks about booting Knoppix from Intel-based
PXE.  If your setup has a Broadcom-based PXE-enabled NIC, the same steps
wouldn't get you to boot your system successfully. This article highlights
why you run into those issues and how you can get rid of them.</p>
	
	<p>The Knoppix initrd image  (miniroot.gz)  is going to fail in the
client boxes where you use Broadcom cards... why? :-( Here is the
solution :-)</p>

	<p>As far as Broadcom drivers  (eg/- bnx2)  are concerned, it is
required to load the firmware image while loading bnx2 driver module to the
kernel. Under some circumstances, as explained below, it would be
interesting to keep firmware images in non-swappable kernel memory or even
in the kernel image (probably within initramfs).	   
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>
	- If the device that needs the firmware is needed to access the
	  filesystem. If due to some error the device has to be reset and the
firmware reloaded, it won't be possible to get it from userspace.</dt>
	<dt><blockquote><strong>example:-</strong> <em>A diskless client with a
network card that needs firmware. The filesystem is stored in a disk behind
a scsi device that needs firmware. This is because in our case, real
Knoppix image sits in NFS share which needs to be accessed via the NIC that
we boot the kernel and initrd image of Knoppix.</em></blockquote></dt>
	</dl>
	</blockquote>
	</p>

	So for making the Knoppix PXE Bootable in this case, you will have to
have the firmware images available in the initial ramdisk image  (initrd)
and then make it available at the time of driver load. Here are the
steps/commands with a small piece of code for doing the same :

		<ol>
		<li> You need to recreate the initrd image by having the firmware
images available in it.</li>
		<li> In your PXE Server, copy the initrd image  (miniroot.gz)  to a
temporary directory (let's create /tmp/temp_knoppix in the PXE Server
itself).</li>
		<li> Unzip the initrd image copied to the temporary directory using
<em>gunzip miniroot.gz</em></li>
		<li> Extract the contents of initrd image using <em>cpio -id < miniroot</em></li>
			<blockquote>- Note that this command will extract miniroot cpio
package and hence it would be better to create a temporary directory and
extract the contents to it.</blockquote>
		<li> Now you can see a bunch of directories created in the
temporary directory.Create a directory for copying the firmware image </li>
		<li><em>cd /tmp/temp_knoppix</em></li>
		<li><em>mkdir lib/firmware/ -p</em></li>
		<li><em>Copy the firmware images from Knoppix Live CD to the initrd image using scp </em></li>
			<blockquote> - Note that it's better to copy the whole
<em>lib/firmware</em> directory to initrd as there are different firmware
images of different drivers. In the future it will help if you want to make use
of same initrd for different devices.</blockquote>
		<li>Once firmware images are copied create a hotplug script to load
the firmware image to the kernel when insmod is called. Create a directory
sbin in initrd image using <em>mkdir sbin/</em></li>
		<li> Create a script named <em>hotplug</em> inside the sbin directory.
The content of the script is as below:
		<pre class="code">
	
		#!/bin/sh
		[ -z "$FIRMWARE" ] &amp;&amp; exit 
		echo 1 &gt; /sys/$DEVPATH/loading
		cat /lib/firmware/bnx2/$FIRMWARE &gt; /sys/$DEVPATH/data
		echo 0 &gt; /sys/$DEVPATH/loading

the miniroot.gz initrd image to add your own programs and executables such
that you create your own live CD booting from PXE Server.</p>

	<p> There are lot of advantages as you can test your own program if any
during/after bootup, with out installing it on any OS. This is completely
driven out of NFS share! This setup can be used extensively in academic
institutions, schools and for hands-on sessions in workshops with addition
of ample custom settings.</p>

<h1>Procmail/GMail-based spam filtering</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
In the past month or so, I've had a chance to develop and polish a simple
but highly effective anti-spam system. My requirements, and my reason for
developing it, form a rather narrow and specific niche - my network
connectivity situation is quite unusual, rather similar to what a lot of
road warriors encounter - but the solution is nicely generalized and usable
by anyone with a GMail account and running Linux. It's very fast and not at
all CPU-intensive (unlike most anti-spam solutions), and so far, it has an
excellent track record for accuracy (zero false positives, very small
number of false negatives once past the initial test cycle.) At this point,
it looks stable enough that I feel like sharing it with the Linux community
is worthwhile; it also has enough flexibility for any experimentation that
you may want to do.
</p>

<h3>First Steps</h3>
<p>
Some time ago, I posted a question on the Linux Gazette's <a
href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">Answer Gang</a> list; I was
looking for a solution to my somewhat unusual situation which had left me
stumped for a number of years. In essence, it came down to this: given that
I travel and move around a lot, and thus have unpredictable and often
fragile and/or slow connectivity, how do I filter spam effectively?
</p>

<p>
The general gist of that conversation came down to exactly what I had
learned and expected over the years of struggling with this topic:
</p>

<ul>
<li> If you want to have a state-of-the-art spam filtering solution -
e.g., SMTP-time rejection - you need excellent connectivity and a static
IP address.
<li> Closer to the user level, if you want to do local filtering - e.g.,
SpamAssassin - you need a fair amount of CPU horsepower; good
connectivity is also important if you want to use a blacklist. This
approach is not nearly as effective as the first solution; the spammers'
development of mails that bypass these filters appears to be outpacing the
filter updates (a losing game similar to the anti-virus update tail chase,
familiar to every Microsoft <strike>sufferer</strike> user.)
<li> Using an external mail service - i.e., "farming out" the job of the
above to people who do have the required resources - comes with a a price
tag: you either have to pay a fee to have decent access to email (an
annoyance, at least), or you have to compromise your privacy concerns.
Neither one, at least when taken in whole, seems appealing - but neither of
the first two options work for me either, given my situation and my
unwillingness to continue <a
href="http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/editorials/dumb/">enumerating badness</a>.
Since there was no standard answer that would fit, I had to come up with
one of my own.
</ul>

<h3>The Base State</h3>
<p>
I had been using SpamAssassin for several years - but in the last couple of
months, the frequency of spam mails that it let through became intolerable,
despite the best tuning I could do. In addition, it filtered out a number
of valid emails - i.e., false positives - which was a much worse problem,
with a much greater hassle attached to it: every few days, I had to do a
visual scan of my spam inbox hoping to spot valid emails before my eyes
glazed over from zooming over thousands of messages (and I'm convinced that
I've lost at least a few due to those factors.) All of this added up to a
simple imperative: I <em>had</em> to either change my spam-filtering
approach or resign myself to my email becoming progressively less useful
and less reliable. The latter was not an option, since most of my business
is either done via, or at least partially involves, email.
</p>

<h3>The Makeover</h3>
<p>
Initially, I started experimenting with a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge-response_spam_filtering">challenge-response</a>
system. The basic premise of such a system is that it depends on two lists
containing email addresses - a whitelist (i.e., all emails from that
address are accepted) and a blacklist (all emails from that address are
discarded.) Anything in between gets tagged and held, while a one-time
confirmation message is sent back to the sender's address; if they reply,
that address gets added to the whitelist and their message is released.
</p>

<p>
This was an OK solution - but I was unhappy about the additional load that
it generated, both in the number of emails necessary as well as the
necessity of taking the sender's time. The latter, by the way, is usually
used as the standard reason for not implementing C-R more widely: it is
ostensibly "offensive" to people to get and answer confirmation messages.
The standard scenario portrays the outraged receiver deleting the
confirmation email in a huff (or perhaps printing it out, throwing it on
the ground, and jumping up and down on it in a rage until it's all shredded
or they have a stroke due to apoplexy.) Personally, I strongly disagree
with that so-called "reasoning" and find <strong>it</strong> offensive:
anyone who does not consider communicating with me to be of enough value
that they can't hit 'Reply' <em>once</em> is unwelcome in my mailbox in the
first place. However, as a personal preference, I dislike adding to
anyone's workload - no matter in how miniscule the fashion - without a good
reason, and if it can be avoided at no cost to me, and no reduction of
functionality in my spam filtering, I'll be happy to do it.
</p>

<p>
In that light, one of the responses from The Answer Gang really piqued my
interest: <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/authors/sbrown.html">Steve
Brown</a>'s idea of using GMail as an external filter (thanks, Steve!) I
decided to combine the best features of C-R and external filtering to
create my ultimate solution, which eliminated the response requirement.
Although it took quite a bit of experimenting initially, the results have
been excellent.
</p>

<p>
For comparison purposes, here's how the new system stacked up against my
tweaked-to-the-max SpamAssassin system. It may be relevant to note that, as
the Editor-in-Chief of LG, I'm in a rather exposed position, spam-wise: my
email address is out there in hundreds of thousands of places, and I
usually make no attempt to disguise it. As a result, I get ~1000 messages
per day, with 98-99% of those being spam. Pretty ugly... but on the other
hand, it makes for a great test bed: either my solutions work really well,
or they fail abysmally. That's a test environment that's really meaningful!
</p>

</table>

<p>
Again, this system has only been in operation for a little over a month -
but the results, once I was done tuning it, have been rock-stable. For
myself, I'm pretty excited about it: the countless hours that I've spent
tuning and retuning SpamAssassin and looking through the spam bucket to see
if it mis-identified something are now just a bad memory. I still check the
"all incoming mail" list from my current system once in a while (more and
more rarely as time goes on), just to confirm that I'm not tossing any
valid emails - but given the mechanism that's in use, I feel pretty secure
about it not discarding any email without me having explicitly asked it to
do so. That's a very, very good feeling.
</p>

<h3>Setting it all up</h3>
<p>
The initial part of setting up the system, whether C-R or otherwise,
consists of creating all the relevant files - primarily, the whitelist and
the blacklist. In the configuration section of the .procmailrc file that
I'll make available at the end of this article, you can call them whatever
you like; for myself, I used '~/.mail-accept-list' and
'~/.mail-deny-list', respectively. I also created a list of symlinks to all
the relevant files so I could look at them easily right from my home
directory:
</p>

<pre>
MAIL-ACCEPT-LIST	-&gt;	~/.mail-accept-list
MAIL-DENY-LIST		-&gt;	~/.mail-deny-list
MAIL_PROCMAILRC		-&gt;	~/.procmailrc
MAIL_PROCMAIL_LOG	-&gt;	/var/log/procmail
MAIL_SAVE_ALL		-&gt;	~/.mail_save_all
</pre>

<p>
The names are, I hope, obvious indicators of the function of each file. If
you're not familiar with "procmail", it is a very powerful and
commonly-used email processor written by Stephen R. van den Berg. It uses
'~/.procmailrc' as its configuration file; this is composed of "recipes"
that determine how to process mail. My system is constructed of those
recipes, plus a few external files and system utilities.
</p>

<p>
Before we go on to that, though, we'll need to populate the whitelist and
the blacklist. If, like me, you've been saving your email - and I've got
more than 20 years of mail archives - that's not too hard; all we need to
do for the initial whitelist is extract the addresses of anyone who has
ever written to me as well as those to whom I've written. (Yes, it's
possible that some of those will need to be blacklisted later - but that's
so simple that it's not worth worrying about.) I used a combination of
shell scripting, "formail", and Perl to do the extraction <a
id="okopnik.html_1_back"></a><a href="#okopnik.html_1">[1]</a>. Since I've
learned over the years that various mail clients do some really ugly things
to mail headers, I use extreme caution and circumspection in processing
them; in most cases, this means a "belt-and-suspenders" sort of an
approach. In this case, I'm using "formail" to concatenate ('-c') continued
fields in the header and split ('-s') the mboxes into individual emails,
and Perl to extract either the 'From:' address (preferred) or, failing
that, the 'Return-Path:' address.
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Mon Jun 28 15:31:08 EDT 2010

# 'cd' to your mail directory
cd ~Mail

for file in *	
do
	# Ignore all directories and the "Sent_mail" file (we'll process that later)
	[ "$file" == "Sent_mail" -o -d "$file" ] &amp;&amp; continue
    echo "Processing '$file'"
	formail -cs \
		perl -wlne'$f=$1 if /^(?:return-path|from):.*?([\w\.=\-]+@[\w\.=\-]+\w+)/i;print $f and last if /^$/' \
		&lt; "$file" &gt;&gt; /tmp/whitelist
done

# Process the mail that I've sent; this time, we'll extract the 'To:' headers
echo "Processing the 'Sent_mail' file"
formail -cs \
	perl -wlne';print $1 and last if /^To:.*?([\w\.=\-]+@[\w\.=\-]+\w+)/i' \
	&lt; Sent_mail &gt;&gt; /tmp/whitelist

sort -u /tmp/whitelist -o /tmp/whitelist
</pre>

<p>
So there it is; a list of all my "validated" email addresses collected into
a single file (/tmp/whitelist). Note the last line: this produces a list of
sorted addresses with no repeats. Not all that complex, right?
</p>

<p>
The blacklist is even less complicated. Since we're going to stamp all our
outgoing email with a special header that identifies it as really being
from us, the first thing we'll put into the blacklist is... all our valid
email addresses. No fooling. Seems a bit counterintuitive, but that's
exactly what we need to do - because spammers very often send their stuff
with it being marked as coming <em>from</em> the same address they're
sending it <em>to</em>. This approach gets rid of that very large category,
painlessly and safely. You'll see precisely how this works as we go through
the .procmailrc file.
</p>

<p>
Next, let's take a look at the .procmailrc file itself. Mine has a few
things in it besides the anti-spam system, so I'll highlight just the bits
that we're discussing. Let's take a look (ignore the line numbers; they're
not part of the code, and are there just so I can refer to a given line):
</p>

<pre class='code'>
<font color='#999999'>001</font>	PATH
<font color='#999999'>002</font>	SHELL=/bin/sh
<font color='#999999'>003</font>	MAILDIR=/var/spool/mail
<font color='#999999'>004</font>	DEFAULT=$LOGNAME
<font color='#999999'>005</font>	LOGFILE=/var/log/procmail
<font color='#999999'>006</font>	# VERBOSE=on
<font color='#999999'>007</font>	
<font color='#999999'>008</font>	# This gives you the 'From:' address if it's available, or the 'Return-Path:' address otherwise.
<font color='#999999'>009</font>	:0 hw
<font color='#999999'>010</font>	FROM=|/usr/bin/perl -wlne'$f=$1 if /^(?:return-path|from):.*?([\w\.=\-]+@[\w\.=\-]+\w+)/i;print $f and last if /^$/'
</pre>

<p>
The first six lines just set up the procmail variables. The only bits to
note are that you may not necessarily want your procmail logfile to be in
/var/log (in fact, you'd need root permissions to set that up); also,
'VERBOSE=on' is currently commented out but still there in case you want to
enable it for troubleshooting. When enabled, it produces a lot of output in
the logfile, and can be very useful. Line 10 is, of course, the sender
address extractor that we used to such good effect earlier.
<p>

<p>
Now, let's jump right to the spam filter:
</p>

<pre class='code'>
<font color='#999999'>011</font>	#************* GMAIL-BASED ANTI-SPAM SYSTEM **************
<font color='#999999'>012</font>	#
<font color='#999999'>013</font>	# Customize all these constants as necessary:

<font color='#999999'>016</font>	# Spam-Kill stamp; use some unique string without spaces

<font color='#999999'>018</font>	# "Secret word" for email control messages
<font color='#999999'>019</font>	SECRET=Funky
<font color='#999999'>020</font>	
<font color='#999999'>021</font>	FORMAIL=/usr/bin/formail
<font color='#999999'>022</font>	GREP=/bin/grep
<font color='#999999'>023</font>	SENDMAIL=/home/ben/bin/bssmtp
<font color='#999999'>024</font>	
<font color='#999999'>025</font>	DB=$HOME/.mail-accept-list
<font color='#999999'>026</font>	DENY_DB=$HOME/.mail-deny-list
<font color='#999999'>027</font>	NOTIFY=$HOME/Mail/000-notify
<font color='#999999'>028</font>	NDNS=$HOME/Mail/000-ndns
<font color='#999999'>029</font>	TRASH=/dev/null
<font color='#999999'>030</font>	SAVE_ALL=$HOME/.mail_save_all
<font color='#999999'>031</font>
</pre>

<p>
This is the configuration section - pretty straightforward stuff. You'll
need to put in your email address and your GMail address; you'll also need
to come up with a couple of unique strings (don't worry; these aren't the
real ones that I use. :) You could, of course, use the same string - but
$SECRET should be something that's easy to type out on, say, your
Blackberry whenever you want to validate someone on the spot (we'll see how
this works in a moment.)
</p>

<p>
$DB is your whitelist; $DENY_DB is the blacklist. $NOTIFY - assuming you
want to set that up - is mail that you regularly receive (say, monthly
notifications from your listbots) but don't want to read; archiving is good
enough. $NDNS are Non-Delivery Notifications; for now, I'm collecting those,
looking through them monthly, and then tossing them. In another month or
so, I'll just trash them, but for now, I'm still in a testing phase.
$SAVE_ALL is another testing phase sort of thing: it saves <em>all</em>
received email, just so I can go over it and check that everything is
getting filtered correctly. Sooner or later, it too is going to disappear.
</p>
 

<pre class='code'>
<font color='#999999'>033</font>	# Immediately deliver anything containing my verification string (the
<font color='#999999'>034</font>	# header is added to all outgoing email via my .muttrc). You should now add
<font color='#999999'>035</font>	# all your email addresses to the blacklist, since anything "from you" that
<font color='#999999'>036</font>	# fails this test is spam.
<font color='#999999'>037</font>	:0:
<font color='#999999'>038</font>	* $ X-Spam-Kill: $SPAM_KILL
<font color='#999999'>039</font>	${DEFAULT}
</pre>

<p>
This is the gadget that delivers all the real email that comes from us;
since I use "mutt" for my email client, I simply set it up to add a header
with that stamp - i.e., 'X-Spam-Kill: ' followed by my $SPAM_KILL string.
This bypasses pretty much all the tests and goes right into my inbox.
</p>

<pre class='code'>
<font color='#999999'>041</font>	# This should be either empty, or a regex that matches any addresses from
<font color='#999999'>042</font>	# which you get lots of mail that you want to archive but not read:
<font color='#999999'>043</font>	BOTS=(mailman-owner@list1.com|mailman-owner@list2.com)
</pre>

<p>
Right - this is what we'll be archiving without reading.
</p>

<pre class='code'>
<font color='#999999'>045</font>	# This should be a regex that matches all domains from which you know you
<font color='#999999'>046</font>	# won't get spammed:
<font color='#999999'>047</font>	KNOWN_DOMAINS=(safedomain1.com|safedomain2.com|safedomain3.com)$
<font color='#999999'>048</font>	
<font color='#999999'>049</font>	# This should be either empty, or a regex that matches the To: headers of
<font color='#999999'>050</font>	# any mailing lists you're on:
<font color='#999999'>051</font>	LISTS=(list1@lists.net|lists2@lists.net|list@yahoo.com|list@lists.mail.org)
</pre>

<p>
Another rather obvious one. If you use Mutt, like I do, simply copy your
'lists' line here and modify it so that it becomes a valid regular
expression, like the above.
</p>

<p>
All right, here comes the meat of the "program" itself:
</p>

<pre class='code'>
<font color='#999999'>053</font>	####################################################################
<font color='#999999'>054</font>	# Don't change anything below unless you know why you're doing it! #

</pre>

<p>
This line saves everything into the file we defined earlier.

<p>
These two recipes allow you to whitelist or blacklist an address by mail:
just send yourself an email with the secret word that you defined above,
followed by a dash and either the word 'approve' or 'deny' followed by a
space and the email address that you want to define. Nice little feature -
not that I use it much.
</p>

<pre class='code'>
<font color='#999999'>075</font>	# If message is from a blacklisted sender, dump it
<font color='#999999'>076</font>	:0 h
<font color='#999999'>077</font>	# * ? $GREP -i ^$FROM $DENY_DB
<font color='#999999'>078</font>	* ? echo $FROM|$GREP -f $DENY_DB
<font color='#999999'>079</font>	${TRASH}
</pre>

<p>
Other than the "whitelist/blacklist by email" functionality, note this
recipe that takes precedence over everything else: if someone is
blacklisted, they're <strong>gone</strong>. Doesn't matter if they're on a
whitelisted mailing list that you're subscribed to or anything else; once
they earn a place in that file, you'll never see them again.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, note the commented-out line (#77): originally, I used the
email address as the "grep" search string and the file as the source, and
if the string was found in the file, then that was the end of it. However,
I discovered that there were times when I wanted to block an entire domain,
or use a regular expression to define exactly what I wanted to block - but
this was not possible with that recipe! After that, I changed my approach
to the one on line #78: I pipe the address into "grep" and use the content
of $DENY_DB as the list of regular expressions to check against that
string. This allows me to put in, e.g., '@spammer.org' and block that whole
domain, or 'joe_slick' and block all addresses containing that string. Do
be careful, though: if you accidentally add something like a space to that
file, you'll throw away <em>all</em> email!

<p>
As the comment says, this is for all emails that have been validated by
GMail. Anything with the 'X-Gstamp:' header (which we add in the next
recipe) simply gets delivered.
</p>

<font color='#999999'>122</font>	#********** END OF GMAIL-BASED ANTI-SPAM SYSTEM **********
</pre>

<p>
If an email has made it through all of the above recipes without
being dumped or delivered, then we don't know what it is (ham or spam) - so
we'll let GMail decide for us. In theory, this minimizes our privacy
exposure, since we should have already whitelisted the people who are
likely to send us that kind of important info. Best of all worlds!
</p>

<p>
Again, the average .procmailrc file will have other things in it -
perhaps header fixups for friends with seriously broken email clients, or
logic to decide which listmail should go into which mailboxes. If you know
how to write procmail recipes, this is all still usable: filters (such as
the header fixups) would go just below the procmail variable definitions
(say, just below line 10), and list distribution recipes might replace the
simple "list delivery" recipe (98-102). If you don't know how, it's
relatively simple - and the documentation that comes with procmail is
excellent and detailed (see 'man procmail', 'man procmailrc', and 'man
procmailex' for lots of good examples and explanations.)
</p>

<h3>Usage notes</h3>
<p>
I use "fetchmail" for mail retrieval, so setting that up was pretty
trivial: I just grab the mail from my mailhost and from GMail via POP (the
latter requires changing the settings at GMail, which is pretty simple.)
Since I use Mutt as my mail client, I've added a convenient shortcut to it
which allows me to blacklist spam instantly; in fact, it replaced the
"spam, not ham" shortcut that I had been using for SpamAssassin. Here are
the necessary entries in ~/.muttrc, in case you happen to be using Mutt
yourself:
</p>

<pre>
macro index \cb |"/home/ben/bin/blacklist^M"
macro pager \cb |"/home/ben/bin/blacklist^M"
</pre>

<p>
So, if I ever do run across a spam that managed to make it through GMail,
all I have to do is hit 'Ctrl-B' - and that address is gone forever. The
script that it invokes is a pretty simple one:
</p>

<pre class='code'>
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Tue May 11 23:32:58 EDT 2010

FROM=$(perl -wlne'print $1 and last if /^From:\s*.*?([\w\.\-]+@[\w\.\-]+\w+)/')
if [ -n "$FROM" ]
then
	sed -i '/^'"$FROM"'$/d' ~/.mail-accept-list
	echo $FROM &gt;&gt; ~/.mail-deny-list
fi	
</pre>

<p>
Note that if that entry exists in the whitelist, it'll be removed from
there. Oh, one more thing for .muttrc: there's also the 'X-Spam-Kill:'
header that marks the email as <strong>actually</strong> coming from me.
</p>

<pre>
# No, this is still not my real X-Spam-Kill string. :)
send-hook ~A 'my_hdr X-Spam-Kill: 74d04eab1341a01117de96f2'
</pre>

<h3>Wrap-up</h3>
<p>
Taken all together, this forms an easy to use, effective spam killer; I've
recovered a number of hours that I used to waste in dealing with spam, and
have reduced the wear-and-tear on my nerves caused by finding the
occasional business email in my spambox. All in all, I'm really glad that
I've spent the time developing and implementing this system.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to <a href="misc/okopnik/procmailrc">download my .procmailrc
file</a> and experiment. I've got to say that I'm pretty excited about this
whole system: previously, while retrieving email in the morning, I used to
watch my poor little netbook bogging down as SpamAssassin overloaded its
tiny brain. In addition, processing even a hundred emails took at least
five minutes. Now, when I try to watch my mail log via 'tail -f
/var/log/mail.info, the emails fly through the processing so fast that I'd
have to be a speed reader to catch them all. The major delay factor in
retrieving them is simply the bandwidth/latency of whatever connection I
happen to have.
</p>

<p>
In the near future, once I'm completely satisfied with all the testing, I'm
going to try moving this setup off my local system and onto my mail server
- given its nature, it's certainly flexible enough to work that way. This
will mean using the whitelist/blacklist-by-mail feature and adapting the
"blacklist" script to work over the network, or perhaps simply synchronizing
the local and the remote lists via a cronjob - but it will also mean
<strong>much</strong> less traffic between my local machine and that
mailhost, since all the blacklisted mail will get dumped without me ever
downloading it. The GMail-bound traffic will also be sent off from there,
meaning that my system will never have to do that round-robin transaction
either, so the only thing I'll see is whitelist-validated and
GMail-filtered stuff - perhaps a 100-to-1 reduction in volume. I'm really
looking forward to that.
</p>

<p>
Overall, this experiment has made large, positive, time-saving changes in
my life; a huge improvement over my previous spam-handling method. Hurrah
for Linux and the ability to tweak, play, and experiment!
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<a id="okopnik.html_1"></a><a href="#okopnik.html_1_back">[1]</a> I could
have done this with Perl alone, but I have an additional purpose here: the
Perl one-liner that I used is also a nice tool that we can re-use in our
.procmailrc - we definitely need to extract the address from each email,
right? - so we might as well start using it here.

<h1>Linux: The Mom &amp; Pop's Operating System</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>This month's article isn't much of an article, but more like an interview. 
It's not very technical, but potentially satisfying. True or False? 
If you have been around Linux for a few years, you may have been called an 
open source advocate, a computer guy or just a plain and simple nerd. 
Probably true, right? For years, that's how Linux has been seen by many outside 
the open source community, and even a few within it. This article, I mean 
interview, is a living example that this stereotype does not stand true any 
longer.</p>

<p>About 15 years ago, when I first arrived in the US as an exchange student, 
I met a family in a small town called Hampden, ME. Over the years, I became 
friends with this family, saw their kids graduate from High School and College, 
and even lived as neighbors to their parents for about three years of my life. 
The person I am writing about is my good friend Brenda McCleary, a mother of 
two college graduates who decided to give Linux a try.
</p>

<p>I also want to emphasize that I have done very little editing on this 
interview because I want to show the reader that one must not have to know all 
the right terminology or Linux versions and distributions to be able to start 
using it.
</p>


<p><strong>Anderson: Hi, Brenda, tell us a little bit about yourself.</strong>
<br>
<strong>Brenda:</strong> Hi, Anderson. I've been married 31 years to husband 
John. I am the mother of two adult sons: Patrick (26) and DJ (24). I live in 
Simpsonville, SC. I have worked cleaning homes, been a church secretary, an 
administrative assistant in a denturist office, and currently in the food 
service industry as dishwasher/baker/prep person.</p>

<p><strong>A: When was the first time you heard about Linux?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> I heard about Linux from you Anderson.</p>

<p><em>[Note: Yes, I've been using Linux since 1996, and virtually every time I 
hear someone complaining about their Windows machine being infected with 
whatever destructive technology is out there, my reply is usually: You should
 give Linux a try...]</em></p>

<p><strong>A: What made you want to switch from Windows to Linux?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> I switched to Linux because you recommended it and because 
I was tired of Windows not running properly. I often dealt with viruses and 
having to buy a new computer more often than I should because after a few 
times of trying to restore Windows it would no longer work. You convinced me 
that Linux was user-friendly and that I wouldn't have to worry about viruses 
like I did with Windows. You also explained that there would be some learning 
curve in using this new Operating System and that some applications or hardware 
that I currently use may not be compatible.</p>

<p><strong>A: What Linux distribution and version are you using?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> I am currently using Ubuntu 10.4?? It is the latest upgrade 
that Update manager offered. Is this right Anderson?</p>

<p><em>[Note: Ubuntu 10.04]</em></p>

<p><strong>A: Tell me about your biggest frustration with Linux.</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> My biggest frustration with Linux is the simple things like 
trying to upgrade my Garmin. I did research on-line to try and see how to fix 
the problem but because of my lack of education concerning words like bzip, 
tarballs, source codes and such. It may as well be Greek or Latin and I gave up 
not knowing what to do. I finally had my son upgrade it on his computer with 
Windows.</p>

<p><em>[Another problem that I had, but not related to Linux itself, but more of
 a vendor support issue was:]</em> When I first received my computer from Dell 
with Linux OS I was so excited. I could not however get the DVD to work. I 
called Dell and after many conversations, being transferred to different 
sections of the company and was asked to reinstall the OS system twice, that 
didn't fix the problem, I hung up angry and frustrated. Dell does not give 
customer support for Linux. I finally sent my husband and my computer to your 
home and you had it fixed in less than a hour. If the fix was that easy why 
couldn't they help me?</p>

<p><strong>A: Have you ever used the Linux terminal? If yes, what did you do 
with it?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> I have tried to use the Linux terminal using step by step 
instructions based on on-line articles by other Linux users. To be honest I 
don't remember what it was I was trying to fix, but I do remember when the 
terminal accepted my codes, copied line for line from the article, I was 
tickled pink!</p>

<p><strong>A: Have you ever had to upgrade your computer by yourself? If yes, 
what was the experience like?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> I recently upgraded my computer through the Update manager
 which automatically lets me know when there are updates and upgrades to be
 installed. Just a few clicks of the mouse and the update or upgrade is
 finished. So much easier than Windows! After the upgrade there were a couple
 annoying glitches, but they were soon worked out with new updates.</p>


<p><strong>A: Tell us a bit about what you do with Linux at home? Anyone else in
 the family use it? What do they do?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> The two major reasons I use my computer is to access e-mail 
and Facebook. I also do on-line searches, upload pictures from my camera with 
F-Spot photo manager, listen to music on Rhythmbox, type documents on Open 
Office, and create CD's on the CD/DVD creator. Synaptic Package Manager has also
 been a useful tool..as well as Users and Groups. I especially enjoy it that I 
can log into my own account and not have to deal with family members bookmarks 
or icons that they choose to use on their desktop screen. My husband also uses 
Linux for e-mail and Facebook, paying bills on-line and doing on-line searches 
to read news from our home state, Maine.</p>

<p><strong>A: What's your favorite part about using Linux?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> My favorite part about using Linux is not having to deal 
with viruses, cookies and not having to worry about when the OS is going to die.
 It is a stable, trustworthy system that I hope in time will be more and more 
compatible with Windows so that many other simple people like myself can enjoy 
the many benefits of using Linux without the frustration of certain things being
 incompatible. Although I do have to say that the upgrades to newer versions of 
Linux seem to fix some problems automatically which means Linux is aware of the 
incompatibility issues and is taking action. </p>

<strong>A: Do you feel you've learned more about computers using Linux? 
Why?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> I do not regret moving away from Windows as the benefits of 
Linux far outweigh the frustrations experienced in some things not being 
compatible and how to fix them. Of course it is especially helpful when I can 
Facebook you, Anderson, with questions.</p>

<p><strong>A: Well, Brenda, thank you so much for taking the time to share with 
us about your Linux experience. One final question, if you had to recommend 
Linux to another mother like yourself, how would you 'sell' it?</strong><br>
<strong>B:</strong> I would definitely recommend Linux to other mothers because 
of the many benefits I have explained in this interview. I would however 
recommend to them that they do their research concerning compatibility issues 
of hardware and software they are currently using to make sure the change would 
best fit their needs. I would also recommend that they also find a current Linux
 user that could help them through the transition in case they run into the same
 problem I did of no customer support from the seller. You are welcome.</p>

<p>My friend Brenda McCleary has been a  Linux user for a little over two 
years now, and every once in a while I check in with her via Facebook to check 
out her level of satisfaction with it, and even though I, myself, am a Fedora 
user, I try to make myself available for her when she has questions about 
how to get something working. But I have to confess that Brenda has been flying 
solo with her Linux install for several months now without any major incidents.
</p>

<p>The Linux Operating System has definietly grown up, and so have its users. We
are not all just College kids with nothing better to do than hack on our 
computers trying to solve a programming problem. A lot of us are ordinary folks
with a simple wish: when I get in front of a computer, I want to connect with 
others, share media, and even work without having to keep fighting viruses, 
malware, trojans, etc. Not to say, that Linux is a safe haven, yet, in 
comparison to Windows, it is safe enough.</p>

<em>
<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?
</p>
