Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I'm going to be teaching a class next week in which the student machines
are going to have Fedora Core 6 installed on them, so the poor on-site
tech guy is going to be spending his weekend flipping the 6 installation
CDs among a dozen-plus machines - not a happy-fun thing at all, as I see
it.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know of a way to set up an "install server" for FC6? Perhaps
I've been spoiled by the Solaris 'jumpstart' system, where you set up a
simple config file, tell your hosts to load from the jump server, and
walk away - but I can't help feeling that anything Solaris can do, Linux
can do better. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

On Redhat/Fedora, this is called "kickstart".

Red Hat calls it 'kickstart'. Google for kickstart install server and you should
find plenty of instructions.

Thanks, Thomas - I remembered something called 'PXE', but Googling for
this just took me down the "You're in a maze of twisty passages, all
alike" route - I wasn't getting anywhere, and constantly felt like I was
about to be eaten by a grue. Much appreciated.

Got it, thanks.
</p>

<p>
I think - having reviewed the instructions for the process - that the
on-site guy is stuck flipping CDs. He's mostly a Wind0ws type; the last
time I taught a class at that site, I walked him through installing
Ubuntu (he was shocked at how quick and easy that was...), and I really
doubt that he's up to writing a Kickstart file - I took a look at a
sample that I found on the Net, and it seems like the up-front cost
would be higher than doing this one-time task. Oh well...
</p>

<p>
I appreciate the help, guys.
</p>

After a manual install, anaconda will dump a kickstart file with the
options used in /root . You might be able to modify that for him.

"Aye, there's the rub!" <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> If I was there, it would be a different thing
indeed. As it is, I won't be there until late Sunday - a bit late for
all that. I was just trying to find a way to make the guy's life a bit
easier.

<p>
I will mention it to him, though. If there are going to be a lot of
these in the future, it would make sense for him to learn the process.

At the school we use kickstart via pxe boot. We will be  moving to
cobbler
<a href="http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/08/10/cobbler-how-to-set-up-a-network-boot-server-in-10-minutes/">http://www.redhatmagazine.com/2007/08/10/cobbler-how-to-set-up-a-network-boot-server-in-10-minutes/</a>
I have set it up and it is an excellent approach to the problem. I would
install one machine like Thomas has stated and use the kickstart from
it. Our automated installs take 7 minutes for a full student build of
RHEL 4 via pxe kickstart.

<p>
Best,

Cool! The article describes a nice, simple system for doing this; I'll
recommend it and see how that goes. Thanks, Joey!

Be aware to setup DHCP too and make the clients the IPs from there.
Otherwise, if you just plainly use the /root/kickstart, you will end
up with nodes using same IP.

<p>
Also carefully check the partitioning scheme.... especially if you
want to keep certain partition s in the machines.

Another tips, better use HTTP or FTP sharing, because that would be

Sure. This isn't a tragedy by any means, since it's fairly easy to fix,

<p>
It's interesting that you say that. NFS has many faults, in my opinion -
but being slow isn't one that I've run into, even with the encrypted
version. Although I must admit that pretty much all of my NFS experience
has been with Solaris rather than Linux.
