Is it possible? Another forums told me that it was! They told me it was
yet it will not. Whenever a sync is attempted the PDA tells me that a
connection "could not be established".  What could I download in it's
stead that I don't have to fiddle-faddle with? Perhaps it isn't reading
the USB correctly. If I open the hardware browserand click 'USB Devices'
it gives me a manufacturer and a driver (usb-uhci) but no device.  Any
help you can give me would be very much appreciated. Once I learn more
how would I go about joining your team? I want to help others later who
are in the same predicament that I am now

Hi,
</P>
<P>
My computer version is redhat 7.1.I had two xeon
processors inside.  (8*512GHz)  I am using gnome as my
window manager.
</P>
<P>
It frezees randomly (like once a week or twice or thrice)
and I can not do anything other than use the power swtich
to reboot it though mouse is moving but it is not doing
anything on the screen.  Hardaware diganstic test, I did
with a CD sayhing that there is no error.
</P>
<P>
I though it would be a temperature problem,but in UK
the temperature is not so hot and there are six fan
inside the cpu.I put an extra fan as well, it does not
help.
</P>
<P>
I have used the cpu memory and tempertaute controller
in linux to monitor the temp. chnages but it reveale
normal temperture. I have not got any clue and why. I
consult some body but most of the people are unware
about the OS and the problems.
</P>
<P>
SO it would be helpful If you could tell me
sugesstions and ideas.
</P>
<P>

Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My manager wants me to setup the network so that based on userid and IP
address (more so userid) you can print anywhere in the building, or just to
the printer in the room. I am doing this at a school. Any ideas as to how
that can be accomplished?

Really need more information in order to answer your question. What
types of computers are on the network, what types of print servers, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Cheers
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
The network consists of a server (RH 7.3) with about 50 ThinkNICs (diskless
workstations) booting via PXE into Linux. The printers consist of HP
DeskJets in the classroom hooked to JetDirect boxes, a LJ 4100 DTN with JD
built in, and a Xerox Document Centre 425.

To be clearer, I have glibc-2.2.93 installed which contains versions up
to and including 2.3

Hi Linux gang,
I am a fairly recent convert to Linux, I am currently running
a Win98 (boo hiss) and Redhat 7.2 dual boot system.
</P>

I wonder if you could help me?
After delving through your back issues I came to number 75 and
part one of a very interesting article about Alan Turing.
What happened to part 2?
Regards and thankyou for the magazine.

I realy enjoy finding new ways to code something with examples that actualy
work!
</P>
<P>
This notion came to me after I found the artical on "Adding Plugin
Capabilities To Your Code" By Tom Bradley.  Except for a implicit cast and
some missing header file includes, the code worked like a charm.
</P>
<P>
I usualy find it difficult to find code that does what it says it does and
is in a simple an understandable fasion.  I have been impressed.  I
expect (read hope) to see more of this in the rest of your issues!

Thanks.

Hi Heather,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The use of daemon/demon in Operating Systems goes back to
the early 1960's.   I did some further checking on the web and
found that it was used by the team at Project MAC around 1963
(see <A HREF="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/Daemon.html"
	>http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/Daemon.html</A>).  On that web page
Fenando Corbato attributes the inspiration to Maxwell's daemons.
He says "Maxwell's daemon was an imaginary agent which helped
sort molecules of different speeds and worked tirelessly in
the background. We fancifully began to use the word daemon to
describe background processes which worked tirelessly to perform
system chores.".  There is also a notion of "demon" in Artificial
Intelligence; that was where I heard about the etymology from
Selfridge's paper from 1958.  I thought that Selfridge's work
inspired their use in operating systems (since his paper was
so early), but I should have done some more checking.  In any
case the concept of "daemon" in operating systems predates
BSD by some time.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Bob
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks for the extra effort to chase that down. It's cool to learn
about these things!  Forwarding to the Answer Gang so they get to
see it, and so I can get it added into The Mailbag for this month.
</P>
<P>
Have a great day
</P>

Hi Rick. I normally don't post on <TT>/.</TT> but I read this there quite often and
somehow this also applies in your case:

Hi Heather,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Just a minor correction on the advice you gave the laddie asking about
Net2Phone.  The .za is South Africa's TLD. In case you're interested (and
I admit that you may not be), in the 19th century the Afrikaners used to
call South Africa, Zuid Afrika in the Dutch-descended Afrikaans. So that's
where SA becomes ZA, leaving SA for Saudi Arabia? (I think).
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Funny, I though we did publish a correction about that in the same Mailbag
item.  It must have been a letter that came in after publication.

<P><STRONG>
Keep up the good work with the Gazette.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Thanks 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT="8)"

First off, ZA is South Africa's country code; Zambia is ZM.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">...but the corrector had more important news than that I forgot to
look up the ISO codes before going to press.

The <A HREF="http://www.linux.org.za/LDP"
	>http://www.linux.org.za/LDP</A> URL leads nowhere. Hunting and
pecking around from <A HREF="http://www.linux.org.za"
	>http://www.linux.org.za</A> leads to some HOWTOs
and more dead links. Speaking as one who also suffers bandwidth
limitations I'd prefer to be pointed directly at the Linux Documentation
Project than have to scratch around a supposedly closer site fruitlessly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Second, I've had a look at your mirror sites in South Africa and a lot of
them are very stale.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Of the ones he tried two lead to mirrors that are more than 2 years stale,
one may be alive but having connection problems, and others were dead.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Chris] 
Time to update your mirror site list? Or maybe everyone turned
off their sites as well as their mirrors while you were upgrading
yours?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">I wrote to www.linux.org.za to see if they plan to reinstate their mirror.
For the others, I'll check again in a couple weeks and if they're still
down I'll delete the listings.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">We don't get feedback when mirrors go down unless somebody tells us, and we
don't have the time to check 210 mirrors manually.  I have looked into writing
an automatic mirror checker or finding one off the shelf, but haven't found
anything satisfactory yet, anything that can deal with timeout errors on 200
sites, do retries, and report problems back to a program in a way it can take
action.
 -- Mike</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Folks, if you are running one of our listed mirrors and decide you can't
handle the bandwidth anymore, take it private, or otherwise aren't going
to mirror visibly...  Please, take a spare moment, and let us know that
you're leaving the mirror system;  we'll be glad to take all the extra
visitors back off your shoulders.  Our blessings to you for what you
<EM>could</EM> provide aren't any less when you can't any longer.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Also, new mirrors are always welcome
