<P>
The PCMCIA controller is automatically detected during the 
installation, thus the cards should be automatically recognised and 
configured when they are inserted. Hearing two high-pitch beeps 
shortly after having inserted the card is a good sign; a high-pitch 
beep followed by a lower-pitch one means that the cards has not been 
successfully configured. Read the PCMCIA-HOWTO for the gory details.<BR> 
If you decide to recompile the kernel, you can choose one of the 
following procedures:
<DL ><DT><STRONG>Recompile the PCMCIA drivers</STRONG>
<DD>  This is usually not necessary if 
	you do not want to upgrade the kernel, 
	but, if you really want, you have to install, together with the 
	kernel source, the PCMCIA drivers sources.
<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Remove the PCMCIA and recompile the kernel</STRONG>
<DD>  This is the 
	safest way: remove the package, then recompile the kernel following 
	the instructions of the manual, once you are done, install the 
	new PCMCIA modules.
<P>
	<DT><STRONG>Forgot to remove the package?</STRONG>
<DD>  If you have already recompiled 
	the kernel and renamed the old modules - to be found in 
	<tt>/lib/modules/</tt> - you can either <em>force 
	remove</em> (<tt>rpm</tt> will complain about not being able to find the 
	modules.) the PCMCIA package and install it again or copy the 
	<tt>pcmcia</tt> folder in the old modules folder to the new one. 
	If you did not upgrade the kernel, both methods should work.
<P>
 </DL>
Check the file <tt>/etc/sysconfig/pcmcia</tt> which should look like this:
<PRE>	PCMCIA=yes
	PCIC=i82365
	PCIC_OPTS=
	CORE_OPTS=</PRE>
If you rebooted without PCMCIA modules, this file is saved with the 
name <tt>/etc/sysconfig/pcmcia.rpmsave</tt>.
<P>
Cards are detected and configured, if already inserted, during the 
bootstrap, as soon as the card manager daemon is started. 
Depending on your machine, the boot messages can scroll by so fast 
that you can hardly grasp some of them. All those messages are kept 
in <tt>/var/log/messages</tt> where they can be more easily read.
