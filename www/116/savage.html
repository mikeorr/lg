<h1>SEO and PHP</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/savage.html">Pete Savage</A></b></p>

<p>

<p> In today's fast-paced world, the importance of <em>Search Engine
Optimisation</em> and usability has been thrust into the limelight. More
and more companies and employers are hearing the buzz that is SEO, and want
reassurance that their new Web site will deliver. They all want to
be top of the search engines, and we all know that that will rarely happen.
There are, however, things we can do to help the issue, and make life a
little easier for those lovable bots and spiders who crawl our pages.


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> Whether you believe the fact that search engines discriminate against ID
numbers in URL strings or not, the fact of the matter is that

<pre>
[1] http://www.a_mucky_page.com/products?id=00234987&amp;category=990003429
</pre>

will never look as nice to the end user, or search engines, as

<pre>
[2] http://www.a_nice_place_to_be.com/products-modems/speed-baud-5000.html
</pre>

<p> Getting rid of GET parameters is also an advantage, as some search tools
will discriminate against pages based on the number of parameters.

<p> This article is a primer to help overcome this problem, using
PHP/MySQL/Apache and a pinch of mod_rewrite thrown in for some spice. In
some cases, this may not be the best solution, but is always worth
considering, as mod_rewrite is an extremely powerful tool in your PHP
Web development toolkit.

<p> To begin with, you will need a Web server running Apache with
mod_rewrite installed. If you own the server, this is going to be easy.
If not, you may have trouble getting the administrators to install
mod_rewrite. The reasons for this are simple; the administrators are not
trying to annoy you, but one false move inside mod_rewrite code, and the
CPU load goes through the roof. This article assumes you already have
some knowledge of LAMP systems (Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP), and that you
have mod_rewrite installed.


<h3>Structuring</h3>
<p> Structuring your database is an important step in the process, and must
be carefully thought about; however, it may be that your database is well
enough structured already - in which case, well done. Keeping your data
tidy not only helps you but also will automatically make for a more SEO
(Search Engine Optimised) system. We are going to use the example of a
single-tier categorisation system. By that, I mean that products are
sorted into a single category that fits them best. We will have two
tables, one for categories and one for products. Their structure will be
as in the tables below. You can see that the product table is linked to
the category table through the category_id field.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Category</strong>
<dd>id
<dd>title
<dd>description
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Products</strong>
<dd>id
<dd>category_id
<dd>title
<dd>description
<dd>price
</dl>

<h3>Preliminary Coding</h3>
<p> Let us write some PHP code to pull out the record information based on
the URL line [1] above. We have the two parameters we need: product and
category. The customer wants the category information listed on the page
with the product. Code for this may look like the example below:

<pre class="code">
&lt;?php
//Setup Database
mysql_connect(127.0.0.1, blark_inc, my_password);
mysql_select_db(blark_inc);

//Get the GET parameters
$category=$_GET['category'];
$id=$_GET['id'];

//Call in data for category and products
$category  =  mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM category
WHERE id=\"'.$category.'\"'));
$product   =  mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM products
WHERE id=\"'.$id.'\"'));

//Output the information
echo 'Category Name : '.$category['title'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Category Description : '.$category['description'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Product Name : '.$product['title'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Product Description : '.$product['description'].'&lt;br&gt;';
?&gt;
</pre>

<p> So, in our simple example, the IDs of both tables are called with the
GET method, and their relevant information pulled from the database and
output to the end user. As stated previously, though, this method uses a
URL string that does not look pretty in the least; rather, it's hideous.
You may argue that the category ID does not need to be stated, and
while this is true for a single-tier categorisation system, other more
complicated types of system may well need this capability. Just imagine
if a product were to appear in more than one category.


<h3>Enter mod_rewrite</h3>
<p> It is now that we pick up our pot of spice, with mod_rewrite scrawled in
friendly letters on the site, and begin to add in that little bit extra. Up
until now, we have not really discussed what mod_rewrite does - we have
simply put it forward as an answer to all our problems. So, let us delve
a little deeper. mod_rewrite is an Apache module that will rewrite URLs
according to certain rules. In effect, a browser will request a file by
name, e.g., my-life.html, and may be returned a completely different file,
e.g., my-friends-life.php, but it all happens transparently: i.e., the user
will still think he or she is viewing my-life.html. It is similar to the
notion of symbolic links in Linux, but a lot more powerful. Let us look
at a few examples of how this could be used. Please note this is not
actual code, just basic examples.

<pre>
<strong>Change all .html to .php</strong>
blark.html would become blark.php
Would give the effect of a static site, all links would be .html.

<strong>Redirect requests pages under maintenance</strong>
index.php would become maintain.php
Could modify a specific filename to point to a maintenance page.

<strong>Use the page name as a GET parameter for another page</strong>
my-information.php would become pages.php?page=my-information
Useful for having one script to run the show.
</pre>


<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>

mod_rewrite will only modify the URL if Apache is used to collect the file.
It makes no difference to files stored on your Web server. For example,
includes in PHP will remain unaffected, as they do not obtain the file
through the HTTP protocol but use the local file system.

<p> It is the last one of these examples that is of interest to us. Let us
make a simple .htaccess file to test some of the examples we have
just written. The .htaccess file contains all the rules for mod_rewrite
within that directory, an example of which is below.

<p> RewriteEngine on

<p> #First example - modify all .html to .php
RewriteRule ^(.*).html$ $1.php

<p> #Second example - modify index.php to maintain.php
RewriteRule ^index.php$ maintain.php

<p> #Third example - Use pagename as a get parameter
RewriteRule ^(.*).php$ pages.php/?page=$1


<p><strong>Note:</strong><br> 

If you make a mistake in the .htaccess file, and the resulting code
that mod_rewrite finds is invalid, you will be alerted with an Internal
Server error page, Error 500. Do not worry; this is normal. Just alter
the line, and try again.

<p> The expressions' syntax can take some time to understand, and
indeed I had a rather long experience learning this, when someone forgot
to put a escape character '/' before the '?' in a tutorial.
The rules follow the format of

<pre>
RewriteRule What_I_am_looking_for What_I_want_it_to_become
</pre>


<h3>Mod_rewrite Xplained !</h3>
<p> The '^' means start matching the filename from the beginning of the URL
string after the host. For example, with
http://www.my-life.com/test.html, mod_rewrite will only look at what
comes after http://www.my-life.com/, i.e., test.html.
The '()' are used to catch data. Anything that matches and
falls inside these parentheses will be stored. This can then be recalled
by using a '$1' in the rewritten expression, as can be seen in the first
example. The '.*' within the brackets in the first example catches all
characters, and the '$' denotes the end of the URL string. In this
example, for a file to fit the criteria, it must be a set of characters,
followed by '.html' with nothing trailing on the end. When mod_rewrite
finds a match, it takes the value inside the brackets and puts it back
to work in the rewrite expression '$1.php'. $1 means use the data from
the first set of brackets. If you had another set of brackets in the
matching expression, then using the data from it would mean using '$2'
in the rewrite expression.

<p> The second example should be obvious now. It matches the term
index.php exactly with no variations, and rewrites it to maintain.php.

<p> The last example is the one that should prove of most interest to
us. We are matching anything before the '.php' and rewriting this as the
GET parameter of another file called pages.php. Please take careful note
of the '/' in front of the '?'. '?' is a special character in mod_rewrite
code, and must be escaped using the '/'.

<h3>Let's Bake a Product Database (Bleugh)</h3>
<p> We now have everything we need to make our search engine-optimised
product catalogue. All that is needed is to remove those harmful IDs and
to replace them with something else. Why not make a separate field in
the table that can hold a unique identifier of a product, but written in
text instead of numbers? It may sound like a tiresome task and
unnecessary, but it can help you out. We will add a separate field to
each table in our database, and call it mod_page. This will hold a
modified version of the product/category title, and this will be used as
a unique identifier. For example the product 'Speed Baud 5000 Enhanced
modem' may have a mod_page value of 'speed-baud-5000'. It is up to you
how you create mod_page. It may be that you want to type each one in
individually, or it may be that you use a simple PHP script to translate
one into the other.


<h3>Mod_rewrite to the Rescue</h3>
<p> We now have to create a mod_rewrite rule that will interface with the
code we wrote previously, as closely as possible. Obviously, now that we
are using mod_names instead of IDs to call records, there will have to
be some changes, but the structure of it should remain the same.
Referring to the above code, it should be clear that we are expecting two
parameters. One called 'id' and the other 'category'. Let us
sculp a mod_rewrite expression that fulfils these criteria.

<p> To make the URL user friendly I have chosen the format
www.blark_inc.com/products-(category name)/(product_name).html .

<p> RewriteRule ^products-(.*)/(.*).html$ products.php/?category=$1&amp;id=$2


<p> This expression will take two pieces of data: The first is the word, or
character string after the 'products-' and the second is the name of the
page in this phantom directory. Remember that the /products-whatever/
directory does not even exist. Rather, it is being used to fool the user
and search engines into thinking that the site is structured in that manner.

<p> To take our example from before,

<pre>
http://www.blark_inc.com/products-modems/speed-baud-5000.html
</pre>

<p> will be magically and transparently transformed into

<pre>
http://www.blark_inc.com/products.php?category=modems&amp;id=speed-baud-5000 .
</pre>

<p> See how easy it is !

<p> We now need to make a few changes to the products page code in order for
it to pull the records out of the database. All that needs to be changed
are the field names in the database query lines.

<pre class="code">
$category = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM category WHERE
id="'.$category.'"'));
$product = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM products WHERE
id="'.$id.'"'));
</pre>


<p> becomes

<pre class="code">
$category = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM category WHERE
mod_name="'.$category.'"'));
$product = mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM products WHERE
mod_name="'.$id.'"'));
</pre>


<p> and thus the total code becomes:


<pre class="code">
&lt;?php
//Setup Database
mysql_connect(127.0.0.1, blark_inc, my_password);
mysql_select_db(blark_inc);

//Get the GET parameters
$category=$_GET['category'];
$id=$_GET['id'];

//Call in data for category and products
$category  =  mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM category
WHERE mod_page=\"'.$category.'\"'));
$product   =  mysql_fetch_array(mysql_query('SELECT * FROM products
WHERE mod_page=\"'.$id.'\"'));

//Output the information
echo 'Category Name : '.$category['title'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Category Description : '.$category['description'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Product Name : '.$product['title'].'&lt;br&gt;';
echo 'Product Description : '.$product['description'].'&lt;br&gt;';
?&gt;
</pre>


<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> As mentioned previously, this is a nice way to make your site look well
structured, to both user and search engine. It has been mentioned that
mod_rewrite does take a little more CPU load to run than if there were no
mod_rewrite at all, but I personally have never had a problem with it.
Providing that it is used in the right way, and not used to solve every
mis-extensioned file, it should not be discounted, and should form a part
of your PHP toolkit.
