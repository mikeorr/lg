<em><a href="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~hari/xplanet/">xplanet</a> 
follows the tradition of <b>xearth</b> but using real imagery.  I've
prepared this picture using the following options:
</em>
</p>

<blockquote><code>xplanet -output lg_cover117.jpg -geometry 800x560
--background /home/heather/xplanet_bg_lg117.jpg  -body
earth -longitude -20 -north orbit -config
overlay_clouds.29july05 -center +330+280 -num_times 1</code></blockquote>

<p>I fetched the current cloudcover imagery per the instructions in
<tt>/usr/share/xplanet/images/README</tt>. I decided the night image was a
little too dark and made a softer one called <a
href="misc/cover/night_mode.jpg">night_mode</a> which still shows some of
the landscape.  Most people don't know that you can give it any background
you like instead of having it speckle the black background. Many people know
that you don't have to let it pick the origin point. I started with
<tt>-origin=moon</tt> which looks great but the moon wasn't visible from
Florida right then, so I had to move our point of view
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"
                height="24" width="20" align="middle"></p>

<p>The starfield is actually from an ultraviolet study of the Milky Way; read a
little more about our galaxy at <a
href="http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~mwk7v/sim/mw.shtml">www.astro.virginia.edu/~mwk7v/sim/mw.shtml</a>.</p>

<p>I created a markerfile with only one entry in it, the latitude and
longitude for <a
href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/home/index.html">Kennedy Space
Center</a>, where the current shuttle took off and
will land.  There are a number of groups with
custom markerfiles for various purposes.  If you're putting together your
own, you might take a look at <A
HREF="http://www.videoi.com/~pietro/xearthmarkers/">Dave Pietromonaco's xearth
markers page</A> since he has a Gazetteer of coordinates for many
locations.</p>


<p><em>May the shuttles enjoy many more successful flights.</em></p>

Heather got started in computing before she quite got started learning
English.  By 8 she was a happy programmer, by 15 the system administrator
for the home... Dad had finally broken down and gotten one of those personal
computers, only to find it needed regular care and feeding like any other
pet.  Except it wasn't a Pet: it was one of those brands we find most 
everywhere today...  

<P> Heather is a hardware agnostic, but has spent more hours as a tech in
Windows related tech support than most people have spent with their computers.
(Got the pin, got the Jacket, got about a zillion T-shirts.)  When she
discovered Linux in 1993, it wasn't long before the home systems ran Linux
regardless of what was in use at work.

<P> By 1995 she was training others in using Linux - and in charge of all the 
"strange systems" at a (then) 90 million dollar company.  Moving onwards, it's
safe to say, Linux has been an excellent companion and breadwinner... She 
took over the HTML editing for "The Answer Guy" in issue 28, and has been 
slowly improving the preprocessing scripts she uses ever since.

<P> Here's an autobiographical filksong she wrote called
<A HREF="../issue67/misc/tag/filksong-programmers-daughter.txt">The Programmer's Daughter</A>.
