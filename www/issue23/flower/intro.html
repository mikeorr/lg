<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When a developer writes, compiles and links a programme
it may be stored on a computer disk as a file in the disk file system.
This file is created in a predefined format that the operating system or
operating system shell will recognise as an executable programme.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;When a programme is run it is instantiated in memory,
taking up system resources such as memory for data structures, file descriptors
and providing at least one thread of execution which defines the current
state and subsequent required operations for the process. The current executing
program, or process, has total use of the microprocessor while in it's
run state. A process will use files within the filesystems and may access
the physical devices in the system either directly or indirectly.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;A process may operate in one of two modes which
are known as 'user' mode and 'system' mode (or kernel mode). A single process
may switch between the two modes, i.e. they may be different phases of
the same process. Processes defaulting to user mode include most application
processes, these are executed within an isolated environment provided by
the operating system such that multiple processes running on the same machine
cannot interfere with each other's resources. A user processs switches
to kernel mode when it makes a system call, generates an exception (fault)
or when an interrupt occurs (e.g. system clock). At this point the kernel
is executing on behalf of the process. At any one time during its execution
a process runs in the context of itself and the kernel runs in the context
of the currently running process. This is shown in Figure 1.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Processes operating in kernel mode are privileged and
are granted access to all computer resources (such as all available memory)
free of the restrictions applied to user mode processes. The distinction
between a process in either user or kernel mode may be supported by the
hardware which serves to enforce the privilege rule and so protect the
computer system from undue damage or failure due to ill behaved user processes.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Though the basic concepts are similar, different
operating systems implement process management in different ways.</FONT>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="48%"><FONT SIZE=+1>On the Linux operating system
privileged services are largely implemented by a single monolithic kernel.
The kernel provides the central services required to support the successful
operation of the computer.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Linux kernel can also have a number of loadable modules
which may serve to supplement its central functions e.g. by the addition
of a new file system. As the kernel carries out a number of responsibilities
within a single entity it is commonly known as a macrokernel architecture.</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="4%"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="48%"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Windows NT operating system
is based on a derivative of a layered operating system (such as VAX VMS)
and a true client/server operating (such as Mach) microkernel architecture,
where the central kernel process carries out only the most basic tasks
in the most efficient manner possible.</FONT>&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Associated with the microkernel are a number of
privileged processes collectively known as the Executive which operate
in their own separate process subsystems. These includes (amongst others)
a dedicated Process Manager, Object Manager and Virtual Memory manager
to provide specialised services as required to support the establishment
of processes and their resources.</FONT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<FONT SIZE=+1>The operating system itself will execute largely in kernel
mode. User mode processes will often need access to services which can
only be accessed by privileged code operating in kernel mode. In this case
they call a system function which causes a hardware 'trap' to occur, causing
a context switch to system mode where the required operation can be carried
out in a controlled manner by 'trusted' operating system functions before
context switching back again to user mode.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Every user process runs in its own address space
(typically 3Gbytes on a 32 bit processor) isolated from the address space
of other active processes. From the point of view of the individual process
it also has complete access to the processor(s) of the machine on which
it is running i.e. it has it's own <I>virtual machine</I> on which it runs,
under the control of the operating system but independent from other processes.</FONT>
