<BR>Question by Denis Miller (denis.miller from sympatico.ca)

<P><STRONG>
I have a wireless connection to my landlords internet connection.
Under win98 it works fine but using xandros the encryption does not
work. Using no encryption it works fine.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
128 byte, infrastructure mode, netgear am111 usb, signal strength over
68%.  Is there some trick to using encryption I am missing.
</STRONG></P>

<p><Strong><ol>
<LI>Are you actually using encryption under Win98?


<LI>Is your landlord's Access Point set up to allow encryption?  From the fact
that it works without encryption, it cannot be set up to require it, so it may
not be set up to allow it at all.


<LI>Where did you find a landlord so kind as to allow you to use his
bandwidth?
</ol></Strong></p>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Okay, okay, kudos to any landlord who's a kind enough soul to offer #3.
Wireless is becoming a popular topic - people are welcome to give a good
solid shot at this question, but we'd also enjoy seeing an article about
something wireless.   Tripping over cords all the time makes Linux or in
fact any networking OS just a little less fun...

<P>
Hi gang,
</P>
<P>
I noticed some weirdness in my logs yesterday.  They're filling up with
events which appear to be probes to various ports on my machine, averaging
one every 2 - 3 secs.  The source ports (SPT in log) are above 1024, to
lower numbered destination ports (in most cases)  I'm using a Linksys
WRT54G wlan router (runs Linux!!), flashed to a 3rd party mod of the OS
called samadhi2.  I have the router firewall enabled.  I'm not sure what
to make of the situation, but I'm guessing that the ISP (an MS W2k shop)
has been cracked with a virus that is probing all IP's in their pool.
</P>
<P>
I'd be most interested in any comments.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">That was pretty close to the beginning of the month, things have been
dealt with since then.  We'll just give a taste of this - it's a sad
fact of modern network life that the destructive forces of virus and
worm blitzes affect every OS, just by chewing our bandwidth up like a
big dog chews up the master's old shoes.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">We'll protect the privacy of his shop here, suffice it to say that his
system logs showed a lot of traffic to destination ports 135 (hmm,
something in the mswin/Smb packet family?) and 445, though other ports
are sometimes seen... with a few to higher numbered ports (9898, 443,
1433...
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">Other nodes seem to be getting traffic either to or from 34240 or other
ports around that range. (viewed with iptraf -- Heather</font>)</blockquote>
<P>
It's interesting (and confusing) that the iptraf output on the 2nd node
doesn't show traffic with the same ports as the ipfilter log from the
other node.  Nor does the system log on the 2nd node show any probes to
ports 135 &amp; 445.

systems in a network are infested with a virus or worm that's going

puzzle can be, especially if it gives our gentle readers any leads on
preventing or solving the same kinds of problems themselves.   We'd
just <EM>love</EM> to have something on this topic, some meat to sink our

<P>
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/authors/odonovan.html">Barry O'Donovan</a>
mentioned in his article that:

<blockquote><pre>00 02 * * * rsync -r -e ssh --delete /home/username/mail

</pre></blockquote>
<P>
...is best run from cron -- yet this could cause a few issues if one is
already running some kind of "ntp" check, since the task running at
precisely 02:00 could clock skew. This would cause the scheduled rsync
process above to get reloaded by cron multiple times or even not at all.
Therefore, it is best to offset the time to either a few minutes before
the hour, or a few minutes afterwards.

<BR>Question by Brendon Oliver (brendon.oliver from redsheriff.com)

<P><STRONG>
Hi there,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I just noticed today that voting for this year's Reader's Choice Awards on
linuxjournal.com has now opened.  Thought it rather interesting (not!) that
they only list the "hijacked" Linux Gazette (linuxgazette.com) under their
"Favourite Linux Web Site" category.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So I made a point of nominating you guys as an "Other" site in my vote (as the
<EM>REAL</EM> Linux Gazette), and added a few words in their "Extra Comments" at the
bottom of the form.  I hope some of the other readers can do the same (voting
will most likely be closed by the time the next issue is ready).
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thank you for doing that.  I assume you're aware that the form
submissions (from <A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/rc2004"
	>http://www.linuxjournal.com/rc2004</A>) aren't public,
and will no doubt be filtered through company policy by an SSC employee.
But the gesture is appreciated.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I wasn't
too happy over the treatment you got from SSC, but unfortunately linux mags
are scarce on the ground here in Australia, so didn't really want to "vote
with my $$" and cancel my subscription.  Besides, it's a big world &amp; there
should be pletny of publication space for all.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyways, I've been an avid reader of the Gazette since probably late '97 so
just thought I'd add a vote of confidence from one happy reader!  Keep up the
great work!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Regards,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
- Brendon Oliver.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Indeed, I for one would never wish <EM>Linux Journal</EM> any harm.  We need it!
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
Rick Moen

<BR>Question by senthil (senthil from symonds.net)

<P>
[cc:ing TAG in the hope of continuing the thread about software for
low-spec machines]
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Hear that, readers?  If you've got more low-end system ideas, send them
to The Answer Gang, at <img src="../gx/lgmail/tag.png">.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
Hi Jimmy,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Kudos for your articles at LG.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I had read LG103, enjoyed it thoroughly and read LG104 quickly and found good number of useful articles.
Especially my pick was the Linux on Low End Systems from Answer Gang.
I have got a System having 128 MB RAM and unfortunately fits in the low end category as far as X,Gnome,kde are concerned. But instead of spending bucks, I have been enjoying with elinks,mpg123,vim and gcc, which are my mostly used ones.
I use twm sometimes and have not tried others.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hope to try with the suggestions given by the LG.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks!
Senthil
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks for the mail.
</P>
<P>
If you don't mind my offering a few more suggestions, I'd like to point
you in the direction of MPlayer for your video needs - it truly is a
wonderful piece of software, and doesn't try to use more memory than it
needs: <A HREF="http://www.mplayerhq.hu"
	>http://www.mplayerhq.hu</A>
</P>
<P>
There are a lot of great window managers out there with low memory
requirements which you might prefer: FVWM (<A HREF="http://www.fvwm.org"
	>http://www.fvwm.org</A>) is
possibly the most configurable, or you might prefer IceWM
(<A HREF="http://www.icewm.org"
	>http://www.icewm.org</A>) or WindowMaker (<A HREF="http://www.windowmaker.org"
	>http://www.windowmaker.org</A>).
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Many of which were hotlinked in the "WM Wars" blurb of The Answer Gang
column in our April issue.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
The articles I'm currently trying to finish for next month's edition are
about news aggregators and LiveJournal clients - if you have any
interest in either of these areas, Snownews
(<A HREF="http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/software/snownews"
	>http://home.kcore.de/~kiza/software/snownews</A>) and Clive
(<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ljclive"
	>http://sourceforge.net/projects/ljclive</A>) are good CLI programs for
these respective tasks.
</P>
<P>
Do you mind if I forward your mail (unencrypted, of course 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> to the
Answer Gang? We like to get feedback from our readers, and I think
Thomas and Heather in particular will be pleased to hear that the
information for low-end systems was useful to you.
</P>
<P>
Or, even better - you could write yourself, and offer your
suggestions. The thread in last month's issue only focused on
graphical interfaces - I'm sure that a great thread could come of it.
You never know - you might like it, and become a member

<HR width="10%" align="center"><P><STRONG>
Thanks Jimmy for your quick reply and your suggestions.
I would definitely try Mplayer (I have heard that Mplayer plays movie in the
text mode as well) and fvwm.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The thing which interested me in TWM is its simplicity which helped me
understand some of the underlying concepts.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thomas has written enough about FVWM to make me think that it would be
better for this than TWM.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
snownews and ljclive seems very interesting!!
btw, as we are on the topic of blogs and RSS, have you tried Nanoblogger?
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nanoblogger"
	>http://sourceforge.net/projects/nanoblogger</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Wow. Looks great.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I have used it, have involved myself with bugs and change-requests of this
project.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This is a very good cli based blogging utility and would definitely complement
the topics you are writing.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Jimmy, if you are covering snownews,ljclive in article,I feel a section on
nanoblogger will be informative as well.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It's a bit too late in the month to start looking at something new, but
I'll have a look at it for next month.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Jimmy,Feel free to forward the coversation to the Answer Gang and my wishes to
Thomas and Heather for their Wonderful work.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hope I would be getting more involved with LG

<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
it's quite some time that I don't read the Linux Gazette. Ok, this is
awful from my side 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've had some difficulties in sorting out which is the TRUE Linux Gazette,
when I finally had a flash and took the one with Jim Dennis inside 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
Jokes apart, I was very disappointed reading the whole story, but that's
the world and I'm happy that we all can have Ye Ol' Linux Gazette on the
net.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here comes my first question:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
"Where is one decent guy supposed to send its 2c tips?!?"
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote>Right here, to this very address. This is all mentioned in the FAQ that
we've all slaved over:
</blockquote>
<blockquote><A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/faq/index.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/faq/index.html</A>
 -- Thomas</blockquote></font>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Thanks Flavio.  More Two Cent Tips come from two sources - directly from
our readers, and from members of the Answer Gang (when the answers are
short).  Really, any reader can contribute to the answers found in
<EM>Linux Gazette</EM> - so tips as well as questions are sent to
<img src="../gx/lgmail/tag.png"> - ideally with the word "2c" or "Two Cent" in the
subject line.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">We really should improve the header over in More Two Cent Tips.  Thanks

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">

<P><STRONG>
I looked for it in all the website, but had no clue! Then I peeked the
"More 2c tips" section and - aaaagh! But there are questions there!!! This
leads to my second question:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
"Where have 2c tips gone?!?"
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I remember those neat, fast 2c tips in the golden age, but now I only see
some kind of TAG satellite section!
</STRONG></P>

<font color="#660000"><blockquote>I'm not quite sure what you're looking at, or indeed whether it is a
mirror site that for whatever reason has not synced yet. The number of
2c-tips from readers has been in decline, for all the reasons outlayed
in issue 103-104.
 -- Thomas</blockquote></font>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">When a Tip is inspired by a question to the Answer Gang, we feel it's fair
that the question be mentioned;  in most cases the Editor's Scissors have
trimmed the question down a bit (you should see the clipping room floor.
Question marks and bangsigns and dots all over the place. What a mess I
have to clean up after!) for your reading enjoyment.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
Ok, ok, flames off now, the magazine is quite healty and I don't want to
spoil my happiness in having (re-)found it. So... I drop my 2c tip to you
TAG, hoping that I won't be censored for my - how to say it? - attitude to
write too much!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
All the best to you all,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Flavio Poletti.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">If your attitude includes making Linux a little more fun, I see no
reason why we'd censure it (complain), much less censor it (edit it out
to attempt to ignore it).  We love to see Two Cent Tips from readers -
they're the juiciest!  Thanks for sending yours, Flavio, and I hope it
will encourage more readers to send theirs in too. Welcome back.
</font></blockquote>

comments from the Gang.)

Finally, after many long, weary years, much wailing, gnashing of teeth,
rending of clothes, and other low-budget special effects, TAG KB has
been updated, courtesy of Dave Richardson. Our newest proofreader has
started off with a BANG!... all right, you FBI people can all leave now,
it was all harmless, no harm no foul. Sheesh, they're all so <EM>twitchy</EM>
these days!
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Dave - welcome and a job well done! As always, folks, comments
and suggestions are highly welcome and encouraged.
