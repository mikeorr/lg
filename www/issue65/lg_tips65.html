The quick and easy way for a Perl programmer to do convert data to faxable

using html2ps &lt;<A HREF="http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html"

There was a letter to you from an unidentified person looking for a
driver for an Alliance Pro-Motion video card.
</P>
<strong>
<P>
"....Anyways, I would just run Linux but my problem is that Xwindows
doesn't have advanced support for my video card, so the best I can get
is
640x480x16colors and I just can't deal with that. Maybe I'm spoiled. The
guy I wrote on the Xwin development team told me that they were working
on better support for my card, though. (Aliance Pro-Motion). ...."
</P>
</strong>
<P>
If he goes to <A HREF="http://www.alsc.com"
	>http://www.alsc.com</A> and follows the path to tech support,
he will find a SVGA driver (no source code though) for X-windows.  I am
using an NEC Ready 9618 system which uses one of the Alliance chips on
the mother board.  It took a LOT of fiddling with the configuration file
but it will work at higher resolutions @ 256 colors.
</P>
<P>
Hope you can pass this on to him.

I've typed "mc foo bar" one time too many when I really meant to type
"mv foo bar".  Removing Midnight commander
is not an option, because that breaks some file exploror type GUI
utilities, so I cooked up a bash script to double confirn that

It should be easy to get in if you use LILO. At the boot prompt, type in
the name of your boot image (you can find that out by hitting the
"tab" key twice), followed by the word single. For a normal redhat
installation, typing "linux single" should do. You also can append
"init=/bin/sh" instead of "single", that leaves remounting your root
filesystem rw to you.

Hi!
</P>
<P>
About the question done by Antonio Sidona (<a href="../issue64/lg_tips64.html#tips/7">looking for a SNMP tool for networking</a>, tips) on you March 2001 
issue, we have tried netsaint
(<a href="http://www.netsaint.org/">www.netsaint.org</a>). 
It's a great tool, although needs to be configured
properly, but you can monitor any system that support SNMP or not. A funny
thing is that we HAVE HP OpenView installed, but you need license per
console, and NetSaint can be installed on a Web Server and accessed through
a browser. We actually used them on a complementary basis.

You should read its readme yourself, to check that it can handle your

David Cantrell, one of the Slackware staff members, has also made a pretty

<FONT COLOR="navy">2-cent Tip: Cleaning up after Netscape</FONT></H3>

<BR>Ben Okopnik <a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">(The Answer Gang)</a>

<P>
Linux is a wonderfully reliable OS: even the software that runs under it
is reliable. X Windows runs reliably. Midnight Commander is reliable.
Even Netscape Communicator crashes reliably.
</P>
<P>
Ooops...
</P>
<P>
Netscape is a nice piece of software, in that it supports everything (and
then some) that a modern "fancy" browser should support. Unfortunately,
the rate at which it goes down brings to mind expressions about hookers on
payday - and in my experience, it's been this way from day one. Not only
that, it tends to leave behind hung copies of itself (which makes the
processor load shoot right up into the red) and lockfiles that create error
messages the next time you try to start it up.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, tired of having to clean up the random garbage, I created
this script. If Netscape has crashed, or is simply frozen, it will take
care of everything. Nowadays, it's my automatic response to a Netscape
crash. &lt;sigh&gt; I'm getting awfully familiar with typing "notscape"...

I would have preferred to contact him directly but I could not find an
email address for him on the page.
</P>
<P>
Using gzip on backup files 2GB in size is a <EM>really</EM> bad idea, since if
the compressed file gets corrupted at any point, then everything
occuring after the point of corruption will be unrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
Of course if hard drives are perfectly reliable then corruption is no
problem, but if that were the case then you wouldn't be doing backups
anyway.
</P>
<P>
In general, compressing large backups is almost never worth it because
of the reliability issues. If one must use compression, bzip2 is a
better choice, since it uses 900kB blocks and corruption would only
affect an individual data block.

<P>
When writing a program that uses temporary files on a
UNIX/Linux system it is convenient to use a feature of
UNIX. Create the temporary file, then remove it (i.e.
<TT>unlink()</TT> ) without closing the file.
</P>
<pre>
fd = fopen("/tmp/somefilename.tmp",...);
unlink("/tmp/somefilename.tmp");
.
. Use temp file
.
fclose(fd) or exit();
</pre>
<P>
Then you can read and write to this file during
the existance of this process. The temp file will
not be removed until a close statement on the
file descriptor or the program terminates. Only
then will the kernel remove the file. Use this
technique to guarantee that all temp files are
cleaned up if your program crashes.

Hi Ray --

<P>
On a default RedHat install, the file <TT>/etc/redhat-release</TT>

If your web server is <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> and it has been configured to support (1)
HTTP Basic Authentication, and (2) .htaccess files, do the following:
</P>
<ol>
<li> Use the htpasswd
program to create a password file.  (This is not the UNIX
password file; for security, you should use different passwords than
your login passwords.)

<li> Create a file called .htaccess in the highest-level directory you
wish to protect.  The file should contain:
</ol>

<blockquote><pre>AuthName "Poems"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /path/to/htpasswd/file
require valid-user
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Now, when the user tries to access anything in or under that directory,
the browser will prompt her to type her "Poems" username/password.  If
she does not type it correctly, she'll get an "Unauthorized" error.
</P>
<P>
Your Apache configuration file must "AllowOverride AuthConfig" for
either the entire site or the portion of the site you're concerned
about.

<P>
In the article on <a href="../issue64/dellomodarme.html">ssh, scp, and sftp</a>
in the March issue, there is an
important area that isn't covered: client/server compatibility.
</P>
<P>
If you're just doing a basic ssh (to get a remote shell), you're
using a standard SSH protocol and any program named "ssh" is likely
to work with any remote system that offers a service it calls "ssh."
</P>
<P>
But scp and sftp are not standard protocols.  If you run the scp
program from openssh against a remote system that's running an
original ssh server, it will not work.  (And when I learned this the
hard way, it was very hard indeed:  the error message isn't "this
server doesn't implement this scp protocol."  It is, for reasons
that took a day of debugging to figure out, "invalid file descriptor"!

Hi!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm new Linuxuser (Redhat ver.) and I'm loking for a summery of commands,
"Linux version of DOS-commands". Do you have any good tips on where I can
find it?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
As it happens, such a thing exists. The summary, as well as a lot of other
useful tips for those who are used to DOS or Windows, are all included in
the DOS-Win-to-Linux-HOWTO. Take a look at "<TT>/usr/doc/HOWTO</TT>" (if you have
them installed on your system - if you don't, you should!), or
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org&gt"
	>http://www.linuxdoc.org&gt</A>; for the latest version. -- Ben

<BR>Josep Torra Valles<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"> (jtorra from campus.uoc.es)</a>


<P><STRONG>
I would like to know how write a selfextracting sh script with a
tar.gz(source code of my program) to be installed, and after
it's extraction I need run make in order to compile and finish
the installation.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks in advance
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Strange as this may sound, about a year ago, I wrote a shell script that
does exactly that - including automatically running "make" or another
program to process the files. I even packaged it as a tarball, with
documentation, configuration files, and even a man page... but I never
released it. Why? &lt;shrug&gt; There are a lot of tangled issues, including the
fact that this mechanism can be easily misused for malicious purposes. On
the other hand, so can anything that you download off the Web and execute
without checking it out first. Whatever, your e-mail here has spurred me
to go ahead and make it public: you can download "SFX" from my site, as
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ben-fuzzybear/sfx-0.9.4.tgz&gt"
	>http://www.geocities.com/ben-fuzzybear/sfx-0.9.4.tgz&gt</A>;. If you run it
without any options, it'll tell you how to create files that will
self-extract <EM>and</EM> compile, all in one shot. I also took some trouble with
the documentation; the "method" files are a pretty cool way to specify
action after extraction, and you can always create your own.
</P>
<P>
I'd really appreciate feedback from anyone who ends up using SFX; if
there's enough interest, I'll rewrite it, possibly in C or Perl.
</P>

Hi,

</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I often do revisions and checks of articles and text documents that my
colleagues wrote, and under Linux I miss the ability of MS Word97 and above
which allowed me to do revisions very conveniently. Under "revisioning" I
understand writing several marks and suggestions for the author to the
revisioned document, striking-out whole words or sentences and replacing
them with new ones.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm thus searching for a Linux document revisioning tool. It would be lovely
if the tool worked with XML. Do you know anything that could help me?
(Please notice that CVS is not what I need.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks a lot in forward.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Have you taken a look at WordPerfect 8 for Linux? I don't have it
installed on my current machine, but I seem to remember seeing some kind
of revision-type stuff in the menus. -- Ben

I've recently compiled the 2.4.2 kernel (under RH 7.0).  It seems I
can no longer run any commands the interact with the block loop
devices: mkbootdisk, mkinitrd, mke2fs <TT>/dev/loop*</TT>, mount -o, ...
If I run one of them, they hang at mke2fs <TT>/dev/loop;</TT> if I try to
halt the system afterward, it hangs trying to shutdown the
file-systems.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I've tried to compile with loop device support as a built-in, and as
a module (and lsmod show it loaded).  What am I missing?
</STRONG></P>
<p><em>... but he managed to discover for himself ...</em></p>
<P>
The 2.4.2 kernel has a bug which caused a deadlock for loop devices.
It is fixed in the 2.4.3-pre2 and later patches.
</P>
<p><em>Thanks for passing us the Tip, David! -- Heather</em></p>

<P>
I read with interest about how g77 works. I plan on using it when I get a
chance.  The questioner would probably find it useful to check out
www.fortran.com - it has links to many different Fortran products,
services, and benchmark tests, and a lot of what is on there is relevant
to/directly aimed at linux users.  Many compilers seem to be aimed
squarely at the linux market.  I guess that is because of the popularity
of Beowulf type clusters, but it's nice to know that even where almost
everything is (visibly) written in C there is still room for Fortran.
<br>Hope this helps
<br>Cheers
<br>Duncan
<br>ps TAG is great.  Keep it up.

Is this press release true?  Can somebody summarize how far the Linux-on-PDAs
projects have gotten?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Handhelds.org has a great deal of information about putting Linux onto PDAs.
Transvirtual's PocketLinux (their penguin is very cute - his whole tummy is
a pocket protector) runs on iPaq, VTech's Helio, maybe others by now.  The
pocketlinux has to be put on by having a dev environment on another box, but
this is no different than the first fellow who forcefed Linux onto his laptop
across its plink cable or ethernet crossover.  The result is operational
without an external bootstrap, but varies in usability.
</P>
<P>
Certainly some complete OS bigots have tried to put Linux on their Palms.
</P>
<P>
Agenda <EM>may</EM> be the first to actually sell a PDA preloaded with Linux, and
not designed for some other OS first, though.
</P>
<P>
And, their Linux environment has the usual PDA features, rather than trying
to be X or a terminal. -- Heather

Hello.  I keep seeing the term "mechanical CAD", but am not sure of it's
actual meaning.  What is mechanical CAD and what differentiates it from CAD?
Thanks.
RES
</STRONG></P>
<P>
This isn't really a question about Linux, but I'll toss in a potshot.
</P>
<P>
There are absolutely piles of CAD software available for Linux.  Most of
it appears to be for cirvuitboard description.  That's not terribly useful
for developing instructions to send to a metal lathe so a part can be cut.
And both of these are very different from architectural CAD for designing
building layouts.
</P>
<P>
I would guess that by saying "mechanical CAD" one could easily note that
you meant the second kind.
</P>
