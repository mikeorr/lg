<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Wind River joins forces with Intel on Auto Linux</h3>
<p>
<p>Wind River and Intel hope to dramatically disrupt the automotive industry's
in-vehicle infotainment market, introducing open source solutions to
challenge the current proprietary approach currently taken by the auto
industry.</p>

<p>The two companies have collaborated to create an open source Linux
platform optimized for Intel's tiny new Atom processor. The specifications
and the code from the platform will be released by Wind River to the open
source community via <a
href="http://moblin.org/community/ivi/index.php">Moblin.org</a>.</p>

<p>Wind River also unveiled a platform based on an automotive-optimized
commercial Linux. The Wind River Linux Platform for Infotainment is
optimized for Atom, and offers integration with many leading third-party
networking and multimedia applications, including speech-recognition
technologies by Nuance Communications; Bluetooth and noise reduction
solutions by Parrot; music management technologies by Gracenote; multimedia
networking solutions by SMSC; and DVD playback by Corel's LinDVD.</p>

<p> This approach will enable the development of Open Infotainment
Platforms that are based on interoperable, standards-based hardware and
software components. This will allow manufacturers to scale software across
devices, leading to cost and development efficiencies.</p>

<p>Wind River expects to deliver the open source specification and code to
the <a href="http://Moblin.org">Moblin.org</a> in-vehicle infotainment
community in August 2008.</p>

<p>Companies such as BMW Group, Bosch, Delphi and Magneti Marelli are actively
supporting Wind River's strategy to drive Linux into the automotive market.
Wind River already plays a leading role in collaborating with industry
consortia aimed at developing open, Linux-based software platforms, namely:
Eclipse, SCOPE-Alliance, OpenSAF, The Linux Foundation, LiMo Foundation and
Open Handset Alliance.</p>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">First Moonlight Release</h3>
<p> Moonlight, the open-source alternative to Microsoft's Silverlight,
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight">Wikipedia entry</a>)
has released its first efforts for anyone interested in contributing to
the project. While it is not ready-to-use yet, this is the first step into
inserting Silverlight into Linux by utilizing Mono.<br />

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">NetBeans Community Links to PHP Community with NetBeans Early Access for PHP</h3>
<p>At CommunityOne 2008 in May, Sun Microsystems and the NetBeans
community announced NetBeans IDE 6.1 General Availability and the
NetBeans IDE Early Access for the PHP scripting language, bringing the power
of NetBeans to Web 2.0 developers. A download is available at
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org">http://www.netbeans.org</a>.</p>

<p>NetBeans IDE Early Access for PHP includes intelligent editing features
such as prioritized code completion, instant rename, mark occurrences,
dynamic code templates, and easy navigation. Besides the editor, it
provides debugging support, deployment to the local server, dynamic help,
and sample projects making it easier to get started with PHP development.
It also provides support for embedded CSS, HTML and JavaScript(TM)
technologies.  More details can be found here: <a
href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/web/web-app.html">http://www.netbeans.org/features/web/web-app.html</a></p>

<p>NetBeans evangelist Gregg Sporar told Linux Gazette:
"The Early Access version of NetBeans support for PHP supports version 5.2
of the PHP language.  Our goal is to also support version 5.3 of PHP later
this year when we do a final release of our PHP support.  Support for PHP 6
is on our road map, but is further out."</p>

<p>NetBeans 6.1 IDE includes new features for developing Ajax web applications
using JavaScript(TM) technology and delivers tighter integration with
MySQL(TM) database.</p>

<p>JavaScript technology support is based on the dynamic language
infrastructure added for the Ruby programming language and includes:
semantic highlighting, code completion, type analysis, quick fixes, semantic
checks and refactoring. Version 6.1 also adds in a browser compatibility
feature that makes it easier to write JavaScript code to run in Mozilla
Firefox, Opera, Safari or Windows Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>The NetBeans Database Explorer in NetBeans IDE 6.1 makes it easier to
create, start and stop MySQL databases and to connect to and browse a
database's tables. Other new NetBeans features include faster startup and
code completion, enhanced support for Ruby and JRuby, including a new Ruby
platform manager and support for IBM's Rational ClearCase version control
system.</p>

<p>For a full list of features or to download the NetBeans 6.1 IDE, visit:
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org">http://www.netbeans.org</a>.</p>

<p>The free NetBeans Day community track offered developers a chance to learn
from the experts, find out firsthand what's new and what's coming in the
NetBeans IDE and Platform and to network with other members of the
community. <a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone">http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone</a></p>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu Live 2008 Canceled</h3>
<p>
Ubuntu Live, the conference that was scheduled to happen on July 21th in Portland, OR has been canceled. Canonical is going to add Ubuntu content to the OSCON, that will happen in the same weekend, at the same city. <br />

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">OpenSolaris goes LiveCD</h3>
<p>
At the CommunityOne Developer Conference, Sun and the OpenSolaris community
jointly announced a refreshed OpenSolaris, based on Sun's Solaris kernel and
created through community collaboration. This version has many of the GNU
and open source tools expected by Linux users and an enhanced package
manager.  Download the OpenSolaris OS now at <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/">http://www.opensolaris.com/</a>.</p>

<p>"OpenSolaris ... combines the strong foundation of Solaris technologies and
tools with modern desktop features and applications developed by open source
communities such as GNOME, Mozilla and the Free Software Foundation," said
Stephen Lau, OpenSolaris Governing Board member. "OpenSolaris provides an
ideal environment for students, developers and early adopters looking to
learn and gain experience with innovative technologies like ZFS, Zones and
DTrace. And yes, it uses bash by default."</p>

<p>LiveCD installation and the new network-based OpenSolaris Image Packaging
System (IPS) simplify and speed installation and integration with
third-party applications. OpenSolaris IPS increases installation speed and
accuracy by providing better control of applications and dependencies and
offers easy-to-use system management. At a keynote demo, the LiveCD came up
in about a minute.  A full disk install had about 2 minutes of screens and
then took 15 minutes on demo system.</p>

<p>The OpenSolaris OS is the first OS to feature ZFS as its default file
system, protecting work with instant roll-back and continual check-summing
capabilities to allow users to test ideas. Its Dynamic Tracing (DTrace)
feature provides safe, pervasive observability of production systems to
accelerate application development and optimization of the AMP/MARS stack.
Additionally Solaris Containers can build virtualization-aware applications
that can be deployed on single machines through multi-CPU and multi-core
systems, without worrying if third-party software will work.</p>

<p>This release is called OpenSolaris 2008.5; the next major release is 2008.11
in 6 months.</p>

<p>
<p>Less than a month after the release of the new version of Ubuntu, and
following a half-year of its own development, the Fedora Project has
introduced the Fedora 9 Linux distribution, a.k.a. 'Sulfur'. This distro sports
a Linux 2.6.25 kernel, Glibc 2.8, and current versions of GNOME and KDE.  It
also adds PackageKit, a cross-distribution package management solution. </p>

<p>Fedora still has a complex install and there are reported problems
coexisting with other OSes, something that Ubuntu has had in hand for a
while, but this is a solid release with broad hardware support.</p>

<p>
After almost 3 years of fixes and feature development, Firefox 3 Release
Candidate 1 is now available for download.</p>

<p>Many new features and changes to the platform for Firefox 3 can be previewed
now, including security enhancements and performance improvements over both
FireFox 2 and IE 7. FF 3 will also do a better job at memory management.</p>

<p>Most new features are stable in the RC version, but several users have posted
that about half of their Mozilla extensions, which worked well with Beta 4
and 5, are not working with the new RC1.  The release notes mention this
problem and add the following caution:  "Poorly designed or incompatible
extensions can cause problems with your browser, including make it crash,
slow down page display, etc.". Mozilla recommends starting FF 3 in safe 
mode and removing the offending extension to resume normal operation.</p>

<p>Firefox 3 Release Candidate 1 is available in more than 45 languages as a
public preview and can be downloaded from the Firefox Release Candidates
page.</p>
