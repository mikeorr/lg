<P> Here are some of the more amusing spams <I>LG</I> received this month:

<UL>
	<LI> "I am searching for only 10 elite individuals with the work
ethic necessary to generate a cash-flow for themselves of $2,000 - $5,000per
week." <P>
	
	<LI> "Somos XXXXX - COLOMBIA, ONG que trabaja en favor de 
los Niños de las Calles Colombianas. Trabajamos por la infancia que ha recibido
como herencia un país destruido y roto por la violencia y la corrupción....  En
nuestra TIENDA SOLIDARIA encontrara la satisfaccion solidaria a su gusto. En
ella entre otras cosas puedes afiliarte a nuestro "Club Niños de Papel" el cual
sera nuestra gran base humana, para conseguir la recuperación de los niños de
la calle de Colombia."

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[I'm not sure of this translation since I'm not a native Spanish 
speaker, but here goes: "We are XXXXX - Colombia, 
(NGO, Non-Governmental Organization?), who
labor for Colombia's street kids.  We work for the child who has inherited a
country destroyed by violence and corruption....  In our SOLIDARITY SHOP
you'll find the means to satisfy your yearning for solidarity with them.  In it
among other things you can join our "Paper Children Club", which will be our
great human base to help the street kids of Colombia to recover."
Hmm, save the children by buying a trinket.  And how much of the profits go to
the children?]

<P>

	<LI> "Dear Friend!
