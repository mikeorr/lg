<blockquote>So, I've shipped the HP laptop off to be repaired;
however, just before doing so, I wanted to try something that I saw
on the Net while looking up anything I could find related to this
problem. Someone had mentioned that having APM set in the Wind0ws
registry could create all sorts of mysterious crapology, and that
getting rid of those settings was a Good Thing. I booted Wind0ws -
probably about the fifth time I did so on this machine since I
started playing with it, searched the registry for the "APM" string
(nope, no such thing), and got ready to shut it down before
shipping it out when I spotted <b>THIS</b>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>I was rather amused, but also somewhat curious: was
this a virus, or what? Searching the Net for that exact string
produced <em>zero</em> results (!), so my best guess is that some
disgruntled employee at HP is doing his bit for entropy - and given
HP's response, I suspect that I'm the first one to report
this.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Yes, I <em>was</em> nice enough to notify HP. However,
the support-droid that I spoke to did not appear to take me
seriously... their loss. Pay the people who are your main interface
to the public $5/hour, and you'll get those who are worth about
half of that - if that much. On their own heads be it.</blockquote>

<p><strong>"What's noteworthy about it is that Microsoft compared
Singularity [MS Research's new kernel] to <a href=

Windows/XP - and almost every result shows Windows losing to the
two Unix variants."</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] I wonder how long it will be before
Microsoft releases an OS that is at least Unix compatible at the
API and user-command level. That would solve the biggest hassle of
MS systems, that they use completely different commands to do the
same thing, and one doesn't want to spend a year learning stuff
that is valid for only one OS and could change at any time. Apple
drank the kool-aid, so maybe MS will eventually too. Even just
having <tt>fork()</tt> would halve the difficulty of porting
programs.</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> Well... their "Services for Unix" (I think)
package provides a Cygwin-like environment. It's a free download,

are under the GPL.</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> [Ben] Apple decided to bank on what they
know - their hardware and their UI design ability. They were never
in the OS competition anyway, since you couldn't run their OS on
anything other than their hardware.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Micr0s0ft can't, short of committing suicide, do
anything broadly Unix-compatible with their OS, because the
automatic next question from the users would be "then what the hell
are we paying you money for?" If their entire user base was
familiar with Unix commands and practices, they'd be out of
business in a week.</blockquote>

like to swim) . I seek a lady without young or old children,a no

would need a sugarmamma figure at the beginning .</blockquote>
<blockquote>I seek a bisexual woman that figures out of the
years,looks young and feels young : it's not a problem if she's not
beautiful because she should be beautiful inside and most of all
,she should desire a younger soulmate.(She could be overweight too)
The thing I desire is to fix a serious stable relationship with a
lady who gives me the opportunity to have a better
life.</blockquote>
