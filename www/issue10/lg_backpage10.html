Larry Ayers lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

Mean, & Nasty, but kind of mellow&quot; as a boss should be.
He dreams of permanently tele-commuting from his home on the 
Pacific coast of the Olympic Peninsula, where he lives with his Samoyed
Suzie. Actually, right now Suzie is among the missing in Seattle. If you see her,
please contact us (<A HREF="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net">gazette@linuxgazette.net</A>).

Person for UUNET Internet Africa, South Africa's leading Internet Service

One of his current focus areas is Internet security--encompassing  
firewalls and packet filtering on routers. He is a fan of Linux, the art of
Salvador Dali, cartoons and heavy metal, in particular,
a German group called Helloween. His home page, where I got this
information and which you can access from his article, is very interesting.

I must say that after 2 months of being the Editor of the Gazette, I am
still having fun, and judging from the mail I think you guys, our readers,
are too. John Fisk is right--the Gazette is a lot of work, and worth every bit
of it.
<P> 
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. I get more mail about mirrors than just about anything,
except maybe readers wanting the Gazette to be available as one big file.
We are providing that this month along with the separate page format. (See
The Whole Damn Thing in the Table of Contents.) Doing the Gazette
in multi-file format is just the easiest way for me to build the magazine.
I've tried to be responsive to all mail and reasonable requests. If I missed
you, send your mail again, and I'll get back to you.
<P> 
The most important thing I'm working on outside of work these days is
definitely &quot;not Linux&quot;. I'm making a baby quilt for a friend of
mine in Houston. The baby is 2 months old now, and if I don't get it
finished soon, it will be too small for her to use. The geometry, as well the
art, of
quilting has always fascinated me--must have to do with being a math
person.
<P> 
If you would like some personal information about me, clicking on my
name below will take you to my home page. It's not very jazzy at the moment,
but I'm looking for the time to fix it up.
