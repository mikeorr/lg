Hi,
</p>

<p>
thank you for the article about GNOMEs history. Looking back made me
happy, nevertheless, I doubt that ... "GNOME development was announced
in August 1977" ;-)

Well spotted, Jakub! This just points up our need for more proofreaders
and technical editors.
</p>

<p>
You're right, of course - Oscar obviously swapped a '9' for a '7'. I
mean, everybody knows it was in <strong>1797</strong>; his Royal Majesty Gustav IV
Adolf of Sweden was quite a believer in gnomes, and was willing to pay
to develop them... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I've fixed the mistake at our root site - not that it's going to affect
anything at our mirrors, but at least there will be one place in the
world where the truth about GNOME development will be told (they
emigrated to Switzerland with Gustav upon his abdication, and have been
known as "The Gnomes of Zurich" ever since.)

&gt; Hello Ben,
&gt; 
&gt; sense of humor is a rare commodity, thank you for the funny explanation.

<p>
A pleasure. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; If there is a need to proofread text before publishing, send me an URL. I will

Jakub, we're always looking for help. Your English is certainly
sufficient for the task of correcting tech errors, or bloopers like the
one you mentioned; if you'd like to join us as a Technical Editor, you'd
certainly be most welcome. If you're interested, please take a look at
<a href='../../../jobs.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/jobs.html</a> - the instructions at the top of the
page will guide you through everything necessary to become an LG
proofreader or tech editor.
