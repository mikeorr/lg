&gt; When you consider the mutually-unintelligible varieties of English -

&gt; it becomes less startling. Unlike the varieties of Arabic, the base

Yes, we're sort of in a silent conspiracy to make (other) foreigners

[laugh] Thomas, I was lampooning a certain attitude - unfortunately, a
very common one - of believing that other languages are all a sort of a
lump; you either speak them (all) or you don't. You know - "English was
good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for me!"

Um, I <em>hope</em> you got Thomas's joke:  He was very drily lampooning the
(cringe-worthy) stereotype of the Englishman (or, certainly, American)
who thinks people abroad will understand him better if he speaks English
<em>louder</em>.

I think Thomas was perfectly capable of pushing the "Translate" button

Yoicks. If we start telling Scandahoovian/Minnewegian jokes, there's no
telling where this is going to end up. Sooner or later, the lutefisk
stories will come out, and then you'd have to explain what "uff da"
means (and how to pronounce it, for some furriners' edification), and...
well, it's just best if we don't.

Ole and Sven grabbed their poles and headed out to do some ice fishing.
As they were augering a hole in the ice they heard a loud voice from
above say, "There are no fish under the ice." Ole an Sven moved about 25
feet over and started to make another hole. The voice said a little
louder, "THERE ARE NO FISH UNDER THE ICE." They both looked around
and then looked up. Ole said in a humble voice, "Are you God?" The voice
spoke back, "No ya idiots! I'm the ice rink attendant."

Deirdre's parents each had one firm requirement of anyone who might
marry her daughter.  Dad said the chosen bloke had to like Tom Lehrer.
Mom (the Swede) required that he have a horror of lutefisk.

(I must say, the clan finds Minnesota/Midwest culture, including the
allegedly Scandinavian kind, a bit exotic, though, my father's family
having gone directly from Kristiansund, Norway to the San Francisco Bay

listening to Garrison Keillor on the radio, one does find hauntingly
familiar elements.)
