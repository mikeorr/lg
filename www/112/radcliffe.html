<h1>Linux: A Clear Winner for Hardware I/O</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/radcliffe.html">P. J. Radcliffe</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Hardware I/O is important to quite a few people but the traditional
way in which Windows and Linux treat I/O is far from ideal. In this
article we will look at these traditional ways, and show a new
way which makes Linux a clear winner over Windows for hardware I/O.</p>

<p> <b>Who cares</b> about hardware I/O,  where a computer directly
controls hardware?</p>
<ul>
	<li><p> Hobbyists love hardware I/O to control microprocessors,
	motors, robots, their home and more. For example in the February
	2004 Linux Gazette, Pramode C.E. interfaced Linux to a PIC microprocessor
	(see "<a href="../issue99/pramode.html">Let's Build a Cool Linux Toy</a>").</p>
	
	<li><p> Engineering students who do subjects in electronics and
	computing often need to interface their computer to hardware. This
	can make great projects and to be used to test constructed hardware.</p>
	
	<li><p> Industry needs cheap and powerful controllers for
	manufacturing and serious hardware control. In many cases Linux
	works just fine, especially with some of the real time extensions
	that can be added. To read about real time extensions see the GPL
	RTAI at <a href="http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai">http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai</a>
	or the free RTLinux from FSM Labs at <a href="http://www.fsmlabs.com/">www.fsmlabs.com</a>
	<br>At RMIT University where I work we have a security system based
	on Redhat 6.1 that has been operational for some 8 years. It has
	briefly crashed twice, once due to the log file filling the hard
	disk and once due to a problem with the database engine.</p>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Problems With DOS, Windows, and Linux</h2>


<p> <b>DOS, Windows 95 and Windows 98</b> did not block I/O access in
any way so command line or GUI programs could happily control I/O.
This made I/O access easy but created both a vulnerability and a
security hole. A misbehaving application could accidentally access
any I/O address and so create havoc with network cards or hard disks.
A malicious application could deliberately access networks or disks,
and possibly wipe the entire hard disk.

<p>Even if these problems are acceptable to you there is worse - none of
these operating systems are supported by Microsoft and most of the newer
applications and development tools do not run on them. Few people want to
run such old systems so anything you create most probably wont be used by
anyone else.</p>


<p> <b>Windows 2000, NT, ME and XP</b> all block I/O access by using
security features build into the x86 microprocessor core. You would think
this meant no I/O access is possible but - yes, there is a hack.  For
example, two programs called <code>giveio.sys</code> and
<code>totalio.sys</code> can be used to bypass I/O security; you can
download <code>giveio.sys</code> to suit Windows XP from <a
href="http://www.physik.rwth-aachen.de/group/IIIphys/CMS/tracker/en/silicon/arcs_nt.html">http://www.physik.rwth-aachen.de/group/IIIphys/CMS/tracker/en/silicon/arcs_nt.html</a>.

<p>Such programs have several problems. Firstly, most of them give I/O
access to every port, or access to a limited range of I/O for every
application. Perhaps more important is the fact that these programs are
hacks, and the very next Microsoft security update may render them useless.
In fact, the existence of these I/O programs represents a security weakness
for Windows so Microsoft should be finding ways to block their action.</p>

<p> <b>Traditional Linux I/O</b> restricts I/O access to the root user, or
to device drivers which run in kernel space. For applications running under
root privilege, the C code function ioperm() can give access a limited
range of I/O ports between 0 and 0x3FF. The C code function iopl() can give
access to all I/O ports (0 to 0xFFFF) and allow the application to turn
interrupts on and off. See the UNIX info pages on both these functions for
more details.

<p> On close inspection none of these methods are really acceptable. It is
very foolish to work as root during software development as a simple
mistake can delete key parts of the operating system and so make your
system crash and burn. Running an application with root privileges opens up
all the vulnerability and security problems found with DOS and Windows 98.
Writing kernel drivers is no better as they have the same security
weaknesses and are significantly more difficult to write and debug compared
to normal applications.</p>

<p> On the face of it, it seems as if Linux is little better than Windows
for hardware I/O. It has the same weaknesses but at least I/O access will
not disappear with the next security update.</p>

<h2>The Linux Solution</h2>

<p> Linux allows significant manipulation of the permissions and
ownership of running software processes. It is possible to link
together several well defined Linux features to create a bullet-proof
method that will allow a user-level program to have I/O access to a
limited range of I/O, typically just a parallel printer port or serial
port. This means no security weaknesses and very easy programming of
hardware I/O.</p>


<p> <b>The tricks</b> used to make this happen are as follows -</p>
<ul>
	<li>A trusted I/O enabling program is created with the ownership
	set to root and the UID bit set. The UID bit means that even if a
	normal user starts the I/O enabling program then it runs with root
	privileges. This can be set up from the command line:
<pre>
   su - root                 # become root, give password when requested.
   chown root IO_enabler     # make root the owner of the enabling program.
   chmod u+s IO_enabler      # set the SUID bit.
</pre>
	
	<li><p> The I/O enabling program is run and first enables I/O access
	but only to the desired ports - typically all parallel printer ports
	and the serial ports. This is done using the C function ioperm().</p>
	<li><p> Optionally the process priority can be set using the C function
	setpriority(). A higher priority will ensure the application about to be
	started experiences fewer delays as other process run at a lower priority.</p> 
	<li><p> The I/O enabling
	program then drops down to the privileges of the real user who
	started it using the C functions setgid() and setuid(). These
	functions do not effect the I/O access permissions or process
	priority.</p>
	<li><p> The I/O enabling program then loads the application program
	over its own code space by using the C function execvp(). This means
	the application program is now running with user (not root)
	privileges, and with I/O access limited to only those I/O ports
	enabled by the trusted I/O enabling program. 
	</p>
</ul>

<p> <b>Running an application</b> becomes quite simple -</p>
<pre>
   ./IO_enabler ./application_program  parameter_1  parameter_2 ...... 
</pre>
<p> <b>The code</b> behind the I/O enabling program is surprisingly
short -</p>
<pre>
   /*--- optionally set process priority, 0= normal, -20 highest, +20 lowest.*/
     setpriority( PRIO_PROCESS, -10, 0) ;

   /*--- get access to the ports.*/ 
     if (ioperm(0x378, 3, 1)) 
       perror(&quot;Failed ioperm lp0 on&quot;) ;
       
   /*---  remove root privileges.*/     
     setgid( getgid() ) ;
     setuid( getuid() ) ; 

   /*--- overwrite code space with the application program, 
         send arguments to the application program.*/
     execvp(argv[1], &amp;argv[1]) ;

   /*--- if get here exec must have failed.*/ 
     perror(&quot; execv failed&quot;) ;
</pre>
  
<p class="editorial">[ <strong>Note</strong>: in general, creating SUID
programs without understanding all the security implications of doing so
can be very dangerous. <strong>Do</strong> try this at home... but read
much and consider deeply before you do. -- Ben ]</p>

<h2>Useful Code Examples</h2>

<p> Here are a few real bits of code to get started. Unless otherwise
stated, compile a program ( lets call it 'x') as follows -</p>
<pre>
   gcc  -o  x  x.c
</pre>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/lp_tty_start.c.txt">lp_tty_start.c</a>: this I/O enabler
allows access to the standard three printer ports and four serial
ports but nothing else. Ensure it is owned by root with the UID bit
set as described earlier in this article.</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/port_write_then_read.c.txt">port_write_then_read.c</a>: this
will write a single byte to an I/O port and read back the new value of
the I/O port. It is probably best to use /dev/lp0 data port (888) to test
this program. To ensure that your /dev/lp0 is active, reboot your machine
and go into the BIOS setup. Ensure the parallel port is in either
"compatible", "SPP", or "bidirectional" mode. Remember to save your BIOS
settings on exiting the setup screens. Start the program as follows to
write 85 (55 hex or 01010101 binary) to the /dev/lp0 data port which will
come out on pins 2 to 9 -</p>
<pre>
   ./lp_tty_start  ./port_read_then_write  888  85
</pre>
<p>
<a href="misc/radcliffe/iopl_start.c.txt">iopl_start.c</a> is another I/O enabler based
around the iopl() function. This gives access to all I/O ports (0 to
0xFFFF) and has the ability to enable and disable interrupts. Like
lp_tty_start it must be owned by root and have the SUID bit set.</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/blockio.c.txt">blockio.c</a> must be started
with iopl_start.  It will turn off interrupts and hang your machine for
about 8 seconds, as well as causing pin D0 of /dev/lp0 to output a 500 kHz
squarewave. After 8 seconds the program will terminate normally and your
machine will resume its usual operations.

<p> Start this as follows -</p>
<pre>
   ./iopl_start ./blockio
</pre>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/hide_lp_tty_start.txt">hide_lp_tty_start</a> is a 
script file that shows how to hide the fact that your program was started using
 lp_tty_start.  Unfortunately programs started thus way must take a fixed
 set of parameters.  The application is simply a read of the data port of
 lp0 using 
<a href="misc/radcliffe/port_read.c.txt">port_read.c</a>. 
Start it as follows -</p>
<pre>
   ./hide_lp_tty_start
</pre>

<p> <b>What ports have you got?</b> The code below implements a
program that will check which serial and parallel ports are active
and available on your machine. To make the program easy to run, the code is
designed to be executed as root (not really a security issue, as you
have the source and can see the code is benign).</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/main.c.txt">main.c</a> shows the basic flow
of the code, and the instructions for use. 
</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/pp_access.h.txt">pp_access.h</a> and
<a href="misc/radcliffe/pp_access.c.txt">pp_access.c</a> form a neatly
packaged parallel port access module that can save and restore the
parallel port state, and help manipulate the bits in the port. You
may want to reuse this module in your own applications. 
</p>

<p> <a href="misc/radcliffe/serial_access.h.txt">serial_access.h</a> and
<a href="misc/radcliffe/serial_access.c.txt">serial_access.c</a> provide
a similar functionality for the serial port. 
</p>

<p> <a
href="misc/radcliffe/make_pp_serial_check.txt">make_pp_serial_check</a> is
a script file that compiles the code above to make an executable.  Compile
the code using make_pp_serial_check and execute the program
(./pp_serial_check) as root with no parameters to see the instructions. The
program can identify whether ports exist and perform a simple loopback test
as further verification that the port works. </p>

<h2>Some Dangers, and Help Needed!</h2>

<p> <b>Remaining dangers</b>: the software dangers of using I/O have been
largely eliminated by using the I/O enabling programs shown in this article
but one danger does remain - if you fail to design the hardware circuitry
properly, or mis-wire it, then you can blow up your precious parallel
port (serial ports carry only signals, and are therefore much harder to
damage.) Fortunately, there are a few simple warnings and a few simple
circuits that can protect your ports. If there is enough response to this
article then perhaps we can follow up with an article on safe hardware
interfacing.</p>

<p> <b>Where to now?</b> This article has shown how user-level
programs can safely access I/O in a very simple manner. Linux should
now be the operating system of choice for all hardware I/O. It should
be the operating system of choice for engineering students, computer
science students, hobbyists and industry that uses hardware I/O. 
</p>

<p> Linux can access not only the standard ports such as the printer port;
it can also connect to many of the plug-in cards that provide more
sophisticated functions, such as relay cards and high speed analogue I/O.
</p>

<p> What is needed is a wider range of I/O projects visible on the web
so students, hobbyists, and practicing engineers have a head start
when they create projects. New projects are needed and a lot of those
old DOS projects need to be updated and ported to Linux. Can you be
part of the Open Source community and help?
