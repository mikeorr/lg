<h2>Editor's Note</h2>
<p>I'm back again this month, and, after a <a href=
"misc/lg/trip_to_poland.html">trip to Poland</a>, am a little
bit less stressed than I was before... though if it wasn't for my
son, I would have looked for a job, so I could stay there (though I
think if I had asked anyone where I should go to look for a job,
they would have said "Try Ireland" <img src="../gx/smile.png"
alt=":)">)</p>
<p>Slightly on-topic: I was pleasantly surprised in an arcade to
see a Tux Racer arcade machine!</p>
<img src="misc/lg/Image034.jpg" alt="TuxRacer arcade machine">
<p>(Oh, and this: I had a single room for most of my stay, but on
my last night, Friday, I had to share a room. The first thing I
noticed among my roommate's belongings was a Kubuntu CD <img src=

I passed this on to a friend who edits scientific articles, and
this is her response:
<p>Q: How many copyeditors does is take to screw in a
lightbulb?</p>
<p>A: That sentence isn't clear. Does it mean to have sex in a
lightbulb, or to place a lightbulb in its socket? Please
clarify.</p>
<p>Suggest:</p>
<p>(1) Sentence as written is ambiguous. Does it mean to have
sexual intercourse inside of a lightbulb (in which case, pls
clarify size of bulb), or to place a lightbulb in its socket?</p>
<p>(2) The phrase "does it take" is messy. The anticipatory pronoun
has no reference. Who or what is doing the taking? Pls recast.</p>
<p>(3) The term "copy editor" is a not complex noun, and thus has
no excuse for being set as a single word. It is an adjective (copy)
and a noun (editor). A dress the color of mammalian blood is not a
"reddress"; it is a "red dress." Note also that, when set as two
words, "copy editor" does not take a hyphen, unless the phrase is
being used as a complex (non-predicate) adjective, as, for example,
"a copy-editor hissy fit."</p>
<p>(4) There is an obvious typographical error. Suggest you
proofread manuscripts before submitting them as final.</p>

<p>Quoting from weatherunderground.com:</p>
<pre>
Today
Mostly sunny. Windy. Patchy fog in low lying areas this morning. Highs
11 to 17. Wind chill readings 15 below zero to 30 below zero this
morning. Northwest winds 15 to 30 mph in the afternoon in locations
right near the foothills and near the Wyoming border.
</pre>
I'm <em>so</em> glad that I'm leaving today... although I don't
know that Boston, where I'm going next, will be any warmer. I've
lived in NYC, where it snows every winter, but
<strong>this</strong> crap brought Moscow to mind. <img src=

<p>So, we went out to do some chores, and stopped by a place where
Kat used to work. One of the businesses there is a used
car/boat/motorcycle dealership, and they just happened to have this
nice bike for a decent price - and I just happened to be in the market,
ready to trade in my Nighthawk 750 (which was getting a bit old and
tired). So, after a bit of horse-swapping, here's my new ride:</p>
<p>2003 Triumph "America" 800cc</p>

Hi all, When considering on-line, community-published Linux
newsletters what comes to my mind is, of course, The Linux Gazette.
<a href="../index.html">http://linuxgazette.net/index.html</a>
Several of the Gazette's authors are local to Silicon Valley and
also members of SVLUG. But the Gazette's contributors and readers
are from all over our globe. Collaboration with the Gazette might
be useful to all and there is a existing body of knowledge in the
Gazette about how to produce newsletters. They are an excellent
outfit. Mark
<p>...snip...</p>
<pre>
&gt; Bill Ward has mentioned (and I agree) that this could be a cross-LUG effort,
&gt; with support coming from CABAL, EBLUG, PenLUG, even NBLUG and
&gt; LUGoD.
&gt; 
&gt; <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=
":-)"> I'm liking the positive energy.  A community-published Linux newsletter is a pretty compelling idea. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks everyone!

<h3>Some patent absurdities</h3>

<br>
<b>Tue, 6 Mar 2007 07:13:01 -0800</b>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>One friend (Rahul Basu) forwarded a link to the Alcatel-Lucent
MP3 patent story and I found a blog that seems to have figured out
whats going on: <a href=
"http://www.edn.com/blog/1690000169/post/1200007120.html">http://www.edn.com/blog/1690000169/post/1200007120.html</a>
Now it's clear to most of us that software patents are absurd and
this story is a consequence of that absurdity.</p>
<p>... but (in the USA) you seem to have got an ever expanding
patent regime. Another friend (Rahul Siddharthan) forwarded this
blog:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2006/10/tax_patents_a_w.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2006/10/tax_patents_a_w.html</a></p>
<p>Today the USA, tomorrow the rest of the world.[*]</p>
<p>Einstein in the patent office was <strong>not</strong> a
mistake. We will need Einsteins in the patent office soon.</p>
<p>Q: Do you think Bekham and Roberto Carlos can patent their
free-kick techniques?</p>
<p>They do make money based on these techniques and they can
probably teach these techniques to others (for a fee!).</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kapil.</p>
<p>[*] For example, there have been repeated attempts to change the
patent law in India at the behest of the multi-national pharma
companies.</p>

<p>I'm breaking out in bikes all over these days. Here's my newest
toy:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://okopnik.freeshell.org/img/1995_GSX750F.jpg">http://okopnik.freeshell.org/img/1995_GSX750F.jpg</a></p>
<p>(Mine doesn't have all the graphics, but everything else
including the color is right.)</p>
<p>Yep, I've sold the Triumph - too much of a cruiser for my blood,
and [cough] I can only stand so much British engineering. Seriously
- when the manual starts out with <em>cleaning</em> instructions,
and has lots of BOLD letters and exclamation points telling you how
<strong>crucial</strong> that part is and how it
<strong>must</strong> be done every single time... well, that's the
very definition of "not a bike for the Benster". [shrug] I made
money in trading in my old bike, I made more in selling this one,
<em>and</em> I got a damn good deal on the new one. And I got to
play with a bike that was completely different from anything I've
had before. I call that a win all around.</p>
<p>I rode the Katana home today and got off with a
<strong>huge</strong> smile. Hellllo, higher insurance
premiums...</p>

<p>In an interesting bit of synchronicity, I got one of those

stuff. This one, however, seems to have hit it's mark (Mike Orr
would be choking from laughter by now.) The subject, in Russian,
means "ALL for the purchase of penguins" - and the content is just
"penguin".</p>

already sent us a perfectly good one???</p>
