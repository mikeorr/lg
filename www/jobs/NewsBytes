Just as the LG Mailbag represents the interaction of LG and its readership,
Newsbytes represents the interaction of LG and the Linux community. The
NewsBytes team will be responsible for redacting the PR received by LG, as
well as searching out interesting news items for inclusion in the NewsBytes
column.

The NewsBytes team will also be responsible for gathering the information and
data for the related publications links, such as Gnome Journal and Linux
Focus; the head of the team will also receive the PR releases from various
companies.

The NewsBytes team should be working in close cooperation with the LG PR
team, as well as the LG Book Review team (see the relevant entries). If you
feel more comfortable with the social (rather than the technical) end of
Linux, this is the spot for you!

Time commitment:

	Highly variable; requires motivated people who enjoy researching the
	latest Linux-related industry buzz.
