<P> Being among the first in porting software from Windows to Linux
can't be easy. Especially if you do not have any feeling for the 
Linux community. Still, it is nice to see software that you have
played with - and sort of liked - under your new OS. This is what
has happened to CoffeeCup Software's HTML Editor ++.

<P>

<BR CLEAR=all>

<P> First let me say that feature-vs-easy-of-use wise it is superior
to just about anything on Linux. I feel that Amaya is the closest
rival if it just wasn't so eccentric. (At least I think it's
eccentric). In HTML Editor ++ you get wizards, albeit limited,
for creating tables and frames. You get three rows of buttons
across the top and a set of handy menu short cuts along the right
hand side of the screen (Align left, right, centre, new
paragraph, new line, etc). And you also get - which I think shows
a lack of understanding of Linux culture a big--no, gigantic--
shareware banner across and towards the top of the screen. This
is annoying but tolerable if you decide to use the editor. When
you pay for this piece of software it presumably disappears is
if by magic. There is nothing wrong with that but the banner is
so large it actually provokes cracking. Another Windows standard
that followed the product into Linux is that it is time-bombed:
it stops working after 30 days. This together with the banner
brought the anarchistic side of me to the front and at least the 
time bomb "feature" is extremely easily invalidated. CoffeCup
Software has a lot to learn from J-M Jacquet and his 
<A HREF=http://www.littleigloo.org>IglooFTP-PRO</A>
which also is shareware but the nag is implemented in a more
subtle manner.

<P> A main "selling point" is the directory and file navigation
system pioneered by HomeSite. On the left side of the screen you
get two boxes, one for directories and one for files. You
navigate you site tree by double clicking on the directory name
and open the file by clicking on the file name in the box below.
Brilliantly easy.

<P> Now, I don't have anything against shareware (I used to use
several (payed-for) shareware applications on Windows). But there
is a problem HTML Editor ++. It's flawed. In the brief period
I've tried it out I've discovered several bugs. Most irritating
is that it seems to handle existing documents badly. Not that it
adds copious amount of own code, it doesn't, but the formatting
tools freak out regularly.

<P> For example: open a document, place the insertion point somewhere
in the text and hit the hyperlink button on the right. You get
a screen to fill in a text and the link.  Click "Cool". You would
expect it to insert the text and link at the insertion point,
right? Unfortunately it doesn't; just now it scrolled down to the
bottom of the page and inserted the text and link there. What you
have to do is select a word, hit the hyperlink button insert the
linktext and hit "Cool". (It didn't work now, but it usually
does). HTML Editor ++ is plagued by this kind of problems.

<P> Another example is the "New line" button which may insert the
&lt;br&gt; tag at any random location in the text (although bottom of
the page is preferred).

<P> Most of these problems go away if you write a document from
scratch. Then everything works as intended. Don't ask me why, I
didn't write this port. And you can't help out either - it is not
Open Software. The most serious problem though is that HTML
Editor ++ is unstable. Various simple formatting actions can
crash the editor; e.g., just inserting a new &lt;p&gt; tag. It took a
couple of pages to discover this but one very good piece of
advice is, ironically enough the same as for much software with
Windows background, save your work often.

<P> A last complaint is the "Save" function which is just plain daft.
In a graphical application you really shouldn't be forced to
enter the path manually. And why do you get a confirmation screen
which you have to click "OK" on the make it go away?

<P> In all, HTML Editor++ is a promising piece of ported software.
It needs much more work to become stable and bug free but to
those patient enough it is quite nice to work with.
