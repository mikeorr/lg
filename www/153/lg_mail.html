<p>
Hello everyone,
</p>

<p>
Good day!
</p>

<p>
I am using tcpdump in my linux system to sniff and capture tcp packet
headers. 
</p>

<p>
I  inserted a new variable, srtt, into  the print_tcp.h header file  and
tcp.c source code.
I want  to print/ouput/capture  the inserted variable srtt into  the tcp
packet headers once I run tcpdump. 
Any idea on how to go about this?
</p>

<p>
However, once I run tcpdump with all the changes I made (of course,
after configuring and making) and  I got an error:
Bad header length and &lt;bad opt&gt;.
</p>

<p>
I tried to increase the snaplength to 1514 but I still got the same
errors. What seems to be the problem, anyone? Thanks!
</p>

<p>
Also, I cannot see the inserted srtt variable in the tcpdump trace
files. Any idea on these guys?
</p>

<p>
I don't know if this is the right venue to ask these question since this
is for linux queries but still I am hoping that anyone has an experience
on this. Help would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Cheers, Dom

I was trying to point a friend of mine to <a href="http://librivox.org">http://librivox.org</a> today,
and for some reason he couldn't connect to it. The quickest way of
finding a proxy he could use was via Google Translate (he's Polish).
When I looked at the page, however, I say that the phrase 'some free

become 'niekt√≥re wolne oprogramowanie *rejestruj&#261;ce*' - 'some

<p>
Hi all,
</p>

<p>
I am administering a e-mail server running RHEL 5 with sendmail 8.13 and
using dovecot imap most of the users are going to need to be able to
send mail from their laptops and i have no idea what network they will
be utilizing. After looking at
<a href="http://www.joreybump.com/code/howto/smtpauth.html">http://www.joreybump.com/code/howto/smtpauth.html</a> and following the
guide there I was able to get authenticated relay enabled.
</p>

<p>
I am using saslauthd and never created sasl passwords but
following the guide at <a href="http://www.joreybump.com/code/howto/smtpauth.html">http://www.joreybump.com/code/howto/smtpauth.html</a>
was able to get it working. now after 6 months of no problem and then
the other day changed my password to a stronger one now I cannot relay
from anywhere.
</p>

<pre>
[root@linuxamd ~]# sasldblistusers2
listusers failed
[root@linuxamd ~]#
[root@linuxamd ~]# testsaslauthd -u joey -p <strong>******</strong>
0: NO "authentication failed"
</pre>

<p>
is this my problem?
</p>

<p>
All accounts are stored in /etc/passwd saslauthd is running and I
performed a restart of saslauthd with out any errors.
</p>

<p>
I have tried with both kmail and thunderbird. My usual settings are tls
if available and and smtp auth with username and password I thought at
first that this was the problem it was using the old password so I
removed the default smtp server settings and removed the passwords. So
it would force me to manually enter the password again I did this while
on another network and tried to send with no success. As soon as I
disconnected from the neighboring lan and connected to the local lan it
took and sent but I am unsure if it is using auth it seems like it is
only sending because its on my lan how would I verify the authentication
process is working at all? I am not certain exactly how saslauthd
works and have seen nothing unusual in my logs. Thunderbird simply times
  out when I try to send from other networks and tells me to check my
network settings.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance,
</p>

Hello!
</p>

<p>
I am playing with 2.6.26, e2fsprogs 1.41 and ext4, just to see what ext4
can do and what workloads it can handle. Do you know of any tools that
can populate a filesystem with a random amount of files filled with
random data stored a random amount of directories? I know that some
benchmarking tools do a lot of file/directory creation, but I'd like to
create a random filesystem layout with data, so I can use the usual
tools such as tar, rsync, cp and others to do things you usually do when
setting up, backuping and restoring servers.
</p>

<p>
Curious,

Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I'm going to be teaching a class next week in which the student machines
are going to have Fedora Core 6 installed on them, so the poor on-site
tech guy is going to be spending his weekend flipping the 6 installation
CDs among a dozen-plus machines - not a happy-fun thing at all, as I see
it.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know of a way to set up an "install server" for FC6? Perhaps
I've been spoiled by the Solaris 'jumpstart' system, where you set up a
simple config file, tell your hosts to load from the jump server, and
walk away - but I can't help feeling that anything Solaris can do, Linux
can do better. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I am working on an ARM based custom development board that has a Micro SD
connector.
</p>

<p>
I use Linux (kernel version 2.6.24) on the board and I have support for the
Micro SD cards.  The SD driver has support for hotplug.  At the bash prompt
on the target board, I am able to mount the card, write data to it and read
data from it.  What utility do I need to add to the root file system for the
card to be detected automatically when it's inserted and the file system on
the card's media to be mounted to a specified mount point?
</p>

<p>
A couple of years ago, I was working with PCMCIA Flash memory cards and USB
memory disks.  There used to be a utility called Card Manager (cardmgr) that
detects the insertion of a PCMCIA flash memory card and mounts it
automatically.  USB memory disks used to be automounted by the hotplug
scripts.  Is there any utility similar to this for SD/MMC/Micro SD cards?
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance,
Kanagesh

Hello gang!
</p>

<p>
As the subject says, I have hard times understanding the result of
snmpwalk against those platforms. Not that I can't query those nodes,
but snmpwalk is unable to translate the numeric form of OID into human
readable string label.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, I need to find the MIB files that describe the
returned SNMP data. So far, my best bet is by referring to
oidview.com, but the MIB files I have downloaded from this site don't
always work as expected i.e some OIDs are still in numeric form, thus
I don't whether it refers to disk usage, cpu utilization and so on.
</p>

<p>
I will highly appreciate any inputs regarding this issue.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi.

Hi gang...
</p>

<p>
Sorry if the subject sounds confusing, but I wonder, is it possible?
AFAIK, each CUPS daemons manage its own queue on the node's own
disk...and by design I don't see CUPS is designed as cooperative
daemon.
</p>

<p>
By "cooperative" I mean something like having unified print spool,
unified and shared printer device's name among CUPS daemons...and so
on.
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to hear any ideas about it...
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi.

Hi all
</p>

<p>
Just wanna say big thanks for your suggestions when I asked about CUPS
configuration days ago. it works quite nicely in my environment.
</p>

<p>
I know I haven't share much for LG but you answered my question faster
than my close colleagues/partner. I highly appreciate that. You guys
really do something valuable in your free time.
</p>

<p>
God bless!
</p>

I would like to thank everyone for their comments.  I do hope the topic has
not made too many peoples blood pressure to rise to "dangerous levels",
although it is clear a topic several people are passionate about.
 
In summary it looks to me that Linux could be used on one of two basis's;
 
</p>

<p>
1.	If we were not a UK company (or any company citied in the
restrictions).  To resolve this we could establish an off shore company to
provide the distribution to circumvent this restriction. 
</p>

<p>
2.	Encryption was removed from the package.  A task I believe is
relatively simple to achieve.
</p>

<p>
Two points I would like to make for your information and further comment is
that I believe the restriction on US content is 10% not 1% as one person
commented.  Secondly I will of course seek legal advice before proceeding
but wanted to see if this issue had been seen before, by the experts (the
legal guys don't tend to know what they are talking about anyway).
 
Thank you once again and if you have further advice on the issue it would be
gratefully appreciated.

&gt;&gt; Hello TAG,

&gt;&gt; I have a text file from which I want to list only those lines which

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; How to do this with 'gre'p?
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Assume, file is 'patch', and 'string1' and 'string2' are the two patterns.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; The strings for me are: 'ha_example' and 'handler'- so I cannot
&gt;&gt; possibly write a regex for that.
&gt;
&gt; Over the years, I've developed a working practice that says "don't use
&gt; grep for anything more than a simple/literal search." Remembering the
&gt; bits that you have to escape vs. those you don't is <strong>way</strong> too much of a
&gt; pain. Stick with 'egrep', and you don't have to remember all that stuff.
&gt;
&gt; ``
&gt; egrep 'string1|string2' filepattern

<p>
hmm. Works great.
