<P>
Howdy y'all! Thanks for dropping in!  Well, as usual, the mail has been coming
in fairly steady.  I apologize to everyone who wrote during the &quot;Great
E-Mail Brown-Out&quot;.  I managed to get backlogged by several week's worth
of mail and while I tried to write back to everyone, I'm sure that there were
folks that I missed.

<P>
Anyway, thanks so much to the many of you who wrote and offered corrections,
ideas, suggestions, and encouragement.  I think most of you realize that this
takes a huge amount of time to do and the encouragement has been invaluable
(well, that AND one seriously awesome OS!! :-).

<P>
Please DO take the time to skim through these letters.  I don't have the
space to put everyone's in here but these are a sampling of those that I
thought would be of general interest to everyone.  There's a little bit of
everything here and some wonderful ideas (as well as some much needed 
corrections to my &quot;information myopia&quot;).

<P>
I'm sorry that I haven't had the time to actually create links to each of 
these letters but just so that you get a taste for what's here I've included
a &quot;grep list&quot; of subjects headings for your purusal:

<B>Subject: Abuse<BR></B>

<P>
    Like you, I'm no gamer at all, but I had time to take a look at Abuse,
the platform game which is mentioned in one of your issues (3rd, I think)
and comes with Slackware 3.0-Y.

<P>
    Despite I didn't hear the sound, because I don't know how to configure
my SB16 yet (please don't tell me), I found it was really cool, but it took
less than an hour to finish! It said &quot;To be continued&quot; and there was an
offer for a T-shirt, and something like that, what made me think it was only
one of those litlle demos.

<P>
    Later, I took a closer look on it and discovered that was only the Top
of the Iceberg. The game is fully programable, and one can make her own
levels. Mutcho cool por demas!

<P>
    It is just the time to read the little (96k) manual (wich is really
*abuses* of errors on english, just like me) and start success !-)

<P>
Sorry for my badly english. Regards.<BR><BR>

<P>
(Well, as Gert said, I'm no gamer, but Abuse is supposed to be <I>the</I>
heir-apparent to that all time favorite blood and gore extravaganza
<B>DOOM</B>.  For those of you who might be interested, there's a write up
about it in this month's <B>PC Magazine</B> in the Games and Entertainment

To: 'fiskjm@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu' &lt;fiskjm@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu&gt;<BR>
<B>Subject: Linux Gazzette #7<BR></B>

<P>
John,

<P>
I stumbled across your Linux Gazzette from the RedHat www page reference.   
I found it interesting to say the least. Thank you for the work. I   
realize how much effort it takes to write such a document.

<P>
HOWEVER (and you knew that this was coming, didn't you) . . . .

<P>
There are some problems with the article describing the PPP ip-up   
scripts.

<P>
1. The pppd process runs these as programs. That is it runs them with
'execl'. It does not run the shell giving 'ip-up' as a shell script to
the shell. They are not scripts in the true sense of the word. This
means   that if you wish to use a script that you must, and this is not
an   option, make the first two characters #!. This is Linux's magic
'cookie'   which means that this program is really a script. Please make
this   distinction as it is a significant one which many people who use
scripts   forget.

<P>
2. By the time that the ip-up program is executed, the selection for any
compression protocols has long since been made. A bug in the existing
2.2.0e code permitted you to specify the BSD compressor without having
it   loaded. However, it was never really used as it would not have been
initialized. The 2.2.0f code has this bug 'hole' corrected.

<P>
The PPP protocol requires that the compressors be agreed upon with the
&quot;Link Control Protocol (LCP)&quot; stage. This is the very first
set of frames   which are exchanged when the modems first connect. After
those frames are   completed, the IPCP protocol is exchanged. The IPCP
protocol defines   things such as your IP address. Once the IPCP
protocol has been   exchanged, then and only then is the IP layer 'up'
by the standards of   the PPP specifications and the ip-up program is
run.

<P>
So, you may do anything during the execution of ip-up that you wish
EXCEPT write to the local terminal as it runs this program with stdin,
stdout, and stderr all pointing to the /dev/null device. This is done
for   security reasons.

<P>
I like to run the popclient program to retrieve my mail from the office
system's mail box, sendmail to send the outbound mail, and finally run
ntpdate to correct the date and time for my portable against the NTP
server at the office.

<P>
If you wish to dynamically load the bsd compression module then the best
way that I have found to do this task is to use the kerneld dynamic
loader. Simply make the bsd_comp.o the alias for tty-disc-3 rather than
ppp.o. The kerneld loader will attempt to load bsd_comp. This will have
a   dependency for ppp, so kerneld will first load ppp. This has a
dependency   for slhc (vj header compression), so that is loaded, then
ppp, then   bsd_comp.

<P>
Thanks for the interesting guide. I plan to check back and see what you
have in store for issue #8.

<P>
 -Al.

<P>
(Well, I want to personally thank <B>Al Longyear</B>, the co-author and
maintainer of the <B>pppd</B> package.  Al generally can be found hanging
around the <B>comp.os.linux.xxxxx</B> heirarchy and fielding PPP specific
questions.  As most, he's terminally busy and so I'm grateful for his taking
the time to write this letter of correction and clarification!  -- John)

Hi,

<P>
If you're interested in writing about commercial products available for linux
take a look at www.caldera.com for its latest efforts.  Specifically Sun's
Wabi technology to run Windows 3.1 programs on 
linux.  Here is a list:

&gt;                                       (with limited functionality)
</PRE>

<P>
Even though I hate Microsoft, and I don't really need their products,
management needs to hear the word Microsoft in order to take it anything
seriously for some reason.  I believe that the magazines they read have very
powerful subliminal microsoft messages so I try to avoid them. &lt;-- Joke  
Anyways, my reason for liking the Wabi port is now I have an argument. 
&quot;Why choose between Microsoft and Unix when you can have both in
a networked X-Windows environment&quot;.
This argument is great since my company is upgrading to LanWorkPlace 5
which includes a cheap but workable X-Server.  

<P>
I hope this interests you,

(Well, many thanks to Dave for this note!  I've often been noted as poking
some reasonably good-natured fun at Gates et al. but those of you who have
written know that my feeling is that being multi-OS-lingual is the way to go.
Each OS has its particular strength and weaknesses and areas where its useful
to <I>you</I> as the gal/guy running it.  For those of you into this sort of
thing, I'd <I>definitely</I> be watching <B>Caldera</B> and the folks at
<B>RedHat Software</B>.  These guys are making some serious moves in the Linux
OS arena.  Those of you who are not only multi-tasking, but multi-OS'ing may
find this of interest. -- John)

Hi!, Here's something, maybe you've heard of it before, Not sure, My 
apoplogies if you've heard of it!, A while aback here in our College 
Computers, we can telnet to our server, the server is running on AIX 3.2, 
and recognised that you can hit Ctrl and D to logout, So , I Went off to 
try this out on Linux 1.2.13(Surprise!) on my home computer(586/100mhz) 
and thought there must be a way to do this, so after fumbling around in 
the /etc subdirectory, buried inside the profile, there's a line which 
says ignoreeof=9, set that to zero and hey presto you can now log off 
with Ctrl-D! Mind you I was a newbie before (and still am :) ;)) What a 
great OS to hack away in these days! I found this Linux Gazette on the 
'net and am very impressed!, keep up the good work with Linuz Gazette! 

<P>
Congratulations! <BR>
	Cheers,<BR>

eMail: d93002@rsl.rtc-limerick.ie<BR>
P.S: I've tried to network two computers via PLIP, the annoying thing is 
the Kernel thinks the parallel port is at address 0x3BC IRQ 5, the proper 
address is 0x378 IRQ 7, I've tried switching the values around in Space.c 
in the /usr/src/linux/drivers/net! I would appreciate a little insight 
into this problem! bearing in mind that the kernel does automatically 
probe the I/O address and IRQ, but keeps bringing up the wrong address! 
:( I'm still happy to hack away though! :) I luv it!

<P>
(Thanks, Tom, for this tip!  For those of you who've been wondering about that
little &quot;ignoreeof&quot; thingie in your /etc/profile, here's a tip that
can shed a bit of light on it.  -- John)

<B>Subject: Dosemu<BR></B>

<P>
Hello,

<P>
I've read the articles in your Linux Gazette (keep up the good works there) 
on DOSEMU, and I thought that maybe the following was worth mentioning:

<P>
To access your DOS partition as C: in DOSEMU it is sufficient to do the 
following:
<P>
- Make sure your DOS partition is visible in Linux<BR>
- In your dosemu.conf, set up a hdimage as the C: drive.<BR>
 (it needn't be big, it can be a few 100k)<BR>
- in the CONFIG.SYS of this image, specify as the last line :<BR>
<PRE>
INSTALL=C:\lredir.exe linux\FS/dosc<BR>
</PRE>
(assuming your dos partition is mounted on /dosc)<BR>

<P>
This will load lredir BEFORE loading command.com, and has the nice effect
that the autoexec.bat is searched ON YOUR DOS PARTITION.
So you really have to worry about only one autoexec.bat file.

<P>
In order to distinguish whether I'm running native DOS or DOSEMU,
I set an environment variable DOSEMU. It's set to YES in the config.sys
on my hdimage, and to NO on the &quot;real&quot; config.sys. Thus I can avoid loading 
some nasty software in my autoexec.bat.

<P>
I hope you'll find this useful enough to publish it.

<P>
Yours,<BR>
Michael.<BR>

<P>
PS. I found this trick in the &quot;Linux tips HOWTO&quot;. by R.D. Warren.
(We wouldn't want to give credit to the wrong people, would we? :-))

<P>
(Well, DOSEMU has garnered one of those coveted &quot;Most Favored
Programs&quot; distinction here at FiskHaus :-)  I've recently upgraded to
DOSEMU 0.63.1.36 and it's running great under kernel 2.0.0!  I bought a copy
of <B>WP 6.1</B> a while ago and not only run it in its native text mode but
it also works great under <B>graphics mode</B>!  With its support for clipart
and some other niceties, I can even do simple DTP with this thing!

<P>
Seriously Mucho Cool! :-)

<P>
Anyway, for those of you who haven't tried it -- do so! I think you'll agree
that it's worth the investment in time. -- John)

<B>Subject: Diamond Stealth 64 PCI<BR></B>

<P>
Hi,

<P>
I discovered Linux Gazette on the web and downloaded and printed all issues 
for reading at home. Here is my 2 cents worth.

<P>
I recently installed Linux (Slackware 2) at home. I am very new to both Unix 
and Linux, having used DOS for years and Windows 3.1 for the last 3 years. 
Having read various notes on CD-ROM and on the web regarding Diamond display 
adaptor, I am supposed to have big problems!!!  - Exploding monitors and all 
that good stuff. I am running the Diamond Stealth 64 PCI with 1Mb RAM and 
NEC 4FGe monitor.

<P>
Referring to Matt Welsh's excellent book 'Running Linux', I setup .xinitrc 
exactly as printed. I managed to fumble around installing VGA and SVGA 
drivers attempting to get this card working. I got something on the screen 
but was not impressed with the resolution (320x200, 4 color)!.

<P>
I later loaded the S3 drivers. After scratching around the various 
documentation files, I used xf86config to create a XF86Config file which 
seemed to look right. I then pasted the &quot;Monitor&quot; section for NEC 4FGe from 
Monitors file into the XF86Config file. When running startx, up came 
X-Windows, just like in the book at 640x480.

<P>
Ctrl-Alt-+ brought me 800x600 and 1024x768. I did have a problem with 
1024x768 - there was a narrow vertical white stripe on the right hand side 
of the monitor. I did not let this bother me but at least I could play with 
some new toys! Maybe those problems with Diamond card is all hype!

<P>
I have been tinkering for the past 2 weeks. St Patrick's Day in 'Tattered 
Cover' - great book store - tempted me with Slackware 3.0 (elf). At $19, I 
could not resist. When I got home, I backed up XF86Config into the DOS 
partition, blew away Linux, and re-installed the new. Restored the existing 
XF86Config. This works even better than before - the white stripe has gone 
away. I have now started experimenting with X resources and .fvwmrc for 
customizing.

<P>
Since I have read of other people having problem with Diamond cards, here is 
my contribution. Attached is my XF86Config.

<P>
<A HREF="./misc/XF86Config.diamond">XF86Config</A> for Diamond Stealth 64.

<P>
Now I still have problems with an Acer 6x CD-ROM drive - EIDE - Linux just 
does not recognize the drive. I have to copy directories to the DOS 
partition and install Linux from there. Maybe someone out there can help 
with that problem.

<P>
Linux Gazette is just great. Keep it up.

<P>
Match

<P>
(Thanks to Match for sharing this!  Getting X set up under Linux isn't always
an easy task and a correctly configured XF86Config file is one of those things
that most of us &quot;anal-retentive, obcessive-compulsive types&quot; have
got multiple backups of!  For those of you running <B>Diamond Stealth 64</B>
cards this might be helpful. -- John)

<B>Subject: Comment Errors in the Linux Gazette<BR></B>

<P>
I enjoy reading about linux, even though my computer is sitting idle
2000 miles away. However, reading the most recent issue of the Gazette
caused me some trouble.

<P>
I am using MMM Navigator and, due to the authors strict adherence to the
HTML standard, I was unable to read the Gazette. Unfortunately, your
commenting style is not in compliance with the standard and, as a
result, the program cuts off all text until the next pair of dashes. I
wrote the Navigators author and here is his reply.

<P>
:----------------------------------------------)<BR>
Dear Matt,<BR>
thanks for your report.<BR>

<P>
The problem you've noticed is the consequence of the braindead definition
of comments in HTML/SGML. Most people think that comments start with
&lt;!-- and end with &gt; or --&gt;.
Unfortunaley, it is not that simple, and I tried to implement in MMM the
proper definition of comments (or at least, what I understood).

<P>
The following are correct comments:<BR>
&lt;!-- a very simple comment --&gt;<BR>
&lt;!-- a comment -- -- with several -- -- parts --&gt;<BR>
&lt;!-- how about - dashes --&gt;<BR>

<P>
The idea is that you have an arbitrary number of comment parts, enclosed in
double dashes.

<P>
A special rule was added in the MMM lexer to allow constructions like<BR>
&lt;!--------------&gt;<BR>

My name is Jennifer X.  I am in Seattle, Washington.

<P>
I have spent over a month now attempting to get Linux installed on my
computer.  I have tried every available version, and even gone so far as to
install a second HD... specificly for the purpose of helping me get some
version of Linux installed.  I have made numerous requests for help on irc
#linux, posted requests for help in the linux mailing list and usenet
groups, attended a linux users group... and even invited one of the so
called linux guru's to my home.  He spent 5 hours attempting (without
success) to get linux installed.  I have therefore come to the conclusion
that linux is an operating system which is highly over rated.  If it works
at all, then I have no doubt that it only works on substandard computers.
Since my computer is a Pentium Pro 150 with 32 MB of RAM, I believe that
this is much to advanced for linux to be able to operate.

<P>
I say now, and for the record, that I believe linux to be a substandard
operating system which is good for little more than filling up hd space.  I
challenge anyone to come to my house and prove me wrong.  Frankly, after my
experiences with this so called operating system, I have no doubt that it is
not possible to install it on my computer.  But if anyone CAN do it, I will
happily eat my words.... without ketchup, then post pictures of me doing
exactly that on the net for all to see.  On the other hand, if someone FAILS
to install linux on this computer, then I expect them to eat THEIR words....
and post a picture of them doing exactly that... for all to see.   

<P>
I am betting that there will not be a single taker to this challenge.  

<P>
But in case somebody is brave enough to give it a shot, they can get in
touch with me via your publication.

<P>
(OK, this one needs a bit of explaining I think...

<P>
Jennifer wrote me and we exchanged email several times in an attempt to get
Linux up and running on her machine.  Her travails have taking her through
several &quot;local Linux gurus&quot; attempts at help -- she's even done the
Linux IRC thing and managed to connect with the <B>&quot;Great One</B> (Linus
T. himself, guys! :-).  All this, but still no system.  

<P>
If any of you running a PPro system could offer her advice or help, please
feel free to drop me a note (this was her explicit request) and I'll be happy
to forward it to her.  You can drop me a note at 
<A HREF="mailto: fiskjm@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu">fiskjm@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu</A> 
if you'd like.

<P>
<B>PLEASE NOTE!</B>

<P>
I don't usually encourage this type of help -- using aliases and
&quot;go-between's&quot; -- as it is hardly the basis for open communication.
Still, after writing back and forth a couple times, I realized that she
seriously wants to give Linux a whirl and is at wit's end as to what to do to
make it work.

<P>
Flames get promail routed to /dev/null, ideas and suggestions will be duly
forwarded to this young lady.

<B>Subject: Slackware<BR></B>

<P>
Dear fiskjm,

<P>
 I have a helpfull hint for any newbies trying to get Slackware running.
I tried installing it 3 times, and while it would install and boot, I 
didn't have vi or mail. To make a long story short, I was installing
from the Slackpro directory on the CD, which is the version that runs
from the CD. I finally found someone who had a working system and they
told me to install from the Slackwar directory. I did and now I have vi
and mail and everything. I was never able to find out this interesting
difference between Slackpro and Slackwar from reading several books on
Linux, but my friend showed me a reference to it in The Linux Bible. 

<P>
 One other suggestion for newbies: the best way to get a system to run
Linux on is to build it from components, especially if you want to run
X. I'm not a computer tech, but assembling my second system was a breeze
compared to trying to get tech info (what video chipset, etc) from IBM
about my first system, an IBM PS/1 (which, perversely, is less &quot;PC com-
patible&quot; than the clones). BTW, I wish I'd found your on-line mag a lot
sooner. A lot of what I see here is right at my need level in learning
how to make Linux do what I need it to do.

<P>
Best wishes,<BR>
Ken Deboy<BR>

<P>
(Thanks, Ken, for the tip!  I agree about putting a system together by
component.  One of the &quot;soon-to-come&quot; articles I'd like to do will
be about the system upgrade that I'm in the midst of at this moment.  After
doing a bit of research and reading it's pretty apparent that for Windows or
OS/2 compatibility, almost anything out there will work fine.  

<P>
However, if Linux is your primary OS (and, of course, it <I>IS</I>, otherwise
you wouldn't be hanging around here, now would you...? :-) then putting
together a system by component is probably the way to go.   I think this is
<B>especially true</B> for all you folks out there trying to get Linux going
for the first time.  The plain truth is that it just takes longer to get
support built into Linux because it's NOT a commercial venture.  Drivers get
written when the hardware gets into the hands of the gals/guys who can write
them... while they are cramming for exams or squeezing in time around a full
time job, spouse, and kids :-)

<P>
Anyway, thanks! -- John)

<P>
Hello John!

<P>
How goes it??  First of all, I want to congratulate you on your Homeboy 
page...  and especially the Linux Gazette..  I love the concept, the info 
and the attitude!  (only thing I might complain about is how often new 
editions come out.. yeah, I know.. SUBMIT something!!!!)

<P>
	I had a wild idea a while back... you may or may not be familiar 
with Boardwatch magazine,  quite a great rag that covers the BBS and more 
so now, the Internet/Web world, more for the providers than for the 
users.  They have various ongoing articles, on different things related 
to sysoping and online life and such... 

<P>
	Well, you might think Linux would be important there... There was 
a Linux colloumb(sp) for only a couple of months... and it died (perhaps 
because the guy hadnt gotten it installed yet, and talked much about how 
hard it can be!)  People have written about it in letters.. one was 
answered by Jack Ricard (editor) with some of the above complaints, as 
well as that it was kinda boreingly written..  but maybe he'd think about 
giving it another chance...

<P>
	Now we know, YOU arent boring!  And I think you'ld agree, Linux 
and the world could use a lot of people hot to get involved with the Net, 
exposed to, and involved with Linux.. rather than some Microsoft OS....  
Anyway, I think you see what I'm thinking...   Now dont worry, I havent 
volunteered you for anything yet... I probably will write a letter to 
Jack soon, asking him to reconsider a Linux columm, as well as take a 
closer look at Linux itself..

<P>
	I really think it would be appropriate to what Boardwatch is 
about nowadays, and would expose a LOT of the &quot;right&quot; (ie, probably going 
to use it for buisness) people to Linux, which would be very cool...
What do you think??

<P>
Jon

<P>
(Well... I'm flattered at this but, having taken the better part of 3 months
to get this current issue out, I'm not sure that I've got the time to devote

<P>
You are building up quite a collection of useful information on Linux
through LG. But after a while, it will be so massive people will find
it tiring to check all of the titles (and lead paragraphs) when they
try to use it as a reference. I would suggest you look into a search
engine for the on-line versions of LG. The easiest thing to program
would be to grep the entire archive for search phrases a user Web form 
supplies - but the computational load might grow too demanding. If
you have authors specify a set of keywords, especially if selected
from a limited if growable rationalized &quot;orthogonal&quot; set of phrases,
you could greatly speed up such searches.

<P>
Keep up the good work!

<P>
(Well, I not only appreciate the tips, ideas, and corrections regarding
information in the LG, but also ideas about how to improve the Gazette.  I
think that there's a LOT of potential for making the 'Gazette a seriously fun
place to hang out and find info.  I'm not in a position now to set something
like this up, but send these great ideas to the folks at Linux Journal and let
them know what you want! -- John)

For immediate release:  May 20, l996<BR>

<P>

       P.O. Box 11648<BR>
       Blacksburg, Virginia 24062-1648<BR>
          

<P>
     SecureNet PRO is a brand new comprehensive network 
administration and security system that fills an enormous gap 
by providing multiple levels of protection in an economic 
and user friendly package.

<P>
     Administrators will gain the ability to seek and destroy
internal and external intruders.  Through the use of firewalls
and hijacking techniques, they can take action against hackers,
seizing control of their sessions or terminating them at will.

<P>
     The system goes beyond the normal auditing capacity of 
other programs and offers the administrator the capability of 
viewing the sessions of any user on the network in real time.
SecureNet PRO affords the administrator the luxury of 
recording--for possible later view--the sessions of all 
the network users simultaneously. 

<P>
     SecureNet PRO gives the system administrator multiple 
perspectives on his network's activities: he can watch users
in progress, view a previously logged session, or play back a
recorded session at high speed. 

<P>
     &quot;Network security experts are always searching for 
security holes,&quot; said Elliot Turner, Corporate Executive 
Officer of MimeStar, Inc.  &quot;But you can't fix them all.  
You have to be able to see what's going on.&quot;   

<P>
     Once a hacker has been discovered, SecureNet PRO's 
dynamic firewalls come into play.  They allow the 
administrator to control all sessions, locking out access 
to unfriendly users and logging all future access attempts.     

<P>
     &quot;We recognize the fact that this could be a dangerous 
tool in the wrong hands,&quot; said Turner.  &quot;SecureNet PRO uses 
an advanced encryption-based security technique.  It will only
run on the network it was purchased for.&quot;

<P>
     Part of SecureNet PRO's value is that it is user friendly.
Administrators need not deal with cryptic commands and complex
configuration options. 

<P>
     &quot;Our system is completely menu driven,&quot; Turner explained,
making it easy for a growing company to take advantage of the
convenience of a network without having to compromise internal
security.

<P>
     More information on SecureNet PRO is available at the 
MimeStar, Inc. web site:

peacefully coexist in the Linux community right next to non-commercial ones.
Many Linux-oriented businesses -- <B>SSC, Linux Journal, RedHat Software,
Caldera</B> -- to mention a few, have donated resources, money &amp; code back 
to the Linux Development team and others in the Linux Community.  

<P>
While I'm not specifically endorcing SecureNet I do want to encourage folks to
patronize vendors willing to give Linux a shot! -- John)

<P>
Just thought I'd write you about supermount while I'm at it.  I 
recompiled my 1.2.13 kernel a few weeks ago, and decided to throw 
supermount in.  I might have done something, but, I had a less than 
wonderful experience with it.  I use RedHat 3.0.3, BTW, anyways, I 
edited my /etc/inittab as per the README, and rebooted expecting to 
be able to cd /mnt/floppy and do an ls.  Welp, things got screwed up 
somehow, and fsck was reporting a bad superblock on /.  It wasn't 
bad, obviously.  I fixed my /etc/inittab back, and &gt;&gt;WHAMMO!&lt;&lt;  it 
was still broken!  Note, I couldn't access my Linux disk because of 
this screw up.  So, and here is where the utter joy of having an old 
Slackware 1.0 install on /dev/hda2 in perfectly working condition.  
Under the Redhat side, I could read, but not overwrite or edit(due to 
the problem, my root was being mounted read only) the key file.  The 
file giving me problems, oddly enough, was /etc/mtab.  Under the 
Slackware, I rm'ed /etc/mtab on my RedHat disk.  i rebooted the 
redhat partition, and lo and behold, it worked.  So, the story has 
two morals:  A full Slackware install is better than a boot floppy, 
and BACK UP EVERYTHING YOU CHANGE!!  Following these two morals has 
saved me from many a disaster.  TTYL!

<B>Subject: Your article on colorizing /etc/issue<BR></B>

<P>
Dear John M. Fisk

<P>
I can't help wanting to comment on your article `Colorizing /etc/issue'
appearing in Linux Gazette issue #7. I hope you don't take offence, and
that you would consider a follow up article on the subsject after reading
this. 

<P>
The contents of the article concerning escape-sequences is correct and
usable, but only under very limited circumstances. When your Linux (or
any *NIX system for that matter) is used as a standalone system, with no
other terminals than the console and its virtual consoles.

<P>
I am aware that this scenarios is true for many (maybe even the
majority) of Linux systems. As soons as a system is accepting
connnections on any other device (eg. a real terminal attached to
one of the serial ports, incoming connections over modem etc. etc.)
you have absolute no way of telling how escape sequences are interpreted
in the other end of the line. This is the reason for termacap(3) and 
later terminfo(3). It is in general a bad idea to hardcode escape
sequences anywhere. 

<P>
The getty_ps implementation of getty(1M) does however offer a method
for having both a colorized issue for use on the console and the VTs,
and a different a different portable/device-independent issue for other
devices. Other implementation may or may not offer the same level of
control as the getty_ps. 

<P>
If memory serves me did older Slackware distributions recreate the
/etc/issue file during the bootsequence. This is unnecessary and
probably not even a good idea, at least not if you are having several
hosts sharing the /etc-directory. (Trust me on that one it can be done).
Getty(1M) offers a suitable alternative. You simply create an /etc/issue
carrying all the static information, and then let getty(1M) perform
'prompt subsititution' on the varible information. Such as the system
name hostname, the current ttyline, current localtime. The list may vary
from implementation to implementation of getty(1M). The actual syntax
DOES vary. And it appears that not all implementation are consistent with
their documentation.

&gt; know of any other source of good information I'd be delighted to hear<BR>
&gt; about it.<BR>

<P>
The man-page for terminfo is a really good source of information. 
It it has a very good table listing both terminfo capability name,
side by side with the corresponding termcap names. The utillity
tput(1) is of considerable value, both for colorizing shell-scripts
and for other nifty things involving escape sequences. The setterm
utility is also capable of doing a few tricks with colors. I haven't
checked the docs for this though, furthermore it is Linux-only and
should be considered a hack.

<P>
The maintainer of the terminfo database (Eric S. Raymond) has placed
a lot of interesting comments in the source file. When it comes to 
colors he refers to ISO 6429/ANSI.SYS (yes, the one from B^HMS-___ )
XPG4. 

<P>
Lately the Linux terminal driver supports a couple of escape sequences
which performs manipulation of the color palette. These are incooperated
in the latest version of terminfo ( ncurses vers. 1.9.9e). The point
here is that once a terminal type has the ``can change color'' capability
it is no longer ISO6429-compliant nor is it XPG4-compliant, and thus
adding yet a level of complexity to the seemingly simple task. 

<P>
Mr Peter L Jones &lt;thanatos@drealm.org&gt; has written a text called
'linux-console.doc' which was posted on comp.os.linux.announce. This
is a fairly complete description of the terminal drivers capabilities.
A good source of information when proof reading termcap / -info entries.
In case you are unable to find this text please let me know.  

<P>
Another dane (Thorbjoern Ravn Andersen &lt;ravn@imada.ou.dk&gt;) has written a
mini-howto on the subject colour. Most of the information herein, were
covered by you articles on 'colour ls' and 'colourizing /etc/issue'.

<P>
A few years back I had to examine some install scripts (bourne shell)
from a commercial *NIX. They all had hard-coded escape sequences. The
authors were 100% certain as to which platform/environment in which
these were executed and thus felt no need for any fancy portability
considerations. All in all there at least three different situations
for which the choice of method of colorizing may different. 

<P>
  a) scripts/program running exclusively on a known terminal type,

<P>
  b) scripts/program running on a well-known platform, but produces
     output onto any terminal. ( Telnet concections, dial-ins etc)

<P>
  c) scripts/program intended for genral use on a variety of *NIX
     environments.

<P>
I hope you can make something usefull out of these random ramblings

<P>
No ISO6429 compliance as well as XPG4 assumes that the colors are
static. So that color number 0 allways is black, and color 1 is red
and so forth. Furthermore IS06429 only leaves room for 8 colors,
possibly combined with some renditions, (eg. bold or blinking). 
AT least that is how I have interpreted the information I have had
access to. The XPG4 may or may not leave room for more than 8 colors.
I haven't access to the XPG4 itself only references to certain parts.

What it does is to go around and update the whatit file according to what 
it can find in the various manpaths and cat dirs. Of course root's 
MANPATH has to properly set which you should do anyways to have access to

<B>Subject: more emacs<BR></B>

<P>
With apologies to the vi crowd, here's a cool tip
for emacs users.

<P>
Emacs fanatics are no doubt aware that their editor
of choice is designed to be run once and then to
sit in memory.  Problem is, if you set your 
&quot;EDITOR&quot; environment variable to &quot;emacs&quot;, every
new edit will spawn another (monstrous) emacs session
with no buffer-communication between other running
copies of the OTE.

<P>
Ah, you say, but emacs has &quot;server client&quot; options.
Then, sensing someone might not know about this feature,
you add that emacs can be started and told to run as a
server.  Subsequent calls to the program &quot;emacsclient&quot;
will load the data into a new buffer in the emacs
server-fied program.  So just set &quot;EDITOR&quot; to
emacsclient.  Problem is, if you don't already have a
session of emacs up and server-fied, emacsclient won't
start a new one for you.  I find this highly aggravating.
I've found a way around this - I named the following
script &quot;semacs&quot; for smart-emacs or server-emacs.  It
checks for a running emacs session and runs emacsclient
if it is found or starts up a new emacs if it isn't.
You still have to put the line

<PRE>
(server-start)
</PRE>

<P>
in your .emacs file.  Then you can set your EDITOR 
variable to semacs or leave it as emacs and make an
alias for it.  The pathnames in this script may be
different for your system.

<PRE>
----------
#!/bin/sh
numemacs=`ps | grep semacs | wc -l`
if [ $numemacs -gt 3 ]
then
  /usr/bin/emacsclient $* &gt; /dev/null
else
  /usr/bin/emacs $* &gt; /dev/null
fi
----------
</PRE>

<P>
Simple, eh?  I can think of some enhancements.. have
it check the .emacs file for the (server-start) line,
for example.  Anyway, enjoy.

<P>
Oliver &quot;Yes, I know vi fits on a boot/root floppy,
yes set ai is cool and yes, I learned vi first 'K?&quot; Oberdorf

<P>
-- <BR>
Hope you find this tidbit of how I do things amusing.

<P>
(Well, as I've said before, NO APOLOGIES NEEDED!  I'm the one that needs to
apologize for my abysmal lack of &quot;Emacs Know-How&quot;.  I really
appreciate everyone who's written with ideas and tips for emacs.  As everyone
know, &quot;it's not a program... it's a lifestyle!&quot; -- John)

<P>
Hi John, heres a small 2 cent hint, which I find very usefull:

<P>
Both in your VC and your xterms, you can scrollback with shift+pageup, 
and shift+pagedown. This is especially usefull, when you boot your 
machine, and want to see one of the lines which passes by, so quickly. 
And talking about boot, scrolllock apply's here, if you want to stop 
output for a while.

<P>
BTW: how are you doing, it's long time since I've heard from you... bussy 
with scoll? (good boy ;-)

<P>
Kind Regards Jesper.

<P>
PS. I'm following a cource on programming languages (in fact im 
instructor on it too) and there we learn lisp, scheme, sasl etc.
These three all have the same kernel: lisp. This means that I'm a quiet 
good lisp programmer now. Well, you think, what does that mean to me...
Well you remember emacs..It can be configured in millions of ways, when 
you know how to program lisp!
I plan to write an article, which will learn people the basic skills on 
lisp, give them valuable references  to lisp (The info pages), a lot of 
examples, and a basic idea what can be done when you know how to program 
lisp. How do you think about that? Whould that be something you would 
like to include in the Gazette?

<P>
I got an idea: I will create a html document with references to lots of 
small utilities (for emacs) written in lisp!

To: fiskjm@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu<BR>
<B>Subject: some more tips for your LG<BR></B>

<P>
Hi John,

<P>
I found out about LG on issue #6 and since then I read all the issues
and have made a folder with all the issues.  They are *really* very
interesting and although I have used linux for over 4 years now, there
are always little tricks to be learned!  Thanks!

<P>
I am here just sending you a little note on something I noticed in
this last issue #7.

<P>
1) About kscreen and that thread (I know it's been long) but I have
yet one thing I learned off Usenet. When this change of mode happens
(text-&gt;graphics) there's a little utility *already* installed in your
system which does the trick and to me it's easier to remember than the
^v^o trick you published.  The utility is called reset. I have it
under /usr/bin and it is merely a shell script that does the
following:

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
stty sane
tput clear
tput rmacs
tput rmm
tput rmso
tput rmul
tput rs1
tput rs2
tput rs3
echo -e \\033c
</PRE>

<P>
Not sure what all those codes are for (I guess a quick look at man
tput would do the trick ;-) but that's for later... :-)

<P>
Anyway, just another trick that I thought it would be interesting for
the LG readers.

<P>
2) Another thing I wanted to point out was about your intro to shell
programming. In the second part you talk about find in combination
with while read to do some tricks on a lot of files in the current
dir.  Another good construct is the for loop.  In the ldd case it
would be something like:

<PRE>
bash$ for x in *
&gt; do
&gt; echo $x ...
&gt; echo 
&gt; ldd $x
&gt; echo
&gt; done
</PRE>

<P>
The above is just doing the same thing your while read is although I
see two major differences:

<P>
1 - the for loop only looks for files in the current directory while
the find combination looks for files in the current directory and the
subdirectories, i.e., recursively.  If that's what you want to do you
have no other way than using find.

<P>
2 - this example has one advantage though, it is run in only one shell
while the 'find | while read' is spawning a different process for each
pipe, which is not bad but it will just take a little bit longer (if
you are attacking that late sandwich who cares to wait anyway, right?)

<P>
I just wanted to write something about this for loop thingy, it is
really nifty and I use it quite often.  Just in case someone is
interested, in all C sh flavors (csh, tcsh) the construct works like
this:

<PRE>
foreach x (*)
echo $x
end
</PRE>

<P>
There is no 'do done' and the arguments should be given between
parentheses rather than after the 'in' keyword.

<P>
One last tip.  In order to obtain the name of a file without its
extension use 'basename'. This is versus the ## and %% that you
presented that in fact I like better but it is always nice to know
another trick that may be useful some other time, right?

<P>
The basename gives the name of a file up until the dot, so to rename
all files in the current dir from .txt to .text do this:

<PRE>
for x in *.txt
do
mv $x `basename $x txt`text
done
</PRE>

<P>
That will do the trick.  As you can see this basename thingy is pretty
useful. basename filename.txt txt will give filename. and then by
appending the new extension we have the right command.

<P>
Just another tip ;-)

<P>
Hope I've been clear.  As you can see I am just enhancing what you
published, different ways of doing the same things.  Some times the
different ways of doing things may help create better programming
tools.

<P>
Looking forward to the next issue of LG!!!

<P>
Keep up the good work!

construct.  Thanks to all and keep those tips coming! -- John)

Dear John,

<P>
I wondered if you ever wrote anything on lesspipe.sh, the shell script
used by &quot;less&quot; as a preprocessor. It's talked about in &quot;man less&quot;, although
a bit cryptic. It turns out to be of universal help, for most people,
because it unbundles things like tar files, GZs, ZIPs, RPMs, and so on
in a seamless way that is both convenient and easy to maintain. The source
I use on a SUN4 workstation appears below. The linux version has also some
RPM lines for looking into RedHat archives. Expect to find lesspipe.sh in
the same directory as &quot;less&quot;, with execute permissions.

<P>
Excellent work. I have found your gazette good not only for using LINUX
but also taught me some tips to use on UNIX in general, I had always
wondered why appros never worked for me! Your Gazzette is taking up where
UNIX WORLD left off (Unix World changed it's name to Open Systems just after
I took out a subscription. It started talking about client/server, why NT
is important, and how to be a good manager. I did not renew.)

<P>
You can read pdf (acrobat) files on LINUX. You need xpdf from:

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/dn0o/xpdf/xpdf.html">
http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/dn0o/xpdf/xpdf.html</A>

<P>
Source code and several precompiled executables are available.
(Linux, AIX(4.1), SPARC, MIPS, ALPHA)

<P>
This excellent program is invoked 'xpdf filename' whereupon it displys the
pdf file in an X window. You may zoom and rotate the page, and go forward
and backwards page by page. You may incorporate the command into your WEB
broser too see pdf files as you click on them. The archive consists of two
files, a readme and the executable, xpdf. Stick it in your X11/bin. It uses
neither motif or Xt widgets, has no special installation or configuration or
any other requirements (you must be running X!), just download it and launch
it. The executable is 140K in size. This is the program that adobe should
have written, franky it makes adobe look a bit silly, but we allready knew
that disn't we...:-)

<P>
Now, I would like to to set up a printer que where I can send pdf files
directly for printing as postscript. Anybody any ideas?

<B>Subject: Linux Gazette of course!<BR></B>

<P>
Hey,

<P>
Just thought of checking again, and 'lo and behold there's a new one! :-)
You're probably going to get tons of this, but you can change your find and
read FILE script to be something like:

<PRE>
for file in /directory/*; do
	ldd $file
done
</PRE>

<P>
And while we're at it, here are two scripts I use for pgp:

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
# call this pgpd

pgp -f -z 'my_pass_phrase' 2&gt;&amp;1 | awk '
BEGIN {
	intro=0
}
{
	if (intro==1) print;
}
/^$/ {
	intro=1;
}
/^Signature made/ {
	print &quot;--------------------------------------------------------------------&quot;
}
'
</PRE>

<P>
You can pipe a message through this script and pgp will decrypt it and check
it's signature. You don't have to put your passphrase on the command line
if you feel it's insecure, but I use this script in another script so I like
it there. Then here's pgps to sign a message:

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

pgp -stfa -u 'my full name' -z 'my_pass_phrase' 2&gt;/dev/null
</PRE>

<P>
And finally pgpe which encrypts a message:

<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

pgp -stefa -u 'my full name'
</PRE>

<P>
To top it all of, here are two lines of my .vimrc:

<PRE>
ca ps %!pgps
ca pe %!pgpe
</PRE>

<P>
So now to pgp sign an email msg all I do is type &quot;:ps&quot;. To encrypt it I type
&quot;:pe&quot;. Neat eh? The pgpd script comes in handy in my .procmailrc:

<PRE>
:0 BbDf
* -----BEGIN PGP [A-Z ]*MESSAGE-----
|/full/path/name/pgpd
</PRE>

<P>
So now all my incoming pgp e-mail is automatically decoded, and signatures
are checked.

<P>
Tim

<P>
(Thanks, Tim, for the great tips!  PGP is one of those programs that gets a
good deal of well-deserved coverage.   There are a LOT of far-reaching issues
to grapple with in this dawning &quot;Information Age&quot;.  Here's a bit of
help with making things a bit more secure. -- John)

into the Linux Gazette.  I am a recent convert to Linux, and the LG has
proven to be a great source of information and tips. Thanks.

<P>
Also, I thought you might like to see a technique that just sort-of hit me
the other day.  I use it to kill all the processes started by my ppp
scripts (I'm sure there are more elegant ways, but none have occured to me
yet :-).

<PRE>
kill_ppp () { ps | gawk '/ppp/{print $1}/sleep 14m/{print $1}' | xargs 
   kill }
</PRE>

<P>
This makes searching out all the pid's for various ppp programs/scripts
and the sleep calls from the keep-alive scripts (Thanks, again) to kill
them.

<P>
Once more, thank you.

Hi!

<P>
Here's a hint I haven't seen well publicized:
In any xterm, there are three menus available. Hold
down the control key, and either left, middle or right
click on the xterm window. I use the right click most 
often, as it allows you to change the xterm font (and 
window size) on the fly.

hidden all over Linux that make it seriously fun to work with.  Thanks! --

<P>
John:

<P>
I have read your gazette with admiration and interest since the very 
first issue. The material is very useful and my admiration for your 
energy in putting it together is boundless.

<P>
I was interested in the tip from Henry Wong, in issue 7, for clearing up a
console. It really works at the console level but it does not do anything in
an xterm on my machine. However, a program called reset came with my
Slackware distribution and this does work both at regular monitor level and
in an xterm. I also find it easier to type &quot;reset&quot; blind rather than 
&quot;CTL-v CTL-n&quot;. There is even a man page for reset. 

<P>
Best wishes and every success to the Linux Gazette.

<P>
Jim.

<P>
(Yup, this is another one of those &quot;slap-my-forehead&quot; things that
many of you kindly called to my attention.  The &quot;reset&quot; program is a
simple shell script that clears up a garbled terminal quite nicely -- and with
a catchy name to boot, it's probably a bit easier to use :-) -- John)

Hi there John.

<P>
Just writing you to tell you how much I appriciate the Gazette.

<P>
And a short comment to the Kscreen revisited section under 2 cent
tips.

<P>
I keep forgetting those ^v^o keystrokes. I find it a lot easier just
typing &quot;reset&quot; which from my pov. does exactly the same, namely
unclutters the screen.

<P>
Just my 2 cents!

<P>
Keep up the good work.

<P>
Hi there!

<P>
in article Changing that xterm titlebar interactively!
	
<P>
file:./lg/linux_gazette.nov.html#xtitle

<P>
you wrote

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>
	Thing is, you need to be using the C Shell in order to make 
	this work because it uses the &quot;cwd&quot; variable to keep track 
	of where you are.  In the process of tinkering around with 
	this I wasn't able to get BASH to cooperate, BUT, ...[snip]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Here is what I suggest you to put in your .bash_profile  
(or /etc/profile if ALL your users agree).

<P>
This code will interactively update the title of your xterm window
to show the name of the tty used (without the /dev/ ), the dimentions
in columns x rows, as shown from the fvwm manager during resizing,
and the current working directory.

<PRE>
------------------------
if [ $0 = &quot;-bash&quot; ]	# needed only in
then			# /etc/profile

	xsize()
	{
	        set -- $(stty size)
	        export SIZE=&quot;  $2 x $1  &quot;
	        xtitle
	}

	TTY=$(tty | xargs basename); export TTY

	xtitle()
	{
		if [ &quot;$TERM&quot; = &quot;xterm&quot; ]
		then    echo -n &quot;^[]2;$TTY  $SIZE     $PWD^G&quot;
		# in VIM hit: &quot;,Ctrl-V,Esc,],...etc...,Ctrl-V,Ctrl-G,&quot;
		fi
	}

	export PROMPT_COMMAND=&quot;xtitle&quot;
	export -f xsize xtitle

	xsize   # for the first time

	trap xsize SIGWINCH

fi	# needed if in /etc/profile
-------------------------
</PRE>

<P>
This code will define 2 new vars $SIZE and $TTY plus 2 functions:
xtitle() that writes the title of the Xterm window at every prompt of
the bash, and xsize() that sets the var $SIZE every time the window
changes.

<P>
If you cut and paste, don't forget to retype the Ctrl-V Esc and 
Ctrl-V Ctrl-G sequencies in the xtitle() !

<P>
I don't use the time in the title, because X is plenty of clocks.
I have put the line

<PRE>
Style &quot;oclock&quot;     NoTitle,            Sticky, WindowListSkip, StaysOnTop
</PRE>

<P>
in the stanza
<PRE>
# Set the decoration styles and window options
</PRE>

<P>
of file /usr/X11/lib/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc

<P>
In this way the clock stays on top of every window, always visible!

<P>
Have fun &amp; Ciao!	Fabrizio Polacco &lt;fpolacco@megabaud.fi&gt;
