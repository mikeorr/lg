You know, I personally think it'd be perfectly OK to publish threads
like these I'm forwarding as TAG threads, in the magazine.  That <em>is</em>
the main reason I keep forwarding them.

Subject: Debian installer does not recognise ataraid array
Date: 18 Jul 2006 03:14:30 -0700
</pre>
I have two SATA HDs on a Silicon Simage 3112 RAID controller. This is
known as "fakeraid" or "ataraid" because it's not a proper hardware
RAID controller, it just buggers about with on-the-fly address
translations in the controller's BIOS. So it's a bit like software RAID
- and indeed inferior to Linux software RAID - but this is a dual-boot
box, which is why I'm using it. (Honestly, it makes Windows a <strong>lot</strong>
faster, like 50%+.)
</p>

<p>
So, I want to install Debian on it. I managed it under 2.4 by manually
coaxing the medley.o module into place, to recognise the array and let
me install on it. On the way I found and reported several bugs: a
conflict between siimage.o and via82cxxx.o (which is still unsolved in
kernel-source-2.4.27), the fact that ataraid modules were not loaded by
the installer, and the fact that medley.o was missing from the mkinitrd
script, which meant that I couldn't boot after the install!
</p>

<p>
I'm not sure if that second one is solved yet, but it doesn't matter
because this time I'm trying to install 2.6 (I am reinstalling rather
than upgrading because I made a ton of changes to the partition
structure). I know that 2.6 doesn't use the medley module, and that all
the fakeraid stuff is dealt with by something called the device mapper,
and a user-space tool called dmraid.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately I don't know any more than that, like how they work. When
I use the latest Debian installer CD, it boots 2.6 and finds all my
hardware and offers me sda and sdb as my HDs - it completely fails to
notice the fakeraid array.
</p>

<p>
Yes I have brought this to Debian's attention, but I'm asking here
because I really need to just know a few more basics about ataraid
handling in 2.6.x and the device mapper - can anyone point me towards a
HOWTO or idiot's guide for that?
</p>

<p>
Grateful also for any other advice on how to diagnose this problem. I
presume that the low-level hardware driver (sata_sil.o in this case) is
still needed - this is what's finding sda and sdb. But I don't know
what to do once that's loaded to find the ataraid array, and therefore
I don't know how to find out where the Debian installer is going
astray.

Haven't used any of those fakeraid controllers, but from the

It looks like you are perhaps just using the wrong distro? For
some desktop I'd try out FC 5 and see if this works better.

This URL seems to suggest it:

Red hat's Fedora Core can be used to install Linux on your RAID
set. Download Fedora Core here: <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">http://fedora.redhat.com/</a>

Much obliged, my good sir!  I do try; but you're welcome to flatter me
any time.  ;-&gt;

New to my stable of documentation, but very similar to the above:

(Serial Attached SCSI is doing to Ultra320 what SATA did to PATA --
except a lot faster.  SAS-chipset support is starting to be a real
issue with Linux distro installer refreshes.)

[snip details of your plan to try again using the Debian d-i installer's
"bf2.6" installation flavour]
</p>

<p>
Chris, I read your post last night, and at the time was very impressed
with your thorough approach to both the testing process and recounting
of same on this newsgroup.  Like Michael Heiming, who kindly posted the
link to my Linux on SATA page, I have little practical experience with 
fakeraid controllers -- and just about everything I know on the subject
is already on the aforementioned page.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Yes I have brought this to Debian's attention, but I'm asking here
&gt; because I really need to just know a few more basics about ataraid
&gt; handling in 2.6.x and the device mapper - can anyone point me towards a
&gt; HOWTO or idiot's guide for that?
</pre>

<p>
I've not yet found one, and I've really looked extensively (though not
lately).  In addition to the dmraid resources linked from my SATA page,
please see if the udev-related entries on
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Kernel">http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Kernel</a> are any use to you -- since hotplug,
udev, sysfs, and the devicemapper all work closely in 2.6.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, my understanding is that the ataraid software layer is
2.4-specific, and dmraid <em>is</em> ataraid for 2.6.  (You may have meant
simply "Linux parsing of ATA fakeraid disk semantics", in which case 
no criticism intended, and I'm just being careful to disambiguate.)
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Grateful also for any other advice on how to diagnose this problem. I
&gt; presume that the low-level hardware driver (sata_sil.o in this case) is
&gt; still needed - this is what's finding sda and sdb.

<p>
Correct.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; But I don't know what to do once that's loaded to find the ataraid
&gt; array, and therefore I don't know how to find out where the debian
&gt; installer is going astray. 
</pre>

<p>
My impression is that you're not missing anything, except the extremely
high likelihood that the current Debian installer ("d-i") doesn't have
dmraid support in the installation kernel.  Now, what you <em>could</em> do is
to install some other leading-edge distribution, e.g., FC5, and then do
a chroot installation of Debian, using the other distro's infrastructure
support for dmraid to accomplish the job.  You'd then compile a
dmraid-supporting kernel inside the chroot jail before rebooting.
</p>

<p>
(See:  "Installers" on <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Debian">http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Debian</a> on how to do
chroot installs.  It's actually pretty easy, and interesting to do.)
</p>

<p>
See also:
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/ataraid-list/2005-July/msg00014.html">http://www.redhat.com/archives/ataraid-list/2005-July/msg00014.html</a>
</p>

<p>
The existence of this "udeb" package suggests that my suspicion about
d-i is correct:  Such packages are useful in constructing custom
installer images.  (There are lots of such custom installer images
catalogued on the aforementioned "Installers" page; might be one with
dmraid support.)
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/debian-installer/dmraid-udeb">http://packages.debian.org/unstable/debian-installer/dmraid-udeb</a>
</p>

<p>
That package should not be confused with userspace package "dmraid",
which is the glue to control fakeraid operations via devicemapper:

<p>
Good luck.
