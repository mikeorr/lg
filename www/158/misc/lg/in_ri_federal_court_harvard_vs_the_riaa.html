                  HARVARD PROFESSOR &amp; STUDENTS FIGHT THE RIAA:
                       COME TO RHODE ISLAND FEDERAL COURT
                         TO PROTECT DEFENDANT'S FAMILY
                                        
                       Now it's his parents. Who's next?
    
   Cambridge, MA (December 2008) - At a Dec. 15 hearing in Rhode Island
   federal court, Harvard Law School Professor Charles Nesson and his team of
   students will defend Rhode Island residents Arthur and Judie Tenenbaum
   from the full might of the U.S. recording industry's combined lobbying and
   litigating power.  The Tenenbaums face legal pressure from the industry's
   lawsuit against their son, Joel, a graduate student at Boston University
   accused of sharing music files online. 
    
   Nesson and his team allege that the Recording Industry Association of
   America and a coalition of record companies are abusing the federal court
   system with their litigation tactics, which attempt to make an example out
   of Joel and his family in the name of "deterrence."  Joel faces possible
   damages of more than $1 million for allegedly sharing seven songs on the
   Kazaa file-sharing network. 
    
   The Dec. 15 hearing will address the recording industry's motion to force
   Arthur and Judie to produce their home computer so that it can be
   inspected for evidence of copyright infringement. The computer is not the
   device on which the alleged downloading took place, and Arthur and Judie
   did not own the computer when Joel lived with them.
    
   "The basic rules of evidence suggest that this invasion of privacy is both
   unnecessary and absurd," said Matt Sanchez, one of Nesson's students
   working on the case.  "This hearing isn't only about Joel's parents.  It's
   also about finally putting up a fight against the recording industry's
   intimidation practices."
    
   The hearing is scheduled for December 15 at 10:00 AM at the Federal
   Building and Courthouse, One Exchange Terrace, Providence, RI 02903 in
   Courtroom A, before Magistrate Judge Lincoln D. Almond.  Interviews will
   be available with Charles Nesson and his students immediately following
   the hearing.

Actually, I just finished reading 'The Public Domain: Enclosing the

to their monopoly, there's a very real aversion to the notion of the
public domain (I, for one, had never appreciated that to be the case).

It is certainly possible to represent almost any viewpoint as being
reasonable; I recall reading about someone (Daniel Webster, possibly?)
who on a bet took up, sequentially, two sides of a debate and won both
times. The real question is, what is the greatest good? Does RIAA's
"real aversion" trump all other rights? Does copyright trump the right
of ownership? I, for one, consider the current status of this to be
completely abhorrent.
</p>

<p>
Surely, the recording companies do provide a service and deserve to be
compensated for it. That does not mean that they have the right to
arbitrarily sue anyone they want for millions of dollars and put them in
jail just because they shared a song with someone. They certainly don't
(or shouldn't) have the right to make up their own legal systems - guilt
by association, in this case - and try people under those.
</p>

<p>
Terror tactics and violence are rights that governments reserve only for
themselves (i.e., the government has the right to scare you into
compliance, and to take away your freedom or kill you if you don't obey;
that's central to all government everywhere.) If it is illegal for us as
individuals to do those things, then it should certainly be illegal for
any group or association as well.

Ok, that came across poorly. I didn't mean just the RIAA (or any
similar monopolist's club). The most illustrating thing for me was his
explanation of the phrase 'the tragedy of the commons'--maybe it's
because I descend from the losing side of that one, but I'd never
given that view-point much thought, and, as Boyle explains it, that
view point goes a great length towards explaining not why the RIAA et
al. try to have laws favourable only to themselves passed--that much
is obvious--but why they succeed. (It's certainly a more satisfactory
explanation than putting it down to corrupt judges and politicians, if
only because I doubt even the RIAA have enough money to buy off <strong>all</strong>
of them <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Or, perhaps I should just quote the man's own words, rather than
further mangle them <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<pre>
"The question is not whether the Internet should be an intellectual
property-free zone; it should not be, is not, and never was. The
question is whether, when the content industries come asking for
<strong>additional</strong> or <strong>new</strong> rights, for <strong>new</strong> penalties, for the
criminalization of certain types of technology, we should take into
account the gains that the Internet has brought them, as well
as the costs, before we accede to their requests. The answer, of
course, is that we should. Sadly, we did not.
[...]
"There is a fairly solid tradition in intellectual property policy of
what I call "20/20 downside" vision. All of the threats posed by any
new technology--the player piano, the jukebox, the photocopier, the
VCR, the Internet--are seen with extraordinary clarity. The
opportunities, however, particularly those which involve changing a
business model or restructuring a market, are dismissed as phantoms.
The downside dominates the field, the upside is invisible. The story
of video recorders is the best-known example. When video
recorders--another technology promising cheaper copying--first
appeared, the reaction of movie studios was one of horror. [...]
Hollywood tried to have them taxed to pay for the losses that would be
caused. Their assumption? Cheaper copying demands stronger rights.
"Having lost that battle, the movie studios tried to have the
manufacturers of the recording devices found liable for contributory
copyright infringement; [...] The movie studios' claims were rejected.
[...]
"Until the triumph of DVDs, the videocassette rental market made up
more than 50 percent of the movie industry's revenues[...] A cheaper
copying technology definitely caused losses. But it
also provided substantial gains, gains that far outweighed the losses.
Ironically, had the movie companies "won" in the Sony case, they might
now be worse off."

&gt;
</pre>

<p>
That's exactly the case Mr. Nesson is making:
</p>

<pre>
"The statutory scheme that Plaintiffs are wielding against
Joel and thousands of others like him empowers the plaintiffs to
initiate and prosecute massive numbers of punitive actions. The
statutory scheme gives their association, the RIAA, unbridled
discretion to sue millions of individuals like the Defendant,
and to threaten expensive time-consuming process and a
bankrupting verdict against anyone with the effrontery and
stamina to resist. This is an unconstitutional delegation by
Congress of executive prosecutorial powers to private hands. A
statutory scheme such as this one is "legislative delegation in
its most obnoxious form; for it is not even delegation to an
official or an official body," Carter v. Carter Coal, 298 U.S.
238 (1936)."

<p>
It is illegal:
</p>

<p>
'Abuse of process consists of a "perversion of lawfully
initiated process to illegitimate ends." Heck v. Humphrey, 512
U.S. 477, 486 n. 5 (1994) (citations omitted). "One who uses a
legal process ... against another primarily to accomplish a
purpose for which it is not designed, is subject to liability to
the other for harm caused by the abuse of process." Restatement
(2nd) of Torts &amp;sect; 682. Plaintiffs are abusing the federal process
because their suit against Joel Tenenbaum has nothing whatsoever
to do with seeking redress for losses he may have caused. Their
ulterior goal is to sacrifice him in the name of "deterrence"'

Unfortunately, that rings a little hollow when used as an argument for
the RIAA. The Tragedy of the Commons <strong>is</strong> a very important consideration
in, e.g., on-line communities, and should be required reading for anyone
involved in running one (it was, in fact, the major factor that
destroyed USENET - at least in my opinion), but using that possibility
to maintain a permanent death grip on artistic expression is a
ridiculous case of FUD. Have you heard of the Tragedy of the
Anticommons?

&gt; --maybe it's
&gt; because I descend from the losing side of that one, but I'd never
&gt; given that view-point much thought, and, as Boyle explains it, that
&gt; view point goes a great length towards explaining not why the RIAA et
&gt; al. try to have laws favourable only to themselves passed--that much
&gt; is obvious--but why they succeed. (It's certainly a more satisfactory
&gt; explanation than putting it down to corrupt judges and politicians, if
&gt; only because I doubt even the RIAA have enough money to buy off <strong>all</strong>
&gt; of them <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</pre>

<p>
As a general statement, legal systems exist to maintain and protect the
<em>status quo</em>; their bailiwick does not include (you might even say that
it intentionally excludes) anything new and different. Peer-to-peer
networks for sharing information are not only new - they go directly
counter to established systems. So does Open Source.
</p>

<p>
(Incidentally: I, personally, have no dog in this fight. I've used
Limewire maybe four times when it first became available, and have
pretty much ignored that side of the world ever since.)
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Or, perhaps I should just quote the man's own words, rather than
&gt; further mangle them <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
&gt; 
&gt; "The question is not whether the Internet should be an intellectual
&gt; property-free zone; it should not be, is not, and never was.
</pre>

<p>
His saying so does not, of course, make this true. The <strong>entire</strong> Internet
is, of course, not "an intellectual property-free zone" - but the entire
Internet is not any one thing no matter what (except, perhaps, a
network.)
</p>


<pre>
&gt; The
&gt; question is whether, when the content industries come asking for
&gt; <strong>additional</strong> or <strong>new</strong> rights, for <strong>new</strong> penalties, for the
&gt; criminalization of certain types of technology, we should take into
&gt; account the gains that the Internet has brought them, as well
&gt; as the costs, before we accede to their requests. The answer, of
&gt; course, is that we should. Sadly, we did not.
</pre>

<p>
True, and accurate. And yet, where are the judges who know enough to
make such decisions? I suspect - in fact, I'm certain - that the next
generation, or perhaps the one after that, will have such judges; the
current one does not.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; [...]
&gt; "There is a fairly solid tradition in intellectual property policy of
&gt; what I call "20/20 downside" vision. All of the threats posed by any
&gt; new technology--the player piano, the jukebox, the photocopier, the
&gt; VCR, the Internet--are seen with extraordinary clarity. The
&gt; opportunities, however, particularly those which involve changing a
&gt; business model or restructuring a market, are dismissed as phantoms.
&gt; The downside dominates the field, the upside is invisible.
</pre>

<p>
The above is essentially a paraphrase of McLuhan. There are few
surprises here.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; The story
&gt; of video recorders is the best-known example. When video
&gt; recorders--another technology promising cheaper copying--first
&gt; appeared, the reaction of movie studios was one of horror. [...]
&gt; Hollywood tried to have them taxed to pay for the losses that would be
&gt; caused. Their assumption? Cheaper copying demands stronger rights.
</pre>

<p>
Their assumption was exactly that of the RIAA - that they have an
eternal right to their current business model, and no damn new-fangled
invention is going to affect that.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; "Having lost that battle, the movie studios tried to have the
&gt; manufacturers of the recording devices found liable for contributory
&gt; copyright infringement; [...] The movie studios' claims were rejected.
&gt; [...]
&gt; "Until the triumph of DVDs, the videocassette rental market made up
&gt; more than 50 percent of the movie industry's revenues[...] A cheaper
&gt; copying technology definitely caused losses. But it
&gt; also provided substantial gains, gains that far outweighed the losses.
&gt; Ironically, had the movie companies "won" in the Sony case, they might
&gt; now be worse off."
</pre>

<p>
Yes, but - and here's the big one - the movies studios had to <strong>adapt</strong>.
They had to learn how to operate in this new world - which meant making
changes, hiring new people, accepting new ideas. Traditionalists hate
that - despite the fact that doing so successfully means much more
money (if for no reason other than the population growth over time.)
</p>

<p>
This is what the RIAA's position is currently; being dragged into the
future while screaming "NOOOOOOOO!!!!" at the top of their lungs and
dragging their nails on the asphalt. They can't stop it - but they can
do a lot of damage to a lot of people along the way, just as they're
doing now.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; &gt; Surely, the recording companies do provide a service and deserve to be
&gt; &gt; compensated for it. That does not mean that they have the right to
&gt; &gt; arbitrarily sue anyone they want for millions of dollars and put them in
&gt; &gt; jail just because they shared a song with someone. They certainly don't
&gt; &gt; (or shouldn't) have the right to make up their own legal systems - guilt
&gt; &gt; by association, in this case - and try people under those.
&gt; 
&gt; That's exactly the case Mr. Nesson is making:
</pre>

<p>
Ah. Nice to know that, despite having essentially no legal education, I
can still tell right from wrong. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; &gt; Terror tactics and violence are rights that governments reserve only for
&gt; &gt; themselves (i.e., the government has the right to scare you into
&gt; &gt; compliance, and to take away your freedom or kill you if you don't obey;
&gt; &gt; that's central to all government everywhere.) If it is illegal for us as
&gt; &gt; individuals to do those things, then it should certainly be illegal for
&gt; &gt; any group or association as well.
&gt; 
&gt; It is illegal:
&gt; 
&gt; 'Abuse of process consists of a "perversion of lawfully
&gt; initiated process to illegitimate ends." Heck v. Humphrey, 512
&gt; U.S. 477, 486 n. 5 (1994) (citations omitted). "One who uses a
&gt; legal process ... against another primarily to accomplish a
&gt; purpose for which it is not designed, is subject to liability to
&gt; the other for harm caused by the abuse of process." Restatement
&gt; (2nd) of Torts &amp;sect; 682. Plaintiffs are abusing the federal process
&gt; because their suit against Joel Tenenbaum has nothing whatsoever
&gt; to do with seeking redress for losses he may have caused. Their
&gt; ulterior goal is to sacrifice him in the name of "deterrence"'

&gt;&gt; &gt; It is certainly possible to represent almost any viewpoint as being
&gt;&gt; &gt; reasonable; I recall reading about someone (Daniel Webster, possibly?)
&gt;&gt; &gt; who on a bet took up, sequentially, two sides of a debate and won both
&gt;&gt; &gt; times. The real question is, what is the greatest good? Does RIAA's
&gt;&gt; &gt; "real aversion" trump all other rights? Does copyright trump the right
&gt;&gt; &gt; of ownership? I, for one, consider the current status of this to be
&gt;&gt; &gt; completely abhorrent.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ok, that came across poorly. I didn't mean just the RIAA (or any
&gt;&gt; similar monopolist's club). The most illustrating thing for me was his
&gt;&gt; explanation of the phrase 'the tragedy of the commons'
&gt;
&gt; Unfortunately, that rings a little hollow when used as an argument for
&gt; the RIAA. The Tragedy of the Commons <strong>is</strong> a very important consideration
&gt; in, e.g., on-line communities, and should be required reading for anyone
&gt; involved in running one (it was, in fact, the major factor that
&gt; destroyed USENET - at least in my opinion), but using that possibility
&gt; to maintain a permanent death grip on artistic expression is a
&gt; ridiculous case of FUD. Have you heard of the Tragedy of the
&gt; Anticommons?

"A set of pharmaceutical process patents for 'evaluating and improving
the safety of immunization schedules' (Classen v. Biogen et al.; see
US Patents 6,420,139; 6,638,379; 5,728,385; 5,723,283) were held to be
invalid due to unpatentability. The decision was appealed to the US
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, but was upheld with a terse
citation to In re Bilski (which decision we discussed here). Here's
the entire text of the appeals decision: 'In light of our decision in
In re Bilski, 545 F.3d 943 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (en banc), we affirm the
district court's grant of summary judgment that these claims are
invalid under 35 U.S.C. 101. Dr. Classen's claims are neither "tied to
a particular machine or apparatus" nor do they "transform a particular
article into a different state or thing." Bilski, 545 F.3d at 954.
Therefore we affirm.' It will be interesting to see what happens when
these same standards start getting applied to software-related

<p>
I've been working on Polish-English machine translation for a while,
and having parallel text is something of a must for me. So, I OCRd
some books I found on the internet, proofread them, and sent them to
Project Gutenberg. Under American Law, that's perfectly legal--the
books are in the public domain--but I'm not American, and am
<strong>possibly</strong> guilty of copyright infringement under EU law, because EU
copyright law has a bunch of ideas that American law doesn't, such as
the 'natural rights' of authors (not that it isn't frequently referred
to, but it has no constitutional basis in American law) and 'sweat of
the brow' rights. The act of sticking a book on a scanner may be
enough to create a new copyright in the EU, in which case I may be
screwed--it's highly unlikely, not least because nothing can stop PG
from distributing the e-texts, but it's a possibility.

With online MP3 sales, they're doing quite well, thank you very much,
without even the cost of the plastic and paper of a CD. They have TV
companies footing the bill for the latest manufactured pop stars. They
have lower sales, but they also have lower costs, but somehow that'll
be overlooked.

It still remains to be seen if the court agrees that this is what's
happening in this case. OTOH, the RIAA have made statements recently
to say that they won't be chasing after people in this manner in the
future. I'd be surprised if that's the truth, but there's at least a
little hope.

&gt; Project Gutenberg. Under American Law, that's perfectly legal--the
&gt; books are in the public domain--but I'm not American, and am
&gt; <strong>possibly</strong> guilty of copyright infringement under EU law, because EU
&gt; copyright law has a bunch of ideas that American law doesn't, such as
&gt; the 'natural rights' of authors (not that it isn't frequently referred
&gt; to, but it has no constitutional basis in American law) and 'sweat of
&gt; the brow' rights. The act of sticking a book on a scanner may be
&gt; enough to create a new copyright in the EU, in which case I may be
&gt; screwed--it's highly unlikely, not least because nothing can stop PG
&gt; from distributing the e-texts, but it's a possibility.

I assume you're referring to the "moral rights of authors" codified in
the 1928 Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic
Works treaty's section 6bis:  right of attributed authorship, right of
anonymity, and right to preserve the integrity of the creative work.
(This is distinct from any economic rights, and can be waived or in some
places assigned to the custody of others, but not sold.)  
</p>

<p>
The USA's position at the time it ratified the Berne Convention was that 
no specific legislation was required to implement authors' moral rights, 
because they were adequately covered by existing tort laws of other
sort.  This assertion was proabably disingenuous when stated:  It's
probably closer to the truth that Congress merely was suspicious of
legal innovations coming from Continental civil-law tradition -- but
there was some truth in it.

&gt; It still remains to be seen if the court agrees that this is what's
&gt; happening in this case. OTOH, the RIAA have made statements recently
&gt; to say that they won't be chasing after people in this manner in the
&gt; future. I'd be surprised if that's the truth, but there's at least a
&gt; little hope.
</pre>

<p>
I suppose it is theoretically possible that RIAA might tell the truth
one day, yes -- if only through mishap.
