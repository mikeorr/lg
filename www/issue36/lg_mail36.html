Subject: <font color="maroon">I have two ideas for articles.</font> 
<P>
I am a new user to the Linux community. I have two ideas for articles that I would read, print, and distribute to the other Linux newbees that I know.
<P>
1. PPP using minicom. I have read several articles on using PPP, pppd, minicom and other dialup and networking issues. Being a new, however, I would find it very valuable to read "the definitive new users guide to configuring PPP on Linux". I've gotten a lot of pointers and some advanced tips, but what I'd like to see is how to setup a stand alone Linux 2.0.x machine (Red Hat v4 in my case) for dialing up via PPP using minicom with dhcp and dns provided by an ISP.
<P>
2. basic xfree86 / fvwm95 config tricks. For example, how to change the word "start" on the menu button at the bottom of fvwm95 to ANYTHING else! I kick Bill Gate off my PC for a reason! I don't find it cute, funny, nor reassuring to see the "I want to be windows95 'Start'" button on my Linux machine. 
<P>
also, how to use icons, get rid of the "virtual" desktop so that I can see my entire window without scrolling.
<P>
Thank you very much, the Linux Gazette has proven to be a valuable resource!

Hi, I'm trying to connect to netware 3.12 servers.  I am using the
IPX module and ncpfs 2.2.0.7-1 (for Debian 2.0).  Now, I don't use
the auto_primary and auto_interface since a number of old posts
recommend adding the ipx interface manually.
<P>
I use:
<PRE> 
ipx_interface add -p eth0 802.3 xxxxxxxx

When I cat /proc/net/ipx_interface:
<PRE> 
Network    Node_Address   Primary   Device    Frame_Type
xxxxxxxx   yyyyyyyyyyyy   Yes       eth0      802.3

When I try to slist, I get:

<P>
Hi, I would seriously appreciate any help you can give. I had the
evaluation copy of SuSE 5.3 running fine on this machine. I loaded the full
version of SuSE 5.3 and the Token ring went south. During install
everything went fine, including loading the token ring module. I have
replaced the ibmtr.o module file from a working machine with  _no_  change
in the error. I also checked the /etc/conf.modules file to make sure the
alias is defined right ( alias tr0 ibmtr.o ) and the options line is right
( options ibmtr io=0xa20 ). At this point I see two options, reload the
machine with the eval copy and do an upgrade or recompile the kernel and
hope for the best.

<P>
I am writing a Tcl/Tk program that prints info about the CPU, memory
usage, processes, and disk usage of a Linux computer. On problem I have
is in getting info about the CPU. Because the contents (ie field names)
of /proc/cpuinfo may vary from one machine (perhaps kernel build is the
right answer) to the next, I decided to use the program uname. However,
this also doesn't work well, and simply lists my processor as "unknown".
I looked at the source code, and "unknown" is the default value for the
CPU!
<P>
So my question is, is there any way to write a program that can get the
type of CPU on any Linux computer?

Thank you, anyone.

How about something a little more stable, how about an operating system
that will go for at least a year. Is that to much to ask?  One might
well wonder were we not acquainted with the genie in the bottle, yes
'Linux'.
<P>
Linux is gaining in popularity, that makes it commercial, that means
money, and money means more thinkers are turning their attention towards
it as a viable alternative to some of it's less exciting competition.
Linux is a stable operating system, freely available, an operating
system for Man All Born Equal as written in the American constitution,
yes could this operating system level out the playing field.
<P>
Artificial Intelligence requires a very stable platform, and I believe
that given the limitations of  present day hardware, AI requires an
operating system with a small foot print in order to possibly tackle the
problem of achieving any potential of new thought, which could possibly
be termed artificial intelligence in it's true sense. Linux is a Unix
operating system, it can be and usually is networked, this is a plus
when it comes to composing an AI operating programme.

The very makeup and variable structure lends it's self to AI.

wow.  $140 for a keyboard because it has fewer keys?  I simply don't think the

<li>control not being next to A should never be a problem for anyone who'd dare
call him/herself a hacker, happy or otherwise - if you can't figure out how to

ctrl-[ anyway

Subject: <font color="maroon">Re: IMAP on Linux: A Practical Guide </font> 
<P>
I have some comments on the article written by David Jao. There are some
inaccuracies that I need to correct. We use IMAP here and it is indeed
excellent technology.
<ul>
<li>NS 4.08 is out. NS 4.5 is actually pretty stable when it comes to IMAP
based
mail, we have no problems using it.
<li>By default, imapd uses UNIX spool. This is horrendously inefficient.
So I am not
surprised by it crashing over 1000 messages. HOWEVER, if you change the
mailbox format to something like mbx (Modify the Makefile, change
unixproto to mbxproto), it can easily handle much more messages and
allow concurrent access. I have users with
8000 messages in their in box with not problem. 
<li>Netscape is now beta testing Linux versions of their Messaging and
Directory servers.
<li>There is one more way to do IMAP securely and that is to use stunnel
under IMAP.
</ul>

Subject: <font color="maroon">Editor's Choice Awards: Most Desired Port?</font> 
<P>
This is on your "Editor's Choice Awards", esp. the following from your
article "Most Desired Port--QuarkXPress":
<blockquote><font color="navy">
For layout, we must have an MS Windows 95 machine in order to run
QuarkXPress... We are more than ready to be rid of this albatross and
have a total Linux shop. Next, like everyone else, we'd like Adobe to
port all its products to Linux. 
</font></blockquote> 

I'm a professional DTPer and a Linux user myself. So I would certainly
like to see the whole Acrobat suite for Linux as well as good font and
printing solutions from Adobe. And, of course, I don't have anything
against porting PM, Frame, PShop, Illustrator, or XPress to the penguin
platform. No doubt about it.
<P>
I find it problematic, however, that hardly anybody in the DTP area
seems to do justice to the fact that there is a complete suite for our
kind of work coming up just NOW: Corel promised repeatedly to port
_all_ their DTP programs to Linux: Ventura, Draw, PhotoPaint as well as
a lot of helpful apps like WordPerfect and their whole Office suite.
(See eg www.zdnet.co.uk/news/1998/45/ns-6073.html)
<P>
This would be an incredible step forward for Linux -- but somehow
nobody in DTP seems to care. I wonder why?
<P>
Of course, I'm fully aware of the bad reputation Corel software has
among DTPers (and also how much of this they deserved). But I can
assure you and everybody from daily, first hand experience that the
situation has incredibly improved over the last years. Today the Corel
DTP apps brings a wealth of functionality to the users that, as a whole,
is unmatched by anything I know in this area.
<P>
I'm also aware that this will not be enough to make XPress users
really consider a switch and that they have perfectly good reasons for
this attitude. But, nevertheless, I would appreciate it VERY much if
the Corel announcements would at least be taken into account when
talking about this area. If Corel keep their promise there will be a
complete publishing suite for Linux very soon. And I would ask
everybody to spread the good news, esp. those who may be held "opinion
leaders" by many people out there. I'm sure it would be a real loss for
everybody if Corel would get second thoughts about their plans because
of apparent "lack of demand" among professional DTPers.
<P>
Just in case you are prepared to look a little more at this I'm
attaching some more material on the aptness of Corel DTP software.
<P>
Kind regards,<BR>

Subject: <font color="maroon">Corel Ventura would be best DTP port</font> 
<P>
I agree that Linux needs a DTP program, but the one which should be
desired is Corel Ventura Publisher, not Quark. CVP version 8 is at least
one generation ahead of Quark and include many features which we use
regularly =97 features which are completely absent from Quark. It is
more powerful and easier to use. From my perspective, Quark shows all
the signs of product arrogance which arises from having a monopoly, or
near monopoly, in a field.
<P>
Another point: Corel Corp has made a commitment to Linux. Adobe and
Quark, to my knowledge have not. Why not support those who support you,
especially when those who support you have the best product?
<P>
Just a couple of thoughts...
<P>
Sincerely,

Over 512 computers were assembled for the CLOWN (CLuster Of Working Nodes)

povray (a ray tracing program used to calculate frames for a film), Cactus,

  Hmmm.  I take exception to this.  We (Collective Technologies) have many
reasons for being at LISA.  Like any business, we work to get name
recognition.  We want people to know who we are.  But we also seek to
educate our members (look in the rear of the Attendee List for the list by
company and you will see how many of us went -- I think we have the largest
number of attendees) and give back to the System Administration community at
large.  Take a look at the Technical Talks and BoFs and you will find four
events each sponsored by a Collective Technologies member.  Five of our
members also wrote summaries for SANS in the August issue of ;login:.
<P> 
  I hope no one sees this as a marketing message and my intention is not to
try to sell my company on a Linux mailing list.  The point is that we do
all of this without tootin' our own horn that much.  I think reducing our
booth to a "Want-Ad" type booth is a little unfair.  I normally wouldn't
post a message like this on this list, but couldn't let the '...there for
sole reason of trying to recruit people...' comment pass, especially since
we were the first company listed.  No ill will, I just wanted to clear that

As to the quote, I'll stick to the attribution until someone provides a

ABSTRACT
<P>
In preparation for my requesting Legislative hearings
in 1999, this article explains my vision of the
Minnesota Public Digital Network (MPDN), which is:
<P>
1) to provide every Minnesota citizen with a
secure and authenticated email address within
the mn.us hierarchy,
<P>
2) to assure that every citizen can use email
to dialogue with the elected and the appointed
offices of government,
<P>
3) to assure that every local community has a
high speed digital network and a repository for
the creative works and letters of the Minnesota
people, and
<P>
4) to collect the free software tools necessary
to attain these goals, within the Government
Information Freedom Toolbox (the GIFT), which will
be created as a byproduct of Minnesota State
government's conversion to free software.
<P>
EXCERPT
<P>
GOAL 1) Effective immediately, freeze (at current
levels or lower) all spending for non-free, closed
source, software. Establish a Legislative audit to
determine the Total Cost of Operation (TCO) costs
of non-free server and desktop software. Establish
a cost reduction plan that will result in the
elimination of spending on non-free software.
Collect all those monies, identified by the TCO
analysis, together into a revolving Software
Freedom Fund, to be administered by the Office
of Technology.  Require that all further purchases
and upgrades of non-free, closed source server and
desktop software must be approved by the Minnesota
Office of Technology's, Information Policy Council
(IPC).  The IPC will be charged to develop a
statewide model of the MPDN.  The IPC will be
charged to connect every public sector worker in
Minnesota to the MPDN.   Savings within the
Software Freedom Fund may be spent on writing free
software.  Revenues of the Software Freedom Fund
must be spent, to endow the creation of free software
and free content, all of which, must be licensed
under the GNU General Public License (GPL) or a
suitable copyleft license.
