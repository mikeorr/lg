<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>As the GTK GUI programming toolkit matures more developers have been
inspired to use it for the visual presentation of their programs.  Pascal
Rigaux, a French programmer, has come up with a small file-manager he calls
sfm.  Sfm isn't quite as simple as the name and initial appearance imply; it
has a remarkably full feature-set for such a small program.

<p>There has been a long succession of X Windows file-managers which use
various icons to represent different types of files.  This approach can be
useful for people accustomed to a Macintosh or Windows environment, where this
type of file-manager is common.  These icons do have drawbacks, though, as
fewer files will fit into a single display window which results in much more
scrolling to find a particular file.  The impact on system resources is
considerable as well, as the X server is called upon to constantly update the
display, and memory usage is much greater than what is needed by a text-based
manager.  In the end it's just a matter of preference.

<p>Sfm is unusual in that it is an X-only file-manager which is also
text-based (FileRunner is another).  It also goes against the general trend
towards mouse-based applications in that the keyboard interface is
well-developed.

<center><h3>Appearance and Features</h3></center>

<p>The default window size is rather small; my first impression was that this
was a trivial application, probably a first GTK programming exercise without
much utility.  As I explored further (and actually read the README file!) I
found that sfm's uncluttered appearance conceals an interesting and useful
approach to the perpetual effort to contrive a useful interface to the
<b>ls</b> utility.  In the screenshot below I've enlarged the default window
by about one-third:<br>

<p><img alt="sfm window" src="./gx/ayers/sfm1.gif">

<p>The above window is rather plain.  The interesting part is the
right-mouse-button menu which offers a plethora of actions which can be
performed upon the highlighted file, along with a submenu offering less-used
possibilities.  I wanted a screenshot showing the basic sfm window with both
menus fanned out from it.  I don't know whether it is an idiosyncrasy of sfm,
GTK, or xv (which I used for the screenshots), but while I was able to get
shots of either menu by itself, I couldn't get them all in one screenshot.  So 
here are the main menu and its submenu; try to imagine them connected to the
first screenshot above:<br>

<p><img alt="first sfm menu" src="./gx/ayers/sfm2.gif">

<p>This is the submenu stemming from the "more" item:

<p><img alt="sfm sub-menu" src="./gx/ayers/sfm3.gif">

<p>As you can see, the keyboard shortcuts for all of the various menu-items
are shown to the right of the action menu-entries.  This is a great help in
learning the key-bindings, which are designed to be intuitive and similar to
those of many other programs.  I especially like the Lynx-style left-and-right 
arrow-key directory navigation (the mc file-manager offers this as an option).

<p>Multiple sfm windows can be opened at once and files can be easily copied
or moved between them. 

<p>Sfm uses a configuration dot-file (<i>~/.sfm</i>) in order to determine the
action to take upon a highlighted file when either the enter key, the
right-arrow-key, or a single left-mouse-button click is received.
Surprisingly, this is one dot-file you won't have to edit, as it is
auto-generated.  The first time you select, as an example, a text file, a
dialog box pops up asking what action you'd like to take, such as editing it
with your favorite editor.  That preference is then recorded in the
<i>~/.sfm</i> file; the next time a text file is selected it will be loaded
into your editor.  Sfm uses the standard Linux <b>file</b> utility to
determine file-types.  This is quite a nice feature, especially for new Linux
users who have enough to do just becoming comfortable with the system without
constantly needing to chase down and edit config files.

<p>Sfm is still in its early days, but judging by the intelligent design of
the current version, it's likely that further improvements are in the offing.
The current version (1.4 as I write this) is available from the
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/utils/file/managers">Sunsite</a>
archive; an alternate site is
