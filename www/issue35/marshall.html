<P> <HR> <P>  


I recently used <a
href="http://www.powerquest.com/product/pm/index.html">Partition Magic
4.0</a>, and was quite impressed, although I did run into some interesting
glitches.  <p>

<center>Background:</center> <p>

My machine was (and still is) partitioned like this: <p>

<ul>
<li>  FAT32, containing Win95
<li>  Extended partition
<ul>  
<li>  swap partition for Win95
<li>  swap partition for Linux
<li>  <tt>/dev/hda7</tt> - <tt>/</tt>
<li>  <tt>/dev/hda8</tt> - <tt>/usr</tt>
<li>  <tt>/dev/hda9</tt> - <tt>/usr/src</tt>
<li>  <tt>/dev/hda10</tt> - <tt>/usr/local</tt>
<li>  <tt>/dev/hda11</tt> - <tt>/home</tt>
<li>  <tt>/dev/hda12</tt> - <tt>/wrk</tt>
</ul><p>

<li> I also had some unused space above <tt>/dev/hda12</tt>, that I had
previously been unable to utilize.  Not much; less then 100K.  <p>

</ul>

I very rarely run Win95.  I use Linux for everything I do at home.
Professionally, I am a software/knowledge engineer, using several different
flavors of UNIX every day -- exclusively unix.  <p>

<center>Documentation:</center> <p>

There was nothing in the <cite>PartitionMagic User Guide</cite> that was
of any use to me.  I opened it once, looking for references to either
Linux or ext2 -- nothing in the Table of Contents -- nothing in the Index!
I did find a few terse references, like "Ext2 is only used by Linux". <p>

While writing this, I decided to go through the <cite>PartitionMagic User
Guide</cite> page-by-page, and see what I could find.  Besides those few
references, I found in <cite>Chapter3: Completing Hard Disk
Operations</cite>, under <cite>Creating Partitions</cite> /
<cite>Scenarios</cite>, a section titled <cite>Creating Linux Logical
Partitions</cite>.  Although this might be of some limited use to a
neophyte, it might also lead them down a somewhat limiting path -- only a
swap, and one other Linux partition.  But, that's a judgment call, and
beyond the scope of this article.<p>

Pasted onto the cover of the <cite>PartitionMagic User Guide</cite>, was a
sticker that said: "UPGRADE - PREVIOUS INSTALLATION REQUIRED".  So, I
figured that PM would remove much of the old version, replacing it with
the new one.  I subsequently forgot about V3.0, until many hours later.
<p>

<center>Installation:</center>
<p>

I booted Win95, and started the PM4.0 installation.
<p>

The installation went smoothly enough.  Running it, however, yielded a few
surprises.  <p>

<center>Execution:</center>
<p>

First off, I was very pleasantly surprised, and very impressed by the new
GUI.  There are several ways to select a partition, and to manipulate it.
I particularly LOVE the way one can just move the whole partition (within
the available space) back an forth.  It was very intuitive.  I give
PowerQuest five stars (*****) for the GUI!<p>

With the GUI up, I merrily proceeded to make all of my desired
adjustments, asked PM to Analyze them, and was given the go-ahead to
implement them.  <p>

But, to my surprise, when all was said and done (including an auto-reboot,
and some complaints from my virus checker), only my Win95's C: partition
was altered.  :-( It was not very nice of PM, to tell me that everything
was OK, and then ONLY make ONE of my changes.  It was also fortunate that
I had decided to check the results with PM, before rebooting to Linux.  
&lt;heavy sigh&gt;  <p>

I proceeded to make all of the adjustments in the Extended partition.
Notice, that I said ALL adjustments.  That meant changing the sizes and
locations of every remaining partition.  I only realized after the next
(unexpected) reboot that I had again wasted more time -- that only Win95's
swap partition actually got adjusted. :-( <p>

This time, though, I just modified my Linux swap, and root partitions.
When it was done, no reboot.  &lt;a BIG smile, this time&gt;
<p>

I then adjusted all of the rest of my Linux partitions!  (Remember, this
was the third time I had done them.)  But, my tests of patience were not
over.  While it was chunking away, I got several 120? (I forget the last
digit, maybe 4) error popups.  This error is NOT in the User Guide.  So, I
prayed that it wasn't serious, and clicked on OK.  <p>

[Subsequently I have looked for that error on their web site.  So far, I
have not been able to find it.]<p>

About two thirds of the way through the implementation of my changes, all
activity on the status window stopped, right in the middle of processing
the <tt>/usr</tt> partition, where the bulk of Linux lives.  Rebooting at that point
would have been disastrous!  <p>

Hoping that this was not one of those frequent Win95 unrecoverable hangs,
I decided to go to the store -- I needed some groceries, anyway.  And, I
needed some fresh, cold, night air, in order to relax.  <p>

I returned about 45 minutes later, only to find the status window exactly
as I had left it.  &lt;What to do...  What to do...  Don't panic...  Don't
press that button...&gt;  <p>

I suddenly noticed that the "NUM LOCK" light was on, and since I never
leave it that way, I automatically pressed the Num Lock key to turn it
off.  And, to my surprise, and extreme pleasure, the status started to
change.  &lt;My neighbors might have heard THAT sigh of relief.&gt;
<p>

&lt;More of those 1204 errors.  Just press OK, and pray.&gt; <p>

Finally it completed!  It looked good.  Now I had room in <tt>/usr</tt> to
upgrade to RedHat 5.2.  So, I reboot to Linux.  <p>

<center>Rebooting to Linux:</center>
<p>

WHOOPS!  Linux didn't come up!  At the point where I should have seen a
"LILO boot:" prompt, I only saw "LI", and everything stopped.  Everything
except the fans, of course.  I tried another lilo diskette.  Same thing.
<p>

I tried the RedHat Boot Diskette (Release 5.1).  It said that it didn't
support the rescue operation, and that I needed the diskettes that I
created when I installed 5.1.  I was sure glad I had done so, even though
I had never had to use them before now.  <p>

After a brief search for those diskettes, I finally find them.  I tried
the "Boot image" disk first.  No good.  I tried the "Primary Boot Disk"
next, and cheers abounded!  Linux was now up (and maybe my neighbors,
too), although on a kernel with reduced functionality.  But I was then
able to rebuild my lilo diskette, and then reboot normally, everything
working as expected.  <p>

<center>Additional notes:</center> <p>

Remember my previous reference to "UPGRADE"?  Well, I examined the
<tt>/win</tt> partition from Linux, and I found that PM3.0 was still in
the "Start Menu", and that PM3.0 used up 4.92 Meg of disk space in
<tt>/win/pqmagic</tt>, i.e. it was still there.  So, the "upgrade" was
actually an "install".  And, now I have 4.92 Meg of space wasted on my C:
partition.  I hope I remember to remove 3.0, when I reboot back to Win95
in another month or six.  <p>

I also mounted the CD under Linux, and discovered that there is a
<tt>LINUX</tt> directory.  I wonder why I wasn't told about that before.
<p>

Examining it's contents, I discovered files named <tt>PQINST.SH</tt> and
<tt>PQREADME.NOW</tt>.  Reading them, I saw problems with both files.  <p>

<ul><li><p>

  In <tt>PQREADME.NOW</tt> it stated "Please remember linux is case
  sensitive."  And yet, it refers to items on the CD, using the wrong
  case.  Just a couple of examples (one from each file):
<p>

<pre>
    cp /pqtemp.ins/cdrom/linux/bootflpy.dat /dev/fd0
</pre> <p>

  should be<p>

<PRE>
    cp /pqtemp.ins/cdrom/LINUX/BOOTFLPY.DAT /dev/fd0
</PRE> <p>

  and<p>

<PRE>
    cp /pqtemp/linux/bootflpy.dat /dev/fd0
</PRE> <p>

  should be<p>

<PRE>
    cp /pqtemp/LINUX/BOOTFLPY.DAT /dev/fd0
</PRE> <p>

</ul>

I manually performed the <tt>cp</tt> commands (with the correct case).
I then booted from them, to see what would happen.  <p>

<center>Experience with the Linux boot diskettes:</center>
<p>

When I booted the "Boot Diskette", it turned out to be a form of DOS from
Caldera.  <p>

This experience was less then optimal.  Before the GUI came up, it
appeared to stop loading, and there was a sound coming out of my PC,
something like a horse running in the distance.  There was also a black
rectangle in the middle of my screen.  I suppose there was text in that
rectangle.  But, it too, must have been black.  <p>

I pressed &lt;return&gt;, and there was a very brief pause in the sound,
and the black rectangle flickered.  So I pressed it many times, and
eventually a slightly abbreviated form of the GUI appeared.  <p>

Although most of the GUI was there, the helpers at the bottom were not.  I
guess that made sense, since there was no mouse pointer either.  The lack
of a mouse, made it a bit cumbersome to use, i.e. usable, but not optimal
-- especially without the ability to have it analyze my proposed changes.
<p>

That strange sound, combined with the black rectangle, occurred several
other times, while I was trying various features.  Again, I pressed
&lt;return&gt; and prayed, until the black rectangle went away.  <p>

Since I had no idea what was happening when I just pressed &lt;return&gt;,
I elected to just quit, and boot back to Linux without implementing my
changes.  <p>

<center>Trial with Wine:</center>
<p>

<A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">Wine</A> is a Linux program, within which
we can run a lot of Win95 programs.  It is still under development, so
many programs do not yet work, or they function with aberrant behavior.  <p>

It took me a while to discover that PM's executable is: <p>

<pre>
    /win/Program Files/PowerQuest/PartitionMagic4/Win9X/Pm409x.exe
</pre><p>

When I tried it under Wine, it didn't run at all.  Quite literally, it
crashed with a segfault.  I suspect the problem is in Wine, or with
something very unusual that PM does..  <p>

<center>Conclusion:</center>
<p>

In spite of the problems I encountered, I still consider PartitionMagic4
an invaluable tool for the Linux community.  <p>

For the average "User", i.e. those who just use the system as a tool, and
don't want anything to do with changing its configuration; it seems to
me that they MIGHT have a need to use PartitionMagic just once, IF they
didn't allocate their partitions adequately to begin with.  But, after
that, they may never need it again.  So, for them, I can not in good
conscience, recommend the $69.95 (plus $6 shipping) expenditure.  Besides,
they might have much more difficulty getting rebooted back to Linux.
<p>

But, for the hundreds (or maybe even thousands) of us who actually get
into the system, move stuff around, and generally push the envelope of
Linux, $69.95 is not really that much to pay, for the ease with which
PartitionMagic allows one to adjust disk partition tables to meet changing
needs.
<p>

Since I had purchased version 3.0 almost two years ago, and therefore
was able to upgrade for only $29.95 (plus $6 shipping), it was much
easier to justify the expenditure.
<P>

One final note:  On the 8th of November (almost 3 weeks ago) I sent much
of what I've documented above, to Customer Service at PowerQuest,
imforming them that I was going to submit this to the Linux Gazette.  I
have yet to receive any reply.
