I enjoy very much being on the list; I learn a great many things, burst 
out laughing well more than often and sometimes have an opportunity to 
contribute to the best of my ability.

<h3>About The Answer Gang</h3>
<p>
The Answer Gang actually started as The Answer Guy - Jim Dennis did this
job all by himself starting with issue #13 (the lucky issue for the Linux
community, I suppose...) At a certain point, Jim found himself writing the
equivalent of the Encyclopedia Britannica once a month; even with the
Answer Gal (his wife, Heather Stern) putting her shoulder to the wheel, it
was still too much work. So, right around issue #55, Jim decided to share
some of the load - and thus, The Answer Gang was born.
</p>

<p>
(The serious flaw in their plan was revealed, however, when the colorful cast of
characters that they let in immediately put their feet up on the furniture,
drank all the beer, and went digging around in the refrigerator. Many of
us are still around - after all, the snacks and the beer still keep coming
- and the whole shebang keeps somehow rolling along.)

<h3>How Do I join The Answer Gang?</h3>

<p> Start by notifying the <a
href="mailto:editor@linuxgazette.net">Editor-in-Chief</a>; if you don't
already have an author's bio, you'll need to send one to the above email
address (see <a
href="../authors">http://linuxgazette.net/authors</a>
for examples.) These will be listed on the '<a href="../authors/bios.html">TAG Bios</a>' page, which is how
TAG members get credited for their participation.

To join the list itself, subscribe at

<h3>Guidelines For Answering Questions</h3>


<p> As a member, you will receive questions from the querents, and answers
and discussion from other TAG members.  Feel free to jump in with your own
answer at any time, or to add to an answer if you feel something is
incorrect or missing.

<p> Be warned that a certain (very small, these days) amount of spam comes
through.  We have a spamfilter, but it's set more lenient than most because we
don't want to take the chance that a desperate querent with a clueless ISP
might not be able to get a question through.  <em>Never reply to spam</em>. 
Replying just encourages them to send more since they know somebody's reading
it.  Do feel free to ridicule spammers on the list, though; the funniest
spams and responses are published on The Back Page.

<p> Web archives of TAG mail are at <a
href="http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/private/tag/">http://lists.linuxgazette.net/mailman/private/tag/</a>.
The archives are password protected for the sake of querents who wish to
remain anonymous (use your list-membership password.)

<p> <strong>Always</strong> check the To: and Cc: addresses when you reply.
Always reply to <strong>both</strong> the querent <strong>and</strong> <a
href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</a>.
It's easy to accidentally drop off one or the other.  Dropping off the
querent means they'll have to wait up to a month for their answer, IF it
gets published and IF they can find it among the three columns. Dropping
off TAG means it <em>won't</em> be published &mdash; we can't
publish what we don't receive.  It doesn't matter whether you put both
addresses in To: or put one in Cc:, just make sure you include both
somehow.
</p>

<p>It's OK to answer something that you don't know all that well, as long
as you mention the fact and have <i>some</i> good information. Your answer
will still be useful if you can tell the reader how to search for more
answers and give some juicy links where our readers can learn more about
the subject at hand.</p>

<p>Try to stick to answering Linux questions.  We don't bother to publish
non-Linux questions unless they are a lot of fun.  (After all, <em>LG</em>'s
goal <strong>is</strong> to make Linux a bit more fun.)</p>

<p>We're real people here, just answer conversationally, like you are right
there with them.</p>

<p> Remember, you're not just answering the querent, you're composing a message
that will help thousands of others.  So go ahead and throw in related
information that somebody in that situation would want to know, even if the
querent doesn't need it directly.

<p>It's perfectly fine to trim the original message down to only the
fragments which you have an answer for. Definitely snip off any HTML
attachment they might have accidentally provided.  But it is okay and
even desirable to leave the "&gt;" quoting marks intact.</p>

<p>
<a NAME="markup"></a>
<h2>The TAG E-mail Markup Language</h2>

<p>When the TAG output is processed for publication, we auto-convert some
very basic markup - actually, it would be highly appreciated if everyone
would use it, since it will save us hand-hacking a large file at the end of
the month! Most of it is just common email markup, anyway.
</p>

<ul>
<li> Put a blank line between each paragraph.
<li>Anything that just needs to be left formatted, without frames or
color changes should be preceded by <em>two</em> backticks on a line, and followed
by <em>two</em> single-quotes on a line:<br>
<pre>
``
ben@Fenrir:/tmp/ben-k1rnn8$ ls -al
total 12
drwx--S---  2 ben  root 4096 2006-10-29 13:47 .
drwxrwsrwx 14 root root 8192 2006-10-30 11:43 ..
srw-------  1 ben  root    0 2006-10-29 13:47 bookmarks.dpi
srw-------  1 ben  root    0 2006-10-29 13:47 downloads.dpi
srw-------  1 ben  root    0 2006-10-29 13:47 dpid.srs
''
</pre>
<li> Delimit program listings, scripts, anything that needs to STAND OUT and
be left formatted as is by preceding them with <em>three</em> backticks and
following them with <em>three</em> single quotes:<br>
<pre>
```
#!/bin/bash

echo 'Hello, World!'
'''
</pre>
<li>Any word enclosed in *asterisks* will be converted to <strong>bold</strong>.
<li>Any word enclosed in _underscores_ will be converted to <em>italic</em>.
<li>Valid .sigs (i.e., those preceded by a line consisting of exactly
two dashes and a single space) will have their formatting preserved.
<li>Any fully-formed HTTP URLs (e.g., "http://mydomain.com/foo/bar") will
be made hot (LG URLs will be made relative.)
<li>Smilies and frownies - i.e., ':)', ':-)', ':-&gt;', :(, :-(, :-&lt;,
etc. - will be made into images with the original preserved as the image's
'alt' text.

</ul>

</p>

<a NAME="private"></a>
<h2>&quot;What Do You Mean, This Is A List? I Want A Private Answer!&quot;</h2>

<p> If a querent writes in and has a "private message" block in their
email, don't bother answering it - we can't publish it as it stands, and
your answer will not help anyone besides the querent. If you wish, you can
reply by directing them to "Asking Questions of The Answer Gang" at <a
href="../faq/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/faq/ask-the-gang.html</a>,
which deals with that problem - or you can tell them to remove that block
or cancel it explicitly.
</p>

<p>
If a querent writes to you and demands &quot;private service&quot;
- as some will - respond to them and Cc:
<a href="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net">tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</a>.
You can say that we are volunteers who answer Linux questions so that a
large number of people can benefit from the answers.  We will withhold
their name and/or e-mail address if they request anonymity, but we will not
help them if they refuse to allow us to publish the text of their message.
Allowing us to publish the thread is our "payment" for giving them
advice.
</p>

<p>If they want a private consultant, several of the folks on the list
qualify and will happily take their money. They can also try LinuxPorts'
Consultant Guide (<a href=" http://www.linuxports.com/guide/consultants/"
>http://www.linuxports.com/guide/consultants/</a>), the Linux Documentation
Project's Consultants Guide (<a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lcg/html/"
>http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lcg/html/</a>), or possibly seek paid technical
support from the commercial Linux vendors related to their software. Red
Hat, Linuxcare, and many others offer business-level professional services,
as well.</p>

<p> If they complain that they didn't know it was going to be published,
you can tell them we have made every effort to make this clear in "Asking
Questions of The Answer Gang" and in the replies themselves, and if they
didn't read this or got our address from somebody that didn't tell them our
policy, we're not responsible for that. Tell them we are very interested in
knowing how they heard about the Gazette, so that we can follow up with the
person or webmaster who gave them an erroneous impression of what the TAG
address is for.
