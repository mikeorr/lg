Nowadays the IDE devices already have a high transfer rate (by UltraDMA technology), but there are still other ways to improve your hard-disks performance and we'll show how to do it with the hdparm utility.  
</font>
</center>

<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

    hdparm is an utility which provides us a powerful tunning control over 
  HDs (HD PARaMeters) and this is what we'll be discussing in this document.
    Sometimes your HD is set not to use its maximum power as it could and that's
  why you may get anoyed with its performance. With hdparm we can magically 
  change this to reach its maximum performance using all of its features.

 
<h1>2. Looking the hard disk</h1>

<p>The first thing to do, is to gather all information about your hard drive
  and the current settings. These information will be used as a base for us 
  while configuring the hard disks. Be extremely careful in all the steps you
  take because any misconfiguration may damage your disk partially (data) or
  entirely (hardware).
<p>By now, lets assume /dev/hda as our disk. Take the command:
<pre>
      darkstar:~$ hdparm -i /dev/hda
</pre>   
<p>You should get some info like:
<pre>
    /dev/hda:

    Model=QUANTUM FIREBALLlct20 20, FwRev=APL.0900, SerialNo=552114732078
    Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs } 
    RawCHS=16383/16/63, TrkSize=32256, SectSize=21298, ECCbytes=4 
    BuffType=DualPortCache, BuffSize=418kB, MaxMultSect=8, MultSect=off
    CurCHS=16383/16/63, CurSects=-66060037, LBA=yes, LBAsects=39876480
    IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, tDMA={min:120,rec:120} 
    PIO modes: pio0 pio1 pio2 pio3 pio4 
    DMA modes: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 *udma5 
    AdvancedPM=no 
    Drive Supports : ATA/ATAPI-5 T13 1321D revision 1 : ATA-1 ATA-2 ATA-3
    ATA-4 ATA-5
</pre> 
<p>But, you may ask yourself "What the hell is this?". Heah, don't be afraid
  this information will make you happy soon. Here we have many important and
  useful information...let's look at some:
<ul>
   <li>MaxMultSect: This field tell us what is the maximum number of sectors
  your hard disk can read at a time.
   <lI>MultSect: This one says the current number of sectors being read at a 
  time.
   <lI>PIO and DMA modes: These are the modes supported by your hard drive. The
  one marked with an asterisk (*) is the currently set.
   <li>AdvancedPM: If 'yes', means that your drive supports APM (Advanced Power
  Management).
</ul>
<p>Another command issued to get other information is:
<pre>
      darkstar:~$ hdparm /dev/hda
</pre>
<p>This one brings:
<pre>
    /dev/hda: 
     multcount = 0 (on) 
     I/O support = 0 (16-bit) 
     unmaskirq = 0 (off) 
     using_dma = 0 (off) 
     keepsettings = 0 (off) 
     nowerr = 0 (off) 
     readonly = 0 (off) 
     readahead = 8 (on) 
     geometry = 2482/255/63, sectors = 39876480, start = 0
</pre>
<p>In a brief description...
<ul>
    <li>multcount is the number of sectors being read at a time;
    <li>I/O support indicates the operating mode of your hard disk (16/32/32sync);
    <li>using_dma tell us whether the drive is using the DMA feature or not;
    <li>keepsettings keeps the settings after a soft reset (don't touch unless you
  know what it is);
    <li>readonly is normally set to 1 only for CD-ROMs, this setting tells the system
  whether the device is read-only or not;
    <li>readahead shows how many sectors ahead will be read when you access the 
  hard drive; 
</ul> 
<p>If you didn't understand some of these don't get bored, you are not a dumb,
  and we will discuss them as you read this document. Some of these parameters
  are related to your hard drive hardware physically and not logically, soh you
  cannot change them unless you change the hardware (and if you do it, you will
  probably cry for damaging your hard disk and destroy all your data, =] ).

  
<h1>3. Device setup</h1>

<p>And now...the show! We are going to setup our HD. REMEMBER: Mistakes during
  the setup process may damage your hard disk and all of its data. The 
  information provided by 'hdparm -i <device>' now, is your driver. Follow them 
  and you must not get any problems.

<h2>3.1. I/O Support</h2>
  
<p>Well, unless you have a (E)ISA IDE interface card, the rest (PCI/VLB), all
    support 32bits mode. If your box is newer than a 486, probably you have a 
    PCI IDE controller. If it's not, check for it...
<ul>
      <li>hdparm -c0 <device> // Set operating mode to 16-bits.
      <li>hdparm -c1 <device> // Set operating mode to 32-bits.
      <li>hdparm -c3 <device> // Set operating mode to 32-bits synchronized.
</ul>
<p>The mode '3' only is needed for some chipsets. People often use mode '1' 
    for best performance. We didn't find any info about mode '2' (supposed to be
    16-bit sychronized).
    
<h2>3.2. MultSect or Multcount</h2>

<p>This one is simple. Check your HD's MaxMultSect info for what you can do.
    We set our MultSect to 8 since our HD supports that, so...
<pre>
	# hdparm -m 8 /dev/hda
</pre>
<p>Remember to change /dev/hda to YOUR device and '8' to the MaxMultSect 
    supported by your hard disk as provided by 'hdparm -i <device>'.

<h2>3.3 Activating DMA</h2>

<p>The most simple of all. Simply type:
<pre>      
	# hdparm -d 1 <device>
</pre>
<p>to set your DMA mode to ON. Your card must supportd the DMA mode.

<h2>3.4 PIO and DMA modes</h2>

<p>You can set both of these using the same flag '-X'. This one, if not used
    with EXTREME care may eject your hard drive (BELIEVE IT!) and make it the 
    first HD to arrive the Moon by itself. Set just the modes supported by 
    your hard disk.
<p>Hmm, it works like this...for normal DMA modes (multiword DMA or mdma), 
    use -X32 + (DMA identifier number). For mdma2 it would be:
<pre>      
	# hdparm -X34 /dev/hda  // 32 + 2 (from mdma2)
</pre>       
<p>For the PIO and UltraDMA modes the process is almost the same. The 
    difference is that the base number for the PIO modes is 8 and for the 
    UltraDMA modes it is 64. The hard disk used while writing this document 
    supports ATA100, so it was put in udma5 mode using:
<pre>      
	# hdparm -X69 /dev/hda
</pre>      
<p>Keep in mind that the highest DMA modes are available just for some 
    chipsets.
<p>The ATA66 and ATA100 modes requires a 80-way IDE cable. Think that put you
    disk in ATA100 without these cables will not work.
    
<h2>3.5 Readahead</h2>
    
<p>The option readahead IS NOT the same as multcount. The multcount refers to
    the possibility of the hardware to read more than one sector at a time while
    the readahead option is the number of sectors ahead your computer should 
    read. The readahead feature is great when reading big-size files but it 
    brings down the performance for short-size files. A good idea is to leave 
    the value of readahead the same as the multcount so it will not be needed to
    make more than an access per time to read more sectors ahead.
    
<p>If you are going to access big files you can set the readahead to a 
    greater value. The default value is 8 sectors/read access (something like 
     4kb).
<p>Now the syntax:
<pre>      
	# hdparm -a N /dev/hda 
</pre>      
<p>N is the number of sectors for readahead.
      
      
<h1>4. Final comments</h1>
    
<p>There are many other features you can set using hdparm. Most of them are 
    covered in the hdparm manpage. These ones we covered are just the most 
    common.
<p>The configuration will be reset when you reboot your machine (the keep 
    settings will not work as it covers just soft reboots). Put the commands in 
    your rc.local (maybe, for large configuration, it would be a good idead to 
    have a rc.hdparm or something like this).
