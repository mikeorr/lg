<h1>FreeBSD - An Intro for Linux Devotees</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>


<h3>Disclaimers</h3>

<p>
Let's get the disclaimers out of the way quickly.
</p>

<p>
These are my impressions. I do not have a special pipeline to FreeBSD
gurus.
</p>

<p>
I started using FreeBSD in January 2010, a bit more than a year ago. I
was not a total stranger to FreeBSD, having done a little on it a few
years earlier. But I have not used FreeBSD anywhere near as long as
I've used Linux.
</p>


<h3>A Little History (Very Little)</h3>

<p>
There are 3 main BSDs and a handful of minor variations. The main ones
are FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD. I can't tell you how they differ.
Possibly, they are the analogues of Red Hat, Debian and SUSE. Of the
3, FreeBSD has the lion's share of users.
</p>

<p>
NetBSD and FreeBSD began with the same initial code base around 1993.
OpenBSD is a later fork from NetBSD. To varying degrees, code from
FreeBSD's precursor is used in Microsoft Windows, Darwin (Mac OS X),
Solaris.
</p>


<h3>Look and Feel</h3>

<p>
What does it feel like to use FreeBSD on a daily basis? The short
answer is that it's a lot like Linux. Or any other Unix, for that
matter.
</p>

<p>
Readers of Linux Gazette may be aware of my HAL (Henry Abstraction
Layer); that I use HAL to hide the differences between different
platforms. But, in fact, I needed to make very few changes to my HAL
to adapt to FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
Linux users might notice that some of the standard commands don't have
exactly the same options. FreeBSD ls is not GNU ls. For instance, they
have conflicting interpretations of the "-T" option. In FreeBSD, "-T"
produces complete time information, but not as detailed as
"--full-time".
</p>

<p>
However, FreeBSD includes GNU ls as gls (/usr/local/bin/gls).
</p>

<p>
Further, if you really want something Linux, FreeBSD includes Linux
binary compatibility which "allows FreeBSD users to run about 90% of
all Linux applications without modification"
(http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/linuxemu.html).
</p>

<p>
So on top of gls, you can also get /usr/compat/linux/bin/ls. (That's 3
versions of ls for the price of 1!)
</p>

<p>
What's the difference?
</p>

<pre>
$ /usr/compat/linux/bin/ls --version
ls (GNU coreutils) 6.12
Copyright (C) 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
...

$ gls --version
ls (GNU coreutils) 7.5
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
...
</pre>

<p>
That's probably more than you ever wanted to know about ls (or any
other command).
</p>

<p>
As a last resort, if you have a Linux program, you can try to run it
under FreeBSD. There's a good chance that it will just work. And it's
not an emulation. It runs at pretty much native speed.
</p>


<h3>Differences I've noticed</h3>

<p>
FreeBSD comes without bash. But, in fairness, on FreeBSD /bin/sh is
vastly more than Bourne shell. But it's not bash.
</p>

<p>
Standard stuff that comes with FreeBSD can be found in /bin and
/usr/bin. Alien software usually goes into /usr/local/bin. You can
install bash and it will wind up in /usr/local/bin. Most of my scripts
are Bourne shell; their first line consists of:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #! /bin/sh
</pre>

<p>
However, I do have a few bash scripts; these tend to have a first
line:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #! /bin/bash
</pre>

<p>
I guess I could have found another solution, but it seemed simplest to
make /bin/bash a symlink to /usr/local/bin. Some people might raise
their eyebrows at this, but my system, my rules.
</p>

<p>
su is a bit different. FreeBSD has truss (similar to Solaris) rather
than strace.
</p>


<h3>The Good</h3>

<p>
The sheer number of packages. FreeBSD has an astonishing number of
packages. Looking at my system, I estimate over 22,000 (available
packages - I haven't installed them all!). This number probably
overestimates because some of these are to do with different languages
(arabic, chinese, french, german, hebrew, hungarian, japanese, polish,
portuguese, russian, ukrainian, vietnamese). But even without the
languages, there were more than 21,800 packages.
</p>

<p>
I may not be interested in any of these languages since I am most
comfortable in English. But I suspect that there are a lot of people
in the world who would be quite grateful to be able to use their
native tongue. This sort of thing only becomes an issue when one's
preferred language is omitted.
</p>

<p>
There is heaps of documentation (are heaps?). And the documentation is
pretty good.
</p>

<p>
I like the idea that there is a Master of the FreeBSD Universe.
Consequently, no one can change a standard or the framework. But,
individually, a user can still make any conceivable modification -
because, ultimately, you are encouraged to build anything and
everything for yourself.
</p>

<p>
The result is that you never get dynamic library conflicts. (I did
once - it's a long story and an unusual scenario).
</p>

<p>
There is an overwhelming sense of quality, an expectation that things
will just work. Whenever something didn't work for me, I assumed that
it was simply a matter of my ignorance. Although this is usually a
safe bet, it nonetheless speaks volumes about the quality of FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
There are some exceptions at the margins.
</p>


<h3>The Bad</h3>

<p>
Here is something I noticed on the Internet:
</p>

<pre>
        "... being a long time Linux person, I'm sad to say that
        FreeBSD ports/packages is really confusing to me."
</pre>

<p>
I agree. I finally have a handle on packages. I'm still confused about
ports. I'd like some tutorials or HowTos on how one is meant to manage
ports. There is a plethora of similarly named tools. Which one(s)
should I use? What's best practice?
</p>

<p>
At its simplest, packages are, or more specifically, pkg_add is, a lot
like an inferior yum. It's like "yum install" without "yum list": it
takes care of the installation, but it's an act of faith as to how
much will be downloaded. Until recently, this was an ISP issue for me.
It's still an issue for another reason. If I install openoffice
blindly, I might end up filling a disk. "yum list" gives me some idea
of what's involved *before* I commit.
</p>

<p>
There's another annoyance. Let's say you want to run Firefox. Of
course you do. No problems. You can't go to the Firefox website and
simply download the latest Firefox. The choices there are "Windows, Mac
OS X, Linux" in many languages. Instead, you download it as a package.
It's a big download, but, like yum, pkg_add takes care of
dependencies.
</p>

<p>
Good, your happy. Your Firefox works like a bought one, straight out
of the box. Until you go to, say, YouTube. Or any site that needs
extensions. Let me be a little more precise: until you need some sort
of plugin that executes proprietary binary code. Who makes Flash?
Adobe. Is the source freely available? No, sir. Clearly a solution is
needed. The solution is rather convoluted:
</p>

<p>
(From http://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/desktop-browsers.html)
</p>


<pre>
6.2.3 Firefox and Macromedia&reg; Flash Plugin

Macromedia&reg; Flash plugin is not available for FreeBSD. However, a
software layer (wrapper) for running the Linux version of the plugin
exists. This wrapper also supports Adobe&reg; Acrobat&reg; plugin,
RealPlayer&reg; plugin and more.
</pre>

<p>
Now before you start laughing, let me say that I encountered a similar
problem when I ran a 64-bit version of Firefox on CentOS at work (on a
64-bit machine). The Firefox works, but I couldn't get any plugins to
work because there was no 64-bit Flash plugin. I don't understand why
it couldn't run a 32-bit plugin, but there it is.
</p>

<p>
At least I have been able to get Flash working under FreeBSD. I can
see video and hear audio. It was a complicated install, but now it's
done.
</p>


<h3>The Indifferent</h3>

<p>
Don't expect FreeBSD to be like Microsoft Windows or even Ubuntu. You
are expected to know what you are doing. If you don't, you can ask for
help. But you will not be mollycoddled the way Microsoft or Apple do
it. Personally, this is how I prefer it. I like my platforms a little
user-antagonistic.
</p>

<p>
By default, FreeBSD uses ufs which is not at all like ext2 or ext3.
And it talks of slices rather than partitions. So to install FreeBSD,
you use something (eg fdisk) to partition the disk. Whichever
partition you allocate to FreeBSD, it will slice up that partition
into several bits. So, for example, I allocated partition 3 of the
second drive (/dev/ad1s3) to FreeBSD:
</p>

<pre>
    Device Boot    Start       End    Blocks   Id  System
/dev/ad1s3   *     10608     25846   7680456   a5  FreeBSD
</pre>

<p>
(I've omitted the other partitions).
</p> 

<p>
Here's the relevant bits of a df:
</p>

<pre>
Filesystem                         Size     Used    Avail Capacity Mounted
/dev/ad1s3a                        372M     268M      74M  78% /
/dev/ad1s3e                        310M     117M     168M  41% /tmp
/dev/ad1s3f                        4.9G     3.5G     1.0G  78% /usr
/dev/ad1s3d                        558M      51M     462M  10% /var
</pre>

<p>
FreeBSD uses the term "slice". It has taken the partition I gave it
(/dev/ad1s3) and sliced it up (/dev/ad1s3a, /dev/ad1s3b, etc).
</p>

<p>
But the good news is that FreeBSD understands ext2. So, when I ran out
of room in my FreeBSD partition, I simply mounted some Linux
partitions. Further, FreeBSD not only understands NFS, I think it
wrote the original book on it. So I am able to run both my Linux
machine and my FreeBSD machine and mount drives from either on the
other and just be on whichever machine without being too conscious of
any differences.
</p>

<p>
I don't know the relative merits of ufs and ext2. It also looks like
FreeBSD understands all of ext2/ext3/ext4. I wonder why I'm using ext2
and not ext3.
</p>


<h3>Why did I choose FreeBSD?</h3>

<p>
Good question. Difficult question.
</p>

<p>
I was trying to solve a problem. Maybe several problems.
</p>

<p>
My first problem is that I run an idiosyncratic environment. Why?
</p>

<p>
Imagine you have a car. I guess that's not a difficult exercise for
most people. Let's accept, for the purposes of this exercise, that you
are not a rev-head. You are not particularly interested in cars per
se. You're a lot like my wife: you want to get into your car and drive
to your destination. The only choice you want is the colour of the
Duco.
</p>

<p>
So, after a while it's time to replace your car. But the latest model
cars don't have the same controls as your previous car had. Steering
wheel? No, we don't have one of them any more. We've got this new
gadget. You sit on it; and when you want to steer, you sort of wriggle
around. Sounds odd, but you'll soon get used to it. It's not actually
better than a steering wheel, but it's the latest must-have. Everybody
wants one. They were all getting bored with steering wheels. Brakes?
Yes, we have a new way of stopping. We stick a gizmo in your ear and
...
</p>

<p>
That's what new releases of distros feel like to me. I went to
"upgrade" from Fedora 5 to 10. I had had no problems going from 2 to
5. But 10 was another matter altogether. Just out of the blue, the
names of disks changed. My Fedora 5 (which I'm still running)  refers
to /dev/hda. Fedora 10 decided to call it /dev/sda. Perhaps I'm naive,
but I don't expect gratuitous changes like that from FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
Every new rev of emacs introduces incompatible changes.
</p>

<p>
I don't turn on a computer so that I can learn new tricks. Not those
sorts of new tricks. One of my computers has to be bread and butter,
unchanging from day to day. I don't want to spend my time learning
somebody's idea of a better editor. It's an editor! I just want the
one I was using yesterday. Not better, not worse, not different. I DO
NOT NOT NOT WANT ANY NEW FEATURES. If you want to do that, here's an
idea: deliver emacs-classic and new-emacs. Put all your changes into
new-emacs and leave emacs-classic as it is. Coke, anyone?
</p>

<p>
Every time they make it better, they make it worse. And that goes for
Solitaire and aspell and ... the list goes on.
</p>

<p>
And these gratuitous changes come at a price. I used to run Slackware
on a 16MB 100 Mhz Pentium 1. I was trying to install Fedora 10 on a
spare machine and getting intermittent problems. After a while, they
went away. It wasn't till much later that I twigged. I happened to
notice in some documentation a declaration that Fedora would no longer
run in 256MB; it needed a minimum of 512MB. While fiddling with my
machine, I'd added some extra memory from another (dead) machine.
</p>

<p>
I decided I didn't like the notion of releases. Especially since
Fedora is committed to producing a new release every year. That
wouldn't be a disaster if there were any respect for backward
compatibility. But there's not. There's the tacit assumption that the
newest and latest will necessarily be the best. For everyone.
</p>

<p>
I asked around. Gentoo and Arch Linux were suggested as solutions to
my problems. I was given to understand that they are more into the
idea of just allowing the system to update organically. If you need a
latter version of application X, just go get it. They had gone away
from the idea of discrete releases. Sure, if you wanted to switch
sects, you'd get the latest release. But you would not be penalised
for running an old release. Maybe I misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
I tried Arch but found it difficult to get information. The idea is
possibly ok, but I really felt isolated.
</p>

<p>
LG readers may be aware of my History files, records of what I do on
the machines I administer. Here's a note from the day I installed
FreeBSD:
</p>

<pre>
	The documentation is excellent, by the way.
</pre>

<p>
And that probably says it all. I dare say I encountered the same
problems with FreeBSD that I did with Arch. But, with FreeBSD I was
able to get answers.
</p>

<p>
I hope to find the source of a really old rev of emacs and build it.
And keep it forever. Because rolling your own is encouraged with
FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
That's not to say I've abandoned Linux altogether. Recently I had
power-supply problems with this machine. After I had replaced the
power supply, the machine wouldn't boot. I tried running live FreeBSD
off a CD, but could not get an environment which would allow me to
examine the disks.
</p>

<p>
I booted a live Fedora and soon had things under control.
</p>

<p>
I've got KVM/QEMU working under FreeBSD. My next step might be to take
my Fedora 5 machine and virtualise it. I've already got a virtual XP
(which I've not returned to after proving I could do it), an Arch, a
later rev of FreeBSD. And the first Linux I ever ran, a Slackware from
1995.
</p>


<h3>Some Random Observations</h3>

<p>
FreeBSD is comfortable with ext2/ext3/ext4 but my Fedora 10 was not
as comfortable with ufs. When everything is running fine, these things
may be much of a muchness. When it comes to recovery, be careful what
you wish for. I could get access to some of my ufs slices from Fedora
10 - well, actually, only 1 - but not the rest. It's not normally a
consideration, but perhaps it ought to be.
</p>

<p>
A similar argument could, perhaps, be applied to other less common or
more refined file systems: Reiser, xfs, zfs, LVM. In fact, some time
back, I had similar problems with LVM.
</p>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
No platform is perfect. The best that I can hope for is a platform
which is a reasonably good fit, particularly in the style in which it
operates. I had come to the conclusion that Fedora was getting too
concerned with look and feel and had consigned functionality to the
status of second-class citizen.
</p>

<p>
I think FreeBSD provides me with a comfortable environment for
keyboard, video, mouse and audio. For anything else, there are virtual
machines.
