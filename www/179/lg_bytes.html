<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Supports Java, Solaris but not Developer Community Control</h3>

<p>Technology Titan Oracle just held its Oracle Open World 
mulit-user-group conference and released roadmaps and announcements 
impacting several projects in the Open Source sphere.</p>

<p>These updates include new releases for MySQL, Solaris, and Oracle 
Linux, new Oracle engineered servers and appliances, as well the next 
generation of the SPARC processor architecture with its partner 
Fujitsu.  However, the future relationship between Oracle and 
developer institutions like the Java Community Process and OpenSolaris 
user groups were left uncertain and with hints of an adversarial turn.</p>

<p>Oracle seems to be backing away from OpenSolaris as a developer or 
small shop operating system by no longer sharing development source 
code with OpenSolaris distros.  A panel of Oracle executives, speaking 
to the press, declined to discuss OpenSolaris but did state that new 
Solaris source code would eventually become open-sourced under the 
CDDL.</p>

<p>Oracle is altering Sun's prior relationship with the Open Source 
community while making its Solaris offerings more commercial and more 
like its Linux offerings, which are based on customer support 
contracts.</p>

<p>Back in August, an internal management memo to Solaris engineers was 
leaked to the OpenSolaris email distribution.  While stressing 
Oracle's commitment to make Solaris "...a best-of-breed technology for 
Oracle's enterprise customers" and decision to hire the "top operating 
systems engineers in the industry," the memo described how Oracle 
would no longer share source code and builds on a regular basis, 
except with key partners. Instead, source code would be made available 
only after new version releases of Solaris:</p>

<p>"We will distribute updates to approved CDDL or other open source- 
licensed code following full releases of our enterprise Solaris 
operating system. In this manner, new technology innovations will show 
up in our releases before anywhere else. We will no longer distribute 
source code for the entirety of the Solaris operating system in 
real-time while it is developed, on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>"Anyone who is consuming Solaris code using the CDDL, whether in 
pieces or as a part of the OpenSolaris source distribution or a 
derivative thereof, would therefore be able to consume any updates we 
release at that time, under the terms of the CDDL, LGPL, or whatever 
license applies.</p>

<p>"We will have a technology partner program to permit our industry 
partners full access to the in-development Solaris source code through 
the Oracle Technology Network (OTN). This will include both early 
access to code and binaries, as well as contributions to us where that 
is appropriate."</p>

<p>For the complete memo, visit:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Outlines Core SPARC, Solaris and ZFS Innovations</h3>

<p>During his keynote presentation at Oracle OpenWorld 2010, Oracle 
Executive Vice President John Fowler showcased technology innovations 
and outlined the value of hardware and software engineered to work 
together as in Oracle's high-end ExaData servers.</p>

<p>Reiterating Oracle's commitment to SPARC, Fowler introduced the 
industry's first 16-core processor, the SPARC T3, and SPARC T3 
systems, which deliver optimized system performance for 
mission-critical applications. He unveiled eight world-record 
benchmark results, running the new SPARC T3 server family.</p>

<p>Fowler also unveiled the next-generation Sun ZFS Storage Appliance 
product line that provides unified storage solutions for deploying 
Oracle Database and data protection for Oracle Applications.</p>

<p>"We are focused on providing co-engineered systems - Oracle hardware 
and software engineered to work together - to continually drive better 
performance, availability, security and management, which translates 
into business value for our customers," said Fowler.
</p>

 

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Outlines Next Major Release of Oracle Solaris</h3>

<p>Besides increasing its investment in the Oracle Solaris operating 
system, Oracle is preparing for Oracle Solaris 11 in 2011 by releasing 
Solaris 11 Express in 2010 to provide customers with access to the 
latest Solaris 11 technology.</p>

<p>Oracle Solaris 11 will contain more than 2,700 projects with more than 
400 inventions. Oracle Solaris 11 is expected to reduce planned 
downtime by being faster and easier to deploy, update and manage, and:</p>

<p>- Nearly eliminate patching and update errors with new 
dependency-aware packaging tools;<br />

- Build a custom stack of Solaris and Oracle Software in a physical or 
virtual image to enforce enterprise quality and policy standards;<br />

- Reduce maintenance windows by eliminating the need for up to 50 
percent of system restarts;<br />

- Recover systems in tens of seconds versus tens of minutes with Fast 
Reboot;<br />

- Receive proactive and preemptive support that reduces service 
outages from known issues via My Oracle Support telemetry integration 
with the Oracle Solaris fault management architecture.</p>

<p>Oracle Solaris 11 is being engineered with new capabilities for 
building, deploying and maintaining Cloud systems. Oracle Solaris 11 
will be optimized for the scale and performance requirements of 
immediate and future Cloud-based deployments, and will scale to tens 
of thousands of hardware threads, hundreds of terabytes of system 
memory, and hundreds of Gigabits of I/O.</p>

<p>The first Oracle Solaris 11 Express release, expected by the end of 
calendar year 2010, will have an optional Oracle support agreement. 
This release is expected to be the path forward for developers, 
end-users and partners using previous generations of Solaris and 
OpenSolaris releases.</p>

<p>Over 1,000 SPARC and x86 systems from other hardware providers have 
been tested and certified by Oracle. Solaris 11 also will be powering 
the newly announced Oracle Exadata X2-2 and X2-8 Database Machines, as 
well as the Oracle Exalogic Elastic Cloud machine.</p>

 

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Outlines Plans for Java Platform</h3>

<p>During the opening keynote of JavaOne 2010, Thomas Kurian, executive 
vice president, Oracle Product Development outlined plans for the 
future of the Java platform and showcased product demonstrations 
illustrating the latest Java technology innovations.  Kurian's 
presentation covered four key areas of Java technology:</p>

<p>- Java Standard Edition (Java SE) - optimizing it for new application 
models and hardware; including extended support for running new 
scripting languages, increased developer productivity and lower 
operational costs. Kurian discussed the roadmap for JDK 7 and JDK 8, 
which will be based on OpenJDK, and highlighted some of the key 
OpenJDK projects.</p>

<p>- Java on the Client - Oracle is enhancing the programming model with 
JavaFX, to deliver advanced graphics, high-fidelity media and new HTML 
5, JavaScript and CSS Web capabilities, along with native Java 
platform support.</p>

<p>- Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) - Java EE will become more modular 
and programming more efficient with improvements such as dependency 
injection and reduced configuration requirements. Product 
demonstration highlighted how the Java EE 6 Web Profile reduces the 
size of the Java runtime for light-weight web applications, reducing 
overhead and improving performance.</p>

<p>- Java on Devices - Oracle will modernize the Java mobile platform by 
delivering Java with Web support to consumer devices. Oracle is also 
including new language features, small-footprint CPU-efficient 
capabilities for cards, phones and TVs, and consistent emulation 
across hardware platforms.</p>

<p>While 1.1 billion desktops run Java, 3 billion mobile phones run Java, 
and 1.4 billion Java Cards are manufactured each year.  This is a very 
big market that impacts computing at every level.</p>

<p>"Oracle believes that the Java community expects results. With our 
increased investment in the Java platform, a sharp focus on features 
that deliver value to the community, and a relentless focus on 
performance, the Java language and platform have a bright future," 
said Kurian. "In addition, Oracle remains committed to OpenJDK as the 
the best open source Java implementation and we will continue to 
improve OpenJDK and welcome external contributors."</p>

<p>However, in its presentations, Oracle said very little about the 
well-established Java Community Process (JCP) that has directed the 
evolution of Java.  Although many developers were concerned about this 
apparent diminishment of the JCP, most seemed pleased with the strong 
on-going commitment for Java by Oracle and its support of OpenJDK.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Android Poised to Overtake Blackberry, iPhone Market Share</h3>

<p>The rapid growth of mobile devices running Google's Android operating 
system will continue at the expense of the other leading smartphone 
platforms,  BlackBerry, iPhone, and even Windows Mobile, according to 
market share data compiled by the comScore marketing service.</p>

<p>For the quarter ending in July, comScore found that Android-based 
devices improved their share of the overall smartphone market, growing 
to 17 percent from 12 percent.  comScore researchers found that 
Microsoft lost 2.2 percent of total smartphone market share while RIM 
tumbled 1.8 percent and Apple, despite launching the vaunted iPhone 4 
in June, shed 1.3 percent.</p>

<p>RIM was the leading mobile smartphone platform in the U.S. with 39.3 
percent share of U.S. smartphone subscribers, followed by Apple with 
23.8 percent share. Google saw significant growth during the period, 
rising 5.0 percentage points to capture 17.0 percent of smartphone 
subscribers. Microsoft accounted for 11.8 percent of Smartphone 
subscribers, while Palm rounded out the top five with 4.9 percent</p>

<p>The July report found Samsung to be the top handset manufacturer 
overall with 23.1 percent market share, while RIM led among smartphone 
platforms with 39.9 percent market share.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">DeviceVM Adds MeeGo to Splashtop Instant-on Product</h3>

<p>DeviceVM, a provider of instant-on computing software, previewed the 
next-generation of its Splashtop instant-on platform at the Intel 
Developer's Forum in San Francisco. The flagship Splashtop product has 
already shipped on millions of notebooks and netbooks worldwide from 
leading PC OEMs including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, LG, Sony and 
others. The company will offer a MeeGo-compliant version of the 
popular companion OS to all existing OEM customers, while enabling 
current users of Splashtop-powered systems to take advantage of a 
seamless upgrade in the first half of 2011.</p>

<p>First introduced in 2007, the flagship Splashtop product is a 
Linux-based instant-on platform that allows users to get online, 
access e-mail, and chat with friends seconds after turning on their 
PCs.  The MeeGo project combines Intel's Moblin and Nokia's Maemo 
projects into one Linux-based, open source software platform for the 
next generation of computing devices.</p>

<p>By embracing MeeGo as the foundation for Splashtop, application 
developers have the possibility to distribute their software to 
millions of potential users leading to greater adoption of the MeeGo 
platform. DeviceVM will also consider pre-bundling popular 
applications along with distribution of the MeeGo-based Splashtop. In 
moving to a MeeGo-based platform, users will now be able to download, 
install and run hundreds of apps currently available from the Intel 
AppUp Center.</p>

<p>"Since the launch of Splashtop in late 2007, we have received 
thousands of requests from application developers to release an SDK," 
said Mark Lee, CEO and co-founder of DeviceVM. "By embracing MeeGo and 
moving Splashtop to be fully compliant with the specifications 
shepherded by the Linux Foundation, we will effectively open up 
Splashtop to allow developers to deliver high-value applications to 
audiences across a range of computing devices."</p>

<p>Demonstrations of the new Meego-based Splashtop product were seen 
during the IDF expo.</p>

<p>DeviceVM is an active Linux proponent, and earlier this year announced 
the election of CEO and co-founder Mark Lee to the Linux Foundation 
Board of Directors.</p>

<p>The MeeGo-based Splashtop is already being made available to leading 
PC OEMs currently shipping Splashtop on a range of device types. 
Consumer and commercial end-users will be able to upgrade to the new 
Splashtop in the first half of 2011.. For more information, visit

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">NetApp and Oracle Agree to Dismiss IP Lawsuits</h3>

<p>NetApp and Oracle have agreed to dismiss their pending mutual patent 
litigation, which began in 2007 between Sun Microsystems and NetApp. 
Oracle and NetApp want to have the lawsuits dismissed without 
prejudice. The terms of the agreement are currently confidential.</p>

<p>Sun released the code to the ZFS or Zettabyte file system used in 
Solaris to its developer community in 2005, but claimed to have 
developed it in-house years earlier.   NetApp sued later, claiming 
that many of the features were similar to the WAFL (Write Anywhere 
File Layout) file system technology used by NetApp.  There were also 
further IP patent suits regarding the Sunscreen technology that NetApp 
acquired in 2008.</p>

<p>No theft of code was alleged by either side.  The conflict was around 
commercial use of similar ideas and design.</p>

<p>"For more than a decade, Oracle and NetApp have shared a common vision 
focused on providing solutions that reduce IT cost and complexity for 
thousands of customers worldwide," said Tom Georgens, president and 
CEO of NetApp. "Moving forward, we will continue to collaborate with 
Oracle to deliver solutions that help our mutual customers gain 
greater flexibility and efficiency in their IT infrastructures."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Broadcom releases open-source driver for its wireless chipsets</h3>

<p>Broadcom has announced the initial release of a fully-open Linux 
driver for it's latest generation of 11n chipsets.  The driver, while 
still a work in progress, is released as full source and uses the
native mac80211 stack.   It supports multiple current chips (BCM4313, 
BCM43224, BCM43225) as well as providing a framework for supporting 
additional chips in the future, including mac80211-aware embedded 
chips.</p>

<p>This is a major shift in policy by a dominant networking vendor.</p>

<p>In a blog entry on Linux.com, Linux Foundation Executive Director Jim 
Zemlin wrote:</p>

<p>"We are extremely happy to see this change for multiple reasons. One: 
it's obviously good to have more technology available to use; we want 
technology to "just work" with Linux and since Broadcom is a major 
technology supplier their absence from the mainline kernel was 
significant. Two: we have been working with our Technical Advisory 
Board on this issue for the last few years to educate vendors on 
Linux' model and why it's in their interest to open source their 
drivers."</p>

<p>The README and TODO files included with the sources provide more 
details about the current feature set, known issues, and plans for 
improving the driver.</p>

<p>The driver is currently available in staging-next git tree, available 
at: 
<a href="git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging-next-2.6.git">git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging-next-2.6.git</a>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">WeTab tablet first with MeeGo open operating system</h3>

<p>In September, WeTab GmbH announced its tablet computer, the WeTab, 
developed in cooperation with Intel, just preceeding the IFA 
international trade fair for consumer electronics in Berlin and IDF in 
San Francisco.  The WeTab, which went on to the German market in 
September, is the first tablet worldwide based on MeeGo.</p>

<p>WeTab OS, the WeTab operating system, is based on the free Linux 
distribution MeeGo and integrates runtime environments for various 
other technologies. In addition to native Linux apps, many other 
applications can run on the WeTab, including Android apps, Adobe Air 
applications and MeeGo apps. Several apps that may be interesting for 
the user have been compiled and are available on the WeTab Market, 
from where they can be loaded directly onto the WeTab. This means that 
developers can program in the languages they are familiar with and 
users can choose from an abundance of very different applications.</p>

<p>The Web-browser plays a special role here and is based on the free

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Release of Oracle Secure Global Desktop</h3>

<p>Further enhancing its comprehensive portfolio of desktop 
virtualization solutions, Oracle released Oracle Secure Global Desktop 
4.6 in September.  Secure Global Desktop is an access solution that 
delivers server-hosted applications and desktops to nearly any client 
device, with higher security, decreased operational costs, and 
increased mobility.</p>

<p>With a highly secure architecture, Oracle Secure Global Desktop helps 
keep sensitive data in the datacenter behind the corporate firewall, 
and not on end user systems or in the vulnerable demilitarized zone 
(DMZ), and can only be accessed by authenticated users with 
appropriate privileges.</p>

<p>Oracle Secure Global Desktop enables an additional layer of security 
for accessing sensitive enterprise applications, beyond using a web 
browser alone, by providing a highly secure Java-based Web client that 
does not retain cookies or utilize Web page cache files that could be 
exploited.</p>

<p>The new release lowers administration overhead by delivering secure 
access to server-hosted applications and desktops from a wide variety 
of popular client devices. Applications and desktops that run on 
Windows, Oracle Solaris, Oracle Enterprise Linux, and other UNIX and 
Linux versions are supported.</p>

<p>Oracle Secure Global Desktop 4.6 is part of "Oracle Virtualization," a 
comprehensive desktop-to-datacenter virtualization portfolio, enabling 
customers to virtualize and manage their full hardware and software 
stack from applications to disk.</p>

<p>Oracle Secure Global Desktop 4.6 enhances the security and centralized 
management of applications in the datacenter by delivering: <br />
- Greater browser flexibility: The Secure Global Desktop client has 
the flexibility to be used with nearly any Java-enabled browser to 
access server-hosted browser instances where the server-hosted 
application requires a different browser, plug-ins, or settings;<br />
- Enhanced availability: The Array Resilience feature automatically 
re-establishes connections to the server array after a primary server 
or network failure to provide higher levels of availability;<br />
- Enhanced application launch control for users: Dynamic Launch 
reduces administration overhead by giving end users greater control 
over launching applications;<br />
- Easier integration with third party infrastructure: Integration 
with third party virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) connection 
brokers, in addition to the existing integration with Oracle Virtual 
Desktop Infrastructure;<br />
- Dynamic Drive Mapping allows users to "hot-plug" hard disk drives 
and USB drives on their PCs and utilize them in Oracle Secure Global 
Desktop sessions;<br />
- Configurable directory services and password management: 
Administrators can configure individual settings for multiple 
directory services, such as Oracle Internet Directory, Microsoft 
Active Directory and other LDAP servers.</p>


<p>"The new capabilities delivered in Oracle Secure Global Desktop 4.6 
underscore our focus on making applications easier to deploy, manage 
and support in virtualized datacenter environments," said Wim 
Coekaerts, senior vice president, Linux and Virtualization 
Engineering, Oracle. "Oracle Secure Global Desktop 4.6 is the latest 
of many new desktop virtualization products and capabilities recently 
announced including new releases of Oracle VM VirtualBox, Sun Ray 
Software and Oracle Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. This demonstrates 
Oracle's continued commitment to providing a comprehensive desktop to 
datacenter portfolio."</p>
