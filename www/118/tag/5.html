	>Sound disappearing with KDE upgrade</H3>


<p><strong>From Mike Orr 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>

<p align="right"><strong>Answered By:  Jimmy O'Regan, Karl-Heinz Herrmann, Ben Okopnik
</strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
I upgraded to <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> 3.4 from 3.3 and went through a ritual that's
unfortunately too familiar: figuring out why my sound disappeared.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The first indication was an error message from my CD player: "Unable to
open cdrom device <TT>/dev/cdrom</TT>".
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$ ls -l /dev/cdrom
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 3 Aug 15 06:00 /dev/cdrom -&gt; hdc
$ ls -l /dev/hdc
brw-rw----  1 root audio 22, 0 Jul 15  2004 /dev/hdc
$ groups
wheel floppy audio cdrom dialout cdrw users portage rex
$ su -c 'chgrp audio /dev/hdc'
Password:
$ ls -l /dev/hdc
brw-rw----  1 root audio 22, 0 Jul 15  2004 /dev/hdc
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Now my CD program would start but was silent.  There was a slash over
the speaker icon in the system tray.  Having had problems with mute
before, I clicked that to open KMix.  There were more  items under the
'Output' and 'Input' tabs than previously, and I quickly saw the
"Output: Master" and "Input: CD", but where was the output for <TT>/dev/dsp</TT>,
and is that the same thing as "Output: PCM"?  I knew the buttons above
or below the sliders were 'mute', but which position is muted?  I
fiddled around to what I thought was right but not a peep from the
computer, so I put on a record instead and went to sleep.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As always, things seem clearer after a good sleep.  I checked the
permissions of <TT>/dev/dsp</TT>, which was symlinked to <TT>/dev/sound/dsp.</TT>  It
already had write permission for group 'audio', of which I was a member,
so I went hunting further.  The speaker still had a slash, so I
single-clicked it and saw a 'Mute' item, which was checked.  I unchecked
it and the 'Ouput: Master' button in KMix went from dark to light.  Aha,
that's the unmuted position.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tried playing a CD again but the permission problem had returned.  I
chgrp'd it and looked through the logs for some message about what it's
doing now, or what it had been doing before the upgrade that it isn't
doing now, but nothing.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I picked a show on the To The Point (<A HREF="http://kcrw.org/show/tp"
	>http://kcrw.org/show/tp</A>) webpage
(RealAudio) and it played OK.  (The main thing I listen to is
time-shifted NPR programs.  TiVo for radio, I guess.  It's frustrating
when you wake up late Saturday morning and can't listen to Weekend
Edition or Car Talk (<A HREF="http://www.cartalk.com"
	>http://www.cartalk.com</A>).  Then you remember, "Oh
yeah, people used to have to listen to programs when they were
broadcast....")
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyway, back to the silent CD player.  Its volume control and 'mute'
button did nothing, so I perused KMix again.  'Input: CD' had the green
and red buttons both dark, so I clicked the green button and Badorb's
"'Ow Much?" played on top of top of Warren Olney.  (The show was called
"Googled!  Will the Internet Come Back to Haunt You?", about how
Google's CEO didn't like having his personal information published after
a reporter, er, googled it.  Oops.")
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So everything is resolved now except the wandering groupness of
<TT>/dev/hdc.</TT>  Since it's Gentoo I'll have to check whether devfs is
operating and whether it's restoring permissions from a tarball.  Hmm,
what all did KDE upgrade with itself?  <TT>/var/log/emerge.log</TT> shows arts,
pam, kdebasepam,  gstreamer, gst* as potential culprits.  And
cdparanoia.  Probably not, but I like the thought of blaming things on
cdparanoia.  (To make emerge.log more readable I wrote a Python program
that converts tick dates to ISO format.)
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/format_emerge_log.py.txt">format_emerge_log.py.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
Well. everything is resolved except that TkMan's font is unreadable.  So
much for "New Century Schoolbook".  I tried "Helvetica - medium -
normal" and the results look, well, vaguely like Hebrew.
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/tkman.png">tkman.png</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
Well, and the fact that Konqueror lost my bookmarks.  Not only that,
they reverted to a configuration not seen since before my Firefox
import.  That was easily fixed with "Bookmarks -&gt; Edit Bookmarks -&gt; File
-&gt; Import -&gt; Import Mozilla Bookmarks".
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyone know how to tame Firefox into playing this sound link?

("No Static at All: Hi-Tech Radio")
It's got some Javascript function to choose the file that seems to be
too much for Firefox.

Whenever I came across a site like that, I normally tried to pick apart
the javascript to find the actual URL, and just grabbed that.

Yes.  It's finding and deciphering the Javascript function that stumped me.

It's called with "javascript:getMedia('ME', '15-Aug-2005', '8',
'RM,WM');", so assuming you want the Real Media version, the URL
should be:

I used to
have a few shell functions for different sites that amounted to
"wget <A HREF="http://some.site/foo/bar?baz"

I'm regularly recording radio shows, musik programs etc. from two German
stations which also broadcast mp3. I'm also using wget, but wanted it to
record a specified time and then terminate. Also I had to check if the
wget actually is running, because for weekly crime radio show (I still
don't know a good translation for Hrspiel, like a book reading but with
different actors) the first trys to get a connection sometimes failed.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
It's probably still quite clumsy, but it the best way I found to get the
pid of the wget from the starting script. I usually run it with at and
get an E-mail with the messages.

Just FYI: the PID of the last backgrounded process you've launched is
contained in "$!" - at least under any "sh"-derived shell.

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~$ date &amp; echo $!

<blockQuote>
Any synchronous processes launched after that don't affect the value in
"$!"; it has to be an asynch process.

I'm thinking about making a cron job that pulls the web pages of my
half-dozen favorite radio shows and makes a menu of the latest ones, so I
can just choose an interesting-sounding title and play it.  Some of the
sites have RSS feeds, so that'll make it easier.

Sometimes you need to set a referer, sometimes you need to masquerade as
another browser, but it's quicker than browsing most of those sites.

On a good note, Firefox can now play the BBC's embedded radio player.

I used to use MPlayer's 'dumpstream' option to listen to the book
readings on BBC4 (usually whenever they had pTerry readings) because
streaming audio annoys the crap out of me.
