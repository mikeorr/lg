If you take it in steps, then it isn't too much of a problem.
</p>

<p>
First, think of how you would express the filename of the files you want to 
delete. Does "all files" include "dot files" (i.e. .config~ )? It will make a 
difference. With regular globbing, bash excludes dotted files from the * 
match. 
</p>

<p>
With regular globbing, the regular expression
<pre>
  *~
</pre>
will match all non-dotted filenames that end with a tilde, while
<pre>
  .*~
</pre>
will match all dotted filenames that end with with a tilde
</p>

<p>
Now that we've got the name figured out, how do we find it. Well, one way is 
to use the find(1) program ("man 1 find" for details). The find(1) program 
takes a list of directories to search, a list of conditions to be met, and a 
list of actions to execute. It searches the given list of directories for 
files and directories that match the given list of conditions, and if a match 
is detected, it executes the given list of actions. One possible action is to 
delete the matching file or directory. For example
  find /home/myhome -name somename -exec rm -f {} \;
will search the directory /home/myhome (and all subdirectories under it) for a 
file or directory named "somename", and if such a file or directory is found, 
find will execute the rm command on that file, deleting it.
</p>

<p>
For you, you want something like
<pre>
  find /home/yourhome -name '*~' -exec rm -f {} \;
</pre>
Since you can use environment variables (you'll run this as a bash script, 
after all), you can use the $HOME envvir to name your home directory. Now the 
command looks like
<pre>
  find $HOME -name '*~' -exec rm -f {} \;
</pre>
Let's put this all together in a script
<pre>
  #!/bin/bash
  find $HOME \( -name '.*~' -o -name '*~ \) -exec rm -f {} \;
</pre>
Done!
