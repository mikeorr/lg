&gt;  &gt; I'd like to correct one common misapprehension, though: you don't have
&gt;  &gt; to learn to program in order to use Linux. in fact, the skills you need
&gt;  &gt; to use it are the same ones that you need for using Windows.
&gt;
&gt;  Actually, I think it's time we counter the hoary "you have to be a
&gt;  programmer to use Linux" farrago with a far more credible counter-meme:
&gt;  You really <em>must</em> be a programmer to stand a chance of not being
&gt;  horribly frustrated by MS-Windows.
&gt;
&gt;  Consider how many times we've heard from MS-Windows users that the poor
&gt;  security architecture, corruption-prone registry, spyware-infested
&gt;  proprietary software marketplace, fragile and fragmentation-tending
&gt;  filesystems, and so on have driven them to utter distraction.

<p>
So true!  My sister just told me how she had recently suffered the
loss of all the data on her laptop, collected over at least three
years.  It was all due to a family member visiting a Web site that
infected the system with some kind of virus.  Her comment to me was
something like "I just hate computers!"  My retort was the usual "The
problem is not inherent to 'computers', but MS Windows's inferior
design.  You really ought to have Linux installed."
</p>

<p>
It's really sad when there is not even the slightest awareness that
the monopoly OS is not the only choice available.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, she and her spouse are at a total loss as to how to
approach it, other than calling the Geek Squad to re-install the
inferior system, and wait for it to happen all over again sometime in
the future.

That does depend on how you define the problem(s).

<p>
In this case, a lack of backups seems to be one of the problems. If the hard 
disk had died, she would still have lost her data, but we couldn't blame Bill.

<p>
Installing Linux helps with one class of problem (even Linux isn't 100% 
secure), but it isn't the whole solution.

<p>
I should have a better backup strategy too ;-)

To a degree, you can:  MS-DOS / MS-Windows systems have historically had
relatively poor and unreliable segregation of user data files from
system files, making it rather more difficult to back up only the files
that merit inclusion in backup sets.  Thus the attitude I commonly see
in Linux newcomers (and even in longtime Linux users who ought to know
better -- harrumph!) of "Oh, backup means just making a separate copy of
the entire hard disk."
</p>

<p>
Knowing which directories need backup and which would be pointless is
<em>much</em> easier on *ixes (well, except for ones with peculiarly botched
trees, like OS X).  Thus "Backup Scheme" on <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Admin/">http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Admin/</a> , 
in fact.

Ah yes, I recently transferred some data between 2 XP systems. The Files and 
Settings transfer Wizard missed 90% of the key data. Most of 
the "documentation" seems to suggest that it will transfer everything. I 
think, in practice it will transfer files and settings related to MS 
applications and files in your "desktop". It's a good job I didn't blindly 
trust it.

Now that you mention it, that's just one more of the myriad annoyances
that have plagued me with that OS family over the years.  Sine I can
remember, I've always created my own Dir branch off of the root dir
where I save all my personal data.  Which does make it easier to copy
off my own data.  However, every time when a saving a new document,
one has to override the default of saving to the MyDocuments branch.

As for myself, I define "backup" to mean having the entire system
backed up in a format so that, in the event that it is necessary to
re-install from scratch, I don't have to go through the pain of first
installing the OS, then the apps, and finally my data.

This assumes that the OS/apps installation need involve pain.  Over at
chez Moen, that's as follows:
</p>

<pre>
1.  Use any Debian installation media (Debian netinst, Sidux, whatever)
to install an absolutely minimal microsystem -- just enough to be barely
functional and have package management tools.
 
2.  Symlink "/opt" to new dir /usr/local/opt.  ("/opt" is dumb.  Make it
    at least live somewhere halfway rational.)
 
3.  scp over the latest ASCII file snapshot of the output of 
    dpkg --get-selections "*"
    Prune it to eliminate libs and anything whose need is doubtful.
 
4.  dpkg --set-selections &lt; [that file]
 
5.  apt-get dselect-upgrade
    Let it do its job for about half an hour.
 
6.  Copy over the snapshot tarball of /etc.  Apply as needed.  
</pre>

<p>
Total elapsed time would be about an hour or so, and inevitably you get
a much better built system than just dumping back a file-by-file replica
of your old OS, apps, and conffiles.
</p>


<p>
Anyway, that aside, your OS and apps probably comprise an immense
quantity of bytes, and changes very little most of the time -- so 
bloating your backup sets with the whole mess every single time is 
a ridiculous waste.  If you're determined to make backup snapshots 
of that large set of files -- which seems to have little utility, to me
-- then at minimum you should consider backing those up separately on a
decoupled and suitable (less frequent) schedule.

There I was referring more to dealing with the Monopoly OS than with
Linux., mostly since my first comment in the thread was in reference
to a 3rd-party monopoly OS system.  My personal experience in dealing
with system problems relating to that OS family almost invariably are
painful.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
When backing up those systems, I don't think that one can do a
tar-style backup, and have it run after a restore.  The only way I've
been able to reliably restore that kind of system is from an image
backup, so that the system files retain their relative positioning
within the filesystem.
</p>

<p>
I've filed your suggestion appropriately for later reference for my
next Linux backup. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
