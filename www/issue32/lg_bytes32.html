Linux Resources Wishlist
</H3> 
<P> 
Many Linux users find themselves using a wonderful operating system, but are 
missing a few of the software packages that they know and love (or are just 
accustomed to). 
<p>
Thus, the Linux Resources wish list is designed to provide the Linux Community 
with an easy way to tally a list of software and hardware that they would 
like to see ported to Linux. The results of this survey can be used when 
contacting vendors. Each vote submitted will be used to provide the proof 
that many vendors need to assure them that their product(s) have a market 
in the Linux OS. 
<p>
What is listed on the Linux Wishlist site?
Software: Programs from every aspect of computing.
Hardware: Specific hardware that you would like to use with Linux. 
<p>
How to vote or add a package to the Wishlist:

lde
</H3>
<P> 

Introducing the new version of lde, the Linux disk editor, for Minix/Linux
partitions.  It currently supports what were once the three most
popular file systems under Linux: ext2fs, minix, and xiafs (there is
also a "nofs" system under which lde will function as a binary
editor).  lde allows you to view and edit disk blocks as hex and/or
ASCII, view/navigate directory entries, and view and edit formatted
inodes.  Most of the functions can be accessed using the program's
curses interface or from the command line so that you can automate
things with your own scripts. lde can also be used to recover files which 
may have been accidentally erased or just to poke around the file system to 
see what it's made of.  I've included a short introduction to the Minix file
system (just enough to get the ideas of blocks and inodes across to
most people) and some docs on the ext2fs (mostly just data out of
linux/ext2_fs.h formatted as tables to make wading through the disk
blocks a little bit easier).  If you aren't familiar with inode based
file systems, you should have a look at those files before proceeding
to the doc/UNERASE file, which details what I think you might try to
recover a file. 

There is no tutorial, but there is a detailed man page.  Look
at docs/lde.man (or docs/lde.man.text) for information on running lde
from the command line and using its ncurses interface.  For more
information on compiling, installing, or running lde for the first
time, see INSTALL and INSTALL.LDE.

version you are using is new enough, you can check

now via middle mouse button. Features include filters to raise/lower/hide
lines, filters to alert/notify/uniconify/execute on lines in logfiles (even
background ones), audio notification for alert/notify/uniconify, TAIL mode 
(basically emulating a "tail -f file"), CAT mode (basically emulating a 
"cat file" in reglar intervals), scrolling back in the logs with a scrollbar 
(size of buffer adjustable by user), all defaults can be overridden by
