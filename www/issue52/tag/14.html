Hello,

Your welcome.  It's a hobby.  Heather does all the hard work
(turning my e-mail babbling into HTML).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<em><p>[ The really hard part is adding code markup where people

1.) I have read that you are using icewm.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here is my question. When I log in as user I would like to
open with a key shortcut an xterm window where I immediately
have a root shell without having to type su. I want to do this
on my portable Linuxbox. Security is of no concern here.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

The desire to have your system deliberately "insecure" is actually
not all that uncommon.  Actually my definition of security is:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
Security is the enforcement of policy.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, where someone else admonishes: "That's not secure!" I
ask, "What is the set of policies that this fails to enforce?"
(Actually I ask: "What are your policies?" then I ask how a
particular set of requirements and constraints affects the
enforcement of those policies?"  But I digress).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here you seem to be expressing a requirement that you be able
to initiate privileged (root) shell sessions without requiring
the use of a password.  You've also expressed a preference that
this be initiated by a key binding in your window manager, icewm.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I should note that, while I am using icewm on a couple of systems,
it is not of any particular preference.  I tend to use whatever
window manager a system defaults to, since my only use for a
window manager is to launch an <tt>xterm</tt>.  From there I launch my
other programs in by simply typing their name at a command prompt.
All common window managers then allow me to drag and resize the
new window (typically I resize it to full screen).  Most of them
allow me to access multiple virtual screens or "panes" --- so
usually I put one or two windows per pane.  If a wm has any
keybindings I tend to learn the ones to cycle from on pane to the
next, and to cycle among the windows on the current pane
([Alt]+[Tab] from MS-Windows, and on some window managers).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It turns out that icewm is a fairly lightweight window manager
with reasonable keyboard controls.  Classically it is against the
philosophy of X to have window managers globally intercepting
keystrokes; those might be intended for the foreground
application.  However, it is a common desire among most users that
they be able to start, kill, switch among and otherwise control
their application using the keyboard rather than being forced to
use a mouse.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this case you can set some keybinding like [Alt]+[Ctrl]+[r]
to start a shell.  You want that shell to be running as root
--- so it would make sense to have it run a root-owned SUID
shell.  In other words you make a copy of whichever shell
you prefer, chown it to root (actually it probably is already
owned by root), chgrp it to some custom group (make a new
one, let's call it "priv") and than mark it as an SUID program
using the <tt>chmod</tt> command.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course we don't want to completely throw all security to the
wind.  It's nice to be able to enforce SOME policies.  So we can
set this so that only members of the group "<tt>priv</tt>" (your normal
account, and any of your trustworthy friends and family) are
in the "<tt>priv</tt>" group.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, I set this up with the following commands:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>groupadd -g 201 priv
mkdir /usr/local/priv
chown root.priv /usr/local/priv
chmod 750 /usr/local/priv
usermod -G priv,staff jimd
usermod -G priv,staff,wheel star
cp /usr/bin/bash /usr/local/priv/sh
chown root.priv /usr/local/priv/sh
chmod 4550 /usr/local/priv/sh
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... so this: creates a group named "<tt>priv</tt>", makes a directory
for it, changes the ownership and group association to <tt>root</tt> and
<tt>priv</tt> respectively (I could do that in two separate commands,
<tt>chown</tt> and <tt>chgrp</tt>, but I prefer the GNU syntactical extension of
separating the user and group names with a dot), and it limits the
access to this "priv" directory (so only members of priv, and the
directory's owner are allowed to access it; then it gives me a
non-world executable, SUID-root copy of bash in the directory.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(NOTE:  The <tt>usermod</tt> commands here might need to be modified
a bit.  Unfortunately the usermod command REMOVES you from
any groups that you don't list on the <TT>usermod -G</TT> argument.
This is a bug in my opinion.  I should be able to just
add people to groups, perhaps using <tt>+G</tt> or some <TT>-G</TT> <tt>+</tt>, syntax
to indication that this is purely additive.  To do this in a
script I'd like to do something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>foo=$( id -Gn $1 | tr " " , )
foo=$foo,$2
...
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... where <tt>$1</tt> was the user name and <tt>$2</tt> was the new group (or
common delimited list of new groups -- with no spaces).  But
I digress again).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've actually put (redundant) layers of protection here.  I
prevent anyone that's not in the priv group from seeing or
accessing any of the contents of the priv subdirectory, AND I
prevent anyone outside of the priv group from executing the
file directly.  Either of these measures alone should enforce
the policy that "only members of the "priv" group are allowed to
execute this copy of the shell (which runs with 'root'
privileges).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are other ways to do this, including using programs like
'<tt>super</tt>' and '<tt>calife</tt>' and even '<tt>sudo</tt>'.  Classically '<tt>sudo</tt>' allowed
a sysadmin to control access to a set of privileged commands, but
required that the users accessing those commands type in THEIR OWN
password in order to run any of those commands.  Thus you were
enforcing the policy that a user could run certain, specified,
privileged commands (not necessary as 'root')  but that they must
present their password (or have done so within the last few
minutes, according to a configurable caching feature in later
versions of sudo). The latest versions of sudo are supposed to
allow one to configure certain users and members of certain groups
to execute commands without requiring them to type their password.
This was added to allow people to execute privileged '<tt>at</tt>' commands
and '<tt>cron</tt>' jobs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You could use '<tt>sudo</tt>' for this, but my example will work on any
form of UNIX and without any additional packages.  Mine is a
bit simpler, and less flexible.  (It also probably takes up
slightly more disk space since an extra copy of bash is bigger
than the whole sudo package).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, once you have created a shell (or installed sudo, calife,
or whatever) then you can simply create a line in your icewm/keys
file like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>key "Alt+Ctrl+s" xterm -title "SuperUser xterm"  -e /usr/local/priv/sh
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... (and you can add any other <TT>-fg</TT> <TT>-bg</TT> <TT>-fn</TT> and <TT>-geometry</TT>
arguments to get the foreground and background color, default
font and size/placement settings that you like).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I picked [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[s] for this example, but many other
keys will work.  (Oddly enough, [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[r] did NOT work
with my copy of icewm --- which is from the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> package,
I grabbed the sources and noticed that this "<tt>r</tt>" combination
is defined as "<tt>defgKeySysRun</tt>").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Read the xterm man page for all your xterm options.  Don't forget
that you can also use lightweight xterm alternatives like <tt>rxvt</tt>
if '<tt>xterm</tt>' doesn't make you happy enough.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that there many other considerations when running this sort
of configuration.  One reason that didn't suggest that you simply
configure the root account to have an empty password is that it
would then offer NO protection.  This arrangement preserves an
implicit policy that the shell be started by some process that is
already authenticated as "you."  A null password approach could
mean that processes initiated over the wire (completely
unauthenticated) could gain root access (and be basically
immune from all other attempts to enforce any policies).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've tried to describe an approach which reasonably matches your
requirements while also being a an egregious compromise to
sysadmin's "best practice."   Note that any "attacker" who tricked
any program that you run into executing arbitrary code could
potentially execute your privileged copy of the shell, and then
do anything to your system.  Thus the potential damage from
trojan horses, black widows (hostile bits of JavaScript or other
dynamic web content) etc are much greater.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's consider that scenario for a moment.  You log in as
"yourself" (maybe an account named "marc").  You run a program
like your mail client, newsreader or web browser.  You are running
in one security context (you user account) and interacting with
data from another context (anonymous, internet users).  Your
applications are implicity trying to enforce a set of policies
(viewing this content as data, rather than executing it as
instructions from YOU).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Any bug in the data handling of any of these programs might be
interpreted as code (buffer overflows, etc).  A cleverly
degenerate bit of mail, news, or HTML (or HTTP protocol
handshaking) might then be able to trick your mail user agent,
newsreader, or web browser (or any program which those execute
as they process data) into executing arbitrary code.  Since the
program is being run by you, it can do anything that you can do.
If a program you run is hostile, it can completely corrupt or wipe
out all of your data.  If it is run as root it can wipe out your
whole system.  (It can also create "backdoors" through which it
can give access to your system to others).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you were concerned about this sort of thing, one option is to
create additional accounts.  You can do your web browsing from
one account, and your mail from another, and your news from
another.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you did a bit of clever work with the groups you could
give your news reader read/only access to some of your mail
folders, and your mail agent read and/or read/write access to
some of your newsreader functions, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course managing this various roles is far beyond anything that
most users, particularly home users, are prepared to do.  So we
must try to eliminate the bugs in our applications software that
allow untrusted data to be subverted.  (Linux is way ahead of
MS-Windows in this regard.  However the various BSD's, <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A>
in particular, are somewhat ahead of Linux, too).  Specific
applications (like Lynx and Netscape's Navigator and Communicator
packages are WAY behind others like <tt>elm</tt>, <tt>mutt</tt>, etc).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But I digress once again.  On to your other question.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

2.) How can I boot directly to icewm as a specified user without
having to type in my username and password. Can a simple
script in initrc do that ?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

I refer to this as running X in "toaster mode."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is for people who want their computer to be an
appliance --- walk up and use it, no login required.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is surprising tricky to get this to work on modern
Linux boxes running recent versions of X.  I had to
spend a couple hours playing with it, running it under
strace and finally resorted to downloading the sources
and reading through some of them (<tt>xserver-wrapper.c</tt> from
the Debian patches).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Basically here's what you'd expect to be able to do:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
Add a line to <TT>/etc/inittab</TT> like:
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>x:4:respawn:/root/sbin/toasterX
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
And change the inittdefault line to something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>id:4:initdefault:
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(You'd now be using the custom "runlevel 4" as your default
mode of operation).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
And you'd expect the <tt>toasterX</tt> script to simply execute <tt>startx</tt>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course you don't want X running as root, so you have to
run it as some other user.  No problem, that's what the <tt>su</tt> command
is for.  If you are using a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>su - joe -c "/usr/bin/X11/startx"
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You'd think that might do the trick.  Alas, you'd be wrong.  I
kept getting "You are not authorised to run X" when I tried this
script through <tt>init</tt>, even though it worked fine from a shell
prompt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What I learned from the sources is that the <tt>Xwrapper</tt> program which
is starting your real copy of the X server is actually testing to
see if it's standard input file descriptor is attached to a
console.  This is presumably to protect your system from some
remote attacker running X (or XWrapper) on your console, through
some form of network login, cron job, at job, or other hack.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So we have to direct the input from a console.  I really doesn't
matter which one, just so long as it's from one of the <TT>/dev/ttyXX</TT>
nodes (where XX is a number).  My toasterX script looks like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/sh
exec /bin/su - guest -c "/usr/X11R6/bin/startx" &lt; /dev/tty14 &gt; /dev/tty15
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... where I'm arbitrarily using tty14 for input and tty15 for
output.  (I do that since I might want to read some of the error
messages that it output to that virtual console if I have problems
with X later --- you wouldn't need that).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's the trick.  Heather, my wife, got it working without this
redirection hack.  She's on <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>, 
I'm using Debian (Woody --
the developmental releases).   I don't know which version of Red
Hat Heather is running on her laptop.  So your mileage may vary.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<em><p>[ It's Red Hat 6.1, and I believe that I used an uncommon command line
	option to the X server to specify which vt it should use.  In which
	case, I am guessing, it checks to see if that vt is free to hog,
	instead.  OTOH, maybe Red Hat's Xwrapper didn't have the defense
	mechanism you saw in the debian source.
</p><p>-- Heather ]</p></em>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(One of the guys at <A HREF="http://www.linuxcare.com/">Linuxcare</A> was wondering how to do this, and
I was stumped for the short time I had to try it.  That was on a
Mandrake system.  Sylvester --- I knew I'd figure it out
eventually!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's one cool thing about how this is done; it will
automatically respawn a new X session when you logout/exit the
last one.

Sorry it took so long to get around to it.  I'd been meaning to
unravel that <tt>Xwrapper</tt> mystery for Sylvester anyway.  Sometimes I
get too busy to hunt one down for a month or two.
