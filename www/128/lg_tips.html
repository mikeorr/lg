<h3>2-cent tip: Desktop Icon Text Color under KDE</h3>

 <em>Answered by:  Brian, Thomas</em> 
 <p>Google didn't help. Usually when I go to find these things, Google takes 
  me to one of my own posts, so I can smack myself around as I gripe that 
  &quot;I used to know that&quot;. Even though I've put myself through this in 
  prior iterations, I must never have posted it. Now it's time to get this 
  information out there so that I won't be insane (over this particular 
  issue) ever again...</p>
<p>Setting KDE's desktop icon text color has always, always made me insane. It's 
  not in the same place with all the other color settings, oh, no! To set most 
  item colors in a KDE setup, you use the Control Center, select Appearance &amp; 
  Themes, then Colors. A simple easy-to-navigate interface for setting almost 
  every foreground, background and select color under KDE. But if you want to 
  set Desktop text color ... well, that's not listed. I always end up poking and 
  prodding for a considerable while. I found it again, today, and wanted to put 
  it up for me and others to find. So, to set the KDE (versions 3.4 and 3.5, at 
  least) desktop icon text, from the Control Center select Appearance &amp; Themes. 
  Choose Background from the sub-menu. Yeah, Background. Who knew? Then, click 
  on the Advanced Options button. There are three sub-panes in the resulting dialog. 
  The first, Background Program is usually all I see before bailing out of that 
  dialog. But keep looking. Further down, there's Background Icon Text. Not Desktop, 
  oh, no. And that's not to be found in the general color settings tab, for heaven's 
  sake, no! Now I understand the reasoning behind where it is. But since for all 
  the rest of the world, that's the Desktop, why not call it that, or make it 
  easy to find using the Desktop term. And, praise Baal, why not let people change 
  that text color in the standard tool as well as in the special secret place!</p>
<p> PS: Also &quot;published&quot; on <a href="http://www.orbdesigns.com/">my 
  own site</a>, on Monday, April 10, 2006. No worries!</p>
<p>[Thomas] - (Quoting Brian) <em>Setting KDE's desktop icon text color has always, 
  always made me insane.</em></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Hehe. And in FVWM all that would need is one or two colorset definitions 
    and then:</p>
  <pre class="code">
    Style * IconTitleColorset &lt;n&gt;, HilightIconTitleColorset &lt;n&gt;    </pre>
  <p>... never mind, though. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Brian]] - Yes, I know. And when I get tired and need things simplified, there's 
  always *box (most often fluxbox). I often don't know why I keep dropping 
  back to KDE - I think I like the kicker. I <strong>know</strong> that I use those icons 
  on the desktop once in a blue moon, and really should just turn off 
  &quot;Background Icons&quot;. That would be another solution to my dilemma.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I even dabble in FVWM from time to time, and have a carefully saved FVWM 
    configuration someplace safe (safe == well hidden). Find and locate are my 
    friends, though.</p>
  <p>Bottom line, however, was that finding that setting was a PITA, and I'm glad 
    I did it, and documented it. I also bugged it as a wishlist item with the 
    KDE team.</p>

<h3>2-cent tip: Using two computers with one kbd/mouse</h3>

 <p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong>If some of you are unlucky(:)) enough to get confused because you have 
  two computers on your desktop and you forget which keyboard/mouse is connected 
  with which computer then this tip may help.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You need to choose &quot;master&quot; which is the computer connected 
  to the keyboard/mouse you will actually use. You can later put away the mouse 
  and keyboard of the other computer in order to avoid getting confused. The &quot;master&quot; 
  must be an X-window machine(*) but the &quot;slave&quot; can be anything.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After you execute these steps and &quot;go west&quot; off the screen 
  on the master your keyboard and mouse events will be directed at the slave. 
  (**)</strong></p>
<p><strong>You need to install &quot;x2x&quot; and &quot;x2vnc&quot; on the master.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;slave&quot; is also X-window. </strong></p>
<pre class="code">   From the slave log in to the master using ssh X forwarding

		slave:$ ssh -X luser at master

	Then run "x2x" on the master via this ssh session as follows

		master:$ x2x -from :0 -to $DISPLAY -west &amp;

	Here you replace west with the appropriate direction (west
	equals left and north equals up) in which the monitor of the
	"slave" is.</pre>
<p><strong>&quot;slave&quot; is Linux in &quot;console&quot; mode. </strong></p>
<pre class="code">	On the slave you run "linuxvnc"

		slave:$ linuxvnc &amp;

	This will give you a port number (usually 5900) which you
	must use below. I'll use 5900 as the port since that is
	standard. Next start an ssh tunnel to the master.

		slave:$ ssh -f -N -R 5900:localhost:5900 master 

	Finally on the master you run

		master:$ x2vnc -west localhost:0 &amp;</pre>
<p><strong>&quot;slave&quot; is &quot;OtherOS&quot;.</strong></p>
<pre class="code">
	On the slave you need a VNC server like "WinVNC" for Windows
	and "OSXVnc" for Mac OS X. You also need "ssh" unless you allow
	the VNC server to accept connections over the net (bad
	security). You then follow the same sequence:
		(a) start the VNC server on slave
		(b) start the ssh tunnel on slave
		(c) start x2vnc on master.</pre>
<p><strong>(*) I know that I should use the term "machine which is running 
  an X-server" instead of X-window machine but I hope the nomenclature is 
  clear enough. (**) There are other options like clicking in a window to switch 
  the focus but this "trick" of going west seemed the neatest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hope this magic helps someone.</strong></p>



<p>[Kapil] - Here is another way to do this---synergy. You can find this at </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/synergy2">http://sourceforge.net/projects/synergy2</a> </p>
  <p>There are also Debian packages. </p>
  <p><strong>The simplest possible config.</strong></p>
  <p>On the master you create a file called (say) synergy.conf that contains: 
  </p>
  <pre class="code">	section: screens
		center:
		lefty:
	end
	section: links
		center:
			left = lefty
		lefty:
			right = center
	end</pre>
 <p>you then run: </p> 
  <pre class="code">  synergy -c synergy.conf &amp;</pre>
  
  <p>On the slave you run:</p>
  <pre class="code">	ssh -f -N -L 24800:localhost:24800 master
	synergyc -n lefty localhost</pre>
  <p>This is simpler than x2x or x2vnc and the master can also be a machine other than Linux.</p>

<h3>2-cent tip: Using your text consoles from remote locations</h3>

 <em>Answered by:  </em> 
 <p>Hello,</p>
<p>You may be on an Xsession that has disabled switching to "console" 
  mode or you may want to access the text console of a remote machine. Whatever 
  it is two programs may be useful. One is "conspy" and the other is 
  "linuxvnc".</p>
<p>"conspy":</p>
<blockquote><p>Say you have access to the machine as root. Login and run 
  "conspy 1" where you can replace 1 with the number of the<br>
  console you want to access (don't try this with the vt on which X is running!). 
  <a href="http://www.stuart.id.au/russell/files/conspy/">http://www.stuart.id.au/russell/files/conspy/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>"linuxvnc":</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose someone with root access on the machine is kind 
  enough to run "linuxvnc 1" where 1 has the same meaning as above. 
  You can then connect your favourite vncviewer to "machine:0" and access 
  the console. <a href="http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/">http://libvncserver.sourceforge.net/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The latter has some advantages in that anyone can be given access without root 
  priviledges. The former is distinctly "faster".</p>

<h3>2-cent tip: Recording live playback using ALSA</h3>
 
 <p>Kapil Hari Paranjape (kapil at imsc.res.in) 
 <br />

 <em>Answered by:  </em> 
 <p>Hello,</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever felt the urge to record some &quot;live&quot; music while 
  you are listening to it? The following procedure might do what you want.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites: The sound on your computer should use a 1.x release 
  of the ALSA drivers and you have alsa-lib (Debian's libasound2) installed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Assumptions: You don't already have a $HOME/.asoundrc file. If you 
  do, then you need to edit it suitably. You also should not have a<br>
  script/program called &quot;recording&quot; :-)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Result: You run &quot;recording -on&quot; to start recording. You then 
  start your live playback. After you have had enough you stop the live playback. 
  You then run &quot;recording -off&quot; and are left with a (large) file containing 
  the recording.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. First create a file called &quot;$HOME/.asoundrc&quot; <a href="misc/mail/asoundrc.txt">like 
  the one enclosed</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Create the links.</strong></p>
<pre><strong>   ln -s /dev/null /var/tmp/null.raw
   ln -s /var/tmp/null.raw /var/tmp/record.raw</strong></pre>
<p><strong>3. Next install the script &quot;recording&quot; somewhere in your 
  path (download it <a href="misc/mail/recording.txt">here</a>.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. That's it!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>
<p><strong>a. This only works for digital live playback through the PCM device 
  of your soundcard. You can use &quot;arecord&quot; for the other devices since 
  these can usually be &quot;captured&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b. Don't forget to copy/convert your recording /var/tmp/sound.raw to 
  a safe location. </strong></p>
<p><strong>c. This only works with audio players that support alsa-lib. To get 
  it to work with other players like &quot;realplay&quot;, install alsa-oss<br>
  and use &quot;aoss realplay&quot; instead of &quot;realplay&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>d. You usually cannot run &quot;recording -on/-off&quot; while the 
  player has the audio device open. For many players (in particular those like 
  (c) above), you must quit the player before and after recording.</strong></p>
<p><strong>e. The supplied .asoundrc converts the incoming audio to CD format. 
  This may lead to a loss in quality but I prefer it to &quot;guessing&quot; the 
  real format of the raw data in each case.</strong> </p>

<h3>2-cent tip: vpac for Vim</h3>

<p>As a Linux and Vim user, I like to use Vim to write programs and
subroutines in various programming languages. I developed 'vpac' as a
series of programming aids for Perl, gcc, g++ and asm, using Vim as the
focal point.</p> 

<p>'vpac' and its related files allow you to compile, debug and run programs
all within one Vim session. Another feature is the ability to
comment/uncomment existing code with a single keystoke.</p>

<p>'vpac' works like a global makefile in that you can build several small files
into one executable file. It detects the programming language that you are
using and selects the appropriate compiler/assember. 'vpac' can also carry
out mixed language builds, i.e. c/c++ and asm.</p>

<p>It is easy to use - all the commands are run from function keys.</p>

<p>'vpac' comes as a <a href="misc/mail/vpac-0.2.tar.gz">tar-gzipped
package</a> which includes various 'Howto's and all of the source code.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mike Lear</p>
