Hi. I'm looking for a quick solution to getting at the hds of this
beast, and am asking wherever I can. Being blind, this precludes looking
at photos, or I probably would have had it. I succeeded in removing the
large back panel with the thumbscrews, but according to an article I
read somewhere, I have to remove the cd-rom/floppy and the front grill.
Any tips for doing that? I can't figure out how it goes in, let alone
how to get it out.

  /dev/sda6           /workarea
  
  /dev/sdb5          /workarea/module1/mydata/projectdata

          So other than projectdata everything is on /dev/sda6
</p>


<p>
Now in machine B
</p>

<p>
I want the same directory stucture ,entire /workarea to be seen including
"projectdata"
</p>

<p>
                      Since "/workarea/module1/mydata/projectdata" is a
separate hardisk I need to export it separately.
</p>

<p>
I couldnt mount it on the same place as A in B

Hi all!
</p>

<p>
I recently installed FC5 and FC6 on a newly acquired AMD 2800+ Sempron
processor(64-bit). There are a few things i would like to get cleared
</p>

<p>
1. While the packages were being copied, I noticed the i386 extension
packages being copied. Isnt i386 supposed to mean intel 80386?
</p>

<p>
2. The FC5 and FC6 that i installed on my 64-bit AMD was also installed on
my 32-bit celeron. That means i am using 32bit OS on my 64-bit machine
right? Will i gain performance by using FC5 for 64-bit?
</p>

<p>
Which is the best distro to use on AMD sempron 2800+ ?
</p>

Gang,
</p>

<p>
Recently, there were some discussions at my workplace regd packet
losses in WAN interface. And then, one folk in IT dept came up with
output of "ping" command to highlight that there are no packet losses.
</p>

<p>
Am sure, this is not the correct way to measure packet losses.
</p>

<p>
I feel, they should be monitored over a period of time at the gateway
router and the traffic in this router should be analysed for dropped
packets / timeouts.
</p>

<p>
Is this true ?
</p>

<p>
NOTE: Am not working in the IT dept but one of the affected parties.

<p>
I've got some video recorded on DVD-RAM and I've spent much of today trying to 
figure out how to get from DVD-RAM to a regular DVD, playable in a DVD 
player. I started out thinking this was going to be simple. Just a case of 
copying from one DVD to another. 
</p>

<p>
It's become clear that it's far from simple. The format used for recording to 
DVD-RAM is not the same as the format used for regular DVDs. I could shell 
out $100+ for Windows software that might (or might not) do what I need, but 
I'm not happy with that concept. 
</p>

<p>
I have spent a lot of the afternoon on Google and come up with next to nothing 
of use. Do the gang have any pointers to information, software (preferably 
Linux software) and other resources that will help me get video from DVD -RAM 
to DVD.

Hi.  I attempted to run your script at
<a href="../issue66/tag/2.html">http://linuxgazette.net/issue66/tag/2.html</a> on a directory on a USB drive,
ext3 partition, on a gentoo box with a 2.4 kernel.  The result (it seems to
be from your script, but maybe I'm wrong) is that many of the subdirectories
linux now thinks are not, in fact, directories, and for many others, it
gives an "Input/Output Error" on ls.  Any suggestions?

Hi,
</p>

<p>
My Name is Raj and i work as a technical recruiter in a software
consulting firm. 
</p>

<p>
At our office we have a Red hat Linux based system at our office which
we use to train students on java/j2ee, the problem is that students are
able to access the linux server(using ssh) from within the office
intranet, but not via internet from their homes. They get a pop up from
the ssh client saying that "the host x.x.x.x is unreachable.  the host
may be down, or there may be a problem with the network connection. some
times the problem is caused by a misconfigured firewall" 
</p>

<p>
The students are able to ping the server(we have a static IP assigned to
us by the ISP) from their homes. I need your help in resolving the above
problem.BTW the server is behind two switches, the first witch is
connected to the DSL modem provided by the ISP ,and i have set the
required port forwarding settings
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance

&gt; I've never personally used ELinks to edit a wiki, however
&gt; I have heard about various problems related to the poor
&gt; caching and encoding support of ELinks. Maybe you can
&gt; share a bit more about any problems you have encountered?
</pre>

<p>
I am assuming more that Michael meant one that displays properly in
ELinks.  Of course, this is related to the limited CSS capabilities that
ELinks currently has, but it's not all doom and gloom depending on the
wiki engine ELinks is looking at.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, Wikipedia, and other sites which use Wikimedia are the
worst if only because they're very CSS-intensive -- and don't really
give much, if any, consideration for people who use text-based browers
or even screen-readers.  If you look at the preferences page for, say,
wikipedia, the best skin to choose I have found is "Classic".  This
reduces the rather long list of options at the end of the document (the
"sidebar that wikipedia has which displays to the left-hand side in
Firefox).  Of course, the default theme wikipedia has displays fine --
it's just that ELinks renders the CSS part without positioning at the
end of the document.
</p>

<p>
Moinmoin, OTOH, is perhaps the better wiki engine that's ELinks
friendly.  If you look here:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://fvwmwiki.bu-web.de">http://fvwmwiki.bu-web.de</a>
</p>

<p>
You'll note that the main options are at the top of the page instead
(because ordinarily they'd appear horizontally across the page in some
other browser).  Since MoinMoin hides any user preferences in a separate
page, and doesn't list all sorts of weirder options for you to choose
from in some sort of sidebar like wikimedia does, visually, it's much
nicer, IMO. 
</p>

<p>
Again, along similar lines is the all-perl wiki engine "UseMod" which is
very Elinks friendly, since it's a very simple wiki engine:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.hantslug.org.uk">http://www.hantslug.org.uk</a>
</p>

<p>
... is such an example.
</p>

<p>
Now, you're probably going to ask what you can do in order to try and
improve the look of wikipedia, aren't you?  ;)  The truth is there isn't
a lot you can do unless you decide to script replacement operations via
either Lua, Guile, Perl or Ruby.  Since I've done a tiny bit of work in
ELinks with Ruby that'd be my first choice.  Not that it matters, of
course.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the biggest thing which annoys me about wikimedia with ELinks is
how wikimedia decides to link images.  If you look at this, for
instance:

I don't think the question wasn't asked properly.
It's a question that none of us can answer. What is easy for you ???

I personally use gentoo. It has several tools to query installed software.
Others will use redhat or redhat derivates, they have several tools to
query installed packages as well.
Again others will use $Distro which has several tools to query installed
packages.
And then there are a lot of people who use Debian which....... you get
my drift.
</p>

<p>
Important to note is that both redhat and debian have a large group of
so-called derivate distributions:
<pre>
Redhat -&gt; Fedora, Mandrake, Suse, Centos, and more are all based on the
RPM-package system
Debian -&gt; Ubuntu, Knoppix, Freespire/Linspire (or whatever their latest
marketing name is) and more are all based on the apt-package system
</pre>
You need to think about criteria which make it easy or not easy for you.
Other criteria may also be of interest f.e. the amount of people using a
given distro and/or it's derivates.
Maybe you could design that part of the software to be easily plugable
so new package-database query engines could be written fast and easy ?
</p>

<p>
I believe distro-watch keeps a list of the top-10 most-used distributions.
You may want to take a look at those ten and decide based on that.
</p>

<p>
Depending on your decisions on the above matter you may choose one over
the other, from a technical/functional perspective I cannot think of a
single distribution that would make sense to recommend you.

</p>

<p>
In November I said I'd gotten a Mac laptop and switched from Linux.
<a href="../132/misc/lg/Nokia_tablet_article.html">http://linuxgazette.net/132/misc/lg/Nokia_tablet_article.html</a>
Well, a funny thing happened on the way to MacWorld.  After being
pleased as punch that I had a working webcam and could see my buddies
in Europe on yahoo messenger, and could plug in multimedia devices and
CDs and printers and have them just work immediately, and not have all
these "plugin not available" messages in my web browser, other things
started getting to me.  My non-programmer friend who went from Windows
to Mac and just raves about it does not understand any of this, but I
miss being able to ...
</p>

<p>
- right-click windows and make them go to the back
- hide the maximize button or make it maximize only vertically
- change the window decorations or have the entire window border be a
resize control
- cut &amp; paste by drag-move-click instead of drag, cmd-X, move, click, cmd-V
- install the Gimp by just clicking an entry in the system package manager
- find cool free software, which used to exist by the ton for the Mac
but now all the worthwhile programs seem to be written for Unix, and
you have to use third-party package managers (Fink or DarwinPorts) to
install them -- which may or may not work.
- compile a program that depends on Tk, even though I have Tk
installed.  (./configure doesn't recognize it even though it's in the
default Mac location)
- switch to a second desktop. (Multiple desktops are coming to the
next version of Mac OS X, with much fanfare.)
- have X apps that are first-class citizens.  (Mac X11 is an
application, and X apps are subapplications.  Focus-follows-mouse
works between X applications, but you have to click on an X window to
raise it before using it if you're coming from a Mac application.)
</p>

<p>
Finally I thought, why am I knocking myself out trying to accommodate
myself to the Mac when it's so easy on Linux.  So I switched to my
desktop computer again and installed Kubuntu (from Gentoo).  Ahh, nice
look-and-feel comes back!  Configurability again!  Thousands of
software titles can be downloaded and installed and removed in a few
easy steps!
</p>

<p>
As I've explored more of KDE as it's preconfigured on Kubuntu, I found
that this version it does automatically start a player when you put a
CD on, and opens a image directory when you plug a camera in.
(Actually, you get a choice of several programs to open these in.)
The new Yahoo Messenger for Linux has webcam options, so maybe if I
get a USB webcam it will actually work on Linux now  (I have a bunch
of friends in Europe that I see only every 2-3 years.  Hi bro's!) You
can even drag n drop from one application (GQview image browser) to
another (Firefox upload file dialog) and it pastes the absolute path
of the file.  That pretty much covers everything I wanted from the
Mac.

&gt; Yep. The first thing to look at - and, of course, the first thing that
&gt; Jonathan should have sent in - is the content of his GRUB configuration
&gt; and the output of 'displaymem' and 'geometry' GRUB commands. However, at
&gt; this point, the advice that he got from Neil should be sufficient to fix
&gt; the problem. If it's not, then it'll be time to come back here, to
&gt; checkpoint #1, and try again.

<p>
Thanks guys.  Neil's suggestion worked (with a little tweaking).
Here's what I did to fix it:
<pre>
grub&gt; root (hd0,0)
grub&gt; find /boot/grub/stage1
grub&gt; setup (hd0)
</pre>
Now it works.
</p>

<p>
Ben, you are right, I should have brought in the config files, I'll
remember that for next time.
Thanks for your help!  And to clarify, the error from grub, upon boot, was:
Grub Hard Disk Error
Not much help.  I was able to boot because the LiveCD, which I installed from,
has an option to boot hda1.  Very useful.  Once again, thanks for the help.

Hi,
</p>

<p>
I'm totally new to Linux and IT fullstop, so please teach me to suck
eggs!!  I have been asked to build a Linux (server) firewall it is to
sit between a small part of our LAN and the rest of the LAN.  The small
part of the network is called GB and is on192.*.*.2, it goes straight
into the firewall eth0 192.*.*2.  Eth1 is 10.*.*.1, now whatever I do I
cannot get the GB to see the rest of the network, I have enabled ip
forwarding.  I've tried a couple of things, 'iptables -t nat -A
POSTROUTING -i eth1 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE' this came back saying
POSTROUTING and -i couldn't be used togeather!  When i took -i out I got
an error saying 'invalid argument'.

<p>
Greetings!
</p>

<p>
I guess Emacs users (and all non-vim users) can cheerfully skip this
question.
</p>

<p>
Have you ever noticed when you're typing quickly in "vim" that things
sometimes go haywire?
I only recently got around to figuring out how to reproduce this "vim"
glitch, I guess because
I was so used to "vi" that I didn't consciously remember the names of the
keys I was pressing.
</p>

<p>
So anyways, if you open a file with some text in it, then pick a line of
reasonable length,
and use shift A to append, then press the Esc key to leave append mode, then
immediately
press shift O to insert a new line above and start typing immediately, bad
things happen.
It seems that occasionally after pressing shift O that it takes vim almost
half a second to
catch up, during which I guess it's not yet in insert mode.
</p>

<p>
Does the same thing happen for you?
</p>

<p>
And why only for shift O, not for any of the other ways of getting into
insert mode?
</p>

<p>
I didn't find the answer in the vim FAQ.
I guess I might have to go to the source code, any hints on where to start
looking?
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
Peter.

Belltown Media Acquires Linux Journal
</p>

<p>
Houston, TX --  Dec. 4, 2006 -- Belltown Media, Inc., a privately
held Houston, TX-based media corporation today announced the acquisition
of the premier Linux publication, Linux Journal. Since its first issue
was published in April of 1994 Linux Journal has established a strong
position in the industry by catering to the loyal base of the Linux
audience.
</p>

<p>
Well-known as the original magazine of the Linux community, Linux
Journal has grown significantly in readership and editorial reputation
since its first issue and has come to be recognized worldwide as the

5, 2006.
</p>

<p>
Belltown Media was founded by Carlie Fairchild who has worked closely
with Linux Journal founder and Linux luminary Phil Hughes for more than
ten years.  "As Linux Journal grew over the years,"  said Hughes,
"Carlie took on many publisher-related tasks and became increasingly
active in the Linux community. I promoted her to associate publisher a
few years back where she naturally excelled. That pretty much only left
one more possibility for her and that was to run the place. So, she has
been. And, well, now it is official." In addition to Fairchild, the
majority of the Linux Journal team will continue in their current roles
for Linux Journal under Belltown Media.
</p>

<p>
"This is a great opportunity for Linux Journal and for the industry
as a whole," said Fairchild. "We intend to take a hands-on approach,
working very closely with community leaders and our base of loyal
constituents to ensure that the magazine's content will be relevant and
useful, and that Linux Journal will be an enduring resource. We're
looking forward to taking LJ to the next level by focusing on this core
capability - delivering a highly specialized source of information for
Linux enthusiasts."

I'd be interested in reading the best, most BASIC book
about Linux and the joys of migrating from Windows XP.
Mine is a stand-alone eMachines T1120, about 5 years
old, used just for personal idiotics, not for
business. XP crashes regularly and often, usually when
I click on Minimize, maximize or close.
I'll need a stable system if I'm goin' to whup the
IRS's butt, which I know can be done. I'll need a
quick, easy, and reliable installation. Is that too
much to tax...I mean ask?

Hi James,
      My Name is raj and i work as a technical recruiter at technofina
Inc, we are a NewYork based Software consulting firm. I work as a unix
admin too some times(i suck at it tough). Well comming to the problem, i
have a Red hat Linux based system at our office which we use to train
students on java/j2ee, the problem is that students are able to access
the linux server(using ssh) from the office intranet, but not via
internet from their homes.
                The students are able to ping the server(we have a
static IP assigned to us by the ISP).
I need your help in resolving the above problem.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance

That depends, based on the error you're getting.  If they're actually
bad sectors that's typically indicative of a much more serious hardware
issue.  If, however, running fsck on it repeatedly doesn't help, then it
really is screwed.

<p>
Of course not -- software cannot determine that.  Every piece of
hardware has a finite life-span.

&gt; Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Is ext2 the right choice?  Or would reiserfs be better? Vfat??

<p>
How long's a piece of string, and by-the-by what type of fish is that?
VFAT would be good for cross-platform.  Ext2 is good for read-only
mount points.  Ext3 is somewhat better thanks to the fact that it's ext2
with a journal bolted on to it.  Reiserfs' killer feature is its
developer (:P) and works well with lots of smaller, sporadic files.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; 2. Is their a quick way to detect bad sectors?  I tried running e2fsck
