<p><strong>From Benjamin A. Okopnik 
</strong></p> 


<p align="right"><strong>Answered By  Jay R. Ashworth, Mike "Iron" Orr, John Karns, Jim Dennis
</strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
There are a number of services available in "<TT>/etc/init.d</TT>" that I use
only occasionally - "pdnsd" and "ntpdate", for example - and so they're
not auto-started in my "<TT>/etc/rc*.d</TT>". In order to save myself repeatedly
typing
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>su -c '/etc/init.d/pdnsd start'
</font></code></blockquote>
<P><STRONG>
"stop", etc., I decided to make the command line a bit clearer via the
following script:
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="../misc/tag/okopnik.usr-local-bin-start.bash.txt">okopnik.usr-local-bin-start.bash.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
After creating it, I made a number of symlinks to it:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>cd /usr/local/bin
for n in stop reload restart force-reload; do ln -s start $n; done
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Now, all I have to do is type an action followed by the service name,
like
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>reload pdnsd
start fetchmail
stop mysql
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
etc., as root (or invoke it via "su"). More obvious, less typing.
</STRONG></P>

Except that they're a bit too generic in the global unix namespace,
IMHO.  I did something similar, with a script called svc, about a
release or two before RedHat did something almost identical (though a
bit spiffier) called service.

&lt;shrug&gt; It's easy enough to modify for other "rc.d" variants. The
important thing here was the idea, and the, erm, "source" is available.

For a simpler (and more simplistic way), you can throw these shell functions
into .zshrc.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>function start () { /etc/init.d/$1 start ; }
function stop () { /etc/init.d/$1 stop ; }
function reload () { /etc/init.d/$1 reload ; }
function restart () { /etc/init.d/$1 restart ; }
function ctest () { /etc/init.d/$1 ctest ; }
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Also easier to type than 'service start'....

(I assume bash works the same way?)

That may be a bashism; it works in zsh without the semicolon.  And why would
you need a semicolon?  You normally only need a semicolon between statements,
in "for WORDS ;do", and in the case statement.

Actually this was fixed in bash 2.x.  The fact that bash 1.x allowed
{ WORDS } (with no semicolon) is considered a bug in its parser.  That's
because } is NOT a command separator --- and the command echo } should
simply echo a closing brace.  That leads to an ambiguity in the following:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
{ echo }
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
... is that a complete command group (in the braces) or is it a fragment
including the beginning of a command group (the opening brace) followed
by an echo command (which will print out a close brace character, and a
newline)?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Alternatively the command line:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
{ echo ; }
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
... is unambiguous.
</blockQuote>

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

It's an "sh"-ism, too.  You need one because it terminates a group command. From the "bash" man page:
</P>

<pre> { list; }
        list  is  simply  executed  in  the current shell environment.
        list must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This  is
        known  as a group command.
</pre>
<P>
It doesn't work in .bashrc. Remember that you have to "su" to run them:
</P>

<pre>Baldur:~$ ztart() { /etc/init.d/$1 start; }
Baldur:~$ su -c 'ztart pdnsd'
Password:
bash: ztart: command not found
Baldur:~$ typeset +f | grep -A3 ztart
ztart ()
{
    /etc/init.d/$1 start
}
</pre>

I rarely use the "su -c" syntax.  By the time you get done typing the convoluted
syntax with quotes around the command, you can already be done with an
interactive su session.
</blockQuote>
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
The point here is that doing it the way you suggest makes it more
complex (dependent on whether you did "su" or "su -", for example) and
more fragile. I suppose you could always put it in "<TT>/etc/profile</TT>"...
uh, nope, that would break for "csh", "tcsh", etc. users.  This is one
of those cases where a script is simply better.
</P>
<P>
No idea what you mean by "convoluted syntax", but the same reasoning
applies.

In the case of zsh it appears to treat the close brace as a special
case delimiter.  This leads to inconsistencies like this:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>  zsh$ echo {}
  {}
  zsh$ echo {
  {
  zsh$ echo }
  zsh: parse error near `}'
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
(or something like that).  This is probably a bug in zsh (with regards
to Bourne and Korn shell compatibility.  As I say, it was considered to
be a bug in bash that was noted in a change log for 2.x.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
All of that hairsplitting aside I must say that this is one of the most
annoying changes in bash 2.x.  Like many other shell scripters I'd gotten
into the habit of using constructs like { ...; foo } and I still get
bitten by it occasionally.  (Note that in this example foo is being called
with an argument of } (closing brace) and the group is incomplete.
We must insert a semicolon or a newline (command separators) for it to
parse correctly.

I'd simply learned it as "this is the way it's done"; I guess I came to
it fairly late. One thing that I remember annoyed the hell out of me
early on: trying to launch two progs and background the first one;
seemed like an obvious thing to do
</P>
<P>
prog1 &amp;; prog2
</P>
<P>
- right? Wrong! Only later did I realize that '&amp;' was a valid
</P>
<P>
terminator, just like ';' and newline. Oh, and trying to explain the
order in

Doesn't work for me. Obviously, something in your script is tripping off
"stop", but I see no way that it can be the above "if" statement.

Doesn't work for me, John. I can't see how it would work for you.  If
one of the other Gangsters wants to try it out, cool, but I don't see
how it's even possible (unless you have another script, alias, or
function called "stop".) Here is a simple test:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>echo "./foo" | cut -f5 -d/
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
If you get "foo" out of that, then your "cut" is doing something
magical. Or maybe it's "echo". Of course it could always be gremlins.

That's the only script - as I said I modified it for the test, and it
responded according to my mod, so it's the one being called.  Bash version
is:

Running your test:

<P>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

OK, in that case, here's a guaranteed way to break it:
</P>

<pre>cd /wherever/the/script/is
./stop

I can promise you that it's going to fail. 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

move it into a directory that's "deeper" or "shallower" than the current
one (*there's* a hell of a problem to troubleshoot!) If you use
"${0##*/}", or even "echo $0|sed 's#.*/##'", that fragility goes away.
