<h1>Setting up an Encrypted Debian System</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</a></b></p>


<p> Ever since I heard that the new Debian &#X201C;etch&#X201D; installer supports
encrypted LVM, I wanted to try having an encrypted disk. Given recent
news stories about loss of identity information from stolen laptops,
it is certainly not paranoid to want to do this &#X2014; and if you tell
me otherwise you are probably one of those guys trying to steal my
identity information!
</p>

<p> One way would have been to re-install Debian on my laptop from a Debian
install CD after saving all my data &#X2014; but I can already hear
sarcastic clucking sounds to the accompaniment of flapping arms folded at
the elbows if I even <em>think</em> this way. The whole point of the
exercise would be <b>lost</b> if I have to re-configure my laptop all over
again. So here goes!
</p>

<h2 class="section">Axioms</h2>
<p> 
Let me first describe the disk configuration that I like to have as it
might be a bit unusual. Ever since I learnt about <tt>dmsetup</tt> and
the Linux Device Mapper stuff, my system has had just two partitions:
</p>

<ul class="itemize">
<li class="li-itemize">
<tt>/dev/hda1</tt> which is a small (50-100MB) partition for <tt>/boot</tt>. 
</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><tt>/dev/hda2</tt> which is the rest of the disk and is used
through the device mapper.
</li>
</ul>

<p> 
This allows me to resize filesystems as and when required. Since
Debian &#X201C;sarge&#X201D; I have used the Linux Volume Manager (LVM) rather
than <code>dmsetup</code> to handle this second part. LVM makes it easier to
avoid mistakes while configuring the device mapper.
</p>

<p> If your current setup is a more &#X201C;standard&#X201D; one that consists of a
number of partitions for different purposes, don't worry. As part
of the process, your machine too will be configured the same
way. <em>&#X201C;We are the Borg. Your devices will also be mapped out!&#X201D;</em>
</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Backups Are Important</h3>
<p> 
I <em>do</em> need to assume that you have a backup disk that has enough
space to hold a copy of your entire system. You don't?! Then let's
assume that you have a partition that has enough space to hold a copy
of your entire system. What?! You used up all 40GB of diskspace and
don't even have a backup!!
</p>

<p> In that case, <b>stop</b> reading this article until you have gone and
bought yourself that additional disk space. We won't go anywhere. Come
right here after you get ready to backup before your system breaks.
</p>

<h2 class="section">Making Space in the Boot</h2>
<p> 
So let us assume that <tt>/dev/sda</tt> contains enough free space to
keep a copy of your entire system. This is probably an external USB
disk and requires a little more care while booting.
</p>

<p> The first step in creating a bootable backup is to install all the
tools we will need <em>after</em> we re-boot:
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        apt-get install cryptsetup lvm2 initramfs-tools grub
        apt-get install linux-image-2.6-686 
</pre>

<p> In particular, we will use the stock Debian kernel and the stock Debian
boot system (<tt>grub</tt>+<tt>initrd</tt>). The order of the
<tt>install</tt> commands is important since we want to make sure that the
scripts to handle encrypted and/or LVM disks get installed in the
<tt>initrd</tt>. In case you already have the stock Debian kernel installed
you should run
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        update-initramfs -u
</pre>
<p> instead of the second step above. 
</p>

<p> Next, we partition the disk <tt>/dev/sda</tt> with a scheme like that above: 
</p>

<ul class="itemize">
<li class="li-itemize">
<tt>/dev/sda1</tt> a big enough partition to contain a copy of <tt>/boot</tt>. 
</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><tt>/dev/sda2</tt> is the rest. 
</li>
</ul>

<p> 
Next, create a regular ext2 file system on <tt>/dev/sda1</tt>.
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        mke2fs -L Boot /dev/sda1
</pre>

<p> We now setup the other partition as an encrypted LVM partition. 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        crypsetup luksFormat /dev/sda2 
</pre>

<p> This will ask for a passphrase which will be used to create a Linux
Unified Key Setup (LUKS) partition. The partition header of a LUKS
parition contains information on how the disk is to be decrypted using
a key that is generated using the passphrase.
</p>

<p> <em>
This passphrase is </em><em><b>very</b></em><em> important. If you forget
it you can forget about all the data in this partition. If you lose it and
someone else finds it they can get all the data in this partition.
</em>
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Writing it down on a Post-It note and sticking it to
your screen would make a useful reminder... or maybe saving a copy on that
newly-encrypted filesystem would be even better. :) If, for some silly
reason, you decide that you don't want to follow these time-honored
practices, then you might consider saving this password in several places
 - securely - to prevent loss. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p> Next, we get ready to use this partition with the command 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 backup
</pre>

<p> This creates <tt>/dev/mapper/backup</tt> as a block device containing
the unencrypted version of the partition. We will carve this up using
LVM2. The commands
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        pvcreate /dev/mapper/backup
        vgcreate vgb /dev/mapper/backup
</pre>

<p> create an LVM volume group called <tt>vgb</tt> which will contain the
various filesystems. Commands like
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        lvcreate -n root -L 3G vgb
        lvcreate -n swap -L 2G vgb
        lvcreate -n home -L 10G vgb
</pre>

<p> can be used to create the block devices <tt>/dev/vgb/root</tt>,
etc. These can be prepared as usual
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        mkswap -L Swap /dev/vgb/swap
        mke2fs -j -L Root /dev/vgb/root
        mke2fs -j -L Home /dev/vgb/home
</pre>

<h2 class="section">A Filling</h2>
<p> 
Well, most of you know the drill, but let me repeat it anyway. First
create the empty target tree with commands like
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        mkdir /tmp/target
        mount /dev/vgb/root /tmp/target
        mkdir /tmp/target/{boot,home}
        mount /dev/vgb/home /tmp/target/home
        mount /dev/sda1 /tmp/target/boot
</pre>
<p> Next, copy the files without looping, 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        find . -wholename '/tmp/target' -prune -o -print  | cpio -pdum /tmp/target 
</pre>
<p> &#X2026;and go find that cup of coffee with your name written on it. If
you are like Chance the gardener in <em>Being There</em> and &#X201C;like to
watch&#X201D;, then change the <tt>-pdum</tt> to <tt>-pdumv</tt>.
</p>

<p> Finally, just look through the directory <tt>/tmp/target</tt> and make
sure that you have copied everything properly. This completes the
encrypted backup of your system.
</p>

<h2 class="section">Making the Backup Bootable</h2>
<p> The first step is to install
<tt>grub</tt> into the boot record of <tt>/dev/sda</tt>
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        grub-install --root-directory /tmp/target /dev/sda
</pre>
<p> After this you <em>may</em> want to replace the <tt>device.map</tt> file created 
by <code>grub</code>
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        echo '(hd0) /dev/sda' &gt; /tmp/target/boot/grub/device.map
</pre>
<p> We also want the <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> to reflect the new filesystem structure 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        pushd /tmp/target/etc
        mv fstab fstab.orig
        cat &gt; fstab &lt;&lt;EOF
        LABEL=Root      /       ext3 defaults,errors=remount-ro 0 1
        LABEL=Swap      swap    swap defaults   0 0
        LABEL=Boot      /boot   ext2 defaults   0 1
        LABEL=Home      /home   ext3 defaults   0 2
        EOF
        popd
</pre>
<p> You may want to add the information on how this disk is encrypted 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        cat &gt;&gt; /tmp/target/etc/crypttab &lt;&lt;EOF
        backup  /dev/sda2       none    luks
        EOF
</pre>
<p> Finally, we need to create the boot instructions for <tt>grub</tt>. Begin
by editing the file <tt>/tmp/target/boot/grub/menu.lst</tt> at the line
that starts with <tt># kopt=</tt> and append to it so that the line
reads like
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        # kopt=ro root=/dev/mapper/vgb-root
           cryptopts=source=/dev/sda2,target=backup,lvm=vgb-root 
           rootdelay=10
</pre>
<p> This is all in <b>one</b> line and has been line wrapped for
readability. The <tt>rootdelay=10</tt> option gives 10 seconds for the
USB disk to be recognised by the Debian boot process; you may need
more (or less) time on your system.
</p>

<p> You may add options like <tt>vga=791</tt> to enable the default VESA
framebuffer and so on. Just remember to add these to the <b>same</b>
line.
</p>

<p> Then incorporate this changed configuration into the boot process
for <code>grub</code>
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        chroot /tmp/target update-grub
</pre>
<p> We now unmount the whole mess. 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        umount /tmp/target/home
        umount /tmp/target/boot
        umount /tmp/target
</pre>
<p> Then disable the LVM:
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        vgchange -an vgb
</pre>
<p> Remove the decrypted block device:
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        cryptsetup remove backup
</pre>
<p> Now, you can safely detach your external USB disk.
</p>

<p> And there you have an encrypted bootable backup. It is possible that
your laptop does not boot from USB hard disks. In that case you need
create a &#X201C;grub boot floppy&#X201D; if you want this backup to be bootable!
</p>

<h2 class="section">Keeping Up-to-Date</h2>
<p> 
This is rather easy using <tt>rsync</tt>. 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        apt-get install rsync
</pre>

<p> The command would then be something like 
</p>

<pre class="verbatim">        rsync -aW --exclude=/tmp/target \
          --exclude=/boot \
          --exclude=/etc/fstab \
          /. /tmp/target/.
</pre>

<p> You also need to re-run the <tt>grub-install</tt> command if you do not
exclude <code>/boot</code> from the backup. Just to avoid blaming your typing
finger you may want to create a script to mount the target, perform
the <tt>rsync</tt> and unmount the target.
</p>

<h2 class="section">And Repeat</h2>
<p> 
Of course, this still leaves you open to loss of identity information
if your laptop is stolen. So you just boot your newly created
encrypted bootable backup (you need to do that anyway to test it!) and
repeat the above steps with <code>/dev/sda</code> replaced with <code>/dev/hda</code>. You
might also want to replace labels like <code>backup</code> with <code>laptop</code> and
<code>vgb</code> with <code>vg</code> to avoid confusing yourself and your system. You
should probably skip the <tt>rootdelay</tt> option in this case since you
are booting from the internal disk.
</p>

<p> One advantage of converting to LVM is that you can take more
&#X201C;authentic&#X201D; backups by using &#X201C;snapshot&#X201D; images of your system
instead of doing a back up while the system is &#X201C;live&#X201D;.
</p>

<h2 class="section">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p> Clearly, many thanks go out to the guys
who wrote the software that makes all this work. In many cases the
source <b>is</b> part of the documentation and so it helps that it is
very readable.
</p>

<p> Thanks also go to the intrepid reader who actually tries out the
above steps. They worked for me, but just in case: &#X201C;Best of LUKS&#X201D;.

Kapil Hari Paranjape has been a ``hack''-er since his punch-card days.
Specifically, this means that he has never written a ``real'' program.
He has merely tinkered with programs written by others. After playing
with Minix in 1990-91 he thought of writing his first program---a
``genuine'' *nix kernel for the x86 class of machines. Luckily for him a
certain L. Torvalds got there first---thereby saving him the trouble
(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those
days---much to the dismay of many around him who think he should
concentrate on mathematical research---which is his paying job. The
interplay between actual running programs, what can be computed in
principle and what can be shown to exist continues to fascinate him.
