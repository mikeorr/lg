<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Hassan Ali</H4>
Hassan is a Ph.D. degree holder in numerical techniques
applied to electromagnetics from the University of Ottawa,
Canada. He is presently working with NORTEL NETWORKS in
Ottawa, Canada, as a specialist in software tools used to
predict signal integrity, and electromagnetic compatibility
(EMC) on printed circuit boards. Having been introduced to
Linux by a friend about 2 years ago, he has never stopped
having fun with it. Hassan loves to write about whatever
little he knows about for others to learn or to correct
him.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Larry Ayers</H4>
Larry lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Bill Bennet</H4>
Bill,
the ComputerHelperGuy, lives in Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada; the "Catfish
Capitol of North America" if not the world. He is on the Internet at
www.chguy.net. He tells us "I have been a PC user since 1983 when I got my start as a
Radio Shack manager. After five years in the trenches, I went into
business for myself. Now happily divorced from reality, I live next to my
Linux box and sell and support GPL distributions of all major Linux
flavours. I was a beta tester for the PC version of Playmaker Football and
I play `pentium-required' games on the i486. I want to help Linux become a
great success in the gaming world, since that will be how Linux will take
over the desktop from DOS." It is hard to believe that his five years of
university was only good for fostering creative writing skills.

persuing a B.S. in both Computer Science and Anthropology. He has been
involved with Linux since 1994 kernel?, and helped found the Triad Linux

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Paul Cooper</H4>
Paul is a Ph.D. student at the Mathematics Institute Warwick
university. To help finance his studies he also works in the dept.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Jurgen Defurne</H4>
Jurgen is an Analyst/programmer in financial company (Y2K and 
Euro).
He became interested in microprocessors 18 years ago, when my eyes saw 
the TRS-80 in the 
Tandy (Radio Shack) catalog.
I read all I could find about microprocessors, which was 
then mostly confined to 8080/8088/Z80. The only thing he could do back 
then was write 
programs in assembler without even having a computer.
When he was 18, he gathered enough money to buy his first computer, 
the Sinclair ZX 
Spectrum. He studied electronics and learned programming mostly
on his own. He worked with 
several languages (C, C++, xBase/Clipper, Cobol, FORTH) and several 
different systems in 
different areas: programming of test equipment, single- and 
multi-user databases in 
quality control and customer support, and PLCs in an aluminium 
foundry/milling factory.

new mirror sites.

With the Holidays, I took a week vacation to go back to Houston and visit
family and friends. I had a wonderful time. My grandchildren are smarter
and more beautiful each time I see them. I have a new <A

of Sarah and Rebecca on my home page.
<P> 
My best friend, Benegene, had arranged for a get together with three
friends from our university (Baylor) days. We had a lot of fun catching up
and talking about old times. It was amazing how different the memories were
that stood out in each of our minds. Only goes to prove that what one
person finds remarkable may be quite "ho hum" to the next. Ah well, it was
a good evening and one I hope will be repeated.
<P> 
Have fun!
