Hi Guys,
</p>

<p>
I was finally able to do the compilation process. Thanks for the help. 
</p>

<p>
Another question:
</p>

<p>
1. I am using a tcpdump network sniffer to capture packets of the tcp
header. I wanted to analyze  a specific variable like smoothed rtt
(srtt). I already changed the header file to include this new srtt
variable into  the option side of the tcp.h header file and also change
the tcp_input.c source code to incorporate the said variable into the
options side. I am confused whether tcp_input.c is the  correct code to
change since tcp_output.c and tcp.c is also in the linux kernel code. I
am also confused how to output this new srtt variable into the tcp
header so as to be captured by the tcpdump and be seen in the
tracefiles.
</p>

<p>
Is there a specific function in the code to be manipulated to do the
task? Any help would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much in advance.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
</p>

<p>
Dom

The TCP state machine is quite a complex piece of code, so you should
take a look at the packet flow. The documentation is a bit scarce. While
preparing my article for LG #135 I found
<a href="http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/tcp_output.html">http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/tcp_output.html</a> and the links at
<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:TCP">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:TCP</a> to be useful.
</p>

<p>
I don't think you can add the srtt variable to the TCP header. The
header has not field for this information left. The best way to capture
this is to watch sender and receiver by using kprobes
(<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:TcpProbe">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/Net:TcpProbe</a> shows you an example) or
by use the getsockopt() call I used in the example code of my articles.
If you find another way, I'd like to know about it.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.
