Re: font sizes + points, Linux Gazette #26
     
     I had a similar problem with an old Deskjet under SunOS and was 
     supplied with the following info by HP support Europe. It applies to 
     DOS but should be applicable to any Un*x system as well
     
     These are printer instruction generation wizards URLs
     <ul>
     <li>FOR PCL3 got to (DeskJets):
     http://www.hp.com/cpso-support/deskjet/tools/pcl3.html
     
     <li>FOR PCL5 got to (LaserJets):
     http://www.hp.com/cpso-support/PrinterLanguage/pclwiz.html
     
     <li>FOR PJL go to (printer job language - like a batch language):
     http://www.hp.com/cpso-support/PrinterLanguage/pjlwiz.html
     
     <li>Try checking entries on Horizontal Motion Index and Vertical Motion 
     Index (HMI + VMI) - that might be what you want.
     </ul>
     I saw a posting in C.O.L.A. a few months back that someone has 
     already done the tough work and has programmed some mostly-complete 
     PCL 3+ 5 drivers for Linux
     
     If all else fails, HP DOS drivers exist that can customise point sizes 
     + fonts and save them permanently to printer memory (5Si's do, i don't 
     know about 4Ls) If you don't have a DOS partition maybe DOSEMU?
     
     Good Luck!<BR>

2c tip (StarOffice 4 / Ghostscript)
</H3><P> 
Date: Mon, 2 Mar 1998 18:48:51 -0500 (EST)<BR> 
From: Fraser McCrossan, <A
HREF="mailto:fraserm@gtn.net">fraserm@gtn.net</A>  
<P>
I've just started using the excellent Star Office 4.0 (free for personal
use - go get it now!), but have noticed that when using Ghostscript to
filter its print output on my non-Postscript printer, the results
were not quite as they appeared on the screen. 
<P>
I reasoned that this might be because the fonts supplied with SO didn't
quite match those supplied with Ghostscript. However, the SO fonts are
Type 1 Postscript fonts... which Ghostscript can use. To make Ghostscript
use them, you need to link them to its home directory. For example, if
your SO is installed in /home/fraser/Office40, change to the Ghostscript
font (normally /usr/local/share/ghostscript/fonts) directory, and do the
following: 
<PRE> 
ln -s /home/fraser/Office40/fonts/type1/*.pf[ab] .
mv Fontmap Fontmap.hide
</PRE> 
For some reason, when I tried to add the new fonts to Fontmap in the same
format as the existing fonts, GS would crash, hence hiding it. I'm not a
GS guru... perhaps someone else can explain why. However, GS works just
fine without Fontmap for me, although it probably takes longer to start
up - and everything I print looks just like the screen.

The March issue of the Gazette includes the following under 2 Cent Tips:
&lt;&lt;I have just purchased a MicroVAX 3400 and 3300. I would like to put
&lt;&lt;Linux on these two systems. Can you provide any help in this aspect. 
<P>
&lt;I believe those are MIPS 3000 boxes, try the Linux VAX Port Homepage at >http://ucnet.canberra.edu.au/~mikal/vaxlinux/home.html
&lt;and the Linux/MIPS project at http://lena.fnet.fr/ 
<P>
Anything with "VAX" in its name is just that -- a VAX.  Digital made
MIPS boxes once upon a time, but they never used the VAX/MicroVAX
name.  Most of Digital's MIPS boxes were sold under the DECstation or
DECsystem name.
<P>
The pointer to the VAX/Linux effort is the best one I know about, but
the whole VAX/Linux project was not even close to producing usable code
last time I checked.  NetBSD, if it works on these boxes, may be your
best bet.

I'm interested in installing linux on a machine I built recently, but when I 
installed Win95(b), I idiotically opted to
format the drive using FAT32, which in a 95-only environment is great, but 
Linux can't read it for greek. 
I've looked around for utilities to effectively un-FAT32 the drive, which I 
will then partition with Partition Magic to
use the freespace as a native ext2 partition, etc., but am having little luck.
Reformating is a disheartening prospect
I would rather not face, but am fully prepared  to do so if I don't find any 
help here.   --nate daiger</blockquote> 
<P>
Well partition magic 3 can repartition fat32 without hassle, and there exists 
a patch for linux kernel to understand fat32 at
http://bmrc.berkeley.edu/people/chaffee/fat32.html
which also lists a version of fips which also should understand fat32, to
resize your drive.

Regarding "Easter Eggs" in Netscape etc.
</H3><P> 
Date: Thu, 5 Mar 1998 23:21:20 +0000 (GMT)<BR> 
From: John Pelan, <A
HREF="mailto:johnp@am.qub.ac.uk">johnp@am.qub.ac.uk</A> 
<P>
The on-going 2 cent tips about the hidden "Easter Eggs" in Netscape is
interesting. However rather than continually listing them it might be more
fruitful to learn how one can try to discover them for oneself. 
<P>
One useful tool in particular, is the oft neglected 'strings' command. 
This will locate printable strings in an arbitrary file and display them. 
So one can do something like;
<PRE> 
prompt% strings /usr/lib/netscape/netscape-navigator
</PRE> 
which will reveal all the embedded strings in that binary. You might like
to redirect the output to a file for analysis. As many of the strings will
be rubbish (i.e. 'random' sequences of printable characters) one can
always use grep, awk, Perl etc. to help filter in/out particular patterns.
<P>
In the case of Netscape, only a tiny set of the strings will correspond to
"Easter Eggs" (not all of them will be immediately obvious either) and
locating them is left as an exercise to the reader...

<li>Changing XDM windows: Check out

   a replacement (This version comes with pam support). This
   version runs fine on our Redhat systems (Intel & PPC).
<P>
<li>New direction: Linux is beeing ported to the PPC chip. See
   http://www.linuxppc.org for more info, downloads CD's  T-shirts....
   It actually runs quite stable on my PPC.

<P>
According to the Sound-HOWTO:<BR> 
"MV Jaz16 and ESS688/1688 based cards generally work with the 
 SoundBlaster driver"
<P>
To get a PnP card to work, you need to configure it first. There are two
ways of doing that:
<ol>
<li>boot into DOS, use the card's DOS-based initialization program, then do
a warm boot to Linux
<P>
<li>compile sound support as a module, and use isapnp from the isapnptools
package to initialize the card, after which you can insert the sound
module.
</ol>
The isapnptools package can be found at

I have shamelessly stolen this from USENET, because I feel this excellent

Hopefully you won't need this, but if you ever want to display X on a big
screen and a TV is the only big screen around you might want to use this.
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
A TV with a RGB SCART input is nothing more than a fixed sync monitor with
a rather low picture quality. This means that you can make a TV compatible
signal with a plain vanilla cheapo VGA card.
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
For the european 625 line (575 visable lines) TV standard a modeline looks
like this:
Modeline "736x575i" 14.16 736 760 824 904 575 580 585 625 interlace -hsync -vsync
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
Officially the horizontal resolution is 767 (4 / 3 * 575) pixels with a
clock of 14.76 MHz. However, since the clock used is 14.16 MHz, I reduced
the horizontal values proportional to 14.16 / 14.76 (and rounded them to
the nearest multiple of 8).
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
If you want to make a 640x480 screen with a black border you can you use 
this line:
Modeline "640x480i" 14.16 640 712 776 904 480 532 537 625 interlace -hsync -vsync
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
You can center it by altering the 2nd and 3rd horizontal and vertical
values (this example shifts the picture to the left):
Modeline "640x480i" 14.16 640 728 792 904 480 532 537 625 interlace -hsync -vsync
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
You can make a non interlaced signal with this modeline:
Modeline "736x288" 14.16 736 760 824 904 288 290 292 312 -hsync -vsync
</blockquote> <P> <blockquote> 
The VGA RGB signals are compatible with the scart bus, the sync signals
are not. You have to create a composit sync signal of 0.3 ... 0.5 Vpp.
The cirquit below acts both as a AND gate and a level translator.
It doesn't need a power supply and can be mounted inside a VGA plug:

<P>
I noticed that many people still login as root before they power
down their system in order to run the command 'shutdown -h now'.
This is really not necessary and it may cause problems if everybody 
working on a machine knows the root password.
<P>
Most Linux distributions are configured to reboot if ctrl-alt-delete
is pressed, but this can be changed to run 'shutdown -h now'.
Edit your /etc/inittab and change the line that starts with ca:
<PRE> 
# Trap CTRL-ALT-DELETE
# original line would reboot:
#ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now
# now halt the system after shutdown:
ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -h now
#

Now you can just press crtl-alt-delete as normal user and your system 
comes down clean and halts.

    My guess is that the default Caldera kernel does not have multiple
CPU's enabled.  You will probably have to recompile your kernel to
enable SMP.  Some kernel versions (even the 2.0.xx) are less stable for
SMP than others, unfortunately I can't give you any help on which
version to choose.  However, you may want to join the Linux-SMP mailing
list, email majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the text 'subscribe
linux-smp' to join the list.  An archive is maintained at  Linux HQ
(http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists/linux-smp/), so you may want to look
there first before you ask on the mailing list. The May 1997 Caldera
newsletter has the following information (a little out of date):
<P>
Linux?  When will
      SMP be fully supported?
<P>
      The Linux 2.x kernel with full SMP support is currently in beta,
and will most likely
      be included in the next stable release of the kernel.  The Linux
2.0.25 and 2.0.29
      kernels which ship in OpenLinux 1.0 and 1.1 products can reside
and are tolerant of an
      SMP environment, but will not perform load balancing.
<P>
To enable SMP, the OpenLinux 1.2 FAQ
(http://www.caldera.com/tech-ref/col-1.2/faq/faq-5.html)  has the
following suggestions:
<P>
5.4 How to enable SMP (multiple processor) support: <BR> 
            To enable SMP (multiple processor) support in OpenLinux, you
must do three things:
<ol>
               <li>Go to "/usr/src/linux" and uncomment the "SMP = 1"
line in the Makefile (to
                   uncomment this line, remove the preceeding "#").
               <li>Follow the instructions in Rebuilding the Linux Kernel
for Caldera OpenLinux 1.2
(http://www.caldera.com/tech-ref/docs/COL12-Kernel-Rebuild.html) 
and during the  'make config' step be sure to enable
"Real-time clock support". Then
                  recompile your kernel using the remainder of the
steps.
               <li>Reboot your system.
</ol>
            Currently there is no method for monitoring how much of each
processor is being used, but if you run the "top" utility you will most
likely see processes that are using more than 100% of a processor;
whatever is above the 100% mark is being done with the other processors.
Also, to determine if both processors have been detected and are in use,
you can cat the "/proc/cpuinfo" file for a report of what processors are
recognized by Linux; if there's more than one listed, you are running
with SMP support.
<P>
    Some sources for information on SMP are:<BR> 
<P>
http://www.caldera.com/LDP/HOWTO/Parallel-Processing-HOWTO-2.html<BR> 
    (or any other LDP site)<BR> 
http://www.linux.org.uk/SMP/title.html <BR> 
http://www.uruk.org/~erich/mps-linux-status.html <BR> 
     (These pages haven't been updated in a while)
<P>
If after reading the above information, you still have questions, you
might email Caldera's technical support (assuming you purchased your
distribution from them and registered it.)  I have had good luck with
their technical support, but read the FAQ's first.
<P>
BTW: I found most of the above information by going to Caldera's web
page and typing SMP in the search box.  Thanks Caldera for the web site.

<P>
About the problem of `locate' (2c tip #2 LG #26) showing files that
normal users can't access: If this happens, it is not a bug with
`locate' but rather with the Linux distribution (or the way locate and
friends have been installed by hand). `Locate' should be allowed to
print any and all matching file that are in the database it is pointed
to. However, in the case of the database for general system, it is a
security bug (IMO) if the database includes non-world-readable
files. Here is were the problem lies.
<P>
Debian Linux handles this by running `updatedb' (the program which
actually makes the `locate' data base) from /etc/cron.daily/find via:
	<PRE> 
	cd / && updatedb --localuser=nobody 2>/dev/null
</PRE> 
This is also a tad easier than patching/recompiling.
Anyways, there is my 2cents.

<P>
(This is in response to the article posted in General Mail, Linux
Gazette, Issue 26, March 1998.)
<P>
Although I can't speak for developers "that have Gobs of money for good
video boards and [humongous] monitors," I can share a few things with
you about my experiences with XFree86.  I have run it successfully with
on a 14 inch monitor, using the standard SVGA X server on a 486-75MHz
with a Cirrus video card.  It took quite a bit of fiddling, but I
eventually figured out how to get it to run in 800x600 mode, and then in
1024x768 interlaced.
<P>
A lot of it was just meddling with the XFree86 configuration file
directly, hoping that I wouldn't blow my monitor up.  There are tools
today (like Metro-X) that make this process a fair bit easier.
<P>
One thing you might not realize is that the XFree86 config (last I
remember) sometimes chooses 640x480 mode on startup, when it actually
supports more modes.  Try pressing Ctrl-Alt-Keypad+ to change the
resolution while running X.
<P>
Monitor size is another matter.  I recall one application that liked to
size itself bigger than my screen.  There are a couple ways around this.
<P>
The first is the -geometry flag, available to most X applications.  If
you want to try it, the xterm, xeyes, and xbiff programs all support it.
The most basic format is:
<PRE> 
-geometry =&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;x&gt;+&lt;y&gt:
</PRE> 
Replace &lt;width&gt; and &lt;height&gt; with the desired width and height
of the
window, respectively.  Sometimes width and height refer to characters,
and sometimes they refer to pixels.  Your mileage may vary.  &lt;x&gt; and
&lt;y&gt;
refer to the pixel coordinates of the new window's upper left corner. 
If you want, you can leave out the first half (default size) or the
second half (default location).  Sometimes you can leave off the equals
sign, too.
<P>
Some examples:  "-geometry 800x600+0+0" will place an 800x600 window in
the upper left corner of the screen.  "-geometry 400x300+200+150" will
place a 400x300 window in the center of an 800x600 display.
<P>
You can write shell aliases to run these programs with a default size.
A cleaner way is to put geometry specifications in your .Xresources
file.  Usually this is of the form
&lt;programName&gt;*geometry:
&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;x&gt;+&lt;y&gt;
<P>
Here are some examples:
<PRE>
XEyes*geometry:                 +1060+40
plan*geometry:         +10+10
Netscape.Navigator.geometry: =336x425
Netscape.Mail.geometry: =300x400
Netscape.News.geometry: =300x400
Netscape.Composition.geometry: =350x350
</PRE>
You may also want to adjust the fonts for your program, especially if it
doesn't support the -geometry flag nor X resource.
<P>
I, too, feel that Linux is not ready for the public because of its
comparatively steeper learning curve.  But it's gotten a lot better over
the years, thanks to the Linux community.  Keep up the good work,
everyone!

My 2-cents on W95/Linux coexistence
</H3><P> 
Date: Tue, 17 Mar 1998 17:56:16 -0500<BR> 
From: Carl Helmers, <A HREF="mailto:carl@helmers.com">

<P>
Re W95 and Linux:  With hard disks crashing in price (hopefully not the
heads), here is the strategy I used for this problem of getting W95 and
Linux on the same machine at the end of 1997:  On one of my personal
desktop machines, I had excellent results using a product called "System
Commander" -- this product has a Linux-savvy manual which explains all
the details one needs.  The machine in question is a generic Pentium-133
with 32mb memory, a 2GB EIDE drive and a S3 Virge based graphic card.
After I got the machine in 1997 I added a removable 2GB EIDE drive in a
DataPort drive frame/cartridge setup for testing various Linux versions,
keeping the original W95 that came with the machine in the first drive.
<P>
Once I installed System Commander I set up the default boot choice on
the P133 desktop machine to be (of  course) Linux on the second hard
drive, where I currently have X installed.  I use this machine (running
Emacs and a bunch of handy macros) to keep my update log while
installing new Linices on my other machines (a Dell Latitude LM Laptop
[P133 40mb] with an alternate 2GB hard drive for Linux, and a  Cyrix
6X86-166 clone on the desktop next to the P133.
<P>
My first attempt at a W95/Linux combination was on that Cyrix clone --
whose W95 seems to have re-written the fundamental hard disk sector map
of the second (but different model number, same capacity) Western
Digital drive on which I installed Linux through getting a working X
display -- before closing down and rebooting with LILO.  After that
disaster, I just said the heck with W95 and reformatted the 2GB hard
disk as the primary Linux disk, with the second disk in its DataPort
removable frame retained as an additional file storage region.  In my 30
years of using computers since high school in 1966,  I have developed
the habit of always keeping a detailed log when doing anything I might
want to reproduce -- such as installing a Linux release.  That way,  if
I make a mistake I can try again, changing some critical detail or
other. I started the habit with pencil and spiral paper notebooks.
These days, I use a second computer system sitting on the same desktop
running emacs under XFree86 with my custom macros to speed up entry --
but the principle is the same.
<P>
In the System Commander desktop machine,  I set W95 as a second boot
option, and the third option for  booting from floppy using the Linux
installation boot diskettes.  I still useW95 [perish the thought] for
one or two commercial Wintel programs I like which do not have a Linux
work-alike, and to try out new software packages.

2-cent tips in LG 26: core dumps (Marty Leisner)

<P>
I was annoyed by "file", too.  Under several other unices
"file" can be used to identify a core dump.  Marty's tip is
just fine.  You don't have to write any script or other stuff.
<P>
I used "gdb" to find out where a "core"-file came from.  As
a wrapper around it, I wrote "idcore".  It has
the advantage of displaying only relevant information, i.e.,
the name of the binary causing the core-dump.  This way it
can by used, e.g., in cron jobs to notify users.
The verbosity of idcore is controlled with the
<PRE> 
	--brief
</PRE> 
and
<PRE> 
	--long
</PRE> 
options.
<P>
I'd like to paste some sample output here, but neither can I

use in a similar way.
I have a user called 'info' and he has a .forward file consisting of the

Note that there is no warranty - it works for me, but that's all I can

(it never calls 'exec', so it's unlikely a cracker can subvert it on
your machine - and it's certainly no more dangerous than a shell script
run by cron).

Recently I hacked together a little shell script for some friends of mine
that I thought others might find of interest. It allows you to run rxvt
with a random pixmap put in the background. The random pixmap is taken
from a directory, thus no hard coding of pixmap names in the shell script. 
<P>
Well, here it is... oh, this is using bash btw...
<PRE> 
----start----
#!/bin/sh
run_rxvt ()
{
        shift $((RANDOM%$#))
        exec rxvt -pixmap ~/.pixmaps/$1

Tiny patch to ifconfig

<P>
I've often wondered just how much data I've transmitted through my
network.  After a little research, I found that the ifconfig program
just simply does not display this bit of information in it's results. 
So, I've fixed that problem.
<P>
To install, first get the sources from your favorite sunsite mirror. 
The file to look for is net-tools-1.432.tar.gz.  I found it at
ftp://ftp.cc.gatech.edu/pub/linux/distributions/slackware/source/n/tcpip/net-tools-1.432.tar.gz
<P>
Unpack those sources, apply the patch with patch < ifconfig.diff, and
compile.  I only modify the ifconfig program, so just simply backup your
existing binary, then install the newly compiled one (assuming you
already have this version of net-tools installed).  Here is an example
of the new output:

In the process of getting a System installed I upgraded from the
original CD-ROM install of (Intel) RedHat 4.2 to the new RedHat 5.0
CD-ROM.  One of the significant items on this system is the mars-nwe
Netware emulator.
Under the RedHat 4.2 with mars-nwe 0.98pl8-1 the mars package ran fine,
but logged copious errors about there being "too many connections --
increase the number in config.h".  But it ran, and I *liked* the way it
happily did Netware duties!  (Especially the printer part.)
The *new* RedHat 5.0 with mars-nwe 0.99pl2-1 offered some very desirable
abilities, not the least of which is the move of some items (such as
number of connections) to the run-time config file (/etc/nwserv.conf
under RedHat, probably nw.ini on other distributions.)  Now the bad
news...<BR> 
...[snip]...<BR> 
This new package spawns out nwconn processes with an empty parenthesis
as the last token instead of the USERID ('nwconn ... ()') until all
connection slots are eaten, and then, of course, will not recognize any
new attempts.  Any users already logged into the nwserv(ice) are Ok.<BR> 
...[snip]...<BR> 
I have tried every combination of parameter twiddling in the run-time
config file that can think of, but to no avail.<BR>
...[snip]...<BR> 
Anyone who has solved this problem, please share the secret.
</PRE>
BTW:  I had regularly pulled in updates to everything from RedHat
errata.  I was getting a bit gun shy about updating, because that's how
I got into the mess.  :-)  I had previously tried the "..pl2-3.rpm" when
it first appeared, but it died immediatly on startup so I went back to
the "..pl2-1.rpm" build which, at least, would run in spite of all the
problems I was having with it.
<P>
The breakthrough was inspired by a note I got when
On Mon, 02 Mar 1998 12:24:37 +0100, Trond Eivind Glomsrd wrote:
"Last: You have installed all items from the errata? The glibc updates
fixes a lot of bugs, at least."
<P>
So I made one more trip to the RH errata repository, and got the
absolute latest updates.  There did happen to be a newer update of that
glibc which Tron had mentioned.
<P>
I applied the glibc updates and installed the mars-nwe 0.99pl2-3, and
this all seems to have fixed everything.  Mars runs, and all the ugly
hangups and problems appear to be gone!   It's a thing of beauty.
<P>
For those keeping score, here are the package levels which are
significant to running the mars-nwe on my RH 5.0 System:
<PRE> 
    kernel-2.0.32-2
    mars-nwe-0.99pl2-3
    glibc-2.0.6-9 
</PRE> 
It appears that the mixture of levels I had prior to this set just
did not synch up, and I suspect the the fix must have been in the new
glibc as Tron suggested it might be.
<P>
What a relief!

I thought this was a good idea, so I tried to do it.  Eventually, I

In the March issue, you have a tip on using X programs when you've run
su to root.  By far the easiest method is to simply
<PRE> 
setenv XAUTHORITY ~khera/.Xauthority
</PRE> 
for your own user name, of course...  No need to run any other programs
or cut and paste anything.
<P>
I have my machines configured so that when someone becomes root, if the
file ~/.rootrc exists in their home directory, it is sourced as part of
the root's .cshrc file.  In there, I put the above setenv command.  I've
never had to think about it again (in nearly 5 years).
<P>
Hope this helps someone.

locate patch

In the Linux Gazette number 26 (march) there was mention of a patch
for locate. The idea of the patch was to make it impossible to find
out the names of files in directories that you do not have access to.
<P>
Unfortunately this patch does not solve the problem at all. So I would
advise people not to use this patch, they could be lured into a false
sense of privacy. What is the problem and what is wrong with the
patch?
<P>
Locate allows you to find a file quickly. It does this by consulting a
database of filenames. Of course this way of finding a file is much
quicker then hunting for it in the file system. However, somebody has
to make the database. This is done with the program updatdb, usually
from a crontab every day or week. Updatdb can find all files that the
user id, it is running as, has access to. So if updatedb is run with
an id that has more access rights then the user who invokes the locate
command, this user can find out the names of files that he/she
otherwise could not find. The author of the locate patch solved the
problem simply by changing the locate command. Just before sending the
name of a file, it checks whether it exists and if so whether the
invoking user has read access. However you don't need to use the
locate command at all to read the file database. To make sure every
user, who invokes locate, can read it it is stored world readable. The
patch does not help at all to solve the privacy problem.
<P>
For the moment, if you are concerned about these privacy issues, you
should not run 'updatedb' at all, and remove the existing database.
Since locate & Co. are very handy utilities it is probably best to
leave things as they are and make sure updatedb is run by user nobody
from a crontab.
<P>
The next easiest solution would be to make the database created by
updatedb readable by root only, and change locate to a setuid program
which consults the database as root and checks for permissions. I
will leave that as a challenge to the author of the patch.
<P>
Happy Linuxing.<BR>

in a large directory of files it is sometimes hard to locate the
subdirectories. to do this you can tag the directories with a '/'
(using ls -F) and then grep these out...
<PRE> 
ls -F |grep /$
</PRE> 
or even better..
<PRE> 
alias sub="ls -F |grep /$"
