<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">JC Pollman</H4>
I have been playing with linux since kernel 1.0.59. I spend way too much
time at the keyboard and even let my day job - the military - interfere once in
a while. My biggest concern about linux is the lack of documentation for the
intermediate user. There is already too much beginner's stuff, and the
professional material is often beyond the new enthusiast.

<P>

<P> This month's <I>Gazette</I> is again chock-full of articles --- 19 of them,
not counting the regular columns.  Way to go, authors!
New features this month include the subject index for the Answer Guy, and a
new series.  Slambo has begun a series of web site reviews called "LSOTM (Linux
Site O' The Month)".

<P> Professor A Cartelli wrote in about his Italian translation of the
<I>Gazette</I>, so I took the opportunity to ask how long it takes to do the
translation and how many people are involved.  He said, "Too much time, not
enough people. We are usually one month late after your magazine. It usually
takes 6-10 people."

<P> The <I>Gazette</I> received 389 letters this month.  Of these, 104 were
spam.  The <STRONG><I>Linux Gazette</I> Spam Count </STRONG> for November is
therefore 26%, down 2% from last month.

<P> Here are excerpts from the more hilarious ads:
<UL>
	<LI> "The information in this message is private and confidential and
is intended for the addressed recipient only....  Dear fellow investor,"
Yeah, right.  "Private &amp; confidential".<P>
	<LI> Another "accidentally redirected" e-mail: "Hi George  it's Steve.
I don't know why are you changing your e-mail adress so often ,but I hardly
keep track of your adress. I finished my site .  You said you want  to earn
some money easy way,and you can download that  funny gift photo I toled you
about ."<P>
	<LI> "I net over $400 my FIRST DAY selling the most sought
after product in the world.  As a bonus for joining, I will give you info on a $275 free
electricity self contained unit that doesn't even need batteries.
It will run everything in your house when the power goes out.
You will never have an electric bill again...  to get
fresh water right out of the ocean (with no operating costs to
make it); heat paint to keep snow and ice off the driveway;
cooling without using a refrigerant; a mug that converts junk
food into food that is good for you; a pocket device found
to protect people from all major: diseases, toxins, chemicals
and pesticides; and even more.."  Sounds like ubik, the reality-enhancing
spray/ointment/salve in Philip K Dick's novel <I>Ubik</I>.<P>
	<LI> "Look, we don't want to waste your time...or ours You must be
determined to earn a bare minimum of $10,000 in the next 30 - 45 days and to
develop a net worth of over 1 Million Dollars Cash in the next  24-36 months...
Don't bother to call unless you are serious."<P>
	<LI> "TRIPPLE THE SPEED ON YOUR PC !"  The web site allows you to order
by credit card (of course).  Price is US$299.00, but if you order before it's
released November 15, it's a special $19.99.  There's just one thing missing from the ad and the web site:
<EM>what <STRONG>is</STRONG> this product?</EM>  Software?  Hardware?  Is it
Linux-compatible?  Whatever it is, it comes with a 100% guarantee and the
promise, "The program will not change anything on your PC apar from increasing
the speed on your PC by 300%."  And cows can fly, I bet.<P>
</UL>





<P> This edition of the <I>Linux Gazette</I> was brought to you by the Dropkick
Murphys, Anti-Flag, H20, and Punk-O-Rama 4, which were playing in my walkman
continuously as I formatted the columns and the Table of Contents.
