<P> Ottawa, Ontario - January 18, 2000 - Corel Corporation  today announced it
has entered into an agreement to acquire up to a 30 per cent stake in
OE/ONE.com, a start-up company developing an "Information Appliance" platform
or thin-client Internet Appliance platform.

<P> Founded by former Corel executive Eid Eid this past year, OE/ONE.com has
developed a software tool kit, specifications and an industrial design for
the product, and is currently working with OEMs - including Tier One
consumer electronics manufacturers - to develop the appliance, expected to
hit the market in the sub-US $500 range.

<P> Corel will assist OE/ONE.com in implementing many Corel® LINUX® features
with the OE/ONE.com software. By leveraging what Corel has done with the
File Manager, Browser, Control Center and GUI (graphical user interface),
OE/ONE.com can bring ease-of-use at the screen and display level to the
Information Appliance while running on Linux's stability and performance. At
the same time, Corel will develop a scaled-down version of the Corel LINUX
OS optimized for specific devices and applications.

<P> Corel has also released WordPerfect Office 2000 Beta for Linux
on its online beta testing sites.

</H3> 


<P> San Francisco, CA - January 4, 2000 - SuSE is announcing the availability
of a beta-quality version of SuSE Linux 6.3 for the Macintosh PowerPC at
MacWorld in San Francisco. The sales release of SuSE Linux for Power PC is
planned for this spring. Offering SuSE Linux on PowerPC supports SuSE's
strategy of cross-platform availability.

<P> Nuremberg, 17th January 2000 -- SuSE Linux AG, one of the leading Linux
specialists worldwide, is continuing to expand its support services. The
opening of a new support center in Bremen is directly connected to the
worldwide success of SuSE Linux AG's existing support services. The
declared aim of SuSE Linux AG is to continue with this success, and to
meet the continually growing demand in the area of support services for
Linux.
The Support Center in Bremen will begin operating on February 15, 2000.

<P> Langenhagen/Nuremberg, Germany - 19 January 2000 - SuSE has teamed up
with Minolta to facilitate printer support. The resultant benefits are
significant. Linux users can now enjoy high-quality output from the
Minolta PagePro 8, 18 and 25 monochrome laser printers. The recently
launched Version 6.3 of SuSE Linux features a driver utility that also
includes installation support for the PagePro 8, 18 and 25 printers. In
practical terms, this means that these Minolta printers will be visible
and selectable in the Linux user's windows and functions such as paper
trays, mail bins, etc., will also be easily selectable - an important
consideration for printers with hundreds of individually customizable
configurations. Another practical advantage is that Minolta has just
launched an extended version of its network management utility, PageScope,
to make life easier for Linux network administrators.

<P> Transmeta, the company that employs Linus Torvalds, has finally let the
world in on what it has been working on.  On January 19, Transmeta announced
a line of Crusoe CPUs.  These chips utilize Code Morphing (TM) software to
emulate other CPUs (most notably, Intel x86)--this is the part Linus was
working on.  

<P> Transmeta is also creating a Linux distribution called Mobile Linux for
computers without hard disks, with enhancements in the areas of power
management and efficient memory use.  The distribution will not be sold to
the public, however.  Instead, it will be offered to OEMs so that they can
have an operating system to go with their new chip.  Transmeta promises to
release Mobile Linux as open-source software.

<FONT COLOR="green">Linux curriculum begins today in Utah Public Schools
</FONT>
</H3> 

<H4>DATC press release--</H4>

<P> I am proud to announce what I believe to be the first ever Linux-based
class to be held in any public school.  Today begins the start of Linux'
inroads into the mainstream educational arena here at the Davis Applied
Technology Center (http://www.datc.tec.ut.us) .

<P> The class itself, Introduction to GNU/Linux, is a course designed for
people who have had some experience in computers, but do not know what
Linux is, or how it operates. It does require some hands-on experience
with computers, but only to make sure that students understand basic
hardware and software concepts.  It is also the fruit of a survey
question asked of the Linux community in October's issue of the Linux
Gazette (http://www.linuxgazette.com/)

<P> This coursework (version 0.99) is currently in the process of gaining
distribution approval by the Utah Attorney General's office, so that it
can be posted in whole to the Linux Documentation Project. (This is
because the State of Utah holds the ultimate copyright - I forsee no
problems in gaining approval, however.) Once the curriculum is posted,
it will be distributed under the auspices of Open Documentation, which
means that it can be distributed and used much like Open Sourced
software. A full declaration and conditions sheet is included in the
document concerning the use and distribution of this curriculum.

<P> The curriculum can be used as a self-paced/self-study guide (as is our
normal mode of classwork here at DATC) or you can just as easily use it
as an instructor's guide on the secondary educational level. I would
also encourage those teaching undergrad-level college or technical
courses to make full use of this document, once it is posted on the LDP.

<P> I actively encourage all public school instructors to use this guide,
and especially encourage all interested parties (be they teachers,
students, or simply IT sysadmins) to feel more than free to mail me with
constructive criticisms, suggestions for addition to this coursework, or
even technical corrections. (Although I have tested all of the labs and
coursework here, there may be some things I still may have missed.)  Any
questions about the course in general can be directed to me at
tjmiller@datc.tec.ut.us As an aside, I am also actively working to add
Sair Inc. Linux certification (http://www.linuxcertification.com) to the
list of courses as well, since DATC also offers Novell, Cisco, and
Microsoft MCP/MCSE courses.

<P> My goal in writing this curriculum is simple: To bring Linux out of the
back offices and hobbyists' desktops, and into the minds (and the
hearts) of IT's future - the Comp Sci students of today. I find that the
schools are where students discover and incorporate their loves and
hates of the computer industry, and the sooner they can get started on
learning the mysteries of Linux, the greater the benefits to the
GNU/Linux movement in general.

http://forums.oreilly.com/~publishing</A>

<P>   The groundswell of Open Source, or free software, technologies has
  created a sea change in commercial book publishing. Several
  publishers, including O'Reilly &amp; Associates, have started offering
  books under various open-content licenses so that they can be freely
  displayed on Internet sites, distributed with software on CD-ROMs,
  taken apart to be used for course handouts, and in some cases
  printed by other people besides the original publisher. As
  revolutionary for the publishing industry as this distribution
  mechanism is, some projects go even further to work directly with
  the developers of Open Source projects. We are likely to see the
  integration of professionally edited and produced documentation into
  the model of Open Source development over the next few years.

<P>   Having recently finished one project myself under an open-content
  license -- Using Samba -- and having started work on several other
  such projects, I'd like to invite all interested persons to a
  discussion on how the Open Source community and professional
  publishers can

<P>   1. Involve developers of open source software more directly in the
     development of high-quality guides and other
     professionally-edited content.

<P>   2. Find the development models for open documents that work well
     with the successful models used for open-source software.

<P>   There are many angles to consider -- quality control, Internet-time
  release schedules, the big-picture thinking required to keep the
  book's balance and structure strong during updates, risks and
  benefits of forking, adequate compensation for writers and
  publishers, dealing with the natural tendency to want to hide work
  in progress with competitive publishers -- so take your pick and
  give us a thoughtful post!

<P> 	ST. LOUIS, January 11, 2000--
Wave Technologies International, Inc. 
(<A HREF="http://www.wavetech.com">www.wavetech.com</A>),
has acquired Sair, Inc. (<A
HREF="http://www.linuxcertification.com">www.linuxcertification.com</A>). Sair
develops comprehensive vendor-neutral Linux training materials and is the
architect of  the Sair Linux &amp; GNU Certification and its associated exams.
Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

<P> Wave intends to continue a separate Sair Linux &amp; GNU subsidiary that will
promote and market  Linux training and certification programs.  The combined
organizations will pursue four major strategic initiatives consisting of:

<P> 1. Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) sales of training materials. The companies have disclosed existing development agreements with Compaq, Linuxcare, Caldera(r) and others.  

<P> 2. Certification Exams.  Wave's strategic focus has been on IT
certification, and Wave plans to support and continue to expand its
certification programs including boot camps currently delivered for individuals
pursuing the Linux Professional Institute certification,  the Red Hat(
Certified Engineer designation and the Sair Linux &amp; GNU Certification.

<P> 3. Boot Camp Programs. Wave currently offers intensive integrated training
programs that provide self study, Internet-based training and intensive live
labs targeted at major certifications.  Wave and its global network of
independent distributors plan to expand Linux certification training programs.

<P> 4. Publishing and Distribution. The company plans to expand its
distribution of courseware under Sair's existing Authorized Centers for

developers are wary of designing a Microsoft desktop or palmtop 
operating system into small footprint or real-time embedded applications 
where performance and reliability are paramount," continues Lehrbaum. 
"Against this backdrop, the ability of developers to tune and customize 
Linux, in combination with its well known robustness, has made Linux 
a growing alternative to both the Microsoft Windows OSes and the 
traditional proprietary RTOSes," concludes Lehrbaum.  

<P> Through its new Embedded Linux Polls function, LinuxDevices.com intends 
to measure and characterize current and future preferences and trends of 
embedded system developers.  Like Linux itself, the polls data collected 
by LinuxDevices.com will be fully available for all to review once 
each weekly poll has closed.  A new poll will be held each week, with the 
results of past polls readily available for inspection.  Users and 
prospective users of Linux in embedded applications are encouraged 
to participate in the polls, which can be found at 
http://www.linuxdevices.com/polls.  Companies or developers are also 
invited to submit proposed poll questions to LinuxDevices.com via email, 
at polls@linuxdevices.com.
