<H3><IMG ALT=" "   SRC="../gx/bolt.gif">GNU ID Utilities</H3>
<P> 
A new release of the GNU id utilities is available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/id-utils-3.2.tar.gz">
  ftp://ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/id-utils-3.2.tar.gz</a>
<P> 
GNU id-utils is a package of simple, fast, high-capacity,
language-independent identifier database tools.  Actually, the term
``identifier'' is too limiting -- ID Utils stores tokens, be they
program identifiers of any form, literal numbers, or words of
human-readable text.  Database queries can be issued from the
command-line, or from within emacs, serving as an augmented tags
facility.
<P> 
Release 3.2 fixes a nasty bug in eid (a.k.a., "lid -R edit"), which
should only be a problem for users of non-emacs editors (e.g., vi).
This release also fixes as well as some minor portability problems.
If you use emacs and had no trouble compiling 3.1, there's no reason
for you to pick up this release.

<H3><IMG ALT=" "   SRC="../gx/bolt.gif">Linuxconf 1.6</H3>
<P> 
I am proud to announce the release of linuxconf 1.6. This release 
incorporates many enhancements and features. The last official release was 
1.3. Since, a major user interface rework has been done and many smaller 
features were added. Release 1.4 and 1.5 were only released on the 
linuxconf mailing list.
<P> 
It has been uploaded to sunsite in the pub/Linux/Incmoning directory and 
should move to /pub/Linux/System/admin/linuxconf-1.6.src.tar.gz. Binaries 
for both elf and a.out systems are provided at the same place.
<P> 
The major enhancement is the http mode. With this, you can now operate 
linuxconf using any web browser supporting forms. This makes 
administration of large linux networks a wonderful experience. You can 
navigate in linuxconf and even set bookmarks in your browser. Ultimatly 
one can build his corporate administration page with link to different 
part of linuxconf on different linux servers or workstation.

URL CHANGE from The Boy With The Thorn In His Side
<P> 
The <i>free</i> Linux software which I release under the name "SDK Software"
(morepkgtools - supplements Slackware's pkgtool; tidylinks - searches
for and tidies dangling and messy symbolic links; LNET-Config -
configuration script for the LNET TCP/IP (KA9Q-like) program) has
moved from AOL to: <P>
<a href="http://www.kalika.demon.co.uk/sdk-software/index.html">

<P>Revised versions of the software, with the correct URLs in the
manual pages etc., will be released shortly.
<P> 
If you have my AOL site bookmarked please change your records.

<P> 
The VWbot Web-traversing robot is now available as shareware.
It was developed on Linux and hasn't been tested on anything else,
but it ought to run on most Unix. It uses Perl4 and libwww-perl-0.40
<P> 
The core program may be customised to perform different functions,
such as keeping track of document modifications, operating as
a restricted-domain search engine, or as a free-running agent
configured for tasks such as lexical analysis.
The robot adheres to the original Robot Exclusion Protocol and
includes code to implement the newer ROBOTS META tag.
