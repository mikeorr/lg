<H2>DiskHog: Using Perl and the WWW to Track System Disk Usage</H2>
<H4>By Ivan Griffin,
<a href="mailto:Ivan.Griffin@ul.ie">Ivan.Griffin@ul.ie</a></H4>
</center>
<P><HR><P>

<p>
An irksome job that most system administrators have to perform at some stage
or other is the implementation of a disk quota policy.  Being a maintainer of
quite a few machines (mostly Linux and Solaris, but also including AIX)
without system enforced quotas, I needed an automatic way of tracking disk
quotas.  To this end, I created a Perl script to regularly check users disk 
usage, and compile a list of the largest hoggers of disk space.  Hopefully,
in this way, I can politely intimidate people into reducing the size of their
home directories when they get ridiculously large.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>du</tt> command summarises disk usage for a given directory hierarchy.
When run in each users home directory, it can report how much disk space
the user is occupying.  At first, I had written a shell script to run
<tt>du</tt> on a number of user directories, with an awk back-end to provide
nice formatting of the output.  This proved difficult to maintain if new users
were added to the system.  Users home directories were unfortunately located
in different places on each operating system.
</p>

<p>
Perl provided a convenient method of rewriting the shell / awk scripts into
a single executable, which not only provided more power and flexibility but
also ran faster!  Perl's integration of standard Unix system calls and C
library functions (such as <tt>getpwnam()</tt> and <tt>getgrname()</tt>) makes
it perfectly suited to tasks like this.  Rather than provide a tutorial on
the Perl language, in this article I will describe how I used Perl as a
solution to my particular need.  The complete source code to the Perl
script is shown in listing 1.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I did was to make a list of the locations in which users
home directories resided, and isolate this into a Perl array.  For each
sub-directory in the directories listed in this array, a disk usage
summary was required.  This was implemented by using the Perl system
command to spawn off a process running <tt>du</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>du</tt> output was redirected to a temporary file.  The temporary file
was named using the common $$ syntax, which is replaced at run time by the
PID of the executing process.  This guaranteed that multiple invocations
of my disk usage script (while unlikely) would not clobber each others
temporary working data.
</p>

<p>
All the sub-directories were named after the user who owned the account.  This
assumption made life a bit easier in writing the Perl script, because I could
skip users such as <tt>root</tt>, <tt>bin</tt>, etc.
</p>

<p>
I now had, in my temporary file,  a listing of a disk usage and username, one
pair per line of the file.  I wanted to split these up into an associated hash
of users and disk usage, with users as the index key.  I also wanted to
keep a running total of the entire disk usage, and also the number of
users.  Once Perl had parsed all this information from the temporary file,
I could delete it.
</p>

<p>
I decided the Perl script would dump its output as an HTML formatted page.
This allowed me great flexibility in presentation, and also permitted the
information to be available over the local intranet - quite useful when 
dealing with multiple heterogeneous environments.
</p>

<p>
Next I had to work out what information I needed to present.  Obviously the
date when the script had run was important, and a sorted table listing
disk usage from largest to smallest was essential.   Printing the <i>GCOS</i>
information field from the password file allowed me to view both
real names, and usernames.  I also decided it might be nice to provide a
hypertext link to the users homepage, if one existed.  So extracting their
official home directory from the password file, and adding on to it the
standard user directory extensions to it (typically <tt>public_html</tt> or
<tt>WWW</tt>) allowed this. 
</p>

<p>
Sorting in Perl usually involves the use of the spaceship operator (
<tt><=></tt>).  The sort function sorts a list and returns the sorted list
value.  It comes in many forms, but the form used in the code is:
</p>

<pre>

sort sub_name list

</pre>

<p>
where <tt>sub_name</tt> is a Perl subroutine.  <tt>sub_name</tt> is call
during element comparisons, and it must return an integer less than, equal to,
or greater than zero, depending on the desired order of the list elements.
<tt>sub_name</tt> may also be replaced with an inline block of Perl code.
</p>

<p>
Typically sorting numerically ascending takes the form:
</p>

<pre>

@NewList = sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @List;

</pre>

<p>
whereas sorting numerically descending takes the form:
</p>

<pre>

@NewList = sort { $b &lt;=&gt; $a } @List;

</pre>

<p>
I decided to make the page a bit flashier by adding a few of those omnipresent
coloured ball GIFs.  Green indicates that the user is within allowed limits.
Orange indicates that the user is in a danger buffer zone -  no man's land,
from which they are dangerously close to the red zone.  The red ball indicate
a user is over quota, and depending on the severity multiple red balls may be
awarded to really greedy, anti-social users.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I plagued all the web search engines until I found a suitable
GIF image of a pigglet, which I included on the top of the page.
</p>

<p>
The only job left was to include the script to run nightly as a cron job.
It needed to be run as root in order to accurately assess the disk usage
of each user - otherwise directory permissions could give false results.
To edit roots cron entries (called a <tt>crontab</tt>), first ensure you have
the environment variable <tt>VISUAL</tt> (or <tt>EDITOR</tt>) set to your
favourite editor.  Then type
</p>

<pre>

crontab -e

</pre>

<p>
Add the line from listing 2 to any existing crontab entries.  The format of
crontab entries is straightforward.  The first five fields are integers,
specifying the minute (0-59), hour (0-23), day of the month (1-31), month of
the year (1-12) and day of the week(0-6, 0=Sunday).  The use of an asterix as a
wild-card to match all values is permitted, as is specifying a list of
elements separated by commas, or a range specified by start and end (separated
by a minus).  The sixth field is the actual program to being scheduled.
</p>

<p>
A script of this size (which multiple invocations of <tt>du</tt>) takes some
time to process.  As a result, it is perfectly suited for scheduling under
cron - I have it set to run once a day on most machines (generally during the
night, which user activity is low).   I believe this script shows the
potential of using Perl, Cron and the WWW to report system statistics.
Another variant of it I have coded performs an analysis of web server log
files.  This script has served me well for many months, and I am confident it
will serve other sysadmins too.
