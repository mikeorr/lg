post it here.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Rick, sorry for the private e-mail, but can you please expand on this 
&gt; part of your e-mail:
</pre>

<p>
Not a problem.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt;Aside:  It strikes me as very odd that all 20-odd "Exhibit B" badgeware
&gt; &gt;companies (MuleSource and others) elected to hang their clauses off a
&gt; &gt;copyleft licence (Mozilla Public License) whose copyleft provisions
&gt; &gt;inherently have _zero force_ in their (and their competitors')
&gt; &gt;no-distribution ASP usage model.  Isn't that a bit like requiring
&gt; &gt;spelunkers to wear sunscreen?  Don't they realise that about 3/4 of
&gt; &gt;their chosen licence is a <em>NO-OP</em> for their entire market segment?
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure what you mean here. Feel free to drop my message if you 
&gt; don't answer private ones.
</pre>

<p>
A copyleft licence's provisions stating the obligation to give others
access to source code -- which are the main point of such licences and
what distinguishes them from simple permissive licences such as the BSD
and MIT/X licences -- trigger upon <em>distribution</em> of the covered code or
of derivative works from that code. 
</p>

<p>
In the ASP business model, however, you make absolutely full use of code
without the need to ever distribute it.  Therefore, for users operating
in that market, the source-access provisions of copyleft licences[1]
might as well not exist, since they never operate as intended:  ASP
users never need to publish source.  Effectively, ASP users can fork off
proprietary derivatives of copylefted works at will, and do anything
they wish with those, as long as they don't distribute (something their
deployment model makes unnecessary).
</p>

<p>
Companies like Google can modify, re-use, exploit other people's GPL,
MPL (etc.) works in ASP deployments for the entire coming millennium
without ever needing to share back their changes.  Or, seen another way, 
if Google <em>does</em> fully honour the intent of copyleft licences by sharing
back its changes, it can have no confidence that competitors won't then
take Google's changes proprietary in the manner described.  The intended
reciprocity of such copyleft licences thus gets finessed by the manner
of deployment.
</p>

<p>
My point to the "Exhibit B" firms is thus:  "Why on earth would you
use a licence most of whose key terms get automatically made
inapplicable by the basic business conditions of your market?  For
<em>this</em>, you paid for expensive legal advice?"
</p>

<p>
[1] Other than copyleft licences tailored specifically to address this
problem within the ASP market, three of which I cited:  Affero Public
License, Honest Public License, and the GPLv3 drafts.

Let's just be clear about what exactly was said about the "license's main
point." You are taking the quote out of context in order to make your
argument. What I was specifically talking about was the method that would
allow users wanting to use Mule in a commercial product with no attribution.
In no circumstance did I say that the license was designed to force people
to pay. The license is there to protect our IP. However I do understand the
confusion around the license and my comments--and understand that we all may
interpret these things differently.
</p>

<p>
That said, I appreciate the feedback but wonder why not a single person who
has so much to say about these licensing issues ever said "hey, we think you
should consider changing this, and here is my recommendation." The same goes
for the FAQ. If you think the information is incorrect how about helping us
fix it? Ross and I are incredibly easy to get ahold of and have numerous
emails and phone numbers. 
</p>

<p>
You do note that we made a change yesterday that significantly softens the
attribution clause, which I have stated publicly that the old version may
have not made sense for us in the first place. I am not sure that this
license is the best choice, but we are still evolving. Give us a hand and
we'll send you a Mule T-shirt (uh-oh, there's that attribution again <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":&gt;">)

Today's volleys in the licensing war.  Note that Timothy McIntyre 
is corporate counsel for one of the "Exhibit B" firms.  Earlier I 
"outed" him as a paid flack for one of the interested parties (a fact he
nowhere mentioned, at the time) when he posted his ostensibly personal
opinion that Socialtext's GAP licence [sic] should get OSI approval
because Attribution Assurance License had, earlier -- a non-sequitur
argument, and one that ignored AAL's clear violation of OSD#10, adopted
after AAL's approval.

Subject: Introducing Open Solutions Alliance
</pre>
Back in mid-December, when discussion of Socialtext's Generic
Attribution Provision and "Exhibit B" clauses got going and I'd posted a
couple of initial comments (e.g., that the wording of Exhibit B clauses
seemed to stand in the way of code reuse), I was surprised to find Brian
Behlendorf querying me in offlist mail about my reaction to such
clauses.  Brian's a good guy, and I was glad to give my assessment (that 
there was nothing inherently wrong with forced advertising clauses per
se, that the OSD#10 gaffe needed to be fixed, and that intrusion on reuse
in commerce has to be minor enough not to violate OSD#3&amp;6) -- but found
the experience odd.  For what reason was I being so promptly sounded out
in private?
</p>

<p>
Brian was of course one of OSI's founding Board members.  Lately, I'm
pretty sure his main concern has been Collab.net.
</p>

<p>
I noticed recently that on February 15, at a panel discussion at the
OpenSolutions Summit in NYC, Brian, representing Collab.net, is going to
be introducing to the world a new "trade association", the Open
Solutions Alliance (OSA), about which curiously little is being said
except that it will be "focusing on business use of open source apps",
and "not as a standards body, but more like a Good Housekeeping Seal of
Approval thing.".  Robin Miller has an interesting article about it:
<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/03/1737253">http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/03/1737253</a>
</p>

<p>
Business use of open source apps is of course a very good thing.
However, somewhat disturbingly, the main backer of the OSA, and owner of
its OpenSolutionsAlliance.org domain, appears to be yet another
proprietary Web 2.0 company posing to the public as an open source firm:
Dark Horse Ventures, LLC of Norfolk, Virginia, DBA CentricCRM.
</p>

<p>
CentricCRM publishes a "Community Edition" that is professed to be open
source, but after you download it (which is possible only after
registering and logging into their site), key code turns out to be under
the "Centric Public License" (CPL), which is of course proprietary and
used as an inducement to get people to buy separate commercial-use
licences.
</p>

<p>
CPL itself can be viewed here:

<pre>
&gt; Sorry for trying again to push forward a "hypothetical discussions"...
&gt; After going through the whole genesis of Open Source, the
&gt; "non-military use" restriction sounds too clumsy to be constructively
&gt; considered in this mailing list. But it looks like there might be some
&gt; room for the notion of ethic.
&gt;
&gt; As our research project involves human subjects, it has to be reviewed
&gt; and monitored by an independent ethics committee. Our project has
&gt; restrictions in order to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being
&gt; of all trial subjects. As this is applying to our own software, in
&gt; which way will it be inherited by people reusing our sources?
</pre>

<p>
Well, you say your <em>project</em> includes ethical restrictions, which is
perfectly reasonable given its nature and aims.  The question is:  Is
someone who fetches the source code to your software and uses it
independently of your project required to adhere to the project's
restrictions on software usage?
</p>

<p>
I looked briefly through <a href="http://emotion-research.net/">http://emotion-research.net/</a> to see if I could 
determine what strings are currently attached to such source code, but
couldn't find the latter.
</p>

<p>
Really, the fundamental point is that code, to be open source, must 
have source available and be licensed to be usable for any purpose by
all parties present and future -- including people you (generic "you")
disapprove of, using it even for purposes you might highly disapprove
of:  Users such as your enemies, your competitors, your enemies'
great-grandchildren....  Usages such as warfare, blowing away cute furry
woodland creatures, commercial competition against your company, etc.
</p>

<p>
When you (speaking generically of "you" as licensor -- and please excuse
my using this occasion to make a broader point) are mouldering in the
grave, after your company and all its VC funders[1] were obliterated
when the Financial District Meteor of 2009 struck the corner of
California and Market Streets, your source code must still be fully
adaptable for any purpose, even after you yourself are a thin layer of
dust covered with an overlay of slowly cooling extrasolar feldspar.
Ideally, your <em>licence</em> should be, too -- which is why, for example, the
otherwise highly useful IBM Public License got quickly renamed to
"Common Public Licence" and all its internal company-specific references
were made generic to <em>licensor</em> rather than "IBM" (other than the
definition of "Agreement Steward", which is the party allowed to create
new versions of the licence, as copyright holder over that document).
</p>

<p>
Because -- hey! -- one of the core ideas of open source is to make reuse
by others feasible:  reuse of licences, equally as of code.  Open source
takes the long view, and says "What happens when _you're not around_,
any more?  And how do <em>other</em> people use your licence?"

Subject: Alfresco shifts to GPL
</pre>
Some good news in the license consolidation (and badgeware) discussion:
<pre>
        The company's free Community edition previously used the Mozilla
        Public License, but the move to GPL removes some barriers, said
        Matt Asay, Alfresco's vice president of marketing. The company's
        supported and Enterprise edition remains available under a
        commercial license.
         
        "We wanted the code to be bigger than the company," Asay said.
        "People basically know what (the GPL) means, so there's no time
        wasted wondering (about) MPL [and extra exhibit B clauses]."
         
        [...]
         
        the company did add to the GPL license a "FLOSS exception"
        provision that permits the software to be embedded in other
        FLOSS (free/libre/open-source software) packages. With the
        exception, those other projects don't have to worry about a
        potential requirement to release their own software under the
        GPL, Asay said.

Yes.  You may recall I asked John Roberts of SugarCRM to explain how a very
similar FAQ entry on <em>that</em> firm's Web pages could possibly be
consistent with SugarCRM supposedly being open source -- it's still
there, by the way[1] -- and Roberts completely and scrupulously ignored
my question.
</p>

<p>
Isn't it funny how many of these folk suddenly become selectively unable
to perceive your mail, the moment it starts including inconvenient
questions?
</p>

<p>
More to the immediate point, is there <em>anyone</em> left on this mailing list
who still doubts that the primary aim of all the "Exhibit B" addenda we've
seen from these 20-odd companies (most having cloned and slightly
mutated SugarCRM's clause, which pioneered the concept) is to impair
commercial reuse?  The MuleSource and SugarCRM FAQs say third parties
_may not sell derivatives_.  And MuleSource's CEO says outright that
their licence's main point is to force commercial users to buy separate
commercial licences![2]  How much clearer could this possibly be?

I should explain two references:  (1) "Larry L." refers to noted attorney,
author, and open source luminary Larry Lessig, whom Matt Asay (of the
OSI Board, but also a "business development" flack for badgeware firm
Alfresco) turns out to have studied under at Stanford Law School.  (2)
Mark Radcliffe is OSI's General Counsel, and is also reported (by ZDnet
columnist David Berlind) to have had a disturbing lead role, on the
side, in drafting on a consulting basis these non-OSD-compliant licences
and advising the firms who then use them and claim (falsely) to be
publishing "open source".  See: <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4124">http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4124</a> and
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=3430">http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=3430</a>
</p>

<p>
It's also becoming quite apparent that the key aim of these "Exhibit B"
licences is to substantively reserve commecial-usage rights to the
copyright holder, while still claiming to be open source, and some of
them even admit it outright:
<a href="http://www.nicholasgoodman.com/bt/blog/2006/12/22/badgeware-ceo-to-community-buy-a-commercial-license/">http://www.nicholasgoodman.com/bt/blog/2006/12/22/badgeware-ceo-to-community-buy-a-commercial-license/</a>
Personally, I think it's always been understood that if you can't stand
competitors using your code in commerce, and aren't prepared to
out-compete them on an equal footing, that you aren't yet ready for open
source.   OSI President Michael Tiemann has said more or less the same thing:
<a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Fwd%3A-FW%3A-For-Approval%3A-Generic-Attribution-Provision--tf2757445.html#a7900005">http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Fwd%3A-FW%3A-For-Approval%3A-Generic-Attribution-Provision--tf2757445.html#a7900005</a>
...and he and I see eye-to-eye generally:
<a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Fwd%3A-FW%3A-For-Approval%3A-Generic-Attribution-Provision--tf2757445.html#a7900005">http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Fwd%3A-FW%3A-For-Approval%3A-Generic-Attribution-Provision--tf2757445.html#a7900005</a>
