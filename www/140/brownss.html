<h1>A Router With Just One Ethernet Port</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

<p>If you want to connect multiple computers to
a cable modem then you normally need a router
with at least two network ports.  One port talks
to the cable modem, and the other port(s) talk
to the rest of the network.  The connections are
multiplexed so that the cable modem sees only
one machine, and the router can also act as a
firewall.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's not feasible to obtain a
machine with two Ethernet ports.  This might be
the case for example if you are working on a
temporary and/or test setup and don't have the
time or the resources to order extra hardware.
My motivation for writing this article was Kapil
Hari Paranjape's article "Debian on a Slug" in
LG #138, in which he needed to use either two
separate networks (Ethernet and wi-fi) or a
network with an existing firewall/router in
order to set up the NSLU2 (the "slug"), and I
wanted to see if it's possible to do without
that extra hardware.  Especially if the slug is
going to <em>be</em> a router/firewall, it seems
a little excessive to require another one before
you can set it up.</p>

<p>In this article I present some notes on how I
constructed a router and firewall using just one
Ethernet port on a Linux machine.  It wasn't
stable enough for long-term use, but it was
adequate for temporary situations that call for
sharing a cable modem between two or three
machines.</p>

<h3>Why One Ethernet Port Can Be Enough</h3>

<p>A cable modem is basically a network bridge,
repeating selected packets from your network to
the provider's network and vice versa.  It is
usually a transparent learning bridge conforming
to the IEEE 802.1d standard; it "learns" a
number of your Ethernet addresses, and the ISP
usually limits this number to one.  If it sees
additional Ethernet addresses then it will
simply ignore them.  That is why you usually
need to switch the modem off and on again when
moving it from one machine to another.</p>

<p>If the modem is going to ignore any machine
except the first one it sees, then there is
nothing in principle to stop that first machine
from acting as a router for other machines
<em>even on the same Ethernet segment</em>.
For example, consider the following setup:</p>

<pre class="code">
            4-port Unswitched Ethernet Hub
         port 1   port 2     port 3    port 4
           |        |          |         |
         Modem   Machine A  Machine B  Machine C
</pre>

<p>The hub simply repeats any traffic it
receives, because it's unswitched.  (In fact
it's possible to make do with some simple wire
connections; more on this later.)  Therefore,
the modem sees all traffic from all machines,
and conversely all machines see the traffic from
the modem.  However, the modem will refuse to
communicate with anything except the first
machine it sees.  Suppose that this is Machine
A.  If Machine B wants to send to the outside
world, it first sends to Machine A (and the
modem ignores this), then Machine A repeats it
(and the modem takes it).  Then the reply is
addressed by the modem to Machine A (which
Machine B will ignore unless its Ethernet
interface is set to promiscuous mode) and
Machine A can repeat it for Machine B.  Note
that no machine needs more than one ethernet
port.</p>

<p>This approach is inefficient because
everything has to be repeated twice on the same
wire.  Even though Ethernet is generally much
faster than broadband, the repetitions can still
reduce the speed because they always congest
every transmission.  In spite of this, the setup
can still run at a reasonable speed, especially
if your adapters are all 100Mbps or more.</p>

<h3>Using A Simple Unpowered Hub</h3>

<p>If you have a powered hub or switch then you
can skip to the next section.</p>

<p>Some cheap devices called "ethernet
splitters" are essentially passive hubs.  Care
should be taken though because sometimes other
things are also sold as "ethernet splitters",
such as devices to use the spare wires in an
Ethernet cable for another connection, and
that's <em>not</em> useful in this setting.  If
you do find (or even make) a simple unpowered
passive hub or "ethernet splitter", you have to
think about certain characteristics of Ethernet
that can make this more complex than using a
powered hub.</p>

<p>10-base-T wiring has different wires for
transmit and receive.  If several computers are
connected using a hub, then what <em>should</em>
happen is, if any computer sends data on its
"transmit" line, then this data will be placed
on the "receive" lines of all the other
computers (or perhaps not all of them if it is a
switched hub).</p>

<p>Some simple "ethernet splitters" merely
connect all the "transmit" lines together and
all the "receive" lines together, so none of the
machines can actually exchange data unless one
of them crosses its connection (receives on the
shared "transmit" line and transmits on the
shared "receive" line).  Cable modems do
normally cross their connections, so those
"ethernet splitters" are intended to allow all
the machines to communicate with the modem
although not with each other.  This is not very
useful in the one-port router setup.</p>

<p>It would be more useful if all machines could
communicate with <em>the router</em> rather than
with the modem.  This can be arranged by
connecting the router to the hub with a
cross-over cable (or cross-over adaptor), and
using normal straight-through cable everywhere
else.  That way the router's "transmit" is
connected to the "receive" of all the other
machines and vice versa.  It might be necessary
to use a second cross-over cable to connect the
modem to the hub, in order to cancel out the
modem's own crossing-over (or, equivalently,
everything <em>except</em> the router and the
modem), but most modern cable modems will
automatically adapt anyway; just make sure the
router is the first machine to boot up.</p>

<p>Further problems can be caused by the
polarity auto-detection that's done by Ethernet
devices with auto-MDIX ports, and unfortunately
there's no way to turn that off other than to
use old hardware that doesn't have such
auto-detection.  (Many Ethernet cards have
commands to turn off auto-negotiation of
<em>speed</em> and <em>duplex</em>, but not
<em>polarity</em>.)  There should be no problems
when connecting the first two devices to the hub
(i.e. the router and the modem), but when the
third device is added, if that third device has
an auto-MDIX port then it may or may not guess
the correct polarity depending on which device
it sees first (remember they are opposites).
You might have to repeatedly disconnect and
reconnect the new device until it sees the
router, and if that new device is an NSLU2 which
you are trying to connect to a desktop router
during the initial setup stage then you'll have
to reboot it on every attempt.</p>

<p>To save the hassle of repeated connections
(and possibly reboots) of the new device, you
could try the following: After connecting only
the router and the modem to the hub and
verifying that the router can reach the outside
world (i.e. the modem has learned its MAC
address), disconnect the modem from the hub (but
without powering it off) and connect only the
new device to the hub.  Wait until you can ping
the new device, and then reconnect the modem
(you may have to reconnect the modem more than
once before it will work).  This allows the
device to negotiate polarity in a less confusing
environment, while still allowing the modem to
see the router first.</p>

<p>You may <strong>have</strong> to follow this
proceduce if the router <em>itself</em> has an
auto-MDIX port and the new device does
<em>not</em>, because it's then possible that
the router and the modem will have negotiated a
polarity that won't work with the new device no
matter how many times it's re-connected, so the
only option is to disconnect the modem while the
router detects the polarity of the new device.</p>

<p>If the new device <em>does</em> have
auto-MDIX then in some cases it may help to make
sure that the network is as quiet as possible
when connecting it.  This is because return
traffic from the modem is likely to increase the
probability of the new device guessing the wrong
polarity.</p>

<p>Finally, you may experience problems with the
cables themselves.  If the hub has no power then
it can't amplify the signal, so if the cables
are somewhat too long, or if there are cables
that are connected at the hub but not connected
to anything at the other end (or the device they
are connected to is switched off), then this can
harm the signal too much and the network will
stop working, so try to use shorter cables and
don't put any cable on the hub until it's
active.  Also, beware of fiddly connectors: it
took me many hours to track down a fault that
was caused by one of the Ethernet plugs working
intermittently because I had damaged it while
connecting things.</p>

<h3>Linux Commands For One-port Routing</h3>

<p>Linux lets you run multiple IP addresses on
the same interface, using "aliases".  This is
useful if you want the router to appear with a
private 192.168 address for the local network,
but with whatever address it is assigned for the
ISP.  After the router has DHCP-negotiated with
the ISP using <tt>dhclient</tt> or equivalent,
you can do this:</p>

<pre>
ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.0.0
</pre>

<p>replacing eth0 with whatever other interface
you are using if necessary.  The :1 can also be
:2, :3 etc to add more IP addresses; you can
have up to 256 different IP addresses on the
same interface if you want.</p>

<p>Note: This article assumes that your upstream
DHCP server does <em>not</em> give you an IP
address that is within the 192.168 subnet.  If
it does (which may be the case if your outgoing
connection is shared privately) then you could
replace 192.168 with 172.16 throughout this
article, because 172.16 is also reserved for
private use.  You may have difficulty performing
initial set-up of an NSLU2 if you cannot control
192.168 however.</p>

<p>Once you have a local-network IP, you can
then you can switch on NAT connection
forwarding:</p>

<pre class="code">
modprobe iptable_nat
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
</pre>

<p>It may also help to allow the local 192.168
network to access any services running on the
router, if its firewall does not already allow
this:</p>

<pre>
iptables -A INPUT -d 192.168.1.1 -j ACCEPT
</pre>

<p>You may also wish to run a DHCP server for
the local network, to save having to manually
configure your other machines' IP addresses.
This usually means installing a package like
<tt>dhcp</tt> and putting something like the
following into <tt>/etc/dhcpd.conf</tt>:</p>

<pre class="code">
subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
  range 192.168.1.100 192.168.1.199;
  option routers 192.168.1.1;
  option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;
}
</pre>

<p>and then run or restart <tt>dhcpd</tt>.  When
putting all this in the system startup scripts,
check that the above commands run before
<tt>dhcpd</tt> (in a default Debian installation
it suffices to put them at the end of the
<tt>start)</tt> section of
<tt>/etc/init.d/networking</tt>).</p>

<p>It may also help to ensure that
<tt>dhclient</tt> waits to be assigned an
address by an <em>outside</em> DHCP server,
<em>not</em> by the DHCP server running on the
same machine (which may respond first,
especially if the outside server goes down for a
while).  To do this, put</p>

<pre>
reject 192.168.1.1;
</pre>

<p>into <tt>dhclient.conf</tt> (usually in the
<tt>/etc/dhcp3</tt> directory).  This is not
necessary if you are setting up a one-off router
manually and do not need it to work at system
startup, because in that case the DHCP client
will likely have obtained an outside address
before you can type the commands.</p>

<p>Note that the above <tt>option
domain-name-servers</tt> in <tt>dhcpd.conf</tt>
will work only if the router is running a DNS
cache such as <tt>pdnsd</tt> (available as a
Debian package); if you don't want to run that
extra server then you'll have to arrange for the
upstream DNS server to be copied into
<tt>dhcpd.conf</tt>.</p>

<h3>Security Considerations</h3>

<p>The above commands are reasonably secure by
default.  While it is relatively easy for
someone on the outside Internet to send a packet
to your router with a fake 192.168 source IP,
they will not normally be able to set the
<em>destination</em> to anything other than your
router's public IP address, which means they
will not be able to access any private servers
that are open only on your router's 192.168
address (that's why the above <tt>INPUT</tt>
rule uses <tt>-d</tt> to specify the
<em>destination</em> IP address as being
192.168.1.1, rather than simply constraining the
source IP).  Also because of the natural
constraint on the destination IP, they will not
be able to access any of your computers other
than the router (even if you have a hub that
allows everything to see the modem traffic), nor
will they be able to get your router to help
forward their packets either to your network or
to elsewhere.</p>

<p>However, there are some circumstances in
which it <em>is</em> possible for an attacker to
deliver packets into your network with a
destination IP address other than that of your
public IP.  This can happen if the attacker
takes over your ISP's equipment, or if your
ISP's equipment allows source routing, or if the
attacker breaks into the connection
on <em>your</em> side of the ISP.  If you wish, you
can take extra steps to protect your private
network from this kind of attack.</p>

<p>Such steps involve both protecting the router
itself, and ensuring that it is not possible to
place packets on the network that bypass the
router.</p>

<p>The router itself can be protected by adding
MAC-address rules so that it accepts packets
only from the known MAC addresses of your
network adapters and does not accept
inappropriate packets from the modem.  See the
<tt>iptables(8)</tt> man page for details.  Note
that cable modems' MAC addresses have been known
to change at power-cycling, so it's better to
make a list of all your <em>other</em> MAC
addresses.  In order to get past this test, an
attacker would either have to get packets onto
your network by some means other than via the
cable modem, or else break into the modem itself
or (in some cases) the ISP's head node.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> get the other machines on
your network to also recognise unwanted packets
by MAC address, but you may have some machines
that cannot run firewalls, and if they can see
the traffic from the cable modem before it gets
to the router then you could have a problem if
an attacker can fake destination IP addresses.
The best workaround to this is probably to use a
simple "ethernet splitter" hub (see the above
section) which physically prevents traffic from
bypassing the router even though the router has
only one port.</p>

<h3>Routing Packets Between The Private Machines</h3>

<p>If the private network is such that all the
machines can see the router but they cannot see
each other, then, if you need them to be able to
communicate with each other, you need to arrange
for this to go through the router even though
they're on the same subnet.  This is not too
difficult if you can manipulate their route
tables by hand, but it's slightly more difficult
with DHCP (and note that most DHCP client
implementations don't support all the extra
options).  You could simply set up
port-forwarding rules on the router and have the
other machines explicitly connect to the router
rather than to each other (more on
port-forwarding below).  A more transparent
solution (but more complex to set up) is to
arrange for the router to listen on many
different IP addresses, each on a very small
subnet (with a very narrow network mask) and to
allow only one DHCP-allocable address on each
of these subnets.  At any rate, expect the
network speed to be less than what it would be
if you had a proper switch, because everything
is being repeated.</p>

<h3>Port Forwarding</h3>

<p>One final thing you may wish to do is to
forward ports, both to make allowances for
running public servers such as a Web server, and
to facilitate communication between the machines
on the private network if they can't see each
other (see previous section).</p>

<p>If the server is run on the router itself
then this is simply a matter of ensuring the
router's firewall allows incoming connections on
that port, if it does not already do so.  (When
specifying that the server is for the private
network only, remember that restricting the
<em>destination</em> to 192.168.1.1 is more
secure than restricting the <em>source</em> for
the reasons discussed in the security section
above.)</p>

<p>The general way to do port forwarding with
iptables (which is more lightweight than setting
up some process to listen on the port and
forward connections) is this:</p>

<pre>
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -d $PUBLIC_ADDRESS --dport $PUBLIC_PORT -j DNAT --to $REAL_ADDRESS:$REAL_PORT
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -s $REAL_ADDRESS --sport $REAL_PORT -j SNAT --to $PUBLIC_ADDRESS:$PUBLIC_PORT
</pre>

<p>where <tt>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</tt> and
<tt>PUBLIC_PORT</tt> are set to the public IP
address of the router and the port you want the
server to appear on, and <tt>REAL_ADDRESS</tt>
and <tt>REAL_PORT</tt> are where the server is
actually running on the local network.  Note
that this method can <strong>only</strong> make
the server visible on <strong>one</strong>
interface: <strong>either</strong> the router's
public IP address, <strong>or</strong> the
private 192.168.1.1 address, or localhost if you
use <tt>OUTPUT</tt> instead of
<tt>PREROUTING</tt>, but not more than one of
these at the same time.  If you require more
than one interface to forward to the same server
then you'll have to set up a process to listen
and forward connections, such as by connecting
<tt>inetd</tt> to <tt>nc</tt>, or even by using
<tt>ssh</tt>, which is rather overkill for a
private network but it's probably the least
difficult way to set up forwarding).</p>

<p>If you do use iptables to forward ports for
the <em>public</em> interface then you need to
set <tt>PUBLIC_ADDRESS</tt> to the IP that your
ISP gives you.  You will likely find that your
distribution's <tt>/etc/dhcp3/</tt> has a
<tt>dhclient-exit-hooks</tt> script or
<tt>dhclient-exit-hooks.d</tt> directory (see
man dhclient-script) in which you can place
commands such as:</p>

<pre class="code">
if [ $reason = BOUND -o $reason = RENEW -o $reason = REBIND -o $reason = REBOOT ]; then

  # new IP will be placed in $new_ip_address
  # may need to flush the tables (e.g. changed IP)
  iptables -t nat -F PREROUTING
  iptables -t nat -F POSTROUTING

  # ... then add the rules here, using $new_ip_address

  # and finally re-add the masquerade rule
  # (because it would have been deleted by the above flush)
  iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE

fi
</pre>

<p>You may also need to take some care when
setting <tt>REAL_ADDRESS</tt> to make sure that
it is always the same, either by configuring
that machine manually (without DHCP) or by
noting its MAC address and giving that a
<tt>fixed-address</tt> in <tt>dhcpd.conf</tt>
(see man page for details).</p>

<p>If you use the voice-over-IP application
"Skype", it can sound better if you open a port
for it in this way and thus avoid the need for
your connections to be relayed.  For best
results open UDP as well as TCP (i.e. repeat the
above forwarding setup twice, once as-is and
once substituting <tt>-p udp</tt> for <tt>-p
tcp</tt> in both commands), and tell Skype about
the port in Tools/Options/Advanced, but don't
tell Skype until <em>after</em> the port is
open, because Skype may not save the setting if
it does not appear to work at the time.  If you
use Skype from more than one machine then you
can give each one a different public port.</p>

<h3>Concluding Remarks</h3>

<p>The above discussion of routing commands is
probably more in-depth than you need for a
temporary setup, but it is included because you
might find that your setup is actually stable
and you don't need a multi-port router after
all.  If you <em>do</em> need a multi-port
router then you can use your one-port router
settings as a reference when configuring the
multi-port version.</p>

<p>In my trials with the NSLU2, a desktop, a
laptop and a cable modem on a simple "Ethernet
splitter" unpowered hub, when the NSLU2 was
fully set up as a slug and was itself acting as
the one-port router, it often lost connectivity,
sometimes to the point of having to be rebooted
(not just disconnected and reconnected from the
network), if it processed large amounts of
traffic for too long ("too long" being anything
from seconds to minutes).  Extreme throttling of
the traffic and packet sizes did help to avoid
this, but it made the connection worse than
dial-up.  However, when the desktop PC was
acting as the one-port router on the same
network, that problem did not occur.  As is so
often the case, "Your Mileage May Vary".  But it
may at least be useful to know that, if you're
in a desperate situation, you <em>can</em> rig
up a router/firewall on a machine with only one
Ethernet port.</p>
