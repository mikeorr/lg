Hello Gang
</p>

<p>
I'd like to know if there's some kind of "reference guide" for Linux 
console-based applications, or perhaps a web site / community of people who 
enjoy doing everything via command line and ncurses-based apps, without 
setting up graphical desktop environments.
</p>

<p>
I've already encountered several apps, e.g., for working with e-mails 
(Mutt), browsing the web (Elinks), playing music (Moc), chatting over MSN 
(Pebrot), and so on, but I'd like to try more options on each of those 
activities, and do other things such as recording and playing CDs and DVDs, 
sharing files over p2p, resizing partitions, reading PDFs and word documents 
or converting them to text, chatting over VoIP, reading RRS feeds, editing 
audio, etc etc.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much and congratulations for your work on Linux Gazette, my 
favourite magazine.

MPlayer supports playing on a framebuffer console. Try
mplayer -vo fbdev
if it doesn't work automatically.

You can use Snownews to read RSS feeds: <a href="http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/">http://kiza.kcore.de/software/snownews/</a>

Ecasound (<a href="http://www.eca.cx/ecasound/">http://www.eca.cx/ecasound/</a>) is a multitrack recording
program that you can use for editing audio.

My above, borderline smart ass response aside, there are way too many 
scripts and binaries out there to list for every task. Whenever you run 
into a new task or feature that you want try Google-ing around, searching 
source repositories, your distro's package management system (if it has 
one), tldp.org, etc. (and, of course, LG). Then, if you cannot find a 
command line solution, try asking in communities like this one.
</p>

<p>
Also keep in mind that package names will often be related to the task at 
hand. For example, want to convert between rpm and deb? Try searching for 
rpm2deb (a common naming scheme).

Well, I will list off my personal preferences for some of your listed 
tasks. Keep in mind, though, that one of the beautiful things about the 
command line is that there is always more than one way to do something.
</p>

<pre>
E-mail: pine (choose a gpg hack of your choice; handles IMAP well enough)
Web: lynx
Music: mpg123 (thanks for the Moc tip, I am trying it out now)
Resizing partitions: fdisk (or whatever tool in that "suite" best fits my 
needs)
CD playing: cdcd, dcd (I don't like either of them, so just use a GUI 
player)
.doc to ascii/.pdf: antiword

</pre>

<p>
I'll tune in and list some of my favourites as well.
</p>

<pre>
 - jfbterm is very useful if you run the console in a framebuffer and
   have a need for displaying UTF-8 characters (which might be useful if
   you look at the output of antiword or pdftotext).
 - Speaking of the framebuffer, if you have one you might want to try
   w3m for web browsing since it has also framebuffer support.
 - mp3blaster and ogg123 for playback; mp3blaster has playlist features.
 - cabber is a Jabber client for the console. Jabber supports multiple
   messaging protocols, cabber is a way to use some from the console.
 - htop is a nicer variant of top for displaying the process list.
</pre>
If you're interested in trying out more console-based utils I can
readily recommend the GRML Live CD (<a href="http://www.grml.org/">http://www.grml.org/</a>). It's a
complete bootable system, boots into a nice framebuffer console and has
tons of console tools. It is my weapon of choice for my sysadmin work. I
am sure you will find lots of useful tools by browsing its package list:
<a href="http://www.grml.org/files/#debian">http://www.grml.org/files/#debian</a>

Best,

tips and suggestions on specific software and the GRML distro. I'll give 
them a look.

<p>
There used to be something called the "command-line
brotherhood"---you may want to google^Wcheck whether they still
exist.
</p>

<p>
Here are some that I have made friends with:
<pre>
1. "screen" (to avoid logging in many times while on the console
   and a host of other things).
2. "w3m" for web-browsing.
3. "xmms2" for playing music --- in spite of the X it does not need
   graphics to play music.
4. "weechat" for IRC. ("bitlbee" to convert IM services to IRC).
5. "wyrd" for appointments.
6. "abcde" for recording from CD's to disk.
7. "mc" for file management.
8. "catdoc" for viewing word documents.
9. "pdftotext", "pdftohtml" for viewing PDF documents. 
</pre>
You can also skip all of the above and install (x)emacs along with a
bunch of elisp programs. It is a "universal" command-line
environment.
</p>

<p>
However, it is probably better to run all these programs in an X
window environment <strong>if</strong> that is possible for you. Reasons follow:
<pre>
	a. That is what 80% of the people you correspond with
	   will expect you to be running. So it will be easier
	   to exchange notes.
	b. When you need to quickly do some task (expedience) 
	   that involves a web-site (say) which <strong>requires</strong> a
	   graphical browser like Firefox what will you do?
	c. If you like a fullscreen text-mode window without
	   the clutter of the modern window interface, this
	   can be done with X. Hints for doing this with FVWM,
	   Icewm and other window managers are scattered through
	   LG and elsewhere.
	d. Like the complaints about emacs, the complaints about X
	   being a resource hog are a not meaningful on standard
	   post-2000 desktop machine.
</pre>
Hope this helps,
</p>

Me, I would use 'links2 -g'. Heck, a graphical browser exists for <strong>DOS</strong>

I haven't used the graphical mode for links2. Does it support
"flash"? There are web sites (unfortunately) which cannot be
<strong>navigated</strong> without flash support. Now normally I would just ignore
this or file a complaint with the web-site authors. However, there are
times when one has to meet a deadline and so expedience rules over all
else. 
</p>

<p>
Similarly, catdoc or wv or a complaint to the person responsible
are adequate measures for most .doc files one has to deal with---but
when there is a deadline one cannot do without openoffice or abiword.
One can (and should) file a complaint later of course.
</p>

<p>
For this reason, I feel that one should have a running X if
possible. It is still possible to work "as if" one is on the
console if one configures things suitably.

Is there some console program to view or extract the contents of PPS and

You could try "ppthtml". However, this is not a way to view the

I haven't used it myself, but as I understand it, all that's necessary

<p>
Over time, I've trained all my correspondents (at least, those who had

<p>
Oh, I agree - if for no reason other than the ease of flipping between
xterms. However, Linux should have (and does) powerful, efficient
software that allows people to work and be productive on low-end
hardware. I'm a big fan of that.

&gt; (Who feels that deadlines are one way for the majority to dominate

<p>
I'm glad you mentioned that - here we are, just past the LG deadline,
and we're very short on articles this month. Since I - all by my
lonesome! - am the deadline-wielding majority, I think I'll dominate the
minority (the rest of the world) and force them to start assiduously
writing articles for us every month...

&gt; Hey,
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; I'd like to know if there's some kind of "reference guide" for Linux 
&gt; &gt; console-based applications, or perhaps a web site / community of people who 
&gt; &gt; enjoy doing everything via command line and ncurses-based apps, without 
&gt; &gt; setting up graphical desktop environments.
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Has a list of some programs that you can use from the command line for 
&gt; common tasks.

That's <em>really</em> nice. I particularly liked 'twin' - it's very, very
cute.
