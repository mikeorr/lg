<p>
I am having an issue sending out e-mails from my linux box.  Here is the issue:
</p>

<p>
I am getting the message
<pre>
"host map: lookup (boyslatinmd.com): deffered"
</pre>
The linux machine is named reeses.boyslatinmd.com (10.1.10.65 internal address)
</p>

<p>
All mail for the boyslatinmd.com domain is handled by email.boyslatinmd.com (10.1.10.4 internal address)
</p>

<p>
I have tried setting up domain routing using sendmail and nothing seems to work using either the ip address or host name.  I have even tried sending mail directly to the internal ip address and it doesn't work.  Please help ASAP as I am trying to get a helpdesk server setup before the school year in about 2 weeks.  
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the help.
</p>

How is that set up? Looked at from outside the MX (Mail eXchanger) record 
seems to point to servers at appriver.com

<p>
but Googling for that error message gives me 
<a href="http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/host_map__lookup_(domain)__deferred.html">http://www.brandonhutchinson.com/host_map__lookup_(domain)__deferred.html</a>, 
which suggests that it's a DNS problem and something 
like "sendmail -v -d8.32 -qImessage_ID" should provide some extra 
information. 
</p>

<p>
You could also help us by saying exactly what you tried and what effect it 
had, e.g. the exact domain routing settings in your configuration, the 
changes you made and the error messages for each version.
</p>

<p>
When you say you tried sending directly to the internal IP address, could you 
clarify exactly what you did to achieve this and exact error messages 
received.
</p>

<p>
I don't use sendmail myself, perhaps someone else on the gang can help you dig  
a bit deeper?
