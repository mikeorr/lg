When the only hammer you have is C++, the whole world looks like a thumb.

<h3>Deep Thoughts</h3>

<p>
At this point, we're getting pretty close to what I consider the upper
limit of basic shell scripting; there are still a few areas I'd like to
cover, but most of the issues are getting rather involved. A good
example is the 'tput' command that I'll be discussing this month: in order
to really understand what's going on, as opposed to just using it, you'd
need to learn all about "termcap/terminfo" controversy - a deep, involved,
<strong>ugly</strong> issue (for those who really want to know, just search
the Net and read the "Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO".) I'll try to make sense
despite the confusion, but be warned.
</p>

<h3>Affunctionately Yours</h3>

<p>
The concept of functions is not a difficult one, but is
certainly very useful: they are simply blocks of code that you can
execute under a single label - essentially, a way to save you a lot of
typing when repeating previous work. Unlike a script, they do not spawn a
new subshell but execute within the current one. Functions can be used
within a script, or as stand-alone chunks of code to be executed in the
shell.
</p>

<p>
Let's see how a function works in a shell script:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
#
# "<a href="misc/okopnik/venice_beach.bash.txt">venice_beach</a>" - translates English to beach-bunny
 
# Makes everything, like, totally rad, dude!
function kewl ()
{
	[ -z "$1" ] &amp;&amp; {
		# Exit with an error message if no argument has been
		# supplied.
		echo "That was bogus, dude."
		return 1
	}

	echo "Like, I'm thinkin', dude, gimme a minute..."
	sleep 1
	
	# While the function runs, positional parameters ($1, etc.)
	# refer to those given the function - not the shell script.
	echo $*', dude!'
}

# Process all the command-line arguments
kewl $*

</pre>

<p>
This, umm, incredibly important script should print the "I'm
thinkin'..." line followed by a thoroughly mangled list of
parameters:
</p>

<pre>
Odin:~$ venice_beach Right on
Like, I'm thinkin', dude, gimme a minute...
Right on, dude!
Odin:~$ venice_beach Rad.
Like, I'm thinkin', dude, gimme a minute...
Rad, dude!
Odin:~$ venice_beach Dude!
Like, I'm thinkin', dude, gimme a minute...
Dude, dude!
</pre>

<p>
Functions may also be loaded into the environment, and invoked
just like shell scripts; we'll talk about sourcing functions later
on. For those of you who use Midnight Commander, check out the "mc
()" function described in their man page - it's a very useful one,
and is initially loaded from ".bash_profile".
</p>

<p>
Important item: functions are <em>created</em> as <code>"function
pour_the_beer () { ... }"</code> or <code>"pour_the_beer () { ... }"</code>
(the keyword is optional), but they are <em>invoked</em> as "pour_the_beer"
(no parentheses). Also, remember not to use an "exit" statement in a
function: since you're running the code in the current shell, this
will cause you to exit your current shell or terminal!  Exiting a shell
script this way can produce some very ugly results, like a 'hung' console
that has to be killed from another VT (yep, I've experimented). The
statement that will terminate a function without killing the shell is
"return".
</p>


<h3>Single, Free, and Easy</h3>
<p>
Everything we've discussed in this series so far has a common
underlying assumption: that the script you're writing is going to
be saved and re-used. For most scripts, that's what you'd want -
but what if you have a situation where you need the
<em>structure</em> of a script, but you're only going to use it once
(i.e., don't need or want to create a file)? The answer is - Just
Type It:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Odin:~$ (
&gt; [ "$blood_caffeine_concentration" -lt 5ppm ] &amp;&amp; {
&gt; echo $LOW_CAFFEINE_ERROR
&gt; brew ttyS2 	# Enable coffeepot via /dev/ttyS2
&gt; while [ "$coffee_cup" != "full" ]
&gt; do
&gt; echo "Drip..."
&gt; sleep 1
&gt; done
&gt;
&gt; while [ "$coffee_cup" != "empty" ]
&gt; do
&gt; sip_slowly 	# Coffee ingestion binary, from coffee_1.6.12-4.tgz
&gt; echo "Slurp..."
&gt; done
&gt; }
&gt;
&gt; echo "Aaaahhh!"
&gt; echo
&gt; )
</pre>

<pre>
Coffee Not Found: Operator Halted!
Drip...
Drip...
Drip...
Slurp...
Slurp...
Slurp...
Aaaahhh!

Odin:~$
</pre>

<p>
Typing a '(' character tells Bash that you'd like to spawn a
subshell and execute, within that subshell, the code that follows -
and this is what a shell script does. The ending character, ')',
obviously tells the subshell to 'close and execute'.
</p>

<p>
So, why would we want to do this? Well, there are many times when you might
want to execute a function as an atomic unit - a good example might be
restarting an SSH server on a remote machine.
</p>

<pre class="code">
# BAD idea!
ssh root@remotehost '/etc/init.d/sshd stop; /etc/init.d/sshd start'
</pre>

<p>
Think about it: the first command shuts down the server, the second one
restarts it... OOOPS! As soon as you shut it down, you lost your connection
to that machine - worse yet, now that the server is down, you can't even
reconnect! The right answer, of course, is to run it in a subshell:
</p>

<pre class="code">
ssh root@remotehost '(/etc/init.d/sshd stop; /etc/init.d/sshd start)'
</pre>

<p>
Even if you're not logged in, the subshell will finish executing.
</p>

<p>
Explicit subshells are also useful for delayed/timed operations:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Shows 10 seconds worth of incoming system messages, then exits
(sleep 10; pkill -n tail) &amp; tail -f /var/log/messages
</pre>

<p>
Of course, something like a simple loop or a single 'if' statement doesn't
require any of that; it can simply be typed in and run from the command
line:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Odin:~$ for fname in *.c
&gt; do
&gt; echo $fname
&gt; cc $fname -o $(basename $fname .c)
&gt; done
</pre>

<p>
"bash" is smart enough to recognize a multi-part command of this
type - a handy sort of thing when you have more than a line's worth
of syntax to type (not an uncommon situation in a 'for' or a
'while' statement). By the way, a cute thing happens when you hit
the up-arrow to repeat the last command: "bash" will reproduce
everything as a single line - with the appropriate semi-colons
added. Clever, those GNU people...
</p>

<p>
No shebang ("#!/bin/bash") is necessary for a one-time script, as there
would be at the start of a script file. You know that you're executing this
in "bash" (at least I <em>hope</em> you're running "bash" while writing and
testing a "bash" script...), whereas with a script file you can never be
sure: the user's choice of shell is an arbitrary variable, so the shebang is
necessary to make sure that the script uses the correct interpreter.
</p>


<h3>The Best Laid Plans of Mice and Men</h3>
<p>
In order to write good shell scripts, you have to learn good
programming. Simply knowing the ins and outs of the commands that
"bash" will accept is far from all there is - the first step of
problem <em>resolution</em> is problem <em>definition</em>, and
defining exactly what needs to be done can be far more challenging
than writing the actual script.
</p>

<p>
One of the first scripts I ever wrote, "bkgr" (a random
background selector for X), had a problem - I'd call it a "race
condition", but that means something different in Unix terminology
- that took a long time and a large number of rewrites to resolve.
"bkgr" is executed as part of my ".xinitrc":
</p>

<pre class="code">
...
# start some nice programs
bkgr &amp;
rxvt-xterm -geometry 78x28+0+26 -tn xterm -fn 10x20 -iconic &amp;
coolicon &amp;
icewm
</pre>

<p>
OK, going by the book - I background all the processes except the last one,
"icewm" (this way, the window manager keeps X "up", and exiting it kills
the server). Here was the problem: "bkgr" would run and "paint" my
background image on the root window; fine, so far.  Then, "icewm" runs -
and paints a greenish-gray background over it (I found out later that
there's a way do disable that behavior, but the problem it presented at the
time was interesting enough to be worth examining.)
</p>

<p>
What to do? I can't put "bkgr" after "icewm" - the WM has to be
last. How about a delay after "bkgr", say 3 seconds... oh, that
won't work: it would simply delay the "icewm" start by 3 seconds.
OK, how about <em>this</em> (in "bkgr"):
</p>

<pre class="code">
...
while [ -z "$(ps ax|grep icewm)" ] # Check via 'ps' if "icewm" is up
do
	sleep 1 # If not, wait, then loop
done
...
</pre>

<p>
That should work, since it'll delay the actual "root window
painting" until after "icewm" is up!
</p>

<hr width="20%" style="margin-top: 25px;">

<p>
It didn't work, for <em>three</em> major reasons.
</p>

<p>
Reason #1: try the above "ps ax|grep" line from your command
line, for any process that you have running; e.g., type
</p>

<pre>
ps ax|grep init
</pre>

<p>
In fact, try it several times. What you will get, randomly, is either one
or two lines: just "init", or "init" <em>and</em> the "grep init" as well,
where "ps" manages to catch the line that you're currently executing!
</p>

<p>
Reason #2: "icewm" starts, takes a second or so to load, and
<em>then</em> paints the root window. Worse yet, that initial delay
varies - when you start X for the first time after booting, it
takes significantly longer than subsequent restarts. "So," you
say, "make the delay in the loop a bit longer!" That doesn't work
either - I've got two machines, an old laptop and a desktop, and
the laptop is horribly slow by comparison; you can't "size" a delay
to one machine and have it work on both... and in my not-so-humble
opinion, a script should be universal - you shouldn't have to
"adjust" it for a given machine. At the very least, that kind of
tuning should be minimized, and preferably eliminated
completely.
</p>

<p>
One of the things that also caused trouble at this point is that
some of my pics are pretty large - e.g., my photos from the Kennedy
Space Center - and take several seconds to load. The overall effect
was to allow large pics to work with "bkgr", whereas the smaller
ones got overpainted - and trying to stretch the delay resulted in
a significant built-in slowdown in the X startup process, an
undesirable side effect.
</p>

<p>
Reason #3: "bkgr" was supposed to be a random background
selector as well as a startup background selector - meaning that if
I didn't like the original background, I'd just run it again to get
another one. A built-in delay any longer than a second or so, given
that a pic takes time to paint anyway, was not acceptable.
</p>

<p>
What a mess. What was needed was a conditional delay that would
keep running as long as "icewm" wasn't up, then a fixed delay that
would cover the interval between the "icewm" startup and the "root
window painting". The first thing I tried was creating a reliable
'detector' for "icewm":
</p>

<pre class="code">
...
delay=0
X="$(ps ax)"

while [ $(echo $X|grep -c icewm) -lt 1 ]
do
[ $delay -eq 0 ] &amp;&amp; (delay=1; sleep 3)
[ $delay -eq 1 ] &amp;&amp; sleep 1
X="$(ps ax)"
done
...
</pre>

<p>
'$X' gets set to the value of "$(ps ax)", a long string listing all the
running processes which we check for the presence of "icewm" as the loop
condition. The thing that makes all the difference here is that "ps ax" and
"grep" are not running at the same time: one runs inside (and just before)
the loop, the other is done as part of the loop test. This registers a
count of only one "icewm" if it is running, and none if it is not.
Unfortunately, due to the finicky timing - specifically the difference in
the delays between an initial X startup and repeated ones - this wasn't
quite good enough. Lots of experimentation later, I came up with a version
that worked - a rather crude hack, but one that finally reflected that I
understood what was going on... only to be supplanted a week or two later
by a new release of "icewm" that fixed/bypassed all those problems.
<strong>And</strong> I found out about 'pgrep', which eliminates that
'multiple line' problem when checking the process table. Life was good. :)
</p>

<p>
There are a number of programming errors to watch out for: "race
conditions" (a security concern, not just a time conflict), the 'banana
problem', the 'fencepost' or 'Obi-Wan' error... (Yes, they do have interesting
names; a story behind each one.) Reading up on a bit of programming theory
would benefit anyone who's learning to write shell scripts; if nothing
else, you won't be repeating someone else's mistakes. My favorite reference
is an ancient "C" manual, long out of print, but there are many fine
reference texts available on the net; take a peek. There are standard
algorithms that solve standard programming problems; these methods are
language-independent, and are very good gadgets to have in your mental
toolbox.

<h3>Coloring Fun With Dick and Jane</h3>
<p>
One of the things that I used to do, way back when in the days of BBSs and
the ASCII art that went with them, is create flashy opening screens that
moved and bleeped and blinked and did all sorts of things. This was
accomplished without any graphics programming or anything more complicated
than ASCII codes and ANSI escape sequences - they could get complicated
enough, thank you very much - since all of this ran on pure text terminals.
(Incidentally, if you want to do that kind of thing, Linux
<strong>rocks</strong>. Thanks to the absolutely stunning work done by Jan
Hubicka and friends on "aalib" - if you have not seen "bb", the demo
program for "aalib", you're missing out on a serious acid trip - it has
outstripped everything even the fanciest ASCII artist could come up with
and then some. As an example, they have "Quake" and fractal generators
running on text-only terminals; hard to believe, but true - and beautifully
done.)
</p>

<p>
What does this have to do with us, since we're not doing any
"aalib"-based programming? Well, there are times when you want to
create a nice-looking menu, say one you'll be using every day - and
if you're working with text, you'll need some specialized
tools:
</p>

<p>
1) Cursor manipulation. The ability to position the cursor is a must;
being able to turn it on and off, and saving and restoring the
position are nice to have.
</p>

<p>
2) Text attribute control. Bold, underline, blinking, reverse -
these are all useful in menu creation.
</p>

<p>
3) Color. Let's face it: plain old B&amp;W gets boring after a
bit, and even something as simple as a text menu can benefit from a
touch of spiffing up.
</p>

<p>
So, let's start with a simple menu:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
#
# "<a href="misc/okopnik/ho-hum.bash.txt">ho-hum</a>" - a text-mode menu

clear

while [ 1 ] # Loop 'forever'
do
	# We're going to do some 'display formatting' to lay out the text;
	# a 'here-document', using "cat", will do the job for us.

	cat &lt;&lt;-!

	M A I N   M E N U

	1. Business auto policies
	2. Private auto policies
	3. Claims
	4. Accounting
	5. Quit
	!

	echo -n " Enter your choice: "

	read choice
	case $choice in
		1|B|b) bizpol ;;
		2|P|p) perspol ;;
		3|C|c) claims ;;
		4|A|a) acct ;;
		5|Q|q) clear; exit ;;
		*) echo; echo "\"$choice\" is not a valid option."; sleep 2 ;;
	esac

	sleep 1
	clear
done
</pre>

<p>
If you download the file containing this script and run it, you'll realize
why the insurance business is considered deadly dull. Erm, well,
<em>one</em> of the reasons, I guess. Bo-o-ring ([grin] apologies to one of
my former employers, but it's true...) Not that there's a tremendous amount
of excitement to be had out of a text menu - but surely there's something
we can do to make things just a tad brighter!
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
#
# "<a href="misc/okopnik/jazz_it_up.bash.txt">jazz_it_up</a>" - an improved text-mode menu

tput civis 	# Turn off the cursor

while [ 1 ]
do
	echo -e '\E[44;38m' # Set colors: bg=blue, fg=white
	clear 	# Redraw the screen with the above color set
	echo -e '\E[41;38m' # bg=red

	echo -ne '\E[45;38m' # bg=magenta
	tput cup 8 25 ; echo -n  "    M A I N     M E N U    "
	echo -e '\E[41;38m' # bg=red

	tput cup 10 25 ; echo -n " 1. Business auto policies "
	tput cup 11 25 ; echo -n " 2. Private auto policies  "
	tput cup 12 25 ; echo -n " 3. Claims                 "
	tput cup 13 25 ; echo -n " 4. Accounting             "
	tput cup 14 25 ; echo -n " 5. Quit                   "

	echo -ne '\E[44;38m' # bg=blue
	tput cup 16 28 ; echo -n " Enter your choice: "
	tput cup 16 48

	read choice
	tput cup 18 30

	case "$choice" in
		1|B|b) bizpol ;;
		2|P|p) perspol ;;
		3|C|c) claims ;;
		4|A|a) acct ;;
		5|Q|q) tput sgr0; clear; exit ;;
		*) tput cup 18 26; echo "\"$choice\" is not a valid option."; sleep 2 ;;
	esac
done
</pre>

<p>
This is NOT, by any means, The Greatest Menu Ever Written - but if you run
it in a modern terminal (i.e., xterm or rxvt), it will give you an idea of
some basic layout and color capabilities. Note that the colors may not work
exactly right in some odd versions of xterm, depending on your hardware and
your "terminfo" version - I did this as a quick slapdash job to illustrate
the capabilities of "tput" and "echo -e". These things can be made portable
- "tput" variables are common to almost everything, and color values can be
set based on the value of '$TERM' - but this script falls short of that.
These codes, by the way, are basically the same for DOS, Linux, etc., text
terminals - they're dependent on hardware/firmware rather than the software
we're running. Xterms, as always, are a different breed...
</p>

<p>
So, what's this "tput" and "echo -e" stuff? Well, in order to 'speak'
directly to our terminal, i.e., give it commands that will be used to
modify the terminal characteristics, we need a method of sending control
codes. The difference between these two methods is that while "echo -e"
accepts "raw" escape codes (like '\e[H\e[2J' - same thing as
&lt;esc&gt;H&lt;esc&gt;2J), "tput" calls them as 'capabilities' - i.e.,
"tput clear" does the same thing as "echo -e" with the above code. 'tput'
is also term-independent: it uses the codes in the terminfo database for
the current term-type. The problem with 'tput' is that most of the codes
for it are as impenetrable as the escape codes that they replace: things
like 'civis' ("make cursor invisible"), 'cup' ("move cursor to x y"), and
'smso' ("start standout mode") are just as bad as memorizing the codes
themselves! Worse yet, I've never found a reference that lists them all...
well, just remember that the two methods are basically interchangeable, and
you'll be able to use whatever is available. The "infocmp" command will
list the capabilities and their equivalent codes for a given terminal type;
when run without any parameters, it returns the set for the current
terminal.
</p>

<p>
Colors and attributes for an ISO6429 (ANSI-compliant) terminal,
i.e., a typical text terminal, can be found in the "ls" man page,
in the "DISPLAY COLORIZATION" section; xterms, on the other hand,
vary so much in their interpretation of exactly what a color code
means, that you basically have to "try it and see":
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
#
# "<a href="misc/okopnik/colsel.bash.txt">colsel</a>" - a term color selector

# Restore original term settings on exit
trap 'reset' 0

# Cycle the background color set
for n in `seq 40 47`
do
	# Cycle the foreground color set
        for m in `seq 30 37`
                do
                echo -en "\E[$m;${n}m"
		# Redraw screen with new color set
                clear
		echo -n "The selected colors are "
		# Set the colors to black and white for readability
                echo -en "\E[37;40m"
		# Show the settings
                echo $n $m
                sleep 1
        done
done

</pre>

<p>
This little script will run through the gamut of colors of which
your terminal is capable. Just remember the number combos that
appeal to you, and use them in your "echo -e '\E[&lt;bg&gt;;&lt;fg&gt;m'" statements.
</p>

<p>
Note that the positions of the numbers within the statement
don't matter; also note that some combinations will make your text
into unreadable gibberish ("12" seems to do that on most xterms).
Don't let it bother you; just type "reset" or "tput sgr0" and hit
"Enter".
</p>

<h3>Wrapping it Up</h3>

<p>
Hmm, I seem to have made it through all of the above without
<em>too</em> much pain or suffering; amazing. :) Yes, some of the
areas of Linux still have a ways to go... but that's one of the
really exciting things about it: they <em>are</em> changing and going
places. Given the amazing diversity of projects people are working
on, I wouldn't be surprised to see someone come up with an elegant
solution to the color code/attribute mess - or come up with something that
eliminates the whole problem.
</p>

<p>
Next month, we'll cover things like sourcing functions (pretty
exciting stuff - reusable code!), and some really nifty goodies
like "eval" and "trap". Until then -
</p>

<p>
Happy Linuxing to all!
