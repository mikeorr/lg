The design of compilers/interpreters is a challenging field - one
which offers a lot of scope for theoretical exploration as well
as hands on coding. Being a Python fan, I tried to implement some
of the ideas which I am learning about compilers/interpreters
in this beautiful language. As I am neither a Python Guru nor
a compiler expert, the implementation may be imperfect. But it
was certainly lots of fun!

<H2> A simple language </H2>
Don't be disappointed when I tell you that we are not going to
discuss the implementation of an Object Oriented, functional
language with automatic garbage collection and the works! The
language I am talking about here is the one which we learn as
kids, the language of arithmetic expressions. For example,
<pre>

1+2*3-4
1/2+3-4/5
.....
</pre>
We will start with a program which will read an expression of
this form and evaluate it directly. We will then modify this program
to generate a data structure called a parse tree which can then
be evaluated by recursive algorithms. The next step is to generate
instructions for a virtual machine using this parse tree. The last
step is to store these virtual machine instructions on disk 
and run it with an interpreter when required.

<H2> Context-free grammars </H2>
<p>
Programming languages are often described using a compact and
powerful notation called a Context-free Grammar. The grammar
describes a set of substitutions. Here is a grammar for arithmetic
expressions:
<pre>

E ::= T { ADDOP T }
T ::= F { MULOP F }
F ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | .....
ADDOP ::= + | -
MULOP ::= * | /

</pre>
Assume that E stands for expression, T stands for term and F
stands for factor. The curly brace denotes 'zero or more repetitions'.
Reading the first production, we would say that "An expression is
a term, followed by zero or more repetitions of the combination of
an adding operator and a term." The third production says that a
factor is either 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 and so on, ie, the whole
set of positive integers. It takes some time to get used to
esoteric definitions like this, but if we have a basic understanding
of recursive structures, it is not very difficult.

<H2> A simple expression evaluator </H2>
<p>
Here is the source for a simple expression evaluator in Python.
(<A HREF="misc/pramode/listing1.py.txt">text version</A>)
<pre>

#--------------------A simple expression evaluator---------------#

import re, string
Inputbuf = []
	
# A token is either a number or an operator symbol. 
# The main program reads a line from the input and
# stores it in an array called Inputbuf. The function
# gettoken() returns individual tokens from this array.

def gettoken(): 
	global Inputbuf
	p = re.search('^\W*[\+\-\*/]|^\W*[0-9]+', Inputbuf)
	token = p.string[p.regs[0][0]:p.regs[0][1]]
	token = string.strip(token)
	if token not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
		token = int(token)
	Inputbuf = Inputbuf[p.regs[0][1]:]
	return token
	

# lookahead() peeks into the input stream and tells you what
# the next input token is
	
def lookahead():
	global Inputbuf
	try:
		p = re.search('^\W*[\+\-\*/]|^\W*[0-9]+', Inputbuf)
		token = p.string[p.regs[0][0]:p.regs[0][1]]
		token = string.strip(token)
		if token not in ['+', '-', '*', '/']:
			token = int(token)
		return token
	except:
		return None

	
def factor():
	return gettoken()


def term():
	e1 = factor()
	tmp = lookahead()
	while (tmp in ['*', '/']):
		gettoken()
		if (tmp == '*'):
			e1 = e1 * factor()
		else:
			e1 = e1 / factor()
		tmp = lookahead()

	return e1

	
def expression():
	e1 = term()
	tmp = lookahead()
	while (tmp in ['+', '-']):
		gettoken()
		if (tmp == '+'):
			e1 = e1 + term()
		else: 
			e1 = e1 - term()
		tmp = lookahead()
	
	return e1

	
def main():
	global Inputbuf
	Inputbuf = raw_input()
	print expression()

	
if __name__=='__main__':
	main()

</pre>

It would be good to trace the execution of the above code for some
simple expressions. 


<H2> Producing a parse tree </H2>
<p>
The above program simply evaluates the given infix arithmetic 
expression. We are now going to modify it to produce a parse
tree instead. A parse tree for the expression 1+2*3 would
look like this:
<pre>
			+
		       / \
		      /   \
		     1     *
		     	  / \
		         /   \
                         2   3	     
</pre>


Each node of the tree consists of the following fields:
<ol>
<li> 'op' or 'number' depending on whether the node is an
      internal node or a leaf node
<li>  A link to the 'left child' called 'left'
<li>  A link to the 'right child' called 'right'
</ol>

The tree is built from the bottom up. The function 'factor'
simply creates a new tree node with a number in it, initializes
the left and right pointers to NULL, and returns the node. The
function 'expression()' creates a new node with an operator
'+' or '-' as the value of the 'op' field and assigns the left
and right pointers to values obtained by calling 'term()'.
Function 'term()' works in a similar way.

	return left

	if (ptree):
		try:
			print ptree.op
		except:
			print ptree.number
		treeprint(ptree.left)
		treeprint(ptree.right)
		
def main():
	global Inputbuf
	Inputbuf = raw_input()
	ptree = expression()
	return ptree
	
if __name__=='__main__':
	ptree = main()
	treeprint(ptree)
</pre>

<H2> Building a stack machine </H2>
<p>
The parse tree which we have created can be easily evaluated by
writing a recursive function. But we will adopt a different
method. We will generate code for evaluating expressions in the
instruction set of a simple hypothetical machine called a 
'stack machine'. The instructions which this machine has are very
simple - push a number on to the stack, add two numbers, multiply
two numbers etc. Thus, evaluation of the expression 1+2*3 yields the
following code:
<pre>
push 1 
push 2 
push 3
mul 
add
</pre>
These instructions are stored in an array. Push, mul, add etc are
functions. The instructions may be directly executed by walking
through the array and executing the functions held by each array
element or they may stored in a disk file (an easy way is to
use the Python pickle module, though it is a waste of space). 
Another program may then read this
code into an array and execute it. The code which I have written
works like this: If you run the program without any filename 
argument, it reads an expression from the keyboard, generates
code for the virtual machine in an array and executes it by
walking through the array. The code is also stored in a file
called 'code.out'. Now if you run the program with a file name
argument code.out, it loads the instructions from the file
and executes it, without reading from the keyboard.

</pre>
'generate()' and 'eval()' are the critical functions. 'generate()'
walks through the expression tree creating the virtual machine code
and storing it in an array 'Code'. 'eval()' walks through the array
'Code' executing the instructions, using an array 'Stack' for 
holding the partial results.

<H2> Conclusion </H2>
<p>
It is possible to extend the above program to handle variables
and assignment statements, control flow constructs like gotos,
if statements etc. Soon, you would be building a simple Basic-like
language. 
<p>
Coming from a C background, Python's lack of certain C constructs
like the ++ operator is a minor irritation. The lack of compile
time type declarations also seems to have some detrimental effects
upon code readability. Also, you will pay dearly for any typo. 
If you have a variable 'f' of type 'struct foo' and 'foo' does not
have a field called 'next', an assignment to 'f.next' will generate a
compile time error in C whereas the Python interpreter would gladly
allow the assignment to go through.
<p>

<H2> References </H2>
The standard book on compiler design is 'Principles of Compiler Design' by 
Aho A.V and Ullman J.D. The inspiration for this article came from 'The Practice of
Programming', another excellent book by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike.
The 'generate' and 'eval' functions are Python renderings of code
from this book. 'A Second course in Computer Science with Pascal' by Daniel D. McCracken
presents several algorithms, including an expression evaluator, in a very engaging style.
