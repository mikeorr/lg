<h1>Inter-Process Communication - Part 1</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/ramankutty.html">Hiran Ramankutty</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this article is to get the readers familiar with the different 
mechanisms that are available for communicating between two or more processes. 
This may also serve as a tutorial for the novice programmer. There might be 
several good tutorials on this subject, but here I will try to communicate my 
explorations of this subject. This article may not be technically perfect. 
Please send your suggestions and queries to <img src="../gx/authors/email/ramankutty.png">.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Inter-Process Communication, which in short is known as IPC, deals mainly with 
the techniques and mechanisms that facilitate communication between 
processes. Now, why do we need special separate mechanisms or techniques for 
communicating between processes? Why isn't it possible to have information 
shared between two processes without using such special mechanisms?
</p>

<p>
Let us start from something primitive. Imagine you have two glasses completely 
filled with water. One glass contains hot water and the other contains cold 
water. What can you do to make the temperature of water in both the glasses 
equal? The simplest answer will be to mix the water from both the glasses 
in a glass with much bigger capacity. Once water is mixed, the temperature 
becomes equal after some time. If one can remember, this will be framed as a 
problem with some numerical data in a High-School Physics examination. If we go 
by principles, then the phenomenon here is conduction. If we go by our topic of 
IPC, then we can say that since the two glasses were full, we had to use another 
glass with a larger capacity to mix the contents in order to balance their heat energy.
</p>
<p>
Have you ever wondered about the communication medium used in telephones? What 
about the blood transporting system in the human body which communicates 
blood to different parts of the body? What about my fingers which are
typing this document? My brain is doing so many things at a time. How is it
directing one of my fingers to hit one key and some other finger to hit
another key? How is it synchronizing the typing work that is done by both
my hands? How is it also directing me to type the letters of a word that
are actually coming to my mind?
</p>

<p>
Don't worry. I am not going to give a class in Biology. But it would be good if 
one can imagine a few more situations where we are using inter-process 
communication, though not necessarily in the human body or in a computer 
program. 
</p>

<p>
So, where are we now? We know that some medium or other is required for 
communication between different processes. Similarly, when it comes to computer 
programs, we need some mechanism or medium for communication. Primarily, 
processes can use the available memory to communicate with each other. But 
then, the memory is completely managed by the operating system. A process will 
be allotted some part of the available memory for execution. Then each process 
will have its own unique user space. In no way will the memory allotted for
one process overlap with the memory allotted for another process. Imagine
what would happen otherwise!
</p>

<p>
So, now the question - how do different processes with unique address space 
communicate with each other? The operating system's kernel, which has access to 
all the memory available, will act as the communication channel. Similar to
our earlier example, where the glass with hot water is one process address
space, the glass with cold water is another, and the glass with the larger
capacity is the kernel address space, so that we pour both hot water and
cold water into the glass with larger capacity.
</p>

<p>
What next? There are different IPC mechanisms which come into use based on the
different requirements. In terms of our water glasses, we can determine the
specifics of both pouring the water into the larger glass and how it will
be used after beign poured.
</p>

<h2>Basic IPC</h2>

<p>
OK, enough of glasses and water. The IPC mechanisms can be 
classified into the following categories as given below:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>pipes 
<li>fifos
<li>shared memory
<li>mapped memory
<li>message queues
<li>sockets
</ol>

<h2>Pipes</h2>

<p>
Pipes were evolved in the most primitive forms of the Unix operating system. 
They provide unidirectional flow of communication between processes within the same 
system. In other words, they are half-duplex, that is, data flows in only one 
direction. A pipe is created by invoking the <tt>pipe</tt> system call,
which creates a pair of file descriptors. These descriptors 
point to a pipe inode and the file descriptors are returned through the 
<tt>filedes</tt> argument. In the file descriptor pair, <tt>filedes[0]</tt> is 
used for reading whereas <tt>filedes[1]</tt> is used for writing. 
</p>
<p>
Let me explain a scenario where we can use the <tt>pipe</tt> system call: 
consider a keyboard-reader program which simply exits after any alpha-numeric 
character is pressed on the keyboard. We will create two processes; one of 
them will read characters from the keyboard, and the other will
continuously check for alpha-numeric characters.  Let us see how the
<tt>filedes</tt> returned by <tt>pipe</tt> can be of use in this scenario:

/***** KEYBOARD HIT PROGRAM *****/
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int filedes[2];

void *read_char()
{
	char c;
	printf("Entering routine to read character.........\n");
	while(1) {
		/* Get a character in 'c' except '\n'. */
		c = getchar();
		if(c == '\n')
			c = getchar();
		write(filedes[1], &amp;c, 1);
		if(isalnum(c)) {
			sleep(2);
			exit(1);
		}
	}
}

void *check_hit()
{
	char c;
	printf("Entering routine to check hit.........\n");
	while(1) {
		read(filedes[0], &amp;c, 1);
		if(isalnum(c)) {
			printf("The key hit is %c\n", c);
			exit(1);
		} else {
			printf("key hit is %c\n", c);
		}
	}
}
		
int main()
{
	int i;
	pthread_t tid1, tid2;
	pipe(filedes);
	/* Create thread for reading characters. */
	i = pthread_create(&amp;tid1, NULL, read_char, NULL);
	/* Create thread for checking hitting of any keyboard key. */
	i = pthread_create(&amp;tid2, NULL, check_hit, NULL);
	if(i == 0) while(1);
	return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
Save and compile the program as <tt>cc filename.c -lpthread</tt>. Run the 
program and check the results. Try hitting a different key every time.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>read_char</tt> function simply reads a character other than '\n' from 
the keyboard and writes it to <tt>filedes[1]</tt>. We have the thread 
<tt>check_hit</tt>, which continuously checks for the character in 
<tt>filedes[0]</tt>. If the character in <tt>filedes[0]</tt> is an 
alpha-numeric character, then the character is printed and the program 
terminates. 
</p>

<p>
One major feature of <b>pipe</b> is that the data flowing through the 
communication medium is transient, that is, data once read from the read 
descriptor cannot be read again. Also, if we write data continuously into the 
write descriptor, then we will be able to read the data only in the order in 
which the data was written. One can experiment with that by doing successive 
<tt>write</tt>s or <tt>read</tt>s to the respective descriptors.
</p>

<p>
So, what happens when the <tt>pipe</tt> system call is invoked? A good look at 
the manual entry for <tt>pipe</tt> suggests that it creates a pair of file
descriptors. This suggests that the kernel implements <tt>pipe</tt> within
the file system. However, <tt>pipe</tt> does not actually exist as such -
so when the call is made, the kernel allocates free inodes and creates a
pair of file descriptors as well as the corresponding entries in the file
table which the kernel uses. Hence, the kernel enables the user to use the
normal file operations like <tt>read, write</tt>, etc., which the user does
through the file descriptors. The kernel makes sure that one of the
descriptors is for reading and another one if for writing.
</p>

<p>
I am not going to go into the details of the <tt>pipe</tt> implementation on the 
kernel side. For further reading, one can refer the books mentioned at the end 
of this article.
</p>

<h2>FIFOs</h2>

<p>
<b>FIFOs</b> (first in, first out) are similar to the working of <b>pipes</b>. 
<b>FIFOs</b> also provide half-duplex flow of data just like <b>pipes</b>. The 
difference between <b>fifos</b> and <b>pipes</b> is that the former is 
identified in the file system with a name, while the latter is not. That is, 
<b>fifos</b> are named pipes. <b>Fifos</b> are identified by an access 
point which is a file within the file system, whereas <b>pipes</b> are 
identified by an access point which is simply an allotted inode. Another 
major difference between <b>fifos</b> and <b>pipes</b> is that <b>fifos</b> 
last throughout the life-cycle of the system, while <b>pipes</b> last only 
during the life-cycle of the process in which they were created. To make it 
more clear, <b>fifos</b> exist beyond the life of the process. Since they are 
identified by the file system, they remain in the hierarchy until explicitly 
removed using <tt>unlink</tt>, but <b>pipes</b> are inherited only by related 
processes, that is, processes which are descendants of a single process. 
</p>

<p>
Let us see how a <tt>fifo</tt> can be used to detect a keypress, just as we
did with pipes. The same program where we previously used a <tt>pipe</tt>
can be modified and implemented using a <tt>fifo</tt>.

<p>
Compile this program using <tt>cc -o write_fifo filename.c</tt>. This program 
reads characters (keypresses), and writes them into the special file 
<b>fifo</b>. First the program creates a <b>fifo</b> with read-write 
permissions using the function <tt>mkfifo</tt>. See the manual page for the 
same. If the <b>fifo</b> exists, then <tt>mkfifo</tt> will return the 
corresponding error, which is set in <tt>errno</tt>. The thread 
<tt>read_char</tt> continuously tries to read characters from the keyboard. 
</p>
<cite>Note that the fifo is opened with the <tt>O_WRONLY</tt> (write only) flag
</cite>.
<p>
Once it reads a character other than '\n', it writes the same into the write 
end of the <b>fifo</b>. The program that detects it is given below: (text

<p>
Here, again, it first tries to create a <b>fifo</b> which is created if it does 
not exist. We then have the thread <tt>check_hit</tt> which tries to read 
characters from the <b>fifo</b>. If the read character is alphanumeric, 
the program terminates; otherwise the thread continues reading 
characters from the <b>fifo</b>.
</p>
<cite>Here, the <b>fifo</b> is opened with the flag <tt>O_RDONLY</tt></cite>.

<p>
Compile this program with <tt>cc -o detect_hit filename.c</tt>. Now run the two 
executables in separate terminals, but in the same working directory. 
Irrespective of the order in which you run, look for the message <b>fifo 
already exists</b> on the console. The first program (either of the two) that 
you run will not give any error message for creation of the <b>fifo</b>. The 
second program that you run will definitely give you the error for creation of 
the <b>fifo</b>. In the terminal where you run <tt>write_fifo</tt>, give input 
to standard output from your keyboard. You will get the message regarding the 
key hit on the keyboard on the terminal running the executable 
<tt>detect_hit</tt>. Analyze the working of the two programs by hitting several 
keys.
</p>

<p>
I have used two different programs for exhibiting the usage of <b>fifos</b>. 
This can be done within a single program by forking the routines which are 
called in the two program as threads. But I did this to show that unlike 
<b>pipes</b>, <b>fifos</b> can be used for communication between unrelated 
processes.
</p>

<p>
Now try running the program again. You will get the message that the 
<b>fifo</b> already exists even when you first run either of the two programs. 
This shows that <b>fifos</b> are persistent as long as the system lives. That 
is, the <b>fifos</b> will have to be removed manually - otherwise they will be 
permanently recognized by the file system. This is unlike <b>pipes</b> which 
are inherited as long as the process that created the <b>pipe</b> is running. 
Once this process dies, the kernel also removes the identifiers (file 
descriptors) for the <b>pipe</b> from the the file tables.
</p>

<p>
The usage is rather simple and the main advantage is that there is no need for 
any synchronization mechanism for accesses to the <b>fifo</b>. There are 
certain disadvantages: they can only be used for communication between 
processes running on the same host machine. Let us explore other IPC mechanisms 
to see what have they in store.
</p>

<h2>Shared Memory</h2>

<p>
Shared Memory is one of the three kinds of System V IPC mechanism which enables 
different processes to communicate with each other as if these processes 
shared the virtual address space; hence, any process sharing the memory 
region can read or write to it. One can imagine some part of memory 
being set aside for use by different processes.
</p>

<p>
The System V IPC describes the use of the shared memory mechanism as
consisting of four steps. Taken in order, they are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fetching an identifier for the shared memory area - <tt>shmget</tt> (shared 
memory get)
<li>Using the identifier to get the shared memory address - <tt>shmat</tt> 
(shared memory attach),
<li>Detaching the shared memory area after use - <tt>shmdt</tt> (shared 
memory detach) and 
<li>Finally using the address to control accesses, permissions, receive 
information and destroy the shared memory area - <tt>shmctl</tt> (shared 
memory control).
</ul>

<p>
Let us examine the workings of the above system calls. Recall the keyboard
hit program; we shall, once again, see another version of it, this time
using the system calls associated with the shared memory mechanism.
</p>

<p>
The code given below creates a shared memory area and stores the
information of any key hit on the keyboard. Let us see the code first:
(text version: <a 
href="misc/ramankutty/write-shm.c.txt">write-shm.c.txt</a>)
</p>
<pre class="code">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/shm.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

extern int errno;

#define SIZE	1

char *read_key;
int shmid;

int shared_init()
{
	if((shmid = shmget(9999, SIZE, IPC_CREAT | 0666)) &lt; 0) {
		printf("Error in shmget. errno is: %d\n", errno);
		return -1;
	}
	if((read_key = shmat(shmid, NULL, 0)) &lt; 0) {
		printf("Error in shm attach. errno is: %d\n", errno);
		return -1;
	}
	return 0;
}

void read_char()
{
	char c;
	while(1) {
		c = getchar();
		if(c == '\n') {
			c = getchar();
		}
		strncpy(read_key, &amp;c, SIZE);
		printf("read_key now is %s\n", read_key);
		if(isalnum(*read_key)) {
			shmdt(read_key);
			shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
			exit(1);
		}
	}
}

int main()
{
	if(shared_init() &lt; 0) {
		printf("Problems with shared memory\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	read_char();
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Here we have a shared memory variable named <tt>read_key</tt>. The program 
first initializes the shared memory area <tt>read_key</tt>. This is done by 
generating a shared memory identifier <tt>shmid</tt> using the system call 
<tt>shmget</tt>. In the context of the program, the first parameter for 
<tt>shmget</tt> is <b>9999</b>, which is the key. This key is used to allocate 
a shared memory segment. The second parameter, <tt>SIZE</tt> (defined as a 
macro with the value 1), suggests that the shared memory segment will hold only 
one of the type of the shared memory variable, that is, only 1 character. The 
<tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> flag (third parameter) suggests that a new shared memory 
segment has to be created, with read-write permissions (<tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> 
logically OR ed with <b>0666</b>). This will return a valid shared memory 
segment identifier on successful allocation. The identifier will be stored in 
<tt>shmid</tt>. If shared memory segment allocation fails, then -1 is returned 
and the <tt>errno</tt> is set appropriately. 
</p>
<cite>The key which is used to get a shared memory segment can be generated 
randomly using the built-in function <tt>ftok</tt> to get a unique key. Refer 
to the manual page for the usage.
</cite>

<p>
Once the segment identifier is obtained, we have to attach the shared memory 
segment to some address. This is done with the <tt>shmat</tt> system call. 
This uses the segment identifier <tt>shmid</tt> as the first parameter. The 
second parameter is the address of the shared memory segment; when this is 
given as <tt>NULL</tt> (as in this program), the kernel will choose a
suitable address. The third parameter is the flag specification which can
be set if required or left as zero (see man page of <tt>shmdt</tt> for
details). On success the shared memory segment is attached to
<tt>read_key</tt>, otherwise -1 is returned along with the appropriate
setting of the <tt>errno</tt>.
</p>

<p>
If either <tt>shmget</tt> or <tt>shmat</tt> fails, the process terminates. On 
success from both system calls, we proceed by invoking the
<tt>read_char</tt> function, which reads keyboard inputs other than '\n'
("Enter" key) and copies them to <tt>read_key</tt> in the shared
memory. If the keyboard input is an alphanumeric character, the
program stops reading inputs from the keyboard and the process
terminates.
</p>

<p>
We have another program running separately (it does not have to be in the
same working directory) in the local system, which tries to read the data
written in the shared memory area. The code is given below: (text version:
<a href="misc/ramankutty/read-shm.c.txt">read-shm.c.txt</a>)
</p>
<pre class="code">

		return -1;
	}
	if((detect_key = shmat(shmid, NULL, SHM_RDONLY)) &lt; 0) {
		printf("Error in shm attach. errno is: %d\n", errno);
		return -1;
	}
//	detect_key = NULL;
	return 0;
}

void detect_hit()
{
	char c;
	c = *detect_key;
	while(1) {
		if(c != *detect_key) {
			if(isalnum(detect_key[0])) {
				printf("detect_key is %s\n", detect_key);
				shmdt(detect_key);
				shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
				exit(1);
			} else {
				printf("detect_key is %s\n", detect_key);
			}
			c = *detect_key;
		}
	}
}

int main()
{
	if(shared_init() &lt; 0) {
		printf("Problems with shared memory\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	detect_hit();
	return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>
Here, again, we have a shared memory initialization routine, which in fact does 
not create a new shared memory segment, but rather tries to get access to 
the existing shared memory segment. Compared to the previous program, the 
absence of <tt>IPC_CREAT</tt> flag suggests that we do not have to create a new 
shared memory segment. Instead, we simply have to get the corresponding 
segment identifier which can be used to attach the existing shared memory 
segment to some address. The mode <b>0444</b> restricts access to 
the shared memory segment to 'read only'. If no shared memory segment 
with key <b>9999</b> exists, we will get an error, which will be returned
in <b>errno</b>. Once we get a valid identifier, we attach the 
shared memory segment to an address. While attaching, we use the flag 
<tt>SHM_RDONLY</tt> which specifies that the shared memory segment will
be available only for reading.
</p>

<p>
Next, we have the function <b>detect_hit</b>, which checks whether the
pressed key was an alphanumeric character. The first program obviously has
to run first; otherwise, the second program will show errors during the shared
memory initialization, since it would be trying to get the identifier for a
non-existent shared memory segment.
</p>

<p>
The example shown here doesn't require any synchronization of access to the
shared memory segment. That is because only one program writes into the
shared memory and only one program reads from the shared memory area.  But
again, there is a problem here. What if the detection program (second one)
is started long after some user has started hitting the keys (running the
first program)? We will not be able to track the previously hit keys.
The solution for this is left as an exercise to the readers. 
</p>

<cite>The entry in <tt>/proc/sysvipc/shm</tt> gives a list of shared mermory in 
use. Readers can compare the entries before running, during running and after 
running the programs. Try to interpret the entry in <tt>/proc/sysvipc/shm</tt>.
</cite>

<p>
Once the two programs identify an alphanumeric character, they will
terminate. As part of that process, the shared memory area is detached by
using the system call <tt>shmdt</tt>. In fact, upon exiting the detaching
is done automatically. But the shared memory segment is not destroyed. This
has to be done by invoking the system call <tt>shmctl</tt>, which takes
the identifier for the shared memory area as an argument, as well as the command
<tt>IPC_RMID</tt>, which marks the shared memory segment as destroyed. This
has to be done, otherwise the shared memory segment will persist in memory
or in the swap space.
</p>
<cite>At this point, observation of the entries in
<tt>/proc/sysvipc/shm</tt> can be very useful.  If the shared memory
segment is not destroyed, the entries will reflect this. Try this by
running the program without <tt>shmctl</tt>.
</cite>

<p>
This is the fastest IPC mechanism in the System V IPC services. However,
the System V shared memory mechanism does not have any kind of scheme to
ensure that one sees consistent data in the shared memory region.  That is,
a process can read a shared memory area at the same time another process is
writing to it. The programmer can then come across inconsistent data while
executing the programs. This suggests that accesses to the shared memory
region have to be mutually exclusive; this is achieved via the use of the
semaphore mechanism. We can make the semaphore access the memory region to
lock it and then release the semaphore when done.
</p>

<p>
The shared memory mechanism can be used when the processes access the shared 
memory areas at different times. One may wonder why we can't make the
first process store the data in some file and make another process read the
data from the file. But, reading data from a file involves things like:
</p>
<ul>
<li>execution of system calls like <tt>open, read</tt> and <tt>close</tt>.
<li>accessing the secondary storage device (generally hard disk) which involves 
I/O operations.
</ul>

<p>
These things are not significant if we have a small amount of data to be
read. But when we have large amounts of data stored in a file, 
then the load of the two activities mentioned above increases 
significantly and there is a considerable amount of reduction in the 
performance of the "reading program". This, again, has a solution, which is the 
use of memory mapping - something I'll discuss at another time. 
</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
We have seen the use of the primary IPC mechanisms, and also one of the System 
V IPC mechanisms. We have seen some simple uses for <b>pipes, fifos</b>, and the
<b>shared memory</b> mechanism. But one may come across some very complex 
programs where these mechanisms will have to be used in a very strict and
precise manner.  Otherwise, the program along with the programmer, will be
dumped to <tt>/dev/null</tt>. There are still more things to be learned,
not only for you but also for me. I shall come up with more in the next
part, in which we will explore <b>semaphores</b>, <b>message queues</b>,
<b>memory mapping</b> and <b>sockets</b>, and probably try to solve a few
practical problems.
