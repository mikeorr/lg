Any particular reason for not just using a tool, which already exists
- such as Unison (<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/</a>) which is
cross platform/OS ?

I also thought of the same thing as I started reading the article.

<p>
However, you should be aware of some of the issues that "unison" has
with USB drives. (see <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/349674">http://bugs.debian.org/349674</a>)

I recall hearing about Unison a while back; exploring the above URL now
gives me the impression that it doesn't do what the article proposes
 - i.e., sync between an HD and a pen drive. Instead, it appears to
require two active hosts, at least according to the description at the
site:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be
stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host),
modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the
changes in each replica to the other.
</pre>
and further on:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
Unison works between any pair of machines connected to the internet,
communicating over either a direct socket link or tunneling over an
encrypted ssh connection. It is careful with network bandwidth, and runs
well over slow links such as PPP connections. Transfers of small updates
to large files are optimized using a compression protocol similar to
rsync.
</pre>
Unison's site also says:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
These binaries depend on glibc 2.3.
 
The gtk2 UI binaries additionally depend on GTK+ 2.
</pre>
I just downloaded the (rather large) binary and manual and have tried to
compile it... oops, it also requires installing OCaml and 'etags' for
compilation, and LablGtk along with GTK+ 2 if you want a GUI - and OCaml
alone is 38MB. I think I'll skip all of that; experimenting with it
sounds like a major pain. Given Gerrit's script - 23kB including
comments, nothing to compile, using what most people already have on
their systems, <strong>and</strong> cross-platform as well - your question appears to
have answered itself.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Well, the description you mention yourself, does in fact explicitly
state two disks on one host:
</p>


<p>
<pre>
&gt; It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be
&gt; stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host),
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Think of it as a tool to synchronize two locations which just happen
to not have not to reside on the same host.
</p>

<p>
With regards to size requirements, then doing apt-get install unison
on Debian Sarge starts a download of 454kb which is not too bad in my
opinion - this obviously excludes the GUI part.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, unison comes prepackaged for Cygwin as well in different
(379kb for version 2.9.1 which matches the version available in
Sarge).
</p>

<p>
No need to compile anything.
</p>

<p>
While I fully understand the author's reason(s) to do it himself, when
it comes to areas such as backup and replication, I would rather go
for a solution in active use by thousands, which has undergone serious
testing - not to belittle Gerrit's efforts.
</p>

<p>
But hey - choice is what free software is all about anyway!

<p>
Both of the above scenarios, though, presume an "active" connection -
either via a direct hardware connection (two disks on the same machine)
or a network connection. That is, Unison needs to be able to update its
"private structures" (as mentioned at the site) in the 'remote' copy at
the time that the transfer is made. However, in the scenario described,
that's not an option: the host on which the remote copy is to reside may
be as yet uknown... or for that matter may not yet exist. Not something
that Unison can handle - at least going by the description. This makes
Gerrit's script very useful indeed, and for exactly the purpose that he
stated.

<p>
You're right - I'd missed that option, since the only pointer to Unison
I had was the page you cited.

That was my point from the start (as it usually is, in this kind of
discussions.) I'm glad to see that we agree. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Hi Peter,
</p>

<p>
I have used unison but found it complicated to use.
What you expressed below is also known as a Perl of Wisdom: "There is More Than One Way To Do It".
</p>

<p>
If you have these considerations, why don't you write an article about your
proposed backup solution - it would make an interesting follow-up to the article.
</p>


<p>
And ... writing should not at all be an issue for you -- since you already have the same 
name as my second favourite Danish author (the first being Peter Freuchen). 
</p>

<p>
So - no excuses, get those pencils sharpened ;-)

Gerrit,
</p>

<p>
well, I guess you know that it is a lot easier to criticize other
people's work than creating your own, so I think I will stick to
pointing out flaws in articles written by others instead of doing any
actual work myself... ;-)
</p>

<p>
I thought the perl saying was: WTTERWYCWIAFSIP   (Why Take The Easy
Road When You Can Write It All From Scratch In Perl)
</p>

<p>
But I guess you are right, I probably should write something up.

Ben, does LWN only post exclusive pieces? Because if I do write
something up, I would want to post it on www.debian-administration.org
as well.

The idea of using a USB drive to move files between systems is not new,
but was a big improvement over CD-R transfer. Your idea of automating
the sync function is another significant step up. However, is there any
way to extend this to other systems?
</p>

<p>
At work I have MS-W2KPro on my workstation (w/Cygwin and ActiveState
Perl), while my development targets are an eclectic mix of MS-Windows,
FC5, RHEL-AS4, Xinu, FreeBSD and a couple of proprietary kernels. At
home I use Slackware for servers and workstations. I do have VNC/SSH
access between the home systems and the workstation, but TightVNC
doesn't appear to support file transfers between MS-Windows and Linux.
How difficult will it be to modify this package to at least synchronize
files between the workstation and Slackware?
</p>

<p>
Note that while I do know some basic Perl, I do not do abstraction well.
I am most fluent in assembler and C since most of my work for the past
25 years has been for embedded targets.

Thank you,

Even without examining the script in microscopic detail, a reasonably

did, thus making it accessible from both Linux and Wind0ws.
