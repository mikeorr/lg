      <p>
        <b>OLinux: First of all, tell us about your background.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      I am generally speaking a programmer and systems
      administrator. In the past I have also worked as a Desktop
      Publisher and a web designer. I've worked for NASA LaRC,
      several ISPs and currently am working at 
      <A HREF="http://www.winstar.com">Winstar</A>
      .</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Please give a brief summary of 
	<A HREF="http://www.debian.org">Debian</A>'s History, Philosophy
        and Organization on handling free software development?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      Our philosophy goes back a long way. Mainly we believe that
      it <EM>is</EM> possible to create a completely free operating system
      with all of the things you need to do your daily work. That's
      what started Debian, and prompted Ian Murdock to write the
      Debian Manifesto. From there began our project, and from it
      has come the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG), which
      defines the type of software licensing we consider to be Free
      in the sense of Freedom. Also came the Debian Social
      Contract, which defines what we will support for our users.
      Later, as we grew, came our Constitution, which defines our
      operating procedures, and breakdown of authority within the
      project.</p>

      <p>We've basically given full control of each package to the
      maintainer of that package, so long as it falls within the
      guidelines of our well defined Policy. Our Policy is one of
      the strengths of the Debian distribution. Without it, we
      would not have a cohesive set of packages, and
      installs/upgrades would be a nightmare.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How excited you are about being in front of the
        Debian Project? Do you have something in mind for the
        Debian Project? Are you going to make changes on the way
        the work is done?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      I'm extremely excited. This is my third run at the DPL
      position, and it is a goal I have finally achieved thanks
      completely to those in the project that have faith in my
      ability to handle the job. I have plans to clean up some
      loose ends that have been plaguing our internal organisation
      for some time. After this, I plan to tackle some of the more
      difficult situations that still linger, or are threatening to
      be a problem in the near future.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What are going to be the differences between your
        leadership and the predecessor's?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      When I first came to Debian, Ian Jackson was finishing his
      term as DPL, and he was very inactive (to his defense, I do
      not know any details of his situation). Wichert then followed
      for two terms. I believe he did an excellent job keeping
      Debian going. However, my plans are to get Debian moving
      rather than continue to limp along with some of the problems
      we face.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How are people organized and what are the tools
        used to control the results of the work being done in
        different projects and parts of the world?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      Within Debian, we have the maintainers (some 800 it seems
      now). Each of them is responsible for maintaining one or more
      packages (some do not maintain packages, but help with other
      projects internally, such as ftp archive, www site, etc.).
      They have complete control of their tasks within the
      guidelines and policy. Within this, some developers have
      grouped together to manage large specific tasks. Examples of
      this are the Debian Junior project, as well as the ports (such
      as sparc, arm, alapha, powerpc, etc.) and language
      projects.</p>

      <p>All work is coordinated via mailing lists. Some people
      also use IRC as a way of immediate interaction (via
      irc.openprojects.net). We also have the Debian Bug Tracking
      System to manage bug reports for all of our packages and
      systems. This system is available publicly via our web
      pages. Anyone can file a bug, and track it's progress
      directly with the maintainer.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How many people are working for Debian nowadays?
        Are you satisfied with the results?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      Last I checked, about 800. I am satisfied with the results.
      What I am not satisfied with is the influx of maintainers
      without a better scheme to manage them. Work is being done,
      but I want to see some other things in this area discussed
      and looked at.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What do you think about people saying that the
        Debian 2.2 has too much bugs? What are you going to do in
        "Woody" to change this point of view?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      I was not aware that people said that. We have an excellent
      security team that fixes all known security related bugs. We
      also make regular point releases (2.2r3 is being worked on as
      I write this) to update the security patches into a new
      release. For woody we have a new "testing" mechanism which
      should help reduce the amount of time needed to release.
      Hopefully this will make more frequent releases possible.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What are your expectations about the "Woody"
        launch?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      I look forward to a lot of the things that are going to be
      available in woody. Woody also promises to be the most
      architectures we have ever released at one time (by any
      distribution, that I am aware of).</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What are the active projects at Debian? How are
        they divided and coordinated in terms of content and staff
        for each project?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      Usually a project within Debian creates itself to fill a
      need. The project manages itself, and delegates within its
      own ranks who is responsible for what tasks. I'm not aware
      of all such projects, simply because most of them work in the
      background, silently making Debian better.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Here, in Brazil, there is a project called 
        <a href="http://debian-br.sourceforge.net">
        Debian BR</a>

        . This is a project that is translating the Debian content
        to Portuguese. Do you know that? If yes, what do you think
        about it? If not, you are invited to visit the Debian BR
        web site at debian-br.sourceforge.net. Do you know other
        projects like this in other countries?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      I had not heard of it before. I think it is an excellent
      thing, much like the JP and similar projects. The more people
      we can get Debian to, the better. I'll have a look at the
      web site, and I wish the best of luck to the project for it's
      efforts.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Do you consider Debian the leading GNU/Linux
        distribution in the world?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      On many basis, yes. However, I measure Debian on what's
      important to me, and am well aware that it lacks in areas
      that are important to others. A recurring topic is our
      installer. I'm happy to report that a new modular installer
      is being worked on, and it so far appears to exceed, or will
      exceed, all of the goals that the group set for itself. It
      will probably not be done in time for woody, though.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How is Debian's relationship with the GNOME
        Foundation? And with the KDE league?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      I'm not able to answer this question. I do know that we have
      some developers that work closely with both projects, and
      that GNOME and KDE are both fully integrated within our
      distribution.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What are the advantages and what differentiates
        Debian from
        other popular distributions as SuSE or Red Hat, besides being a
	non-commercial distribution?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      I think we have three major strengths. One is our development
      model. No other distribution has all of its developers
      available first hand to take bug reports and suggestions from
      its user base.</p>

      <p>No other distribution has as extensive a set of policies
      that allows it to distribute as many packages as we do, all
      integrated into our distribution, with easy installation.</p>

      <p>No other distribution offers the ease of upgrades that we
      do. There have been reports of people being able to
      effortlessly upgrade from as far back as Debian 1.3 (bo) to
      the current stable 2.2 (potato) (note, this is a libc5 to
      libc6 upgrade path). Debian not only supports, but guarantees
      upgradability. It is one of our primary goals.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: How do you describe Debian Project achievements
        and what are the prospects and goals for the next
        years?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      The fact that Debian is still around, and is still growing is
      a major achievement. We have not lost site of our primary
      goals; to produce a free and stable distribution. Over the
      next few years I hope to see Debian prosper from commercial
      acceptance via companies like Progeny. I'm hoping that
      vendors will see us as a more viable solution for desktops
      and pre-installed systems.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Give us some predictions about the growth of the
        GNU/Linux operating system for the next 2, 5 and 10
        years.</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      That's hard to predict. Unfortunately, as free as it may be,
      GNU/Linux is directly affected by the economy. The current
      trend of Internet companies starting to fail, will likely
      scare away of a lot of the venture capital that has flooded
      Linux in the past years. Hopefully this will be a good thing,
      and the Linux companies will have to start working to make
      their money, and not ride the wave of hype. I would guess
      that over the next 2 years, Linux's hype will settle down,
      and people will start taking it more seriously (not just
      those in-the-know).</p>

      <p>In 5 years, I suspect that GNU/Linux will be as common as
      MacOS, Solaris and Windows in the home. In 10 years, who
      knows. That's like an eternity to the technical world, so
      Linux may be obsolete by then.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: What are the improvements that GNU/Linux needs
        to be more deployed in by the corporate market?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      An accepted, easy to use interface. KDE and GNOME are working
      toward this with great strides. But even with a good
      interface, getting accepted and being "common" take far
      longer than a development cycle.</p>

      <p>
        <b>OLinux: Debian is definitely the best Linux distro, but
        its hardware configuration interface and its installer are
        not so friendly. Is the Debian Project going to focus on a
        best interaction with the final user or it still a
        distribution for the systems administrators only?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
      <b>Ben Collins:</b>

      Yes, the debian-installer group is working very hard on this.
      We do not want to remain a niche distribution only used by
      administrators and hard-core hackers.</p>
