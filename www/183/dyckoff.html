<h1>Away Mission - RSA 2011</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>


<p>
  As usual, the annual RSA Conference is arguably the most comprehensive
one-stop forum in information security.  Although there are many
conferences  that are more technical, the breadth of the sessions and the
caliper of some speakers makes this a not-to-miss event for those
interested in the security of computer systems and networks. And, yes, RSA
has moved from March in recent years to February 14-18 this year. Happy
Valentines Day, hackers and crackers.
</p>

<p>
  There is a lot to do on RSA Monday - besides getting chocolate for your
significant other - and most of it is free with an Expo Pass.  And many
attending vendors will happily send you an Expo registration code.  I have
one listed below from Fortify.	   With the Expo Pass, the keynotes and
Town Hall events are available as well as several vendor-sponsored
sessions.  So come for Monday and come back if you can.  There are many
rewards for being a full attendee, or delegate, but the full freight will
be $2,195!  A Delegate One-Day Pass (Tue-Fri) costs a mere $995. See, 
Monday is a deal.
</p>

<p>
  So what's included??	First off, there is the all morning Cloud Security
Alliance Summit 2011. And in the afternoon there is the Innovation Sandbox
covering the best new security solutions - this actually requires a
Delegate Pass or an Expo Plus registration.  But there's more.
</p>

<p>
  That same afternoon, there are the Corporate Research Labs, which run
from 2-4 p.m. You can join interactive discussions from CA and RSA Labs
researchers on recent security technology.  And the Trusted Computing Group
returns again for its own set of presentations from 11-3, with lunch
included.  This half-day workshop will discuss the role of trust with
hardware-based security - the now-common Trusted Platform Module (TPM).
</p>  

<p>
  After that, you can attend the Trailbreakers Panel which celebrates
those technology leaders who weren't afraid to buck the status quo and
introduce innovative approaches that overcame mediocrity. Dr. Hugh
Thompson, Chief Security Strategist, People Security, and RSA Conference
Program Committee Chairman, will moderate the discussion of technology that
can change the world as we know it. And guess who is on the panel? HD
Moore, Chief Security Officer at Rapid7 and Chief Architect of Metasploit.
</p>  

<p>
If that wasn't enough, Fortify has a vendor code to get a free Expo
Pass and is also hosting its own all-day developer systems security 
conference.  But you have to register by Feb 11, the Friday before RSA.  
No pre-registration is required for the Fortify Developer Seminar.  To
register for your complimentary Expo pass (a $100 value), enter code
SC11FTS upon RSA Expo registration check out.

  For each RSA event since 1995, a unique theme has highlighted a
significant historical contribution to cryptography, mathematics or
information security. This spans from World War II Navaho Codetalkers to
the Chinese Remainder Theorem.	 For 2010, it  was  the influence of the
Rosetta Stone - literally code cracking.  This year, its about security
roles and Identity, with the longish theme name of The
Adventures of Alice &amp; Bob. Ron Rivest of the RSA algorithm fame used
these as placeholder names to explain the RSA encryption method and the
steps involved in the complex system. Alice &amp; Bob were born to make the
subject matter easier to grasp - replacing Person A and Person B.  Over
the years other characters have been added to make technical topics more
understandable. This cast of friends and enemies - including Eve the
Eavesdropper, Mallory the Malicious Attacker and Walter the Warden, among
others - populate Alice &amp; Bob's universe and are now common parlance in
cryptography and computer security.

<p>
  You can review several podcasts of interesting RSA sessions at your
leisure.  The address for the 2010 previews is
<a href="https://365.rsaconference.com/community/connect/rsa-conference-usa-2010?view=video">https://365.rsaconference.com/community/connect/rsa-conference-usa-2010?view=video</a> -
and out of that list, I'd suggest listening to Mark Risher, Sr.
Director or Product Management at Yahoo, on his HT1-301 session: "Yokai vs.
the Elephant: Hadoop and the Fight Against Shape-Shifting Spam", which is
about discovering polymorphic spam.  You can find that one here:

</p>

<p>
  Another memorable moment was Bruce Schneier's reflections on RSA
Conference via an RSA Conference Bingo card of security problems, like
witnessing WiFi sniffing. Here's the full card to enjoy:

  This address is for this year's RSA 2011 Preview Podcasts:

This will give you a taste of the upcoming sessions.
</p>

<h3>Keynotes</h3>

<p>
  Among several keynote sessions for 2011, William Lynn, Deputy Secretary
of Defense, will be speaking on "Defending a New Domain: The Pentagon's
Cyber Strategy."  James Lewis, Director at  the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, will be moderating a panel on  "Cyberwar,
Cybersecurity, and the Challenges Ahead." And, on the last day of RSA,
42nd President Bill Clinton will be speaking.
</p>

<p>
  The Cryptographers Panel, following the first keynote of RSA 2010,
featured crypto legends Ron Rivest and Adi Shamir (the R and the S of RSA
fame) and also Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman (of Diffie-Hellman fame
in Public Key Exchange). They talked about the recent history of
cryptography and current challenges, also sharing some insight into the
relationship between academic research and NSA capabilities.
</p>

<p>
  For the 2010 RSA Keynotes and Industry Panels, go here:  <br>
<a href="http://www.rsaconference.com/2010/usa/recordings/catalog.htm?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=connectmar30">http://www.rsaconference.com/2010/usa/recordings/catalog.htm?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=connectmar30</a>
</p>

<p>
  There are 17 2010 Keynote sessions posted plus 14 Industry sessions
posted, but some of them are videos of full track sessions.  Unfortunately,
you need 2010 Delegate credentials to view the full sessions.  But do check
out the links.
</p>

<p>
  Among my favorite sessions over the previous several years were technical sessions led
by engineers from Mandiant and technical sessions led by instructors from
SANS course. The latter group led a mini-class and Q/A session on advanced
hacking techniques. This later SANS session was led by SANS faves Ed
Skoudis and Johannes Ulrich. Skoudis noted that  the best anti-virus
software was falling to under 80 percent detection for the newer
polymorphic malware and recommended using both signature and
behaviour-based detection for better results. He also described a newly
detected vulnerability in SSL key renegotiation that required patching in
all OSes. I believe everyone learned something and the applause at the
end was long and sincere. I'd recommend going to any session with
speakers from SANS or Mandiant.
</p>

<p>
  If you make to this year's RSA, keep these sessions in mind. And bring
your own chocolate.
</p>

<p>
  Something to keep in mind for March is the Linux Foundation End User
Summit, March 1-2, in Jersey City, NJ. See
<a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/end-user-summit">http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/end-user-summit</a> for more details.
