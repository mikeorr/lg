I'm almost a junior in college now, and I know I want a career in the computer field, but my real love is Linux.  I also am really interested in networking and the internet, but there's just so many options its hard to make up my mind.  I'm wondering if there is a good paying career for a Linux professional, and if so, what should I do in my last two years of college to prepare myself?  I can't decide if I should go with an information systems degree, or just a regular CS degree.  If I could just get any information about possible career ideas in the linux field, or even if you could point me in the right direction to find more information I'd greatly appreciate it, and you have my word I'll renew my subscription when it runs out.

Most everybody ad SSC works full-time in Linux.  IBM, HP and other
major players are putting lots of money into Linux, and it seems
to be holding its own as a web server platform while continuing to
creep into the enterprise.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You might try keying "Linux" into a search of dice.com.  Lots of
spots for network administrators, web designers, driver writers,
and others, last time I checked.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Your mileage may vary.  A large Redmond company might prefer if there
were no such thing as Linux, and though many of us have our opinions,
in truth only time will tell.

There are more and more Linux based jobs out there. OK Granted the market
isn't great right now, but more and more companies are realizing the
benifits of Open Source.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Your school path should be based on what you want to do... Are you looking
to write the next killer app or kernel module? If so go with the CS Degree,
and learn good coding form.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
As for the company in redmond...If you like them the do hire Linux
professionals( The don't openly admit this) but a friend of mine who is a
Perl genius and a strict Solaris guy just got picked up by them for their
"enterprise email server project".  Redmond might scream and shout that open
source is evil, but they love and use it as well.  Just remember, up until a
few years ago, all of their web servers were running on *nix boxes. Another
example, they have a software version control package, that is based off an
open source package (They were even lame about it, all of the comands are
the same but have the "ms" prefix).

Sorry I ran off on a tangent...  There are jobs out there...

Linux is becoming more and more popular with
businesses these days. Certainly you should have no
problem coming into "contact" with it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
...as for your CS degree...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I assume that you're an American. I am English and so
cannot really say what your courses are like. I am 19
and am currently at University. I am doing an HND
(Higher National Diploma) in Computer Science, which
does cover some Unix aspects, if only basic. But it is
a good sign that the course leaders here acknowledge
the fact that Unix (and indeed Linux) is being used.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Any computer-orientated course should allow you the
opportunity of using Linux. There is yet to be a
degree here in the UK for Linux. However, software
engineering which uses C, does use the Unix
environment. So, you might get into Linux that way.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I would recommend going along to a local LUG to find
out from the memebers there how they got involved with
Linux.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There is information out tbere, especially on the
internet.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I did a google/linux search and founf 1,2,9998 hits
for Linux orientated jobs.

Lol, I thought you'd like it Ben. Of course, don't
tell the others it's really that secret KGB code that
you've been after. I like the cover up of blaming my
maths too -- nobody will ever suspect that our plan
for world domination is near completion
