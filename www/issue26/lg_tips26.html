My problem is this one ... I've gone bananas in trying to find a
document that explains how to install, in a step by step fashion, the
Apache
SSL "extensions" to one of my Apache WWW Webservers (the performance
increase is awesome) can you or anyone that reads this
help... </I> </blockquote> 
<P> 
This is how I did it:
<ol> 
<li>Get SSLeay 0.8.0 or later from 
     ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL
<li>Build and test  and install it!
<li>Get Apache 1.2.5 source
<li>Get Apache SSLeay extensions from 
ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/crypto/SSL/apache_1.2.5+ssl_1.13.tar.gz
<li>Unpack it in the apache-1.2.5 source directory and patch Apache as
per the README.
<li>Configure and build it.
<li>Read the docs before building (set your paths, etc, etc)
</ol>
Worked the first time too!
Hope this helps:

Locate
</H3>
From: John Corey, <A HREF="mailto:norm@comanche.dyn.ml.org">
norm@comanche.dyn.ml.org</A>
<P> 
One of my annoyances with the locate program have been that with it,
users can see files they have no access to otherwise.  So, I have
deviced a little <A HREF="./locate.diff">patch</A> to the original
sources to fix that, along with a
few other annoyances.  It inherently does a few other things as well. 
It will only list files that do currently exist (not just files that
existed when updatedb was last run).  Also, it adds the option -l to
locate which simply performs a ls -l on the files returned.
<P> 
To compile, get the sources from
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/findutils-4.1.tar.gz .
Extract that, then apply the attached diff to it with: patch <
locate.diff, and compile per the instructions within findutils.
<P> 
The only file modified is locate.c, so you can skip the installation
process if you already have updatedb/locate installed, and just simply
replace your existing locate binary with the new one (keeping a backup
of the original, should anything evil happen).
<P> 
Enjoy

I had the same problems with printing (no name for local machine).
You should put a entry for your machine in /etc/hosts, and your problem

I use a similar trick to start up the browser-/mail-/news-window from
three different buttons in my windowmanager's panel.
For the mail-window, you have to start the script with 'mailbox:' as the
url parameter, for the news-window simply use 'news:'.
For urls beginning different from the above, netscape opens the normal
browser window.

My guess is that you will need to get your hands dirty on this one.  You

Binary File Access with <tt>dd</tt>
</H3>
  <p>Date: February 9, 1998<br>
  From: Leonard R Budney <a
  href="mailto:budney@fore.com">lbudney@fore.com</a><br></p>

  <p><tt>dd</tt> stands for <em>Disk Dump.</em> Or if it doesn't it
  should.  The "main" use for <tt>dd</tt> is to duplicate a floppy
  disk, bit for bit, to a file.  You probably used it to create boot
  disks when you installed Linux for the first time, unless you used
  its much less functional cousin <tt>rawrite.</tt> If you're sick of
  keeping boxes of floppies around, you can use <tt>dd</tt> in
  reverse, and throw the floppy away.  Depending on permissions, you
  might have to do this as root.</p>

  <pre>dd if=/dev/fd0 of=quicken_install_disk_1.img bs=1440k</pre>

  <p>The <tt>if</tt> argument specifies an input file (which defaults
  to the standard input).  Naturally, the <tt>of</tt> argument names
  the output file (which defaults to the standard output).  Finally,
  the <tt>bs</tt> argument tells <tt>dd</tt> what <em>block size</em>
  to use.  Here we set the block size equal to the size of a floppy
  disk, and let <tt>dd</tt> read one block of data.</p>

  <p>The man page says that the purpose of <tt>dd</tt> is to "convert
  a file while copying it."  In English, that means that <tt>dd</tt>
  does <em>not</em> assume a file is made of text!  It doesn't look
  for carriage returns to delimit lines, it doesn't stop reading at
  the first binary zero, nothing!  This gives us the power to read
  files exactly, byte for byte.  It allows us to read a fixed number
  of bytes, or physically to overwrite a file.</p>

  <p>As just one example, consider /dev/random.  That's a nifty Linux
  innovation--a pseudo device that accumulates randomness.  Would you
  like to read 10 bytes of random data from /dev/random?  It's a
  snap.</p>

  <pre>dd if=/dev/random of=/tmp/random.bin bs=1 count=10</pre>

  <p>Note that /dev/random provides binary data, so if we omit the
  <tt>of</tt> argument then that data will probably trash our display.
  Alternately, we could have omitted the <tt>of</tt> argument, but
  piped the output through <tt>cat -v</tt> to escape any non-printable
  characters.  In addition to the arguments explained above, we use
  the <tt>count</tt> argument to specify the number of blocks to read.
  In conjunction with a blocksize of 1, <tt>count=10</tt> tells
  <tt>dd</tt> to read exactly 10 bytes.</p>

  <p>Here's a final example, for the paranoid.  When you delete a file
  using <tt>rm,</tt> you only delete the inode pointing to your data.
  The data is still there, on the disk, waiting for somebody with a
  "Disk Doctor" utility to resurrect and read.  Does that bother you?
  Well, you should delete your data, not just your file.  Again,
  <tt>dd</tt> comes to the rescue.  Normally <tt>dd</tt>
  <em>truncates</em> its output file before writing.  The argument
  <tt>conv=notrunc</tt> overrides that behavior, and causes
  <tt>dd</tt> to write over any existing data.  The following shell
  script combines all of these ideas, and wipes out your file by
  overwriting it five times with pseudorandom data, and then deleting
  it.</p>

  <pre>
#!/bin/sh
FILE=$1
SIZE=`ls -l $FILE | awk -- '{print \$5;}'`
{
    for iteration in 1 2 3 4 5
    do
        dd if=/dev/urandom of=$FILE bs=${SIZE} count=1 conv=notrunc
        sync
    done
} && rm -f $FILE
</pre>

  <p>Enjoy!<br>
  Len.</p>

Follow-up to find 2c-tip
</H3>
<P> 
Date: Tue, 10 Feb 1998 19:20:44 +0000 <BR> 
From: Markus Pilzecker, <A HREF="mailto:mp@rhein-neckar.netsurf.de">
mp@rhein-neckar.netsurf.de</A>
<p>
in your December issue, one of the 2-cents about find had been:
<p><blockquote> 
<I>A shorter and more efficient way of doing it uses backticks:</I><BR> 
<tt> grep "string" `find . -type f`</tt><BR> 
<I>Note however, that if the find matches a large number of files you 
may exceed a command line buffer in the shell and cause it to
complain. </I> </blockquote> 
<p>
The solution to this is using xargs:
<pre>
find &lt;find_roots&gt; &lt;other_options&gt; -print0 | xargs -0 grep &lt;options&gt;
</pre>
.  xargs only puts as much onto grep's [or whatever else's]
command line as fits without overflow.  Only in the latter case will 
it start a new instance of grep.  The trick of the first proposal to
add ``/dev/null'' to grep's command line to make it print the name
of the file in work is [mostly] superfluous then, since xargs 
[mostly] puts more than one filename onto grep's command line.
<p>
The find option ``-print0'' and the xargs option ``-0'' work together
to assure correct handling of odd filenames.

Yes it is posible.  Load the first image and select the portion of

Load the second image and press Alt-V.  A frame window the size
of the cut in the first image will appear.  Position the frame where
you want the image to be pasted, then press Alt-V (again).  This even

I'm using this little bash script to start Netscape:

else
   REMOTE_COMMAND="openBrowser"

netscape -remote $REMOTE_COMMAND || netscape $@

I think it has some advantages over the script from Tim Hawes:
<ul>
<li>no need to look for a lock file, which means:
<li>it even starts Netscape, if there is a stale lock file from a crashed
browser session :-)
<li>you can call it without any arguments, it doesn't matter if there is
a running Netscape or not
   ("openURL($@,new-window)" will cause an error, if "$@" is empty, so I
use "openBrowser" instead)

Linux and Win95

Re: Your Question e-mail to Linux Gazette
<P>
Your big problem is that Win95 has probably helped itself to the entire
drive already - so there is no space left available to install extra
Linux partitions.
<P>
What you really should do first is to back up all the existing
partitions using a tape or a Zip or a Jaz drive. Let me guess you don't
have one of these..... if you can beg/borrow/steal one temporarily and
back everything up before you do anything that would be good.
<P>
Maybe your D: partition doesn't hold much and you can transfer the data
to the C: drive where Win95 is installed - this will allow you to re-use
the D: partition for Linux.
<P>
Next - buy/beg/borrow/steal a recent copy of Red Hat for Linux (make
sure you get the book and the floppy disks that come with the CD) and
the Doctor Linux book.
<P>
Red Hat has a beginners book with it that explains a lot that you need
to know to install Linux and a set of excellent scripts that lead you
though the installation.
<P>
doctor linux has good beginners sections and more complex ones about
dual booting Win95 and Linux 
<P>
I would recommend that you DO NOT try to make the machine dual boot - it
could cock-up the win95 installation
but these articles will help you understand the mechanics around this
area. The HOWTO articles in Doctor Linux are all available on the
Internet if you don't want to buy a book but having a hard copy to
reference is much easier.
<P>
once you have re-located any useful data off the D: to the C: then use
the disk partitioning tool that comes with red hat to de-allocate the D:
partition and then create the root, usr, swap and home (and any others)
in this area. From memory I believe that the root partition has to be in
a primary partition but all the rest can be logical partitions contained
in a single "extended" partition. 
<P>
This re-allocation of partitions is EXTREMELY dicey - make absolutely
sure you understand which partition is C: and which is D: IF you
de-allocate C by mistake then it is almost definitely un-recoverable
unless you have Norton for Win95 or something similar that can repair
the damage. 
<P>
Create a boot diskette using red hat so that when you want to run Linux
you just plug it in and re-boot the machine - booting off the floppy may
seem awkward but it is much much faster than any version of Windoze.
<P>
Any one else using the family using the machine will not have this boot
diskette and will not be able to see your
partitions from Win95 and won't even know that Linux is there. This is
how I keep my family off my copy of Linux.

My $0.02 tip: Graphical su

From: Andreas Kostyrka, <A HREF="mailto:andreas@rainbow.studorg.tuwien.ac.at">
andreas@rainbow.studorg.tuwien.ac.at</A> 
<P>
Sometimes one want to do su but be able to use X11 programs like RH
control-panel. There are several ways to accomplish this:
*) The hard way: su - and copy&paste the xauth:
<PRE> 
$ xauth list $DISPLAY # mark the output
$ su -
# xauth add &lt;paste the above line&gt;
# export DISPLAY=&lt;display mentioned in the pasted line.)
</PRE> <P> 
*) The overkill net way:
<PRE> 
$ ssh localhost -l root
</PRE> <P> 
This depends upon you haveing installed ssh (ftp.replay.com is the site
where one gets the crypto stuff for RH Linux in .rpms), and is probably
not that fast, as it uses a X11 proxy forwarding server.
<P>
*) The graphical (XDM) way, or the way to show off for your WinNT friends:
<PRE> 
$ Xnest :10 -query localhost &
</PRE> 
:10 must be perhaps customized if it is already in use.
localhost is your xdm host.
This should work if you use xdm for login. (==You have a graphical login
screen.)
