<h1>Away Mission -- OracleWorld '06, San Francisco</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</A></b></p>

<p>
Oracle World: A Mega Conference. 40K attendees, 16K hotel rooms.
Thousands of people crossing in 3 different directions at 4th and Howard
Street, with the SFPD waving arms and blowing whistles frantically. A
huge dining tent in the middle of the street. And very literally "tons
of food" for after-sessions parties. Almost overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
This is Oracle's trophy event. It is a multiverse of user conferences
from all of its assimilated purchased companies. It's J.D. Edwards
World, the forum for the multitudes of PeopleSoft users, a DBA
conference, a mini-Java conference, and now a major Linux conference.
</p>

<p>
Billed as the world's largest computer software conference with 42,000
attendees [but didn't COMDEX crack the 100 K mark back in its day?],
it was a veritable city within the City of San Francisco. Streets were
blocked off for Oracle events, and the conference sessions overflowed
all three buildings of the Moscone Center and took over several local
hotels for tracks such as those dedicated to CEOs and CIOs, and to the
Life Sciences.
</p>

<p>
Partly because so many of the attendees were executives and business
principals, the perks and party favors were often an order of magnitude
better than the pizza and pretzels you would see at a strictly techie
event. The OracleWorld conference bag, for example, was a well-tailored
cross between an attache case and a laptop carrier, just perfect
for my notebook and very smart, and included a folding umbrella for
the unseasonably warm SF October weather. There were special events
and separate receptions for developers, DBAs, business analysts,
international guests, long-term J.D. Edwards users, and the now-annual
Linux Install-a-thon where RHEL AS 4 was available to attendees willing
to install it on their laptops.  [This was the night before the Oracle
Linux announcement.]

<p>
As for hardware, the star of the show wasn't one of the Oracle Clusters
running on the Expo floor from Dell, HP, or IBM - it was the America's Cup
yacht owned by Larry Ellison on display in the central corridor between
Moscone Center's North and South Halls. Quite a lovely machine.  [I could
almost hear Larry Ellison saying, "I have bigger toys."]  To show
appreciation to their customers and conference attendees, Oracle and
NetApp threw a finale party for over 20,000 attendees with 5 stages,
mountains of food, an open tap, and headliners Joan Jett, Devo, and Sir
Elton John. With an extended, anthemic version of "RocketMan", Sir John
rocked the overflow crowd and kept everyone out very late.
</p>


<h3>Oracle Linux</h3>

<p>
The killer announcement at OracleWorld '06 was Oracle Linux, during Larry
Ellison's keynote on the last day. As if digesting PeopleSoft and JD
Edwards weren't enough, Oracle is now offering Linux operating system
support in the form of an Oracle-tweaked version of Red Hat with the
logos stripped out.
</p>

<p>
"Oracle Unbreakable Linux 2.0" provides enterprises with global support
for Linux via Oracle's own support staff. This makes Oracle both a
partner and a major competitor for Red Hat, whose stock plunged 24% the
day following. Red Hat responded by sporting a new "Unfakeable Linux"
banner on its Web site, and a Q/A page that notes that Oracle differences
may constitute a fork in the Linux kernel [see below].
</p>

<p>
Red Hat has also just released its <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/2006/earnings_2007q3.html">
quarterly financials</a> and - surprise! - they had a
very good quarter.  Profit and revenue were up approximately 45% each
from the prior year and prior quarter respectively, so the universe of
Linux sales and support may be big enough for two behemoths. It is true
that their earnings per share dropped from $0.12 last year to $0.07 this
time, but Red Hat is also expensing more to better position itself
against both Oracle and arch-enemy Microsoft.
</p>

<p>
Prices for Oracle Linux Support start at $99 for patches and updates,
but it's $399 for support, similar to RHEL ES 2-CPU support at $999; and
Oracle's $1000 for multi CPU-support is similar to RHEL multi-CPU
support, which is now $2500 per year.
</p>

<p>
To gild the lily a bit more, until January 31, 2007, it will be 50% off
these low Oracle Linux support prices. This is available to everyone,
even non-Oracle customers. Oracle customers can get free Premier support
for Linux by using their existing CSI numbers to log Linux issues via
MetaLink.
</p>

<p>
For years, Oracle has fixed P1 bugs for its Linux customers. Oracle also
offered its Cluster File System, as part of the Linux kernel. This has
helped make Oracle customers comfortable with Linux.
</p>

<p>
Yahoo! Vice-President of Engineering Laurie Mann joined Ellison on the
keynote stage, and described Yahoo's infrastructure of 150,000 servers.
Mann said they had scores of database appliances running Oracle on
Linux, that they were supported internally, and that experience meant 
support of these configurations was better from Oracle than Red Hat. 
He noted that Oracle was providing free downloadable binaries in ISO images.
</p>

<p>
Oracle will publish their bug fixes immediately. It will frequently
synch its distro with Red Hat, but also maintain the Oracle fixes going
forward. Oracle will offer patches for older versions of Red Hat,
something that Red Hat does not do consistently. Oracle will also offer
legal indemnity from intellectual property actions like those launched
by SCO.
</p>

<p>
Currently, Red Hat provides bug fixes for only the latest version of its
software. This often requires customers to upgrade to a new version of
the Linux software to get a bug fixed. Oracle's new Unbreakable Linux
program will provide bug fixes to future, current, and back releases of
Linux. In other words, Oracle will provide the same level of enterprise
support for Linux as is available for other operating systems.
</p>

<p>
"We believe that better support and lower support prices will speed the
adoption of Linux, and we are working closely with our partners to make
that happen," said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. "Intel is a development
partner. Dell and HP are resellers and support partners. Many others are
signed up to help us move Linux up to mission critical status in the
data center."
</p>

<p>
 "The goal here is to make all versions of Linux better." said Ellison
from the stage. "The better Linux gets, the better it is for us..." And
later, "this is Capitalism, we're competing... we are offering a better
product at a lower price." The bottom line for the Linux community,
according to Ellison, "... is about increasing the status of Linux," and
moving it deeper into the enterprise.

<p>
Besides announcing its Oracle Linux offerings and half-price charter
offer, Oracle also announced it was joining the FSG [Free Standards
Group], which develops and maintains the LSB, the Linux Standard Base,
to which all distros need certification. This seems to show that Oracle
is indeed serious and also supportive of the larger Linux community.
Said FSG's Executive Director, Jim Zemlin:
</p>

<blockquote>
"As the largest enterprise software company, Oracle is one of the
most influential and important Linux software vendors. By joining the
FSG, they send a clear message that they support open standards. Their
joining the FSG is a watershed moment for the Linux platform, showing
that all major Linux software vendors have joined together to support
the LSB and keep Linux from fragmenting. Their participation in our
workgroup will help us meet the most pressing needs for Linux users and
developers."
</blockquote>

<p>
Oracle <a href="http://www.consortiuminfo.org/bulletins/oct06.php#blog">joined 
the FSG</a> as a <a 
href="http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2006_oct/oracle-fsg.html?rssid=rss_ocom_pr">platinum member</a>.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the usual partnering announcements and posturing about
growth and market share, there were some interesting and newsworthy
items. Michael Dell, in person, announced 2 new server platforms
in a quick 1-2 shuffle with AMD and Intel. First out of the block
was Dell's new Opteron server with 4 AMD "F" sockets. That means a
future-ready server, as current dual-core Opterons can be easily replaced
by forthcoming 4-core Opteron chips in early 2007. Then, just minutes
latter, Dell announced the dual socketed, 1U-high SC1435, which is
designed for distributed serving environments like Web farms and 
high-performance computing clusters. Dell's PowerEdge SC1435 will come with
Intel 5300 quad-core CPU and 4 sockets, making it the least expensive
production 8-way server.

<p>
Oracle keynote speakers described their Open Source initiatives, which
include 3 Eclipse projects [BPEL, JSF, JPA] plus ongoing collaborations
and support for Linux. [There had been rumors about an Oracle-Ubuntu
effort; none were verified.] They also cited work on Zend Core for
PHP. Mike Olson, former CEO of Sleepycat Systems, known for the famous
Berkeley DB embedded database [now owned by Oracle] spoke about the
ubiquity of Berkeley DB with 200 million open source installations, and
cited its dual license provisions, which allow for free redistribution
within open source applications. There were separate technical
presentations on Berkeley DB and its integration with Oracle products.

<p>
The presentations are available to members of the <a

Network, a free membership]</a>. There is also a default ID and password
offered when one tries to access the content - I'm providing that
below. With this ID, about half of the presentations are available for
download. It is probable, however, that many presenters did not post

<h3>Task-oriented, Contextual, Multi-Channel Interactions for Information Workers?</h3>

<p>
With significant fanfare, Oracle rolled out its WebCenter Suite as
an interactive platform that applies Web 2.0 practices to enterprise
content management and "business intelligence". It delivers
enterprise search, structured and unstructured data access, business
process oversight, and communication &amp; collaboration services. It
uses Java JSF and AJAX, supports "Enterprise Mashups", can synchronize
information portlets and workflows, has instant messaging, has VoIP,
discussion forums, and supports Wiki services and blogs - but the 
main selling point is that WebCenter "addresses the inefficiencies that
force users to manually switch between tasks. Oracle WebCenter Suite
attempts to fuse Web-based portals, enterprise applications, and AJAX
technologies to enable context-sensitive work processes."
</p>

<p>
Of course, this is an enterprise-centric, everything-in-one-place,
one-ring-to-rule-them-all approach. There are open source projects that
offer pieces of a total solution, but here, in theory at least, everything
is integrated, and there is only one vendor needed for technical support.
All this for a price. Oracle WebCenter Suite is licensed as an option on
top of Oracle Application Server Enterprise Edition at a cost of $50,000
per CPU. That's more than spare change. [I wonder how they will license the
coming quad-core CPUs?]
</p>

<p>
Here are more details from the WebCenter Suite Press Release:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Oracle WebCenter Framework: a Java Server Faces (JSF) and Oracle
ADF-based framework that enables developers to embed rich, AJAX-based
components, portlets, and content into their JSF applications to create
a dynamic and context-rich user experience. The WebCenter Framework
will use JSR 168, JSR 170, and WSRP 2.0, and will inter-operate with
standards-based portals including Oracle Portal.
</li>

<li>
Oracle WebCenter Services: embeddable Web 2.0 content, collaboration
and communication components including Oracle Content Database, Oracle
Secure Enterprise Search, SIP-based VoIP and Instant Messaging Presence
Server, Discussion Forum, and a Wiki service.
</li>

<li>
Oracle WebCenter Studio: exposes the WebCenter Framework and WebCenter
Services to programmers inside Oracle JDeveloper.
</li>

<li>
Oracle WebCenter Anywhere: enables users to connect and work wherever
they happen to be, by exposing critical task flows and services through
familiar mobile devices, and desktop tools including Microsoft Office
and Exchange.
</li>

<li>
Oracle WebCenter Composer: a browser-based environment for composing
and customizing the application user interfaces, business rules and
policies, user profiles, and preferences and business processes.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
 
<p>
How does OracleWorld stack up? The reach and breadth of the Oracle
product line means there are sessions for literally everyone, suit or
techie.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ While "suits" and "techies" make for amusing Dilbert-esque humor, the
reality is that buying into this polarization closes off the best
opportunities for advancement in today's business world. These days, one of
the most desirable and best-paid categories of employee in the field is a
technical manager - someone who knows both the technical and the management
side of the business. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
The flip side of that is having many competing sessions of varying
technical quality -- it's hard to set an agenda and even harder to keep to
it, as sessions disappoint occasionally. Sometimes excellent sessions on
similar topics appear at the same time on different tracks [and that might
mean the sessions are in different buildings]. This is true of all large
conferences, but, since OracleWorld is one of the largest computer
conferences, this does happen a lot.
</p>

<p>
There are so many sessions, in fact, that getting to the Expo floor is
difficult to squeeze into the agenda. Because of the hundreds of
sessions available, I would recommend a team approach, with alternating
days at the Expo.
</p>

<p>
The OracleWorld Expo Pass, which included entry to one conference
session, also was a great deal. Free Expo Pass coupons appeared in the
Business section of the <em>SF Chronicle</em>, the Sunday before OracleWorld. 
So, if your company is a little tight for cash, consider getting Expo passes
for half of your team, and have them switch off on different days and
hours.
