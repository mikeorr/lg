<h1>The Back Page, part 1</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/orr.html">Mike Orr (Sluggo)</A></b></p>

<p>
<P> <EM>It's been <A HREF="../issue96/lg_backpage.html">six months</A> since
I've been able to do a Back Page.  It hasn't been for lack of material -- I've
got 3 megs worth of the funniest messages from The Answer Gang and the Gazette
mailbox accumulated.  It's just finding time to select and format them.  I
wanted to leave you a good Back Page for my last issue, so I took a weekend and
went through them.  It came out to four articles' worth.  There's two Wacko
Topics of the Month ("The Shift Key FAQ", "Domestic vs Wild OSes"), the usual
Not The Answer Gang (now called "The Linux Laundrette"), two long Laundrette
threads I've put in separate articles (one about American vs British English,
the other about buoys -- or at least it started as a thread about buoys but
then it meandered to the Netherlands' history and then again to music), some
Non-Linux Links, and a World of Spam.  And there's still 52 KB after that for a
future issue!  I've put all four articles in this issue, one right after the
other.  Enjoy!</EM>

<H3>Unleash the Power of Shift!</H3>

<P> <STRONG>Q. My shift keys have little arrows on them. Does that mean the
*real* shift keys are located above them, and these keys are just little signs
to point them out?</STRONG>

<P> A. Nope, they're the Real McCoy. The little arrows mean "up", as 
in "look up at the screen". Your keyboard is telling you to learn to 
touch type and quit staring at your fingers. 

<P> <STRONG>Q. What happens if I press both shift keys?</STRONG>

<P> A. Even bigger letters may show up on your screen. You should not use 
this feature, however, because these letters are also brighter, and may 
cause Screen Burn-In, which would be particularly embarrassing if you 
were typing something naughty at the time. You might consider obtaining 
the author's Shift Key Burn-In Protector program for only $139.95. Or 
you might not, it's your computer, but don't say I didn't warn you. 

<P> <STRONG>Q.  my religion prohibits the use of shift keys. how can i type
capital letters and punctuation.</STRONG>

<P> A. Discuss alternatives to the shift key with your spiritual advisor. 
Perhaps your deity would not be angered by repeated use of the Caps Lock 
key, or maybe you can retain a consultant to depress the shift for you. 
You might also consider replacing punctuation marks that require the 
use of shift keys with lower case expressions; replace ? with "huh" 
and ! with "zowie". 

<P> <STRONG>Q. I PRESSED SHIFT AND IT"S STUCK DOWN NOW&gt;</STRONG>

<P> A. Do small children with a fondness for peanut butter use your keyboard 
frequently? If so, you may want to clean it off for more reliable 
operation. First, disconnect your keyboard by gripping each of its ends 
firmly and pulling as hard as you can. Next, immerse the keyboard in 
warm water and scrub thoroughly with your favorite lemon-scented detergent 
and lots of steel wool. Finally, you need to dry the keyboard. Either 
dry it to touch with a handheld blowdryer, or place it it the dryer 
for not less than 60 minutes. Be sure to clean the lint screen when you 
are finished. 

<P> <STRONG>Q. Why are there are no "shift" keys on my keyboard, but there are
two keys labelled "hif"?</STRONG>

<P> A. Again, you may want to consider cleaning your keyboard, and washing 
your hands more frequently for that matter. 

<P> <STRONG>Q. Are there shift keys on my Macintosh?</STRONG>

<P> A. Yes, although instead of the notation "shift", the key may be labelled 
with an excited Mac face, something like :O . Press this key to use 
shift, and be thankful you're using a friendly Mac instead of a mean old 
PC with all them confusin' words 'n stuff on it. 

<P> <STRONG>Q. I'm sick of pushing the shift key every single time I want big
letters.  Is there any other way to do this?</STRONG>

<P> A. This is the Modern Age of Convenience, and you may be able to activate 
the shift key merely with the power of your voice! Check to see whether 
your computer is equippped with speech-recognition equipment by saying 
the word "shift" very clearly and slowly into its speaker. Then watch the 
keyboard closely to see if the Shift key moves down. Note that you may 
have to repeat this action several times to "train" the computer to 
recognize your voice before the feature works reliably. 

<P> <STRONG>Q. There are two shift keys, which should I use?</STRONG>

<P> A. Avoid unnecessary wear on either shift key by alternating between the 
two. Keep track of your usage of each key so that you press them in 
equal amounts. Your keyboard may be equipped with a small notepad; you 
should use this to make little tally marks in two columns for each time 
you shift. Remember, it's better to go to a little trouble than wind up 
with a broken shift key. 

<P> <STRONG>Q. Why are the shift keys bigger than the other keys?</STRONG>

<P> A. They aren't. This is simply an optical illusion. Just as the moon 
appears much larger when it is close to the horizon, your shift keys 
look larger because of their proximity to other keys. To verify this, 
go out in a large field at night with your keyboard, place it in an 
upright position, and view it from a distance of 200 yards. Sure enough, 
the keys all look the same size! 

<P> <STRONG>Q. If I press the shift key at the wrong time, or too many times,
will my computer explode?</STRONG>

<P> A. No. Well, generally no. Not unless you are using a NEC laptop. Or 
vt100 terminal emulation. But even then, hardly ever. Really, don't 
worry about it. Forget I mentioned it. Just type softly. Move along, 
next question. 

<P> <STRONG>Q. No matter what I do, the shift key just doesn't seem to work.
What's wrong?</STRONG>

<P> A. Have you ever considered that the problem may not be your keyboard, 
the problem may be YOU? Perhaps God Himself has suspended the operation 
of these keys to send you a Message that you have strayed from the path 
of righteousness. Use this as an opportunity to reflect on your life. 
Before rushing blindly ahead with a lot of shifting, consult the spiritual 
advisor of your choice for help in dealing with any unresolved issues 
in your relationship with the Almighty.

I received this from my LUG.  "So which OSes are wild and which are domestic?

Ok, let's see now:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>MacOSX:</STRONG> Sort of like a pedigree persian cat.
Very sleek, very sexy, but a little too prone to
going cross-eyed, biting you on your thumb and
then throwing up on your trousers.

<P> <STRONG>Windows XP:</STRONG> Big cow. Stands there, not
especially malevolent but constantly crapping on
your carpet. Eventually you have to open a
window to let the crap out or you die.

<P> <STRONG>Windows 2000:</STRONG> Smaller cow. Just as much crap.

<P> <STRONG>THEOS:</STRONG> Mad cow. Utterly fucking insane cow, in
fact. A cow so mad it thinks it's a teapot. The
swamp dragon of the OS world.

<P> <STRONG>Linux:</STRONG> Horse. Like a wild horse, fun to ride.
Also prone to throwing you and stamping you into
the ground because it doesn't like your socks.

<P> <STRONG>TRSDOS:</STRONG> Friendly old lizard. Or, at least,
content to sit there eating flies.

<P> ..and continued later...

<P> <STRONG>(FREE|OPEN) BSD:</STRONG> Shire horse. Solid, reliable,
only occasionally prone to crushing you against
a wall and then only because you've told it to
without knowing.

<P> <STRONG>Solaris:</STRONG> Shire horse that dreams of being a race
horse, blissfully unaware that its owners don't
quite know whether to put it out to grass, to
stud, or to the knackers yard.

<H3>Redirection and noclobber</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Stray files called "!" mean I did a command in bash using zsh (csh)
syntax.  "COMMAND &gt;! FILE" in zsh means "redirect to FILE and overwrite
it dammit!"  But in bash it creates a file called "!".
The corresponding syntax in bash is "COMMAND &gt;| FILE".

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Oh, now I get what you mean. This is only useful if you've done "set -o
noclobber" or "set -C"; otherwise, "COMMAND &gt; FILE" works fine.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
Of course I have 'noclobber' set.  Doesn't everybody?  It's a standard
safety precaution.  Or do you follow the "Real Men Don't Need No Stinkin
'noclobber'" theory?  But considering Woomert and Frink use the -w switch
in Perl more than I do, I doubt it....

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Redirection in shells is Wyrd and Arcane.

<H3>Ben's army days</H3>

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
When taking the Army entry tests WBW, I found out I don't do well with
red-on-green patterns. However, there was a "compensating" factor (that is,
compensating for the Army, not too good for me!) - I can see OD green (and
hence, all forest-pattern camouflage) against a green background as clearly as
if it was, say, a light gray against black....  Care to guess who was *always*
made point man in my infantry basic training and AIT??? Good thing it was only
training.
  
<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
AIT? Damn, it stands for half a million things! I'll just assume it's 
"Something Something Training"

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
One time I managed to prevent a buddy from tripping off a string of practice
grenades by yanking him back just in time. The tripwire was colored standard
Army OD green...

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
Hmm... practise or no, I think grenades are definitely something best 
avoided, unless you're the one counting.

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
On the other hand, my platoon was _never_ successfully ambushed...

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
Mental note: never engage in jungle combat with Ben.

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
AIT stands for "Advanced Individual Training". Basic was the same
(theoretically, but not at all) for everybody; AIT was the training you got for
your MOS (Military Occupational Specialty.) I went in as a grunt (11B), got
retrained as a 52C (Turbine Engine/HVAC mechanic) when they found out they
couldn't send me overseas (I wasn't a citizen yet!), then got snagged by the
Military Intelligence (a non-sequitur) when they found out I could do Russian.
A lot of history in between all of that, including being a medic for a short
stretch....

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
I realise it's a faux pas to shoot a medic, but weren't you worried 
about the similarity between a red cross and, say, a crosshair?

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Nah. I was unkillable back then; we all were.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
(If you're gonna reminisce, I'm gonna go right ahead and whip out the 
Full Metal Jacket quotes.)
"This is my rifle, this is my gun. This is for fighting, this is for fun".

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Congrats - you've won a beer, collectable when we happen to share a
geographical location! <IMG ALT=":)" SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="24">

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
There's always a catch, isn't there? Sure, I'll fly a few thousand miles 
for a beer.

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Hey, you never know what might happen! I might be over your way visiting
one day (it's a long-distance plan), or you just might end up here - and
there you are, a beer all ready for you. None of that Buttweiser or
Willer, either; Sam Adams at the very least. On the other hand, I'm a
fan of Young's Luxury Double Chocolate Stout, so you never know what
might happen...

<P>
<STRONG>[Jimmy]</STRONG> 
That reminds me... Arthur Guinness is in the bar in heaven, and he bumps 
into Eberhard Anheuser, Adolphus Busch and Carl Conrad. The four start 
reminiscing about their lives as beer producers while they wait for the 
waiter. Anheuser offers to pay for the round, and orders a Budweiser, as 
do Busch and Conrad. Guinness orders a milk. After a while, there's a 
lull in the conversation, and Anheuser turns to Guinness.
"Arthur, I hope you don't mind me asking, but when we ordered, we 
ordered Budweiser, because that was our company. Why didn't you order a 
Guinness?"

<P>
Arthur looks at each man in turn, and says "I would have, but if none of 
you were going to have a beer, then neither was I".

<H3>Anchors aweigh!</H3>

It's blowing a full gale here in St. Augustine [Florida], and there are lots of
boats dragging (the soft mud bottom here makes for lousy holding.) Early
this morning, mine joined the drag race - I've fought her to a
standstill, but need to get my anchors up (this is, mildly put, not easy
in a gale - particularly by yourself) and get her moved to a safer
location. I'm taking a break for the moment - I've been helping other
folks get theirs under control - but I'll be pretty busy for a while.

<P>
<STRONG>[Jim Dennis]</STRONG> 
When I expressed a hope that the wind would fill your sails, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT! 

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
Careful what you wish for, Jim. At least for me. 

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
BBC Radio4 said that gales would be quite common, but they weren't sure
how severe :( Seems you've hit the brunt of it, alas.

<P>
<STRONG>[Ben]</STRONG> 
It's still blowing 35 kt., gusting over 40; a full gale, and just a bit
short of a storm. The northeasterly wind has a nice long run ("fetch")
down the river, and has built up some good-sized seas; "Ulysses"' bow is
heaving through (estimated) a 5' range. The surf is literally exploding
against the town's seawall.

<P>
<A HREF="misc/backpage/Gale-surf.jpg">Image of seawall</A>

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
I've never seen a boat with a bicycle on it before.

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
ROFL...
Either that, Mike, or it is one hell of an expensive pedallo to hire.

<P>
<STRONG>[Sluggo]</STRONG> 
A what?  Checking www.m-w.com to see if pedallo is as nasty as bordello
or fellatio, I see 'pedalo' (one 'l') is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<STRONG>[Thomas]</STRONG> 
Yes, one 'l'...damn kbdrate. Must fix that.  Hmm...certainly not
fellatio, Mike.  Unless, that is a euphemism for which I was previously
unaware?

<P>
Indeed, they're yellow and one paddles them out to sea...hence the bicycle
reference. Sigh..... I doubt whether my humo[u]r will *ever* be
appreciated.

Perhaps you should consider taking an intro jump, then, or an intro

from the edge of a 12-story high building I'd sneaked into when I was 8

Or he could do what I did: build bridges during summer break.  It wasn't
so much being 40 - 80 feet off the ground that breaks you of the fear,
more like walking along a beam less than a foot wide.  Not on the beam
per se, but rather on the half inch rebar (reinforcing bars of steel)
sticking out of the beam.
