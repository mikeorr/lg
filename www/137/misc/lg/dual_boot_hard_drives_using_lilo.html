<p>
Good Day!
</p>

<p>
     I have a bit of a challenge on my hands that I think you can help me 
with. My company (as listed below) makes automated computer placement 
machines that run on a Linux platform. We have used RedHat exclusively for 
years. Recently, we have upgraded to a Fedora version.
</p>

<p>
    Into the Linux, we have our own GUI that is used for menu's, data 
entry, etc. We call it TPSys (Test and Place System). Well, there are many 
versions of TPSys that have been released over the years. Each version 
gives new features, some mechanical support, many software improvements.
</p>

<p>
     I am the corporate trainer for this company. I am in a situation now 
where we just released a new version of the TPSys. Many customers that we 
have won't be elegible or just won't get the new software, so I'm in a 
situation where I now have to offer courses on older TPSys software, as 
well as new! I need to have my demo machine running the software 
applicable to that course. Short of changing the hard drive each time, I 
would like to have the machine be a dual boot system so that I can choose.
</p>

<p>
     I have several options at hand. I have a secondary IDE spot that I 
can put a slave H/D, or, I can partition the drive (it's 80Gig, where we 
really only need a 40Gig partition to run).
</p>

<p>
     My question for you guys is this...... if I edit the lilo.conf file, 
there is a boot line. The standard line that is in my machine is 
"boot=/dev/hda". What do I need to add in order have the choice of which 
hard drive to boot from? Is there a way to do this, and do you know of 
anyone using this in a practical way?
</p>

<p>
     I really appreciate your time. Thank you in advance.
</p>

Right, the "boot=/dev/hda" line tells LILO where to install the MBR.
This bears no relation in telling LILO about any other drives you
have.   If this secondary drive you want to install just has another
copy of Linux on it, then just continue adding more stanzas to
your /etc/lilo.conf, as in:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
image=/boot/kernel-2.6.17-2
  label=myOtherOS      # Name we give to this section
  read-only            # Start with a read-only root. Do not alter!
  root=/dev/hdb2       # Location of the root filesystem
</pre>
Note for the above you will clearly have to change a few things -- most
notably the "root=" line.

Thank you so much. I understand. I will try this!

<p>
Why not just keep the partitioning scheme you've got, and set up as many
chroot environments as you need? Unless your program actually requires
different kernel versions, there shouldn't be any need for multiple
booting.
