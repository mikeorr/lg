Subject: lang="utf-8" makes Firefox use an ugly font
To: editor@linuxgazette.net
</pre>

<p>
Hello editor,
</p>

<p>
In the source of many of the HTML pages of the <em>Linux Gazette</em>, the 
&lt;HTML&gt; tag contains 'lang="utf-8" xml:lang="utf-8"'.  This has the 
effect of making Firefox think that this is some exotic language,
and it falls back to a simple, smaller, uglier, unaliased font.
For example on <a href="../150/index.html">http://linuxgazette.net/150/index.html</a> .
</p>

<p>
On <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/</a> the W3 suggests that the &lt;HTML&gt; tag 
contain 'xml:lang="en" lang="en"'.  When I replace the existing 
attributes with these, then the page gets shown fine for me.
</p>

<p>
(The possible reason that only I see this problem is that I've set 
Firefox to always use my chosen font, and ignore the fonts of the 
website.  This works fine on almost all Web sites.  Only on Japanese 
sites and on <em>Linux Gazette</em> do I still get this ugly unaliased font.)
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Benno

</p>

<p>
This project is still low in progress, and still considered as a 
personal project, which is updated only in my spare time. Anyone who is 
interested to join, please let me know. I will be very happy to 
proofread and publish your translation.
</p>

<p>
Hello all,
</p>

<p>
I have installed Ubuntu 8.04 (32-bit) beta on my 32-bit notebook and
Ubuntu 8.04 (64-bit) on a friend's 64-bit laptop. I am using Acer
laptops.
</p>

<p>
In both cases, using the touchpad to click (single/double-click) is
pretty troublesome, and needs a rather "hard" hit on the pad. I have
tried setting the mouse preferences similar to the one on Ubuntu 7.04
(which I use), but to no avail.
</p>

<p>
Any hints?
</p>

Amit

&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Hey, Rick -
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I've just been contacted by these people:
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/</a>
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; They want to write something for us. [ ... ] What's your take on this?
&gt; 
&gt; They're legit.  I think the main reason they smell funny is that their
&gt; main assets -- the reason for their existence, a set of software patents
&gt; -- inherently smells funny.
&gt; 
&gt; Back in the 1990s, there was a firm called Commerce One, which through
&gt; acquisitions picked up a bunch of patents related to online
&gt; communications, mostly business-to-business and e-commerce stuff.  They
&gt; filed for bankruptcy protection in 2004, and the court approved a sale
&gt; of the patent portfolio to a subsidiary of Novell.
&gt; 
&gt; My impression is that Novell at that point woke up and said "We just
&gt; acquired <em>what</em>?"  They really didn't want to become patent barons, and
&gt; saw from the SCO fiasco that they wanted to keep clear of, and
&gt; preferably disarm, the more scumsucking elements of the "intellectual
&gt; property" ranching business.  So, they talked with IBM, Philips, Red
&gt; Hat, and Sony, and got them all to pitch in patents and money to launch
&gt; Open Invention Network to hold contributed patents (including the
&gt; Commerce One portfolio) and licence them royalty-free to any firm that
&gt; in return promises patent peace towards Linux and a list of
&gt; Linux-related codebases (Apache, Eclipse, Evolution, Fedora Directory
&gt; Server, Firefox, GIMP, GNOME, KDE, Mono, Mozilla, MySQL, Nautilus,
&gt; OpenLDAP, OpenOffice.org, Open-Xchange, Perl, PostgreSQL, Python, Samba,
&gt; SELinux, Sendmail, and Thunderbird).
&gt; 
&gt; There's not a lot that stands absolutely in the way of them turning
&gt; evil, but it's reassuring that Red Hat's Mark Webbink approves of them
&gt; highly.  See:  <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2006/04/14/#oin">http://www.dwheeler.com/blog/2006/04/14/#oin</a>
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to lose my cynic credentials, but I'd say you should eagerly
&gt; invite an article submission!

<p>
Anyone tried Hardy Heron (Ubuntu) yet?
</p>

<p>
I just installed Hardy on my new machine, first Linux distro on that machine,
and I couldn't get my network to work. I dual-boot (with XP) and, on WinXP, it's
working OK. My network is pretty simple - each machine has its own static IP
(no DHCP). On Hardy, I configured the IP via the network config (the same IP
I use on that machine for Windows XP), but nothing works. I can't ping other
machines on the network, other machines can't ping me, and Hardy is not
asking for any driver or anything.
</p>

<p>
Any clue on what could I check to try to solve that problem?

&gt;  &gt; I'd like to correct one common misapprehension, though: you don't have
&gt;  &gt; to learn to program in order to use Linux. in fact, the skills you need
&gt;  &gt; to use it are the same ones that you need for using Windows.
&gt;
&gt;  Actually, I think it's time we counter the hoary "you have to be a
&gt;  programmer to use Linux" farrago with a far more credible counter-meme:
&gt;  You really <em>must</em> be a programmer to stand a chance of not being
&gt;  horribly frustrated by MS-Windows.
&gt;
&gt;  Consider how many times we've heard from MS-Windows users that the poor
&gt;  security architecture, corruption-prone registry, spyware-infested
&gt;  proprietary software marketplace, fragile and fragmentation-tending
&gt;  filesystems, and so on have driven them to utter distraction.
</pre>

<p>
So true!  My sister just told me how she had recently suffered the
loss of all the data on her laptop, collected over at least three
years.  It was all due to a family member visiting a Web site that
infected the system with some kind of virus.  Her comment to me was
something like "I just hate computers!"  My retort was the usual "The
problem is not inherent to 'computers', but MS Windows's inferior
design.  You really ought to have Linux installed."
</p>

<p>
It's really sad when there is not even the slightest awareness that
the monopoly OS is not the only choice available.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, she and her spouse are at a total loss as to how to
approach it, other than calling the Geek Squad to re-install the
inferior system, and wait for it to happen all over again sometime in
the future.

Hello!
</p>

<p>
Last week I bought the third edition of the "Numerical Recipes"
(<a href="http://www.nr.com/">http://www.nr.com/</a>). I first used this book over ten years ago when
coding mathematical functions for a calculator software on the Commodore
Amiga. The third edition has more sections and more code in it. Today
the section 22.2 caught my eye. The title is "Diagnosing Machine
Parameters". It deals with the problems of floating-point arithmetic and
mentions the fact that IEEE 754 has the advantage of being defined and
known. A lot of older computing hardware had their own floating-point
representation with varying parameters.
</p>

<p>
The section introduces a piece of code for measuring these machine
parameters. It's called MACHAR, and published here:
<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3D51907&amp;dl=3DACM&amp;coll=3Dportal">http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3D51907&amp;dl=3DACM&amp;coll=3Dportal</a>
</p>

<p>
"Numerical software written in high-level languages often relies on
machine-dependent parameters to improve portability. MACHAR is an
evolving FORTRAN subroutine for dynamically determining thirteen
fundamental parameters associated with a floating-point arithmetic
system. The version presented here operates correctly on a large number
of different floating-point systems, including those implementing the
new IEEE Floating-Point Standard."
</p>

<p>
C source can be found here for example:
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/machar.c">http://www.netlib.org/blas/machar.c</a>
</p>

<p>
Just to let you know.

<p>
Kapil forgot at least one important term in his "EULA(1)":
</p>

<p>
* The software to be run can share the network interface state with the
parent and all siblings.
</p>

<p>
 In particular we have have to recognize that only one process (family)
on a given machine can bind to a given port to accept incoming requests.
For example, you can only have one sshd listening on port 22 on any given
interface, and one listening on the "catchall" interface.  If I have one
sshd listening on the catchall and one listening on the address bound
eth0:0 (both on TCP port 22), then any incoming request for that one
address will go to the second process; any other incoming requests will
go to the first one.
</p>

<p>
 (It's fairly rare to configure a system with a mixture of processes
listening on specific and catchall addresses, BTW; but it is possible).
</p>

<p>
 The key point here is that the chroot "virtualization" is not amenable
to hosting networking services, unless you can arrange some way to
dispatch the incoming connections to their respective chroot jailed
processes on different ports or IP aliases.
</p>

<p>
 However, overall I have been recommending chroot as a "super
lightweight virtualization" model for many years.  It only virtualizes
the file/directory structure, but that's often sufficient to development
work, for example.

&gt; &gt;  &gt; (Measuring TCP congestion window).
&gt; &gt;  &gt; What I observed was that  RTT is constant throughout the experiment I
&gt; &gt;  &gt; did with your code .
&gt; &gt;  &gt; I was wondering isn't it suppose to change  ?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt;  It depends on your test environment. What was the network link between
&gt; &gt;  the two hosts? If it was a local link (such as Ethernet) the RTT won't
&gt; &gt;  change much. You need a WAN link (simulated or real) to observe RTT
&gt; &gt;  variations. Unsaturated links don't produce very little RTT variations.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; I did tried that on intercontinental network. But I can access
&gt; network only through proxy server of my college. Does that create a
&gt; difference ?
</pre>

<p>
Yes, a proxy effectively cuts the TCP connection in two. You have one
connection from the client to the proxy, and one from the proxy to the
server. The RTT you are observing is the one between you and the proxy
server of your college. This may be the reason why there are no
variations.

<p>

Hi Edgar

<p>
I absolutely agree with you about "compiz". I do not see any advantages for me 
with firing disappearing windows! So the best new cheatcode for Knoppix 5.3.1 
is

... but let taste be taste. Knoppix 5.3.1 is really the most mature live-CD

Hi,

<p>
I enjoyed the article on deadlock detection. I wanted you to know that I developed a library and utility that do basically the same thing. One notable difference is that hierarchical trees of locks are built at the run time.

&gt;  &gt; &gt;  And, finally, corrupted ISO downloads. A friend taught me how to fix
&gt;  &gt; &gt; these: If your ISO is corrupted, it seems like all you have to do to fix
&gt;  &gt; &gt; it is to create/get a torrent of it, stick the corrupted download in the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; directory where the ISO will be downloaded to by default, and let the
&gt;  &gt; &gt; torrent system correct it for you!
&gt;  &gt;
&gt;  &gt; I can't see this working at all.  Were you told this on April 1st?  ;)
&gt;
&gt;  I was, now that I go through my chat logs, but the person who asked me about
&gt;  whether or not I had the file handy for a torrent, and introduced me to this,
&gt;  had previously posted for help for the image he was requesting, a few days

<h3>2-cent Tip: Compiz-Fusion</h3>

<b>Fri, 25 Apr 2008 06:13:25 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
This tip goes out to all the students who use Linux, with Compiz-Fusion...
</p>

<p>
How many students have been working on something, like, for example, updating 
their software, or checking their e-mail, or getting tech support on IRC, when 
a teacher walks up, glances at your screen, and <em>gasps</em> because
"That's not school work!  You, you <em>must</em> be Hacking the system!!" 
</p>

<p>
*raises hand*
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Compiz-fusion, I've been able to avoid this with even the most...  
shall we say obstinate? teachers out there...
</p>

<p>
As some of you may know, Compiz-Fusion allows one to reduce the opacity of 
individual windows by using &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;ScrollWheelDown&gt;, and restore the opacity 
with &lt;Alt&gt;+&lt;ScrollWheelUp&gt;.
</p>

<p>
However, some may not be fooled...  Not to worry, you can make it look like 
it's a part of your desktop background...
</p>

<p>
Open up the CompizConfig util, and activate the Freewins plugin.  Press 
&lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;, click in the window you want to make more hidden, and move 
the mouse around.  Your window has... rotated!  Press 
&lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;shift&gt;+&lt;MouseButton3&gt; or &lt;MouseButtons1and2simultaneiously&gt; to return 
the window to its proper rotation.  The only drawback currently with this 
rotated window is that the inputs, like text input boxes, menus, buttons, 
even the window decorations, still expect the mouse clicks to be where the 
items are supposed to be when the window is non-rotated.
</p>

<p>
Hope this makes for some more happy Linuxing!
</p>

<p>
Of course, the best way to keep from getting into trouble, is to do your work 
in class.  And not goof off.  But, if you're using Linux, and it looks 
different from what some teachers expect, no amount of explaining will keep 
you out of their "watchlists".  Been there, done that.  Even had to explain 
to the principal (!!) that I wasn't doing anything wrong.  That was not a 
Good Day...

<p>
Tired of script-generated logs cluttered with escape
characters all over the place
</p>

<p>
Try to change the terminal into "dumb" and repeat:
<pre class='code'>
$ export TERM=dumb
$ script
&lt;do whatever necessary to be logged&gt;
&lt;type exit or press Ctrl-D&gt;
$ export TERM=xterm
Switch back to vt100, xterm, or other when you're done, to recover your
terminal's original mode.
</pre>
Observe the generated log:
<pre class='code'>
$ cat -A typescript
 
mulyadi@mushu:/tmp$ ls^M$
gconfd-mulyadi^I^I  mc-mulyadi^I ssh-tYecBM5768^M$

keyring-HzVeHi^I^I  plugtmp^I typescript^M$
mapping-mulyadi^I^I  sqlGIskW0^I virtual-mulyadi.SGmoJb^M$
</pre>

<p>
Note that we see ^I, ^M, and so on because of the -A option on "cat". This
is needed, so we are sure there are no escape characters there.

<h3>2-cent Tip: Poisoning the spammers</h3>

Ben Okopnik [ben at linuxgazette.net]

</p>

<b>Sat, 10 May 2008 13:03:36 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
I saw a Web page the other day, talking about a cute idea: since the
spammers are always trawling the Net for links and e-mail addresses, why
not give them some nice ones? For a certain value of "nice", that is...
</p>

<p>
However, when I looked at the implementation of this idea, the author
had put a "badgeware" restriction on using it - not something I could
see doing - so I wrote a version of it from scratch, with a few
refinements. Take a look:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://okopnik.com/cgi-bin/poison.cgi">http://okopnik.com/cgi-bin/poison.cgi</a>
</p>

<p>
A randomly-generated page, with lots of links and addresses - with the
links all pointing back to the script itself (somewhat obscured, so they
don't look exactly the same), so the spammers can harvest even more of
these addresses. Mmm, yummy!
</p>

<p>
The addresses are made up of a random string "at" a domain made up of
several random words joined together with a random TLD. There is some
tiny chance of it matching a real address, but the probability is pretty
low.
</p>

<p>
If you want to download this gadget, it's available at
<a href="http://okopnik.com/misc/poison.cgi.txt">http://okopnik.com/misc/poison.cgi.txt</a> (and, once the next issue of <em>LG</em>
comes out, at '<a href="../151/misc/lg/poison.cgi.txt">http://linuxgazette.net/151/misc/lg/poison.cgi.txt</a>'.) I
suggest renaming it to something else <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">, and linking to it - the link
doesn't have to be visible [1] - from a few of your real Web pages. If
enough people started doing this, life would become a lot more pleasant.
Well, not for spammers, but that's the whole point...
 
</p>

<p>
[1] '&lt;a href="poison.cgi" border="0"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;' at the end of a page should
be invisible but still serve the purpose.
</p>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Wind River joins forces with Intel on Auto Linux</h3>
<p>
<p>Wind River and Intel hope to dramatically disrupt the automotive industry's
in-vehicle infotainment market, introducing open source solutions to
challenge the current proprietary approach currently taken by the auto
industry.</p>

<p>The two companies have collaborated to create an open source Linux
platform optimized for Intel's tiny new Atom processor. The specifications
and the code from the platform will be released by Wind River to the open
source community via <a
href="http://moblin.org/community/ivi/index.php">Moblin.org</a>.</p>

<p>Wind River also unveiled a platform based on an automotive-optimized
commercial Linux. The Wind River Linux Platform for Infotainment is
optimized for Atom, and offers integration with many leading third-party
networking and multimedia applications, including speech-recognition
technologies by Nuance Communications; Bluetooth and noise reduction
solutions by Parrot; music management technologies by Gracenote; multimedia
networking solutions by SMSC; and DVD playback by Corel's LinDVD.</p>

<p> This approach will enable the development of Open Infotainment
Platforms that are based on interoperable, standards-based hardware and
software components. This will allow manufacturers to scale software across
devices, leading to cost and development efficiencies.</p>

<p>Wind River expects to deliver the open source specification and code to
the <a href="http://Moblin.org">Moblin.org</a> in-vehicle infotainment
community in August 2008.</p>

<p>Companies such as BMW Group, Bosch, Delphi and Magneti Marelli are actively
supporting Wind River's strategy to drive Linux into the automotive market.
Wind River already plays a leading role in collaborating with industry
consortia aimed at developing open, Linux-based software platforms, namely:
Eclipse, SCOPE-Alliance, OpenSAF, The Linux Foundation, LiMo Foundation and
Open Handset Alliance.</p>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">NetBeans Community Links to PHP Community with NetBeans Early Access for PHP</h3>
<p>At CommunityOne 2008 in May, Sun Microsystems and the NetBeans
community announced NetBeans IDE 6.1 General Availability and the
NetBeans IDE Early Access for the PHP scripting language, bringing the power
of NetBeans to Web 2.0 developers. A download is available at
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org">http://www.netbeans.org</a>.</p>

<p>NetBeans IDE Early Access for PHP includes intelligent editing features
such as prioritized code completion, instant rename, mark occurrences,
dynamic code templates, and easy navigation. Besides the editor, it
provides debugging support, deployment to the local server, dynamic help,
and sample projects making it easier to get started with PHP development.
It also provides support for embedded CSS, HTML and JavaScript(TM)
technologies.  More details can be found here: <a
href="http://www.netbeans.org/features/web/web-app.html">http://www.netbeans.org/features/web/web-app.html</a></p>

<p>NetBeans evangelist Gregg Sporar told Linux Gazette:
"The Early Access version of NetBeans support for PHP supports version 5.2
of the PHP language.  Our goal is to also support version 5.3 of PHP later
this year when we do a final release of our PHP support.  Support for PHP 6
is on our road map, but is further out."</p>

<p>NetBeans 6.1 IDE includes new features for developing Ajax web applications
using JavaScript(TM) technology and delivers tighter integration with
MySQL(TM) database.</p>

<p>JavaScript technology support is based on the dynamic language
infrastructure added for the Ruby programming language and includes:
semantic highlighting, code completion, type analysis, quick fixes, semantic
checks and refactoring. Version 6.1 also adds in a browser compatibility
feature that makes it easier to write JavaScript code to run in Mozilla
Firefox, Opera, Safari or Windows Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>The NetBeans Database Explorer in NetBeans IDE 6.1 makes it easier to
create, start and stop MySQL databases and to connect to and browse a
database's tables. Other new NetBeans features include faster startup and
code completion, enhanced support for Ruby and JRuby, including a new Ruby
platform manager and support for IBM's Rational ClearCase version control
system.</p>

<p>For a full list of features or to download the NetBeans 6.1 IDE, visit:
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org">http://www.netbeans.org</a>.</p>

<p>The free NetBeans Day community track offered developers a chance to learn
from the experts, find out firsthand what's new and what's coming in the
NetBeans IDE and Platform and to network with other members of the
community. <a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone">http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone</a></p>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">OpenSolaris goes LiveCD</h3>
<p>
At the CommunityOne Developer Conference, Sun and the OpenSolaris community
jointly announced a refreshed OpenSolaris, based on Sun's Solaris kernel and
created through community collaboration. This version has many of the GNU
and open source tools expected by Linux users and an enhanced package
manager.  Download the OpenSolaris OS now at <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/">http://www.opensolaris.com/</a>.</p>

<p>"OpenSolaris ... combines the strong foundation of Solaris technologies and
tools with modern desktop features and applications developed by open source
communities such as GNOME, Mozilla and the Free Software Foundation," said
Stephen Lau, OpenSolaris Governing Board member. "OpenSolaris provides an
ideal environment for students, developers and early adopters looking to
learn and gain experience with innovative technologies like ZFS, Zones and
DTrace. And yes, it uses bash by default."</p>

<p>LiveCD installation and the new network-based OpenSolaris Image Packaging
System (IPS) simplify and speed installation and integration with
third-party applications. OpenSolaris IPS increases installation speed and
accuracy by providing better control of applications and dependencies and
offers easy-to-use system management. At a keynote demo, the LiveCD came up
in about a minute.  A full disk install had about 2 minutes of screens and
then took 15 minutes on demo system.</p>

<p>The OpenSolaris OS is the first OS to feature ZFS as its default file
system, protecting work with instant roll-back and continual check-summing
capabilities to allow users to test ideas. Its Dynamic Tracing (DTrace)
feature provides safe, pervasive observability of production systems to
accelerate application development and optimization of the AMP/MARS stack.
Additionally Solaris Containers can build virtualization-aware applications
that can be deployed on single machines through multi-CPU and multi-core
systems, without worrying if third-party software will work.</p>

<p>This release is called OpenSolaris 2008.5; the next major release is 2008.11
in 6 months.</p>

Group and is the first Concordia event to focus on policy and entitlements
management and associated standards such as XACML and WS-Policy.</p>

<p>The interactive session will feature representatives from Boeing, Cisco,
Micron Technology and the US Army, among others, presenting use case
scenarios to a Concordia technical team made up of representatives from,
among others, IBM, BEA and Liberty Alliance. Registration and more
information about the workshop is available at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4dvtpa">http://tinyurl.com/4dvtpa</a></p>

<p>The June 23 workshop follows the RSA Conference 2008 event where the
community held its first interoperability demonstrations. Nearly 600
attended the public workshop where FuGen Solutions, Internet2, Microsoft,
Oracle, Ping Identity, Sun Microsystems and Symlabs demonstrated
interoperability scenarios designed to meet deployer requirements using Info
Card, Liberty Alliance, and WS-* identity protocols. Previous meetings have
taken place at RSA Conference 2007, Catalyst 2007, Digital ID World, the
Identity Open Space (IOS) and the Internet Identity Workshop (IIW). All
organizations and individuals interested in contributing to the deployment
of standardized policy frameworks and proven interoperable standards-based
solutions are  encouraged to attend the June 23 workshop.</p>

<p>
<p>Less than a month after the release of the new version of Ubuntu, and
following a half-year of its own development, the Fedora Project has
introduced the Fedora 9 Linux distribution, a.k.a. 'Sulfur'. This distro sports
a Linux 2.6.25 kernel, Glibc 2.8, and current versions of GNOME and KDE.  It
also adds PackageKit, a cross-distribution package management solution. </p>

<p>Fedora still has a complex install and there are reported problems
coexisting with other OSes, something that Ubuntu has had in hand for a
while, but this is a solid release with broad hardware support.</p>

<p>For more information on Fedora 9 visit: <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">http://fedoraproject.org</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="[lightning bolt]" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Firefox 3 Release Candidate 1 is out</h3>
<p>
After almost 3 years of fixes and feature development, Firefox 3 Release
Candidate 1 is now available for download.</p>

<p>Many new features and changes to the platform for Firefox 3 can be previewed
now, including security enhancements and performance improvements over both
FireFox 2 and IE 7. FF 3 will also do a better job at memory management.</p>

<p>Most new features are stable in the RC version, but several users have posted
that about half of their Mozilla extensions, which worked well with Beta 4
and 5, are not working with the new RC1.  The release notes mention this
problem and add the following caution:  "Poorly designed or incompatible
extensions can cause problems with your browser, including make it crash,
slow down page display, etc.". Mozilla recommends starting FF 3 in safe 
mode and removing the offending extension to resume normal operation.</p>

<p>Firefox 3 Release Candidate 1 is available in more than 45 languages as a
public preview and can be downloaded from the Firefox Release Candidates
page.</p>

<h1>Deividson on Databases: Triggers</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dokopnik.html">Deividson Luiz Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Triggers</h3>

<p>Triggers are pieces of code executed automatically when a certain
action happens. That action can be any kind of data manipulation
(insertion, update, or deletion). It can also be executed before or after
the actual data manipulation, having different options and uses
(validating data, allowing or disallowing data manipulations, changing
other data, etc.).</p>

<p>In PostgreSQL, triggers are special <a
href="../150/dokopnik.html"><em>stored procedures</em></a> - so everything
we saw on the last article can be used here, too. Let's go down to an
example:</p>

<h3>Example 1: Hit Counting</h3>

<p>This can be used on a web page, or something similar. We will have
a table to store the ID and IP of each access (you can store any
information you want here, such as referrer, time and date, etc.), and
another table with a single row to store the actual page views (this can be
extended to have an ID for each page on your site, storing individual
hits.) Here is the SQL to create these tables:</p>

<pre class="code">CREATE TABLE access
(
  access_id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  access_ip text
);

CREATE TABLE hit
(
  hit_id serial NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  hit_value integer
);
insert into hit values(0, 0);</pre>

<p>We'll want to increment the "hit_value" of ID 0 every time an access is
recorded. We could use a simple "select count()" to count accesses, but
that would mean losing the count when you do a clean up on the access
table. (We will not want all that data there forever, will we?) To do it
right, first we need to create a procedure that increments the "hit"
table when "hit_id" = 0. This is the SQL to create this procedure:</p>

<pre class="code">create or replace function add_hit()
returns TRIGGER as $$
begin
	if(TG_OP='INSERT') then
		update hit set hit_value = (select hit_value from hit where hit_id = 0) +1 where hit_id = 0;
	end if;
	return new;
end; 
$$ Language PLPGSQL;</pre>

<p>Here, we see three new commands/features in addition to what we used in
the last article in this series: the first one is "returns TRIGGER as $$".
This is a trigger-specific return type to hold the changed data that will
be stored/updated/deleted from the database, useful when you need to add or
change the data before inserting into the database. The other new command
is "if(TG_OP='INSERT')". TG_OP will store the operation being executed in
the database - useful when you use the same trigger on more than one event
(insert/update/delete). And finally, we have "return new". "New" is an
internal variable that stores the data after the changes. (In an insert,
<tt>new</tt> is the data being inserted; on an update, <tt>new</tt> is the
existing data after the update; on a delete, <tt>new</tt> does not exist.)
Along with "new", there is also "old", which stores the data before the
changes: on delete, <tt>old</tt> is the data that will be deleted; on an
update, <tt>old</tt> is the data that will be changed, before the change;
on an insert, <tt>old</tt> does not exist.</p>

<p>Now, we will turn our stored procedure into a trigger and activate it.
Here is the SQL to do that:</p>

<pre class="code">
create TRIGGER tg_add_hit before insert on access for each row execute procedure add_hit();
</pre>

<p>The syntax is pretty simple - "create TRIGGER &lt;trigger name&gt;
&lt;before/after&gt; &lt;event(s)&gt; for each &lt;row/statement&gt;
execute procedure &lt;procedure name&gt;([parameters])". <tt>trigger name</tt> is
a unique name to identify the trigger, <tt>before/after</tt> defines if the
procedure will be executed before or after the actual data change,
<tt>events</tt> are the events when the trigger will be executed - 'insert',
'update', 'delete', or a mix of them ("on insert or update"). <tt>for each row</tt>
means that the trigger will be executed for each row of data that gets
changed, while the <tt>for each</tt> statement means it will only be executed once,
no matter how many rows a single statement modifies. In the end, there's
the procedure name and its parameters, if it takes any.</p>

<p>Now, to test this trigger, we'll run "select * from hit" to check the
current count (should be 0). Then, insert an access with "insert into
access(access_ip) values('111');". Then, do a "select * from hit" again,
and you will notice that the count changed.</p>

<h3>Example 2: Stock/Inventory Control</h3>

<p>A classic use of triggers is stock/inventory control - keeping a
record of how many of each product you have in stock, and using triggers
to change the number of remaining items when some are sold. We will use
the following tables in this example:</p>

<pre class="code">create table product(
pro_id serial primary key,
pro_name varchar(50),
pro_quant integer);

create table sale(
sale_id serial primary key,
sale_value date default current_date);

create table sale_product(
sp_id serial primary key, 
sale_id integer references sale(sale_id),
pro_id integer references product(pro_id), 
sp_quant integer);

insert into product(pro_name, pro_quant) values ('Computer', 10);
insert into product(pro_name, pro_quant) values ('Printer', 15);
insert into product(pro_name, pro_quant) values ('Monitor', 10);
insert into sale(sale_id) values (0);</pre>

<p>Pretty simple - although I left some "details" (prices, clients, etc.)
out of it so we could focus on the quantities and on our trigger. I've also
created some basic test data for the products and sales tables. Now, let's
create the stored procedure to remove products when they are sold, and
activate the trigger for it. Here's the SQL to do that:</p>

<pre class="code">create or replace function upd_stock()
returns TRIGGER as $$
begin
	if((TG_OP='DELETE') OR (TG_OP='UPDATE')) then
	  update product set pro_quant = pro_quant + OLD.sp_quant where pro_id = OLD.pro_id;
	end if;
	if((TG_OP='UPDATE') OR (TG_OP='INSERT')) then
  	  update product set pro_quant = pro_quant - NEW.sp_quant where pro_id = NEW.pro_id;
	end if;

	if(TG_OP='DELETE') then
		return old;
	else
		return new;
	end if;
end; 
$$ Language PLPGSQL;

create TRIGGER tg_upd_stock before insert or update or delete on sale_product for each row execute procedure upd_stock();</pre>

<p>OK, this one is a bit more complex, so let's go through it slowly.
First, it's a trigger that runs on every event ("on insert or update or
delete"). If the user is deleting data, it will only give the amount
sold back to the stock. If it's an insert, then it will remove only the
products being sold from the stock. Finally, if it's updating
(changing), then the trigger will first add the old amount back into the
product table, then it will remove the new quantity. This is done to
prevent data corruption. Even if your system does not support data
deletion, for example, this ensures that your database will remain
correct, no matter what happens.</p>

<p>Now, if you do want to practice stored procedures and triggers, there
are two additions you need to make to this last example. The first one will
add a table to store data when you buy stuff and a trigger to add the
products to the stock; the second one will add a total to the sales table,
add the price of the product to the products table and the price of the
product when it was sold to the sale_product table, and create a trigger
to add the price of the sold products to the sale total.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>PostgreSQL is a very advanced database system, and some of its features
can aid you greatly in developing systems, eliminate the need for a
considerable amount of external code, and usually result in a faster
solution, reduced bandwidth requirements, etc. The options we saw in this
series of articles are very powerful but are usually under-used - so it's
good to remember that they exist. Who knows - next time you are developing
something, they might be exactly what you need. </p>

<h1>gDesklets: Beauty with a Purpose</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/john.html">Maxin B. John</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<h3>A Quest for Beauty</h3>
<p>
gDesklets provides a bunch of easy-to-use yet eye-pleasing applications for
the GNU/Linux desktop. Mini-applications called <em>desklets</em> can be
developed and executed for the desktop to meet specific needs. Since
gDesklets is known to work on KDE and XFCE, along with GNOME, it can
provide an enchanting look to the Linux Desktop.
</p>

<h3>Installing gDesklets</h3>

<p>
In the case of Debian Etch or Ubuntu 7.xx, installation of gDesklets is
as easy as
</p>

<pre>
apt-get install gdesklets
</pre>

<p>For Fedora users, add the 'freshrpms' repository to the list of
repositories for yum. For that, create a 'freshrpm.repo' file in your
/etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. The content of the file should be:</p>

<pre>
[freshrpms]
name=FreshRPMs for Fedora Core $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=http://ayo.freshrpms.net/fedora/linux/$releasever/$basearch/freshrpms
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=http://freshrpms.net/RPM-GPG-KEY-freshrpms
</pre>

<p>
Now, issue the command
</p>

<pre>
yum install gdesklet
</pre>

<p>
This will install gDesklets on your machine.
</p>

<p>
For other distributions, source code for the latest gDesklets can be
downloaded from <a
href="http://www.gdesklets.de/">http://www.gdesklets.de/</a> <a
href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>. Following the steps listed below will
install gDesklets onto your machine:
</p>

<pre>
wget http://www.gdesklets.de/files/gDesklets-0.35.4.tar.bz2
tar jxvf gDesklets-0.35.4.tar.bz2 
cd gDesklets-0.35.4
./configure
make
make install
</pre>

<p class="editorial">
[ When installing software from source, please make sure to never run
the steps <tt>tar x ...</tt>, <tt>./configure</tt> and <tt>make</tt>
as <tt>root</tt>. Always use a non-privileged user account for these
steps. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<p>
We can invoke the gDesklets program by issuing the command "gdesklet" in
the shell, or by selecting gDesklets via <tt>Applications -&gt; accessories
-&gt; gDesklets</tt>. However, remember to start it as an ordinary user -
you won't be able to invoke gDesklets as the "root" user. Some desklets to
be used with gDesklets can be downloaded from the <a
href="http://www.gdesklets.de/?q=desklet/browse">gDesklets Web site</a>.
The downloaded desklets can be installed into your system with the help of
the gDesklet manager application; to install them, just drag and drop the
downloaded *.tar.gz files on the gDesklets manager icon.
</p>

</p>

<h3>The gDesklets Framework</h3>

<p>
gDesklets is implemented in Python, which is an interpreted,
interactive, object-oriented, extensible programming language.
The gDesklets' framework looks like this:</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/john/framework.png" alt="gdesklets framework" width="400" height="134">
</p>

<ol>
<li> A daemon runs in the background as a server, providing a socket
for communication. Clients connect to the socket to give instructions to
the daemon, which is responsible for loading and running applets.  </li>
<li>
The user interface of applets is defined by ADL, a simple yet
powerful XML-based language.</li>
<li>
The XML-defined user interface can be brought to life with inline scripts -
i.e., Python scripts that are directly written into the XML or imported
there to be executed in a secure sandbox.</li>
<li>The libdesklets library can be used to assist implementation
of sandboxed Python scripting. Sandboxed scripting code uses controls to
access otherwise unreachable data. Basically, they provide a controlled
way to access data outside the sandbox.</li>
</ol>

<h3>A gDesklet Hello, World</h3>

<p>
The main advantages of Python lie in its clarity and ease of use. Since
gDesklets is written in Python, it is both elegant and simple.
</p>

<p>
Now, let's create our very first desklet. The file structure of an ordinary
gDesklet is:</p>

<pre>
hello.tar.gz:
  -&gt;hello/
  -&gt;hello/helloworld.display
  -&gt;hello/hello.png
</pre>

<p>
(The content of 'hello.display' is available <a href="misc/john/hello.display">here</a>.)</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/john/removal.jpg" alt="gdesklets framework" width="640" height="480">
</p>

<p>
The meta tag contains information about your desklet - e.g., the name of
the author, name of the desklet, the version, etc. - which can be viewed in
the gDesklets manager application. The meta tag is optional for every
desklet; the preview file ("hello.png", in this case) is also optional.

<p>To create our desklet and load it in the gDesklet manager
application, perform the following steps:</p>

<pre class="code">
mkdir hello
cp helloworld.display hello
cp hello.png hello
tar czvf hello.tar.gz hello
</pre>

<p>
Now, the desklet is ready for use and can be loaded into the gDesklets
manager.  After installation, it can be removed by simply clicking on the
desklet and choosing the 'remove' option.</p>

<h3>Using the Controls in gDesklets</h3>

<p>
The controls in gDesklets allow your inline scripts access to any kind of
data with the help of the 'gdesklets' library. This mechanism maintains the
integrity and security of the sandbox scripting environment which is the
backbone of the gDesklets. In effect, controls help to share the
functionality among desklets without duplicating it. Let's create another
simple gDesklet that uses a control to show the second-by-second load
average of the processor.
</p>

<P>
The content of processor.display is available <a href="misc/john/processor.display">here</a>.</p>

<p>
The control tag loads a particular control by the cited interface, and
binds it to the cited ID. The first step in using the control in your
desklet is to find the control's unique interface identity. For the
System interface, which provides information like CPU load, network
statistics, memory statistics, etc., the unique interface string is
<tt>ISystem:4zcicmk4botcub7iypo46t2l7-2</tt>. The corresponding unique interface
string for each control is obtained from the gDesklets manager
application, by browsing through the controls installed in the system.
</p>

<p>
Then pack the processor desklet, just like we did before:
</p>

<pre>
processor.tar.gz:
  -&gt;processor/
  -&gt;processor/processor.display
</pre>

<p>
Now the processor desklet is ready for deployment via the gDesket
manager application. See our desklet in action:
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/john/processor.jpg" alt="Controls in Gdesklets" width="640" height="480">
</p>

<h3>Plotting the Network Usage Graph</h3>

<p>
The plotter element in gDesklets allows us to generate graphs of various
data such as processor usage, free memory available, network speed, etc. in
real time on our desktop. Now, let's dare to plot a real-time graph that
shows the number of incoming packets on our eth0 network interface.
</p>

<p>
(The content of netspeed.display is available <a href="misc/john/netspeed.display">here</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Now, as usual, create the desklet (netspeed.tar.gz) using the netspeed.display file.
</p>

<pre>
netspeed.tar.gz:
  -&gt;netspeed/
  -&gt;netspeed/netspeed.display
</pre>

<h3> Let's create our own control</h3>

<p>
The real power of gDesklets lies in the fact that the user can extend its
capabilities by writing his or her own controls. Controls are Python
classes derived from the Control base class and from the interfaces they
implement. Now, let's see how to roll a simple control of our own. Since
the control needs to be verified, we will also write a small desklet that
uses our "home-made" control.  </p>

<p>
Most of the controls live in <tt>/usr/lib/gdesklets/Controls</tt>. We'll
create an 'ntp' directory there, and create a control to retrieve the
precise time by contacting an NTP server. The Network Time Protocol is a
protocol used for synchronizing the clocks of computer systems over
packet-switched, variable-latency data networks. Through the gDesklet
control and desklet, we will contact the Red Hat NTP server
(0.fedora.pool.ntp.org), fetch the time, and display it on the desktop.
Please note that this desklet won't be syncing the clocks; it will be just
displaying the precise time on the desktop.</p>

<p>
The control directory has to include all interface files from which the
control inherits. Usually, the filenames of interface files start with
an "I" - so here the name of the interface file is Intp.py. The
__init__.py is a mandatory file for a control. Every property in the
interfaces must be implemented by creating appropriate property objects.
</p>

<p> 
The directory structure of a simple control (here, <tt>ntp</tt>) looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
ntp/
  Intp.py
  __init__.py

</pre>

<p>
The Intp.py file is:
</p>

<pre>
from libdesklets.controls import Interface, Permission

class Intp(Interface):
    ntp_time = Permission.READ

</pre>

<p>
The __init__.py file is:
</p>

<pre>
from libdesklets.controls import Control

from Intp import Intp
from socket import *
import struct
import sys
import time

class ntp(Control, Intp):

    def __init__(self):
        Control.__init__(self)
	pass
    def __get_time(self):
     	Server = ''
	EPOCH = 2208988800L
	Server = '0.fedora.pool.ntp.org'
	client = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM )
	data = '\x1b' + 47 * '\0'
       	client.sendto( data, ( Server, 123 ))
       	data, address = client.recvfrom( 1024 )
       	if data:
        	t = struct.unpack( '!12I', data )[10]
           	t -= EPOCH
          	return time.ctime(t)
    ntp_time=  property(__get_time, doc = "the current time")     

def get_class():
	return ntp
</pre>

<p>
The interface identifiers are made up of a human-readable name given by
the interface's author and a random-looking string. That string is
based on a checksum of the interface, and is affected by any changes to
the interface, except for changes in comments in the desklet code. The
gDesklets manager program will auto-generate the interface identifier for
each control, so we don't have to worry about the interface identifier for
our NTP control.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/john/ntp.jpg" alt="NTP Control" width="640" height="480">
</p>

<p>
<a href="misc/john/ntptest.display">Verification program</a> for our control.
</p>

<p>
Then, pack the processor desklet, like this:
</p>

<pre>
ntptest.tar.gz:
  -&gt;ntptest/
  -&gt;ntptest/ntptest.display
</pre>

<p>Now the processor desklet as well as the control is ready for use.</p> 

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
gDesklets is an answer to those who complain that Linux is a geek's
operating system; it adds spice to the capabilities of Linux by combining
beauty and purpose on the Linux desktop. It also makes life a bit easier
for the common GNU/Linux desktop user.  </p>

<p> [1] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  This is
called fetching an "upstream tarball", as opposed to a maintained
package tailored for the user's Linux distribution, and in my considered
view should be a last-resort method of installing any significant
software, if one is absolutely certain that no package from or for one's
distribution exists.  There are several compelling reasons for this
preference, and I detailed them <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/118/weatherwax.html#1">a few years ago</a>,

<h1>Monitoring Function Calls</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/melinte.html">Aurelian Melinte</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
 
<h3>Overview </h3>

<p>There are tools to monitor the system calls an application makes, but how
 about monitoring your own written functions - inside the program itself?  
 What if we want to check when a function is entered, which arguments is the
 function called with, when the function exits, and what the returned value is?
 This article presents a proof-of-concept tool to achieve this without 
 modifying the application's code. </p> 

<p>While the gcc compiler will instrument the code for us, some of the details
 left to the programmer are both compiler-version dependent and CPU-dependent 
 - namely retrieving the function arguments and return values. Thus, the
 discussion here is based on experiments with gcc compiler suites 4.1 
 and 4.2, Intel processors, and binutils 2.18. </p>


<h3>Code instrumentation</h3>

<p>We want to address the following points: </p>
<ul>
  <li>when a function/method is entered and exited</li>
  <li>what the call arguments were when the function is entered</li>
  <li>what the return code was when the function is exited</li>
  <li>optionally, where the function was called from</li>
</ul>

<p>The first one is easy: if requested, the compiler will instrument functions
 and methods, so that when a function/method is entered, a call to an
 instrumentation function is made, and when the function is exited, a similar
 instrumentation call is made: </p>

<pre class="code">
    void __cyg_profile_func_enter(void *func, void *callsite); 
    void __cyg_profile_func_exit(void *func, void *callsite); 
</pre>

<p>This is achieved by compiling the code with the <tt>-finstrument-functions</tt> flag.
The above two functions can be used, for instance, to collect data for
coverage or for profiling. We will use them to print a trace of
function calls.  Furthermore, we can isolate these two functions and the
supporting code in an interposition library of our own. This library can
be loaded when and if needed, thus leaving the application code
basically unchanged. </p>

<p>Now when the function is entered, we get the arguments of the call:</p>

<pre class="code">
    void __cyg_profile_func_enter( void *func, void *callsite )
    {
        char buf_func[CTRACE_BUF_LEN+1] = {0};
        char buf_file[CTRACE_BUF_LEN+1] = {0}; 
        char buf_args[ARG_BUF_LEN + 1] = {0}; 
        pthread_t self = (pthread_t)0;
        int *frame = NULL;
        int nargs = 0;
    
        self = pthread_self(); 
        frame = (int *)__builtin_frame_address(1); /*of the 'func'*/

        /*Which function*/
        libtrace_resolve (func, buf_func, CTRACE_BUF_LEN, NULL, 0);
        
        /*From where.  KO with optimizations. */
        libtrace_resolve (callsite, NULL, 0, buf_file, CTRACE_BUF_LEN);
        
        nargs = nchr(buf_func, ',') + 1; /*Last arg has no comma after*/ 
        nargs += is_cpp(buf_func);       /*'this'*/
        if (nargs &gt; MAX_ARG_SHOW)
            nargs = MAX_ARG_SHOW;

        printf("T%p: %p %s %s [from %s]\n", 
               self, (int*)func, buf_func, 
               args(buf_args, ARG_BUF_LEN, nargs, frame), 
               buf_file);
    }
</pre>


<p>And when the function is is exited, we get the return value:</p>

<pre class="code">
    void __cyg_profile_func_exit( void *func, void *callsite )
    {
        long ret = 0L; 
        char buf_func[CTRACE_BUF_LEN+1] = {0};
        char buf_file[CTRACE_BUF_LEN+1] = {0}; 
        pthread_t self = (pthread_t)0;

        GET_EBX(ret); 
        self = pthread_self(); 

        /*Which function*/
        libtrace_resolve (func, buf_func, CTRACE_BUF_LEN, NULL, 0);
        
        printf("T%p: %p %s =&gt; %d\n", 
               self, (int*)func, buf_func, 
               ret);

        SET_EBX(ret); 
    }
</pre>


<p>Since these two instrumentation functions are aware of addresses, and we
 actually want the trace to be readable by humans, we need also a way to 
 resolve symbol addresses to symbol names: this is what libtrace_resolve() 
 does. </p>


<h3>Binutils and libbfd</h3>

<p>First, we have to have the symbol information handy. To achieve this, 
 we compile our application with the '-g' flag. Then, we can map addresses 
 to symbol names. This would normally require writing some code 
 that is aware of the ELF format. </p>

<p>Luckily, there is the binutils package, which comes with a library that
 does just that - <tt>libbfd</tt> - and with a tool - <tt>addr2line</tt>. addr2line is a good 
 example of how to use libbfd, and I have simply used it to wrap around libbfd.
 The result is the libtrace_resolve() function.  For details, please refer to
 the README in the code accompanying this article. </p>

<p>Since the instrumentation functions are isolated in a stand-alone module, 
 we tell this module the name of the instrumented executable through an
 environment variable (CTRACE_PROGRAM) that we set before running the program.
 This is needed to properly init libbfd to search for symbols. </p>

<p>Note: binutils is a work in progress. I have used version 2.18. It does
an amazingly good job, although function inlining affects its precision.</p>


<h3>Stack Layout </h3>

<p>To address the first point, the work has been architecture-agnostic.
(Actually, libbfd is aware of the architecture, but things are hidden
behind its API.)  However, to retrieve function arguments and return
values, we have to look at the stack, write a bit of
architecture-specific code, and exploit some gcc quirks. Again, the
compilers I have used were gcc 4.1 and 4.2; later or previous versions
might work differently. In short: </p> 

<ul> 
<li>x86 dictates that the stack grows down</li> 
<li>GCC dictates how the stack is used - a "typical"
    stack is depicted below.</li> 
<li>each function has a stack frame marked by the ebp (base pointer) 
    and esp (stack pointer) registers. </li>
<li>normally, we expect the eax register to contain the return code</li> 
</ul>

<pre class="code">
                                \
               +------------+   |
               | arg 2      |   \
               +------------+    &gt;- previous function's stack frame
               | arg 1      |   /
               +------------+   |
               | ret %eip   |   /
               +============+   
               | saved %ebp |   \
        %ebp-&gt; +------------+   |
               |            |   |
               |   local    |   \
               | variables, |    &gt;- current function's stack frame
               |    etc.    |   /
               |            |   |
               |            |   |
        %esp-&gt; +------------+   /
</pre>

<p>In an ideal world, the code the compiler generates would make sure that
upon instrumenting the exit of a function the return value was set and the
CPU registers were pushed on the stack (to ensure the instrumentation
function does not affects them). Then, it would call the instrumentation
function, and finally pop the registers. This sequence of code would ensure
we always get access to the return value in the instrumentation function.
The code generated by the compiler is a bit different... </p>

<p>Also, in practice, many of gcc's flags affect the stack layout and 
 registers usage. The most obvious ones are: </p>

  <ul>
  <li>-fomit-frame-pointer. This flag affects the stack offset where the
      arguments are to be found. </li>
  <li>The optimization flags (e.g., '-Ox'); each of these flags aggregates
  a number of optimizations. These flags did not affect the stack, and, 
      quite amazingly, arguments were always passed to functions through 
      the stack regardless of the optimization level. One would have 
      expected that some arguments would be passed through registers - in 
      which case getting these arguments would have proven difficult or
      even impossible. However, these flags did complicate recovering the 
      return code. Note that on some architectures, these flags will "suck in" 
      the -fomit-frame-pointer optimization. </li>
  </ul>

<p>In any case, be wary: the flags you use to compile your application 
 may hold hidden surprises. </p>


<h3>Function arguments</h3>

<p>In my tests with the compilers, all arguments were invariably passed 
 through the stack. Hence, this is trivial business, affected to a small 
 extent by the  -fomit-frame-pointer flag - this flag will change the offset 
 at which arguments start. </p>

<p>How many arguments does a function have; how many arguments are on the stack? 
 One way to infer the number of arguments is based on its signature 
 (for C++, beware of the "this" hidden argument), and this is the technique 
 used in __cyg_profile_func_enter(). </p>

<p>Once we know the offset where the arguments start on the stack and how many 
 of them there are, we just walk the stack to retrieve their values: </p>

<pre class="code">
    char *args(char *buf, int len, int nargs, int *frame)
    {
        int i; 
        int offset;

        memset(buf, 0, len); 

        snprintf(buf, len, "("); 
        offset = 1; 
        for (i=0; i&lt;nargs &amp;&amp; offset&lt;len; i++) {
            offset += snprintf(buf+offset, len-offset, "%d%s", 
                             *(frame+ARG_OFFET+i), 
                             i==nargs-1 ? " ...)" : ", ");
        }

        return buf; 
    }
</pre>


<h3>Function return values</h3>

<p>Obtaining the return value proved to be possible only when using the 
 -O0 flag. </p>

<p>Let's look what happens when using this method:</p>

<pre class="code">
    class B {
        ...
        virtual int m1(int i, int j) {printf("B::m1()\n"); f1(i); return 20;}
        ...
    }; 
</pre>

<p>is instrumented with -O0: </p>

<p>Note how the return code is moved into the ebx register - a bit unexpected
 since, traditionally, the eax register is used for return codes - and then 
 the instrumentation function is called. Good to retrieve the return value, 
 but to avoid the ebx register getting clobbered in the instrumentation
 function, we'll save it upon entering the function, and restore it when we
exit. </p>

 shown here is -O2), the code changes: </p>

<h1>Using Crontab</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/prestia.html">Joey Prestia</a></b></p>

<p>
Crontab is a very useful command used to run unattended scheduled 
tasks, which can decrease administrative time. There are also two similar 
commands: anacron and at. Anacron is for scheduling commands that do not 
require the computer to be on at all times; Anacron uses day-, week-, and 
month-type intervals. The "at" command runs a task once, at a set time,
and can also be very useful. But most commonly used is crontab, because
it is more versatile, and can be customized to run at any time
interval.</p>

<p>At our college, we have several servers running scripts which
back up critical data during off peak hours. We have automated these
procedures by using cron. For example, the backup script brings several
services to a stop, performs an rsync of any changes from the
hot server to a duplicate cold server, performs a standard tape
archive backup, and finally brings the halted services back online. I
sure am glad I don't have to be present at 1:00 AM, when this operation
is performed! Thanks to cron, all I have to do is load and unload the
backup devices and check my mail every morning to make sure all went
well. I also have other programs that are run periodically - I
would hate to have to remember to run these scripts every day.</p> 

<p>In administering your system, you will also need to use cron quite a
bit. This is done via the 'crontab' file, which lists the times and the
scripts to be executed. The system also has a default crontab file,
<tt>/etc/crontab</tt>, which runs certain scripts at set times: hourly,
daily, weekly, and monthly. This file can be kind of cryptic-looking at
first - so let's take the mystery out of it by breaking it down.</p>

[root@localhost ~]#
</pre> 

<p>
The first part simply sets a few variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
SHELL<dt><dd>The first line specifies the shell to use for parsing the
command line. "/bin/sh" is the default.
</dd> 

<dt>
PATH</dt><dd>Because cron runs as subshell process, we need to either
specify a path or use a PATH statement in crontab. The reason for this is
that we are not logging into a console when we run these jobs - so neither
.bashrc or .bash_profile have been sourced, and we have no environment
variables to work with as we do when we login as a regular user or as root.
It's also important to remember that trying to output data without a console
is pointless - there's no screen to display it on! - so you need to make
sure that any output that you want to save is logged somewhere.
</dd> 

<dt>
MAILTO</dt><dd>On the next line, we have a "MAILTO=" command sending the 
results of these cron jobs to the root user. If MAILTO is defined but
empty, mail from 'cron' will simply be discarded; if it's not set, then it
will be sent to the owner of the crontab. I will show a sample of this
additional output, later.
</dd> 

<dt>
HOME</dt><dd>The next line sets the home directory used by cron. If
unspecified, it will default to the entry in the owner's /etc/passwd file.
</dd>

<dt>
# run-parts</dt><dd>This line is actually just a comment specifying the
section, although "run-parts" is a command that will run all the scripts or
programs in the directory that is specified. There is even a man page for
run-parts.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The time field seems to be the part that everyone has problems with -
unless you're familiar with it, it can seem pretty cryptic. The rest is
very straightforward. The user column specifies the 'run-as' user, and the
"run-parts" command runs the scripts in the specified directory.  Note that
the directories are named by the interval at which they're run; you could
just place your scripts in the directory you wanted, and they would be run
at the times that are already set in the time section. This is not a good
idea, though, because you can forget they're in there.  It's by far better
to edit your crontab file and create your own cron job, because it's easier
to get a listing of your cron jobs this way and fine-tune them through via
the crontab command.  Keep in mind that this is the system crontab file
(it runs the system maintenance scripts and programs), so a user's crontab
will look a little different - in fact, the structure will be different -
so don't try to replicate this.
</p> 

<pre class="code">
#		Time	      User      Command       Path

</pre>


<h3>The Basics</h3>

<p>
There are two files that specify which users can and cannot use crontab:
/etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny. Usually, only cron.deny exists,
and it really couldn't be much simpler: If cron.deny is present,
and the user's username is in it (one user per line), then he or she is
denied use of the crontab command. If cron.allow is present, then only
users listed (one per line) in this file are allowed crontab use.</p>

<p>
In the crontab file, there are six fields for each entry, each field
separated by spaces or tabs.
</p>

<ul>
    <li> The first five fields specify when the command will be run.
    <li> The sixth field is the command itself.
</ul>

<pre>
          Minute - 0-59.
          Hour - 0-23 24-hour format.
          Day - 1-31 Day of the month.
          Month - 1-12 Month of the year.
          Weekday - 0-6 Day of the week. 0 refers to Sunday.
</pre> 

<p>
In the file, this would look as follows (the comments aren't necessary,
but they can be very convenient as a reminder):
</p>

<pre class="code">
# min(0-59)    hours(0-23)   day(1-31)   month(1-12)    dow(0-6)   command
   34               2           *            *             *       sh /root/backup.sh
</pre>

<p>
This example runs, at 2:34 AM every day of the month, every month of the year, 
every day of the week, the backup script called in the last column by
"sh /root/backup.sh". 
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ This, of course, requires the script to be written
in strict 'sh' syntax - e.g., any "Bash-isms" would cause errors. As is the
usual case with shell scripts, using a shebang which specifies the desired
shell, making the script executable, and running it simply by specifying
the name offers more precise control over the execution environment. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
A star in any position means 'every interval'; that is, a star in the
'minutes' slot would mean "execute this every minute".
</p>


<h3>Try It</h3>

<p>
Let's set up a cron task, just to see how easy it really is to do. The
command we run is crontab -e, which will bring up a vi editor session <a
href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> in which we set up our cron task.  Also,
you can space the numbers as far apart as you want, but I would recommend
getting in the habit of using just one single space because you may need
the extra space for the absolute path to whatever command you're running.
</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -e
</pre>

<p>
Now enter the following line:
</p>

<pre>
* * * * * /usr/bin/wall "Hello From Crontab"
</pre>

<p>
When you save it, you should see the following output:
</p>

<pre>
crontab: installing new crontab
[root@localhost ~]#
</pre> 

<p>
In a few moments, you will see a message:
</p>

<pre>
Broadcast message from root (Thu Apr  3 14:52:01 2008):

Hello From Crontab
</pre>

<p>
This message will continue every minute, because we put stars in every time
field; if we do not remove this crontab after we're satisfied, we will be
greeted every minute for the rest of our lives. This is also a good
demonstration of what crontab can do if you make a mistake! We will need
to execute "crontab -r" to remove the entry.
</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -r
</pre>

<p>
Now, say at a certain time in the future you need to start the Apache 'httpd' 
Web server. We could use a cron job to do this. First, we'll check to 
see that httpd is not running. Then, we'll do a "date" command to get the 
current time, so we can set the service to run in the future.
</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# service httpd status
httpd is stopped
[root@localhost ~]# 
[root@localhost ~]# date
Thu Apr  3 15:45:32 MST 2008
[root@localhost ~]#
</pre>

<p>
We can now easily figure out what 10 minutes from now will
be, execute crontab -e in the editor, and write a simple
crontab file, remembering the format.  </p> 

<pre>
# min(0-59)    hours(0-23)   day(1-31)   month(1-12)    dow(0-6)   command

   55	          15           *            *		*  	/sbin/service httpd start
</pre>

<p>
For now, just use stars for the day, month, and day of week, and only one 
space between elements; some distros complain if you have more spaces. 
So, enter something like this:
</p>

<pre>
55 15 * * * /sbin/service httpd start
</pre>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -e 
crontab: Installing new crontab
</pre>

<p>
If you made any mistakes, 'crontab' will tell you about it right as you
close the editor. Assuming that everything was right, though, we will have
the Apache Web server running less than ten minutes from now. You can use
"crontab -l" to list your jobs at any time, to see what is in your crontab
and when these jobs are set to run:
</p> 

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -l 
55 15 * * * /sbin/service httpd start
</pre>

<p>
Yours should look similar. What this means, though, is that 'httpd' is
still set to run every single day at the specified time. Again, we'll
remove it by executing "crontab -r" to delete all the entries in the file.
</p>

<pre>
[root@localhost ~]# crontab -r
</pre>

<p>
The combinations seem endless. There are also additional variations for
specifying time: "20-27" specifies a range; "3,4,7,8" mean just those
intervals for that selection; and */5 would be every 5th interval. Another
feature of cron is that, upon completion of a job, it will mail the command
output to the user who set up the cron job unless that feature is disabled.
</p>  

<h3>Some more samples</h3>

<p>
This crontab entry would run the command every 15 and 30 minutes after 
every hour, during the month of May:
</p>

<pre>
15,30 * *  5 * /usr/bin/command
</pre> 

<p>
To run a backup script on just Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays at 2:12 AM,
the entry would be:
</p> 

<pre>
12 2 * * 0-2 sh /root/backup.sh
</pre> 

<p>
To run a script at 12 minutes after every 3rd hour of every day, the entry 
would look like this:
</p> 

<pre>
12 */3 * * * sh /root/script.sh
</pre>

<p>
To get cron to write the output of the commands to a log, you can append 
something like this to the command entry:
</p>

<pre>
12 */3 * * * sh /root/script.sh &gt;&gt; /root/script.log 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<p>
To have cron suppress the e-mail:
</p>  

<pre>
12 */3 * * * sh /root/script.sh &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>

<p>
This is a sample of cron output that would end up in the mail
</p>

<pre>

Date: Thu, 3 Apr 2008 12:08:01 -0700

<h1>USB thumb drive RAID</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/weiner.html">January Weiner</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>I have a database that I'm working on, and sometimes I need to work
on it on my laptop. However, the database is really demanding, and it is just too
slow on my laptop's hard disk. I quickly found out that the limitation was the
speed of the hard drive, and not so much the CPU. What I needed was a fast
external hard drive. Anyway, I always wanted to play with a RAID system.</p>

<h3>Hard Disk Performance</h3>

<p>There are three parameters of drive speed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Read speed</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Write speed</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Access time</strong> - this is the time needed by the
drive to find the place it should read the information from (or write
to) <em>before</em> it starts reading or writing. For example, in your
average hard drive, the head has to move to the physical location on the
magnetic disk.</li> 
</ul>

<p>I do not need fast read/write speed, as the amount of information that
I retrieve from the database is tiny and the db is almost entirely
read-only. However, I do need fast access time: the database is huge, and I
need to retrieve information from different positions in the database very
quickly. That is, I need <em>very low access times</em>, acceptable reading
speed, and I do not care about writing.</p>


<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>It is well known that the so-called "solid-state disks" (SSD) have
very low access times. I could have tried to buy an SSD, but being a tinkerer,
I decided for another option. Thumb drives / flash drives / pen drives are
also a kind of SSDs, one could say - but they have lousy transfer
rates. In the end, I decided to create a software RAID using four 2GB USB
drives. I bought</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 USB drives, 2GB each</li>
  <li>1 USB hub</li>
</ul>


<h3>Setting up the Software RAID</h3>

<p>Prerequisites: you need the mdadm tool (in Debian, simply run
<tt>apt-get install mdadm</tt>).</p>

<p> Insert the drives into the hub, and attach the hub to the computer.
<em>Note: if GNOME or whatever mounts the disks automatically, unmount
them before continuing.</em> First, it is necessary to find out the
names of the devices that were attached:</p>

<pre>
dmesg | grep "Attached SCSI"
sd 56:0:0:0: [sde] Attached SCSI removable disk
sd 57:0:0:0: [sdf] Attached SCSI removable disk
sd 58:0:0:0: [sdg] Attached SCSI removable disk
sd 59:0:0:0: [sdh] Attached SCSI removable disk
</pre>

<p>OK, the devices are /dev/sde, /dev/sdf, /dev/sdg/, /dev/sdh. I want a
RAID-0; that is, no redundancy, and 4x2GB=8GB of space. Creating the RAID
is simple:</p>

<pre>mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sd{e,f,g,h}</pre>

<p>This way, we have a new block device that can be formatted. I use ext2,
since reliability / journaling plays no role:</p>

<pre>
mkfs.ext2 /dev/md0
tune2fs -c 0 -j 0 /dev/md0
mount /dev/md0 /mnt
</pre>

<p>The first command creates the filesystem ("formats" the device); the
second disables regular checks. Finally, the third command mounts the
RAID on the filesystem so we can write data to it and read from it.</p>

<h3>Stopping and Starting the Array</h3>

<h4>Stopping the Array</h4>

<p>Before you stop the array, run the following (and save the output somewhere):</p>

<pre>mdadm --detail /dev/md0</pre>

<p>To stop the array that is running, first unmount the directory (umount /mnt) and then stop the array:</p>

<p>mdadm --stop /dev/md0</p>

<p>Now, you can safely remove the disks and, for example, plug them into
another machine.</p>

<h4>Starting the Array, Again</h4>

<p>Before you can use your RAID again, you need to "assemble" it. This
is easy if you have not removed the disk and try the assembly on the
same machine. In that case, you can just type:</p>

<p>mdadm --verbose -A /dev/md0 /dev/sd{e,f,g,h}</p>

<p>However, what if the device letters have changed (e.g. not e-h, but
i,j.k,l)? Well, you could find out again what the letters are. But there
is a better solution. Remember I told you to save the output from
"mdadm --detail"? It contained a line like that:</p>

<pre>           UUID : d7ea744f:c3963d02:982f0012:7010779c</pre>

<p>Based on this UUID, we can easily "assemble the array" on just any
computer :</p>

<pre>mdadm --verbose -A /dev/md0 -u d7ea744f:c3963d02:982f0012:7010779c</pre>

<p>You can also enter this information in the config file /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</p>

<h3>Performance Tests</h3>

<table border='1'><tbody>
<tr><th>Test</th><th>Description</th><th>Results</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
<tr><td><b>hdparm</b></td><td>reading</td><td>52 MB/s</td><td>This is twice as good as my laptop, and worse than the 70MB/s of my SATA disk in my workstation</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>dd</b></td><td>writing</td><td>28 MB/s</td><td>Half of what my workstation disk can do</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>seeker</b></td><td>random access</td><td>0.8-1ms</td><td>This is 10-20 times better than an ordinary hard disk</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4>Notes for the Tests</h4>

<ul>

  <li>hdparm: this is a standard Linux utility (in Debian, install with <code>apt-get install hdparm</code>). The command line is as follows: 
  <pre>hdparm -t /dev/md0</pre>

  <li>dd: full command line: <pre>dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/test2.bin bs=1M count=1024 conv=fsync</pre></li>

  <li>seeker: I have taken this utility from <a href="http://www.linuxinsight.com/how_fast_is_your_disk.html">this</a>page on disk performance tests. It makes purely random seeks on the device, thus simulating the worst-case scenario when small chunks of data need to be read from all over the place. Command line: <pre>seeker /dev/md0</pre></li>

  <li>furthermore, I have tested the performance of the whole setup with my specific app. It was great! Not as good as the RAM disk that I use for a part of it, but still very, very fast.</li>

  <li>ever since I have set it up a few days ago, I've been using it constantly with a heavy read load and have noticed no problems or errors (like the ones reported <a href="http://www.bigbruin.com/reviews05/thumbraid_1">here</a>).</li>

  <li>Note that the connection speed will be limited by the maximum connection speed of the USB, since 480Mbps (USB 2.0) gives you roughly 60MB/s at most.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Alternatives and Outlook<br></h3>

<p>I have explained here how to create a RAID-0 from four USB thumb drives.
However, most of what I was explaining here applies also to other RAID
types and other disk drives. Even more so! You can combine just about
<em>any</em> devices into a RAID. Well, it only makes sense if the devices
have similar sizes, but (i) you can create a RAID out of RAIDs (e.g., join
two 2GB USB sticks into a RAID0 /dev/md0, then join /dev/md0 with a 4GB USB
stick to get a RAID0 of the size of 8GB...) and (ii) you can combine
devices of different sizes using LVM (the logical volume manager).</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>Apart from some mistakes I made because I did not know 'mdadm', there
were no problems. If you run into any, generally two things are of an
immense help:</p>

<ul>
  <li>reading the documentation :-) specifically "man mdadm" and the
links below, and</li>
  <li>studying the kernel messages. This is best done with <pre>tail -f
  /var/log/messages</pre></li>
</ul>

I'm just this guy, you know? I'm a CNU graduate with a degree in
 physics. Before starting xkcd, I worked on robots at NASA's Langley
 Research Center in Virginia. As of June 2007 I live in Massachusetts. In
 my spare time I climb things, open strange doors, and go to goth clubs
 dressed as a frat guy so I can stand around and look terribly
 uncomfortable. At frat parties I do the same thing, but the other way
 around.

Pardon the hedge latin. Thought TAGistas might be interested in this
news item:

Spammer Alan Ralsky Finally Indicted
</p>

<p>
[...]
The charges include: "conspiracy, fraud in connection with electronic
mail, computer fraud, mail fraud and wire fraud." That's because Ralsky
wasn't just spamming products for sale, he was using a botnet to run a
pump-and-dump scam on Chinese penny stocks. It's unclear why it took
over two years for the indictment to finally show up, but there are
likely to be quite a few folks in the anti-spam community who are
thrilled that something finally happened to Ralsky.
