CD Duplication Services: Spam?

Subject: A Fair price for CD duplication
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was wondering who you use to get your CD's duplicated and if you
are happy with the service they provide?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have a CD duplicator which makes 7 copies every 10 minutes. I'm
not sure what to charge for this service. My thought is very
simple, find out what everyone else is charging to duplicate CD's
and then offer better service at a lower price!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I get jewel cases and blank media from overseas. I buy in volume
so they cost me pennies each!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you for taking time out of your day to reply.
Britt

I think you're a bit too late to this game.  Anybody who
really needs CD's burned probably has a burner of their own
(suitable for about 4 copies per hour or less --- but enough
for most people's needs).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your materials costs may be inconsequential (pennies each)
but you obviously have other costs to consider.  (The fact
that you're asking me this question suggests that you
haven't studied business economics at all --- or that this
is a clever ploy to advertise your new service without being
labelled as a spammer).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><em>[ If so, it's less than likely to get you positive clicks.
For one thing, I clean off sigs, unless Jim specifically refers
to them, and I reduce the sender's name to the actual name rather
than any extra fluff, in an effort to keep the bylines short and friendly. 
On the plus side, at least the message itself was short.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
First there are your equipment costs.  You have to amortize
the cost of your duplication system over its expected
lifetime (so that you'd be able to replace it as needed if
you wanted to make this into a sustainable business).  You'd
also have to leave a bit of margin for maintenance, repairs
and replacement of the cost (in case the duplicator fails
<EM>during</EM> its expected lifetime).  Plus you want to add a
small margin over that to support purchase of additional
equipment for increased capacity.  You may not expect to
"grow like hotcakes" but it's silly not to plan for some
degree of expansion.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Next you have to consider postage and or parcel delivery
costs.  This will be a major factor in your proposed
business since you clearly don't intend to cater to an
exlusively local clientele.  The "pennies per copy" is
suddenly overwhelmed by the "dimes per copy" of shipping
cost (for low volumes) and/or dollars per order (for larger
volume requests).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then we ask what services you offer (over and above the
basic duplication/production of CDs and package in jewel
cases).  For example you might need to print labels for the
jewel cases and/or offer silk screening or labeling of the
CDs themselves.  Some, possibly most, of your customer might
prefer to have their CDs packaged in cardstock sleeves or
mailers rather than jewel boxes.  For multi-CD sets your
customers might need various other packaging options.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Professional graphics design of labels and the jackets,
sleeves, etc is more art than technology.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you really want to make a business of this I'd make the
custom CD duplication an adjunct to your own production.
You could do mail order <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> 
(or <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> or other Linux
distribution) CDs.  You'd be in competition with Cheapbytes
(<A HREF="http://www.cheapbytes.com/"
	>http://www.cheapbytes.com/</A>) of course.  However, you might be
able to open up new markets in places where Cheapbytes and
its competitors haven't yet reached.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I haven't seen Linux CDs advertised in the back of 
<a href="http://www.popsci.com/">Popular Science</a> and 
<a href="http://popularmechanics.com/">Popular Mechanics</a> 
magazines, yet.  There are far
less interesting items listed in their little "classified"
sections.  You could also advertise in various other niche
magazines.  If you're selling your single or dual CD package
for less than $10 you'll probably make a small margin and
get relatively few returns.  You probably will get a lot of
technical support calls --- regardless of how boldly you
assert that "support is not included" on your marketing and
packaging.  Responding to support requests can be time
consuming and therefore can become a significant cost of
your business.  (Yes, it can cost almost as much to NOT
provide service as it does to provide it).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course there are other niches you can reach.  For example
in my role as an instructor at Linuxcare I find that we
periodically need small production runs of custom CDs for
our labs.  Currently we have our own support people doing
these (graveyard shift mostly).  It's easy to keep that
extra machine "cooking" while working on phone calls, e-mail
and documentation.  We also need floppies cut in about the
same quantities.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I was teaching at Mission college last term I took some
extra copies of the free Red Hat 6.x CD and distributed to
my class to encourage them to work and play with the class
materials on their home systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I imagine that lots of instructors would like to cook up
small runs of CDs for their classes.  The free source and
free content movements make this feasible for some
materials.  Obviously there are major copyright concerns as
we branch into more mainstream materials.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(You should not ignore liability issues if you plan on
making a business of this.  If you copy a CD full of
commercial music or software for one of your customers it
won't matter whether you knew what was on there or not, and
it won't matter whether you prevail in court; the costs of
defending yourself may leave you destitute.  If you opt to
incorporate --- to limit your personal liability --- then
you've got to factor in the considerable costs of
incorporation into your business plan).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of the sad facts about life in the modern world is that
it's practically impossible to run a simple "mom &amp; pop" shop
or service without putting in plenty of effort into the
research, planning and paperwork. It's what I hated about
running my own consulting service.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><em>[ But I'm glad that he did all these things before he gave it
back to me.  When I began consulting years ago, I'd never bothered to
get even as much as a DBA.  If this business is the only income for you
and your family, you also need to make sure that your utility and other
regular bills have some regular way to get paid, even while you're
starting up.  It might even require some government funding or a business
loan, which are a lot more paperwork.</em></p>

<p><em>Also, in my case, I sell knowledge, and
my own time and experience to crystallize it into usable form for small
businesses.  The first already has its storage space, and the latter is
somewhat easier than many products to keep inventory of.  For yours, even
at minimal levels of success, you need some physical place to keep CDs
and shipping packages.  -- Heather ]</em></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, you might learn quite a bit by "doing it wrong"
with a sort of "hobby" business. You might find that you
have the knack for it and actually enjoy it as well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, good luck and have fun.
