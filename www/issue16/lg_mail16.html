Subject: <B> great </B> <BR>  <BR> 
From: Francisco Benavides, <A HREF="mailto:txmfrbg@txm.ericsson.se">
>txmfrbg@txm.ericsson.se </A>
<P> 
The work being done with the LG is great!  As for ideas, taking into 
account that most known applications are those which are for the PCs  
( DOS based or Windog based ) why not a section dedicated to those 
( like me ) that wish that soon we will get a Linuz that will be 
filesystem wise, a Linux wich will run DOS applications without having
to distinguish from those meant for Linux/Unix, and things like that.
<P>

Subject: <B> Request </B> <BR>
From: Bill R. Williams,  <A HREF="mailto:brw@etsu-tn.edu">brw@etsu-tn.edu</A>
<P> 
Actually, this is more a request than a "Letter to the Editor"; however, 
you may use it as/if you see fit.
<P> 
A fundamental element of security is the use of "shadow" passwords.  
Linux (and some commercial un*x!) systems do not necessarily include 
this feature by default.  (I have thus far always used Slackware and it 
does not install with the Shadow Password Suite (SPS) configured.)
<P> 
I consider SPS absolutely essential to any un*x (Linux) system which is 
accessable by users.  In other words:  No, I don't need it on my home 
Linux because that system is not connected to a network and I'm the only 
one using it.  While there are worse things than having to install the 
SPS it is a task that I really dread.  Makes me very nervous.
<P> 
So here's a question for those of you who have evaluated the various 
Linux distributions:  Do any of the distributions provide Linux with the 
SPS installed and all the appropriate utilities and other pre-built 
packages built against the SPS?  (Such as sudo and wu-ftpd.)
<P> 
A related question which is not immediately obvious:  Using a given 
distribution -- Red Hat or Debian or whatever -- are there any potential 
hazards in bringing in packages which may not be part of that 
distribution?  Since I have no experience with anything other than 
Slackware I do not know what is involved in the packaging software used 
by other vendors; however, I am aware that some vendors do have 
utilities which can track the levels of various components.  If I were 
to install some software package which might not be part of the 
"installed" distribution what is the probability that I will "step on" 
the original installation's package tracking?  As a trivial example:  
Suppose I want to install 'Doom' from my old Slackware CD-ROM onto my 
"Miranda v0.01" distribution of Linux.  Am I going to have a problem 
over this when I go to update my "Miranda" with a new release?  (Linus 
had a new "Miranda" in January!  See, it could happen.  ;-)
<P> 
And on an entirely different subject...
There has GOT to be, somewhere, a utility which can be used to CORRECTLY 
configure the monitor settings for XFree!  I have tried.  I really have.  
Every time I come across an item on this subject I read and study it, 
but no matter how hard I try I can't seem to get it through my thick 
head as to what's what.  The supplied servers can figure out the video 
cards with no problem, but then there's the stuff dealing with the 
monitor and refresh rates and Hz and KHz and bandwidth and dot clocks 
and... this is where I lose it completely.  Something with heuristic 
abilities which would allow me to just type in everything in my 
monitor's manual which the program would parse out into the significant 
lines for the XF86config file such than when I start X I have *no* modes 
which cause the output to skew off to the side and thereby causing me to 
worry that I've fried the tube.  (*sigh*)
<P>
I have the new X (v3.4?) with the graphic setup utility.  Better.  
But there are *still* modes which are frightening to see.  "...push down 
one place it just bubbles up somewhere else."
<P> 
Comments, articles, and/or suggestions on all the above from the fine 
folks at "Linux Journal" and the readers thereof will be much 
appreciated!
<P>

Subject: <B> X Windows Depth...Linear Addressing Problem. </B> <BR> 
From: Nicky Wilson, <A HREF="mailto:benson@znet.com">benson@znet.com</A> 
<P> 
After fiddling with the xf86config file in a concerted effort to
coax X into displaying 16 bit color, I was dismayed to learn that
with my current hardware (16 megs RAM and a Cirrus Logic GL-5426)
16 bit color is *impossible*...not because of any hardware 
incapability, but because of a certain limitation of X Windows 
itself...a problem with linear addressing.  Seems that to have
16 bit color under X, one must have linear addressing enabled, 
which only works if the system has *no more than 14 megs RAM*.
<P> 
(*blink*)
<P> 
So I'm just two megs from the 16 bit color I so took for granted
under Win95.  I can't even pull out two megs (downgrading my 
system to work under Linux?!) because of my one 16 meg memory chip.
<P> 
There has *got* to be a way.  I was hoping to work on my
graphics stuff under Linux, but 256 colors just doesn't cut it.
<P> 
Does anyone at Linux Gazette have a solution?  I heard something
about making a two meg "memory hole" (?), or a program that fools 
the system into thinking that there's less RAM than there actually 
is.  Any ideas?  (I wonder if the X development team are working
on this problem?)
<P> 
Thanks for any input. <BR> 
     Your Friendly Local Neighborhood Novice, <BR> 
Nicky

Subject: <B> Soundcard under Linux </B> <BR> 
From: L Hatch, <A HREF="mailto:tn00607@ibm.net">tn00607@ibm.net</A>
<P> 
After recompiling my kernel I managed to get my soundcard
working under Linux ... the only problem is that I have
to boot into dos first to set up the card ... the card
is softset through my autoexec bat ... its an ESS
Audiodrive .. any suggestions
<P> 
Another question as well ... I want to connect two machines
together using a modem dialup connection .. I want to be able
to dial from a standard comm prg under dos, win, win95, etc
and turn control of the terminal over to the person on the 
other end so that they can use a linux shell in their
comm prg ... managed to do it under dos by getting a mdm
connection and then doing a ctty com2: at the command prompt
to turn control over to them ... they would get a C:> and
be able to enter commands, and get the output in their comm
prg ... any suggestions of how to do it under linux
thanks

Subject: <B> Stupid question </B> <BR> 
From: Steve Arnold, <A HREF="mailto:sarnold@rain.org">sarnold@rain.org</A>
<P> 
Howdy:  I just searched your site looking for an answer, but failing 
that, I'll just ask directly:
<P> 
What the heck is the screen-blanker that runs under the console by 
default (ie, what is the name, where is it started, etc)?
<P> 
In the old RedHat 2.1 (kernel 1.2.13) it was disabled after X starts, but 
in the new Redhat 4.0 (kernel 2.0.28) it still kicks in under X, even 
when running xlock or something similar.
<P> 
What binary and what switch do I throw to disable the console 
screen-blanker under X?
<P> 
Thanks in advance, Steve Arnold

Subject: <B> Linux Question </B> <BR> 
From: Peter Pereira Stamford, <A HREF="mailto:stamford@bme.unc.edu">
stamford@bme.unc.edu</A> 
<P> 
Hi, I am a gazette reader and have a question that might be of interest to
others too.  It's a mixture of hardware + software problem.  Before I sent
this mail I did a quick overview of all the gazette's table of contents
and Linux How-To's.  I didn't find any help in these two places.  If this
is a common question and I missed it please forgive me. 

<P>With the spread of different systems, many can end up owning several
small monitors.  Instead of acquiring a new, bigger, more expensive, 
monitor one can use two monitors that can work as one big screen.  

<P>I am trying to install a second monitor to effectively get this 
bigger screen, since I have an extra monitor and card.  I'm not trying to
display the same image on both monitors.  It is my understanding that
MetroX (comes with my redhat version) permits me to have X divided into
multiple virtual screens (forgive the lack of the official technical
terms) and view two X virtual screens side by side on separate the
monitors (I'm sure others Xservers do the same).  Thus I can have
different applications opened in each virtual screen avoiding clutering. 
(I'm tring to be precise because I have tried to get info before and was
missunderstood). 

<P>My work place has an extra monitor and video card that I am 
willing to take advantage of.  But currently when I have both video cards
installed, I can't BOOT.  I have been told that this is because only one
of the video BIOS is accepted by ROM BIOS, requiring the second video
BIOS to be turned off. My cards don't have this option (I don't think).
Others told me that it is a setting on the mother board.  

<P>The software configuration of Metro-X for this seems easy and
intuitive, but how do I set up the hardware?  Maybe an explanation on
X86Free on this would be good, but my problem is setting up the hardware.

<P>Could you please help?   If I need a special card is there a recommended
one?
<P> 
Thanks for any help, Peter.

<P> 
Hi there, <BR> 
   It's true that the issue14.html was broken. But one can fix it using
the  Netscape editor (or save/print directly from the editor). That 
works for me. 
<P>  
   Thanks for your excellent work. <BR>

I've been using Linux for aprox. 2 years now and have been a subscriber
to "Linux Journal" for about a year of that.  I like what you have even
better.  I love the 2 cent section, has great tips and ideas.  If you
sold this as a magazine on the news stands or subscription I would be an
avid buyer.  As it is I've got this link at the top of my bookmarks. 
Keep up the great job.
