Some time ago I came across PDFTK, but I've never really had a use for it. it 
sounds as though it should do what you need, but a quick scan of the man page 
doesn't tell me whether it honours restrictions in the PDF.

However, as I'd mentioned in the editorial note, there are several
trivial ways to remove that "protection", and these have been available
for years - after which, pdftk will do literally anything you can think
of to the content. The "protection" is a rather silly toy, and I'm not
sure what use it was supposed to be (although the "copy" protection
isn't quite as silly as it sounds - I <em>think</em> it means "don't allow
selecting the text to be pasted elsewhere". In any case, both evince and
xpdf ignore it.)
