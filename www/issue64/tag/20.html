Hi all, I am Mike,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As far as I read your answers about ISP and Internet servers, I never found
an answer about the difference between an Internet server and an ISP. I mean,
what is the difference between an ISP and if I run my own Internet server
which allow dial-in?
</STRONG></P>

Traditionally, "Internet Service Provider" (ISP) has meant an
organization that provides an upstream access point to the Internet (via
dialup, DSL, T-1, etc).  This can be a professional ISP company or (in
large companies) an "internal ISP" run by their own IT staff.  And of
course, the big backbones are "ISPs to the ISPs".  One can informally
call personal server offering dialup connections to a few certain
people <EM>some</EM> kind of ISP.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
AOL and MSN used to be private networks with their own content, along
with CompuServe, Prodigy, etc.  They offered something very different
from "Internet access", which meant a connection to the Internet
and then you were on your own to find content.  But now AOL has combined
the two, stretching the definition of what an ISP is.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the same time, people used to get their webhosting and e-mail via
their own ISP, but now they are increasingly using organizations who do
not offer dialup access directly.  And now there are new services like
remote backup or "word processing via the web" (which, parenthetically,
are a serious application of the old "multiplayer game" concept).  Are
these organizations ISPs?  It's debatable.  If you take this definition
to its limit, anybody with a server offering any Internet service is an
ISP.  I don't think most people would want to go that far.

If you have an Internet connection, and you allow people to
dial-in (or otherwise access) the Internet through your connection
--- then you are providing Internet service.  If that is your primary
business then you are certainly an ISP.  Otherwise the point is
somewhat moot.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course every ISP has to connect with or through other ISPs.
The "Internet" is an "internetwork" of connected networks.  (I
know that's a tautology, but bear with me here).  The Internet
is an internetwork of networks which all speak TCP/IP and have
agreed on a set of common address delegations and naming services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus their can only be <EM>one</EM> delegation of the address
198.41.0.6 on the Internet.   Likewise the name www.internic.net
must be delegated to one authority (which can publish various
addresses, mail exchange and other types of records about that
name).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course it gets more complicated than that in many cases.
For example it used to be common to have gateways between the
Internet and various other online services and networks.  Once
upon a time AOL, CompuServe, Delphi, Fidonet and various other
networks were <EM>NOT</EM> "on the Internet" --- though e-mail and
some other services (file transfers) could be accessed through
gateways.  The distinction between a "gateway" and an "Internet
connection" basically boils down to the matter of addressing
and naming.  Those networks didn't have globally direct routable
IP addresses (DRIPs) and (thus) their internal nodes couldn't
have name/records in the DNS (domain naming services) system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course many corporations use their own internal IP addressing
(usually following RFC1918 which reserves 10.*.*.*,
172.{16..31}.*.*/12 and 192.168.*.* from use in the global
address space).  Systems on these networks use application
level proxies or NAT (Network Address Translation: specifically
IP masquerading) to access the Internet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Proxies are also known as "gateways."  I friend of mine likes
to say that "if your connecting to the 'net via NAT then your
'NAT' really on the 'net!"  We can think of NAT as a network
layer "transparent" proxying service.  (And there are some
protocols can don't work through NAT, or requiring kludges
to "mostly" work through it).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course some companies may offer you "Internet service" through
a set of NAT gateways and/or proxies.  I think that some of the
cable modem services, wireless and even some of the DSL services
are NAT'd these days.  Whether they are "really" ISPs is a moot
point.  If you can get the specific services you need through these
companies then they can be "service providers" for you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course, I prefer a traditional ISP (one that gives me a static
block of DRIP addresses, a route to my dedicated line, a dial-up line
for fail over and remote use, and control of my own DNS and even
control of my reverse DNS --- which is only a subnet of a class C
in my case).  I pay a much higher rate for these services than
most DSL, and cable modem customers though I get a relatively
paltry bandwidth for it --- only 1.44Kbps over IDSL.  I don't
complain because this gives me the flexibility to do anything
"on the Internet" as any ISP or corporation (only slower than
the big guys).  Besides, I pay less than a quarter of what a few
friends of mine used to pay for 56K frame relay leased lines only
five years ago.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, I would conclude with the following definitions (and let
the hair splitters pull out their loops and razors):
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An "internet server" is any host which is "on the Internet" and
providing services to clients over it.  Usually this means
"public services" (such as most web, FTP, DNS, etc that you've
ever heard of).  I would even say that a "server" could
actually be a small cluster of systems which are providing a
service as a group (usually behind some sort of load-balancing
NAT router) constitutes an "internet server."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
An ISP is a company or organization which provides internet
services (connection to the world wide Internet address space,
routing and naming system) to customers (as opposed to their
own staff, departments or satellite offices).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Note that I *don't* count companies, such which provide a
stack of dedicated remote access lines their employees and let
them access the Internet through their corporate connection as
"ISPs" in this sense.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A "tier 1" Internet connection is one which has an AS
(autonomous system) number, which is a sort of routing address
that is completely different then IP addresses, and uses that
for "peering" (exchanging routing data) with multiple other
tier 1 internetworks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A "tier 1" ISP would logically be a company which has a tier 1
Internet connection <EM>and</EM> which provides Internet connections
to customers.  (Note that some organizations which have first
tier Internet connections are not ISPs --- some large
educational, governmental, and military organizations, for
example).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the next tier down are ISPs and organizations that lack AS
numbers and which don't peer; but which do have CIDR blocks of
DRIP addresses.  (CIDR is "classless interdomain routing" ---
a way of aggregating blocks of numerically adjacent addresses
so that they entire block can be managed with a single entry
in the global routing tables.  Such organizations might
be "multi-homed" (given them some load-balancing, and
failover redundancy through their own policy based routing).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The lowest tier of ISPs aren't multi-homed (don't have
multiple independent Internet connections) and/or don't
have their own address block delegations.  They have to
get their addresses from their ISPs and they have no
redundancy (or they are completely dependent on their
single ISP, even if they do have multiple dedicated lines
to them).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course there are places where customers rent rackspace and connect
their computers to an Internet connection, and power. These are
colocation facilities. In some cases you're renting whole cages.
In most cases they are providing UPS (uninteruptible power supply and
generator power backups), physical security, 24 hour monitoring,
and other services (such as access to network tape drives for
your backups and terminal servers for remote console access to your
systems).  Colocation facilities allow you to bring your computer to the
Internet (rather than bringing the Internet all the way to your
computer).  They are an imminently logical approach when you need
high speed and low latency at moderate cost for your internet servers.
