<dt>Politely:
<dd>It's a real bother to get working under XFree86.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In fact, if you have this or a derivative card, don't even try. Go out
immediately and get Xfree86 4.0. This is not a matter of compatibility
it is a matter that it just doesn't work at all under anything but.
You need at least 3.3.6 to get even faltering support let alone anything 
that actually works.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><em>Seeing as 3.3.6 is still the current version, it's probably still
	the case.  Feel free to build it yourself from the source repository
	if you feel up to it, but, then you may as well try the new version
	instead and get real support. -- Heather</em></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So what is it?---A very popular chipset on the low-end $30-50 SVGA
card market. I've got one in komodo for preciselyt that reason.
When I first put the machine together, I just needed a card that would
allow me to stand the box until I could put it on a TTY and decide what I
wanted to do for a real card/monitor combo. As such I never tried to
bring X up on it. They are in a number of the testbed boxen at [my work]
for similar reasons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I kept running into the same problem. I could run '<tt>startx</tt>' by hand, but
whenever I ran <TT>/etc/init.d/xdm</TT> start, '<tt>parse_xf86config</tt>' would complain
that there was an error in the XF86Config in <TT>/etc/X11</TT> and refuse to start
xdm. First, I noticed that the variable PROBLEM in <TT>/etc/init.d/xdm</TT> is
automatically set to "yes" with the intent that if the <tt>parse_xf86config</tt>
went well, PROBLEM would get set to null and all would be well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It turns out this never happens and even when the output of
<tt>parse_xf86config</tt> is clean, PROBLEM doesn't get reset.
I was having other problems too. The screen interlaced horribly and
occasionally blanked out and then came back. The cursor was a big huge
blob. I was really just about to toss the card across the room.
A final search on RedHat under "all Linux sites" turned up the answer.
If you add the following under XF86Config, it works.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>Option no_bitblt
Option no_imageblt
Option no_accel
Option sw_cursor
</pre></blockquote>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This also fixed the issue I was having with PROBLEM in <TT>/etc/init.d/xdm</TT>
which is the REALLY bizarre part. From all appearances, it looks like
<tt>parse_xf86config</tt> is not only doing a syntactical check on the 
config file
but that it is also checking to see if the options that you are specifying
actually WORK on the card or if it's going to cause trouble.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have the exact same <TT>/etc/init.d/xdm</TT> script on chameleon, which 
is also
running debian and it runs without a hitch(it is however, using the vastly
more ubiquitous C&amp;T 65550 chipset)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>Moral of the story:
<dd>Avoid cheapy video cards and when you can't or REALLY don't want to,
avoid the SiS 6326. Dropping an extra $50 is far more worth your time.
</dl></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Also, startup scripts aren't infallible. I'm still wondering if there are
maybe some bugs in the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> 
<TT>/bin/sh</TT> that was causing the evaluation
problems with <TT>/etc/init.d/xdm</TT> I was seeing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><em>
Note: Probably resolved if you stay on <strong>Potato</strong>;  
he was looking at Debian/frozen in mid July, and it didn't release until 
mid August. -- Heather
