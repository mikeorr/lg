<h1>Experiments with an iPod</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/nirendra.html">Awasthi Nirendra</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>What is this iPod?</h3>

<p>An <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/">iPod</a> is a brand of
portable digital audio player designed by Apple Computer. The first
three generations of iPod use two ARM 7TDMI-derived CPUs running at
90 MHz, while later models have variable speed chips with a peak
speed of 80 MHz to save battery life.</p>

<p>This article is intended for those who want to either use their
iPod with Linux, or use Linux on their iPod.</p>

<h3>Connecting and Locating your iPod</h3>

<p>The first step is to connect the iPod to your USB port, then
determine what Linux device the iPod is connected as:</p>

<pre>
# cat /proc/scsi/scsi
Attached devices:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
Vendor: Apple Model: iPod Rev: 1.50
Type: Direct-Access ANSI SCSI revision: 02
</pre>
<code>scsi0</code> means that iPod is connected to
<code>/dev/sda</code>, <code>scsi1</code> means that iPod is
connected to <code>/dev/sdb</code>, and so on. In this article,
I'll use <code>/dev/sda</code> as the default assumption;
obviously, you'll need to change it if your iPod uses a different
device.

<h3>Mounting and Unmounting Your iPod</h3>

<p>Now we can explore the iPod. For this, we need to mount it:</p>

<pre>
# mkdir /mnt/myIpodSongs
# mount -t vfat /dev/sda2 /mnt/myIpodSongs
</pre>
After mounting, the contents of the iPod can be browsed as a normal
file system.

<p>When we are done exploring, we need to unmount the iPod:</p>

<pre>
# umount /dev/sda2
</pre>

<h3>Copying and playing music</h3>

<p>Ok, this was neat, but what about playing some music? On Linux,
<code>gtkpod</code> can be used to copy and organize your music
into playlists. After installing <a href=
"http://www.gtkpod.org/">gtkpod</a>, the mount point of the iPod
can be specified from "Edit-&gt;Edit Preferences". Once the mount
point is added, <code>gtkpod</code> lets you create and modify
playlists, add or remove songs, and even export your Thunderbird or
Evolution data to the iPod.</p>

<h3>Podcasts</h3>

<p>Podcasts are radio-style shows for the iPod. Unlike streaming
audio, which requires you to listen in real time, podcasting lets
you control how and when you hear your favorite shows. Some of the
podcasting clients available on Linux are <a href=
"http://amarok.kde.org/">amaroK</a> and <a href=
"http://linc.homeunix.org:8080/scripts/bashpodder/">BashPodder</a>,
a command line utility to download podcasts.</p>

<h3>Installing Linux on the iPod</h3>

<p>Now that we know how to use iPod on Linux, it's time to use
Linux on an iPod. Why bother to install Linux on an iPod? Because
it includes loads of new games, a movie player, a voice recorder,
and the freedom to create new applications. For those who are brave
enough to explore this exciting option, <a href=
"http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page">iPodLinux</a> has a distribution
you can use; the first, second, and third generations of iPod are
officially supported.</p>

<p>After playing with the installer for a bit, I was able to
install iPodLinux on my 60GB Photo iPod. The port uses uClinux, a
Linux flavor designed for devices that lack a memory management
unit (MMU). While the iPod has some MMU-type capabilities, they are
not sufficient to support the Linux kernel.</p>

<p>Before installing Linux, it's a good idea to make a backup of
the iPod boot loader and OS, so they can be restored if something
goes wrong:</p>

<pre>
# dd if=/dev/sda of=ipod_boot_sector_backup count=1
# dd if=/dev/sda1 of=ipod_os_partition_backup
</pre>
After the backup is done, the next step is to create a new
partition on the iPod to hold the root file system for Linux.

<p>A partition can be created by using the following command:</p>

<pre>
# fdisk /dev/sda
</pre>
I created the following partitions on my 60GB iPod:

<pre>
Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System
/dev/sda1 * 1 1 8001 0 Empty
/dev/sda2 * 6 7296 58564957+ b W95 FAT32
/dev/sda3 2 5 32130 83 Linux
</pre>

<p>Once the partitioning is done, create a filesystem with an ext3
journal:</p>

<pre>
# mke2fs -j /dev/sda3
</pre>
and set the maximal mount count between two filesystem checks to
zero to prevent <code>fsck</code> being run on it:

<pre>
# tune2fs -c 0 /dev/sda3
</pre>

<p>To install the Linux kernel and the boot loader, download either
the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73079&amp;package_id=101451&amp;release_id=226112">
Official Boot loader</a> (for the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>,
and 3<sup>rd</sup> generation iPod) or the 4<sup>th</sup>
generation <a href=
"http://www.fivefiftyone.com/newsite/ipodbootloadercvs.tar.gz">photo
iPod</a> version. Also, download the <a href=
"http://www.ipodlinux.org/builds/">latest kernel</a> from the
nightly build. Extract the kernel and boot loader into a directory
of their own. Next, extract the Apple image from the boot loader
and create a new image including Linux and Apple OS (here, the
kernel is named uclinux-2.4.24-ipod2.bin):</p>

<pre>
# ./make_fw -3 -o apple_os.bin -e 0 ipod_os_partition_backup
# ./make_fw -3 -o my_sw.bin -i apple_os.bin -l uclinux-2.4.24-ipod2.bin loader.bin
</pre>
NOTE: -3 is required in make_fw only for 4<sup>th</sup> generation
iPods.

<p>Once this is done, we can copy the new image and kernel modules
to the iPod:</p>

<pre>
# dd if=my_sw.bin of=/dev/sda1
# mkdir /mnt/ipod
# mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 /mnt/ipod
# cp -r lib /mnt/ipod
# umount /mnt/ipod
</pre>

<p>For userland installation, I downloaded the 
<!-- 20051030 dsrich - Link broken, site times out --><a href=
"http://168.234.106.10/linuxos-2005-08-28-+extras.tar.bz2">iPodLinux
FS</a> and performed the following steps to install the
filesystem:</p>
Mount the iPod root partition:

<pre>
# mount -t ext3 /dev/sda3 /mnt/ipod
</pre>
Extract the filesystem:

<pre>
# mkdir /mnt/linuxos
# mount -o loop floydzilla-2005-08-28-ipod+iboy+doom.img /mnt/linuxos
# cp /mnt/linuxos /mnt/ipod
</pre>
and finally, unmount the iPod partition:

<pre>
# umount /mnt/ipod
# umount /mnt/linuxos
# eject /dev/sda
</pre>
And we are done! But before you start playing Doom on iPod, it
needs to be rebooted.

<p>To reboot, disconnect your iPod from the USB port. If the iPod
did not automatically reboot, hold down the menu and the play
buttons for 3 seconds to reboot it. After rebooting, keep the back
button pressed to boot Linux, otherwise the default interface will
load.</p>

<h3>Programming your iPod</h3>

<p>The first thing required to compile "hello world" on an iPod
would, of course, be a new compiler. But why a <em>new</em>
compiler? because iPod has ARM processors and a cross-compiler is
required to compile programs for this architecture. Download the
compiler for uclinux from <a href=
"http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/arm-elf-tools/">http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/arm-elf-tools/</a>.</p>

<p>After the cross compiler is installed, the next thing to do
would be to write a 'hello iPod' program (save the following code
as <a href="misc/nirendra/hello.c.txt">hello.c</a>):</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main(void){ puts("Hello, iPod!"); return(0); }
</pre>

<p>Once done, compile the program:</p>

<pre>
# arm-elf-gcc -o hello hello.c -elf2flt
</pre>
copy the program to the iPod:

<pre>
# mount -t vfat /dev/sda2 /mnt/myIpodSongs
# mkdir /mnt/myIpodSongs/myprogs
# cp hello /mnt/myIpodSongs/myprogs
</pre>
and reboot the iPod after unmounting the partition:

<pre>
# cd $HOME
# eject /dev/sda
</pre>
After booting into floydzilla, goto "File browser-&gt;/mnt/myprogs"
and click on the "hello" to see output of the program on iPod.
