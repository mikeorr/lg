<h1>Logging to a Database with Rsyslog</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/peterson.html">Ron Peterson</a></b></p>

<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/">RSyslog</a> extends and improves on
the venerable syslogd service.  It supports the standard configuration
syntax of its predecessor, but offers a number of more advanced
features.  For example, you can construct advanced filtering expressions
in addition to the simple and limiting facility.priority selectors.  In
addition to the usual log targets, you can also write to a number of
different databases.  In this article, I'm going to show you how to
combine these features to capture specific information to a database.
In addition, I'll show you how to use trigger functions to parse the log
messages into a more structured format.
</p>

<h3 id="prereq">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
Obviously you'll need to have rsyslog installed.  My examples will be
constructed using the packaged version of rsyslog available in the
current Debian Stable (Lenny).  You'll also need the plugin module
for writing to PostgreSQL.
</p>

<pre class="code">
1122# dpkg -l "*rsyslog*" | grep ^i
ii  rsyslog        3.18.6-4  enhanced multi-threaded syslogd
ii  rsyslog-pgsql  3.18.6-4  PostgreSQL output plugin for rsyslog
</pre>

<p>
I'll be using PostgreSQL version 8.4.2, built with plperl support.  I'm
using plperl to write my trigger functions, to take advantage of Perl's
string handling.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to go into any detail about how to get these tools
installed and running, as there are any number of good resources (see
below) already available to help with that.
</p>

<h3 id="rsyslog">RSyslog Configuration</h3>

<p>
My distribution puts the RSyslog configuration files in two places.
It all starts with /etc/rsyslog.conf.  Near the top of this file, there
is a line like this, which pulls additional config files out of the
rsyslog.d directory:
</p>

<pre class="code">
$IncludeConfig /etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
</pre>

<p>
I'm going to put my custom RSyslog configuration in a file called
/etc/rsyslog.d/lg.conf.  We're going to use this file to do several
things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Load the database driver module</li>
  <li>Configure RSyslog to buffer database output</li>
  <li>Define a template for mapping syslog output to the database</li>
  <li>Define filter expressions to net just the log messages we care about</li>
</ul>

<p>
Let's start with something easy - loading the database module.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$ModLoad ompgsql.so
</pre>

<p>
That wasn't too bad now, was it?  :)
</p>

<p>
So let's move on.  The next thing we'll do is configure RSyslog to
buffer the output headed for the database.  There's
a <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc-rsyslog_high_database_rate.html">good
section</a> about why and how to do this in the RSyslog documentation.
The spooling mechanism we're configuring here allows RSyslog to queue
database writes during peak activity.  I'm also including a commented
line that shows you something you should <i>not</i> do.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$WorkDirectory /var/tmp/rsyslog/work

# This would queue _ALL_ rsyslog messages, i.e. slow them down to rate of DB ingest.
# Don't do that...
# $MainMsgQueueFileName mainq  # set file name, also enables disk mode

# We only want to queue for database writes.
$ActionQueueType LinkedList # use asynchronous processing
$ActionQueueFileName dbq    # set file name, also enables disk mode
$ActionResumeRetryCount -1   # infinite retries on insert failure
</pre>

<p>
Now we're going to define an RSyslog template that we'll refer to in
just a minute when we write our filter expression.  This template
describes how we're going to stuff log data into a database table.  The
%percent% quoted strings are RSyslog 'properties'.  A list of the
properties you might use can be found in
the <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc-property_replacer.html">fine
documentation</a>.  You'll see why I call this 'unparsed' in just a
moment.
</p>

<pre class="code">
$template mhcUnparsedSSH, \
          "INSERT INTO unparsed_ssh \
          ( timegenerated, \
            hostname, \
            tag, \
            message ) \
          VALUES \
          ( '%timegenerated:::date-rfc3339%', \
            '%hostname%', \
            '%syslogtag%', \
            '%msg%' );", \
          stdsql
</pre>

<p>
All that's left to do on the RSyslog side of things is to find some
interesting data to log.  I'm going to log SSH login sessions.
</p>

<pre class="code">
if $syslogtag contains 'sshd' and $hostname == 'ahost' then :ompgsql:localhost,rsyslog,rsyslog,topsecret;mhcUnparsedSSH
</pre>

<p>
This all needs to be on one line.  It probably helps at this juncture
to look at some actual log data as it might appear in a typical log file.
</p>

<pre class="code">
Feb  2 10:51:24 ahost imapd[16376]: Logout user=ausername host=someplace.my.domain [10.1.56.8]
Feb  2 10:51:24 ahost sshd[17093]: Failed password for busername from 10.1.34.3 port 43576 ssh2
Feb  2 10:51:27 ahost imapds[17213]: Login user=cusername host=anotherplace.outside.domain [256.23.1.34]
Feb  2 10:51:27 ahost imapds[17146]: Killed (lost mailbox lock) user=dusername host=another.outside.domain [256.234.34.1]
Feb  2 10:51:27 ahost sshd[17093]: Accepted password for busername from 10.1.34.3 port 43576 ssh2
</pre>

<p>
This is real log data, modified to protect the innocent, from
/var/log/auth.log on one of my servers.  In a standard syslog setup,
this data would be captured with a configuration entry for the 'auth'
facility.  As you can see, it contains authorization information for
both IMAP and SSH sessions.  For my current purposes, I only care about
SSH sessions.  In a standard syslog setup, teasing this information
apart can be a real pain, because you only have so many facility.
selectors to work with.  With RSyslog, you can
write <a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc-rsyslog_conf_filter.html">advanced
filtering expressions</a> to help you capture just what you want.
</p>

<p>
In my case, I want to grab all log entries where the syslog tag
contains 'sshd' which originate from host 'ahost'.  The 'then' portion
of my expression says what to do with the data, namely, to use the
ompgsql driver and the mhcUnparsedSSH template to stuff it into the
'rsyslog' database found at 'localhost' as user 'rsyslog', password
'topsecret'.
</p>

<p>
The interesting information about these connections exists in the
message section, i.e. - the part specified by %msg% in my template.
This corresponds to all of the text after the syslog tag's colon:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Failed password for busername from 10.1.34.3 port 43576 ssh2
Accepted password for busername from 10.1.34.3 port 43576 ssh2
</pre>

<p>
We have our data in a database at this point.  We could just stop
where we are.  I want to take this a little farther, though.  I want to
break the message text down into the parts and pieces I care about, and
put it into a more structured table.  So let's turn to the database side
of things to see what we can do.
</p>

<h3 id="postgres">All Hail PostgreSQL</h3>

<p>
I'm going to create a database with two tables.  The first table
corresponds to the table we're referring to with our RSyslog template.
The second table will be a little more structured.  We will then write a
trigger function for the first table.  When a new row is added to our
first table, this trigger function will parse the data, tease it apart,
and put the constituent pieces into our second table.  Our tables will
look like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
CREATE TABLE unparsed_ssh (
  timegenerated
    TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  hostname
    VARCHAR(12),
  tag
    TEXT,
  message
    TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE authlog (
  timegenerated
    TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  application_host
    VARCHAR(12),
  tag
    VARCHAR(24),
  application
    VARCHAR(24),
  origin_ip
    INET,
  username
    VARCHAR(24),
  oper
    VARCHAR(6)
    CHECK( oper IN ('login', 'logout') ),
  success
    BOOL
);
</pre>

<p>
You might imagine other fields that would be interesting to have in
the authlog table, but that starts to get off point.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to lay the trigger function on you all at once.  I'm using
plperl, because as I previously mentioned, perl makes short work of
string manipulation.  There is plenty of information about plperl in
the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/plperl.html">PostgreSQL
docs</a>. A few words to help you get your bearings.  The $_TD-&gt;{new}
variables refer to the trigger data made available to the function when
it is called.  You can see that these variables refer to the columns of
the table that RSyslog is stuffing data into.  The rest of the function
simply pulls the message text apart, and then constructs an INSERT sql
statement which pushes our parsed data into our second table.
</p>

<pre class="code">
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION
  parse_ssh_log()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS
$$
  my $timegenerated = $_TD-&gt;{new}{timegenerated};
  my $hostname = $_TD-&gt;{new}{hostname};
  my $tag = $_TD-&gt;{new}{tag};
  my $message = $_TD-&gt;{new}{message};

  my $query;
  my $rv;
  my $user;
  my $ip;
  my $method;

  if( $message =~ /.*?(Failed|Accepted).*?for (.*?) from (.*?) .*/ ) {
    $success = $1;
    $user = $2;
    $ip = $3;
    if( $success eq "Failed" ) {
      $success = "false";
    } else {
      $success = "true";
    }
    $query = &lt;&lt;EOSQL;
INSERT INTO authlog ( timegenerated,
                      application_host,
                      tag,
                      application,
                      origin_ip,
                      username,
                      oper,
                      success )
VALUES ( '$timegenerated',
         '$hostname',
         '$tag',
         'ssh',
         '$ip',
         '$user',
         'login',
         '$success' );
EOSQL
    $rv = spi_exec_query( $query );
    return "SKIP";
  }
  return;
$$ LANGUAGE 'plperl';

CREATE TRIGGER parse_ssh_trigger
BEFORE INSERT ON unparsed_ssh
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE parse_ssh_log();
</pre>

<p>
Note that I have two different types of 'return' statement.  The
'return "SKIP"' tells the trigger to throw away the original row.  In
other words, our ssh log entries never actually land in the first table
at all.  That table essentially only exists as a placeholder for our
trigger function.  The final return is only called if our regular
expression fails to match.  Since it does not SKIP the insertion, any
row our function doesn't match will end up in our first table.  This is
a good way to check that you are capturing what you think you are.
</p>

<hr><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Why do this?  Here's a real world example.  In my work, it's good to
be alerted about things like multiple login failures.  If the same
username is failing to log in from multiple different IP addresses, for
example, that usually indicates someone is attempting to break into
their account.  If someone is successfully logging in from multiple
widely separated IP addresses, is often means they have already been
broken into.  Unfortunately, we have multiple authentication systems,
which makes it difficult to watch all of this activity.  Using RSyslog,
I'm pulling log data from multiple different systems - ssh, imap, ldap,
etc. - into a single structured database.  This enhances our forensic
capabilities.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it's easy enough to simply push a bunch of syslog data to a
central server to consolidate the information in a central location.
That's what I'm doing here also, but rather than simply writing the log
data to a file, I'm using a database.  Often, 'grep' and friends are all
you need.  But a database lets you easily do more sophisticated queries.
How would you grep a specific time interval, for example?  Here's an simple
example query, written as a shell script:
</p>

<pre>
#! /bin/bash
export PGPASSWORD='topsecret';

psql -U rsyslog -d rsyslog -h localhost &lt;&lt;EOF
SELECT timegenerated, username, origin_ip, application_host,
application
FROM authlog
WHERE username = '$1' AND
      timegenerated &lt;= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - '24 hours'::INTERVAL
ORDER BY timegenerated DESC;
EOF
</pre>

<p>
This is really the whole point of this exercise: being able to use
simple SQL statements to make it easier to do more advanced reporting.
</p>

<p>
I hope you found this article helpful.  Happy hacking.
