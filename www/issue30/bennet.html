           Here are 8 reasons to switch to Linux, the free OS:
<ol>
<li>    It is free. Download from the Internet and install it now.
<li>    Free upgrades. Find the Kernel on the Internet and download the
        latest guts for the system.
<li>    It runs Win3x,95,98,etc. Some programs, not all. Your programs will 
        run and look the same as in Windows. Find the Wine project. It is 
        trying to be 100% free of Microsoft code, in order to further promote 
        freedom of action on the PC. They use the API of Windows, and write 
        the code for free! When a Windows program won't run in WINE or WABI
        the Linux system can be installed AFTER you install Windows. Then the
        LILO bootloader can boot either Linux or Windows, without any upset 
        at all of your delicate and unstable Windows setup. A dual-boot PC is
        able to run almost everything and it tastes great, but is not less 
        filling. Create with the GIMP, post it to the net, save it in DOS and 
        use it in your office suite.
<li>    It runs DOS. Some programs, not all. See dual-boot, above. Your 
        programs will run using the Dosemu. It makes the programs see a DOS 
        system on your machine, and they go. Yes, even Warlords II will run 
        just fine. You just need a paid-for DOS version to install and a hard 
        disk partition is recommended.
<li>    It runs Unix. Your Linux is a PC version of the powerful Unix OS.
        The universities, NASA, the research institutes, computer scientists
        and software developers are using it since the old days of computing.
        You now have access on the Internet to thousands of programs. They
        range from obscure utilities to fully developed productivity systems.
        Oh, by the way, they are free to download and are written by the best
        minds in the computer world. "Microserfs"(recruited by the monopoly),
        are best left in their circular, singular limited world so that the
        real free thinkers can write you great innovative, unlimited programs
        that can solve real world problems.
<li>    It runs Macintosh. Yes, you just get the emulator and your Mac
        programs will see a Mac system on your PC. Playmaker Football, anyone?
<li>    It is fast when used as a network server or for multi-tasking. The
        ISP (Internet Service Provider) community is becoming a large growth
        area for Linux, with over 20% of them using it. That percentage is
        growing as the mainstream shrinks. The choice of Linux as your office
        productivity system is really a no-brainer: Speed, Versatility, Price
        (free), Upkeep (free), Support (free on the Internet) and Adaptation.
        Your upgrades are free and you keep up with all the innovations in the
        realm of computing by virtue of your ability to run all the different
        operating systems and their software on one machine. Any questions?
<li>    You contribute to the expression of freedom of thought and action
        when you choose Linux, the free OS. By way of contrast, just ask
        yourself 'How many times have I paid for an upgrade of my system?'. If
        the answer is one or more, then you paid too much. Again, ask yourself
        'Did I need to upgrade when the owners of the OS told me to upgrade?'.
        If your software was running just fine when you were told to upgrade,
        then who is running your life?
</ol>
<P>
             Finally, ask yourself 'Does following the dictates of the
        Windows-Intel monopoly make me an independent PC owner?'. If you can't
        run a piece of software that sounds like it does what you want done,
        because it is not available for your "operating system", then why do
        you continue to let yourself be limited by the owners of the monopoly
        "operating system"?
<P>
             Switching to Linux lets you run the software that you hear
        about and lets you choose which programs you want; which programs you
        need; and most important, when to buy them.
<P>
            Staying on Microsoft's schedule, for example, will have seen
        you purchase four upgrades to your "operating system" in the last ten
        years. DOS 6.22, Windows3x, Windows95 (DOS 7.0) and Windows98 have an
        inevitable progression built into their "release" so that you give
        your money to the richest man on the planet on a regular basis. That
        regular flow of cash is keeping Microsoft solvent, paying the
        investors and limiting choices for the 90% of PC users who are trapped
        in the Microsoft endless loop of upgrades.
<P>
                Why am I so adamant in my condemnation of the monopoly? The
        reason is that in May of 1998, Microsoft "released" Windows98. That
        caused a huge buying surge for Microsoft, because their captive users
        were truly afraid of being left out of the "innovation" loop. At the
        same time, a press release on the TV claimed that Windows98 had fixed
        three thousand (3,000) bugs in the Windows95 "operating system". Only
        a true monopoly would even let you know that you had been inflicted
        with three thousand (3,000) bugs in your last software purchase. To
        top off the irony, the United States government and 20 of their states
        were taking Microsoft to court on anti-trust suits over their
        exclusion of choices for consumers on which browser to use on the
        Internet.
<P>
                That left me with the logical question of whether you PC users
        had a choice of how to run your PC and get only the programs that
        you want or need. The answer is that the lawsuits are illogical, since
        you the consumer can run Linux, use just the Microsoft programs you
        want and run any browser you want and run any system you want, all on
        one PC. Therefore, Microsoft can wedge their captives into any type of
        mess that they wish, simply because you can choose to run Linux and
        still be connected to the masses by virtue of your versatility.
<P>
                Your business can run the same software as your contacts and
        share the same type of files and be totally connected, even with the
        extra 10% of the market that is not on Windows-Intel. You win and
        you win with Linux.
