<h4>How to build a mail to pager gateway</h4>

<p><strong>From  John DiSpirito on Sat, 18 Apr 1998 </strong></p>

<p><strong>Hello Answerguy, 

<br><br>
I was wondering if you could help me with something?

I was looking for a package that sits on my linux machine
and will do email alpha-paging. 

Im sure you know what this is, but just in case:

<br><br>
A person emails an account:  <em>johndoe_page@somemail.com</em>, and
it pages them... 

<br><br>
I know they are out there, but I dont know where they are.
Could you lend some assistance?

<br><br>Thanks.
</strong></p>

<br><br>
	There are several ways to do this, as you suspected.

<br><br>
	First you could just use the TAP (telephony acces protocol)
	script that was published in Frank de la Cruz' book on 
	<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/">C-Kermit</a>.  
	(The paging can be done as a kermit script and the mail gateway 
	would be a quick 
	<a href="http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/~reriksso/procmail/mini-faq.html"i
		><tt>procmail</tt></a> script to call it).

<br><br>
	That approach requires a little bit of coding but uses
	tools you hopefully already have around.  You can get
	out of the kermit coding/typing by looking at:

<br><blockquote>
		<A HREF="http://fohnix.metronet.com/~tye/textpage.html"
	>http://fohnix.metronet.com/~tye/textpage.html</A>

</blockquote><br>
	For more specialized tools to do this, I just went to the 
	Linux Software Map search engine at: 
	<A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/lsm/">http://www.boutell.com/lsm/</A>
	... selected the search by "keyword" options and typed in "pager"

<br><br>
	I expected this to hit dozens of entries for '<tt>more</tt>' 
	'<tt>less</tt>' '<tt>most</tt>' and other Unix "pagers" (that is, 
	programs for "paging" through a file).  However, only Xless showed 
	up under that false hit category.

<br><br>
	The first "real" hit was a program by a Joshua Koplik.  The
	LSM entry for it has some typos (or is just out-of-date from
	some directory restructuring at sunsite) so I had to chase
	down the real URL with a few judicious clicks:

<br><blockquote>
	<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/mail/mailhandlers/!INDEX.html"
	>http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/mail/mailhandlers/!INDEX.html</A>


</blockquote><br>
	... gets you to the right directory.

<br><br>
	The other few links returned on this search were for '<tt>man</tt>' 
	pagers.

<br><br>
	Now I'm also sure I recently saw another news article somewhere 
	about telecom/paging software for Linux so I decided to hunt 
	further.

<br><br>
	So, I hit my old standby, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> 
	(most of the answers I give are researched through Yahoo!).  I used 
	the string: 

<br><blockquote>
		"<tt>+Linux +pager +alpha</tt>"

</blockquote><br>
	... and rapidly found a mini-HOWTO on this very topic at:

<br><blockquote>
	<A HREF="http://ir.parks.lv/li/Resources/HOWTO/mini/Pager"
	>http://ir.parks.lv/li/Resources/HOWTO/mini/Pager</A>

</blockquote><br>
	... by Chris Snell. 

<br><br>
	Despite, Chris' "disclaimer" (first line of the HOWTO reads
	"This document sucks.") the directions are very clear and seem
	to be very complete.  I gather that it used to be listed on 
	the LDP mini-HOWTO's and I'd like to see it re-appear there.
	(There are old, out-of-date mirrors of the LDP pages that
	have it and the current ones at:

<br><blockquote>
	 <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/</A> 
</blockquote><br>
	... and at:
<br><blockquote>
	 <A HREF="http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/"
	>http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/</A> 

</blockquote><br>
	don't show it.

<br><br>
	In this mini-HOWTO Chris refers to a package called "<tt>sendpage</tt>"
	(with URL's).  

<br><br>
	If you get this, I'd suggest that there are easier ways to 
	configuring '<tt>sendmail</tt>'  You really don't need to do any of 
	that (writing custom rulesets) with a modern sendmail.  
	Something similar can be done via m4 configuration macros 
	and built-in features (or easily handled with a simple one
	line procmail script).

<br><br>
	Another great set of links is on Celeste Stokely's
	widely acclaimed "Serial Ports Resources" for Unix:

<br><blockquote>
	<A HREF="http://www.stokely.com/unix.serial.port.resources/fax.pager.html#pager.unix.link"
>http://www.stokely.com/unix.serial.port.resources/fax.pager.html#pager.unix.link</A>


</blockquote><br>
	(which suggests that HylaFax supports pagers in some way!)

<br><br>
	It turns out that there is apparently a mailing list devoted
	to this topic at 
	<A HREF="mailto:ixo-request@plts.org">ixo-request@plts.org</A>.  
	(IXO is one of the
	other protocols that modems use to talk to alpha pagers --
	I don't know the details).

<br><br>
	In retrospect I think the recent posting I saw on the 
	subject may have been at the "Linux Weekly News" site
	(<A HREF="http://www.eklektix.com/lwn">http://www.eklektix.com/lwn</A>/).  Hitting their search
	engine revealed links to:

<br><blockquote>
		QuickPage (<a href="ftp://ftp.it.mit.edu/pub/QuickPage"
	>ftp.it.mtu.edu:/pub/QuickPage</a>)
		(in a comment to their staff)

</blockquote><br>
	... but, oddly, didn't find the paragraph in their
	previous issue.  It turns out that they didn't 
	know about any of the links I've discussed above and
	were referring readers to a commercial package (of which 
	there are several --- the most well-known being at
	<A HREF="http://www.spatch.com/">http://www.spatch.com/</A>).

<br><br>
	[I've copied the <a href="http://www.eklektix.com/lwn/">LWN</a> 
	staff as well.  This really 
	wasn't meant to "scoop" them, since I think that 
	LWN is the best thing since Linux Gazette --- and 
	it comes out four times as often!  Every LG reader 
	should also check it out!  I just can't figure out 
	where they get all the time to work on it.]

<br><br>
 Finally the oldest freely available package for this that I know of 
 is a perl scripts called '<tt>tpage</tt>' (Tom's Pager) a.k.a. ixobeeper.gz at:

<br><br>
	<A HREF="http://www.oasis.leo.org/perl/exts/date-time/scripts/comm/ixobeeper.dsc.html"
	>http://www.oasis.leo.org/perl/exts/date-time/scripts/comm/ixobeeper.dsc.html</A>
		

<br><br>
 Anyway I hope that helps.  Obviously you have plenty of
 options (which is the PERL motto).
