<p>
First off, TWDT is no longer TWDT. If you click on TWDT you find that the 
mailbag has "Thread continues here" links. Could we make TWDT be TWDT?
</p>

<p>
Secondly, we have the answers to last month's geekword. It would be nice to 
have the questions with it, so anyone that wants to admire the subtlety of 
the clues, or pick nits, don't have to flick between windows.

Well, there's all kinds of stuff you could do with 'apt-cache' to tell
you where the files are, but in short, they're all under
'/usr/share/doc/lg*'. In fact, '/usr/share/doc' should be the first
place you look for anything on your system that doesn't have built-in
help or a manpage.

<h3>Purpose of some spam messages?</h3>

<b>Kapil Hari Paranjape [kapil at imsc.res.in]</b><br />
<b>Thu, 1 Feb 2007 17:58:37 -0800</b>
</p>

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering if someone has thought about what is the purpose
of SPAM messages which only contain some mish-mash text. The
qualifying criteria are:
<pre>
	1. Only text without attachments.
	2. Text that contains incoherent sentences or disconnected sentences. [*]
	3. Definitely messages from addresses not known to the recipient.
</pre>
(The last is to exclude e-mail messages written by friends who are
not quite sober at the time of writing <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">).
</p>

<p>
Here are some possiblities that occured to me.
</p>

<p>
A. These are messages that are designed to test/mar the efficiency of
the spam detection systems currently employed by servers.
</p>

<p>
B. These messages contain coded messages that are flooded across the
internet in an attempt to disguise their true origin/destination. The
real message could be short one such as "the machine from which this
has been sent has serious security holes".
</p>

<p>
C. This is generated for someone's research project.
</p>

<p>
D. This is the result of some spam generating software/virus which has
   bugs.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if this is worth wondering about ... except ... why is someone
going to some trouble to make (a program which is making) life difficult
for everyone?
</p>

<p>
Pointers to prior discussion welcome.
</p>

<p>
Thanks and regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.
[*] Clearly (2) is subjective which makes such spam hard to detect
automatically.

Dear TAG,
I am a regular reader and wanted to first thank you for the great zine. I'll
probably be starting my own site/zine (long story short: 'tis all to keep in 
touch with my friends, who I have known for all my life but will have to 
leave them soon). The zine part won't be linux related(except maybe for one
column every now and then). 
</p>

<p>
I know I talk too much but, my question(s): When LG first started out, how did
you get the readers? How was it publicized? How did you get your very first 
reader? Also any tips (Kat? Ben? team?) ?
</p>

<p>
One more thing: Write more POLOTMs or else I'll have to resort to violent 
methods!

Love that URL in part 2. Freakin' "0xc8.0x2b.0x50.0x74"? You'd
think that anyone dumb enough to just click on URLs in these "bank"
emails has already been stripped to the bone by sharks, but a) it
doesn't kill them off, and 2) There's One Born Every Minute. I guess the
spammers and the scammers will never run out of "soft targets".

Thanks. I have to admit I have not yet taken your
advice, though they sound like good suggestions. I
did, however, find Marcel Gagne's book Moving to Linux
at the library. He mentioned Mandrake. I went to their
site, now Mandriva, and downloaded Mandriva One, a
free release (I'm willing to pay, but my needs are
light...no gaming, just music, video, word
processing.) However, when I try to open it, Microsoft
says it can't find the file to open it, and I get lost
after that. I've had MS Windows for 5 years, which I
installed, and I have downloaded a dozen or two
programs, but I'm still a newbie, I need specific
instructions in some cases. Like this one. Any help
would be most appreciated. The "Blue screen of Death"
is killing me! Thanks. John

Hello Answer Gang,
</p>

<p>
This is my first time posting to you so I hope I get it right.
</p>

<p>
I am having big issues with my WiFi connectivity. Basically everything
seems to be okay but attempting to ping an address results in a network
unreachable message. I've used drakconnect to setup the wireless setup.
The router itself is reporting the card as attached ! And ifconfig shows
a continuous stream of traffic to the card but nothing from it.
</p>

<p>
The contents of /var/messages looks fine, apart from perhaps the last
line:

post it here.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Rick, sorry for the private e-mail, but can you please expand on this 
&gt; part of your e-mail:
</pre>

<p>
Not a problem.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt;Aside:  It strikes me as very odd that all 20-odd "Exhibit B" badgeware
&gt; &gt;companies (MuleSource and others) elected to hang their clauses off a
&gt; &gt;copyleft licence (Mozilla Public License) whose copyleft provisions
&gt; &gt;inherently have _zero force_ in their (and their competitors')
&gt; &gt;no-distribution ASP usage model.  Isn't that a bit like requiring
&gt; &gt;spelunkers to wear sunscreen?  Don't they realise that about 3/4 of
&gt; &gt;their chosen licence is a <em>NO-OP</em> for their entire market segment?
&gt; 
&gt; I am not sure what you mean here. Feel free to drop my message if you 
&gt; don't answer private ones.
</pre>

<p>
A copyleft licence's provisions stating the obligation to give others
access to source code -- which are the main point of such licences and
what distinguishes them from simple permissive licences such as the BSD
and MIT/X licences -- trigger upon <em>distribution</em> of the covered code or
of derivative works from that code. 
</p>

<p>
In the ASP business model, however, you make absolutely full use of code
without the need to ever distribute it.  Therefore, for users operating
in that market, the source-access provisions of copyleft licences[1]
might as well not exist, since they never operate as intended:  ASP
users never need to publish source.  Effectively, ASP users can fork off
proprietary derivatives of copylefted works at will, and do anything
they wish with those, as long as they don't distribute (something their
deployment model makes unnecessary).
</p>

<p>
Companies like Google can modify, re-use, exploit other people's GPL,
MPL (etc.) works in ASP deployments for the entire coming millennium
without ever needing to share back their changes.  Or, seen another way, 
if Google <em>does</em> fully honour the intent of copyleft licences by sharing
back its changes, it can have no confidence that competitors won't then
take Google's changes proprietary in the manner described.  The intended
reciprocity of such copyleft licences thus gets finessed by the manner
of deployment.
</p>

<p>
My point to the "Exhibit B" firms is thus:  "Why on earth would you
use a licence most of whose key terms get automatically made
inapplicable by the basic business conditions of your market?  For
<em>this</em>, you paid for expensive legal advice?"
</p>

<p>
[1] Other than copyleft licences tailored specifically to address this
problem within the ASP market, three of which I cited:  Affero Public
License, Honest Public License, and the GPLv3 drafts.

Let's just be clear about what exactly was said about the "license's main
point." You are taking the quote out of context in order to make your
argument. What I was specifically talking about was the method that would
allow users wanting to use Mule in a commercial product with no attribution.
In no circumstance did I say that the license was designed to force people
to pay. The license is there to protect our IP. However I do understand the
confusion around the license and my comments--and understand that we all may
interpret these things differently.
</p>

<p>
That said, I appreciate the feedback but wonder why not a single person who
has so much to say about these licensing issues ever said "hey, we think you
should consider changing this, and here is my recommendation." The same goes
for the FAQ. If you think the information is incorrect how about helping us
fix it? Ross and I are incredibly easy to get ahold of and have numerous
emails and phone numbers. 
</p>

<p>
You do note that we made a change yesterday that significantly softens the
attribution clause, which I have stated publicly that the old version may
have not made sense for us in the first place. I am not sure that this
license is the best choice, but we are still evolving. Give us a hand and
we'll send you a Mule T-shirt (uh-oh, there's that attribution again <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":&gt;">)

Today's volleys in the licensing war.  Note that Timothy McIntyre 
is corporate counsel for one of the "Exhibit B" firms.  Earlier I 
"outed" him as a paid flack for one of the interested parties (a fact he
nowhere mentioned, at the time) when he posted his ostensibly personal
opinion that Socialtext's GAP licence [sic] should get OSI approval
because Attribution Assurance License had, earlier -- a non-sequitur
argument, and one that ignored AAL's clear violation of OSD#10, adopted
after AAL's approval.

Subject: Introducing Open Solutions Alliance
</pre>
Back in mid-December, when discussion of Socialtext's Generic
Attribution Provision and "Exhibit B" clauses got going and I'd posted a
couple of initial comments (e.g., that the wording of Exhibit B clauses
seemed to stand in the way of code reuse), I was surprised to find Brian
Behlendorf querying me in offlist mail about my reaction to such
clauses.  Brian's a good guy, and I was glad to give my assessment (that 
there was nothing inherently wrong with forced advertising clauses per
se, that the OSD#10 gaffe needed to be fixed, and that intrusion on reuse
in commerce has to be minor enough not to violate OSD#3&amp;6) -- but found
the experience odd.  For what reason was I being so promptly sounded out
in private?
</p>

<p>
Brian was of course one of OSI's founding Board members.  Lately, I'm
pretty sure his main concern has been Collab.net.
</p>

<p>
I noticed recently that on February 15, at a panel discussion at the
OpenSolutions Summit in NYC, Brian, representing Collab.net, is going to
be introducing to the world a new "trade association", the Open
Solutions Alliance (OSA), about which curiously little is being said
except that it will be "focusing on business use of open source apps",
and "not as a standards body, but more like a Good Housekeeping Seal of
Approval thing.".  Robin Miller has an interesting article about it:
<a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/03/1737253">http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/03/1737253</a>
</p>

<p>
Business use of open source apps is of course a very good thing.
However, somewhat disturbingly, the main backer of the OSA, and owner of
its OpenSolutionsAlliance.org domain, appears to be yet another
proprietary Web 2.0 company posing to the public as an open source firm:
Dark Horse Ventures, LLC of Norfolk, Virginia, DBA CentricCRM.
</p>

<p>
CentricCRM publishes a "Community Edition" that is professed to be open
source, but after you download it (which is possible only after
registering and logging into their site), key code turns out to be under
the "Centric Public License" (CPL), which is of course proprietary and
used as an inducement to get people to buy separate commercial-use
licences.
</p>

<p>
CPL itself can be viewed here:

<pre>
&gt; Sorry for trying again to push forward a "hypothetical discussions"...
&gt; After going through the whole genesis of Open Source, the
&gt; "non-military use" restriction sounds too clumsy to be constructively
&gt; considered in this mailing list. But it looks like there might be some
&gt; room for the notion of ethic.
&gt;
&gt; As our research project involves human subjects, it has to be reviewed
&gt; and monitored by an independent ethics committee. Our project has
&gt; restrictions in order to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being
&gt; of all trial subjects. As this is applying to our own software, in
&gt; which way will it be inherited by people reusing our sources?
</pre>

<p>
Well, you say your <em>project</em> includes ethical restrictions, which is
perfectly reasonable given its nature and aims.  The question is:  Is
someone who fetches the source code to your software and uses it
independently of your project required to adhere to the project's
restrictions on software usage?
</p>

<p>
I looked briefly through <a href="http://emotion-research.net/">http://emotion-research.net/</a> to see if I could 
determine what strings are currently attached to such source code, but
couldn't find the latter.
</p>

<p>
Really, the fundamental point is that code, to be open source, must 
have source available and be licensed to be usable for any purpose by
all parties present and future -- including people you (generic "you")
disapprove of, using it even for purposes you might highly disapprove
of:  Users such as your enemies, your competitors, your enemies'
great-grandchildren....  Usages such as warfare, blowing away cute furry
woodland creatures, commercial competition against your company, etc.
</p>

<p>
When you (speaking generically of "you" as licensor -- and please excuse
my using this occasion to make a broader point) are mouldering in the
grave, after your company and all its VC funders[1] were obliterated
when the Financial District Meteor of 2009 struck the corner of
California and Market Streets, your source code must still be fully
adaptable for any purpose, even after you yourself are a thin layer of
dust covered with an overlay of slowly cooling extrasolar feldspar.
Ideally, your <em>licence</em> should be, too -- which is why, for example, the
otherwise highly useful IBM Public License got quickly renamed to
"Common Public Licence" and all its internal company-specific references
were made generic to <em>licensor</em> rather than "IBM" (other than the
definition of "Agreement Steward", which is the party allowed to create
new versions of the licence, as copyright holder over that document).
</p>

<p>
Because -- hey! -- one of the core ideas of open source is to make reuse
by others feasible:  reuse of licences, equally as of code.  Open source
takes the long view, and says "What happens when _you're not around_,
any more?  And how do <em>other</em> people use your licence?"

Subject: Alfresco shifts to GPL
</pre>
Some good news in the license consolidation (and badgeware) discussion:
<pre>
        The company's free Community edition previously used the Mozilla
        Public License, but the move to GPL removes some barriers, said
        Matt Asay, Alfresco's vice president of marketing. The company's
        supported and Enterprise edition remains available under a
        commercial license.
         
        "We wanted the code to be bigger than the company," Asay said.
        "People basically know what (the GPL) means, so there's no time
        wasted wondering (about) MPL [and extra exhibit B clauses]."
         
        [...]
         
        the company did add to the GPL license a "FLOSS exception"
        provision that permits the software to be embedded in other
        FLOSS (free/libre/open-source software) packages. With the
        exception, those other projects don't have to worry about a
        potential requirement to release their own software under the
        GPL, Asay said.

Yes.  You may recall I asked John Roberts of SugarCRM to explain how a very

More to the immediate point, is there <em>anyone</em> left on this mailing list
who still doubts that the primary aim of all the "Exhibit B" addenda we've
seen from these 20-odd companies (most having cloned and slightly
mutated SugarCRM's clause, which pioneered the concept) is to impair
commercial reuse?  The MuleSource and SugarCRM FAQs say third parties
_may not sell derivatives_.  And MuleSource's CEO says outright that
their licence's main point is to force commercial users to buy separate
commercial licences![2]  How much clearer could this possibly be?

<h3>InfoWorld: Pentaho opens up further (Exhibit B to real MPL)</h3>

<p>
I should explain two references:  (1) "Larry L." refers to noted attorney,
author, and open source luminary Larry Lessig, whom Matt Asay (of the
OSI Board, but also a "business development" flack for badgeware firm
Alfresco) turns out to have studied under at Stanford Law School.  (2)
Mark Radcliffe is OSI's General Counsel, and is also reported (by ZDnet
columnist David Berlind) to have had a disturbing lead role, on the
side, in drafting on a consulting basis these non-OSD-compliant licences
and advising the firms who then use them and claim (falsely) to be
publishing "open source".  See: <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4124">http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=4124</a> and
<a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=3430">http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=3430</a>
</p>

<p>
It's also becoming quite apparent that the key aim of these "Exhibit B"
licences is to substantively reserve commecial-usage rights to the
copyright holder, while still claiming to be open source, and some of
them even admit it outright:
<a href="http://www.nicholasgoodman.com/bt/blog/2006/12/22/badgeware-ceo-to-community-buy-a-commercial-license/">http://www.nicholasgoodman.com/bt/blog/2006/12/22/badgeware-ceo-to-community-buy-a-commercial-license/</a>
Personally, I think it's always been understood that if you can't stand
competitors using your code in commerce, and aren't prepared to
out-compete them on an equal footing, that you aren't yet ready for open
source.   OSI President Michael Tiemann has said more or less the same thing:
<a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Fwd%3A-FW%3A-For-Approval%3A-Generic-Attribution-Provision--tf2757445.html#a7900005">http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Fwd%3A-FW%3A-For-Approval%3A-Generic-Attribution-Provision--tf2757445.html#a7900005</a>
...and he and I see eye-to-eye generally:
<a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Fwd%3A-FW%3A-For-Approval%3A-Generic-Attribution-Provision--tf2757445.html#a7900005">http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A--Fwd%3A-FW%3A-For-Approval%3A-Generic-Attribution-Provision--tf2757445.html#a7900005</a>
</p>

<p>
Here's the position paper that I and others have prepared against the
Generic Attribution Provision proposal -- and I consider it damning:
<a href="http://www.buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/GAP_Against">http://www.buni.org/mediawiki/index.php/GAP_Against</a>
</p>

<p>
What remains still hanging is whether OSI will seriously consider
<em>other</em> "Exhibit B"-like licences that aim to withhold some commercial
rights in some clever fashion that advocates can claim is something
else.
</p>

<p>
(Socialtext seems to have unofficially thrown in the towel on the GAP
proposal, but says it wishes to submit a new "attribution" (badgeware) 
licence -- maybe one in complete English sentences, this time.

I never saw a pice of shit like this.
This book is perhaps even illegal, it seems to be a copy of the IPCOP

Hi, Ireaded your article about 6 seat Linux enviroment.

<p>
I have an idea from that, but I don't have anyclue how to do it. I Have  
Ubuntu 6.10, gnome, and 2 disjointed screens. Now I'd like to bind 2  
keyboards, one for each screen, but still use my mouse as of now, jumping  
to another screen over the edge of monitor. Would that be possible in any  
way?

</p>

<p>
There are also a fair number of problems with NX.
</p>

<p>
- It is based on a rather old verson of the X server. That X server has
  several known security bugs. There is a reason most distributions do
  not ship even the open-source NX parts.
- Resuming a session doesn't always work. Murphy says it fails to work
  when it's most likely that your session has important but unsaved data
  in it. :-/
- The song+dance with the separate "nx" user and the client ssh key
  is completely unnecessary. Using a straight ssh login would be a whole
  lot simpler. It would also be more secure, because the user would be
  able to use their ssh keychains instead of typing in a password.
- Relies on a patched ssh client. An <strong>old</strong> ssh client. A patch which
  introduces a lot of code that belongs in a separate program.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the security people of several major distribution have
basically vetoed including NX should tell you something.

If you're a Linux user in the USA, your Linux distribution either may or
may not properly change to Daylight Savings time on March 11, 2007:  A 2005 
act of Congress extends Daylight time three weeks earlier in the
spring and one week later in the fall, starting this year.[1]

...if in the Pacific time zone, or something else with "D" in the
middle, if in one of the other zones.  That's the desired output, a week 
after the time change.  By contrast, if the middle letter is "S" for 
Standard Time, then your system software definitely and urgently needs
updating.

Dear Sleepless Gang ;)
</p>

<pre>
&gt; And a follow-up, since some readers may not have understood the point of
&gt; that console session transcript.
&gt;   
</pre>
Just wanna add something to this stress test using kernel compilation. 
Before you issue make -j &lt;n&gt;, it would be a better a idea to do:
<pre>
$ make allyesconfig
</pre>
This way, you'll make sure you are enabling all kernel configurations. 
If it is a multiple choice configuration item, Makefile will pick the 
default preferred configuration for you. This will make stress testing 
longer and consumes even more larger RAM portion (taken as page cache 
and compiler's stack &amp; heap)
</p>

<p>
You could also add V=1 to make kernel compilation more verbose:
<pre>
make V=1 -j &lt;n&gt;
</pre>
It will make Makefile produces lots of screen's output and surely put 
another area of stress.
</p>

<p>
Still not satisfied? Open an xterm session or just logon to another 
virtual console. Do this:
<pre>
$ while : ; done tail -f /dev/zero; done
</pre>
It is another memory eater that will repeatedly make your kernel engages 
so-called OOM (Out Of Memory) Killer. Short story, it will exhaust your 
memory even faster. But IMHO, you only need to do this if you have a 
real plenty of RAM, let's say 4GB or more.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />FSFe Introduces Fiduciary License Agreement</h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is trying to reduce problems
inherent in managing copyrights in large projects by launching a Fiduciary
License Agreement. This is essentially a way for a free software project to
place its collective copyright under the control of a single entity, the
FSFe. This has two main benefits. When contributors to a project become
difficult to track down, for a variety of reasons, the future of the
project gets threatened. If a single organization holds the copyright, it
is that much easier to deal with any legal issues, even in the absence of
the original authors. The second benefit is that different copyright
regimes across the world can be reconciled. With Open Source software
development being extremely geographically distributed, and getting more
so, this is an very important.</p>

<p>The various pros and cons of this move are discussed in an article on <a
href="http://enterprise.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/09/1735247&amp;from=rss">Linux.com</a>.
The agreement is available at the <a
href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/fla/">FSFe website</a>.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Sun Looks to GPL v3 for Java, Solaris</h3>

<p>As reported earlier, Sun Microsystems is considering switching
OpenSolaris  to GPL v3. Java might also be licensed under GPL v3. Sun wants
to switch to the GPL so that it can appeal to developers who favor this
license. Also, GPL v3 is expected to have strong protection from patenting
issues. Sun is working closely with the Free Software Foundation on this.
</p>

<p>For Solaris, Sun will probably stick with a dual-licensing model, using
both the CDDL and GPL v3. This is possible since Sun owns all the copyright
to Solaris. <a
href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39285874,00.htm">ZDNet
UK</a> has more details on this issue.</p>

vulnerability in Solaris 10. The telnet daemon has a security hole that
allows root access to be gained in a trivial manner. This was rather
embarrassing for Sun, since Solaris is supposed to be one of the most
secure server  operating systems. More information on this is available
from <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />OpenSSL Revalidated After Arduous Battle</h3>

<p>OpenSSL has finally regained its FIPS 140-2 validation, and is available
for download. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
coordinates the requirements and standards for cryptographic modules, for
use by federal departments and agencies in the United States. Usually, this
process takes a few months, but in this case it took five years. This was
due to the entirely new approach that was followed to test OpenSSL. </p>

<p>Certain commercial software vendors also questioned the viability of an
Open Source SSL toolkit. The complaints included some interesting
questions, including one about the source code being "Communist", since a
Russian developer worked on it. There were valid questions as well, and the
OpenSSL developers state that their product is more secure now, after going
through such an extensive review process.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" /> Linus Torvalds takes on GNOME</h3>

<p>Linus Torvalds does not like the GNOME graphical environment, and he
recently <a

so</a> in no uncertain terms. This led to an ugly flame war on various

GNOME for a month, and make constructive suggestions, instead of
"mudslinging".</p>

<p>Linus responded by submitting a string of patches that would "improve
the code", and add new features. These were subsequently <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Debian Gets Win32 Installer</h3>


<p>"Debian-Installer Loader", a win32 loader for Debian Installer was
released in February. This makes it simple to install Debian from a system
that has Microsoft Windows installed. According to the developers, "D-I-L
runs on the users' win32 system, auto-detects whether the CPU supports
64-bits, picks the appropriate linux and initrd.gz images for netboot, and
uses GRUB for DOS to chainload into it."</p>

<p>Inspired by a similar project for Ubuntu, it is hoped that this will
make it easier to migrate to Debian from Windows. It will also make it easy
to install Debian on systems that lack a CD-ROM drive, and it cuts out the
need for a user to burn an ISO image. The website <a

with each other's Linux distributions. Linspire/Freespire will now be based
on  Ubuntu, rather than Debian, and Ubuntu will integrate with Linspire's
CNR package installer/updater. This is good news for users, since the Click
'N Run system is <a

to be simple, and effective.</p>

<p>The next version of Ubuntu, Feisty Fawn, will feature integration with
CNR. Ubuntu users will be able to use the CNR client to easily download and
install commercial programs and proprietary media drivers and codecs. If it
lives up to the hype, it should be a refreshing alternative to either
manually hunting down the various programs, or using scripts like <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Ubuntu Refuses to Activate Binary Drivers, and Reduces Support for PowerPC</h3>

<p>The Ubuntu Technical Board has decided to forego activating binary only
drivers by default in the next version of Ubuntu. The Board feels that
there is a need for wider testing of the alternatives available, and that
some of the relevant software is not fully mature yet.</p>

<p>However, Ubuntu 7.04 will make it "trivially easy" to enable both
enhanced desktop effects and the necessary driver support. This is a
best-of-both-worlds approach, which will be appreciated by many users.</p>

<p>In related news, the Technical Board also decided to reclassify the
PowerPC version of Ubuntu as "unofficial". A lack of resources was cited as
the reason.</p>

Samuel Kotel Bisbee-vonKaufmann was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA
area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age

and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a

Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?

<p>
<p>
In issue #86 of the <em>Linux Gazette</em> there's a nice example of how to
remap keys from a C application:
</p>

<p>
<a href="../issue86/misc/bint/kbe.c.txt">http://linuxgazette.net/issue86/misc/bint/kbe.c.txt</a>
</p>

<p>
The author, the late <a href="../authors/bint.html">Stephen Bint</a>,
was working on an editor for the text console and a library for such
an editor. He didn't like to have the screen "dirtied" when pressing
&lt;PgUp&gt; or &lt;PgDn&gt; while also pressing the &lt;Shift&gt; key.
Indeed, that combination is reserved by default to scroll backward or
forward through console output: the kernel will intervene and do things
before the editor comes to know what keys you have pressed.  </p>

<p>
There is a way around it: redefine the keys temporarily,
restoring them when exiting your application. Of course, if
you can understand the C source for loadkeys and dumpkeys,
you can skip both Stephen's examples and what follows. However,
since I had problems getting even a vague idea of what loadkeys
and dumpkeys do, I decided to write down a few details, to
complement the old <em>LG</em> article referenced above.
</p>

<p>
All of this is relevant only for the GNU/Linux text console.
You can forget about anything this "simple" if you work only under X11.

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>
A PC keyboard sends signals to the Linux kernel - more
precisely, to the kernel keyboard driver - telling it that a
certain key has been pressed or released. Normally,
applications let the kernel translate those signals into
strings using the current (screen) character set and the
traditional ASCII encoding, where one character equals one
byte. This used to be the normal approach, until recently.
Nowadays, Unicode is spreading, and you are now likely to
have Unicode for the screen, rather than a character set as in
the old days. The keyboard will then produce Unicode strings, using
the UTF-8 encoding, where one character may need more than
one byte. For the purpose of this article, however, there is no
difference between the two modes; we refer to them both as
translation mode.
</p>

<p>
Direct handling of keyboard signals (raw and semi-raw mode)
by the application is rare.
</p>

<p>
The <em>keymap</em> tells you about the translation the kernel is doing for
you. However, if you want to know what's going on, don't look into the
local keymap: It is not complete, since it includes other files; it is
formatted in an inconvenient way; and your distro may have modified it at
boot time anyway. If you want to know what is really in force, and be able
to read it, issue
</p>

<pre>
    dumpkeys -1 &gt; my_keymap.txt
</pre>

<p>
at the shell prompt and examine (the nicely formatted)
my_keymap.txt. Consider the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li> some keys insert characters: you press &lt;a&gt; and
    you see an 'a' inserted at the cursor.
<li> some keys insert nothing but have some effect:
    you press &lt;left&gt;, the cursor usually moves one space to the left.
<li>   some keys are defined as 'VoidSymbol', no action will be
    taken on them.
<li> some keys are listed but do not seem to exist. Indeed,
    they do not exist, since the Linux keymap also applies to
    keyboards different from the standard PC keyboard you are
    using.
</ul>

<p>
Whatever the keys do, they do it on the basis of an 'action
code' assigned to them. For keymap programming, you must
know these action codes. How do you get them? Issue
</p>

<pre>
    dumpkeys --long-info &gt; actioncodes.txt
</pre>

<p>
at the prompt. You get a list of action codes (left column)
and the key labels for them (right column). Some labels have
synonyms: for instance, the action code for &lt;PgUp&gt; is 0x0118,
but you will not read 'PgUp' next to it; you will see the
label 'Prior'. 
</p>

<p>
Keys like &lt;Left&gt; may not insert anything, but still they have
their effects:
</p>

<ul>
<li>(i)   caused directly by the kernel keyboard driver
<li>(ii)  caused by the application as soon it understands that
      a certain key was pressed.
</ul>

<p>
An example of the first kind is &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;PgUp&gt; where the
console output is scrolled bypassing the current
application.
</p>

<p>
However, more often than not we are concerned about (ii). We
press &lt;Left&gt;, the cursor moves one space to the left, the
application is in control. That implies the application has
been notified that &lt;Left&gt; was pressed. How was it notified?
The keyboard driver knows the action code for the key
&lt;Left&gt;. Although it does not arrange directly for the cursor
movement, the action code arranges for a string to be sent
to the application, so the application can do the right thing.
The string for &lt;Left&gt; is normally "\033[D", where the octal
\033 represents the escape character. It is the application
that decides to move the cursor left upon receiving
"\033[D".
</p>

<p>
In translation mode, the application receives strings of one
character, normally for insertion of that character, or
multi-character strings for functional keys triggering some
action. They are called functional keys because they
are not just the F1 to F12 keys across the upper row of the
keyboard; the &lt;Left&gt; key is also a functional key.
Unfortunately, the keymap utilities say 'function keys' - i.e.,
&lt;Left&gt; is a function key to them. To put it mildly, this is just a
bit confusing.
</p>

<p>
So, beside those few exceptions like &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;PgUp&gt;, the
application is running the show. It receives strings of one
or more characters. The one-character strings are very often
for insertion, but not always so. You surely have been
exposed to old-style user interaction: press 'a' for All or
'c' for Cancel.
</p>

<p>
OK, but where do those strings like "\033[D" for &lt;Left&gt; come
from?
</p>

<p>
For that, look into the local keymap - e.g., the US default
keymap. Almost at the top of the keymap, you will see a line that says
</p>

<pre>
    strings as usual
</pre>

<p>
and that's it. That line defines the strings for F1-F20 and
for Home, End,..., Left, Right, and so on. The strings
originate from DEC hardware, and are still around after DEC
passed away in the mid-90s.
</p>

<p>
Now, why is the keymap defining F1-F20, if the keyboard has
only F1-F12? Because Unix keyboards were not PC keyboards.
The default Linux keymaps (any language) set
</p>

<pre class="code">
    shift keycode 59 = F13      (physical F1 key)
    shift keycode 60 = F14      (physical F2 key)
    ...
    shift keycode 66 = F20      (physical F8 key)
</pre>

<p>
So F13-F20 are not useless; actually they are not enough.
Indeed, you will notice that
</p>

<pre class="code">
    control keycode 59 = F25    (physical F1 key)
    control keycode 60 = F26    (physical F2 key)
    ...
    control keycode 88 = F36    (physical F12 key)
</pre>

<p>
are defined in the US keymap, although no strings are
assigned to F21 and up. These entries mean, e.g., that
&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;F1&gt; will give F13 and &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F1&gt; will give F25. However,
since F25 has an empty string, an empty string is forwarded
to the application, and the application does exactly nothing.
</p>

<p>
Why is it so? Why are those keys set to send an empty
string? Well, Linux 1.0 had a default keymap where
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F1&gt; was same as F1 - and so on. Sometime down the
road, there was a change, for reasons which to me do not seem
worth an investigative effort. Just note that the Russian
Linux keymap has not changed on this point, and that FreeBSD
has low-level operations on &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F1&gt; to &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F10&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Summing up, the keys not used by the kernel for its own
purposes send a standard string to the application, possibly
an empty string. Other keys are just void - i.e., undefined.

<h3>2. Changing the keymap</h3>

<p>
Before we get into some C code, let's mention the obvious: You can modify
your keymap in an editor and then activate it.  You are supposed to be
already in the know, in this respect, otherwise you would not be able to
understand what this article is about.
</p>

<p>
For instance, take those shifted &lt;PgUp&gt; and &lt;PgDn&gt; for
scrolling the console. You edit the keymap to
</p>

<pre class="code">
    shift keycode 104       = Prior
    control alt keycode 104 = Scroll_Backward

    shift keycode 109       = Next
    control alt keycode 109 = Scroll_Forward
</pre>

<p>
save it, load it with loadkeys and the console scrolling
will be done with &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;PgUp&gt;, &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;PgDn&gt; , which
is not in anybody's way.
</p>

<p>
This is, of course, a lot easier to do and to understand
than Stephen's code; however, Stephen gave a nice example of how
to use ioctls, and here is where we resume his efforts. We'll
add a little example, and show how to use a couple of those
ioctls.
</p>

<p>
We want to assign a string to &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; so as to be able
to tell &lt;Enter&gt; from &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; - in the default
keymap, these are the same. Here are all the details required:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    physical key        &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;
    keycode             28
    action code label   F50
    action code         0x013b
    associated string   "\033[M~4"
</pre>

<ol>
<li>Where does the keycode come from? From the keymap.
<li>Where does F50 come from? It's arbitrary. The keymap
understands F1-F255, but only F1-F20 are fully defined with
strings. F25-F36 are there but not fully defined. F50 should
not encroach on anything. Needless to say, it can be
changed.
<li>Where does the action code come from? From the file
'actioncodes.txt' that we generated a couple of paragraphs
upstream.
<li>Where does the associated string come from? It's
arbitrary; you are welcome to replace it with whatever you like.
<li>In a first step, we insert a couple of headers and
definitions in our code (if not already there):

<pre class="code">
    #include &lt;linux/kd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;linux/keyboard.h&gt;
    struct kbentry ke;
    struct kbsentry ks;
</pre>

<p>
In a second step, we instruct the keyboard driver to
associate our string with F50:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    ks.kb_func   = 50;
    ks.kb_string = "\033[M~4";
    ioctl(fileno(stdin), KDSKBSENT, &amp;ks);
    //  if assignment fails, an error will be set
    //  in global variable ERR
</pre>

<p>
This and the kbentry/kbsentry structures are scantily
documented in the manpage console_ioctl, written in 1995 and
never updated. Same for KDSKBSENT, which can be memorized as
'Keyboard Driver Set KeyBoard String ENTry'.
</p>

<li>
Finally, we bind F50 to &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;:

<pre class="code">
    ke.kb_table = 4;
    ke.kb_index = 28;
    ke.kb_value = 0x013b;
</pre>

<p>
The kb_table is determined by the modifier used. We are
pressing two keys, &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Enter&gt;, so we are using
modifier &lt;Ctrl&gt; which has number 4 in the keymap.
</p>

<p>
The kb_index is the keycode, the kb_value is the action
code, both already explicitly stated above.
</p>

<p>
We use yet another ioctl call:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    ioctl(fd,KDSKBENT,&amp;ke);
    // if assignment fails, an error will be set
    // in global variable ERR
</pre>

<p>
and we are done - just pay attention when typing KDSKBSENT
vs. KDSKBENT. F50 is now associated with the string of our
choice. This string is sent to the application when
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; is pressed.
</p>
</ol>

<h3>3. Moral</h3>

<p>
Essentially, what we have done is to allow for
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;Enter&gt;
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;m&gt;
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;
</pre>

<p>
to be all distinct. Think about it: The first two send
the same string, namely "^M", character 13. They can be told
apart by checking the modifier, since the first one is produced
with 1 key, while the second one needs 2 keys.
</p>

<p>
The third entry, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;, can not, by default, be
distinguished from &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;m&gt;, since both produce "^M", and
both signal that &lt;Ctrl&gt; was pressed. (You would have to move
to raw or semi-raw mode to find out - not recommended.) With
our little modification, we now have all our ducks in a row. Also,
the trick can be applied elsewhere, for instance, to &lt;Tab&gt;,
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Note that applications other than the one you are working
on may rely on the keymap defaults, and get confused by your
ioctls intervention. A well-behaved application should thus
reverse the changes made. However, if the application
crashes for whatever reasons, the reversing code will not
be executed, and the keyboard will not be reset.
</p>

<p>
In other words: when you exit this application, just reload
the default keymap. For that, the command will be
</p>

<pre>
    loadkeys us
</pre>

<p>
or 'uk' or 'fr' or 'ge', or whatever you are using.
</p>

[[[  Hello, I've been attending Scale5x. Here is my first report. - Kapil  ]]]
</p>

<p>
Don Marti spoke about "Going beyond User-Friendly to
User-Intimate with desktop tweaking power".
</p>

<p>
He began the talk with a description of how various platforms and
GUIs have evolved the Human Interface Guidelines and this was a bit
worrisome since I didn't want to hear much more about those. But I
need not have worried---he was just setting up an obstacle so that he
could show us the ways around it!
</p>

<p>
Thomas Adam would have found this talk interesting since the subtext
of this first 3/4 of talk was "How can we make Gnome/Metacity behave
more like fvwm/scwm/sawfish when we want it to?" Marti gave
a number of tips on how to use the tools "xev", "xwininfo",
"xlsclients", "xsel" and friends to make it possible to provide a
command-line/keyboard/scriptable interface to applications have only
dialog boxes and mouse clicks.
</p>

<p>
In the last quarter of his talk Marti talked about some new ways of
interacting with the computer. The simplest of these are the extra keys
on laptops which are not handled by the keyboard driver. More
unconventional are things like the hard-disk acceleration detection
driver on some laptops; you can use this to detect the orientation of
your laptop to flip the screen. A rather cool idea was using your hand
to cover the wireless antenna and have a program that detects Wi-Fi
signal strength use this in some way---for example, as an application
launcher or even a "theremin".
</p>

<p>
Marti then outlined some dangers of this way of tweaking the
interface:
</p>
<pre>
	(a) Your computer truly becomes personal. Soon no one
	else can use it and you can't use someone else's computer
	either!
	(b) This kind of programming really sucks up time without
	necessarily contributing to the community ... unless you give
	a talk about it or write an article explaining things.
</pre>
<p>
All in all a fun talk and a fun way to start the day.

</p>

<p>
Roger Klorese from Xen spoke about "Xen: The Open Source industry
standard for virtualisation".
</p>

<p>
For those of our readers who don't know this yet, "Xen" is a system
for running multiple "virtual" systems on one box. As the commonly
available systems today have more and more unused resources, running
virtual systems is one way to get more out of your box.
</p>

<p>
The mechanism used by "Xen" is called "paravirtualisation" which I
will try to explain briefly below to the best of my understanding.
</p>

<p>
There is always a "master" system which we can call "host"; the
others are called "guest" systems. In older virtualisation techniques,
system calls generated in the "guest" system were trapped and passed
to the "host" to be handled. This trapping was done by generating a
fault whenever such a system call was executed.
</p>

<p>
In paravirtualisation this fault generation is avoided in one
of two ways; in either case this leads to smoother running "guest"
systems. One is by re-building the kernel of the "guest" virtual
system so that it interacts with a certain well-defined "API" for
system calls called the "Hypervisor API". The other is through
"hardware assist" where the CPU is given a "Hypervisor Table" by which
it re-directs calls to the "Hypervisor". In either case there is a
Hypervisor layer which is <strong>not</strong> a full system but merely a kind of
system-call router. Thus the Hypervisor could be made to route the
system call to the "host" or could also be made to route the system
call directly to the hardware---the hypervisor configuration tools
can be used to dynamically change this routing information.
</p>

<p>
The speaker clearly had a problem about where to pitch his talk---the
jargon did not grow steadily but came and went in waves. While some
of "Xen" is available as Free and Open Source there is also a product
that is released by the the same group. The lines between what are
features of the Open Source version and the product version were
often not clearly pointed out, which made this occasionally sound
like a marketing talk. This feeling was accentuated by digs at the
"opposition".
</p>

<p>
In summary, the whole game of "virtualisation" is clearly an
interesting one to get involved in during the coming year(s). The talk
could have been better.

<p>
Jono Bacon of Canonical spoke about "How to Herd Cats and Influence
People". This was basically a talk about how to build the community
around an open source project.
</p>

<p>
Jone clearly had a lot of skill in doing this as he got the audience
chanting and interacting with him---he even encouraged some Gentoo
hecklers! He explained his experience with Ubuntu and Canonical and
creating the community around the Ubuntu project---this is his primary
purpose at Canonical. According to him there are four important
aspects of this work:
</p>
<pre>
	1. Find good people.
	2. Organise them in teams.
	3. Make an overall structure which keeps
	   these teams working with each other.
	4. Create a mechanism to bring in new people.
</pre>
<p>
Though this talk was very entertaining in many ways I can't honestly
say that I brought away much more than that from it.
</p>

<p>
In particular, the aspect of "Herding Cats", which I thought referred
to the fact that these are all quite smart people who consequently
do not "herd" easily, was not discussed much. Is the Ubuntu community
less visibly "flame"-y than the Debian or Gentoo community because it
is young or is it something in the way they organise themselves? A
discussion of this question is what I would have liked to hear.

<p>
Alex Ionescu spoke about "ReactOS--bridging the gap between Windows
and Open Source". He is the lead developer in a project to construct
a clean-room implementation of an open source replacement of the
Windows NT kernel. This replacement is the core of ReactOS.
</p>

<p>
Alex explained that the motivation for this work was from many
directions. There is the perennial inter-operability issue; to help
us make use of documents and/or environments that are meant for that
90-95% of the computer user world that is still on Windows. There is
the research interest in a operating system that has a fundamentally
different design from the monolithic Linux or BSD kernel that we are
used to.  There is also the desire to play games that are written
for Windows-only, or more generally to run that one application that
some users have not found a Free and Open Source alternative for. He
<strong>didn't</strong> mention the users who might <strong>need</strong> ReactOS when MicroSoft
stops supporting Windows XP and starts requiring users to upgrade to
Vista.
</p>

<p>
Alex explained that the kernel is working fine but there are still a
lot of issues to be sorted out---especially with the layers over the
kernel. In particular, the GUI of Windows is driven through the 
"Win32K" layer for which there is currently no complete replacement
in ReactOS. However, they are currently able to run Open Source
applications on ReactOS --- including OpenOffice, Evolution and
Firefox. Unfortunately, they cannot run MS-Office, Exchange or
Explorer just yet.
</p>

<p>
Alex tried to motivate the audience to get involved with this project,
as it has a number of benefits to the Free and Open Source community
in addition to the ones mentioned above.
</p>
<pre>
	1. Programs get testing and debugging in an environment that
	is different from the standard one---this points out some
	flaws in the login.
	2. Programs meant for Windows can be debugged and traced
	which is much more difficult to do with the native
	environment without signing various NDA's and buying
	expensive tools.
</pre>
<p>
This was a well organised and well presented talk. I went for it
because of my interest in operating systems and also in order to
underline my support for the hard work done by a group of dedicated
developers. It is difficult to get rid of the feeling that this
project will get little more than that from most of us.

<p>
Chris Dibona spoke on "Open Source licensing, a review with some
corner cases". Chris Dibona is now working for Google so I thought it
would be a different point of view from that which Rick Moen has
been sharing with us. In short, it was <strong>not</strong> (though Chris did not use
the term "badgeware")--Rick had prepared me too well.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[[[ Kapil is referring to <a
href="../134/moen.html">(OSI,
GAP, and "Exhibit B" licences)</a> and
these followup discussions--(<a href="../135/lg_talkback2.html">Talkback:134/moen.html</a>, <a href="lg_mail2.html">Issue 136 Mailbag, Part 2</a>). - Kat ]]]</p>

<p>
For those who have been following Rick's postings to TAG this will be
old hat but let me try to review what Chris said anyway. He explained
why trying to get credit in various ways:
</p>
<pre>
	1. By a direct request for payment.
	2. By requiring explicit attribution ("badgeware").
	3. By requiring acceptance of philosophy ("don't use this for
	   the military").
	4. By requiring the purchase of specific hardware.
</pre>
<p>
and so on, leads to licenses which are not open source. To those who
need any of that Chris' advice was "Don't try to be Open
Source---it's OK! Just don't claim to be Open Source either!"
</p>

<p>
He had two bits of advice. One was to read Professor Ed Felten's
deposition to the court regarding the relation between code and free
speech. The other was that we should all read the text of the GPLv3.
</p>

<p>
All in all a great talk and a great way for me to start day 2 ---
(Yes I was late getting there).

<p>
Ted Haeger and Erin Quill from Novell/SUSE spoke on "Linux,
Virtualisation and Virtualisation Management".
</p>

<p>
I wrote earlier how there were talks on Xen and virtualisation and
given some explanation of how I understand these concepts. In this
talk the speakers wanted to show us how easy it is to install a new
virtual machine under SUSE Enterprise Linux and how easy it is to
manage such a machine.
</p>

<p>
The installation was really easy but I wished they had explained the
steps a little more than saying "you point here" and "you click
there" and (but for an occasional "cluck" when the error box appears)
you are done. Just talking through the steps that are happening under
the hood so that we could visualise what was happening would
have helped those of us who wanted something a bit more technical.
</p>

<p>
The second part, about virtual machine management, was also quite
impressive with regard to the ease of management via a graphical
interface. All the resource allocation of and for virtual machines was
done from a point-click-drag-drop kind of interface. It is clear that
SUSE have fully absorbed the GUI paradigm for system administrators
that Novell perhaps pioneered.
</p>

<p>
It is perhaps also clear that I do not particularly like this
paradigm. If you do not know what is happening under the hood and
cannot tinker with it a bit, you should probably not be doing system
administration---IMHO. Still, the talk showcased some impressive
prettying-up of the Xen virtualisation system.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The last talk (for me) at Scale5x was the one by Don Armstrong on
"From Sarge to Etch". Don Armstrong is a Debian Developer who among
other things is one of the people managing the Bug Tracking System
(BTS).
</p>

<p>
Now any review by me of a talk by a Debian person is probably very
likely to be biased, but I thought it was a very rich talk. If
anything, Don had too much material (which is a common error of
graduate students!). So let me summarise the main points:
</p>

<pre>
	1. How does Debian release? What users can do to help.
	   Some tools to help users help Debian.
	2. Using "aptitude". Why "aptitude" surpasses "apt-get".
	3. Upgrading from Sarge to Etch.
	4. Pointers to obtaining information about Debian,
	   Debian developers and Debian packages.
</pre>
<p>
One important point he made which may seem contradictory is that
Debian users who keep wanting Debian to release "etch" as stable will
actually benefit from checking it on a "test" machine and filing
bugs. While this may increase the RC bug counti, it will improve the
quality of the release. Furthermore, fresh information on a bug can
often help track it down. So his message to all Debian users was-- keep
finding and filing those bugs. (Hint: Use "reportbug" when you do.)
</p>

<p>
The heart of "apt-get" is "libapt" and the former was meant as a
"demo" program--which achieved "world domination". The newer
curses and command-line program "aptitude" is a meant as a more
complete interface to "libapt". In particular, it can do everything
that "apt-get" can do and more. One important addition is that it can
give hints for conflict resolution. Another is that it can keep track
of packages that are installed only as dependencies--in other words
it incorporates some features of "deborphan"/"debfoster". Then there
are pattern searches. All this with good documentation. Check out 
"aptitude" and you will enjoy it--the "etch" version is even better!
</p>

<p>
The entire text of Don's talk and host of other information (like the
re-usable bits of his "rc" files) can be found on his web site at
<a href="http://www.donarmstrong.com">http://www.donarmstrong.com</a>. (I was surprised and pleased to see that his
"graphical" interface is "ion" and his chosen method of creating a
presentation is "latex-beamer".)
</p>

<p>
A great way to end.

</p>

<p>
One of the points of going to such conventions is to meet people.
</p>

<p>
I met faces that were only familiar from photographs--our editor
and our TAG editor. Indeed, I met Ben and Kat on Day 2. That was
really great but we could not chat much given the tempo of talks and
so on.
</p>

<p>
Part of the adventure of getting to Scale5x was exactly that--getting
there. I had decided that since it was only myself that was being
transported--no other people and no equipment--it was time to be
environment-friendly and use Public Transportation. "Public Transportation
in LA? You must be kidding!" At least that was the response of many people
I talked to. In the end, the journey by bus and metro was rather easy. It
was long but far from boring. I had some mathematics to keep me company, but
there was all the different kinds of LA that one can only see while riding
in a bus.
</p>

<p>
I have not been to many FOSS meetings in the past--preferring to be a
mailing list person. However, one thing that one notices is that there
is surge of companies coming to these meetings nowadays. The technical
content of the talks was also rather low--perhaps this why it was
called "Expo" and not "DevConf". However, most of the talks which I
attended were well-prepared and useful.
</p>

<p>
All in all a great experience. Since it was Kat who pointed out in
her posting to TAG that "scale5x" was happening just in my temporary
neighbourhood, a big thank you to her as well.

Kapil Hari Paranjape has been a ``hack''-er since his punch-card days.
Specifically, this means that he has never written a ``real'' program.
He has merely tinkered with programs written by others. After playing
with Minix in 1990-91 he thought of writing his first program---a
``genuine'' *nix kernel for the x86 class of machines. Luckily for him a
certain L. Torvalds got there first---thereby saving him the trouble
(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those
days---much to the dismay of many around him who think he should
concentrate on mathematical research---which is his paying job. The
interplay between actual running programs, what can be computed in
principle and what can be shown to exist continues to fascinate him.

<h1>A Beginner's Guide to Dual Booting Linux Mint and Windows XP</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/lazar.html">Shane Lazar</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>This article is a first for me. I wrote it for a friend of mine who is interested
in trying out an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system"
target="blank">Operating System (OS)</a> that I have a habit of promoting - you
guessed it, we are talking about Linux. But he is unsure how to go about it and is
not really ready to get rid of Windows - yet. And I understand him: moving to a new
OS can be unnerving and would be easier if it was done in phases. I promised I would
help him, but since he is in another country, I decided that writing an article would
be the best way to go. In this spirit, I am going to show how to go about this by
actually going through the steps of the installation.  </p>

<p>What is <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a>? This
is a rather new <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/linux-distribution"
target="_blank">distribution</a> that is based on the very famous <a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> Linux distribution. Linux
Mint is, in my opinion, easier for new users - since most of the bells and whistles,
including support for proprietary hardware, is supposed to work out-of-the-box. And
in its latest incarnation, Linux Mint 2.2 Bianca, things just got a lot better!</p>

<p>First, you will have to <a href= "http://www.linuxmint.com/download.html"
target="_blank">download</a> the install CD image (<tt>LinuxMint-2.2.iso</tt>); it's
about 700MB, so it will take some time. Once you have it, you can verify it by
getting the <a href=
"http://distroplanet.com/downloads/LinuxMint/LinuxMint-2.2.md5sum">checksum</a> file
and following <a href="http://community.ofset.org/wiki/HowTo_Verify_a_MD5_sum"
target= "_blank">these instructions</a>. Then, you will need to burn this image file
to CD. This does <b>not</b> mean just adding the <tt>LinuxMint-2.2.iso</tt> file and
burning a data CD. <a href="http://www.joomlatraining.org.uk/content/view/300/65/"
target= "_blank">Here</a> and <a href="http://iso.snoekonline.com/iso.htm"
target="_blank">here</a> are two websites that explain how to do this in Windows. I
recommend that you burn the CD at the slowest speed possible to avoid errors. Once
you are done, there should be two folders on the CD named <tt>casper</tt> and
<tt>isolinux</tt>, and a file <tt>md5sum.txt</tt>.  If not, something has gone wrong
and the CD will not work.</p>

<p>In all my messing around with installing various distributions, I have never faced
a scenario where I lost all the data on my hard drive - and I have certainly done
enough messing around. However, better safe than sorry - so, I would recommend you
backup all the data on your computer. I am just avoiding any possible lawsuits
here... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" /> No, really - do make sure to back
up.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to make some space on your hard drive in which to install
Linux. Mint needs an absolute minimum of 3GB, but I would strongly recommend at least
5GB - with hard drives as huge as they are today, there's no excuse for cramping
yourself (more would be even better.) Make sure to run <em>Disk Defragmenter</em> and
defragment your entire hard disk, so that all your free space is located in one big
chunk and not spread out in little bits. Now, I am not sure how it works in Windows -
it's been a while since I used it - but you probably should <b>not</b> use your
computer while defragmenting (otherwise it starts defragmenting from the beginning
each time there's a write to the hard disk.) Linux avoids this whole problem by not
allowing the hard disk to get fragmented in the first place. Clever, huh? Once you
are done with this, we can move to the fun stuff - installing Linux Mint!</p>

<p>Put your newly-created Linux Mint CD into the CD/DVD drive and reboot; you may
need to set your BIOS to <a href="http://www.hiren.info/pages/bios-boot-cdrom"
target="_blank">boot from CD</a> before the hard disk. On booting from the CD, the
first screen you'll see is the boot options screen below.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/1.png" border="0" alt="boot options"
width="384" height= "288"></p>

<p>Just hit <tt>Enter</tt>, sit back, and watch the pretty boot splash as Linux Mint
starts up. When everything is loaded, you'll be greeted by a very attractive desktop
that can only be appropriately described as <em>mint</em>! Have a look.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/2.png" border="0" alt="desktop screenshot"
width="600" height="450"></p>

<p>Linux Mint is a Live CD. This means that it boots into a functional OS that runs
entirely from the CD. And while in this state you can use it without making any
changes to you hard disk. The disadvantage is that you cannot make permanent changes.
Each time you reboot all changes are lost.  Also, depending on the amount of RAM you
have the Live CD is slower than an OS installed on the hard disk. So you can play
around with it as a Live CD if you are just trying to see what Linux Mint is all
about. But we're not here to play around, we're here to dig into the real stuff! See
the Linux Mint icon on the desktop labeled <tt>Install</tt>? Double click it and
we'll be on our way with the installation.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/3.png" border="0" alt="step one of
installation" width= "600" height="450"></p>

<p>Now, the installation dialog pops up. The first thing I noticed is where it says
'Step 1 of 6' on the bottom left. 6 steps?! Is that how easy installing Linux has
become? You bet it is! If we were <em>not</em> going for a dual boot setup, any sort
of guide would be totally irrelevant. But don't worry - setting up the dual boot isn't
hard either.</p>

<p> Back on track - the first screen is self-explanatory. Choose the language you want
for your final system and click <tt>Forward</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/4.png" border="0" alt="step two of
installation" width= "600" height="450"></p>

<p>The second step is just as easy as the first: simply choose your time zone from the
drop-down list. Optionally, you may click on your region in the world map, and the map will zoom
in allowing you to select your city directly. Then click <tt>Forward</tt> again.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/5.png" border="0" alt="step three of installation" width=
"600" height="450"></p>

<p>Now, it's time choose your keyboard layout. You can test your keys in the field below the lists
(as I have demonstrated). This is so easy... Remind me again, why does this need a guide?</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/6.png" border="0" alt="step four of installation" width=
"600" height="450"></p>

<p>Who are you? No, we don't want a philosophical rant... just enter your full name and the name
you want to use to log in. Enter your password twice, and a name for your machine. The account
created here will be the administrator account with full control of the OS. I will talk about user
accounts at another time. <tt>Forward</tt>...</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/7.png" border="0" alt="step five of installation" width=
"600" height="450"></p>

<p>Guess what: we've reached the 'hard' part - disk partitioning. We don't want to erase the entire
disk, so we choose the second option. We're going to do this manually! <tt>Forward</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/8.png" border="0" alt="partition editor start screen"
width="548" height="443"></p>

<p>This opens the partition editor application. It will scan all your hard disks and display the
present partitions and all their details. If you have more that one physical hard drive, then you
can switch between them using the drop-down menu at the top right. Your master drive is usually
first - i.e., <tt>hda</tt> or <tt>sda</tt>. The slave will be <tt>hdb</tt> or <tt>sdb</tt>. And the
partitions are numbered as <tt>hda1, hda2, hda3</tt> and so on.</p>

<p>If you are attentive, you will notice that my hard disk is divided into three partitions -
<tt>hda1</tt> is my linux-swap partition, <tt>hda2</tt> holds my main installation of Ubuntu Linux
and <tt>hda3</tt> is my test partition which I use to play around with other Linux distributions.
But in this case it is an empty NTFS partition, the <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system" target="_blank">file system</a> which Windows XP uses. I
am not about to delete my Ubuntu partition just so I can show you how to resize an NTFS partition.
So imagine that <tt>hda3</tt> is the partition in which <b>you</b> freed 5GB (or however much) for
Linux at the beginning of this guide. If you are thinking in terms of <tt>C:\, D:\, E:\,</tt> etc.
drives in Windows, there is no direct correlation between that and the Linux <tt>hda1, hda2,
hda3,</tt> etc. naming system. I suggest going by the size of the partitions and the free space
available in each one to know exactly which partition you are going to resize. Right-click on the
partition you wish to resize and select <tt>Resize/Move</tt>. The following dialog will pop up:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/9.png" border="0" alt="resize NTFS partition dialog"
width="420" height="198"></p>

<p>There are a number of ways you can define how you want to resize your partition.
The easiest way is just to type the number of megabytes you wish to have for Linux
Mint in the last input field where it says 'Free Space Following (MiB)'. For 5GB, you
would enter 5000 there. I have less than 5000 in that field, but I am the teacher
here - I am allowed to cheat! Actually, I am not. The partition editor will not make
any changes until you tell it specifically to do so by clicking the <tt>Apply</tt>
button. So for now, click <tt>Resize</tt>.</p> <p align="center"><img
src="misc/lazar/10.png" border="0" alt="after resizing partition" width= "549"
height="442"></p>

<p>As you can now see, the NTFS partition has been reduced and there is now some
unallocated space after it. This is where Mint is going to live.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Be careful when altering partitions. Make sure you have a backup of all
valuable data and be sure that your computer isn't interrupted when performing the resizing
operation. If you know that the system may hang or is unstable, don't do it or try to use
a fresh or otherwise unused harddisk. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>


<p>Next, you need to create a <em>primary</em> or an <em>extended partition</em>.
This depends on how many partitions you already have on your hard disk and what kind
they are. A hard disk can have a maximum of four <em>primary partitions</em>. If your
partitions are named <tt>hda1</tt> through <tt>hda4</tt>, they are <em>primary
partitions</em>. <tt>hda5</tt> and above are <em>extended partitions</em>. So, if you
have one or two <em>primary partitions</em>, you can create <em>primary
partitions</em>; otherwise, you will will have to create <em>extended
partitions</em>.</p>

<p>Every Linux installation needs a swap partition; it is the equivalent of the
Windows paging file. Think of it as an extension of your computer's RAM. The general
rule is that the size of your swap partition should be the amount of RAM on your
machine multiplied by 1.5. However, nowadays with the size of RAM getting very large,
the size of swap doesn't need to be very big. I would consider 512MB as a maximum for
desktops. Linux Mint recommends a minimum of 256MB. Click on the unallocated space
and then click the <tt>New</tt> button at the top left to create a new partition.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/11.png" border="0" alt="create swap partition"
width= "393" height="202"></p>

<p>Simply type the amount of swap space that you want in the 'New Size (MiB)' field.
As an example, I have 256MB RAM and my swap space partition is 384MB. This much has
been more than adequate for my computing needs. <b>I</b> don't need another swap
partition - Ubuntu and Mint can both use the one I already have. The space for the
swap partition is what I took out of the 5GB earlier when I 'cheated'. Then choose if
it is going to be a <em>primary partition</em> or an <em>extended partition</em>,
as appropriate, from the drop-down menu, and select <tt>linux-swap</tt> from the
other drop-down menu. Click <tt>Add</tt>.</p>

<p>Now we will create the partition where we are going to install the actual OS. Click on the
remaining unallocated space and then click on the <tt>New</tt> button at the top left.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/12.png" border="0" alt="create linux partition" width=
"392" height="202"></p>

<p>Make sure this partition fills the entire unallocated space - the 'Free Space Preceding' and the
'Free Space Following' fields should both be 0 (zero). Again select <em>primary</em> or
<em>extended partition</em> appropriately and choose a file system in the lower drop-down
menu. Linux Mint defaults to <tt>ext3</tt> which is tried and tested. I prefer <tt>reiserfs</tt>
which is newer and has some performance advantages over <tt>ext3</tt>. Take your pick. After all,
that is what Linux is all about - <b>freedom and choice!</b> Go ahead... click <tt>Add</tt>.</p>

<p>Have a look at the pending operations in the partitioning application window;
check and see if your partitions are the way you want them to be. There's no turning
back after this. Take a deep breath and click <tt>Apply</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/13.png" border="0" alt="apply partition changes" width=
"416" height="108"></p>

<p>Oops, wait... a warning pops up... click <tt>Apply</tt> again!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/14.png" border="0" alt="partitioning complete" width=
"355" height="172"></p>

<p>And... success! Click <tt>Close</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/15.png" border="0" alt="aet partition mount points"
width="548" height="441"></p>

<p>Finally, we reach the end of our lengthy step 5 - partition mount points. Verify that the
partition you created for Linux Mint is mounted at <tt>/</tt>, the swap partition as <tt>swap</tt>.
The rest go under the <tt>/media/hd*</tt> mount points according to their partition numbers. I am
not sure if the NTFS partitions are mounted here by default, since I deleted my NTFS partition.
If not, there is a tool to do this later on. Also check that the <tt>/</tt>
and <tt>swap</tt> partitions are marked for reformatting and the rest are <b>not</b>. That's it -
bravo, you are done with partitioning! Click <tt>Forward</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/16.png" border="0" alt="step six of installation" width=
"549" height="442"></p>

<p>Here we are, at the final step! Actually, this is more of a summary of what the
installer will do. The only option here is choosing the location of GRUB, the boot
loader (the first thing you will encounter when you boot your computer.) Don't
change anything here; most likely, it will work just fine as is. Now, bravely click
<tt>Install</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/17.png" border="0"
alt="installing the system" width= "259" height="88"></p>

<p>The installation will take about 20-25 minutes, so you can go do whatever it is
you do when you've got nothing to do. I fixed myself a midnight snack - eggs and
baked beans... No, its not what Linux people eat... It's what lazy people eat. At
least nobody is going to bother me today!</p> <p align="center"><img
src="misc/lazar/18.png" border="0" alt= "installation complete reboot dialog"
width="305" height="170"></p>

<p>And now, we have reached the end of our journey... actually, <em>your</em> journey has just
begun. Just out of curiosity, I actually timed this install. Of course,
this is not the first time for me, but I did do it at a leisurely pace - plus I took some of the screenshots
you see here. From booting with the CD to rebooting took me just under 55 minutes. Not
bad for the so-called 'complicated', 'only-for-geeks' OS. And on top of that, everything worked fine -
from playing mp3 files to websites loaded with Flash. Even this article, including all the image
editing was done on Linux Mint!</p>

<p> If you discover that you need more help with this distro, go over to the <a
href="http://www.linuxmint.com/forum/" target="_blank">Linux Mint forum</a> and the
friendly people there will surely be happy to help.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, go ahead and give that <tt>Restart Now</tt> button a good whack - and enjoy!</p>

<h1>Measuring TCP Congestion Windows</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p> <a href="../135/pfeiffer.html">Last month</a>, I introduced the various
TCP congestion control algorithms your Linux kernel knows about. I also
mentioned a method, using the kernel module <em>tcpprobe</em>, that allows
for measuring the parameters of live TCP connections. Unfortunately, this
module requires the presence of a debugging option in the kernel called
<em>kprobes</em>. By enabling this, you can dynamically break into any
kernel routine and collect debugging and performance information
non-disruptively. This sounded good on first impression - but I decided
that I don't wish to introduce kprobes on every machine I have; it's better
to run less code on servers. Besides, it is not a good idea to run
debugging code in kernels that shouldn't be used for debugging. I had to
look for other mechanisms. After rediscovering the man pages on my
GNU/Linux workstation at home, I found what I was looking for:
<tt>getsockopt()</tt> </p>

<h3>
Ask the kernel, stupid!
</h3>

<p>
The Linux kernel has internal data structures that keep track of active
TCP connections and their parameters. This is required, since most TCP
connections have a long lifetime (long being tens of seconds, minutes, or
even hours). The longer a connection lasts, the more changes on its path
can happen. Other TCP connections might throttle the up- or downlink.
The link might get disconnected, rerouted, or re-established. Packets
might be lost or reordered. All these things have an impact on the TCP
performance, and TCP usually reacts by changing its window size (among
other things we won't look at right now.) Inside an application that
owns a network socket with a live TCP connection, we can always request
the current TCP parameters. The man pages of <tt>getsockopt()</tt> and
<tt>tcp</tt> tell us how to do this - calling <tt>getsockopt()</tt> with
the <tt>TCP_INFO</tt> option fills a memory structure with information
described in <tt>struct tcp_info</tt>, which is defined in
<tt>/usr/include/netinet/tcp.h</tt>. That's great - just what we're looking
for! But how do we collect this information periodically while sending or
receiving data?  </p>

<h3>
Making up a strategy
</h3>

<p>
The man pages refer to C structures and C function calls. I did a lot of
C programming on my Amigas, so I decided to dust off my C skills. Since
the kernel is written in C, and the GNU C Library has everything prepared,
the way to get to our TCP parameters is straightforward.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Prepare a TCP socket by calling <tt>socket()</tt></li>
<li> Bind to a (high, unprivileged) port by using <tt>bind()</tt></li>
<li> Put the port into listen state by utilising <tt>listen()</tt></li>
<li> Wait for an incoming connection by taking advantage of <tt>accept()</tt></li>
<li> Accept <em>n</em> bytes of data by means of <tt>recv()</tt> from data socket</li>
<li> Write out the TCP parameters to a file</li>
<li> Repeat until sender stops sending</li>
<li> Close data socket and return to listening for new connections</li>
</ol>

<p>
Right. This sounds quite complete. By adjusting <em>n</em>, you can
determine how many samples you get. It doesn't make sense to take
multiple samples per TCP packet, which means that you should choose <em>n</em>
above the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) on your connection path. Besides,
if you send streams over the network that contain many megabytes (or
even gigabytes), you might want to reduce the sample rate anyway.  </p>

<p> We design our code so it can be used as a "TCP sink". We don't
want to store all the bytes we read from the network. We just need to
fill a buffer up to a maximum of <em>n</em> bytes, look at the TCP
parameters, and read the next <em>n</em> bytes. The only things we probably
want to save are the parameters. Everything else is fed to the bit
bucket.  </p>

<h3>
Walking through the steps
</h3>

<p>
Let's look at the steps of our strategy with more detail and some code.
I am going to describe the task "codewise", line by line. You will get a
complete sample of the source to play with, at the end.  First, we have to
prepare the socket. Then, we have to bind it to a local address.
Finally, we have to put the socket into the TCP LISTEN state.
</p>

<pre class="code">
tcp_socket = socket( PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP );
if ( tcp_socket == -1 ) {
/* Could not open socket. */
fprintf(stderr,"Could not open TCP socket: %s\n",strerror(errno));
exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
else {
/* Bind to any address on local machine */
server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
server_address.sin_port = htons(opt_port);
memset((void *)&amp;(server_address.sin_zero), '\0', 8);
status = bind( tcp_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;server_address, sizeof(server_address) );
if ( status == 0 ) {
	/* We can now listen for incoming connections. We only allow a backlog of one
	 * connection
	 */
	status = listen( tcp_socket, 1 );
	if ( status != 0 ) {
		/* Cannot listen on socket. */
		fprintf(stderr,"Cannot listen on socket: %s\n",strerror(errno));
		exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
	}
}
else {
	/* Cannot bind to socket. */
	fprintf(stderr,"Cannot bind to socket: %s\n",strerror(errno));
	exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
}
</pre>

<p>
The call to <tt>socket()</tt> specifies that we'd like to have an Internet
(<tt>PF_INET</tt>) stream socket (<tt>SOCK_STREAM</tt>) that speaks TCP
(<tt>IPPROTO_TCP</tt>).  Provided the call succeeds, we prepare a data
structure named <tt>server_address</tt> of the type <tt>struct
sockaddr_in</tt>, which tells the kernel the address and the port to which
we wish to bind the socket. We choose all available addresses by using
<tt>INADDR_ANY</tt>, and we'd like to bind on the port stored in the
<tt>opt_port</tt> variable. (The full source handles the options; I left it
out in this piece of code.) Be careful when doing network programming!
Addresses and ports have a defined network and host byte order. This means
that certain bytes might need to be swapped - or not - before putting them
from the host side into network data structures and vice-versa. The
function <tt>htons()</tt> converts the unsigned short integer TCP port from
host byte order to network byte order. If you look up its man page, you
will see that there are other functions for byte order conversion.  </p>

<p>
Now we can call the <tt>bind()</tt> function. We need to provide the TCP
socket it should act on, and a pointer to a memory region of type
<tt>struct sockaddr</tt>, along with the length of the memory region.
<tt>server_address</tt> is the structure we filled for exactly these
purposes.  The function call may seem a bit complicated because of the
pointer and the size of the structure - but as long as we make sure that the
content of <tt>server_address</tt> is filled with correct values,
<tt>bind()</tt> won't choke on it.  </p>

<p> If the binding succeeds, we can put the socket into the listening
state.  This is done by a simple call to the <tt>listen()</tt> function.
When listening for connections, you can tell the kernel how many
connections it should keep in the queue for processing. As of kernel 2.2,
this queue consists of completely established sockets waiting to be
accepted. Since we don't need to deal with performance issues and multiple
connections, we choose 1; we'll let other people worry about the design of
a high-performance and multi-threaded TCP sink. After these three steps,
our code is ready to accept and process data streams.  </p>

<pre class="code">
client_length = sizeof(client_address);
tcp_work_socket = accept( tcp_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&amp;client_address, &amp;client_length );
</pre>

<p>
The call to <tt>accept()</tt> makes our code wait until a connection is
received.  <tt>client_address</tt> is of the same type as
<tt>server_address</tt> was, earlier. It is a storage space for the address
of the client that is talking to us. <tt>accept()</tt> fills out the
details as soon as a client connects. In addition, the function returns
an identifier of the socket that holds the conversation with our client.
Keep in mind that our listening socket will always listen for incoming
connections! Every connection we accept creates a new socket; that's why
we use the variable <tt>tcp_work_socket</tt> for this. All we need to do
now is to read incoming data. (We could also write "to the other side"
and test bidirectional data flow, if we wanted to.)  </p>

<p> Our little strategy above missed (or implied, as a matter of
perspective) a crucial point. Sampling the TCP parameters is fine, but we
need to take another reference as well. We need something that says "we got
the parameters at a certain time or at a certain point".  This means we
have to measure the time elapsed since the connection started. We could use
the number of bytes received, but usually it is better to use the elapsed
time. Measuring time in C on various platforms deserves an article on its
own; fortunately we are bound to Linux (because we want to use the TCP_INFO
option of <tt>getsockopt()</tt>, and this is not portable), and can expect
to get time resolution in microseconds. In order to make time management
easier, we define two functions: <tt>get_now()</tt> and
<tt>time_to_seconds()</tt>.
</p>

<pre class="code">
/* Get current time. */
void get_now( struct timeval *time, unsigned short debug ) {
if ( gettimeofday( time, NULL ) != 0 ) {
	fprintf(stderr,"Can't get current time.\n");
}
return;
}

/* Convert "struct timeval" to fractional seconds. */
double time_to_seconds ( struct timeval *tstart, struct timeval *tfinish ) {
double t;

t = (tfinish-&gt;tv_sec - tstart-&gt;tv_sec) + (tfinish-&gt;tv_usec - tstart-&gt;tv_usec) / 1e6;
return t;
}
</pre>

<p>
<tt>get_now()</tt> is our stopwatch button, and retrieves the current
time by calling <tt>gettimeofday()</tt> and storing it into a memory
structure. The second function <tt>time_to_seconds()</tt> calculates the
difference of two time value structures, and converts it into fractional
seconds. We have to do that ourselves, since the GNU C Library doesn't
provide any functions to do fancy date and time calculations. Other
libraries could help us out, but I'd like to stick to basic methods and
basic tools. We have other things to do in our code than to worry about
fancy functions. You may have noticed the slightly unused function
parameter <tt>debug</tt> in <tt>get_now()</tt>. I'll explain later what
it is for (it's a feature, not a bug).  </p>

<p>
Now, we start our main loop. We take the time, read the stream buffer by
buffer, query the socket and write the parameters to a file. Here's the
code.
</p>

<pre class="code">
get_now( &amp;time_start, opt_debug );
while ( (recv_bytes = recv( tcp_work_socket, tcp_buffer, opt_buffer, 0 ) ) &gt; 0 ) {
/* Measure time in order to create time intervals. */
get_now( &amp;time_now, opt_debug );
/* Fill tcp_info structure with data */
tcp_info_length = sizeof(tcp_info);
if ( getsockopt( tcp_work_socket, SOL_TCP, TCP_INFO, (void *)&amp;tcp_info, &amp;tcp_info_length ) == 0 ) {
	fprintf(statistics,"%.6f %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u %u\n",
			time_to_seconds( &amp;time_start, &amp;time_now ),
			tcp_info.tcpi_last_data_sent,
			tcp_info.tcpi_last_data_recv,
			tcp_info.tcpi_snd_cwnd,
			tcp_info.tcpi_snd_ssthresh,
			tcp_info.tcpi_rcv_ssthresh,
			tcp_info.tcpi_rtt,
			tcp_info.tcpi_rttvar,
			tcp_info.tcpi_unacked,
			tcp_info.tcpi_sacked,
			tcp_info.tcpi_lost,
			tcp_info.tcpi_retrans,
			tcp_info.tcpi_fackets
		   );
	if ( fflush(statistics) != 0 ) {
		fprintf(stderr, "Cannot flush buffers: %s\n", strerror(errno) );
	}
}
}
close(tcp_work_socket);
</pre>

<p>
First, we take the time to mark the start of the transmission. It gets
stored in <tt>time_start</tt>, which we use later for calculating
relative time. The <tt>while</tt> loop is our main loop. We call
<tt>recv()</tt>, and fill our buffer <tt>tcp_buffer</tt> with a maximum
of <tt>opt_buffer</tt> bytes. After the buffer is full, we take the time
again. Finally, we call the function <tt>getsockopt()</tt> and request
that a memory region of type <tt>struct tcp_info</tt> be filled with
parameter data from the live stream. The function works in a fashion
similar to that of <tt>bind()</tt>. You have to have a piece of memory
ready, indicate its size, give a request code (such as
<tt>TCP_INFO</tt>), and <tt>getsockopt()</tt> will copy everything to the
memory region indicated by the supplied pointer. If the function returns
success, we can access the values in <tt>tcp_info</tt>.  You can look up
the content of a <tt>struct tcp_info</tt> structure by viewing
<tt>/usr/include/netinet/tcp.h</tt>. For your convenience, I have a copy
of the definition right here:
</p>

<pre class="code">
struct tcp_info
{
u_int8_t	tcpi_state;
u_int8_t	tcpi_ca_state;
u_int8_t	tcpi_retransmits;

u_int32_t	tcpi_snd_cwnd;
u_int32_t	tcpi_advmss;
u_int32_t	tcpi_reordering;
};
</pre>

<p>
The first part consists of administrative information such as state,
retransmits, keepalive probes, and options. There's more, and I went
through the Linux kernel code to discover where the values come from and
what they mean. The best documentation you can get is to look at your
kernel's source at <tt>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/net/ipv4/tcp.c</tt>
and see how the <tt>tcp_info</tt> is filled. Look for the
<tt>tcp_get_info()</tt> function inside, and look up the definition of
<tt>struct tcp_sock</tt> in <tt>/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/net/tcp.h</tt>. Most of the data is copied from this
structure.  Fortunately, we don't need everything. The main objective is
to get the congestion window.  If you look at the metrics section, you
can see some interesting values. <tt>tcpi_rtt</tt> and
<tt>tcpi_rttvar</tt> are the Round Trip Time (RTT), and its smoothed mean
deviation maximum measured in microseconds. The values
<tt>tcpi_rcv_ssthresh</tt> and <tt>tcpi_snd_ssthresh</tt> are the slow
start size threshold for sending and receiving. Both can be changed
dynamically during transmission and reception of data, and put limits on
the window sizes.  <tt>tcpi_snd_cwnd</tt> is the sending congestion
window. <tt>tcpi_advmss</tt> is the advertised Maximum Segment Size
(MSS). <tt>tcpi_reordering</tt> indicates the amount of reordering. 
(I didn't quite figure out the units and values used to indicate
reordering, but I found that RFC 4737 defines a packet reordering
metric; maybe it has something to do with it.)  </p>

<p>
We have to keep in mind that TCP can be used to transport data
bidirectionally. Our TCP sink will only receive data. In this case, we
should expect that only a part of the parameters will change. The values
we want to extract are written to a file descriptor <tt>statistics</tt>
by a call to <tt>fprintf()</tt>. The format string and the list of
arguments defines what will be written to the statistics log file. You
can select whatever values you want, and have a look at the output when
shooting streams at our sink.  </p>

<h3>
The whole source
</h3>

<p> The whole source is a bit longer, since I wanted to build a daemon that
listens on a socket, receives data, and adds all extracted statistics to a
log file. It marks the start and the end of data connections, so that it is
easier to parse the log and plot the results. I also added option parsing,
which is better suited for changing port number, filename, and the like.
The daemon has an option for the debug level as well: if the debug level is
greater than 0, the daemon doesn't fork and prints debug messages to
<tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt> in case something goes wrong. You can
download the source <a href="misc/pfeiffer/tcpsnoop.c">tcpsnoop.c</a>, a
little header file <a href="misc/pfeiffer/tcpsnoop.h">tcpsnoop.h</a> and a
minimalistic <a href="misc/pfeiffer/Makefile">Makefile</a>. All you need is
the GNU C Compiler and the <tt>make</tt> utility. After you have compiled
the code (running <tt>make</tt> in the directory where you save the above
files should do the trick), the binary's options are as follows.
</p>

<pre>
luchs@nightfall:~$ ./tcpsnoop -h
Usage: tcpsnoop [-d] [-D debuglevel] [-f filename] [-h] [-p tcpport] [-b buffersize]
luchs@nightfall:~$ 
</pre>

<p>
The presence of <tt>-d</tt> tells the program to enter daemon mode.
<tt>-D</tt> sets the debug level.  Setting a debug level will
automatically disable daemon mode. <tt>-f</tt> lets you define a file to
write to. <tt>-p</tt> determines the TCP port (default is 42237, can be
changed by editing <tt>tcpsnoop.h</tt>). <tt>-b</tt> sets the size of
the buffer (defaults to 1500 bytes). Daemon mode can be exited by
sending a signal. My signal handlers could probably look a lot better,
but feel free to turn the sample code into a mean and efficient piece of
software.  </p>

<h3>
Test driving
</h3>

<p>
Now let's see if it works or segfaults. We can test the program by using
127.0.0.1. This is a bit of a boring experience, since we have big
bandwidth and minimal RTT. You'll see that the threshold for the
receiving window will skyrocket very quickly. Anyway, we need a listener
process.  We issue the following command on the receiver:
</p>

<pre>
luchs@receiver:~$ ./tcpsnoop -d -f /tmp/logfile.dat -p 23000 -b 4096
</pre>

<p>
We listen on port 23000 for incoming connections, and write every 4096
bytes a line with the parameters of the connection to the file
<tt>logfile.dat</tt>. Note that <tt>tcpsnoop</tt> always appends data,
so you won't overwrite old data.  </p>

<p>
On the sender's side, you need a simple tool that pipes data to a TCP
socket. A combination of <tt>cat</tt>, a suitable file, and
<tt>netcat</tt> will do nicely. 
</p>

<pre>
luchs@sender:~$ cat big_file.pdf | nc receiver.example.net -w 5 23000
</pre>

<p>
A file is piped to <tt>netcat</tt>, which in turn connects to our
receiver on port 23000 and delivers the data. The option <tt>-w</tt>
sets a timeout for the connection. <tt>netcat</tt> stops reading after 5
seconds. (Remember, TCP is bidirectional, leaving <tt>-w</tt> out would
make <tt>netcat</tt> wait longer for data coming from the receiver.)
Make sure your disk is faster than your network, or preload the file. We
want to look at network performance, not at slow disks. While the stream
is running our code writes the parameters of the connection to the log
file.  The logged data should look similar to this:
</p>

<p>
As you can see, only the receiving slow start threshold is changing. You
can now use any tool you want, in order to display the data in another
format. I used <tt>gnuplot</tt> to create two diagrams.  Both show the
transmission of a 7.5 MB PDF file through a VPN tunnel over a 512
kbit/s line with 20ms latency. Just to see if it makes any difference, I
used three congestions algorithms on the sender side (Low Priority, Veno
and Westwood+). I did one transfer per algorithm, one without traffic on
the link, and one while surfing with my browser on multiple news pages.
The graphs are marked with <em>noconcurrent</em> and
<em>browserbackground</em>, respectively.<br> <img border="0"
src="misc/pfeiffer/lp_veno_westwood_no_background.png" width="800"
height="566" alt="graph1" /> <img border="0"
src="misc/pfeiffer/lp_veno_westwood_background.png" width="800"
height="566" alt="graph2" /><br> <strong>Caution!</strong> These graphs carry no
meaning. They just say that uploading something while a link is utilised
takes longer than on a link without any load. They also say that
inserting different congestion algorithm modules into the kernel leads
to different behaviour. We already knew that. The sole purpose of this
data is to test drive the code we just wrote, nothing more, nothing
less. So the only valid interpretation is "It works!" (or "It seems to
work!" if you believe in bugs). Hooray!  </p>

<p>
You might wish to issue 
</p>

<pre>
echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_no_metrics_save
</pre>

<p>
on both machines to prevent the kernel from storing metric information
between different TCP sessions.  This is useful for repeated tests from
the same IP addresses.  </p>

<h3>
Conclusions
</h3>

<p>
I wrote this article as a follow up to my overview of the different
Linux TCP congestions algorithm modules. My only intention was to find
out what these algorithms are for and what they do. The outcome was much
more than I expected. Data transmissions over networks create a wealth
of aspects regarding performance and reliability. I am amazed by the
efforts the kernel developers put into the code of the Linux TCP state
machine. Few people notice this, when they run their servers and
workstations with default values that just work because of all the
things that were put into the kernel code. I hope that you have more
than enough starting points to read about what I presented.  You also
have some pre-alpha code to play with. Now that we have a TCP sink, we
could code the sender's side as well, and record the real congestion
window and the sender's threshold. We will do that, but that's a job for
one of the next issues of <em>Linux Gazette</em>.  </p>

<p>
Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with several KDE developers.
Benjamin Reed, Jaroslaw Staniek, and Ralf Habacker are three of the many
talented developers working on porting KDE to Mac OS/X and Windows.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<em>Can you tell me about the technical design of the Mac and
Windows ports?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> KDE/Windows should really be considered as 
"KDElibs/Windows and some KDE applications on Windows".
Porting applications to KDE/Windows typically just means making KDE
libraries and the build system more "portable". The source
code of the applications is largely the same. As an example, I can
mention that Kexi's source code, which I develop on Windows, is often
committed to SVN without prior checking on other platforms. Then, I
just update another copy of the same source code from SVN on Linux,
and recompile. There are few, if any, and easily fixable problems with
this method, usually related to difference between compilers. You get
the idea; this is how portable development works.
</p>

<p>
There is one assumption many of the developers agree on: we re-use
as much of the native interface as possible. However, we do not
perform any forks that would make ported applications non-standard
in terms of file formats or protocols. I personally tend to give up
on a given functionality (and look for a replacement) rather than go
with using a proprietary technology. A small example of this is my
use of the 'mdbtools' project to access the MS Access file
format, instead of using native Windows DAO/ADO API. This is not even
a matter of licensing (because many APIs are considered 
"system-level" technology), but more about a strategy. Other
examples of re-using lower-level layers are multimedia frameworks. An
example of an existing facility that should not be replaced in a 
typical installation is the explorer.exe desktop shell.
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin:</b> For the OS/X port, right now there is
no specific "technical design" beyond what KDE provides in
general, and as far as the technical challenges involved, there is
not a lot going forward that isn't a general challenge to the KDE
codebase. I know that's not much of an answer, so I need to back up a
little into the history of it.
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, Sam Magnuson (a Trolltech employee) did a bunch
of work to rip out the X11-related code in the KDE3 codebase and got
it to compile against Qt/Mac 3.x. I picked up where he left off, and
did a lot of work trying to clean up the patches, make it look a
little nicer, etc. Around the same time, the Windows folks had
started working on cleaning things up on their side. Time went by,
and the Mac port stagnated, mostly because I'm not really much of a
C++ coder, and I'd hit the limit of what I was able to do on my own.
No one else really had the time to work on it with me (although there
was certainly still a lot of interest.) Most of my porting time went
into maintaining other Fink packages, and keeping the Fink KDE/X11
port up-to-date and working smoothly. In that time, the Windows folks
did a lot of <strong>awesome</strong> work on committing bits of my and Sam
Magnuson's work, along with a ton of their own, cleaning up the code,
removing X11-isms, etc.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to KDE4, I talked with various folks in #kde-devel,
off and on, about wanting to pick up the Mac port again, and about the
feasibility of really making a go at it.  One of the things that
really made the port possible was the move to Qt4, and a real
dedication on the part of the KDE core folks to try to use official
Qt APIs for things that had been hacked-around at the X11 level in
KDE3 (and a commitment from Trolltech to add proper APIs for things
that required hacks before.) In addition, there were a lot of awful
hacks that needed to be done to
the existing autotools-based build system (automake, autoconf,
libtool) to make things even build on OS/X against frameworks. 

</p>

<p>
The move to the SCons build system made building on Mac feasible,
and the subsequent switch to CMake made it easy: CMake has had a very
large role in making it simple (and sane) to make KDE GUI and console
applications cross-platform without a lot of work on the developers'
part. Mac OS/X has a lot of quirks at the compiler and linker level
that make it hard to understand building (especially dynamic-loading)
if you come only from a Linux point of view. CMake makes that
completely transparent. A lot of the ease of porting now comes from
Alexander Neundorf's awesome work getting KDE to build with CMake.
</p>

<p>
So, to make a long story short, there used to be a lot of
technical code hurdles to getting KDE to build on non-X11, but many
of those were hashed out late in the 3.5 cycle, and early in the 4.0
cycle, thanks to the work of a lot of talented and dedicated people.
At this point, there are only a few small platform-related issues for
the Mac port, and the rest is really just a matter of keeping up with
KDE4 development and fixing small problems before they snowball into
big ones.
</p>

<p>
<em>What were some of the technical challenges facing the
developers?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> The integration with facilities
existing on the target platform and the look and feel.
</p>

<p>
There is some probability that in special cases platform-dependent
looks will be configured. Think about toolbars on Mac and Windows, as
well as features related to window management (full screen, etc.)
Thanks to our API, KDElibs tend to provide well-defined helpers that
behave appropriately for every given environment. Many of these
facilities are also delivered by Qt - namely, the accessibility API -
so KDE developers can focus on preparing higher-level facilities.
</p>

<p>
<em>What were some of the technical requirements for building
KDE on Windows?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> On Windows, many dependencies are not
considered as "system" libraries, so these are delivered
within the so-called KDE development environment. The environment is
needed only for developers, not users. The general rule here is that
we try to have the environment as self-contained as possible, to make
new developers' lives easier. There are two main compilers used on
Windows: 'gcc' and MS Visual C++, aka 'msvc'. Since C++ does not define
de-facto binary compatibility between compiles from various vendors,
when distributing binaries, both targets will be (probably)
distributed together.
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> <a
href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> is used as a
high-level build system for KDE4, on top of compilers and particular
environments. This is a positive change, since for KDE3/Windows Qt's
'qmake' was used, without any chances for using advanced and automated
configuration checks. Now, for instance, if you need MySQL support
in your application, it is possible to declare this fact once in your
CMake build file, and the build system will try to find all
the needed facilities for this requirement.
</p>

<p>
KDE's relationships with Trolltech is well known. In version 4,
KDE is even more a place where community and companies meet for
mutual benefit. CMake is an advanced buildsystem delivered by Kitware,
Inc. and <a
href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Sponsors.html">others</a>.
In fact, it's not only delivered as-is but there are also CMake
releases with many features needed, especially with a large project like
KDE.
</p>

<p>
<em>Were there any special requirements for Mac OS/X?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin:</b> For Mac OS/X, nothing all that special
other than XCode (Apple's GCC compiler set). KDE has a lot of
dependencies to get the most out of it, so if you don't want to spend
days compiling libpng, dbus, etc., then you probably want to install
my Qt4 and "kdesupport" packages on the Web site. I provide
pre-made packages, which include headers and dev libraries, so that you
can pretty much just jump in compiling KDE SVN if you'd like.
</p>

<p>
<em>What is the distribution strategy?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> On Windows, there is an installer that
installs the development environment. In the end, there will be a
choice between installing just the runtime for users and
runtime+development files for developers. You can get more information
at <a href="http://lists.kde.org/?t=116778440900002&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">KDE
Lists</a>.  </p>

<p>
On Mac OS/X, right now I'm putting together Apple Installer packages,
with everything self-contained in '/opt' to avoid getting in the way of
other software. Eventually, my goal is to also provide KDE4 through
Fink, but I'm not going to bother doing so until we get closer to a beta
quality, at the least, but even so I will probably continue creating the
installer packages. I have it pretty much automated, and it provides a
really easy way to just drop a running KDE4 setup on a system without
any external dependencies.  </p>

</div>

<p>
<em>What are the timeline, support options, and future
development going forward?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> The timeline for the KDE/Windows target
is dependent on KDE4's plans. In general, porting efforts and updates
provided try to follow the mainstream development, i.e., the one for
Unix target. There are already people (including me) interested in
commercial development using the development facilities of KDE on
Windows. There is the KDE ISV subproject in development. There is no
doubt the user base is growing, and we now have an active community
around this target, which helps the KDE Project in general.
</p>

<p>
The design covers two steps:
</p>

<p>
1. KDE on Windows uses current code and similar packaging as on
Unix and to have KDE applications as they are, with a minimum of
required porting effort. This is to show people how it works and to
get Windows in contact with KDE applications. In this step, the basic
differences between Unix and Windows must be fixed (fork/exec and
Unix domain sockets not available on Windows, no undefined symbols in
shared libraries possible, different file path syntax, etc.)
</p>

<p>
2. When enough developers are available, they could make partial
redesigns of KDE internals to use specific Windows features like
named pipes for faster IPC, or be able to have standalone applications -
for example, Konqueror or Kontact/Kmail - not require many additional 
background processes running, as is the case now. I can imagine having a
redesigned klauncher, kded and kioslaves included into a standalone
application; the latter may be using threads or something similar.
Jaruslav has gone already this way with Kexi.  </p>

<p>
<em>Are there more features and ideas in the works?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Ralf Habacker:</b> The current implementation of
KDE is designed in a Unix-specific way, which is partially different
from the Windows way. Examples for this are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Process creation uses the Unix way (fork and exec).
It isn't available on Windows, so this difference requires a
redesign of the related parts.
<li> It's missing Windows API counterparts.
<li> KDE uses Unix domain sockets for high-speed data transfer between
the kioslave slaves and their parent processes, and for the communication
to/from the dbus daemon. On Windows, there are no Unix domain sockets.
They could be emulated by TCP sockets, at the cost of lower
bandwidth and additional patches to deal with Unix domain socket
files exchanged between processes.
</ul>

<p>
There are different application interfaces. Windows, for example,
has a TCP socket stack similar to the Unix one, but it differs in
some areas, which makes porting harder. Windows named pipes have a
completely different API, which required a partial redesign of KDE
code.
</p>

<p>
After Qt4/GPL was released, our next step was clear: build a
native kdelibs4 on Windows. The main problem is that we're too few
people with too much work (starting with a native dbus implementation,
and ending with a working KDE app on Windows, to show others that we are
really moving forward). Because of this, I'm happy for any publicity
to get new developers, which could help because we're all doing this
in our spare time.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Some of the developers working on the Windows port are Peter
K&uuml;mmel, Holger Schr&ouml;der and Christian Ehrlicher.  On the
Mac side, there are Derek Ditch, Alexander Neuendorf, Marijn
Kruisselbrink and Tanner Lovelace, just to name a few. There are many
more who have contributed in the past that were integral in making
these projects a success. All the hard work they have done will have
the cumulative effect of exponentially increasing the number of
people who get exposed to and use Open Source Software.
</p>

<p>
I believe that KDE porting their Desktop Environment to Mac OS/X and
Windows to be a watershed moment for Open Source Software. By and
large, people are resistant to change, and in all my interactions with
strangers, friends, and family, I have learned creative ways to
describe what using Linux is like, or how to run it from a liveCD or
how to install it on a PC. I have learned to stay away from the word
"<em>change</em>", and use the word "<strong>add</strong>" instead.
</p>

<p>
It is much easier to convince someone to try Open Source Software
if you describe it as "adding" something to his/her computer,
rather than "changing" it. Many who read this do not look
at "changing" a computer with apprehension or fear, but we are not
in the majority. If "adding" KDE to a Mac or Windows
machine gets millions of people who otherwise would not try OSS,
then so be it. I am convinced that once a person tries OSS, he/she will
get hooked on it. It is easier than starting smoking. <img
src="../gx/smile.png" alt=";-)" />
</p>

<p>
From the day I first downloaded Firefox, my addiction and/or love
affair with OSS has flourished unabated. It started with Firefox and
progressed into using only FOSS within two years. Why? Because I
<strong>chose</strong> to. After using it every day and comparing
it to proprietary software, it was a "no-brainer" to switch
to Open Source Software entirely. There was no loss in quality of
applications, security, and functionality on my machine. There was a
significant increase in the quality and choice of applications I
could use, and by switching to Linux, my computer became a bank vault
compared to whatever it was running Windows. How did all this happen?
I started using <strong>one</strong> program, got hooked, and never
looked back.
</p>

<p>
Soon, everyone who owns a computer will be able to try and use OSS,
and all they will have to do is "add" software to their
computer. That shouldn't be too hard; people add software to their
computers every day, right? So, lets say that 25 to 50 million people
who had never tried OSS before, try it because all they have to do is
"add" some software to their computers. Those of you who
have surfed before will know what I mean when I say this: you're lying
on your board and you look out into the ocean and see a bulge in the
water and you think to yourself "Is that the next big wave
coming in?" The answer is yes - this is indeed the next big wave coming
in.

<h1>Interview: Orv Beach, Publicity Chair/SCaLE (Southern California Linux Expo)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/tanaka-okopnik.html">Kat Tanaka Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p class="editorial">
Our Mailbag Editor, Kat Tanaka Okopnik, caught up with Orv while attending
SCaLE and instantly decided that this cheerful, likeable, energetic fellow
deserved to be lightly grilled and served up to our readers. After an
exchange of emails at 50 paces (or 3000 miles - it was rather difficult to
tell from the ping times), the following interview came into being.
<p>

<p class="editorial">
Seriously, though - Kat and I attended SCaLE and enjoyed it very much; Orv
and his fellow Linuxers did an excellent job of getting everything set up,
and the event went off as smoothly as any of the larger Linux cons that
I've attended in the past. Be sure to join Orv and friends next year, as
they spin up SCaLE 6x; if it's anything similar to the way SCaLE 5x turned
out, it'll be a "don't miss" event.
<br>
 -- Ben Okopnik
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>What makes SCaLE different from other conferences?</em>
</p>
   
<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: It's certainly different from LinuxWorld Expo, which is almost 
completely commercial. That's OK - that's their focus.  But SCaLE is 
focused on educating the end user. And in fact, that's in our mission 
statement. We try to cover a broad range of topics of interest to the 
Open Source software user, be they home user or system administrator.
</p>

<p>
To be fair, there other other non-commercial conferences, and their number
is growing:  Along the same vein as SCaLE are the Ohio Linux Fest
(<a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/">http://www.ohiolinux.org/</a>) and
LinuxFest Northwest (<a href="http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/">http://www.linuxfestnorthwest.org/</a>).
Obviously these regional conferences are filling a need!
</p>


<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>Who is (are) SCaLE's primary audience? Who should attend SCaLE as their primary or only conference?</em>
</p>
   
<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: To be honest, it's all over the map. We get everyone from corporate IT 
guys clear down to high school students - and they're all equally 
valuable; the computer club student of today will be an IT 
direction-influencer in four or five years. We believe that SCaLE is 
equally valuable to each attendee. It's worked out that we've had a 
"newbie" session track on alternate years recently, and those sessions 
have been some of the most heavily attended at SCaLE. So, obviously we 
have an attraction to the newcomer to Linux and Open Source Software.
</p>

<p>
We frequently have developers from the Open Source community attend SCaLE,
too. Their talks about what's coming up lets attendees get a glimpse of 
the future in Open Source computing, and that's very exciting.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>How did you get involved with SCaLE?</em>
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: I've belonged to SCLUG (the Simi-Conejo Linux Users Group, in western 
Ventura County, California), since about 1998.  As the Information 
Systems Manager at the Nortel facility in Simi Valley, I was able to 
offer the facility as a meeting place for SCLUG.  In 1999, Gareth 
Greenaway, one of the founders of SCLUG, suggested that SCLUG host a 
"LUGFest" which would be an event where users or groups could 
demonstrate some aspect of Open Source software.  The first LUGFest was 
held one afternoon in the Nortel Simi Valley cafeteria.  It had about 
ten demonstrations and drew about 100 people.  In spite of those 
semingly small numbers, SCLUG knew they were onto something.  LUGFests 
were held every 6 months thereafter, and LUGFest IV held over two days, 
drew almost 400 people.  Every meeting room in the Nortel facility was 
booked for a seminars, and about a dozen vendors actually attended.
</p>

<p>
Shortly thereafter Nortel, being a pioneer in the dot-com crash, closed 
their Simi Valley facility.  SCLUG found an alternate place to meet, 
but it brought the LUGFests to an end.
</p>

<p>
However, the LUG members realized that the LUGFests filled a need, a hunger 
for more information about Open Source software, and were determined to 
replace them with something equivalent.  Discussions with other LUGs 
resulted in a collaboration of SCLUG, the UCLA LUG and the USC LUG.  
That led to SCaLE 1, which was held in USC's Davidson Conference Center 
in November of 2002.  It was a one day affair, with 26 booths, and drew 
400 people.
</p>

<p>
Growth in size and attendance has been steady year over year.  SCaLEs 2x 
and 3x were held at the Los Angeles Convention Center.  SCaLE 4x was 
held at the Radisson hotel down the street from LAX.  The recently held 
SCaLE 5x had an expo floor 35% larger than that of S4X, and 25% more 
booths. It had 69 exhibitors' booths, and resulted in over 1300 badges 
being printed (including vendors and exhibitors), compared to 900 the 
year before.  That growth reflects the increasing popularity and use of 
Open Source software.
</p>
    
<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>What's the most unexpected thing about SCaLE?</em>
</p>
       
<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: How far people will come to participate in a regional computer show. We 
have speakers come from all over the globe, and an estimated 15% of our 
guests come from outside of California.
</p>
    
<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>What was new this year at SCaLE? Are you planning to repeat it?</em>
</p>
       
<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: We're always trying new things. We were at a new location this 
year, necessitated by our growth. We tried vendor showcases this year.  
They was not especially successful, so we'll consider whether we'll 
continue them or not. This year we also had wireless in the speaker 
rooms, which was very popular.  We also "ruggedized" the network on the 
Expo floor, making it more resilient to adverse network conditions.  
That was very successful. We're always on the lookout for things that 
will improve the attendee experience.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>What makes an in-person gathering like SCaLE different from a net.conference?</em>
</p>
  
<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: In spite of all the high-tech ways to communicate, face-to-face 
communication remains a very human, satisfying method of transferring 
information. The Expo provides an effective way for people to gain 
information they wanted, and also information they didn't know they 
needed (the serendipity thing - "I didn't realize there were three Open 
Source network management packages!")
</p>

<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>What surprises people about SCaLE?</em>
</p>
       
<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: Several things; we get a number of comments every year from people like, 
"Wow, I didn't realize there was a Linux show in Los Angeles", in spite 
of this being our fifth year and in spite of our best PR efforts. 
Another thing that surprises some, mostly vendors, is that SCaLE is run 
with an all-volunteer staff.
</p>
    
<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>What was your favorite SCaLE moment?</em>
</p>
         
<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: Although we continually work to reduce the wait times at Registration 
Saturday morning, seeing 60 people line up a half hour before opening is 
very satisfying. It's also extremely satisfying seeing members of the 
Open Source community step up and help put SCaLE on; it wouldn't be 
the success it is without the several dozen volunteers that step up 
every year to assist.
</p>
    
<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>What's the best thing about being at SCaLE?</em>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: Seeing the energy and excitement on the Expo floor.  Because it's held 
on a weekend, people who attend SCaLE are they because they WANT to be 
there.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Kat</strong>: <em>What do you see SCaLE doing for next year's Expo?</em>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Orv</strong>: The Friday mini-conferences have worked out very well the last couple of
years.  While the chairs haven't decided all the details, we've pretty much
decided that SCaLE will be a three-day event from here on out. The Friday
events haven't been nailed down for sure yet, but we may reprise an
expanded healthcare mini-conference, since it was so successful this year.
We're also considering Open Source in education as a valuable topic for the
community.  Whether it will be a Friday mini-conference, a specific session
track on the weekend, or something else has yet to be decided.
</p>
    
<p>
In closing, we'd like to thank the local Open Source community for their 
support.  Without them, SCaLE couldn't happen; they've made it the 
success it's become. Open Source software in Southern California is 
alive and well!

<em>
<p>
Samuel Kotel Bisbee-vonKaufmann was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA
area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age
of 10, Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science
and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a
href="http://www.oftc.org">http://www.oftc.org</a>), had his first article
published, and became more involved in various communities and projects.
</p>

<p>
Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?
</p>

<p>
Sam prefers programming in C++ and Bash, is fluent in Java and PHP, and while
he can work in Perl, he hates it. If you would like to know more then feel free
to ask.

Linux Genuine Advantage[tm] is an exciting and mandatory new way
for you to place your computer under the remote control of an untrusted third party!
 
According to an independent study conducted by some scientists, many users of Linux
are running non-Genuine versions of their operating system. This puts them
at the disadvantage of having their computers work normally, without periodically
phoning home unannounced to see if it's OK for their computer to continue functioning.
These users are also missing out on the Advantage of paying ongoing
licensing fees to ensure their computer keeps operating properly.
 
To remedy this, we have created a new program available as a required free
download: Linux Genuine Advantage[tm].

I am passing this on to you because it definitely works, and we could all use a little more calmness in our lives. By following simple advice heard on the Dr. Phil show, you too can find inner peace. 
</p>

<p>
Dr. Phil proclaimed, "The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you have started and have never finished." So, I looked around my house to see all the things I started and hadn't finished, and before leaving the house this morning, I finished off a bottle of Merlot, a bottle of White Zinfandel, a bottle of bailey's Irish Cream, a bottle of Kahlua, a package of Oreos, the remainder of my old Prozac prescription, the rest of the cheesecake, some Doritos and a box of chocolates. You have no idea how freaking good I feel. Please pass this on to those whom you think might be in need of inner peace.

<h3>Happy Lupercalia</h3>
<p>
<b>Rick Moen [rick at linuxmafia.com]</b><br />

</p>

<p>
An estimated one billion greeting cards have been sent out to various
people's inamoratas to help celebrate the feast of Saint Valentinus.
If you're Catholic and your calendar says it's later than 1969, then 
please be advised that Valentine got defrocked just after the Summer of
Love (a Vatican II thing).
</p>

<p>
If you're Eastern Orthodox, then you do still have a Hagio Valentinus --
but his saint's day is July 6th.
</p>

<p>
If you'd rather celebate a less Hallmark holiday, wait until tomorrow,
which is Lupercalia, aka Februatio, the festival of purification, in
which Romans rang out the old year in high fashion:  Priests of Faunus
dubbed the "Luperci" (brothers of the wolf) would gather near the cave
of Lupercal on Palatine Hill (where the she-wolf was supposed to have
raised Rhea Silvia's kids, Romulus and Remus) to sacrifice two male
goats and a dog, smearing blood on their foreheads, eating a feast, 
then dress in (only) the newly flayed goatskins and run a circuit around
the city walls carrying lashes cut from the sacrificial victims.  As
they ran, they lashed young women along their route, to help ensure
fertility.  
</p>

<p>
Plutarch commented (in The Parallel Lives):  "At this time many of the
noble youths and of the magistrates run up and down through the city
naked, for sport and laughter striking those they meet with shaggy
thongs.  And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and
like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that
the pregnant will thus be helped to an it is delivery, and the barren to
pregnancy."
</p>

<p>
Killjoy Pope Gelasius I abolished Lupercalia, and declared the feast of
St. Valentine in its (approximate) place, in 496.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, more goatskins and fewer greeting cards, I say.

&gt; But this <strong>isn't</strong> blarney, I'm sure.
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I <strong>would</strong> have been able to do some last minute work on it today, but
&gt; &gt; I was in court - on the 8th I went to the pub for an hour and a half,
&gt; &gt; and passed out while crossing the street afterwards. The woman who
&gt; &gt; almost ran over me phoned the Gardai, and I was arrested.
&gt;
&gt; Yoiks! (We're awfully glad that was only "almost".)
</pre>

<p>
Me too!
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt; I blame the insomnia I've been suffering since the end of the last
&gt; &gt; year (and, fortunately, the judge seemed to agree): this isn't the
&gt; &gt; first or last time that I've passed out from simple fatigue recently.
&gt;
&gt; Given your new duties, that's rather worrying.
</pre>

<p>
Actually, I slept last night, and most of today, without resorting to
chemical assistance. Now that the court visit is behind me I feel free
to relax about the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
That, and I've stopped drinking coffee after 6pm <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

The past month has been quite the whirlwind adventure - both in the
positive and the negative senses of the phrase. For one thing, it's been
one continuous roadtrip: Denver, Boston, Los Angeles, New York, and back to
Boston for a week apiece, living out of a suitcase and amid frantic
arrangements in an ever-changing, bewildering galaxy of hotels, flights,
and car rentals. In the midst of all that, I've also been dealing with
dying computers, dying relatives, living relatives (which can, at times, be
a much worse ordeal), new business coming in like gang-busters (not that I
should complain), trying to handle current commitments - including
publishing LG from the road... and, as always, trying to take a moment to
sniff the flowers and listen to the sound of the surf breaking on the
rocks. Whatever else happens, a life that doesn't include a quiet moment
for appreciation of the beauty around us is not one that I'd want to live.
</p>

<p>
While in LA, Kat and I managed to attend the Southern California Linux Expo
(SCaLE) and had the great pleasure of meeting one of the LG regulars, Kapil
Hari Paranjape - who took the opportunity to crank out a <a
href="kapil.html">con report</a>, which we're publishing in this issue. Kat
had her own take on the proceedings:
</p>

<div style="background-color:#f4f1bf; border:black solid 1px; padding:10px;">
<p>
When Orv Beach invited us to the Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE),
Ben and I had planned to make a weekend of it.
</p>

<p>
Boston weather, airplanes, and the resulting winter blahs intervened and we
ended up doing SCaLE in one whirlwind day, but we managed to float a new
tag line for LG (<strong>The Free International Online Linux
Monthly</strong>), introduce ourselves and exchange contact information with
nearly every exhibitor, collect some nifty gimmes (I <em>really</em> like my
Google-femme babydoll t-shirt!) and get interviewed by Oscar Toscano of
Todo Exito (<a href="http://www.todoexito.com">http://www.todoexito.com</a>).
</p>

<p>
If you've always wanted to hear what we sound like, you can hear (a badly
congested and nearly voiceless) Ben and me in our LG audio debut here:
<a href="http://www.todoexito.com/podcasts/view/22">http://www.todoexito.com/podcasts/view/22</a> .
</p>

<p>
You can find the other SCaLE interviews (including Krugle, HaikuOS, and
Perl Programmers Group LA) at <a
href="http://www.todoexito.com/s/tags/Linux%20Expo%20Scale%20Conference">http://www.todoexito.com/s/tags/Linux Expo Scale Conference</a>
.
</p>

<p>
There's also more SCaLE followup (photos and other con reports) at:
<a href="http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale5x/pr.php">http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale5x/pr.php</a> .
</p>
</div>

<p>
All in all, SCaLE was a lot of fun: a bunch of Linux people doing
interesting things and putting the message out to the world. And it seems
that the world is listening: even though this was a regional show, the
exhibitors included IBM, Sun Microsystems, Dell, Google, Novell,
Ticketmaster and many others. If you're in the area, be sure to mark
your calendar: SCaLE 6x is coming, and it'll be larger and better than
ever!

<p>
Those of you who recall <a href="../131/lg_backpage.html">my last
Backpage</a> may remember my cry for help: since LG is a volunteer-run
project, the only thing that sustains it is the effort and the energy
contributed by members of this community. Articles, news, PR - both
incoming and outgoing, proofreading, technical editing, layout, graphic
design, programming, publishing, maintenance, corrections - all of these
require people, ones who are either skilled at these jobs or willing to
take on the even larger job of learning (and perhaps reinventing) these
tasks.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for LG, a number of smart, willing, ambitious, and skilled
people have responded. To be scrupulously honest, perhaps not all of them
are all these things at once, but those who aren't yet experts are trying
hard - and it's a pleasure to be a part of an effort in which the
participants are all there by their own decision and working toward a
common, positive goal. We're always happy to see more volunteers - after
all, there is always more work, and more <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/jobs.html">fun, interesting projects</a> -
but the current bunch are an amazing group of people, and I'm proud to call
myself part of this team.
</p>

<p>
Interestingly enough, the additional volunteers have not necessarily - and
this is NOT a complaint - made my job at LG any easier; perhaps my
expectations were somewhat unrealistic. Instead, what appears to have
happened is that my job is now <em>different</em>: rather than handling
every detail of the actual process, there's now a very large component of
dealing with people - something that was present previously, but in much
smaller quantities. I've managed to bear up under the change and the
surprise, but I'm still somewhat bemused: I had imagined some version of
lying back on a beach with a margarita in hand while the busy LG dwarves
and elves ran the place and kept everything shining and spotless. [sigh]
It bugs me to think that in some parallel world, there's a Ben Okopnik
doing exactly that... on the other hand, maybe not. I'd be bored to death
within the week. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)" />
</p>

<p>
Just to recap: LG still needs authors, programmers, and smart, willing,
knowledgeable people - and always will. It's a great way to give something
back to your community, and an excellent place to refine your old skills
and pick up some new ones. Join us! (I'll be the guy slaving over the hot
issue.)<br>

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.

Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>

<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found full of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler.
