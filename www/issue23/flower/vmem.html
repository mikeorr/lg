<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Virtual memory provides a way of running more processes
than can physically fit within a computer's physical address space.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;Each process that is a candidate for running on
a processor is allocated it's own virtual memory area which defines the
logical set of addresses that a process can access to carry out it's required
task. As this total virtual memory area&nbsp; is very large (typically
constrained by the number of address bits the processor has and the maximum
number of processes it supports), each process can be allocated a large
logical address space (typically 3Gb) in which to operate.</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;It is the job of a virtual memory manager to ensure
that active processes and the areas they wish to access are remapped to
physical memory as required. This is achieved by a method of swapping or
paging the required sections (pages) into and out of physical memory as
required.&nbsp;&nbsp; Swapping involves replacing a complete process with
another in memory whereas paging involves removal of a 'page' (typically
2-4kbytes) of the process's mapped memory and replacing it with a page
from another process.&nbsp; As this may be a computer intensive and time
consuming task, care is taken to minimise the overhead that it has. This
is done by usage of a number of algorithms designed to take advantage of
the common locality of related sections of code and also&nbsp; only carrying
out some operations such as memory duplication or reading when absolutely
required ( techniques known as <I>copy on write, lazy paging</I> and <I>demand
paging</I>).</FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The virtual memory owned by a process may contain code
and data from many sources. Executable code may be shared between processes
in the form of shared libraries, as these areas are read-only there is
little chance of them becoming corrupted. Processes can allocate and link
virtual memory to use during their processing,</FONT>

many operating systems, including Linux and Windows NT include :</FONT>
