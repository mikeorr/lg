<h1>Life With Unix</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/orr.html">Mike Orr (Sluggo)</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3><a name="introduction" id="introduction">Introduction</a>
</h3>

<p>This article started percolating when <a class="reference" href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/authors/adam.html">Thomas</a> asked:</p>

<blockquote>I'd really love to see an article of how Unix was used
in the past. Now, with PCs so cheap and popular, it's all the same
method. You don't often hear of people saying they're using a
dumb-terminal (unless they have an XDMCP server
running.)</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.linuxpakistan.net/man.php?query=terminfo&amp;apropos=0&amp;section=0&amp;type=2">
terminfo</a> database actually meant something back then. On the
other hand, the multiplicity of keyboard layouts led to the
infamous <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Keyboard-and-Console-HOWTO-5.html">backspace
problem</a> in Linux. (But it's <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/backspace.html">not just a Linux
problem</a>.) Anyway, here's how I found Unix, Linux, and Linux
Gazette. There's also a bit on the development of
internationalization (non-English support), and muse a bit on the
importance of history.</p>

<h3><a name="the-1980s-and-alphabet-soup" id=
"the-1980s-and-alphabet-soup">The 1980s and alphabet soup</a>
</h3>

<p>I started computing in junior high school, taking a BASIC class
on <a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/appleii.html">Apple II</a>'s (1980). A
fellow student's father had one at his office, so we met there on
Saturdays and wrote our first game, a shoot-the-bird thing. Soon
afterward my dad borrowed a <a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/trs80i.html">TRS-80</a> Model 1 Level 2
for me to play with. 16 KB RAM. A cassette interface that never
worked so I couldn't save programs. <a class="footnote-reference"
href="#cassette" id="id1" name="id1"><sup>1</sup></a> Instead I
left the computer on and put different programs in different number
ranges. (BASIC programs had mandatory line numbers.) I immediately
saw the computer's potential as a word processor, but neither model
had lowercase letters. The TRS-80's manual said there was a "hole"
in the video memory where the lower-case ASCII bit would have been.
I didn't understand why they left out something so fundamental.
Every month, <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.atarimagazines.com/creative/index/">Creative
Computing</a> magazine had sample programs and programming
contests. (Echoing later DRM controversies, the first issue
discussed a plot by the US Postal Service to regulate email.
<a class="footnote-reference" href="#email" id="id2" name=
"id2"><sup>2</sup></a>) Every microcomputer was incompatible; they
all had tradeoffs in their graphic capabilities and BASIC features.
(They were called microcomputers then. "PC" came from the later IBM
PC trademark.) I never saw a <a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/pet2001.html">PET</a>; I saw the <a class=
"reference" href="http://oldcomputers.net/atari400.html">Atari
400</a>, <a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/atari800.html">Atari 800</a>, <a class=
"reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/amiga1000.html">Amiga</a>, and an early
<a class="reference" href=
"http://oldcomputers.net/trs80pc1.html">palmtop</a> (TRS-80 Pocket
Computer) only in stores.</p>

<p>People couldn't afford computers so they played video games in
arcades. Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Defender/Stargate. I didn't
because I vowed, "One day I will have my own computer and I won't
have to put quarters into it." Then I got a computer and had so
much serious stuff I wanted to use it for that I didn't have the
patience to learn games. But I have to say, the best game was
<a class="reference" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defender_%28arcade_game%29">Defender</a>/<a class="reference"
href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_(video_game)">Stargate</a>
because the spaceships would explode to the edges of the screen,
then later unexplode at the start of a new round.</p>

<p>In high school (1982) I convinced my dad to get an MTU (Micro
Technology Unlimited) computer after a rave review in a magazine.
[<a class="reference" href=
"http://1000bit.net/scheda.asp?id=1037">Picture</a>] It cost around
$3500, and had 64 KB RAM. The operating system was CODOS
("Channel-Oriented Disk Operating System"). By "channels" it meant
file descriptors, borrowed from Unix. It had programmable fonts,
sideways text in the graphics API, and GRIN ("GRaphic INput",
meaning you specified a pixel by moving a screen-wide crosshair
with the arrow keys). Neat toys, but ultimately not useful for
much. Eventually my dad sold it to his girlfriend, who did PR at
Microsoft in the early days. She loved the MTU and its word
processor, especially the function-key legends at the bottom of the
screen.</p>

<p>Then the IBM PC came out. Its BASIC had many more features than
any of the others. I'd go to the computer store and read the
manuals and imagine programming it. Then the Macintosh came out in
1984 and blew our socks off. A word processor that actually showed
you the fonts live onscreen. Cute little icons, draggable folders.
In college I borrowed time on my friends' Macs to write my papers.
My dad bought an IBM XT for work, but I didn't use it much until
later.</p>

<p>In 1987, my second year of college, I took two programming
classesi, both using Modula-2 on VAX/VMS mainframes. We wrote programs on
h19 terminals using an editor called h19. The boring terminals were
hardwired to one mainframe; the interesting terminals had a text
menu of computers you could log into. Dialing in from home you also
got the menu. I soon discovered email and phone (a split-screen
chat program). Those blew my mind; I immediately saw the power of
networking and databases. I could write to somebody in Iran and get
a reply in a few minutes. For the next several years I tried to
convince my dad to get an email account for his business, but he
never saw the point. Online services consisted of dozens of local
bulletin boards, <a class="reference" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe">CompuServe</a> and a few
others, and the BITNET the universities used. There were Internet
gateways between the mail networks by that point, but CompuServe
charged 10c/message for foreign email. There was one Unix computer
(blake) on the campus network, but nobody I knew used it. Unix was
just one more thing in the alphabet soup of systems.</p>

<p>In 1989 I graduated (in Speech Communication) and inherited my
dad's XT. He was selling medical insurance plans (or what are now
called medical savings accounts) to companies, and had me test the
proposal/administration program his programmer was writing (in
BASIC). He wanted to give away stacks of floppies with the proposal
program at banks as a way to recruit customers. The program gave a
rate quote for the client's company size and employee profile
(e.g., how many with children). Later he wanted it to compare our
rates with plans from the various insurance companies, to give the
public greater knowledge and choice. It would have been a perfect
application for the Web, but the Web didn't exist yet.</p>

<h3><a name="the-1990s-and-unix" id="the-1990s-and-unix">The 1990s
and Unix</a>
</h3>

<p>In 1990 the Mac Classic came out, the first cheap Macintosh at
$1090. My six-year dream of owning a Macintosh became a reality.
But the following summer I bought a huge book on AT&amp;T Unix and
thought it was the bomb. Everything that DOS did badly, Unix did
well. To practice Unix, I got a dialup shell at a bulletin board
running XENIX. It had Usenet via UUCP. In Usenet messages I heard
about this wonderful thing called FTP that was download heaven, but
you had to be directly on the Internet to use it. Only universities
and a few large companies had Internet access. So I connived to get
a job at the university, where I could use the labs and get paid
too, rather than me having to pay tuition. I got a filing job at
one company, which lead to a data entry job (using a horrible IBM
mainframe program that looked <em>so</em> primitive). Then a data
entry job opened up at the university, or rather at the large
hospital it's affiliated with.</p>

<p>I got a second book about Unix called <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0135366577/002-2540751-2964812?v=glance">
Life With Unix</a> (1989: Prentice Hall, out of print). It was a
humorous look at the Unix culture and philosophy, with lots of
interesting trivia. I'd recommend it if you can find it. This
article is titled "Life With Unix" in its honor.</p>

<p>I started that job in November 1991, and a week later learned
about Linux in a Usenet message. Talk about a Christmas present.
Linux was at version 0.6. There was a boot disk and a root disk,
but no user accounts. I wanted to run Linux so badly but I didn't
have a 386. My friend installed it, said you couldn't do much with
it, and erased it. The next year I sold my Mac for $150 and bought
a 486/66 for $2000.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at the university, there was now a general student
computer, a Sequent/DYNIX (milton). Unix denizens used the cooler
DEC/Ultrix (hardy), a BSD variant, especially for CPU-intensive
compilation. There was also an AIX computer. The VAXen were still
online for the engineers. The h19 terminals had been replaced with
NCD X-terminals. I thought their high-resolution color screens were
a ridiculous waste of money. The terminals came with a built-in
window manager (Motif) and a menu to telnet into the
frequently-used hosts, each in an xterm window. This was the
University of Washington, so Pine was encouraged. Everybody read
their mail via telnet/Pine. But you could do xdm login to one of
the Unix machines and get a graphical login screen and twm. That's
what the cool people did. The tradeoff was it took more CPU time on
the host, so after eight hours you got nice'd and things slowed way
down. Most of what is now blogs and chatting and eBay was done on
Usenet. "The Net" meant the Usenet community. I'd go down Friday
evening to "read news" and get home Saturday afternoon. We didn't
really use the GUI at all except to set the background image and
run a clock. A few people played MUDs.</p>

<p>I put Linux on my shiny new PeeCee in 1992, first the MCC
Interim distribution, then Slackware. xfree86 wasn't stable yet and
I despaired it ever would be. I almost bought BSDI Unix which did
have an X-server, but the $1000 cost daunted me.</p>

<p>My hospital job went from data entry to database (FoxPro), and
then workstation support (Windoze). In 1995 I got a better PC which
I tried to put the new version of Slackware on, but it kept
segfaulting at random moments. I cursed Slackware and asked a colleague
which distribution was most reliable. He said, "Red Hat, because
they actually test their distribution." Red Hat had just come out;
it was the first commercial distribution. But I switched to Debian
instead because of its community development process; I planned to
become a developer. Later when I tried to compile a kernel, the
segfaults came back, and I finally traced them to bad memory. So it
wasn't Slackware's fault after all, but I had already switched.</p>

<p>I dreamed of getting a job using Linux. For years that was
unrealistic; everybody wanted Windows. By 1996 it was starting to
seem possible, then in 1997 it happened. I got a sysadmin/tech
support job at a small ISP, and installed Slackware on 386s to
function as wireless routers. The computers came from the Boeing
surplus store for $50 each. The ISP owner made a deal with "friends
in high places", giving them a free T-1 equivalent in exchange for
putting a microwave antenna on their roof and a router in their
attic. The other servers were a mixture of BSD (dns), HP-Apollo
(mail), and NT (ppp). I left after a couple months and returned a
year later (1998), and the 386's were <em>still</em> being used.
But there were some dozen dead ones. My job was to move parts
around to get some of them working. Some had pre-IDE drives, a
protocol called RLL, but Linux detected them just fine. :) Yet only
two or three computers were usable. So one glorious day I put ten
386's in the dumpster. The next day, the owner went to the Boeing
surplus and got ten more $50 computers. This time they were 486's
with more recent peripherals. Good for me; it meant they were more
reliable.</p>

<p>I learned at that company there's such a thing as being too
cheap. We sysadmins couldn't get the equipment we needed. The owner
was determined to squeeze the last bit of life out of the ancient
HP-Apollos with their esoteric Unix interface. The network was
practically held together by duct tape. My co-sysadmin said, "I can
hear the servers groaning at night and I'm worried." The dialin
server was NT. I wasn't sure I wanted to work for a company I
couldn't recommend to my friends, so I quit.</p>

<p>My programming hobby had gone from BASIC to C to Perl to Access
BASIC. Then Java appeared in 1997 and I believed the hype. But Sun
wouldn't release a JDK for Linux, and the third-party Blackdown
clone looked like it would always be a year behind Sun's version. I
learned about Python in a Java newsgroup, jumped ship and never
looked back. The more I used Python, the more I liked it, similar
to how I'd found Linux.</p>

<p>In 1999 I got a job at Linux Journal (SSC) as webmaster.
Marjorie Richardson was editing Linux Gazette, and it was taking
every last weekend of the month -- difficult when you have a
family. She gladly turned it over to me so she could "have her
weekends back". I knew about LG but had never read it much,
preferring to have my information indexed (everything in its place)
rather than random (as the 2-Cent Tips are). There was no Answer
Gang, just Jim the Answer Guy and Heather the Editor Gal. We formed
The Answer Gang to share the load, and later made the <a class=
"reference" href="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/kb.html">TAG
Knowledge Base</a> and improved the LG <a class="reference" href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/search.html">search engine</a>.</p>

<p>I started using KDE at SSC, since it was the office standard.
For work it's better to have everything you might need under the
menus, rather than scrounging around to find and install a program.
Eventually I switched from FVWM to KDE at home too.</p>

<h3><a name="the-2000s" id="the-2000s">The 2000s</a>
</h3>

<p>By 2000 the Linux bandwagon was in full swing and I heard all
about it as LG editor and overhearing the LJ editorial staff. If
you look at the News Bytes column in LG around 1998-2000, it was
full of press releases from companies. This was necessary in the
early years to promote Linux and help struggling companies, but
eventually I got tired of the marketroid hype. How can every
company be "the leading" one in its field? Then Dmitry Sklyarov got
jailed for writing a decryptor for Adobe's eBook format, and I
started putting political analysis in News Bytes (<a class=
"reference" href=
"http://linuxgazette.net/issue71/lg_bytes71.html">first
article</a>) and cutting out the press releases. Then Mick Conry
took over News Bytes and kept the focus on analysis and nonprofit
activities, also bringing a European perspective.</p>

<p>Seeing the press releases and LinuxWorld conferences burned me
out on the Linux advocacy role. Others were doing it; I didn't need
to anymore. Linux became just the environment I compute in, not a
crusade.</p>

<p>In March 2001 there was an article in the newspaper about
Microsoft not meeting its stock expectations. I considered it
minor; stock prices move up and down all the time. But incredibly,
it precipitated a selloff that became the dot-com crash. "Are these
investors idiots?" I thought. "First they buy stock way above the
companies' asset value, then they dump it on minor news."</p>

<p>In 2003 I was laid off from SSC. I wanted to get out of sysadmin
and take a break from programming. I thought about technical
writing. But then one Python job came up and then another, and I
couldn't turn those down since they're so fun.</p>

<p>Last summer I switched from Debian to Gentoo, which is what my
computer is running now.</p>

<h3><a name="internationalization" id=
"internationalization">Internationalization</a>
</h3>

<p>Internationalization was held back mainly by hardware. ASCII
(1967) predated microcomputers, but it took years to become fully
implemented on them. The Apple II had the most complete set,
including []|, which it flaunted in the computer's name (Apple ][)
and command prompt (]). But it did not have lowercase letters.</p>

<p>The TRS-80 had four arrows instead of []|. It also had no Ctrl
key, so you couldn't type control characters from the keyboard. You
had to use the CHR$(n) function to display them. A few characters
could be displayed only by POKE'ing them into video memory. The
high-bit characters were block graphics (a 2x3 grid with every
combination of "pixels" lit). The PSET command lit a certain
pseudo-pixel by mapping its x,y coordinate and its five neighbors
to a Tetris-like character. This trick allowed you to mix text and
graphics, which the Apple II didn't do except as a split screen.
The TRS-80 model II had a second character set, Japanese <a class=
"reference" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana">kana</a>.</p>

<p>The Apple II used the high bit for inverse video. Keyboard input
came in via a reserved memory location, and the high bit indicated
there was a new character waiting. So the high bit was "wasted",
not usable for distinct characters. (The Apple II also used
reserved memory locations for many other purposes. For instance if
you PEEK a certain address, it would switch video modes. Addresses
were signed 16-bit integers, so many reserved addresses were
negative. More trivia about <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.uni-giessen.de/faq/archiv/apple2.asoft/msg00000.html">Applesoft
BASIC</a> is in the FAQ.)</p>

<p>The IBM PC put western European characters in the high-bit
space, hooray! But to input them you had to hold down ALT and type
the numeric code, which meant you had to memorize them or carry a
chart around. As if! The <a class="reference" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437">characters chosen</a>
were a seeming hodgepodge: OK for Spanish and German, lacking
capitals for some accented letters, and who uses a y-umlaut? This
character set conformed to no standard, making it useless for data
interchange or archiving except with other DOS PCs. When IBM and
Microsoft started marketing DOS in non-English speaking countries,
they created character sets ("code pages") for the local languages,
Macintosh had its own character sets, Russian had its own homegrown
KOI-8 character set, and there was also the international standard
(<a class="reference" href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859">ISO-8859-n</a>). So it was
quite a mess.</p>

<p>But all these 8-bit character sets had a fatal flaw: you could
use only one language family in a document. Since all character
sets inherited ASCII you could mix English and French, or English
and Russian. But you couldn't mix Russian and French unless you
ASCII'fied one of them. Don't even think of making a Russian-Arabic
dictionary. And depending on hardware limitations, you could only
display one character set on the screen at a time anyway.</p>

<p>Unicode attempted to fix all these flaws by making a combined
character set covering all the world's alphabets. But software and
libraries had to be rewritten to recognize multi-byte characters.
This took years under Linux and is still not complete. You needed
Unicode fonts, libraries to encode data to UTF-8 (the
ASCII-friendly interchange format), standard labels for the
encodings, sorting algorithms, and Unicode-aware text editors. The
latter was the hardest part, especially if you had an affection for
an existing editor. The switch from console mode to X-windows was
also necessary, because the PC text console cannot use multibyte
character sets.</p>

<h3><a name="conclusion-the-value-of-history" id=
"conclusion-the-value-of-history">Conclusion: the value of
history</a>
</h3>

<p>It's always good to look back and see, not just what people did
but what their assumptions and goals were. I was born in 1966, and
grew up thinking the 1950s were the pinnacle of suburban
achievement, as homogeneous as <em>Leave It to Beaver</em>. Then I
read Philip K Dick, a postmodern author who belonged in the 60s
revolt but he was writing in the 50s. So the cracks in the American
dream were already apparent; people were just in massive denial.
Then you look at the physical layout of 50s houses. People were so
proud of their suburban houses with the latest convenience
appliances. But the houses were tiny: I visited a 2-bedroom house a
family grew up in, and it wasn't much bigger than my studio
apartment. One-car garages. Two electric outlets per room. (What do
you need to plug in besides a lamp?) Five TV channels, all black
and white. Phonograph records. Two radio dials: volume and tuning.
Yet a lot of people were very happy with all that; they thought it
was much better than before.</p>

<p>In the early 90s, Linux World Domination was just a farfetched
dream. We fretted about whether xfree86 would even run. Instead of
the Web there was the phone book. Life was slower. You mailed in a
resume (all nicely formatted on thick cream-color paper), got a
call on your answering machine, called back the next day. Now you
e-mail a text resume and if you don't answer your cell phone
immediately, the job goes to somebody else. These things happen so
gradually we don't realize how much we've changed, and we can't
even remember what we used to think.</p>

<p>The dot-com bubble was similarly seen as the pinnacle of the
technological boom. People read about Linux in the newspapers. You
had to have a .com after your name or you were nobody, even if you
were a hair salon or supermarket. Neighborhoods gentrified and
became boutiques. Then the crash came and things pulled back.
Domains expired. Apartments became affordable again (sort of). The
Linux hype vanished.</p>

<p>But Thomas Fridman argues in <a class="reference" href=
"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0374292884/qid=1127078140/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-2540751-2964812?v=glance&amp;s=books">
The World is Flat</a> that the greatest leap of computerization and
globalization actually happened after the crash. In spite of the
disillusion with online pet-food shopping. In spite of the
antiglobalization protests. Linux is no longer hyped, but it has
become commonplace. Companies know what Linux is, and they're more
willing to accept it if it gets things done. Linux has become
deeply rooted in governments, schools, and software engineers
outside the US. Much to the chagrin of SCO and Sun, Linux has
become the standard against which other Unixes are measured. If a
company ports software to Unix, it ports it to Linux first. That
is, if it didn't develop it in Linux in the first place. So there
is a lot happening behind the scenes now, it's just quieter.</p>

<p>David Keil's TRS-80 emulator for DOS comes complete with a
virtual cassette device. Its <a class="reference" href=
"http://discover-net.net/~dmkeil/trs80/trsdoc.htm#Operation-cassette">
manual page</a> is a total hoot. "Because the virtual cassette
works exactly like a real cassette it takes the same amount of time
to CSAVE a file in the emulator as it does on a real TRS-80. So
now, not only can you run cassette based programs with the emulator
you can also experience the incredible speed of cassette based
I/O." Tapes are stored as *.CAS files. The emulator has a baud-rate
control and motor on/off switch. To provide a more realistic
experience, the emulator does not force these to correct values;
instead it will happily read gibberish if you set the baud rate
wrong, or overwrite the next program if you forget to turn the
motor off. You can also connect a real tape recorder to your sound
card. And if you don't have a sound card, don't worry. You can save
the program to a WAV file, and load WAV-programs created by regular
sound utilities! I wonder what Barry Manilow's "Copacabana" would
do to a TRS-80?</p>

<p>"Two main views were heard [at the Electronic Mail &amp; Message
Conference], though there are several more. One was the idea that
electronic mail is in some sense a simple replacement of paper
mail, which the Post Office speakers seemed to think. The other
view sees 'electronic mail' as just one fact of the coming world of
transmissive computing in which a lucky few already live.... A
surprising political issue surfaced at the conference: the role
demanded by the U.S. Postal Service in a new world they claim to
understand but may not. What the Postal Service wants to do might
narrow and restrict what you can do in the future with your
computer. [<a class="reference" href=
