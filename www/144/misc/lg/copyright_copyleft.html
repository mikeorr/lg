<p>
Just wondering, why all the GNU/Linux man pages refer to copyright
only and do not have no reference / brief statement regd "copyleft".
</p>

<p>
Quicky browsing through the
"<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html</a>", I did understand that
this concept of copyleft is incorporated by applying copyright and
then adding terms of distribution.
</p>

<p>
To quote from the above URL,
</p>

<p>
"To copyleft a program, we first state that it is copyrighted; then we
add distribution terms, which are a legal instrument that gives
everyone the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the program's
code or any program derived from it but only if the distribution terms
are unchanged . . . "
</p>

<p>
Any thoughts ?
</p>

<p>
Not everything in a typical GNU/Linux is "copyleft" and different contributors 
will have different approaches. If you look at man pages for code where the 
FSF owns the copyright, e.g. emacs, you will see that they state their 
copyright and add distribution terms, as quoted above.
</p>

<p>
Many other man pages are for code owned by other people who have a less 
rigorous approach to copyright notices. Many man pages don't contain a 
copyright notice at all. 
</p>

<p>
Even the FSF man pages don't state the copyright for the code itself, just the 
copyright on the man page.

<p>
But given that it is a FSF man page it could be inferred that it 
is GPL no?

<p>
(Or whatever the GPL equivalent for documents is)
