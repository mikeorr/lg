This is, hands down, the single dumbest bug report I've ever seen:
<a href='http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/issues/detail?id=337'>http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/issues/detail?id=337</a>
</p>

<p>
I'm kind of reminded of the usability thread, because whenever I see a
dumb question on the Tesseract list, or in the issue tracker, it's
<strong>always</strong> a Windows user.
</p>

<p>
But mostly, I'm just wondering: can anybody think of a valid reason
why anyone would want to OCR a CAPTCHA?

&gt;
&gt; Can you say "spambot"?
</pre>

<p>
I did say 'valid'...  My answer was:
That's a CAPTCHA, which BY DESIGN cannot be read by OCR.
</p>

<p>
You've betrayed such a complete misunderstanding of everything you've
cared to mention - digits are numbers, not letters - that I wouldn't
know where to begin, usually, but as I can't think of a single valid
reason why anyone would even <strong>want</strong> to OCR a CAPTCHA, I guess I don't
need to.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the only people I can think of who would want to OCR CAPTCHAs
are spammers, which is what I'm going to consider you to be.

<p>
OCR is one of the applications of computer vision.
</p>

<p>
The computer vision and artificial intelligence guys are extremely
interested in figuring out whether CAPTCHA's are truly beyond the
capability of "automated" cracking. In some cases CAPTCHA's have been
cracked by programmes. For example,
</p>

<p>
 <a href='http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/gimpy/'>http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/gimpy/</a>
</p>

<p>
Remember that CAPTCHA stands for:
</p>

<p>
 Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and
 Humans Apart
</p>

<p>
So it is an attempt to have a computer generate a Turing Test which
another computer cannot solve. If it is indeed possible to do this
then AI would have failed!

My linusability project specifically excludes MS users and MS
worshippers, for this very same reason. I am also deliberately
avoiding users who want to dual boot Linux with MS-Win. Like trying to
use a buffalo to propel a jet engine. . In fact, I  come across many
more disgusting ones than the person who wants to OCR a CAPTCHA.

You said it yourself: spammers. I think that's a 100% lock.
</p>

<p>
They were probably hoping that you, or whoever else responded to their
"bug report", were stupid enough to show them how to make it work (which
involves the assumption that it can be made to work.) Looking like an
idiot against a chance of learning how to crack CAPTCHAs? Any spammer
would take that bet, double-quick.

[laugh] You <em>could</em> do it; it would just be a very, very slow-moving

It reminds me of the story of a marine railway in South Africa, not all

Yeah, but I think somebody engaged in legitimate computer vision
research would be aware that you need more than a single sample to
perform training, and, even if they weren't, would have paid enough
attention to the training document to have read that.

<p>
Mostly, I've been second-guessing my reaction (it has been brought to
my attention quite a lot recently that I can be quite harsh in my
responses). I asked on an IRC channel too, they all came to the same
conclusion...
</p>

<p>
&lt;jimregan&gt;      I don't want spammers coming to me for free help
&lt;jimregan&gt;      well
&lt;jimregan&gt;      one exception

</p>

<p>
A lot of people use Tesseract for tasks for which it wasn't designed -
most of the people who are vocal on the mailing list, in fact -
including licence plate recognition, business card recognition, etc.
</p>

<p>
So it had been at the back of my mind that, at some stage, some
spammer would happen along. What particularly disgusted me was that I
had been prodding at the particular feature the spammer had requested
earlier in the day.
