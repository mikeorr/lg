<h1>Solving sudokus with GNU Octave (I)</h1>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++ INTRODUCTION ++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="Sec:Introduction"><h2>I. Introduction</h2></a>

<p>
<a href="#ref-octave">GNU Octave</a> is a high level language designed
for science and engineering applications. Easy to learn and simple
to teach, Octave can be used as a sophisticated interactive graphical
calculator. On the other hand, the rich set of data structures (complex
numbers, vectors, matrices, multidimensional arrays, strings, lists,
function handles, cell arrays, ...) and, in particular, the complete
collection of matrix operations and functions give Octave enough punch
to be used in professional applications. From a programmer's point
of view, the interface of Octave functions is superb. Incidentally,
Octave is highly compatible in notation and functionality with <a
href="#ref-matlab">MatLab</a>, a leading instrument in many engineer's
toolbox.
</p>

<p>
The intention of this article is to show the matrix capabilities
of the language by analyzing the solution of arbitrary 9x9 classical <a
href="#ref-sud1">sudokus</a>. A primitive code, combining simple scan and
brute force trial-and-error guessing will be discussed. More advanced solving
techniques will be the subject of a future installment.
</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++ MATRIX OPERATIONS +++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="Sec:MatOp"><h2>II. Matrix operations</h2></a>

<p>
Before going on to the sudoku problem, it may be useful to discuss a few
ideas about the language matrix capabilities. First of all, Octave
matrices can be defined and addressed element by element, but it is far
more efficient to handle them as a whole using the rich set of operations
and functions that the language provides. Compare, for instance, the
following code for defining and multiplying two 100x100 random matrices
element by element:
</p>

<pre class="code">
tstart = cputime;   # Start timing
rand("seed",pi);    # Initialize random number to a known seed
for i = 1:100       # Fill up the two 100x100 random matrices
   for j = 1:100
      A(i,j) = rand();
   endfor
endfor
for i = 1:100
   for j = 1:100
      B(i,j) = rand();
   endfor
endfor
for i = 1:100       # Multiply the matrices
   for j = 1:100
      C(i,j) = 0;
      for k = 1:100
         C(i,j) += A(i,k) * B(k,j);
      endfor
   endfor
endfor
Sum = 0;            # The sum of all elements in C
for i = 1:100
   for j = 1:100
      Sum += C(i,j);
   endfor
endfor
disp(Sum);
tend = cputime() - tstart;
disp(tend);
</pre>

<p>
with the equivalent code using matrices at once
</p>

<pre class="code">
tstart = cputime;   # Start timing
rand("seed",pi);    # Initialize random number to a known seed
A = rand(100);      # Fill up the two 100x100 random matrices
B = rand(100);
C = A * B;          # Multiply the matrices
Sum = sum(sum(C));  # The sum of all elements in C
                    # The inner sum() returns the sum of each column
disp(Sum);
tend = cputime() - tstart;
disp(tend);
</pre>

<p>
The matrix code is shorter, simpler, and some 2500 times faster (0.024
seconds compared to 58.8 seconds, on a typical 2.4 GHz Pentium). The
main reason for this huge CPU time difference lies in the fact Octave is an
interpreted language, so while loops must be parsed, interpreted, and
performed once per cycle, matrix operations are transformed at once into fast
machine code able to exploit the vector capabilities of the CPU.
</p>

<p>
Addressing parts of a matrix is simple with Octave. The i-th row
and the j-th column of <tt>M</tt> are invoked as <tt>M(i,:)</tt> and
<tt>M(:,j)</tt>, respectively; <tt>M(i:i+3,j:j+3)</tt> slices a 4x4
block that starts at the <tt>M(i,j)</tt> element; <tt>M(2:2:,1:2:)</tt>
slices all elements that belong to an even row and an odd column; and
<tt>M(find(M&gt;0))</tt> returns a vector made of all elements in M that
are positive. More matrix magic can be done by using address indices.
</p>

<p>
As a final remark on the specifics of Octave matrices, the
elements are stored in column-major order (i.e. Fortran-like order, with
<tt>M(1,1)</tt> being followed by <tt>M(2,1)</tt>, <tt>M(3,1)</tt>, etc.),
and the starting value for the indices is 1 by default. As a default, a
two-dimensional matrix can also be addressed as a one dimensional vector
but if that appears a little confussing, the <tt>reshape()</tt> function
can be used to explicitly change the matrix dimensions.
</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++ A SUDOKU SOLVER +++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="Sec:MatOp"><h2>III. The first sudoku solver</h2></a>

<p>
A classical sudoku is a 9x9 matrix formed by nine 3x3 blocks. The 0-9
digits fill the 81 matrix cells in such a way that each digit appears
exactly once in each row, each column, and each block. In fact,
the name sudoku comes from the Japanese phrase <em>"suuji wa dokushin
ni kagiru" ("the numbers must occur only once"</em>) that was used by the <a
href="http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/">Nicoli</a> publishing house. Starting
from a blank matrix, there are 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 different
possibilities (<a href="#ref-FJ05">Felgenhauer and Jarvis, 2005</a>), that
reduce to 5,472,730,538 unique sequences when all puzzle symmetries are
taken into account (<a href="#ref-RJ2005">Russell and Jarvis, 2005</a>).
The mathematical enumeration becomes an interesting logical mind game when
a few <i>clues</i> or given digits are added at selected places in the
matrix. In the <a href="#ref-jargon">sudoku jargon</a>, a <i>proper
puzzle</i> has a unique solution, whereas a <i>satisfactory puzzle</i> is
proper and can be solved without trial and error.
</p>

<p>
Two different types of methods have been applied in solving sudokus by
computer. The first kind of programs try to follow the same or similar
logical steps that human solvers employ. The second approach is based on a
reformulation of the problem as the minimization of a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_function">penalty function</a>.
The logical way has two appealing advantages for our purposes: it can trace
the reasoning used in a puzzle, and the logical steps can be used to grade
the difficulty from a human point of view.
</p>

<p>
The code to be introduced in this first article is very basic on
purpose. It uses a minimum of logical reasoning, relying heavily on trial
and error guessing. The input/output is also minimalistic. Notwithstanding
its limitations, the code (<tt>sudoku01.m</tt> from now on) is able to
find all possible solutions of a given puzzle entered by the user. Let
me show first the code and go later to discuss its main parts.

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++ INPUT / OUTPUT ++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="subSec:IO"><h3>A. The input/output part</h3></a>

<p>
The input/output part of <tt>sudoku01.m</tt> is extremely simple. The
code expects a data file name from the command line:
</p>

<pre class="ex">
octave -qf sudoku01.m top1465n0077.dat
</pre>

<p>
but the default, <tt>sudoku.dat</tt>, is used if no arguments are given.
The data file contains the input puzzle in any of three formats:
</p>

<ul>
<li>a 81 character string with zeros for the unknown digits
<pre class="ex">
700000400020070080003008009000500300060020090001007006000300900030040060009001035
</pre>
<li>a string with dots showing the unknown digit positions
<pre class="ex">
7.....4...2..7..8...3..8..9...5..3...6..2..9...1..7..6...3..9...3..4..6...9..1.35
</pre>
<li>or a 9x9 matrix with zeros as the unkowns
<pre class="ex">
7  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  2  0  0  6  0  0  3  0

</ul>

<p>
The output is managed by the <tt>sudoku_print()</tt> local function,
minimally reduced to a pair of <tt>disp()</tt> calls. The input is handled
by <tt>sudoku_read()</tt>, which uses <tt>argv()</tt> to retrieve the program
arguments, <tt>fgetl()</tt> to read a string, or <tt>load</tt> to read
the matrix format, and the local function <tt>str2digits()</tt> to convert
a string, character by character, into a matrix of digits.

<!-- +++++++++++++ KEEPING THE PRINCIPAL INFORMATION +++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="subSec:IO"><h3>B. Keeping the principal information ready</h3></a>

<p>
The current state of the puzzle is a 9x9 matrix of integer digits, with
zeros filling in the cells yet unknown. This matrix is appropriate for
simple tasks like obtaining the number of unknown cells,
<tt>length(find(sudoku_matrix==0))</tt>, or printing,
<tt>disp(sudoku_matrix)</tt>. Rows, columns, and blocks in the sudoku
matrix are numbered according to <a href="#fig:sudoku008a">figure 1</a>.
</p>

<p id="figure">
   <a name="fig:sudoku008a">
   <img src="misc/luana/sudoku008b.png"

        />
   </a>
   <br/>
   <b>Figure 1</b>
   A standard 9x9 sudoku showing how rows, columns, and blocks are
   labelled.
   
</p>

<p>
The analysis of the puzzle is facilitated through the use of three 9x9
logical matrices: <tt>row(,)</tt>, <tt>column(,)</tt>, and
<tt>block(,)</tt>. The three of them have a similar structure and meaning.
For instance, <tt>block(b,)</tt> is a column vector of nine elements that
contain a one (meaning 'true') in the positions that correspond to the digits
already assigned in block <tt>b</tt>, and a zero (meaning 'false') in the
position of the digits that are not yet assigned. So, in the case of the sudoku
shown in <a href="#fig:sudoku008a">figure 1</a>, <tt>block(3,:)</tt> is
<tt>[0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]</tt> because 3, 4, and 5 are the only digits
already assigned in block number <tt>3</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>row(,)</tt>, <tt>column(,)</tt>, and <tt>block(,)</tt>
are initially created in the <tt>sudoku_solve()</tt> function, but
they are used and maintained in synchrony with the sudoku matrix in
<tt>sudoku_trial()</tt>, the real core function of the program and the
true puzzle solver.

<!-- +++++++++++++++++ THE sudoku_trial FUNCTION +++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="subSec:IO"><h3>C. The <tt>sudoku_trial()</tt> function</h3></a>

<p>
This principal function of the solver is made up of two different
parts. The first part determines the number of digits admissible for
every unknown cell, identifies and fills those cells that have a single
candidate, and repeats this process until no new information is gained
in a complete cycle. The second part then takes an educated guess about
the content of a cell and recursively calls the <tt>sudoku_trial()</tt>
function to check whether the guess produces a correct solution for the
sudoku or gives rise to an impossible situation. Let me describe both
steps in a little more detail.

<p>
Two and nine are the two digits still admissible for the cell of the above
example. In general, the outcome of this analysis for any cell gives rise
to three different cases: (a) when there is a single candidate for a cell
we can assign it immediately, taking care of actualizing the state of the
sudoku matrix but also of the <tt>row()</tt>, <tt>column()</tt>, and
<tt>block()</tt> matrices; (b) when there is no admissible candidate, we
have arrived at an impossible state for the puzzle, probably as a result of
an incorrect guess in a trial-and-error search, and the solving routine
must be terminated with an error condition; and (c) when there are two or
more possible candidates. At that point, nothing can be done, but the cell
with the least number of multiple candidates is remembered for the second
part of the routine.
</p>

<p>
The assignment of a value to a cell produces information that directly influences
all cells that belong in the same row, column, or block, and indirectly 
the neighbors of these neighbors. Therefore, the search of single candidate
cells (<b>naked singles</b> or <b>singletons</b> in the parlance of some
sudoku aficionados) must be repeated until no new assignment is done in
a whole cycle. This loop structure will remain similar when more advanced
scanning techniques are introduced in our code.
</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++ TRIAL AND ERROR GUESSING +++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="subSec:IO"><h3>E. Trial and error guessing</h3></a>

<p>
Eventually, the scan loop arrives at a point where no further
information is gained. This is where guessing takes control. The cell
with the smallest number of candidates has already been identified in
the previous scan phase: <tt>minr</tt>, <tt>minc</tt> and <tt>minb</tt>
are the row, column, and block of this pivotal element, <tt>minpos</tt>
is the number of admissible digits, and <tt>minipos()</tt> is a vector
containing the actual digits.
</p>

<p>
The trial and error step consists of a loop that tries in sequence
all <tt>minipos(1:minpos)</tt> admissible digits for the pivot. The state
of the sudoku before this loop must be conserved so that each candidate
digit starts fresh from the same situation. The puzzle state is then
changed for the new candidate, and control is passed recursively to the
<tt>sudoku_trial()</tt> function for a new turn of scanning plus guessing.
The recursion stops when either a solution is found or an impossible
puzzle state is reached. An infinite recursive loop is not possible
because every new call to <tt>sudoku_trial()</tt> contains at least one
unknown cell fewer than the previous level call.
</p>

<p>
Keeping the puzzle state between alternative candidates is, in fact, a
consequence of the way that parameters are passed to Octave functions. 
Octave function arguments are passed by value, which means that each
argument is evaluated and copied to a variable local only to the function.
Unlike most languages, however, Octave functions can return multiple
values to the calling program block. This behavior is exploited in the
following fragment of our recursive routine:
</p>

<pre class="ex">
function [solved,sudout] = sudoku_trial(sud,row,column,block)
   ...
   for p = 1:minpos
      ...
      row(minr,n) = 1; column(minc,n) = 1; block(minb,n) = 1;
      [res2, sud2] = sudoku_trial(sud,row,column,block);
      row(minr,n) = 0; column(minc,n) = 0; block(minb,n) = 0;
      if (res2) solved=1; sudout=sud2; endif
      ...
   endfor
   ...
endfunction
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>sud()</tt>, <tt>row()</tt>, <tt>column()</tt>, and <tt>block()</tt>
matrices can be changed within the function, with confidence that their
modified value will not be passed back.
</p>

<p>
The naked singles scanning is just the simplest of the several logical
techniques that have been proposed to solve the sudoku puzzles. In
future articles, we will examine how to implement several additional methods:
hidden singles, subset interactions, x- and xy-wings, swordfish, etc. The
final objective is trying to solve as many puzzles as possible using direct
or indirect logical reasoning and avoiding the trial and error step.

<p>
To run the code discussed here under MatLab, please change all
occurrences of the specific terminators <tt>endfor</tt>, <tt>endif</tt>,
and <tt>endfunction</tt> into the generic <tt>end</tt>. Octave, but not
MatLab, recognizes both types of endings. Hopefully no further changes
should be needed, but we would not be surprised to learn otherwise.

I'm a Spaniard, living in Oviedo, close to the northern coast of Spain.
Married, with a teenager daughter ("hey, dad, this spiro thing is cool!"),
I teach Physical Chemistry and do research on Theoretical Chemistry for a
living. I have programmed on all sort of machines, from the mythical HP41C
to the not less mythical Cray X and Y supercomputers (the end of an era
left us short of a good <strong>crazy</strong> machine), for the last 25
years. I was captivated by linux around 1993, when our research group
discovered the first Slackware distribution. Our current infrastructure is
based on Debian and includes a half-mounted Top500
<strong>wannabee</strong> shared among many research groups.

love photography, but I don't like appearing on images myself. Anyway, this
self portrait has something that I don't dislike too much. The band on my
left hand has disappeared long ago.

I'm currently working in Oviedo, completing my Ph.D. in chemistry, near
 my birth place, a small town nearby called La Felguera. My interests
 include a wide range of fields but I am specially keen on (hardcore)
 scientific programming and scripting languages, with application to
 chemical problems in solids. When I'm not working, I enjoy reading and
 gaming (anything that tells a good story) and also playing chess.
