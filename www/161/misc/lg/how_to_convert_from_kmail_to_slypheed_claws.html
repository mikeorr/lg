<p>
Dear list,
</p>

<p>
Is there any way to convert the emails ( maildir form ) and account 
information (pop3, smtps)  stored in kmail to slypheed-claws ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

<p>
claws-mail (no longer called sylpheed-claws) supports these protocols,
yes.  Beyond confirming it, you'll have to set it up yourself.

Thanks Thomas,
</p>

<p>
I have no problem to setup the email accounts manually but I already have huge 
mails in kmail ( maildir format) because I have been using it since last a 
few years. That's why I'm in search of an application which can also convert 
maildir format to mbox. If claws-mail supports maildir then it would be only 
coping and pasting the folders.

<p>
thanks

I'm using claws-mail for several years now and it can read both mbox
and maildir (native format is maildir).  claws can configure the
mail-directory AND int can handle more than one. So you can either copy
your whole maildir structure into the new mail dir (or even better point
claws at the right directory containing your old mails). Or you can
keep the old and new separate but available inside  claws. mboxes can
be opened/imported as necessary. You can also export as mbox.

I seem to recall that maildir is just separate RFC822-formatted
messages. If it is, then the solution is simply
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
cat maildir/* &gt; mbox
</pre>

<p>
Otherwise, I'd imagine there are plenty of converters.

Only if the RFC2822 formatted messages have the extra first line of form
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
 From envelope-sender date-received
</pre>

<p>
Otherwise, at the very least, you would need to...
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
date=`date``
for f in maildir/* ; do
 echo "From someone@someplace $date" &gt;&gt; mbox
 cat "$f" &gt;&gt; mbox
done
</pre>

<p>
assuming a bourne-like shell, and I'm sure a little perlery would get you
the date of the email and, with luck, the envelope sender from some  
"X-Env-Sender:", or similar, header field.

Sure - I just did something like that for my recent 2-cent tip.

for file in maildir/*

<p>
Reasonable idea, although most emails don't have an 'X-Env-Sender: '
field, and the 'Date: ' field isn't formatted correctly. In any case,
neither the name nor the date in the 'From ' header doesn't seem to make
any difference, so it can be anything at all - as long as it's formatted
well.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
D=`date` perl -wne'/^From: (.*)$/ &amp;&amp; $u = $1; $m .= $_;
	END{ print "From $u $ENV{D}\n$m" }' maildir/* &gt; mbox
