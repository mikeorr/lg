<h3>[off-topic] Weather in Denver</h3>

<p>Quoting from weatherunderground.com:</p>
<pre>
Today
Mostly sunny. Windy. Patchy fog in low lying areas this morning. Highs
11 to 17. Wind chill readings 15 below zero to 30 below zero this
morning. Northwest winds 15 to 30 mph in the afternoon in locations
right near the foothills and near the Wyoming border.
</pre>
I'm <em>so</em> glad that I'm leaving today... although I don't
know that Boston, where I'm going next, will be any warmer. I've
lived in NYC, where it snows every winter, but
<strong>this</strong> crap brought Moscow to mind. <img src=

<p>Eh, do not worry too much. Boston is having a rather odd winter
with little to no snow fall. Currently we just have our trademark
high winds. Some days feel like it is cold enough for snow, but the
next day it feels like winter-&gt;spring. No one is quite sure what
is going on; personally I would like a true Boston winter (we
didn't even have a white x-mas!!!!) or nothing.</p>
<p>Of course, now that I have told you that it won't be too bad
here when you come we will get a blizzard, shutting down the air
ports and stranding you at Logan. Bwahaha.</p>

<p>It's OK; since I don't trust you people, I expect it. That's why
I have a Top Sekrit route out already prepared.</p>
<p>D'you think that the TSA will complain about my home-made plane
and several miles of surgical tubing? I'm just asking.</p>

<p>We had the "shutting down airports" kind of weather last month
and in December. A friend of mine was travelling from Wroclaw to
Dublin, and was talking to someone who was going to Edinburgh. They
met in Shannon. Before that, a few guys I know flew to Poznan. They
got drunk on the plane, and didn't notice until they left the
airport that they were flown to Berlin instead <img src=

<p>If it wasn't for the humor in the situation, it would be too
ugly to think about. I had a mostly-empty container of toothpaste
confiscated at the Denver airport (there was maybe half an ounce of
toothpaste in there) because the container was marked '6 oz.' The
TSA agent, with a completely straight face, explained to me that it
wasn't the amount that's in there, it's the amount that could be
<em>mixed</em> in there. I very carefully didn't point out to her
that the <strong>required</strong> Ziploc bag was of the
<strong>required</strong> 1-quart capacity...</p>
