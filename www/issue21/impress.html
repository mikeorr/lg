<H2>	Impressions reading Peter H. Salus `A Quarter Century of UNIX'				</H2>

<H4>	By Leif Erlingsson &nbsp;&lt;<a href="mailto:leif@lege.com">leif@lege.com</a>&gt;	</H4>

<P> <HR> <P> 
	I have been involved with Unix and the Internet since '88, and
	with Linux since '95, but it isn't until reading Peter H.
	Salus' `A Quarter Century of UNIX' during this summer vacation
	that I see where Linux fits in into the last 25 years of
	operating systems development.
<p>
	Unix came about as a revolt against cumbersome propriety
	operating systems shipped by the various hardware-vendors.
	In contrast, Unix was developed by a handful of people.  An
	example of a "huge" software project in the development of
	Unix is `awk'--developed by three people.
<p>
	UNICS (original name) was developed at Bell Telephone
	Laboratories in the Summer 1969 - Fall 1970.  Ken Thompson was
	the initiator and Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday were active
	contributors.
<br>	The intent was to create a pleasant computing environment for
	themselves. The hope was that others would like it also.

	The basic notion at the Labs (in Dennis Ritchie's words as
	quoted from the book),
<UL><p><DL>
		was and is to hire people who generate their own
		good ideas and carry them out....
</DL><p></UL>
	The Bell Telephone Laboratories staff (BTL) were supposed to
	discover or invent new things.  There was always management
	encouragement.
<p>
	It turned out Unix was easy to use and understand when
	compared to the competition. It was extremely compact. It
	wasn't until much later that anything and everything the user
	wanted was supplied (like vi, emacs, X, ksh, csh,... :-)).
<p>
	The single most important factor behind Unix' popularity was
	that in the beginning the source code was practically free.
	Thus it was used in education and as a base for derivate
	systems.  The universities loved it.  Later, when AT&T realized
	that they had in Unix something of great value and tried to
	capitalize on that, universities were forbidden to use the
	source code in education. This motivated Andy Tanenbaum to write
	MINIX, from whence Linus Torvalds got his inspiration to write a
	kernel for his Intel 386, the kernel that later became Linux.
<p>
	Bell Telephone Laboratories (50/50 owned by AT&T and Western
	Electric Company) was, by the so called "consent decree" of
	Jan 24, 1956 (entered into because of the Sherman Antitrust
	Act and a complaint filed by the Department of Justice in
	Jan 14, 1949), required to reveal what patents it held and
	supply information about them to competitors.  Also, the terms
	of the decree required BTL to license to anyone at nominal fees.
	So we have this "consent decree" to thank for the phenomenal
	spread of Unix! 
<p>
	BTL had the following support policy:
<UL><p><DL>
		no advertising
<br>		no support
<br>		no bug fixes
<br>		payment in advance
</DL><p></UL>
	This forced the users to band together, which resulted in
	better and more responsive support than any vendor could have
	managed.  Also, an "us" (users) against "them" (vendors)
	mentality formed, reinforced by actions taken by AT&T to
	stifle "the Unix problem". 
<p>
	This is very important:  Unix begat Internet!
<p>
	For a long time no one in business took Unix seriously.
	For AT&T it was just a legal problem.  It was run on VAX'es,
	but it took the Digital Equipment Corporation about a decade
	to learn how to support a Unix system as opposed to a Virtual
	Machine system because of the NIH syndrome. (NIH = Not
	Invented Here.)
<p>
	Does it sound like Linux or does it [sound like Linux] ?  :-)
<p>
	On 20 Nov 1974, the U.S. government filed a new antitrust
	action against AT&T, Western Electric, and Bell Telephone
	Labs.  The settlement reached in 1984 dissolved Western
	Electric, formed the "Baby Bells" and reorganized AT&T Bell
	Laboratories into Bell Telephone Labs.
<p>
	AT&T was now permitted to enter the hardware and software
	computer business.  AT&T sharply raised Unix license fees ... 
<p>
	One reaction was Richard M. Stallman's Free Software Foundation
	with it's GNU (Gnu is Not Unix) project, that has given the
	world a wealth of free versions of Unix systems programs.
	Another is Keith Bostic's CSRG project to create a license
	free version of Unix.  Today, all free Unix clones except
	Linux use the CSRG code, and all free Unix clones use the GNU
	code, Linux included.
<p>
	This is very important:  Internet begat GNU and CSRG, and
	therefore the free Unixes, Linux included.  And Unix begat
	Internet, so therefore,
<!--				in the biblical sense,			-->
							 Unix begat
	Linux.  Also, as we all know, Linux is continually developed
	on the Internet by a looseknit band of programmers from around
	the world, each doing their little piece -- truly users banded
	together!
<p>
	So where do Microsoft and others fit into this picture?
	DOS/Windows is just one of many systems sprung out of the
	fountain of Truth -- though there is much debate as to how
	much truth has rubbed off on them. :-) 
<p>
	There is a huge cultural barrier between the Unix camp and
	the other guys.  It took DEC a decade before the DEC Unix
	Engineering Group was formed, and when it was, it was located
	in a separate location from the rest of the company.
<p>
	Salus tells the story in the book:
<br>	there was a lot of animosity towards Unix up and down the
	company at DEC.  Armando Stettner relates how Dave Cutler,
	one of DEC's engineering elite, at one point got two Unix
	engineers, Armando Stettner himself and Bill Shannon, to
	drive down to his office 20 minutes away to help him with,
	Armando thinks it was, some SRI package on top of VMS.
	They got there and Cutler was in his office.  Armando and
	Bill sat down at a terminal, and it just didn't do what
	they expected it to do.  Cutler asked them how it was, and
	Armando replied that it didn't work.  To this Cutler said
	"Well, thank you very much" and they were dismissed.
	Cutler then called their Senior Group Manager and chewed
	him out and said Armando and Bill were sorry excuses for
	engineers and he never wanted to see them in Spitbrook
	(his office) again.  Armando believes that Cutler's
	disdain has been reflected in his work ever since.
	Armando says:
<UL><p><DL>
		Cutler was doing yet another OS based on a new
		architecture called Prism, not Unix, during
		Digital's internal RISC wars.  Initially,
		Cutler's OS wasn't portable, but was culturally
		compatible with VMS.  There is a lot of stuff
		in NT that I think can be traced to Prism.
		[Cutler went to work for Microsoft around 1983.]
</DL><p></UL>
<br>
<p>
	To round this off I'd like to itemize a few general factors
	for the success of Unix:
<UL><p><DL>
		Simplicity
<p>
		Small projects
<p>
		No restrictions put on creativity
<p>
		Freedom
<p>
		Free source
<p>
		Fun
<p>
		Collect a lot of great ideas that are around plus
		some original ideas and put them together in a very
		interesting, powerful way.
<p>
		Users supporting themselves
<p>
		Internet
<p>
		Portability
<p>
		Universality
<p>
		Stability -- i.e., the antithesis of the continuous
		change needed to keep the DOS/Windows personal computer
		market alive.  System programs don't need to change.
		Well designed OS's don't need fundamental changes.
		No need to do Windows 95 this year, Windows 97 the next
		and then NT.  Just stick with what works!
<p>
		"Us against them" -- thanks AT&T, DEC and Microsoft!
</DL><p></UL>
<br>
<p>
	There must be a fundamental difference of thinking between
	the free software camp and the other guys:
<p> 
	The first mind-set is to share in order to gain.  The other
	mind-set is hoarding out of fear that something is going to be
	taken away.  Out of the latter mind-set springs the correct
	business-types managing their various copy-protected products,
	while from the sharing win-win culture, where each person's
	efforts becomes a multiplier toward a common goal, springs an
	open and nonconformistic, somewhat anarchistic type of person.
	The two often do not like or understand each other.
