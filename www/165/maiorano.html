<h1>Encryption with TrueCrypt</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/maiorano.html">Ariel Maiorano</a></b></p>

<h3>About TrueCrypt</h3>

<p>
From its <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org">Web site</a>, we learn that
TrueCrypt is free, open-source disk encryption software for Windows
Vista/XP, Mac OS X, and Linux.  Its more common use would be to create
a virtual encrypted disk within a file (called a volume file), and
mount it as a real disk. Anyhow, it also implements mechanisms to
provide plausible deniability, a hidden volume inside another one, and,
of course, the possibility to encrypt an entire partition or storage
device. Operating system encryption is supported only on Windows at the
moment.  </p>

<p>
Encryption is automatic, real-time (on-the-fly), and transparent.
Regarding this "on-the-fly" property of the way TrueCrypt works, we read in
the official documentation: </p>


<blockquote>
On-the-fly encryption means that data is automatically encrypted or
decrypted right before it is loaded or saved, without any user
intervention. No data stored on an encrypted volume can be read
(decrypted) without using the correct password/keyfile(s) or correct
encryption keys. The entire file system is encrypted (e.g., file names,
folder names, contents of every file, free space, metadata, etc).
</blockquote>


<p>
Although more popular on Windows operating systems <a
href="#ref2">[1]</a>, TrueCrypt runs well on Linux, and its volume files
are fully cross-platform. General <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/">documentation</a> about how to use
the program is mainly focused on the graphical user interface of the
Windows version, but information about how it works, encryption
algorithms, hash algorithms, technical details, etc. is very complete,
and applies also to the Linux version.  </p>


<h3>License conflicts</h3>

<p>
As already mentioned, from the official documentation, we know that
TrueCrypt is free and open-source software. However, despite several
user requests, it has not been included in most popular Linux
distributions and repositories, because of some concerns regarding
TrueCrypt's collective license.<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a>
Major Linux distributors consider it non-free; in this <a
href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/distributions/2008-October/000276.html">post</a>,
for example, from a Red Hat representative, it's explained why they
think that, even if Fedora complies with all of the conditions and/or
obligations imposed by this license, they still would not be protected
from a lawsuit from TrueCrypt. For the Fedora official position
regarding this issue, you should check this  <a
href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ForbiddenItems#TrueCrypt">link</a>,
and, for Ubuntu, this  <a
href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/109701">one</a>.  </p>

<p>
Anyhow, if you plan to redistribute TrueCrypt, or software based on it,
you should probably get some legal help. That being said, you can of
course, download the full source code tree and use it as best suits your
needs in a private way.  </p>

<h3>The algorithms</h3>

<p>
TrueCrypt implements three symmetric block encryption algorithms (also
called ciphers, so there are block ciphers, symmetric key ciphers,
etc.): AES (for Advanced Encryption Standard), Twofish, and Serpent. The
program also can combine the use of ciphers, so, when selecting the
algorithm to use, you'll see options like Serpent-AES or Twofish-Serpent.
The cryptographic hash functions implemented and available in TrueCrypt
are RIPEMD-160, SHA-512, and Whirlpool.  </p>

<p>
If this does not sound familiar to you, know that a block cipher
operates on chunks of data of a fixed length, each one of them is a
block. AES, for example, uses blocks 128 bits long. These blocks consist
of your input: what you want to cipher, usually plaintext. When a cipher
encrypts a block of plaintext, it outputs a transformed block of the
same length, and that's called a block of ciphertext. This is done using
the key, as another input for the cipher process, which also has to be
of a fixed length (up to 256 bits long in Twofish, for example).  </p>

<p>
Another aspect to take into consideration is that an extra step may be
necessary if you are going to encrypt some plaintext larger than the
block cipher block size. In these cases, the implementation chooses (this
being not part of the algorithm itself) a "mode" of operation.  The
ciphertext block of the previously encrypted block of plaintext may be
combined with the actual plaintext block you are going to encrypt. The
mode in which you use an algorithm determines how block processing would
be chained, if processing is to be done at all. For the first block,
when using a chaining mode, of course you don't have any previous
output, so you use what's called an initialization vector (IV), usually
made of random data, that you would make as public as the other
resulting ciphertext blocks.  </p>

<p>
The key is not the array of ASCII characters that forms your password -
not in recent cryptographic implementations, at least - but the output of
a cryptographic hash function applied to that password and a salt.  </p>

<p>
Cryptographic hash functions can take a block of data of arbitrary size
and return a fixed-size output block (128 bits long, for example, for
MD5). This output is called the hash value, and sometimes it's referred
to as the message digest - the message being the input, or simply the
digest. Any change in the input would produce a substantially different
hash value.  </p>

<p>
The salt is a random number generated as part of the input for the hash
function, usually simply concatenated to the password, so that the same
password does not generate the same hash value. It's as public as the
resulting hash, as you'll always need both values to do password
comparison. This way it's harder to dictionary-attack a password.  </p>

<p>
There are standards specifying that the hash function should be
applied repeatedly - a minimum of 1000 iterations is recommended in the
RSA PKCS5 <a
href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2127">standard</a>
- each time hashing the output or hash of the previous iteration, to
finally produce the key bytes to be used as the input key for a
symmetric cipher.  </p>

<p>
Regarding general cryptographic theory, you could check out the online
version of the book <em><a
href="http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac/">Handbook of Applied
Cryptography</a></em>.  A very brief and basic description of every
algorithm follows, but for further reference and a more in-depth
discussion of each one, please refer to the references, and as to how
they're implemented in TrueCrypt, to the program's <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=technical-details">technical
documentation</a>. Also, remember that block ciphers may be used in
different modes of operation. These modes determine the way to chain (or
not) outputs from ciphering each individual block of plaintext, when
this input is larger than the block size. Recent versions of TrueCrypt
use the XTS <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=modes-of-operation">mode</a>
(IEEE 1619 standard).  </p>

<ul>
<li>Symmetric ciphers available in TrueCrypt:

   <ul>
   <li><a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/">AES</a>: Advanced
   Encryption Standard. It was originally published as Rijndael (1998), a
   word derived from the authors names: Joan Daemen and Vincent
   Rijmen. This algorithm was the selected (2001) one in the NIST's AES
   contest, and so the standard specifies it as a FIPS-approved
   (FIPS-197) one that may be used by U.S. Government organizations (and
   others) to protect sensitive information. It has a 128-bit block size,
   with key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.  Rijndael supports other
   block and key sizes, but the former were the only ones selected for the
   AES.  It's worth noting that it has been analyzed extensively and is
   used worldwide.<a href="#2"><strong>[2]</strong> </li>

   <li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/serpent.html">Serpent</a>:
   The algorithm was a finalist in the AES contest, and ended up in second
   place, right after Rijndael. Authors are: Ross Anderson, Eli Biham, and
   Lars Knudsen. Implements a block size of 128 bits long. Its key size
   may be 128, 192, or 256 bits long. First published in 1998.</li>

   <li><a href="http://www.schneier.com/twofish.html">Twofish</a>:
   Another finalist in the AES contest. Authored by: Bruce Schneier, John
   Kelsey, Doug Whiting, David Wagner, Chris Hall, and Niels Ferguson. It
   has a 128-bit block size, and a variable-length key size: a minimum of
   8 bits, a maximum of 256 bits, being a multiple of 8 bits. Also
   published in 1998.</li>
   </ul>

<li>Cryptographic hash functions available:

   <ul>
   <li><a href="http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html">RIPEMD-160</a>:
   The name stands for RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message
   Digest. Authors are: Hans Dobbertin, Antoon Bosselaers, and Bart
   Preneel. It produces a 160-bit-long hash value, but there are other
   versions of the algorithm, as well (RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-256, and
   RIPEMD-320). It was first published in 1996.</li>

   <li><a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2withchangenotice.pdf">SHA-512</a>:
   SHA stands for Secure Hash Algorithm. This one belongs to the the
   SHA-2 family. These functions were designed by the NSA, and published by
   the NIST as a U.S. FIPS, in 2001. As you may already guessed, SHA-512
   generates a 512-bit-long hash.</li>

   <li><a href="http://www.larc.usp.br/~pbarreto/WhirlpoolPage.html">Whirlpool</a>:
   From one of Rijndael authors, Vincent Rijmen, and Paulo
   S. L. M. Barreto. Published in 2000.  It produces a 512-bit-long hash
   value.</li>
   </ul>

</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
We are going to build and install the latest version of TrueCrypt from
source (latest version being 6.2a at the time of this writing, released
June 15, 2009). You could also download .deb and .rpm packages, for
Ubuntu and OpenSUSE respectively, from TrueCrypt's Web site. Of course,
you could go that way if you have one of the two supported Linux
distributions. If not, or if you're running one of these but prefer
compiling the software you will use on your own system, you should
download the source code for Linux/MacOS, and continue reading this
installation section. Note: the .zip package of the source code does not
contain the same files; if you encounter a Microsoft Visual Studio
solution file (.sln) instead of a Makefile, you have downloaded the
Windows version.  </p>

<p>
The documentation tells us that our system should meet the following
requirements for building the software: </p>


<ul>
<li>GNU Make</li>

<li>GNU C++ Compiler 4.0 or compatible</li>

<li>pkg-config</li>

<li>wxWidgets 2.8 shared library and header files installed or
  wxWidgets 2.8 library source code (available at <a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org">http://www.wxwidgets.org</a>)</li>

<li>FUSE library and header files (available at <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">http://fuse.sourceforge.net</a>
  and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macfuse">http://code.google.com/p/macfuse</a>)</li>

<li>RSA Security Inc. PKCS #11 Cryptographic Token Interface (Cryptoki) 2.20
  header files (available at <a href="ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20">ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20</a>)
  located in a standard include path, or in a directory defined by the
  environment variable 'PKCS11_INC'.</li>
</ul>


<p> 
Depending on your Linux distribution, you may already meet most of
these requirements.  (Surely not all of them in default Linux
installations, I'm afraid.) You should, of course, install from
distribution packages or source, as you prefer. The components you'll less
likely have are FUSE and the RSA header files. Also, wxWidgets, if you
didn't need it before. Some quick hints and notes before the step-by-step
installation procedure: </p>

<ol>
<li>If you download FUSE distribution packages, remember to download the
"fuse" or "libfuse" and "libfuse-devel" packages for your
distribution.</li>

<li>Also consider that you'll need kernel sources if you are compiling
FUSE; the package name in most distributions is named
"kernel-devel"</li>

<li>The main RSA header file (pkcs11.h) includes source code comments
indicating that some code should be uncommented before use; don't do
that, because there's no need. The file Common/SecurityToken.h in
TrueCrypt's source has all the #define lines needed.</li>

<li>If you'll build a NOGUI version of TrueCrypt (that is, the NO
Graphical User Interface executable), as we are going to be doing in
this "by example" article, note you still should download the wxWidgets
library source code. However, installing them is not necessary.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Step-by-step installation instructions follow. The only assumption
made is that the files "TrueCrypt 6.2a Source.tar.gz" and
"wxX11-2.8.10.tar.gz" have been placed in the /tmp directory.
TrueCrypt's Web site does not seem to provide a public direct link for
download, and the wx libraries' source code is hosted on Sourceforge, so
you should download those files with your Web browser. PKCS #11 include
files will be downloaded with the wget command. Finally, not all
commands need root access, but, in the examples, I've logged in as root.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@w2 ~]# 
[root@w2 ~]# cd /tmp
[root@w2 tmp]# mkdir pkcs11
[root@w2 tmp]# cd pkcs11
[root@w2 pkcs11]# wget ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20/pkcs11.h
[root@w2 pkcs11]# wget ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20/pkcs11f.h
[root@w2 pkcs11]# wget ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20/pkcs11t.h
[root@w2 pkcs11]# cd ..
[root@w2 tmp]# tar xvfz wxX11-2.8.10.tar.gz
[root@w2 tmp]# tar xvfz "TrueCrypt 6.2a Source.tar.gz"
[root@w2 tmp]# cd truecrypt-6.2a-source/
[root@w2 truecrypt-6.2a-source]# export PKCS11_INC=/tmp/pkcs11
[root@w2 truecrypt-6.2a-source]# make NOGUI=1 WX_ROOT=/tmp/wxX11-2.8.10 wxbuild
[root@w2 truecrypt-6.2a-source]# make NOGUI=1 WXSTATIC=1
[root@w2 truecrypt-6.2a-source]# cd Main
[root@w2 Main]# ./truecrypt --test
[root@w2 Main]# cp truecrypt /usr/local/bin/
</pre>

<p>
Note: after executing truecrypt with the --test option, you should see
<code>Self-tests of all algorithms passed</code>. The TrueCrypt compiled
binary is copied to a system directory manually, because the Makefile
does not provide an "install" target.<a href="#3"><strong>[3]</strong></a>
</p>

<h3>Before you begin...</h3>

<p>
Now, again according to the documentation, some requirements should be
met by our Linux system for running TrueCrypt: </p>


<ul>
<li>Kernel, including FUSE, device mapper, and encryption modules</li>

<li>FUSE library (available at <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net">http://fuse.sourceforge.net</a>)</li>

<li>device mapper tools (available at <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/dm">http://sources.redhat.com/dm</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>

As mentioned before, you may already have most of this software in your
"modern" Linux distribution installation. Also, FUSE for example should
have been installed for the compiling process. Take into account also that
recent Linux kernels already include FUSE. If your system lacks some
component, follow the links described in the official documentation, or
search the Internet for the corresponding packages for your distribution.
</p>

<p>
When done, check that the FUSE kernel module loads; if that goes well,
you should be OK.  </p>

<pre class="code">
[root@w2 tmp]# modprobe fuse
</pre>


<h3>Command-line options</h3>

<p>
The official documentation regarding command-line <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=command-line-usage">options</a>
applies only to the Windows version of TrueCrypt. So, before going on
with a couple of examples on using this software, I'll copy and paste
here the output of what the documentation tells us to do, if we want to
know how to execute TrueCrypt and are on Linux or MacOS; that is, use
the "-h" option. Also, this is a fairly good way of getting an idea of
what a program can do.  </p>

<pre class="code">

</pre>

<p>
Option details and some simple usage examples are also printed, following
this list of command-line options. I'll include in the
following section a couple of standard examples, but with their output,
so you can see exactly how it works.  </p>

<h3>Encrypting</h3>

<p>
Now, we are going to create example volume files, and mount them. These
are the files that are encrypted and decrypted "on the fly" when
mounted. You can think of them as read/write .iso files, for example, but
you won't be using the mount command; you'll use the TrueCrypt binary,
instead. When you work inside the mounted "partition", encryption (and
decryption, of course) takes place automatically.  </p>

<p>
The first thing we are doing, then, is to create a 5 MB standard volume
file. Note we're using the "-t" option, which stands for "Use text user
interface", and the "-c" one, for "Create new volume". This way, we will
be asked for all the information needed to create the volume. We could,
as expected, use other command-line options to determine some of this
information, but I think it's clearer in this manner.  </p>

Having the volume file created, now we are going to mount it and create
a test file in it. We'll create a temporary directory for its mount
point, for testing purposes.  </p>

<p>
At this point, you may get a warning message:
</p>

<pre>
Warning: Your system uses an old version of the Linux kernel.

Due to a bug in the Linux kernel, your system may stop responding when
writing data to a TrueCrypt volume. This problem can be solved by
upgrading the kernel to version 2.6.24 or later.
</pre>

<p>
If you properly installed FUSE and required components, you can safely
disregard this message, and the rest of the mounting process should
continue without any trouble.  </p>

</pre>

<p>
Let's create a test file now, and then unmount the volume. The "-d"
command-line option unmounts all of TrueCrypt's currently mounted
filesystems.  </p>

<pre class="code">
[root@w2 tests]# ls
file.tc  mount_point

<p>
The use of <a
href="http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/?s=keyfiles-technical-details">keyfiles</a>
may add an important security enhancement to the process: It will be
combined with the password in encryption and decryption. Just for
testing, we will use a compressed file; the documentation recommends
this kind of file (mp3, for example) and also randomly generated ones.
You may think of it as a private key. You can of course use a public
available file, but that's the secret you should only share with people
with whom you also share the password. It will serve as a sort of source
of random data.  </p>

<h3>Finally</h3>

<p>
As you could see from the examples, TrueCrypt's command-line mode is not
complicated at all. It's a powerful tool to rapidly secure files using
strong cryptography and easily move them around. (The volume file may be
copied to a pen drive, and then be mounted on a Windows system, for
example.) It runs on Linux, it's well documented, it's free, and you
have access to its source code.  From a cryptographic point of view,
the implementation of robust, modern, and well known algorithms, the
lifetime of the program, and its popularity, may give you some
confidence.  </p>

A close reading of the current 
<a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/legal/license">TrueCrypt License 
Version 2.7</a> suggests, in my opinion as a software licensing geek,
that TrueCrypt Foundation has now managed to fix all the problems cited by 
<a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/distributions/2008-October/000276.html">Red Hat Legal</a> (relayed by Tom Calloway), the <a
href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/109701">Ubuntu</a>
packagers, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/07/msg00009.html">Debian
developers</a>, and <a

<p>

<p>
The cited Fedora wiki page still <a
href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/ForbiddenItems#TrueCrypt">claims</a>
that the licence is still proprietary, but that judgement seems 
(my best guess) to concern an earlier licence version, probably 2.5.
</p>

<p>
TrueCrypt License remains unapproved by OSI (because it's Yet Another
Regrettable One-Off Licence, and more to the point hasn't been submitted for
certification), but in its latest version nonetheless appears to be fully
compliant with the Open Source Definition.

<p>[2] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:
This testing is one of the best arguments for AES/Rijndael, and the
reasons why are worth elaborating on.  Elsewhere in software, it's often
assumed that newer algorithms are better, so new ciphers ought, in
general, to be more trustworthy.  In cryptography, though, it's the
other way around.  New ciphers, however impressive their specifications
and design might be, are treated warily in favour of well-tested 
alternatives, the older the better.  Thus, in the competition that
led to the selection of Rijndael as the Advanced Encryption Standard,
Bruce Schneier's Twofish algorithm seemed, superficially, to have the 
edge on his earlier Blowfish cipher -- but, in fact, Blowfish is
more-trusted of the two, as it's withstood much more, more varied, and
more protracted attacks by expert cryptographers, without breaking.

It is a good practice to download, uncompress, and compile everything with a
different user than root. You need root privileges only for installing
the software. On every system, I have a build user that prepares
everything; root only installs it. Be aware that most Makefiles and
configure scripts consist of code that runs on your machine. Nobody's
perfect, and, if these scripts fail, the damage will be less if you use a
dedicated build user account with no privileges.</p>
