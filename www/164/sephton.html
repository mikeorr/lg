<h1>Understanding Full Text Search in PostgreSQL</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/sephton.html">Paul Sephton</a></b></p>


<P>Those who have yet to enter their first search query in Google,
Yahoo, or any of the myriad of other search engines available to the
web, or have no interest in the use of PostgreSQL as a database
engine to implement their own text search facility will find little
use in reading further.</P>
<P>Although PostgreSQL coverage on the topic of Free Text Search is
as good as the rest of their excellent documentation, the following
might serve as an introduction to those who would further persue the
topic.  In the interest of conciseness, this article skips quite a
lot of detail and depends on the ability of the reader to infer what
is not explicitly stated.</P>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<P>Full Text Search (or FTS) is not a new technology. The earliest
recorded patents related to the search for documents about a given
topic were filed in the year 1963, more than forty-five years ago.
These patents include &quot;<I>CONTENT ADDRESSABLE MEMORY APPARATUS</I>&quot;
(US Pat. 3290659 - Filed Dec 30, 1963), &quot;<I>SCAN CONTROL, AND
NORMALIZATION FOR A CHARACTER RECOGNITION SYSTEM</I>&quot; (US Pat.
3295105 - Filed Aug 27, 1964) and &quot;<I>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
AND METHOD</I>&quot; (US Pat. RE26429 - Filed Dec 8, 1964).</P>
<P>To this day, the ability to impose structure upon the dearth of
what is known as &quot;Unstructured Data&quot;, in order to turn this
haystack into an information system, continues to challenge the
finest minds.</P>
<P>The long list of granted patents persists through 2006 and 2007,
namely &quot;<I>Device and system for information management</I>&quot; (US
Pat. 7376273 - Filed Jun 1, 2007 - Silverbrook Research Pty Ltd),
&quot;<I>Metasearching by sending a plurality of queries to a plurality
of servers</I>&quot; (US Pat. 7277918 - Filed Jan 16, 2007) and
&quot;<I>Distributed internet based speech recognition system with
natural language ...</I>&quot; (US Pat. 7203646 - Filed May 22, 2006 -
Phoenix Solutions, Inc.)</P>
<P>Of course, we know today that &quot;Full Text Search&quot; is far from
the only way to organise documents. A close runner up, though unable
to reproduce the exact features of FTS, is the Bayesean search; a
statistical means of indexing documents which determines the
probabability that two documents are similar. Bayesean search has an
almost uncanny knack of deriving the essence of documents rather than
depending on a literal text match. The most common use of Bayesean
search technology today is in spam filters, although engines such as
<A HREF="http://www.altsearchengines.com/2009/05/06/hope-dyves-deep-in-her-review-of-deepdyve/">DeepDyve</A>
demonstrates a more ambitious use.</P>
<P>Several SQL databases already have a built-in implementation of
FTS, notably servers such as Oracle, SQL Server, and the free MySQL
and PostgreSQL servers. 
</P>
<P>MySQL native FTS is currently only available against the MyISAM
database back-end, and is not yet available for the more popular
InnoDB back-end. For Postgres, the earliest implementation of FTS was
the TSearch module, replaced in version 7.4 with Tsearch2, and
finally included in the core PostgreSQL engine in version 8.3. 
</P>
<P>There are many implementations of external FTS engines which may
be used in conjunction with SQL database engines, or individually.
These include <A HREF="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</A>, which
is a very powerful and popular engine implemented as part of the
Apache project, <A HREF="http://swish-e.org/">Swish-E</A>, and the
<A HREF="http://sphinxsearch.com/">Sphynx</A> search engine, which
has been steadily gaining in popularity.</P>
<P>Lucene is really a library against which programmers may develop
search products. Their site has many links to generic products
already developed against the library, including interfaces for Java
(the original interface), PHP and DotNet. Sphynx is particularly
popular amongst MySQL developers, as this engine supports both MyISAM
as well as InnoDB database back-ends.</P>
<h3>PostgreSQL Full Text Search</h3>
<P>In a nutshell, Full Text Search is implemented by indexing the
words contained in a document, and associated the indexed words with
a reference to the document. Subsequently, searches for a 
<A HREF="http://www.iqlue.com/prosearch/topics/Boolean Phrase.htm"><I>boolean
phrase</I></A> using operators <I>and</I>, <I>or</I>, <I>not</I> and
braces may be matched against the index to locate documents
containing the words in the phrase.  PostgreSQL does not currently
support the fuzzy logic operators <I>near</I>, <I>far</I> or <I>strip</I>.</P>
<H3>Eliminating redundancy</H3>
<P>Clearly, indexing every single word in a document would result in
a very large index. This is neither required, nor is it particularly
useful. For example, one might convert all text to lower case prior
to indexing the words, making your searches insensitive to case, and
simultaneously achieving a smaller index. Then one might eliminate
words from the text which carry no real meaning (like 'and', 'or',
'the', 'for', etc.) as these words would be likely found in most
documents already. The first approach is called <I>normalisation</I>,
and the second process is called <I>stop word elimination</I>.</P>
<P>Finally, one might further reduce the size of the index by
replacing words with others which have an identical or similar
meaning. Thus one may replace instances of 'hungrily' and 'hungry'
with 'hunger'. This process is called <I>dictionary substitution</I>.
</P>
<P>Further algorithmic measures (see <A HREF="http://snowball.tartarus.org/">Snoball</A>)[Ref.
4] may be performed to further reduce words to their essential
meaning prior to the article being indexed. The replacement of colour
names with their hexadecimal equivalents and the reduction of numeric
values by reducing precision are other ways of <I>normalising</I> the
text.</P>
<P>All of these measures are to eliminate <I>redundancy</I> from the
indexed text, thereby reducing index size and resulting in less
storage requirement, less disk I/O, faster indexing and a
consequently faster search.</P>
<H3>PostgreSQL Dictionaries</H3>
<P>To aid in the process of normalisation and elimination of
redundancy from text, PostgreSQL provides templates for several types
of dictionary for use in a text search configuration. These are the
Simple Dictionary, the Synonym Dictionary, the Thesaurus Dictionary,
the iSpell Dictionary and the Snoball [Ref.4] Dictionary.</P>
<P>The Simple Dictionary eliminates stop words, and performs case
normalisation. The Synonym Dictionary replaces one word with another,
Thesaurus Dictionaries provide for industry specific phrase
recognition, and the iSpell template may be used to embed any of the
standard iSpell dictionaries available from <A HREF="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.Org</A>.
The Snoball[Ref.4] dictionaries, which perform algorithmic stemming
and stop word elimination are included by default for a variety of
languages in the PostgreSQL installation.</P>
<P>With PostgreSQL, all dictionaries are functionally equivalent,
with the possible exception of the thesaurus type. Effectively, they
consume a word (or token), and return an array of <I>lexemes</I>, or
NULL. When a dictionary returns NULL, the token is considered to be
unrecognised. This allows dictionaries to be strung together, with
the most general dictionary at the end of the list. Thus, if a
dictionary earlier in the list returns a word, further dictionaries
in the list are ignored. However, where an earlier dictionary returns
NULL, the token is processed by subsequent dictionaries in the list.</P>
<P>A <I>lexeme</I> is the equivalent of a token which has been
converted to it's base form. Before being passed to the dictionary,
PostgreSQL converts the <I>document text</I> into an array of tokens
through means of a simple parser. The parser is able to identify
various types of tokens from the text, such as XML or HTML tags,
integer or floating point numbers, version numbers, URL's, host names
and so forth. PostgreSQL provides the ability to process different
token types specifically, by mapping a given token type to different
dictionary lists.</P>
<H3>Text Search Configuration</H3>
<P>Note that although PostgreSQL provides a lot of configurability,
the base installation already provides a workable configuration.
Unless there is a specific reason, it is probably not necessary to
mess with it. Even so, an example text search configuration would be
the following:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION public.my_config (COPY=pg_catalog.english );</PRE><P>
Now, having a new text search configuration, we can create a new
dictionary:</P>
<PRE>CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english_ispell (
    TEMPLATE = ispell,
    DictFile = english,
    AffFile = english,
    StopWords = english
);</PRE><P>
In the above, we created a dictionary based on the iSpell template,
where DictFile, AffFile and StopWords refer to files in the
<I>`pg_config –share`\tsearch_data\</I> directory, called
<I>english.dict</I>, <I>english.affix</I>, and <I>english.stop</I>
respectively.</P>
<P>We can then add this dictionary into a configuration like this:</P>
<PRE>ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION my_config
    ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword, asciihword, hword_asciipart,
                      word, hword, hword_part
    WITH english_ispell, english_stem;</PRE><P>
This adds our new dictionary to our new text search configuration,
overriding the default <I>lexeme</I> types (asciiword etc.) to ensure
that they are processed through both the <I>english_ispell</I> and
<I>english_stem</I> dictionaries. We can then start using our new
text search configuration by changing the global parameter
<I>default_text_search_config</I>:</P>
<PRE STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5cm">SET default_text_search_config = 'public.my_config';</PRE><P>
The above parameter will apply for the duration of the session, or
until it is changed. To make the configuration permanent, one would
need to set it in the <I>data/postgresql.conf</I> file.</P>
<H3>Search Vectors</H3>
<P>All of this is very impressive, but how does one turn document
content into an array of lexemes using the parser and dictionaries?
How does one match a search criterion ti body text?  PostgreSQL
provides a number of functions to do this. The first one we will look
at is <I>to_tsvector()</I>.</P>
<P>A <I>tsvector</I> is an internal data type containing an array of
lexemes with position information. The lexeme positions are used when
searching, to <I>rank</I> the search result based on proximity and
other information. One may control the ranking by labelling the
different portions which make up the search document content, for
example the title, body and abstract may be weighted differently
during search by labelling these sections differently. The section
labels, quite simply A,B,C &amp; D, are associated with the <I>tsvector</I>
at the time it is created, but the weight modifiers associated with
those labels may be controlled after the fact.</P>
<P>We can create a tsvector for text like this:</P>
<PRE>bob=# select to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing');
                     to_tsvector                      
------------------------------------------------------
 'free':1 'text':2 'thing':7 'search':3 'wonderful':6
(1 row)</PRE><H3>
Assigning Weight Labels</H3>
<P>As may be seen, the tsvector is just a list of <I>lexemes</I> with
associated positions. The stop words such as 'a' and 'is' have been
eliminated, and we have everything in lower case. Another example,
adding labels:</P>
<PRE>bob=# select setweight(to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing'),'A');
                         setweight                         
-----------------------------------------------------------
 'free':1A 'text':2A 'thing':7A 'search':3A 'wonderful':6A
(1 row)</PRE><P>
<BR><BR>
</P>
<P>In essence, one may create a new tsvector with lexemes labeled for
different sections of the text using setweight for the various
sections:</P>
<PRE>bob=# select                                                                  
bob-# setweight(to_tsvector('All about search'), 'B') ||
bob-# setweight(to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing'),'A');
                           ?column?                            
---------------------------------------------------------------
 'free':4A 'text':5A 'thing':10A 'search':3B,6A 'wonderful':9A
(1 row)</PRE><P>
Assuming &quot;All about search&quot; was the title, and &quot;Free text
seaRCh is a wonderful Thing&quot; was the body, we have now labelled the
lexemes from the title, together with those from the body. Note that
the word 'All' and 'About' in the title were both considered to be
stop words. Subsequently, one may use the labels to rank the results
depending on weight labelss associated with the title and body. We
will visit this in more detail later.</P>
<H3>Matching Boolean Search Phrases</H3>
<P>But first, how does one go about matching a boolean search phrase
to the tsvector? This is done using the @@ operator. For example:</P>
<PRE>bob=# select to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing') @@ 'wonderful';
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)</PRE><P>
On the other hand 'wonderful' is not exactly a <I>wonderful</I>
example of a boolean phrase, now is it? Nope. It's just ordinary
text. If that text is in the wrong format, for example contains other
words, the query will in fact fail. PostgreSQL provides two functions
which may be used to turn text into a query, represented as the built
in <I>tsquery</I> data type, for subsequent matching against
<I>tsvectors</I>. These are the <I>plainto_tsquery()</I> and
<I>to_tsquery()</I> functions.</P>
<P>The rather limited <I>plainto_tsquery() </I>function simply turns
the text into a <I>tsquery</I> with all the <I>lexemes</I> in that
text qualified by the '&amp;' (or <I>AND</I>) operator:</P>
<PRE>bob=# select plainto_tsquery('wonderful text');   plainto_tsquery    
----------------------
 'wonderful' &amp; 'text'
bob=# select to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing') @@ plainto_tsquery('wonderful text');
 ?column? 
----------
 t
(1 row)</PRE><P>
Where this might be useful, <I>plainto_tsquery()</I> does not provide
for boolean operators other than '&amp;'. <I>to_tsquery()</I> goes a
lot further toward providing a decent boolean phrase. Unfortunately,
it is also rather finicky about the text you throw at it. It will not
accept text which is not separated by '&amp;', '|' or '!'. It does
accept braces, which are used to indicate operator precidence, but
two tokens which translate to different lexemes directly after one
another will cause <I>to_tsquery()</I> to fail.</P>
<PRE>bob=# select to_tsquery('wonderful text');
ERROR:  syntax error in tsquery: &quot;wonderful text&quot;
bob=# select to_tsquery('wonderful | text');
      to_tsquery      
----------------------
 'wonderful' | 'text'</PRE><H3>
Ranking Search Results</H3>
<P>Nevertheless, we may use a <I>tsquery</I> boolean search phrase to
match against any <I>tsvector</I>, or use a <I>tsquery</I> and a
<I>tsvector</I> to produce a ranking by use of either the <I>ts_rank()</I>
or <I>ts_rank_cd()</I> functions. These two functions behave slightly
differently. <I>ts_rank()</I> is considered the 'standard' ranking
function, whilst <I>ts_rank_cd()</I> uses the <I>Cover Density
Ranking</I> algorithm[ref.6], which is more interested in phrases
than in the actual terms of the query itself.</P>
<P>To rank a match, one would use:</P>
<PRE>bob=# select ts_rank(to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing'), to_tsquery('wonderful | thing'));
  ts_rank  
-----------
 0.0607927
(1 row)

bob=# select ts_rank(to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing'), to_tsquery('wonderful &amp; thing'));
  ts_rank  
-----------
 0.0991032
(1 row)

bob=# select ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing'), to_tsquery('wonderful &amp; thing'));
 ts_rank_cd 
------------
        0.1
(1 row)</PRE><P>
Relating this ranking ability back to the subject of tsvector
weights, you will recall</P>
<PRE>bob=# select                                                                  
bob-# setweight(to_tsvector('All about search'), 'B') ||
bob-# setweight(to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing'),'A');
                           ?column?                            
---------------------------------------------------------------
 'free':4A 'text':5A 'thing':10A 'search':3B,6A 'wonderful':9A
(1 row)</PRE><P>
where we labelled the text sections of our document? Now we can do
the following:</P>
<PRE>bob=# select ts_rank(
bob-#  array[0.1,0.1,0.9,0.1],
bob-#  setweight(to_tsvector('All about search'), 'B') || 
bob-#  setweight(to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing'),'A'),
bob-#  to_tsquery('wonderful &amp; search'));
 ts_rank  
----------
 0.328337
(1 row)

bob=# select ts_rank(
bob-#  array[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.9],
bob-#  setweight(to_tsvector('All about search'), 'B') ||
bob-#  setweight(to_tsvector('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing'),'A'),
bob-#  to_tsquery('wonderful &amp; search'));
 ts_rank  
----------
 0.907899
(1 row)</PRE><P>
The <I>array[0.1,0.1,0.9,0.1]</I> which is passed as the initial
argument to ts_rank() takes arguments in order {D,C,B,A}. Since we
labelled our sections A (for the body) and B (for the title), we
first assigned B=0.9, A=0.1 and later B=0.1,A=0.9 in the statements
above. Results of the ranking function differ accordingly.  If not
specified, the optional weights array defaults to {0.1, 0.2, 0.4,
1.0}.</P>
<H3>Indexing TSVectors: The GIST &amp; Gin</H3>
<P>Until now, we have used only the <I>select</I> statement in our
examples to demonstrate the matching between <I>tsvector</I> and
<I>tsquery</I>, and subsequent ranking capabilities of PostgreSQL.
Moving forward we will consider the use of <I>indexes</I> to speed up
searches, and later tackle the real showstopper which we have glossed
over until now: why is <I>to_tsquery</I> so pedantic, and how do we
deal with that?</P>
<P>The two index types supported by PostgreSQL for full text search,
are the <I>GIST</I> index, which is based on hash tables, and the <I>Gin</I>
index which is based upon the Btree.</P>
<P>GIST is really fast in creating indexes. It really stores a hash
table of the terms in the tsvector, and uses a hash of the terms in
the tsquery to find the associated documents. Unfortunately, since
the hash search result is non-deterministic, PostgreSQL has to check
the results of the search, reading all of the articles located and
double check the match before returning the result. For smaller sets
of lexemes, and smaller databases, this works quite well. However,
for really large datasets, the overheads in re-reading the data (or
index) tend to make this approach quite slow.</P>
<P>Gin indexes are deterministic, and there is no implied overhead
after a search using the index, but the downside to Gin is that index
creation slows down logarithmically (thankfully not exponentially) as
the number of entries grows. Whichever index method is chosen should
therefore take the nature of the database and it's size into account.</P>
<P>There are two approaches to using an index. The first of these
creates an index against a function of the data field, and the second
approach is to store a tsvector in an additional field in the table;
this tsvector field is then indexed. For example,</P>
<PRE>CREATE INDEX pgweb_idx ON pgweb 
  USING gin(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || body));</PRE><P>
would create a Gin index using the combination of the title and body
fields. This method is simple, but has an implied overhead: Index
creation has to do additional work, and your search is more complex.
The second approach uses a trigger to populate the dedicated tsvector
field whenever a record is added or deleted from the table:</P>
<PRE>ALTER TABLE pgweb ADD COLUMN tsv tsvector;
UPDATE pgweb SET tsv =
     to_tsvector('english', coalesce(title,'') || ' ' || coalesce(body,''));
CREATE TRIGGER tsvectorupdate BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE
  ON pgweb FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE
  tsvector_update_trigger(tsv, 'pg_catalog.english', title, body);</PRE><P>
Now we simply add, update or remove table rows as normal, and the
trigger populates the <I>tsvector</I> field in the table row, which
in turn updates the index appropriately. Subsequent queries may be
against the <I>tsvector</I> field, and that simplifies the query.</P>
<H3>Search result Markup</H3>
<P>We should mention at this point, before proceeding any further, a
rather useful feature related to text search. PostgreSQL provides the
ability to mark up text based upon the result of a text search. The
function here, is <I>pg_headline()</I>. This function returns text as
a result, with all matching words in the text enclosed in <I>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</I>
HTML tags. It is really easy to use:</P>
<PRE>bob=# select ts_headline('Free text seaRCh is a wonderful Thing',
        to_tsquery('wonderful &amp; thing'));
                 ts_headline                     
-----------------------------------------------------
 Free text seaRCh is a &lt;b&gt;wonderful&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Thing&lt;/b&gt;
(1 row)</PRE><P>
To apply highlights to a matching abstract, one might issue the
command:</P>
<PRE>select ts_headline(abstract, query)
  from pgweb, to_tsquery('wonderful &amp; thing') query, 
  where query @@ tsv;</PRE><H3>
Phrase Search</H3>
<P>Speaking of features, one allegedly missing feature which some
people, particularly users of external text engines continuously
complain about PostgreSQL not having, is <I>phrase search</I>. Here
we refer to the apparent non-existent ability of PostgreSQL's full
text search engine to support the match of indexed <I>literal</I>
phrases in the text.</P>
<P>Just stop to think about it for a moment. What exactly are we
expecting here? How many <I>literal phrases</I> are there in a
document of say 10 words? Let's assume for the moment that the words
are single character words: a,b,c...j. All the possible phrases in
this document are:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">a,ab,abc,abcd...  (10
phrases)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">b,bc,bcd,bcde... (  9
phrases)</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">etc...</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P>Put differently, for a document consisting of (n) words, there are
(n) phrases starting with the first word, n-1 starting with the
second word, n-3 starting with the third word, etc. This translates
to 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm"><I>number of phrases = n/2 * (n+1) =
10/2*(10+1) = 55</I> 
</P>
<P>phrases in a document with just 10 words. For a document of 100
words, we have 5050 phrases! Are we seriously suggesting a literal
phrase index is a good thing? Remember, such an index would have to
contain all words, and could not afford to eliminate redundancy from
the text (eg. Stop words). Not really a practical approach.</P>
<P>How then, do external text search engines support index assisted
literal phrase search? Why, in exactly the same way PostgreSQL does
it! Quite simply, the algorithm goes:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>Turn the text phrase into a boolean search phrase, using the
	'&amp;' operator</P>
	<LI><P>Use the full text search engine to locate the matching
	documents</P>
	<LI><P>For only those documents found, and using the <I>original</I>
	text phrase do a case insensitive text match, eliminating false
	positives</P>
</OL>
<P>For PostgreSQL, case sensitive phrase matching is supported using
the LIKE operator, and case insensitive matching through the ILIKE
operator. Searching for the text 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 2cm"><BR><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><I>free
text and 'Postgres text search'</I></SPAN></P>
<P><BR>the query would go something like this:</P>
<PRE>select headline, ts_rank(tsv, query) 
  from pgweb, to_tsquery('free &amp; text &amp; postgres &amp; search') query
    where tsv @@ query and body ilike '%Postgres text search%';</PRE><P>
... which uses the FTS index to find articles with body text matching
a query, and then for those items finds the intersection matching the
literal text.</P>
<P>Simple, eh?</P>
<H3>Parsing Human Query Strings</H3>
<P>Not quite so simple. How, pray, is a poor developer supposed to
turn the 'human' phrase above into the SQL statement below? This is a
non-trivial task and mores the pity, well beyond the abilities of
some developers. Indeed, this is considered to be a 'show-stopper'
for many people. It involves building a pre-parser to parse the
entered search phrase, the execution of which translates the natural
language search phrase into a SQL statement formatted similarly to
the above.</P>
<P>To end off this article, we include with apologies to YACCers, the
listing of a <a href="misc/sephton/parser.cpp">pre-parser which does
precisely that</a>. The general logic is generic enough to be translated to
almost any language, but the listing shown here is in standard C++. This is
a priority biassed recursive descent parser with no external dependencies.
Feel free to use the code in any way you wish (hereby BSD license).</P>
