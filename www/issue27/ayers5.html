<center><h1>Comparing WordPerfect and LyX</h1></center>

<center>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>Some months ago I bought a copy of SDCorp's Linux port of Corel's
WordPerfect 7, and have spent a fair amount of time learning to use it; during 
the same time-period I have also been using various pre-beta releases of LyX
0.11, and more recently the new 0.12 release.  In this article I will attempt
to compare the two pieces of software, both of which are intended to produce
high-quality printed documents, but which have such radically different
methods of accomplishing this task.  It's not quite an apples-and-oranges
comparison, but approaches that state.

<center><h3>WordPerfect 7</h3></center>

<p>The WordPerfect Corporation is now owned by the Canadian firm Corel, but
a group of former WordPerfect programmers and other employees in Utah
(WordPerfect's former home) have formed a company called SDCorp.  This company 
has ported WordPerfect 7 to Linux and other unix variants, and have made the
port available as a downloadable demo (see their 
<a href="http://www.sdcorp.com/wplinux">web-site</a>); the program is also
available on CDROM.  The demo can be registered by purchasing an e-mailable
key-file.

<p>A few years ago WordPerfect was one of the most popular word-processors
available, first under DOS then later in Windows versions.  It still possesses
a significant user-base, but it has been losing ground recently to the
ubiquitous Microsoft Word word-processors.  Any text-processing system which
uses a proprietary document format is reliant upon either other users making
use of the same format or the availability of high-quality document filters
for translating documents into other formats.  Microsoft has made this
situation more difficult by continually "upgrading" their Word format in a
more-or-less backwards-incompatible fashion, forcing other software firms to
rewrite their document filters.

<p>WP occupies an increasingly rare niche in the text-processing world, as
it's a full-featured word-processor but isn't one component of a massive
"suite" of related programs, such as MS-Word, Applix, and StarOffice (at least
in the Linux version; the Windows version is sold as a suite component).  This
has advantages and disadvantages.  On the plus side you don't have to bother
with making room for components which you might not need, and the tendency
towards bloat is lessened.  On the other hand, some users like the
interoperability of a suite's components, and disk space is cheap these days.
If you want a word-processor which is quick to start up, can print well on
most printers (including inexpensive dot-matrix machines), and does a good job
with included graphics files, WordPerfect is a good choice.  Of course, the
price is a sticking point for Linux users accustomed to high quality free
software.  What you get for the money is a wide variety of good printer
drivers, many input and output filters for different document formats, easy
graphics inclusion, and a time-tested interface and document-processing
engine.  This word-processor is also less memory-hungry than some competing
products, requiring roughly the same resources as does GNU Emacs.

<p>One reason for WordPerfect's popularity is the "reveal codes" feature,
which shows an editable view of the current file with the internal formatting
codes visible.  This gives the user more control of the underlying
text-processing, comparable to but not as extensive as the flexibility LaTeX
tagging allows.  

<p>WordPerfect has its own documentation browser, complete with a handy
topic-search utility.  Unfortunately the help is nowhere near as complete and
detailed as the exhaustive hardcopy manuals which used to be included with the
DOS versions.

<p>Making new fonts available to WordPerfect isn't immediately intuitive;
there is a separate program called <b>xwpfi</b>  in the <i>/shbin10</i>
directory which facilitates this process.  Rod Smith has written an
informative series of web-pages which contain useful techniques for dealing
with WordPerfect and fonts; they are available at 
<a href="http://www.users.fast.net/~rodsmith/wpfonts.html">this site</a>. 

<p>The April 1998 issue of the Linux Journal has a quite favorable review of
WordPerfect written by Michael Shappe.  Since that review was written the
retail price has been reduced, and there is a fifty dollar discount if you
have an old version of WordPerfect or a registered copy of any of several
competing products.  Incidentally, I've never noticed the slight keyboard lag
Michael Shappe mentions in his review; my hardware is roughly equivalent to
his, but for me WordPerfect keeps up with typing as well any text editor under
X. He did mention that his test machine is a laptop, so the difference in
video drivers and screen type may have something to do with his slow response.

<p>SDCorp has recently announced student pricing as well, which brings
the price ($59.00) closer to those of some competing products.

<center><h3>LyX</h3></center>

<p>From the free (or open-source) software world comes a different sort of
program with similar purposes.  Lyx makes no attempt to display the exact
appearance of the document, just a version which is readable and looks good on
the screen.  Rather then WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) the developers
describe it as WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean).  The major difference
is the reliance upon a configured LaTeX installation.  A typical TeTex
installation (the flavor of LaTeX supplied with both Redhat and Debian)
occupies about thirty megabytes of disk-space (add another five to six mb. for
LyX), while a WordPerfect installation needs over seventy.  So a LyX
installation is really more compact, but some people are put off by the
reliance upon LaTeX, as it has a reputation of being abstruse, suited to
academics rather than to ordinary people desiring to compose and print out
nicely-formatted documents.  One of the design goals of LyX is to shield the
user from needing to know too much about LaTeX and how it works, though
provision is made for users who would like to include LaTeX commands directly.

<p>LaTeX users often edit their marked-up text in a text editor (Emacs with
AucTeX is popular), leaving either xdvi or a Postscript previewer such as gv
or ghostscript running so that an updated view of the formatted document can
be viewed at will.  This also works well with LyX, though it will seem to be a
cumbersome approach to users accustomed to the single document view of a
standard word-processor.  Using LyX I more often don't view the formatted
document until a late draft, as the LyX-formatted view, though not identical
to the printed output, is close enough for writing purposes. 

<p>If you have previously tried the last beta release, 0.10.7, 0.12 will come
as a pleasant surprise.  After dozens of developer's releases in the past year
many bugs have been dealt with (and new features added), but even more
significant from a new user's perspective is the greatly improved
documentation.  Several levels of help and introductory document files are
included, ranging from very basic (intended for people who have no experience
with LaTeX) to an exhaustively complete reference manual.  Midway is the very
well-done User's Guide, which helped me get up to speed quickly.  All of the
documentation is available from the menu-bar.  Naturally (since LyX is still
in beta) some of the documentation is still incomplete, but in its current
state it is superior to much of the commercial software documentation I'm
familiar with.

<p>An interesting site-specific document is generated during installation and
is subsequently available from the help-menu.  It's called
<b>LatexConfig.lyx</b>; it consists of an inventory of LaTeX packages found on
your system along with pointers for obtaining useful packages which may be
lacking.

<p>LaTeX (and thus LyX) is unparalleled in its handling of documents with
complex structure, dynamically keeping track of section numbers, footnotes,
and references even in book-length documents.  WordPerfect's abilities in this 
area are sufficient for most needs, but lack some of the dynamic updating LyX
is capable of.

<p>Though most non-academic users have little use for accurate rendering of
mathematical equations, LyX provides an easy-to-use and convenient interface
to LaTeX's mathematical modes.  WordPerfect includes an Equation Editor which
can do most of what LyX can, but it's much less intuitive.  I was able to
enter equations into a LyX document without reading the manual, whereas
WordPerfect's interface is cryptic, and it seems some study of the
documentation would be necessary to get very far with it.

<p>Many LaTeX users are still a little irked that while LyX can convert its
internal format to usable LaTeX, converting an existing LaTeX document still
isn't supported.  Included with the LyX source (though not with binary
distributions) is a Perl script which can do limited conversion from LaTeX to
LyX.  It doesn't work with all documents, but might be worth a try.  This sort
of conversion is planned for a future version of LyX, along with compile-time
user-interface toolkit configurability. In other words, LyX could be compiled
with either the current XForms toolkit, GTK, Qt, or perhaps Motif.  There have
been numerous complaints about the appearance and usability of the XForms
widget-set, with which LyX has been developed; personally I don't think it all
that objectionable, but being able to choose would still be welcome.

<p>Recently Matthias Ettrich, who started the LyX project a couple of years
ago, impulsively (along with one of the main KDE developers) ported LyX to
KDE, using the Qt tool-kit.  Strictly speaking, there was nothing wrong with
doing this, as the source for LyX is free.  But some of the other LyX
developers were unhappy about this, as it raised the possibility of a fork in
the development, and they were informed about this port after the fact.  The
source for the Qt LyX port is available from <a href="ftp://ftp.kde.org">the
main KDE site</a>; it wouldn't compile for me, but you may have better
luck (for some reason, I've never been able to compile the KDE stuff).  After
a few more beta source releases binaries of KLyX will be made available.  

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>These are both high-quality packages, but if either of my two teen-age kids 
needs to type something for school I'll steer them towards WordPerfect.  It
can be immediately be used by someone familiar with MS word-processors.  LyX
has a little more of a learning curve, and its dependence on a working TeX
installation is often seen as a drawback by those unfamiliar with TeX.  Any
up-to-date Linux distribution includes configured TeX packages which are easy
to install.  LyX has the advantage of using a more portable document format;
files saved as LaTeX source can be edited in any text editor.  It's also free, 
and under active development.

<p>Since the initial release of WP 7 for Linux there have been no bug-fixes,
either as revised binaries or patches (that I know of).  I imagine the
resources devoted to working on the SDCorp port hinge on the quantity of
copies sold.  I wonder just how many licenses have been sold; in the free
software world, program enhancements and bug-fixes tend to be proportional to
the number of users and user/developers.  Commercial software doubtless is
affected in similar ways.

<p>In my case, I've been able to get higher-quality printed output with WP
than with LyX, but the reverse is probably true for users with different
printers.  Luckily the demo of WordPerfect will let you determine just how
well the appropriate printer driver works with a specific system.  Rod Smith's
above-mentioned web-pages are an invaluable reference for setting up printers
and fonts for WP, while the LyX documentation contains a good overview of
configuring Ghostscript and dvips for use with LyX.  It's not necessarily an
either-or situation; I like having both programs available, as they each have
their strengths.
