<center><h1>Fit More Text On Your  Console Screen</h1></center>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>This summer a new version of <b>SVGATextMode</b> was released, and
thinking that many Linux users might be unfamiliar with the package, I put
together this review as an introduction to a versatile and useful console
utility.

<p>Typically, Linux distributions use LILO as the boot loader, which refers to
the file <i>/etc/lilo.conf</i> for instructions.  One of the lines in the file
is <kbd>vga = </kbd>, with either the number of a console video mode following
the "=", or the word <i>ask</i>.  If "ask" is specified, the Linux boot
process is interrupted and you are asked which (EGA) video mode you prefer.  An
option (thankfully!) is also provided allowing the user to peruse a menu of
available console video modes, which varies depending on the video chipset.
With my generic S3 Virge card, these modes are offered: 

<ul>
  <li>80x25
  <li>80x50
  <li>80x43
  <li>80x28
  <li>80x30
  <li>80x34
  <li>80x60
  <li>132x25
  <li>132x43
</ul>

<p>It's nice to have a choice of video modes (which determine the screen font 
size) but these boot-time options just scratch the surface of what the newer video cards 
and monitors offer.   SVGATextMode is a utility which borrows some of the
techniques which the X-Window system uses to exploit the resources of your 
video system and applies them to the console screen.

<center><h3>How It Works</h3></center>

<p>SVGATextMode actually reprograms the registers of your video card, allowing 
many more modes than the preprogrammed modes available at boot-up.  It borrows 
some of the techniques used by XFree86 in order to make available more console 
video modes.  The modes provided by your video-card BIOS are EGA modes, and
they run at a low refresh-rate and dot-clock compared to those used by
X-windows.

<p>The program can be either started at boot-time from one of the init-files,
or at any time from the console prompt.  When it starts a configuration file 
(<kbd>/etc/TextConfig</kbd>) is parsed.  The defaults are very conservative.
The file needs to be read and edited before any real advantage can be obtained 
from the program.  This is due to the vast differences in capability between
various video cards and monitors.  As in X configuration, the correct values
for your monitor's horizontal and vertical refresh rates need to be entered in
the <b>TextConfig</b> file.  If you've successfully configured X you shouldn't 
have any problems with SVGATextMode.

<center><h3>Configuration and Use</h3></center>

<p>SVGATextMode is what I consider to be a "mature" package, in that it has
been under development long enough to have received contributions and bugfixes 
from a worldwide community of users.  Many video cards are supported, though I 
don't think quite as many as XFree86 supports.

<p>In the default <kbd>/etc/TextConfig</kbd> file many of the lines are
high-resolution modes contributed by users.  Once you have entered your video
chipset and monitor timings into the file, the command <kbd>SVGATextMode -n
 [mode]</kbd> will let you know if your hardware can support the mode without
actually starting the program.  Once you've found some promising modes just
eliminate the "-n" from the command and with any luck you'll have the new
text mode visible on your console screen.  Possibly the screen will be
corrupted.   Running the SVGAlib utility <b>savetextmode</b> before trying a
new mode, then if corruption appears <b>restoretextmode</b> afterwards ought
to allow recovery of your previous default text mode.  It will take some
experimentation, but the package is very well documented and is worth the
trouble.

<p>There are some included modes with 160-character wide screens, which can be 
very useful while running an editor which allows two 80-character pages to be
displayed side-by-side.  Emacs can do this, and there is a LISP package
available called follow-mode which allows both pages to scroll relative to
each other.

<p>SVGATextMode doesn't just allow more characters to be displayed on the
screen.  Even relatively low-resolution modes will look crisper and be easier
to read due to the higher refresh rates typically used.  The most dramatic
advantages, naturally, are evident with newer, more powerful video-cards and
large monitors, but even with my middle-of-the-road equipment the utility is
well worth using.

<center><h3>Caveats</h3></center>

<p>If you use Dosemu from the console there can be problems.  I have to reset
the text-mode to my old default 80x43 mode before starting Dosemu or I get
unrecoverable corruption requiring a reboot.  I haven't had any problems
switching from a console session to X and back, but, just as with X-windows,
performance varies depending upon the video-card and monitor involved.
Read the documentation; it's very complete and a great help while getting
started.
