<h3><A NAME="tag_greeting"><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50" alt="(?)" border="0">Greetings From Jim Dennis, August 1998</a></H3>

 <p>By now you've probably heard it a dozen times:</p>

	<p align="center"><a href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a> 
		Announces Intent to Support Linux
	<br><a href="http://www.informix.com/">Informix</a> 
		Releases Linux version of their SQL Engine</p>

 <p>... so, what does that mean.</p>

 <p>Well, the good part is that Linux will get more respect from many IT
 departments.  It will be easier for sysadmins to recommend Linux,
 FreeBSD, and similar solutions.  There also will be a flurry of other
 software companies that will also jump in and port their software to
 this new, upstart Unix implementation. The Informix announcement 
 was re-iterated at just about the same time and Inprise (formerly
 Borland) had already made Interbase available awhile back).  I expect
 that Lotus Notes and Domino aren't too far behind, and I wouldn't be
 surprised to hear that SAP (publishers of the R/3 ERP system) were
 quietly talking to <a href="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</a>  
(I seem to have heard that Adabas is one
 of the supported db engines for SAP R/3, and that has been available
 for Linux for some time).</p>

 <p>There's also an interesting teaser at the Caldera website
 (<a href="http://www.caldera.com/openlinux/index.html"
 	>http://www.caldera.com/openlinux/index.html</a>)
 regarding an impending
 "Netware for Linux" --- which should be an interesting server
 platform (Netware's implementation of ACL's, access control lists --
 always seemed better then the others I've seen.  So, if you really
 need them on a fileserver, this might be the way to go).</p>

 <p>We've also heard that the server software isn't the only niche that's
 discovering Linux.  Regulars of Slashdot 
(<a href="http://www.slashdot.org/"
	<http://www.slashdot.org</a>)
 and the Linux Weekly News (<a href="http://www.lwn.net/"
	>http://www.lwn.net</a>), and any of the major
 Linux newsgroups and mailing lists are also probably aware that 
<a href="http://www.corel.com/">Corel</a>
 has announced projects to port their whole office suite to Linux
 (they've had versions of WordPerfect available for awhile, and one of
 their affiliates, 
Corel Computing 
--- a hardware concern --- is using
 a StrongARM port of Linux which they helped develop as the core of
 their NC --- network computer).  Presumably they will also consider
 porting their flagship CorelDraw package, which has been been
 available for some other Unix platforms for some time).</p>

	<blockquote><code>
	<a href=">http://www.corel.com/news/1998/may/linux.htm"
	>http://www.corel.com/news/1998/may/linux.htm</a></code></blockquote>

 <p>Of course it's already joining the fray with Applixware, StarOffice, 
 Cliq Suite, Wingz, XessLite, and NeXS, among others.</p>

 <p>So, the commercial software is coming.  Linux will take yet another
 step from hobbyist "do-it-yourself" project towards a widespread
 platform for the masses. </p>

 <p>Is there a downside to all of this?  Naturally there are some
 risks.  While I welcome the availability of Oracle, Informix and
 other major players to the Linux world --- I'd like to remind 
 everyone that there are alternatives.  See Christopher B. Browne's
 excellent list of these under his website at:</p>

	<blockquote><code><a href="http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/"
	>http://www.hex.net/~cbbrowne/</a></code></blockquote>

 <p>... Some of the commercial SQL engines for Linux that I've heard good 
 reports about are Solid, JustLogic, and Infoflex.  That's not to
 mention the free and shareware packages like PostgreSQL, mSQL, MySQL,
 and Beagle.  </p>

 <p>(There are differences in capacity and scalability --- many of these
  are currently limited to table locking rather than being able to 
  lock individual records).</p>

 <p>The big risk we now face is that we'll adopt and promote (or 
 perpetuate) some application suite or tool with a proprietary set
 of file formats or interfaces.  If Microsoft were to ship MS
 Office for Linux tomorrow --- we'd have the same essential problem
 that we have today.  When someone sends you a Word .DOC, an Excel
 .XLS or a PowerPoint .PPT you're expected (by an alarming percentage
 of your correspondents) to be able to handle those files.  </p>

 <p>Everyone, (freeware and commercial third party vendors alike) is
 has been playing "catch-up" to this tune for far too long.  </p>

 <p>This issue of "open document formats" is far more important than
 choice of operating systems.  What you run on your machine is 
 none of my business.  What you send to me in our business transactions
 is.  Applix and StarOffice (and the free 'catdoc' and LAOLA filters)
 make a truly valiant effort to deal with some of these proprietary
 formats.  They do so with some success (Word 2.0 seems fine, Word 
 6.x might be a bit dicey --- Word '97 documents die a horrible death).</p>

 <p>If Microsoft moved quickly they might be able to "take over the
 Linux desktop" by providing "MS Office '98 for Linux."  Personally 
 I think that would be a shame.  I think it would squelch some of the
 interesting work being done on LyX and Cicero, and various other 
 "word processor" and desktop publishing interfaces for Linux.</p>

 <p>So, before you rush out to embrace Oracle, and buy one of their
 servers --- take a look at some of the other DBMS packages that 
 are out there.  Give them a real try (feasibility and capacity
 test) before you commit.</p>
 
 <p>On another note: I'd like to grant the first "Answer Guy 
 Support Award" of the month to Sam Trenholme.  He practically
 owns the <a href="news:comp.linux.misc">comp.linux.misc</a> 
newsgroups and answers alot more questions
 there than I get to in a month here.  Thanks, Sam.  We all owe, ya!</p>

 <p>(I'll try to give these out about once a month --- to someone,
 somewhere, who answers lots of questions in some Linux tech support
 venue).</p>


 <p>One final tidbit:  I guess the press isn't getting all mushy on us.
 Either someone at Miller-Freeman's _sysadmin_Magazine_ doesn't 
 like Linux or they were typing too fast when they wrote:</p>

	<p>.... Linux is a 2-bit multi-user, multitasking variant 
	of the UNIX operating system.
		(p 68, August, 1998; vol. 7 no. 8)</p>
 
 <p>Can anyone find an extra 30-bits to send them?</p>
