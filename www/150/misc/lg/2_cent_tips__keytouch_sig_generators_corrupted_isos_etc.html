<p>
Hello, all.
On my laptop, I've got those lovely little function keys which, by default, do 
absolutely NOTHING in Linux.  However, all that can change!
</p>

<p>
I've found with my current distro, PCLinuxOS, a handy little utility called 
<strong>KeyTouch</strong>.  This program allows you to map your keys to what they are supposed 
to do.  You can easily map your keys like this, and, from what I understand, 
this doesn't work just with laptops, but also with multimedia keyboard, 
microsoft keyboards, and so forth.  Very useful.
</p>

<p>
Now, on my laptop, I've got one of those buttons which, I suspect, is supposed 
to change the power usage profile in Windows.  However, I've found a more 
useful job for it to do.  In keytouch-editor, I have it set so that when that 
key combo is pressed, it will run:
<pre>
kdialog --passivepopup "`acpi`"
</pre>
which pops up a little 'speech bubble' to show me the current battery status, 
as well as time remaining for discharge or recharging the battery.  Very 
useful, in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
What else do I have?  Oh, yes.  In Compiz-Fusion, there seems to be a bug with 
the alt-tab application switcher, which will occasionally kill off the 
Emerald window manager.  I thought it was a bug with the keyboard shortcut, 
until I remapped it to win-tab and it would still kill it.  So, if this is 
annoying you, disable the "Application Switcher" module, enable something 
like 
<b>"Ring Switcher"</b>, and map it to Alt-Tab.  Just like that, the decoration 
issue is solved.
</p>

<p>
Ever wondered how people get those 
<b>static-yet-dynamic sig-generators</b>?  It's 
easy to do, with a simple bash script.
First, create a file, let's call it sig.  Put in the information that you are 
wanting to stay static.  Make sure that there is an empty line at the end of 
the file.  Now, you probably want to use something like fortune to get the 
changing part of the sig, right?  Here's a shell script I use, called sig.sh:
<pre>
---8&lt;---
#!/bin/bash
cat ~/sig
/usr/games/fortune
---&gt;8---
</pre>
Set this little script to be executable, then go to the mail client of your 
choice, tell it to get the sig from a program, and tell it to use your 
sig.sh.  
</p>

<p>
And, finally, 
<b>corrupted ISO downloads</b>. A friend taught me how to fix these:  
If your ISO is corrupted, it seems like all you have to do to fix it is to 
create/get a torrent of it, stick the corrupted download in the directory 
where the ISO will be downloaded to by default, and let the torrent system 
correct it for you!  
</p>

<p>
Hope that these may help some users, will be giving more when I can think of 
some more!

Why not (at a fundamental level):
</p>

<pre>
echo "Random stuff" &gt; ~/.sig
echo -e "More stuff\n\n" &gt;&gt; ~/.sig
fortune &gt;&gt; ~/.sig
</pre>

<p>
Note though that blindly using fortune without vetting or command-line
options is misguided.  Thankfully you won't get any nasties with this,
but at the <strong>very</strong> least consider using:
</p>

<pre>
fortune -n ...
</pre>

<p>
To limit potentially long fortune cookies, and breaking the &gt;5 line
rule of ~/.signature files.
</p>

<p>
It's a nice tip, but to be honest this particular one has been done to
death countless times over; there's much better randomising sig
generators out there than this one.

Jon's script produces output on STDOUT rather than a .sig file. Although
I agree with the principle of what you're talking about, emulating its
action would be more like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
/bin/cat &lt;&lt;!
Random stuff
More random stuff
 
!
/usr/games/fortune
</pre>

<pre>
&gt; Note though that blindly using fortune without vetting or command-line

<p>
Yes, that could be a mistake,

Actually, it seems reasonable - sort of like breaking up a large file
into chunks, then rsyncing it against the "correct" set of chunks
elsewhere. I'm not particularly hip to Torrent, but I <em>think</em> that's how
it works overall - in which case, that's a very nifty solution.

Kind of - if you can /get/ a torrent of that ISO[1]. For example,
<a href="http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/">http://www.thoughtpolice.co.uk/</a> have VMWare images of various
distributions available both via HTTP and BitTorrent. Because these
are exactly the same images, that method works - but it could also
depend on the torrent client too (you never know what sort of silly
things made sense at 5am some morning <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<p>
[1] Well, ok, you <strong>could</strong> create your own torrent, but as you would
have to take all of the information from an existing torrent, it seems
a little pointless.

Never heard of it.  How easy is it to use for someone who is usually too lazy 
to read the docs first?

&gt; fortune &gt;&gt; ~/.sig
&gt; ''
</pre>

<p>
Because I like having a different fortune for each message I send, and I've 
found that KMail, Thunderbird, Pan, and others all can use the same method, 
making life easier for me.
As I'm sure you know, if you use the 'run a program' option for the sig 
creation in these programs, it'll run the specified program/script, then take 
what it gives on STDOUT, and there's your signature.
</p>

&gt; ''

<p>
Yes, I had forgotten about those options.  And, in Kmail at least, if I don't 
like the sig I get, I can just select sig, delete sig, and then go Edit -&gt; 
Append Signature.
</p>

&gt;

<p>
Oh, I agree there, but not everyone knows about them, and mine does make it 
very easy to change the static portion of the sig without messing up anything 
else, I've found.

I was, now that I go through my chat logs, but the person who asked me about 
whether or not I had the file handy for a torrent, and introduced me to this, 
had previously posted for help for the image he was requesting, a few days 
before.
