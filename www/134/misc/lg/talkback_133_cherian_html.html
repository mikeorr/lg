Having suffered through Ben's many yammerings in TAG about nonportable
shell features, hey Ben, I found another!  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

   -------------------------------------------------
Comments in a Shell
 
In shell scripting, all lines beginning with # are comments.
 
# This is a comment line.
# This is another comment line.
 
You can also have comments that span multiple lines by using a colon and single quotes:
 
:' This is a comment line.
 
Again, this is a comment line.
 
My God, this is yet another comment line.'
   -------------------------------------------------
 
   -------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/zsh
# 
 
:' Good grief.  After all this time, I learn that a colon
   followed by a single tick produces a block comment in
   *nix shel.
 
   That even includes blank lines!
'
 
# usage:
#
#   calc '2 + 7'
#
function calc ()
{
    awk 'BEGIN { OFMT="%f"; print '"$*"'; exit}'
}
# not necessary.
# export -f calc
 
 
# from linuxgazette.net Dec2006
# 
function putargs () {
    IFS="|";
    echo "$*";
}

The fact of the matter is that ':' has no effect at shells apart from
expansion and redirection where possible.

It's a cute trick, but doesn't seem to work as desired as described,
when using my shells. Shell argument splitting matters...

<pre>
:
</pre>
is a builtin, an alias for true.
</p>

<p>
So
<pre>
:'here we go'
</pre>
gives "command not found" (unless ":here we go" is in $PATH, or aliased,
or whatever), but
<pre>
: 'here we go'
</pre>
is the same as 
<pre>
true 'here we go'
</pre>
or
<pre>
true --help
</pre>
which ignores arguments and set $? to zero.
</p>

<p>
(/bin/true is different, of course. That might accept options.)
</p>

<p>
So the original poster is incorrect that it's non-portable, because
it's portably broken everywhere[*].  But if it's fixed to be colon space
stuff, then stuff is ignored unless it contains exposed shell-relevant
command-terminating characters like ; or &amp; or newline. And that should
be portable.
</p>

<p>
[*] you know what I mean.
</p>

<p>
It may be worth a quick typofix to the article at
<a href="../../../133/cherian.html">http://linuxgazette.net/133/cherian.html</a>, unless someone has a shell in
which that syntax does work?
</p>

<p>
I'll get that bit - thanks for pointing it out.
</p>

<p>
Cherian's article has caused me to reevaluate just what I will and won't
accept in terms of article quality. In the past, I just went ahead and
fixed broken articles like this one, even if it took hours and hours of
work. This time, however, at least three people other than me put their
time and effort into that thing - and I still ended up with at least two
hours rewriting it - and it still came out broken. Honestly, I was <strong>so</strong>
damn tired when publication time came around (between driving 700+ miles
to teach a class, teaching that entire week, spending my evenings
driving - sometimes well over a hundred miles - to visit friends and
relatives in the area, and negotiating with a new client on top of all
that), that I just plain missed all that stuff. Mind you, I'd <em>already</em>
fixed a huge bunch of errors - and I suspect that Steve Brown, and maybe
other people as well, had fixed a few things also.
 
We've just come back from DC - I drove all the way home - and I'm wiped
out again. There's a bunch of other stuff that needs to be fixed, as
well... but that's probably not going to happen 'till tomorrow.

Best of all, ": '" does appear to fill my original bill because it does
produce a multi-line block comment, including blank lines.  At least
it does in zsh.

Hi there,

<pre>
&gt; Having suffered through Ben's many yammerings in TAG about nonportable
&gt; shell features, hey Ben, I found another!  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</pre>

<p>
[This is probably not worth a TAG-mail, but I reckon some extra editing
might be in order, so I'll send it here.]
</p>

<p>
While I'm at it, it would probably be worth re-checking the shell
fragments in the article. They may be just transcription errors, but
not all of the examples work as-is.
</p>

<p>
"Step 2" says "/bin/bash". bash scripting is good, but it's not the
same as /bin/sh scripting. If you're going to use sh in the shebang,
you should probably limit yourself to posix features. So using /bin/bash
everywhere in the article may be wise, because...
</p>

<p>
function is a many-shell-ism, but not a /bin/sh-ism. Lose that word,
and it should work everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Ditto for ((initialization; condition; increment/decrement)), but I'm
not aware of a posix replacement off hand.
</p>

<p>
The "spaces around the square brackets for test" was explained in the "if"
section, but they are missing in the "while" section, leading to breakage.
</p>

<p>
This "select/case" works in bash and ksh, but as written fails my zsh and is
unknown to my dash.
</p>

<p>
So: s%#!/bin/sh%#/bin/bash%, and check for incorrect significant
whitespace, and the examples should all be good.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I do have on my home machine:
<pre>
$ ls -l /bin/sh
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root 4 2005-12-03 17:09 /bin/sh -&gt; dash
</pre>
Sometimes it comes in handy <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
