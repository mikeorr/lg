<EM>ESR goes to Microsoft ... and lives to tell about it!</EM>


<p>It was not a normal day here in Seattle.  Eggs were balancing on
end.  The city was shrouded in a most un-summerlike mist and fog.  And
ESR was speaking at Microsoft.

<p>That's right.  Eric S. Raymond was the invited guest of Microsoft
Corporation, and gave a speech to their research group.  June 21st was
indeed a freaky Summer Solstice day here in the Northwest.

<p>Eric went into the belly of the beast ... and lives to tell about
it.  He was kind enough to share his impressions of what went on, via
this e-mail interview.

<p><i><STRONG>Q:</STRONG> Can you give us a general overview of how and why you came to
be invited to speak at Microsoft's Redmond campus?</i>

<p><STRONG>A:</STRONG> I was invited there by a member of one of Microsoft's research
groups that I met at PC Forum 99.  She seemed OK, and offered an
inducement far more interesting than a speaker's fee (about which more
below) so I accepted.
 
<p><i><STRONG>Q:</STRONG> Were you offered a tour of the campus, and/or were you
introduced to any of the &quot;big name&quot; executives of Microsoft?</i>

<p><STRONG>A:</STRONG> No campus tour, no big names.  Though I suppose they might have been
watching the video feed....

<p><i><STRONG>Q:</STRONG> What was the venue like, and how many people showed up for the
event?</i>

<p><STRONG>A:</STRONG> It was a small auditorium.  It looked to me like about 200 people
showed up; it was standing room only, with people stacked against the
walls and sitting in the aisles.

<p><i><STRONG>Q:</STRONG> What were the general themes of your speech/presentation?  How
were they received? </i>

<p><STRONG>A:</STRONG> All the usual ones for anyone who has heard my talks.  Better
reliability through peer review, how Linux beat Brook's Law, open-source
project ownership customs and the reputation incentive, the eight
open-source business models, scaling and complexity effects.

<p><i><STRONG>Q:</STRONG>  A confidential informant tells me the event was broadcast to
all 20,000-plus Redmond employees of Microsoft over their internal
network. 
This same informant also says a fair percentage of those in actual
attendance became somewhat belligerent towards you and your Open Source
message.  Is this true? If so, would you mind elaborating on which parts
of your presentation they took issue with?  For example, were they most
perturbed at the insinuation that Open Source products like Linux are
better in the long run than proprietary systems like MS Windows 2000?</i>

<p><STRONG>A:</STRONG> Yes, there were a few belligerent types.  Typical was one guy who
observed that Oracle has a partial open-source strategy, then
triumphantly announced that Microsoft's earnings per employee are
several times Oracle's, as though this were a conclusive argument on the
technical issues.

<p>It was kind of amusing, really, fielding brickbats from
testosterone-pumped twentysomethings for whom money and Microsoft's
survival are so central that they have trouble grokking that anyone
can truly think outside that box. On some subjects, their brains just
shut down -- the style reminded me a lot of the anonymous cowards on
Slashdot.

<p>One of the Microsoft people, who knew the faces in the audience,
observed to me afterwards that the people from the NT 2000 development
group were particularly defensive.  So, yes, I think my insinuations
were perturbing.  

<p><i><STRONG>Q:</STRONG> Did you notice an overall "mood" or general level of
receptivity held by attendees towards what you had to say?</i>

<p><STRONG>A:</STRONG> More positive than I had expected.  The flamers were a minority, and
they occasionally got stepped on by other audience members.

<p><i><STRONG>Q:</STRONG> Anything else interesting to report from your Microsoft
visit?</i>

<p><STRONG>A:</STRONG> Yes.  One of its co-authors gave me an autographed copy of 
&quot;The Unix-Hater's Handbook&quot; :-) But that doesn't quite mean 
what you think it does -- I had been one of the manuscript reviewers.

<p><i><STRONG>Q:</STRONG> Of course, many may gather that perhaps the most fun and
exciting aspect of your visit was your dinner with science/speculative
fiction authors Greg Bear and Neal Stephenson.  Was that as fun as it
sounds to the rest of us?</i>

<p><STRONG>A:</STRONG> Sure was.  Those dinner plans were what seduced me into going to
Redmond, and I wasn't disappointed.  George Dyson (author of &quot;Darwin
Among the Machines&quot;, and Esther Dyson's brother) was there too.  We
spoke
of many things; science fiction and AI and Turing-computability and
cryptography.  Oh, and Neal solicited my advice on the proper firearm
for dealing with cougars while hiking with his kids.

Put them together in a room, and what do you get?  Rumor has it there
were fireworks.  Who knows what galactic alignments were knocked off
kilter -- it was the Solstice, after all.  We'll never know exactly what
happened over there, at least until a sympathetic mole over in Redmond
e-mails us a RealVideo/MPEG copy of ESR's speech.  Illiad's <a

<p>Thanks very much to <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr">Eric

<h2>Update!</h2>
<p><a href="http://weber.u.washington.edu/~gfish">Matthew Dockrey</a>
offers his eyewitness account of ESR's Microsoft speech.

<p>Monday morning, a friend of mine at Microsoft mentioned he got a
mailing about the ESR presentation and thought he would swing by. Being
an opportunist, I convinced him to sneak me in. Luckily, they weren't
checking badges at any point. Considering how much they value trade
secrets, their security is really quite lax.

<p>The presentation was in a conference room in Building 31 (Research).
It was far too small for the turnout, although my friend reminded me that
this was supposed to be for just the research group.  Getting there 20
minutes late after missing the bus, we were left trying to catch a peek
through the crowd. There was a live video feed as well, and we ended up
watching the first half from 10 meters down the hall on someone's 
computer.

<p>The audience was a very odd mix. Most of the people seemed very
serious and were even taking notes. I did notice someone with a KMFMS
t-shirt, though. Some were very obviously hostile towards the Open
Source approach, but not all. (Not everyone who works at Microsoft
actually uses their products at home, remember.) On the way to the
presentation, I saw an office with <i>Linux Journal</i>s and 
O'Reilly Linux manuals laying about, so not everyone there is ignoring us.

<p>Overall, it was a good presentation. I was generally impressed with
ESR's skills as an orator. He spent most of the time giving a
sociological explanation for why OSS works, or exists at all. Nothing
all that revolutionary (to us): Open Source is a variant of the
&quot;gift-culture&quot; that often forms when groups of people are not
greatly
bounded by material limitations (such as coastal Pacific Native
Americans and really rich people) and therefore take to giving away
wealth as demonstration of their worth. He also detailed the culture of
Open Source projects, the general patterns and taboos (a project is
owned by someone; you don't fork the project unless you have very good
reasons, etc.) and compared this to territoriality, especially the way we
view land ownership. You can homestead land (start a project), buy
land (have the previous project owner give it to you) or squat on unused
land (take over a long-idle project).

<p>I felt the presentation lost a bit of its focus when he moved from
the abstract sociological viewpoint to actual justification for Open
Source in a business model. I think this was largely because he based
some of his arguments on sweeping claims about OSS being generally
better than proprietary, and the audience challenged this. His point
would probably have been better made without being quite so
confrontational here.

<p>He did make a very good point that 95% of software development is for
internal use only, although there was an amusing moment when his survey of
this particular audience did not reflect this. He also touched on the
fact that most revenue from software is based in support, not the
original sale. He mentioned what happened with Zope, but failed to
pursue it. Of all the business arguments for OSS (and I admit I lean
towards RMS's moralism over ESR's practicality), this seems to be the
most relevant.

<p>Overall, it was a very good presentation, and the audience seemed
generally receptive to his ideas. There were some good-natured laughs on
both sides, such as ESR admitting that most of the gift cultures had been
destroyed by disease, or ESR stating a desire to live in a world &quot;where
software doesn't suck&quot; as a valid reason for working on an OSS project. I
found it particularly amusing when, halfway through the presentation, someone
started handing out freshly printed copies of Sunday's <a

User Friendly</a> comic.
