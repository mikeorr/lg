<H2>Prelude</H2> Many cool, flashy MP3 players for Linux
have been around for quite some time, but none of them resemble the One
True UNIX Touch-n-Feel. They are all submissive to the shabby concept
of the so-called Gooey User Interface, and I refuse to mention their
names in this article that is dedicated to the One True UNIX Way of doing
things. After all, the listening experience usually does NOT
involve the eyes, so why not purge those graphical players
to give them a rest while we concentrate on our beautiful music?

<p> But of course, we are dedicated Linux users. (Oh, I heard you
ask why I say Linux instead of UNIX? Hmm, I appreciate careful
readers--hehe). This doesn't mean that we are not as newbie-friendly as
most of the other computer user groups. Absolutely not. So I will
first tell the uninitiated among you what that One True UNIX Way is.
Oh, wait! I heard some of you moaning about some other crappy, loony,
self-assured philosophical nonsense now. Okay, let's kick those
newbies, and I will show you the bread and butter of my
article. <i>Advice for newbies: just pretend you aren't one.</i>

<h2>Sweet Instruments</h2> First, we will look at a command-line MP3
player. Then I will introduce you to some flexible ways of managing MP3
playlists along with some very short shell script snippets and a small
C program to aid in the task. A very useful <code>rename</code> utility
that comes along with the standard <a href="http://www.perl.com">Perl</a>
distribution is briefed also.

<h4>Command-Line MP3 Players</h4>

<p> There are many command-line MP3 players on the market. Oops, I
mean on the Internet. But I only will introduce my favorite one:
<code>alsaplayer-text</code>, which is packaged for <a
href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> already. (The Debian
package name for it is just <code>alsaplayer-text</code>.) The usage
most interesting to us is, for example,

<p><nobr><code>% alsaplayer-text -l 85 -n some.mp3 &gt;/dev/null
2&gt;&amp;1;</code></nobr>

<p>The <code>-l</code> switch controls the volume, with possible values
ranging from 0-100. The <code>-n</code> switch tells it to start in
command-line mode. The ponytail <code>&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code>
is a common trick to suppress the rubbish output. And remember, <i><CODE>man</CODE>
is your friend</i>. The above is enough for us to play with it
using shell scripts. And through shell scripts, we will gain maximum
flexibility in the One True UNIX Way.

<p> Next, we will look at a command-line ID3 tag editor. An ID3 tag is
a bit of information tucked within an MP3 music file that says
something about the MP3 song itself: its title, the artist who performed it,
etc. The ID3 tag editor we will look at is named <code>mp3info</code>, which
was packaged for Debian too. The Debian package name is just
<code>mp3info</code>, which means you can <code>apt-get install
	mp3info</code> very easily. (That is, if you are fortunate enough to be
on a Debian GNU/Linux system.) Now let's see a usage scenario to end our
briefing on the command-line MP3 commanders:

<p>
<pre>
zw@q ~/mp3/chopin % mp3info chopin:revolutionary_etude:robin_alciatore.mp3 
File: chopin:revolutionary_etude:robin_alciatore.mp3
Title:   CHOPIN: "REVOLUTIONARY" ETUDE  Track: 
Artist:  CHOPIN PIANO FAVORITES
Album:                                  Year:  
Comment: http://www.mp3.com/chopinpiano Genre: Blues [0]

zw@q ~/mp3/chopin % 
</pre>

<p>Admittedly, the display isn't very flashy, and the information
presented isn't satisfying. (For example, for a classical piano work,
we want to know more than can be presented in a poor ID3 tag.) Readers
are invited to make their own improvements.

<h4>Prepare for Shell Scripts: Line Randomizer</h4>

<p> One often wants to play songs in a random order. For this purpose, we need a line
randomizer, presened here as <a href="misc/zhaoway/rand.c.txt">rand.c</a>, which can read
some lines (filenames) from <code>stdin</code> and randomize the order of the
lines, and then print them line by line on <code>stdout</code> like this:

<p>
<pre>
zw@q ~/mp3/chopin % ls           
chopin:nocturne_in_c_minor:robin_alciatore.mp3
chopin:nocturne_in_db_major:elena_kuschnerova.mp3
chopin:nocturne_in_e_major:joerg_demus.mp3
chopin:nocturne_in_f#_major:john_bell_young.mp3
chopin:nocturne_in_g_minor:robin_alciatore.mp3
zw@q ~/mp3/chopin % ls|rand
chopin:nocturne_in_g_minor:robin_alciatore.mp3
chopin:nocturne_in_e_major:joerg_demus.mp3
chopin:nocturne_in_db_major:elena_kuschnerova.mp3
chopin:nocturne_in_f#_major:john_bell_young.mp3
chopin:nocturne_in_c_minor:robin_alciatore.mp3
zw@q ~/mp3/chopin % 
</pre>

<h4>Prepare for Shell Scripts: Rename the MP3 File</h4>

<p> When downloading MP3 files from the Internet, you get a lot of
files with spaces in between the filenames, which is a disaster in
shell scripts. Of course, we could fiddle with the magic shell variable
<code>$IFS</code> but I will introduce a handy utility that comes with
the standard Perl distribution to rename a bunch of files
according to some Perl Regex (regular expressions). Ladies and
gentlemen, let's welcome the charming <code>/usr/bin/rename</code>.

<p>
<pre>
zw@q ~/mp3/u2 % ls
u2 all that you can't leave behind new york.mp3
u2 all that you can't leave behind peace on earth.mp3
u2 all that you can't leave behind stuck in a moment you can't get over.mp3
zw@q ~/mp3/u2 % rename 's/^(u2) /$1:/; s/(behind) /$1:/; s/ /_/g' *.mp3
zw@q ~/mp3/u2 % ls
u2:all_that_you_can't_leave_behind:new_york.mp3
u2:all_that_you_can't_leave_behind:peace_on_earth.mp3
u2:all_that_you_can't_leave_behind:stuck_in_a_moment_you_can't_get_over.mp3
zw@q ~/mp3/u2 % 
</pre>

<p> <i>So you want to learn <a href="http://www.perl.com">Perl</a>
now?</i> 

<h4>Use Hard/Symbolic Links to Simulate Playlists</h4>

<p> If you happen to open an MP3 playlist file (filename postfix
<code>*.m3u</code>) with a text editor, you will see that the contents of
the file are no more than some lines of full pathnames to your MP3
music file. So, why don't we get over it and use directories and hard
links or symbolic links to achieve the same effect as a playlist and
to let shell scripts process it more easily (for example, by just
using <code>ls</code>) than to parse a text playlist file?

<p> In our arrangement, you just make a new directory as a playlist
using <code>mkdir</code>, then link the MP3 files that you want
to place in that playlist into that directory by using
<code>ln</code>. If your MP3 file is not on the same filesystem as
your playlist directory, then you have to use symbolic links
(<code>ln -s</code>), but hard links have the advantage that when you
move around your original MP3 file, symbolic links (and traditional
playlists, i.e., those <code>*.m3u</code> files) go dead but
hard links still would work like a charm. Believe me, this feature is
very important. You just don't know how many times you'll want to
move around you MP3 files after they are downloaded from the Internet
or are ripped off a music CD!

<p>
<pre>
zw@q ~/mp3 % ls
chopin  classical-all  debussy  fav  nightly  u2
zw@q ~/mp3 % find chopin                
chopin
chopin/chopin:nocturne_in_db_major:robin_alciatore.mp3

nightly/chopin:nocturne_in_c_minor:robin_alciatore.mp3
</pre>

<h2>In Concert</h2>

<p> With all of the preparations above, the following is a snippet
from my <code>~/.zshrc</code>. It should be very easy to adjust it to
your own favorite shell. There is plenty of room for
enhancements. One obvious thing to do is to use <code>mp3info</code>,
as mentioned above, to get the information about an MP3 song instead of
relying on a filename.

<p>
<pre>
PLAYLISTS=$HOME/mp3

# 1st arg is the playlist to be played
# 2nd arg is the volume to play with

play() {
    # Install the ALSA song card driver.
    if [[ -z ` lsmod | grep snd-card-cmipci ` ]]; then
	sudo modprobe snd-card-cmipci;
    fi
    # Play our MP3 playlist.
    while true; do
	for i in ` find $PLAYLISTS/$1 -name '*.mp3' | rand `; do
	    j=` basename $i | sed -e 's/:/: /g; s/_/ /g; s/,/, /g; s/.mp3$//;' `;
	    echo -n "Playing $j ";
	    alsaplayer-text -l $2 -q -n "$i" >/dev/null 2>&1;
	    echo "DONE.";
	done
    done
}
</pre>

<p> In the above snippet, we first check if the ALSA sound card driver
for Linux is already loaded. If not, we load it by calling
<code>modprobe</code>. My sound card is a <code>C-Media 8738</code>,
the ALSA driver name for it is <code>snd-card-cmipci</code>. This is
probably different on your system. You may not even be using
the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) at all. In this article,
I cannot go much deeper on how to set up your sound system on
Linux. If you have difficulty setting up your sound system, or if you
are interested in ALSA, check the <a
href="http://www.linuxdoc.org">Linux Documentation Project</a> and the
<a href="http://www.alsa-project.org">ALSA</a> Project web pages for
help. (Or turn to your local guru.)

<p> The snippet above keeps playing a playlist and plays all songs
on it in a random order, like the following screenshot shows. While a
song is playing, you even can skip to the end of the song if you don't
like it and jump to the next song by pressing <code>Ctrl-C</code>. By
pressing <code>Ctrl-Z</code> to <code>kill</code> the process, you
can stop it (of course this is not a very elegant stop).

<p>
<pre>
zw@q ~ % play chopin 75
Playing chopin: nocturne in e major: joerg demus DONE.
Playing chopin: nocturne in db major: robin alciatore DONE.
Playing chopin: nocturne for violin and piano: alexander skwortsow, violin DONE.
</pre>

<p> You easily can write your own scripts to achieve your own
satisfaction, providing you use your imagination. Open sesame!
Now it's your turn, dear reader; thanks for coming with me along the One
UNIX Way! So long!

<p>Have fun and good luck!
