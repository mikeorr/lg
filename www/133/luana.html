    <p><a href="#gnuplot4"><em id="sc">gnuplot's</em></a> internal
    programming capabilities are used to plot the continuous and
    segmented versions of the spirograph equations. The segmented
    version, in particular, stretches the program model and
    requires the emulation of internal loops and conditional
    sentences. As a final exercise, we will develop an extensible
    mini-language, mixing <em id="sc">gawk</em> and <em id=

    <h2><a name="Sec:Introduction" id="Sec:Introduction">I.
    Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>Imagine the movement of a small circle that rolls, without
    slipping, on the inside of a rigid circle. Imagine now that the
    small circle has an arm, rigidly attached, with a plotting pen
    fixed at some point. That is a recipe for drawing the <a href=
    "#mw-hypotrochoid">hypotrochoid</a>, a member of a large family
    of curves including epitrochoids (the moving circle rolls on
    the outside of the fixed one), cycloids (the pen is on the edge
    of the rolling circle), and roulettes (several forms rolling on
    many different types of curves) in general.</p>

    <p>The concept of wheels rolling on wheels can, in fact, be
    generalized to any number of embedded elements. Complex lathe
    engines, known as <em>Guilloch&eacute;</em> machines, have been
    used since the 17th or 18th century for engraving beautiful
    designs onto watches, jewels, and other items of fine
    craftsmanship. Many sources attribute the first use of <a href=
    "#Perez2000">Gilloch&eacute; engravings on a watch</a> to
    Abraham-Louis Breguet in 1786, but the technique was already in
    use on jewelry. Ancient machines are still being used, and can
    be seen at the <a href="#RGM2006">RGM Watch Company
    Web pages</a>. Intricate Guilloch&eacute; patterns are usually
    incorporated on bank notes and official documents to prevent
    forgery. The name "Spirograph" comes, actually, from the trade
    name of a toy invented in 1962 by Denys Fisher, a British
    electronic engineer, and licensed to several toy companies over
    the years.</p>

    <p>Our purpose, however, is not to explore the history or even
    the mathematical aspects of the Spirograph decorations: our
    interest is centered on the techniques needed to use <em id=
    "sc">gnuplot</em> as the drawing engine of the cycloid-related
    curves.</p>

    <p><a href="#Sec:hypotrochoid">Section II</a> presents a simple
    derivation for the hypotrochoid equations and discusses a
    generalization to any number of rolling wheels described by
    <a href="#nw-Farris1996">F. Farris</a>. <a href=
    "#Sec:render">Section III</a> describes the techniques required
    to draw the cycloid-related curves with <em id=
    "sc">gnuplot</em>. From the use of complex arithmetic to the
    simulation of an implicit do loop and the recursive definition
    of user functions, <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> offers a large
    capability for the creation of algorithmic designs. The
    techniques discussed in <a href="#Sec:render">Section III</a>
    are embedded within a simple <em id="sc">gawk</em> filter that
    reads a formal description of a cycloid pattern and uses
    <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> to produce the final plot. The design
    of this filter is the subject of <a href=
    "#Sec:combining">Section IV</a>.</p>

    <h2><a name="Sec:hypotrochoid" id="Sec:hypotrochoid">II. The
    hypotrochoid and some related curves</a></h2>

    <p><a href="fig:spiro01">Figure 1</a> shows the formation of a
    hypotrochoid and will help us in determining the parametric
    equations for the curve. Three lengths determine the shape of
    the curve: R, the radius of the fixed circle; r, the radius of
    the moving circle; and p, the distance from the pen to the
    moving circle center. The center of the fixed circle, point O,
    will serve as the origin of the coordinate system. Points O'
    and P designate the current position of the rolling circle
    center and of the pen, respectively.</p>

    <p id="figure"><a name="fig:spiro01" id="fig:spiro01"><img width=388 height=390 src="misc/luana/fig-spiro01.png" alt="Formation of a hypotrochoid curve">
</a><br>
    <b>Figure 1</b> Geometry for the hypotrochoid equations. The
    grayed figure corresponds to R=9, r=2, and p=3.</p>

    <p>The current position for O' is easily described in circular
    coordinates: fixed length <img width=114 height=22 src="misc/luana/eqs-008.png" alt="length(OO') = (R-r)">
 and variable
    angle <img width=11 height=12 src="misc/luana/eqs-009.png" alt="\varphi">
. This is easily translated into Cartesian
    coordinates:</p>

    <p id="eq"><a name="eqn-01" id="eqn-01"><img width=364 height=19 src="misc/luana/eqn-01.png" alt="x_{OO'} = (R-r) \cos\varphi, y_{OO'} = (R-r) \sin\varphi."
>
</a></p>

    <p>Similarly, the position of the pen relative to O' is also
    simple to describe in circular coordinates: fixed length
    <img width=64 height=19 src="misc/luana/eqs-010.png" alt="length(O'P) = p">
 and variable angle <img width=103 height=17 src="misc/luana/eqs-011.png" alt="2\pi-\beta = -\beta"
>
. In Cartesian coordinates:</p>

    <p id="eq"><a name="eqn-02" id="eqn-02"><img width=275 height=17 src="misc/luana/eqn-02.png" alt="x_{O'P} = p \cos\beta, y_{O'P} = -p \sin\beta."
>
</a></p>

    <p>The angles <img width=11 height=12 src="misc/luana/eqs-009.png" alt="\varphi">
 and <img width=11 height=17 src="misc/luana/eqs-012.png"
    alt="\beta">
 are not independent,
    however. The circles roll without slipping. Hence, the arc
    <img width=74 height=24 src="misc/luana/eqs-013.png" alt="arc(QS) = R\varphi">
 on the fixed circle must be identical
    to the arc <img width=114 height=25 src="misc/luana/eqs-014.png" alt="arc(TS) = r(\varphi+\beta)">
 on the
    rolling circle. The relationship <img width=123 height=19 src="misc/luana/eqs-015.png" alt="\beta = (R-r) \varphi / r">
 follows immediately. This equation is easy
    to interpret in terms of a gearing mechanism. The fixed and
    rolling wheels must have teeth of equal size to be able to
    engage together. Therefore, the number of teeth must be
    proportional to the wheel perimeter and, equivalently, to the
    wheel radius.</p>

    <p>Putting all this together, the current position of the pen
    relative to the fixed center O is given by <img width=170 height=18 src="misc/luana/eqs-016.png" alt="\vec{r} = \vec{r}_{OP} = \vec{r}_{OO'} + \vec{r}_{O'P}">
, or, equivalently:</p>

    <p id="eq"><a name="eqn-03" id="eqn-03"><img width=655 height=55 src="misc/luana/eqn-03.png" alt="x(\varphi) = (R-r) \cos\varphi + p \cos((R-r)\varphi/r), y(\varphi) = (R-r) \sin\varphi - p \sin((R-r)\varphi/r).">
</a></p>

    <p>The equations admit r and p being either positive or
    negative. A negative r would represent a moving wheel rolling
    on the outside, rather than the inside, of the fixed
    circumference. I.e., it will be a epitrochoid curve. Choosing p=r
    with r positive or negative will produce hypo or epicycloid
    curves, respectively.</p>

    <p>It is easy to see that multiplying the three parameters R,
    r, and p by a common factor produces a global scaling of the
    curve dimensions but does not change its shape. On the other
    hand, the figure traced by this parametric equation closes only
    if R/r is a rational number. Let us assume that n and m are the
    smallest integers such that |R/r| = n/m, and let g be the
    greatest common divisor of n and m (gcd(n,m)). The curve will
    then close after a total rotation of m/g times <img width=19 height=13 src="misc/luana/eqs-024.png" alt="2\pi">

    (<img width=95 height=19 src="misc/luana/eqs-025.png" alt="\varphi \in [0,2m\pi]">
) and it will show n/g lobes or
    spikes.</p>

    <p>The equations can be generalized for three or more wheels
    rolling one inside the other, and <a href=
    "#nw-Farris1996">Frank Farris</a> did so in a celebrated
    article in <a href=
    "http://www.maa.org/pubs/mathmag.html">Mathematics
    Magazine</a>. At this level, it is better to give up a direct
    simulation of the physical engine gears and examine the
    equations directly. A very compact and powerful notation is
    obtained by using complex variables, with the convention that
    the real and imaginary parts represent the x and y Cartesian
    coordinates, i.e., z=x+iy where i is the imaginary number. The
    general Farris equations are:</p>

    <p id="eq"><a name="eqn-04" id="eqn-04"><img width=275 height=51 src="misc/luana/eqn-04.png" alt="z(t) = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k e^{i2\pi(n_k t+\theta_k)}, t \in [0,1],">
</a></p>

    <p>where n is the number of engaged wheels: wheel k has its
    center fixed on a point of the circumference of wheel (k-1). On
    each wheel, <img width=16 height=12 src="misc/luana/eqs-033.png" alt="a_k">
 is related to the radius, <img width=18 height=12 src="misc/luana/eqs-034.png" alt="n_k">
 to
    the rotation speed, and <img width=15 height=17 src="misc/luana/eqs-035.png" alt="\theta_k">
 is an initial phase angle.
    Farris demonstrated that the z(t) curve has g-fold rotational
    symmetry if all the pairwise differences <img width=64 height=20 src="misc/luana/eqs-038.png" alt="|n_k-n_j|">
 have g as their greatest common divisor.</p>

    <p>The code saves the image as a PNG file, useful for insertion
    on a Web page, but any <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> terminal could
    be used. An EPS/PDF vector file with white background is better
    for a printed version of the document, whereas an unscaled PNG
    raster file with black background may look better and render
    faster in a Web browser. The use of the PNG terminal is a
    little tricky, as there appear to be two versions that differ
    in the recognized syntax. If <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> chokes on
    the <tt>png size 600,600</tt> part, try using <tt>png picsize
    600 600</tt> instead. Notice that we have removed the default
    axes, labels, and tics. Identical scaling of the axes has also
    been enforced, to avoid distortion of the image. The result can
    be seen in <a href="#fig:spiro02">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

    <p>In this example, we have used Farris equations for three
    wheels. Complex numbers (notice the <tt>{0,1}</tt> constant,
    equivalent to the imaginary number, i, in <em id=
    "sc">gnuplot</em> syntax) are used to evaluate the z(t)
    function, but their real and imaginary parts must be explicitly
    extracted and passed to the <tt>plot</tt> instruction.
    Therefore, z(t), is actually called twice for each point.
    Perhaps future <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> versions will recognize
    a single complex expression as a complete argument of the

    provides a very compact notation.</p>

    <p>The script, on the other hand, can be called with anything
    from 3 to 9 parameters. The three obligatory parameters are n1,
    n2, and n3, that adjust the relative speed of the three wheels.
    The next group of three are a1, a2, and a3, related to the
    relative size of the wheels, and a default value of 1.0 is
    assumed for any parameter not given in the input. The last
    group corresponds to the initial phase angles, s1, s2, and s3,
    with a default value of 0.0. The script parameters are used
    only within <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> assignments. This means
    that the user can enter expressions rather than single integer
    or real values. Some care must be taken, however, when entering
    fractions: use 1.0/3 and not 1/3, that would be interpreted by
    <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> as an integer division and would
    produce an unexpected 0.</p>

    <p><a href="#fig:spiro03">Figure 3</a> represents some of the
    most characteristic patterns exhibited by three rolling wheels
    of identical size. These patterns occur when the wheel speeds,
    [n1,n2,n3], their differences, <img width=116 height=19 src="misc/luana/eqs-069.png" alt="\Delta{n_{ij}} = n_j - n_i">
, and the greatest common divisor of
    the differences, <img width=120 height=20 src="misc/luana/eqs-070.png" alt="g = \mathrm{gcd}(|\Delta{n_{ij}}|)">
,
    satisfy appropriate conditions. Large values for g produce
    highly symmetric and generally nice motifs. Some of the most
    pleasant designs, however, show only a moderate symmetry and a
    more subtle interplay between regularity and uniqueness.</p>

    <p>Some trends, found by the observation of a large number of
    cases, can help in the design of a particular motif. Assuming
    that the three wheels are of equal size, differences like
    (-g,2g,3g) can produce g-points stars, whereas g-petal daisies
    tend to happen for ([+/-]2g, [+/-]g, [+/-]g) differences. Palm
    leaves and nephroids occur when two of the <img width=35 height=19 src="misc/luana/eqs-073.png" alt="\Delta{n_{ij}}">
 differences coincide, in absolute value, with two
    of the wheel speeds. Crosses and Maasai shields are <em>rara
    avis</em> that require a large number of conditions to be met:
    the sum of all wheel speeds must be odd (positive or negative),
    g must be a power of 2, and the sum of two of the differences
    must be equal to the third.</p>

    <p>Changing the wheel sizes will also produce significant
    variations in the drawings. Adding small phase angles to one or
    more wheels can be used to introduce some irregularity into an
    otherwise too symmetric and uninteresting motif.</p>

    <p>The two previous examples have used the spirographic
    equations with a large number of sample points, large enough to
    show the true nature of the curves: both continuous and
    derivable, as they are the sums of exponential functions. The
    Web has plenty of simplistic Java applets that poorly render
    the equations by using a small number of points per roll. This
    method, albeit a wrong representation of the true curves, can
    produce quite pleasant images. In a declarative language, this
    type of plot would be produced using a simple loop:</p>
    <pre>
   nturns = abs(rsmall) / gcd(Rbig,abs(rsmall))
   M = nturns * resolution
   inumber = {0,1}
   for (k=0; k&lt;=M; k++) {
      ang1 = inumber * k * 2*pi/M
      ang2 = ang1 * (rsmall-Rbig)/rsmall
      z[k] = (Rbig-rsmall)*exp(ang1) + p*exp(ang2)
      if (k&gt;0) { PLOT LINE from z[k-1] to z[k] }
      }
</pre>

    <p>where <tt>resolution</tt> holds the number of sample points
    used for each roll around the main (fixed) wheel and
    <tt>nturns</tt> is the number of times this wheel must be
    rolled around. The above pseudocode assumes the use of complex
    arithmetic and the availability of a <tt>gcd()</tt>
    function.</p>

    <p>Loops and conditional expressions are not part of the
    <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> language, but there are ways around
    this limitation. First, an implicit loop is automatically
    performed on each plot instruction. We just have to be careful
    to fix an appropriate <tt>samples</tt> value and a correct
    range for the independent variable (the parametric variable, in
    our case). The ternary operator (<tt>a?b:c</tt>, evaluate and
    return <tt>b</tt> if <tt>a</tt> is true, and <tt>c</tt>
    otherwise) can be used as a restricted conditional test.
    <em id="sc">gnuplot's</em> user-defined functions can be
    recursive, on the other hand, and this can also be used as a
    restricted form of loop.</p>

    <p>The next example uses all of the above ideas. Notice, in
    particular, the recursive definition of the <tt>gcd()</tt>
    function, that implements Euclid's algorithm for the greatest
    common divisor. The calculation of the number of turns and
    sample points is simplified by assuming that R and r are
    integers.</p>

    <b>Figure 4</b> Curve stitching patterns from the hypotrochoid

    <p>The last example works well for drawing a single curve with
    a given resolution, but the most interesting patterns are
    obtained by mixing several renderings of one or more curves
    with well chosen resolutions. To do this within a single
    <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> run, we have to take explicit control
    of the angles used for each equation. For instance:</p>

#
# Values for the dummy parameter:

# Greatest common divisor:

# The different curves:

 R2 = 100; r2 = 2; p2 = 70; res2 = 125
 R3 = 100; r3 = 2; p3 = 70; res3 = 175
#

 nseg2 = res2 * abs(r2) / gcd(R2,abs(r2))
 nseg3 = res3 * abs(r3) / gcd(R3,abs(r3))
 n12 = (nseg1 * nseg2) / gcd(nseg1,nseg2)
 nsamp = (n12 * nseg3) / gcd(n12,nseg3)
 nsamp1 = nsamp + 1

  , x(t(i,res3),R3,r3,p3),y(t(i,res3),R3,r3,p3)
</pre>

    <p>The result of this code is represented in <a href=
    "#fig:spiro05">figure 4</a>. The intricate embroidery of the
    three curve representations, only recognizable by their
    different colors, show an appealing and delicate beauty that
    deserves further exploration. However, using the same
    <tt>plot</tt> order for the three is far from being effective
    and poses many problems for its generalization to an arbitrary
    number and class of representations. In particular, the number
    of sample points has to be a minimum common multiple of the
    best number of sample points for each independent figure.</p>

    <p>In the case of <a href="#fig:spiro05">figure 4</a>, the
    three curves would need 75, 125 and 175 sample points,
    respectively, but plotting the three simultaneously requires
    2625 samples, instead. So, the first component is repeated 35
    times, 21 times the second, and 15 times the third. This
    repetition will add substantially to the plotting time but, if
    the final result is written to a raster format like PNG, there
    will be no increase on the size of the final file. If we use a
    vector format like EPS or SVG, however, the file size will also
    increase substantially.</p>

    <p>We can avoid the unnecessary repetition by turning to a 
    two-pass method. In the first pass, each curve is created
    independently in <em id="sc">gnuplot</em>, and its points are
    saved in a file using a <tt>set terminal table</tt> output
    mode. The second pass combines the points from all the previous
    files into a single design, that is saved in whatever raster or
    vector format seems appropriate. Instead of providing an
    example of this technique, we will use the idea for our final
    and most ambitious project.</p>

    <h2><a name="Sec:combining" id="Sec:combining">IV. A
    mini-language for combining an arbitrary number of
    spirograph-like patterns</a></h2>

    <p>All the techniques developed in the previous section can be
    made more accessible if we design a simple way of describing a
    plot and we create the tool for translating the description to
    the appropriate <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> instructions. The
    perfect translation tool would hide the details of the <em id=
    "sc">gnuplot</em> syntax from the user while maintaining an
    appropriate degree of flexibility.</p>

    <p>We have written an experimental translator (<a href=
    "misc/luana/spirolang.awk.txt">See/download the translator</a>)
    in awk for rapid prototyping and easy experimentation. We are
    going to describe the language currently recognized. The
    following notation will be used. Fixed names are written in
    <b>boldface</b>. Variable data appears in <i>italica</i>,
    enclosed within square brackets, [], if the data is optional.
    The data type is indicated by the suffix of the variable name:
    <i>var.s</i> (a string sequence); <i>var.i</i> (an integer);
    <i>var.r</i> (a real value); <i>var.c</i> (a complex value in
    <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> notation, i.e.,
    <tt>{real_part,imaginary_part}</tt>); <i>var.re</i> and
    <i>var.ce</i> (a real or complex expression, like
    <tt>pi*{0,1}/12</tt>). Missing values are forbidden within the
    integer, real and complex data and expressions.</p>

    <p>We should not end this report without mentioning, at least,
    some of the excellent Java applets that can be found on the
    Internet (<a href="#Paramo2004">Paramo2004</a>, <a href=

    <a href="#Ziring2000">Ziring2000</a>). A well conceived GUI can
    be of great help in the interactive exploration of a designated
    subset of the vast Spirograph parametric space. It is not the
    only approach, however. A custom mini-language can give access
    to an arbitrarily large parametric space and hide the dirty
    details of code generation. The <em id="sc">gnuplot</em> engine
    has been used for years to produce professional quality plots.
    Some of its drawbacks, like the lack of true loop mechanisms,
    can be eliminated with some ingenuity or by embedding the
    engine within a more general programming tool.</p>

<em>

<p>
I'm a Spaniard, living in Oviedo, close to the northern coast of Spain.
Married, with a teenager daughter ("hey, dad, this spiro thing is cool!"),
I teach Physical Chemistry and do research on Theoretical Chemistry for a
living. I have programmed on all sort of machines, from the mythical HP41C
to the not less mythical Cray X and Y supercomputers (the end of an era
left us short of a good <strong>crazy</strong> machine), for the last 25
years. I was captivated by linux around 1993, when our research group
discovered the first Slackware distribution. Our current infrastructure is
based on Debian and includes a half-mounted Top500
<strong>wannabee</strong> shared among many research groups.
</p>

<p>
On the left: self portrait in front of a mirror (Feb. 2006). Yes, I truly
love photography, but I don't like appearing on images myself. Anyway, this
self portrait has something that I don't dislike too much. The band on my
left hand has disappeared long ago.
