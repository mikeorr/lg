  Sun Pockets MySQL
</h3>

<p>
  At the same time Oracle was buying BEA, Sun announced its agreement to buy
  Open Source stalwart MySQL AB. It was only a billion or so.
  "As part of the transaction, Sun will pay approximately $800 million in cash
  in exchange for all MySQL stock and assume approximately $200 million in
  options." (from biz.yahoo.com)
  
  While there was some negative reaction (see ArsTechnica's posting
  <a href=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080116-sun-targets-open-source-lamp-stack-with-mysql-acquisition.html>here</a>),
  many firms in the partner network around MySQL seemed supporting or
  accepting.  Principal among these were those in the PHP community such as
  Harold Goldberg, CEO, Zend Technologies (the PHP company).
</p>

<p>
  "This is a very good deal for the open source and web economies and it
  confirms the success of the LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) stack as a web
  platform.  The valuation of the transaction reflects the broad enterprise
  adoption of LAMP, which is also driving strong revenue growth at Zend
  Technologies. We have a long history of working closely with MySQL and
  are encouraged to see the senior roles the MySQL executives will play at Sun.
  It gives us confidence that we will be able to work with Sun, like we did with
  MySQL, to advance the innovation and open standards that power the adoption of
  the LAMP stack." - Harold Goldberg, CEO, Zend Technologies
</p>

<p>
  Andi Gutman, co-founder of Zend and a PHP community leader, expressed support
  in his Jan 16th blog posting at
  <a href=http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/>http://andigutmans.blogspot.com/</a>.

</p>
<p>
  "...Sun missed the boat on the modern Web. Today there is very little of the
  huge PHP-based Web community that actually runs on Solaris."
</p>
<p>
  Gutman noted that Sun needs to garner mindshare among the PHP community:
</p>
<p>
  "In order to be successful, Sun has to recognize how significant PHP is for
  the MySQL user base and has to be pragmatic in how it thinks about and
  approaches this new business opportunity. By doing so they can truly use this
  acquisition as an opportunity to become a serious player in the modern Web
  server market."
</p>

<p>
  MySQL and Zend have both promoted the popularity of the LAMP stack. These two
  companies have tremendous overlap in their customer bases and have worked
  closely together to ensure their products work well together. As a result,
  much of the modern Web uses PHP and MySQL.and both Zend and MySQL have been
  backed by Index Ventures.
</p>
<p>
  According to MySQL VP Kaj Arno in his company blog: "...I expect Sun to
  <strong>add</strong> value to our community. I don't expect huge change, though. We
  continue to work with our quality contributors, we continue to provide our
  MySQL Forums, the Planet MySQL blog aggregator, we remain on the #mysql-dev
  and #mysql channels on Freenode, we provide MySQL University lessons, we meet
  at the MySQL Users Conference. We'll put effort into connecting the many FOSS
  enthusiasts and experts at Sun - whom we will now learn to know better - with
  our active user community."
  Sun was pushing PostgreSQL on Solaris in the last year and this switch to
  favoring MySQL was unexpected.   The main thrust seems to be fulling
  out Sun's services portfolio and increased access to Linux users.  
  Sun CEO Jonathon Schwartz noted the revenue opportunities for Sun and spoke of
  having a unique combination of developer resources for both a popular database
  and a Unix operating system.  See his blog entry here: 
  <a href=http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/ title=sun.com>http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/</a>
</p>
<p>
Said Schwartz:  "MySQL is already the performance leader on a variety of
benchmarks - we'll make performance leadership the default for every
application we can find (and on every vendor's hardware platforms, not just
Sun's - and on Linux, Solaris, Windows, all). For the technically oriented,
<a href=http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Falcon>Falcon</a> will absolutely sing on
Niagara... talk about a match made in heaven."  (Niagara is the
multi-core SPARC processor)
</p>

<p>
He also wrote, "Until now, no platform vendor has assembled all the core
elements of a completely open source operating system for the Internet. No
company has been able to deliver a comprehensive alternative to the leading
proprietary OS."
</p>

<p>
There is also a Sun blog posting about the high cost of proprietary databases
and the growing "commoditization" of databases here:
<a href=http://blogs.sun.com/jkshah/entry/cost_of_proprietary_database title=sun.com>http://blogs.sun.com/jkshah/entry/cost_of_proprietary_database</a>
</p>

<p>
An eWeek article compares the acquisition approaches of Sun and Oracle, noting
that this further commits Sun to an Open Source strategy, and quotes industry
analysts as favoring the Sun-MySQL deal.  See:
<a href=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Apps/Oracle-Sun-Seek-Big-Buys/?kc=EWKNLENT011808STR2>http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Apps/Oracle-Sun-Seek-Big-Buys/?kc=EWKNLENT011808STR2</a>
</p>

<p>
Oracle closed its deal with BEA after upping its purchase price to $8.5
Billion dollars in January.  BEA had been integrating its own purchases
and has overlaps with the Oracle product line in portals, business process
tools, and the ubiquitous Weblogic Java Application Server.  Industry
analysts view Oracle's motive primarily as a market share ploy, to position
itself better vs. IBM and Microsoft.
</p>

<p>
The Wall Street Journal wrote "Acquisitions by Silicon Valley software giants
Oracle Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. suggested a slowing economy and other
forces could kick a recent wave of high-tech deals into higher gear." Wonder
who's next??

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">
AMD Acknowledges Faux Pas, Plans for New 8-way Opteron
</h3>
<p>
"We blew it, and we're humbled by it," AMD CEO Hector Ruiz told a
December analysts conference in New York.   It has shipped few of
its new quad-core architecture Opterons due to problems in the translation
lookaside buffer (TLB).  Although there are OS-level patches for the
problems with almost no performance penalty, BIOS level workarounds can result
in a 10% or greater performance penalty (and some worst case tests show a 30%
hit).   All the OEMs - Dell, HP, IBM, Sun, et al. - are careful not
to incur a support nightmare, assuming customers may not install the OS
patches correctly.
</p>
<p>
The TLB issue primarily impacts virtualization due to how guest OS might use
some TLB registers.  If the guest OS is patched not to use the
registers, there is no need for a BIOS fix.   So some Barcelona
chips have been shipped for use in HPC clusters where bare metal performance
is optimized, such as the Texas Advanced Computing Center at U of
T.   AMD said that it has shipped about 35,000 Barcelona chips by
mid-December and it expects to ship "hundreds of thousands" by the first
quarter of 2008.  At the January earnings announcement, AMD did show that
shipments for its 4-way chips were ramping up.
(From <a href=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_7713432>Mercury News</a>)
</p>
<p>
The Sunnyvale chip maker backed away from its previously stated goal of ending
its string of losses in 2007, saying it's aiming to break even in the second
quarter and turn an operating profit in the third quarter. It also confirmed
it will delay the widespread launch of its "quad-core" server chip until the
first quarter of next year.  CEO Ruiz spoke encouragingly of "...a
phenomenal transition year in 2008." 
</p>
<p>
As recently as 2005, AMD was grabbing market share from rival Intel. But then
came a series of missed deadlines on new products and price-cutting. The
company also acknowledged that it significantly overpaid for ATI Technologies
($5.6 billion) and will write down the value of the biggest acquisition in AMD
history. 
</p>
<p>
The AMD road map includes a transition to 45nm process technology with
Shanghai and Montreal processors as successors to Barcelona starting in the
3rd Quarter of 2008. The Montreal chip will sport an octal core in 2009 with a
1 MB L2 cache and 6-12 MB of L3 per cache, roughly matching or modestly
exceeding the Intel roadmap.   AMD is also a partner with IBM in
developing a 32 nanometer chip fabrication process that may be cheaper and
more flexible than the 32 nm process that Intel will use for its CPUs next
year. 
</p>
<p>
Also helping, in January, HP announced that it would sell a new consumer PC -
the Pavilion m8330f - that uses AMD's new quad-core Phenom processor.
</p>

Intel Splits from OLPC Board
</h3>

<p>
Intel has decided to pursue its own plans for 3rd World student computers,
ending its short association with the One Laptop Per Child project after
only a few months on its board. In a January statement, the OLPC board
said that Intel had violated written agreements with the board of
directors, specifically in  not helping to develop software jointly with
the project. The OLPC statement also claimed that Intel "disparaged" the
OLPC's XO laptop to developing nations that were in negotiations to
purchase the XO.
</p>
<p>
The Intel scheme for 3rd world classrooms uses a small but more standard
laptop with flash storage that runs Windows, while OLPC uses Linux and
open source applications and has hardware -- especially the screen and
keyboard -- more suitable for 3rd world environments. OLPC's XO also consumes
substantially less power. The first models used a low-power AMD processor and
Intel was angling to get OLPC to switch to a low-power Intel chip.
</p>
<p>
An Intel spokesperson claimed the issue was that OLPC wanted Intel to work
"exclusively on the OLPC system".
</p>
<p>
Here are links to BBC pages that reviews features of both the OLPC XO and
Intel's Classmate mini-laptop:

SCO-Novell Damage Claims Get a Court Date
</h3>

<p>
The drama continues. A Federal judge has set an April date to determine just

on Unix operating system licenses after Novell, and not
SCO, was proven to be the copyright holder.
</p>

<p>
Utah district judge Dale Kimball set the trial for April 29 in Salt Lake City.
</p>

<p>
SCO must compensate Novell for the royalties it collected but its has less in

Restful Ruby on Rails 2.0 Arrives on Track
</h3>
<p>
The latest incarnation of the Ruby framework was a full version update that
arrived in early December and was quickly patched in mid-December to Version
2.0.2. The 2.x version expands the commitment of the Ruby community to REST
(Representational State Transfer) as the paradigm for web applications.
</p>

<p>
The new version follows a full year in development and implements new resources,
a more Restful approach to development, and beefed up security to resist XSS
(cross site scripting) and CSRF (cross site resource forgery - an area of
increasing exploitation). The CSRF hardening comes from including a special
token in all forms and Ajax requests, blocking requests made from outside of
your application.
</p>

<p>
Rails 2.x also features improved default exception handling via a class level
macro called <em>'rescue_from'</em> which can be used to declaratively point
certain exceptions to a given action.
</p> 

<p>
All commercial database adapters are now in their own 'gems'. Rails now only
ships with adapters for MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL.  Other adapters
will be provided by the DB firm independently of the Rails release schedule.

Debian 4.0.r2 Patches Security
</h3>

<p>
The Debian community released an Etch "point release" in late December which
included multiple security fixes for the Linux kernel that could allow
escalation to root privileges, denial-of-service (DOS) attacks, and toeholds
for malware. Application fixes are also included to prevent vulnerabilities
from being exploited.   Among effected applications are OpenOffice
and IceWeasel (Debian's implementation of Firefox).
</p>
<p>
Other changes include stability improvements in specific situations, improved
serial console support when configuring grub, and added support for SGI O2
machines with 300MHz RM5200SC CPUs (from mips). Etch was first released in April
of 2007.

  Nanowire Battery Can Hold 10x the Charge
</h3>
<p>
  Stanford researchers have found a way to use silicon nanowires to reinvent the
  rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that power personal electronics such as
  laptops, iPods, video cameras, and cell phones.
</p>
<p>
  The new technology, developed through research led by Yi Cui, assistant
  professor of materials science and engineering, produces 10 times the amount
  of electricity of existing lithium-ion, known as Li-ion, batteries. A laptop
  that now runs on a normal battery for two hours could operate for 20 hours, a
  boon to ocean-hopping business travelers.
  With such greatly expanded storage capacity, the new batteries would also be
  attractive to electric car manufacturers. "It's not a small improvement," Cui
  said. "It's a revolutionary development."
</p>
<p>
  The electrical storage capacity of a Li-ion battery is limited by how much
  lithium can be held in the battery's anode, which is typically made of carbon.
  Silicon has a much higher capacity than carbon.
  The lithium is stored in a forest of tiny silicon nanowires, each with a
  diameter one-thousandth the thickness of a sheet of paper. The nanowires
  inflate four times their normal size as they soak up lithium. But, unlike
  other silicon shapes, they do not fracture.
</p>
<p>
  The breakthrough is described in a paper, "High-performance lithium battery
  anodes using silicon nanowires," published online Dec. 16 in <cite>Nature
  Nanotechnology</cite>, written by Cui, his graduate chemistry student Candace Chan
  and five others. The online article is accessible by subscription to Nature:
