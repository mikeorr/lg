Speaking of my strategy, here's me getting the sharp end of someone
<em>else</em> being awfully militant -- and, in my view, overreacting to <em>my</em> 
system's spam-detection measures.

Hi,
 
I'm sending this to let you know, if you're not already aware, that
[198.144.195.186] is listed on the backscatterer.org RBL. We're kind of
aggressive and block rather than increment the message's SA score.
 
Usually that works OK but this is a case where it doesn't.
 
I'll whitelist [198.144.195.186] on our end.
 
I am a little surprised that you're using call backs, though.
 
Keith

Hi, Keith.  I do use a particular type of callout, in a way that I have
taken care to make sure is (IMO, and I'm willing to be convinced
otherwise) not abusive.
 
1.  I recognise backscatter to be a very serious problem, and try to
make sure my systems are not guilty of same.
 
2.  My Exim4 MTA is configured to callout to the claimed delivering
domain's MX and test using RCPT TO (_not_ VRFY) that the claimed sender
address is deliverable, and that postmaster@ and abuse@ are deliverable.
Claimed delivering domains that fail those tests get told 550.  
 
It doesn't perform these tests on <em>every</em> attempted delivery; test
results get cached and reused, specifically to avoid abuse.
 
The guidelines at
<a href="http://www.backscatterer.org/index.php?target=sendercallouts">http://www.backscatterer.org/index.php?target=sendercallouts</a> seem to
suggest that systems get listed if they do such callouts at all, without
regard to whether the level of such traffic is problematic or not.  I
understand their perspective, but do not concur with the implied "No
level of callouts is permissible" assumption.
 
I attempt to operate a reputable mail system -- though of course I could
be misguided or be guilty of operating a misconfigured system.  I'll
study the backscatterer.org RBL docs more closely, but my immediate
inclination is that I'm not misguided in this case.

Hi, Rick --

&lt;snip&gt;
</p>


<pre>
&gt;
&gt; The guidelines at
&gt; <a href="http://www.backscatterer.org/index.php?target=sendercallouts">http://www.backscatterer.org/index.php?target=sendercallouts</a> seem to
&gt; suggest that systems get listed if they do such callouts at all, without
&gt; regard to whether the level of such traffic is problematic or not.  I
&gt; understand their perspective, but do not concur with the implied "No
&gt; level of callouts is permissible" assumption.
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Given that we drop before DATA (unless postmaster@ or abuse@) if a system
is on the backscatterer.org RBL, I guess that's more-or-less implicit
agreement with the assumption on our part. I'm not so sure I'm comfortable
with that decision. It's been a while since I implemented that RBL and I
don't recall them having a "wait for the listing to expire or pay us 50
euros" policy which I see there today. That adds to my discomfort level.
</p>

&gt; I attempt to operate a reputable mail system -- though of course I could

&gt;

<p>
Sure. I didn't mean to suggest otherwise. I added linuxmafia.com server to
our whitelist because I felt that backscatterer.org got it wrong; I saw no
reason to honor their listing. In writing you, I just wanted to point out
that the server was listed there.
</p>

<p>
Regards.
