<h1>dotProject</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/jordan.html">Lee Jordan</a></b></p>


<h3>What is dotProject?</h3>

<p>
dotProject enables you to create, track, and maintain your projects online.
It provides enterprise-level project management tools that include contact
management, an email notification system, and an online system to create
and manage projects. The intuitive color codes indicate if you are headed
for hot water. It is created, maintained, and developed by volunteers like
you and me.</p>

<p>
dotProject is free to use. The software license is BSD, GNU General Public
License (GPL), which means it is free software provided as is with no
warranty. The full license should be available in the [filename path] where
your installation of dotProject resides. You can learn more about this type
of license at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
When a user first logs in, they will see a personalized view of dotProject.
The screen will display the events and tasks they are members of, including
a full list of specific projects and tasks they are assigned to. The user
can navigate to different areas as specified on the navigation bar, which
will be displayed on the top or the left side of the screen. </p> 
<p>
<img width="569" height="400" src="misc/jordan/image1.jpg">
</p>
<p>
dotProject is an online project management application. You will need a
browser and either intranet or Internet access. dotProject is surprisingly
versatile. A few of the many things you can do in dotProject are: 
<ul>
<li> Set up a project and its tasks</li>
<li>  Communicate with everyone on the project team from within dotProject.</li>
<li> See projects as Gantt charts</li>
<li> Check task progress quickly with Calendar and Events</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
dotProject has great features for communicating with your contacts and
resources. Even so, it is not intended as a groupware tool. Groupware is
generally used to describe desktop or web-based applications that enable
users to work collaboratively. There are often forum, chat environments,
wikis, or email tools which are all-purpose in nature. Choosing a groupware
over a focused application could be compared to offering a guest a wide
variety of pies, cakes, and cookies for dessert when you know they have a
deep and abiding love for cheesecake with raspberry and chocolate sauce. 
</p>
<p>
dotProject is focused specifically on project management instead of being a
generic groupware application. It does contain forums, calendar, and email
functionality that are often associated with groupware tools, so that users
can collaborate for the purpose of project management. The phrase, "for the
purpose of project management" is the key difference between dotProject and
groupware. The narrow focus on the needs of those involved in managing
projects makes dotProject more useful to users than a generic tool. No
project is too large or too small, whether you are trying to get the band
back together or developing enterprise software projects. </p>

<p>
dotProject is useful in many ways. There are features of dotProject that
make using it a much more pleasant experience like user specific to-do
lists and events: when a user logs in, they immediately see what project
events they are involved in and what tasks are assigned to them. 
</p>

<h3>What are the Core Features of dotProject?</h3>

<p>
The answer will actually depend on what your company uses dotProject for. A
user with admin access has a great deal of control over what modules are
active, displayed, or hidden, and who can use them. If a particular set of
modules are not needed, they can be deactivated. There are 10 key features
that make up the core of dotProject. These are central to the dotProject
philosophy of creating an environment for users:
<ul>
<li> User Management</li>
<li> Email-based Trouble Ticket System (dotProject incorporates voxel dot net's Ticketsmith system</li>
<li> Client/Company Management</li>
<li> Project Listings</li>
<li> Hierarchical Task List</li>

<li> File Repository</li>
<li> Contact List </li>
<li> Calendar</li>
<li> Discussion Forum</li>
<li> Resource Based Permissions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4> Core Features in Detail</h4>

<p>
<b> User Management: </b> A simple feature, for tracking user activity,
adding users, and managing users. User sessions showing date last logged in
as well as other information is available.</p>

<p>
<b> Email based Trouble Ticket System (Integrated voxel dot net's
Ticketsmith):</b> A ticket tracking system. Some use dotProject as a
helpdesk or combination CRM (Customer Resource Management) tool.</p>

<p>
<b> Email notification for assignees: </b>This feature is on by default
whenever a new task is created. User assignees will receive information
about the task they were assigned to unless you choose not to have the
notification sent.</p>

<p>
<b> Client/Company Management: </b>A digital rolodex of contact information
that can be used to identify projects that directly affect customers or
external clients. Basic default classifications and categories are already
set up in the Companies module. A tabbed interface allows users to quickly
see how many vendors, suppliers, and other types of companies are on the
list.</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="394" src="misc/jordan/image2.jpg">
</p>

<p>
<b>Project listings: </b>Lists of projects are broken down by what state
they are in, such as all projects, proposed, planning, in progress, on
hold, complete, template, archived, not defined. You can quickly move from
tab to tab to view the state of the projects. The number of projects listed
in each state is in parenthesis on each tab.</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="330" src="misc/jordan/image3.jpg">
</p>

<p>
<b>Layered project and task details: </b> The minimum amount you need to
know is displayed. Text links allow the user to drill down into the project
or task for more information if required. Tasks can also be organized by
precedence, dependencies, and time.</p>

<p>
<b>Hierarchical Task List:</b> Tasks are organized in a hierarchy, not just
arbitrarily listed. This is a very useful feature. Tasks can be dependent
on other tasks. </p>

<p>
<b>Instant Color Coded Progress:</b> Instantly see if your project is in
danger with intuitive color codes. If your task is highlighted with dark
pink or red, it is past due.</p>

<p>
<img width="600" height="253" src="misc/jordan/image4.jpg">
</p>

<p>
<b>File Repository:</b> The file repository is a central place to store
project documents. They can be viewed from the central repository or from
the project they are stored under. Files can be uploaded without being
associated with a specific project. They will appear under the All Projects
heading in the repository. I have found this feature invaluable for when I
wanted to make sure all stakeholders would be able to view key files or
code in case something happened. The file system strictly controls how
files are downloaded and uploaded. All files can be assigned a version
number. The check-in and check-out process can be confusing. We will spend
some quality time covering it in Chapter 3, where I will help you avoid the
embarrassing mistakes I have made using this feature.</p>

<p>
<b>Contact List:</b> The contact list can be used intuitively within
project listings themselves. This is a feature I am thankful for every time
I have to edit or create a new task.</p>

<p>
<b>Calendar:</b> The calendar has several display options, including a
three month mini calendar view, a day view, week view, and a comprehensive
month view. A full screen version of the calendar is only a click away on
the navigation bar. There you can see a holistic view of all the projects
and tasks. There is also a three month mini-calendar that displays on the
Today screen. </p>

<p>
<b>Discussion Forum:</b> The forum module can be used to share
project-specific news and information. It is integrated into dotProject.
Everyone can view what is said in the forum. Threaded discussion forums can
be created to discuss particular projects. All forums must be associated
with projects. Forums can be moderated, and follow a standard post topic,
reply, add new topic format. </p>

<p>
<b>Resource Based Permissions:</b> The permissions system in versions 2.0
and above is role based. It is granular, meaning there are many variations
that can be used to specify access to the areas you want and prevent
access. Users can have read-only access to certain modules by role.
Role-based permissions are intuitive. If most of the people using
dotProject will be project managers, a project manager role can be created,
and then individual users can be added to the system. Roles must be in
place before a user is added. Think of it as a job. A job must be created,
and then a person hired to fill the job position. This is a very important
feature. </p>

<p>
<b>User specific to-do lists and events:</b> When a user logs in, they
immediately see what project events they are involved in and what tasks are
assigned to them.</p>

<h3>Why dotProject is the Right PMA for You</h3>

<p>
So far we have examined what project management applications are, what they
should do, and taken a high level look at what features dotProject has to
offer. Determining what project management tool best suits an organization
calls for awareness of which features are critical and which are
negotiable.</p>

<p>
dotProject is the right choice for organizations that need a project
management application that has no fees, has a generous license agreement,
is stable, works on all the major browsers, has a supportive community, has
permissions that are granular, and is scalable. It is open source, not a
commercial application. There are no license fees, maintenance fees, or
purchasing fees. For organizations on a tight budget, the price is right. </p>

<p>
It has a history of integration with other popular open-source projects
such as PostNuke. It's modular. Use only the modules you need. Don't want
to use the Forums module? Disable it. It shares many advantages of other
open-source, developer maintained applications in that, it is relatively
lightweight, can be customized by users or by contracting with its
developers.</p>

<p>
dotProject does have limitations. Its focused approach may turn off those
looking for an all-in-one project development suite. There is no module for
creating diagrams, for example. The ability of dotProject to integrate with
other applications as part of a larger, customized group is a potential
solution.</p>
