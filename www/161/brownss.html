<h1>Upgrading your Slug</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

<p>
If you installed Debian on an NSLU2 device ("Slug") following <a
href="../138/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape's instructions in LG
#138</a>, then you might now wish to upgrade from <tt>etch</tt> (old
stable) to <tt>lenny</tt> (current stable).  Debian itself contains
instructions for doing this, which you can follow if you like (but see the
note below about the locales package causing a crash). If you use the
NSLU2's watchdog driver, then I recommend first booting without it,
otherwise the general unresponsiveness caused by the upgrade can cause the
watchdog to reboot when the system is unbootable, and you'll have to
restore the filesystem from backup.  However, following the standard Debian
dist-upgrade will still leave you running <tt>lenny</tt> using the
<tt>arm</tt> architecture.  Debian's <tt>arm</tt> port is now considered
deprecated, and in future releases will be replaced by the <tt>armel</tt>
port, which has (among other things) significant speed improvements in
floating-point emulation just by changing the handling of the ARM's
registers, stack frames, etc.
</p>

<p>
If you want to move to <tt>armel</tt> at the same time as you're upgrading
to <tt>lenny</tt>, this normally requires re-installing from scratch (since
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArchTakeover">ArchTakeover</a> is not
implemented, yet.)  However, there is also a way to do it incrementally.
Martin Michlmayr has produced an <a
href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/nslu2/unpack.html">unpacked version of
the lenny armel install</a>, which can be downloaded and untarred into a
subdirectory of your etch system.  Etch will not be able to chroot into
this, but at least it lets you compare key configuration files and make
needed changes from the comfort of a working system.
</p>

<h3>Moving Files and Setting up Configuration</h3>

<p>
The first thing you need to do is copy <tt>fstab</tt> from the
old <tt>/etc</tt> to the new one; you'll also need <tt>resolv.conf, hostname,
hosts, mailname, timezone</tt>, and <tt>adjtime</tt>.  You might also like to copy
apt/sources.list (change it to "lenny" or "stable", if it says "etch"), and
the following files if you have customised them: <tt>inittab, inetd.conf,
logrotate.conf</tt>.  For the password files (i.e., <tt>passwd, shadow, group,
and gshadow</tt> - you don't have to worry about any backup versions ending in
<tt>-</tt>), it is best not to simply copy them from etch, because that can
delete the new accounts that various lenny base packages use. Instead, you
can use <tt>diff -u etc/passwd /etc/passwd | grep \+</tt>, pick out the
real user accounts, and merge them in (and do the same with <tt>group,
shadow, gshadow</tt>).  To review <em>all</em> changes that the new
distribution will make, do something like <tt>diff -ur /etc etc|less</tt>
and read through it, looking for what you want to restore. (However, note
that some packages won't be there yet; try searching the list for "Only in
/etc" to see which new config files you might want to copy across in
preparation for them.) Note that lenny uses rsyslog.conf instead of
syslog.conf.
</p>

<p>
After you are happy with <tt>/etc</tt>, please remember to copy across the
crontabs in <tt>/var/spool/cron</tt>. (I've lost count of the number of
times I as a user have had to re-instate my crontab because some admin
forgot to copy the crontabs during an upgrade).  Also, take a list of the
useful packages you've installed that you want to re-install on the new
system.  Finally, <strong>remove</strong> (rm -r) the following top-level
directories from the new system (make sure you're in the new system, not in
<tt>/</tt>!): <tt>media, home, root, tmp, lost+found, proc, mnt, sys,
srv</tt>.  Removing these means they will not overwrite the corresponding
top-level directories from the old system during the next step.
</p>

<p>
The new system now needs to be copied onto the old one (with the old
directories being kept as backups), <em>and</em> the NSLU2's firmware needs
updating to the lenny version (also downloadable from the above-mentioned
site) using <tt>upslug2</tt> from a desktop, as documented. The directories
are best copied over from another system: halt the NSLU2, mount its disk in
another system, and do
</p>

<pre class="code">
cd /new-system
for D in * ; do
  mv /old-system/$D /old-system/$D.old &amp;&amp; mv $D /old-system
done
</pre>

<p>
substituting <tt>/new-system</tt> and <tt>/old-system</tt> appropriately.
(This assumes you have room to keep the *.old top-level directories on the
same partition; modify it, if not.)
</p>

<h3>Partitioning Complications</h3>

<p>
Because Martin Michlmayr's downloadable firmware image was (at the time of
writing) generated from a system that assumes /dev/sda2 is the root device,
you should make sure that your root filesystem is on the disk's second
partition. If it is on the first, then you can move and/or shrink it
slightly with <tt>gparted</tt>, create a small additional partition before
it, and use fdisk to correct the order if necessary. (The fdisk commands
you need are x, f, r, w, and q.)  Then, put <strong>only</strong> that disk
back into the NSLU2, and switch on.  If all goes well, you should now boot
into the new distribution.  Then, you can start installing packages and
re-compiling local programs, and do <tt>apt-get update</tt>, <tt>apt-get
upgrade</tt> and <tt>apt-get dist-upgrade</tt>.  You might still need to
run <tt>dpkg-reconfigure tzdata</tt>, even though it should show your
correct timezone as the default choice.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you have 2 disks connected at boot time, then there's only a
50/50 chance it will choose the correct one to boot from. (If it doesn't,
disconnect and reconnect the power and try again, or boot with only one
disk connected.)  If you have set up your /etc/fstab to boot from UUIDs,
then this will take effect when you install your own kernel (which should
happen automatically as you upgrade the lenny packages).  You can get a
partition's UUID using <tt>dumpe2fs /dev/sda2 | grep UUID</tt>, and use
UUID=(this number) in place of <tt>/dev/sda2</tt> or whatever in
<tt>fstab</tt>, as long as it's not a swap partition. One trick for getting
swap to work is to ensure that it is on a partition number that is valid on
only one disk, and then list <em>all</em> the disks having swap partitions
with this number. The correct disk will be used, and the others will cause
harmless errors during boot.
</p>

<p>
You may experience further complications on account of the differences
between ext2 and ext3 filesystems: In Debian Etch, if you wanted to
reduce the wear on a flash disk, you could tell /etc/fstab to mount the
partition as ext2, even though the installer formatted it as ext3.
Mounting as ext2 simply leaves out writing the ext3 crash-recovery
journal. Apparently, however, the newer kernel in lenny cannot really
mount an ext3 partition as ext2 (it tells you it's doing so, but it
doesn't, see <a
href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/251999">Ubuntu
bug 251999</a>), and moreover, if your fstab says it's ext2, the
<tt>update-initramfs</tt> utility's omitting the ext3 module from the
kernel will result in an unbootable system when you try to upgrade to
lenny's latest kernel (but you can still boot Martin's kernel, which
expects ext3).  Conversely, if your filesystem really is ext2, you won't
be able to boot Martin's kernel. Therefore, you have to: </p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the filesystem is ext3 before booting Martin's kernel</li>
<li>Make sure the filesystem is ext2 before booting your own kernel, if you
have ext2 in your /etc/fstab</li>
</ul>

<p>
To convert an ext3 partition back to ext2, connect the disk to a separate
computer and, if for example the partition is <tt>sdb2</tt> on that
computer, make sure it is unmounted and do
</p>

<pre>
e2fsck -fy /dev/sdb2
tune2fs -O ^has_journal /dev/sdb2
e2fsck -fy /dev/sdb2
</pre>

<p>
and to convert it back to ext3,
</p>

<pre>
tune2fs -O has_journal /dev/sdb2
</pre>

<p>
Martin has filed <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=519800">Debian bug
#519800</a> to suggest that initramfs support both versions of extfs no
matter what <tt>fstab</tt> says, which should mean (when fixed) you don't
have to run <tt>tune2fs</tt> just to get a bootable system. You might still
want to do it anyway to work around the other bug (kernel updating the
journal even when ext2 is requested).
</p>

<h3>Locales Package</h3>

<p>
When doing an apt-get upgrade or dist-upgrade, make sure the
<tt>locales</tt> package is not installed, or at least that you are not
generating any locales with it.  That package's new version requires too
much RAM to generate the locales; the 32MB NSLU2 cannot cope, and may
crash.  If you need any locales other than C and POSIX, then you can get
them from another Linux system by copying the appropriate subdirectories of
<tt>/usr/lib/locale</tt> (and possibly <tt>/usr/share/i18n</tt> if you want
<tt>locale -m</tt> to work, too).
</p>

<h3>Sound</h3>

<p>
If you have fitted a "3D Sound" USB dongle, you might find that, in the new
distribution, the audio becomes choppy and/or echoey.  This seems to be on
account of an inappropriate default choice of algorithms in the ALSA
system, and it can be fixed by creating an <tt>/etc/asound.conf</tt> with
the following contents:
</p>

<pre class="code">
pcm.converter {
  type plug
  slave {
    pcm "hw:0,0"
    rate 48000
    channels 2
    format S16_LE
  }
}
pcm.!default converter
</pre>

<p>
Note that this configuration deliberately bypasses the mixer, so only one
sound can play at once. Mixing sounds in real time on an embedded system
like this is likely to be more trouble than it's worth.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it no longer seems possible to drive the soundcard itself at
lower sample rates and channels, which is a pity because having to
up-convert any lower-samplerate audio (such as the mono 22.05kHz audio
generated by eSpeak) not only wastes bandwidth on the USB bus but also
seems to slightly reduce the sound quality, but the difference is not
immense.
</p>

<p>
If you are playing MP3s, then you also have the option of getting
<tt>madplay</tt> (rather than the ALSA system) to do the resampling, and
this could theoretically be better because <tt>madplay</tt> is aware of the
original MP3 stream, but I for one can't hear the difference.
</p>

<pre>
madplay file.mp3  -A -9  -R 48000 -S  -o wav:-|aplay -q -D hw:0,0
</pre>

<p>
On lenny (unlike on etch), recording works, too, and it can be done with
<tt>arecord -D hw:0,0 -f S16_LE -r 24000 test.wav</tt>, but the quality is
not likely to be good. (Mine had a whine in the background.)
</p>

<h3>Everything Finished</h3>

<p>
If you have done this, then you should, with luck, have an NSLU2 running
lenny on the <tt>armel</tt> architecture, which has significantly faster
floating-point emulation (although it's not as fast as a real
floating-point processor), and perhaps more important has better
long-term support. (You won't be stuck when <tt>arm</tt> is dropped in
the release after lenny.) 
</p>

<p>
The *.old top-level directories created above can be removed when you are
sure you no longer need to retrieve anything from them, or you can rename
them to "old/bin", "old/usr", etc., and have a chroot environment in
<tt>old/</tt>. (The new kernel can run an old system in chroot, but not
vice-versa.)
