<p>
"I've bought us a new potato peeler. Doesn't it look fantastic!"
</p>

<p>
My wife's enthusiasm was boundless. Meanwhile I struggled with the
nuances of her declaration.
</p>

<p>
Why <i>us</i>? I wondered uncharitably. I was perfectly happy with the
three other potato peelers we already had. Why did <i>we</i> need a new
one? And why would I care what it looked like?
</p>

<p>
A few days later, I complained, "It doesn't do a good job."
</p>

<p>
"You're such a curmudgeon. It's beautiful. That's all that matters."
</p>

<p>
This is our endless debate. For her, style is all. I, on the other
hand, believe that, without function, form is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
Sadly (for me), my wife is in the majority. And nowhere is this
demonstrated better than on websites.
</p>

<p>
I see many jobs for web designers, but I can't get my head around what
people mean. If all these websites are designed, how come they are so
dreadful at what they do?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I'm begging the question. Maybe the purpose of each website
is to be a monument to its designer, an item for her folio, a notch on
his belt.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, in the vein of "your call is important to us" (<em>newsflash</em>: it
isn't), these websites do indeed reflect the desires of their owners.
These desires start with a complete disdain for their users, whom they
treat with contempt. They seem to want their websites to be vehicles
to push other products.
</p>

<h3>In the Beginning</h3>

<p>
Take my bank, Citibank. When I first started using their website for
banking (over 3 years ago), I was extremely impressed. It seemed that
they had found a balance between security and usability. (Of course,
I'm talking about my experience in Australia. I have no knowledge of
how Citibank's websites work anywhere else in the world. I'm guessing
it's the same throughout Australia, but I can't even guarantee that.)
</p>

<p>
What impressed me the most was their out-of-band confirmation. Before
I transfer money to any party, I must first set that party up as an
account in my profile. I use normal browser procedures to create the
account, but before the account can be activated (ie used), I have to
ratify it. In the past, I could do that in one of 2 ways: ring
Citibank (a not particularly convenient mechanism - but it is only
once per account); or respond to an email.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, they have replaced both of these with another
mechanism: they SMS a code which I must manually enter. I think most
banks do that now.
</p>

<p>
Using SMS rather than email is likely to be more secure. In theory, if
your PC is compromised, the hacker has access to your bank account and
your email. To rip you off now, the hacker would also have to be in
possession of your phone.
</p>


<p>
That's all basically good news. Now for the not-so-good news.
</p>

<p>
In the first incarnation of Internet banking, I had to provide my ATM
card number and PIN (pretty much the same as when I went to an ATM).
That seemed to me to be secure enough. If it was adequate protection
for me at the ATM, why was it less than adequate for Internet banking?
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>
I am not an authority on security, but neither am I a complete
stranger. 
</p>

<p>
The theory is that security is about <i>something you have</i> and
<i>something you know</i>. (Technically, there's a lot more to it than
that. There's also <i>something you are</i>. But that doesn't apply
here, so let's move on.) So, when I go to the ATM, what I <i>have</i>
is my bank's card. And what I <i>know</i> is my PIN.
</p>

<p>
One way that fraud is perpetrated on such a system is that the baddies
capture (usually photograph or film) the details of your card
(basically its number) and use the captured data to create a clone
card. Capturing someone's PIN is often not difficult. There are video
cameras everywhere these days; and most people are almost reckless in
their failure to even try to conceal their activity when they enter
their PIN. Just look around the next time you are in the queue at a
store's checkout.
</p>

<p>
You should take the view that if your eyes can see what you are keying
when you enter your PIN, then it is susceptible to capture. Ideally,
you should cover your keying hand as you key.
</p>

<p>
When you pay your bill at the restaurant, the something you have is
your credit card. There really isn't anything that you know. Arguably,
you <i>know</i> how to produce your signature; but then so does any
respectable forger. Once she has obtained your card, she has all the
time in the world to practice forgery. Even better, if a baddy gets
hold of a copy of your card's imprint, he can produce a clone and sign
the clone in his handwriting (with your name).
</p>

<p>
I guess the weakness in Citibank's first incarnation, is that it
converts <i>something you have</i> (the card) into <i>something you
know</i> (the card's number). When it comes to things you know, two
are not better than one. (Perhaps marginally better.)
</p>

<p>
There are techniques that achieve a de facto <i>something you
have</i>. "RSA SecurID is a mechanism developed by RSA Security for
performing two-factor authentication for a user to a network
resource." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecurID">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SecurID</a>) In essence, it's a
gizmo that displays a number (at least 6 digits). The number changes
every minute. Every gizmo has its own unique sequence of numbers. So,
in theory, unless you are holding the gizmo, you cannot know which
number is correct at any time. Put another way, knowledge of the
correct number is de facto proof that you have that special <i>something
you have</i>.
</p>

<p>
These techniques are probably expensive. Perhaps the bank thought that
its customers are too stupid to be able to use such a gizmo.
</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>
After some time, Citibank changed the access mechanism. I was invited
(read <i>ordered</i>):
</p>

<pre>
	You will be guided to create your own User ID, Password and
	three "Security Questions". You will be asked to choose from a
	range of questions. Each time you sign on you will be asked
	one question.
</pre>

<p>
My guess is that most users access their accounts from a PC running
Microsoft, um, products (I cannot bring myself to write <i>software</i> in
the same sentence as <i>Microsoft</i>). And I guess there was a concern
that many of these machines could be (or had been) compromised. I
generally don't use Microsoft platforms to access the Internet; I run
Linux on my desktop (as any sensible person would). And I NEVER use
Microsoft platforms to access anything to do with dollars.
</p>

<p>
So I wonder why I have to suffer. Why can't I choose the mechanism
with which I access Citibank's facilities?
</p>

<p>
Ostensibly, Citibank's brave new world of banking was better than the
previous world. Here's how it worked (and still works at time of
writing).
</p>

<pre>
	Disclaimer

	By now, the reader must have realised that I have no personal
	inside knowledge of Citibank or any of its personnel. This
	entire piece is speculation on my part, together with my actual
	personal experience. As they say, YMMV. So I'm going to drop
	the "my guesses" and "I supposes"; it's all getting too
	clunky.
</pre>

<p>
I go to the login screen (affectionately called a "sign on" so as not
spook the cattle). I enter my User ID. I click on the field where I
would normally expect to enter my Password. Up pops a virtual
keyboard. This is supposed to defeat keyboard sniffers. Even if
a sniffer has captured a session during which I entred my User ID and
Password, the only bit that is usable is the User ID (and maybe part
of the Password). The virtual keyboard consists of 3 parts. The
letters of the alphabet are pretty standard; there's a numeric pad to
the right; but there are no numbers on the top row of the keyboard,
only the characters produced when these keys are shifted:

<pre>
	!@#$%^&amp;*()_+
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The special characters and digits are not in fixed positions; each
time the virtual keyboard pops up, the order of these keys changes. So
even if a keyboard sniffer detects <i>where</i> you clicked, it does
not establish <i>what</i> you clicked.
</p>

<p>
The perpetrators of this approach had better be really really sure
that this last assertion is true. Because the virtual keyboard with
the changing keycaps comes at the expense of reducing my password
strength. They have decreased the size of the symbol set. There are 94
ASCII printable characters available to a random password generator.
Citibank's keyboard is case insensitive; there are only 46 characters
to choose from.
</p>

<p>
Further, I'm not certain it defeats <i>all</i> hacks. If your PC is
compromised, perhaps it is also possible that your browser has been
hijacked. If the baddies present you with <i>their</i> virtual keyboard,
would you notice?
</p>

<p>
There are other hacks that are theoretically possible.
</p>

<p>
My suspicion is that the virtual keyboard came from the same school as
many of the security "enhancements" inflicted on people in the US
after 9/11. These "enhancements" are more about creating the
<i>illusion</i> of security than being effective. 
</p>

<p>
It's horrendous to use. For me, when my eyesight was bad, the
characters were almost unreadable. On a normal keyboard, I don't
have to see the characters clearly; it's enough that I know where
they are. But on the virtual keyboard they are never in the same place
twice. I changed my password to use characters that I could more
readily distinguish.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ ...thus decreasing the password strength even
further (it's not that hard to guess which characters are more
distinguishable with poor eyesight.) This reinforces Henry's point: the Law
of Unintended Consequences is alive, well, and hyperactive, particularly 
in the area of UI/security interactions. -- Ben ]</p>

<p>
Because my eyesight was so poor, I was in the habit of using my
browser's feature for increasing text size. That should solve the
problem with the virtual keyboard, I hear you say. Missed it by
<em>that</em>
much. When I increased text size in the browser window, each character
in the virtual keyboard was no longer aligned with the box with which it
was associated. In some cases it became even harder to read, even
though it was bigger.
</p>

<p>
My personal biggest gripe with this mechanism is that it takes me much
longer to enter my password. Instead of a simple swipe-paste, I must
click each character.
</p>

<p>
My other bank (Commonwealth Bank) has a simple Client Number and
Password. As far as I'm concerned, that's perfectly acceptable and
vastly preferable. Commonwealth Bank also uses SMS for ratification.
</p>

<h3>Makeover</h3>

<p>
That brings us to yesterday (March 2010). The folk (web designers?) at
Citibank have given their website a makeover. It has a completely
different look. What's really galling is that the functionality is not
better than it was. However, it is vastly different; so now I have to
learn how to use the new user interface.
</p>

<p>
Imagine you've bought yourself a shiny new car. (Obviously it wouldn't
happen like this.) You drive it for six months. And then one day you
jump behind the wheel - <i>er, wait! where is the steering wheel? Oh,
they've moved it to the other side of the car. I have to get in the
passenger side to drive. I wonder which one of these pedals is the
brake? Ok, I'm starting to get used to it. Now, indicator? Hmm, where
would they have put the indicator?</i>
</p>

<p>
I think you get my drift.
</p>

<p>
And it's not any better than the previous user interface! - which
wasn't great and could have done with some improvement.
</p>

<p>
But we're back to the potato peeler. If it doesn't peel potatoes, who
cares what it looks like? In my opinion (obviously not worth much),
Citibank's new look is really terrible.
</p>

<p>
But here we've come full circle also. The one noticeable difference is
that there are many more references to and come-ons for Citibank's other
products. Once again, the customer is treated with contempt - unless
he's about to buy something.

<em>
<p>
Henry has spent his days working with computers, mostly for computer
 manufacturers or software developers. His early computer experience
 includes relics such as punch cards, paper tape and mag tape. It is
 his darkest secret that he has been paid to do the sorts of things he
 would have paid money to be allowed to do. Just don't tell any of his
 employers. 
</p>

<p>
He has used Linux as his personal home desktop since the family got its
 first PC in 1996. Back then, when the family shared the one PC, it was a
 dual-boot Windows/Slackware setup. Now that each member has his/her own
 computer, Henry somehow survives in a purely Linux world.
</p>

<p>
He lives in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia.
