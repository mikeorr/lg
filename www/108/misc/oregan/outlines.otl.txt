Outliners
	Why Outline?
	| * List of ideas
	| * Hierarchy
	| * Sub topic
	| * Key points only
	| 
	| (Though this outline is an example, it is also a real outline for
	| part of the article).
		Writing
		Brainstorming
		| Writing and brainstorming use the same basic approach to outlining
		| in that the basic ideas are listed first, then expanded upon
		| (or rather, writing uses brainstorming)
		| 
		| See the section on Outliners below.
		Revision 
		Note taking
		| The average writing speed is slower than the average speaking speed
		| so it makes sense to only make note of the key words and ideas.
		| In revising, this reduces the amount that must be learned to the
		| core ideas, while also reinforcing the information in memory:
		| 1. The original text is read
		| 2. The key points are chosen
		| 3. The key points are typed or written
		| 4. The key points are then later used in study
	Outlining Software
		Outliners
		| Outliners were a type of tool which made outlining easy. Though
		| it's still possible to get outlining software, most word processors
		| and some of the more complicated text editors (such as Vim and 
		| Emacs) have outliners available.
		|
		| Using an outliner of this type makes writing easy, because the
		| headings -- the ideas -- for the text can be laid out, and the
		| text added later.
		| Other ideas may be added; the outliner's ability to hide everything
		| but the headings means there is less movement about the body of the
		| text. 
		Presentation software
		| Presentation software such as OOo Impress count as outliners in my
		| book because they serve to outline the main points behind a speech
		| -- a new slide for a new topic, and the keywords are listed as
		| bullet points.
		| This reduces confusion, even if the speaker is bad -- the points
		| are there to be read, regardless of the speaker's ability to convey
		| them in speech.
		| This reinforces the points of the presentation: the points are
		| first read by the audience, then the speaker elaborates.
