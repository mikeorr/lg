<h1>Bidirectionally Testing Network Connections</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

<p>
Beginning in Spring 2009, I started seeing network problems at some
customer sites: data transmissions would hang and time out; connections via
OpenVPN links would work at first but time out as soon as more data was
transmitted; VPN connections using UDP would not work at all (but would
work magically when changing OpenVPN's port to 80/TCP). All these symptoms
are usually tied to traffic shaping, problems with the maximum packet size
(maximum transfer unit, MTU) or other issues usually found between the
end-points of the transmission. But how do you test and record the
performance of "your" Internet?  
</p>

<h3>
Using Network Tools for Debugging
</h3>

<p>
First of all, you can use network tools to inspect the path between the
two communication partners.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <tt>hping3</tt> is a tool to construct arbitrary TCP/IP packets and
     send them to hosts.  This is very useful for sending TCP SYN packets and
     seeing if TCP SYN+ACK packets return.  You can also send packets with a
     custom payload, and check for MTU issues.</li>
<li> <tt>ping</tt> is a well-known tool for sending ICMP Echo Request
     packets.</li>
<li> <tt>tracepath</tt> is used for discovering the MTU between source
     and destination. It uses UDP packets, starting with a size of 65536 byte
     and reducing the size after receiving timeouts or errors.</li>
<li> <tt>traceroute</tt> is the classic tool for displaying the 
     intermediate hops between source and destination.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most tools display error messages, round-trip/response times and other
useful information.  Although many people rely on the results of tools,
always keep in mind that sending test packets is not the same as sending
real data over different protocols. There are routers and other network
devices out there that do not treat every packet equally.  
</p>

<p>
One site reported very strange effects. Immediately after you used a
Bittorrent client or a protocol over "bad ports", the bandwidth for
"regular" network traffic dropped notably.  After half an hour or more, the
performance would return to normal. This behaviour may indicate a violation
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality">net
neutrality</a>, the presence of filters, or other defects. The big problem
is to find the cause, since it could be the network path, flaky hardware,
broken software, prioritisation of network traffic, policy enforcement, or
some entirely different reason. If there are intermediate network devices
manipulating your packet flow, then there's a chance you will never
identify or "see" these devices with the tools available.  
</p>

<h3>
Using Data Transmissions for Debugging
</h3>

<p>
Using "real" data and "real" protocols for testing is better, but how do
you do that? Clicking on download links in your Web browser and using a
stop watch isn't well suited to finding hard facts.  What about the other
direction? Downloads are treated differently from uploads, if you're on
an asymmetric Internet connection. You need to test transfers in both
directions, and you need to use different protocols and ports. Why not
let a script do all of this, and collect a nice summary?  
</p>

<p>
First, we thought to use a shell script containing a few tools, and send
data around. The problem is that you might want to do some statistics.
Filtering the output and calculating transmission rates can be quite
difficult. That's why a Perl script was created. It uses HTTP, HTTPS, SCP,
FTP, SMTP, and IMAP. All protocols except SMTP are automatically used
bidirectionally. The script uses a configuration file where login,
password, paths, and other parameters can be configured. You can use
different servers for every protocol, if you want. The data to be
transferred can be given explicitly by file. If no file is given, then the
script will create a given amount of random data using OpenSSL's
pseudo-random generator code. The full configuration file with all entries
looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Size of data - you can either provide a file or a number of bytes.
# If the file is set to "none", the number of random bytes is used.
data_bytes=65536
data_chunk=8192
data_file="none"
logfile="result.log"
tests=3
# Send report by email
email="recipient@example.net"
cc="none"
smtp_relay="localhost"
# HTTP URLs
http_download="http://www.example.net/tmp/crypto_schrift.png"
http_upload="http://www.example.net/internettester.php"
# HTTPS URLs
https_download="https://www.example.net/tmp/crypto_schrift.png"
https_upload="https://www.example.net/internettester.php"
# FTP
ftp_server="ftp.example.net"
ftp_username="ftpuser"
ftp_password="password"
ftp_path="none"
# IMAP connection (we use the INBOX)
imap_server="mail.example.net"
imap_port="143"
imap_messages=5
imap_username="mailuser"
imap_password="password"
imap_ssl="no"
# SCP connection
scp_server="www.example.net"
scp_port=22
scp_path="/tmp"
scp_username="user"
# SMTP
smtp_server="mail.example.net"
smtp_port=25
smtp_subject="This is a automatically generated email from internettester.pl (%u)"
smtp_from="tester@example.net"
smtp_to="devnull@example.net"
# SSL parameters
ssl_ca=""
ssl_cert=""
ssl_key=""
# Temporary directory
tmpdir="/tmp"
</pre>

<p>
It is important that the HTTP and HTTPS upload URLs handle POST
requests. One way of doing this is to place the PHP script <a
href="misc/pfeiffer/internettester.php.txt">internettester.php</a> on a
Web server. The script receives the POST requests, checks the
parameters, and discards the upload data.  If you need to use SSL with
certificates, then you can add the path to a certificate, key, and
certificate authority to the configuration, too. (See the section "SSL
parameters".)
</p>

<p>
The results are printed on standard output. If you want the results by
e-mail, then you can set the parameters <em>email</em>, <em>cc</em>, and
<em>smtp_relay</em>. The output is then put into an e-mail message and
sent via SMTP.
</p>

<p>
In order to do the actual measurements, you will need at least one
endpoint with an Internet connection with known parameters. You can use
a place on a co-located server, but bear in mind that the connectivity
will most probably be shared. 100 Mbit/s or more sounds a lot - if you
have well-behaving neighbours. The bandwidth should at least be higher
than the one at the endpoint you are interested in testing.  
</p>

<p>
The <a href="misc/pfeiffer/internettester.pl.txt">script itself</a>
needs only Perl and a couple of modules for all the protocols used. You
can check if you have all modules by using <tt>perl -cw
internettester.pl</tt> on the command line. On Debian or Ubuntu systems,
the packages of the Perl modules start with <em>lib</em> and end with
<em>-perl</em>. So the module Crypt::OpenSSL::Random translates to the
package <em>libcrypt-openssl-random-perl</em>.  
</p>

<h3>
Running the Script
</h3>

<p>
Running the script is fairly straightforward. It takes only two optional
parameters.  By using <tt>--config</tt>, you can direct the script to use
a configuration file. By default, it uses <em>internettester.cfg</em>.
The other parameter sets the debug mode.  It lets you see what the
script does.
</p>

<p>
I cut the output after the first two protocols. The script measures only 
bandwidth. Packet loss and round-trip time are not recorded. You can see
the mean, maximum, and minimum of the measured rates. They are computed
with the help of the Statistics::Descriptive module. The fourth value is
the standard deviation. It indicates how far away the measurements are
away from the mean. Low values of standard deviation indicate low
variations of the individual transfer rate. Make sure the number of
tests is not too low for a statistical analysis.  
</p>

<p>
A word of warning: The tests will probably saturate your Internet link.
All tests use TCP, which will tend to grab all your bandwidth (on a
"standard" link). Measurements during office hours should be
coordinated.  
</p>

<h3>
What's next?
</h3>

<p>
The script is no magic bullet, and won't detect all of your network
problems, but can perform automated tests and record the bandwidth
used. Feel free to adapt the code to your requirements.

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.
