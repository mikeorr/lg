Welcome back to another edition of  <B>Web Surfer</B>! This month our
intrepid surfer dude has plugged into <B>Real Audio</B> ; the one and
only WWW based audio player.  <B>YES!</B> it is available for Linux as
of version 2.0 only. Early reading of the docs for this software led our
super hero type dude to believe that a paltry 14.4 modem could not take
advantage of this newest of computer techno-mumbo jumbo gumbo. <P>

I was wrong! A 14.4kb modem <B>CAN</B> be used to listen to version 1.0
audio files with the version 2.0 player. How's the sound? A bit like a
mermaid underwater, but if you listen close, you can make out what is
being said.  The only system requirements you need is the latest Vox
sound driver.  (I always get the latest no matter what the docs say is
needed to run a program)  I had to upgrade my sound drivers of course.
There is also an encoder available for those who want to include audio
files with HTML files.  I'm too shy to record my voice, so I didn't
download that part of the software. I would like to see a converter- one
that converts from .au files to .ra files.  That would be way cool. <P>

<H3><IMG ALIGN MIDDLE SRC="./gx/ecame/coffee.gif"> Hot Java</H3>

I was quite excited to find another <B>Player</B> in the software market
is porting this hot new language to Linux. Check out 
<A HREF="http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html">www.blackdown.org</A>.
<P>

<B>Java</B> is an OOP based C++ style programing lanaguage developed by
the folks at Sun Micro.  Uhh...of course I had to download a copy. The
SDK is called <B><I>JDK</B></I> and includes all needed things to
compile and debug your java code.  How is Java? I don't really know yet.
I didn't have the current version of any required system files other
than a proper kernel version.  I promptly began downloading the
necessary updated system files for <B>java</B>. <P>

Of course it didn't work right o' the box.  I then had to search around looking 
for help as to why I couldn't run a demo.
<P>

Of course...Git'n to it that problem right now.

<H3><IMG ALIGN MIDDLE SRC="./gx/ecame/netscape.gif"> Netscape ships V2.0b6a</B>

I believe someone mentioned frames and multiple windows and other
esoteric stuff in conjuntion with graphics to me the other day.  I
wasn't up to speed as to that person's meaning, but now I think that I
know what he was talking about.  <B>Netscape.com</B> has provided yet
another release of the worlds most popular web browser and seeing how it
is able to handle Java code, I included that as a <I>must-have</I>
upgrade. I'll say this: I sure wasn't ready for those
<B><I>frame</B></I> thingies!  Totally blew my mind; <B>NOW!</B> I have
something else to dig into. <P>

Netscape 2.06a: Java ready and comes with its own filters and scoop; you
just brew up your own program.  <P>

On a clear night, have you everlooked up an' wonder what it would be
like on Venus or Mars?  I have. If you yearn for knowledge of the
planets in our solar system, check out

Planets</A>, a guided tour of the planets in our amazing solar system.
Lots of gifs, movies and sound files. (.au <B>not</B> .ra

Wheeew...been a long day.  Heh heh heh. As you can see, not much is
<B>gnu</B> in this page.  I've been so busy trying to get Java up and
running only to find I'm several versions short of makin' that a
happening thing.  Well, I went overboard and ended up upgrading more
than I needed too. ( Netscape, all the binutils, several libraries
<B>and</B> a new kernel) Most of <I>homeport</I> was new three months
ago and now updated stuff has appeared as fast as fleas on a blue tic
dawg.  <P>

<I><B>Ciao bella</I></B> I'm outta here!
