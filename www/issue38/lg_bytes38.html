Debian Logo Contest
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Wed, 03 Feb 1999 20:38:26 -0500<BR> 
Debian Project,
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</A> 
<P>
The Debian project is in the process of looking for a new logo.  Currently 
Debian has a semi-official logo, which can be seen at
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/logos/debianlogo-2.jpg">http://www.debian.org/logos/debianlogo-2.jpg</A>. As a majority of Debian 
developers are not happy with the current logo, we are searching for a new 
logo to replace the current one using a GIMP logo contest.  Submission 
information and other details are available at <A HREF="http://contest.gimp.org/">http://contest.gimp.org/</A>.  
<P>
Debian would like to have two logos: one logo with a very liberal license 
that everyone is free to use (for example on webpages, shirts, etc.), and 
a more official logo with a restricted license which can only be used on 
official Debian items (like CD's produced from the official ISO-images).  
Please note both license are not finished yet.
<P>
The winning logo will be decided on by the Debian developers. Since there 
are a lot of active developers it may take as long as 3-4 weeks after the 
end of the contest to decide who the winner is.

Invitation to Join Freedom of Choice Project
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Fri, 5 Feb 1999 05:20:52 -0500<BR> 
The Freedom of Choice Project is a co-operative effort between IACT and 
James Capone, an IACT member as well as devoted user of Linux, who created 
the entire project at his own Linux website. In the project's first week, 
over 5000 people had participated in the Freedom of Choice consumer poll. 
With help from IACT, James Capone now is expanding the poll to reach users 
of _all_ platforms.
<P>
As you know, all computer users certainly are affected by an ongoing 
problem in the computer market: Microsoft still maintains an exclusive 
distributorship with PC makers such as Compaq, Dell, Gateway etc.. Those 
companies pre-install or "bundle" MSFT software on the majority of new PCs 
we buy. Once the MSFT software is pre-installed, we may decide to delete it 
and then fight to get a refund, but that approach still won't get to the 
root of the problem.
<P>
The Freedom of Choice project is our grass-roots, long-term solution. By 
using the Internet as it was designed-- to bring together small groups like 
ours into a larger, stronger and unique network-- we're going to defend the 
fundamental right of consumers everywhere to choose any and all software 
that is installed on the new computers they buy.
<P>
We want to give users of all platforms the chance to _send a direct 
message_ to the PC makers, to demand that the companies fully respect every 
consumer's right to choose.

GLUE: Groups of Linux Users Everywhere
<P>
GLUE has added a number of new benefits in recent months to attract new
groups, and is working hard to give our current member groups an
excellent level of service. New benefits include: special subscription
rate to the TPJ and LJ for registered GLUE LUG members, a set of the LJ
archive CD-ROMs, Red Hat Linux, and TCL Blast. GLUE also continues to very
graciously sponsored by Caldera Systems, with their Open Linux
distribution, and Enhanced Software Technologies, with their BRU Backup
and Restore Utilities. I'm working with Linux user groups to find out what
other ways GLUE can contribute, from web resources, to inviting other
vendors to particpate. The glue-list@ssc.com mailing list is available for
discussion among LUGs.
<P>
Linux Users can find a user group with our Group Locator pages, or post to
find or form one of their own. These listings pages are updated and
confirmed frequently, and are very comprehensive. Listing are free to all
groups, not just those registered for GLUE membership.
<P>
GLUE is a project of SSC Inc, publishers of Linux Journal. GLUE was 
implemented to provide a world-wide member group for Linux User Groups.  
GLUE member groups receive a subscription, materials for promoting and 
developing their group, a way of advertising their group in a global 
setting, list-serv and Linux Group location services, and discounts and 
samples from SSC and Linux Journal. Other vendors also offer special 
benefits or discounts to GLUE's member groups. Any LUG can have a free 
listing in the Linux Group location section, and Linux users can post to 
the site to find and form new groups in their area.

Linuxcare is holding a just-for-fun election for the new Leader of the 
Free World! Who would you choose: Bill Bradley, George Bush, Jr., Bill Gates, 
Al Gore, Dan Quayle, or Linus Torvalds? You can cast your vote at 
<A HREF="http://www.linuxcare.com/">http://www.linuxcare.com</A>, until "Super Tuesday,"  March 2, which also

Xpresso Ltd  Needs Programmers
</font>
</H3>
<P>
Date: Mon, 22 Feb 1999 10:28:00 -0500<BR> 
I have a small company named Xpresso Ltd. This will hopefully produce a new
simple software system aimed at users of Windows.
The idea is to sell the Linux OS with the installation and set-up
completely 
automatic. It will use one or more choices of graphical user shells (KDE as
first 
default choice). 
The latest Linux Kernel 2.0.xx will be used (and built specifically for
each 
installation - with maths module if processor is without etc). The System
will 
analyse the hardware and construct or select the correct X Windows drivers
and 
install correct files ( /fstab etc). by examining the existing DOS/Windows
OS files 
or running MSD.EXE or similar.
I have very little finance and am hoping to find programmers who will help
me on 
a percentage basis. I shall be selling the product world-wide and hope
millions of 
units will be sold. Can you possibly help me with details of any sources of
programmers for this work please? The main aims are simple, safe (stable)
and 
visually attractive graphics. The user will do nothing except click GO.
Star Office 
and other quality free programs (only the best) will be included. But only
the best. 
To enable all Windows users to switch to Xpresso LINUX. A safe dual boot on
start up will enable the migration from Windows to Linux to proceed slowly,
at 
each person's pace. Can you help please? I can e-mail a four page outline
of my 
further plans for Linux if you are interested.

Linux for Coldfire
</font>
</H3>
<P>
Friday, 28th February 1999<BR> 
Greg Ungerer from Moreton Bay today announced the porting of the popular 
Linux operating system to the Motorola Coldfire family of processors. 
Source code for this Linux/Coldfire project is now available freely on 
the net at: <BR> 
<A HREF="http://www.moretonbay.com/coldfire/linux-coldfire.html">
http://www.moretonbay.com/coldfire/linux-coldfire.html</A> 
<P>
The Linux/Coldfire project is a port of a recent Linux kernel and, as 
with all ports of Linux, this is free software under the GNU Public 
License. The code is based on the recent stable linux kernel version 
2.0.33 and it includes the uC-linux patches applied. The libc, libm and 
user applications also come from the uC-linux work. 
<P>
What's a ColdFire?<BR> 
ColdFire is the newest family of microprocessors from Motorola. First 
released in 1994, ColdFire embodies a revolutionary variable-length RISC 
architecture that is designed to meet the requirements of the embedded 
consumer market.  <BR>

LyX-1.0.0 released

Date: Tue, 02 Feb 1999 21:58:22 +0200<BR> 
LyX is an advanced open source document processor running on many Unix
platforms. It is called a "document processor", because unlike standard 
word processors, LyX encourages an approach to writing based on the 
structure of your documents, not their appearance. LyX lets you 
concentrate on writing, leaving details of visual layout to the software. 
LyX automates formatting according to predefined rule sets, yielding 
consistency throughout even the most complex documents. LyX produces high 
quality, professional output -- using LaTeX, an open source, industrial 
strength typesetting engine, in the background.
<P>
LyX has undergone a quantum leap in functionality over the past 18 months. 
This release offers extensive control over fonts, margins, headers/footers, 
spacing/indents, justification, bullet types in multilevel lists, a 
sophisticated table editor, a version control interface for collaborative 
projects -- the list goes on and on. LyX 1.0 includes many standard formats 
and templates such as for letters, articles, books, overheads, even 
Hollywood scripts. Work continues on a growing library of "plug-in" formats 
and templates, in the best open-source tradition.
<P>
LyX runs on standard Unix platforms, including Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, 
Solaris, IRIX, HP-UX, AIX, ... even OS/2 and Cygnus/Win32 (somewhat 
experimentally), and provides native support for PostScript(tm) fonts 
and figures.

<P>
SAN JOSE, Calif., Mar. 1, 1999 - Spectra Logic Corp. today announced that
the company's Alexandria Backup and Archival Librarian(tm) software is the
first major backup software to support "hot" backup of Oracle8 and Oracle
Applications on the Linux operating system (OS). Alexandria 4.50 provides
Linux users with extensive backup and recovery tools that until now have
only been available in large corporate data centers.
<P> 
Alexandria 4.50 supports backup of Oracle databases without taking the
database offline via its Comprehensive Online Backup and Restore Agent
(COBRA), the industry's fastest and most reliable Oracle backup/restore
engine.  In Oracle production environments, COBRA automatically discovers
Oracle databases, including new tablespaces and datafiles, and puts the
tablespaces into backup mode.  Once the tablespaces are in backup mode and
the datafiles are backed up, the tablespaces are taken out of backup mode.
<P> 
Availability<BR> 
Alexandria 4.50 with support for Oracle on Linux is available today for Red
Hat Linux, Version 5.2.  Additional Oracle on Linux support is planned for
Caldera, SuSE and Turbo Linux OSes.  A single-user version of Alexandria is
available free for 45 days and can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.spectralogic.com">http://www.spectralogic.com/</A>.  At the end of
the 45-day trial period, the hot Oracle backup module can be purchased
