<h1>SQLite Tutorial: Common Commands and Triggers</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/chirico.html">Mike Chirico</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>This article explores common methods in SQLite such as running
commands from the shell prompt and creating triggers for
populating time stamped fields with either UTC or local time
values. In addition, delete, update, and insert trigger examples
will be explored in detail.</p>

<p>All examples can be found in <a href=
"http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/sqlite_examples.tar.gz?download">
sqlite_examples.tar.gz</a> (<a 
href="misc/chirico/sqlite_examples.tar.gz">local copy</a>), and I would 
encourage you to download and run these examples as you read through this 
document.</p>

<p>The home page for sqlite3 is www.sqlite.org and the source for
sqlite3 can be downloaded at <a href=
"http://www.sqlite.org/download.html">www.sqlite.org/download.htm.</a>
This tutorial was done with the source version 3.0.8</p>

<h3>Getting Started - Common Commands</h3>

<p>To create a database file, run the command "sqlite3" followed by
the database name. For example, to create the database "test.db"
run the sqlite3 command as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db
     SQLite version 3.0.8
     Enter ".help" for instructions
     sqlite&gt; .quit
     $
</pre>

<p>The database file test.db will be created, if it does not
already exist. Running this command will leave you in the sqlite3
environment. There are 3 ways to safely exit this environment (.q,
.quit, or .exit).</p>

<p>You do not have to enter the sqlite3 interactive environment.
Instead, you could perform all commands at the shell prompt, which
is ideal when running bash scripts and commands in an ssh string.
Below is an example of how you would create a simple table from the
command prompt.</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db  "create table t1 (t1key INTEGER 
                  PRIMARY KEY,data TEXT,num double,timeEnter DATE);"
</pre>

<p>After table t1 has been created, data can be inserted as
follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db  "insert into t1 (data,num) values ('This is sample data',3);"
     $ sqlite3 test.db  "insert into t1 (data,num) values ('More sample data',6);"
     $ sqlite3 test.db  "insert into t1 (data,num) values ('And a little more',9);"
</pre>

<p>As expected, doing a select returns the data in the table. Note,
the primary key "t1key" auto increments; however, there are no
default values for timeEnter. To populate the timeEnter field with
the time, an update trigger is needed. An important note on the
PRIMARY KEY: do not use the abbreviated "INT" when working with the
PRIMARY KEY. You must use "INTEGER", for the primary key to
update.</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db  "select * from t1 limit 2";
     1|This is sample data|3|
     2|More sample data|6|
</pre>

<p>In the statement above, the limit clause is used and only 2 rows
are displayed. For a quick reference of SQL syntax statements
available with SQLite, see the link <a href=
"http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html">syntax</a>. There is an offset
option to the limit clause. For instance, the third row is equal to
the following: "limit 1 offset 2".</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db "select * from t1 order by t1key limit 1 offset 2";
     3|And a little more|9|
</pre>

<p>The ".table" command shows the table names. For a more
comprehensive list of tables, triggers, and indexes created in the
database, query the master table "sqlite_master" as shown
below.</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db ".table"
     t1

     $ sqlite3 test.db "select * from sqlite_master"
     table|t1|t1|2|CREATE TABLE t1 (t1key INTEGER 
                  PRIMARY KEY,data TEXT,num double,timeEnter DATE)

</pre>

<p>All SQL information and data inserted into a database can be
extracted with the ".dump" command.</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db ".dump"
     BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     CREATE TABLE t1 (t1key INTEGER
                  PRIMARY KEY,data TEXT,num double,timeEnter DATE);
     INSERT INTO "t1" VALUES(1, 'This is sample data', 3, NULL);
     INSERT INTO "t1" VALUES(2, 'More sample data', 6, NULL);
     INSERT INTO "t1" VALUES(3, 'And a little more', 9, NULL);
     COMMIT;
</pre>

<p>The contents of the ".dump" can be filtered and piped to another
database. Below table t1 is changed to t2 with the sed command, and
it is piped into the test2.db database.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ sqlite3 test.db ".dump"|sed -e s/t1/t2/|sqlite3 test2.db
</pre>

<h3>Triggers</h3>

<p>An insert trigger is created below in the file "trigger1". The
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) will be entered into the field
"timeEnter", and this trigger will fire after a row has been
inserted into the table t1. Again, this trigger will fire after the
row has been inserted.</p>

<pre class="code">
     -- ********************************************************************
     --   Creating a trigger for timeEnter
     --     Run as follows:
     --            $ sqlite3 test.db &lt; trigger1
     -- ********************************************************************
     CREATE TRIGGER insert_t1_timeEnter AFTER  INSERT ON t1
     BEGIN
      UPDATE t1 SET timeEnter = DATETIME('NOW')  WHERE rowid = new.rowid;
     END;
     -- ********************************************************************
</pre>

<p>The AFTER specification in ..."insert_t1_timeEnter AFTER..." is
necessary. Without the AFTER keyword, the rowid would not have been
generated. This is a common source of errors with triggers, since
AFTER is NOT the default, so it must be specified. In summary, if
your trigger depends on newly created data, in any of the fields
from the created row, which was the case for us in this example
since we need the rowid, then, the AFTER specification is needed.
Otherwise, the trigger is a BEFORE trigger, and will fire before
rowid or other pertinent data is entered into the field.</p>

<p>Comments are preceded by "--". If this script was created in the
file "trigger1", you could easily execute this script as
follows.</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db &lt; trigger1
</pre>

<p>Now try entering a new record as before, and you should see the
time in the field timeEnter.</p>

<pre class="code">
     sqlite3 test.db  "insert into t1 (data,num) values ('First entry with timeEnter',19);"
</pre>

<p>Doing a select reveals the following data:</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 test.db "select * from t1";
     1|This is sample data|3|
     2|More sample data|6|
     3|And a little more|9|
     4|First entry with timeEnter|19|2004-10-02 15:12:19
</pre>

<p>If you look at the statement above, the last value has the
timeEnter filled in automatically with Coordinated Universal Time -
or (UTC). If you want local time, then, use select
datetime('now','localtime'). See the note at the end of this
section regarding UTC and local time.</p>

<p>For examples that follow the table "exam" and the database
"examScript" will be used. The table and trigger are defined below.
Just like the trigger above, UTC time will be used.</p>

<pre class="code">

                        fn        VARCHAR(15),                             
                        ln        VARCHAR(30),                             
                        exam      INTEGER,                                 
                        score     DOUBLE,                                  
                        timeEnter DATE);                                   
                                                                           
     CREATE TRIGGER insert_exam_timeEnter AFTER  INSERT ON exam            
     BEGIN                                                                 
                                                                           
     UPDATE exam SET timeEnter = DATETIME('NOW')                           
              WHERE rowid = new.rowid;                                     
     END;                                                                  
     -- *******************************************************************
     -- *******************************************************************
</pre>

<p>After the script file, it can be executed, by redirecting the
contents of the script file into the sqlite3 command, followed by
the database name. See the example below:</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 examdatabase &lt; examScript                            
     $ sqlite3 examdatabase "insert into exam (ln,fn,exam,score)   
            values ('Anderson','Bob',1,75)"                        
                                                                   
     $ sqlite3 examdatabase "select * from exam"                   
                                                                   
     1|Bob|Anderson|1|75|2004-10-02 15:25:00                       
</pre>

<p>And, as a check, the PRIMARY KEY and current UTC time have been
updated correctly, as seen from the above example.</p>

<h3>Logging All Inserts, Updates, and Deletes</h3>

<p>The script below creates the table examlog and three triggers
update_examlog, insert_examlog, and delete_examlog to record
update, inserts, and deletes made to the exam table. In other
words, anytime a change is made to the exam table, the changes will
be recorded in the examlog table, including the old value and the
new value. By the way if you are familiar with MySQL, the
functionality of this log table is similar to MySQL's binlog. See
<a href=
"http://voxel.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/souptonuts/README_mysql.txt">
(TIP 2, TIP 24 and TIP 25)</a> if you would like more information
on MySQL's log file.</p>

     END;                                                                  
     -- *******************************************************************

</pre>

<p>Since the script above has been created in the file examLOG, you
can execute the commands in sqlite3 as shown below. Also shown
below is a record insert, and an update to test these newly created
triggers.</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ sqlite3 examdatabase &lt; examLOG                            
                                                                    
     $ sqlite3 examdatabase "insert into exam                       
                               (ln,fn,exam,score)                   
                             values                                 
                               ('Anderson','Bob',2,80)"             
                                                                    
     $ sqlite3 examdatabase "update exam set score=82               
                                where                               
                              ln='Anderson' and fn='Bob' and exam=2"

</pre>

<p>Now, by doing the select statement below, you will see that
examlog contains an entry for the insert statement, plus two
updates. Although we only did one update on the command line, the
trigger "insert_exam_timeEnter" performed an update for the field
timeEnter -- this was the trigger defined in "examScript". On the
second update we can see that the score has been changed. The
trigger is working. Any change made to the table, whether by user
interaction or another trigger is recorded in the examlog.</p>

<pre class="code">
  $ sqlite3 examdatabase "select * from examlog"

  1|2||Bob||Anderson||2||80||INSERT|||2004-10-02 15:33:16
  2|2|2|Bob|Bob|Anderson|Anderson|2|2|80|80|UPDATE||2004-10-02 15:33:16|2004-10-02 15:33:16
  3|2|2|Bob|Bob|Anderson|Anderson|2|2|82|80|UPDATE|2004-10-02 15:33:16|2004-10-02 15:33:26|2004-10-02 15:33:26
</pre>

<p>Again, pay particular attention to the AFTER keyword. Remember
by default triggers are BEFORE, so you must specify AFTER to insure
that all new values will be available, if your trigger needs to
work with any new values.</p>

<h3>UTC and Local time</h3>

<p>Note, select DATETIME('NOW') returns UTC or Coordinated
Universal Time. But select datetime('now','localtime') returns the
current time.</p>

<pre class="code">
     sqlite&gt; select datetime('now');
     2004-10-18 23:32:34

     sqlite&gt; select datetime('now','localtime');
     2004-10-18 19:32:46
</pre>

<p>There is an advantage to inserting UTC time like we did with the
triggers above, since UTC can easily be converted to local time
after UTC has been entered in the table. See the command below. By
inserting UTC, you avoid problems when working with multiple
databases that may not share the same time zone and or daylight
savings time settings. By starting with UTC, you can always obtain
the local time.<br>
(Reference: <a href=
"http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/README_Working_With_Time.html?download">
Working with Time</a>)</p>

<pre class="code">
     CONVERTING TO LOCAL TIME:

     sqlite&gt; select datetime(timeEnter,'localtime') from exam;
</pre>

<h2>Other Date and Time Commands</h2>

<p>If you look in the sqlite3 source file "./src/date.c", you will
see that datetime takes other options. For example, to get the
local time, plus 3.5 seconds, plus 10 minutes, you would execute
the following command:</p>

<pre class="code">
     sqlite&gt; select datetime('now','localtime','+3.5 seconds','+10 minutes');
     2004-11-07 15:42:26
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to get the weekday where 0 = Sunday, 1 =
Monday, 2 = Tuesday ... 6 = Saturday.</p>

<pre class="code">
       sqlite&gt; select datetime('now','localtime','+3.5 seconds','weekday 2');
       2004-11-09 15:36:51
</pre>

<p>The complete list of options, or modifiers as they are called in
this file, are as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
       NNN days
       NNN hours
       NNN minutes
       NNN.NNNN seconds
       NNN months
       NNN years
       start of month
       start of year
       start of week
       start of day
       weekday N
       unixepoch
       localtime
       utc
</pre>

<p>In addition, there is the "strftime" function, which will take a
time string, and convert it to the specified format, with the
modifications. Here is the format for this function:</p>

<pre class="code">
     **    strftime( FORMAT, TIMESTRING, MOD, MOD, ...)
     **
     ** Return a string described by FORMAT.  Conversions as follows:
     **
     **   %d  day of month
     **   %f  ** fractional seconds  SS.SSS
     **   %H  hour 00-24
     **   %j  day of year 000-366
     **   %J  ** Julian day number
     **   %m  month 01-12
     **   %M  minute 00-59
     **   %s  seconds since 1970-01-01
     **   %S  seconds 00-59
     **   %w  day of week 0-6  sunday==0
     **   %W  week of year 00-53
     **   %Y  year 0000-9999
</pre>

<p>Below is an example.</p>

<pre class="code">
     sqlite&gt; select strftime("%m-%d-%Y %H:%M:%S %s %w %W",'now','localtime');
     11-07-2004 16:23:15 1099844595 0 44
</pre>

<h2>Simple Everyday Application</h2>

<h3>Keeping Notes in a Database</h3>

<p>This simple bash script (part of the <a
href="misc/chirico/sqlite_examples.tar.gz">sqlite_examples tarball</a>)
allows you to take notes. The notes consist of a line of text followed by
an optional category without the additional typing.</p>

<pre class="code">
 "sqlite3 &lt;database&gt; &lt;sql statement&gt;",
</pre>

<p>Instead, it is a simple one letter command.</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ n 'Take a look at sqlite3 transactions - 
           http://www.sqlite.org/lang.html#transaction' 'sqlite3'
</pre>

<p>The above statement enters the text into a notes table under the
category 'sqlite3'. Anytime a second field appears, it is
considered the category. To extract records for the day, I enter "n
-l", which is similar to "ls -l", to "note list".</p>

<p>With just "n" help is listed on all the commands.</p>

<pre class="code">
     $ n
     This command is used to list notes in 
     a database.
 
     n &lt;option&gt;                                  
      -l list all notes                          
      -t list notes for today                    
      -c list categories                         
      -f &lt;search string&gt; search for text          
      -e &lt;cmd&gt; execute command and add to notes  
      -d delete last entry                       
</pre>
