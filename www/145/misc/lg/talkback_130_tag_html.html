Hi,
</p>

<p>
          Talking about Linux Epson stylus 660 problems.  It has worked and
I printed an Open office letter to my sister okay.  But I was having
problems with gnome type and other apps.  This printer was fine under win 98
and since I have updated the HW I decided to get with modern software too.
Only hick my printer may or may not work.
</p>

<p>
          One of the frustrations is too many cooks and no chief.  Lots of
willing helper but not exactly plug and play. I have junked foomatic and
ghostscript and just have cups and gutenprint and Ubuntu.   All the detailed
stuff about sending this that and the other to the printer is a waste of
time.  The printer is stuck in the middle of a job despite canning all jobs
form both gnome and the Firefox type interface.  Even switching off/on the
printer seems to keep the job active somewhere.  I exited a terminal window
that I was using to send escputil stuff and the printer started up.  It's
really strange.  Previously the gnome and Firefox interface could not detect
the printer or parallel port.  The color ink led was on and I even changed
the ink cartridge to no avail.  There was nothing wrong with the original.
</p>

<p>
          Using the Firefox interface I have a choice of several drivers and
no idea what to use.  My printer prints the commands that it receives and
does not do what the software is telling it.  I am not really able to stop
printing and have a clean start.  Any ideas would be a great help as would
be a reset button for both SW and HW.
</p>

<p>
                    Regards Ian.

Hi, Ian -
</p>

<p>
You're probably unaware of this, but you sent your message in HTML

<p>
Please change your mailer's settings to stop it from doing this. For

<p>
I agree - but I suspect that we mean different things. From what I see
here, you are allowing too many different cooks in your kitchen - and
this is where the problem is coming from. Rather than taking random bits
of advice from here, there, and everywhere, why not try following one
set of instructions from a (hopefully coherent and reputable) single
source? That way, if they're wrong, you'll have learned something along
the way and you'll have better judgement in selecting a better source.
Picking one each from columns A, B, and C teaches you nothing and gives
you no opportunity to improve the process.
</p>

<p>
E.g., take the instructions from the article you're citing. You clearly
have not followed the advice in there - which I happen to have written -
since you're just guessing at which driver you should use. I gave
specific instructions and even URLs for figuring that out. So, what is
the point and the nature of your complaint? I fail to see it.
</p>

<p>
If you go back and follow the specific instructions in that article
<strong>and</strong> they fail to work, feel free to come back and say something; I,
for one, would be glad of the error report - and grateful enough to help
you with resolving the problem.
</p>


<pre>

&gt;    ghostscript and just have cups and gutenprint and Ubuntu.   All the
&gt;    detailed stuff about sending this that and the other to the printer is a

<p>
I'm afraid that you're not qualified to judge that, but thanks for your
opinion.

&gt;    switching off/on the printer seems to keep the job active somewhere.

<p>
Trying random things will create random results, yes. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<pre>
&gt;              Using the Firefox interface I have a choice of several drivers
&gt;    and no idea what to use.  
</pre>

<p>
Perhaps following the instructions - e.g.,
</p>

<pre>
[...] be sure to take a look at <a href="http://linuxprinting.org/suggested.html">http://linuxprinting.org/suggested.html</a>
and to search their database
(<a href="http://linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi?make=Anyone">http://linuxprinting.org/printer_list.cgi?make=Anyone</a>) for a specific
printer's rating, before making your final decision.
</pre>
would make good sense. The second link even has specifics on what
drivers to use with a given printer.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    My printer prints the commands that it receives
&gt;    and does not do what the software is telling it.  I am not really able to
&gt;    stop printing and have a clean start.  Any ideas would be a great help as
&gt;    would be a reset button for both SW and HW.
</pre>

<p>
Given your explanation, above, I'd look for multiple print servers
running at the same time, and perhaps check '/var/spool' to see if
there's anything untoward or unexpected is living there.

<p>
You're welcome, Ian in plain text. [grin]
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the whole "plug-and-pray" thing isn't as reliable as
Micr0s0ft would have you believe. True, there are a number of
peripherals that work fine with their products - but that's also true
under Linux. The difference is, things that don't work under Linux can
usually be <em>made</em> to work with a bit of research. Under Wind0ws, if it
doesn't work, you're simply screwed no matter how much research you do.
Given that this is usually happening after you've already paid lots of
money for both the OS and the driver (or, as is the case for most of the
world, after stealing both and exposing yourself to legal sanctions as
well as being morally in the wrong), that's not a dynamic that I find
tolerable in my world. Spending a little time learning to make things
work carries neither a legal nor a moral burden - so that's the path I
choose.
</p>

<p>
I don't have a problem with those who choose to use something else, but
getting a free OS, free programs, and free support and then complaining
about everything not being perfect - as opposed to, say, lending a hand
in getting it to be better - seems to me like failing to acknowledge a
debt. You might want to think about that.

Hi Ben, Ian in plain text I hope.  I had to add myself to the group lp
and now I can print the text file 
</p>

<pre>
head -60 /home/stanley82/Artwork/PCB_elements.fp/Trig_HS.fp &gt; /dev/lp0
</pre>
which is a really good start.  I did it a couple of times.
</p>

<p>
    Going into System administration printing add printer (gnome cups
ad) and something is detected on the parallel port but it does not know
what.  I can tell it to use the parallel port and select Epson color
stylus 660 but I do not know where to find the driver (escp2-660 I
believe) and i  since the printer was not detected it may not be a good
thing to press on.
</p>

<p>
    So I have got as far as... 
<pre>
At this point, the basic printer test (i.e., dumping text to the device)
should be working fine. Install your choice of queue manager (e.g.,
CUPS, 'lpr', 'lprng', etc.) and the appropriate
filters/drivers/definition files for your printer (Gnome-Print,
'hp-ppd', 'linuxprinting.org-ppds', etc.). You're ready to go! ... 
</pre>
        and I'm stuck.  
    My packet manager tells me ... 
<pre>
Gutenprint - Top Quality Printer Drivers
A very high quality package of printer drivers for Ghostscript and
CUPS, mainly for Epson inkjet printers, but also for inkjets from
Canon and HP, dye sublimation photo printers, and PCL laser printers.
</p>

<p>
(Converted from a rpm package by alien version 8.65.)
</pre>
    So I would be really pleased to receive another push in the back.
</p>

<p>
        Best Regards Ian.

A printer driver just defines a set of codes that are sent to the
printer to get it to perform specific actions. If you pick the wrong
one, nothing bad will happen: the printer simply will not do what it's
supposed to do, at which point you can try another driver.
</p>

<p>
The URLs I recommended list the specific driver needed for a given
printer. I.e., the Epson 660 listing
(<a href="http://linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Epson-Stylus_Color_660">http://linuxprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Epson-Stylus_Color_660</a>)
gives the following info:
</p>

<pre>
    Epson Stylus Color 660
    Color inkjet printer, max. 1440x720 dpi, works Perfectly
    Recommended driver: gutenprint (Home page, driver for: x86 32 bit, x86 64 bit, How to install)
    Generic instructions for: CUPS, LPD, LPRng, PPR, PDQ, no spooler
</pre>
There's more info there, and a number of relevant links. Meanwhile, it
looks like 'gutenprint' is the recommended driver.

Install that package, and use the recommended driver in your CUPS
configuration. I find their web interface quite easy to use.

Hi Ben,
	thanks again.  I've been through most of this stuff.  I junked all my
printers and made a new one using the web interface as the gnome
interface asks me to find a driver and I do not know were to look.
Printing a test page results in lots of top left only on other wise
empty pages.  It was fine using your head 
<pre>
(head
-60 /home/stanley82/Artwork/PCB_elements.fp/Trig_HS.fp &gt; /dev/lp0
) 
</pre>
from a terminal window.  Now the printer is stuck in the middle of a
long long test page.  Going into gnome printer properties these are the
drivers which do not look at all like what I was expecting.
</p>

<pre>
PCL 4
PCL 5
PCL 5c
PCL 5e
PCL 6/PCL XL  ;
</pre>
I'm using this one 
<pre>
ZjStream
</pre>
I am using this connection
<pre>
IPP Printer or printer on cUPS server (IPP)
</pre>

start a terminal/console and check with "ps aux" <strong>which</strong> process looks

as simple as a "cat" command.  Then you can at least stop the data

<p>
As far as I know PCL is HPish while Epson uses a quite different
printing language (ESCP? ). So checkout where your epson drivers are....

<p>
Here a "locate gutenprint" says:
</p>

<pre>
/usr/lib/gutenprint/5.0.0.99.1/modules/print-escp2.la
</pre>
which would probably drive your epson just nicely. 
</p>


<p>
from skimming through all the old (and mostly not necessary) included
old mail I do not really see that you actually tried to configure your
cups system by using the *CUPS CONFIG WEBPAGE*
</p>

<p>
It might or might not work with gnome/kde/XYZ frontends. But please try
to go through the webpage:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://localhost:631/">http://localhost:631/</a>
</p>

<p>
this talks <strong>directly</strong> to cups and you can add new printers. Dont choose
a "detected new printer" if that failed earlier, but just go to "add
printer", interface like "lpt1" and then choose  the manufacturer (epson) 
then I get a huge list of printers including the Stylus color 660. 
</p>


<p>
If that really still has no option for your Stylus ---
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Epson-Stylus_Color_660">http://openprinting.org/show_printer.cgi?recnum=Epson-Stylus_Color_660</a>
</p>

<p>
actually says "gutenprint" without any further details WHICH gutenprint
driver..... 
</p>

<pre>

<p>
DO NOT use the the "preconfigured" "LPT1 (Epson)". 
</p>

<p>
Use Add-printer, give its names, tell the webpage it's on parallel 1 --
nothing else. 
</p>

<p>
Then this ILL ask with a pure manufacturer list, choose epson, the list
of availabpe printers in the "model" windo is on the next page then.

so congrats to have gotten through that particular tricky spot in the
interface. 
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Head clean does not work I'll look into that later so many thanks for
&gt; all the  help from yourself and Ben.  Regards Ian.
</pre>

<p>
have a look at that escputil pack -- might contain cleaning routines etc. 
</p>


<p>
And remembering my last inkjet from a few years back -- an early espon
stylus -- you can use button-combination on the printer to trigger
cleainng.

Hi, Ian -
</p>

<p>
I have added TAG back to the list of recipients again; please make
certain that you're CCing TAG on an all these exchanges in the future.
The only way that we get "paid" for doing this is by publishing the
discussions in the Linux Gazette, where the rest of the community gets
to benefit from them. Several of us do offer private support and
tutoring, but those are <strong>not</strong> free.

&gt;    My
&gt;    problem was that I was selecting the parallel port for epson.  This gives
&gt;    me a choice of six or so IBMish drivers.  When I selected LPT #1 I only
&gt;    had to follow my nose.  I guess this is a cups feature non-desire?

<p>
Well, since you were printing to /dev/lp0 (as I recall), then - yes,
"LPT1:" would be the equivalent. However, your nose should not be
required - the choices from that point forward should be obvious.
"Epson" for a manufacturer, and "Stylus 660 + gutenprint"... doesn't
seem like it could get much simpler than that.

<p>
I went wrong on the first sniff Parallel Epson triggered me not LPT #1.
Once in Parallel Epson it's wrong.  The only way out is to junk and
re-start printer installation.  There is no BACK one step that I could
see.  Once LPT #1 it like you said is obvious.  I also read that Epson
financed gutenprint and/or cups to do some driver work.  It struck me at
the time as great that they would have a special branch for Epson.  What
is a parallel Epson port for?  Why does Karl suggest that this branch
leads you to IBMish drivers?

<p>
I'm not quite sure what that branch is meant to do.... from the
available  driver selection it probably should read:
</p>

<pre>
ANCIENT GENERIC DRIVERS (EPSON MATRIX, PCL capable printers)
</pre>
And I can't recall saying IBMish.... PCL is HPs standard language. 
</p>


<p>
Occasionally cups actually told me on the start page that I've a new
printer and installing that DID work out well. But more often than not
it can't detect them properly and doesn't show actual new ones or wrong
ones. Going through the "interface, manufacturer, model" on the other
hand works most of the time very well.
