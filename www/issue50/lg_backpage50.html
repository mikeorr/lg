Marius is 19 years old, and a student in the first year at Politehnica
Bucharest, Romania.  Besides Linux, he also loves music (from rock to dance),
dancing, having fun, spending time with friends. He is interested also in
science in general (and that quantum spooky connection :) and says, <EM>"I like
cooking (okay, maybe I don't like it a lot, but I have to cook because I live
alone while I'm at studies in Bucharest. Poor me :-) poor neighbours :-)"</EM>

Part computer programmer, part cartoonist, part Mars Bar. At night, he runs
around in a pair of colorful tights fighting criminals. During the day... well,
he just runs around.  He eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's sleepy.

I am a new linux enthusiast who has been following the trend for over a
year now. I have successfully installed Debian and participate in
helping bring Linux to more people. I have been working with computers
for seven years on my own, learning as much as possible. I currently am
looking for a sales position within the Linux community. Talks are under
way with VALinux; my dream company. I have been a volunteer for both
Debian and LPI.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">JC Pollman and Bill Mote</H4>
JC has been playing with Linux since kernel 1.0.59. He spend way too much
time at the keyboard and even let his day job - the military - interfere once in
a while. His biggest concern about linux is the lack of documentation for the
intermediate user. There is already too much beginner's stuff, and the
professional material is often beyond the new enthusiast.

<P> Bill is the Technical Support Services manager for a multi-billion dollar
publishing company and is responsible for providing 1st and 2nd level
support services to their 500+ road-warrior sales force as well as their
3,500 workstation and laptop users.  He was introduced to Linux by a good
friend in 1996 and thought Slackware was the end-all-be-all of the OS world
... until he found Mandrake in early 1999.  Since then he's used his
documentation skills to help those new to Linux find their way.

<P> In late January, I went to the 8th International 
<A HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A> conference in 
Arlington, VA, and attended the
<A HREF="http://www.zope.org">Zope</A> track.  I have been a Python enthusiast
for several years, and have recently gotten excited about Zope, which is a
web application server.  I came back with a year's worth of projects in my
head, and zopified my personal sites (<A
HREF="http://mso.oz.net">mso.oz.net</A>) last weekend.  Now comes the harder
part: actually writing applications for this platform, especially since parts
of Zope are still in an alpha stage and are changing rapidly.  

<P> Eventually, the <EM>Gazette</EM> itself may migrate to a more interactive
environment like Zope.  However, because the <EM>Gazette's</EM> unique
distribution network depends on it being implemented in simple HTML which can
be viewed anywhere (including off-line), we will think long and hard before
making any major changes which may limit its accessibility.

<P> The folks who brought you the WTO protests are at it again with a plan to
<STRONG>Shut Down Microsoft</STRONG>.  There will be a street theater action
February 7th at 7:15am.  (Ugh, so early in the morning.)  If you will be in the
Seattle area and want more information on this, contact Direct Action Network
at 206-632-1656 or 206-632-9482.  I will try to have a report in next month's
<EM>Gazette</EM> on how it turns out.  (Does this remind anybody of the
<A HREF="http://www.svlug.org/events/tea-party-199811.shtml">
Silicon Valley Tea Party</A>, when Linux enthusiasts crashed the
housewarming party for a Microsoft developer support center in Palo Alto, CA,
in 1998?  Of course, the upcoming event will not be focused specifically on
Linux.)

<P> Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
Have fun!
