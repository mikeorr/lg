<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Occasionally system administrators can run into situations where 
the conventional way of
troubleshooting an issue may not yield results. The conventional way
means using test scripts, observing the log files, tweaking
configuration settings and the like. In such cases, one will have to dig
deeper into the internals of the server. <b>Strace</b> proves to
be a valuable tool in such situations. The <b>strace</b> utility
intercepts and records the system calls which are made by a
process and the signals which are received by a process. This
article shows how to use <b>strace</b> to troubleshoot Apache by
illustrating a real-world issue. I will begin with the problem
statement and then move on to describe the initial troubleshooting
attempts. The inner workings of the Apache server are briefly explained just
before examining the strace results. Various options of <b>strace</b>
and its internal working is beyond the scope of this article,
so please refer to the man pages for the same.</p>

<h3>Problem statement</h3>

<p>
<b>ISSUE</b>: Can't send mail from web pages using PHP 'mail()'
function.<br>
<b>OS</b>: RedHat<br>
<b>SMTP Server</b>: Sendmail<br>
<b>Web Server</b>: Apache/1.3.22 - It's a virtual hosting
environment, there are many sites hosted in the server.<br>
<b>PHP version</b>: 4.0.6<br>
</p>
<!-- SCNR: Anyone running Apache 1.3.22 and PHP 4.0.6 may have more troubles
     than mail delivery... (pfeiffer) -->

<h3>Initial troubleshooting attempts</h3>

<p>
Let me first recreate the issue and see the error for myself. I
will create a test script, 'mail.php', that will use the 'mail()'
function for sending mail. The test script is as follows.
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;?php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
$to = "Vishnu &lt;we2cares@fastmail.fm&gt;";
$subject = "This is a test email";
$message = "This is a test email, please ignore.";

if (mail($to,$subject,$message))
{
echo "Thank you for sending email";
}
else
{
echo "Can't send email";
}
?&gt;
</pre>

<p>I placed mail.php into the web area of the virtual domain in question,
and then accessed it through a browser. The resulting page
displayed an echoed message "Can't send email", no PHP specific
error messages were shown. Analyzing the maillog shows no trace of
mail injected from the virtual domain in question. I needed to verify
whether the issue is specific to the virtual host in question or
whether the issue is server wide. The same test script was used in a few
other virtual hosts and produced the same result. That means the issue
is not specific to a virtual host, it's a server wide issue. Looks
like Apache/PHP is broken.</p>

<p>Let me see whether the mail() function is disabled in the
php.ini file using <b>disable_functions</b>.</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@dns1 root]# grep disable_functions /etc/php.ini
disable_functions =
</pre>

<p>No, mail function is not disabled.</p>

<p>I have turned on <b>display_errors</b> and
<b>display_startup_errors</b> in php.ini so that any internal PHP
error is displayed on the web page, but that didn't help either.
The test PHP page doesn't display any error, there are no error
messages in the Apache, sendmail or other system logs. What
next?</p>

<!-- Ok, sorry, now I have to say something. -->

<p class="editorial">[ When debugging a production system be sure to use
your development system (which, by the way, should be identical to and
separate from your production environment). If you cannot avoid using the
production system for this, make sure your error messages are never
displayed to the browser and redirect them to your logs. This is more
secure and doesn't bother your end users with messages they can't
understand. -- Ren&eacute; ]
</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, in order to know what's happening 
at the process level, the <b>strace</b> utility is very useful.
Before using <b>strace</b> to troubleshoot the issue, I will give a
brief explanation of how Apache serves an incoming request.</p>

<h3>Detour into Apache</h3>

<p>Apache starts by creating a parent process with root privileges.
This is the main process, it is responsible for forking child
processes and maintaining them. The main Apache process doesn't
serve any requests, the requests are served by child processes.
The number of idle child processes at a given time is determined
by the <b>MinSpareServers</b> and <b>MaxSpareServers</b> directives
in <b>httpd.conf</b>. When a new request comes in, it is served by
one of the idle child processes. If there are no idle child processes,
then a new child process is forked by the parent, to serve an
incoming request. From the <b>ps</b> result shown below, it's clear
the the process with PID 1861 is the Apache parent process. It is
running with "root" privileges, all the child processes are running
as user "apache".
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@haqmail ~]# ps aux | grep httpd
USER       PID %CPU      %MEM           VSZ  RSS TTY      STAT        START   TIME     COMMAND
root      1861  0.0      0.4           25680 1992 ?        Ss         Sep24   0:02     /usr/sbin/httpd
apache    2295  0.0      0.4           25852 2024 ?        S          Sep24   0:00     /usr/sbin/httpd
apache    2296  0.0      0.4           25852 2024 ?        S          Sep24   0:00     /usr/sbin/httpd
apache    2297  0.0      0.4           25852 2024 ?        S          Sep24   0:00     /usr/sbin/httpd
apache    2298  0.0      0.4           25852 2024 ?        S          Sep24   0:00     /usr/sbin/httpd
apache    2299  0.0      0.4           25852 2024 ?        S          Sep24   0:00     /usr/sbin/httpd
apache    2300  0.0      0.4           25852 2024 ?        S          Sep24   0:00     /usr/sbin/httpd
apache    2301  0.0      0.4           25852 2024 ?        S          Sep24   0:00     /usr/sbin/httpd
apache    2302  0.0      0.4           25852 2024 ?        S          Sep24   0:00     /usr/sbin/httpd
</pre>

<p>A better view of parent child relationship is available from the
<b>pstree</b> result.</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@haqmail ~]# pstree -p | grep httpd
        +-httpd(1861)---httpd(2295)
        |             +-httpd(2296)
        |             +-httpd(2297)
        |             +-httpd(2298)
        |             +-httpd(2299)
        |             +-httpd(2300)
        |             +-httpd(2301)
        |             +-httpd(2302)
</pre>

<h3>Using strace</h3>

<p>Now we know that our request for mail.php is served by one of
the Apache child processes and that <b>strace</b> can be used to
get details of how requests are served, but there is one more
problem: Which child process serves the mail.php request? We either
know the process ID of the exact child process, or we 
trace all the child processes and then sort out the output of strace. There is no way to
know in advance which child process will serve the mail.php
request, so we will have to trace the parent Apache and all its
child processes. The "-f" <b>strace</b> option traces child
processes as they are created by currently traced processes as a
result of the 'fork' system call.</p>

<p>Here we go...<br>
First stop Apache and then restart Apache with <b>strace</b>.</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@dns1 root]# strace -f -o trace.txt /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start
</pre>

<p>The "-o" option saves the result to "trace.txt" file. Now access
the test PHP page through the browser. Stop <b>strace</b> and 
restart Apache as usual. It may be necessary to send the <b>strace</b> process
a SIGKILL signal, because it captures some signals it gets from the terminal
session.
</p>

<p>Let us now go ahead and examine the <b>strace</b> result in the
trace.txt file.</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@dns1 root]# grep mail.php trace.txt
21837 read(7, "GET /mail.php HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Age"..., 4096) = 472
21837 stat64("/var/www/virtdomain/mail.php", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=587, ...}) = 0
</pre>

<p>From the above <b>grep</b> result it's clear that the Apache
child process serving our request for mail.php is the one
with PID "21837". Now <b>grep</b> trace.txt for "21837". Relevant
result is pasted below.</p>

<pre class="code">
21837 chdir("/var/www/virtdomaint") = 0
21837 open("/var/www/virtdomain/mail.php", O_RDONLY) = 8
.
.
.
.
21837 fork() = 21844
</pre>

<p>The last line shows that the Apache child process forks another process
with PID 21844. Let us <b>grep</b> for 21844 in trace.txt and see
what it does.</p>

<pre class="code">
21844 execve("/bin/sh", ["sh", "-c", "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i"], [/* 21 vars */]) = -1 EACCES (Permission denied)
</pre>

<p>Well, the process is used for sending mail using /usr/sbin/sendmail,
but an incorrect permissions prevent it doing so. Sendmail
permissions are set correctly, but checking /bin/sh reveals that it is
set to "770" with "root.root" ownership. Since the Apache child
process is running as user "apache", it doesn't have read and
execute permission over /bin/sh, and hence the issue. Changing
/bin/sh permission to "755" fixed it.</p>

<p class="editorial"> [ At this point I'd be inclined to wonder <em>why</em>
the file permissions were wrong. It could be that someone is tip-toeing
through your filesystem. -- Steve Brown ] </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>With a basic understanding of Apache and using <b>strace</b>,
we could find the root cause of the issue and hence fix it.
<b>Strace</b> is a general purpose utility and it can be used to
troubleshoot any program. <b>Strace</b> and <b>GDB</b> (GNU
Debugger) are very useful in system level troubleshooting. <a href=
