# Do port forwarding for the server on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https)
# Note for readability I use the actual service names instead of the
# port numbers. Linux will automagically interpret the appropriate
# ports from the /etc/services file.
# Since the port forwarding code doesn't have anything like
# the '-b' switch in ipchains (meaning bidirectional), we have
# to make two separate statements for each port forwarded -
# one for incoming, and one for outgoing
