<h1>Design Awareness: For Prince Henry and St. Brendan!</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/seymour.html">Mark Seymour</A></b></p>

<p>

<p><a name="top"></a>This was <i>supposed</i> to be a month in which I did
some navigating of my own (I'm currently awaiting a hiring decision which
will require me to, hopefully, relocate to the same port of call as the
editor of this very publication), so I thought we'd look at navigation on
the internet.</p>

<p>To get to this page, of course, you already had to click on a link from
the table of contents for this issue of Linux Gazette. That required
clicking on another link from the LG home page itself. That home page was
acquired either by a bookmark from within your browser, or a prompting link
displayed in an email.</p>

<p>These chains of links are so common now that we hardly notice them; I
get dozens of emails a week from friends with URLs embedded in them and, if
the context seems interesting, click on them without even reading the HTTP
address.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ This is, of course, very dangerous behavior - but
it's very common as well. URLs can very easily be used as traps for the
unwary: e.g, the HTML version where the link text is completely different
from the link target; the "misspelled" URL that's one letter off from a
bank site - and LOOKS exactly like that bank site as well; the "trick" URL
such as <a
href="http://microsoft.com\important\free\download\no\really@3515134258">
http://microsoft.com\important\free\download\no\really@3515134258</a>
(most, but not all browsers these days are too smart for this; when opened
with, e.g. "links" or many version of Internet Explorer, the above will
take you to <a href="http://redhat.com">http://redhat.com</a>); etc. Caveat
emptor... -- Ben ]</p> 

<p>But it's when we finally arrive at a page whose contents we intend to
explore, that internet navigation really takes over. The distinction is so
significant that I'm going to assay some jargon creation here:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>inter</b>navigation is what you do to get to a page or pages of
interest (clicking on URLs or icons or text links, in an email or on some
other site) in a particular site
<li><b>intra</b>navigation is what you do once you get there
</ul>

<p>These are examples of internavigation we see every day:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank"><img src="misc/seymour/Apple.png" alt="" height="50" width="50" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Hey, go check out the latest stuff at the <a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple store</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.apple.com" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com</a></p>
</div>

<p>Because of the commonly-accepted convention that blue text, especially
when underlined, is intended as a link to <font color="blue">Somewhere
Else</font>, we immediately roll our mouse over it and click without
pondering what will happen: if it's blue and/or it's underlined, it had
better take us somewhere when we click on it, right? But when
<i>nothing</i> happens (because the linkage is broken or the designer
underlined and/or made blue the text without intending it to be a link), we
get startled, and then usually get pissed off. (The little gloved hand icon
is a good indicator that something, blue or not, is a link, but it doesn't,
alas, work on all browsers and all operating systems and all pages.)</p>

<p>But now you've internavigated to a particular page, like this one, and
you want to move about, not only within the displayed page but among the
pages of the site.</p>

<p>Anchors are a simple way of navigating a single page; you will often see
the word <a href="#top">Top</a> or the phrases <a href="#top">Back to
top</a> or <a href="#top">Top of page</a> used to bring you back up from a
long descent into a page's content. (If you click any of these, you
<i>will</i> go to the top of the page.) Text linked to anchors can also
provide a way to move quickly to related material, whether on the same page
or another page.</p>

<p>The reason to return to the start of the page, of course, is to provide
access to navigation tools. <b>Inter</b>navigation tools are typically
icons or text buttons, which represent links to pages within the site or on
other sites. <b>Intra</b>navigation tools, unfortunately, often look
exactly the same; making them look different (especially from tools that
take you out of the site) is tricky, but worthwhile.</p>

<p>Even if they don't have any graphic quality to them, linked-text tools
are really buttons (these are just examples and don't really go anywhere,
so don't bother clicking them, even though they're blue and
underlined):</p>

<div align="center">
<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td><font color="blue"><u>Home</u></font></td>
<td><font color="blue"><u>About us</u></font></td>
<td><font color="blue"><u>Contact us</u></font></td>
<td><font color="blue"><u>Legalisms</u></font></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>With some modest formatting, they begin to look more like 'real'
navigation tools (don't click these either):</p>

<div align="center">
<table border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="yellow" width="100" height="25">
<div align="center">
<font color="#fc7e00">Home</font></div>
</td>
<td bgcolor="#ffc100" width="100" height="25">
<div align="center">
<font color="white">About us</font></div>
</td>
<td bgcolor="#ff7e00" width="100" height="25">
<div align="center">
<font color="white">Contact us</font></div>
</td>
<td bgcolor="#ff5920" width="100" height="25">
<div align="center">
<font color="white">Legalisms</font></div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>But what should they look like? Are they part of the 'design', or are
they just HTML-generated buttons like these?</p>

<p><button name="buttonName" type="button">Home</button><button
name="buttonName" type="button">About us</button><button name="buttonName"
type="button">Contact us</button> <button name="buttonName"
type="button">Legalisms</button></p>

<p>The other problem that comes up is, where to put them? Do you just run
them across the top of the page, as these might be? What then happens when
you want to add more (or, more properly, the client wants you to add more,
a lot more, like maybe a dozen more)? Do you make them smaller? Run them in
two lines? (Don't laugh, you'll see that farther along.)</p>

<p>Or do you start to stack them down the left side of the page? If so,
should they be in their own frame, so that they always stay visible as you
scroll down the page?</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="yellow" width="100" height="25">
<font color="#fc7e00">Home</font>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffc100" width="100" height="25">
<font color="white">About us</font>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ff7e00" width="100" height="25">
<font color="white">Contact us</font>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ff5920" width="100" height="25">
<font color="white">Legalisms</font>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A non-scrolling frame has its own awkwardness, of course, and seems to
have fallen out of favor with many designers. But a list of buttons down
the left side is almost a universal solution these days, as shown in these
(half-size) examples (none of which are in non-scrolling frames, by the
way):</p>

<p><a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa"><img src="misc/seymour/appleverticalbar.png" alt="" width="70" height="261" align="top" border="0"></a> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/"><img src="misc/seymour/microsoftbar.png" alt="" width="90" height="143" align="top" border="0"></a> <a href="http://www.ebay.com"><img src="misc/seymour/ebayverticalbar.png" alt="" width="94" height="245" align="top" border="0"></a> <a href="http://www.turbotax.com/tax_products/learnpremier.html"><img src="misc/seymour/turbotaxverticalbar.png" alt="" width="91" height="264" border="0"></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com"><img src="misc/seymour/amazonbar.png" alt="" width="95" height="320" align="top" border="0"></a></p>

<p>The same issues apply to navigation bars at the top of the page, as shown in these examples (see, two lines!):</p>

<div align="center">
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/"><img src="misc/seymour/applebar.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/"><img src="misc/seymour/microsofthorizontalbar.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com"><img src="misc/seymour/amazonverticalbar.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
</div>

<p>Running out of room everywhere else, sites are beginning to wrestle with
navigation at the <b>bottom</b> of the page:</p>

<div align="center">
<p><a href="http://www.weather.com/"><img src="misc/seymour/weatherbottombar.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.altavista.com/"><img src="misc/seymour/altavistabottombar.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
</div>

<p><img src="misc/seymour/weatherdotcom.jpg" alt="" border="0" align="left">
But for a look at some <i>really </i>exciting navigation issues, let's
try weather.com (click here to go to a <a
href="pages/seymour/weatherpage.html" target="_blank">full-size version</a>
or to the <a
href="http://www.weather.com/maps/garden.html?from=globalnav">actual
page</a>):</p>

<p> Now <b>there's</b> some visual complication! You've got (roughly, from
the top) blue underlined links, button links, a data-entry box, a pop-up
requiring a 'go' button, a reversed underlined page link, radio buttons, a
selection list, a clickable image, blue underlined links, another selection
list, another date-entry box with its 'go' button, blue underlined links in
an unnumbered list, blue underlined links with clickable images, yet more
blue underlined links, a data-entry search box with yet another 'go'
button, and bottom navigation using many black underlined links, reversed
underlined links, and blue underlined (though not in blue, just to be
different) links. Whew.</p>

<p>This shows what we've grown accustomed to as 'conventions', even for
links to other pages: traditional (and now almost quaint) blue underlined
text, buttons, images, and text of varying colors and underlining. You can
tout your ability to do CSS and 'handcoding' all you want, but if you can't
decide what a link should look like better than that, I don't want to hear
about it.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, we've gotten so used to information overload that (most of
the time) we can focus on what's important to us, even in a page as complex
as this one. On the other hand, <i>why should we have to</i>? Why does
every page have to have access to every other possible page in the site? By
my count, there are links to over one hundred other internal pages on that
one weather.com page. That's like putting the entire table of contents on
every page of a book, just in case...</p>

<br>

<div align="center">
<p><img src="misc/seymour/weatherheader1.png" alt="" border="0"><br>
<img src="misc/seymour/weatherheader2.png" alt="" border="0"></p>
</div>

<p>If the two header bars shown above, after being carefully introduced on
an earlier page, were merely used as links at the bottom to 'jump' pages
carrying a list of the 80-odd other pages they represent, not only would it
save a lot of page room (hey, every bit helps when you're paying for
transmission or waiting for bandwidth), but reduce eye irritation
immensely.</p>

<p>Okay, we're looked at several 'professional' web layouts, and seen a few
constants:</p>

<ul>
<li>navigation is difficult to keep simple while still allowing access to a broad and deep site
<li>navigation can (though perhaps it shouldn't) be found all across a given page
<li>navigation tools have lost whatever conventions the web started with, and can look like anything on a page
</ul>

<p>My advice for <b>inter</b>navigation and <b>intra</b>navigation tools is
this: determine your internal conventions early and <i>stick to
them</i>.</p>

<p>Some rules, for those who like rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>distinguish between <i>inter</i>navigation tools (you're going to some
other site entirely if you click <b><font color="red">here</font></b> or
click <font color="red"><b>www.somewhere-else.com</b></font>) and
<i>intra</i>navigation tools (you're going to some other page on this site
if you click <font color="blue"><b>here</b></font> and you're going
somewhere else on this page if you click <font
color="blue"><u>here</u></font>) on the landing page (and as many 'early'
pages as necessary to cover all eventualities) and never vary them
<ul>
<li>if <font color="blue"><u>blue underlined</u></font> text defines a link for you, make it so <i>all the time</i>, design be damned
<li>if you <i>must</i> break that rule, announce it some other way: &quot;Click <b><font color="red">here</font></b> to go <font color="red">Somewhere Else</font>&quot;
</ul>
<li>keep buttons to themselves
<ul>
<li>don't sprinkle navigation all across the page; the user got used to
where you put it on the early landing pages
<li>don't make the user scroll a long way up and down (or side to side) to
get to the buttons; if your pages have to be really long to fit your
content, park an occasional <font color="blue">Top</font> button that takes
them back to the tool area
<li>make buttons look like buttons; most HTML applications have button
generators, but you can make your own in GIMP or Photoshop just as easily,
with better results. Using words (even if defined early on as above) as
buttons without some 'button-ness' to them only makes the user work harder;
the standard words-in-a-line solution like this one is better than nothing,
but just barely (I think it's lazy, but it might be necessary in a big site
with constant changes):
</ul>
<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.weather.com/"><img src="misc/seymour/weather.png" alt="" border="0"></a>
</p>

<ul>
<li>you can't have too many ways for the user to get where they want to go;
if you have images next to linked text, link the images, too. (Banging away
at an image that represents where they want to go, with nothing happening
as a result, sends users elsewhere in a hurry.) But if you have text next
to linked images, be sure to link some portion of the text as well; some
users like images and some users like text, so give them both.
<li>put a &quot;<font color="blue">Click here to go to the beautiful and
helpful map of this site</font>&quot; link or button (and make sure the
user knows what it is if you use a button; a cute little map image is fine
if you defined it earlier) on every page. A properly designed site map will
quickly solve any user confusion and reduce the number of navigational
tools you need on every page
</ul>

<p>So, you hate rules. If you're not going to follow any of my rules, make
damn sure you define your links early on: &quot;Links on this site are
indicated by flashing green elves and/or tiny red bullets and/or photos of
my dog&quot;. (Make sure you have good behavior tracking software
installed, too, so you can watch users departing your site at high
velocity...) If you're creating some totally 'personal' site, it may not
matter. If you expect users to enjoy using your site, buy things from you,
tell their friends about you (you have heard of viral marketing, right?),
and come back again, better come up with your own rules that work.
Remember, all anyone expects of your site is exactly what <i>they</i> want
to do, not what your design wants them to do. Make it easy for them.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Top of page</a>, just because I said you should.</p>
<hr width="20%">

<p>If you've gotten this far, you're probably wondering about the title of
this month's column. Besides being a swipe of a line from one of my
favorite speeches in Shakespeare (&quot;<i>...for Harry, England, and Saint
George!</i>&quot; from the battlefield scene in <i>Henry V</i>), it
recognizes two people, either of whom <i>ought</i> to be the patron saint
of web designers, Prince Henry the Navigator and St. Brendan the Navigator.
(Are we seeing a navigation theme here?)</p>

<p> <a
href="http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/portuguese_exp.php#prince"><img
src="misc/seymour/PrinceHenry.jpg" alt="" height="86" width="60" border="0"
align="left"> Prince Henry</a>, the son of the King of Portugal in the
fifteenth century, organized and bankrolled numerous expeditions which
expanded both Portuguese influence and maritime knowledge along the western
edge of Africa, ultimately leading to Bartolomeu Dia's voyage at the start
of the sixteenth century that finally rounded the Cape of Good Hope and
opened the ocean route to the riches of the East.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02758c.htm"><img
src="misc/seymour/Brendan.jpg" alt="" height="85" width="72" border="0"
align="right">St. Brendan</a> was, if the stories are true (and if you
think they're not, I suggest you have some more whisky until you do), the
first person to reach the Western Hemisphere from Europe in the sixth
century (well before that other guy whose Day we celebrate merely for doing
it a thousand years later), traveling west in a hide boat from Ireland. He
<i>is</i> the patron saint of navigators, and with the right PR behind him
might well have become the patron saint of the internet instead of this
guy:</p>

<p><a
href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,49995,00.html?tw=wn_story_related"><img
src="misc/seymour/Isidore.jpg" alt="" height="83" width="60" border="0"
align="left"> St. Isidore</a>, the front-runner in the race to become the
saint's medal on the <a
href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">dashboard</a> of the Web,
beating out the Archangel Gabriel and St. Bernadine of Siena (the patron
saint of public relations) and St. Rita of Cascia (the patron saint of
impossible causes) in a proposal to the Vatican by an all-Italian <a
href="http://www.observatoriodigital.net/">internet organization</a>. (Go
figure why they like some Italian guy over a nice Irish boy like St.
Brendan...)</p>

<hr width="20%">

<p>No matter who ends up being the patron saint of your internet, if you
want me to write about some specific aspect of design, you gotta email me
and let me know.</p>

<em>
<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven
years old, and the state of the art was typing copy on Gestetner masters.
I've worked on every new technology since, but I still own an X-acto knife
and know how to use it.

<p> I've been a freelancer, and worked in advertising agencies, printing
companies, publishing houses, and marketing organizations in major
corporations. I also did a dozen years [1985-1997] at Apple Computer; my
first Macintosh was a Lisa with an astounding 1MB of memory, and my current
one is a Cube with a flat screen.

<p> I've had a website up since 1997, and created my latest one in 2004. I'm
still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.
