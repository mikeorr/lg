Hi list
Any pointers to what Indic &amp; CJKV has to do in case of the DocBook format?

I'm unclear what you're asking.  If you're asking:  "Are there any
commands 'Indic' and/or 'CJKV' which are docbook-specific", then the
answer is:  No.  OTOH, if you're asking about Indic fonts and/or
Chinese/Japanese/Korean/Vietnamese within the docbook format, then
you'll need to re-ask your question in much more detail.

I was actually writing a Google SoC proposal and a mentor shot at me
the topic of CJKV and Indic, initially I was at a loss to figure out
what it was. That is why I put forward this query to TAG, But after
some hits at Google Search I found what i was looking for.

<p>
So thanks anyways.
Any more suggestions are welcome
