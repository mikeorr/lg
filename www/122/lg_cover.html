Fake bio for Ubuntu

<p><em>
<b><a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a></b> is a 
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a> 
derivative distribution of Linux aimed at being fairly easy for someone new
to the Linux environment - the ordinary user - and having a somewhat
different and thereby hopefully faster version release process.  Their 
motto is "Linux for Human Beings", and Canonical Ltd. in the UK supports 
them professionally.
</em></p>

<p>This image was inspired by the IRC chat clients found in the Ubuntu
default installation (or perhaps their live CD) whose quitline proclaims
"set your system free with Ubuntu!" or something like that.  It led an IRC
friend to joke about herds of wildelaptops wandering free across the African
plains...

Fake bio for GNU

<img align="left" alt="[BIO]" src="misc/cover/gnu.png" class="bio">
<p><em>
Did you know that the word "wildebeest" refers to a gnu?  Or
that the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> project's 
<a href="http://www.sf.net">sourceforge</a> 
equivalent is named <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.savannah.html">Savannah</a>? 
I found the opportunity to wish everyone a visual "Happy GNU Year" too good 
to pass up.
</em></p>
<hr>

<p>The African herd that this image describes consists of an image from 
<a href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~sdb/">Dr. Steve Barrett</a>'s safari photos
(I hope he doesn't mind) and some pictures of various laptops.</p>

<p>Specifically, this shows an Asus 3300, a Toshiba Tecra 8200, and
clipart of a Powerbook and something more generic.  That's right,
kids;  Ubuntu has a PPC edition that runs quite nicely on Powerbooks.
I've found that the more generic a laptop, the better Linux's chances
seem to be... but don't hold your breath about any softmodems.  The Blue
Wildebeest is a common breed, but the IBM imagery I found didn't seem
to suit the angles I needed.</p>

<p>May your gnu year be <em>just a little more fun</em> than last year...</p>

Heather got started in computing before she quite got started learning
English.  By 8 she was a happy programmer, by 15 the system administrator
for the home... Dad had finally broken down and gotten one of those personal
computers, only to find it needed regular care and feeding like any other
pet.  Except it wasn't a Pet: it was one of those brands we find most 
everywhere today...  

<P> Heather is a hardware agnostic, but has spent more hours as a tech in
Windows related tech support than most people have spent with their computers.
(Got the pin, got the Jacket, got about a zillion T-shirts.)  When she
discovered Linux in 1993, it wasn't long before the home systems ran Linux
regardless of what was in use at work.

<P> By 1995 she was training others in using Linux - and in charge of all the 
"strange systems" at a (then) 90 million dollar company.  Moving onwards, it's
safe to say, Linux has been an excellent companion and breadwinner... She 
took over the HTML editing for "The Answer Guy" in issue 28, and has been 
slowly improving the preprocessing scripts she uses ever since.

<P> Here's an autobiographical filksong she wrote called
<A HREF="../issue67/misc/tag/filksong-programmers-daughter.txt">The Programmer's Daughter</A>.
