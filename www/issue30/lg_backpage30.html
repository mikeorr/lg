Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
This last month I've just been working, working, working -- no time for
fun. Riley is off on our annual motorcycle trip without me; he's exploring
Utah and Arizona, all our favorite parks. So at least one of us is having
fun. :-)
<P> 
Actually, I'm having fun too. Working on <I>LG</I> always seems more like
fun than work and the same is true for <I>Linux Journal</I>. I've also been
doing some exploring of areas surrounding Seattle with my father-in-law,
who just moved up to this area. We had a two hour ferry wait last Saturday 
that was frustrating yet comfortable because of the company. I think having 
nice in-laws is a definite plus in life. At any rate, we've seen some
beautiful scenery, including a trip to Snoqualmie Falls and one to the
Olympic Peninsula. 
<P> 
Have fun!
