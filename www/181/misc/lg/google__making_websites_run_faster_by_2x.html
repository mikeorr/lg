Rather interesting new bit from Google: on-the-fly page/site
optimization. Wonder what the magic trick is... I'll have to look into
it as soon as I have some Spare Time. [hollow laugh]

</pre>
Hi,
We just?launched a new open-source Apache module called mod_pagespeed that any
webmasters can use to quickly and automatically optimize their sites. (It's
like Page Speed, but makes the changes automatically.) It can reduce page load
times by up to 50% -- in other words, essentially speeding up websites by
roughly 2x. This is one of our more significant "speeding up the web"
contributions.?
</p>

<p>
Webmasters know that if it's not fast, it doesn't matter how pretty it is --
people won't use it. At Google, we're obsessed with speed--we measure it, pick
it apart, think about it constantly. It's even baked into our quarterly goals.
Mod_pagespeed comes on the heels of a bunch of other speed pushes we've already
told you about, from Google Instant to the Images redesign to SPDY to Fast Flip
to ultra-high-speed broadband... etc.
</p>

<p>
Let me know if you have any questions or want a deep dive briefing.
Regards,
Di

And here is the URL:

</p>

<p>
I must say, without giving initial test, it looks promising. But I
wonder, does it make server reply slower? I imagine the optimization
is done on the fly toward every HTML or dynamic page requested. Or
maybe it implements somekind of cache?

I would imagine so. The previous release was a Firefox extension, but
most of the individual parts were command-line tools to optimise
various image formats, and to strip HTML of non-necessities.
