Hi Rick,
</p>

<p>
although I do not agree on every single aspect of the article I still think 
its a great article - so thanks for writing it.
Especially your note concerning missing license information is quite valid I 
think.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to suggest another privacy-extension : Cookie Culler
<a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/82'>https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/82</a>
</p>

<p>
This extension automatically cleans all your (normal) cookies when you close 
the browser, except the ones you protect. So all those tracking cookies will 
be erased (and gone) soon enough <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
However there is no license information available on the page, but in the 
soure it says  Version: MPL 1.1
</p>


<p>
In the comments there is also another extension which presumably does quite 
the same - however I have not yet tried it myself.
<a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/11044'>https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/11044</a>
</p>

<pre>
/* <strong>   </strong> BEGIN LICENSE BLOCK <strong>   </strong>
 *   Version: MPL 1.1/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1
</pre>


<p>
And about BetterPrivacy:
<pre class='code'>
BetterPrivacy â€” but I would like to specifically disrecommend that solution, 
because BetterPrivacy is proprietary software for which source code is never 
even available for inspection.
</pre>

<p>
Are you sure about that?
I agree that is not licensed under any free license as the content/LICENSE 
file states
 "BetterPrivacy is freeware; Non-commercial use and distribution only!"
</p>

<p>
however the source IS available (as with all extensions) as they are written 
in plain javascript/xul  - just unzip the .xpi (and sometimes the jar within) 
and tadaa there's your source.
</p>

<p>
Or am I wrong about this?
</p>


<p>
Thanks,
Peter
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much, Peter.  I wrote it primarily because I just hadn't 
seen much coverage of those subjects, and especially about the hazards
of installing code from dubious locations.
</p>

<p>
[BetterPrivacy:]
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Are you sure about that?
</pre>

<p>
I was sure about the licence.  The source code auditability was just to
the extent of my present knowledge based on what I'd seen.
</p>


<pre>

&gt; written in plain javascript/xul  - just unzip the .xpi (and sometimes

</pre>
 
Thanks for pointing that out.  I'd been searching for information on how
one gets to the XUL sourcecode of distributed extensions, and whether
it's reduced to bytecode, or what.  Even the Mozilla.org pages on the
extension interface didn't really make that clear -- so I've now learned
something useful.
</p>

<p>
Of course, this merely means BetterPrivacy <em>could</em> be audited by third
parties.  The proprietary licensing has the incidental effect that few
will ever bother (as one lacks a meaningful right to fork, there's not
going to be a Debian package, etc.).  Anyway, I happen to like the more
modest design of Objectify, for whatever that's worth.

<p>
For me it was more interesting because of the privacy aspects, e.g. these 
strange feedreaders I never use, supercookies etc.
</p>

<p>
Especially as the EFF released a tool to test the 'uniqueness' of your 
browser.
<a href='http://panopticlick.eff.org/index.php'>http://panopticlick.eff.org/index.php</a>
</p>

<p>
And about better privacy:
My alternative solution is a simple script in
/etc/cron.daily
with the content:
<pre>
	#!/bin/sh
	rm -rfv /home/user/.macromedia 
</pre>

<p>
<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Should fix atleast some issues <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
However I'm not yet sure howto clean the DOM localStorage and DOM 
sessionStorage.
</p>

<p>
Is there a way to inspect the contents of the DOM storage?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Peter

<p>
Yes, that's a pretty good cross-check, about what your browser reveals
to server-end software.
</p>

<p>
On the earlier point, I should also mention that I inferred lack of
inspection access to BetterPrivacy source code in part from the fact
that the source code page,
<a href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/versions/license/74267'>https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/versions/license/74267</a>, has no
link for source code!  (It has only the statement "BetterPrivacy is
freeware; Non-commercial use and distribution only!")  Again, thank you
for pointing out that XPIs, themselves, are just zipped XUL source (+
metadata).

That certainly covers it, but you might find it over time to be too
sweeping.  First, only .sol files seem of concern.  Also, you may find
eventually that some have benign functions you'd rather have persist,
such as (oh, and I know I'm reaching, a bit) your per-user settings for
Flash-based games.
</p>

<p>
It may seem unlikely, but I'm just trying not to close off capabilities
I might actually want to use, some time.  So, my personal inclination
would be, as I said, to delete particular .sol files inside ~.macromedia
by name, via a weekly cronjob.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; However I'm not yet sure howto clean the DOM localStorage and DOM 
&gt; sessionStorage.
</pre>

<p>
This actually may be an area where Adobe's online documentation and
Flash-based "Flash Settings Manager" may be useful.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Is there a way to inspect the contents of the DOM storage?
</pre>

<p>
Well, it's just SQLite files, so SQLite itself might be useful.  I
haven't tried yet, so I really don't have much information (and not a
lot has yet been written).
