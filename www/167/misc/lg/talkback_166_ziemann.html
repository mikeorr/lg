This article reminds me to the day I made my first crude webmail using
perl CGI. Not too good, but also not so bad considering the fact "It
Just Works" and I made it using Perl while most of my friends would
prefer using PHP to do such thing <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Bash scripting for CGI....ouch that's just great! and old sk00lz too!

I introduce my shell scripting students to CGI pretty regularly. It's a
way for them to write a graphical app that runs on almost *every single
OS* (via browser, obviously) by using very simple tools - an incredible
"force multiplier". It also gets people out of thinking that shell
scripting is a trivial hack, or doesn't have much power.

Can't agree more than that! I think that also fits with versatility of
most Linux/Unix tools I can say that bash is "one of the oldest swiss
army knife".
</p>

<p>
bash does very well (since it's the nature of it) as a shell and
scripting language, but with imagination it can also serve as other
things too. let's see if somebody in TAG runs bash as web server in
one of his/her machines <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

The web server at www.franjam.org.uk (80.177.18.41) is bash shell script 
run out of inetd, which I cra^Hufted myself. It doesn't do much, mainly 
does HTTP redirects to where some pages are. The http "Server:" name is 
"MickeyMouse0.1" <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

There's are other private stuff on there too. I wrote it to try and learn a

<p>
In case it's not obvious, the inetd superserver is extremely useful for
these sorts of tricks, <em>because</em> it can open network sockets, which is 
the difficult part.  (That's why "Web servers" in shell script, awk, 
or sed tend to lean on inetd -- though GNU awk has extensions that 
let you do without it.)

<p>
Too true. I've used inetd and perl/Tcl/shell scripts for prototyping 
network services for ages. Many never left the prototype stage <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">. Factor 
in the use of the tcpd access control program and you very get simple added 
security.

I'm not 100% sure, but I don't believe that 'charset=ASCII' is a valid
charset string (although 'charset="us-ascii"' is.) You should also send
a DTD spec, i.e.

If you go to the W3C site and look up Content-type headers, you'll learn
more about it than you ever wanted to. It's not very complex, actually:
all that's actually required is
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
Content-type: text/html\n\n
</pre>

<p>
(the two "\n"s, or "\n\r"s at the end are critically important!) - but
there's more stuff you can do to inform the browser of your server's
HTTP protocol level, the charset you're using, etc.

I searched addons.mozilla.org - a bit safer - and installed, thanks for the

<p>
actually just to make clear, the double "\n"s, or "\n\r"s are only needed 
after the last http header. In Ben's example, I think he means that it is 
the <em>only</em> header, and hence the last one. Like smtp (email), http says 
there must be an empty line between the headers and the content.

I did say that was the required minimum. You're right about larger
headers, however: any other header data, which can be very large indeed
(think "Content-type: multipart/form-data", and "megabyte-sized
attachments") must come before the required 'blank line'.

It <em>was</em> a great read.

Remember, folks, one of the pleasures of being a copyeditor or technical

that.  (Anyway, thanks indeed to Volker Ziemann.)

Looks like Mr Ziemann at least gets 3 votes (including from me) to be
considered as "a good piece of article" <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
