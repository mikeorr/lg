Yeah, that kind of thing tends to give you a bit of armor, or at least a
sense of amusement (or possibly boredom, after a while) when some
slavering net.freakjob starts threatening and attacking you. I've also
recently learned - and I'm not sure that the lesson has quite sunk in,
so at some point, the Universe will teach it to me <strong>harder</strong> - to set a
clock on the idiots. They can continue their blithering as long as I
find it amusing; after that point, they get told "your nickel has run
out. Behave, or get shut off - NOW."

I am tending to find that as I get older my tolerance for people
wasting my time, or causing me grief and upset, is diminishing
rapidly.

I think that by the time I retire I will be completely cankerous.

Yikes! I hope you manage to get a tan in the midst of all that

I'd be happy if I could just touch my toes again. Mind you, I'd also
be happy if I could see them whilst standing again. I have to lean so
far forward now that I'd fall over if I didn't hold on to something
;-)

Nope; I missed the early indoctrination. You have to remember: I'm a
dam' furriner, and didn't start learning English until my teen years.
That's what makes me so dangerous: I don't even filter the fnords. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
