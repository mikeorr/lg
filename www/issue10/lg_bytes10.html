<P> 
From: Paul Bingman <A HREF="mailto:paul@edgewood.portland.or.us">
paul@edgewood.portland.or.us</A><BR> 
<P> 
As you are no doubt aware, some (insert your favorite deragatory epithet)
has trademarked the name &quot;Linux&quot; is now out trying to collect from
everyone they can.
<P> 
An intellectual property attorney friend of mine, G. Gervaise Davis III,
is offering to get this trademark killed pro bono, if we can cover the
expenses.  His opinion, not having seen the original papers filed for the
trademark, is that the original has absolutely no legal standing, and will
probably be killed by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office as soon as we
make the proper legal moves.
<P> 
Please forward this email to anyone/everyone.  I'm especially interested
in hearing from anyone who has received a collection letter, and also from
Linus or someone else who can direct us to where the trademark should
rightfully go.  Also, this effort should be coordinated nationally or
globally.

<P>
September 19, 1996 <BR> 
Mark Bolzern, President WGS <BR> 
Member Board of Directors, Linux International <BR> 
<P> 
With regard to the attack made on WGS, as well as the Greater Linux Community
by William R. Della Croche claiming that he owns the Linux Trademark... 
There is no way this is true. We have retained an attorney and will be making 
a public announcement soon that benefits the entire Linux community.
Thousands are aware of this situation, and have offered to help. The best 
help you could give us, is to see if there is something we offer in our Linux 
Shopping mall that you would like to own, and if so buy it. We add new products
almost daily. If you don't see what you want, ask, or refer a friend to us.  
Thank you!

Purpose:
To fill in an existing gap in the Linux world and provide users with
various services/data that are not otherwise available online.  To 
provide a clearing house for these same services.
<P> 
Discussion:
The L.U.S.T. (surprised nobody thought of the name earlier!) is not
intended to be involved with programming, patching, updating, or such.
It's to support the everyday, run-of-the-mill user with various support
not offered elsewhere in the Linux world with data or services such as
the Workman Database Project described below.

<P> 
Pablo Kiryluk of GM Communications, InterSoft's RRPP, writes:
<P> 
Linus Torvalds, the Finish guru creator of the operating system  "Linux" 
landed  in  Buenos Aires, Argentina, to the expectation of many. Invited 
by InterSoft, the multinational software producer, Mr. Torvalds lectured 
to a wide range  of  public  about  the  "Software  Free"  concept,  its 
relation with Internet and Linux' characteristics.
<P> 
The  range of ideas spread by Linus Torvalds in Argentina where laid out 
in terms of "knowledge sharing" and "composing from different creators". 
"Company's  tendencies  will  integrate parts of free software forming a 
system  to curb the commercial industry of software" --substantiated Mr. 
Torvalds. Also, the concept of "the idea that technology were  humanity' 
patrimony,  based  on  the  free distribution of software and its source 
codes" was expressed in several occasions.
<P> 
Also, Torvalds decided also to introduce "Scriptum", the first adaptable 
editor to different Linux' environments, created by InterSoft. Scriptum 
was created in Argentina and developed as a powerful tool capable to run 
of different platforms and offer several features. With Scriptum, almost 
the  entire working environment can be configured, totally integrated to 
RCS/SCCS  tools  and  UNIX  (grepp,  diff, etc.) and powerful navigation 
commands to find sources, data and documents.

<H3><IMG ALT=" "   SRC="../gx/bolt.gif">More Linus News</H3>
<P> 
The San Jose Mercury News published an interview with Linus Torvalds on
September 8, 1996 in which Linus is quoted as saying
<blockquote> <I> 
Microsoft operating systems are bad, and their morals are even worse. But
they make some good applications.
</I> </blockquote>

<H3><IMG ALT=" "   SRC="../gx/bolt.gif">Soft Braille for Linux: BRLTTY 1.0.1</H3>
<P> 
The official release of BRLTTY, a software system
to allow access to the console of a Unix system for users of soft Braille
displays, has been announced.
<P> 
BRLTTY currently runs under Linux (kernel version 1.1.92 or later) on a PC
or DEC Alpha.
<P> 
The package has been uploaded to sunsite.unc.edu in the directory
/pub/Linux/Incoming.  It is expected to move to /pub/Linux/system/Access at
some later date (please note the move from /pub/Linux/utils/console).
<P> 
FEATURES
<ul>
<li>Full implementation of the standard screen review facilities.
<li>A wide range of additional optional features, including blinking 
     cursor and capital letters, screen freezing for leisurely review,
     attribute display to locate highlighted text, hypertext links, etc.
<li>`Intelligent' cursor routing.  This allows easy movement of the cursor
     in text editors etc. without moving the hands from the Braille 
     display.
<li>A cut & paste function.  This is particularly useful for copying long
     filenames, complicated commands etc.
<li>An on-line help facility.
<li>Support for multiple Braille codes.
<li>Modular design allows relatively easy addition of drivers for other
     Braille displays, or even (hopefully) porting to other Unix-like
     platforms.
</ul>

<A HREF="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/hurd-0.1.tar.gz">/pub/gnu/hurd-0.1.tar.gz</A> (about 1.2 MB compressed). There is also a

<P> 
The GNU Hurd, plus Mach, is a kernel, not an operating system.  The
GNU operating system, like the Unix operating system, consists of many
components, including kernel, libraries, compilers, assembler, shell,
parser generators, utilities, window system, editors, text formatters,
and so on.
<P> 
Most GNU software is packed using the GNU `gzip' compression program.
Source code is available on most sites distributing GNU software.
<P>
