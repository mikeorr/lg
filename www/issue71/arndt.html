1 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P>
Giving everything a GUI has become a popular trend in the Linux community.
This implies that more and more program authors tend to use a GUI-based 
configuration dialog.

<P>
However, you lose an important thing when GUIs are used for everything:
documentation.  People who can point-and-click
are often the one who think: ```Why should I read the programs
documentation? I simply point-and-click--and it works.''

<P>
But it would be better to encourage people to read documentation.
In fact, the better the documentation, the simpler it is to use 
a program. Take the Apache web server for example, it comes 
with heavy documentation.  As a result, anybody who can understand a little
English is able to use Apache and configure it--without using a
point-and-click interface.

<P>
This article tries to encourage programmers to document their projects,
as well as to provide ideas and tips on doing so.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
2 Why should I write documentation?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Lots of reasons! More documentation means easier usage. More documentation
means better add-on modules. More documentation means happier users.
As soon as a user gets stuck trying to get a program feature to work, he
or she starts to read that program's documentation. Imagine, therefore, 
creating well-structured and well-written documentation that will make it
easy for the user to get that feature to work.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
3 What aspects of my project/program should I document?</A>
</H2>

<P>
In general the following aspects of a program or project should be
documented:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Basic usage is mostly covered in a man page.
</LI>
<LI>More advanced usage can be achieved by listing ALL configuration
options in the documentation and giving examples on how to use them
(take the very good Apache documentation for example).
</LI>
<LI>Source code, of course, because somebody may want to add features
to the program.
</LI>
<LI>Examples of usage to supply a working basic configuration file
and document it heavily.
</LI>
<LI>Installation of the program, because not all programs work with <B>./configure
&amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</B>.
</LI>
<LI>User interface, especially if it is not a common point-and-click
one.
</LI>
</OL>
This list can be extended further. But in general a well-documented
program will cover at least these, and it will do so in a readable
fashion.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00050000000000000000">
4 How do I write documentation?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Use your favourite text editor, as the formats I propose here can all
be written using a text editor.

<P>
Style is worth mentioning as well. Write your documentation in an
easy-to-read style. Do not try to use poetry.

<P>
The preferred language for documentation is plain English, as almost
anyone who uses a computer is able to understand it. You can always
add documentation in your native language as well. But keep in mind
that not everyone speaks German or Russian. At least include English
documentation for the most basic parts of your project. Someone who
cannot understand the simplest parts of the documentation will not read
it, and in many cases he will not use that program.

<P>
The rest is up to you. Always keep in mind that writing the documentation
is the ugliest part of developing.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
5 What formats should I use for my documentation?</A>
</H2>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00061000000000000000">
5.1 File formats suitable for documentation</A>
</H3>

<P>
Use a standard one, nobody likes proprietary file formats. This 
effectively kills MS Word, StarOffice or anything like that for documentational
purposes.

<P>
The most simple format is plain text. It can be read everywhere, and
everyone can use his or her favourite pager or editor.

<P>
If you want your documentation to be printable, L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X is a good
choice. It is relatively easy to use, at least for writing a documentation
file. Advantages of using L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X are the system-independent
output format and a stylish formatted document. You can even export
it to HTML.

<P>
The most preferred choice nowadays is HTML. It is hypertext, there
are readers for all platforms available, and it can be distributed
on the project's homepage for on-line reading.

<P>
You can also use an SGML- or XML-based format such as DocBook or 
LinuxDoc/SGML.  These formats provide the most flexibility for converting
to many other output formats (including formats which haven't been invented
yet), or parsing as structured text (for automated text-processing tools),
but require a learning curve similar to
L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00062000000000000000">
5.2 Source code documentation</A>
</H3>

<P>
Source code can simply be documented by heavy use of comments and
suitable variable names. API descriptions in an external file is important,
especially if you're writing a library or something else that can
be extended.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
6 Documentation formatting with HTML</A>
</H2>

<P>
Always use the most common subset of HTML. Do not use frames or Javascript
in documentation. Simply use &lt;H1&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; to &lt;H6&gt;&lt;/H6&gt; for sections and
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt; for paragraphs. Read your favourite HTML-Howto for more detail.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00080000000000000000">
7 Use LyX</A>
</H2>

<P>
This my personal tip for writing program documentation. It features
what-you-see-is-what-you-mean input and result formatting in L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X,
as well as export to ASCII and HTML. Think of it as some sort of GUI frontend
for L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X. Always keep in mind that LyX is not a WYSIWYG
text processor</B>.

<P>
LyX comes with most Linux distributions, with its own
documentation file. Give it a try--it's easy to use and the results
are stunning.

<P>
The export features of LyX make it well-suited for our purpose.
You can create a .dvi file of your documentation that can be printed
on almost all Linux boxes configured for printing. So even
the distribution of a printable manual is easy.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00090000000000000000">
8 What about PDF?</A>
</H2>

<P>
PDF is an extended version of Postscript. Its main disadvantage for
documentation is it requires a graphic display or a printer to
be viewed properly.  

<P>
PDF is also less reliable on Linux.  HTML files and man pages "just
work".  L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X files work if you
install the software correctly. But there are incompatibilities between
the various PDF-authoring tools and viewers, and you may end up
distributing a document that somebody can't open or that has some of the
text showing up blank in various viewers.

<P>
PDF files are also huge, especially if you include pictures and tables. 
Displaying PDF files is slow compared to HTML, DVI or plain
text. You may use it--but I do not recommend PDF for project documentation.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION000100000000000000000">
9 Conclusion</A>
</H2>

<P>
Writing documentation can be fun if you use the right tools. Always
remember that the documentation should be written so that anyone
can read it.

<P>
Now, go do it--good documentation is worth the effort.
