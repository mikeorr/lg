I have an hp 1200 and everytime I try to scan, the computer does not recognize the scanner within the printer.  I have installed everything on the hp disk, but the computer doesn't see it.  I can print just fine, but no scans.  Help
</p>

The SANE project shows the Photosmart 1200 as unsupported. Do HP provide linux 
drivers for it?

Andrea hasn't mentioned, but I suspect that she's not talking about
using this printer with Linux; as far as I'm aware, HP doesn't provide
any Linux-specific CDs from which you can "install everything". In fact,
the only useful thing I found on their CD that came with my HP PSC1315
printer/scanner was the PPD file; other than that, everything there was
Wind0ws-specific.
</p>

<p>
Andrea, please feel free to tell me if I've misunderstood your message;
other than that, there's not a whole lot of help we can provide here,
since this forum is specific to Linux, not Wind0ws. If you <em>are</em> using
Linux, do let us know - and give us some details on what you've tried so
far (in fact, please see "Asking Questions of The Answer Gang" at
'<a href="../../../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a>', which has a good
step-by-step walkthrough of basic troubleshooting); otherwise, your best
bet is to call HP tech support. In my experience, they have a fairly
decent tech support staff, something that I can't say for many other
companies in the computer business today.
