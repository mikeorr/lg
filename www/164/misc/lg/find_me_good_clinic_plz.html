Jimmy!  Good to see you on here.  We have some work to do, and some
organising, to make LG an ongoing concern rather than a big burden 
that lands fully on Ben's shoulders.  I'll be forwarding to this 
mailing list the recent announcement of that need.
</p>

<p>
I've already personally shouldered part of the burden, but we need 
more people to take on parts of the ongoing tasks, and they need
to be people who're serious about it.  
</p>

<p>
Who's with me?

<p>
I can only speculate that it might have something to do with Canada 
being less infested by the spirit of the War on Some Drugs that still
remains underway south of its border -- and also is famously a source
of much cheaper supplies of common pharmaceuticals.
</p>

<p>
On the first point:  Canadian chemists ("pharmacies", "drug stores")
make available actually effective analgesics without prescription, e.g.,
cough syrup with codeine, acetaminophen with codeine.  Even the milder
opiates are strictly controlled at USA retailers.  Hydrocodone might 
also available in that way, though I really don't know for sure.
</p>

<p>
However, I believe it's really the availability of cheaper prescription
medicines from licensed Internet pharmacy outfits that's truly driving
the Canadian business, as US (and some other countries') customers
slowly get wind of the fact that they're paying artifically elevated
prices at home.  
</p>



<p>
Recent history, Chez Moen:
</p>

<p>
My Internet server, linuxmafia.com AKA lists.linuxgazette.net, suffered
a catastrophic hardware failure in mid-April.  There was a very powerful
wind storm here in the San Francisco Bay Area.  During the middle of
that, an AC (mains) power spike hit my server, burning out the
motherboard, all but one stick of RAM, the power supply unit, and 
all hard drives.  I spent a few hours (upon getting home from work) 
attempting to get to the data, eventually gave up, and deployed a 
spare machine as the new linuxmafia.com, later that evening.  I 
then spent <em>some</em> time resurrecting (most) services.
</p>

<p>
I also spent a couple of days fetching the most recent offsite data
backup back across the Internet, so that I could update the older
snapshot of that data on the (now-promoted) spare machine.  To my
distress, I found that that data, sent up to a Solaris "slice" virtual
host in a data centre via rsync over ssh, was <em>not</em> stored with the
needed owner/group metadata (probably an inevitable consequence of 
not being about to conduct the rsync transfer as root) -- necessitating
a lot of painful work correcting ownership.
</p>

<p>
By an unfortunate coincidence, hard on the heels of the server downtime
came unavoidable personal downtime.  Owing to a life-threatening,
serious illness that I was fortunate to have diagnosed in December 2008,
in time to get effective curative treatment, I went into hospital on 
Thursday, April 30th for major surgery -- followed by a week as an
inpatient, before they would even let me out, at all.  I won't be
explicit in this space about the nature of the issue, but suffice it to
say that I've had a very narrow escape from something that would
otherwise have killed me very painfully, a few years from now.  
The surgery was almost 100% successful in removing the threat, though I
am going to need followup radiation therapy as a "mopping up" measure.
</p>

<p>
The after-effects of the surgery, meanwhile, left me a bit tired and 
(again, skipping some details) prone to being unable to sleep an entire
night without having to get up numerous times -- and thus, short on
sleep during the day, most days.  The part of my anatomy that had to
have the necessary excison <em>is</em>, fortunately, healing, and I'm doing a
great deal better all the time -- while also being enormously happy to
be alive and relatively well.
</p>

<p>
Because of the sleep-deficit and accumulated fatigue, and other things
I've needed to attend to, I've admittedly been a little slow to fix the
remaining glitches in my replacement Internet server software -- which
is why I didn't take the needed time and concentrated effort to find and
scotch the broken connection between Mailman and Exim (my MTA) until
today.
</p>

<p>
By the way:  My wife Deirdre was far more nervous than I was, about my
surgery and subsequent recovery.   To make her laugh, a week or so
before my operation, I wrote the following example of a likeable but
difficult form of light verse called "double dactyl":
</p>

<p>
Higgledy-piggledy,
Cytopathology
Showed up a gland that had
Thrown me some curves.
</p>

<p>
Carcinocentrical
Medical lit'rature
Sends methods to yank flesh
That gets on my nerves.

I've been following the discussion on the Yahoo group, hit reply a few
times, and all I could come up with was: ' ... '
</p>

<p>
I've got a long list of projects and commitments, so my best solution
for right now is to ask my GSoC student to write an article (he
agreed, enthusiastically), that I'll proofread. I'm kicking myself
that I didn't think to ask him earlier - he's a never-sleeping coding
machine with the enthusiasm of a puppy in a hotdog factory.

Aw hey! I resemble that remark: 5.9m lines of XML changed in 17
months, according to ohloh.net's laughable metrics, which obviously
seem to think that svn move and restore operations count as an edit (I
must be the only person at my project to have read the SVN manual -
either that, or they leave me to do the fixups as a punishment,
because I keep evangelising git).

Yes, it's because Rick commented a spam email that was sent to TAG, and
in his comment he asked "Who's with me?" (meaning who is with the team
that wants to do something for the LG).
