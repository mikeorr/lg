<p>
Anyone know of a way to have multiple ssh authorized_keys files for  
host key authentication for different users. I am familiar with the  
usual practice of echoing all of the users keys into authorized_keys  
file but I am thinking in terms of if I have to revoke keys and  
disable user access. What I would like to do is have a setup similar  
to apache in that it can have files included in the conf directory. So  
this way I have a user name or identifying indicator of whose key is  
whose so I can revoke access as the necessity arises.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for all of your help.

If that's the only thing you're missing, that seems like it would be a
simple fix:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
sed -i '/ user@host$/d' ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

<p>
The space and the '$' on the end simply ensure that it's that specific
user that gets axed.

I don't know of any method that's internal to SSH, but you could
certainly set up an external resource that pairs the added keys with any
identifying info you want, then allows you to manipulate them by that
info. Conversely, you could use a config file - e.g., something similar
to the Apache "include" format - that you would "compile" with some sort
of a script to produce an ~/.ssh/authorized_keys instead of editing it
directly.
</p>

<p>
Either approach would take a little coding, but - that's left as an
exercise for the individual student. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

As far as I can make out from "man sshd_config" this is not an
option.

<p>
Note that the general entry for the authorized keys file looks like:
<pre>
	options type key comment
 
The options are optional(!).
The type is ssh-rsa or ssh-dsa (usually).
The key is, well, the public-key.
The comment is entirely up to you.
</pre>

<p>
What I would do is give a comment which would tag the key. So you
could put some unique identifier for the user as a comment. Then to
revoke a key you only need to do:
<pre>
	grep -v 'unique-id' .ssh/authorized_keys &gt; .ssh/authorized_keys.new
	mv .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys.old
	mv .ssh/authorized_keys.new .ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

<p>

And he is right (as usual!).

So that should be:
</p>

<pre>
 	grep -v ' unique-id$' .ssh/authorized_keys &gt; .ssh/authorized_keys.new
</pre>

<p>
so that you only find the unique-id at the end of the line (just in
case the unique-id was not unique enough not to appear inside the
earlier fields!).

<p>
The nice part of that 'sed -i' command is that it actually modifies the 
file 'in-place' - there's no need to redirect or move anything.

Thank  you everyone for your help. I'm currently writing two version  
one in C and another in Perl I will share them both when I get them  
done.
