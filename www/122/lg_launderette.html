</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for the XTeddy fan mail. It's always nice
to hear from people who like him. I don't get more
than a few messages per year about him these days,
but it's nice to see that he's still out there.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The real life XTeddy is a present from my wife,
she got it for me as a stress relief in 1994
when I was a PhD student, and I must say it
still works. He still sits on my desk, or
rather on a shelf just above my desk, in clear
view and ready to comfort me when things get
rough. (Although his mere presence actually
seems to stop things from getting too rough.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Like most teddy bears, he has a real life name,
and it happen to be "Lufs", which is a cutesy
Swedish bear name whose point gets more or less lost
in translation, but I'll try anyway:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
The name "Lufs" means nothing in particular, but the
kind of slow trotting and wobbling walk that real live
bears tend to do when they are not in any hurry is
referred to as "lufsa" (a verb) in Swedish, and when
we were kids, both my wife and I had read a story
by the Swedish author G=F6sta Knutsson about a little
bear cub named "Nalle Lufs", ("Nalle" is an old Swedish
word for "bear", often used as a synonym for "teddy bear".)
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I can't remember whether it was me of my wife who
named him. It kind of grew on him more than being
a planned naming. I'm not even sure if we were
consciously aware of that childhood story at the
time, but we both recalled reading it when we saw
it a few years ago.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The XTeddy program was my first and so far only attempt
at writing a native program for X Windows. It makes very
simple use of the Shape extension and a pixmap background,
and the original version was about one page of code.
It has since been extended with better image loading
functions, but the basic window functionality is still
just a shaped window with a background pixmap, and a
simple, low level mouse event handler to move it around.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It was also a counterstatement to "xeyes", the only
other shaped window program that was around in 1994.
I thought it was a bad and ugly demo for a good extension.
Xeyes is kind of cute the first time you try it, but
it is kind of intrusive (someone or something is watching
your every move with the mouse) and therefore has very
little staying power with most users.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
XTeddy is rather the opposite to xeyes: Nonintrusive,
motionless unless you pick him up, doesn't really care
what you are doing and watches <EM>you</EM>, not your work or
lack thereof, in patient silence. He's basically useless,
but cute, and always available.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
That was probably more background information than
you ever wanted, but you did ask for it.

I've been running behind on everything - Ulysses is in the final stages
of the repairs, and we're spending all our time sanding, grinding, and
painting (and learning a hell of a lot, particularly about that last;
there's a whole body of science behind it, particularly when you ask as
much of it as we do.) Anyway - happy holidays to everyone, whichever
version you celebrate; may your upcoming year be filled with love, joy,
and happiness!

No, well, kind of... In a bar, you'd say 'prosz&#281; &lt;whatever&gt;'. It's
probably better for xteddy to not understand Polish, because of the

Various 10646 fonts suck in arbitrary ways; you're probably missing the
glyphs for Polish in whatever you're using. All the stuff in Jimmy's
email displayed fine for me in Mutt. Here are my relevant bits:

most mail on shell on a <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> box, using mutt displayed on various
terminals on FC3 and Mac OS X. Getting the correct invocations to
make this all work hasn't been near the top of the list, but this
may be the year...

You're in luck: I still have the wrapper script I used to use to launch
Mutt to read my Russian mail, which contains the previous invocations
(commented out) to do various language-related tweaking. I still use it,
since I like saving attachments to <TT>/tmp</TT> by default and prefer opening
Mutt in "mailbox" view ('-y').

now, using the above font and $LANG

produces a very satisfying result.

'gnu-unifont' sucks when you try to display anything with line-drawing

How... nostalgic.  That seems to have been an instance of an actual
confused AOL user, writing manually from AOL, rather than a spam
forgery or malware mail pretending to be from AOL.  (All of the

I always consider myself a winner by knockout whenever someone distorts
my point to something ridiculous and then argues against the ridiculous
thing. That seems like an acknowledgement that my real point is unassailable.
Why else would someone need to invent a whole new point to argue against?

My favourite Polish word is 'kobietka', the diminutive of the word for

I <EM>know</EM> there's a Polish equivalent, but I can't find it. The only

oddly enough -
since I would have expected two closely-related Slavic languages to
share a similar concept - I can't think of a parallel to 'kobietka'.
There's "suchka" ("little bitch", a fond diminutive sorta-insult), but
that's not the same thing.

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  For those of us that use
Elinks as their browser, then here's something similar, using "Smart
Prefixes".  Essentially:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Options Manager -&gt; Protocols -&gt; URI rewriting -&gt; Smart Prefixes
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... from there, one can "Add" a new prefix -- I called mine 'lg'.  When
that's done, scroll down to it, and "Edit" it, adding the following to
it:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>http://www.google.com/search?q=%s&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;domains=linuxgazette.net&amp;si+tesearch=linuxgazette.net
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... the "%s" variable above expands to whatever search term was entered
in.  Then click on "Save", and voila.  Now one can search LG, by either
pressing 'g' or 't', and typing:

Hi all,
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
A lot of you seem to be well up on foreign languages.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I need to find out how to "write"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Lisa, I love you."  In Japanese.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I think I'm ok with the Lisa part, needs to be written in katakana as
Risa.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Once again Any help greatly appreciated.

Well...Pete, why do you want to write this in Japanese? I can help you
say this in Mandarin, but the Japanese just don't <EM>say</EM> this. It sounds
horribly stilted and overblown, even though there is a literal
translation. Even the more commonly used declaration sounds well, kinda
dorky.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So with those caveats,
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Lisa, anata aishiteru" is probably as good as it's going to get. (Lisa,
you(familiar) loving) (If you add in the "I" , it sounds like the emphasis
is on <EM>I</EM> love you, rather than "you are loved by me".)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Suki da yo" is what a guy tells his girl, but IMHO it has connotations of
"yeah yeah, I'll <EM>TELL</EM> you I like you because you <EM>asked</EM>, but it should
be obvious")

Um... OK, when you were in Ireland, you must have heard the phrase,
"sure why not", or "sure we may as well" (where 'sure' is pronounced
'sher' and not emphasised)... it'd sound like that.

I don't remember that but I've heard "sure" alone in Scotland (and in
the movie <em>  Local Hero )</em> .  Quiet and monotone.  I'm used to a strong
"sure"  meaning "I really like the idea",

a short but still forceful
sure being concessionary ("OK, that's fine"), and a long up-down-flat
"suurrrre" being ironic ("Sure you're going to the mall" [but I don't
believe it]).  A quiet, flat "sure" to me sounds very concessionary,
as in "I don't want to do it but I'll go along with your wishes."  I
had to tell myself, "That's not what they mean," and trust the words
rather than the intonation.

Um... I'm not sure (sure sure, not sure sure 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">, but I think the
Scottish use it the same way as we do. It doesn't really mean anything,
it's kind of an introduction to a sentence -- in fact, most of the time
it means you're <EM>unsure</EM>. Most Irish-type uses could be replaced with
"well" (or even "uh..."): "sure, you can take a later train if you miss
this one".

That's a different context.  I'm talking about a one-word response to
a proposal or a yes/no question.  In <em>  Local Hero ,</em>  when the Texas oil
negotiator gets off the plane in Aberdeen and meets his assistant
Olson, he asks about logistics like "Do you have a car?"  Olson
replies, "Sure."  The negotiator is surprised that Olson just says it
like a boring fact ("Apples grow on trees") rather than anticipating
that the question imples, "Let's go."  So half-exasperatedly he says,
"Well, let's go then."  Probably Olson did not mean it that way, but
that's how it sounds to yankee ears, extremely detached, like the
speaker really doesn't care or something.  It's hard to describe
because we just don't say "sure" that way, so we interpret it like
other phrases that <EM>are</EM> said that way.

What struck me about Ireland was how so many accents sounded
indistinguishable from American.  Only if you listen hard could you
hear faint traces of "foreign" intonation.  At least a quarter of the
people I met were like that, if not a third.

Partly it's because there's a Hiberno-English tendency to speak short
sentences as if they were single words: "bulnfrish" or "blinfrit" are
two renderings I've heard of "bullin' for it"[1] (i.e., horny).

I would suspect that the easiest route would be to head over to Ireland,
get out in the countryside a bit, stop in pub and ask the first person
you see if they'd like you to buy them a pint. Virtually any answer you
get there should be fairly equivalent to "Yes!".

especially as the only Irish word so far is: "nabocklish: don't

Plus, it has to be taken into account that linguists are at the mercy
of the sense of humour of the person they are questioning; especially
difficult on the internet, where you can't see if they're having
difficulty keeping a straight face (one of the Philipinos at work told
me that "putang ina mo" means "hello", for example. If you're <EM>really</EM>

So, Kat, can you confirm that "ariga-meiwaku" means "an act someone does
for you that you didn't want to have them do and tried to avoid having
them do, but they went ahead anyway, determined to do you a favour, and
then things went wrong and caused you a lot of trouble, yet in the end
social conventions required you to express gratitude", because I can
think of several times where that would have summed things up

Other than the fact that I know this word as "arigato meiwaku", yes,
that's about the gist of it. "meiwaku" means bother/annoyance/imposition.

<blockQuote>
Of course the etymology of "thank you" in Japanese is peculiarly Japanese
in concept as well. Quoting from someone quoting the sci.lang.japan faq:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
The word derivations are different too. Arigatou is related to
arigatai .kind, welcome. and arigatagaru .be thankful., which conveys a
grateful feeling for something that was done in favor of the one using the
word. The first kanji is aru (. Unicode 6709) .exist, happen. and the
second one, gatou &lt; katai (. Unicode 978F) means .hard, difficult..

My Russian roommate Was Valeriy Pronin (vah-LEHR-ee PRO-neen) but the
border guards anglicized it to Valerie Pronine.  So not only was he
stuck with a girl's name but people pronounced the last name
"pro-nine".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Then he married an Irish-American girl and changed his name to Michael
Sean Kennedy.  That really throws people.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I went to Russia and his family met me at the airport.  I was
expecting the Pronins but found the Dmitrochenkos.  Turns out his
nickname was his given name.    He and several buddies had changed
their name to Valeri Pronin after a buddy by that name died.  I was
irritated that he hadn't told me his family's name was different than
his, because if his brother hadn't recognized me at the airport I'd be
looking around for Pronins and never have found them.  Which was scary
because it was my first time abroad and Russia is not a very familiar
place.  ("What if I get to my hostel at midnight and it's closed?")

Another friend was named Chris Norman.  I went to visit his cousin in
Russia.  Since it was his cousin I expected a different name.  They
met me at a metro station in Moscow so
it was easy to find them.  (I still don't like taking Russian suburban
trains alone.  So easy to take the wrong train, and good luck
recognizing the station when they announce it.)  Later in St Pete I
saw posters for Chris Norman, a musician, so I don't know if he did
something funny with his name too.

I should state rather strongly at this moment that I think you should find

can try googling "kanji tattoo" to see what most native speakers think of
the currently trendy usage of kanji.

The interdependencies of language and mind are always fascinating,
as I started to realise when I learned French and realised that there
were particular modes of thinking that come naturally when "thinking in

examples, and, unfortunately, failing.)

Languages unfortunately are tied to cultures, and don't do well as simple
word substitutions.

I don't suppose you recall the Russian humor gazette, "Krokodil", or
"Krokodil Gena" (a cartoon croc who later featured as the butt of many
jokes; most of these were, unusually for Russian jokes, characterized by
a certain innocent sort of humor.) For some reason, Russians seem to
associate crocs with humor.

I remember one political cartoon.  One side of a chessboard was all
lined up orderly; the other side was squabbling.  One from the unruly
side goes up to the other and says, "U vas yeschyo korol' s korolevoy?
A u nas uzhe yest' parliament."  (You still have a king and queen?
We have a parliament.)

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Not "Luke" because "luko" means skylight, so "luke" means skylight-ly.
"luk" alone would be a preposition or interjection, but since there's
no such word it's safe for a foreign name.  The accusative would be
"Luk'on", the standard way to add a suffix to a non-Esperantized name.

Oops, "cxaro" (chariot) looks like a nounization of "cxar"
(for/because).  Perhaps it slipped into the language without people
noticing.  Also, I substituted "it doesn't matter to me" (ne gravos al
mi) for "I won't notice" (mi ne konscios) because it sounds more
typical.

Perhaps look for an expression that's similar in English and Japanese
rather than the closest translation to "I love you".  I don't know
Japanese but maybe something like "Lisa is my favorite" or "Lisa is
the one".  Even if it doesn't say all of "I love you", she'll remember
the unspoken part every time she sees it.  And when a Japanese guest
sees the scroll, maybe they'll think, "I wouldn't say that but it
sounds pretty cool."

While you're not far wrong in principle, I think what you're missing is
that any sort of declaration like that is by its very nature (of being a
public declaration) somewhat juvenile from a Japanese perspective. It's
not just about the wording.

Now, doing the equivalent of building the Taj Mahal, that would translate

"We have to include a lot of adjectives and adverbs to get across
details of people's feelings, while Japanese verbs often contain these
subtleties already. One result of this is that Westerners make strange
blunders in Japanese because they are unaware of which emotion the verb
they have chosen conveys."

It's not that "love" has unusual subtext, it's the action of declaration

Maybe just "Lisa" then, or "Lisa the painter" or "Lisa --
mathemetician" or whatever she's good at.  Then it can look like a
simple gift rather than a "declaration".
