<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />FSFe Introduces Fiduciary License Agreement</h3>

<p>The Free Software Foundation Europe is trying to reduce problems
inherent in managing copyrights in large projects by launching a Fiduciary
License Agreement. This is essentially a way for a free software project to
place its collective copyright under the control of a single entity, the
FSFe. This has two main benefits. When contributors to a project become
difficult to track down, for a variety of reasons, the future of the
project gets threatened. If a single organization holds the copyright, it
is that much easier to deal with any legal issues, even in the absence of
the original authors. The second benefit is that different copyright
regimes across the world can be reconciled. With Open Source software
development being extremely geographically distributed, and getting more
so, this is an very important.</p>

<p>The various pros and cons of this move are discussed in an article on <a
href="http://enterprise.linux.com/article.pl?sid=07/02/09/1735247&amp;from=rss">Linux.com</a>.
The agreement is available at the <a
href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/fla/">FSFe website</a>.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Sun Looks to GPL v3 for Java, Solaris</h3>

<p>As reported earlier, Sun Microsystems is considering switching
OpenSolaris  to GPL v3. Java might also be licensed under GPL v3. Sun wants
to switch to the GPL so that it can appeal to developers who favor this
license. Also, GPL v3 is expected to have strong protection from patenting
issues. Sun is working closely with the Free Software Foundation on this.
</p>

<p>For Solaris, Sun will probably stick with a dual-licensing model, using
both the CDDL and GPL v3. This is possible since Sun owns all the copyright
to Solaris. <a

UK</a> has more details on this issue.</p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Solaris Zero-Day Vulnerability Found</h3>

<p>The Solaris community was rocked by the news of a  zero-day
vulnerability in Solaris 10. The telnet daemon has a security hole that
allows root access to be gained in a trivial manner. This was rather
embarrassing for Sun, since Solaris is supposed to be one of the most
secure server  operating systems. More information on this is available
from <a
href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102802-1">Sun</a>,

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />OpenSSL Revalidated After Arduous Battle</h3>

<p>OpenSSL has finally regained its FIPS 140-2 validation, and is available
for download. The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)
coordinates the requirements and standards for cryptographic modules, for
use by federal departments and agencies in the United States. Usually, this
process takes a few months, but in this case it took five years. This was
due to the entirely new approach that was followed to test OpenSSL. </p>

<p>Certain commercial software vendors also questioned the viability of an
Open Source SSL toolkit. The complaints included some interesting
questions, including one about the source code being "Communist", since a
Russian developer worked on it. There were valid questions as well, and the
OpenSSL developers state that their product is more secure now, after going
through such an extensive review process.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" /> Linus Torvalds takes on GNOME</h3>

<p>Linus Torvalds does not like the GNOME graphical environment, and he
recently <a

so</a> in no uncertain terms. This led to an ugly flame war on various
mailing lists. GNOME developer Christian F.K. Schaller invited Linus to use
GNOME for a month, and make constructive suggestions, instead of
"mudslinging".</p>

<p>Linus responded by submitting a string of patches that would "improve
the code", and add new features. These were subsequently <a
href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=408898">added to

safer to learn to use Linux. Nikolay Karpushin, the region's Education
Minister, has stated that schools will soon stop buying commercial

<p>Schools will use a localized version of Linux, as well as
OpenOffice.org. Some teachers have reservations, though, since they will be

besides cost and technical issues. Richard Stallman, speaking at a
technology conference in Cuba, laid out the benefits of free software. He
specified the security benefits, and also spoke about how copyrights
violate basic morality.</p>

<p>Cuba's Cabinet has urged a shift from proprietary software. Cuban
students are developing a customized version of Linux called Nova, based on
Gentoo distribution. The ministry of higher education is developing a

<p>ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley posted a <a

makes it clear that to Steve Ballmer, the Novell-Microsoft deal is all
about MS enforcing intellectual property pressure (IP) on Novell. According
to Ballmer, Open Source is not free, and will have to respect IP rights,
just as other competitors do.</p>

<p>Foley also links to an interview with Jeremy Allison where he states
that Microsoft is threatening people in the open source world with patent

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Novell, Microsoft Staff up Interoperability Lab</h3>

<p>In a nice counterpoint, Microsoft and Novell announced the opening of a

on Port 25, Microsoft's Open Source website, Sam Ramji, Director of
Platform Technology Strategy, stated that MS and Novell are looking for a
"few good people".</p>

<p>The lab will apparently be around for the long term, and shall focus on
interoperable virtualization between Windows and SLES. Both MS and Novell
want to qualify their respective virtual machine solutions on Windows and
SLES. Conspiracy theorists will be pleased to know that the lab will be
located in an "intermediate location".</p>

that led with the headline, "Novell could be banned from selling Linux".
Many in the Open Source community were angered by what they saw as an
attempt to spread FUD about Novell.</p>

<p>The article stated that the Free Software Foundation is "reviewing
Novell Inc.'s right to sell new versions of Linux operating system
software." It quoted Eben Moglen, the FSF's general counsel, as saying that
"...the community wants to do anything it can to interfere with this
deal". Unfortunately, Eben was apparently <a
href="http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS6837365670.html">misquoted</a>.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Red Hat Endorses KVM Virtualization</h3>

<p>After being merged into the Linux kernel, KVM Virtualization is gaining
traction. Red Hat announced that the next version of Fedora will include
KVM. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will still use Xen, however, since RH feels
that KVM lags Xen by at least a year's worth of development.</p>

<p>Still, the news is bound to spur KVM's development, especially since the
Chief Technical Officer of Red Hat praised KVM in no uncertain terms. Cnet

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Debian Gets Win32 Installer</h3>


<p>"Debian-Installer Loader", a win32 loader for Debian Installer was
released in February. This makes it simple to install Debian from a system
that has Microsoft Windows installed. According to the developers, "D-I-L
runs on the users' win32 system, auto-detects whether the CPU supports
64-bits, picks the appropriate linux and initrd.gz images for netboot, and
uses GRUB for DOS to chainload into it."</p>

<p>Inspired by a similar project for Ubuntu, it is hoped that this will
make it easier to migrate to Debian from Windows. It will also make it easy
to install Debian on systems that lack a CD-ROM drive, and it cuts out the
need for a user to burn an ISO image. The website <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Linspire, Canonical, Freespire, Ubuntu Join Forces</h3>

<p>Canonical Ltd., the sponsor of Ubuntu, and Linspire Inc., the developer
of Linspire and Freespire, announced a technology partnership to integrate
with each other's Linux distributions. Linspire/Freespire will now be based
on  Ubuntu, rather than Debian, and Ubuntu will integrate with Linspire's
CNR package installer/updater. This is good news for users, since the Click
'N Run system is <a
href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS7625722309.html">acknowledged</a>
to be simple, and effective.</p>

<p>The next version of Ubuntu, Feisty Fawn, will feature integration with
CNR. Ubuntu users will be able to use the CNR client to easily download and
install commercial programs and proprietary media drivers and codecs. If it
lives up to the hype, it should be a refreshing alternative to either
manually hunting down the various programs, or using scripts like <a

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Ubuntu Refuses to Activate Binary Drivers, and Reduces Support for PowerPC</h3>

<p>The Ubuntu Technical Board has decided to forego activating binary only
drivers by default in the next version of Ubuntu. The Board feels that
there is a need for wider testing of the alternatives available, and that
some of the relevant software is not fully mature yet.</p>

<p>However, Ubuntu 7.04 will make it "trivially easy" to enable both
enhanced desktop effects and the necessary driver support. This is a
best-of-both-worlds approach, which will be appreciated by many users.</p>

<p>In related news, the Technical Board also decided to reclassify the
PowerPC version of Ubuntu as "unofficial". A lack of resources was cited as
the reason.</p>

area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age
of 10, Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science
and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a
href="http://www.oftc.org">http://www.oftc.org</a>), had his first article
published, and became more involved in various communities and projects.
</p>

<p>
Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?
</p>

<p>
Sam prefers programming in C++ and Bash, is fluent in Java and PHP, and while
he can work in Perl, he hates it. If you would like to know more then feel free
to ask.
