Hello,
</p>

<p>
This is a nice intro to screen.
</p>

<p>
As you might expect ... some additional pointers from a long time
screen user <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<pre>
1. Your method of binding the C-\ key to command might cause you
   grief. The suggested method is "escape ^\\".
 
   You can also bind a "function key" to the screen command with
   something like "bindkey -k &lt;keyname&gt; command". The list of
   &lt;keyname&gt;s can be found in "man -s5 termcap" under the section
   "String Capabilities". I use "F1" which is the F11 key. (It should
   have been F12 but that is for the window manager).
 
   You can also use some command like "escape ^^^" to
   override the default C-a being bound to the escape key.
   There currently seems to be no way to specify "no escape key" to
   screen which is a bit unfortunate!
 
2. You can also use "C-a '&lt;initial char(s) of window name&gt;" to switch
   to a window for example "C-a 'Eli" followed by enter will switch
   to that window.
</pre>

<p>
Some other things to have fun with in screen are "nethack mode" and
more seriously cut-and-paste and multi-user mode.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

And, if... like me, you're using CVS screen, then there's vertical
window support (split screen) as well.  You can also save a window
layout once you've set it up.  There will, at some point, be support
for saved split screens across screen detachment/attachment.
