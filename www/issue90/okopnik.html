<p>  - "It's just a little further along... right through here, Frink."  </p>
    Woomert and Frink had had a long walk along the tunneled VPN connection, 
 their footsteps echoing against the titanium walls; once they reached the 
 comfortable spacious environment of their destination system, Frink had wanted
to pull up a comfortable variable and rest his tired feet, but Woomert had
insisted on pushing on. Now, Woomert turned and entered the room marked "<tt>/var/log/apache</tt>".
    
<p> "Ah, here we are - there's `<tt>/var/log/apache/access.log</tt>' - and
 just in time from the looks of it. The poor thing is up to 400MB and it's
 nearly filling up the partition, and it's only been a few days since it
was  rolled over!" </p>
    Frink, having dropped onto the sparkling clean floor (the system had
recently  been swept by "cruft") and arranging himself in a tailor's seat,
stared at  the bulging log file in fascination.    
<p>  - "What happened here, Woomert? I just came in to tell you about the 
 latest story in the newspapers, praising you to the sky for your solution 
 to the Missing Databases Mystery <a href="#1">[1]</a> at the Bigrich Bank,
 and you dragged me off without a word. Not that I mind, but..." </p>
    The famous detective smiled self-deprecatingly.    
<p>  - "I do tend to get a bit concentrated while on the job, don't I? Oh
 well - there are worse things. All right, here is what's happening: the
client,  a small company that specializes in making horseshoe welding sprockets
for  accountants working in the napkin-fringing industry, has become suspicious 
 of a few odd things happening with their web site. For example, their response
 time often spikes right through the roof, and they've been returning the
`<tt>Server busy</tt>' message much too often as compared to normal operation.
There hasn't been any huge jump in the amount of business they do - less,
since the economy these days doesn't permit too many luxuries like their
product - so..." </p>
    Frink nodded.    
<p>  - "It sounds like a DoS (Denial of Service) attack, Woomert." </p>
     - "Indeed." Woomert, deep in thought, pulled on his typing gloves and 
approached the local terminal. "This <b>is</b> a highly competitive industry, 
you know. This company maintains its lead by ferret-polishing the final product, 
but it's a narrow margin; the competitors would all love to get an advantage,
 and DoSing their web site just might do it. We've been hired to look around
 and report anything unusual, so this is just a statistics gathering mission. 
    
<p> Here, let's test a few things. First, though, lets make a couple of copies 
 of this file where it won't cram things quite as badly... There, I've put 
 them both in `<tt>/home/woomert</tt>'. We don't really want to lose any of
the data if we should accidentally damage or destroy one file, do we? Now,
let's zero out the actual log and restart the server... excellent. Now -
on to exploring the files. Given that you suspect a DoS - I do, as well -
 what would you look for, Frink?" </p>
    Frink scratched his head and frowned in concentration.    
<p>  - "I'm not sure, Woomert. I think I'd like to figure out the average
 hits per IP, and then maybe look at the sorted list of the same. That would
 tell us if someone is really slamming this server and from where, don't
you  think?" </p>
    Woomert smiled happily.    
<p>  - "Why, Frink, that sounds like an excellent idea! Yes, let's take a
 look at the average: </p>

<p> 12.30830039525692<br>
  </p>
   
<p> - "Hmm, interesting. Taking into account that the number is going to
be higher due to the very large DoS entries - we're still assuming those,
but it's a fair bet - that's not an unreasonable number. Most people will
probably examine a few models before making their decision to buy; after
all, it is a once-in-a-lifetime purchase. In fact, this company led the rest
of the pack in offering lifetime warranties... All right - now let's look

     - "Well, well; would you look at that! What's your estimate, Frink?" 
   
<p> Frink stared at the screen for a moment, then nodded. When he spoke,
there was a confident note in his voice. </p>
     - "It's a DoS. I'm willing to believe that someone would spend a day 
or so browsing this site, so the 103 and the 112 are border cases, but - 315
 <i>thousand</i> hits? I don't know that I'd call it a DDoS (a distributed
 DoS, where many machines at ones are attempting to flood a given network
or host) because the number of machines is fairly small, but it should definitely
 be an issue for further investigation - perhaps contacting the ISPs for
those  domains - and a temporary block at the firewall. Woomert, could we
look at  a sample entry for the different hits? I have a theory about this.
If it's  a long `GET' string, then... I wonder."    
<p> Woomert looked thoughtful, then nodded. </p>
     - "I see where you're going, Frink, and it's a reasonable possibility.

<p> Woomert and Frink looked at the screen, at each other, and exchanged
a high-five salute, with Frink adding his "double twist with finger snaps" 
 variation. </p>
     - "Woo-hoo! I called it right, Woomert. What do you think?"    
<p>  - "You did indeed, Frink, It looks like a modified version of a common
 worm, Code Red. The good news is that we're not dealing with a particularly
 sophisticated attacker, though: a Code Red <i>infection attempt</i>, which
 is what this is, is not the same thing as a Code Red <i>DoS</i>, which is
 just a network slam of a specific IP - <b>and</b> it only works against
legacy operating systems, certainly nothing as modern as Linux - which is
what this site runs. All these guys have going for them is bandwidth, and
that's not particularly bad - and once the client blocks those IPs and notifies
the relevant ISPs, it won't be an issue at all. In fact, there are analysis
and response utilities that can track this sort of thing and do it automatically, 
and I'll recommend them to the client. Here - " </p>
     Woomert quickly fired off the results and his comments to the client 
by  piping them into the "mail" program, and turned to Frink.    
<p>  - "...shall we? I have a <i>Paglia e Fieno con Pollo e Funghi</i> that
 should only take a few minutes to finish preparing, a <i>tiramisu</i> made
 to my own recipe for desert, and a really great '97<i> Rosso di Cerbaiona</i>
 wine that should go well with it all. My girlfriend, the lovely Priority
Interrupt, is going to join us." </p>
     - "Well, if you're sure that I won't be in the way..."    
<p>  - "Nonsense, Frink; we'd love your company."<br>
  <br>
  </p>
   
<hr width="100%" size="2">    
<p> After dinner, Frink lounged in the big armchair and Priority curled up 
in Woomert's lap and lit a huge <i>Toscano</i> cigar, which she used to produce 
beautuful double and sometimes triple rings of smoke. At Woomert's inquiring 
glance, she reached up and placed the cigar between his lips.</p>
    - "Aaah - luxury." Woomert leaned back and blew several rings that interlaced 
with Priority's. They smiled at each other. "So, Frink - questions? Answers? 
Guesses? Lay it on, my friend." 
<p>  Frink grinned at the two of them across the room.</p>
    - "Sure. I'm getting pretty good at reading those one-liners, though
- I might need a little help, but I think I'm getting there. What was it
you  typed, now... ah, here it is - I copied it into my <a
 href="http://www.sharp-usa.com/products/ModelLanding/0,1058,698,00.html">Zaurus</a>: 
<p> </p>
   
<pre><hr>perl -wlne'/^(\S+)/;$h{$1}++}{$a=@a=values%h;map{$b+=$_}@a;print$b/$a' access.log<hr></pre>
   OK, so - the `-wlne' switches enable warnings; read and print everything 
in `line mode', which strips EOL characters before and adds them back after; 
loops over the entire file one line at a time; and executes the code that
 follows. That's the easy part - I've been studying ``perldoc perlrun'' lately. 
Now, the code -   
<p><tt> /^(\S+)/</tt> </p>
   is a regex that captures all non-space characters starting from the beginning 
of the line. If we look at some typical lines from `access.log' -   
<p> <tt>127.0.0.1 - - [09/Mar/2003:22:14:46 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 50000 
"http://localhost/" "Lynx/2.8.4rel.1 libwww-FM/2.14" webcache-01.segfl.ifl.net 
- - [01/Apr/2003:05:45:27 -0500] "GET / HTTP/1.0" "-" 200 5238 </tt></p>
   we'll see that it's going to catch the IP or the hostname, either of which
 is terminated by a space. Next, I see something you've done before:   
<p><tt> $h{$1}++</tt> </p>
   That's a frequency count, isn't it?"   
<p> At Woomert's encouraging nod and smile, Frink went on. </p>
    - "OK. '$1' is a variable created by Perl which holds the first capture 
- that is, the contents of the first pair of parentheses in a regex. In this
 case, that's the IP. So, you use the IP as a key in the `<tt>%h</tt>' hash 
- and increment the value associated with that IP every time you see it. If
it's a new IP, you get a new key.   
<p> Next... um. Next, there's a <i>closing</i> brace all by itself... and 
I don't understandand what it does - or even why the code works. Shouldn't 
that fail with a syntax error?"</p>
   Woomert grinned.   
<p> "Normally, it would. However - go ahead and pull up ``<tt>perldoc perlrun</tt>''
 again, and take a look at the entry for `-p': </p>
<tt>   # From ``perldoc perlrun''</tt>   
<pre>   while (&lt;&gt;) {<br>       ...             # your program goes here<br>   } continue {<br>       print or die "-p destination: $!\n";<br>   }<br></pre>
   Note the ``your program goes here'' comment. What happens if you insert 
a closing brace there?"   
<p> Frink concentrated on the code. Suddenly, his face lit up. </p>
    - "Oh! I see it, I see it! A closing brace would terminate the `while'
 statement... and an opening brace after it would create a block just past
 it. What you've done is get out of the `while' loop; everything after the
 curly brace only gets executed once. This is almost the same as using an
`<tt>END{}</tt>' block. Wonderful!   <a href="#2">[2]</a>
<p> All right, since we have that, the rest isn't too tough. Let's see: </p>
 <tt>  $a=@a=values%h;</tt>   
<p> All right, you extract the list of values - all the counts - from the 
hash and set `$a' to the number of values returned; that's what you get when 
you look at a list in a scalar context (it's a bit more complex than that, 
but that's the part that's important right now.) Next, you sum up all those
 values -  </p>
 
<p><tt> map{$b+=$_}@a;</tt> </p>
   The `map' function iterates over `@a' and increments `$b' by the value 
of each of the elements. Last but not least -  
<p></p>
 <tt>  print$b/$a</tt>   
<p> you print out the ratio of that sum over the count of the elements - thus
dividing the total hits by the number of IPs. How's that?" </p>
   Woomert and Priority clapped and cheered as Frink turned pink and bowed,
 smiling.   
<p>  - "Thank you, thank you... I guess spending all that time studying under
 Woomert's direction is starting to pay off - thanks, Woomert! The rest of
 them are somewhat similar: </p>
    
<pre><hr>
perl -wlne'/^(\S+)/;$h{$1}++}{print"$h{$_}\t$_"for sort{$h{$a}&lt;=&gt;$h{$b}}keys%h' access.log<hr></pre>
   
<p> The first part we already know - do a frequency count of the IPs. In the
end block, however, you do something different; we'll parse it right to left,
just as Woomert taught me:  </p>
 
<p> <tt>sort{$h{$a}&lt;=&gt;$h{$b}}keys%h</tt> </p>
   OK - this time, you extract the keys, and... oh, I see. You want to sort
 the hash by value, but plain old ``<tt>for ( values %h ){ ... }</tt>'' won't 
work - there's no way to retrieve a key given a value, since values aren't
 necessarily unique. So, you change the `<tt>sort</tt>' routine - just as 
``<tt>perldoc -f sort</tt>'' explains - to sort the keys based on the value. 
This is done by using `<tt>$a</tt>' and `<tt>$b</tt>' which are the variables 
that Perl uses to hold the elements that `<tt>sort</tt>' is currently comparing. 
In return, you get a list that's sorted by value and still allows you to look
at keys - slick! Next, you take that list and print it with a bit of formatting:
  
<p><tt> print"$h{$_}\t$"for ...</tt> </p>
   You loop over the list of returned keys with the "<tt>for</tt>" operator. 
The default variable in the loop, `<tt>$_</tt>', contains each key in turn, 
and `<tt>$h{$_}</tt>' return its associated value. You then print a tab and 
the key - which is the IP or the hostname. This gives us our list of IPs -
and the associated number of hits.  
<p>  Last but not least, we have this: </p>
 
<p>  </p>
 
<pre><hr>
perl -lne'/^(\S+).*?"(.*?)"/;length$h{$1}&gt;length$2or$h{$1}=$2}{print"@a"while@a=each%h' access.log 
<hr><pre><br></pre></pre>
 Whew. It's a tough one. Let's see: the regex isn't too bad -<br>
 <br>
 
<pre>/^(\S+).*?"(.*?)"/<br></pre>
  <br>
   It captures the IP as before, but now it also matches any character up 
to the first double-quote - the '?' modifier following the '*' quantifier
 makes the expression non-greedy so that it <i>is</i> the first one - and 
captures everything until the next double-quote, with the same non-greedy 
method. The first double-quotes... oh, that would be the HTTP request string, 
just what we wanted to see. Next... ooops. Woomert - help?"<br>
 <br>
 
<p> Woomert lazily extracted a laser pointer from his shirt pocket and pointed. 
</p>
   - "I assume you mean this?  
<p><tt> length$h{$1}&gt;length$2or$h{$1}=$2</tt> </p>
  What I needed to do here is save the longest string as the value. In order 
to do that, I had to compare the current value for a given IP with the next 
value for that IP that came along. However, the initial value for a new key 
is undefined - and Perl would give us an error message if we compared something
to an `undef'. That, as well as the interpolation of "<tt>@a</tt>" at the
end are both things that would cause Perl to generate a non-fatal warning
- so I turned off the warnings by skipping the `-w' switch, something you
should <b>not</b> do unless you understand all the effects of doing so (read
``<tt>perldoc perllexwarn</tt>'' for more.) The method itself is fairly simple:
I compare the length of the value currently assigned to the key; if it is
greater, I replace the old value with the current one (contained in `<tt>$2</tt>').
Note that I'm using the soft `<tt>or</tt>' operator: a logical `<tt>or</tt>'
(<tt>||</tt>) would not work here, since it would bind too tightly to the 
surrounding elements.  
<p> Can you do the rest?" </p>
  Frink nodded.  
<p>  - "Yes; it looks fairly easy. </p>
<tt>  print"@a"while@a=each%h</tt>  
<p> I've seen you do this before... oh yes. It's a ``<tt>while each</tt>''
loop that retrieves a key-value pair from a hash; you're assigning them to
an array and printing the array. Since you've interpolated it by using double
quotes around the array name, you'll get a space between the elements - which 
makes it nicely readable. All together, this prints out our hash - in more-or-less
random order, but we don't really care since we just want to see what's in
it. Right?" </p>
   - "Very good, Frink; you've done very well. I'll be relying on you to provide
some backup in our further adventures, then. Are you ready for it?"  
<p>  - "I... I hope so, Woomert." Frink looked up, proud as can be. "I believe 
so. I'll certainly do my best. I'll head off for home then, and leave you 
two alone. Have a great night." </p>
  As the door closed behind the inordinately proud Frink, Priority smiled
at Woomert.  
<p>  - "You've made Frink's week, you know. That's quite a compliment." </p>
   - "He deserves it; he's learned quite a lot. I'm very pleased with him, 
and quite proud of him. And now, Priority," Woomert's laser pointer fired
a beam at the stereo, which softly began to play an Ella Fitzgerald/Luis Armstrong
rendition of ``<i>Can Anyone Explain</i>'', "we have far more important things
to discuss than Frink or programming..."  
<p> </p>
<hr> <tt><a name="1"></a>[1] In regard to this, my mysterious correspondent
notes: "This is a case where continued secrecy is necessary to the Bank's
security arrangements. Perhaps one day, the world will be apprised of the
brilliant, decisive, and above all courageous actions of the Great Detective

for this particular Perl hack; it was created by Abigail in </tt><tt>comp.lang.perl.misc

 brilliant one-liners have been known to stump Woomert on occasion...    <br>
