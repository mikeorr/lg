<H2>Usenix/Uselinux in Anaheim</H2>

Here I am at Usenix at the Mariott Hotel in Anaheim. Actually,
it is pleasant to be in nice weather after almost drowning in
Seattle. It had rained here the day before so the air
was actually clean. But, let me talk about the show instead of the weather.
<P> 
Usenix is a five-day show that, this year, has a heavy Linux
presence. For those not familiar with Usenix, it has been the &quot;wear a tie
and get laughed at&quot; Unix show for years. It is technical
and tends to draw a very seriously technical crowd.
<P> 
It is broken up into tutorials, a trade show and a technical
conference. Well, plus the informal beer drinking sessions and such.

<P> <HR> <P>  
<center><H4>Tutorial Days </H4></center>
<P>
The first two days are tutorials and I elected to attend an all-day
tutorial on the Linux 2.0 kernel presented by Stephen Tweedie. I found
it to be excellent and that seemed to be the general opinion of the
approximately 125 people who attended.
<P> 
In eight hours and 170 overheads, Stephen addressed four specific
areas of the kernel: memory management, the scheduler, filesystems and
I/O and networking. I feel the goal of the talk, &quot;to be with
the design and algorithms behind the Linux kernel and to be able
to read the Linux source code with some understanding&quot;
was met. While Stephen did not necessarily expect attendees
to be familiar with Unix systems programming, the more you
knew about Unix the easier it was to understand the
presentation. After all, learning all about a new operating
system in eight hours is quite a challenge.
<P> 
On Tuesday, Ted T'so taught a tutorial on writing device drivers under
Linux. This talk was attended by about 60 students. I elected to
take Tuesday as a day to catch up on <I>LJ</I> work and make a run to
Fry's Electronics to see if they carry <I>Linux Journal</I>. They
don't--which makes no sense as Fry's is exactly the
kind of place a Linux geek would want to go.
<P> 
Tuesday evening started with free food and drink. This is one of
the best ways to get geeks talking. The Marriott did a great job
with an array of food carts with various choices including fruit,
veggies, potato patties, nachos, hamburgers and hot dogs. There
were also drink and dessert carts. They even had my drug of
choice, Dr. Pepper.
<P> 
There were Birds-of-a-Feather sessions scheduled from 6PM
to 10PM. The two Linux ones were scheduled at the same time,
both at 7PM. As I already know a lot about Caldera Linux I
elected to go to the talk on Electronic Design Automation
(EDA). Peter Collins, manager of software services for
Exemplar Logic, headed the BoF and talked about how his
company had done an NT port but now had a Linux port. He
pointed out that EDA grew up on Unix-based systems like Suns and
the capabilities of Linux were a better fit for current EDA users.
<P> <HR> <P> 
<center><H4>  The Trade Show </H4> </center>
<P> 
The trade show started on Wednesday. While this was not a Linux-specific
trade show, Linux had a large presence. Linux vendors included
Caldera, EST (makers of the bru backup utility), InfoMagic, Linux
International, Red Hat, Walnut Creek CDROM, Workgroup Solutions and
Yggdrasil. Plus, of course, our booth where we were giving away
sample copies of <I>Linux Journal</I>. Lots of other
vendors came by to talk about Linux and the Linux products they sell.
<P> 
Linux interest was very high. While Usenix is a geek conference,
these are mostly professional geeks who are making serious technical
decisions for real companies. I answered many &quot;It seems
like Linux could do this&quot; inquiries.
<P> 
Within the trade show I think SSC offered the biggest hit. We just
finished our new &quot;fences&quot; t-shirt. We sold out of the
shirts in about four hours on the first day. This gave me the
feeling that I was at the right show--not one where Microsoft
was being honored.
<P> <HR> <P> 
<center><H4> Linus Talks and Linux Talks </H4></center>
<P> 
On Wednesday afternoon we proved how significant the Linux
interest/presence was. Linus was scheduled to talk on the future of
Linux in a fairly large room, which soon filled up, with standees
everywhere--including the hall outside. Usenix quickly offered
to move the crowd into a much larger hall.
<P> 
The talk went well as Linus explained new features and new
ideas. I won't bore you with details. The important thing is that
the goal is world domination. To some this sounded like humor. Maybe
it was. Only time will tell. In the mean time, building a superior
product can't hurt.
<P> 
Wednesday evening was a time for more Linux sessions. I attended
one called <I>The Classroom of the Future</I> that showed how an
experimental program brought the Internet to K-12 schools in
Ireland. I also attended another called <I>The Future of the
Linux Desktop</I>, missing Greg Wettstein's talk on perceptions. [see
Greg's article &quot;Linux in the Trenches&quot; in <I>LJ</I> #5,
September 1994--Ed.]
<P> 
Thursday was another day of talks and trade show. Peter Struijk,
SSC's &quot;head nerd&quot; managed to make it to
Victor Yodaiken' presentation on real-time Linux [see
<I>LJ</I> #34, February 1997] and a talk on the /proc file system
by Stephen Tweedie. In the evening,
I hosted a session on embedded, turnkey and real-time systems and
intended to make it to Developing Linux-based electronic markets
for Internet Trading Experiments but ended up talking with
some of the attendees of my session instead.
<P> 
The evening ended with a short talk about Linux and reality with
Stephen Tweedie and then a trip back to the hotel room to finish up
this column. Then, if I run out of things to do I may actually
get some sleep.
<P> 
Friday offers a day of Uselinux business talks. However, the
combination of editorial deadlines and exhaustion mean that
you won't get to read about it here.
<P><HR> <P>  
<center><H4> What Next? </H4></center>
<P> 
It was a great show. Usenix has always been a great show offering
high-quality sessions and a really nice mix of
&quot;non-suites&quot;. Having Usenix/Uselinux made it all the
better. I am sure there will be serious cooperation between Usenix and Linux
International to continue to make Linux a big part of Usenix.
<P> 
If I have one complaint it was that there was too much to do. Add
a Linux International board meeting to a schedule that included
sessions, talks and BoFs from 9AM to 11PM with parallel Linux tracks
plus the normal Usenix tracks and there just wasn't time to breathe
or, more importantly, sit down to a beer and talk to fellow kernel
hackers, systems administrators or vendors.
<P> 
Anyone who wants to get copies of the Proceedings of this
conference or find out what the future holds with regard to Usenix,
should contact USENIX Association at <A HREF="mailto:office@usenix.org">
office@usenix.org</A> or check out their web site at
<A HREF="http://www.usenix.org/">http://www.usenix.org/</A> or, if all else fails, call
510-528-8649. Oh, and if you don't know what 8649 spells you
must be new to the Unix community.
