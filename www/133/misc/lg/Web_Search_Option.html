<p>
Am looking for ways to enable search options for one of the websites (open
source, not meant for business <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> ) am responsible for maintenance.
</p>

<p>
However, it's not for the entire website for a specific section (FAQ pages).
</p>

<p>
Any ideas ?
</p>

<p>
/Ram
</p>

<p>
P.S: Prefer to do it using scripts written in sed / awk.

While your problem is not that clear, I believe you are trying to provide 
search capabilities for information already posted on your web site. If 
so, then I would suggest using Google. This is easily done by creating a 
form that queries Google; an example of this implementation (HTML)...
</p>

<p>
<pre>
&lt;form method=GET action="<a href="http://www.google.com/search">http://www.google.com/search</a>"&gt;
&lt;input type=text name=q value=""&gt;
&lt;input type=submit name=btnG value="Search"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<pre>
&gt; P.S: Prefer to do it using scripts written in sed / awk.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Why would you be searching web page content with sed/awk? Unless you are 
trying to search through some other material? Please explain yourself more 
clearly so that we can help you better.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>

I supposehe wants to setup a local search engine which is not
dependent on remote access for the search facility. Here are some
known options:
</p>

<p>
1. htdig 2. swish-e 3. swish++ 4. do-it-yourself
</p>

<p>
Since 1-3 do not use sed/awk and Ramanathan wants to it looks like 4
is the only solution available. Be aware that speed of search is
directly correlated with the programming effort involved in setting
up the search engine <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Oh, and - *do not* make this classic rookie's mistake with your CGI:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
read input
grep $input /my/web/tree/*
</pre>
Here's the reason:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
&lt;strong&gt;Please enter the search term:&lt;/strong&gt;
a b; rm -rf *
</pre>
Your suicide weapon^W^Wcommand line now looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
grep a b; rm -rf * /my/web/tree/*
</pre>
Unless you're absolutely sure that you understand and can do
good-quality, secure web scripting, I strongly suggest sticking with
Kapil's first three options or something similar.

<p>
You got it right. Information (huge content to browse thru') available
already in the website should be searchable. I think your query tips should
help me.
</p>

<p>
One question (sorry for my ignorance :-(( ) :
</p>

<p>
Will your form query search the content in the current website OR the entire
WWW via Google.

Thanks Kapil and Samuel.

<p>
But I may not be able to setup the local search engine as I do not have the
necessary access privileges on the system where the website (FAQ page) is

Initial expectations, while posting to [TAG], was to have something like
shown in the attachment.
</p>

<p>
It has options to search the web and the local website content as well.
</p>

<p>
Is this possible with the "form query" sample code provided by Samuel ?

Whoops, sorry, that will search the whole Internet. Add the following line

<p>

&lt;input type=hidden name=sitesearch value="DOMAIN"&gt;

...replacing DOMAIN with your web site's URL. You can also give your users 
the option between searching the whole Internet or your web site. To do 
this instead of the above line you would use the following radio 
buttons...
</p>

<p>
<pre>
&lt;input type=radio name=sitesearch value=""&gt; WWW &lt;input type=radio 
name=sitesearch value="DOMAIN" checked&gt; DOMAIN

will probably want the first method.

Hmm... I started to test this in my local web server but looks like this
simple thing is taking quite difficult to get working.
</p>

<p>
On my Windows system running Apache v2.x with Activestate Perl installed,
this is the code is returning the famous 500 internal server error.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the Apache server configuration has been modified to recognize Perl
scripts.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
#!C:/Program Files/ActivePerl/bin/perl.exe
</p>

<p>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Search Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Search this site&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;form method=GET action=" <a href="http://www.google.com/search">http://www.google.com/search</a>"&gt;
&lt;input type=radio name=sitesearch value=""&gt; WWW

Just having one radio button is not going to create an easily usable 
form. Use the text boxes and hidden field from my previous messages as 
well and then see what happens.

Also, I do not know anything about Windows Apache. Nor is this the place 
to talk about Windows software (a few select topics aside). Asking about 
the HTML is fine, but please do not expect us to debug Windows errors on a 
Linux mailing list.

I suspect that one of the confusions is that so far, the sample offered
is not code, and has nothing to do with CGI scripting.

<p>
It's just part of a simple html form which submits to Google. Save it
in a file called something like search.htm, and view it in your browser
(either as a file or as a http: url).
</p>

<p>
The four lines in the first reply, plus the name=sitesearch one from a
later reply in the right place, should do the job. No coding or anything
else on your side.
</p>

<p>
It will only work if Google has already indexed your site, of course. If
that isn't the case, then you want to fall back to plan B.

Good luck,

I safely assume this "index" is already there, as I _will be doing_ this for
the FAQ section in Subversion's (that open-source SCM tool) website.

Yes, the index is there but you may not be in it. Once your site is 
complete and online then you should add your site to Google's index 
manually at <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl">http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl</a> (unless the 
HTML form works). For more web master help with Google:

&gt; 
&gt;    Exactly, this is what I did. Copied the code into htdocs dir and renamed the
&gt;    file as .html.
&gt;    It works. Thanks ;-P

Ram, I'd appreciate it if you'd turn off the HTML encoding and use
standard quoting when posting to this list (i.e., precede the lines that
you're replying to with '&gt;' instead of tabs.) Your current methods lead
to extra work for our Mailbag editor, and annoy those of us who have to
process this stuff before reading it. In fact, I'd suggest that you
review "Asking Questions of The Answer Gang" at
<a href="../../../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a> - lots of good tips on
standard list behavior there, as well as helpful hints and instructions.
