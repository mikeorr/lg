 Hello,

<br><br>
 I saw a post by your hand from 26 Apr 98 in
 <A HREF="news:comp.os.linux.development.system"
	>comp.os.linux.development.system</A> where you said a lot of noteworthy
 things on linux security. Also I have been talking to Jos Vos from
 Xopen Systems (who wrote the <TT>ipfwadm</TT> package).

<br><br>
 Both you and he noted the possibility to break out of a <TT>chroot</TT> jail
 (once you become root there). It seems that devices are the weak
 factor.

	>It seems that letting anyone "become root there" is the weak
	factor!  If we can reduce the need to "become root" --- by
	providing mechanisms other than "SUID" and "SGID" programs
	for accessing "privileged" operations than we have made
	some progress.

<br><br>
	One approach would be the POSIX.1e "capabilities" (which are
	more like VMS style "privileges" than true "capabilities").
	There is a bit of preliminary work being done on this in the
	2.1.x kernels --- but nothing is likely be usable in 2.2
	(so you're looking at Linux 2.4 before there is "stable" support
	for any of that).

<br><br>
	Another approach is to limit the damage that '<TT>root</TT>' can do
	using something like the BSD securelevel features.  Last I
	heard on the Linux kernel mailing list they had dropped plans
	to put in simple '<TT>securelevel</TT>' support in favor of a
	"more flexible" approach --- which would mesh better with the
	eventual POSIX.1e ("Orange Book") work.

<ul>
		<li>(The implementations of 'securelevel' in all of
		   the popular BSD variants, free and commercial
		   have been vulnerable to a few attacks via the
		   <TT>/proc</TT> filesystem and more recently via
			<TT>ptrace()</TT>
		   --- so having Linux adopt one of those designs
		  might not be a sound idea.  We'll see).
</ul>

	I'm a little shy on the implementation details and design
	but I think they said it would essentially be a bit field
	of limitations that would be set on a per process basis.
	There would be bits to prevent various syscalls like
	<TT>mknod()</TT>, <TT>chroot()</TT>, <TT>mount()</TT>, etc.
	In the POSIX.1e model
	this would later become the "maximum privileges mask" ---
	and the individual privileges would be set by meta data on
	the executable files (think of that as a list of about 80
	"P" bits rather than just the SUID and SGID bits we have now).

<br><br>
	The argument for this is that we could set any set of
	this bits we want on the '<TT>init</TT>' process (PID 1) to accomplish
	the same limitations as we get with BSD's '<TT>securelevel</TT>'.

<br><br>
	That's a pretty compelling argument so far as I'm concerned.
	My main hesitation beyond that has to do with code
	complexity.  The BSD crowd has been trying to get their
	'<TT>securelevel</TT>' implementations right for years --- and the
	<TT>ptrace()</TT> bug was just found a couple of weeks ago.

<br><br>
	It's not a simple problem.   NT's "object" model (and I
	use the term "object" very loosely)  provides ACL's on
	files, registry keys, and all sorts of other OS elements.
	There is work underway to add ACL support to Linux ---
	over some filesystems at least.  However, I'm convinced
	that ACL's are a fundamentally flawed security model ---
	and that opinion is based on some pretty good academic work.

<br><br>
	Unfortunately the true capabilities security model entails
	a completely different programming paradigm --- it doesn't
	translate to Unix conventions at all.  In my research
	(purely "armchair" or "book larnin'") I spent most of my
	energy trying to unlearn the Unix, Netware, and NT approaches.

<br><br>
	You can read more about the capabilities security model at
	Jonathan Shapiro's "EROS" (extremely reliable OS) web site:

<blockquote><code>		<A HREF="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eros/"
		>http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eros/</A>
</code></blockquote>

	(EROS is an ongoing research project which will hopefully
	eventually be available as a production operating system).

	>I have been thinking about disabling the <TT>mount()</TT> or
 better the <TT>mknod()</TT> systemcall when executed from <TT>chroot</TT>'ed
 programs (patching the kernel).

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50"
             alt="(!)" border="0"
	>I think the "<TT>capabilities</TT>" (or Linux "<TT>securelevel</TT>" or
	"<TT>privmask</TT>") patches will allow you to disable access to these
	sorts of syscalls.  I also suspect that these "disabilities"
	(a more apt description really) will be inherited by all
	forked processes.  They will certainly need to be immutable
	(by the process) and will have to imply certain disabilities
	with regards to <TT>kmem</TT> and <TT>/proc</TT> access by the
	'<TT>root</TT>' processes
	that are running within these process groups.

<br><br>
	You can look at the existing patches (in the recent 2.1.1xx
	kernels) and possibly build on that.

	> Do you think that would be worth the effort? We currently run
<TT>ftpd</TT>, <TT>telnetd</TT>, <TT>sshd</TT> and some more things
 <TT>chroot</TT>'ed in a very minimal linux
 environment. Based on the false assumption that even when you make it
 to becoming root you cannot break out of that.
</p></strong>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50"
             alt="(!)" border="0"
	>The assumption that the <TT>chroot()</TT> jail is inescapable by
	rogue root processes is very bad.  You've discovered that.

<br><br>
	The main advantage for <TT>chroot()</TT> have to do with limiting
	the number of SUID/SGID programs that are accessible in the
	effort to exploit various vulnerabilities that are used to
	<EM>get</EM> root or other unauthorized access.  The other advantage
	is that you can limit the amount of snooping that a class
	of users (anonymous and guestgroup ftp, for example) can
	perpetrate on other users on the system.

<br><br>
	In other words you can limit the exposure of your "general"
	users from some classes of other users.  For a long time
	the most important element of this was to prevent FTP users
	from grabbing your passwd file and running '<TT>crack</TT>' on it.
	With the advent of shadow password systems that has been
	much less of a concern.

<br><br>
	These days the most common approach to securing systems
	is to create special, sacrificial hosts for each service
	and class of users.  Linux and {Free|Net|Open}-BSD have
	made this an increasingly economical and attractive option
	since we can put any old "junker" 386 or better to work
	in this sort of role (some people are <EM>giving</EM> away 386 and
	486 systems these days).  This is easy enough for commercial
	sites --- but more of a problem for ISP's and educational
	sites, which traditionally still have shell access to at
	least some of their machines.

	>I think very few programs use <TT>mknod()</TT>, and that probably are
 the programs you wouldn't allow in a <TT>chroot</TT>'ed environment anyway. I
 also think it would be a relatively small patch, I've done some digging and
 - not being a kernel expert - it seemed pretty easy. The only thing
 left to find out is how to detect in the kernel that the current env
 is <TT>chroot</TT>'ed.

	>The kernel obviously already tracks the 'root' directory
	(device:inode) for every process.  I think it's a field
	in the uarea struct (a data structure maintained by the
	kernel for every process).

	>Look at the existing (2.1.x) sources for references to
	"securelevel" and "capabilities" --- I'm sure they're in there
	somewhere.  You can also consider contributing to the
	Linux Security Audit project.  See the following URL's for
	more details:

<dl><dt>The Linux Weekly News article on it
		(search on the keyword "audit"):

	<dd><A HREF="http://www.lwn.net/980625/">http://www.lwn.net/980625/</A>

<br>&nbsp;<br>

	If your organization needs these features and is willing to
	donate some web space and some personnel time and expertise
	to the project --- you'll be doing yourself and all of us
	alot of good.
