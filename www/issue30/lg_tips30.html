Producing a resume in PDF with LaTeX
</H3>

LaTeX and the resume.sty package are an easy way to produce a very
attractive resume under Linux.  One just needs to fill in the
boilerplate provided.  resume.sty is available from any CTAN
archive, such as cdrom.com:<br>
<a
href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/.1/tex/ctan/macros/latex209/contrib/resume">ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/.1/tex/ctan/macros/latex209/contrib/resume</a>
<p>
However, I've found that windows users are often not familiar with the
usual Postscript output of the dvips program or how to view it. 
Luckily, Ghostscript provides the ps2pdf program for converting
Postscript to Adobe's Portable Document Format, which is fairly familiar
to windows users.
<p>
However, converted ps documents that were produced from LaTeX source
using the default Computer Modern fonts look very poor when read with
the Adobe PDF reader.  The trick is to use the times package, which
changes all the fonts produced by your LaTeX source to one the Adobe
reader can handle.  Just include the package like this in your document:
<pre>
\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\usepackage{resume,times}
%other preamble commands
\begin{document}
%document body
\end{document}
</pre>
<p>
Some other things worth mentioning here: PStill, another PS-&gt;PDF
converter; pdfTeX, which produces PDF instead of DVI files from TeX
input; and finally the TeX User's Group page which has tons of great
links:<br>

Hello, included is a possible tip for the Linux Gazette.
<p>
Ever needed to know what the official UNIX man page for
a particular command or function says? A new web resource
from The Open Group is the Common Access to the UNIX Man Pages,
a hypertext html set of browsable pages common to all UNIX 95
and UNIX 98 branded systems.
<p>
To try it out see <a

ext2 Partitions </H3>

I recently ran into a small problem, and I think the results of
it might be helpful to others. I was recently helping out a
friend with a problem on his Linux machine, and we needed to find
a file-unfortunately, neither of us knew where it might've been
installed.
<p>
Having both ext2 and vfat partitions, we realized that doing a
find command might take a while, and would probably give some
false results. We knew there might be files with similar names
on his vfat partition-files we were sure were not the ones we
were looking for. We knew the files we were looking for would
only be on the ext2 partitions.
<p>
We started looking for an answer with the -mount option for the
find command; unfortunately for us, it only looked at files on
the same device as the path given to the find command. (A look
at the results of the mount command shows why that would be a
problem for us.)
<pre>
 /dev/hda2 on / type ext2 (rw)
 none on /proc type proc (rw)
 /dev/hda6 on /home type ext2 (rw)
 /dev/hda8 on /tmp type ext2 (rw)
 /dev/hda7 on /usr type ext2 (rw)
 /dev/hda1 on /win95 type vfat (rw,umask=0111)
</pre>
<p>
We tried writing a batch file, using grep and gawk to get the
mount points for the ext2 partitions and handing them to find.
This proved unworkable if we were looking for patterns, such
as h2*. We then tried to write just a find command, using gawk
and grep to get the mount points. This was somewhat better,
but using a print statement in gawk to get the names of the
mount points wouldn't work. Some help came with remembering that
gawk has a printf statement, allow.
<p>
Our final product, which we found quite useful and now have in
our .bashrc files as <B>linuxfind</B>, is the following:
<pre>
 find `mount|grep ext2|gawk '{printf "%s ", $3}'` -name
</pre>
<p>
To use as an alias:
<pre>
alias linuxfind="find `mount|grep ext2|gawk '{printf "%s ", $3}'` -name "
</pre>
<p>
Written this way, other options to the find command can be
specified, such as <tt>-perm</tt>, <tt>-exec</tt> and <tt>-type</tt>. To use 
it, we simply type something like:
<pre>
 linuxfind less
 linuxfind h2*
 linuxfind x* -perm -2000
</pre>
<p>
The only problems we can see with this command so far are (1)
if there are drives mounted at login that are unmounted during
the session, the mount points are still searched, and (2) if a
drive is mounted after login, it is not included unless the
.bashrc files is sourced.

In regards to the question on starting X with 16 bitplanes instead of 8
(LG#28)...
<p>
I have done the following (assuming you are using XFree86)
<p>
Open up and edit your XF86Config file.
<p>
Look for the "Screen" section you are using.
Add an entry right after that specifying the default colors of the
format:
<pre>
      DefaultColorDepth   16
</pre>
<p>
This will default your screen to 16 bit planes.
<p>
My example screen section follows:
<pre>
Section "Screen"
    Driver      "accel"
    Device      "STB Velocity 128"
    Monitor     "My Monitor"
    DefaultColorDepth 16
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       8
        Modes       "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       16
        Modes       "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       24
        Modes       "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection
    Subsection "Display"
        Depth       32
        Modes       "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
        ViewPort    0 0
    EndSubsection

Network Cards</H3>

Hi, there just like to give some tip or two regarding Network cards you 
have in you Linux Box.
<p>
I have a 3Com 3c90x in my computer and it's not working up to speed, I 
replaced it with anther one of the same kind and the most I get out of ftp 
transfers from my machine is a measly 220 KB/s.. Samba acted weird..  I 
thought that it's my network that caused the problem, indeed, it is the 
problem..
<p>
Our network is all Cisco and there seems to be some disagreement between 
the two brands, Changed my card to an Intel 'eepro100' and I can max out at 
800 KB/s on a 10 Mbs network.. Cool.
<p>
So, if you find out that performance is not as cool (those Win NT guys may 
be laughing at you as they did to me wondering why Linux is Super Slow) as 
it should be, it could be the network card itself..
<p>
Regards,<br>

Following up to Andreas Ehliar's 2cent article
in the June Linux Gazette, I took the same approach and made a patch
for KDE to shift some functionality from ALT to the W95 key.
Full instructions and patch against Beta-4 can be found

PPP, SLIP and Other Remote Service Support</H3>
<P> 
From: Daniel Blezek <a

Date: Wed, 17 Jun 1998 22:40:48 -0500
<p>
Hi, here's a short tip:
<p>
  Recently, I started working from home on a UNIX system.  The system I was
working on did not support PPP, SLIP, or any other remote service except
shell sessions over a 9600 baud modem.  So I decided to download SLIrP(a
program to emulate PPP/SLIP using only a shell session) to the remote
system to emulate PPP over a shell connection.  Here is the snag, the
remote system did not support zmodem, ymodem, kermit or any of the other
file transfer protocols.  Since I had no TCP/IP connection, I could not use
rsh, or ftp.  Solution?  I used uuencode to convert the SLIrP binary to
text, started vi on the remote system, and copied and pasted the entire
text(all 360K) into the remote shell session.  After eating dinner, I
returned to write the uuencoded binary to the remote hard disk, uudecoded
it, uncompressed it, and started up SLIrP on the remote system.  After pppd
came up on my LINUX system, I was fully connected.
<p>
Ain't LINUX fun?
