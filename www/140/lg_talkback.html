</p>

<p>
Sorry I do not have the last mail in this series.  Please post this mail 
properly to TAG list members and wherever else it goes.  I discovered our 
long email exchange is now on the web.  Thanks.
</p>

<p>
The author of BasicLinux helped me to get eznet working properly for 
'user'.  He said eznet behaves properly (does not reset permissions on 
/dev/tty*) if you exit it (ppp-off) before rebooting.  Otherwise it
leaves permissions reset so only root can dial.  (It might be safest to 
also chmod o+w /dev/ttyS1 in rc too for when user forgets to hang up).
</p>

<p>
I am finally ready to set up the latest version of Basiclinux (3.50 - with 
jwm window manager that can be used without a mouse) for use by 'user'.
</p>

<p>
61MB with libc5 (used in the original download to save space), glibc 2.2.5 
so (added for Opera), links, links2, lynx, Opera 9.21, kermit, msmtp (SMTP 
authentication), base64 to encode attachments for msmtp, dropbear and scp, 
abiword, netpbm, gs-8.54, mplayer, sox, svgalib, svp (svgalib-based ps/pdf 
viewer), zgv, antiword, xlhtml, ppthtml, all added to the jwm menu, and 
everything that came in the original 2-FD download including Xvesa, jwm, 
mgp, xli, and pcmcia support but no compiler.  2.2.26 kernel so no 
USB-storage support unless you change to 2.4.31 kernel and modules.
</p>

<p>
To start vt1 in X:
tty1::respawn:-/bin/sh -sc startx
rather than changing runlevels.
</p>

<p>
What else might the novice linux user want?  Someone's friend says their 
computer is too slow for the internet.  I will make it run faster by 
adding linux.
</p>

<p>
Running Linux 2nd Edition (kernel 1.1) recommended 40MB for linux, or 
250MB for a really large distribution.  I could have done it in about 30MB 
by leaving out Opera and Abiword, which did not exist then.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to everyone on the TAG list for all the help and education.
</p>

&gt; Hey guys:
&gt; 
&gt; I currently have a Toshiba Protégé M200 and I would love to play
&gt; around with a Linux LiveCD distro.  This machine does not have an
&gt; internal floppy and or CD/DVD drive, however, it does have the
&gt; capability to boot off the internal SD slot by copying a floppy-disk
&gt; image (up to 2.88MB) to the SD card as long as you name it
&gt; $tosfd00.vfd.
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you are thinking, but it'll never work...  Think of it
&gt; this way, you can have a 2GB SD card but only 1.44 or 2.88MB worth of
&gt; that 2GB is usable, the rest of the space cannot be read under Linux.
&gt; To enable the ability to read the remaining space of the SD card, a
&gt; driver must be present for the Toshiba SD card reader under Linux.
&gt; The reason it'll never work is because Toshiba won't release
&gt; information regarding the device, therefore no driver.
&gt; 
&gt; This brings me back to my original problem of getting a LiveCD to run
&gt; on my M200.  I just happened to stumbled upon Ben Okopnik "Booting Knoppix
&gt; from a USB Pendrive via Floppy" article and I thought to myself "that
&gt; might be exactly what need."  I read his entire article, but I am
&gt; still confused and don't know where to start.
&gt; 
&gt; I saw the downloadable file version of the script, but what do I do
&gt; with it. Keep in mind I don't have a Linux machine or any prior Linux
&gt; experience.
</pre>

<p>
Hi, Jermaine -
</p>

<p>
Well, that last bit is somewhat problematic - unless you can beg,
borrow, or steal a Linux machine for a while, or have a friend with one
who would be interested in helping you. Or, if you have access to a
desktop machine (i.e., something which isn't going to give you the kind
of problems that your Toshiba does), you could always boot Knoppix or
some other distro on it and get yourself all set up.
</p>

<p>
The procedure itself, once you've taken care of the above, is fairly
simple:
</p>

<p>
1) Download a Knoppix image [1] to your machine.
2) Download and run the script in the article; follow the prompts.
3) Copy the newly-created image to your flash device, as the last prompt
	says; however, in your case, try 
</p>

<pre>
dd if=boot.img of=/dev/sdb1/\$tosfd00.vfd
</pre>
instead of the suggested location (this assumes that your flash drive is
mounted as /dev/sdb, which is the common case.)
</p>

<p>
If the above doesn't work, feel free to ping TAG again - hopefully, with
a list of all errors that you've seen (pasted and copied, please - no
retyping!) and describing any non-text errors (i.e., "activity light on
drive didn't come on" or whatever.)
</p>

<p>
I suspect that it should work out OK for you, since the problem these
days is that the boot image is too big for the average floppy. However,
since you have a 2.88MB allowance, this is likely to not be a problem...
</p>

<p>
Let us know how it works out for you!
</p>

I have setup IPCop and am seeing that I am taking errors (at about a  
50% rate) any Idea how I can adjust the MTU rat which is currently  
set to 1500?

Hi, Emil!
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I'm way behind on reading LG, so I saw your question from April only 
&gt; today:
&gt; 
&gt;   <a href="../138/misc/lg/multipage_tif_file.html">http://linuxgazette.net/138/misc/lg/multipage_tif_file.html</a>
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; It reminded me of a scanning/archiving assignment I got long time ago.  
&gt; I don't remember when but I mailed LG about it before.
&gt; 
&gt; I wanted to merge to separate TIFF pages (extracted from a 30+ page 
&gt; scans using tiffsplit) into one PDF.  It went like this:
</pre>

<p>
tiffsplit?
</p>

<p>
Well, I just went off to install libtiff-tools, and tested tiffsplit on
the file I'd been trying to open back then. No go, still.
</p>

<pre>
TIFFReadDirectory: Warning, 552.tif: unknown field with tag 292 (0x124) encountered.
552.tif: Warning, incorrect count for field "DateTime" (19, expecting 20); tag ignored.
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre>
Looks like the original file was, as I thought at the time,
exquisitely..."modified" to be "functional" in Wind0ws and borken
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Ah well, thanks to that problem, I've acquired a suite of tiff tools.
(Thank you for the nudge to add libtiff-tools to the arsenal.)
</p>



<pre>
&gt;  tiffcp xaa.tif xab.tif combined.tiff
&gt;  tiff2ps -2 -a combined.tiff | ps2pdf -sPAPERSIZE=a4 - &gt; combined.pdf
&gt; 
&gt; You'll get a high quality PDF that is much smaller than the TIFFs.
</pre>

<p>
Nifty. It's pretty much the inverse (converse? reverse? obverse?) of the
problem I was having, but it's nice to have the tip handy. Thanks!
