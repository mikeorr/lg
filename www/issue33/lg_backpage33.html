<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Larry Ayers</H4>
Larry lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Randolph Bentson</H4>
Randolph's first UNIX experience was booting a BSD VAX system on
July 3, 1981--the whole town had a celebration the next day.
He began contributing to the Linux kernel in May 1994, and his book
<i>Inside Linux: A Look at Operating System Development</i> describes
how many modern operating system features have evolved and become essential
parts of Linux.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Ken O. Burtch</H4>
Ken has been using Linux since kernel 0.97. During
the early 1990's he wrote software for the Apple IIgs computer, including
Pegasus Pascal (an Ada-Turing hybrid language) and the award winning shareware
game "Quest for the Hoard". His hobbies include reading and writing fantasy
literature and collecting cartoons. He is currently the president of PegaSoft
Canada, a Linux development company based in southern Ontario. He can be
reached via the PegaSoft web site at <A HREF="http://www.vaxxine.com/pegasoft">http://www.vaxxine.com/pegasoft</A>.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Jurgen Defurne</H4>
Jason is an Analyst/programmer in financial company (Y2K and 
Euro).
He became interested in microprocessors 18 years ago, when my eyes saw 
the TRS-80 in the 
Tandy (Radio Shack) catalog.
I read all I could find about microprocessors, which was 
then mostly confined to 8080/8088/Z80. The only thing he could do back 
then was write 
programs in assembler without even having a computer.
When he was 18, he gathered enough money to buy his first computer, 
the Sinclair ZX 
Spectrum. He studied electronics and learned programming mostly
on his own. He worked with 
several languages (C, C++, xBase/Clipper, Cobol, FORTH) and several 
different systems in 
different areas: programming of test equipment, single- and 
multi-user databases in 
quality control and customer support, and PLCs in an aluminium 
foundry/milling factory.

<P>

Peter Norton Group</A>, and 
<A href="http://www.mcafee.com"> McAfee Associates</A> -- as well as

He's been using Linux since version 0.99p10 and is an active
participant on an ever-changing list of mailing lists and 
newsgroups.  He's just started collaborating on the 2nd Edition
for a book on Unix systems administration.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">David Nelson</H4>
David manages scientific research at the U.S. Department

He started programming on the IBM 650 using absolute machine language and
later graduated to CDC, DEC and Cray machines for his research. But Linux
is the most fun. He and his wife, Kathy, enjoy tennis, skiing, sailing,
music, theater, and good food.

His wife, Diane, is certainly his best friend and biggest fan. He enjoys his 
two Schnauzers, Brutus and Cleo, and his dozens of African Ciclids, too. He 
is a licensed amateur radio operator, as is Diane, and they spend more than 
a few nights together observing the skies through their 5-inch telescope. 
They like to get out and stay active, to enjoy life together.

Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites. And of course, thanks to Ellen Dahl for her help with
News Bytes.

About a month ago, my doctor diagnosed me as having diabetes. Since then, I
have found I am becoming quite self-absorbed. I've had to go back to
always thinking about what I am going to eat and when--a habit I had
given up years ago. For a time, I've decided to become essentially vegan
(though not fanatic about it--I ate one piece of bacon this morning). I'm
quite amazed at the difference giving up meat and dairy products has made
in my energy level. Of course, getting my blood sugar down has certainly
been the best help in that area. At any rate, I'm feeling better than I
have in at least 6 months if not longer, and that's good!
<P>
I will be going to San Diego this weekend to visit my grandchildren there.
Haven't seen them in quite a while, so I am looking forward to it.
<P> 
Have fun!
