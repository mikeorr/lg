<p class="editorial">
 Ben's response to this question was published as
<a href="../../../131/lg_tips.html#2-cent-tips.05">http://linuxgazette.net/131/lg_tips.html#2-cent-tips.05</a> --Kat 
</p>

Does anyone know of an app/script that will automagically set ID3 tags
in my MP3s files using freedb?
</p>

<p>
I got one of those pod thingies that are so popular with the kids these
days and discovered that quite a few of my MP3s don't have ID3 tags on
them.  I have no idea how that happened since I've ripped every CD with
grip (which means my MP3s directory hierarchy follow the standard format
of artist/album/song.mp3). 
</p>

<p>
Googling "mass edit mp3s" brings up mostly Windows apps. I gather most
of those will let me makes changes to ID3 tags across a group of MP3s
(say changing "Bush, Kate" to "Kate Bush" en masse) as opposed to what I
want (look up the info on freedb and apply that info to the MP3s).
</p>

<p>
I did come across something on IBM Developer Works that uses a couple of
Perl modules (we now have Ben's attention!) and freedb but I couldn't
get it to work properly, meaning a) I couldn't understand the docs and
b) I couldn't redirect the output to a file to see wtf it was doing.
</p>

<p>
Since I don't want to rip and encode all of those CDs again, I'll
happily roll my own, but I thought I'd check with you guys to see if
I've missed an existing solution.

<p>
easytag will do that.  It also has a feature called "Auto tagging" - it 
parses filename and directory to complete automatically the fields 
(using masks).

<p>
You're right, it does.  It only took me an hour to figure out how to make it
work.  The freedb stuff isn't working but at least I'm getting some tags
done.
</p>

<p>
I'd love to RTFM but as far as I can tell, there is no FM.
