<h2>Not Linux</h2>

I asked Quinn what NI was, and he said it's a country.  I said, "What's
the United Kingdom then?"  He said, "It's a state."  "But isn't a state
the same thing as a country?"  He said, "No."  AFAICT, by state he meant
a unit that has a seat at the UN and a foreign policy.  I always thought
that was a country, but on the other hand ppl say there's "four countries
in Spain".

"The state as a person of international law should possess the following 
qualifications: (a) a permanent population; (b) a defined territory; (c) 
government; and (d) capacity to enter into relations with the other 
states." (From Article 1 of the Montevideo Convention)

<p>
The terms country, nation, state and land are often used as synonyms, 
but in a more strict usage they are distinguished:

<ul>
<li> country is the geographical area</li>
<li> nation designates a people</li>
<li> state is about government, and an entity in international law</li>
<li> land may be used for "a country and its people" but also thought 
of as country belonging to a nation or a monarch</li>
</ul>
<p>
The term nation state, while often used interchangeably with the term 
state, refers more properly to a state in which a single nation is dominant.

There's a fascinating book called _The Nine Nations of North America_ by
Joel Garreaui (1981).  He was (or is) a French-Canadian working at the
Washington Post.  He sent reporters out and was puzzled at how different
the attitudes are in different areas, and they didn't follow state or
national boundaries.  Finally he plotted it out.  It's a little dated
coz things have changed since 1981, but it's still mostly accurate.
It's hard to describe without a map, but:

<ol>
<li> NEW ENGLAND -- New England and the Maritime provinces.  Capital: Boston.
   Do-it-yourself attitude, values social justice and public infrastructure
   (e.g., public transportation, parks, plazas), traditional morals, not
   flashy with wealth.  Has already lost it economically and
   population-wise, so there's nothing more to lose.</li>

<li> QUEBEC -- Quebec.  Capital: Montreal.  Je me souviens.</li>

<li> THE RUST BELT -- The northeast industrial states.  I don't remember his
name for it.  Capital: Detroit? Philadelphia?  Unions and steel.</li>

<li> DIXIE -- The South, including part of Texas and maybe northern Florida.
   Capital: Atlanta.  Stars and Bars.  Public spending only on roads and
   schools, and sometimes the schools don't get much.</li>

<li> THE ISLANDS -- Miami and southern Florida, plus the Caribbean countries.
Money is king.</li>

<li> THE BREADBASKET -- The eastern Midwest, including a second part of Texas,
   and Manitoba (and Saskatchewan?).  Capital: Chicago.  Wheat and agriculture
   rule.</li>

<li> MEX-AMERICA -- The Southwest, plus the portion of Mexico in reach of US
   radio stations.  Capital: Los Angeles.  Man can't live without air
   conditioning, so nature is the enemy.  Viva the man-made world.</li>

<li> ECOTOPIA -- Western Washington and Oregon to the Cascade mountains, 
   northwest California to the Tegucigalpa mountains (between SF and LA),
   coastal British Columbia, and the Alaska panhandle through Juneau and
   Sitka to Homer.  Capital: San Francisco.  Temperatures are moderate so
   nature is our friend.  Recycling is good (again, nature is our friend).
   "If you live in Oregon and the roof breaks on your geodesic dome, you
   merely get cold.  If you live in Minnesota and the roof breaks on your
   geodesic dome, you die."  Everybody hates Los Angeles, the symbol of
   wasteful excess and the anti-nature attitude.  (You couldn't have more
   than 50,000 ppl in LA without irrigation and air conditioning.)  Oh, and
   building a nuclear plant on an earthquake fault was a very bad idea.
   Fortunately the Tegucigalpa mountains firmly stop the spread of Los
   Angeles sprawl/ooze.  Ecotopia was settled by New Englanders, so the
   attitudes are similar.</li>

<li> THE EMPTY QUARTER -- Eastern Washington and Oregon, Idaho, Montana,
   Alberta, south to the desert, and east into the Midwest.  Basically,
   "west of the line where federal control of land becomes overwhelming".
   Capital: Denver.  Mineral extraction will make us stinking rich, so who
   cares about the environment?  It may not happen this year, but it 
   definitely will happen.  The main reason it's empty is lack of water.
   Outsiders see it as a "pristene", "untouched" area so try to preserve
   it through wilderness trusts, because it's part of the American psyche,
   like Siberia in Russia.  </li>
</ol>
   
<P>ABERRATIONS:
<ol type="A">
<li>New York City (Manhattan) -- It's so big and diverse and wacky,
       nothing can describe it.  But Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx
       firmly belong to the rust belt.</li>

<li>  Washington DC -- It's so overwhelmed by lobbyists from other places
       that it doesn't fit either.</li>

<li>  Alaska -- A three-way war between the oil companies (Empty Quarter),
       the environmentalists (Ecotopia) and the natives, who infuriate the
       environmentalists by siding with the oil companies when it means
       they'll be rich, contradicting the environmentalists' stereotype of
       "gentle on the Earth" Indians.  It's too early to say which side
       will win.  Garreau points out that few Alaskans were born there and
       even fewer will die there, and takes a jab at "people living where
       tomatoes won't".</li>
</ol>
       
<p>BORDER TOWNS AND BORDER SKIRMISHES:
<ol type="A">
<li>Texas is split between Dixie, The Breadbasket and Mex-America.</li>

<li>  New England begins somewhere near New Haven, Conneticut, where
Red Sox fans (New England) begin to outnumber Giants fans (Rust Belt).</li>

<li>  National boundaries are a nuisance, especially in Ecotopia.
       (Although Sept 11 has brought back a national consciousness, as
       well as quelling any talk of Washington/Oregon/BC secession from
       the US and Canada.  Although if Quebec goes....)</li>

<li>  Sacramento is on the border between Ecotopia and Mex-America,
       trying to balance northern California and southern California
       values.</li>

<li>  The Empty Quarter border goes through states.  It's too bad the
       state boundaries weren't drawn with this in mind.  In Washington
       where I live, there's a huge difference between the environmentalists
       in western Washington and the farmers in eastern Washington.
       The Idaho panhandle exists as a compromise between the power-hungry
       state governments.  Olympia (Washington's capital) wanted Walla
       Walla (in southeast Washington) because it was an important
       railroad junction and center.  (Now it's a nothing town, with
       onion farms, three colleges and a prison.)  But Olympia didn't
       want the Kootenai mines (in north Idaho) because the mineral
       wealth created a power center that would dilute Olympia's
       authority.  Now Kootenai (Coeur d'Alene) is nothing, just a small
       town and a big lake.  Logically, Washington should have been much
       smaller and stopped at the Cascades.  Then there would be no
       tension between western and eastern Washington.  But Olympia had
       to have Walla Walla....</li>
</ol>

by these guidelines, the method is rather effective. (Mike, does this
bring "Voyage From Yesteryear" to mind again?)

</p><p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Yes, LG is mostly a consensus-based anarchy, with a few ppl taking certain 
vital roles by virtue of their ability to fill the roles well (meritocracy).

</p><p>
_Voyage From Yesteryear_ by James Hogan.  Science fiction.  Highly
recommended reading.
 
</p><p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Recommendation strongly seconded. It's one of the very few books on my
'read over and over' list.
 
</p><p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Ssshhh, Ben, don't let them think we agree on anything.

I've tried to make up lost time as an adult, but had to have my wife
Deirdre[1] explain to me Ulster's key problem:  Its millions of
impoverished Catholics are largely stuck on the dole, and have been for
generations.  Thus, even if all the Ian Paisleys of the world were to
suddenly join Sinn Féin and vote for reunification, the Dublin
government simply wouldn't be able to foot the bill.  Which is why
republican institutions still advocate the 32-county cause in theory but
not in practice.

</P><P>
[1] Who was given a hard time when visiting the Six Counties, because
the name on her passport was "Deirdre Saoirse".  (Everyone but Jimmy can
read the explanation at <a href="http://www.irlnet.com/saoirse/introintro.html">http://www.irlnet.com/saoirse/introintro.html</a> .)

<rolling eyes> Oh, *man*. I hope she didn't innocently tie her hair back
with a green ribbon.

Back in the '70s and '80s in L.A., you simply _did_ _not_ have a red or
blue bandanna showing unless you were suicidal. The Crips, or the
Bloods, or Rx-13 would shoot you down in cold blood - for either being
the enemy or "pretending" to be a member. A couple of immigrant kids got
shot or stabbed that way.

</P><P>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
The Irish word "Saoirse" is pronounced SEER-sheh (short 'e' sound in the 
second syllable, I won't try to explain the first but the long 'e' sound 
is close enough). The American name "Caitlin" (Kate-lynn) is an Irish 
word, but it's pronounced Katleen. That one's causing confusion, 
especially since some Irish people (who don't speak the language) are 
using the American pronunciation/spelling.

</P><P>
Actually, come to think of it, in some places the long 'e' is pronounced 
as a long 'a'; Ronald Reagan may or may not come from the same O'Regan 
branch as I do.

Hi,

<p>
I have installed LINUX 7.3 in my LINUX Server; I can't start the FTP
server in my LINUX BOX. My LINUX server IP is 203.293.130.115 but when I
put this IP along with ftp command (ftp://203.193.130.115), it can show
its default folders. I can't write or create any directory in this
folder. So how do I create the FTP Server in my LINUX Box and what will
be the correct steps for this service.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
This is the second time this month we have had this question. I'm guessing
your homework assignments are tough for you, yes?

<p>Sigh. Look here:

<p><a href="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/kb.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/kb.html</a>
 
<p>That's a link to all relevant topics from past issues. Go read.

<p>
<strong>[Pranay]</strong>
Will I access this site from any window machine in my LAN environment?
If I do so, how do I do? Will have to change any configuration files in
my LINUX server?

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Probably.

<p>
<strong>[Pranay]</strong>
Can anyone help me in these regards? Please, provide me all shorts of
information regarding this FTP server creation process in LINUX server.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
No. At least the way you've phrased it suggests a homework assignment.

No, not at all.  The reason I occasionally post spam is to collect
comments that may appear on the Back Page in a future issue.

I know - but I thought there was a whole book of unwritten rules on who was
allowed to make up the responses to the spam. In the back issues of LG, I've
noticed that the responses sometimes follow a certain pattern; I was afraid
that I had done something wrong.

</P><P>
<STRONG>[Mike]</STRONG>
Is there a pattern?  What pattern?  The only pattern is whatever I think
sounds funny.  I prob'ly have a bias toward ppl I know better, but that

You are welcome to correct my grammar but I *desperately* encourage
you to read my entire paragraph before attempting it;  my thought
patterns are occasionally convoluted and/or filled with multiple
meanings as written, an effect which would surely be affected by
rewriting them, although possibly improved....

<P>
<STRONG>[Rick]</STRONG>
If I ever dare to touch a sentence where there's any possibility of
ambiguity, then I suck as a copyeditor and should be flogged
immediately.  Metaphorically, at least.  

<P>
If it's too incoherent to figure out precisely what the writer meant,
coming in, then it needs to stay that way in print.

<P>
If I ruin a joke or reference by "correcting" a passage, then I need to
be flogged first and then shot through the head.  Take care not to
reverse the order; the effect is greatly diminished.

<P>
If you don't see your own style and hear your own voice after I fix the
nits, and indeed don't have to look _extra_ hard to even see what I've
done, then I suck in multitudinous ways, and should be flogged
immediately.

Should we just shoot you now, and then sell you?

If it was "always", they wouldn't have survived their first week

German magazine c't had an article, in their December 1st, 2003 issue,
in which they describe experiences with the service of all the bigger

While the article concludes not all service departments stink, one piece
of statistics is quite telling:

When asked if they would buy the same brand laptop, next time, only
among the owners of Apple (83%), IBM (79%) and Toshiba (55%) laptops,
the majority vote was "yes". (The choices, btw, were: "yes", "no", and
