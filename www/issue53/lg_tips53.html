<P> This configuration may not be immediately obvious to the unseasoned

Furthermore, the information does not seem readily available (at
least I had trouble finding it).

<P> To enable the mouse wheel, place the following line in XF86Config
under the pointer section

<PRE>
ZAxisMapping 4 5

<P> This will allow emacs, xterm, ... to receive mouse wheel events. For
netscape, also add the following lines to .Xdefaults (be sure there
is only a newline after the "\" that ends a line.

<P> Hello,
For those who are changing HDDs very often, here is small ugly
 but working utility which I wrote.
It detects filesystem types of all accessible partitions and
checks/mounts them in folders named after device (hda7,hdb1,hdb3,sd1,...).

<P> So you will never have to write sequences of fdisk,fsck,mount,df...

<P> Hi

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> I would really like to see case studies on switching to Linux form other platforms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Recently there was an article in LG, about a big polish hotel which
did that and pretty happy about it. Check it out.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> We currently use Windows NT Terminal Server Edition. How hard would it be to go to Linux?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You'll have to learn a little. On NT you click several times, use some
wizards, reboot from time to time and everyhitng it's fine. If
it isn't, reinstall and it will be.
Using Linux means you also know what you are doing. You'll click
more times, even use the keyboard :), ask on irc/mail list/news about
something which you can't figure out etc. But you'll have a 
strong, performant, secure platform. 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> - We have two TSE servers with approximately 30 users each logged in on average. In total, we have about 130 users but
	it is a manufacturing plant and many people share terminals. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
sounds to me like a perfect case for Linux :)

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> - We use Citrix Metaframe, for Load Balancing and failover. Is there a product for Linux that offers this option? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Ah ! The Windows world, with lots of _great_ products, which improve
performance of your system, maintain it etc etc.

<P> You don't need these on Linux, because it does it by itself.
With under 200 users, I don't think you'll need more than one server.
Sure, that server won't be a Pentium PC. I'm not into hardware,
can't say too much here, but there are many options.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> - Dependability. I have to reboot my TSE servers once a week. Last week a new HP printer driver caused about 40 blue
	screens of death before we figured out what was going on. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I've heard that on Windows 2000 presentation by Bill Gates, he outlined
that there were machines running for even 90 days without a reset.
WOW ! ( not to mention the _new_ micro$oft _invention_, the
symbolic link )

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Will Linux be better? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
You bet. See more articles about introduction to Linux etc.
Once you start using it, you'll love it. Try and see ;)

<P> Recently we installed ( at <A HREF="http://www.lug.ro">www.lug.ro</A> ) php, postgresql, configured
the web server (apache) without rebooting and remotely. 
And no wizards, just the shell, from an old university
text terminal. It took about 15 minutes untill I had it running. 
I'd say that's cool, isn't it ?

<P> About the uptime, here's the output of the uptime command on a
sever here in ROmania :

<PRE>
avva:~$ uptime
 10:22am up 435 days, 17:27, 7 users, load average: 1.16, 1.10, 1.02
avva:~$
</PRE>

<P> That ain't much, check 
<A HREF="http://www.uptimes.net">www.uptimes.net</A> for better results

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> - Office productivity software. If we are used to MS Office, what will it be like going to something like star-office? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Better :) I use it from time to time to make some charts, short
paper works etc. If you're really into publishing, LaTeX is the
answer. And don't forget about the free great database engine,
PostgreSQL. (you don't keep data in an Excel sheet, don't you ?)
How about a web/desktop interface for it ? No problem !

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> - Anti-virus programs? Is there an antivirus program to scan mail stores (sendmail POP server)? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
If you use Linux and no windows at all, you won't need that. 
Besides being harder to infect a Linux system because of file perimisions
and ownership, there's a problem with anti-viruses. The viruses must
appear first, and _later_ the anti-viruses. I can't afford to wait
that delta t, both at home and at work, so I use Tripwire, an 'utility'
which scans your filesystem and based on the rules you define, makes
a database of their CRCs or something like that. If a file get's modified
you are notified acording to the rules. There's a free version of it and
a better commercial one. (see their website for more info). I use it as
an antivirus, but it's for network security.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> -Security. How good is Linux at keeping users honest? With TSE you can delete or overwrite files in the system
	directories as a user. Can't delete a system file? 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Linux is Unix-like, which was designed from ground up for network, multi-user,
multitasking etc. So it's extremly good at it. On my PC at home, I made
more accounts for my relatives (they didn't know how to use a computer
initially), and I can happily leave them alone. Besides the graphical
interface being in my native language (and I'm proud I contribute to that)
in the worst case they can delete their personal files. They don't have the
rights for the rest :), not even each other's.
You can also make groups for different departments. Each user will have
his/her own account, which could be part of one/more departments.

<P> As I said, once you get to know Linux better, you'll delete even your
windows backups :)
You can always find help in the Linux community (but make sure you
Read Those Fine Manuals first), or even pay for commercial support.

<P> See ya around !

<BR>From: Gordon Haverland &lt;<A HREF="mailto:ghaverla@freenet.edmonton.ab.ca">ghaverla@freenet.edmonton.ab.ca</A>&gt;

<P> Another place to look for speed improvements is
custom math libraries.  A lot of FORTRAN is concerned
with linear algebra, and for  speeding up things like
LAPACK the place to start is probably getting some kind
of BLAS.  There does exist a couple of had tuned
BLAS for some Intel-386 family processors running
Linux, but what looks like the best place to get
going is something called ATLAS.  This is a package
which tries to calculate an optimal BLAS Level 1, 2
and 3 library for your machine.  It comes pretty
close to hand tuned BLAS in assembler, and can work
from C or FORTRAN calling.

ANSWER: <FONT COLOR="navy">Memory greater than 64MB
</FONT> </H3>
Mon, 10 Apr 2000 17:43:53 -0500
<BR>From: bjones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:wljones@hex.net">wljones@hex.net</A>&gt;

<P> I used the "free" command on both of my computers, and found that they
were using only 64 MB of memory in Linux.  I had to use the "append"
addition in LILO to get Linux to see all of it.  It appears to be a bios
problem, and I like this simple solution.  As an aside, I never noticed
a shortage of available memory problem before the fix.  Linux worked
quite well with 64 MB and a 64 MB swap partition.  The swap partition
was never used, to my knowledge, but the manuals threatened death, doom,
and destruction if I omitted it.

<P> A quick note:  The memory used by the on-board video with the AMD K6-2
processor cannot be used by Linux.  I have 160 MB of memory on that
computer.  Attempting to use all of it caused a kernel panic at boot
time.  I use 8 MB for graphics.  Changing the append statement to use
152 MB worked.  I am sure happy about saving that boot floppy.

<H2>Your Editor wrote:</H2>

<P> I used to have to use the 'append "mem=8M"' statement, but now I don't
have to.  Which kernel are you using?  It may have been something that
changed in the 2.2 kernels.

<H2>William replied:</H2>

<P> Two computers in use:
 (1) 300 MHz K6-2, 160MB memory, S.u.S.E. 6.1, upgraded to 6.3 with a
giveaway CD-ROM, 1999 Bios that switches to an Adaptec 1520 Bios during
boot. 
(2) 100MHZ Pentium, 96 MB memory, Sam's version of Red Hat 6.0, 1996
Bios that switches to an Adaptec 2940 bios during boot.

<P> I like my computers, and am not concerned about needing an extra tweak
to reach all the memory.  Both machines are Lilo dual boot to Linux and
M$.  They are (ab)used frequently, inside and out.  Additional operating
systems that are now on a bookshelf include OS/2, MS-DOS since 1.0, and
Coherent 2 through 4.  I will probably upgrade Someday Soon, and look
forward to having "free" see all of my memory without an "append" line
in Lilo.



<H2>Your patient Editor asked:</H2>
	
<P> Which kernel is it though?  "uname -a" will tell you.


<H2>William responded:</H2>

<P> 1. K62, 2.2.13 #1 kernel ( remember, this updates S.u.S.E. 6.1, with a
lower 2.2 kernel)

<P> 2. 586, 2.2.5-13 kernel




<H2>Rick Smith &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rsmith13@tampabay.rr.com">rsmith13@tampabay.rr.com</A>&gt; confessed:</H2>

<P> Sir,

<P> After chastising Linux Gazette about not needing to put an: append "mem=xxM" statement in lilo.conf, it had to happen! I have been using
socket seven motherboards for several years and all currently have
128meg. They all run various versions of Linux: Redhat 5.2, Mandrake 6.1
and Suse 6.3.  I have not had to put an append statement in lilo.conf or
use a mem= at the Lilo prompt to get all 128meg recognized.  

<P> That is until now! I just bought a FIC SD-11 motherboard, Athlon 700 and
a new case. I took all the components: memory, drives, nic, video card,
from one of my socket seven systems and installed them in my new Athlon
system. (Please note: same drive with Suse 6.3 already installed.)
Everything seem fine until I ran: free and discovered I only had 64meg
of memory! So now, I had to put an append statement in lilo.conf to get
all 128meg recognized.  It's definitely a "bios thing".

<P> BTW:  When I upgrade a motherboard, I NEVER need to reinstall Linux but
almost always need to reinstall Win 9x.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have a question about connectivity with/via Linux.  I need to pull a
	load of stuff of the Psion, and this is done by getting the files
	converted to tab-separated values by some utilities I've got.  I have
	read and (I think) understood how to access a palm database from a
	program running on it, but there's not a lot of stuff on how to get a
	file full of TSVs onto the Palm.  I've read the connectivity howto, and
	I also understand how to upload a palm database, but its the format
	conversion between plain text and palm database which looks hard to me.
	There's no obvious tool to do it, and I can't see how in the docs or
	this book I bought.  Maybe it will become obvious when I unpack the dev
	tools?

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Nah, this is a traditional DB/Spreadsheet conversion issue.  You need to go
from TSV's to CSV's (comma seperated values).  The pilot-link software can
upload some items as long as they are in CSV's.  Getting from TSV's to
CSV's is the hard part.  If you're moderately good at regular expression
handling, you could probably whip up a perl script to do it.  The CSV's
have commas between fields and any fields that have embedded commas are
enclosed in double quotes.  I think you can actually get away with using
double quotes around all fields, but I'm not sure about that.  I only did
enough work with them to get xnotes working properly (and I use the term
"properly" very loosely here).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> I'm intending to use gcc to make port over a psion app, Vorg
	http://www.polonius.demon.co.uk/Nick/Psion/software.html  (this page
	disappears soon when I change ISP).  I'm also wanting to put a CD
	database on the Palm Pilot which has a strange and complex structure, so
	I'll be writing a application to support that.  I've already bagged the
	gcc port and XCoPilot; I was wondering what else you would recommend?

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> To be honest, I don't write apps for the Pilot.  It was something I wanted
to do, but there just wasn't enough time in the day to get seriously
involved in it.  One has to pick certain specialties in todays world - mine
turned out to be graphics.  Ah well.  Maybe someday.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Thanks a lot for your help, however short.  Even "look at the xnotesplus
	source here" would be a help.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> Ick - the xnotes source probably wouldn't help much.  It's just an ugly
wrapper around pilot-link tools (yep, a bunch of execv's and the like).
But I think if you can write your parser to go from TSV's to CSV's you'll
be on your way.

	I've successfully downloaded and install pilot-link-0.9.0-8.
	I didn't find much documentation.  I'm having trouble communicating w/
	my palm.
	
	I have both a serial cradle and a USB cradle, and I can't get either one
	to work.
	
	I'm using RedHat 6.1 on a P-II/333 machine.
	
	Do you know of a good resource for connecting to my PC?

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P> There is a fair amount online.  I know I wrote an article for Linux Journal
a year or two back about how to connect use the pilot-link software with
your Pilot's serial cradle.  Search the Linux Journal site
(www.linuxjournal.com) - I know it's online there somewhere.  I think they
had another article on the same subject earlier this year or maybe late
last year.

<P> I can't speak for the USB cradle, since I've never tried one of those, but
the serial cable is pretty straight forward.  First make sure you know
which serial port you're connecting to.  Then set a couple of environment
variables from the command line:

<PRE>
% export PILOTPORT=/dev/ttyS0
% export PILOTRATEW600
</PRE>

<P> The first one tells the pilot-link software what serial port to use.  The
second tells it what speed to transfer data at.  I think you can set this
to a higher baud rate.  I just happen to use this one because I know it
works for me.

<P> Now you can just run the pilot link commands:

<PRE>
% pilot-xfer -b /tmp/pilot-backup
</PRE>

<P> That would backup your pilot to a directory called "/tmp/pilot-backup".  I
can't remember if it will create the directory for you, so you're better off
making the directory yourself before hand.
