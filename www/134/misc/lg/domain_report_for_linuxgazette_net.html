Just so you know, <em>this</em> few nits for a domain is utterly outstanding.

Subject: Domain report for linuxgazette.net
</pre> 
Greetings.  You are getting this form-mail because someone arranged for me
to have my NS1.LINUXMAFIA.COM nameserver (IP = 198.144.195.186) do 
 
[ ] master
[x] slave 
 
DNS for the domain linuxgazette.net
 
...and you are either the domain owner, or the sysadmin of the SOA master
server, or both.
 
I periodically check such domains for troubles.  Following are ones observed 
a/o today with the domain.  YOU, not I, need to fix these, to make the
domain work properly. 
 
Problems that have cropped up for other domains, but not this one, have
been sorted to the bottom but still included in case you're interested.
  
  
[x] The "www" record for your domain is a CNAME.  This is legal, but
very suboptimal, because it entails two lookups (like an unnecessary 
symlink on a filesystem, except with a more-significant performance hit).
I recommend replacing it with an "A" record pointing directly to the 
IP in question.
 
[x] Risk of single point of failure in whois contacts.  You have 
just a single person (name, e-mail address, telephone number) 
listed in the domain's whois records for all contacts.  While this is
perfectly legal, and you might have compelling reasons for it, consider
repointing at least one of the contacts to someone else, so that someone
can be reached if you can't.

[x] Risk of in-band communication limitation in whois contacts.  All 
of the e-mail contacts for the domain record are in-domain.  Are people
going to be able to send you mail saying "Dude, I think your domain's
mail service is broken"?  Consider having at least one contact be
out-of-domain, if only at a webmail service that's normally forwarded to
the domain's MTAs.
 
 
[ ] Lame nameserver.  This nameserver doesn't believe itself to be 
authoritative for the domain.
 
[ ] Security risk (cache poisoning risk).  These nameservers are open to 
recursive queries from the global Internet, which is a very bad idea because
it permits poisoning of your cached authoritative DNS data.  I strongly 
recommend that those sites' admins follow this page's tips to close the
hole, or that you find replacement nameservers.  
<a href="http://www.dnsreport.com/info/opendns.htm">http://www.dnsreport.com/info/opendns.htm</a>
 
[ ] Fewer than recommended nameservers.  RFC2182 section 5 recommends 
between 3 and 7 nameservers.  You have:
 
[ ] Your contact information in the domain record doesn't reach you
(or no longer does, at any rate).  I'm referring to the listed:
   [ ] telephone number
   [ ] e-mail address
 
[ ] Missing glue records.  (This is an extremely common problem, and
leading source of pokey DNS performance.)  You are using hostnames in your
NS records that are out of your parent zone's "bailiwick", e.g., using
.COM nameserver hostnames to serve a .ORG domain (or vice-versa) with
the result that parent-zone responses to queries asking for your NS
records <em>cannot</em> include the IP addresses that match those NS records.
(Why?  Because, to use the example above, the .ORG zone's nameservers
are not allowed to speak authoritatively on the resolution of .COM 
hostnames:  That portion of the query must be fetched separately from
the .COM zone's separate nameservers -- thus, requiring two queries to 
find the domain's nameservers, rather than one.
 
To fix this problem, you need merely refer to those same
out-of-bailiwick nameservers' IP addresses by alternate names you create 
within the domain, <em>and</em> define those names in "A" records in the
domain's zonefile.  Note that you must, as always, refer to the
nameservers in the same way in both the domain record (at the
registrar) and in the master nameserver's zonefile.
 
[ ] SOA hostname error.  The hostname listed as master server in your
zonefile SOA reference record is not among those listed in NS reference 
records in the parent zone (the list of authoritative servers).
 
[ ] SOA e-mail address is wrong.  The e-mail address shown in the SOA
record (with the "@" symbol transformed into a period) really does need
to be deliverable, and yours is not.
 
[ ] Unresponsive nameserver.   This nameserver doesn't respond to queries
for the domain's NS records.
 
[ ] SOA expire time is a bit low.  RFC1912 suggests 2-4 weeks (1209600 to
2419200) under normal circumstances.  You have:
 
[ ] MX record points to an IP with no valid DNS reverse.  RFC1912 section
2.1 says you need ("should" have) a valid reverse, and many mail servers
will refuse your mail on this basis.
 
[ ] MX machine is unreachable.
