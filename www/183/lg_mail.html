<h3>Looking for a Shuttle replacement</h3>

<p>
Hi all,
</p>

<p>
[This might help drum up conversation here, if nothing else, but I
appreciate it's not really Linux-centric.]
</p>

<p>
Some of you might recall some years ago the following:
</p>

<p>
<a href='../141/misc/lg/shuttle_sd39p2__should_i_buy_one.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/141/misc/lg/shuttle_sd39p2__should_i_buy_one.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, said machine literally went up in white smoke just before
Christmas.  From what I can tell, an integrated circuit on the motherboard
blew, as the PSU is still intact, according to my volt metre, as are the
harddrives, etc.  The point is, it's something esoteric, and not the usual
suspects I would expect to have blown, else I could have replaced those
parts.
</p>

<p>
However, because it's a Shuttle, replacing the motherboard outright is not
an option either, as it's an integrated system due to its cooling fans, etc.
Not to mention the apparent cost of doing so amounts to an equivalent cost
of the Shuttle overall.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  Buying a new machine therefore seems logical.
</p>

<p>
So, would anyone be able to help me in replacing my Shuttle with a modern
equivalent?  When I say equivalent, I mean:
</p>

<p>
* Must be of a similar size to the Shuttle (form-factor).  If this implies
  mini-itx, that's fine.
* Should be as low-powered as possible -- i.e., not consuming the planet.
  Think green.
* Would need space for at least two hard drives minimum.
* Minimum of two PCI slots (one of which must be an PCI-e slot.)
* Support for dual-head graphics a must.
* On-board wireless would be nice (without the need for an additional card)
</p>

<p>
I appreciate some of the above might not necessarily fit any one system, and
I'd be willing to sacrifice on-board wireless for one of the PCI slots (as
my Shuttle only had two PCI(e) slots anyway), but who knows what's possible?
<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
I don't know an awful lot about hardware, so any thoughts/suggestions are
gratefully received.  Of course, the systems should support Linux/*BSD [1] -- I
don't want to have to grapple with anything Windows-specific. 
</p>

<p>
Any help is thankfully appreciated.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
TIA,
</p>

<p>
[1] I've been using OpenBSD for a long time now, so anything to help further
that is definitely a bonus.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

A while back LG created an facebook 'group', but that didn't work out
so well. We have now created a Linux Gazette facebook page where
instead of 'joining' all you need to do it 'Like' it. Once you do
that, you will automatically receive updates from LG on your facebook
wall.
</p>

<p>
I am also linking the twitter account to the facebook page, so updates
there will show directly onto facebook (when twitter isn't overloaded
<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">).
</p>

<p>
And finally, through a Linux Gazette facebook you will be able to
share our updates onto your wall as well.

Amusing example of serendipity: one of our readers just sent me an email
letting me know that a link to a SourceForge project in one of our
articles was outdated and needed to be pointed to the new, renamed
version of the project. I changed it after taking a moment to verify the
SF link - and noticed that some of the project functionality was
relevant to Neil Youngman's question of a couple of months ago.
</p>

<p>
Pulling down the (small) project tarball and reading the docs
supported that impression:
</p>

<pre>
  'repeats' searches for duplicate files using a multistage process. Ini-
  tially, all files in the specified directories (and all of their subdi-
  rectories) are listed as potential duplicates.  In the first stage, all
  files with a unique filesize are declared unique and are  removed  from
  the list.  In the second stage, any files which are actually a hardlink
  to another file are removed, since they don't actually take up any more
  disk space.  Next, all files for which the first 4096 bytes (adjustable
  with the -m option) have a unique filehash are declared unique and  are
  removed from the list.  Finally, all files which have a unique filehash
  (for the entire file) are declared unique  and  are  removed  from  the
  list.   Any remaining files are assumed to be duplicates and are listed
  on stdout.
</pre>

<p>
The project is called "littleutils", by Brian Lindholm. There's a number
of other handy little utilities in there, all worth exploring.

<h3>Odd system load situation</h3>

<p>
Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I've got something odd going on, and I'm trying to get some perspective
on it. Perhaps someone here can cast a light.
</p>

<p>
I'm running a long-term rsync job (a full backup, after way too long of
a hiatus. I know - <strong>really</strong> *bad* for someone who hounds people to keep
on top of their backups professionally... but you know the saying about
the cobbler's kids being the last to have new shoes.) It's copying the
files to an external drive, connected via USB. Here's the problem: now
that it's running, my system has become extremely "sensitive" to any
additional loads - even very light ones. Firing up an xterm visibly
spikes the CPU (which, with nothing more than two xterms open, is
running at a load average of ~4.) Starting 'vim' takes about 4 seconds.
Opening a PDF with the rather lightweight 'xpdf' takes about 9 seconds.
Reformatting a paragraph in 'vim' turns the xterm gray for a good 5
seconds and almost freezes the cursor. Opening Firefox <em>does</em> freeze the
cursor and prevents me from being able to tab between open applications
for a good 30 seconds - and when it's open, the system is essentially
useless for anything else. Needless to say, all but the last one are
usually nearly instant, and Firefox normally takes just a couple of
seconds, and doesn't lock anything up while loading.
</p>

<p>
Here's the kicker: "top" shows... nothing particularly unusual.
vmstat/iostat report essentially the same story.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
$ (vmstat -a;iostat)
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- -system-- ----cpu----

          16.70    0.20    3.81    5.71    0.00   73.59

sdb               0.62         0.85        72.43    1429100  121212480
</pre>

<p>
Memory usage is reasonable, swap is barely being touched, the CPU is
spending 3/4 of its time being idle, even the number of context switches
is very reasonable as compared to the I/O rate. If I saw this on a
remote machine, I'd figure it was being under-utilized. :\ 
</p>

<p>
Now, it is true that I'm not running some mad smokin' powerhouse machine
that requires a dedicated nuclear power plant:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo|egrep '^(processor|model name)'
processor       : 0
model name      : Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N270   @ 1.60GHz
processor       : 1
model name      : Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU N270   @ 1.60GHz
$ cat /proc/meminfo|grep MemTotal
MemTotal:        1016764 kB
</pre>

<p>
It's just a little Acer laptop... but this is usually enough for pretty
much anything I need, including serving fairly heavy-duty Perl and PHP
scripting via Apache. So... what's going on? What is "rsync" doing that
is essentially invisible but is enough to make this thing behave like a
286 with 64k of memory? I thought I understood what the above numbers
mean, and could reasonably estimate system state from them - but it
seems that I'm wrong.

<h3>Bypassing GRUB</h3>

</p>

<p>
I often experiment with multiple distros (for learning/teaching value), by
installing them on my machine side by side. I then get to use a
specific distro/kernel by selecting it through GRUB, at boot time. Is there
some way to by-pass GRUB altogether and boot a specific kernel
manually ?
</p>

<p>
Let me be clear, I want to bypass GRUB and choose the kernel/distro
manually. It is not about  replacing the sick GRUB by a healthy GRUB.
</p>

<p>
I would appreciate any clue or pointer.
</p>

<p>
Thank you,
</p>
