<h1>A 'revisited' guide to GNU Screen</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a> and <a href="../authors/milner.html">Steve 'Ashcrow' Milner</a></b></p>

<p>
Remember how tabbed browsing revolutionized the web experience? GNU Screen
can do the same for your experience in the command line. Screen allows
you to manage several interactive shell instances within the same "window".
By using different keyboard shortcuts, you can shuffle through the shell
instances, access any of them directly, create new ones, kill old ones, and
attach and detach existing ones.
</p>

<p>
Instead of opening up several terminal instances on your desktop or
using those ugly GNOME/KDE-based tabs, Screen can do it better
and simpler.
</p>

<p>
Not only that, with Screen you can share sessions with others
and detach/attach terminal sessions. It is a great tool for people who have
to share working environments between work and home.
</p>

<p>
By adding a status bar to your screen environment, you are able to
name your shell instances on the fly or via a configuration file called
.screenrc that can be created in the user's home directory.	
</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
Installing screen on a Fedora system is quite easy with yum,
assuming you have root access.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Login as root:
</p>
<pre class="code">su - # enter root password</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use yum to install it:
</p>
<pre class="code">yum install screen</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
On Debian based distributions like Ubuntu:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
As root:
</p>
<pre class="code">apt-get install screen</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Enter your password. After a few minutes (depending on your network
connection), Screen will be installed. But before you start playing around
with it, let's look at how to do some basic configuration.	
</p>

<h3>Customizing the configuration file</h3>
<p>
Screen keeps its configuration file in the same vein that many
applications do: in a dot file in your user's home directory. This file
is aptly named .screenrc. In my experience, most people use ~/.screenrc to
do two things:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>Make a hardstatus line.</em> This is basically a line at the bottom of the
screen that lists your current terminal and all opened ones. It can also
display the system clock and the hostname.
</li>
<li>
<em>Default screens on startup.</em> It's quite nice to have your IRC connection,
mail client, and default SSH connections auto-start for you!
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The lines below are numbered for reference. Your config file should
not have numbered lines.
</p>

<pre class="code">
1 hardstatus alwayslastline
2 hardstatus string '%{= kG}[ %{G}%H %{g}][%= %{=kw}%?%-Lw%?%{r}(%{W}%n*%f%t%?(%u)%?%{r})%{w}%?%+Lw%?%?%= %{g}][%{B}%Y-%m-%d %{W}%c %{g}]'
3
4 # Default screens
5 screen -t shell1 0
6 screen -t shell2 1
7 screen -t server 2 ssh me@myserver
</pre>
<p>
On lines 1 and 2, you are setting the hardstatus. Line 1 makes the
hardstatus always show up as the last line. Line 2 is what will be shown in
the hardstatus line. In this case you will see something like this at the
bottom:
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
As you change screens, you will see the parentheses move around the
active screen.	
</p>

<p>
	Line 4 is a comment, as it starts with #. Lines 5-7 are all screen
statements in the following format:
</p>

<pre class="code">
screen -t NameOfScreen ScreenNumber ShellCommand</pre>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>
<p>
The following are some of the most commonly used shortcuts that let
you navigate through your screen environment. Note that unless modified by
your .screenrc, by default every screen shortcut is preceded by Ctrl+a.
Note also that these shortcuts are case-sensitive.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
0 through 9 – Switches between windows
</li>
<li>
Ctrl+n – Switches to the next available window
</li>
<li>
Backspace – Switches to the previous available window
</li>
<li>
Ctrl+a – Switches back to the last window you were on
</li>
<li>
A – Changes window session name
</li>
<li>
K – Kills a window session
</li>
<li>
c – Creates a new window
</li>
<li>
[ - Then use arrows to scroll up and down terminal
</li>
<li>
" - Displays a lists of all opened tabs allowing navigation with your arrow keys.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You can learn more about shortcuts in Screen's man pages. In your
terminal, run:
</p>

<pre class="code">man screen</pre>

<h3>Sharing a session with others</h3>

<p>
Another great application of Screen is to allow other people to
login to your station and to watch the work you are doing. It is a great
way to teach someone how to do things in the shell.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> <em>Screen has to be SUID if you want to share a terminal between
two users. SUID allows an executable to be run with the privileges of
the owner of that file, instead of with the user's own privileges. There
are some security concerns when doing this, so use this tip at your own
discretion.</em>
</p>

<h3>Setup to allow screen to be shared</h3>

<p>
First, as root:
</p>

<pre class="code">
chmod u+s /usr/bin/screen
chmod 755 /var/run/screen
</pre>

<p>
Log out of root, and run Screen as the user who is going to share the session:
</p>

<pre class="code">screen</pre>

<p>
Under your new screen session:
</p>

<ol>
<li>

<p>
Press Ctrl+a, then type ':multiuser on' and press Enter.
</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>
Press Ctrl+a, then type ':acladd $username'
</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>
Where $username is the username of the person who will connect to your
screen session.
</p>

<h3>Connecting to the shared screen</h3>

<p>
Now that a screen session is being shared by following the previous steps,
let's attach ourselves to the session and watch it by connecting to the
machine via ssh and entering the following command:
</p>

<pre class="code">screen -x $username/</pre>

<p>
Where $username is the username of the person who is sharing the screen
session, and yes, you do need slash (/) at the end of the command.
</p>

<p>
And now both the users (from the host and guest) will be sharing a
screen session and can run commands on the terminal.
</p>

<h3>Working from multiple locations</h3>
<p>
Let's say you have a screen session open at work with X number of
windows on it. Within those screens you may be running an IRC client, an
SSH connection to the web server, and your favorite text-based email
client. It's 5 p.m. and you have to go home, but you still have work left
to do.
</p>

<p>
Without Screen you would probably go home, VPN into your company's
network, and fire up all the shells you need to keep working from home.
With Screen, life gets a little easier.
</p>

<p>
You can simply SSH into your workstation at work and list your
available screen sessions with the command:
</p>

<pre class="code">screen -ls</pre>

<p>
And connect to the sessions you were running at work with the
command:
</p>

<pre class="code">screen -x screen_session_name</pre>

<p>
This way screen will let you pick things up exactly from where you
left off.
</p>

<p>
Once you get used to the shortcuts in GNU Screen, not only will your
desktop become more organized (due to the lower number of open windows),
but your efficiency as a developer or system administrator will increase
not only at work but at your home office as well.
