<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I am working on an ARM based custom development board that has a Micro SD
connector.
</p>

<p>
I use Linux (kernel version 2.6.24) on the board and I have support for the
Micro SD cards.  The SD driver has support for hotplug.  At the bash prompt
on the target board, I am able to mount the card, write data to it and read
data from it.  What utility do I need to add to the root file system for the
card to be detected automatically when it's inserted and the file system on
the card's media to be mounted to a specified mount point?
</p>

<p>
A couple of years ago, I was working with PCMCIA Flash memory cards and USB
memory disks.  There used to be a utility called Card Manager (cardmgr) that
detects the insertion of a PCMCIA flash memory card and mounts it
automatically.  USB memory disks used to be automounted by the hotplug
scripts.  Is there any utility similar to this for SD/MMC/Micro SD cards?
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance,
Kanagesh
</p>
