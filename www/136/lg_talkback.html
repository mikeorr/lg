<p>
It appears to me that the author has explained why the result is showing
0.000 seconds: 'run' never gets called, as it says in his article. Was
there something you wanted to add?

In the future, please use the Talkback: link at the bottom of each

allows The Answer Gang to discuss it. I've forwarded your e-mail to TAG for
you, this time.

Hello,
</p>

<p>
I hadn't read more than a couple of lines into this article and I
already knew that I would like it. Reading further only confirmed my
initial reaction.
</p>

<p>
Great article!
</p>

<p>
Here's a twist from Oliver --- "Please, Sir! Can I have some more?"

Greetings from Germany.
</p>

<p>
I read the Book "IPCOP" from Packet as well.
I work as network engineer / firewall engineer with Checkpoint Firewalls,
Cisco PIX Firewalls, Symantec / Axxent Raptor Firewalls and even with 
IPCOP and Linux iptables firewalls.
I never saw a pice of shit like this.
This book is perhaps even illegal, it seems to be a copy of the IPCOP 
firewall handbook itself.
</p>

<p>
DONT READ THIS.

Hi, Ireaded your article about 6 seat Linux enviroment.
</p>

<p>
I have an idea from that, but I don't have anyclue how to do it. I Have  
Ubuntu 6.10, gnome, and 2 disjointed screens. Now I'd like to bind 2  
keyboards, one for each screen, but still use my mouse as of now, jumping  
to another screen over the edge of monitor. Would that be possible in any  
way?

Hi folks,
</p>

<p>
A quick question about this month's Geekword --- clues 23A, 15D and 18D
all seem to refer to clues that don't exist. Is this a mistake or have
I misundersttod something?

I have read your article discussing swf and possible open-source readers and players.
My Debian Linux machine (a Mac Quadra running Sarge) is nowhere near adequate to
your suggestions. Is there a swf to jpeg converter that could run on my system?
</p>

<p>

Hello,
I have a warning to add to an old article on your web it can be found at 
<a href="../120/smith.html">http://linuxgazette.net/120/smith.html</a>
</p>

<p>
not every Intel 537 modem will work with this.  if you could tell the 
users to stay away from the intel 82537EP chipset, at the moment they 
are incompatible with the wcfxo module. 
</p>


<p>
Thank you for your time,

</p>

<p>
There are also a fair number of problems with NX.
</p>

<p>
- It is based on a rather old verson of the X server. That X server has
  several known security bugs. There is a reason most distributions do
  not ship even the open-source NX parts.
- Resuming a session doesn't always work. Murphy says it fails to work
  when it's most likely that your session has important but unsaved data
  in it. :-/
- The song+dance with the separate "nx" user and the client ssh key
  is completely unnecessary. Using a straight ssh login would be a whole
  lot simpler. It would also be more secure, because the user would be
  able to use their ssh keychains instead of typing in a password.
- Relies on a patched ssh client. An <strong>old</strong> ssh client. A patch which
  introduces a lot of code that belongs in a separate program.
</p>

<p>
The fact that the security people of several major distribution have
basically vetoed including NX should tell you something.

Hi there,
Just want to say thank you for putting this up again. LG #134 dropped
this section and I was so disappointed because I look forward to it
every month. It is fun playing with terms and find out lots of holes
in my knowledge.
Thank you again.
