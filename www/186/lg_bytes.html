<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">71% of iPhone and Android Apps Violate Open Source Licenses</h3>

<p>At the March AnDevCon Conference, OpenLogic, Inc., a provider of open 
source governance solutions. announced the results of a scan and 
license compliance assessment of 635 leading mobile applications. 
Among other findings, the results show that 71% of Android, iPhone and 
iPad apps containing open source failed to comply with basic open 
source license requirements.</p>
		
<p>OpenLogic found several apps with extensive EULAs that claimed all of 
the software included was under their copyright and owned by them - 
when in fact some of the code in the app was open source.</p>

<p>Using its scanner, OSS Deep Discovery, OpenLogic scanned compiled 
binaries and source code where available for 635 mobile applications 
to identify open source under GPL, LGPL and Apache licenses. For the 
66 applications scanned that contained Apache or GPL/LPGL licenses, 
71% failed to comply with four key obligations that OpenLogic 
analyzed. These included:</p>

<p>GPL/LGPL license requirements to:</p>				
<ul><li> provide source code or an offer to get the source code</li>
<li>provide a copy of the license</li></ul>
				
<p>Apache license requires to:</p>
<ul><li> provide a copy of the licenses</li>
<li> provide notices/attributions</li></ul>

<p>"Many mobile and tablet developers may not have a complete picture of 
the open source they are using and the requirements of the open source 
licenses. This has real-world implications. For example, the Free 
Software Foundation has stated that the GPL and iTunes license are not 
compatible, and Apple has already pulled several apps from the store 
that were determined to be under the GPL," said Kim Weins, senior vice 
president of products and marketing at OpenLogic. "Google has also 
received takedown requests for Android market apps that violated the 
GPL. App developers need to pay attention to open source license 
compliance to ensure their apps are not impacted by legal actions."</p>
			
<p>Out of the 635 apps scanned, OpenLogic identified 52 applications that 
use the Apache license and 16 that use the GPL/LGPL license.</p>

<p>OpenLogic found that among the applications that use the Apache or 
GPL/LGPL licenses, the compliance rate was only 29%. Android 
compliance was 27% and iPhone/iOS compliance was 32%. Overall 
compliance of Android applications using the GPL/LGPL was 0%.</p>
			
<p>Although the research did not specifically analyze conflicts between 
different licenses, OpenLogic noted that 13 of the applications came 
from the Apple App Store, used GPL/LGPL. The App Store has already 
removed other applications that included GPL/LGPL licenses. In 
addition, two of the applications on Android contained LGPLv2.1. This 
license could have potential conflicts with Apache 2.0 - which is the 
major license of the Android operating system.	
OpenLogic provides enterprises with a certified library of open source 
software that encompasses hundreds of the most popular open source 
packages via OpenLogic Exchange (OLEX), a free web site where 
companies can find, research, and download certified, enterprise-ready 
open source packages on demand.  For more information, visit:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IronKey finds UK Organisations Fear Organised Cyber-crime</h3>

<p>IronKey, a leader in securing data and online access, released a 
survey of IT security professionals working at UK-based organisations 
including, Lloyds Banking Group, HP, Fujitsu, Siemens, Worcester 
County Council and Cleveland Police.  The study showed that 31 per 
cent suffered one or more organised attacks in the last 12 months 
resulting in theft of data or money.</p>

<p>Besides  suffering at least one cyber attack in the last 12 months, 45 
per cent believed their organisation is a target of organised 
cyber-crime which could result in the theft or sabotage.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately the results of our research don't really come as a 
shock, as the past 12 months have seen some of the biggest and most 
successful cyber-attacks our industry has ever witnessed," said Dave 
Jevans, founder of IronKey and the Anti-Phishing Working Group. </p>

<p>When asked about the significant information security threat facing 
their organisation today, 54 per cent of respondents highlighted 
accidental data leakage by staff, contractors or vendors as the 
biggest threat. The past five years of highly publicised data breaches 
and the power of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to levy 
&pound;500,000 have gained the attention of organisations. In contrast, only 
10 per cent fear external attack on networks and systems and only 13 
per cent see Trojans that steal data, money, or sabotage systems as a 
significant threat to their organisation.</p>

<p>While 44 per cent of respondents believed an untrusted desktop or 
laptop is the most vulnerable location for an advance persistent 
threat (APT) attack, it appears respondents prefer traditional 
methods, such as end user education (44 per cent) or anti-virus (29 
per cent), as opposed to technology that isolates user and data from 
threats (19 per cent), as the most effective tool to prevent APT 
attacks.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, end user education and anti-virus were all in place at 
organisations that suffered painful losses as a result of APT attacks. 
Doing the same thing over and over won't make the problem go away - 
criminals are only more encouraged," commented Jevans. "As an 
industry, we need to shift away from trying to be all knowing and 
detecting threats we can't know about until they happen. Instead, we 
need to isolate users of sensitive data and transactions away from the 
problem."</p>

<p>As a result of cyber-crime, British business is estimated to be losing 
&pound;20bn a year.  Targeted attacks on the global energy industry as part 
of the Night Dragon attacks, the breach of infrastructure at RSA, 
compromise of digital certificate issuance at Comodo, and theft of 
millions of customer records from Epsilon all show that any 
organisation is a potential target.</p>

<p>IronKey also announced the availability of IronKey Trusted Access for 
Banking 2.7 which addresses the continuing needs of banks to isolate 
customers from the growing threat of crimeware and online account 
takeovers. The new update includes IronKey's keylogging protection 
that blocks the capture of user credentials, one-time passcodes (OTP), 
challenge questions, and other sensitive data criminals can otherwise 
easily steal.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu 11.04 Goes Gold</h3>

<p>The newest release of Ubuntu Linux was released at the end of April 
and features the new Unity user interface - a source of some 
controversy among beta testers - and added support for Cloud 
deployments and DevOps automation.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 11.04 Server, while not a release with Long Term Support (LTS) 
, will include will upgrades for the core cloud solution, Ubuntu 
Enterprise Cloud. The release includes the latest stable version of 
technology from Eucalyptus for those looking to build private clouds. 
Also included is  OpenStack's  latest release, 'Cactus.</p>

<p>For those working on public clouds, Ubuntu Server 11.04 will be 
available from Amazon Web Services (AWS). In addition, Canonical is 
announcing Ubuntu CloudGuest later in May, allowing individuals and 
businesses to test  and develop on the cloud with support and systems 
management from Canonical. For the first time, potential users can 
test-drive Ubuntu online using only a web browser. Visitors to 
Ubuntu.com will be able to access a complete version of the latest 
product without having to download anything.</p>

<p>In part, the CloudGuest program replaces the free CD program that 
Canonical has discontinued.</p>

<p>With the Unity UI,  Ubuntu has better support for touch screens and 
multi-touch gesture controls.  There also better support for Sandy 
Bridge and Radeon graphics chip sets and drivers.  Also Ubuntu 
Software Center, used to download free applications, has been 
integrated with the Unity program launcher and shows users reviews of 
potentially useful software.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 11.04 includes Cobbler and MCollective to help automate system 
administration tasks and orchestrate operations, with policy-based 
configurations and RPC calls.</p>

<p>Check here the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download">Ubuntu Downloads Page.</a></p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Slackware 13.37 released</h3>

<p>Here comes Slackware Linux 13.37, a new version of the world's oldest 
surviving Linux-based operating system.</p>

<p>Slackware 13.37 has been released with enhanced performance and 
stability from a year of rigorous testing. Slackware 13.37 uses the 
2.6.37.6 Linux kernel and also ships with 2.6.38.4 kernels for those 
want to be at the bleeding edge. Firefox 4.0 is the default web 
browser, the X Window System has been upgraded (and includes the open 
source nouveau driver for NVIDIA cards) and the desktop is and KDE 
4.5.5.. Even the  Slackware installer has been improvedl with support 
for installing to btrfs, a one-package-per-line display mode option, 
and is an easy to set-up PXE install server that runs off the 
Slackware DVD.</p>

<p>The Speakup driver, used to support speech synthesizers providing 
access to Linux for the visually impaired community, has now been 
merged into all of the provided kernels.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Yocto 1.0 and Carrier Grade Linux 5.0 Released</h3>

<p>Two Linux Foundation Working Groups released major updates of their 
collaborative work in April.</p>

vThe Yocto 1.0 Project Release became availabile and includes major 
improvements to its developer interface and build system, providing 
developers with even greater consistency in the software and tools 
they're using across multiple architectures for embedded Linux 
development. <a href="http://www.yoctoproject.org">For more information, Click here.</a></p>

<p>Carrier Grade Linux 5.0 covers several specification categories that 
include Availability, Clustering, Serviceability, Performance, 
Standards, Hardware, and Security. Also, a number of requirements have 
been dropped from the specification due to the mass adoption and 
ubiquity of CGL and its inclusion in the mainline Linux kernel, which 
allows these specifications to become more consistent fixtures across 
different distributions. For more information and to review the CGL

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">VMware Delivers Cloud Foundry as an Open PaaS</h3>

<p>This next generation open application platform provides a broad choice 
of developer frameworks and cloud deployment options.</p>

<p>VMware delivered Cloud Foundry in April, an open Platform as a Service 
(PaaS) architected specifically for cloud computing environments and 
delivered as a service from both enterprise datacenters and public 
cloud service providers. Cloud Foundry enhances the ability of 
developers to deploy, run and scale their applications in cloud 
environments while allowing wide choice of public and private clouds, 
developer frameworks and application infrastructure services.</p>

<p>VMware is introducing a new VMware-operated developer cloud service, a 
new open source PaaS project and the first ever "Micro Cloud" PaaS 
solution.  VMware introduced Cloud Foundry at an event where developer 
community leaders highlighted the value of an open PaaS in advancing 
highly productive development frameworks for the cloud. Speakers 
include: Dion Almaer and Ben Galbraith, co-founders of FunctionSource, 
Ryan Dahl, creator of Node.JS from Joyent, Ian McFarland, VP, 
Technology, Pivotal Labs, Roger Bodamer, 10Gen, steward of MongoDB, 
and Michael Crandell, CEO and co-founder of RightScale. Further 
industry support and blogs are available from 10Gen and RightScale.</p>

<p>Modern application development faces a growing set of challenges such 
as diverse application development frameworks, choices in new data, 
messaging, and web service application building blocks, heterogeneous 
cloud deployment options, and the customer imperative to deploy and 
migrate applications flexibly across enterprise private clouds and 
multiple cloud service providers.</p>

<p>PaaS offerings have emerged as the modern solution to the changing 
nature of applications, increasing developer efficiency, while 
promising to let developers focus exclusively on writing applications, 
rather than configuring and patching systems, maintaining middleware 
and physical machines and worrying about network topologies.</p>

<p>Early PaaS offerings, however, restricted developers to a specific or 
non-standard development frameworks, a limited set of application 
services or a single, vendor-operated cloud service. "For all of the 
developer interest in the potential benefits to PaaS solutions, actual 
adoption has been slowed by their employment of non-standard 
components and frameworks which raise the threat of lock-in," said 
Stephen O'Grady, Principal Analyst at RedMonk." With Cloud Foundry, 
VMware is providing developers a PaaS platform with the liberal 
licensing and versatility to accommodate the demand for choice in 
developer programming languages."</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry is a modern application platform built specifically to 
simplify the end-to-end development, deployment and operation of cloud 
era applications. Cloud Foundry orchestrates heterogeneous application 
services and applications built in multiple frameworks and automates 
deployment of applications and their underlying infrastructure across 
diverse cloud infrastructures.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry supports popular, high productivity programming 
frameworks, including Spring for Java, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra for Ruby 
and Node.js, as well as support for other JVM-based frameworks 
including Grails. The open architecture will enable additional 
programming frameworks to be rapidly supported in the future. For 
application services, Cloud Foundry will initially support the 
MongoDB, MySQL and Redis databases with planned support for VMware 
vFabric services.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry is not tied to any single cloud environment, nor does it 
require a VMware infrastructure to operate. Rather, Cloud Foundry 
supports deployment to any public and private cloud environment, 
including those built on VMware vSphere those offered by VMware vCloud 
partners, non-VMware public clouds and demonstrated support for Amazon 
Web Services by cloud management provider RightScale.</p>

<p>Cloud Foundry will be offered in multiple delivery models:</p>

<ul><li>New VMware-Operated Developer Service - Available now in beta release, 
<a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.com">http://www.cloudfoundry.com</a> is a full function public cloud PaaS service, 
operated by VMware, enabling developers to access Cloud Foundry and 
providing a test bed for new services and operational optimization.  
Via this multi-tenant PaaS environment, developers can deploy and 
cloud-scale their applications in seconds.  Developers can sign up for 
invitations today to use this service.</li>

<li>Open Source, Community PaaS Project - Available now at 
<a href="http://www.cloudfoundry.org">http://www.cloudfoundry.org</a>, this open source project and community under 
Apache 2 license enables developers to inspect, evaluate and modify 
Cloud Foundry software based on their own needs, while also minimizing 
the risk of lock-in.  This model provides the highest degree of 
extensibility, allowing the community to extend and integrate Cloud 
Foundry with any framework, application service or infrastructure 
cloud.</li>

<li>New Cloud Foundry Micro Cloud - Available later in Q2 2011, Cloud 
Foundry Micro Cloud will be a complete, downloadable instance of Cloud 
Foundry contained within a Linux virtual machine that can run on a 
developer's desktop, enabling simplified development and testing.  
Then developers can build and test applications on their own machines 
and ensure that applications running locally will also run in 
production, without modification, on any Cloud Foundry-based private 
or public cloud.  </li>

<li>Cloud Foundry for the Enterprise and Service Providers - In the 
future, VMware will also offer a commercial version of Cloud Foundry 
for enterprises who want to offer PaaS capabilities within their own 
private clouds and for service providers who want to offer Cloud 
Foundry via their public cloud services.  This commercial solution 
will enable enterprises to integrate the PaaS environment with their 
application infrastructure services portfolio. Service provider 
solutions will further deliver on the promise of portability across a 
hybrid cloud environment, enabling freedom to deploy internally or 
migrate to one of VMware's nearly 3,500 vCloud partners.</li></ul>



<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Version of Intel Atom CPU aimed at NetBooks and Tablets</h3>

<p>In April, Intel released the Intel Atom chip formerly codenamed "Oak 
Trail," which will be available in devices starting in May.  In 
addition, at the Intel Developer Forum in Beijing, the company gave a 
sneak peak of its next-generation, 32nm Intel Atom platform, currently 
codenamed "Cedar Trail." This solution will help to enable a new wave 
of fanless, cool and quiet netbooks, entry-level desktops and 
all-in-one designs.</p>

<p>The new Intel Atom processor Z670, part of the "Oak Trail" platform, 
delivers improved video playback, fast Internet browsing and longer 
battery life. The rich media experience available with "Oak Trail" 
includes support for 1080p video decode, as well as HDMI. The platform 
also supports Adobe Flash, enabling rich content and Flash-based 
gaming.</p>

<p>The platform also helps deliver smaller, thinner and more efficient 
devices by packing integrated graphics and the memory controller 
directly onto the processor die. The processor is 60 percent smaller 
than previous generations with a lower-power design for fanless 
devices as well as up to all-day battery life. Additional features 
include Intel Enhanced Deeper Sleep that saves more power during 
periods of inactivity. An integrated HD decode engine enables smooth 
1080p HD video playback with less power used.</p>

<p>The Intel Atom processor Z670 allows applications to run on various 
operating systems, including Google Android, MeeGo and Windows. This 
flexibility aides hybrid designs that combine the best features of the 
netbook and tablet together.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SPLUNK 4.2 Features real-time alerting</h3>

<p>Splunk has released version 4.2 of its software that collects, indexes 
and harnesses any machine data logs generated by an organization's IT 
systems and infrastructure - physical, virtual and in the cloud.</p>

<p>Splunk 4.2 builds on the innovation of previous releases, adding 
real-time alerting, a new Universal Forwarder, improved usability and 
performance, and centralized management capabilities for distributed 
Splunk deployments.</p>

<p>Machine data holds a wealth of information that can be used to obtain 
operational intelligence and provide valuable insights for IT and the 
business. Splunk is the engine for machine data that helps enterprises 
improve service levels, reduce operations costs, mitigate security 
risks, enable compliance and create new product and service offerings.</p>

<p>Splunk 4.2 new features include:</p>

<p>Real-time alerting. Provides immediate notification and response for 
events, patterns, incidents and attacks as they occur.
Universal Forwarder. New dedicated lightweight forwarder delivers 
secure, distributed, real-time data collection from thousands of 
endpoints with a significantly reduced footprint.
Easier and faster. New ways to visualize data, quick start guides for 
new users, integrated workflows for common tasks and up to 10 times 
faster search experience in large-scale distributed deployments.
Better management of Splunk. New centralized monitoring and license 
management facilitate the management of multiple Splunk instances from 
one location.</p>
