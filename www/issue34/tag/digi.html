>Linux Support for the DigiBoard C/X Intelligent Serial Ports</H3>
<p><strong>From Dave Barker on 08 Sep 1998 </strong></p>
<!-- begin body -->


<p><strong>I'm trying to setup a Linux RH 5.0 box as a dial in server using a
DigiBoard C/X host adaptor and a 16 port C/Con 16 Concentrator.
What I'd like to know is:
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Does Linux support Software controlled Serial Ports, meaning the
current attempt has been to set up a 15MB dos partition as the boot,
and install the DOS drivers from Digi, and then add the com ports
into linux?
</strong></p>

<blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)" height="28" width="50" align="bottom">The question (as stated) is flawed.  On a PC all multi-port
serial boards require some form of software to control them
(since the BIOS/firmware only supports 4 COM ports).  In
addition the BIOS support for COM ports is extremely limited
and slow --- so all communications software (under DOS,
Windows, OS/2, Linux and other forms of UNIX, etc) have
bypassed the firmware and used direct access to the I/O ports
that control the serial ports as well as those that actually
carry the serial data).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>So, a more reasonably restatement of your question might be:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>Can Linux use the DOS drivers supplied by Digi?
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>... that answer is "no."  (It is also "no" for NT, other 
forms of UNIX, OS/2 and probably for Win '95/'98 as well).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Device drivers are generally not portably between operating
systems.  The interface between an OS kernel and its 
device driver is typically unique for each OS.  There has been
some discussion about creating a portable PC device driver
specification --- to allows 
<a href="http://www.sco.com/">SCO</a>, 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/">Solaris</a>, 
Linux, and *BSD
drivers to share (at least some) device drivers.  That will 
probably never happen --- and even if it does it will probably
never extend to non-Unix-like operating systems.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now, regarding the broader question:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>Does Linux support the Digi C/X intelligent serial port 
subsystem?
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>When I last corresponded with Digi about this they assured
me that they would have native Linux drivers by the end of 
that summer.  That was over a year ago.  I did check back
on their web site a couple of months ago and it didn't seem
to indicate that they'd ever delivered on this promise.  
</blockquote>

<blockquote>The obvious thing to do would be to contact their support
staff and ask for native Linux drivers.  It may be that their
web site is out of date, or that my efforts t weed through
their pages was inadequate (the bigger the company, the 
worse their web site).
</blockquote>

<p><em>[ I dunno about the 
<a href="http://www.dgii.com/">Digi International</a>
 site, (which is being redesigned right now) but the 
<a href="http://private.fuller.edu/~clameter/digi.html">Linux
	Digiboard Page</a> might be useful, even though it's
	rather old. -- Heather ]</em></p>

<p><strong><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)" height="28" width="50" align=""bottom">Next if this would work in theory what is the proper way to go about
setting the serial ports up?
</strong></p>

<blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)" height="28" width="50" align="bottom">The "proper way" would be to use the device drivers that work 
with your OS.  Another way, might be to run the DOS drivers
under '<TT>dosemu</TT>' (configuring that with sufficient access to
the hardware and I/O permissions map that the Linux kernel
will let it drive the serial board).  However, that would
only allow DOS to access the devices.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the project where I initially contacted them I was
using an operating system called TSX-32 (by S&amp;H systems: 
<A HREF="http://www.sandh.com">http://www.sandh.com</A>) --- and the TSX-BBS (also by them).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>This package is a 32-bit multi-user commercial (closed source)
OS that's modeled after the old TSX-11 and RSX-11 (a predecessor 
to VMS on the PDP-11 platform).  It also runs a decent DOS 
emulator and the BBS has some nice features that make it more
scalable than any other that I'd seen 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>(I've run 
<a href="http://www.galacticomm.com/">Galacticomm</a> MajorBBS 
and <a href="http://www.esoft.com/">eSoft</a> TBBS systems which
used to be limited to single CPU's, had no TCP/IP support, no
end-user scripting facilities, limited support for doors, and
little or no support for intelligent serial hardware --- such
that 255 was about the maximum --- PCBoard as limited to about
4 to 8 lines per PC --- and you needed a Netware server to
cluster those.  TSX-BBS can handle 250 lines per server and
multiple servers can peer over TCP/IP for a potential of
thousands of lines).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obviously Linux (and other forms of Unix) have that sort of
scaleability --- given the drivers.  There are some big Unix/Linux
BBS' out there (like MMB "Teammate" and a native port of 
Galacticomm's BBS --- renamed to something like "WorldPort"
--- though I don't remember the details).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>My enthusiasm for TSX-BBS has waned a bit (they aren't
getting out the updates that I'd hoped for).  However, that's
a non-issue since I left that position long ago and no longer
have to maintain any BBS'  (and the whole dial-up bulletin
board system phenomenon seems to have waned almost as much
as UUCP).
</blockquote>

<p><strong><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)" height="28" width="50" align=""bottom">I'm really in a bind here, and could use any help I can get!
Thanks in advance

<blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)" height="28" width="50" align="bottom">I would beat up on Digi --- and, if they don't satisfy your
needs --- consider one of their other models (a number of them
do support Linux) or Rocketport, Equinox, Comtrol, Cyclades,
Stallion, or other vendors of multi-port serial hardware that
will support Linux.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Naturally I understand that this may entail major reworking of
your plan.  The C/X is the only system that I know of that
allows you to connect 250 ports to a PC using only one bus
slot.  You might have to rework your plan to use multiple
Linux systems, each with multiple serial port board, and 
configure those as "terminal servers" (have them binding
the incoming serial/phone connections into 8-bit clean 
rlogin/telnet sessions to the master server.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Of course you could also look at traditional terminal servers.
These are router-like devices that do precisely what I've 
described (often with support for their own authentication
--- RADIUS and/or various versions of TACACS, and support
to provide PPP and/or SLIP instead of the rlogin/telnet like
session that would be used for dial-up terminal use.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Naturally to give you better advice and more specifics I'd
have to know more about your requirements and less about the
particular problems you're encountered with your currently
proposed solution.  All I can currently guess about your
requirements is that you need support for a bunch of serial
lines (you said "dial-in" so I can also guess that a bunch
of modems are involved).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you already purchased the C/X and you already selected
Linux for this project then <EM>shame on you</EM> --- you really need
to do requirements analysis <EM>before</EM> committing to various
implementation details (specific hardware and software).  (If
you're just stuck with some stuff you had laying about for a
skunkworks project --- then my condolences; you might need to
negotiate some funding for it).
