Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
We've got somebody that just volunteered to translate bits and pieces of
LG into Arabic. Since he's working by himself, and is not a native
speaker (and since I can't read Arabic myself), does anyone here have
the ability to vet the stuff? It's at '<a href="http://arlinux.110mb.com/lgazet/">http://arlinux.110mb.com/lgazet/</a>'.
</p>

Hi Ben..

<p>
Just to add small note: i am happy that one of tips got translated
there too. About the Arabic letters, it's out of my knowledge :|
</p>

<p>

Mulyadi.

Hi,
I'm a native Arabic speaker. I can go through the translated text and
check it but I'm terrible at actually typing Arabic and I'm not that
good at it anyway. I'll help with the translation as much as I can. I'll
start in a few days though because I have some exams right now.
</p>

<p>
PS: Is anyone doing an Esperanto translation? just wondering.....
