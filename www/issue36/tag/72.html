Well, you're probably correct.  If your host is a route
to a block of machines, and other routers on your LAN don't
know that you are the route, then they won't forward the
packets to your --- and you won't get the opportunity to
route them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are three solutions to the problem:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ol>
<li>Add a static route to the other routers
<li>Publish your routes via RIP, OSPF, or some
    other routing update protocol that's supported
    by your routers (running 'routed' or 'gated'
    on your host as appropriate).  Note: this may
    require changes to the configurations on these
    other local routers --- since they may be
    configured to filter routing updates except
    from a well defined list of peers.
<li>Use "proxyarp"
</ol></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
... The "proxyarp" trick will <EM>only</EM> work if the
systems to which you are trying to route are using addresses
that would normally be local to your other routers.  I
realize that that sentence didn't make any sense.  So let's
use an example:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(complete with ugly ASCII art)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>              +--------+                 +----------+ 222.123.45.48/28
 (Internet) --| router |-----------------| proxyarp |------+
              +--------+                 +----------+      |
                          222.123.45.32/27                 |  +-----+
                                                           +--| cow |
                                                              +-----+
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... in this example (which is similar to one I'm using
at home --- though the IP addresses have been changed to
discourage people from probing my network more than they
already have) we have a router. In my case it's a DSL ---
provided by my ISP and configured to give me a block of
30 addresses from <tt>222.123.45.32</tt> through 
<tt>222.123.45.63</tt>, minus the network and broadcast address, 
of course).  This is a "5 bit" subnet --- that is to say that 
it uses a netmask of <tt>255.255.255.224</tt> or 32-27=5.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I want to hide my systems behind a home brewed Linux firewall
--- especially after I noticed three IMAP and one mountd scans
within the first month of getting the line --- before I've
even published any DNS entries pointing to these addresses!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So I put up a Linux system with two ethernet interfaces
and a copy of the 2.0.36 kernel on it.  The router is
at <tt>222.123.45.33</tt> (the first address in the block).  The
"outer" interface on my "proxyarp" (firewall) is at
<tt>222.123.45.46</tt> (the last usable address in the lower half of
that range --- if I want to subnet the block into two
grougs of fourteen addresses for a 4 bit subnet using a
mask of <tt>255.255.255.240</tt>).  The inner interfaces (further
away from my DSL router) is assigned <tt>22.123.45.62</tt> (the last
usable address in the upper 4-bit subnet of my original
5-bit subnet.  These are arbitrary choices that I make
for my own convenience.  They allow me to have simpler
routing tables and packet filters on the inner LAN.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The problem here is that the DSL router doesn't know
that it should forward packets to "cow" (at <tt>222.123.45.49</tt>,
for example) to my firewall system.  So I issue the following
command:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<BR>#!/bin/sh
<BR><TT>/sbin/arp</TT> -s 222.123.45.48 -i eth0 -D eth1 netmask 255.255.255.240 pub
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... on the firewall (proxyarp host).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, when the DSL router gets a packet for <EM>anything</EM> in
the <tt>222.123.45.32/27</tt> range it does an ARP (address resolution
protocol) transaction to determine which ethernet card
the data frame should be addressed to.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is a source of confusion in advanced routing. "Packets"
are transport layer constructs.  "Frames" are network layer
constructs which encapsulate packets.  Packets are addressed
by IP addresses (the familiar sets of four "octets" or
dotted decimal numbers).  Frames are addressed differently
according to the media over which they are sent.  Ethernet
frames addressed by their "MAC" (media access control)
addresses --- a 48 bit number which is either from the
card's "BIA" (burned in address) or set by ethernet driver
(look at the "<tt>hw</tt>" option on your '<tt>ifconfig</tt>' 
command's man page).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can see your ethernet card's MAC address by reading
the output of the '<tt>ifcommand</tt>'  They are usually represented
something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>		HWaddr 0A:60:B7:0F:F1:6E  Int:10 addr:0x300
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's how ARP works.  By addressing frames to the proper
ethernet card --- all of the other ether cards on all of
the other systems on a given LAN segment can filter out
frames that aren't intended for them.  This allows the
host in which they are installed to work more efficiently
--- since the driver software doesn't have to "look at"
those frames (unless that card is in "promiscous mode"
running '<tt>sniffit</tt>' or '<tt>tcpdump</tt>' for example).  However,
the routers and other local systems much find a way to
map between the IP addresses and the corresponding MAC
addresses.  (We're only talking about ethernet here ---
though similar mechanism exists for ARCnet and token ring;
ATM is <EM>completely</EM> different)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
ARP is that method.  Any system on an ethernet segment that
has a packet that appears to be destined for the local segment
(according to its routing table) will send out an ethernet
broadcast frame essentially yelling out:  "Will the owner of
IP address <tt>222.123.45.61</tt> please speak up!"  Every host on
that segment then must process an interrupt to filter that
ARP request.  The system that actually "owns" this IP address
(has it assigned to their interface, or is acting as the
proxyarp host for it) will send a response packet addressed
just to the original requestor.  The requestor will then
cache this ARP entry (so the one ARP broadcast will
normally occur at the beginning of the first TCP connection
or UDP transaction and stay valid for a long time).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... The idea of "proxyarp" is that this '<tt>arp</tt>' command,
with the "pub" option tells the Linux kernel to respond
to ARP requests for any of the addresses in the specified
subnet.  (It's also possible to publish an ARP for a
single address, of course).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When the kernel gets a copy of the frames that
are addressed to it's ethernet MAC it will process them.
When it discovers that the packet encapsulated in this frame
is not one of <EM>its</EM> addresses it will attempt to forward it.
Actually in recent kernels it will refer to the value of the
<TT>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</TT> flag and <EM>only</EM> forward the
packet <EM>if</EM> that is set to one.  So, you must use a command
like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
echo 1 &gt; <TT>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to do any packet routing --- proxyarp or otherwise.
If the ip_forward flag is set to 0 then only those packets
which originated from the kernel and from locally running
processes will be forwarded.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Assuming that you have ip_forward set to 1, Linux will
then look for a route to these addresses.  So we must have
valid routes on the firewall/proxyarp host for both of
these networks.  In our example the firewall machine
has a routing table that looks something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U     0      0        9 lo

</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
While the routing table on the DSL router probably
looks something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

0.0.0.0         RT.TO.MY.ISP    0.0.0.0         UG    0      0      166 ppp0
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(where RT.TO.MY.ISP  is address to my ISP's routers and thus
to the Internet as a whole).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The routes on "cow" and system clients on that segment
would look like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface

</pre></blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
... which shows that the addresses between <tt>222.123.45.49</tt>
and  <tt>222.123.45.62</tt> are all "Local" and that any other packets
should be relayed to the firewall.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For any hosts that I put <EM>between</EM> the router and
the firewall I'd have routes that looked like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>Kernel IP routing table

<BLOCKQUOTE>
... which tells those systems that the <tt>222.123.45.33</tt>
through <tt>222.123.45.46</tt> addresses on on the local segment,
that DSL router is the gateway to the Internet (the default
route), and that the "outer" interface on the firewall
is the gateway to the <tt>222.123.45.48</tt> subnet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's also possible to act as a proxyarp for PPP, SLIP, and
PLIP connections.  In other words I can proxyarp/route
between other types and combinations of interfaces besides the
two ethernet cards I'm showing in this example.    For PPP
you can simply add the "proxyarp" directive to the appropriate
'<tt>options</tt>' file or command line.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a mini-HOWTO on ProxyARP by Bob Edwards of the
Australian National University (home of Samba, and '<tt>rsync</tt>'
among other projects) at:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE> <CODE>
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Proxy-ARP-Subnet.html"
	>http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/mini/Proxy-ARP-Subnet.html</A>
</CODE> </BLOCKQUOTE> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've copied the author on this message --- in case he'd
like to make any corrections or it he finds my examples
of use in updates to his HOWTO.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I hope that helps.  When I dug up a link to that
mini-HOWTO I found that Bob has added quite a bit to it.
I seem to recall that it used to cover the PPP case pretty
well and didn't describe the case between a couple of
ethernet segments --- but I may be just hallucinating.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now that I'm looking at it again I see that most of
my message is duplicated effort.  Oh well.  Hopefully
this message will offer an alternative to anyone who
just doesn't "get it" from Bob's explanation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've probably flubbed some of the numbers in my example when
I "sanitized" them.  My address block is actually in the
0-31 range rather than the 32-63 range that I've described
here.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Last month I also wrote a lengthy treatise on subnetting
and routing.  Heather tells me it will get 
<a href="a.html">published this month</a>, along with many 
other messages.   Please
take a look at it since using proxyarp requires an
understanding of general routing and subnetting issues.
You'll understand proxyarp better if you compare it to
"normal" subnetting.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As you can see from my message the arp command is
easy.  It's just understanding the rest of the routing
that takes all the explanation.
