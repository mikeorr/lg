<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p>
<b>Yacc</b> ("Yet Another Compiler Compiler") is used to parse a language
described by a <b>context-free grammar</b>. Not all context-free languages can
be handled by Yacc or Bison and only those that are <b>LALR(1)</b> can be
parsed. To be specific, this means that it must be possible to tell how to
parse any portion of an input string with just a single token of look-ahead. I
will explain that clearly later in this article.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bison</b> is also a parser generator in the style of <b>Yacc</b>. 
It was written primarily by Robert Corbett and Richard Stallman 
made it Yacc compatible. There are differences between Bison and Yacc, 
but that is not the purpose of this article. 
</p>

<h2><b>Languages and Context-Free Grammars</b></h2>
<p>
Grammar can be associated with English language as a set of rules to 
construct meaningful sentences. We can say the same for context-free 
grammars. Almost all programming languages are based on context-free
grammars. The set of rules in any grammar will deal with syntactic 
groupings that will help in the construction of semantic structures. 
To be specific, it means that we specify one or more syntactic 
groupings and give rules for constructing them from their parts. For 
example in C: `expression' is one kind of grouping. One rule for making 
an expression is, "An expression can be made of a minus sign and 
another expression". Another would be, "An expression is an integer".
You must have noticed that the rules are recursive. In fact, every 
such grammar must then have a rule which leads out of the recursion. 
</p>
<p>
The most common formal system for representing such rules is the 
<b>Backus-Naur Form</b> or "BNF". All BNF grammars are context-free
grammars. 
</p>
<p>
In the grammatical rules for a language, we name a grouping as a symbol.
 Those symbols which can be sub-divided into smaller constructs are 
called non-terminals and those which cannot be subdivided are called 
terminals. If a piece of input is a single terminal then it is called a 
token and if it is a single nonterminal it is called a grouping. For 
example: `identifier', `number', `string' are distinguished as tokens, 
Whereas `expression', `statement', `declaration' and `function 
definition' are groupings in C language. Now, the full grammar may use 
additional language constructs with another set of nonterminal symbols. 
</p>

<h2><b>Basic Parsing Techniques</b></h2>
<p>
A parser for grammar G determines whether an input string say `w' is a 
sentence of G or not. If `w' is a sentence of G then the parser 
produces the parse tree for `w' otherwise, an error message is 
produced. By parse tree we mean a diagram that represents the syntactic 
structure of a string `w'. There are two basic types of parsers for 
context-free grammars - <b>bottom-up</b> and <b>top-down</b>, the former one 
being of our interest.
</p>
<h3><b>Bottom-Up Parsing</b></h3>
<p>
It is also known as <b>Shift-Reduce Parsing</b>. Here, attempts to 
construct a parse tree for an input begin at the leaves (bottom) and 
work up towards the root (top). In other words this will lead to a 
process of `reduction' of the input string to the start symbol of the 
grammar based on its production rules. For example, consider the 
grammar:
</p><p></p>
<pre>
<b><i>S -> aAcBe
A -> Ab/b
B -> d</i></b>
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
Let w = "abbcde". Our aim is to reduce this string `w' to 
<b><i>S</i></b>, where <b><i>S</i></b> is the start symbol. We scan 
"abbcde" looking for substrings that match the right side of some 
production. The substrings `b' and `d' qualify. Again there are 2 b's 
to be considered. Let us proceed with leftmost `b'. We replace it by 
`A' the left side of the production <b><i>A -> b</i></b>. The string 
has now become "aAbcde". We now see that `Ab', `b' and `d' each match 
the right side of some production. This time we will choose to replace
`Ab' by `A', the left side of the production <b><i>A -> Ab</i></b>. 
The string now becomes "aAcde". Then replacing `d' by `B', the left 
side of the production <b><i>B -> d</i></b>, we obtain "aAcBe". The 
entire string can now be replaced by <b><i>S</i></b>.
</p>
<p>
Basically, we are replacing the right side of a production by the left 
side the process being called a <i>reduction</i>. Quite easy! Not always. It 
sometimes so happen that, the substring that we choose to reduce may produce 
a string which is not decomposable to the start symbol <b><i>S</i></b>. 
</p>
The substrings that are the right side of a production and when replaced 
with the left side of that production in the input string that leads 
eventually to the start symbol is called a <b>`handle'</b>. Now, the process 
of bottom-up parsing may be viewed as one of finding and reducing `handles', 
the reduction sequence being known as <b>`handle pruning'</b>. 
</p>
<h4><b>Stack Implementation of Shift-Reduce Parsing</b></h4>
<p>
A convenient way to implement a shift-reduce parser is to use a stack and an 
input buffer. Let `$' symbol mark the bottom of the stack and the right end 
of the input. 
</p>

<p>
The main concept is to shift the input symbols onto the stack until a 
handle <font face=`Symbol'>b</font> is on top of the stack. Now we 
reduce <font face=`Symbol'>b</font> to the left side of the appropriate 
production. The parser repeats this cycle until it has detected an 
error or until the stack contains the start symbol and the input is 
empty:
</p>

<p>
In fact, there are four possible actions that a shift-reduce parser can
make and they are;
</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>In a <i>shift</i> action, the next input symbol is shifted to the top of 
the stack.
<li>In a <i>reduce</i> action, the parser knows that the right end of the 
handle is at the top of the stack. It must then locate the left end of the 
handle within the stack and decide with what nonterminal to replace the 
handle.
<li>In an <i>accept</i> action, the parser announces successful completion 
of parsing.
<li>In an <i>error</i> action, the parser discovers that a syntax error has 
occurred and calls an error recovery routine. 
</ol>
<p>
Let us see how these concepts are put into action in the example below.
</p>
<p>Consider the grammar below:</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
<b>E -> E + E
E -> E * E
E -> (E)
E -> id</b>
</pre>
<p>
Let the input string be 
<b>id<sub>1</sub> + id<sub>2</sub> * id<sub>3</sub></b>
</p>

<P> <A HREF="misc/ramankutty/figure1.png">Figure 1</A> </P>

<h4><b>Constructing a Parse Tree</b></h4>
<p>
The bottom-up tree construction process has two aspects.
</p>
<ol>
<li>When we shift an input symbol <i>a</i> onto the stack we create a 
one-node tree labeled <i>a</i>. Both the root and the yield of this tree 
are <i>a</i>, and the yield truly represents the string of terminals 
"reduced" (by zero reductions) to symbol <i>a</i>.
<li>When we reduce <i>X</i><sub>1</sub><i>X</i><sub>2</sub>...
<i>X</i><sub>n</sub> to <i>A</i>, we create a new node labeled <i>A</i>. Its 
children, from left to right, are the roots of the trees for 
<i>X</i><sub>1</sub>,<i>X</i><sub>2</sub>,...,<i>X</i><sub>n</sub>. If for 
all i<sup>i</sup> the tree for <i>X</i><sub>i</sub> has yield 
<i>x</i><sub>i</sub>, then the yield for the new tree is 
<i>x</i><sub>1</sub><i>x</i><sub>2</sub>...<i>x</i><sub>n</sub>. This string 
has in fact been reduced to <i>A</i> by a series of reductions culminating 
in the present one. As a special case, if we reduce <i>E</i> to <i>A</i> we 
create a node labeled <i>A</i> with one child labeled <i>E</i>.
</ol>

<h2><b>LR Parsing Algorithm</b></h2>
<p>
Construction of LALR parser requires the basic understanding of 
constructing an LR parser. LR parser gets its name because it scans the 
input from left-to-right and constructs a rightmost derivation in 
reverse. 
</p>
<p>
A parser generates a parsing table for a grammar. The parsing table 
consists of two parts, a parsing action function <b>ACTION</b> and a 
goto function <b>GOTO</b>. 
</p>
<p>
An LR parser has an input, a stack, and a parsing table.
The input is read from left to right, one symbol at a time. The stack 
contains a string of the form 
s<sub>0</sub>X<sub>1</sub>s<sub>1</sub>...X<sub>m</sub>s<sub>m</sub> 
where s<sub>m</sub> is on top. Each X<sub>i</sub> is a grammar symbol 
and each s<sub>i</sub> is a symbol called a state. Each state symbol 
summarizes the information contained in the stack below it and is used 
to guide the shift-reduce decision. 
</p>
<p>
The function <b>ACTION</b> stores values for s<sub>m</sub> that is 
topmost stack element and a<sub>i</sub> that is the current input 
symbol. The entry ACTION[s<sub>m</sub>, a<sub>i</sub>] can have one of 
four values:
</p>
<ol>
<li>shift s
<li>reduce A -&gt; <font face="symbol">B</font>
<li>accept
<li>error
</ol>
<p>
The function <b>GOTO</b> takes a state and grammar symbol as arguments 
and produces a state. Somewhat analogous to the transition table of a 
deterministic finite automaton whose input symbols are the terminals 
and nonterminals of the grammar. 
</p>
<p>
A <i>configuration</i> of an LR parser is a pair whose first component 
is the stack contents and whose second component is the unexpended 
input:
</p>
<p align=center>
(s<sub>0</sub> X<sub>1</sub> s<sub>1</sub> . . . X<sub>m</sub> s<sub>m</sub>, a<sub>i</sub> a<sub>i+1</sub> . . . a<sub>n</sub>$) </p>
<p>
The next move of the parser is determined by reading a<sub>i</sub>, the 
current input symbol, and s<sub>m</sub> the state on top of the stack, 
and then consulting the action table entry 
ACTION[s<sub>m</sub>, a<sub>i</sub>]. The four value mentioned above 
for action table entry will produce four different configurations as 
follows:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li> If ACTION[s<sub>m</sub>, a<sub>i</sub>] = shift s, the parser 
executes a shift move, entering the configuration 
<p align=center>
(s<sub>0</sub> X<sub>1</sub> s<sub>1</sub> . . . X<sub>m</sub> s<sub>m</sub> a<sub>i</sub> s, a<sub>i+1</sub> . . . a<sub>n</sub>$) </p> 
Here the configuration has shifted the current input symbol 
a<sub>i</sub> and the next state 
s = GOTO[s<sub>m</sub>, a<sub>i</sub>] onto the stack; 
a<sub>i+1</sub> becomes the new current input symbol.
<li>If ACTION[s<sub>m</sub>, a<sub>i</sub>] = 
reduce A - &gt; <font face="symbol">B</font>,then the parser 
executes a reduce a move, entering the configuration 

<p align=center>
(s<sub>0</sub> X<sub>1</sub> s<sub>1</sub> . . . X<sub>m-r</sub> s<sub>m-r</sub> A s, a<sub>i</sub> a<sub>i+1</sub> . . . a<sub>n</sub>$) </p>

where s = GOTO[s<sub>m-r</sub>, A] and r is the length of 
<font face="symbol">B</font>, the right side of the production. 
Here the first popped 2r symbols off the stack (r state symbols and r 
grammar symbols), exposing state s<sub>m-r</sub>. The parser then 
pushed both A, the left side of the production, and s, the entry for 
ACTION[s<sub>m-r</sub>, A], onto the stack. The current input symbol 
is not changed in a reduce move. Specifically, 
X<sub>m-r+1</sub> . . . X<sub>m</sub>, the sequence of grammar symbols 
are popped off the stack and will always match 
<font face="symbol">B</font>, the right side of the reducing 
production.
<li> If ACTION[s<sub>m</sub>, a<sub>i</sub>] = accept, parsing is 
completed.
<li> If ACTION[s<sub>m</sub>, a<sub>i</sub>] = error, the parser has 
discovered an error and calls an error recovery routine. 
</ol>
<p>
The LR parsing algorithm is simple. Initially the LR parser is in the 
configuration 
(s<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>n</sub>$) where 
s<sub>0</sub> is a designated intial state and 
a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>n</sub> is the string to be parsed. 
Then the parser executes moves until an accept or error action is 
encountered.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned earlier that the GOTO function is essentially the 
transition table of a deterministic finite automaton whose input 
symbols (terminals and nonterminals) and a state when taken as 
arguments produce another state. Hence the GOTO function can be 
represented by a graph (directed) like scheme, where each node or state
will be a set of items with elements that are productions in the 
grammar. The elements comprise the core of the items. The edges 
representing the transition will be labeled with the symbol for which 
the transition from one state to another is predetermined. 
</p>
<p>
In the LALR (<i>lookahead</i>-LR) technique, LR items with common core 
are coalesced, and the parsing actions are determined on the basis of 
the new GOTO function generated. The tables obtained are considerably 
smaller than the LR tables, yet most common syntactic constructs of 
programming languages can be expressed conveniently by LALR grammar.
</p>
<p>
I am not going deep into construction of tables. Instead, I would like
to explain the use of a tool called <b>Yacc</b> for parser generation.
</p>

<h2><b>Calculator Using Yacc</b></h2>
<p>
Input to Yacc can be divided into three sections:
</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>definitions sections that consists of token declarations, and C 
code bracketed by "%{" and "}%"
<li>the BNF grammar in the rules section
<li>and user subroutines in the subroutines section.
</ol>
<p></p>
<p>
We shall illustrate that by designing a small calculator that can 
add and subtract numbers. Let us start with the definitions section 
for the Yacc input file:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
/* File name - calc1.l*/
%{ 
	#include "y.tab.h"
	#include &lt; stdlib.h &gt;
	void yyerror(char *);
}%

%%

[0-9]+	{
		yylval = atoi(yytext);
		return INTEGER;
	}

[-+\n]	{
		return *yytext;
	}

[ \t]	;	/*skip whitespace*/

.	yyerror("Unknown character");

%%

int yywrap(void) {
	return 1;
}
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
Yacc when run generates a parser in the file <b>y.tab.c</b>, along side 
which another file <b>y.tab.h</b> is also generated. Lex includes this 
file and utilizes the definitions for token values. Lex returns the 
values associated with the tokens in variable <b>yylval</b>. But to get 
tokens, yacc calls <b>yylex</b> the return value of which is integer. 
</p>
<p>
The yacc input specification is given below:
</p>
<pre>
/* file name calc1.y */
%{
    int yylex(void);
    void yyerror(char *);
%}

%token INTEGER

%%

program:
        program expr '\n'         { printf("%d\n", $2); }
        |
        ;

expr:
        INTEGER
        | expr '+' expr           { $$ = $1 + $3; }
        | expr '-' expr           { $$ = $1 - $3; }
        ;

%%

void yyerror(char *s) {
    fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", s);
}

int main(void) {
    yyparse();
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
Here, the grammar is specified using productions. Left hand side of a 
production being a non terminal followed by a colon and then the right 
hand side of a production. The contents of the braces show the action 
associated with the productions. So what does the rules say ?
</p>
<p>
It says that a program consists of zero or more expressions. Each 
expression terminates with a newline. When a newline is detected, we 
print the value of the expression. 
</p>
<p>
Now execute yacc as shown:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
yacc -d calc1.l
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
You get a message "shift/reduce conflict". Shift/reduce conflict arises
when the grammar is ambiguous and there is a possibility of more than 
one derivation tree. To understand this, consider the example given in 
the stack implementation of shift-reduce parsing. In step 6, instead of 
shifting we could have reduced appropriately as per the grammar . Then 
addition will have higher precedence over multiplication.
</p>
<p>
Before proceeding you must know about another kind of conflict that is 
reduce-reduce conflict. This arises when there are more than one option 
for reducing a stack symbol. For example: In the grammar below 
<b>id</b> can be reduced to <b>T</b> or <b>E</b>.
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
E -&gt; T
E -&gt; id
T -&gt; id
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
Yacc takes a default action when conflicts arise. When there is 
shift-reduce conflict, yacc will shift and when there is reduce-reduce 
conflict, it will use the first rule in the listing. Yacc also issues a 
warning message when conflicts arise. Warnings can be eliminated by 
making the grammar unambiguous.
</p>
<p>
Coming back, yacc produces two files; <b>y.tab.c</b> and <b>y.tab.h</b>.
Some lines one has to notice are:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
#ifndef YYSTYPE
typedef int YYSTYPE
#endif
#define INTEGER 257
YYSTYPE yylval
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>
Internally, yacc maintains two stacks in memory; a parse stack and a 
value stack. The current parsing state is determined by the terminals 
and/or non terminals that are present in the parse stack. The value 
stack is always synchronized and holds an array of <b>YYSTYPE</b> 
elements, which associates a value with each element in the parse stack.
So for example, when lex returns an INTEGER token, yacc shifts this 
token to the parse stack. At the same time, the corresponding yylval is 
shifted to the value stack. This makes it easier in finding the value 
of a token at any given time.
</p>
<p>
So when we apply the rule
</p>
<p></p>
<pre>
expr: expr '+' expr	{ $$ = $1 + $3; }
</pre>
<p>
we pop <b>"expr '+' expr"</b> and replace it by <b>"expr"</b>. In other 
words we replace the right hand side of a production by left hand side 
of the same production. Here we pop three terms off the stack and push 
back one term. The value stack will contain "$1" for the first term on 
the right-hand side of the production, "$2" for the second and so on. 
"$$" designates the top of the stack after reduction has taken place. 
The above action adds the values associated with two expressions, pops 
three terms off the value stack, and pushes back a single sum. Thus the 
two stacks remain synchronized and when a newline is encountered, the 
value associated with <b>expr</b> is printed.
</p>
<p>
The last function that we need is a 'main'. But the grammar is 
ambiguous and yacc will issue shift-reduce warnings and will process 
the grammar using shift as the default operation. 
</p>
<p>
I am not giving the function here because there is more to learn. 
I shall come up with that in the next part. I shall also explain how 
to remove ambiguity from the grammar and then design the calculator 
for it. In fact, some more funcionalities shall be incorporated into 
the grammar to have a better understanding.
