    <H2>Installing StarOffice 4.0 on RedHat 5.1</H2>

    <P></P>
    
    <P>Today while shopping, I found StarOffice 4.0 (Commercial version) at a
      local cdrom shop. I already own (and use) ApplixWare, but I could not
      resist - given the usually positive reviews, I just *had* to try it. </P>
    
    <P>Please note that <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com">Caldera</A> currently
      has a special on StarOffice 4.0 - $49.95US. That is an excellent price for
      a commercial license. Also note that StarOffice is available via ftp
      without cost for non-commercial use.</P>
    
    <P>I wanted to see how it would perform on a fairly low performance system,
      so I loaded it onto my server. In order to benefit others, I thought I
      would document my installation. I will use it for a few days, after which
      I will write a review on my 'user' experiences.</P>
    
    <H3>The Software</H3>
    
    <P>StarOffice comes on two cd's, in a jewel case. The first CD contains
      StarOffice and also appears to contain OpenLinux Lite along with some
      additional contrib packages. The second CD, a pleasant surprise, appears
      to be OpenLinux Base. This means I will have a busy couple of nights - I'm
      going to have to try out OpenLinux. </P>
    
    <H3>The Computer</H3>
    
    <UL>
      <LI>Tyan Titan-II motherboard (Socket 5, 256k sync cache) </LI>
      <LI>WinChip 200Mhz (yes, it does work in single voltage motherboards!)</LI>
      <LI>S3-968 video card, 4Mb of VRAM running at 1024x768x16M</LI>
      <LI>32Mb FPM memory, 127Mb swap</LI>
      <LI>24x Panasonic cdrom</LI>
      <LI>6.4Gb Quantum ST</LI>
      <LI>DLINK 500TX 10/100Mbps 10BaseT, running at 10Mbps</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <H3>The Operating System</H3>
    
    <UL>
      <LI>RedHat 5.1</LI>
      <LI>reasonably up to date with updates from RedHat</LI>
    </UL>
    
    <H3>The Installation<BR>
    </H3>
    
    <P>I read the instructions - and the 'README' file. I logged in using my
      regular user account, went to /mnt/cdrom/StarOffice_40, and entered
      './setup'.</P>
    
    <P>After the installation program started up, I got the infamous dialog &quot;line
      1: syntax error at token 'I' expected declarator; i.e. File...&quot;
      prompting me to press ok.</P>
    
    <P>In all honesty, I must admit I was expecting this problem - I remember
      people asking for help with this very same problem while reading the Linux
      news groups. I went to <A HREF="http://www.dejanews.com">Dejanews</A> to
      find out how people solved this problem.</P>
    
    <P>I used &quot;Staroffice 4.0 RedHat 5.1&quot; as my search string, and
      got 61 matches. </P>
    
    <H3>First Try</H3>
    
    <P>The very first match was a posting from Simon Gao, who on July 27 wrote:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>This is a well known problem with RedHat 5.x. The problem is
      that StarOffice4 requires libc.5.4.28 above file system. Check out at
      <A HREF="http://www.waldherr.org/soffice/">www.waldherr.org/soffice</A>
      and you find how to solve this problem.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P>Off I went to Stefan Waldherr's
      <A HREF="http://www.waldherr.org/soffice/">web site</A>. There I found
      that the version of StarOffice I purchased today is already outdated - and
      that I should download the latest version. As most people who purchase the
      commercial StarOffice package will get the same version I got (and as I
      did not want to wait to download 4.0.3 yet) I just downloaded the
      staroffice wrapper and proceeded  to see if I could install 4.0 as shipped
      on the CD.</P>
    
    <P>I become root to install the rpm. The rpm would not install,  I was
      treated to an error message: </P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>Error during install, staroffice tar file not found.<BR>
      Looking for any of the following files or directories<BR>
      /tmp/so40sp3_lnx_01.tar.gz<BR>
      /tmp/so40sp3_lnx_01.tar.gz</BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P>Since I *REALLY* did not want to download 4.0.3 yet, I got stubborn.</P>
    
    <H3>Second Try</H3>
    
    <P>I looked through some more messages, and based on the information I
      found, I tried the following:</P>
    
    <P>I ftp'd libc-5.4.46-1rh42.i386.rpm from ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/i386,
      and tried to instal it.</P>
    
    <P>I got a &quot;failed dependencies: ld.so &gt;= 1.9.9 is needed by
      libc-5.4.46-1rh42.i386.rpm&quot; message. </P>
    
    <P>Good thing I kept my ftp session open. I now ftp'd
      ld.so-1.9.9-1rh42.i386.rpm. This time I got a pile of glibc conflicts.
      Nope, there *HAS* to be a simpler way.</P>
    
    <H3>Conclusion: Third Time Lucky</H3>
    
    <P>Back to the drawingboard - or DejaNews, as the case may be. I found an
      article by Tommy Fredriksson, originally posted in
      stardivision.com.support.unix. Tommy wrote:</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>In article &lt;35A4B35E.CAA00699@actech.com.br&gt;<BR>
       wrote:<BR>
      &gt; I just got StarOffice 4.0 ServicePack 3 but I can't run on my RedHat
      Linux <BR>&gt; 5.1 box, it shows that dreaded &quot;line 1 syntax error at token 'l'&quot;,
      etc. RH <BR>&gt; 5.1 is libc6-based (glibc), but I also put libc-5 on my /lib
      directory. <BR>&gt; Even this would not make it work. Could someone help me on this? <BR><BR>
      Put your &quot;libc-pack&quot; anywhere you can find it - tell
      /etc/ld.so.conf (on top) where you put it and run ldconfig -v and look for
      errors - if non, install SO. That's all...</BLOCKQUOTE>
    
    <P>Based on this message, I improvised. To save all of you some work, here
      are some step by step instructions on how to install StarOffice 4.0 on
      RedHat 5.1:</P>
    <OL>
      <LI>Go to <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/GCC/">http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/GCC/</A>
      </LI>
      <LI>cd to the home directory of the user you are installing it for</LI>
      <LI>download libc-5_4_46_bin_tar.gz into the current directory</LI>
      <LI>become root</LI>
      <LI>mkdir ~/tmp</LI>
      <LI>cd ~/tmp </LI>
      <LI>tar xvfz ../libc-5_4_46_bin_tar.g</LI>
      <LI>cd lib</LI>
      <LI>cp * /lib</LI>
      <LI>edit /etc/ld.so.conf</LI>
      <LI>add a new line at the top, &quot;/lib&quot; (without the quotes)</LI>
      <LI>ldconfig -v</LI>
      <LI>go back to the normal user session under X (stop being root)</LI>
      <LI>cd /mnt/cdrom/StarOffice_40</LI>
      <LI>./setup</LI>
      <LI>follow the prompts - I chose custom install, and let it install
        everything.</LI>
      <LI>you can safely remove ~/tmp after you have installed StarOffice</LI>
    </OL>
    
    <H3>It Works!</H3>
    
    <P>Following the README, I typed Office40/bin/soffice. After some disk
      activity, it ran! Note, I did not time how long it took, but it seemed
      like 20-30 seconds. </P>
    
    <P>I chose to create a new document. I resized the window, and docked the
      paragraph style floating bar on the left hand side. The text in the
      default view was pretty poor, so I chose the 'Optimal' view (why don't
      they default to Optimal?) under the 'View' menu. This looked much better.</P>
    
    <P>I proceeded to type a few lines, and chose to print. I let it print as
      if to a PostScript printer. Lo and behold, my HP4L printed out the text
      quite nicely!</P>
    
    <H3>Conclusion</H3>
    
    <P>I am afraid that a review of StarOffice will have to wait for another
      day. So far, I like what I see, however I will only be able to
      intelligently comment on its features after using it for a while.</P>
    
    <P>Caldera or StarDivison has to make installation easier. I fully intend
      to try OpenLinux, and I am sure that the StarOffice installation will be much
      smoother than under RedHat. At this point, a Linux beginner who tried to
      install StarOffice on a RedHat system, and was not used to using excellent
      resources such as Dejanews, would have a very frustrating experience. </P>
    
    <P>The fine help available on the net from individuals like Tommy
      Fredriksson, Stefan Waldherr and many others, makes a mockery of the
      assertion that Linux has no support. I hope their postings and this
      article will save some time for those trying Linux for the first time.</P>
    
    <P>I hope you enjoyed this article,</P>
