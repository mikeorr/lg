I think fuse is something like KDE's kio system.
</p>

<p>
For example, type ftp://ftp.iitm.ac.in in Konqueror's location bar,then 
Konqueror will open that ftp site as a filesystem, just like curlftpfs did.

I don't have much experience with 'kio', but that's what FTP has always
done - in Konqueror or pretty much any other browser. Whether you use
Mozilla to log into your server (via e.g.,
ftp://name:password@my.server.foo), or a standard FTP client, you get
access to the FTP structure as a filesystem.

Relatively recently, there's also been support for FISH - much the same
as above, except with SSH (which I like quite a lot.) FUSE appears to me
to simply extend the metaphor, allowing other things (Flickr, etc.) to
be used as filesystems. I agree that it's not a 100% new,
completely-from-scratch idea - but few things are. We're all standing on
some very tall giants' shoulders.

A hurd (couln't resist it!) of them.
</p>

<p>
However, I think that the querent has fused (resistance is useless
<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">) two slightly different notions.
</p>

<p>
1. One is a library (kio or gnomevfs is essentially that) which
provides applications that link with it with a unified "URL-style"
namespace as a way of accessing different "file-like" objects. The
"ange-ftp" elisp library was also similar.
</p>

<p>
2. The other is a kernel module like "fuse" or "lufs" adds a branch
to the kernel's namespace to give "file-system-like" access to
"file-like" objects. This extended namespace is seen by <strong>all</strong> programs
run by the user.
</p>

<p>
You would use the first when you can ensure (by using KDE/GNOME/Emacs
applications respectively) that all your applications will go through
the same library.
</p>

<p>
You would use the second when you do not want to worry about this
issue.
</p>

<p>
A preload library that intercepts all file-system calls by
applications could transform 1 into something like 2 but I haven't
seen one yet.
</p>

<p>

P.S. The authors of these programs disagree somewhat Shakespeare and
think that namespaces are important.
Would we find the rose (let alone enjoy its smell) if it was not
among the flowers?

If it looked like a top-quality steak, smelled like one, and tasted like
one, I don't know that I'd find any reason to complain... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
