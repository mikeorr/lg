Presuming that it did have one, and had a reasonable identifier, it
looks like your card's not readable. Assuming that there's no "protect"
switch on it - you did look for one, right? - I suspect that it has
failed. That is, it can be read enough to determine its physical
characteristics - I don't know how the two processes differ, I only know
that they do - but you can't access its storage. In other words, it's
junk.

<p>
Try a raw read.

# See if you can copy the first 512 bytes
sudo dd if=/dev/sdc of=/tmp/mbr bs=512 count=1
 
# If that succeeds, then back it up, <strong>quick!</strong>
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/tmp/sdc_backup.raw bs=4096

Oh, that sucks. You could try 'conv=noerror' as an argument to 'dd',
just to see if you can recover <em>something</em> - but in my experience with
flash media, once you lose a block, you've lost it all. As (I think)
Ren&eacute; mentioned, these gadgets (or the relevant circuitry, anyway) do
their own error correction, so by the time you actually see errors,
things are well beyond the recovery stage. I can't decide whether the
pre-ECC approach (which required a hard format every 6 months or so) or
the current approach (complete and utter brain and heart death before
you see even a single failure) is "better", for whatever that means... I
only know what the OEMs went with, the "state of the state". Which is
"don't expect anything good if you haven't backed up."

&gt; 
&gt; Too bad they didn't implement something analogous to the IDE early
&gt; failure detection system S.M.A.R.T. for these devices!
</pre>

<p>
I like the idea behind S.M.A.R.T., but it's something that needs to be
applied at the system level, not at the user level, where they seem to
have left it. Users either don't know about it, have heard of it and
think it's too technical, or know how to handle it and simply forget.
S.M.A.R.T. is quite nifty - but I feel like it's dying a lonely death
due to incorrect positioning (or lack of implementation by vendors and
such.) That's a shame.

&gt; 
&gt; Applying S.M.A.R.T. more at operating system level would be nice, but
&gt; I've noticed it does seem to be checked at bios level quite a lot.
</pre>

<p>
Yeah, there's some implementation at that level, and it's always nice to
see. I just wish it was universal; it's such a nicely-designed system,
and would be of great help in many situations (would prevent a lot of
data loss.)
</p>


<pre>
&gt; For instance, just last week my motherboard started prompting me every
&gt; time I booted that one of my HDDs could be nearing failure, it's now
&gt; replaced without any lost data.
</pre>

<p>
Isn't that lovely? That's how it should be - and easily could be, if
vendors would get off their butts and make a couple of tiny, essentially
no-cost changes.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; One can also use smartd to regularly check hard drives.  That requires
&gt; the user to check the system log for errors every now and then though.
</pre>

<p>
Actually, there are some Linux utilities (that I should remember to set
up sometime soon...) that pop up S.M.A.R.T.-triggered messages right on
your desktop. I don't recall the names at the moment, but they're part
of pretty much every distro out there.

&gt; It sounds funny, but some disks give clear audio signals when failing.
&gt; Hearing what my data does has saved documents, too. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
I wouldn't rely on it always happening, but - yep, HDs quite often do
let you know that they're about to fail. If you hear your drive doing
something that it wasn't doing before, and it does so on a consistent
(or even worse, progressive) basis, you should PAY ATTENTION.
