<p><strong>From Benjamin A. Okopnik</strong></p>
<p><strong>Are you feeling especially contentious this week, or
what?</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] Not that I've
noticed.</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height=
"28" width="50" border="0"> OK; just wondering. 'Cause, y'know, you
might have been wrestling a lot this week or
something.</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] <a name=
"sluggo1.1"></a> That was three weeks ago. Delayed reaction? OK,
here's the summary I wrote notes for but never got around to
finalizing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Went to the Okie Rumble, a wrestling retreat in
Oklahoma City. This was its ninth year but the first I attended.
Also the first time I'd been to the south central part of the
country. (OKC is 200 miles north of Dallas, and some 600 miles
south of Fargo, North Dakota.) There were 110 attendees. Most came
from the southeast (Louisiana, Georgia, Florida) and NYC, but there
was one from Portland, one from Vancouver BC, and one from England.
(Other Europeans were going to come but got hit by a new $300 fee
for a tourist visa, thank you Homeland Security.) Most had wrestled
in high school or college but some like me had picked it up
recently. Most now do submission wrestling (like Brazilian
jiu-jitsu) or mixed martial arts (like UFC), but some thirty people
did pro wrestling (like WWE). There were also a few freestyle
(Olympic style) matches, at least one boxing match, and two guys
brought their gi's (Oriental jackets) and did jiu-jitsu. I had
seven submission matches. Most with people better than me but a
couple with beginners. Everyone is good about teaching stuff to the
less knowledgeable so there's kind of a downward flow of
learning.</blockquote>
<blockquote>It took place at a gay hotel in OKC. They took the
furniture out of six rooms and put down 10'x10' mats. Most matches
were one-on-one though sometimes three or four people would take
turns. I didn't like having all those little rooms. At Hillside
(another retreat in Pennsylvania), everyone is all in one place and
the mats are larger and communal, so anytime you want to wrestle
there's always mat space. Here you had to schedule an hour slot a
half-day in advance, so you lose out on matches that can't be
scheduled. But large open spaces are rare and expensive, and even
if you find a warehouse you still need living accommodations for
out-of-towners.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I did a submission match with a guy who does mostly pro
(from St Louis), and he told me the history of professional (=fake)
wrestling. It didn't start with WWE but goes back to at least the
1800s. Paying audiences watched real wrestling and fake wrestling
side by side but weren't told the difference. (In pro wrestling,
the "victim" actually does the movement, the perp just pretends to
beat him up but stops short, which is an athletic feat in itself.)
There were also fake bareknuckles boxing matches people bet on. It
was an inside secret until [some pro wrestler] wrote a book in the
1970s exposing the fakery. Suddenly audiences vanished and local
pro wrestling clubs folded (except in St Louis). Vince McMahon,
owner of WWE (then WWF), responded by making it sillier -- guys in
plumbers' outfits, chairs, etc -- to hold an audience.</blockquote>
<blockquote>That part I didn't understand. I detest WWE and its
crap, but I've seen enough amateur pro-wrestling demonstrations to
have respect for it. It lets people act out aggressions they can't
do in real life, and some of the storylines are funny as hell.
Especially when you have real wrestlers watching it, who know it's
fake but are egging them on anyway. But still, I hope UFC wipes WWE
off the screen. <a href="#sluggo1.2">&raquo;</a></blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] I doubt it, from what
little I've seen of UFC. WWE is... a soap opera with fighting
(uh... better fights <img src="../../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=
":)" height="24" width="20" align="middle">, UFC just looks like a
bar brawl.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] It can look like a
brawl if you don't understand what they guys are doing, but it's
quite organized. It (pankration) is a combination of wrestling and
kickboxing. One guy puts the other guy in standard submission holds
until he taps out (symbolically gives up).</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] Well, any time I saw it
the rounds ended after one put another in a submission hold and
punched 'til the referee sent him back to his corner.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] That is how it often
ends. I wouldn't call that a bar brawl. I don't know about the
referee "sending him back to his corner". That might happen on a
technicality or to investigate an apparent injury, but I don't
think it's routine. The ref will move the fighters if they're too
close to the edge of the ring, but he usually keeps them in their
same relative positions.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] I meant at the end of
the round/fight.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] Actually, both BJJ and
UFC were more brutal than they are now. BJJ was 'vale tudo'
(anything goes), and UFC didn't have rounds. But they had to tone
it down to avoid getting it banned in the US. In Brazil you can
have a full-on fight in the street but in the US you'd get arrested
for that, so there's a difference in culture. But I've heard that
even Brazil has tightened things up the past couple years. So it
kind of parallels the Greek experience of more brutal to less
brutal. I don't know how old the videos are you saw.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another thing is that even if you wonder why somebody
would want their face pounded, those guys live for it. At the
amateur level they're not paid, so you really have to want to be
there.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] Aside from that, it's
not going to replace WWE any time soon. WWE may be fake, but it's
more interesting to watch, if only for the acrobatics.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] <a name="sluggo1.2"
href="#sluggo1.1">&laquo;</a> The referee watches closely and stop
the match if one guy can't defend himself any more, or if the other
guy breaks the rules. There are three or four rounds, not fifteen
like in some boxing matches, and you don't go till the guy is
knocked unconscious. It's safer than American football because
you're not colliding with the guy at thirty miles an hour. Injuries
during deliberate holds are rare because (1) they're designed for
maximum pain but minimum injury, and (2) the guy is supposed to
tap. There are several tournaments like UFC, the biggest being
Pride FC in Japan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the early 1900s, the Gracie family in Brazil learned
jiu-jitsu from a Japanese master. They combined it with
streetfighting techniques and created the sport of Brazilian
jiu-jitsu. In the 1990s they set up schools in the US, knowing it
would be a big hit because there was nothing like it here. UFC was
started around the same time although I'm not sure exactly how.
Early UFC was all about "Which style is best?", matching opponents
from different martial arts backgrounds (including wrestling and
boxing). The BJJ guys used UFC to prove their style was the best.
<a href="#sluggo1.3">&raquo;</a></blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] IIRC, there are two
Gracie school ATM (family feud).</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] ATM != bank
machine?</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] "At the
moment"</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] There are several
families of schools with different Gracie names. I don't know about
a feud.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] Well... maybe it's
resolved now. I read that when they (well, some of them) were in
Sepultura's "Attitude" video, which was 8 or 9 years ago--I just
didn't think until now about how long ago that was.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] I don't follow the
Gracies closely, so they could have had a feud for all I know. I
was at one Gracie school for a short time, but it was pretty much
just a franchise name. I attend an independent BJJ school now, but
only because it's a good place to learn submission skills, not
because I'm interested in BJJ per se.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] "Real" Jiu jitsu
practitioners tend to look down on Gracie Jiu jitsu, because it has
all the vicious stuff removed.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] <a name="sluggo1.3"
href="#sluggo1.2">&laquo;</a> They mostly succeeded, although it
showed certain weaknesses in the BJJ technique (no stand-up boxing
skills). Then everybody started cross training, and eventually a
"pankration style" developed, which you can learn specifically and
is what UFC is now. But to be really good you'd take additional
training in specific fields (freestyle wrestling for takedowns, BJJ
for ground work, boxing for stand-up work, and [insert Oriental
martial art here]).</blockquote>
<blockquote>Pankration was the main sport in the ancient Olympics.
There's a modified version in the modern Olympics (no stand-up
hitting?), <a href="#sluggo1.4">&raquo;</a></blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] I should hope so.
Pankration was originally a fight to the death, no?</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] I've heard different
things about that. Killing the opponent would be the ultimate
victory, but you can't do it every time or there would be no
opponents left. More importantly, there would be no soldiers to
defend the city. (I think there were several styles practiced
simultaneously, only some of them to the death. Also, there were an
increasing number of people growing up maimed, and that led the
Greeks to impose more rules to prevent people's lives from being
wasted.<br>
Obviously if they're maimed they're not dead, so the match couldn't
have been to the death.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] Whoops. I meant "in
tournaments". Heh. I can just picture the ancient Greek school
kids:</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>
"Where's &lt;insert Ancient Greek name here&gt;? Isn't he joining us for lunch?"
"We just had pankration..."
"Ah".
</pre></blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] There's a book you
might like, <em>The Machine</em> by Ian Freeman. He's a British
boxer/bouncer turned UFC fighter.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] I think I've read an
article or two of his, though most of the prominent British martial
arts writers have been bouncers at some stage.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] He's kind of arrogant
in the book but it's still a good read. He grew up in Sunderland
which I guess is a rough place. He said they had bar fights every
night, with people coming just fight the bouncers. I found it hard
to believe but he writes, "I know you don't believe it but it's
true, I swear. It was much rougher in the 80s." I couldn't
understand how the police could visit a bar several times a week
(or even once a month) and not have its liquor license pulled.
Maybe the laws are more strict here.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] I'm not sure if it was
the same in England, but over here in the 80s there were extremely
high levels of unemployment, and most of the time it looked like
people were starting fights because they lacked any other form of
entertainment.</blockquote>

it?</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] The bouncers in England
seem to be much bigger on average than the ones here, but maybe the
problems are bigger. (All those football fans.) I saw so many bars
with two huge bodybuilders outside the door. My thoughts were, (1)
where do they find so many of those guys?</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] Big guys are easy to
find: rugby players and the like.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] (2) does it really take
two to deter people at the door?</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] Yes. If nothing else,
you need one guy to stand in front of the security camera. In
general, though, the bouncers (at least in Ireland) tend to be very
pleasant: big is not the same as strong, or able to fight, and you
never know how many brothers/cousins/etc. a guy has.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] (3) Why isn't one of
them inside watching the joint since that's where most of the
problems will be?</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] No, most of the trouble
will be at the door, because they're to stop known trouble makers
from getting in in the first place.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] Our bars just have one
average-looking guy out front, and the only reason he's there is
because the state insists he check the ages on IDs. Unless the bar
is large, he's also the security guy.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] In most of the pubs in
Ireland, the regulars double as security -- they don't want their
favourite pub messed up. In any place that has a nightclub licence
(some pubs get them, to stay open later), you'll have at least 4
bouncers at the weekend: 2 at the door, 2 inside.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] <a name="sluggo1.4"
href="#sluggo1.3">&laquo;</a> but it's not shown on US TV because
figure skating and synchronized swimming are so much more
important.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There's a TV show "Ultimate Fighter" that shows how the
guys train. I don't have cable so I haven't seen it. But one of the
guys, Chris Leben, is from Portland. He used to come up to
Washington to fight in the amateur tournaments. We have a
good-natured rivalry with his school (Team Quest) because of course
Washington is better than Oregon. <img src=
"../../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=":)" height="24" width="20"
align="middle"> Now he comes up to sell T-shirts. The tournament
organizer invited him to stand in the ring as a VIP and said, "He
used to fight here. But he ended up beating all our guys. Now he's
on to bigger things."</blockquote>
<blockquote>The amateur tournaments normally have pankration
matches intermixed with kickboxing, and sometimes muay thai or
regular boxing.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Wrestling is disappearing in American colleges due to
Title IX, a law that under some interpretations requires an equal
number of slots for men and women in sports. So the colleges drop
wrestling to avoid getting sued. (There are few women wrestlers,
though there are more women pankrationists than you might expect.)
Wrestling remains big in the midwest colleges and Oklahoma because
there are so many multigenerational wrestling families and it's a
moneymaking sport, but it never caught on much in the northwest
where football subsidizes all the other sports. But as it
disappears from the colleges it's been popping up in the martial
arts schools, as people want to cross train. So that could be its
dominant place in twenty years. <a href=
"#sluggo1.5">&raquo;</a></blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] Wrestling is pretty big
in Poland, as I found out one night. Long story short, growing up
with brothers close to your own age beats (rules-abiding)
wrestling.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Kat] Er. Mike, maybe I misread
you, but it <em>looks</em> like you just said that each sport is
required to have equal numbers of slots for men and
women.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Sluggo] Not each sport, but
over the total number of sports at a school.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The proponents say Title IX does not impose quotas, but
in practice one school after another has dropped wrestling out of
fear of a lawsuit. In Washington there are some seven universities
and a couple dozen community colleges with sports teams. All had
wrestling in the 60s. Now only two community colleges have it. The
UW still has the padded room, and could restart it immediately if
the legal situation were straighened out. Oregon and California
have held out better but are still losing teams
rapidly.</blockquote>
<blockquote>What happens is, women's slots remain empty because not
that many are interested in sports, even with full scholarships. So
they cut the number of men's slots by a like amount, and wrestling
is an easy target. Not basketball, because the number of men and
women playing basketball are similar. A sane person would say, have
as many slots as there are people interested, of either gender, and
leave it at that.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Kat] Just for reference, here's
what Title IX requires</blockquote>
<table width="95%" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">
<tr>
<td>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<blockquote>Title IX governs the overall equity of treatment and
opportunity in athletics while giving schools the flexibility to
choose sports based on student body interest, geographic influence,
budget restraints, and gender ratio. In other words, it is not a
matter of women being able to participate in wrestling or that
exactly the same amount of money is spent per women's and men's
basketball player. Instead, the focus is on the necessity for women
to have equal opportunities as men on a whole, not on an individual
basis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In regard to intercollegiate athletics, there are three
primary areas that determine if an institution is in
compliance:</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>athletic financial assistance</li>
<li>accommodation of athletic interests &amp; abilities</li>
<li>other program areas</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Appraisal of compliance is on a program-wide basis, not
on a sport-by-sport basis.</blockquote>
<blockquote>While many resources have been written specific for
intercollegiate sports, the general components of Title IX apply to
interscholastic sport as well.</blockquote>

job, you see. But as heels got paired with jobbers so frequently
the terms got distorted to "winner" and "loser".</blockquote>
<blockquote>He also showed me the difference between a choke hold
and a sleeper hold. A choke has the arm in front of the neck (to
block the air), while the sleeper has the elbow in front (to block
the veins on the side). That's good to know because I was doing
sleepers thinking they were chokes. Somebody had told me "always
keep your elbow in front", which turned out to be
wrong.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another guy I had a submission match with had an
unusual philosophy. He'd learned wrestling along with visualization
techniques. So whenever I got frustrated and started muscling my
way through, he'd say, "Stop, breathe. Think about your quiet place
[the place where you'd felt most tranquil in your life; e.g., a
wood or seashore]." I recognized it as a combination of yoga and
the visualization competitive wrestlers do. It works. It calms you

imaginary opponent: visualisation.</blockquote>

several other martial arts, wrote a book explaining how many of the

was setting things up, along with two locals. He asked what I'd
heard about Oklahoma. I said, "Wheat fields and the Dust Bowl. You
never hear about Oklahoma in the news." Except for the bombing, he
reminded me. He asked what the price of gas was in Seattle. I said,
"$2.80 regular, $3.10 premium." They were shocked and said it's

a couple minutes. Drop spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet (or use
cutters for a precise shape). Bake at 450*F for 8-10 minutes.
Biscuits were common in colonial times as a quick bread, but
nowadays on the west coast they're mostly a breakfast item, served
with butter, jam, or honey. In the South they're also served with
dinner, and if there's a Kentucky Fried Chicken near you, they
serve a biscuit with the chicken. (I did see packages of fried
chicken and biscuits at a deli in OKC. And packages of ribs to
go.)</blockquote>

tables were small, high, and round, and the diagonal legs came down
to a point.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Growing up, food was like the Oklahoma meals minus the
gravy and ribs, and with less emphasis on grains. I'd totally
forgotten about that. I remember several months ago pondering what
was American food and then thinking, "*Is* there any American
food?" It took a while to remember: "Burgers and pizza, of course!"
But now when my office pools for takeout lunch, it's "Teriyaki,
Thai, or Chinese?" At home it's a plain chicken, plain fish, or
pho. Breakfast is eggs and toast, or cereal. Though I <em>do</em>
have pizza once or twice a week, like any red-blooded American.

South is the lack of buses. Too socialist, I guess. So I took a
taxi from the airport, which I never do if I can avoid it. It would
have been $50 to go downtown and back in a taxi, so I didn't. But
there's a bombing memorial downtown, and outside of town is the
Wrestling Hall of Fame at a university. Maybe next year I'll see
those.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A gay hotel in Oklahoma City is an uncommon thing, and
it's the only one for several surrounding states. I told the taxi
driver to take me to the Habana Inn and he looked at me strangely
for a long moment. The dispatcher joked to him, "I'll take him if
you don't want to." I didn't give a f**k what they thought but it
was hilarious. OKC isn't quite as homophobic as Reverend "God Hates

hang out on balconies are panhandlers or drug dealers, so it was
unnerving for a day until I realized they were well behaved and not
pushy. I attributed this to local tradition, but another wrestler
pointed out, "They don't know if we'll beat the shit out of them."

The Outback Steakhouse, a pseudo-authentic Australian restaurant in
the States.</strong></p>
<p><strong>""Bloomin' Onion". In this, the Outback has outdone even
the Australian propensity for irreverence with its use of
expletives to name menu dishes. This could well be the appeal! They
advertise themselves as "Home of the Bloomin' Onion" and are
justifiably proud of this creation; a deep-fried battered onion cut
to resemble a flower..."</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Despite their best efforts at helpful translations, the
Outback still has the potential to confuse the locals. I got a good
laugh when an Asian-American (ESL) friend related that on a visit
to the Outback he had to ask the waiter which toilet (restroom) to
use, as he couldn't sort out the "Blokes" from the "Sheilas". They
might want to put those international stick figures back on the
doors."</strong></p>

240 volts vs 120</strong></p>
<p><strong>It says all Australian outlets have wall switches,
because it's supposedly too unsafe to pull a live cord from a
240-volt outlet. Why did I not see these switches in Europe then?
Or did I just fail to notice them?</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Jimmy] It's about 50-50
here.</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height=
"28" width="50" border="0"> Here about the only outlets that have
switches are living rooms without a built-in light. The idea is
that you'll have a lamp that precisely matches your decor
preferences. This was popular in 70s construction. It's irritating
if you (1) don't have a lamp, or (2) don't want to put a table in
that location, because you have to walk across a dark room to turn
on your other lamp. And most portable lamps don't adequately light
the room unless you have lots of them, so you end up with a couple
lighted areas in a sea of darkness.</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
height="28" width="50" border="0"> [Kat] Have you tried those cheap
"indirect" halogen torchieres that IKEA sells for around $19.99? I
found that those answered both the "enough light" and "don't want
to put a table there" problems back when I needed to light
built-in-the-80's condos.</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height=
"28" width="50" border="0"> Ah yes, they solve the light problem.
But they're 300 watts and burn hot, so not only they use a lot of
electricity but are a fire hazard.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="../../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height=
"28" width="50" border="0"> Slightly less irritating are bedrooms
with a dinky ceiling light over the closet, so again you have to
use a lot of (space-consuming) lamps or curse the darkness. I've
been living in pre-1930s construction for most of the past 16 years
(my current apartment was built in 1903), and it doesn't have such
nonsense. Every room has a ceiling light in the center that lights
the whole room.</strong></p>

Check the "frankenswitch" -- something you'd see out of a horror
movie. All I remember of it now is that when you used to move the
switch to turn the power on, you would hear a 60Hz hum and sparks
would fly when the switch made contact for a few seconds. I've
never seen ANYTHING like it in Australia!" (This would be the main
switch you see in older houses, upstream from all the fuses. A big
knife switch. Um, what do old Australian houses have
instead?)</strong></blockquote>

<p><strong>"Taxi etiquette is the classic example of Australians'
aversion to superiority. If you hop in the back seat of a taxi, the
driver will perceive you to be condescendingly taking on the role
of master with chauffer. So most people sit in the front. This is a
behaviour in sharp contrast with American custom. Here, the driver
expects you to sit in the backseat, and would consider it a
threatening action if you were to hop in the front. You have more
opportunity to poke a gun in his ribs and demand his cash. (A
similar contrast is found in what is considered to be proper
behaviour when the police pull you over in your car. In Australia
it is considered polite to get out of your vehicle, as a gesture of
meeting the officer halfway. In America such behaviour is
considered threatening and could get you shot. The best procedure
is to stay seated with your hands on the wheel.)"</strong></p>

Anne experiences her second earthquake</strong></p>
<p><strong>"...earthquakes are the Bigfoot of natural disasters,
resistant to prediction, manipulation, or control, the only ones
still defying both the imagination and the photograph. A
hurricane's giant waves and black skies send witnesses dashing for
cameras, but the first tremor of an earthquake sends them running
for their lives. Earthquake photographs show an aftermath of
fissures, landslides, and pan caked expressways - but those of the
event itself are invariably disappointing, just blurred buildings
or panicked shoppers caught by a security camera. People say their
refrigerators danced and their palm trees kissed the ground, but
where is the proof? The National Geographic Society has installed
video cameras aimed at bar stools and couches in earthquake-prone
Parkfield, California, setting them to begin filming at the first
nudge, but film what? Crashing gin bottles and falling chimneys?
And how will this help anyone imagine an earthquake? -- Thurston

<blockquote>Bigmac stared at the car. He'd seen ones like it on
television.... The keys were still in the ignition. Bigmac wasn't a
criminal, he was just, around, when things happened. This was
because of stupidity. Other people's stupidity. Mainly other
people's stupidity in designing cars that would go from nought to
120 miles an hour in ten seconds, and selling them to even more
stupid people who were only interested in dull things like fuel
consumption and what color the seats were.... The keys were still
in the ignition. As far as Bigmac was concerned, he was practically
doing the people a favor by really seeing what their cars could do.
No way was that stealing. Because he always put the cars back if he
could, and they were often [in] nearly the same shape. You'd think
people would be <em>proud</em> to know their car could do 130 miles
an hour along the Blackbury bypass.... The keys were still in the

been, but in the ignition was where they were.</blockquote>

block, which is near here, you say?
   ---You can see it easily,--- said Bigmac trying to be helpful.
---Or you could to, if it was here.
   The captain and the police sergeant looked at each other.  ---It's not here.
   ---Yes, I dunno why.  (pause)
   ---Tell me again what 'Heavy Mental' is.
   ---They're a neo-punk thrash band.

   ---"And Spit Down the Hole."--- said Bigmac helpfully.
   ---This watch of yours with the numbers on it.  I see it's got
little buttons too.  What happens if I press them?
   The policemen tried to move away a little.
   ---Er, the one on the left lights it up so you can see it in the dark.
   ---Really?  And why would you want to do that?
   ---When you wake up in the night and want to know what time it
is?-- Bigmac suggested after some deep thought.
   ---And the other button?
   ---That's to tell you what time it is in another country.
   Everyone suddenly seemed very interested.
   ---What other country?--- said the captain sharply.
   ---It's stuck on Singapore.
   The captain laid it down very carefully.  The sergeant wrote out a
label and tied it to the watch strap.  Then the captain picked up
Bigmac's jacket.
   ---What is this made of?
   ---I dunno, some kind of plastic.  They sell them down the market.
   The captain pulled it this way and that.  ---How is it made?
   ---Ah, I know that.  I read about it.  You mix some chemicals
together, and you get plastic.
   ---In camouflage colors?
   Bigmac licked his lips.  He was sure that he was in deep trouble
so there was no sense in pretending.  ---That's just to make you look
hard.
   ---"Hard", I see,---  said the captain, and his eyes didn't give
away whether he really saw or not.  He held up the back of the jacket
and pointed to two words done rather badly in biro.  [This means a
thick marking pen?]  ---What exactly are "Blackbury Skins"?
   ---Er, that's me and Bazzer and Skazz, er, skinheads.  A kind o' gang.
   ---"Gang?"--- said the captain.
   ---Er, yes.
   ---"Skin-heads".
   ---Er, the haircut.
   ---Looks like an ordinary military haircut to me.
   ---And these,--- said the captain, pointing to the swastikas on
either side of the name.  ---Gang badges, are they?  Also to make you
look "hard"?
   ---Er, it's just, you know, Adolph Hitler and that.
   All the men were staring at him.
   Bigmac: It's just decoration!
   The captain put the coat down very slowly.
   Bigmac: It's nothing to get excited about.  Where I come from you
can buy badges and things down the market.  You can get Gestapo
knives--
   ---That's enough.  Now listen to me.  You'll make it easier on
yourself if you tell me the truth right now.  I want your name, the
names of your contacts, everything.  A unit is coming from
headquarters, and they aren't as patient as I am.  Do you undersand?
   He stood up and started putting Bigmac's labelled belongings into a sack.
   ---Hey, that's my stuff!
   ---Lock him up!
   ---You can't lock me up just for some old car--
   ---We can for spying.  Oh yes, we can.---  He strode out of the room.
   ---Spying?!  Me?
   ---Are you one of them 'Itler Youths? --- said the sergeant
conversationally.  ---I saw you lot on the newsreel, waving all them
torches.  Nasty pieces of work I thought.  Like Boy Scouts gone bad.
    ---I haven't spied for anyone!!  I don't know how to spy!  I
don't even *like* Germany!  My brother got sent home from Munich for
stitching up one of their football supporters with a scaffolding pole,
even though it wasn't his fault.
   Such rock-solid evidence of anti-Germanic feeling did not seem to
impress the sergeant.
   ---You can get shot, you know.  First offense.
   ...
   Bigmac's boots dug in to the floor, and he rose out of his chair
like a missile going off.  His feet barely touched the tabletop....
Miss Partridge might make cutting remarks, but she wasn't allowed to
use bullets, however much she wanted to.
