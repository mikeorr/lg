<P>
Dear Answer Gang,
</P>
<P>
After 20 years with Microsoft, I see the revolution brewing on the
horizon (at least I think I do). Assuming the role of  Nortradamous,
the movement promoted, sponsored, and pushed by Microsoft to institute
subscription based software has prompted a revolution in the future.
Being one of those people who has been making a living off of the
computer industry for many years, becoming bilingual feels like I
landed on Alpha Centauri &lt;grin&gt; Of course, I expected that jumping
into the underlying mechanics of Linux would bring on lots of anxiety
and frustrations. As the result, the thought that if I'm experiencing
some difficult times, my customers would go out of their minds.
</P>
<P>
In the past when major transitions came about (i.e.., DOS &amp; Windows
3.1 to Win 95), major publications produced issues with brief task
oriented tips. I personally found these to be excellent and it got me
up to speed quickly. I'm aware of the "How To's" but I would hardly
classify them as "Tips." I believe the time is right to begin a
section devoted to "Windows Defectors." The section should
specifically address the typical daily activities of the Windows user
and how to configure Linux to operate like Windows. If you would like,
I have references to many of the Windows Tips that have been published
since Win 95 hit the street as well as copies of the articles and
issues in which they were published.
</P>
<P>
I believe that within the next two to three years, you will be
inundated with so many defectors that they will become a power
influence on your perspective.  I am also aware that the traditional
view of the Linux community would prefer to maintain as much distance
as possible between themselves and Windoze, but take heart, there's a
silver lining to that cloud. If I squint real hard, that lining may be
platinum ... hard to tell from here.
</P>
<P>
It's pretty obvious that some in the Linux community already recognize
the signs of this brewing revolution and have made great strides in
Gnome and especially, <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>. I first began surveying the potential of
Linux back in version 5.2 Redhat, then 7.2, and now 9.x. The Linux
community certainly has been busy and come a long way (Redmond must be
having fits). I look forward to the day when Adobe PhotoShop is
available for Linux. I suspect that would be like winning a Grammy or
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
The kinds of things to cover would be how to get the dynamic mounting
of all drives to function like they do in Windows. Automatic
unmounting when media is removed and remounted when media is inserted.
</P>
<P>
Later,
Dalton Seymour

found in MSwin's "tips" in the registry aren't all that short.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas Adam] 
Windows has the advantage in that tips work, soley because there is only
one "layer" to Windows -- only one GUI. Because Linux has many different
"layers" in that sense, often trying to diagnose a problem and thus
producing a tip, often requires intimate knowledge of the user's system
and the underlying Hardware, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I have to disagree.  For one thing - I worked for Norton years ago, and
even win3.1 had other managers available - HP had one, we had NDW,
Compaqs shipped with this weird tabbed thing, and so on.  There were a
couple of shareware apps to hack what we X using folk would call the
basic widget set, scrollbars, borders and so on.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">For the modern era Windows you might look into LiteStep, or into KDE for
Windows.  (I'm not <EM>sure</EM> K for MSwin replaces the manager, but since
the tech exists to do that I hope they do.)  And some mini explorer I
saw mentioned on a shareware site, whose name I forgot.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#000066">While it's true that a problem often has layers, a set of first things
to try can still be good too.  And, as I spent so many years in MSwin
based tech support teaching others, Windows has those layers to dig
through, too.   The analogous tip may not end up resembling the first
one much - but the analogous problem it's solving may be more similar
than you think.

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">We do have a "unifying" interface: the command line.

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Well, we've had this kind of discussion (or at least fairly similar to
it) here before, and it's not an uncommon topic. It usually comes from
the folks who are new to the Linux community, and unaware of how it (the
community/system/flow of information/etc.) works. Believe me, none of us
have anything against educating ex-Wind0ws users about Linux... but we
can't do it by using the Micr0s0ft model. Nor - with very few exceptions

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas Adam] 
Indeed, Ben. Many people who I talk to about making "the switch" are often
put off by the black-and-white terminal screen. They cannot seem to
realise that despite this, there are increasing GUI's out there that offer
the functionality that Windows user's crave: control from the GUI.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">There are.  But the fact that they at present work on underlying text
files, means when the GUIs break down - either don't work, or prevent
someone from getting at the unusual control combination the GUI-tool's
author didn't think of - then they can be dealt with "under the hood".
Short of hand hacking registry entries there's no close equivalent in
Windows.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Mind you, there is at least one good idea in what you say - in fact, I
was already thinking about doing something like this on my own, although
the details are different. I think that a "Basic Linux tips" site would
be a useful thing... but I would also say that it should definitely be a
separate entity from the Linux Gazette. The main reason is that it would
be a toe-in-the-water type of resource - for people who had never used
Linux before - while the LG readership, at least the folks who contact
us on a regular basis (and, as always, in my estimate) are beyond that
point. In fact, where I see LG positioned is - to draw a parallel - at
the point to which I try to get my students in the various intro
programming classes I teach: enough knowledge to know what questions to
ask. That is a key turning point in the knowledge curve, the "knee" at
which that curve breaks over and starts accelerating. With Linux, that
point is not too far away from the origin; however, it is not <EM>at</EM> the
origin, which is the point you're talking about.

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Personally, I believe that Knoppix &lt;<A HREF="http://knoppix.org/&gt"

the best intro to Linux that a new "defector" can have. With even a
little bit of prior computer experience, the average Joe (or Joette 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

can be surfing, sending e-mail, and using a word processor just a couple
of minutes after firing it up. I believe that it's much better to get
someone _doing_ and then nailing down the specifics than trying to teach
the technical detail without any referent (my brain works OK in both of
those scenarios, but in my experience as a teacher I find that most
folks do far better with the former approach.)

Photoshop can't even compete, although they've made some nice
improvements in the recent years. As an aside, I've been using The GIMP
for several years, recently got into the above manual, and have been
shocked, re-shocked, and triple-shocked by how much flexibility, how
huge a variety of tools, and how much RAW POWER lies hidden behind that
"simple" little interface (and that I've just passed by, unknowingly,
all these years.) I wouldn't go back to using Photoshop for anything
less than large amounts of money, and would still use the GIMP for my
own graphical editing.

strengths are rather different from the GIMP but I wouldn't say "can't
compete".   GIMP began aiming in Photoshop's direction, but the people
who really use it took it to other places.   So if Kai starts selling
Kai's Power GIMP Fu, then we'll be winning the Oscar.

<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
i have sendmail v 8.8.7 running on a RedHat 7.2 box. A few days ago I
downgraded sendmail as I have several other boxes running on that version (by
the way, they work perfectly).
</P>
<P>
Now, when I try to send mails to anywhere else but local accounts, the only way
I can do this is via "sendmail -v <A HREF="mailto:User@Domain"
	>User@Domain</A>". If I use mail or any other mail-
program or even "sendmail user@domain", sendmail does not deliver the mail but
prints the following message into <TT>/var/log/maillog:</TT>
</P>

<blockquote><pre>"Jul 15 16:53:00 redhat-box sendmail[19121]: QAA19121: from=root, size=37,
class=0, pri=30037, nrcpts=1, msgid=&lt;20030715145 3.QAA19121@redhat-
box.mydomain&gt;, relay=root@localhost
Jul 15 16:53:00 redhat-box sendmail[19123]: QAA19121: to=User@Domain,
ctladdr=root (0/0), delay=00:00:00, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=esmtp,
relay=Domain., stat=Deferred: Name server: Domain.: host name lookup failure".
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Instead of using the correct relay it uses the domain I want to send my mail to
as a relay.
</P>
<P>
The weird thing is that as well "sendmail -v" as "sendmail -bt" with <TT>/mx</TT>
entered resolve the MX record correctly.
</P>
<P>
Another weird thing is that a DNS-query is also done by my redhat-box when I
try to use
"sendmail <A HREF="mailto:User@Domain"
	>User@Domain</A>". It seems that in this case sendmail retrieves the same
info from the DNS but stops processing it correctly somewhere between my
attempt and the actual delivery.
</P>
<P>
After several days of debugging and searching forums I don't have any clue what
sendmail wants to tell me here. I would be really grateful (and impressed) if
anyone can help me with this.
</P>
<P>
Thanks in advance.
</P>

<P>
Hey Gang,
</P>
<P>
Does anyone know of a Perl/Tk GUI builder?  The only things I've found
on Google are specperl and Guido, neither of which are supported any
longer.  Specperl is okay, but I've got to make so many changes to the
generated code that it would be a lot of work if I needed to make
changes to the GUI (and I do!).
</P>
<P>
Even a commercial app would be fine (from what I've seen, most of
ActiveState's stuff doesn't run under Linux).
</P>
<P>
Do Perl/Tk people really build the interfaces by hand still? That can
get pretty tedious...
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Ok readers, now's your chance.  Show us where the cool toys are, or put

Hi there,
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
I use squid as a proxy server (default configuration) and it seems that i
can't connect to ftp sites through it.
Do I have to do anything?
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><FONT COLOR="#000066"><EM>
Nickos, Greece
</EM></FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It appears that this is an FAQ in the land of Squid, number 12.17 --
"Can I make my regular FTP clients use a Squid cache?"
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Nope, its not possible. Squid only accepts HTTP requests. It speaks
FTP on the server-side, but not on the client-side.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The very cool wget will download FTP URLs via Squid (and probably any
other proxy cache).
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">However, it would be fun to have an article about somebody using Squid
and/or other site caching software in powerful ways to make their site's
view of the web more fun.  There are a bunch of add-ons at Freshmeat for
it, so I'm sure someone out there has a great example for us to follow.
Don't forget to read our author submission guidelines.

<P>
Hi people, I have a problem......
</P>
<P>
I'm actually trying to mirror the hard disks using RAID 1 in <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 9.It
can work perfectly but the bug is that i can only boot up the first hard
disk, i suppose lilo is stored as th MBR in it. The second hard disk during
booting up, shows LI and i boot it using a bootup diskette instead.  I'm
wondering how to implement lilo in the second HDD in such a way that it auto
boots up just like the 1st HDD.Is it possible?
</P>
<P>
Is it true that only 1 MBR could be used will it work on 2 MBR in 2
respective hard disks?
</P>
<P>
I visited the Boot+Raid+Root+ Lilo How to documentation:
&amp; i tried this method to boot up second HDD..but there's error
</P>
<P>
it is known as a raid LILO config file pair that I implemented:
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/wanted/geraldine.lilo.conf.hda.txt">geraldine.lilo.conf.hda.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
I created this 2 lilo configuration file but not too sure whether is eing
read anot because i still have a current default lilo file <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT>
</P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/wanted/geraldine.default.etc-lilo.conf.txt">geraldine.default.etc-lilo.conf.txt</a></tt></p>
<P>
Bacially that's about all...I hope your gang can resolve my roblem.Sorry if
i bored you to sleep with such a long email.
Hope to hear from ya soon...
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
Geraldine

<P><STRONG>
Well, a real stumper is, I've sent her mail and she has actually been
getting it, as shown by her copies of my messages in the thread.  So
whatever this is is only happening under limited circumstances.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Even weirder, the host space for "example.org" should NOT be
mentioning <TT>/var/chroot</TT> - that's a referent for the next level up.
So I will check <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> and see if her homedir is wrong.  But I
still cannot figure out why it would mention <TT>/bin/echo.</TT>  I don't use it
to say 'x' - I use to to say real messages I want logged, even during
debug modes.  So Perhaps something automatic did it, but then, I don't
know what.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It also happened when soneone from Intel sent her an email - he
forwarded me the same bounce.
</P>
<P>
Let me know if we can get this fixed ASAP - thanks, JH
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">We did fix this, but, the method we used was to simply create a new
account for her.  So, if anyone has any good theory as to what really
happened...
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
Well, she doesn't have any procmail that everyone else doesn't have
(it just keeps a backup mailbox).  There's not mention of <TT>/bin/echo</TT>
anywhere in the postfix setup of either the top or chroot'd levels.
And her homedir references are correct, plus, other people have the
same setup she does in that regard too.  There isn't even a letter x
anywhere in their aliases file, since none of the accounts or alias
names contains one.  <TT>/var/chroot/home/mary</TT> does indeed exist,
if you look at things from the top level, but the postfix running in
the lower level has no good reason to try to refer to that, since
the chroot'd <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> mentions <TT>/home/mary.</TT>
</P>
<P>
I tried hitting up the net for that form of error message, but nothing
useful came up.  I'm going to submit this to The Answer Gang and see
if any of them has a good idea what to look at next.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">As it turns out, the original subject looked like a mailer daemon notice

An additional bit not mentioned here, is that the user is not a shell

folks!

Gang members may be pleased to know that those of you whom I recognize
as regular contributors get your real addresses snipped and replaced
with a rather generic "The Answer Gang" - and our regular staffers, such

several of you are in my little scripts as automatically fixed up that
way.

<P>
It's been brought to my attention that some people feel that the
<EM>Gazette</EM> is a bit of a closed system and hard for people to submit
material to.
</P>
<P>
This magazine is a labor of love - we are all volunteers here, every
single one of us.  The title bar on TAG used to say it was by a handful
of members of the Gang.... and you!
</P>
<P>
It's still true, but it's not limited to that column.
</P>
<P>
We have a batch of people at the core of it, but anyone has the power here
to make a difference.  If you have suggestions for improving the look
of <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> - things you liked or hated about older styles - do
let us know.  We may not accept every suggestion, because we still want
to be usable across low end connections like modems in the wilder areas
of the world, we have PDA users surfing websites now, and we still want
to be search engine friendly.  But with those things in mind, we're sure
we can do more.
</P>
<P>
I know it may not look like it in some months, but you don't have to be
a member of The Answer Gang to tell us your best juicy tips.  Just send
them to <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>tag@lists.linuxgazette.net</A> with "Tips" or "2c" anywhere in the
subject, and if your tip seems accurate you'll see your name with two
pennies next month.  If your Tip is a bit long, but your explanation is
good, send it anyway.  We like those a lot.  If it's really long, you
may end up as one of the speakers in the TAG column yourself, or invited
to lengthen your material into an article.
</P>
<P>
We post Wanteds (see above) for two flavors of enouragement;  you can
show off your knowledge on a few Answer Gang style questions without
formally joining the Gang ... and people with a broader view can write
some articles on these "stumper" topics.
</P>
<P>
Article ideas need not come from the lost and confused, though.  If you
can't write, but you know some cool topic you'd love to see covered,
send in your article idea either to me for the Mailbag directly, or
to the Gang if you'd like to see it discussed and maybe turned into a
good thread.  I'd also like to take a moment to thank all the authors
who presently have ideas in the pipeline for us.
</P>
<P>
We do sometimes see articles put together from general discussions
among our answerfolk, though this is less common.  Anyone who has a
little room in their mailbox and a desire to help out - or just listen
to the clues float by - is welcome to join The Answer Gang.  Visit
<A HREF="http://www.ssc.com/mailman/listinfo/linux-questions-only"
	>http://www.ssc.com/mailman/listinfo/linux-questions-only</A> to reach our
mailman interface.   This is a few hundred slices of mail every month
though, and sometimes rambles.  Don't be afraid to correct people who
are wrong, but try to be friendly.  And don't let the dark glasses
and other silliness put you off; it's part of the charm.   And yes,
pop in with enough answers and help a few of the regulars not shoot
themselves too badly around the feet - and you, too, will enjoy the
TAG lounge and the marvelous automagically refreshable munchies.
</P>
<P>
We haven't had any formal sponsors for a long while, but you don't have
to be a lone individual to help out.  If any companies out there would
like to help sponsor the Gazette by defraying some of the costs that
our host puts into this, please contact <A HREF="mailto:sponsor@ssc.com"
	>sponsor@ssc.com</A>.  Your reward
will be your logo on the index page, and a round of thanks from LG
readers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
While we're talking about a big helping hand ... let's all think a
round of virtual beer for our unsung heroes who run the mirror sites.
Especially those brave souls in the boonies who only have storage room
for a few issues, or a moderate degree of permanent badnwidth, but keep
a mirror anyway.  If you are a mirror site maintainer, and are having
some trouble keeping your mirror up to date, <EM>please</EM> email us about it.
The Gang will be glad to help you settle out any automation bugs that
we can.  Our new webmaster (wave Hi, Jeff!) will see that you're able
to connect up.  New mirrors are always welcome too.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, we're working on having some more memorable addresses
@linuxgazette.com soon.  I realize that it will take a while for folks
to clean up bookmarks, and we'll see a lot of folks referencing older
documents, and besides @ssc.com is shorter to type.  Fear not, those
addresses will still work for awhile to come.  But alias space is cheap,
and easy to remember addresses will, we hope, make submitting to the
<EM>Linux Gazette</EM> ... a little more fun.
