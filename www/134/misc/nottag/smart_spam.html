<p>Hi. My name is Eugene Gershin. Perhaps we have met online, but
more probably you don't know me from Adam. I monitor blogs for
XXXXXXXXXXXXX, and came across your post.</p>
<p>I'd like to welcome you to look at XXXXXXX XXXXXX's blog.
XXXXXXX - an anonymous Israeli politician - writes extremely
controversial articles about Israel, the Middle East politics, and
terrorism. XXXXXX is equally critical of Jewish and Muslim myths,
and advocates political rationalism instead of moralizing. Google
banned our site from the AdWords, Yahoo blocked most pages, and
Amazon deleted all reviews of XXXXXXX's book, XXXXXXXXXXXXXX: X
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
Nevertheless, 170,000 people from 78 countries read the book.</p>
<p>Various Internet providers ban us periodically, but you can look
up the site on search engines. The mirror
xxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxx/xxxx currently works.</p>
<p>Please help us spread XXXXXXX's message, and mention the blog in
one of your posts, or link to us from
linuxgazette.net/131/lg_mail.html. I would greatly appreciate your
comments.</p>
<p>Best wishes, Eugene Gershin</p>

<p>I don't think just hyperlinks: I recieved a copy of this spam as
well, and I don't think my email address is linked on that page in
any other form than "jcreigh at gmail.com". Looks like spammers are
starting to parse that too. I don't really care, since I get tons
of spam anyway, but the s/@/ at / obfuscation probably shouldn't be
counted upon.</p>

<p>Quoting Jason Creighton (jcreigh at gmail.com):</p>
<pre>
&gt; ...the s/@/ at / obfuscation probably shouldn't be counted upon.
</pre>
<p>No, it certainly should not.</p>
<p>Any form of e-mail address obfuscation that gets used widely, as
the "rick at linuxmafia.com" format is by (e.g.) GNU Mailman is
trivially hackable by spammers' tools such as address harvesting
scripts. Actually, the real legitimate use for those rather silly
forms of obfuscation is entirely different -- and utterly
cynical:</p>
<p>It's a device to aid listadmins in overcoming knee-jerk
objections to keeping mailing lists "open" (publicly archived). In
any online community, there will always be at least one participant
who really doesn't "get" how spammers work, but is absolutely
convinced that the rest of the world must "protect his[/her]
privacy", by scrambling to expunge it from public view, every time
it pops up.</p>
<p>The dutiful, intellectually honest, community-knowledge-minded
answer to that person goes as follows: "Sir [/ma'am], if you think
you can use an e-mail address even minimally on the Internet in
2006 and hide it from spammers, you're kidding yourself. Ask
yourself: Can you absolutely guarantee that nobody will ever add
your address to an MS-Wind0ws "address book" of the sort used by
MS-Outlook Express and MS-Outlook, or other MAPI clients? No? Well,
then logic obliges you to acknowledge that statistically that is
very, very likely to happen, and multiple such people are very
likely to get their MS-Wind0ws machines virus-infected, at which
point the zombified Wind0ws box <em>will</em> report your e-mail
address directly to the spammers. Game over. Finis. And this
happens very quickly in today's Internet."</p>
<p>That would be the <em>correct</em>, relevant counter-argument.
The problem is: The logic is complex and requires paying attention
-- and so it invariably fails to convince those who raise that
objection.</p>
<p>So, instead you say "Oh, no problem. See here? Mailman will
<em>obscure</em> your address, and thus the bad guys won't be able
to get it."</p>
<p>One completely irrational analysis, convincingly rebutted by a
bogus but generally accepted answer -- thereby carrying out the
good office of permitting mailing lists to be open, thus better
benefiting the public by being publicly searchable.</p>
<p>But, here, I've given you both answers, pro bono publico. Go
forth and do evil, or not, as you think best. Far be it from me to
say which is which.</p>

<p>Jeremy Zawodny uses an utterly brilliant local modification to
MovableType on his blog (<a href=

completely defeats the 60% of Web comment spam that is from
automated spammer processes: <a href=
"http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002836.html">http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/002836.html</a>
In short, Jeremy modified MT's standard comment form to ask "What's
Jeremy's first name?"</p>
<p>Humans type "Jeremy" (or "jeremy") and are not significantly
impeded. Bots, by contrast, get foiled.</p>
<p>Obviously, if spam-tool authors start custom-coding their
scripts (the ones they sell to spammers) for Jeremy's one-off
locally modified version of MovableType, he can trivially change
the question occasionally, e.g., to ask "What colour is a ripe
banana?"</p>
<p>That still leaves the other 40%, the spam posted individually by
humans saying "I really like your site, and wanted to recommend
[URL] to all your readers" and such. Jeremy has to use other means
to combat those.</p>

<p>My vgrep-based filter tripped off just before that: "I monitor

definitely comes off as <em>miles</em> more similar to real email
than the average hunk'o'compressed pork.</p>

<p>If nothing else, this should be a wake-up call to the people who
believe in content-based spam filtering as a primary measure. If
you have nothing better, then that's how it goes - but if you have
the option, SMTP-time rejection is the only way to go.</p>
<p>This type of thing is rare for the moment (I've seen less than a
half a dozen until now), but spammers are constantly refining their
techniques, and this one certainly lends itself to duplication. In
effect, they'd have to hire a "letter writer" to structure their
message; after that, they would proceed in their regular
fashion.</p>
<p>Just for comparison: the one sent to 'tag@' actually made it
through into my main box (I've got TAG slightly scored up in SA -
we get a number of queries that smell quite spammy); however, all
the ones sent to the other LG addresses that I handle ended up in
my spam bucket. Here's one to 'ben@':</p>
<pre>
X-Spam-Status: No, score=2.5 required=5.0 tests=BAYES_50,NO_REAL_NAME,
        RCVD_IN_BL_SPAMCOP_NET autolearn=no version=3.1.1
X-Spam-Level: **
X-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 3.1.1 (2006-03-10) on
genetikayos.com
</pre>
Note that Kayos' SA filter passed it as non-spam - 2.5 out of 5.
Mine, however, managed to catch it:
<pre>
X-Spam-Flag: YES
X-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 3.1.7 (2006-10-05) on Fenrir.Thor
X-Spam-Level: <strong>*</strong>
X-Spam-X-Spam-Status: Yes, hits=3.5 required=3.0 tests=BAYES_99=3.5
        autolearn=no version=3.1.7
X-Spam-Status: Yes, score=3.5 required=3.0 tests=BAYES_99 autolearn=no
        version=3.1.7
</pre>
Not by much, though. Note that I consider anything that hits 3.5 as
spam (versus the default 5); this requires me to be active about
whitelisting and putting up with the (very rare) instance of a
false positive; the former is taken care of with a Mutt macro, the
latter is a matter of a minute or two per day.
<p>This type of email, however, is going to skew that ratio for a
lot of people. I have little doubt that we'll see more of it as
time goes on.</p>

<p>John Walker, of AutoCAD fame, has been using a similar Turing
test for quite a long time: his "FeedbackForm" CGI script requires
the ability to solve a linear equation before you can send
webmail.</p>
<p><a href=
"http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/feedbackform/">http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/feedbackform/</a></p>
<p>Note that you can set the $minorder and $maxorder variables in
the script to make the requirement more stringent: the default (1)
is linear, but '2' gets you a quadratic, '3' is cubic, '4' is
quartic, and so on. [grin] I can visualize some very exclusive
lists formed along those lines.</p>
<p>John is also, incidentally, the author of the "demoronize"
script (removes Micr0s0ft-specific formatting from text files) that
I just mentioned to Rick in private email. Funny how that
works.</p>
