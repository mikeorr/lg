greetings james!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
i have a question for you, and this question has been everywhere.
no one seems to be able to answer it....  let me explain what i am
trying to do:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BlockQuote>
i would like anonymous ftp users to upload files and make
directories with specific ownership and file permissions.  sounds
easy, right?
</BlockQuote></STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Nope.  It doesn't.  Of course we'd need to know
the specific desired ownership and permissions; but
there is no generalized support for this in the
WU ftpd nor in the old Berkeley daemon.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
i've been banging my head against the wall for weeks
now over this.  i've read the ftpaccess man page 20 times.  i
understand <EM>everything</EM> that <TT>/etc/ftpaccess</TT> is capable of doing.
the 'upload' feature of ftpaccess looks like my ticket, but it
doesn't seem to work no matter what i do.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

If you understand <EM>everything</EM> about ftpaccess then you
are much smarter than I am.  I've read it at least
50 times and I still find some elements confusing.  I've
learned a bit about it from many experiments --- which
have shed light on some of the man page details.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
i would very much like to send you a copy of my ftpaccess file but
first i would like to see if you can help me otherwise.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
I probably can't help with ftpaccess.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
i think i'm missing a setting or i'm missing a concept..  maybe i
need to look at group settings some more or maybe a group setting
isn't configured correctly.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
is this a umask issue??  if so, what should i set my defumask to
in my <TT>/etc/ftpaccess?</TT>
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Read on.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
please reply by email if you are able to help.  i've a client
breathing down my neck about this (i'm sure you know the feeling).
</STRONG></P>

thanks james,

Unfortunately I think you're trying to drive a screw with
a hammer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The wu-ftpd mechanisms for controlling access to the
incoming directory are very limited.  You can use the
flag nodirs to disable the ability to make directories
thereunder, you can allow or restrict the chmod command,
and you can set the umask (among other things).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I don't know of any combination of these that would
match your needs.  umask settings only apply to newly
created FILES not to DIRECTORIES.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The frustrating thing is that it seems that you can "almost"
get what you want with the right combination of ftpaccess
settings and underlying (OS) permissions, ownership and
account settings (<TT>/etc/passwd</TT>, and <TT>/etc/group</TT>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've been there.  It was a bad place.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You might be able to cook up a statically linked binary
program that you put in the ftp/chroot <TT>/bin</TT> directory and
allow the users to call with a site/quote command.  That
could create a directory and set the permission.  However,
I've never written such a command, and it might be very
difficult to write one that was sufficiently robust that you
could trust it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition it is difficult for users to use site/quote
commands through many FTP clients (and some GUI clients will
make it impossible).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You'd probably be far better off using ProFTPd
(<A HREF="http://www.proftpd.org"
	>http://www.proftpd.org</A>).  This is a GPL'd FTP daemon
package with a configuration file that's deliberately
similar in structure and syntax to the (now) ubiquitous
<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A>/NCSA .conf files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In their discussion of their UMASK directive they mention
that umask modifies the permissions on directorie and files
--- but they refer one to the OS documentation for details
(ProFTPd runs on many UNIX platforms other than Linux).
That suggests that they aren't currently doing anything
beyond the current Linux UMASK semantics.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've heard discussion of a DMASK setting, but I believe it
was purely hypothetical and never implemented in Linux.  (I
don't know anything about such a setting in other OS').
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, I've copied the proftpd developers list on this
response in the hopes that they can shed some light on this
subject for us.  (Any fruits from this discussion will be
summarized, credited and posted to the Linux Gazette Answer
Guy's column <A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You don't mention your specific needs.  What are the desired
constraints on the created subdirectory's ownership and
permissions?  Let's say you created a group 'strange' and
set the mode of the incoming directory to something like
3772 (sticky, SGID, world writable, executable and readable
to owner and group).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It might allow one to force all directories created below
that point to be group-owned by 'strange' and set to the
same permissions as the parents.  (That's the normal affect
of an SGID directory (mode +2000) under Linux).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Only the owner of a file would be able to remove them
(that's the normal affect of the sticky bit, mode +1000).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Having considered the OS level affects we then ask what
ProFTPd directives would model your requirements.  I can't
even speculate, since I don't know them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even if you need to hack in some custom code (into the
daemon) I would think that ProFTPd would be a cleaner code
base to work from than wuftpd.   ProFTPd is under GPL
so you're licensed to modify it, and to distribute modified
versions (so long as you make your patches available to the
public under GPL if you exercise both of those rights).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are a number of other FTP daemons available.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
ncFTPd (by Mike Gleason) is shareware.  You can freely use
it for personal systems (up to 3 concurrent connectios) and
some non-profit/educational institutions (read his license
at <A HREF="http://www.ncftp.com"
	>http://www.ncftp.com</A> for details).  However it doesn't
appear to exactly what you're looking for.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I do see (in ncftpd's documentation pages) a rather
interesting discussion about "eventd" --- a deamon to
process actions based on FTP deamon events (such as file and
directory creations!).  That looks rather interesting....
There's also a upload-event processor option in Mike's
general.cf file that might be easier than writing a daemon
(at the expense of greater server load since a new processes
would be spawned for each such event, rather than a
lightweight message from one daemon to another).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ul><li>
(as a side note, I see that the latest



ncftpd version 2.5.0 adds support for the
sendfile() system call under Linux, and
apparently under <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, too).
</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet another FTP daemon package is BeroFTPd by Bernhard
Rosenkraenzer.  Unfortunately he doesn't seem to maintain a
web-based copy of his documentation (or even a web site for
that matter), and I don't have the time to download that and
read through the tar file.  You can find BeroFTPd using a
quick Freshmeat search.  (<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net"
	>http://www.freshmeat.net</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You'll probably find what you need in one of these packages,
or perhaps with a bit of coding and patching to one of them.
