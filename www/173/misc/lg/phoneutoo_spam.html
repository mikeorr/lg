I assume this is a targeted spam, not an official Gazette communications 
channel?

Sorry about that - my mistake. I was testing a CSV adding procedure at a
new client's site and used the TAG list as a handy sample data set...
and didn't realize that it would spam everyone that I added.

Sheesh. I'm really, really sorry, folks. I think I'll go crawl away and
die in embarassment. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Well, OK then. I couldn't find a bridge to jump from anyway (and jumping
from a router seems like a waste of time), so I'll take that as a
reprieve...

/me looks out the portside light[1], and notes that the bridge nearby is

suggest to Ben that if he goes out into the cockpit and faces the bow,
he'll see a perfectly good bridge. And wonders why a router table comes
to mind, rather than, say, the rooftop of the nearby marina.

[1] portholes <strong>open</strong>, you see. lights are what one calls "unopenable
windows" on a boat.

The one where a sailboat broke its mast last week??? Besides, it's over
water. I might get <strong>wet</strong>. If that was to happen every time I commited
suicide, it would get <em>really</em> annoying.

/me looks off to starboard, and notes that the marina rooftop doesn't

just go jump off... oh, wait.

The mast? You'd have to climb up past the wind generator, that's
