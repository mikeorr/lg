<H2>Drill</H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:apepin@pepinsrv.pepinhome.org">Tony Pepin</A>

<P> This happened a long time ago, when a 20-megabyte hard disk was a
giant, both in capacity and size.
My friend had a Corvus 20 meg drive that was shared among five PCs
which were used to run the accounting department of a small manufacturing
business.  The owner of the company was extremely pleased with my
friend and the efficiency of the computerized accounting group.

<P> One day, in the middle of month-end processing, the electric motor on
the Corvus burned out.
Payroll and Accounts Receivable needed to be done by the end of
the day, and there were no backups of the data files.  Since the Corvus
had never failed, my friend had not bothered making backups.

<P> Not having anything to lose, he opened up the case and removed the
burned out motor.  He then took an old electric hand drill with a
variable speed motor and chucked it directly to the hard disk.

<P> I wrote a quick and dirty program that read one sector of data and
displayed a message when the read was successful.  He ran this 
program while squeezing the trigger on the drill until it reported
successful reads.

<P> Once he had the speed right, he used black tape and taped the trigger
so that it would not move.

<P> The accounting group finished their month-end processing using the 
drill as the hard disk motor.  He continued to use the drive with
the drill for several weeks, after carefully making backups of the
data however.

<H2>Zap</H2>

By <A HREF="mailto:ogre@sirinet.net">John J Tobin</A>

<P> Here is a foolish story of what I did to a computer I was building.

<P> Back before I had a lot of money to buy new hardware and such I had to
make due with the few parts that I had lying around. One was an old XT
case with a working power supply, I had enough money to get a motherboard
and a DX4-100 chip, however cases and power supplies were expensive back
then so I decided to use the XT case that I had. Since the XT
motherboards were non-standard as far as mounting holes go and the new
board wouldn't line up I had the great brainstorm to mount the board on
the anti-static bag, I though "Sure it's anti-static it'll be safe." I
ran it and it would boot up but the keyboard controller was failing. I
took it back to the place that I bought and and I was explained to how
the anti-static bag will actually conduct electricity and that I fried
the board. Luckily he was willing to refund me half of my money, I then
had to shell out for another board and a case this time. The lesson I
learned was that if I am going to mount a board on anything but the pegs
of the case I better use wood, something that is definitely and
insulator.

<P>  Here follows the story of 
the geekiest use I've ever put my Palm III to.

<P> I bought a Used Sparc Classic and it came with a hard drive, RAM, 
keyboard and mouse.  It did <EM>not</EM> come with a monitor.  Since I planned 
for it to be a server, the lack of a monitor wasn't a big deal except 
that I couldn't install Linux on it (or anything else for that matter) 
without being able to see what I was doing.

<P> Palm III to the rescue!  I had a serial cable that plugged into the 
bottom of the Palmpilot connected to a gender bender, connected to a 
DB25 &lt;-&gt; DB9 cable to plug into the serial port of the Sparc.  The 
serial port on the Sparc actually has the wiring for both /dev/ttyS0 
<EM>and</EM> /dev/ttyS1, but the first serial port has the same wiring as a PC, 
so it worked fine.  Last but not least, I unplugged the keyboard.

<P> Now that the hardware side was figured out, I downloaded a freeware 
vt100 program for my Palmpilot and configured it for the proper baud 
rate, stop bits and such.  When I turned on the Sparc, it tried to find 
a keyboard and failed.  Then it found a vt100 terminal on the serial 
port and used the Pilot as a console.  I installed RedHat 6.2 to my 
Sparc using that tiny little screen.

<P> After the install was done, I rebooted and telnetted in from my PC.  
Everything worked perfectly.
