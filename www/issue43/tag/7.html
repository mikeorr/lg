Hi James,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I know this question has been asked before (i'v read the 'stuff' in the
previous columns) but this one has an interesting wrinkle which i can't
answer.  I hope you can

I was copying a new slackware 4.0 installation from one disk to another.
Incidently, i used two methods, using <tt>tar</tt> and 
<tt>find | afio</tt>, etc...  It was the right way.  I've done it 
many many many times before.
</STRONG></P>

You might not have preserved allocation "holes" (the
"sparsity") of the files as you transferred them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When a program opens a file in write mode and does a <tt>seek()</tt>
or <tt>lseek()</tt> to some point that is more than a block past the
end of the file, the Linux native filesystems (<tt>ext2</tt>, <tt>minix</tt>,
etc) will leave the unnecessary blocks unallocated.  This
is possible in inode based filesystems (not in FAT/MS-DOS
formatted filesystems).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These filesystems treat reads into such unallocated regions
of a file as blocks of NULs (ASCII zero characters).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, you use normal read and write commands in sequence
(like '<tt>cp</tt>' and '<tt>cat</tt>' to to copy files) then you'll expand
any such "holes" in the allocation map (the inode's list
of clusters) into blocks of NULs and the file will
take more space than it used to.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One possibility is that you used to have such "sparse"
files and that your method of copying them failed to
preserve those "holes."  You could use the GNU '<tt>cp
--sparse=always</tt>' option to restore the "holes" in
selected files (or create new ones wherever there are
blocks of NULs in the data).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most files are not sparse --- in fact there are only a
couple of old dbm style libraries that used to create
them in normal system use (the sendmail <tt>newaliases</tt>
command used to be a prime example).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't think this accounts for your whole problem (i.e.
it's not wholly a "holey" problem).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Now, the problem is this: after the copy was complete, i used the
slackware bootdisk and rootdisk to reboot things nice and clean to test
the disk, and every copy i tried to do (including running lilo)
resulted in a "file too large" error message.  A '<tt>df</tt>' reported that the
disk had lots of space on it, as did '<tt>du</tt>' (as did basic common sense 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> ).
The disk became completely unusable until i destroyed it and reinstalled
slackware from scratch.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Perhaps you should look at the output of the '<TT>df -i</TT>' command.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your Linux filesystems actually have couple of resources that
are depleted at different rates from one another.  If you
have lots of small files than you are using up inodes faster
than data blocks.  The normal '<tt>df</tt>' command output reports
on your free <EM>data</EM> space.  '<tt>df -i</tt>' reports on the
inode utilization.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, its possible that you ran out of inodes even if you have
plenty of disk space.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
Now, considering that the disk was just a 'raw' disk with data on it (ie.
it wasn't the root partition at this point) I have no idea why it would
behave like this.  I tried eliminating <TT>/proc/*</TT> just for the heck of it,
but to no avail.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
It is very easy to accidentally copy/archive your <TT>/proc</TT>
(which is generally no harm).  The problem is that you
can easily restore that to your new root fs and
mount a real <TT>/proc</TT> back over the restored <em>copy/snapshot</em>
of the state of your proc fs back when you did the backup.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I recommend that you use the <tt>find -xdev</tt> or <tt>-mount</tt> options
to prevent your find from crossing filesystem boundaries.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's say you have <TT>/</TT>, <TT>/usr/</TT>, <TT>/var</TT>, 
<TT>/usr/local</TT>, and <TT>/home</TT> as local filesystems.  To use 
'<tt>cpio</tt>' to back them up you could use a command like
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
find / /usr/ /var /usr/local /home -mount -depth | cpio ....
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to feed only the file names that are on that list
of filesystem to <tt>cpio</tt>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When using '<tt>cpio</tt>' you can preserve sparsity while
COPYING IN your data using the <tt>--sparse</tt> option.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course '<tt>tar</tt>' works differently from '<tt>cpio</tt>' in just
about everyway that you could think of.  You have to
use something a bit more like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><Code>
tar cSlf /dev/st0 / /usr/ /var /usr/local /home
</Code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... where the <tt>-S</tt> preserves sparsity (during archive
creation; and apparently NOT during restoration
unless the archive was correctly created).  Personally
I think that this is a bug in GNU tar.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>[ I suppose fortcing someone to use -S (or --sparse)
	when restoring offers the </em>ability<em> to desparsify the
	file, on a new filesystem which has room for it. Why it
	should be the default to not come out as it went in, though,
	I've no idea.  -- Heather ]
</em></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <tt>tar -l</tt> option instructs '<tt>tar</tt>' not to cross fs boundaries.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The key general point here is that you might have
mounted <TT>/proc</TT> or any other filesystem over a non-empty
mount point.  I personally think that the distribution
maintainers should modify the default <tt>rc*</tt> scripts
so that they won't mount filesystems over non-empty
directories.  I'd modify them to uniquely rename and
remake any non-empty directory before mounting something
over it (and post a nastygram to syslog, of course).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>[ I disagree;  I often touch a file named 
	<code>THIS_IS_THE_UNDERLYING_MOUNTPOINT</code> for mount points,
	and I've actually had occasional administrative use for a few
	files to sit in the underlying drive in case that fs doesn't
	mount.  Usually, notes about what should have been there, 
	although I suppose that could be the content of the
	commentary filename above.  -- Heather ]

I hope i've given you enough information here.  I've been using linux for
years and have never come across something like this.

I really don't know if I've given you the answer that will
help for your situation.  I've just tried to explain the
most common couple of "out of space" situations that I've
seen and heard about --- with the hopes that you're
situation isn't more bizarre.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If your space problems persist through a reboot then
you don't have the old "open anonymous file" problem
(which I've described on other occasions).  It's also a
very good idea to run <tt>fsck</tt> (do a filesystem check)
when you can't account for your missing space.

<p><strong>From Derek Wyatt  on Fri, 11 Jun 1999

<p><strong>
Jim, thanks a lot for your quick reply.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
I don't think this applies in my situation but there are a few things here
that are news to me.  It's good to know.  If you were here, i'm sure you
could figure it out 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">  
But you're not.  I simply need to learn more to
solve something like this myself.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
My knowledge of linux, how to use it and administrate it is in the upper
intermediate level, i think.  In order to get it higher, i need to learn
about the details of the filesystem, the kernel, processes, etc etc...
How would you recommend going about this sort of thing?  Are there some
online documents, or some books you would recommend?  How about some
source code to pour over?
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Thanks again
