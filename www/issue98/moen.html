<h1>Constructive Paranoia at the End of 2003</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Some weeks ago, I was spending some time assisting my
mother-in-law, who's working on her Ph.D in computer network
security, do a survey of a half-dozen or so Linux users at
local user group, CABAL, about our security practices &mdash; with
results like these:</p>

<p><em>Do we use anti-viral software?</em> (No, except where we handle
files or mail destined for Microsoft-OS machines.) <em>Do we study
our networks' security exposure using vulnerability-scanning
software such as nmap and snort?</em> (Many of us do, yes.) <em>Do we
run log-analysis security utilities such as logcheck?</em> (Ditto.)
<em>Do we run Intrusion Detection System (IDS) suites such as
Tripwire?</em> (Almost never.) <em>What measures do we take to eliminate
security holes as they arise in a timely fashion?</em> (Various.)
<em>Do we use kernel-level IP-traffic filtering scripts ("firewalls")?</em>
(Some do. Several more-experienced users operating all-Unix
networks do not.)</p>

<p>These questions kept haunting me as I answered questions
from new Linux administrators. Sometimes, those were very
astute: Q: <em>"How can you be sure that your system hasn't been
compromised by hostile parties?"</em> A: "Excellent question. You
can't know, absolutely. A truly subtle and competent intruder
manifests those abilities in part by being difficult to spot,
and covering his tracks. But intruders (or their automated
attack tools) generally break into a system to do some
significant unauthorised activity, leaving clues that will be
spotted by alert and capable admins who know their systems well
enough to notice peculiar goings-on." That answer tends to
leave questioners slightly uneasy &mdash; as intended.</p>


<h3>Two Classes of Attack</h3>

<p>I always told new admins that there two levels of threat to
systems: from outside and from inside. Conventional thinking
worries mostly about the former, e.g., the sort of perimeter
survey you get by running</p>

<pre>nmap -vv -sT -sR -O -n -oN tcpscan.log 10.0.1.3
nmap -vv -sU -sR -O -n -oN udpscan.log 10.0.1.3
nmap -vv -sA -sR -O -n -oN ackscan.log 10.0.1.3</pre>

<p>...from the far side of your LAN (a different machine)
against your IP=10.0.1.3 Linux host, to guesstimate how hard
the latter's (figurative) exterior shell is &mdash; in the event of
attack from elsewhere.</p>

<p>But the latter sort of threat &mdash; from the inside &mdash; is both
more worrisome and more interesting. That is, if there's a
entrance method (ssh, whatever) from the outside into your
machine, and someone steals the password or other token
required to use it, then you have unwelcome guests, who can
then subvert your system's security from its own command
prompt. It's well known that the latter step's often
successful, but the real news is how easily and frequently
passwords get stolen.</p>

<p>Consider inbound ssh access to your machine(s), a
convenience much used and cherished by Unix users. Do you ever
ssh in from machine you don't personally administer and have
absolute confidence in? Even if you don't, do you always carry
your ~/.ssh/known_hosts2 file with you, so you can be sure the
remote host you reach is really yours? If you're ever lax on
any of those matters, and you're even slightly unlucky, the bad
guys will steal your access tokens and enter masquerading as
you, later.</p>

<p>Even if you never do any of those things (making you a rare
paranoic, indeed), can you say the same of all the friends you
gave shell accounts to? Nobody ever used a cybercafe or
university computer, or used PuTTY on a family Windows box
teeming with spyware (or maybe even a keystroke-recording
dongle connected to the keyboard)? Thought not. And there's
your problem.</p>


<h3>The November Surprise</h3>

<p>Which brings us to November's security incidents. A timeline
should help us set the scene:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>2003-08-25:</strong> Release of kernel v. 2.4.22 with an undetected
memory-handling bug.</p>

<li><p><strong>September 2003:</strong> Andrew Morton discovers that no bounds
checking was being applied in kernel code to memory addresses
passed to the brk() system call. Neither he nor anyone else
posting to LKML is aware of the bug's security implications.
<em>However</em>, an unknown bad guy, reading the Changelogs, realises
those implications some time between this date and
2003-11-02.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-09-24:</strong> Andrew Morton commits a patch for the 2.6
kernel series.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-10-02:</strong> Marcelo Tosatti commits a patch for upcoming
v. 2.4.23.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-10-09:</strong> Fix for brk() bug becomes available in
2.4.23-pre7 snapshot.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-11-02:</strong> Unknown Bad Guy breaks into FSF's
savannah.gnu.org development host. Method of compromise is
later claimed to be the same as those of the other machines
mentioned below.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-11-19:</strong> Unknown Bad Guy exploits the bug to perform
local-user root compromise of Debian Project development server
named "master". From there, he compromises development servers
klecker, murphy, and gluck. At <em>no</em> point were the Debian
package archives compromised.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-11-20:</strong> Within one day, the Debian Project detects the
compromise and shuts down all four machines for forensics and
rebuild: Admins notice a suspicious pattern of kernel "oopses"
and confirm their suspicions through being advised by AIDE (an
IDS) on klecker, murphy, and gluck of unauthorised changes to
/sbin/init and /usr/lib/locale/en_US.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-11-28:</strong> Release of kernel v. 2.4.23, incorporating the
brk() fix.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-12-01:</strong> FSF discovers compromise of savannah.gnu.org
.</p>

<li><p><strong>2003-12-02:</strong> A Gentoo Project server (operated by a third
party) participating in the rsync.gentoo.org cluster is
compromised in what is claimed to be the same manner.
Compromise is detected <em>one hour</em> later by an IDS and a
file-integrity checker. No portage tree files (Gentoo software
"packages") are compromised.</p>
</ul>

<p>
You'll notice how quickly the Debian and Gentoo people realised
their problem, and corrected it &mdash; a point I'll come back to.
But the first point to note is how the bad guy entered to begin
with &mdash; a necessary first step before he could use the kernel
flaw.</p>

<p>It turns out that one of the 1000+ Debian developers had
been the victim of security-token theft. He used an ssh client
on some machine, somewhere, that happened to have already been
subverted. The ssh software was "trojaned" and privately logged
his Debian-server login credentials, later conveying those to
the attacker &mdash; who was then able to waltz in as if he were the
developer. Only then did he use the kernel bug to escalate
privilege to root-user access, something he might equally have
done by finding an un-patched flaw in any other piece of
security-sensitive software. The main point is: The intruder
got in despite everyone (probably) being reasonably cautious
and prudent, because one of his password-grabbing processes got
lucky somewhere.</p>


<h3>IDSes and Their Discontents</h3>

<p>Two things put an immediate halt to this malarkey at the
debian.org and gentoo.org sites. One was the presence of alert
sysadmins, who, in debian.org's case, noticed the pattern of
kernel "oopses" on two machines simultaneously, judged that far
too great a coincidence, and thus were tipped off. (Similar
alarm bells probably went through the gentoo.org admins' heads,
but far fewer incident details have emerged from them.)</p>

<p>The other was a much-lauded but little-used type of software
called host-based Intrusion Detection Systems, the classic
example of which is Tripwire, invented by Gene Spafford and
Eugene Kim at the fabled COAST security laboratory at Purdue
University from 1992 through 1994. For most of its history, it
was proprietary (with source code available for inspection but
no right to independently develop it), offered for sale 
to business, and with a "free for non-commercial use" 
edition called Tripwire Academic Source Release
(ASR) available for download.</p>

<p>Over time, Tripwire underwent a complete rewrite that
unfortunately did nothing about the program's nagging usability
issues (about which, more below), and then, under pressure from
open-source alternatives and with help from VA Linux Systems,
its sponsoring firm (Tripwire, Inc.) re-released Tripwire in
October 2000 as open source software under the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>CTO Eugene Kim has, since then, professed indignation at the
sparse participation in response by open source community
coders &mdash; but the firm's pride and joy turns out to be
non-portable C++ with no autoconf support. (Gosh, Gene, maybe
those antediluvian coding standards, bizarre choice of
language, and your firm's turning to open source only after mindshare
had already fled to more-open alternatives have something to do
with it?)</p>

<p>I remember Tripwire ASR; like most sysadmins, not at all
fondly &mdash; having attempted to start living with it in 1994 and
deciding it wasn't worth the hassle. It was and is an absolute
horror to set up. In theory, you write a description of what
files and directories (and what aspects of them) to check for
unauthorised changes, have it take a snapshot of the current,
non-compromised system state, and commit to disk all that
information in a cryptographically verifiable state. Nice
theory; teeth-grating execution.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the tools and configuration syntax are impenetrably 
obscure, every operation runs incredibly slowly, and its
system-integrity-checking mode churns out long and mostly
meaningless reports to the root user, which must be studied and
then used to further refine Tripwire's human-hostile ruleset to
gradually refocus its attention on system changes that actually
matter and cease reporting trivia. Because of the heavy use of
encryption, each of those steps tends to be dog-slow, and the
process must be run through iteratively, many times, using
expert knowledge of one's system, before the results start to
be useful and not just verbose babble.</p>

<p>Information overload, horrific configuration language, slow
and performance-sapping operation, twisted administrative
interface... argh! Save me from this! I quit wrestling with it,
within a week or two.</p>

<p>Not at all coincidentally, starting one year before Tripwire
went open source, it started getting serious open-source
competition, starting with AIDE, a package by Rami Lehti and
Pablo Virolainen in Finland. AIDE has lately been joined by
similar designs starting in 2001: Ed L. Kashin's Integrit,
Rainer Wichmann's Samhain, Yoann Vandoorselaere's Prelude IDS,
and no doubt others.</p>

<p>I considered using AIDE, when it emerged in August 1999, and
played with it a bit. Where Tripwire was slow and
system-clogging, AIDE was fast and light. Where Tripwire was
obscure and prone to breakage with puzzling errors, AIDE was
easy to understand and debug. It had one big problem: The
system-snapshot database, program binary, and configuration
file weren't stored with cryptographic verification (as Tripwire
does). The authors urged, instead, that those all be stored on
write-protected media and updated only as needed.</p>

<p>Keeping the AIDE files on floppy or CDR is a major nuisance.
The alternative, of just using them on the system's own hard
drive, is easier but tends to give a false sense of security.
That is, if/when the bad guy comes in and subverts your system,
isn't he going to subvert the IDS, too? So, when an IDS tells
you all is well, how do you know the bad guy isn't pulling its
puppet strings? Tripwire has an answer to that objection; AIDE
and friends do not.</p>

<p>That sort of false reassurance is the same one often
encountered among users of RPM-based systems reassured by the
results of running "rpm -Va" to "verify" the md5sum signatures
of installed files: The values are "verified" against a simple
Berkeley DB record in /var/lib/rpm &mdash; which of course a
competent intruder will update to match his changes.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I didn't run AIDE routinely. The Debian
Project developer boxes did, and it paid off &mdash; the intruder
having been sophisticated enough to leverage a
previously-unknown Linux kernel exploit, but not enough to
notice AIDE and sandbag it before it could inform on him.</p>


<h3>The Best of Both Worlds</h3>

<p>Following November's security incidents, and my
mother-in-law's raised eyebrow over us Linux old-fogies not
running host-based IDSes, I felt I had to revisit the matter,
and explore options. To my great fortune, the last piece
serendipitously arrived in a post to the debian-security
mailing list by Lupe Christoph:</p>

<blockquote>"We don't use AIDE exclusively at a client site, but in
combination with Tripwire. We think Tripwire is a little more
secure because it uses signed databases. So, we protect aide.db
with Tripwire. AIDE is used for the parts Tripwire can't do
because of its limited configurability...."</blockquote>

<p>Um... yeah. Why didn't I think of that? Whacking Tripwire's
configuration down to just the few minimum items it's best
suited to handle, including AIDE's own otherwise-unchecked
files, means the usual pain of using Tripwire fades into
background noise, and makes its operations run in less than
geologic time. Meanwhile, AIDE picks up the rest &mdash; and I don't
have to worry that I'm fooling myself into complacency like an
overconfident rpm user. It works a treat.</p>


<h3>Concluding Sermon</h3>

<p>My Web site's "Lexicon" page includes Moen's Laws, such
as:</p>

<blockquote>Moen's First Law of Security: "It's easier to break in from
the inside." E.g., many Internet break-ins result from
masquerading as a legitimate user to gain user-level access,
e.g., with sniffed passwords. The attacker then has a
dramatically wider field of system weak points he can attack,
compared to penetrating the system from outside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moen's Second Law of Security: "A system can be only as
secure as the dumbest action it permits its dumbest user to
perform." Your users are often your weakest link; smart bad
guys will attack you there (e.g., via social engineering).
Smart admins will try to compensate for this tendency, e.g., by
using multi-factor authentication instead of just
passwords.</blockquote>

<p>Between the two of those, one could have predicted the sort
of small calamity that overcame the Debian, Gentoo, and
Savannah projects in November. Given the considerable
likelihood of security tokens being stolen, especially on
machines used by many people, it's a wonder it didn't happen
sooner. The small miracle of that was that two of the three
detected and fixed the break-in immediately &mdash; courtesy of
host-based IDSes.</p>

<p>Detection is great, and better than a kick in the head (or
living in a fool's paradise), but what about prevention? One
way is to run an ssh daemon on an additional, non-standard port
(maybe 2222 instead of 22) that requires OPIE or S/Key one-time
passwords instead of regular, stealable ssh authentication.
More precisely, one-time passwords can certainly be stolen, but
then are useless because they've already been used up by the
authorised user.</p>

<p>One-time passwords are a nuisance to manage: You generate a
password "seed" and convey them somehow to your user. He either
carries around a printout in very small type of the resulting
series of 500 or so one-time passwords, crossing them off as
they're used up, or puts the seed in a PalmPilot and generates
those passwords from it using PalmKey, Strip, or pilOTP for
PalmOS.</p>

<p>I may not use such a setup every time I'm away from home and
tempted to cut corners &mdash; nor require my users to &mdash; but it
might be nice to have that option the next time I'm in a
cybercafe or some malware-infested bank of public Windows
machines at a trade show.</p>


<h3>Some Protective Measures to Ponder:</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Limiting remote shell (or similar) access, both by others
and by yourself</p>
<li><p>...especially when it's from machines of doubtful integrity
and/or shared-resource machines</p>
<li><p>Avoiding thinking you're lucky and trusting an unverified
host key</p>
<li><p>In other ways, avoid making the error of using ssh without
ensuring control of both ends, and avoid trusting the network
between them.</p>
<li><p>Carrying a copy of your ~/.ssh/known_hosts2 file with
yourself, e.g., on a USB flash drive in your pocket, so you can
know that the ssh connection home really is reaching your
machine rather than Prof. Moriarty's man-in-the-middle impostor
machine.</p>
</ul>

<p>Wichert Akkerman's page of information on the Debian.org
compromise includes some intriguing recommendations to add to
that, including some behavioural ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>not ever ssh'ing from one remote host to another</p>
<li><p>using unique keys and passphrases for each host</p>
<li><p>disabling ssh passwd access and using only keys
[public/private keypairs]</p>
<li><p>restricting the list of hosts that are allowed to ssh to your
systems</p>
</ul>

<p>The first of these is interesting and subtle: How many times
have you ssh'd to someone else's machine, and then scp'd a file
back to yourself ("pushing" it back to yourself)? Well, don't
do that. Instead, scp it in "pull" mode from your own machine's
command line:</p>

<p>$ scp username@remotehost:/tmp/somefile .</p>

<p>...rather than this form on remotehost's command line:</p>

<p>$ scp /tmp/somefile username@myhost:</p>

<p>Why? This gets back to the problem of stolen tokens, again:
When you initiate the scp from remotehost to "push" the file
back to where you are on myhost, you have to provide a
stealable security token on a machine you don't control and
have no reason to trust. "Pulling" the file from myhost poses
no such risk.</p>

<p>Hardly anyone follows Wichert's second recommendation
(unique passwords) because good passwords are too difficult to
remember. The human brain isn't wired to support that sort of
data retention. However, if you care enough about the problem,
you can use my solution of Keyring for PalmOS, an "electronic
wallet" for security tokens that stores them all in a
3DES-encrypted database, unlockable with a single password, so
you need remember only that one.</p>

<p>I would add to Wichert's recommendations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pay attention, and know your systems well.</p>
</ul>

<p>The debian.org admins, as it turned out, didn't
strictly need an IDS to know their machines had been
compromised: They noticed the suspicious pattern of kernel
"oopses", did a small amount of checking, and immediately drew
the right conclusion. The nightly report from AIDE served
mainly to confirm what they already knew. In general, an alert
sysadmin is by far your best protection.</p>

<p>Security in general is a tough problem. Screw-ups and people
shooting you in the foot are endemic, and meaningful
improvement comes at a cost in inconvenience. I've barely
scratched the surface of threat models that should be of
concern &mdash; and there are other checking tools such as
chkrootkit that are worth using. But I hope I've outlined some
of the low-hanging fruit that yields the biggest improvements
in areas that matter.</p>

<p>Tripwire, the original, classic host-based IDS. Notice that,
although Tripwire is self-checking, it has the problem in
common with all other host-based IDSes that intruders may
disable or tamper it, to sabotage its protection. However,
because every part of it, right down to the nightly reports, is
cryptographically signed, it has the advantage of being
extremely tamper-evident: If you ever fail to receive it
nightly report, or get one that fails to validate as genuine,
then you immediately know something's up. Having it check all
files of your other IDS(es) further extends this advantage to
those.<br>

("rootkits"). As such, it gives only negative reassurance of
"No, I don't see any of the signs I believe indicative of
rootkits my designer taught me to look for", and in that sense
is similar to a virus checker. Inherently, it cannot actually
rule out the presence of rootkits it doesn't know about, let
alone the intruders themselves.<br>

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/cabal/os-suck.html">sucked less</a>, he blew
away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and
support.  He helped plan the LINC Expo (which evolved into the first
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access
to a card-walloping IBM mainframe at Stanford (1969).  A glutton for
punishment, he then moved on (during high school, 1970s) to early HP
timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer
sessions, and so on.  He's thus better qualified than most, to know just
how much better off we are now.
