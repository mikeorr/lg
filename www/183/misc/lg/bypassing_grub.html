<p>
I often experiment with multiple distros (for learning/teaching value), by
installing them on my machine side by side. I then get to use a
specific distro/kernel by selecting it through GRUB, at boot time. Is there
some way to by-pass GRUB altogether and boot a specific kernel
manually ?
</p>

<p>
Let me be clear, I want to bypass GRUB and choose the kernel/distro
manually. It is not about  replacing the sick GRUB by a healthy GRUB.
</p>

<p>
I would appreciate any clue or pointer.
</p>

<p>
Thank you,

I assume by bypassing GRUB, you mean bypassing the GRUB menu. GRUB 0.9 allowed 
you to press 'c' (IIRC) to get a prompt where you could enter commands 
including selecting a kernel, setting boot parameters and telling it to boot 
with whatever settings you have given it. I assume GRUB2 is the same in this 
respect, but you would need to check that for yourself. I'm sure you can find 
plenty of information with Google.

Hi, Partha - I'm not very clear on what you're trying to do; it seems to
me that you're operating from an incorrect concept. If you have multiple
OSes, then you need some sort of a selection mechanism for them.
</p>

<p>
Given how little data the BIOS can work with, that first stage is pretty
tiny; there's really nothing there that's optional, or that can be
stripped out. In other words, you can have a single-boot system (MBR in
the first sector passing control to the OS-specific boot record
elsewhere) or a multi-boot system (IPL and partition table in the first
sector, second-stage "boot manager" that grabs the boot data from the
bootable partitions and passes control to the one you choose.) As a
result, there's no way to "just" boot one of a list of OSes without
having everything set up the second way.

Ted Dziuba has written steps on using chroots for trying out various 
distros 
&lt;<a href='http://teddziuba.com/2011/01/multiple-concurrent-linux-distros.html&gt;'>http://teddziuba.com/2011/01/multiple-concurrent-linux-distros.html&gt;</a>
</p>

<p>
If you are picky about "clean" environment,  you can think of using 
virtual machines to try out different distros (my preferred method, 
because CPU power is so cheap now)
