<H2> Welcome to the Linux HomeBoy WebPage! </H2>

<P>
Welcome to the Linux HomeBoy WebPage here in Nashville, Tennessee!
<b>Linux</b> is the ultra-cool &quot;copy-lefted&quot; UN*X like operating system 
developed to run on a variety of x86-based PC's.  It's the work of <b>Linus 
Torvalds</b>, <i>et.al</i> and is a freely available OS that can turn
your DOS/Windows box into an impressive workstation capable of running TCP/IP, X 
Window, and hundreds of unix programs.  It's a true multi-tasking, multi-user,
network capable OS that's as comfortable running on your home PC as it is the 
networked systems in commercial, industrial, and academic settings.

<P><H4>Pretty cool, eh?</H4>

<P>
Since the early 1990's, Linux has developed into a formidable operating 
system that is both robust and stable.  It's beauty is its ability to run on
x86-based systems -- from the modest 386's to Pentiums (it's in the process of
being ported to a variety of other platforms, so if you happen to have one of
those high end DEC Alpha's at home, you'll soon be in luck :-)  It will also 
peaceably coexist with a variety of other operating systems including DOS, OS/2, and 
Windows.  This means you can easily run a variety of apps under their native OS.
Linux will also let you access files directly from your DOS/Windows FAT partitions
or read from your OS/2 HPFS partitions.  There's ongoing work on <b>DOSEMU</b>,
a DOS emulator, and <b>WINE</b>, a Windows emulator, that will let you run your
DOS or Windows programs under Linux.  These are both in the development stages,
although DOSEMU, in particular, is maturing rapidly.  There is also a commercial
Macintosh emulator, <b>Executor</b>, for the Macophiles in the crowd!

<P>
Overall, you have to admit that this is a win-win situation!
Your current OS remains intact, you can continue running your current apps (if
you really <i>must</i> run &quot;Brand X&quot; OS we're not going to stop you... 
;-), and you get a GREAT OS with the ability to run a boatload of software!  

<H2>So... where to from here?</H2>

  Here's an unabashedly biased and admittedly slanted listing of my favorite 
  Linux software.  It includes descriptions, comments, and links to quickly 
  ftp the software.  Primarily, it's just the stuff I've found and like :-)
