<BR>Question by Guy Milliron (anonymous)

<P><STRONG>
Anyhow, I know it's simple, but I can't figure it out for the life of me.  I
use tcsh for my shell.  How would I alias a command to do a CD to a
directory of choice, and then automagically do an ls.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Long Hand:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong># cd [directory]
# ls -lag
</strong></pre>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[JimD]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>alias foo 'cd \!*; ls -lag'
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... works for me.  If you give it one argument that's where you are
 <TT>chdir()</TT>'d to.  No argument and you cd ~ and get a listing of your
home directory.  More args and you get an error from cd; just like
you'd expect from the cd command.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that aliases are subject to history expansion.  That's why I'm
using \!* --- which expands into foo's argument list whenever the
foo alias is used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that bash aliases DO NOT perform history expansion.  Thus you'd
use a shell function instead:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>function foo () { cd $1; ls -lag; }
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Where either the word function or the () are hints that this is a
function definition --- but both can be used, too).

<P><STRONG>
I did, however, find that the XF86Config-vesa worked (renamed to
XF86Config). Seems the Toshiba 2400 likes this Vesa configuration. This
config doesn't seem to have any other unwanted side effects; I copied
it from the default and there doesn't seem to be any localisation
issues - we'll see.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
It is nice that "vesa" does what you want. However, note that the "vesa"
configuration is not "accelerated" which means that window
movement/mapping and animations will seem sluggish. Perhaps you could
try one of the other XF86config files at the site and tell us (on this
list) what happened.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The problem may also be with the "nv" driver and you could try out the
drivers from nVidia as explained at the site.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In any case, now that XFree86 supports generic "vesa" it is certainly
much easier to get a basic working GUI under Linux than it used to
be---at least for newer machines.

Do you switch this in the bios?

I will just give you two hints.

In my case I use to power down and use the removable drive switch to disable

I can imagine that this dous not work in all systems.

If you use lilo on the first disk to startup lilo in the mbr of the

consider putting lilo in hdb1 and not in hdb.

<P>
I know that this stumps people from time to time, Knoppix itself is cool but using it for a rescue environment is a little sneakier.
</P>
<P>
First and foremost unless your idea of rescue is "find a file and ftp or scp it to somewhere else" kill the darn automounter.  Run:
<TT>/etc/init.d/autofs</TT> stop
</P>
<P>
Wait a few moments then make sure to use 'ps was' or 'ps fax' and make sure it is good and properly dead. Use 'kill -9' on the automounter if you have to.
</P>
<P>
Next thing is, you <EM>can</EM> use ctrl-alt-f1 or even ctrl-alt-F2 to get a prompt; over on tty1 just press ENTER and it's there already.  When I'm really deep into thoughts of rescue the whole gorgeous GUI thing just gets in my way.  If you'd rather stay in the GUI though, you'll have to launch konsole (or an xterm) and run 'sudo su -' ... and it won't ask a password.  (That's also a warning to those of you who use Knoppix just because it makes Linux easy to show to your pals...)
</P>
<P><CODE>
Then I cd /mnt and see a gazillion (that's a technical term) hd* and sd* entries.  I use e2label religiously to label my volumes, or create them with -L options so they have them; RH distros make the volumes with labels; other distros might too.  So you've a pretty good chance of getting some useful answer out of this:
</CODE></P>

<blockquote><pre>cd /mnt
for i in hd* sd* ; do echo -n "$i: " ; e2label /dev/$i ; done
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Yeah, yeah, I know, if you use reiser or somehting that won't help, but the heartening thing is knoppix supports extra journaling fs' too, including XFS (Klaus merges SGI's XFS patches into his kernels).
</P>
<P>
I also mkdir my own mountpoint - my favorite <TT>/mnt/pt</TT> (mount point, get it?) or <TT>/mnt/t</TT> (for target) and mount my poor benighted root fs there, then read its etc/fstab for what else to mount.  Then you can safely chroot in and tweak lilo, or install that important package.  If you are installing packages, some need <TT>/proc</TT> mounted to behave well... and then you'll need to recall to umount <TT>/proc</TT> in there too.  Don't forget to umount all this stuff yourself before you reboot.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, if you use knoppix to do a local install, get rid of or at least properly configure that annoying little MTA smail. Almost nobody will relay <A HREF="mailto:newuser@knoppix"
	>newuser@knoppix</A> and that's what your outbound mail will look like it's from if you don't do something about it.  Compared to that, fending off vestiges of German configuration is more charming than troublesome

<P>
Hi all,
</P>
<P>
Back around mid-April 2003 I posted a reply to a querant about md5sum's, and
mentioned that I often use Ed Olson's WinMD5 on one or another of my Win
boxes when downloading and burning Linux distro .iso's (got to get that
Linux system up for doing that sort of thing!)  Ed sent me the
following message regarding my original posting, and announcing the
availability of his latest version of WinMD5 (v2.0), so I thought I
would pass it on.  I've been using v1.1 of his program for awhile now,
with no problems at all.
</P>
<P>
BTW his v2.0 requires M$ .NET Framework (preferably v1.1 or newer)
installed to run.  It's available via Windoze Update on Win98/2K/XT systems.
</P>
<P>
HTH

<blockquote><font color="#000066">It's still the current version, it's still a nice little app, and I'm

connection??????????/
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[K.-H.] 
Certainly -- proxy is for the http (maybe ftp) protocol. This protocol
definition includes a port number, usually 80. telnet on the other hand is a
service usually not available to everybody and usually connecting to port 23
-- which is not covered by standard proxy services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since you wanted to study network protocols you <EM>probably</EM> wanted to telnet
to the webserver on any of the machines you tried.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That could be done by:
telnet www.whatever.com 80
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
the 80 specifies that you do not want to connect to the regular telnet port
(which should not be available on any big webserver as its a gaping security
hole) but to the http-server which is listening on port 80.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Maybe this gets you started in the right direction (i.e. start reading
documentation).

That question is completely confused. Read
<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://www.linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A>
to get an idea how to ask a good question. It would help to tell <EM>what</EM>
netscape is doing/not doing. proxy setting in netscape. output of
<TT>/sbin/route</TT> -n  (one of the tools you ask for) would also help in finding out
whats the problem.

Generally:

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
Your computer has an IP-adress attached to each of its interfaces. It is
127.0.0.1 on interface lo (loop back), it might have ethernet connections
like eth0 with local IP-adresses (e.g. 10.10.10.1) and once you've dialed out
via modem/ISDN you've a [i]ppp0 interface which got a dynamic IP adress
assigned. That might be any IP-adress.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The IP-traffic is directed by routing, thats's the roadmap which tells the
kernel where to send each IP packet depending on the IP. A packet to
127.0.0.1 will be passed to interface lo, while with appropriate
netmask/broadcast setting any packet to 10.x.x.x will be passed to eth0.
To direct all unknown (outside) IP-adresses to [i]ppp0 you would set a
default route (shows up as 0.0.0.0 in route outpute) specifying where to send
all the traffic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If your netscape doesn't see the outside, it's because the packets go wrong
(or the interface is not up and running).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
interfaces are checked with ifconfig, routes with route [-n].
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
WLAN is no different, looks like an ethernet but has some special tools for
the interface and status: iwconfig, iwspy, iwlist, iwpriv,...
route is the same.

has a Linux-setup for 802.11b cards. There are links to the wireless-tools
which will help diagnose and set WLAN specific things.
