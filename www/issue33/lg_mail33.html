I find it hard to believe that every one thinks that all people know how
to operate linux perfectly, and that all are born with this information.
This must be the case for I cannot find a site on the web that teaches
you how to operate Linux (and I am desperate to find one), I have run
into people using windows 95&98 (12 people) that would like to try Linux
but cant find out how to operate it (there is a real good deal at best
buy on Red Hat Linux) so I bought it and a new Western Digital hard
drive to put it on, though my trying to find somewhere that teaches
Linux, I came upon an article that says you can have Linux and windows
on the same computer while learning Linux, and after learning you can
delete windows. Sooooooo how about giving us articles on how to utilize
this great OS, and help hundreds us poor lost souls that are desperate.
thank you

Last month I printed a <A HREF="../issue32/lg_mail32.html#kooij">letter</A> from Hugo van der Kooij in which he asked me
to quit using the word "Damn" in the Table of Contents of <i>Linux
Gazette</i>. I said I would put it to a vote. Well, I received quite a bit
of mail on this issue, and the vote was essentially 6 to 1 in favor of
keeping this word. 
<P> 
That said, I intend to renege on my statement that I
would abide by the vote. Much of the mail I received is not printable, and
some of it is quite entertaining. The best, most well-thought out answer I
received is printed directly below, and this letter alone convinced me that
I should accede to Hugo's request. From now on I intend to call that
section containing the entire issue TWDT -- this is the best compromise I
could think of. We all know what TWDT stands for, it will just not be printed 
there. Newcomers may be a bit confused but they'll survive.
<P> 
Enough said. This is my final decision, so please don't write asking me to
change my mind. As many reminded me, we have more important things to spend our
time considering, such as helping others to learn and love Linux as we do.

They are generally quite excellent people (most of the Dutch

such as no swearing.

<P>
	Now and then I've found myself reading an article in an issue of the
gazette and thinking of a past article that I read in a previous issue,
both belonging to the same section (normally the Graphics Muse). Since I
would like to read again that past article and I never remember in which
issue it was published, I have to go to the main page, select an issue
an view the table of contents, and finally click on the section I'm
interested in. It would be much quicker if "last"/"next" buttons between
articles of different issues but belonging to the same section were
available. That way, if I were reading the Graphics Muse's article of
this month and he mentions something about OpenGL, I might remember
there was an article on this subject (OpenGL) a couple of past issues;
then, with the aid of the "last" button, I would start reviewing past
articles of the Graphics Muse until I found the one I was interested in.
<P>
	Maybe this is a bit complicated to implement, but I think it would
certainly be a great improvement. Another application would be: a
quicker way to find an article belonging to a certain section whose
subject is not listed in the table of contents. The search engine of the
gazette is only available online.
<P>
Thanks for the marvelous job your doing with the gazette:

As a computer user and technology observer for the past 20 years
I fear the domination of the tech sector by one very large corporation

the quality of it's products, but rather for the intensity of it's 
marketing of it's products.

Windows 98 works ok for me, but I'm frustrated by it's instability.

I have installed Red Hat 5.0 on my IBM ThinkPad 380, but can't get the

I have looked at the manuals and checked the newsgroups, the web sites
but still can't get the X windows parts up and running.  I'm not a tech
dummy.  I've played with complicated systems before.  Understand C, Rexx,
Pascal, Delphi, and others.

I purchased the Red Hat brand of Linux chiefly because of the 90 day
installation support.
In a nutshell, at first I'm told
some very basic things which I had already tried, then when I ask if an
alternative was a viable solution (recompiling the kernel with PnP built
in) I was told that my problem  was no longer covered under the
installation support. I still don't have sound and as for my other open
tickets, only one other was responded to (after weeks) and I haven't heard
back on the rest.  So I'm not on the Internet yet, I have no sound yet, and I'll 
never recommend Red Hat to anyone because of their support.

Subject: <font color="maroon">Linux acceptance</font> 
<P>
I've seen quite a number of letters stating that to improve Linux
acceptance it should have an easier to use GUI et all.
<P>
I'm not sure I'd agree entirely with this.  The point where Linux is
making inroads is not in the desktop arena.  I'll most likely attract
lots of flames for this, but Microsoft has done a reasonable job in
making their desktop products useful, and easy to use.  How many people
need the manual with Word or Excel ?
<P>
Sure, it crashes frequently for some people, but for a large number of
users it doesn't matter because they shut down the machine at the end of
the day, conveniently saving slow memory leaks from exposure.  And I
have a W95 system that tends to get rebooted every two weeks, just to
clear it up.  No need to do it more often.  So that community has zero
interest in an alternative, other than for cost saving reasons.  To
convince those people you'll have to give them something that is nearly
as easy to use, at a lower cost -and that includes staff costs for
setting it up.  What is needed here is a way of actually restricting the
richness of the XWindows interface so users don't get the chance to
shoot themselves in both feet and reduce support needs.  I'm sure it is
possible, but there has been no concise effort towards this idea.  KDA,
Gnome and Enlightenment are extremely impressive efforts, but they
enrich the setup, not lock it down for Johnny EndUser who just wants to
run his word processor.  Give them a command line and they'll panic
;-(...
<P>
Where Linux *IS* making a difference is in the server arena.  If a
desktop crashes it affects one (1) user, if a server crashes it takes
everyone down who's connected.  Instantly, the impact on productivity is
amplified.  What creates reluctance to accept Linux as an alternative is
the lack of people to shout at if it goes wrong.  Also, there are only
now a few companies that offer a Service Level Agreement on support for
Linux, and lack of support is a very nervous thing if you run mission
critical applications.  Yes, I agree with many that the main issue is
not support, but not having a need for it, but one has to deal with
disaster recovery as well, and overall system management.  Only now CA
has brought out some management modules for Linux (to make Linux systems
visible in Unicenter TNG).  And I'm not aware of any HP OpenView MIBs
for Linux (if there are I'd be very happy to hear of them and I'd like
to see both of these packages themselves run on Linux).
<P>
Any company that wants to use Linux wholesale will want to manage it,
and until hard commercial tools are there this won't happen unless
through the back door.
<P>
I would be very happy to see an alternative to NT, if only just for
keeping MS on their toes.  Linux is very hard on its way to become that
alternative, but I'm not sure it is entirely there yet.  Support from
SUN, Oracle, CA and Netscape makes a difference, but it takes more than
that to change a corporate strategy.  Case studies where Linux is shown
to be a viable Enterprise OS with the associated cost savings, improved
reliability, manageability and all that goes with being a grown up OS
will do more to convince the board than any other well-meant effort.
<P>
Just an observation....
<P>
For the record:
<P>
I myself use Red Hat Linux 5.1 on most of my home systems (except the one
W95 box) and on my Toshiba 480CDT (HOWTO web page appearing shortly), and
I've used virtually every version of Windows and DOS since DoubleDOS
appeared, and all versions of OS/2 since v2.  I've been a Linux user for
about 6 years, having had no previous exposure to Real Operating Systems
&lt;g&gt;.  So I'm not an expert, but I'm not entirely clueless either ;-).

From: Ian Carr-de Avelon, <A HREF="mailto:ian@emit.pl">ian@emit.pl</A> <BR> 
Subject: <font color="maroon">GUI and novices</font> 
<P>
This is my response to the letters by James Mitchell (Sep  98) and Antony
Chesser (Aug 98).
Well designed GUI's speed up the learning process because the user can see
that there is a possibility. The user may have no idea what the icon of
scissors will do, or even recognize that they are scissors, but if there
is a button you learn very quickly you can click on it with the mouse and
so lets give it a try. That simple peace of knowledge, that buttons can
be pressed, will get you quite a way in a GUI. Knowing that you could 
use "&lt;esc&gt;d5" in vi will not take you nearly as far. 
Not only novices benefit, also it is a major help to users who work 
with a program only occasionally. Finding the button which does "that"
is easier than remembering a sequence of keys. Microsoft have added
standardization. You click on the little x button and the program stops.
A command line program could require you to type: end, quit, exit, bye...
etc. Even with a foreign language version of Windows you can normally
manage a few things, just because the layout is standard.
I run a local ISP so I have used Linux daily for over 2 years, almost
exclusively in command line mode. I understand its strengths but I can
still recognize the problems which other users would have. Possibly
that is because I visit clients to help them with their problems, or
maybe it is because I worked as a teacher and later as a designer of
educational material. At any rate I can see that Linux is not yet a real
option for most users and anyone who cannot should offer a few hours 
of their time to support new users, the revelation would come quite
soon.
<P> 
This is a truth which I find quite painful to take, because there
is nothing about the Linux OS which makes it so.  The installation
does not have to end with # prompt and Linux has not just one but
several GUIs available any of which could be used in a consistent
way by well designed programs. Although Microsoft have done more
work in that respect, they are as far from being the best that their
could ever be as their OS is in other ways.
Many people who really want to see Linux being more widely adopted 
feel that this does not matter. Linux is being adopted for server
applications and they hope that that will be enough to get people
to make the effort to learn how to use it. My feeling is that
most users choose NT because it looks like 95 which they have on 
their work station. Linux needs to selectable for basic office tasks 
before it will be widely accepted. Maybe Linux Gazette should run a 
competition for a best GPL suit for novice users:
<ul>
<li>Windows Manger
<li>email program
<li>Browser
<li>Editor
<li>Spread Sheet
</ul>
<P>
A small novice package which could be included in most distributions and 
start up at boot time or alternatively with a standard command like
"desktop". Would make it much easier to say to clients who's win95 has 
died again "Why don't you let me install Linux for you?"

<P>
Ijust have read some of the Linux Gazette. It contains quite a bunch
of useful information. On many pages some of that information is for
me difficult or impossible to read.
<P>
The reason is that &lt;B&gt; bold text &lt;/B&gt; is hardly visible in the browser
i use. (lynx 2.7.2 beta, alternative, an even older version)
The machine that acts as a terminal to the Novell Server only has a
monochrome screen. As you may have concluded from stating the Server,
it is beyond my abilities as user to install a graphical browser.
I wish to read the Linux Gazette though and cannot do that on my home
computer because i do not have an internet connection there.
<P>
If you'd use other tags like the Italic tags &lt;I&gt;.. &lt;/I&gt; or the
Font tags &lt;Font size+1&gt;...&lt;/Font size&gt; people like me would be
able to read your Gazette. The browser ignores unknown tags but
it does support the bold tags and displays it awkward. 
<P>
Here at our institute nearly 5000 students use the same browser to
regularly visit the web. Although we all wouldd prefer using a graphical
browser that is not likely to happen within reasonable time. Using
the other tags in the future however would be only a small effort
for you.
<P> 
Stefan Zandburg
<blockquote><I> I sympathize with you, but
bold and italic are used for two different purposes. If I always used
italics, the difference in emphasis would not be apparent. There is also
the problem that most articles come to me already tagged and I don't have
the time to change them. I will think about this though and see what I can
come up with. I mainly use bold for the subject lines of letters. That I
can change easily. Consider it done. --Editor </I> </blockquote>

Many of you may have seen these results, but I hadn't seen
anything on any of these lists, so here it is:
<P>
Based on surveys of 810,000 European Internet servers, the 
Linux Operating System is the most used OS on the Internet.
Three different categories were polled, web servers, FTP servers,
and news servers. Not only was Linux number one in each category,
but there wasn't even a consistent number two.
Linux's market share went from 25.7% for news servers, to 26.9%
for web servers, to 33.7% for FTP servers.
In order to get a number two position in web servers and FTP servers,
Windows 95/98 was lumped together with Windows NT.
They aren't the same system. For news servers, Solaris came in second.

<P>
I ordered the GIMP CD from WilberWorks quitre some time ago and have
heard nothing.  E-mails have been ignored; I am getting ready to
actually call them  I wonder if others have had trouble with them?  At
their web site their FAQ includes several questions from people
wondering where their CDs are--but those are fairly old, so either
people wised up (except me) or they improved.
<P> 
Thanks--<BR>

More mainstream press!  And in a rather high-brow weekly CEO/CIO type
periodical.
The September 21st, 1998 issue of Computer World has it on page 34 in
their "Computer World Quick Study" column.  Very well done, IMPO.  Also
references Red Hat and <I>Linux Journal</I>.  
<P>
With it in this paper, hopefully, the CIOs and CEOs will start talking
with their technical people, trying to find out more about this OS.
Normaly when I see the CEO heading twards me, I try to find somewhere to
hide, but if he wants to ask about Linux, hey... I can talk to him as
long as he likes!
<P>
Later...<BR>

Subject: <font color="maroon">In Praise of Wabi</font> 

<P>With Wabi selling for $45 or less, I wanted to share my satisfaction
with this product in case anyone else is interested. I have been running
WIN 3.1 and Wabi on top of Linux for about five months with very good results.
It lets me use several Win 3.1 (16 bit) applications, primarily Quicken
4 and MS Office 4.2, that previously forced rebooting into DOS. I am running
a 200 MHz Pentium with 32M of memory. No problems with memory (about 13MB
to run Quicken, WIN 3.1, and Wabi) and only a small speed hit (20-30%)
on calculation intensive operations. I use the printer, floppy, and modem
under Wabi, but no sound, as advertised. Wabi has limited printer drivers,
but if your Linux is set up to print Postscript, using Ghostscript drivers
for your printer, it will work fine. My Powerpoint viewgraphs, including
art, look identical under Wabi, printing to Postscript and under Win95,
printing directly to PCL. The Windows clipboard works as expected, and
in addition I can cut and paste between Windows and X Window applications.

<P>Wabi accesses my application and data files in the DOS/Win95 partition,
so I could convert transparently from DOS over to Wabi -- a nice trick
for Wabi to look through Linux back to the DOS file system. Though I haven't
tried it, I expect I could see files on my other networked computers using
SAMBA. My total extra disk space is 12MB for Wabi, and 24MB for WIN 3.1
files. You need a copy of WIN 3.1, WIN 3.11, or WIN for Workgroups in addition
to Wabi. WIN95 won't work. As a bonus, you can run Windows applications
remotely using an X-terminal, such as another Linux box. This is like Citrix
Winframe, but a heck of a lot cheaper.

<P>Is it a perfect fit? Not quite. I have a formatting problem printing
checks from Quicken on my ancient FX80 dot matrix printer, and there are
a few quirks such as a disappearing cursor and "bleed through" from background
windows in Quicken. But I consider these minor nuisances that don't reduce
utility. Sure, I can't use 32 bit Win apps, and some might say that Quicken
4 and MS Office 4.2 are ancient. But I have Quicken 96, 97, and 98 as well
as Office 97 sitting on my shelf. I tried them and for my needs there was
no more useful functionality, just more bloat and glitz. You make your
own decision; I found $45 a good deal.
<P>
