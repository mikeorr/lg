Thank you very much for pointing that out, Martin.

<p>
One of the things that people in the online world often forget, and that
I myself forget occasionally, is that companies almost never move on
Internet time:  Policies and programs just don't change overnight in the
corporate world.  In this case, by the standard of most companies, Red
Hat's corrective action was very speedy, and I commend them highly on 
what is reported to be their thorough and serious approach to the issue.
