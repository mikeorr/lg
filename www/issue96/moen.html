<h1>A Brief History of Linux Gazette</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</A></b></p>

<p>
<P><CITE>-- Several LG Editors contributed to this article.</CITE>

<p><strong>July 1995 (#1):</strong> <em>Linux Gazette</em>
("<em>LG</em>") is created by founding editor John M. Fisk &mdash; back
in the Slackware 2.0 days &mdash; as part of his Linux HomeBoy Web
pages in Nashville, Tennessee, while studying as a General
Surgery resident and Research Fellow at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center &mdash; as a magazine to "pass along some of the ideas
that I've tried, liked, and have worked for me".</p>

<p>Local Internet provider Tennessee CommerceNet graciously
offers to host it at 
<a stub="http://www.tenn.com/fiskhtml/gazette_toc.html"><tt>http://www.tenn.com/fiskhtml/gazette_toc.html</tt></a>.</p>

<p>Over a large part of the <em>Gazette</em>'s history, John also
authors the magazine's Weekend Mechanic column.</p>

<p><strong>August 1995 (#2):</strong> John introduces our
signature line, "Making Linux just a little more fun".</p>

<p><strong>September 1995 (#3):</strong> <em>Linux Gazette</em>'s
tradition of simple, lightweight graphics and markup is
introduced. The "Two Cent Tip" and MailBag (later, "Mailbag")
columns also make their debuts, as does an early version of the
<em>Linux Gazette</em> FAQ.</p>

<p><strong>October 1995 (#4):</strong> With help from Matt Welsh
and Greg Hankins, John's growing magazine becomes officially
adopted as a publication of the Linux Documentation Project. At
the same time, LG clarifies that copyright will remain with
individual contributors, but that issue contents will be
redistributable under a BSDish licence. The first official mirror
is volunteered by Donnie Barnes, Marc Ewing, and Erik Troan at
Red Hat Linux, Inc. (later renamed Red Hat, Inc.).</p>

<p><strong>November 1995 (#5):</strong> Additional mirrors are
introduced by Phil Hughes of SSC, Inc. and by Alan Cox in the UK.
More are invited. ftp-able copies appear for the first time.
Michael J. Hammel's popular monthly column "Graphics Muse"
debuts.</p>

<p><strong>January 1996 (#6):</strong> The tradition of including
<em>Linux Gazette</em> issues on CD-ROMs was launched by Pacific
HighTech, Inc. (later renamed TurboLinux, Inc.), on its monthly
"Linux Archive Monthly CD-ROM".</p>

<p><strong>March 1996 (#7):</strong> John invites broader
participation (more editors), having been somewhat
overwhelmed.</p>

<p><strong>August 1996 (#8):</strong> SSC, Inc., publisher of
Linux Journal, volunteers to become the primary hosting site,
replacing Tennessee CommerceNet, and allowing it to remain a
non-commercial magazine.</p>

<p><strong>September 1996 (#9):</strong> <em>Linux Gazette</em>
switches to an open license, roughly BSDish, fairly similar to
the later OPL. Marjorie L. Richardson becomes editor (very ably
assisted by Amy Kukuk, and sometimes others).</p>

<p><strong>October 1996 (#10):</strong> John M. Fisk's Weekend
Mechanic column first appears (later revived by Thomas Adam).</p>

<p><strong>January 1997 (#13):</strong> Jim Dennis submits a
feedback letter to the editor, in which he offers to answer
questions sent to the LG editor of a more technical nature.
Marjorie forwards such questions from readers, and then publishes
Jim's replies as the "Answer Guy" column, much to Jim's surprise.
The column becomes one of the <em>Gazette</em>'s most popular
features.</p>

<p><strong>February 1997 (#14):</strong> The first translated
edition (Italian) is launched by Francesco De Carlo and other
volunteers at LUGBari.</p>

<p><strong>March 1997 (#15):</strong> <em>Linux Gazette</em>
picks up a commercial sponsor, InfoMagic (a now-vanished
mail-order CD house).</p>

<p><strong>October 1997 (#22):</strong> Viktorie Navratilova
serves as editor.</p>

<p><strong>December 1997 (#23):</strong> Riley P. Richardson
fields the editorship, assisted by Marjorie Richardson and Amy
Kukuk. Marjorie takes it back in March 1998.</p>

<p><strong>May 1998 (#28):</strong> Many more mirror sites have
been joining the network. Heather Stern reworks the growing
"Answer Guy" column's design to improve its graphics and make the
column more Web-functional &mdash; and becomes the column's maintainer.
Jim Dennis begins offering Greetings as editorial blurbs, in
addition to his answers.</p>

<p><strong>June 1999 (#42):</strong> Webmaster Mike Orr takes
over as editor, assisted by Marjorie Richardson, Heather Stern,
and Jim Dennis.</p>

<p><strong>October 1999 (#46):</strong> The final "Graphics Muse"
column appears, as Michael J. Hammel consolidates his diverse
writings onto his <a href="http://www.graphics-muse.org/">own Web
site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>February 2000 (#50):</strong> Shane Collinge's cartoon
HelpDex first appeared, unsolicited. Mike noticed it and
<em>LG</em>'s first cartoon series was born.</p>

<p><strong>March 2000 (#51):</strong> SSC starts "talkback" Web
facilities hyperlinked from each <em>Gazette</em> article.
Unfortunately, recently (October 2003), all those forums and
their contents have been erased during site reorganisation, and
are lost. (This breakage illustrates one of the problems with
dynamic content, which violates the <em>Gazette</em> staff's
policy of each issue having static content in order to be
mirror-friendly.)</p>

<p><strong>Summer 2000 (#54-56):</strong> The Answer Guy invites
some friends among the <em>Linux Gazette</em> crew, and a few
others whose answers have been useful, to join him in handling
the flood of questions. Heather Stern steps up to handle the
editorial blurb and train some scripts to help keep the answers
conversational. In July, a handful of people all answer, and by
August "The Answer Gang" is properly established. Thomas Adam
later pitches in to help out, getting cross-trained in the large
Perl script she uses to manage the TAG mailboxes.</p>

<p><strong>September 2000 (#57):</strong> <em>Linux Gazette</em>
formally changes to the Open Publication License (OPL).</p>

<p><strong>November 2000 (#59):</strong> In response to
increasing requests from tradeshow staff, a masthead is
established, listing Mike Orr as editor, Heather Stern as
Technical Editor, and Michael "Alex" Williams, Don Marti, and Ben
Okopnik as Contributing Editors, and Jim Dennis as Senior
Contributing Editor. Over succeeding issues, Michael Williams
leaves, and Dan Wilder joins. <em>Linux Gazette</em> is mirrored
in over 40 countries at this point.</p>

<p><strong>May 2001 (#66):</strong> Thomas Adam revives the
Weekend Mechanic column, last submitted by <em>Gazette</em>
founder John M. Fisk in 1998.</p>

<p><strong>October 2001 (#71):</strong> Linux Journal sprouts a
PHPNuke-based Web site; the idea starts kicking around the back
halls at SSC that maybe <em>LG</em> would be a good candidate for
turning into a site based on some sort of Web forum, too.</p>

<p><strong>Winter 2001:</strong> SSC publisher Phil Hughes moves
residences from Seattle to Costa Rica. Some months later, the
entire SSC Web operation (hosting for ssc.com, linuxjournal.com,
and linuxgazette.com) moves to Costa Rica with him.</p>

<p><strong>September 2002 (#82):</strong> Javier Malonda's
bilingual (Spanish / English) comic strip Ecol joins the
<em>Gazette</em>. The magazine gets a fairly nice new logo.</p>

<p><strong>November 2002 (#84):</strong> Mike Orr revamps
<em>Linux Gazette</em>'s technical structure, to eliminate
symbolic links (problematic for MS-Windows systems), to give the
single-page ASCII and HTML versions consistent URLs, and to re-do
the magazine-production scripts in <a href=
"http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a>, with fixed elements generated
from <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">Cheetah</a>
templates. Ben Okopnik introduces the Perl One-Liner of the Month
column &mdash; if Sam Spade were a Perl hacker...</p>

<p><strong>Autumn 2002 - Winter 2003:</strong> Marketing within
SSC would like to jazz up <em>LG</em>. Their idea of how to do
this is to create Web forums. A prototype PHPNuke-based site is
created, but it doesn't work out; it's scrapped without release
to the public. The <em>Gazette</em> staff wants veto power over
any more planned changes. "Of course. You guys
<strong>*are*</strong> <em>Linux Gazette</em>. Without you it
wouldn't be anything."</p>

<p><strong>March 2003 (#88):</strong> Mike Orr, editor of
<em>LG</em>, leaves his employ at SSC. The rest of the
<em>Gazette</em> staff are informed, and he spends a few more
months editing <em>LG</em> as a volunteer effort. Some are
concerned that SSC may not want to host us further; mild
inquiries are made, and it doesn't seem to be the case. Any
question of such a jump is ended by a call from Phil Hughes,
clarifying SSC's commitment to keep Linux Gazette a continuing
magazine, and that article submissions would continue as before,
unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>May 2003:</strong> Scott (SSC's webmaster) wrote Mike
Orr and said Phil wanted him to take over the job of publishing
the articles, to learn the spirit of the magazine while planning
a better CMS engine. Unfortunately, he didn't get a chance to
publish an issue; he was laid off by SSC.</p>

<p><strong>June 2003 (#91):</strong> Mike jumps in on short
notice to release June's issue.</p>

<p>WorldWatch,
claiming to be a daily digest of useful articles about Linux,
appears as a subdomain of linuxgazette.com. This was probably the
result of yet another effort towards preparing a CMS-based
magazine, but doesn't particularly resemble the true
<em>Gazette</em> focus, so, other than to mention it in News
Bytes, the staff ignore it.</p>

<p><strong>July 07, 2003:</strong> Mike announces to the staff on
the admin mail list that Jeff, SSC's webmaster, will become our
new editor. He's welcomed. Jeff disclaims the editor title, and
says plans include a CMS-driven site with "self-editing"
features. Reaction in general is doubtful, and staff first make
plans to leave if that's the best way to keep publishing a periodic
magazine. Submission rate and quality noticeably declines; some
authors start holding material back.</p>

<p><strong>August 2003 (#93):</strong> Jeff Tinsler announces on
the issue's Back Page Mike Orr's departure, saying there will no
longer be an editor. However, editorial matters are still
discussed on the admin list, and the masthead remains.</p>

<p><strong>September 2003 (#94):</strong> The issue releases in
ordinary style, minus a few articles due to missed deadlines.</p>

<p><strong>October 2003 (#95):</strong> Heather Stern sends off
her portion of the issue (TAG, Tips, and Mailbag) for public
release. Several days later, a sharp-eyed observer notices the
"Gazette Matters" topic, describing SSC's plans and the staff's
concerns, is mysteriously missing from the Mailbag article.
Queries to SSC about the deletion go unanswered. Most mirrors
carry the damaged edition (and later it turns out that other
articles are being silently deleted from prior issues, likewise
reflected out to the mirrors).</p>

<p>As it is still unknown which CMS software is planned to be
used for the release, the staff confer, with the eventual
consensus that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>SSC's CMS may end up being a fine Web discussion forum of
  some sort, but (being neither periodic, edited, nor a magazine)
  clearly won't be Linux Gazette.</li>

  <li>they find it disturbing that a hosting site (such as SSC)
  would suddenly turn completely uncommunicative towards the
  magazine staff and make unauthorised and unannounced edits to
  the published text.</li>
</ol>

<p>They therefore prepare to move to new hosting, courtesy of
software engineer T.R. Fullhart, with Mike Orr to return as
overall editor.</p>

<p><strong>End of October 2003:</strong> The promised CMS-driven
site appears, replacing all previously existing Gazette contents
at http://www.linuxgazette.com/ .
</p>

<p>The staff notice old articles being loaded into the CMS
stripped of author attribution and/or authors' copyright notices,
and help SSC identify and correct these problems. At our press
time for this November 2003 issue, most such copyright violations
have been cleared up and only a couple remain.</p>

<p>The staff assemble a full set of back issues from the LG          
packages in Debian, which have not been corrupted by deletions or             
alterations, and rebuild the mirror network.</p>

<p><strong>October 28, 2003:</strong> Writing on behalf of LG's
staff, Rick Moen formally requests that SSC correct its damaged
back issues and cede the domain name linuxgazette.com to the
active Linux Gazette staff, if they are not interested in
mirroring the new site.</p>

<p><strong>November 2003 (#96):</strong> You are here. This is
the first issue published at Linux Gazette's new home: 
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/">http://linuxgazette.net/</a>.

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/cabal/os-suck.html">sucked less</a>, he blew
away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and
support.  He helped plan the LINC Expo (which evolved into the first
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access
to a card-walloping IBM mainframe at Stanford (1969).  A glutton for
punishment, he then moved on (during high school, 1970s) to early HP
timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer
sessions, and so on.  He's thus better qualified than most, to know just
how much better off we are now.

<P> When not playing Silicon Valley dot-com roulette, he enjoys
long-distance bicycling, helping run science fiction conventions, and
concentrating on becoming an uncarved block.
