<h1>How To Enable Desktop Icons for Lightweight Window Managers</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/murray.html">John Murray</A></b></p>

<h3>About IDesk</h3>

<p>Despite the enormous popularity of GNOME and KDE, many
users elect to use lighter, simpler window managers instead of
the full-blown desktop environments. And with good reason; the
performance gains realised through using a fast, light
WM - IceWm, Blackbox or Windowmaker for example - are
often quite dramatic, especially on underpowered machines.

<p>Most of these lightweight window managers lack the ability to
display desktop icons, and for some people this isn't a problem.
Others however, might find this a bit hard to get used to,
especially if they've come from another desktop environment or OS
that <i>does</i> use icons, and this is where IDesk comes in -
it's a tool for managing icons on the root window.

<p>There are a few ways to get icons onto your desktop; you could
run <i>Nautilus</i> or <i>kdesktop</i> for example. There are
disadvantages with these tools though; apart from their appetite
for system resources they can take over your desktop and hijack
mouse-clicks from your WM. In contrast with these, IDesk is 
light on memory usage and does nothing but manage your icons, so
your WM will behave exactly as it should. And unlike some other
light weight tools, IDesk is neither plain nor ugly, and supports
eye-candy effects such as transparency. Here's the feature list
as described on the IDesk website:

<ul>
  <li>Execution of multiple shell commands
  <li>Completely configurable actions
  <li>PNG image support
  <li>SVG image support with image scaling
  <li>Xft anti-aliased fonts
  <li>Pseudo-transparency
  <li>Shadowed fonts
  <li>Snap to grid icon placement
  <li>Only show caption on mouse-over
  <li>Automatic background updating with Esetroot
</ul>

<p> If you think this sounds good, perhaps you should check out some <a
href= "http://idesk.sourceforge.net/site/screens.html">screenshots</a> to
see just how good a fast, lightweight desktop can look.

<h3>Getting and Installing IDesk</h3>

<p>You can download the source from <a href=
"http://idesk.sourceforge.net/site/download.html">the IDesk
site</a>, plus there are binary packages available in RPM and deb
formats. Installation for either format is straightforward.

<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Before you can run IDesk, you need an .ideskrc file in your
home directory - you'll find a sample that you can copy and paste
in the /usr/share/doc/idesk/README file. This file can be edited
to customise IDesk's appearance and behaviour; the font and level
of transparency for example. Here's my .ideskrc as an
example:
<pre class="code">
table Config
  FontName: verdana
  FontSize: 12
  FontColor: #ffffff
  Locked: false
  Transparency: 0
  Shadow: true
  ShadowColor: #000000
  ShadowX: 1
  ShadowY: 2
  Bold: false
  ClickDelay: 200
  IconSnap: true
  SnapWidth: 55
  SnapHeight: 100
  SnapOrigin: BottomRight
  SnapShadow: true
  SnapShadowTrans: 200
  CaptionOnHover: false
end

table Actions
  Lock: control right doubleClk
  Reload: middle doubleClk
  Drag: left hold
  EndDrag: left singleClk
  Execute[0]: left doubleClk
  Execute[1]: right doubleClk
end
</pre>

<p>You'll also need a .idesktop folder in your home folder -
idesk uses a small text file (known as a linkfile) to represent
each icon, and these .lnk files live in this folder. Here's an
example:
  <br>
  <pre class="code">
table Icon
  Caption: Gnumeric
  Icon: /usr/share/idesk/icons/gnumeric.png
  X: 31
  Y: 442
  Command[0]: gnumeric
  Command[1]: gedit ~/.idesktop/gnumeric.lnk
end 
</pre>

<p>The Command[0] and Command[1] lines refer to the left-click
and right-click commands respectively. Don't worry about getting
the X and Y values right; you can simply drag the icons into
place and their positions will be remembered between
sessions.

<p>New users might also be interested in the <a href=
"http://users.netwit.net.au/~pursang/idesk-extras.html">idesk-extras</a>
package; it contains a set of png icons representing most common
apps and tasks, as well as sample .ideskrc and .lnk files.

<h3>Starting</h3>

<p>It's probably best that idesk is started for the first time
from a shell prompt, so that any error messages will be visible.
Once you're satisfied with the configuration, you can add the
<tt>idesk &amp;</tt> command to your window managers startup
script.

<h3>Quirks and Bugs</h3>

<p>Idesk is currently not being actively developed, and the
latest version available is 0.56. Despite being at a beta stage,
idesk has - for me at least - behaved perfectly, though others
have reported some bugs and there are a couple of minor quirks
to keep in mind. The first being that if you misconfigure one of
the .lnk files - say by using an invalid command or icon image
address - idesk will not start. In other words, even if only one
icon is misconfigured, none will be displayed. If this happens,
just try to restart idesk from a command line and the error
message will identify the fault.

<p>The other one is related to the way the icons are positioned;
they are "anchored" from the top left hand corner of the icon
image rather than the centre or the label. So long as all your
icons are the same size - 48x48 will probably suit most people -
they'll be uniformly spaced, but if there are variations in size
they can appear to be a little uneven.
