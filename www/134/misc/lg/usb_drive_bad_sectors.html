&gt; My problem is that I get file system corruption and "bad sectors" some

<p>
That depends, based on the error you're getting.  If they're actually
bad sectors that's typically indicative of a much more serious hardware
issue.  If, however, running fsck on it repeatedly doesn't help, then it
really is screwed.

&gt; filesystem with the thinking that a journal would just wear out the
&gt; drive in a certain spot.  Maybe that's not correct -- I am not sure if
&gt; the drive has a wear-leveling algorithm implemented or not.
</pre>

<p>
Of course not -- software cannot determine that.  Every piece of
hardware has a finite life-span.

<pre>
&gt; Questions:
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Is ext2 the right choice?  Or would reiserfs be better? Vfat??
</pre>

<p>
How long's a piece of string, and by-the-by what type of fish is that?
VFAT would be good for cross-platform.  Ext2 is good for read-only
mount points.  Ext3 is somewhat better thanks to the fact that it's ext2
with a journal bolted on to it.  Reiserfs' killer feature is its
developer (:P) and works well with lots of smaller, sporadic files.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; 2. Is their a quick way to detect bad sectors?  I tried running e2fsck
&gt; -c but it has been 45 minutes so far!
</pre>

<p>
man badblocks

It's screwed,  Backup whatever you can from it, and bin it.

<p>
Ok, I get the fact the filesystems have their pros and cons (:P), but my =
question was which filesystem is best for a general purpose Linux on a =
USB flash drive.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; man badblocks
</pre>

<p>
I realize e2fsck runs badblocks pogram, but I guess I am still unsure as =
to why that resets the USB bus during the process.

<p>
I don't think so, but I came up with a whole different solution to my
problem.  I am using 3 ext2 paritions and a ramdisk. The first partition
contains the OS and other static files.  I use the other 2 partitions to
periodically (1/hour) rsync the ram disk to the ext2 filesystem.  I
alternate between 2 paritions in case of a power failure.  I was hoping
that there would be some more automatic way of doing that.  Maybe I
should write my own filesystem, but then my wife would probably divorce
me and I might go insane.
