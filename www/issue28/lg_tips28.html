Not necessarily the best solution.
<P> 
It is perfectly safe to simply do a "Three-finger salute", allow a
normal shutdown, and then power down the machine anytime after you get
the message "unmounting filesystems" until you get the message during
reboot saying "mounting all filesystems". Probably the easiest time
would be at the LILO boot prompt (assuming you are using LILO).
<P> 
An alternative I used once on a system that did *not* have
&lt;ctrl-alt-del&gt; enabled was to provide a special login that *just* did a
shutdown. There is such a line in my /etc/passwd now that I didn't put
there, so I guess it's from RedHat two years ago.

How to generate a core dump in one easy lesson:

<li>run something that reads stdin, like: <tt>cat</tt>

You've just generated a core dump by sending SIGQUIT to cat.

Host name completion with BASH.
<P> 
Synopsis : This is how you can use host name completion, which is similar to
file name completion.
<P> 
Put your favorite telnet,ftp,rlogin hosts into $HOME/.hosts, in
/etc/hosts format.
<P> 
example :
<PRE> 
206.184.214.34   linux.kernel.org  
</PRE> 
then put into .bashrc :
<P> 
------ cut here ------
<PRE> 
export HOSTFILE="$HOME/.hosts"

# see HOSTFILE in bash man page 
UseHosts()
{
  for i in $* ; do
    eval `echo "$i() { local IFS=\"@\\$IFS\"; set -- \\$1; eval command $i \\\\\\${\\$#} ; }"`
  done
}

UseHosts telnet rlogin ftp
</PRE> 
------ cut here ------
<P> 
Now do a . .bashrc, to re-source the rc file.
You should have new 3 shell functions defined...telnet,rlogin,ftp
do a "set | less" to verify this
<P> 
now try this [notice the @]:<BR> 
<tt>ftp @lin&lt;tab-key&gt;</tt>   which completes to linux.kernel.org
<P> 
Well, this breaks doing just a "ftp", but this can be fixed by doing a
"command ftp", (maybe alias this??) which will give you the ftp> prompt. 
Rlogin will also break if you have to use the -l switch. This could be
incorporated into UseHosts(), I just haven't had time to do it.
<P> 
If you change the .hosts file, you have to logout and login again to use the
new hosts ... don't ask me why.x>

I notice a lot of discussion in Issue 27 of running shells on vt's without
logging in. I'm sure that there are some great solutions, but I would like
to add my 1/50 of a dollar to the heap. A while ago I had a need to keep a
telnet session open on a vt, so I hacked mingetty to do it. Then I
figured, "Hey, why stop there?" So I hacked a little more and came up with
rungetty, which can run any program on a vt. It also (in the newest
release) can run as any user, so a login is no problem, but you can also
tell it to, say, keep a top session running on another vt. It is available
from ftp://ftp.nodomainname.net/pub/rungetty/current (home site),
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/serial/getty, and should find it's
way into ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib soon. It is available in
tarball, source RPM, and binary RPM for alpha (glibc2) and i386 (libc5 and
glibc2) on nodomainname, and tarball on sunsite.

In LG 27, Kragen@pobox.com announced some utilities to do an automatic
login.
Besides the fact that this might be a security risk, I use his program
"own-tty" to have my dosemu running on a tty.
Add the following line (or something adequate) to "/etc/inittab":
<PRE> 
  6:23:respawn:/sbin/own-tty /dev/tty6 /usr/bin/dos dos
</PRE> 
From inside X, CTRL-ALT-F6 beams you into dosemu, from the console ALT-F6
does the same. Press CTRL-ALT-Fx from inside dosemu to go back to ttyx.
But be warned: Doing this causes a pretty high cpu-load because dosemu is
_always_ runnning.
To solve this problem, I inserted a "getchar();" into the source "own-tty.c"
right before the "execv()" is done. This makes "own-tty" wait for a key
beeing pressed before firing up dosemu.

What it is sounds like you want is an X *server*.
<P> 
You have several options.  There are a few commercial X servers out
there:  Hummingbird eXceed and LAN Workplace are two I know of. 
There's also a free X server (with much fewer features) called MI/X. 
You should be able to find these on the web.

You may also opt to use something like VNC, the virtual network
computer.  You can also find that on the web.

Running an ATAPI Zip Drive
</H3>
<P> 
Date: Sun, 19 Apr 1998 01:41:34 +0000<BR> 
From: Steve Beach, <A HREF="mailto:asb4@psu.edu">asb4@psu.edu</A> 
<P> 
I just bought an IDE ATAPI iomega Zip drive, and I couldn't find any
help at all on how to use it.  So, I slogged through, got a great hint
from Jeff Tranter (maintainer of the 'eject' utility), and managed to
get it working.  In the spirit of giving back to the community, here's
my (maybe even) five cent tip.
<P> 
Here's how to use an IDE ATAPI zip drive on Linux.
<P> 
First, the kernel:
Do _not_ use the "IDE FLOPPY" option (officially the name is 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEFLOPPY ).  This will work perfectly for reading and
writing,
but it will not work for ejecting.  What you need to do is say yes to
the 
option CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDESCSI.  When this is set, you will treat the IDE
ATAPI
drive just like a SCSI drive, except without the SCSI card and all that
other
garbage.  
<P> 
After making your kernel, you should get these messages in your startup 
messages (type dmesg at the prompt if they go by too fast to read):
<PRE> 
hda: WDC AC34000L, 3815MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=969/128/63
hdb: WDC AC34000L, 3815MB w/256kB Cache, CHS=969/128/63
hdc: TOSHIBA CD-ROM XM-6102B, ATAPI CDROM drive
hdd: IOMEGA ZIP 100 ATAPI, ATAPI FLOPPY drive - enabling SCSI emulation
ide2: ports already in use, skipping probe
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
scsi0 : SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices
scsi : 1 host.
  Vendor: IOMEGA    Model: ZIP 100           Rev: 24.D
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 00
Detected scsi removable disk sda at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0
scsi : detected 1 SCSI disk total.
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 196608 [96 MB] [0.1
GB]
sda: Write Protect is off
.
.
.
Partition check:
 sda: sda4
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3 hda4
 hdb: hdb1 hdb2 hdb3
</PRE> 
The key is that SCSI simulation will be used only if the native ATAPI
driver 
for that device isn't found.  So, since the ATAPI CD driver was compiled
into
the kernel, it used it.  Since the ATAPI removable disk driver wasn't, 
SCSI emulation was used.
<P> 
Second, the device:
If you want to have non-root users be able to mount, unmount, and eject
the
Zip disks, you've got to make a couple of changes to the default
configuration.
First thing to do is to change the permissions on the device.  As root, 
type the following:
<PRE> 
chmod a+rw /dev/sda4
</PRE> 
The next thing to do is set a shortcut (eject is easier).  Again, as
root,
type the following:
<PRE> 
ln -s /dev/sda4 /dev/zip
</PRE> 
Third, the mount point:
Create a mount point for your drive.  I like /mnt/zip, so I just do a 
mkdir /mnt/zip.  For ease, you now want to put this into your
/etc/fstab.
Put a line in that file that looks like 
<PRE> 
/dev/sda4                 /mnt/zip                  auto   user,noauto 0
0
</PRE> 
The first column is the device, followed by the mount point.  The first
'auto'
means that it will check to see the file system type when it is mounted.
(Hence, you can read not only ext2fs, but also FAT, VFAT, etc.)  The
'user'
keyword allows average users to mount the disk, and the 'noauto' means
that it will not be mounted at startup.  I don't know what the two
zero's mean,
but it works for me.  
<P> 
Now, at this point, any user should be able to mount the Zip disk by 
typing 
<PRE> 
mount /mnt/zip
</PRE> 
Unmounting would just be <tt>umount /mnt/zip</tt>.
<P> 
Fourth, formatting the disks:
The Zip disks you buy at your corner computer store are formatted for
MSDOS.
Personally, I prefer to have ext2fs formatted disks, so I don't have to
worry
about file name conflicts.  Hence, I have to reformat them.  There are
two other oddities.  First, the writable partition will be number 4. 
This
is a Macintosh-ism, which you might as well leave.  You can run fdisk
and
change the partition, but it will be much easier to just leave all your
disks the same, and that way you won't have to change the line in
/etc/fstab
for each disk.  Second, the initial permissions are not set to be
writeable
by the user.  
<P> 
To handle all this, I do the following, as root (new disk, initially 
unmounted):  (WARNING:  This will erase all data on the disk!)
<PRE> 
/sbin/mke2fs -m 0 /dev/sda4
mount /mnt/zip
chmod a+w /mnt/zip
umount /mnt/zip
</PRE> 
Now, whenever the user mounts that disk, she will be able to write to
it.
<P> 
Fifth, ejecting:
The entire reason for using SCSI emulation is to make it easy to eject
the 
disk.  It's easy now:
<PRE> 
eject zip
</PRE> 
You can also say 'eject /dev/sda4', but since you created the symbolic
link
'/dev/zip', eject knows what you mean when you just say 'zip'.  
<P> 
One thing about eject is that the average user does not have permission
to 
use it.  So, change the permission via setuid:
<PRE> 
chmod a+s /usr/bin/eject
</PRE> 
That should allow any user to eject any disk.
<P> 
Sixth, zip tools:
Jarrod A. Smith (jsmith@scripps.edu) has written a really nifty little
program
to make mounting, unmounting, ejecting, documenting, and write
protecting Zip
disks really easy.  The name is jaZip, and it is available as an RPM
package
(jaZip-0.22-3.i386.rpm) from the usual download sites, including
ftp://ftp.redhat.com.  Go ahead and download it -- it's only 24 K!
<P> 
I hope that covers everything -- if anybody has any questions, please
let me know!

In the last few months, I wrote these simple scripts to enhance my
Linux environment. I believe some other users might find them useful too,
so I send you a copy.
<P>
Here are the 4 scripts provided in tar files with a README.
<ul>
<li><A HREF="./MP3-PlayList-1.0.0.tar.gz">MP3-PlayLister</A>:
Program which searches for all the MP3s in the current directory,
recursively, and then plays them.

<li><A HREF="./mountcd-1.0.0.tar.gz">mountcd</A>:
Semi-intelligent CD-mounting program to shorten the command line for
mounting CDs.  Does simple checking to see if CD-ROM is already mounted or
unmounted.

<li><A HREF="./nookie.txt">nookie</A>:
A primer on notifying the user of incoming nukes, or how to react on
receiving them.

<li><A HREF="./sysmail-1.0.0.tar.gz">SysMail</A>:
A script to mail a message containing tokens to all system users.
</ul>
Thanx a mil! <BR> 
BTW Keep up the great work with the Gazette.  You rule :)
<P> 
Stefan

Re: Core Dumps Again

In issue #26, Marty was saying "I was annoyed on Linux that file(1)
couldn't tell what file dumped core if a core dump was seen.", and
mentioned size(1).  gdb(1) will also do the job...
<P> 
<tt>gdb -c core</tt> will show the program and calling arguments, as well as the
signal generated when it died, usually signal 11 (segmentation fault).
<tt>quit</tt> will exit the debugger.
