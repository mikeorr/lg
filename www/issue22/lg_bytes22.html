BLINUX Documentation and Development Project
</H3>
<P> 
<P>
The purpose of The BLINUX Documentation and Development Project is to serve as a catalyst
which will both spur and speed the development of software and documentation which will enable the
blind user to run his or her own Linux workstation.
<p>
Their web site is at: <br>
<a href="http://leb.net/blinux/">http://leb.net/blinux/</A>

<br>
It contains information about documenting Linux for the Blind and Visually

Linux "class" via the Internet</h3>
<p>
There is a Linux "class" being offered on the internet!  It's a
beginners class that's using Matt Welsh's "Running Linux" as the
textbook.  Lessons are posted to the site, with links to Linux related
urls and reading from the text as additional assignments. I just checked
out the first lesson (history of Linux), looks pretty good.
<p>
If anyone's interested (it's free), the url is:

</H3>
<P>
<P>
TCD is a new curses based CD player for Linux. Here are some of it's
distinct features:
<P>
* Nice-looking color (if supported) curses interface.
<br>
* Simple, sensible, one-keystroke control.
        (No more mapping little icons to your keypad!) :)
<br>* Repeat track, continuous play control.
<br>* Track name database. 
<br>* Uses little CPU time while running.
<P>
It should still be at

ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/Incoming/tcd-1.0.tar.gz</a>

urlmon -- The URL Monitor
</H3>
<P> 
<P>

urlmon  reports changes to web sites
(and ftp sites, too).
<P>
urlmon makes a connection to a web site and records the
last_modified time for that url.  Upon subsequent calls, it will
check the url again, this time comparing the information to the
previously recorded times.  Since the last_modified data is not
required to be given by HTTP (it's optional) and is
non-existent for ftp, urlmon will then take an MD5 checksum. 
<P>
It's real utilitity is evident when running it periodically (from cron,
for example) in batch mode, so as to keep tabs on many different web
pages, reporting on those that have recently changed.  
<P>
New with 2.1, it can monitor muliple URLs in parallel.  It also has
user settable proxy server ability, and user settable timeout lengths.
A few algorithm improvements have been made.
<P>
It can be found at
