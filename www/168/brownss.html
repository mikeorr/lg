<h1>A Short CGI Script for Passing 404s to Another Server</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

<p>
There are several reasons why you might have more than
one website.  For example, you might have an account on a
fast server with limited quota, and another on a server
that is slower but has more space, and you keep certain
rarely-used files on the slower server.  Or you might
have an easy-to-remember dyndns alias pointing to your
home server, but some pages on another server that has a
better connection but a longer address.  If this is the
case, then it might be useful to set one of the servers
to forward any requests for pages it can't find to the
other server.  Then you can use this first server in all
the addresses you type, and if the page requested is on
it, it will be returned, otherwise the browser will be
automatically redirected to check the second server for
the same page.  (Don't set that second server to redirect
back to the first or you'll have an infinite loop.)
</p>

<p>
Using Apache, this can be accomplished as follows.
Firstly, put the following line into your
<tt>public_html/.htaccess</tt> file, replacing
<tt>/~your-user-ID</tt> as appropriate (if you have your
own hostname then you can omit it):
</p>

<pre>
ErrorDocument 404 /~your-user-ID/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi
</pre>

<p>
This tells Apache to run the script whenever it would
normally issue a 404.  If you want the redirection to take effect for
index.html also (that is if index.html is missing), then you should also add:
</p>

<pre>
Options -Indexes
ErrorDocument 403 /~your-user-ID/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi
</pre>

<p>
This prevents directory listing, and tells Apache to
send the browser to the redirection script instead of
showing the "Forbidden" message.  This arrangement might be useful if your main
site is on the other server but this server contains a
few extra files that you want Apache to check for first.
</p>

<p>
Then create <tt>public_html/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi</tt>
as follows, replacing <tt>other-site-address-goes-here</tt>
and <tt>~your-user-ID</tt> as appropriate:
</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
echo Status: 301 Moved
echo Location: "$(echo "$REQUEST_URI"|sed -e s,/,http://other-site-address-goes-here/, -e s,~your-user-ID/,,)"
echo
</pre>

<p>
Then <tt>chmod +x public_html/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi</tt> and test.
</p>

<p>
The above script should work regardless of whether or
not <tt>~your-user-ID</tt> is included in the request,
that is, if Apache is serving your <tt>public_html</tt>
on your own hostname then this script should work
regardless of whether the incoming request is for your
hostname or for your user ID on the main hostname.
</p>

<p>
Some antiquated browsers might not follow the 301
redirect.  If this is a concern then you can add some
text in the response as well.  But the script as it
stands is small and easily set up, and should work
without trouble in most cases.
