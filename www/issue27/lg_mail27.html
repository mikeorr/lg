I finally convinced my girlfriend to make the switch to Linux from windows
after she suffered numerous stability problems (big surprise) She
currently has an HP Omni-book 600CT, I fdisked her windows partition, and
when I ran the install boot disk (for both Red Hat and Slackware) it says
floppy 1.44m (I assume this is from the kernel) Then it says no floppy
controller found, and just keeps reading the boot disk. Is there anyway
that I can force the detection of the floppy? (external floppy drive)
I found a WWW page about installing Linux on that notebook, but What it
said to do didn't work. Does anyone have any suggestions?

we need to 'login' to the server, and then get access to 'shares'. I
tried using NFS as an alternative (with NFS maestro) but it doesn't
recognize Linux NFS. However...... I cannot get Samba to work AT ALL. In
fact, I have never seen it work. If you've got it working, please help
me - I can copy your installation configuration and tweak it, but I need
some success. I have plenty of NT, Novel, DOS/win hardware etc.
experience, and successfully use NFS exports between Linux machines, but
have got nowhere with Samba in a year of trying. Is it a hoax?

I'm sitting here listening to C|Net radios
coverage of Internet World.  Dan Shafer of Builder.com talked at length
about how he (and someone named Desmond) are going to do some
serious investigation into what alternative OS's there are - and
specifically they are looking into Linux.  They mentioned Red Hat and
Caldera, that there were lots of applications available and how the Linux
community are very much the "just do it" community.  All in all, very
positive exposure.
<P>
Go to http://www.news.com/Radio/Features/0,155,154,0.html and click on the 
4:00 CNET Radio Late Update (where it says "Dan Shafer of Builder.com:
What's Hot?").  Its a RealAudio interview and you'll have to go about 1/2
way through before they start the Linux discussion.
<P>
Dan Shafer said they would be writing up the Linux results they came up
with in the BuilderBuzz section of Builder.com (http://builder.com).  I
just checked and there is nothing there yet - I think he said it was going
to start next week.  Anyway, I sent him email offering to assist in anyway
I could.  If I get a response I'll try to get more details on where the
info will be located when it becomes available.

I was so pleased to read that *someone* else out there is as aggravated
as I am by the continual misuse of the apostrophe in web pages and
e-mails by obvious native-born American English speakers.  And for
anyone who says, "What's the big deal? Doesn't everyone know what I
mean?", let this old fogey respond:
<p>
Does your computer understand what you mean when you make an error
writing code? Doesn't it matter then? If you can't write proper English
grammar and spell correctly, what makes you so sure that your computer
code is correct? And if you want to spread the good news about Linux, it
seems obvious that we will get more attention, and the right kind, if we
take the time to write properly. I'm often impressed by how hard the
"foreign" letter writers work to make their point clear when they write
to LG, often apologizing for their poor English; yet they often do
better than us "natives."
<p>
Mike, you are absolutely right, and I thank you for saying it. I would
also like to eliminate the so-called word "alot" as *there is no such
word* (but note that the next letter after Mike's used it.  Oh, well...)

I'm glad you have a 17inch monitor and "highquality" video card.
Myself, my 50-dollar video card and ten-year-old monitor let me run in
800x600 with 256 colors. I could get 1024x768 if the monitor allowed it.
I could get 64K colors (16-bit) if XFree86 allowed it. This is a
limitation not of the hardware, not exactly of Linux, but of the XFree86
people who don't wish to take the trouble to support the inexpensive
cards on the market.
<P> 
   My present (Oak) card seems to be limited to 8-bit color in any
event, my other (Cirrus Logic) card will support 16-bit and 24-bit
color, which if fully supported would allow me 64K colors at 800x600 or
16M colors at 640x480 (with a virtual 800x600 window).
<P> 
    The people at XFree86 (one of them a Cirrus employee) have, by their
own statement, chosen to spend their time on the latest and greatest
cards, with the older, cheaper cards going by the board.

    I have tried and failed to get the necessary information from Cirrus
Logic to rewrite the XFree driver to better use the card.
<blockquote> <I> 
Now mind you, I don't cringe on sharing the best O/S on the planet, In
fact I want everyone to use Linux.
It's just that almost all X windows software is written for 1024 X 768
or higher resolution video screens and that 99% of those wanting to
use Linux and X windows only have a 14" monitor that can barely get
past 640X480 at 256 colors.
</I> </blockquote> 
See above. For a cost of no more than $50 they should be able to get a
1MB video card that will handle *much* better resolution.
<blockquote> <I> 
I tried several times to get friends into Linux and X but to no avail
because the software developed for X is for those that have Gobs of
money for good video boards and humoungous monitors.
It's not a limitation of Linux or X, it that the software that is
developed for these platforms are by professionals or professional
users that can afford that new 21 inch monitor at the computer store.
</I> </blockquote> 
You might try pushing different programs. My main problem (except with
viewers for Adobe file formats) is getting *multiple* windows on the
screen at once. Also, certain *types* of applications, by their very
nature, demand lots of screen real estate. An application of that sort
is going to be cramped on a small screen *regardless* of underlying OS
support. I simply avoid such applications until I can acquire a larger
screen (about $500, locally).
<blockquote> <I> 
We as a group might want to see software scaled back to the 640X480
crowd.. then Linux would take the world by storm.. Until then It's
going to be limited to us pioneers and Scientists...
</I> </blockquote> 
Actually, the *biggest* barrier to using Linux X Apps is that so many of
them are written using Motif! That's almost as bad as WinDoze.
