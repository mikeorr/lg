<BR><I>Dino</I> is a high-level, dynamic scripting language that
has been designed for simplicity, uniformity, and expressiveness. 
Dino is similar to such well known scripting languages as <I>Perl</I>,
<I>TCL</I>, and <I>Python</I>. 
As most programmers know the C language, Dino resembles C where possible.

<p>Dino is an extensible, object oriented language that has garbage collection.  
It supports parallelism description, exception handling, and dynamic loading 
of libraries written on other languages.  
Although Dino is a multiplatform language, its main platform is Linux.

<P>This document is a concise introduction to the new Dino scripting language, 
but is not a programmer's manual. 

<H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%"></H2>

<H2>
1. Some History</H2>

Originally, Dino was designed and implemented by the Russian graphics
company <A HREF="http://www.animatek.com">ANIMATEK</A> to describe the
movement of dinosaurs in an animation project. (This is origin of
the language's name.) At that time it worked in only 64Kb memory. It has
been considerably redesigned and reimplemented with the aid of the <A
HREF="http://www.linuxstart.com/~vladimir_makarov/download.html">COCOM
toolset</A>.

<H2>2. Let's Begin</H2> 

The best way to get the feel of a programming language is to see a program 
written in it. Because I have worked in the compiler field for the last 18 years, 
I'll write a small assembler in Dino. 

<P>
Most of us do not
remember how programmers wrote programs for old computers that had
only a few kilobytes of memory. Long ago I read about an Algol 60 compiler 
that worked on a  computer that had only 420 20-bits words.  
In an old book "Compiler Construction for Digital
Computers", Gries describes an Algol compiler working on 1024 42-bits
words. How did they achieve this?  One of the ways is to use an interpreter
for a specialized language; a program in a specialized language is
usually smaller.  Let's implement an assembler for syntactic parsers.  
The assembler output will be a syntactic parser
interpreter in C.  The assembler instructions have the following format:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>[label:] [code [operand]]</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here, the constructions in brackets are optional. 
For convenience we will allow comments that start with <B>;</B> and
finish at the end of the line.
<P> 
The assembler will have the following instructions:

<H3>2.1. Overall structure of the assembler.</H3>

As a rule, assemblers work in two passes. Therefore, we need to have some
internal representation (IR) to store the program between the passes. 
We will create the following Dino files:
<UL>
<LI>
The code that describes the IR and the auxiliary functions will be in the file <A
HREF="misc/makarov/ir.d">ir.d</A>.
</LI><LI>  
The code for reading the
assembler program and for generating the IR will be in the file <A
HREF="misc/makarov/input.d">input.d</A>.  
</LI><LI>
The code for checking the IR will be in the file
<A HREF="misc/makarov/check.d">check.d</A>.
</LI><LI>The code for generating the interpreter
in C will be in the file <A HREF="misc/makarov/gen.d">gen.d</A>
</LI><LI>
The top level code will be in the file <A HREF="misc/makarov/sas.d">sas.d</A>.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>These files are described in detail below.</P>

<H3>2.2. File <A HREF="misc/makarov/ir.d">ir.d</A></H3>

This file contains the description of the IR in Dino and also some auxiliary
functions.  Dino has dynamic variables. In other words, a Dino
variable may contain a value of any Dino type. The major Dino types are:
<UL>
<LI>
<i>characters</i>
</LI><LI>
<i>integers</i> (32-bit)
</LI><LI>
<i>floating point
numbers</i> (IEEE double floating point numbers)
</LI><LI>
<i>heterogeneous vectors</i> (that is, vectors that may contain elements of different
types. A typical example of vector is a string, a vector whose
values can only be characters)
</LI><LI>
<i>associative tables</i>
</LI><LI>
<i>objects</i>
</LI></UL>
The values of the last three types are <i>shared</i>.
That means that if a variable value is assigned to another variable, any
changes to the shared value through the first variable are
reflected in the value of the second variable.  In general, working 
with shared values is analogous to working with pointers in C, but with fewer risks.

<P>Line 1 describes an abstract node of an IR. A node of such class has the 
variable <TT>lno</TT> (which is the source line of the corresponding assembler
instruction).  The variable is also a class parameter.  That means
that you should define its value when creating a class instance or
object (see line 7).  Inside class <TT>irn</TT>, classes describing
each assembler instruction are defined.  Each Dino object (and not
only objects) stores information about its <i>context</i>.  So if you
create an object of class <TT>next</TT> (see line 40 in file <A
HREF="misc/makarov/input.d">input.d</A>) by calling a class that is accessed through an
object of class <TT>irn</TT>, and then you take value of the variable
<tt>lno</tt> through the object of the class <tt>next</tt>, you actually
take the value of the variable of the object of the class <TT>irn</TT>. This is a 
more simple and more general mechanism of implementing a single
inheritance.

<P>An object of the class <TT>ir</TT> (lines 9-13) contains information about
the entire program:
<UL>
<li><TT>ns</TT>, which is initialized by an empty vector, will
contain a vector of IR nodes that correspond to all instructions in the source
program.</li>
<li><TT>l2i</TT>, which is initialized by an empty associative table,
will contain a table for transforming label names into an index of the 
node in <TT>ns</TT>.  This node will represent assembler instruction marked
by the label.</li>
<li><TT>i2l</TT>, which is initialized by an empty associative
table, will contain a table for transforming the index of the node in <tt>ns</tt>
into a vector of label names. A node with such an index in <tt>ns</tt> will
represent assembler instruction marked by the labels in the vector.</li>
<li><TT>ss</TT>, which is initialized by an empty associative table, will
 contain a table of all symbols in the assembler instructions
 <TT>match</TT> and <TT>skipif</TT>.</li>
<li><TT>mind</TT> and <TT>maxd</TT> will contain the minimum and maximum
displacements of labels in the source program.</li>
</UL>

Lines 15-23 contain a function to output errors.  The function accepts a 
variable number of parameters whose values will be elements of
the vector in the implicitly defined variable <TT>args</TT>.  Any function or
class can be called with any number of actual parameters.  If the
number of formal parameters is more than the number of actual
parameters, the rest of formal parameters will have the default value
<TT>nil</TT>.  If the number of actual parameters is more than the
number of formal parameters, the rest of the actual parameters will be
ignored unless the last formal parameter is "<TT>...</TT>".
<P>
The other elements are:
<UL>
<LI>The <tt>err</tt> function, which outputs all parameters into the standard error stream.
</LI><LI>
The <TT>fput</TT> function, which outputs strings, characters, integers, or floating
point numbers
</LI><LI>
The <TT>fputln</TT> function, which is the same as <TT>fput</TT>, but 
additionally outputs a new line)
</LI><LI>
The <TT>exit</TT> function, which finishes the Dino program with given
code.
</LI><LI>
The variables <TT>argv</TT>, which are all command line arguments of the Dino
program. So <TT>argv[0]</TT> will be an assembler program file name.
</LI><LI>
<TT>stderr</TT> (standard error stream), which is predefined in Dino.  
</LI>
</UL>
<P>There are many other predefined functions, classes, and variables in Dino.  On
line 18 you can see the operator <TT>#</TT>, which returns the number of
elements in a vector or an associative table.

<P>Lines 25-30 contain a function that transforms a table into a vector.
The table's keys are a sequence of integers that start with 0.
The result is a vector whose elements are the table
elements placed in the vector according their keys.  
First we create a vector of the table size and initialize it with empty strings (line 26). 
Then we fill each element of the vector, iterating by the keys of the table
(lines 27-28).


<H3>2.3. File <A HREF="misc/makarov/input.d">input.d</A></H3>

This file contains the function <TT>get_ir</TT>, which reads the file given as
its parameter, performs some checks on the file, and generates the IR of the
source program.

<P>The first line contains an <i>include-clause</i> that specifies a source file 
without the suffix <B>.d</B> (all Dino source files should have this
suffix). The file is given as a string in the clause; this means that
the entire file is inserted in place of the clause.  As result, we could
check the file by calling the Dino interpreter with <TT>input.d</TT> on
a command line.  There are several rules that define which directories 
are searched for the included file.  One such directory is the
directory of the file that contains the include-clause. Thus, we can place all
the assembler files in that one directory and forget about the other rules.  

<P>The
file is inserted only once in a given <i>block</i> (this is the construction that 
starts with <TT>{</TT> and finishes with <TT>}</TT>).  This is
important for our program because each file will contain an inclusion of
the file <TT>ir.d</TT>, and eventually all the files will be included into the 
main program file.  Unconditional inclusion in this case would result
in many error messages about repeated definitions.  By the way, there is
also special form of the include-clause that permits unconditional file
inclusion.

<P>On lines 6-13 we define some variables. We use regular expressions 
to assign them strings that describe the correct assembler lines. 
The regular expressions are extended regular expressions that are described in POSIX
10003.2.  To concatenate the strings (vectors), we use the operator <TT>@</TT>.

<P>Lines 16 to 52, 53 form a <i>try-block</i> that is used to process
<i>exceptional</i> situations in the Dino program. The Dino interpreter can
generate a lot of predefined exceptions. A Dino programmer can also 
describe and generate other exceptions.  The exceptions are objects of the 
predefined class <TT>except</TT>, or they are objects of a class defined inside
the class <TT>except</TT>. Dino has special constructions (extension
blocks) to add something into a class, and functions when the class or the
function is already defined.  In our example, the exception we catch is "reaching the
end of a file", which is generated by the predefined function <TT>fgetln</TT>
(reading a new line from a file).  If we do not catch the exception, the
program finishes with a diagnostic about reaching the end of the file. In the clause
<tt>catch</tt>, we write a class of exceptions that we want to catch.
The value of the predefined variable <TT>invcalls</TT> is the class
<TT>invcall</TT>, in which class <TT>eof</TT> is defined.  In turn, the 
class <TT>invcall</TT> is defined inside the class <TT>except</TT>.  If
the exception is of a class given in the <i>catch-clause</i> or of a class
defined somewhere inside a class given in the catch-clause, a block
corresponding to the catch-clause is executed. The variable <TT>e</TT> is
implicitly defined in the block that contains the exception.  The exception
is propagated further, unless the catch-clause corresponding to the
exception is found.

<P>The predefined function <TT>fgetln</TT> returns the next line from the
file.  After this, the line is matched with the pattern on line 20.
The predefined function <TT>match</TT> returns the value <TT>nil</TT> if the
input line does not correspond to the pattern, otherwise it returns a 
vector of integer pairs.  The first pair is the first and the last
character indexes in the line.  The first pair defines the substring that
corresponds to the whole pattern.  The following pairs of indexes
correspond to constructions in parentheses in the pattern.  They
define substrings that are matched to the constructions in the
parentheses.  If a construction is not matched (for example, because an
alternative is rejected), the indexes have the value -1.

<P>The statement on line 23 extracts a label. The predefined function <TT>subv</TT>
is used to extract the sub-vectors (sub-strings).

<P>On lines 24 and 25, we use an empty vector to initialize a table element 
that corresponds to the current assembler instruction.  On lines 26-31, we
process a label, if it is defined on the line.  On lines 27-28, we check
that the label is not defined repeatedly.  On line 29, we define how to 
map the label name into number of the assembler instruction to
which the label is bound.  We make that mapping with the aid of associative
table <TT>pr.l2i</TT>.  On line 30, we add the label name to the
vector that is the element of associative table <TT>pr.i2l</TT> that has a key
equal to the number of the assembler instruction.  Predefined function
<TT>ins</TT> (insertion of element into vector) is used with index -1, which 
means addition of the element at the vector end.  Dino has
extensible vectors.  There are also predefined functions to delete
elements in vectors (and associative tables).

On lines 36-49 we check the current assembler instruction and create

<H3>2.5. File <A HREF="misc/makarov/gen.d">gen.d</A></H3>

The biggest assembler source file is the interpreter generator.  We
generates two files: a <B><TT>.h</TT></B> file (the interface of the interpreter)
and a <B><TT>.c</TT></B> file (the interpreter itself).  We create the files
on line 4.  The parameter <TT>bname</TT> of the function <TT>gen</TT> is a 
base name of the generated files.  The interface file contains
definitions of codes of tokens in <TT>match</TT> and <TT>skipif</TT>
instructions as C macros (lines 6-9) and definition of function
<TT>yyparse</TT> (line 35).  Function <TT>yyparse</TT> is a main
interpreter function.  It returns 0 if the source program is correct,
and nonzero otherwise.

<P>The generated interpreter requires the external functions <TT>yylex</TT>
and <TT>yyerror</TT> (line 34). The function <TT>yylex</TT> is used by
the interpreter to read and to get the code of the current token.
Function <TT>yyerror</TT> should output error diagnostics. (The
interface is a simplified version of the Yacc Unix Utility interface.)

<P>The compiled assembler program is presented by a C array of chars or
short integers with the name <tt>program</tt>.  Each element of the array
is an encoded instruction of the source program.  On lines 11-15, we
evaluate the start code for each kind of assembler instruction and define the 
type of array elements.  On lines 16-33, we output the array
<tt>program</tt>. On lines 37-61, we output the function <TT>yyparse</TT>.
Finally, on lines 62-63 we close the two output files with the aid of the
predefined function <TT>close</TT>.

<H3>2.6. File <A HREF="misc/makarov/sas.d">sas.d</A></H3>

This is the main assembler file.  Lines 1-4 are include-clauses for the
inclusion of the previous files.  Line 6-7 checks that the argument is
given on the command line.  On line 9 we open the file given on the
command line, and call the function for reading and generating the IR of
the program.  If the file does not exist or cannot be opened for
reading, an exception is generated.  The exception results in the output
of standard diagnostics and finishes the program. We could catch the
exception and do something else, but the standard diagnostics will be
sufficient here.  On line 10, we check the IR.  And finally on line 11,
we generate the interpreter of the program.  To get the base name of
the assembler file, we use the predefined function <TT>sub</TT>, deleting
all directories and suffixes from the file name and returning the
result.

<H3>2.7. Results</H3>

So we've written the assembler (this is 200 lines in Dino).  As a 
test, we will use <A
HREF="http://www.edm2.com/0608/oberon2.html">Oberon-2</A> language
grammar.  You can look at Oberon-2 parser in the file <A
HREF="misc/makarov/oberon2.sas">oberon2.sas</A>. After

<UL>
<UL><TT>dino sas.d oberon2.sas</TT></UL>
</UL>

we will get two files <A HREF="misc/makarov/oberon2.h">oberon2.h</A> and <A
HREF="misc/makarov/oberon2.c">oberon2.c</A>.  Let's look at the size of generated
IAX-32 code:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>    gcc -c -Os oberon2.c; size oberon2.o

    text        data    bss     dec     hex     filename
    382         934     0       1316    524     oberon2.o</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

For comparison, we would have about 15Kb for a YACC generated parser.
Not bad.  But we could make the parser even less than 1Kb by using 
short and long <TT>goto</TT> and <TT>gosub</TT> instructions.
Actually, what we generate is not a parser, it is only a recognizer.
But the assembler language could be easily extended to write parsers.
Just add the instructions:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><TT>   call C-function-name</TT></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

to call semantic functions for the generation of parsed code.  In
any case, most of a compiler's code would be in C.  To further decrease the
compiler size (not only its parser), an interpreter of C that is
specialized to the compiler could be written.

<P>Of course, it is not easy work to write a parser on the assembler. 
So we could generate assembler code from a high-level syntax description,
for example, from a Backus-Naur form.  Another area for improvement is the implementation
of error recovery, but this was not our purpose.  Our goal
was just to demonstrate the Dino language.

<H2>3. Some last comments</H2>

What Dino's features were missed in this introduction?  Many details, of
course, but we also have not described the following major parts of Dino
language:

<UL>
<LI>Extensions</LI>

<LI>Threads</LI>

<LI>Public and private variables</LI>

<LI>Mutable and immutable values</LI>

<LI>Functions, classes, threads, and types as values</LI>

<LI>Interface with C language and writing external dynamic libraries</LI>
</UL>

The Dino interpreter is distributed under GNU Public license.  You can
