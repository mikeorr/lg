<h2>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Introduction:</font></font></b></h2>
This article assumes the reader has a thorough understanding of the basics
of the Expect scripting language and is looking for advanced solutions.
For more on Expect, see:
<dir><a href="http://www.cotse.com/dlf/man/expect/index.html">http://www.cotse.com/dlf/man/expect/index.html</a> (*)</dir>
In the design of automated systems using the Expect programming language,
one of the more difficult hurdles many programmers encounter is ensuring
communication with ill-behaved connections and remote terminals. The <a href="misc/fisher/send_expect.txt">send_expect</a>
procedure detailed in this article provides a means of ensuring communication
with remote systems and handles editing and rebroadcast of the command
line. Where a programmer would usually send a command line and then expect
the echo from the remote system, this procedure replaces those lines of
code and provides the most reliable interface I have come across. Features
of this interface include:
<ul>
<li>
Guarantees transmission via remote system echo</li>

<li>
Tolerates remote terminal control codes and garbage characters in the echo</li>

<li>
Persistence of attempts and hierarchy of methods before declaring a failure</li>

<li>
Interactively edits and retransmits command lines that cannot be verified</li>

<li>
Maintains its own moving-window diagnostics files, so they are small and
directly associated with the errors</li>
</ul>
Communication with local processes (i.e. those running on the same workstation
as the expect process) is typically not problematic and does not require
the solutions detailed in this article. External processes, however, can
create a number of problems that may or may not affect communication, but
will affect an automated system's ability to determine the success of the
communication. In cases where it is corrupted, it is not always immediately
obvious: a corrupted command may trigger an error message, but data which
has been corrupted may still be considered valid and the error would not
show up immediately, and may cause a variety of problems. This is why it
is necessary to ensure that the entire string that is transmitted is properly
received echoed by the remote system.
<p>
The basic idea of this interface is to send the command string except
for its terminating character (usually, a carriage return) and look at
the echo from the remote system. If the two can be matched using the regular
expressions in the expect clauses, then the terminating character is sent
and transmission is considered successful. If success cannot be determined,
the command line is cleared instead of being sent, and alternative transmission
modes are used.
<p>
In many cases, nothing more than expecting the exact echo of the string
is sufficient. If you're reading this article, though, I suspect that you've
encountered some of the problems I have when programming in Expect, and
you're looking for the solution here. If you're just reading out of interest,
the problems arise when automating a session on a machine off in a lab,
or on the other side of the world. Strange characters pop up over the connection,
and the terminal you're connected to does weird things with its echo, but
everything is working. It becomes very difficult to determine if what was
sent was properly received when you have noise on the connection, terminal
control codes inserted in the echo, and even server timeouts between the
automation program and the remote session. This interface survives all
of that, and if it can't successfully transmit the string, it means that
the connection to the remote system has been lost.
<p>
The code provided in this article is executable, but needs to be incorporated
into any system in which it is to be used. Ordinarily, system-dependent
commands need to be added based on the needs of the target system. Also,
this code uses simple calls to the 
<a href="http://www.cotse.com/dlf/man/TclCmd/puts.htm">puts</a> (*)
command to output status messages - these should be changed to use whatever
logging mechanism is used by the rest of the system. A final caveat, and
I can't emphasize this enough: always wear eye protection.
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Setting Up The Interface:</font></font></b></h2>
The procedures provided in this article are:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="misc/fisher/send_expect_init.txt">send_expect_init</a></li>
<li>
<a href="misc/fisher/send_only.txt">send_only</a></li>
<li>
<a href="misc/fisher/send_expect.txt">send_expect</a></li>
<li>
<a href="misc/fisher/send_expect_report.txt">send_expect_report</a></li>
</ul>
The interface is initialized with the send_expect_init procedure, which
sets up all the globals required by the other procedures. See the section
on controlling the behavior of the interface for an explanation of the
parameters. The send_expect_init procedure is run once, at the beginning
of execution (before the interface is to be used). It may be run a second
time to restore settings, if necessary.
<p>
The send_only procedure is a wrapper for the 
<a href="http://www.cotse.com/dlf/man/expect/exp_send.htm">exp_send</a> (*)
command, and is used by send_expect to transmit strings. The only time
this procedure is called directly is for strings that are not echoed, such
as passwords, and multi-byte character constants, such as the telnet break
character (control-]).
<p>
The send_expect procedure is the actual interface between the automated
system and its remote processes, and is detailed in the next section.
<p>Finally, the send_expect_report procedure is used at the end of execution
to output the statistics of the interface for debugging. This procedure
may also be run during execution, if incremental reports are needed.
<h2>
<b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Using The send_expect Procedure</font></font></b></h2>
Once the interface has been initialized using send_expect_init, and a process
has been spawned, it is ready to be used with the syntax:
<blockquote>send_expect id command;</blockquote>
where
<blockquote>id = the spawn id of the session on which to send the command
<br>command = the entire command string including the terminating carriage-return,
if any.</blockquote>
This syntax, and the implementation of the expression-action lists, support
multiple-session applications.
<p>
Many people who follow the documented examples tend to write the same
kind of error-prone code, because they follow the example as if it's the
best example, instead of just a simple example. Examples are kept uncluttered
by the little details that make the difference between bulletproof code
and code that will eventually fail. The examples provided in this article
are simple examples but with more attention to detail, and where warranted
a complete implementation is provided as an example. The send_expect procedure
usually replaces only two lines of code in an existing system.
<p>
The full syntax for properly using the interface is actually:
<blockquote>if { [send_expect $id $command] != 0} {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ## handle your error here
<br>}</blockquote>

<p><br>
<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial">How It Works:</font></b>
<p>The interface uses four different transmission modes, in order:
<ul>
<li>
send the entire string and hope for the best (fastest, but least reliable)</li>

<li>
send the entire string using the <a href="http://www.cotse.com/dlf/man/expect/send_slow.htm">send_slow</a> (*)
list</li>

<li>
send the string in blocks of eight characters</li>

<li>
send the string one character at a time (slowest, but most reliable)</li>
</ul>
If a mode fails, the command line is cleared by sending the standard control-U,
the expect buffer is cleared, and the next mode is tried. Each mode except
the last one can also have a failure tolerance set, using:
<dir>sendGlobals(ModeXFailMax), where X is either 1,2 or 3.</dir>
If this max value is set to a positive number, once the failures for that
mode exceeds this value, it is no longer used. If it is set to 0, then
each mode is tried for each transmission, regardless of the number of failures.
Each of the modes uses the send_only procedure as a wrapper for exp_send.
If this procedure returns an error, it most likely means that the connection
was lost, and the spawn id is checked to see if the session is still active.
The error is returned to send_expect, which in turn returns an error to
the calling procedure.
<p>
For local processes and robust remote connections, mode 1 is usually
sufficient. If the remote system is a bit slow, mode 2 may be required.
Mode 3 has proven invaluable when connected to routers and clusters which
provide rudimentary terminal control. Mode 4 is rarely required, but acts
as a backup to mode 3.
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Moving Window Diagnostics</font></font></b></h2>
Expect provides a means of controlling the output of its internal diagnostics
and expression-matching attempts using the command "<a href="http://www.cotse.com/dlf/man/expect/exp_internal.htm">exp_internal</a>" (*).
The send_expect interface makes use of this command to create a diagnostics
output file for each transmission attempt - for each attempt, a new diagnostics
log file is created using exp_internal -f. If transmission is successful,
the file is deleted. If it fails, the file is renamed using the syntax
<blockquote>send.n.i.command.diags</blockquote>
where
<dir>n = the number of the failure
<br>i = the spawn id of the channel that had the failure
<br>command = the first word of the command string that failed to get sent
properly.</dir>
If you've ever read a 30 Megabyte log file with all of the diagnostics
from the beginning to the end of execution, you'll understand why this
is necessary. The diagnostics files created using this method are usually
less that 2 Kilobytes, and since they are directly associated with failures
(because the window file is deleted for successful transmissions), debugging
is far more efficient.
<p>
The moving window diagnostics file is the fastest and smallest way to
implement full diagnostics output during the execution of a send command.
If the transmission succeeds, this file is deleted. If there is a failure,
this file is closed and renamed, and on the next invocation of the send
command a new file is created. This results in very small files (comparatively)
with all of the diagnostics from expect and the user-defined messages,
from the very beginning of the attempt to send the command.
<p>
Ideally, if there are no failures during execution, there should be
no more than one send diagnostics file in existence at any time, named
send.diagnostics. If there are diagnostics files, each is associated with
a particular failure and should be used in debugging that failure.
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>
Controlling The Behavior Of The Interface:</font></font></b></h2>
The sendGlobals array contains all of the parameters used by the interface,
and may be modified at runtime to control how the interface works. This
section will cover the meanings of these parameters and how they may be
modified.  See 
<a href="misc/fisher/send_expect_init.txt">send_expect_init</a> 
for the initial values of these parameter.
<p>
The failure limit elements (Mode1FailMax, Mode2FailMax, and Mode3FailMax)
determine how many failures are permitted for modes 1, 2 and 3 (respectively).
A value of zero disables this limitation, and any positive integer sets
the maximum number of failures for that mode before it is no longer used
by the interface. There is no failure limit for the last mode.
<p>
The element useMode allows the system to determine which transmission
mode should be used first, so that the less reliable modes (the first and
second) can be bypassed. Allowable values for this parameter are 1, 2,
3, or 4. Invalid values will be replaced by the default mode (1).
<p>
If transmission errors are not considered fatal, the sendErrorSeverity
element may be specified to a more tolerant value. Note that this parameter
is not used internally, so if the automated system does not access this
value, it won't affect the interface.
<p>
The kill element defines the command line kill character, which is defaulted
to the Gnu-standard control-U.
<p>
The diagFile parameter names the temporary internal diagnostics file
(generated from exp_internal).
<p>
The logDiags allows disabling of all diagnostics output for faster execution,
but be forewarned that disabling this feature well make debugging much
more difficult.
<p>
The sleepTime parameter, when set to a positive integer, causes the
interface to sleep for the designated amount of time before starting transmission.
This is useful if the automated system appears to be going faster than
the remote system can handle - the consistent loss of characters in the
transmission phase usually indicates a speed and synchronization problem,
and this parameter is provided as an allowance for such cases.
<p>
The interval and delay elements represent the two items in the send_slow
list, which is used by the second and third modes.
<p>
For experimentation purposes, it is recommended that these parameters
be modified by the automated system at runtime, rather than directly editing
the defaults in the initialization procedure. Once valid settings are found
the defaults may be changed to reflect them.
<h2>

<hr WIDTH="100%"><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+0>Failures:</font></font></b></h2>
When the send_expect procedure returns a failure, it indicates an unreliable
connection to the remote system, and manual verification will confirm this.
Such a failure is fatal to the reliability of any automated system, and
must be corrected before the system can run properly.
<p>
If the procedure itself appears to be malfunctioning, the diagnostics
files that were created during the failure should help in debugging. This
interface has yet to fail with a reliable connection.
