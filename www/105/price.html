<h1>Using Samba to join a Windows NT domain</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/price.html">Rich Price</A></b></p>

<p>
<p> I originally wrote this procedure for use at my place of work.  We
have a number of Windows domains [NT style, not active directory] and I
often need to have a Linux machine join one of them.  This procedure was
developed on a box running Fedora Core 1; however, with simple
modifications (namely, stopping the Samba services manually by invoking the
appropriate script in "/etc/init.d" with the "stop" option), this should
also work for other distributions.

<h3>
Assumptions
</h3>

<ul>
<li>You have administrative access to the domain.
<li>You have root access to the Linux server.
<li>You have access to a GUI on the Linux server [Fedora only.]
</ul>

<h3>
Getting Started
</h3>

<p>
Use the GUI "Services" tool [Which is Main Menu, System Settings, Server
Settings, Services in Fedora] to shut down the samba daemons [smbd and
nmbd] if they are running on the server.  

<h3>
The smb.conf File
</h3>

<p>
Next edit the /etc/samba/sbm.conf file and replace the [global] section with:

<pre class="code">
[global]
   workgroup = {domain}
   server string =  {server name}

   log file = /var/log/samba/%m.log
   max log size = 50

   security = domain
   password server = [name of a PDC or BDC for {domain}]
   encrypt passwords = yes
   smb passwd file = /etc/samba/private/smbpasswd

   local master = no
   wins server =  {wins server}
   dns proxy = no
</pre>

<p>
Where:<br>
{domain} is the name of the domain.<br>
{server name} is the name of this Linux server.<br>
{wins server} is the IP address of a local WINS server.

<p>
At this point you can make any other changes or adds that you want to other sections of this file.

<h3>
The smbpasswd File
</h3>

<p>
For security reasons we will place the smbpasswd file in a private directory using the following commands:

<pre>
cd /etc/samba
mkdir private
cd private
touch smbpasswd
chmod 600 smbpasswd
cd ..
chmod 500 private
</pre>

<p>
Now we will add a dummy entry to the smbpasswd file.  To do this, first create a user account for yourself on the Linux server [unless one already exists], then execute the following commands:

<pre>
cd /etc/samba/private
cat /etc/passwd | mksmbpasswd.sh  &gt; smbpasswd
</pre>

<p>
Finally, edit the smbpasswd file and remove all lines except those for your user account.

<h3>
Joining the Domain
</h3>

<p>
To add the Linux server to the domain use the following command: 

<pre>
net rpc join member -U {administrator}
</pre>

<p>
Where {administrator} is the user id of a domain administrator for {domain}.  
You may be prompted for the administrator's password at this time.

<h3>
Cleaning Up
</h3>

<p>
Use the "Services" tool [Which is Main Menu, System Settings, Server
Settings, Services in Fedora] to start the samba daemons.

<p>
Then use the "Services" tool [Which is Main Menu, System Settings, Server
Settings, Services in Fedora] to enable the Samba service for all of the
appropriate run levels.

<ol>
<li> Select the smb service and enable it for run level 5.
<li> Save changes.
<li> Select the smb service and enable it for run level 4.
<li> Save changes.
<li> Select the smb service and enable it for run level 3.
<li> Save changes and exit services window.
</ol>

Of course there are other ways to modify run levels depending on the
distribution. If anyone has examples of doing this in other distributions I
would be happy to have them added here.
