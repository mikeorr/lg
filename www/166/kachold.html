<h1>Linux Layer 8 Security</h1>

<p>
Linux users and system administrators are often unable to sufficiently
focus on general system changes, log data, and tracking what they
did and when to detect if their systems have been encroached upon.
</p>

<p>
Not all of us can afford an in-line Layer 7 switch, Cisco ASA, or IDS.
During escalated security events, it takes time to set up, e.g., Snort -
which does not detect all encroachments. (See <a
href="#matahari">Matahari</a>, below.) Additionally, production systems are
often under high change control, or utilized so fully that their CPU/memory
capacity is unable to field additional daemons. 
</p>

<a id="#snort"></a>
<h3>Snort</h3>

<p>
Snort can be quickly set up via Live CD, Backtrack, DVL, or other
security tools. A Snort tcpdump can be taken during off-peak hours for
import and full rules-check against a variety of aggressive Layer 4-7
de-network engineering attempts:
</p>

<p>
<a
href="http://www.freeos.com/articles/3496/">http://www.freeos.com/articles/3496/</a>
</p>

<p>
Snort doesn't always see all possible security exploits, however. While it
will evaluate packet traffic in the upper OSI layers, it will miss
backdoors, and binary rootkits. It will also miss shell or SSH access from
past disgruntled staff, unauthorized employees, and other admins or users. 
</p>

<a id="#keyloggers"></a>
<h3>Quick Keyloggers</h3>

<p>
Keyloggers can be a quick honeypot addition, as you evaluate deeper-level
kernel, network, disk, and binary veracity after a suspicious security
event.
</p>

<p>
<strong>CERT recommends that any suspect server be rebuilt, but system
administrators are often remiss in obtaining proof</strong>, right up until
"pwnership" creates escalated reactivity where uptime is only a dream.
Every one of us knows that ownership is equated to stability in America,
right?
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/win-UNIX-system_compromise.html">http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/win-UNIX-system_compromise.html</a>
</p>

<p>

Not all that glitters is gold, however: keyloggers can act as a part of a
honeypot, be a component of PCI compliance, part of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)
audit tools, change management or system administration utilities - or be a
part of Trojan viruses. Certainly, a great deal of system penetration and
changes are done without using a shell (e.g., webmin, sftpd, httpd/DAV
writes, and low level binary trojans - see <a href="#snort">Snort</a> or <a
href="#autopsy">Autopsy</a>).

</p>

<p>
It's becoming more and more common to <em>log all root keystrokes</em> in
layers of trust and secrecy that users, developers, and even system
administrators don't immediately recognize.
</p>

<p>
The three most often deployed keyloggers in Linux systems include:
</p>

<h4>1) PAM Daemon Systems Level</h4>

<p>
While PAM hacking and modifications is a whole subject in and of itself,
various keyloggers can be deployed using PAM. The "rootsh" utility - which
allows you to enable a systems logger that will show everything logged
to the terminal whenever anyone invokes sudo or logs in as a user - is a
great immediate solution.
</p>
 
<p><a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/rootsh/">http://freshmeat.net/projects/rootsh/</a>
</p>

<p>
General implementation recommendations include renaming "rootsh" to
another seemingly innocuous sounding word - like "termd".
</p>

<p>
"rootsh" is immediately useful, especially if you have more than one
system administrator or root user (<em>although you should always disable
root access completely in favor of logged sudo</em>). 
</p>

<p>
It's often too late when we realize that our sudoers file was not
configured to be limited to only a select list of users, or was not logging
(e.g., if we have inherited 200 machines installed with stock sudo -- see
my August 2009 <em>Linux Gazette</em> "<a href="../165/kachold.html">Layer
8 Linux Security</a>" column on maintaining sudo via Puppet). So, perhaps
it went unnoticed that a past disgruntled developer was accessing the
system from his desktop via RDP to SSH and accessing root regularly via
'sudo su'.
</p>

<p>
In startup ISPs and Web development shops in the mid-1990s, a "Nazi"
Linux security administrator would often tire of being on-call 24x7 in
an uncontrollable server farm, and come down with the avant-garde edict
of "no shared root access", whereupon all developers just took escalated
access via escaping system calls from emacs or vi, or via buffer
overflows, and happily changed the access passwords for users: games,
haldaemon, adm, lp, or sync. Similar shops and Linux un-professionals
still exist, unfortunately.
</p>

<!-- ### I don't know what this was supposed to convey... - Ben
<p>
<strong>If something is changing in your systems; something is changing
in your systems.</strong>
</p>
-->

<p>
Since any access to root via sudo can result in changes (and potential
errors), a good keylogger makes a lot of sense as an easily setup secondary
tracking mechanism.
</p>

<p>
PCI compliance and SOX both require controls in place for the root or
administrative user. However, when mixed with corporate profit, these
controls are loosely interpreted to the point of complete insecurity.
<em>If we cannot track change, we control nothing.</em> Implementing a
keylogger will take no more than fifteen to thirty minutes (and can easily
be automated through Puppet), so if you suspect your systems of being
accessed and the logs being wiped, or if you don't have the time to fully
evaluate all binary checksums for rootkits, keyloggers can be a good
immediate additional security tool. 
</p>

<p>
By default, 'rootsh' logs to /var/log/rootsh/ (which can be changed during
setup). Of course, 'rootsh' logs can be edited, like any logs, unless you
use 'syslog-ng', or stunnel loghost or cron-based e-mail log burst, so
hide them well. You will generally find that no one even notices that
'rootsh' is logging, and happily carry on as normal.
</p>

<h4>2) Kernel level keyloggers</h4>

<p>
You might not have a Honeywall server, but Sebek clients (with Honeywall
servers) provide nearly invisible logging capacity for honeypot and
system administration monitoring.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.honeynet.org/tools/sebek/">"http://www.honeynet.org/tools/sebek/></a>
</p>

<p>
Sebek is a kernel module that is also available for Windows machines.
</p>

<p>
Honeywall and other honeypots can be set up to poll selectively. They can
be moved in during the middle of the night, and can be set up with clients
to your servers, from a Live CD/DVD, via VM or Xen virtualization. They
should definitely be included as an adjunct to your disaster recovery
plan/stack.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Too late to plan, can't change extensive system networking or add
kernel mods?  Configure honeymole:

</p>

<h4>3) Hardware based keyloggers</h4>

<p>
These masquerade as USB-to-PCI or other conversion tools, and are most
often deployed at NOCs with KVMs.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.keelog.com/download.html">"http://www.keelog.com/download.html</a>
</p>

<p>
Hardware-based keyloggers are especially useful in that they work across
platforms, provide nearly instant results, and can be reused. However, the
most-savvy system administrators usually see the terminal pause and flash
that accompany use of a hardware logger on a KVM.  But it's possible that
someone accessing your NOC via keyboard/console after a quick lock pick
(certainly, no one will ever verify the cameras -- those only retain 3 days
of footage) or logging into your systems before rifling your cabinets won't
notice your keyloggers at all.
</p>

<p>
Neither "find -mtime", nor careful evaluation of all processes, nor even a
stack trace will ever see a hardware key; even really astute hackers with
well-honed senses often cannot even determine the source in hardware
keyloggers.
</p>

<p>
The legal ramifications of micro-critiquing a system administrator or
engineer for making general typing mistakes are problematic due to the
non-exempt Federal statutes for professionals (since the FLSA standards
require us to be able to work without micro-direction) - but be advised
that all high-level responsible actions are logged post-2001 in America.
While setting up your keyloggers, don't be surprised if you discover
management or security have deployed one of their own.
</p>

<p>
Even at the application Web layer, many large online providers deploy
Akamai caching. Federal security monitoring includes Akamai integration
with various pipe taps, gleaning databases of packet and user access for
individuals "of interest" (cross-matching e-mail or other authentication
cookie info) across cellphone, cable, and dial-up Internet.  Monitoring
information equals power in small and large systems across all OSI layers.
</p>

<h4>Trojan Keyloggers</h4>

<p>
Trojan keyloggers are extensive in variety, attack vector, and application,
from those used by the FBI to log mob boss encryption PGP passphrases, to
browser-based plugins. They include XSS tunnels, LivePerson, 

<!-- ### Say WHAT? Google doesn't turn up anything with that name. - Ben

or kaysea controls,
-->

etc., and are all trivially
deliverable via Sharepoint, GMail, Yahoo, or other Web-based e-mail, in
HTML/Javascript or URI/UTF-8, PDF, JPG, Word/OpenOffice, or other
executable "attack-ments".
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/">http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/securing_browser/</a>
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Much of the above is not trivial by any means, or even possible in most
situations, especially if you're running Linux; some of the attack types
listed here (e.g., keylogger delivery via JPG) exist only as concepts. It
is, however, worth noting that new attack methods are discovered
constantly, that a lot of money is being pumped into attack development
daily, and that any <strong>active</strong> (i.e., executable) attachment
should be regarded with extreme suspicion. -- Ben ]
</p>

<h3>Other Tools</h3>

<p>
<a id="matahari"></a>
<h4>Matahari</h4>
</p>

<p>
Matahari is designed to provide a basic non-interactive shell on remote
systems behind firewalls. It is intended for use by system
administrators who may need some emergency backdoor to access a
firewalled machine.
</p>

<p>
Once you set up the script on the target machine (namely, the client) it
begins trying to retrieve commands from the master machine (the server).
The time between periodic requests (polls) can be configured to suit
different needs, ranging from low latency (frequent polls) to stealthier
behaviors.
</p>

<p>
All traffic between target and master machine is made through HTTP
GET/POST requests and their corresponding responses, traversing
firewalls as standard outgoing Web traffic. Optional IDS-evasion
techniques can be used in special scenarios where a backdoor should
remain totally undetected by firewall administrators.
</p>  

<p>
Matahari.py's HTTP port is configurable; Snort and many IDSes do not
intercept Matahari packets. The script must be set up on both sides, and
is available on Backtrack (KDE --&gt; Maintaining Access --&gt; BackDoors and
Rootkits), or from here:
</p>

<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/matahari/files/matahari/0.1.25/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/matahari/files/matahari/0.1.25/</a>
</p>

<p>
Suspect your server has been compromised? Watch for rogue Python processes
(renamed to something that <em>sounds</em> perfectly believable like
"updatd") and/or Matahari running from anacron (which is often left enabled
yet ignored) that opens scheduled tunnel access.
</p>

<p>
Turn the tables! Matahari is also exceptional as an administrative
security honeypot tool to watch a compromised server for
information-gathering purposes without the crackers catching on, should
you not want to possibly expose additional systems like a logserver, and
have limited setup time.
</p>

<p>
<strong><em>Matahari usage:</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
If you have a target machine (target.freemoney.com) behind your
firewall, and want to be able to execute commands from a master
machine (master.obnosis.com):
</p>

<pre>
# On the target machine: 
./matahari.py -c master.obnosis.com -T polite
</pre>
    
<p>
Use nohup and screen, to be sure process still runs after log off.
</p>

<pre>
# On the master machine: 
./matahari.py -s target.freemoney.com
</pre>

<p>
Reference: <a href="http://matahari.sourceforge.net/">http://matahari.sourceforge.net/</a>
</p>

<h4>dd</h4>

<p>
Always take a 'dd' (a disk image created by the 'dd' program) for analysis
in Autopsy, available from the Backtrack Live CD tools. A terabyte USB disk
or NAS/SAN makes disk imaging easy.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the event in question, a complete security evaluation/audit
might be required to determine the attack vector and to mitigate the risks.
This should take precedence over forensics, once the first sign of proof is
found. In an active attack situation, failing to act is an act leading to
<em>fail</em>. Any recovery model that mandates simply rebuilding without
identification of application-layer issues, physical security issues, or
acceptable use/change management policy holes will leave you destined to
rebuild regularly and often, or wear the "security issue" blinders and
consistently walking away from obvious signs of encroachment.
</p>

<p>
Most users, developers, and system administrators find it trivial to
rebuild and harden a system, then 'dd' its pristine state to a backup
archive before ever bringing it up, so they can restore state as
necessary - assuming that such an archive exists.
</p>

<p>
Any system use model that includes an easy rebuild window is a secure
model. Backing up important files is required for users, developers, and
administrators alike. Puppet or cfengine can reconfigure a system
swiftly, while kickstart/jumpstart can provide network-based rebuilds
using seed files.
</p>

<h3>The Take-Home</h3>

<p>
The single greatest security problem today is ignoring danger or failing
to look for proof when faced with questionable events or evidence.
All users, developers, and administrators hold direct responsibility to
identify, report, prove, and resolve all areas where secure processes
break down across any of the OSI layers.
