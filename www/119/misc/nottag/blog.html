<p><strong>From Jimmy O'Regan 
</strong></p> 
<p><strong>
TAG members' blogs are getting more and more mentions, so I rolled up
an OPML file (blogroll, whatever) for possible inclusion in this
month's 'Gazette Matters' section. (It'd probably be nice to have some
sort of static location for an updateable file, but I'll worry about
that next month).

Thanks, Jimmy. I didn't know that Raj was on del.icio.us, or that Barry
O'Donovan had a blog.

For those of you who haven't tried del.icio.us, I would encourage you to
give it a shot. It's a nice system, but it's not too terribly well
documented, so some features are non-obvious. A couple links for the
interested:

I've been meaning to start a blog but never gotten around to it.  The
convergence of anti-war and pro-war protestors in Texas has given new
impetus, as people seem to be missing the point.  (Yes, Bush lied.  No, an
immediate withdrawl is not necessarily the best choice.  The point is
presidential accountability, honesty, conflicts of interest, etc, not how
long the troops stay.  You have to build a house on solid rock if you want
it to stand.

I agree with a fair amount of that - but let's not forget an important
"and". <em>And</em> we have to stop bleeding from an open wound, NOW.

<blockquote>
Not everybody will agree with me, but my opinion is that Bush and his
cronies are directly responsible for most of the deaths in New Orleans.
<em>They</em> cut the federal funds - e.g., 50+% of the highways and 70+% of
all other roads in the US are out of maintenance due to lack of money
[<a href="#fn.ben1.1">1</a>]; 
57% of all town-maintained bridges are in "barely adequate"
condition [<a href="#fn.ben1.2">2</a>] - 
that was supposed to go to keeping those levees
maintained. <em>They</em> withdrew the people and the equipment (we need them
to Keep Us Safe in Iraq, y'know!) that would have closed that last
breach - the one that forced the last evacuation and sent a 9' wall of
water from Lake Pontchartrain into those areas. <em>They</em> sent so much
plywood to Iraq last year that the people here in the Southeast couldn't
buy any when they needed it to stop the hurricanes from destroying their
homes.

And climate change and our new energy non-policy are much
more serious matters overall.  But we seem to have evolved to the point
where "Stay the course!" and "Bring the troops home now!" are the only
alternatives capable of galvanizing sufficient people to make it happen.
Perhaps that's another Vietnam echo.)

Interesting.  This is not meant to denigrate in any way your service,
which I think was a very honorable action.  But several years ago I read
two independently written books on the subject, both under the same title
"October Surprise".  One was authored by Barbara Honegger, a former White
House aide during the Reagan Admin, the other by Gary Sick, a career Navy
officer who served on the National Security Council staff under Presidents
Ford, Carter, and Reagan and has a doctorate in political science.  Both
books made the same assertion, that the Carter admin's effort to free the
hostages was sabotaged by a group of insiders within the Reagan camp.
Honneger's book was perhaps more detailed; the scope of the investigation
she did was very impressive.

Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that I have absolutely no
confidence in the moral rectitude of the abysmal U.S. foreign policy; and
Iraq is no exception.  The rhetoric was very weak and for a lot us, a thin
but transparent veil to justify a preplanned agenda of completely
unjustified foreign aggression.

For those outside of the U.S., with short memories, or both, Paul
Wellstone was a Senator who was willing to stand up to the Busch mafia,
and had voted against the Iraq war in the Senate.

He was considered by virtually all who knew him to be of very high moral
character, often described as "impossible to dislike", and very dedicated
to the principles of democracy (as much as that word is being abused by he
current administration).  He was killed, along with his wife, daughter two
pilots and two staff members, in a crash of a Beech King plane (25% fewer
fatal crashes than other planes in its class).  No cockpit voice recorder
or flight data recorders were found - both FAA requirements - strangely
missing after an FBI team arrival on the scene from Minneapolis, within
two hours after the crash.  After conducting an investigation, two
university professors, James Fetzer PhD., and Don Jacobs PhD., both
authors of numerous books, collaborated on yet another, "The Strange Death
of Senator Paul Wellstone", and concluded that it had been an
assassination.

I agree, of course - Juan Cole has proposed just exactly such a middle
road, as well as a plan for mitigating the possible fallout for the
locals. These are well-considered plans by intelligent, knowledgeable
people... and I believe that we're going to leave as we did in Vietnam -
a rout that shames us (beyond the shame we already bear as a country for
this) and results in nothing but death and misery for any friends that
we did have in the area.

It's good thinking out of the box, which is what we need.  Funny if the
ultimate proposal comes from outside the government, but those inside

We really need to take the gag off the troops so they can speak freely
for or against the policy, as the rest of the citizenry does.  People
say without loyalty you don't have an army, and that's true to an
extent, but in this case loyalty to commander-in-chief is working
against loyalty to society, a society which desperately needs to know
what's really going on in Iraq and what their ideas are to fix it.
That's been the missing factor in this debate, the people with the best
knowledge aren't allowed to speak, except when their opinion happens to
coincide with the policy.   So the public is left to guess what would
have been said, and how many would say it.  At least, the portion of the
public that notices that something's missing.  (Note that this portion
is larger than just the "anti-war liberals".)

it's a difficult change.

Livejournal at one point had lots of milblogs -- many of them are
"friendslocked" now to comply with the gag order, but those who knew where
to look got an eyeful of the ground troops' stories. You might try using
LJ's search function to troll around. The archive of the lj community
'ljdemocrats' might be a good place to start looking, as well.  I don't
know if the photos are still around that were being uploaded from digital
cameras in Iraq.  While I was looking for that website, I also dug up some
URLs for "stories from those who were there" that you might find of
interest:

may be resting on their millions most of the time but at least they

the consuls would take the field duty in turn (although
sometimes both were present - part of the Arausio disaster), and some of
them paid for it with their lives. That's got a built-in feedback loop
of its own; coupled with the concepts of <em>dignitas</em>, <em>auctoritas</em>, and
<em>pietas</em> (which has little to do with the current meaning of "piety" -
more like my conception of patriotism, along with a respect for the
"natural order" of things), this is what made Rome one of the greatest
societies this world has ever known, for 12+ centuries. We've opened
those loops, disconnected that responsibility from that authority - and
our country is bleeding to death as a result.  An <em>obvious</em>,

It's not that bad, really! Most of the popular blog systems have some
sort of API (e.g. Blogger:
<a href="http://code.blogger.com/archives/atom-docs.html"
	>http://code.blogger.com/archives/atom-docs.html</a>) that's intended for
editing software, but can be used for migration (WordPress does this).
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
You probably don't want to use a hierarchical layout for topics:
multiple tags/categories are <em>much</em> better, just compare del.icio.us
with regular bookmarks. I've yet to come across a free blogging
service that allows you to use categories, but you can simulate the
feature using del.icio.us.

How does del.icio.us cope with existing browser bookmarks?  Can you
upload a file containing all your existing bookmarks and tag em later?

<p><strong>
<img src="../../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)"

No, although people have written scripts to do something similar
(del.icio.us has an API that gives you complete control over your
bookmarks). This sort of behaviour is frowned upon: there's a
bookmarklet around that automatically chooses your tags for you, and the
creators of del.icio.us are considering banning it. They may allow a
default 'system:readlater' tag for untagged items, but in general it
defeats the purpose of the system to add things untagged.

<p><strong>
Front and Back: Blogging
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Straight off the bat, I have to admit that this month's article
doesn't quite fit as neatly under this category, but it does fit the
general theme of matching GUI and CLI apps. This month's candidates are
clive (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ljclive"
	>http://sourceforge.net/projects/ljclive</a>) and
Deepest Sender (<a href="http://deepestsender.mozdev.org"
	>http://deepestsender.mozdev.org</a>), though I
will also look at using BloGtk (<a href="http://blogtk.sourceforge.net"
	>http://blogtk.sourceforge.net</a>)
to access Blogger (<a href="http://www.blogger.com"
	>http://www.blogger.com</a>) and Blogger-compatible
sites.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
So why LiveJournal? Well, it seems most of the net connected world
is blogging, and LiveJournal seems to be the most popular blogging
site. I must admit that, having previously looked at the site, I had
dismissed it as a bunch of teenagers whining about the world - I've
been there, done that, worn the (black) t-shirt, and didn't feel too
inclined to take part in that.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
What changed my mind was discovering that fellow LG author
Ashwin N (<tt>../authors/ashwin.html</tt>) keeps a blog on
LiveJournal, although I had made my mind up to look at at least one
blogging site to see how they were using RSS. Discovering that
LiveJournal also uses FOAF lead to my Damascene conversion.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Why use client software anyway?
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Since LiveJournal is web-based, it's reasonable to assume that a
blog can be updated from your choice of browser, and you would be
correct in that assumption. LiveJournal, however, encourages the use of
client software. I prefer this to trying to use the web interface, for
the simple reason that the links to post entries tend to be hard to
find, and my bookmarks file is too bloated to use.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Another reason is that it makes editing prior entries a lot easier,
though many people frown on this sort of thing. BloGtk also has the
ability to edit offline, which is a major plus for anyone who uses a
modem - it's all too easy to forget that we don't all have ADSL.
(LJ)Clive invokes $EDITOR, so although it doesn't support offline
editing directly, you can always fake it.

Since I'm plugging del.icio.us, I should explain why it's cool. A few
days ago I found a GPL'd Polish &lt
<img src="../../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=";-&gt;" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> English dictionary
(<a href="http://www.bsdguru.org/index.php?f=1100006"
	>http://www.bsdguru.org/index.php?f=1100006</a>). If I was to file this in
my bookmarks, I'd have to choose between, say, 'Polish', 'Software',
or keep bookmarking it in different places until I'm pretty sure I've
got all bases covered.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
With del.icio.us, I bookmark it once, using a convenient bookmarklet,
enter each tag, and it's automatically available in a 'folder' for
each tag: <a href="http://del.icio.us/jimregan/polish"
	>http://del.icio.us/jimregan/polish</a>,
<a href="http://del.icio.us/jimregan/software"
	>http://del.icio.us/jimregan/software</a> and so on. On top of that, you
can combine pairs of tags like this:
<a href="http://del.icio.us/jimregan/polish+software"
	>http://del.icio.us/jimregan/polish+software</a> and see only links with
both tags.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Then there are the benefits that come from del.icio.us being a
multi-user system: I can view  other people's bookmarks, all bookmarks
that use a certain tag, etc. del.icio.us has an 'Inbox' feature, so
you can subscribe to these within del.icio.us, and because it
generates RSS feeds for <em>everything</em>, you can subscribe with a
feedreader. You can also send bookmarks to other people's Inboxes by
using a tag like 'for:jimregan', and because these are also 'regular'
tags, you can use them as normal: I know I've got a funny link that I
thought Jason would enjoy, so I use
<a href="http://del.icio.us/jimregan/humour+for:jcreigh"
	>http://del.icio.us/jimregan/humour+for:jcreigh</a> and there it is:
<a href="http://www.mil-millington.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/diary"
	>http://www.mil-millington.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/diary</a>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
There's also been a recent improvement in the posting interface, so,
when adding a new link, you can click on any of your existing tags,
accept del.icio.us's best guess (a linuxgazette.net link would have
'linux' as a suggestion), or, if the link is popular, choose from a
list of popular tags for that item.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
It also comes with a nice, easy to use REST API, so you can always
grab all your data at any stage.

The programmer in me took that as accepting the OR status, which would
lead to either. (Possibly, accepting the "want" status, where the OR comes
for free.)   "No" would lead to both (negating the OR, preferring AND)
... or to wanting an unlisted item ... and probably to a bit of gentle

<pre><strong>It's late at night. Brian has just finished painting his variety of
"Romans, go home" in Latin, when a Roman centurion arrives with his men.

Centurion:  What is this then? Romanes eunt domus, "People called
            Romanes they go the house"?
Brian:      It-it says, "Romans, go home"!
Centurion:  No, it doesn't! What's Latin for "Roman"? [grabs Brian's
            ear] Come on, come on!
Brian:      Romanus!
Centurion:  Goes like?
Brian:      Annus!
Centurion:  Vocative plural of annus  is...?
Brian:      Anni?
Centurion:  [writes] Romani.  And eunt? What is eunt?
Brian:      "Go"! Let-
Centurion:  Conjugate the verb "to go".
Brian:      Ire; eo, is, it, imus, itis, eunt!
Centurion:  So eunt is...?
Brian:      Third person plural, present indicative. "They go!"
Centurion:  But "Romans, go home" is an order, so you must use the...?
Brian:      The... imperative!
Centurion:  Which is...?
Brian:      I!
Centurion:  [twisting Brian's ear] How many Romans?
Brian:      [yelling] I.. Plural, plural! Ite, ite!
Centurion:  [writing] Ite. Domus?  Nominative? But "go home", it is
            motion towards, isn't it, boy?
Brian:      Dative, sir!

[The centurion promptly draws his swords and presses it against Brian's
throat. Brian yells:]

            No, not dative! Not the dative, sir! No! The... accusative,
            accusative! Domum, sir, ad domum!

Centurion:  Which is?
Brian:      Domum!
Centurion:  [writing] Domum... -um [sheathing his sword] Understand?
            [Brian nods eagerly]
            Now, write it out a hundred times!
Brian:      Yes, sir, thank you, sir! Hail Caesar!
Centurion:  Hail Caesar. If it's not done by sunrise, I'll cut your
            balls off!
Brian:      Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Hail Caesar and

"swipe" is also part of my idiolect. When I use it, it implies a bit of a
swooping foist.  "Swiping fries", for instance, off someone's plate. I
don't think I'd say "kiping fries".
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
'feck' means 'swipe' ?  I know it as a minced oath for "fsck", and had
been lead to believe that was the Irish usage as well, given that silly
comedy that BBCAmerica shows about Irish priests -- "Father Tom" or
something.

"Father Ted"? Brilliant. Look for the episode titled "Speed 3", or the
one where they hold a protest outside the local cinema.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
In most usages, 'feck' is used as a more polite replacement for
'fuck': 'oh feck!', 'feck off', 'he fecked it up', 'that fecker',
'that feckin shitehawk', 'feck ya' (never 'feck you', though); the
actual meaning of 'feck' is 'to take without permission': it would
suffice for both your 'kipe' and 'swipe' examples, and it also applies
in situations where an actual theft has taken place, but the speaker
doesn't wish to acknowledge it as such, but that's harder to explain.
(It's like there's a line to be crossed in the value of things between
fecking and stealing).

On a somewhat related "translating Irishness" note, I was browsing
through the local bookshop today, and came across a local biography. I
can't remember anything about it, other than the fact that it took the
author a whole paragraph to say what amounted to "I was born in
Ireland".
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
I took that as a challenge 
<img src="../../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" alt=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
Allow me to introduce "Typical Irish Biography(TM)" part 1: "I Was
Born in Ireland"
</strong></p>

<table width="95%" border="1" bgcolor="#FFFFCC"><tr><td>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<p><strong>
I need a place to get the ball rolling, so I may as well start at the place
designed for it: at the start. I was born. I don't remember it, but I have some
pretty reliable witnesses to it, so I believe it: I was born.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
That part wasn't my fault. The rest, well, it's open to debate. They say no-one
screws you up like your parents do, but I think I've given it a pretty good
shot, and if I can say I've done one thing right, it may as well be that I did
everything else wrong.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
With the amount of redundancy I've managed to include in the opening pair of
paragraphs, it'd probably be an act of further redundancy to say I was born
in Ireland, and in the course of spending a whole lifetime here, picked up that
oh-so-Irish love of spinning out a story for as long as I can possibly get
away with, a bit more, and a sidelong spin into a different story (but hey!
that's for another time), but I was, and I did.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
So, I was born about as Irish as you can get: my father's family tree stretches
back to the time when we're just making it up anyway (just setting the tone),
and of course, my mother's family originally came from England. About as Irish
as you can get.

If his blogs aren't blogs, then my read on it is that they're
<em>technically</em> blogs in one sense, and not blog-like in another. The
batteries thing is a silly play on the multiple meanings of "battery" (in
this case, storage device for power vs. 'act of beating or pounding'). So,
when Jim said 'not "batteries aren't"', meaning "not 'batteries aren't
batteries'", my response was that being pelted by batteries (power
storage) would indeed be battery. Clear as mud?

Currently, the extent of my *nix'ing is bumbling around on freeshell.org .
Ironically for someone who once declared "they can take my commandline out
of my cold dead hands" and "if I wanted a freakin' Mac, I'd get one, why
do I want <em>Windows</em> ?!", my main computing these days is indeed on one of
<em>those</em> boxes. I'm looking forward to the series Heather mentioned (by her
friend Colleen) about starting *nix from zero. If the main thrust of my
computer interaction wasn't graphic design (desktop publishing and such)
I'd be more tempted to make a complete transistion. As it is...the leap
I'm contemplating is Quark Xpress to Adobe InDesign, not *dows to *nix.
Meanwhile, I figure that hanging around TAG and reading Linux Gazette
won't be a bad way to get a little more comfortable with the other side of
the divide.
