<h2>The Brother Internet Print Protocol</h2>

<p>A recent article <a href="../issue65/jenkins.html">
Internet Printing--Another Way</a> described a printing protocol which
can be used with some 
<a href="http://www.brother.com">Brother</a> printers. It enables users
of Windows machines to send a multi-part base-64 encoded print file via
email directly to a Brother print server.</p>

<p>The article went on to show how the functionality of the Brother print
server can be implemented in simple Perl program which periodically polls
a POP3 server to check for jobs whose parts have all arrived. When such a
job is detected, its parts are downloaded in sequence and decoded for
printing.</p>

<h2>A Linux Client</h2>

<p>The Perl program mentioned above has been in use at my place for a few
months, and has made it a lot easier for me to print Word and other
Microsoft-format documents to a remote printer. But it hasn't made life
any easier for those at my place who use Linux workstations.</p>

<p>A brief search on the Brother website failed to reveal a Linux client,
so it was decided that I should develop one. The result is described
hereunder.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Conventional wisdom probably dictates that a program which breaks a binary
input stream into chunks for feeding into a decoder in sequence - should be
implemented in Perl, or perhaps in C. In fact, the common Bourne shell and
its derivatives have all the necessary capabilities when used with a couple
of general Unix/Linux tools like 'split' and 'wc'.</p>

<h2>Program Walk-Through</h2>

<p>As shown in the listing
(<a href="misc/jenkins/BIPclient.sh.txt">text version</a>),
the program starts by checking that it has been
called with two arguments; a usage message is printed if this is not the
case.  It then defines a function which will be called later to print
a header on each part as it is sent. In particular, this function will
include an address for notification, a part number, a part count, and
a job identifier.</p>

<p>The program body begins by generating an email address for the originator,
together with a timestamp. These are concatenated and used to generate a
name for a scratch directory. A trap is set to remove any directory having
that name in the event of error, and an attempt is made to create the scratch
directory.</p>

<p>The Unix/Linux 'split' utility is then used to split the program input
into parts whose size is given by the first program argument.  Each of these
is fed into a base-64 encoder and mailer (with appropriate pre-amble) to
the address given by the second program argument.</p>

<p>The program ends by removing the scratch directory and returning 
an exit status.</p>

    echo ) | Mail -s "Brother Internet Print Job" $2 
done

rm -rf $Dir                                     # Cleanup and exit
exit 0
</pre>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>In the interests of simplicity, the 'do_header' function shown in
the listing leaves out some of the header lines which
are generated by the Windows client programs,
and uses a dummy value for 'BRO-SERVICE'. In consequence, it may not
work satisfactorily with a genuine Brother print server. If any readers
have such a device, I would be interested in their feedback.<p>

<p>The 'unique' message identifier can actually be duplicated if a user
submits two jobs within the same one-second period; this is a limitation of
the Brother identifier format. An alternative identifier format which inserts
a process number before the user's email address could be used if required.</p>

<p>And finally, the creation of a scratch directory to hold what is
effectively a duplicate of the raw print file - may be seen as a problem
if the client machine has a limited amount of temporary file-space. The
issue here is that we really have to take a copy of the raw print file
as it arrives so that we can generate a "total-parts" figure for
inclusion in the header of each mailed component.</P>

<p>It is possible (using Perl or 'dd') to generate and mail parts on the
fly, without using any temporary files - provided that the server program
is modified slightly so as not to require a "total-parts" figure in
the header of each part. I will be happy to send details to anyone who
would like to do it this way.</p>
