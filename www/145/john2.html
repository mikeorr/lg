<h1>Generating Postscript graphs using PyX</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/john.html">Maxin B. John</a></b></p>

<p>Postscript is an interpreted language which is highly oriented toward
graphics and typography. It is a device-independent, stack-based page
description language used in the desktop publishing area.</p>

<p>As Don Lancaster of <a href=
"http://www.swtpc.com/mholley/RadioElectronics/TV_Typewriter.htm">TV
typewriter</a> fame comments, "Postscript is an underappreciated
yet superb general purpose computing language. In its spare time, PostScript
also excels at dirtying up otherwise clean sheets of paper."<br>
PyX is a Python package which can be used to generate publication-ready,
high-quality PostScript files. It combines an abstraction of the PostScript
drawing model with a TeX/LaTeX interface.</p>

<h3>A prelude to PostScript</h3>
<p>PostScript is an object-oriented, interpreted, dynamically-typed,
stack-based language which follows the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation">Reverse Polish
Notation</a> syntax. PostScript treats images and fonts as a
collection of geometrical objects rather than as bitmaps. As it is an
interpreted language, it needs an interpreter that executes PostScript
instructions. Ghostscript is the most famous PostScript interpreter
which runs on Linux, Windows, and Mac Operating Systems. Since PostScript
is dynamically typed, its variables do not have a declared
type and can contain any kind of value.<br>
As any other programming language, it works with various types of data such
as numbers, characters, strings and arrays. These are referred to as
PostScript 'objects'. It manipulates data using variables
and also using a special entity called a 'stack'. The stack is a piece of
memory set aside for data to be used by PostScript. Like any ordinary stack, it
is a 'last in, first out' type data structure. The operator and operand
handling of a PostScript interpreter can be demonstrated using this small
example:

<pre>
1 2 add
</pre>
The operands 1 and 2 are pushed on to the stack and then the add operator
replaces them with their sum. That is, the 'add' operator removes the top
two numbers from the stack, adds them, and pushes the sum back onto the
stack. The same is true for the 'sub', 'div', 'mod', and 'mul' operators.
</p>

<h3>Let's get our hands dirty with some PostScript snippets</h3>
<p>If I say that PostScript is the world's best programming language to "Just
let it out what is in your heart", it won't be an exaggerated
statement. Imagine the situation where you have a crush on the human being
sitting next to you. You can't use any other language as those languages can
either provide only console based black and white things (totally unromantic) -
or if you managed to get a romantic output, the code will take
several pages. But just think of PostScript - and in 6 lines, you can express
your feelings to the person you care for. See the code in <a href=
"misc/john/heart.ps">heart.ps</a> for example. The recipient will have to invoke a PostScript
interpreter to see the what's in your geek heart, though.</p>
<pre>
gv heart.ps
</pre>
<br>
<img src="misc/john/heart.png" border="1">
<br clear="all">
<br>
<pre>
%!ps                                % Every PostScript program should start with this line.
1 0 0 setrgbcolor                   %sets the color as red (rgb)
250 210 moveto                      %sets the initial position
270 170 100 100 200 275 curveto     %draws the two curves 
400 170 100 100 200 275 curveto
fill
showpage
</pre>
<br>
<br>
<p>A "Hello, world!" program in PostScript is available here [see <a href=
"misc/john/helloworld.ps">helloworld.ps</a>]. It's simple: just issue the
string to be displayed, in parentheses, after setting the font and position
of the text:

<pre>
/Helvetica findfont    % Get the basic font
30 scalefont           % Scale the font to 30 points
setfont                % Make Helvitica the current font
250 450 moveto         % Text positioned at (250,450)
(Hello World !)
show
showpage
</pre>

This will show "Hello World !" in the specified position. Another string
manipulating program which contains a 'for' loop is given here [<a href=
"misc/john/LG.ps">LG.ps</a>]. Another simple program to understand the
graphical nature of PostScript is the drawing of a square using
<strong>lineto</strong> [<a href="misc/john/square.ps">square.ps</a>].
</p>

<h3>A Simple PostScript program using PyX</h3>

<p>
Generally the PostScript programs are generated by other applications.
So from now on, instead of writing by hand, we are giving the
resposibility of generating PostScript programs to a great graphical package
available in Python programming language - <strong>PyX</strong>.<br>
PyX is available for download at the <a href=
"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=45430">SourceForge
Download Page</a>. It can be installed just like any other Python module.

<pre class="code">
tar zxvf PyX-0.10.tar.gz
cd PyX-0.10
python setup.py install
</pre>

A complete installation of Tex should be present in your system as PyX
depends on it. As Tex is usually distributed with almost all the standard
distributions as part of authoring and publishing, it can be easily installed
using the "Add/Remove Software" option in your distribution. If it is not
present, another way to install TeX support in your system is:
<pre>
yum install tetex           # on Redhat/Fedora distributions
apt-get install tetex-latex # on Debian/Ubuntu distributions
</pre>
Now let's try a small Python program to dive into the PostScript world using
PyX [see <a href="misc/john/hello.py">listing5</a>].

<pre class="code">
from pyx import *

c = canvas.canvas()
c.text(10, 10, "Hello, world!")
c.writePSfile("hello")
</pre>

Run this program as <strong>python hello.py</strong> 
</p>
<p>This will create a file "hello.ps" in the present working directory. To
see the output, you can use Ghostview (gv), Gimp, or 'evince' as these programs can also
display the PostScript output.</p>

<h3>Some more PostScript graphs</h3>

<p>
A graph is generally used to depict the relationship between two or more
variables with a discrete or continuous value range. It is very useful in
visualizing collected data. One of such data sets that I collect daily is the
blood sugar count of my mother who is a diabetes patient. This helps us to
regulate her insulin injection volume as well as managing her diet. Last
week's data is [<a href="misc/john/diabetes.dat">diabetes.dat</a>]:
<pre>
Sunday    260
Monday    242
Tuesday   245
Wednesday 228
Thursday  282
Friday    232
Saturday  254
</pre>
<p>
<img src="misc/john/diabetes.png" border="1">
<br clear="all">
The Python program to visualize
this data is [<a href="misc/john/diabetes.py">diabetes.py</a>]:</p>
<p>
<pre>
from pyx import *

g = graph.graphxy(width=8, x=graph.axis.bar())  # creates a graphxy instance
g.plot(graph.data.file("diabetes.dat", xname=0, y=2), [graph.style.changebar()]) # reads data from diabetes.dat 
g.writePSfile("diabetes") # generates the PostScript file
</pre>
<br clear="all">
</p>
<p>
The output of this program is [<a href="misc/john/diabetes.ps">diabetes.ps</a>]. PyX
can generate graphs based on the functions also.
</p>
<p>
<img src="misc/john/sine.png" border="1">
</p>
This program draws the sine function graph [<a href="misc/john/sine.py">sine.py</a>].
<pre>
from pyx import *

g = graph.graphxy(width=8)
g.plot(graph.data.function("y(x)=sin(x)", min=0, max=10))
g.writePSfile("sine")
</pre>
The output of this program is [<a href="misc/john/sine.ps">sine.ps</a>]. The PyX
package supports the generation of 3D graphs with the help of the
'graphxyz'
instance. Exploring the features of PyX will be a truly rewarding experience
if you want to 'visualize' the particular data that you are interested in.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Apart from being the worldwide leader in printing and imaging standard,
PostScript is the champion of platform-independent documentation
standards as well as excellent output quality.<br>
PyX provides a very sophisticated PostScript graph generation mechanism using
the Python language. It provides full access to the PostScript features and helps
the programmer to generate high quality graphs without much effort.
