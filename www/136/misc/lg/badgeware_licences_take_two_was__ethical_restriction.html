&gt; [Yesterday's new MuleSource thing:]
&gt; 
&gt;&gt; It still counts on every UI being able to display that exact graphic
&gt;&gt; (the license text even includes the graphic), which doesn't seem to
&gt;&gt; comply with OSD 10.
&gt;  
&gt; Indeed, that's a good point -- that the presence of a "user interface"
&gt; doesn't necessarily imply a <em>graphical</em> user interface.  (Come to think
&gt; of it, I'm not even sure that a <em>GUI</em> would necessarily always be able
&gt; to display that particular 250 x 52 pixel GIF, either.)

<p>
Their FAQ (<a href="http://mulesource.com/products/licensing.php">http://mulesource.com/products/licensing.php</a>) also has the
interesting interpretation that one cannot:
</p>

<pre>
* Sell any MSPL covered code
* Sell derived works of Mule
</pre>
No wonder "the MPL is one of the more accepted open source licenses"
(same page)...

Yes.  You may recall I asked John Roberts of SugarCRM to explain how a very
similar FAQ entry on <em>that</em> firm's Web pages could possibly be
consistent with SugarCRM supposedly being open source -- it's still
there, by the way[1] -- and Roberts completely and scrupulously ignored
my question.
</p>

<p>
Isn't it funny how many of these folk suddenly become selectively unable
to perceive your mail, the moment it starts including inconvenient
questions?
</p>

<p>
More to the immediate point, is there <em>anyone</em> left on this mailing list
who still doubts that the primary aim of all the "Exhibit B" addenda we've
seen from these 20-odd companies (most having cloned and slightly
mutated SugarCRM's clause, which pioneered the concept) is to impair
commercial reuse?  The MuleSource and SugarCRM FAQs say third parties
_may not sell derivatives_.  And MuleSource's CEO says outright that
their licence's main point is to force commercial users to buy separate
commercial licences![2]  How much clearer could this possibly be?
</p>

<p>
Anyway, predictably, we're now seeing the beginning of Badgeware Take Two --
MuleSource yesterday, probably Socialtext in a few days or so.  The new
tack seems to be to <em>try</em> to defuse the heretofore slam-dunk OSD#10
argument (which effort from MuleSource I do appreciate, as it at least
tries, and can probably be fixed in that area), but retains from Take
One the "big logo with name and URL must be shoved into every user's
face" notion.  Which, unlike an About screen that <em>isn't</em> force-fed, is,
as noted, _advertising, not attribution_.
</p>

<p>
By analogy:  If I slip a movie DVD into my Linux iBook and launch Xine,
I'm able to <em>skip</em> the three minutes of trailers and Interpol notices
the studios want me to have no choice but to sit through (which is why
the Menu and similar remote-control buttons are locked out during
startup, on consumer DVD players).  The badgeware companies want to
mandate in perpetuity the same level of eyeball control over users --
and I'll be surprised if Socialtext's resubmission doesn't follow suit.
(If I end up being pleasantly surprised, great.)

Something I forgot to address earlier.  Craig Muth wrote:

&gt; Although I think many here on the list have made valid refutations for
&gt; many points raised by SugarCRM, I think this one still stands:
&gt;
&gt; &gt; I guess they didn't notice that it's not open source.  They
&gt; &gt; downloaded it, accessed the source, modified it, forked it, and
&gt; &gt; redistributed it.  If it smells like open source and tastes like
&gt; &gt; open source...maybe it's open source? 
</pre>

<p>
I'll bet John Roberts (and Craig Muth) would <em>really</em> like SATAN, then.
No, not Satan; SATAN, the Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing
Networks, released in 1995 by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema.  The licence
is similar to that of pre-3.0 releases of Tripwire and the
source-available (pre-6.0) releases of PGP:  You could download the
source, access the source, modify the source, fork the source, and
redistribute the source.
</p>

<p>
If you weren't paying attention, you might consider those facts to
constitute "smelling like open source and tasting like open source" --
and might hastily conclude that it <em>was</em> open source.  
</p>

<p>
Until you read the licence.  If you were, and were paying attention,
you'd realise that Farmer and Venema had reserved most commercial rights
to themselves.
</p>

<p>
Oh, John seems to have forgotten about that:  You can have the right to
download, access, modify, fork, and redistribute the source, and yet it
might <em>not</em> be open source. 
</p>

<p>
SATAN's still available:  It's just that nobody's cared in a decade,
because its licensing crippled reuse, leaving a gap into which
alternatives like Nessus stepped eventually.
</p>

<p>
SugarCRM's rather softer licence -- as Ben Tilly would point out in all
capital letters -- doesn't actually make commercial users UNABLE to
exercise those rights.  It just seeks to make them UNWILLING.  (And
their FAQ, of course, claims "UNABLE".)
</p>

<p>
And that, friends, is what this is really all about.

venture capital, including $8 million from its main VC backer, Draper

The Board of Advisors includes Matt Asay, and also Andrew Aitken of

firms, and in general you keep seeing a lot of the same faces.)
