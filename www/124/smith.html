<h1>Build a Six-headed, Six-user Linux System</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/smith.html">Bob Smith</A></b></p>

<p>
<a name="Intro"></a> <h2>Introduction</h2>
<img src="misc/smith/sixusers.jpg" alt="Six users on one computer" align="right" border="2" hspace="10" vspace="10">
<p>
<b>A Multi-Seat Linux Box: </b>This tutorial shows how to build a
multi-head, multi-user Linux box using a recent distribution of
Linux and standard USB keyboards and mice.  Xorg calls this
arrangement a "multi-seat" system.
<p>
<b>Advantages of a Multi-Seat System: </b>  
The advantages of multi-seat systems in schools, Internet cafes,
and libraries include more than just saving money.  They include
much lower noise pollution, much less power consumption, and
lowered space requirements.  For many applications, power and
noise budgets are as important as initial cost.
</p>

<p>
<b>Requirements: </b>To build a multi-seat system you need a 
video adapter, keyboard, and mouse for each seat.
For six seats, you'll also need a motherboard with an AGP slot
and five available PCI slots.
In our test system we used USB keyboards and mice exclusively,
but you can use a PS/2 keyboard and mouse for one of the seats if you wish.
</p>

<p>
Xorg 6.9 or later is required, but this already ships with
many of the major distributions.  Our test system uses the free
version of Mandriva 2006 and we did not rebuild the kernel or
install any additional packages.
</p>
<a name="Overview"></a> <h2>Overview</h2>
We divide the implementation of a multi-seat system into five
main steps:
<ol>
<li>Select and Install the Hardware</li>
<li>Install Linux</li>
<li>Record Hardware Configuration</li>
<li>Modify xorg.conf</li>
<li>Modify gdm.conf</li>
</ol>
After installing the hardware and installing Linux, we read the
hardware configuration from the lspci command or from the 
/proc/bus/input/devices file.  Most of the effort in setting up
a multi-seat system is in transcribing the hardware information
into the xorg.conf file.

<a name="step1"></a> <h2>Step 1: Select and Install the Hardware</h2>
<b>Selecting the Hardware: </b> There are few set rules dictating
what hardware to use in your multi-seat system.  Of necessity, some
of the keyboards and mice need to use USB, but there is no minimum
CPU or memory requirements.  We suggest building and testing a
multi-seat system using a computer that you already have, and using
the test results to help scale your hardware requirements.  You may
be surprised how modest the CPU and memory requirements are for a
multi-seat system that is used only for web browsing.
<p>
If possible, try to use accelerated video cards, but for increased
reliability, avoid video cards with on-board fans.
Use recent video cards; older video cards often have a problem
sharing the PCI bus.
We've had good luck with nVidia cards but you can try recent
cards from other manufacturers too.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hardware for our test system: </b> For our system we chose to use
video cards based on the nVidia MX4000 chipset.  They are accelerated,
have no fans, and it was nice having one driver for all six video
cards.  The downside of nVidia is that the driver is closed source
and you need to download and install it.  If you use an nVidia card,
be sure to check their web site for the recommended BIOS settings for
your cards.
</p>

<p>

<img src="misc/smith/hydra_small.jpg" alt="A typical PC" align="right" border="2" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a>
We used an ECS 755-A2 motherboard with an AMD64-3200 processor and
1 GB of RAM.  Our power supply is a CoolMax 140mm Power Supply and
the CPU heat sink is a Thermaltake "Sonic Tower".  During our testing
we added a low noise fan to cool the video cards.  Airflow is in at
the bottom, past the video cards, up past the CPU cooler and out
through the power supply.  This airflow seemed to work pretty well.
At quiescence, the CPU temperature was 31C, rising to only 38C after
fifteen minutes of kernel compile.  The current from the mains at
quiescence was 0.25 amps, and during a kernel compile it was 0.35
amps.
</p>

<p>
You will probably need some USB hubs to connect all of the keyboards
and mice.  One problem to think about before permanently installing
the hardware is cable management.  Seven power cords, six monitor
cables, three USB hubs, six keyboard cables, and six mice cables:
that is a lot of cabling!
</p>

<a name="step2"></a> <h2>Step 2: Install Linux</h2>
Multi-seat capability is provided by  Xorg 6.9/7.0 which already ships
with most of the major distributions.  When you install Linux, you
might want to install all of the window managers including fluxbox and
twm.  If you are going to use the nVidia drivers, be sure to install
the kernel source too.
<p>
Do the installation with all of the hardware connected and powered
up.  Mandriva did a great job detecting and configuring all six of
our video heads.  Select a default run level of 3 so that X does 
not start automatically after boot.  You can check the installation
by logging in and running <tt>startx</tt>.  If all has gone well
you should be able to move your mouse across all six monitors.
</p>

<p>
Mandriva allows up to ten entries in the /dev/input directory.  We
needed twelve since we had six keyboards and mice.  We increased the
limit to sixteen by changing the line in /etc/udev/ruled.d/50-mdk.rules
from:
<br>
<tt><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KERNEL=="event[0-9]*",     NAME="input/%k",  MODE="0600"</tt>
<br>to:
<tt><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KERNEL=="event[0-9a-f]*",  NAME="input/%k",  MODE="0600"</tt>
</p>

<a name="step3"></a> <h2>Step 3: Record Hardware Configuration</h2>
All hardware in our computer has a name that distinguishes it from
similar hardware in the computer.  In this step we record the names
for each of our video heads, keyboards, and mice.  Let's start with
the video cards.
<p>
Video cards are identified by their address on the PCI bus.  We can
list the hardware on the PCI buses using the <tt>lspci</tt> command.
On our test system, the lspci command gives the following result:
</p>
<pre class="code">
lspci | grep VGA
00:09.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x] (rev c1)
00:0a.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x] (rev c1)
00:0b.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x] (rev c1)
00:0c.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x] (rev c1)
00:0d.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x] (rev c1)
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV18 [GeForce4 MX 4000 AGP 8x] (rev c1)
</pre>
The bus address is the first field in the lines above.  The number 
before the colon identifies which PCI bus (computers often have more
than one), and the second number gives the card address on the bus.
You will need to know these addresses to build the xorg.conf
configuration file.
<p>
The mice are easy to locate.  Each mouse has an entry in the /dev/input
directory.  An <tt>ls</tt> can identify the mice.
</p>
<pre class="code">
ls /dev/input/mouse*
/dev/input/mouse0  /dev/input/mouse2  /dev/input/mouse4
/dev/input/mouse1  /dev/input/mouse3  /dev/input/mouse5
</pre>
The keyboards are identified as a /dev/input/eventN file.  Do a
<tt>more</tt> of /proc/bus/input/devices.  Each keyboard will have
an entry that specifies the event file.  The following two entries
are for the first two keyboards in our system.
<pre class="code">
more /proc/bus/input/devices

</pre>
<p>
A table is a nice way to view all of the above information.
</p>

<p>
<table align="left" border="1" cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr><th>Seat</th>
    <th>Video Card</th>
    <th>Keyboard<br>(/dev/input/)</th>
    <th>Mouse<br>(/dev/input/)</th>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">0</td>
    <td align="center">00:09:0</td>
    <td align="center">event6</td>
    <td align="center">mouse0</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="center">00:10:0</td>
    <td align="center">event7</td>
    <td align="center">mouse1</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">2</td>
    <td align="center">00:11:0</td>
    <td align="center">event8</td>
    <td align="center">mouse2</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">3</td>
    <td align="center">00:12:0</td>
    <td align="center">event9</td>
    <td align="center">mouse3</td>

    <td align="center">00:13:0</td>
    <td align="center">event10</td>
    <td align="center">mouse4</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="center">5</td>
    <td align="center">01:00:0</td>
    <td align="center">event11</td>
    <td align="center">mouse5</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<br clear="all"></p>

<p>
Note the slight change in how the video cards are addressed.  Also, you'll
find the numbering of the keyboards and mice easier if you plug each mouse
into the same hub as its corresponding keyboard.  Don't worry too much
about matching the video head to the keyboard.  After setting everything
up you can move the monitors or the keyboards around as needed.
</p>
<a name="step4"></a> <h2>Step 4: Build xorg.conf</h2>
The xorg.conf file has sections to describe keyboards, mice, video cards,
monitors, screens, and seats.  Most of the work in setting up a multi-seat
system is correctly copying the information in the above table into the
appropriate section of the xorg.conf file.  Shown below is our
configuration for seat 5.  You should be able to use this configuration
as a prototype for your additional seats.  Note the places where the
keyboard, mouse, and video card information is located.  Since we were
borrowing monitors for our test, we forced all of the monitors to be flat
panel displays with a 1024 by 768 resolution.

<pre class="code">

</pre>
There is a simple trick to help verify that all the numbers in
the xorg.conf file are right -- pass the file through <tt>sort</tt>
and <tt>uniq</tt>.<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sort /etc/X11/xorg.conf | uniq
</pre>

<p class="editorial">[ 'sort xorg.conf|uniq -d' would also be helpful -
just in case you had mistakenly repeated any of the device strings. --
Ben ]</p>

The output of the above command string will make obvious any errors
in numbering the various keyboards and such.
<p>
<b>Testing Your Xorg.conf File: </b>  It is a good idea to test
your configuration and to sort out the keyboards and mice by
bringing up the heads one at a time.  Login remotely so that you
are not using any of the video heads.  Enter the following commands
for each of the six heads (0 to 5).  (The commands below are for
head 5.)<br>
</p><pre>X -novtswitch -sharevts -nolisten tcp -layout seat5 :5 &amp; 
xterm -display :5 &amp;
</pre>
If the above command fails, examine the error messages and check
the xorg.conf file.  If the command succeeds, use the xterm to help
identify which keyboard and mouse go to which head.  The keyboards,
mice, and video cards are enumerated in the same order on every 
boot, so you will only have to move things around during the initial
set up.
<p>
The above commands might be sufficient if you don't need user logins.
For example, a six headed kiosk might need only X and a web browser
on each head.


</p>
<a name="step5"></a> <h2>Step 5: Modify gdm.conf</h2>
If you want user logins you will need to modify the configuration
for your preferred display manager.  The directions given here are
for <tt>gdm</tt> but the changes are very similar for <tt>kdm</tt>,
or for the X display manager, <tt>xdm</tt>.
<p>
Modify the <tt>[servers]</tt> section near the bottom of the 
/etc/X11/gdm/gdm.conf file to tell gdm which X servers to start.  The
lines should be:
</p>

<pre class="code">
0=Standard0
1=Standard1
2=Standard2
3=Standard3
4=Standard4
5=Standard5
</pre>
You need to tell gdm how to start the X server on each head.  The
lines to do this are:
<pre class="code">
[server-Standard5]
name=Standard server
command=/usr/X11R6/bin/X -nolisten tcp -novtswitch -sharevts -layout seat5
flexible=true
</pre>
You'll need a section like the above for each head.  The server name,
"Standard5" in the above example, must match the name given in the
<tt>[servers]</tt> section.  Customize the X command line options to
meet the requirements of your particular system.
<p>
Once everything is configured, you should be able to start graphical
logins by switching to runlevel 5.
</p><pre>telinit 5
</pre>
If everything works, make the default runlevel 5 by editing /etc/inittab
or by setting it using <tt>drakconf</tt>.

<a name="test"></a> <h2>Test Results, Costs, and Problems</h2>
<b>Performance Results: </b> Between resets, we found performance to
be excellent for six users doing typical PC tasks, including web
browsing, email, word processing, and games.  The accelerated graphics
cards seemed to do most of the work so that even arcade style games and
web-based video did not put much of a load on the CPU.  If "3200" is
an accurate assessment of the performance of the AMD64-3200, then a CPU
with a performance of "1600" would have been more than sufficient.
<p>
<b>Cost: </b> Not including the monitor, each seat in our system cost
about $67.  This includes $40 for the MX4000 based video card, $20 for
a USB keyboard, $5 for a USB mouse, and $2 for half of a USB hub.  Our
test system used expensive keyboards that have a built-in USB hub which
we intended for per-user flash drives or audio players.
</p>

<p>
The shared part of our system cost about $520.  This includes $180 for
the CPU, $50 for the motherboard, $90 for RAM, and $50 for the CPU
heat sink.  The case, power supply, and disk drive had a combined
cost of about $150.
</p>

<p>
We give these prices just for comparison.  You may find lower prices
that these and we'd certainly recommend that you replace our $230 CPU
and motherboard with an Athlon 2800+ set that costs about $80.  We
have not included the cost of the monitors since these prices are in
free fall and your particular needs and tastes may dictate what you
spend.
</p>

<p>
<b>Problems: </b> Did you catch the phrase "between resets" above?
While the system worked very well, it was extremely unstable.  In
particular, we got a kernel oops fairly often when we logged out.
A syslog trace of one such oops is available <a href="http://www.linuxtoys.org/multiseat/hydra_hang.txt">
here</a>.  We've tried several things to fix this problem including:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>turning APIC off and on
</li><li>reducing the number of heads
</li><li>trying the 'nv' and 'vesa' drivers
</li><li>using NoInt10
</li><li>upgrading to the official X11R6.9 release
</li><li>upgrading to the 2.6.15 kernel
</li><li>using <tt>xdm</tt> and <tt>fvwm</tt> instead of <tt>gdm</tt> and Gnome
</li></ul>
The problem persists.  Please let bsmith at linuxtoys dot org know
if you have any ideas that might help fix this problem.
<p>
A much less severe problem is that some programs assume that there
is a single user on the PC.  Screen savers can take a lot of CPU power
and both KDE and Gnome complain if they don't have audio output.
Any shared resource, such as audio or a CD burner, can be a problem.
</p>

<p>
As a longer-term concern, we will need to address security issues
surrounding multi-seat computers.  Whether from students or cafe patrons,
these systems are going to come under deliberate, malicious attack.  Can we
trust KDE and Gnome to withstand such attacks?  

</p>
<a name="summary"></a> <h2>Summary</h2>
A multi-head, multi-user Linux system is now possible using commodity
PC hardware and standard Linux distributions.  Multi-seat Linux PCs
seem inevitable given the potential savings in cost, noise, and power.
