check on the partitions after a power failure.

<blockquote><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)" height="28" width="50" align="bottom">I was thinking about this recently and I came upon an intereseting
idea.  (I think a friend of mine used the following trick in a
commercial product he built around Linux).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>The trick is to install two root filesystems (preferably on different
drives -- possibly even on different controllers).  One of them is the
"Rescue Root" the other is the "Production Root."  You then configure
the "rescue root" partition as the default LILO device and modify the
shutdown sequence to over-ride that default with an <tt>/sbin/lilo -R</tt>
command.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the system boots from the rescue root it is because the system
was booted irregularly.  The standard shutdown sequence was not
run.  That rescue root can then do various diagnostics on the 
product root and other filesystems.  If necessary it can <tt>newfs</tt> and
restore the full production environment (from another, normally unused,
directory partition or drive).  The design of the rescue root is a 
matter for some consideration and research.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Normally the system will boot into "production" mode.  Periodically
it can mount the alternative root fs to do filesystem checks and/or
an <em>extra</em> filesystem to do backups (of changes to the configuration
files).  You can ensure that these configuration backups are done
under a version control system so that degenerative sets of changes
can be automatically backed out in an orderly fashion.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>If you combine this with a watchdog timer card and a set of appropriate
system monitoring daemons (which all talk to a dispatch that periodically
resets the watchdog timer), you should have a system that has about the
most bulletproof autorecovery as is possible on PC equipment.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>I should note that I haven't prototyped such a system yet.  I've 
just thought of it.  A friend of mine also suggested that we devise
a way to have another proximate system also doing monitoring 
(possibly via a null modem).  He says he knows how to make a special
cable which would plug into the guard dog's printer/parallel port
(guard dog is what I've been calling the hypothetical proximal
system) and would be run into the case of the system we're monitoring
where it would be fit over the reset pins.  This, with a small driver
should be able to strobe the reset line.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>(In fact I joked that we could create a really special cable that would
daisy chain to as many as eight other systems and allow independent
reboot of any of them).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>In any event the monitor system would presumably monitor some/most
of the same things as the watchdog timer; so I don't know what 
benefit it would ultimately offer (unless it was prepared to 
do or initiate failover to another standby system).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Perhaps this idea might be of interest to the maintainer of the
<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/ALPHA/linux-ha/High-Availability-HOWTO.html">High-Availability HOWTO</a>  (Harald Milz -- whom I've blind copied 
on this message).  It's not really "High Availability" but 
"Automated Recovery" which might be sufficiently close for many
applications.  (i.e. if a web, mail, dns, or ftp server's downtime
can be reduced from "mean hours per incident" to "mean minutes per 
incident" most sysadmins still get lots of points).

<p><strong>... The minima in a '<em>stripped down</em>' <tt>/</tt> [root] partition vary
depending on where
<tt>/lib</tt>, <tt>/var</tt>, and <tt>/usr</tt> end up -- of late, a lot of distributions'
packages feel a need to live in <tt>/bin</tt> or <tt>/sbin</tt> unnecessarily -- and
probably <em>should</em> be in the <tt>/usr</tt> tree ... Likewise, if a package
is NOT statically linked, one can end up with problems, if a
partition randomly decides to 'go south.'
