	"OS" is not so precisely defined that you can defend this

<br><br>
????  I sincerely doubt it.  Perhaps the mac had an emulator that ran
win 95 programs.  Apart from anything else, win 95 is i386 only and
won't run on a 68000 (or whatever macs use these days).

	These are the most popular PC
	<A HREF="http://www.emulation.net/">emulators under MacOS</A>.

<br><br>
	Modern Macs run the G3 (PowerPC) processor, and the performance
	of Win '95 under VirtualPC is tolerable (about equivalent to a
	Pentium 90 on a 250 Mhz G3 Powerbook (laptop) and about a
	Pentium 75 on a 180 Mhz Performa).

<br><br>
	Getting back to the original question:

<br><br>
	There is a shareware package (distributed as source code
	and available for free evaluation) by Kevin Lawton called Bochs.

<br><br>
	This started as a PC emulator (hardware) emulation for Unix
	(including Linux) that is allegedly capable of supporting Win
	'95 under emulation.  It apparently isn't quite up to supporting
	NT (apparently the CPU emulation is only 386 and NT requires
	486 or Pentium emulation).  For info on that look at the
	Bochs web site:
        (<A HREF="http://world.std.com/~bochs/">http://world.std.com/~bochs/</A>).
        It looks like Kevin will be upgrading the processor emulation
	as time (and possibly funds) allow.  Apparently you can
	License this package for $25.  (I haven't used it yet, but
	I might send him the money just 'cause I'm so impressed
	by the effort).

<br><br>
	I know this doesn't answer the question <EM>Yet</EM> but hang with
	me a moment.  Someone named David Ross seems to have ported
	<A HREF="http://v.nu/core/Bochs/">Bochs</A> to the Win32 platform,
	thus allegedly allowing one to run Linux, FreeBSD, or (presumably)
	most other forms of x86 Unix.

	>Having answered the basic question (where can you find
	a PC emulator for Win '9x) I have to add my own suggestion:
<br><br>
		<div align="center">Don't do it.</div>

<br><br>
	You can buy a cheap PC (even an old used 486) for next to
	nothing (I've recently had one 40Mhz 386 given to me for free);
	and you can install Linux on that.

<br><br>
	(My main household server is a 10 year old 386/33 with 32
	Mb of RAM.  Eventually I'll install some extra RAM and
	a new disk into that "new" 386 and throw it up as an
	extra server on my LAN).

<br><br>
	Once you have a machine (give it at least 16Mb and at least
	a 540Mb drive) then you can just slap a null modem between
	it and you desktop machine, or toss in a couple of ether
	cards and a cross-over 10BaseT cord (or even by a little
	4 or 5 port hub).  Once that's done you can use a terminal
	package (like Hyperterm, Telix, or K95 -- Columbia U's
	Kermit for Win '9x), or even Kermit for DOS) to connect
	to the Linux box.  If you go the ethernet route you can
	use Win '95's '<TT>TELNET.EXE</TT>' or you can still use K95
	(it's also a telnet client --- and it's terminal emulation
	is far less buggy than Microsoft's --- so you won't need
	a custom termcap/terminfo file to run "curses" (Unix/Linux
	"full scree" terminal/console) applications).

<br><br>
	There are two reasons for me to suggest this approach:

<br><br>
	First, you are likely to be very unhappy with the performance
	of running any form of Unix under emulation.  Although
	Linux performs adequately on a 386 with only 16Mb of RAM
	--- and some kernels can run in as little as 2Mb --- you'll
	probably just find emulation to be too frustrating to be useful
	--- particularly when using any Unix networking utilities.

<br><br>
	The only two viable reasons I can see for the mode of operation
	that you've requested are:

<ul>
		<li>You want to play with Unix to learn it.

		<li>You want to use <TT>Perl</TT>/<TT>awk</TT>, or other text
		processing tools that are considered to be "Unix" utilities.
</ul>

	You won't learn as much about Unix by running it under emulation
	--- and you'll probably end up being too frustrated by its
	performance to come away with a realistic appreciation of it.

<br><br>
	In the other case you can get versions of <TT>Perl</TT>, <TT>awk</TT>,
	and most other Unix utilities, shells, editors and many other tools that
	have been <A HREF="http://www.itribe.net/virtunix/">ported to Win32</A>
	(and even to DOS, often using the GNU'ish Go32 "DOS extender").

<br><br>
	The other reason for my suggestion is that Linux, even on a
	lowly 386, makes a great server.  My box has over 6Gb of online
	storage (which I'll probably double in the 40Mhz) a magneto
	optical drive, a CD-ROM and a CDR recorder, a 4mm DAT
	autochanger, a modem line (which handles uucp, incoming and
	outgoing fax, dial out terminal/BBS'ing, dial in terminal, and
	dial out PPP and will handle dial-up PPP when I get around to
	configuring it), a null modem into the living room (for use from an
	old XT laptop) and some other toys.

<br><br>
	The machine has currently been up for about three months.

<br><br>
	I forget why I rebooted three months ago, maybe I built a new
	kernel for it or maybe I just made some changes to the startup
	files and wanted to make sure it would come up automatically.
	It's been used as my mail gateway and newserver for a few years
	--- and it was used as my primary interactive machine (mostly
	text editing) for years.  My wife and our various house guests
	sometime still use it or the dumb terminal to read their mail
	(if they don't want to use one of the Pentium's in the living
	room or in my bedroom).  Sometimes I dial into to it from
	a client site (I'm a consultant) or even from some local
	coffee house using the Ricochet wireless to telco gateway
	(offered in selected areas by Metricom:
	(<A HREF="http://www.metricom.com/">http://www.metricom.com/</A>).

<br><br>
	You can use Linux as a gateway. Its kernel offers an optional
	feature called "IP Masquerading" which is a special form of
	"network address translation" (NAT) that allows you to hide a
	whole network of computers (using "private net IP addresses"
	like <TT>10.*.*.*</TT>, <TT>192.168.*.*</TT> and others defined in the
	RFC 1918). It is trivial to install a package called '<TT>diald</TT>'
	that will dial up your ISP on demand (automatically when any of
	you computers try to access the Internet -- or any other
	non-local nets) and will automatically drop the line after
	a configurable period of inactivity.  This puts virtually
	no load on a machine (not measurable on my 386!).

<br><br>
	Another handy server role you can assign to your Unix box
	(Linux or otherwise) is as a household schedule/reminder
	service.  The Unix '<TT>cron</TT>' and '<TT>at</TT>' facilities are just
	perfect for this.  You can write simple scripts and
	schedule them for periodic execution (<TT>cron</TT>) or for one
	time execution in the future (<TT>at</TT>).  With slightly more
	complex scripts (using the GNU '<TT>date</TT>' command, and
	simple shell conditionals and tests) you can do
	arbitrarily complex scheduling.  It is truly easy to
	set this up to automatically e-mail you reminders
	post them to your "intranet web server" or to even page
	you (using a normal modem) as an alarm service.

<br><br>
	Eventually I expect someone to release a set of CGI scripts
	to act as a front end to a reminder/alarm service --- which
	you could toss up on your "intranet" server.

<br><br>
	Using a little box as an "intranet" web server for a
	household or small business also takes almost no memory
	or CPU power on a Linux or FreeBSD box.  I think the
	overhead is about 70K for a small web server, and you can
	even configure them to be "dynamically" loaded if you're
	really pressed for RAM.    The little box can also function
	as a fileserver for you Win '95 box by using Samba, a Unix
	package that provides Windows/NT compatible file sharing.
	It's easy to run all of these functions on the same box,
	they don't conflict with one another at all, and most of
	them present very little load on the server.

<br><br>
	On top of all that you can use the old clunker to run household
	appliance over the old BSR X-10 "Powerhouse" interface (also sold as
	"ActiveHome").  Larry Wall just gave a talk at the
	<A HREF="http://www.svlug.org/">Silicon Valley Linux user's group</A>
	showing us a demo of how he's automated his house.  It was
	incredibly amusing.  He has a detector on his clothes
	dryer, in the garage, that announces through the household
	PA system when the laundry is done; and motion sensors
	on the walk way leading up to the front door to announce
	visitors, and scripts to tell his wife and kids when they get
	mail (presumably he gets too much mail to want such an
	announcment for himself).

<br><br>
	Naturally you can put a sound card in the PC and run
	PA/Speakers off of it to do various cool things.

<br><br>
	The point is that you can't do all of this when you're
	running Unix in an emulator under Win '95 (since the
	chances are too great that you'll need to reboot it, and
	also since your emulator won't have access to most of
	the hardware that we're talking about --- it can only
	access the virtual/emulated hardware.   The other problem
	is that Win '95 is generally not nearly as stable as
	any form of Unix.  Even NT doesn't come close to Linux,
	FreeBSD, or any of the popular forms of Unix for stability.

<br><br>
	For the same reasons you won't benefit nearly as much from
	a dual or multi boot configuration.  There's not much point
	to having a "server" that you keep rebooting to play
	<A HREF="http://www.idsoftware.com/archives/doomarc.html">Doom</A>
	(which is available for Linux, BTW) or to read that MS
	Word document.

<br><br>
	Although I've focused on Linux (and I prefer it for my
	personal use) all of what I've said applies to
	<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>,
	<A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A>, and
	<A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> among others.
	(There are some differences, the *BSD's don't have their NAT/masquerading
	and packet filtering in the kernel -- it's run as a
	user process, things like that.  If you're learning
	Unix for professional reasons I'd definitely suggest that
	you clock in some time and practice on any one of the
	BSD systems as well as on a Linux box.  Potential employers
	(in Unix savvy companies) will be far more intrigued by
	entry level applicants who've worked with BSD.

<br><br>
	Also, if you want to play with the X Window system (the
	dominant tehnology for supporting GUI's under Unix ---
	though, technically, it is a communications protocol and
	programming API --- and not a "GUI")  you won't want to
	run it on less than a Pentium.  In that situation I'd
	put one (character only) installation on the cheap/used
	PC and install a dual boot configuration on your main
	(Win '95) workstation.  The best way to do that is to
	install an extra hard drive on the workstation (so you
	don't need to repartition your existing drives).

<br><br>
	Even you decide to put one of the BSD's on your cheap/used
	server you should probably still put Linux on your
	Win '9x workstation.  There are two reasons for this:

<ol>
	<li>there are more commercially available
		   productivity applications available for Linux
		   (WordPerfect, StarOffice, Applixware, Cliq,
		    Wingz, etc).

	<li>Linux has <EM>very</EM> good support for DOS, and
		   Windows filesystems (and even some, read-only
		   and even NTFS and HPFS).  You can even install
		   a small Linux distributions directly into a
		   DOS subdirectory.
</ol>

	You could install Linux on the workstation and have it
	access most of its files (almost all of them) over the
	network (over NFS).  All you need on a Unix box is a
	fairly small "root" filesystem.  20 Mb is enough for
	all the "root" files (all you <EM>really</EM> need is
	<TT>/etc</TT>, <TT>/dev/</TT>, and <TT>/sbin</TT>
	-- the rest can all be mounted
	over the LAN though I'd suggest adding a local swap
	file or partition, and a local <TT>/tmp</TT> directory).

<br><br>
	If you do an installation like this: (with one server
	installation on a dedicated PC and another on your
	workstation -- say FreeBSD on the server and Linux
	on a multi-boot for your Win '9x box) you'll get the
	maximum benefits and you'll learn enough about Unix
	to qualify for professional work in the field.

<br><br>
	So, in conclusion:  You won't learn nearly as much about
	Unix from any form of "emulation" or dual-boot arrangement.
	The principle advantage of Unix has always been the client
	server model it uses.  Unix "wants" to be a server.  It's
	as important to learn this philosophy as it is to learn
	the syntax for a couple hundred Unix commands.  So, that's
	the best approach to installing and learning it around your
	house.
