Everything looks fine to me.  I would suggest you move the default port to
another address: something high (&lt; 64000) and random. A cracker seeing
something open on port 22 will do an SSH attack, but on port 54256 he won't
know what program to use.

<p>
IIUC, I think it's asking for your passphrase, the one you used to generate
the key-pair, no?  To get around that, you have to generate keys with no
pass-phrase (which is considered A Bad Thing).

Not only that, but despite

<pre>
&gt; setting PermitRootLogin to 'no', and AllowUsers to 'user' (the name of
&gt; the account I set up), when attempting to login as either root or any
&gt; other user on the machine, the ssh client simply asks for the account
&gt; password three times and then fails, instead of failing immediately -
&gt; is it supposed to do that?
</pre>
</p>


<p>
Yes, it's supposed to do that.  With that behaviour (prompting for the
password three times), the cracker isn't sure if A) root logins are disabled
or B) he has the wrong password. If it failed immediately, he would know
that A was true.  Anything to slow the little buggers down.

I would do that, but there are firewalls in the way...

<p>
Ahhhh - I had not considered that. Yet the password I enter is the
same as the account password, so either I messed up somewhere or I
simply made the passphrase the same as the password...

<p>
Is there an easy way to tell?

If you are seeing a lot of attempts at root logins, then an
alternative to this is to use rate-limiting for SSH connections.  At
least this saves you some bandwidth.

<p>
I found I had to change "UsePAM" to "no" instead of "yes" to get ssh
to stop prompting for a password. Other than that, it looks like your
sshd_config is similar to mine.
</p>

<p>
Hope it helps,
Peter.

There's a bit more to that story. If "UsePAM" is set to "yes", 'ssh' is
going to use the PAM authentication mechanism defined for it - e.g., on
my system, that would be the '/etc/pam.d/ssh'. One of the early bits of
configuration there looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# Standard Un*x authentication.
@include common-auth
</pre>
My 'common-auth', in the same directory, looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# Removed the 'nullok_secure' option - Ben 10/26/2005
# auth    required    pam_unix.so nullok_secure
auth    required    pam_unix.so
</pre>
("nullok_secure" (a Debian-specific option) supports passwordless
"pam_unix" logins from TTYs listed in '/etc/securetty'; this can be
necessary for initial installations. However, 'nullok' in general is at
least a little dangerous - it allows null passwords - so I remove it on
any system I own where I'm not the sole user.)
</p>

<p>
In other words, you now have a couple of choices: you can disable PAM
auth entirely by setting "UsePAM" to "no", or you can leave "UsePAM" set
to "yes" and modify '/etc/pam.d/ssh' to provide a flexible, tailored
configuration for account management, authentication management,
password management, and session management - in other words, the very
reason that you have PAM installed on the system in the first place.
</p>

<p>
Either of these approaches is valid, depending on what you want - but it
seems to me that the latter provides the most flexibility and better,
finer-grained access to securing a given service.
