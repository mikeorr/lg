Dear all,
</p>

<p>
I have already moved into icewm, idesk, claws-mail, aterm, VLC,
audacious etc... with some other light application to realize speed in
my linux box.
</p>

<pre>
CPU -- AMD Duron 1.5 GHz
RAM -- 128 MB
Swap -- 512 MB
Video Shared memory -- 8 MB
</pre>

<p>
I'm happy to see the quick response time of my system ( comparably fast
than kde ). I also like to add some nice look to my desktop with
calendar, clock, volume control etc... Hence I am thinking to use
adesklets as it is fast due to imlib2. I know some
of you are using adesklets. What is your experience about it ? Is it a
right choice to use it with a system which I have ?
</p>

<p>
Please share your thoughts. Kindly CC to me.
</p>

<p>
Thanks

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
    I have read the article of yours from
   <a href='../136/anonymous.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/136/anonymous.html</a>. I am trying to write a small
   driver program, i have written it, but little bit of redesigning is
   needed. So it would be great anyone of you can help me.. i am posting my
   question below ..
</p>

<p>
   I wrote a simple keyboard driver program, which detects the control k
   (CTRL + K) sequence [I have written the code to manipulate only ctrl + k].
   I also have a simple application program which does a normal
   multiplication function.
</p>

<p>
   I need to invoke that application program from my driver when I press ctrl
   + k in my keyboard [once I press the ctrl + k, driver will send a SIGUSR1
   signal to my application program. That will accept the signal and perform
   multiplication]. I could do that if I hardcode the pid of application
   progam [pid of a.out fille] in driver. Ie, inside the function
   kill_proc(5385, SIGUSR1, 0), the first parameter is the pid of application
   program.
   But this is not a correct method, every time I need to compile the
   application program open the driver add the pid to it, compile it using
   Makefile then insert the .ko file, it doesn't look good. I tried using -1
   as the first parameter for kill_proc () [to send the SIGNAL to all the
   process that are listening], since my application program is also
   listening to the SIGNAL, ideally it should catch the SIGUSR1 signal and
   execute It, but it's not working* 1/4.
</p>

<p>
   Can you suggest any method to send the SIGUSR1 signal from my driver
   [which is in kernal spcae] to application program [which is in userspace]?
</p>

<p>
   Having an entry of pid to /proc also i can achieve this, but that is not a
   good design. <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">, Can it be implemented through ioctl?
</p>

<p>
   I am pasting my codes below...

<p>
Hello all,
</p>

<p>
Linux port of DTrace has been moving for some time now.
</p>

<p>
I just tried the latest bits from
<a href='ftp://crisp.dynalias.com/pub/release/website/dtrace'>ftp://crisp.dynalias.com/pub/release/website/dtrace</a> and the initial
impression is we got really cool stuff (in the making here).
</p>

<p>
Besides, GCC, Kernel headers, you will need the following stuffs to
compile and load the DTrace kernel module:
</p>

<pre>
   * libelf-dev: Working with 'elf' files
   * zlib libraries: working with the zlib files
   * bison, flex
</pre>

<p>
Once you have got them, extract the sources and do:
</p>

<pre>
  1. make all
  2. sudo make install
  3. sudo make load
</pre>

<p>
If you do not see any error message, then the DTrace kernel module
'dtracedrv' has been correctly insrted.dtrace -l should display a long
list of the currently available probes.
</p>

<p>
Read the rest at <a href='http://amitksaha.blogspot.com/2009/03/dtrace-on-linux.html'>http://amitksaha.blogspot.com/2009/03/dtrace-on-linux.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
(The code doesn't format properly here, hence the link to the blog)

<p>
Best,

<p>
Well done, Arild! Yep, exactly what I mean.
</p>

<p>
What this implies to me is that 1) you have "tripwire" installed (which
you don't need), and 2) that you <em>don't</em> have the "siggen" package (as
contrasted against the "siggen" program) installed. If you had both, the
latter would normally get executed first - because it gets installed in
a "higher priority" directory.
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ apt-file search bin/siggen
siggen: /usr/bin/siggen
tripwire: /usr/sbin/siggen
</pre>

<p>
In the default execution path, "/usr/bin" comes before "/usr/sbin" - so
"/usr/bin/siggen" would get executed first. Here's what you need to do
to fix it:
</p>

<pre>
sudo dpkg -P tripwire
sudo apt-get install siggen
</pre>

<p>
That should take care of it. After you've run the above two commands,
you should be able to type "siggen" at the command line and see the
sound generator application.

Hello everyone.
</p>

<p>
Im needing to configure a temporary internet server here, and after
reading a lot, I'm kinda confused :P
</p>

<p>
I need a non-transparent proxy (asks users for theyr username/pass),
with the ability to block access to certain pages and services (like
www.orkut.com or MSN), plus the ability to generate usage reports.
</p>

<p>
I saw several programs that can do that, but each article I read uses
a diferent combo - thats what confused me <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
So, the question is, what software would you use to create such a
configuration?
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the input

<p>
Almost not worth mentioning, but I've made a substantive albeit
de-minimus addition to your editorial note, consisting of the words
"non-root":
</p>



<p>
&lt;p class="editorial"&gt;[ A common application of this would be to run a Web
or FTP server chrooted in a directory like /home/www or
/home/ftp; this provides an excellent layer of security, since even a
malicious non-root user who manages to crack that server is stuck in a
"filesystem" that contains few or no tools, no useful files other than
the ones already available for viewing or downloading, and no way to get
up "above" the top of that filesystem. This is referred to as a "chroot
jail". -- Ben ] 
</p>



<p>
Take my word for it, without that qualifier, you'd attract quibbles from
people repeating the usual mantra:  "chroot(8) is not root safe."
(Ditto the chroot() system call.)
</p>

<p>
That is, the root user, and thus also any process that can escalate to 
UID0 privilege can trivially escape from any chroot jail:
<a href='http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Abusing_chroot'>http://kerneltrap.org/Linux/Abusing_chroot</a>
<a href='http://unixwiz.net/techtips/chroot-practices.html'>http://unixwiz.net/techtips/chroot-practices.html</a>
<a href='http://www.bpfh.net/simes/computing/chroot-break.html'>http://www.bpfh.net/simes/computing/chroot-break.html</a>
</p>

<p>
(You'll note that the article lists other ways of <em>indirect</em> ways of
escalating privilege, plus "Why would anyone put <em>that</em> in a chroot
jail?" methods such as "Follow a pre-existing hard link to outside the
jail.")
</p>

<p>
If you want to be <em>almost</em> safe against kibbitzers writing in to 
say "chroot is not a security tool!" (another common mantra), amend your
footnote to say that the tool must be used with care as some known means
exist to attack it, and that it's no substitute for eschewing dangerous
software and configurations.  And maybe link to one or more of those
links.
</p>

<p>
Hi Gang...
</p>

<p>
here's the situation:
Suppose I log on into server A twice using same user ID (let's say
johndoe). Technically, Linux in server A will create two /dev/pts for
johndoe, likely /dev/pts/0 and /dev/pts/1
</p>

<p>
Is there any way that for johndoe in pts/0 to read what the other
johndoe type in pts/1? Possibly in real time? Initially I thought it
could be done by using "history" command (in bash shell), but it
failed.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi.

What's the current thinking about Macromedia Flash and accessibility. I've 
done some googling and many accessibility guides I've found are fairly old,

Reason I'm asking is that an organisation I help out has had someone

macromedia flash.

In general I'm severely prejudiced against flash, but I want to give them

Hello TAG!
</p>

<p>
Im doing some PHP coding on my machine, and I have apache running on
another machine. I setup'ed a shared folder, and everytime i want to
test something, I put it on the shared folder, then change to the
other machine (on a KVM switch), and do "sudo cp -r * \var\www" and
"sudo rm -r *" (on the shared folder of course), then switch back to
my machine, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Question is - is there any simple way of automatizing that? I didnt
want complex systems, I wanted something that detected when there is
any file in the shared folder, then moved it to /var/www.
</p>

<p>
So, any of you got something that does that?
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the attention
</p>

<p>

<p>
This sounds a lot like "I'm taking a course, and I'd like the Internet 
to do my homework for me."   I'll give you generally correct advice, 
with enough lies in here to give you a failing grade if you don't verify 
my statements.
</p>

<p>
If I were setting up a system as you described, I'd focus on what the 
network clients are capable of, and what requires the least non-standard 
configuration on them (because misconfiguration of the client 
workstation is an easy way to introduce insecurity, and it's hard for 
you to enforce their config).
</p>

<p>
The Windows boxes want Windows networking, the Unix-like ones want Unix 
networking.  A Unix server is most likely to give you both easily, 
although almost any server OS can.
</p>

<p>
So the servers should be running SAMBA for Windows logon and network 
shares, plus LDAP and NFS for Unix logon and sharing.  SAMBA can be 
configured to authenticate against the local LDAP server, so it can 
become your single source of knowledge for user accounts.  You can share 
the same directories on the server via SAMBA and NFS, so they become 
your centralized storage.
</p>

<p>
Encrypting network traffic is very much the least of your concern.  So 
many people think security means "encrypt stuff!", when it is the high 
level protocols (logon, authorization) that matters.  Nobody will bother 
with packet sniffing when they can just read the files directly from the 
file server.  Besides, in a wired network, the switches will ensure 
packets only go to the machines where they are supposed to be, so 
sniffing is pointless.  If you really want to waste your time, ipsec, or 
tunneling NFS through SSL will work (wireless should use WPA2 with as 
many bits as makes you happy.
</p>

<p>
To make the network fast, you should grease your network cables.  
Security can be improve by adding cable locks to all the computers, and 
putting in a steel door with a deadbolt, and bars on the windows.

Hello Ben and all,
</p>

<p>
I am now using icewm with idesk (Version: 0.7.5-4). My combination still 
missing the wallpaper. Everytime idesk reports
</p>

<pre>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[idesk] Background's file not found.
[idesk] Background's source not found.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</pre>

<p>
Though I have the proper path set there
</p>

<pre>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Background.Delay: 1
  Background.Source: /home/joy/pics/Father
  Background.File: /home/joy/pics/Father/love.jpg
  Background.Mode: Center
  Background.Color: #FFFFFF 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
</pre>

<p>
I have even checked those image in kde and the image folder as the source of 
slideshow in kde. Everything running well. Don't know why idesk gives the

<p>
Ben Okopnik recommended a software program called "xoscope" and gave a
link to a website showing how to build an input circuit  or use a sound
card.
</p>

<p>
I now have the sound card microphone input working and the Xoscope
display up;  but the sounds from the mike goes to the speakers, not the
xoscope display.  What do I do to link the two?
</p>

<p>
I'm a newcomer to Linux, so please go easy with the jargon. I installed
UBUNTU only a month ago. I am still learning how to use it.

Hello everyone.
</p>

<p>
I just finished installing/configuring squid on a Ubuntu 8.10 server,
and im having the following problem:
</p>

<p>
Clients time-out when trying to access any webpage - access.log gives me:
<pre>
179383 192.168.0.1 TCP_MISS/504 2898 GET <a href='http://www.google.com/'>http://www.google.com/</a> -
DIRECT/209.85.193.104 text/html
</pre>

<p>
after reading about it, i thought adding no_cache allow localnet to my
squid.conf file would fix the problem, but it doesnt (I already have
an ACL saying localnet = 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0 and an http_access
allow localnet in the same config file)
</p>

<p>
Anyone know what might be the problem?
</p>

<p>
Thanks

This cutting and pasting  between various screens on two different computer 
is a real PITA.
</p>

<p>
As you can see from  the forwarding I also had to invoke the use of a third 
computer on a different address. I have no way to directly link  the two 
different computer directly. At least none that I know  of.   And having to 
copy  down  letter by letter what I see on one machine  to get it into the 
other machine is error prone.  Is there a quick way to  network  a Windows 
and a linux machine together so the two can see each other and copy each 
other's files?
