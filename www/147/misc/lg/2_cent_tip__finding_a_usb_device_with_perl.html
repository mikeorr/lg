<p>
Greetings,
</p>

<p>
I got a USB toy for Christmas that didn't have a *nix client. After some
detective work I found a Perl module that did what I needed, except that
the module tried to access the toy with specific vendor and product ids.
For whatever reason my toy's ids did not match, so I modified the module
to search for my device. [1]
</p>

<p>
The first step is to find the product name for your device. This is
easily done with `lsusb` on the command line.
</p>

<p>
Next, break our your text editor and write some code. Remember, because
Perl uses libusb you will have to run your code as root; if you get
errors about being unable to access the device, then this is probably
the cause.
</p>

<p>
Here is the code that I used (was inside a sub, hence the use of 'return'): 
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
my $usb = Device::USB-&gt;new;
my $dev;
foreach($usb-&gt;list_devices())
{
  $dev = $usb-&gt;find_device($_-&gt;idVendor(), $_-&gt;idProduct()) and last if $_-&gt;product() eq "YOUR PRODUCT'S NAME FROM lsusb";
}
 
return -1 if !$dev;
</pre>
This code iterates over the buses, checking each product's name for our
device's name from `lsusb`. If the device is found, then it will store
the handler in '$dev' and break out of the loop, else it will bubble the
error up by returning a negative value. When the device is found you
would claim and control it as normal (example in the 'new()' sub from
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/src/PEN/Device-USB-MissileLauncher-RocketBaby-1.00/lib/Device/USB/MissileLauncher/RocketBaby.pm">http://search.cpan.org/src/PEN/Device-USB-MissileLauncher-RocketBaby-1.00/lib/Device/USB/MissileLauncher/RocketBaby.pm</a>).
</p>

<p>
If you are interested, I was playing with
Device::USB::MissileLauncher::RocketBaby
(<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~pen/Device-USB-MissileLauncher-RocketBaby-1.00/lib/Device/USB/MissileLauncher/RocketBaby.pm">http://search.cpan.org/~pen/Device-USB-MissileLauncher-RocketBaby-1.00/lib/Device/USB/MissileLauncher/RocketBaby.pm</a>). 
</p>

<p>
[1] It turns out that my USB toy uses the same ids; I probably just
tried to run the code when the device was unplugged. Oh well, at least I
got to learn how Perl interfaces with [USB] devices.

Perl doesn't require an explicit 'return' from subs; the return of a
sub, unless an explicit return is forced, is the last item evaluated.
As well, "-1" is not a typical error value; instead, you'd usually
return a null and use a simple logical test to report it (unless you're
a diehard C or Java programmer, in which case you have an excuse to use
'-1'. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Lost causes are my favorite time-wasting exercise, Sam. Besides, I
already <em>said</em> you had an excuse. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; prefacing all my Perl code with a comment block on how I appreciate

&gt; natural obfuscation algorithm by using ... unique ... syntax is
&gt; ridiculous. 
</pre>

<p>
Every language has its own ("unique") syntax; Perl's makes many things
easier (for example, by recognizing the obvious fact that every
subroutine returns <strong>something</strong> - and that it usually does so at the end
of the code block.) Just because you originally learned to code in a way
that intentionally makes things more difficult doesn't mean that you
have to stay that way: initially, you learned to eat by shoving your
hands and face into your food [1], but I've seen you use a fork and even
a spoon. Semi-successfully, anyway. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
 
[1] Watching my little boy eat - Michael isn't up to table manners quite
yet - naturally makes my thoughts turn in this direction. However,
imagining little Sam with his face smeared with mashed potatoes would
make anyone wish for high levels of abstraction and LONG chains of
pointers to distant objects...

</pre>

<p>
I'm sure that snorting your pudding felt natural at one point too. I
hope it doesn't any longer. It's just a matter of learning what's
appropriate in a given environment.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Just
&gt; because code can be written shorter doesn't mean it should be (see
&gt; Code Golf).
</pre>

<p>
By the same token, writing code with extra noise, cargo-cult coding, and
lots of unnecessary punctuation only obfuscates it. Well-written code is
easy to read - and typical C or Java code fails that test, mostly by
using 5x the verbiage to obscure the actual work that's being done.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
open F, "file.txt" or die "file.txt: $!\n";
</pre>
```
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
 
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    FILE *f_out;
    if (!(f_out = fopen("file.txt", "r"))) {
         perror("file.txt");
        exit(1);
	}
}
'''
</p>

<p>
To me, the Perl version is much more readable.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; p.s. Sorry, I forgot to run my Perl code through the LG Perl compiler
&gt; - `#!/usr/bin/bens-brain` - before posting it. ;-)
</pre>

<p>
Sam, when you post sub-optimal code - no matter what the language -
people here are going to comment on it (if they're familiar with the
language, that is.) That's pretty standard here in TAG, and it makes for
a good learning opportunity: note that Ren&eacute;'s response, when the code in
his recent post was corrected, consisted of cheerfulness and gratitude.
You should learn from that. Ditch the bitching and say "thanks" instead.

My mental defensive mechanisms have already done me the favor of
blanking out that experience; I can only surmise that it must have been
horrendous. What is it with you Boston people, anyway? You've got an
ocean full of perfectly good fish, and what do you do with it? Something
that I have to work to forget. Sheesh...

(Admittedly, given that I consider "weird" to be a positive modifier
when I'm ordering food, "failures" of that sort are my own
responsibility. In that part of the NorthEast, though, they consider
"bland" as some sort of virtue - so there's necessarily going to be
conflict. To Sam's credit, he's managed to entertain me and Kat both -
and we've enjoyed most things that we ordered there. But it's still fun

<p>
As opposed to what, the soft-shelled but hard-headed residents of Hull?
These days, I'm still imparting my wisdom in reasonably small chunks;
the manual-writing deal hasn't happened yet, but I still haven't given
up on it. Besides, the manual on spoon management has been around for a
while now.
