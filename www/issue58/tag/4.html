I know this is a very newbie question, but a link to your URL came up in the
HTML Writers' Guild List today &amp; from the looks of your site, you MUST be
experts on Linux &amp; I "should" be able to get a straight answer from a
"definitive" source.

How the heck does one pronounce "Linux"?  I have heard "line-ux" &amp; "len-ux".
Which is it??

There are at least three common pronunciations, and none are
authoritative.  Because Linus is an ethnic Swede from Finland, he
pronounces it with a short "ee" sound we don't have in English.
Some people pronounce it "Line-ix" like the English version of Linus.
Others pronounce it "linnix", trying to imitate the Swedish.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(The last vowel, being unstressed, can sound like a short i, short u,
or schwa, as is normal rules of English.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now that Linus has been in the US a few years, he's starting to adopt
an American pronunciation.  When I saw him speak at LinuxWorld in 98,
he pronounced his name "Line-us" and his OS "linnix".  Even when he
used both in the same sentance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, he has said he doesn't care how people pronounce it.  He just
wants people to use it.

A reasonable case could be made for the 3 following:
<dl>
<dt>
line-ux
<dd>per English standard rules for the spelling.
<dt>lin-ix
<dd>rhymes with "minix" which it was designed to resemble

I forgot about this.  Yes, that was the original reason Linux was
pronounced that way in 1991.  Minix was a Unix-like operating system
that ran on PCs (XTs in those days), which Linux was based on.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have long disliked this pronunciation (linnix) because I don't see
why Linux should be tied down to the name of an OS that is inferior,
not free, and practically ceased to be used by 1993 or so.

<dl>
<dt>lin-ooks
<dd>rhymes with Linus, its core man but by no means its only programmer,
even for the kernel.

There is a definitive soundbite record by Linux Torvalds, available from
kernel.org:
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/SillySounds"
	>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/SillySounds</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's available in either English or Swedish, and he says "My name is Linus
Torvalds, and I pronounce Linux, Linux."  Thus it's also definitive for
how his own name is pronounced.  Some of the major distributions also come
with a .wav of the sound, as a sample.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hope this made Linux a little more fun!

Linus' reluctance to

his own pronounciation.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I met him, he introduced himself as LINE-us.  And in his talks,
he says LIN-ucks (last I heard anyway.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The "Hello this is LEE-nus Torvalds, and I pronounce LEE-nucks as
LEE-nucks" (as heard on the old .au file) does not match current
practice.

 If you can play an .au file:
<blockquote>
<code>
 <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/SillySounds/english.au"
	>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/SillySounds/english.au</A>
</code>
</blockquote>

 Has Linus Torvalds himself explaining how to pronounce "linux".
 <br>And the answer is, "lee-nooks".
 <br>The nearest common English is "li-nucks"
 <br>with a short "i".  It certainly isn't "line-ux" with a long "i"
 or "len-ux" like the water heater manufacturer, either!

I should tread lightly here because Dan's my boss 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">, but this sound
was recorded many years ago, around 1992 or 93, and a lot has happened
since then.  For instance, the entire period of Linux ascendancy,
the loud debates about how to pronounce Linux, Linus' reluctance to
be the pronounciation police (quite consistent with his pragmatic
character), and his move to the US and subsequent inconsistencies in
his own pronounciation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After 1 1/2 years of working at a company that officially pronounces it
"linnix", I've been half browbeaten into submission.  Now I end up
saying "line-ux" and "linnix" inconsistently in the same sentance.  For
instance, "This month's Linnix Journal has an article about Line-ix
sound drivers."
