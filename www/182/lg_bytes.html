<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Russia's Prime Minister Signs Order to Move to Open Source</h3>
<p>
As reported in Glyn Moody's <a
href="http://opendotdotdot.blogspot.com/2010/12/putin-orders-russian-move-to-gnulinux.html">Open</a>
blog, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian government agencies
to switch to open source software by 2015. The transition is due to begin during
the second quarter of 2011. The Russian government also plans to build a
unified national repository for open source software.
</p>

<p>
According to Moody, previous attempts to move parts of the Russian
government to open source software had experienced a lukewarm reception
due to a lack of political support. However, he writes, <em>"if Putin says:
'make it so,' I suspect that a lot of people will jump pretty fast to make
sure that it *is* so. [...] once that happens, other plans to roll out
free software might well suddenly look rather more attractive."</em>
</p>

<p> The <a
href="http://filearchive.cnews.ru/doc/2010/06/17/2299p.doc">order</a>
mandates a broad set of related changes in education at all levels,
including professional training for federal and civilian employees. It also
covers a number of specific directives for the ministries of health,
science, and communications, and specifies the implementation of "open
source operating systems, hardware drivers, and programs for servers and
desktop use."
</p>

<p>
The Business Software Alliance, a trade group representing large U.S.
software vendors, estimates that 67 percent of software used in Russia in
2009 was pirated.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[ Given that the net effect of "pirated" software is,
and has always been, a positive benefit to the members of the Alliance - no
actual cost for the software distribution, and a large pool of IT people
trained in the use of their platforms and products - it's interesting to
speculate on the eventual result of these changes with regard to those
members. It seems that trading on that particular "pity bait" is coming to
an abrupt end...<br> -- Ben Okopnik ] </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation's Annual 'Who Writes Linux' Study Released</h3>

<p>The Linux Foundation has published its annual report on Linux kernel 
development, detailing who does the work, who sponsors it and how fast 
the Linux kernel is growing.</p>

<p>As Amanda McPherson states in her blog, this paper documents how hard 
at work the Linux community has been. There have been 1.5 million 
lines of code added to the kernel since the 2009 update. Since the 
last paper, additions and changes translate to an amazing 9,058 lines 
added, 4,495 lines removed, and 1,978 lines changed every day, 
weekends and holidays included.</p>

<p>A significant change this year was the increasing contributions by 
companies and developers working in the  mobile and embedded computing 
space. For more information on the study, see the blog entry here:
<a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/blogs/browse/2010/12/our-annual-kernel-development-report-new-and-old-faces">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/blogs/browse/2010/12/our-annual-kernel-development-report-new-and-old-faces</a>.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Novell Agrees to be Acquired by Attachmate Corporation</h3>

<p>In November, Novell entered into a definitive merger agreement under 
which Attachmate Corporation would acquire Novell for $6.10 per share 
in cash, which was valued at approximately $2.2 billion. Attachmate 
Corporation is owned by an investment group led by Francisco Partners, 
Golden Gate Capital and Thoma Bravo. Novell also entered into a 
definitive agreement for the concurrent sale of certain intellectual 
property assets to CPTN Holdings LLC, a consortium of technology 
companies organized by Microsoft Corporation, for $450 million in 
cash.  That sale of IP assets has raised some concerns in the Open 
Source community.</p>

<p>Attachmate Corporation plans to operate Novell as two business units: 
Novell and SUSE; and will join them with its other holdings, 
Attachmate and NetIQ.</p>

<p>The $6.10 per share consideration represents a premium of 28% to 
Novell's closing share price on March 2, 2010, and a 9% premium to 
Novell's closing stock price on November 19, 2010.  Since the merger 
was announced, 2 shareholder suits have been filed questioning the 
deal.</p>

<p>"After a thorough review of a broad range of alternatives to enhance 
stockholder value, our Board of Directors concluded that the best 
available alternative was the combination of a merger with Attachmate 
Corporation and a sale of certain intellectual property assets to the 
consortium," said Ron Hovsepian, president and CEO of Novell. "We are 
pleased that these transactions appropriately recognize the value of 
Novell's relationships, technology and solutions, while providing our 
stockholders with an attractive cash premium for their investment."</p>

<p>There was some concern in the blogosphere that this patent portfolio 
might strengthen Microsoft's hand with regard to Linux.   However, 
many are expected to reflect on Novell's Office and collaboration 
products.  </p>

<p>Groklaw's  November post Novell Sells Some IP to a MS-Organized 
Consortium asks "...so what goes to Microsoft's consortium? No doubt 
we'll find out in time. It is being reported that what it will get is 
882 patents. Blech. How many does Novell own? Is that all of them? If 
so, will we get to watch Son of SCO, but with patents this time? But 
keep in mind that the WordPerfect litigation could be in this picture, 
and I wonder if this could be a kind of deal to tactfully settle it 
out, with Microsoft paying to end it this way?"</p>

<p>Groklaw also notes that prior contracts and promises made by Novell 
will probably remain in force: 
"As for the question of what happens to prior promises Novell made, if 
they are contractual, you go by the contract. In a stock for stock 
merger, I'm told by a lawyer, all obligations remain in force. In an 
asset sale, the two negotiate who gets what. But if the buyer *takes 
over* a contract, then they have to honor all of the terms of the 
contract, such as a patent license or cross license."</p>

<p>Attachmate Corporation's acquisition of Novell is subject to customary 
closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 
2011.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Releases RHEL 6 </h3>
<p>In mid-November,  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was delivered with over 
three years' worth of customer-focused product innovation for 
advancing data-center efficiency.</p>
 
<p>In a blog post, Tim Burke, Vice President, Linux Development at Red 
Hat stated:</p>
<p>"In my development team we feel a tremendous sense of pride in that we 
have the privilege of being at a confluence point of technology 
innovation and customer need fulfillment. This gives us a full 
life-cycle of gratification in that we get to build it, test it, 
harden it and learn from this where the next iteration of technology 
advancement may flow. Red Hat is well positioned to provide the 
10-year support life-cycle for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 - nobody can 
support something better than the team that leads the technology 
building and integration. From our perspective, there's no greater 
praise than to see the releases harnessed by customers - that's a 
win-win situation."</p>

<p>Some notable enhancements among the literally several thousand
comprising Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6:</p>

<h4>Scalability</h4>

<p>- up to 2X improvement in network rates;</br>
- 2X to 5X improvement in multi-user file-system workloads;</br>
- Virtualization I/O enhancements allowing increased consolidation 
(more guests per host) while at the same time reducing I/O overhead 
significantly in comparison to bare metal.</p>

<h4>Datacenter Operational Flexibility</h4>
<p>- Control groups - enables the system administrator to control 
resource consumption - for network &amp; disk I/O, memory consumption and 
CPU utilization. </p>
<p>- Svirt - refers to SELinux-based security enhancements for 
virtualization - enabling policy to constrain each virtualized guest's 
ability to access resources like files, network ports and 
applications. This forms a two-layer check and balance system whereby 
in a multi-tenancy environment if one guest were able to exploit a 
vulnerability in the virtualization layer, the enhanced policy is 
designed to block that guest from accessing resources of other 
virtualized guests or the host platform.</p>
<p>- More Efficient IT - from a power consumption perspective, the most 
efficient CPU is the one that is powered off - especially important 
for large systems - ie: 64 CPUs. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 combines a 
new system scheduler with more intimate knowledge of the low-level 
hardware topology to yield a 25 percent reduction in power consumption 
versus Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 for a lightly loaded system - by 
intelligently placing underutilized CPUs (and other peripherals) into 
low power states.</p>

<h4>Reliability</h4>
<p>- Enhanced resilience and isolation of hardware failures with 
fine-grained error reporting  to mark faulty memory pages as unusable, 
plus hardware based memory mirroring and failing peripheral isolation.
Integration of hardware-based data check-summing at the storage level 
for improved end-to-end data integrity. </p>
<p>- A new automated bug reporting utility that captures the state of 
applications and system service crashes and can aggregate this 
information either centrally on premise or to automatically log 
incidents with Red Hat support.</p>

<h4>Open source collaborative development</h4>
<p>The KVM-based virtualization scalability benefits from work with 
component providers and several peripheral vendors to optimize 
hardware I/O accelerators. 
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 kernel is based on the upstream 2.6.32 
kernel (of which Red Hat is independently recognized as the leading 
contributor).</p>

<p>A Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 example of openness is libvirt - a Red 
Hat initiative delivering a high-level management interface to 
virtualization. This abstraction layer is designed to insulate 
customers from system specific quirks in configuration and management.
Providing choice at the hardware level, Deltacloud provides an 
abstraction layer aimed at insulating customers from lock-in at the 
cloud provider layer. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 contains what will be 
a growing foundation of Deltacloud platform enablers.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">FreeBSD 8.2-BETA1, 7.4-BETA1 Development Releases</h3>

<p>Now available: first beta releases of FreeBSD 8.2 and 7.4, new upcoming
versions in the the production (version 8) and the legacy production
(version 7) series.  The first of the test builds for the 8.2/7.4 release
cycle is available for amd64, i386, ia64, pc98, and sparc64 architectures.
Files suitable for creating installation media or doing FTP-based installs
through the network should be on most of the FreeBSD mirror sites. The ISO
images for this build do not include any packages other than the docs. For
amd64 and i386, 'memstick' images can be copied to a USB 'memory stick' and
used for installs on machines that support booting from that type of
media.</p>

<p>The freebsd-update(8) utility supports binary upgrades of i386 and 
amd64 systems running earlier FreeBSD releases. Systems running 
8.0-RELEASE or 8.1-RELEASE can upgrade simply by running
</p>

<pre>
# freebsd-update upgrade -r 8.2-BETA1
</pre>

<p>Users of earlier FreeBSD releases (FreeBSD 7.x) can also use 
freebsd-update to upgrade to FreeBSD 8.2-BETA1, but will be prompted 
to rebuild all third-party applications (e.g., anything installed from 
the ports tree) after the second invocation of "freebsd-update 
install", in order to handle differences in the system libraries 
between FreeBSD 7.x and FreeBSD 8.x. Substitute "7.4-BETA1" for 
"8.2-BETA1" in the above instructions if you are targeting 7.4-BETA1 
instead.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">MySQL 5.5 Features New Performance and Scalability Enhancements</h3>

<p>Showing its commitment to MySQL users, Oracle announced in December 
the general availability of MySQL 5.5, which delivers significant 
enhancements in performance and the scalability of web applications 
across multiple operating environments, including Linux, Solaris, 
Windows, and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The MySQL 5.5 Community Edition, which is licensed under the GNU 
General Public License (GPL), and is available for free download, 
includes InnoDB as the default storage engine.
This release benefited from substantial user community participation 
and feedback on the MySQL 5.5 Release Candidate, helping to provide a 
more broadly tested product.</p>

<p>With MySQL 5.5, users benefit from:<br />
- Improved performance and scalability: Both the MySQL Database and 
InnoDB storage engine provide optimum performance and scalability on 
the latest multi-CPU and multi-core hardware and operating systems. In 
addition, with release 5.5, InnoDB is now the default storage engine 
for the MySQL Database, delivering ACID transactions, referential 
integrity and crash recovery.<br />
- Higher availability: New semi-synchronous replication and 
Replication Heart Beat improve fail-over speed and reliability.<br />
- Improved usability: Improved index and table partitioning, 
SIGNAL/RESIGNAL support and enhanced diagnostics, including a new 
PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA, improve the manageability of MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>In recent benchmarks, the MySQL 5.5 release candidate delivered 
significant performance improvements compared to MySQL 5.1,  
including:<br />
- On Windows: Up to 1,500 percent performance gains for Read/Write 
operations and up to 500 percent gain for Read Only.<br />
- On Linux: Up to 360 percent performance gain in Read/Write 
operations and up to 200 percent improvement in Read Only.</p>

Dec. 15th: <a href="http://bit.ly/eS99uo">http://bit.ly/eS99uo</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SPARC M-Series Servers with New CPU for Mission-Critical Computing</h3>

<p>Continuing a 20-year partnership in mission-critical computing, Oracle 
and Fujitsu announced in December the enhanced SPARC Enterprise 
M-Series server product line with a new processor SPARC64 VII+. Oracle 
and Fujitsu also unveiled the unified enclosure design of the Oracle 
and Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise M-series servers which are jointly 
designed and manufactured by Oracle and Fujitsu.</p>

<p>The new SPARC64 VII+ processor provides faster memory access and 
increased compute power, including:<br />
- Increased clock speed of up to 3.0 GHz and double the size of the 
L2 cache up to 12MB, delivering up to 20 percent more performance.<br />
- SPARC hardware and Oracle Solaris jointly engineered for maximum 
performance. </p>

<p>The SPARC Enterprise M-series servers with Oracle Solaris provide 
mission-critical reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS) 
for applications that need to be "always on" including:<br />
- Predictive self-healing, component redundancy and hot-swap, memory 
mirroring and fault containment with Dynamic Domains and Solaris 
Containers.<br />
- Extensive combined hardware, operating system and application 
testing to improve reliability and performance of the servers.</p>

<p>The recently announced Oracle Enterprise Manager 11g OpsCenter has new 
SPARC Enterprise M-series-specific management capabilities, including:<br />
- Simplified management for the entire integrated hardware and 
software stack.<br />
- The ability to create, manage, provision and configure Dynamic 
Domains and Solaris Containers, making the SPARC Enterprise M-Series 
servers a better consolidation platform.</p>

<p>The SPARC Enterprise M-Series servers are Oracle and Fujitsu's 
comprehensive line of SPARC Solaris servers, ranging from the 
single-socket M3000 to the 64-socket M9000. This announcement 
completes a full refresh of Oracle and Fujitsu's entire line of SPARC 
servers.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google releases Chrome OS and netbook for Xmas</h3>

<p>In early December, with the announcement of a Chrome 8 browser update 
and  its Chrome-OS beta, Google also opened a pilot program for 
diverse users.  Unlike the social engineering emails of the 1990s that 
falsely lured responders with offers of a Microsoft laptop, there 
really is a Google netbook and many folks got one before the Xmas 
holiday.  </p>

<p>The browser update includes 800 bug fixes, better HTML 5 support, a 
built-in PDF reader,  and integration of graphics acceleration.  At 
its press event at a San Francisco art gallery, engineers displayed a 
3D aquarium app that could be scaled up to thousands of fish with 
correct perspective.  The message was that the Chrome browser offers 
significantly improved performance. In a demo, engineers loaded all 
1990 pages of the recent health care law in seconds and smoothly 
scrolled through it.  Google also said that the new Chrome 8 browser 
would be released for all major platforms, including Linux and Mac.</p>

<p>The star of the event was the much anticipated beta of the Chrome OS. 
This is actually a very stripped down version of Debian Linux 
supporting only the web browsing app. It ties into security hardware, 
like TPMs [trusted programming modules], and is designed to boot in 
seconds. What wasn't expected was the CR-48 beta test platform and the 
fact that these netbooks were shipping immediately.  Even more 
unexpected was the fact that the public was invited to participate in 
the beta by receiving a free CR-48 after applying on-line.</p>

<p>Google is looking for diverse and even unusual web browsing activity 
to collect info on how the Chrome OS handles all web browsing 
requirements.  There may be a preference for users of on-line 
applications and SaaS.  You can apply for the Pilot program here: 
<a href="http://google.com/chromenotebook">http://google.com/chromenotebook</a>.</p>

<p>According to press reports, Google has 60,000 CR-48s on order from 
Taiwanese manufacturer Inventec  and that about 15,000-20,000 had 
arrived by the announcement date.  Some of these were immediately made 
available to trade press and technical publications, as well as Google 
staff.  </p>

<p>The CR-48 is a cool black Linux netbook with running a tightly coupled 
version of the Chrome Browser. Its a web machine, designed as a web 
top without the option of a desktop - unless you put it in the secret 
developer mode where the underlying Linux OS is available for testing 
or hacking. It is designed to live in the Cloud, storing only some 
user info and preferences locally.</p>

<p>Google has called it a laptop, mostly due to its 12 inch display and 
full size key pad.  But it weighs in at just under 4 pounds with 2 GB 
of RAM and an N455 Atom processor.   Many newer netbooks already use 
the dual core 500 series of Atom CPUs, but the real performance hit is 
in the slow links to the graphics sub-system.  AMD has recently 
released a dual-core Atom-class processor with an integrated graphics 
core and such a chip should greatly outperform the current Atom family 
in the rendering and multi-media area. (see the Product section below).</p>

<p>The low power Atom CPU and Mac-like Lithium polymer battery yield a 
claimed 8 hours of use and 8 days of standby. (Our experience at LG 
with a test machine was more like 6 hours plus and about 6 days of 
standby, but the battery may have been short of a full charge.) The 
CR-48 looks like an older 13 inch MacBook and is frequently mistaken 
for one.</p>

<p>The Google netbook supports WiFi, Bluetooth, and a 3G cellular adapter 
with 100 MB/month Verizon service for free as a standby when WiFi is 
not available.  Larger data plans are available from Verizon starting 
at $10 per month. </p>

<p>These specifications should be expected when Chrome OS powered devices 
from Acer and Samsung start making their debut some time next year. It 
is also very likely that we will begin to see demo's of such devices 
during CES in January.</p>

<p>Some press reports note the over-sized touchpad is over-sensitive and 
the Adobe Flash plug-in for Linux has had awful performance, but both 
Adobe and Google engineers are working on it.</p>

<p>To see what's inside the CR-48, go here:
<a href="http://chromeossite.com/2010/12/11/google-cr-48-notebook-dissected-pictures/">http://chromeossite.com/2010/12/11/google-cr-48-notebook-dissected-pictures/</a>.</p>

<p>There is also an open source project and community around the code 
base, <a href="http://chromiumOS.org">http://chromiumOS.org</a>.</p>

<p>From the FAQ page: "Chromium OS is the open source project, used 
primarily by developers, with code that is available for anyone to 
checkout, modify and build their own version with. Meanwhile, Google 
Chrome OS is the Google product that OEMs will ship on Netbooks this

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">AMD Gears up for its Fusion Family of APUs</h3>
 
<p>In December, AMD announced a new lineup of motherboard products for 
AMD's 2011 low-power mobile platform (code-named "Brazos") and the AMD 
Embedded G-Series platform for embedded systems (code-named 
"eBrazos"), both based on the first AMD Fusion Accelerated Processing 
Units (APUs). The 2011 low-power mobile platforms feature the new 
18-watt AMD E-Series APU (code-named "Zacate") or the 9-watt AMD 
C-Series APU (code-named "Ontario").</p>
 
<p>"AMD is ushering in a new era of personal computing, and our industry 
partners are ready to take advantage of the first ever AMD Fusion 
APU," said Chris Cloran, Corp. VP and GM, Computing Solutions Group, 
Client Division, AMD. "By combining the processing of the CPU with the 
GPU on a single energy efficient chip, we believe their customers can 
take advantage of better price/performance, superior 1080p HD playback 
and small form factors for innovative designs."</p>
 
<p>During Intel's Developer Forum, AMD held preview sessions showing 
low-power Zacate netbook chips matching or besting a 35-watt 
commercial laptop running an Intel Core I-5 CPU and standard Intel 
GPU.  In a recent Taiwan computer fair, MSI showed off an 11.6 inch 
netbook that will shown at CES that is based on the Zacated APU with 4 
GBs of RAM.</p>
 
<p>Numerous motherboard designs based on the AMD E-Series APU are planned 
for retail channels and system builders from leading original design 
manufacturers (ODMs), including ASUS, GIGABYTE, MSI and SAPPHIRE. 
Additional motherboard designs based on the AMD Embedded G- Series 
platform for embedded systems are scheduled for Q1 2011 availability 
to enable the next generation of embedded computing devices from 
digital signage and medical imaging to casino gaming machines and 
point-of-sale kiosks.</p>
 
<p>"With the new AMD E-Series APU, we can provide our customers the 
cost-effective solutions they're looking for to build PCs with 
unrivalled image quality," said Joe Hsieh, Vice President of ASUS. 
"Our AMD E-Series APU-based motherboards redefine the low-power, small 
PC experience to go beyond basic Internet browsing for today's digital 
lifestyle."</p>
