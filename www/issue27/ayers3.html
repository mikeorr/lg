<center><h1>WordNet: A Fast and Flexible Word Database</h1></center>

<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>There have been times when I've wished I had dictionary program with a
Linux interface.  One of my favorite print dictionaries is the American
Heritage Dictionary, which I've used and appreciated for many years. 
<a href="http://www.dux.com/ahdictux.html">Dux Software</a> 
has been offering a Linux version of their computer interface to the
dictionary (combined with a thesaurus) for some time now, but I was deterred
by the $49.95 price-tag, considering the existence of a perfectly usable print
copy of the book, sitting on a shelf not six feet from where I'm typing this.
But there are powers which the computer-based dictionary possesses which can
be quite useful.  A computer excels at searching for information in a
database, and combined with the power of regular expressions a digital
dictionary has significant advantages.

<p>The only free digital dictionary I've come across was an old edition of
Webster's, available from Project Gutenberg in the form of two large text
files.  These could be searched for a word with <em>grep</em>, but I was
looking for something with an X interface; <em>grep</em> would also find
instances of words used within a definition, which would clutter up the
output.  Of course there are on-line WWW dictionaries, which are fine for
people who are on-line most of the time.  Users accessing the net via a
dial-up connection with an ISP are unlikely to be online while writing text
for which a dictionary would be needful.  I happened across a usenet posting
recently which led me to to this <a
href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">site</a>, and before long I was
downloading a 13 mb. archive containing a dictionary/thesaurus called WordNet.

<center><h3>WordNet Basics</h3></center>

<p>The usenet announcement of the most recent WordNet release contained a
good description of the package:<br>

<blockquote>
WordNet is a powerful lexical reference system that combines aspects of
dictionaries and thesauri with current psycholinguistic theories of human
lexical memory. It is produced by the Cognitive Science Laboratory at
Princeton University, under the direction of Professor George Miller. In
WordNet, words are defined and grouped into various related sets of
synonyms. Not only is the system valuable to the casual user as a powerful
thesaurus and dictionary, but also to the researcher as one of the few
freely available, lexical databases. WordNet is available via an on-line
interface and also as easy-to-compile C source code for Unix.
</blockquote>

<p>WordNet consists of interlinked databases of words, synonyms, antonyms,
and usage examples.  In the best unix tradition, this data can be manually
accessed via the command-line.  This makes it relatively easy to create
script-based interfaces which can simplify the usage of the tool and provide a 
windowed, menu-driven front-end.  The distribution contains the source code
for the basic utilities and a Tcl/Tk interface, as well as statically linked
binaries and the database files.

<p>One difference between WordNet and a traditional dictionary is the lack of
etymologies, a feature typically used much less often than the simple display
of meaning and syntax.  The inclusion of thesaurus-like features more than
makes up for this lack.  

<p>A full WordNet installation, consisting of the data-files and the
command-line and statically-linked executables, occupies more than thirty
megabytes of disk space.  This is an ideal job for the
<a href="http://www.netspace.net.au/~reiter/e2compr">e2compr</a>
kernel-level transparent file-compression system; I compressed the database
directory and reduced it from thirty megabytes to eleven and one-half, with no
noticeable speed penalty.  See LG #18 (June 1997) for an introduction to
<b>e2compr</b>.

<center><h3>Examples</h3></center>

<p>Here are a few examples of command-line use of WordNet:<br>

<p><kbd><pre>%->wn gazette -over
Overview of noun gazette

The noun gazette has 1 sense (no senses from tagged texts)

1. gazette -- (a newspaper)

Overview of verb gazette

The verb gazette has 1 sense (no senses from tagged texts)
                                       
1. gazette -- (publish in a gazette)</pre></kbd>

<p><b>wn</b> is the command-line search tool, and the switch <b>-over</b>
shows an overview of meaning and parts of speech the word can have.

<p><kbd><pre>%->wn gaz -grepn

Grep of noun gaz
gaza strip
gazania
gazania rigens
gaze
gazebo
gazella
gazella subgutturosa
gazella thomsoni
gazelle
gazelle hound
gazette
gazetteer
</pre></kbd>

<p>The switch <b>-grepn</b> searches the noun database for any noun containing
the string <i>gaz</i>; there are variants of this switch: <b>-grepv</b>,
<b>-grepa</b>, and <b>-grepr</b>, which respectively search for verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs.  The various <b>grep</b> switches can be used to
determine the correct spelling of a word when you are certain of the spelling
of only a syllable or portion of the word.

<p><pre><kbd>
%->wn quell -framv

Sample Sentences of verb quell

2 senses of quell                                                       

Sense 1
squelch, quell
          *> Somebody ----s something

Sense 2
quell, stay, appease
          *> Something ----s
          *> Something ----s somebody
</kbd></pre>

<p>The <b>-framv</b> switch used above shows how the word is used in
sentences. 

<p><pre><kbd>
%->wn quell -simsv

Synonyms (Grouped by Similarity of Meaning) of verb quell

Sense 1
squelch, quell
       => suppress, stamp down, inhibit, subdue, conquer, curb
--------------

Sense 2
quell, stay, appease
       => meet, satisfy, fill, fulfill
--------------
</kbd></pre>

<p>The <b>-simsv</b> switch shows verb synonyms, and a variant <b>-simsn</b>
lists the noun synonyms of a word.There are a plethora of other <b>wn</b>
switches for finding antonyms, homonyms, and several other more obscure
lexical types, many of which have easier-to-use equivalents in the Tcl/Tk
windowed interface, <b>wnb</b>, which stands for WordNet Browser.

<center><h3>Using The Browser</h3></center>

<p>Here are screenshots of the browser window and a subsidiary sub-string
window, which takes the place of the <b>-grep[nvar]</b> switches used with
<b>wn</b>.<br>

<p><img alt="Main wnb window" src="./gx/ayers/wnb.gif">

<p><img alt="Substring (grep) window" src="./gx/ayers/grep.gif">

<p>This is a convenient and easy-to-use interface, with all functions
available from the menus.  The output, though, isn't wrapped to fit the
screen, so to avoid having to scroll sideways to see it all the window should
be resized so that it is wider horizontally.  You might be tempted (as I was)
to try compiling the source code, so that the <b>wnb</b> executable will use
your own Tcl/Tk libraries rather than the bulky statically-linked
libraries compiled into the supplied executable file.  Unless you happen to
have the particular patch-level of Tcl-7.6 and Tk-4.2 which the source needs,
it probably won't compile (at least it wouldn't for me).  If the <b>wnb</b>
interface was just a Tk script, it wouldn't be a big job to modify it so that
it uses a particular Tcl/Tk installation, but <b>wnb</b> has its own
specialized wish interpreter, which complicates updating the source for a
newer version of Tcl/Tk.  Since the supplied Tcl/Tk interface is just a
convenient way of viewing the output from <b>wn</b>, perhaps a GTK, Qt, or
Emacs-LISP interface could be coded; this would make a welcome addition to the
KDE and GNOME projects.  I've found that a handy way to run <b>wn</b> is in a
separate wide-and-short XEmacs shell-buffer frame.

<center><h3>Documentation and License Issues</h3></center>

<p>The documentation supplied with the distribution is complete and clearly
written; it's all an end-user should need.  HTML, Postscript, and man-page
formats are included to cater to various reading preferences.  If you are
curious about the psycholinguistic theoretical underpinnings of the project, a 
Postscript file (5papers.ps) is available from the web-site.

<p>While writing this article I happened to be paging through the introductory
essays in the American Heritage dictionary.  One of these essays was written
by one of the linguists responsible for the work which inspired the WordNet
project, Henry Kucera.  It's called <cite>Computers in Language Analysis and
Lexicography</cite>, and it's a more general (though dated) overview of
psycholinguistics than the above mentioned collection of papers.  If you're
wondering just what in the world the "Browne Corpus" is (mentioned on the
WordNet web-site), this essay explains it clearly.

<p>WordNet isn't licensed under the GPL, but the license isn't very
restrictive at all.  The utilities and programs needed to create the word
databases are not distributed, but the supplied files are sufficient for most
needs.

<center><h3>FTP Sites</h3></center>

<p>WordNet can be obtained from its home
<a href="ftp://ftp.cogsci.princeton.edu/pub/wordnet">site</a>, but this is a
really slow site, and I had better luck obtaining the archive from this
<a href="ftp://ftp.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/pub/WordNet">mirror</a> site in
Germany.  As useful as this package is, it really should be mirrored
elsewhere as well.
