<h1>The Open Source Hook</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/ruecker.html">Scott Ruecker</a></b></p>

<p>
Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with several KDE developers.
Benjamin Reed, Jaroslaw Staniek, and Ralf Habacker are three of the many
talented developers working on porting KDE to Mac OS/X and Windows.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<em>Can you tell me about the technical design of the Mac and
Windows ports?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> KDE/Windows should really be considered as 
"KDElibs/Windows and some KDE applications on Windows".
Porting applications to KDE/Windows typically just means making KDE
libraries and the build system more "portable". The source
code of the applications is largely the same. As an example, I can
mention that Kexi's source code, which I develop on Windows, is often
committed to SVN without prior checking on other platforms. Then, I
just update another copy of the same source code from SVN on Linux,
and recompile. There are few, if any, and easily fixable problems with
this method, usually related to difference between compilers. You get
the idea; this is how portable development works.
</p>

<p>
There is one assumption many of the developers agree on: we re-use
as much of the native interface as possible. However, we do not
perform any forks that would make ported applications non-standard
in terms of file formats or protocols. I personally tend to give up
on a given functionality (and look for a replacement) rather than go
with using a proprietary technology. A small example of this is my
use of the 'mdbtools' project to access the MS Access file
format, instead of using native Windows DAO/ADO API. This is not even
a matter of licensing (because many APIs are considered 
"system-level" technology), but more about a strategy. Other
examples of re-using lower-level layers are multimedia frameworks. An
example of an existing facility that should not be replaced in a 
typical installation is the explorer.exe desktop shell.
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin:</b> For the OS/X port, right now there is
no specific "technical design" beyond what KDE provides in
general, and as far as the technical challenges involved, there is
not a lot going forward that isn't a general challenge to the KDE
codebase. I know that's not much of an answer, so I need to back up a
little into the history of it.
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, Sam Magnuson (a Trolltech employee) did a bunch
of work to rip out the X11-related code in the KDE3 codebase and got
it to compile against Qt/Mac 3.x. I picked up where he left off, and
did a lot of work trying to clean up the patches, make it look a
little nicer, etc. Around the same time, the Windows folks had
started working on cleaning things up on their side. Time went by,
and the Mac port stagnated, mostly because I'm not really much of a
C++ coder, and I'd hit the limit of what I was able to do on my own.
No one else really had the time to work on it with me (although there
was certainly still a lot of interest.) Most of my porting time went
into maintaining other Fink packages, and keeping the Fink KDE/X11
port up-to-date and working smoothly. In that time, the Windows folks
did a lot of <strong>awesome</strong> work on committing bits of my and Sam
Magnuson's work, along with a ton of their own, cleaning up the code,
removing X11-isms, etc.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to KDE4, I talked with various folks in #kde-devel,
off and on, about wanting to pick up the Mac port again, and about the
feasibility of really making a go at it.  One of the things that
really made the port possible was the move to Qt4, and a real
dedication on the part of the KDE core folks to try to use official
Qt APIs for things that had been hacked-around at the X11 level in
KDE3 (and a commitment from Trolltech to add proper APIs for things
that required hacks before.) In addition, there were a lot of awful
hacks that needed to be done to
the existing autotools-based build system (automake, autoconf,
libtool) to make things even build on OS/X against frameworks. 

</p>

<p>
The move to the SCons build system made building on Mac feasible,
and the subsequent switch to CMake made it easy: CMake has had a very
large role in making it simple (and sane) to make KDE GUI and console
applications cross-platform without a lot of work on the developers'
part. Mac OS/X has a lot of quirks at the compiler and linker level
that make it hard to understand building (especially dynamic-loading)
if you come only from a Linux point of view. CMake makes that
completely transparent. A lot of the ease of porting now comes from
Alexander Neundorf's awesome work getting KDE to build with CMake.
</p>

<p>
So, to make a long story short, there used to be a lot of
technical code hurdles to getting KDE to build on non-X11, but many
of those were hashed out late in the 3.5 cycle, and early in the 4.0
cycle, thanks to the work of a lot of talented and dedicated people.
At this point, there are only a few small platform-related issues for
the Mac port, and the rest is really just a matter of keeping up with
KDE4 development and fixing small problems before they snowball into
big ones.
</p>

<p>
<em>What were some of the technical challenges facing the
developers?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> The integration with facilities
existing on the target platform and the look and feel.
</p>

<p>
There is some probability that in special cases platform-dependent
looks will be configured. Think about toolbars on Mac and Windows, as
well as features related to window management (full screen, etc.)
Thanks to our API, KDElibs tend to provide well-defined helpers that
behave appropriately for every given environment. Many of these
facilities are also delivered by Qt - namely, the accessibility API -
so KDE developers can focus on preparing higher-level facilities.
</p>

<p>
<em>What were some of the technical requirements for building
KDE on Windows?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> On Windows, many dependencies are not
considered as "system" libraries, so these are delivered
within the so-called KDE development environment. The environment is
needed only for developers, not users. The general rule here is that
we try to have the environment as self-contained as possible, to make
new developers' lives easier. There are two main compilers used on
Windows: 'gcc' and MS Visual C++, aka 'msvc'. Since C++ does not define
de-facto binary compatibility between compiles from various vendors,
when distributing binaries, both targets will be (probably)
distributed together.
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> <a
href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a> is used as a
high-level build system for KDE4, on top of compilers and particular
environments. This is a positive change, since for KDE3/Windows Qt's
'qmake' was used, without any chances for using advanced and automated
configuration checks. Now, for instance, if you need MySQL support
in your application, it is possible to declare this fact once in your
CMake build file, and the build system will try to find all
the needed facilities for this requirement.
</p>

<p>
KDE's relationships with Trolltech is well known. In version 4,
KDE is even more a place where community and companies meet for
mutual benefit. CMake is an advanced buildsystem delivered by Kitware,
Inc. and <a
href="http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Sponsors.html">others</a>.
In fact, it's not only delivered as-is but there are also CMake
releases with many features needed, especially with a large project like
KDE.
</p>

<p>
<em>Were there any special requirements for Mac OS/X?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Benjamin:</b> For Mac OS/X, nothing all that special
other than XCode (Apple's GCC compiler set). KDE has a lot of
dependencies to get the most out of it, so if you don't want to spend
days compiling libpng, dbus, etc., then you probably want to install
my Qt4 and "kdesupport" packages on the Web site. I provide
pre-made packages, which include headers and dev libraries, so that you
can pretty much just jump in compiling KDE SVN if you'd like.
</p>

<p>
<em>What is the distribution strategy?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> On Windows, there is an installer that
installs the development environment. In the end, there will be a
choice between installing just the runtime for users and
runtime+development files for developers. You can get more information
at <a href="http://lists.kde.org/?t=116778440900002&amp;r=1&amp;w=2">KDE
Lists</a>.  </p>

<p>
On Mac OS/X, right now I'm putting together Apple Installer packages,
with everything self-contained in '/opt' to avoid getting in the way of
other software. Eventually, my goal is to also provide KDE4 through
Fink, but I'm not going to bother doing so until we get closer to a beta
quality, at the least, but even so I will probably continue creating the
installer packages. I have it pretty much automated, and it provides a
really easy way to just drop a running KDE4 setup on a system without
any external dependencies.  </p>

<p>
<em>What are the timeline, support options, and future
development going forward?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Jaroslaw:</b> The timeline for the KDE/Windows target
is dependent on KDE4's plans. In general, porting efforts and updates
provided try to follow the mainstream development, i.e., the one for
Unix target. There are already people (including me) interested in
commercial development using the development facilities of KDE on
Windows. There is the KDE ISV subproject in development. There is no
doubt the user base is growing, and we now have an active community
around this target, which helps the KDE Project in general.
</p>

<p>
The design covers two steps:
</p>

<p>
1. KDE on Windows uses current code and similar packaging as on
Unix and to have KDE applications as they are, with a minimum of
required porting effort. This is to show people how it works and to
get Windows in contact with KDE applications. In this step, the basic
differences between Unix and Windows must be fixed (fork/exec and
Unix domain sockets not available on Windows, no undefined symbols in
shared libraries possible, different file path syntax, etc.)
</p>

<p>
2. When enough developers are available, they could make partial
redesigns of KDE internals to use specific Windows features like
named pipes for faster IPC, or be able to have standalone applications -
for example, Konqueror or Kontact/Kmail - not require many additional 
background processes running, as is the case now. I can imagine having a
redesigned klauncher, kded and kioslaves included into a standalone
application; the latter may be using threads or something similar.
Jaruslav has gone already this way with Kexi.  </p>

<p>
<em>Are there more features and ideas in the works?</em>
</p>

<p>
<b>Ralf Habacker:</b> The current implementation of
KDE is designed in a Unix-specific way, which is partially different
from the Windows way. Examples for this are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Process creation uses the Unix way (fork and exec).
It isn't available on Windows, so this difference requires a
redesign of the related parts.
<li> It's missing Windows API counterparts.
<li> KDE uses Unix domain sockets for high-speed data transfer between
the kioslave slaves and their parent processes, and for the communication
to/from the dbus daemon. On Windows, there are no Unix domain sockets.
They could be emulated by TCP sockets, at the cost of lower
bandwidth and additional patches to deal with Unix domain socket
files exchanged between processes.
</ul>

<p>
There are different application interfaces. Windows, for example,
has a TCP socket stack similar to the Unix one, but it differs in
some areas, which makes porting harder. Windows named pipes have a
completely different API, which required a partial redesign of KDE
code.
</p>

<p>
After Qt4/GPL was released, our next step was clear: build a
native kdelibs4 on Windows. The main problem is that we're too few
people with too much work (starting with a native dbus implementation,
and ending with a working KDE app on Windows, to show others that we are
really moving forward). Because of this, I'm happy for any publicity
to get new developers, which could help because we're all doing this
in our spare time.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Some of the developers working on the Windows port are Peter
K&uuml;mmel, Holger Schr&ouml;der and Christian Ehrlicher.  On the
Mac side, there are Derek Ditch, Alexander Neuendorf, Marijn
Kruisselbrink and Tanner Lovelace, just to name a few. There are many
more who have contributed in the past that were integral in making
these projects a success. All the hard work they have done will have
the cumulative effect of exponentially increasing the number of
people who get exposed to and use Open Source Software.
</p>

<p>
I believe that KDE porting their Desktop Environment to Mac OS/X and
Windows to be a watershed moment for Open Source Software. By and
large, people are resistant to change, and in all my interactions with
strangers, friends, and family, I have learned creative ways to
describe what using Linux is like, or how to run it from a liveCD or
how to install it on a PC. I have learned to stay away from the word
"<em>change</em>", and use the word "<strong>add</strong>" instead.
</p>

<p>
It is much easier to convince someone to try Open Source Software
if you describe it as "adding" something to his/her computer,
rather than "changing" it. Many who read this do not look
at "changing" a computer with apprehension or fear, but we are not
in the majority. If "adding" KDE to a Mac or Windows
machine gets millions of people who otherwise would not try OSS,
then so be it. I am convinced that once a person tries OSS, he/she will
get hooked on it. It is easier than starting smoking. <img
src="../gx/smile.png" alt=";-)" />
</p>

<p>
From the day I first downloaded Firefox, my addiction and/or love
affair with OSS has flourished unabated. It started with Firefox and
progressed into using only FOSS within two years. Why? Because I
<strong>chose</strong> to. After using it every day and comparing
it to proprietary software, it was a "no-brainer" to switch
to Open Source Software entirely. There was no loss in quality of
applications, security, and functionality on my machine. There was a
significant increase in the quality and choice of applications I
could use, and by switching to Linux, my computer became a bank vault
compared to whatever it was running Windows. How did all this happen?
I started using <strong>one</strong> program, got hooked, and never
looked back.
</p>

<p>
Soon, everyone who owns a computer will be able to try and use OSS,
and all they will have to do is "add" software to their
computer. That shouldn't be too hard; people add software to their
computers every day, right? So, lets say that 25 to 50 million people
who had never tried OSS before, try it because all they have to do is
"add" some software to their computers. Those of you who
have surfed before will know what I mean when I say this: you're lying
on your board and you look out into the ocean and see a bulge in the
water and you think to yourself "Is that the next big wave
coming in?" The answer is yes - this is indeed the next big wave coming
in.
