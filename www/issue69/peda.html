  WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="92" ALIGN="left">

By now I'm sure many of you my have the impression that unless you know
Java, your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is severely handicapped, and even if
you are fluent in Java, increasingly employers will ask if you know Java
Server Pages (JSPs), and/or servlets.  Fortunately, there is a free
application server for Java Server Pages, and the related Java
Servlets, it is called called Jakarta-Tomcat (hereafter referred to
simply as Tomcat). I decided to download and install it, documenting
my experiences for reference.  I set up  Tomcat on a vintage Pentium
2/200 running SuSE 7.2, however it appears that the steps described
here should work with any recent distribution, as long as Java can
compile the source.  
<p>

Installation of the applet server involves the downloading and
compilation of several packages in addition to the obvious need for
Java and Tomcat.  The following packages are necessary:
<p>
<table CLASS="listing">
<caption>Required Packages to Set Up Jakarta-Tomcat</caption>
<tr><th>Package</th><th>Source  &nbsp;</th></tr>
<tr><td>Java SDK 1.3.1          &nbsp;</td>
         <td><a href="#java_download">Sun</a> &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>XML Parser Library 1.1  &nbsp;</td>
         <td><a href="#java_xml">Sun</a> &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Secure Sockets for Java 1.0.2 &nbsp;</td>
         <td><a href="#java_sse">Sun</a> &nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Java Servlet API 3.2.3  &nbsp;</td>
         <td><a href="#jakarta_download">Apache Foundation</a> &nbsp;</td> </tr>
<tr><td>Jakarta Ant 1.3         &nbsp;</td>
         <td><a href="#jakarta_download">Apache Foundation</a> &nbsp;</td> </tr>
<tr><td>Jakarta Tomcat 3.2.3    &nbsp;</td>
         <td><a href="#jakarta_download">Apache Foundation</a> &nbsp;</td> </tr>
</table><p>

<p>
<h2>Getting Java Installed</h2><p>
Installation of Java has been written up so frequently it's almost
not worth repeating here, however for completeness I'll quickly run through the
steps using RPM.  I downloaded version 1.3 of the SDK (also known as
the JDK) from the <a href="#java_download">Java web site</a>, 
but 1.4 is in Beta, and may be out by the time you read this. The
notes for the Secure Sockets library indicate that 1.4 will include
them, so the installation will be simplified somewhat.
<p>

For Linux, Sun's Java comes as a script wrapped around an RPM package,
so that you must execute it and agree to the licensing before you get
to actually install the RPM.&nbsp; After unpacking the shell script to
yield an RPM, follow the standard installation as root.

<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>RPM install for Java (after unpacking)</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:~ &gt; sudo rpm -Uv jdk-1.3.1.i386.rpm
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

I modified my path to include the location of the JDK, on SuSE you are
advised to edit /etc/profile.local to accomplish this, although on
other distributions one might edit /etc/profile directly. Note also the
environmental variable for $JAKARTA_HOME, and $TOMCAT_HOME, we can
ignore them for now, but you will need them soon enough as part of the
installation procedure, so it's easier to set them now. Note that I
did not initially set CLASSPATH, although you may want or need to.
You'll see below the steps I took to make sure that Java could find
the libraries. 

<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode"  WIDTH="100%">
<caption>Environmental Variables Needed</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    #!/bin/bash
    JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.3.1
    JAKARTA_HOME=/opt/jakarta
    ANT_HOME=$JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-ant
    TOMCAT_HOME=$JAKARTA_HOME/build/tomcat
    PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

    export JAVA_HOME JAKARTA_HOME ANT_HOME PATH TOMCAT_HOME
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<h2>Installing the Java XML Parser Library</h2>
I installed the libraries for XML parsing by unzipping and copying the
required libs to the library extensions directory (as root).  I
originally unzipped this file into my home directory.  Where the files
are initially unzipped doesn't matter, as long as java can find the
installed libraries.<p> 

<table CLASS="sourcecode"  WIDTH="100%">
<caption>Copying the XML Parser Library jar files</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    unzip jaxp-1_1.zip; cd jaxp-1.1
    moby:~/jaxp-1.1 > sudo cp *.jar $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Now, I like to do things step by step, so to check that your setup is 
able to find these new libraries, I suggest running an example
program, which is included in the XML parser library.
<br>
If your Java Virtual Machine (JVM) cannot find the libraries, you will
get an error like this:
<p>
<table CLASS="errormsg">
<caption>Error Message</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:~/jaxp-1.1/examples/trax &gt; java Examples
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: 
    javax/xml/transform/TransformerException
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

If you see something like this, check the library locations (.jar
files).  I constantly ran into this problem, and I solved it by
copying symlinking them to the correct location, or modifying
$CLASSPATH. 

<h2>Installing the Secure Sockets Library</h2>
<p>You follow a similar procedure to install the Secure
Sockets library copying the .jar libraries into the extensions directory.
<p>

<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>Secure Sockets Library</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:~/jsse1.0.2/lib &gt; sudo cp *.jar $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
I then edited the file
/usr/java/jdk1.3.1/jre/lib/security/java.security to contain an entry
for "com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol" which was not in the
default file.
<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>Java Security Entry for SSL</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    security.provider.1=sun.security.provider.Sun
    security.provider.2=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.ssl.Provider
    security.provider.3=com.sun.rsajca.Provider
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

Now, to test that javac could find these libs, I quickly typed up
compiled the following piece of code, saved it as TestSSL.java and
compiled it:
<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>Testing Secure Sockets</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    import javax.net.ssl.*;
    
    public class TestSSL {
	public static
	    void main(String [] arstring) {
	    try  {
		new java.net.URL("https://" + arstring[0] + "/").getContent();
	    } catch (Exception exception) {
		exception.printStackTrace();
	    }
	}
    }
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
We compile to bytecode Using the standard javac invocation:
<pre>
      moby:~/jsse1.0.2 &gt; javac TestSSL.java
</pre>
Once again, if java could not find the libray, then I would get a
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError error, and the code would not compile
to yield the TestSSL.class bytecode file.<p>

After compiling with javac to bytecode, I wanted to test the ssl library by
connecting to an SSL site (sourceforge).  Here it is necessary to 
specify the use of SSL on the command line, or as Sun's install docs say,
"add the handler's implementation package name to the list of packages
which are searched by the Java URL class".  I think of this as
analogous to linking the math library  using -lm as a linker option
to gcc, except it's done at runtime.

<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>Explicitly Specifying the Handler</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>
    
    moby:~/jsse1.0.2 &gt; java \
    -Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol \
    TestSSL sourceforge.net
    moby:~/jsse1.0.2 &gt; echo $?
    moby:~/jsse1.0.2 &gt; 0
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<br>	
As an aside, if I did not include this argument to the JVM, I would
get the following error:<p>

<table CLASS="errormsg">
<caption>Unknown Protocol Error Message</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:~/jsse1.0.2 &gt; java TestSSL sourceforge.net
    java.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: https
	    at java.net.URL.&lt;init&gt;(URL.java:480)
	    at java.net.URL.&lt;init&gt;(URL.java:376)
	    at java.net.URL.&lt;init&gt;(URL.java:330)
	    at TestSSL.main(TestSSL.java:8)
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

So now we have Apache, Java, Java libraries for XML and Secure
Sockets, and we can install Jakarta-Tomcat.  Not quite yet, we
still need Ant, a Java "make" replacement, and the Servlet API.

<h2>Installing Ant</h2>

Despite the fact that we not quite ready to install the Jakarta-Tomcat
distribution, the next step does involve installing some essential
components of Jakarta, so we need to modify our environment to
accommodate the package. We do this by creating the environmental variable 
$JAKARTA_HOME which was briefly introduced with the $JAVA_HOME
variable.  I decided to put Jakarta under /opt, simply because
there was space there, and also I try to put anything I build under
/opt, leaving /usr and /usr/local for the distribution RPM to
decide. Now we are getting to First, think of a place where you want
to install Ant.<p>

First download and unpack it.  In my example I downloaded the
compressed source into my home directory, then changed to the 
$JAKARTA_HOME directory.  I then unpacked it into the $JAKARTA_HOME
directory, letting tar choose the directory name.<p>

In order to comply with the requirement that jakarta-ant be in a
directory called $JAKARTA_HOME/jakarta-ant I symlinked the build
directory to the correct directory name. Then I cd'd into the
jakarta-ant/ directory and ran the bootstrap.sh script as root. 
After you run this script, there should be a new build/lib/
subdirectory containing the libraries just built:

<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>Building Jakarta - Ant</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:~ &gt; cd $JAKARTA_HOME
    moby:~/opt/jakarta&gt; tar xzf ~/jakarta-ant-1.3-src.tar.gz
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo ln -s jakarta-ant-1.3/ jakarta-ant
    moby:~/opt/jakarta &gt; cd jakarta-ant
    moby:/opt/jakarta/jakarta-ant &gt; sudo sh bootstrap.sh    
    moby:/opt/jakarta/jakarta-ant > ls -1 build/lib/
    ant.jar
    optional.jar
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

<a href="misc/peda/bootstrap_ant.txt">Output of the Ant bootstrap
script</a><p>

<h2>Installing the Servlet API</h2>
Next we install the servlet API, once again symlinking the real
extract directory to the required directory name:

<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>Building the Servlet API</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo tar xvzf \
    &gt; ~/jakarta-servletapi-3.2.3-src.tar.gz 
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo ln -s jakarta-servletapi \
    &gt; jakarta-servletapi-3.2.3-src
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; cd jakarta-servletapi
    moby:/opt/jakarta/jakarta-servletapi &gt;
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
I was ready to build the jakarta servlet libraries, using the
build.sh script supplied.  But it was at this point I had to "cheat"
in order to resolve two library related errors: 

<p>
<table CLASS="errormsg">
<caption>Error messages due to libraries not being found</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:/opt/jakarta/jakarta-servletapi &gt; sudo sh build.sh dist
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:
    org/apache/tools/ant/Main

    /opt/jakarta/jakarta-servletapi-3.2.3-src/build.xml:31: Cannot use
    classic compiler, as it is not available A common solution is to set
    the environment variable JAVA_HOME to your jdk directory.
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

The error messages <i>look</i> different, but are really both related
to libraries not being found.  The first is related to ant.jar, the
second is due to a "lost" tools.jar library. To solve these problems I
created two symlinks under $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext to allow Java to 
find the newly created ant.jar and tools.jar libraries.<br> 

<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>Symlinks set to allow Java to find "lost" Libraries</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext/ant.jar -&gt; /opt/jakarta/jakarta-ant/build/lib/ant.jar
    $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext/tools.jar -> /usr/java/jdk1.3.1/lib/tools.jar
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

Alternately I know of two other options that <i>should</i> work (but
did not for me):<p> 
<ol>
    <li>modify the $CLASSPATH environmental variable to include tools.jar
    and ant.jar explicitly.<br>
    <TT>export
    CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar:$ANT_HOME/lib/ant.jar</TT>
    <br><em>or</em>
    <li>
    Explicitly specify the "-classpath" option when calling
    java. This is probably impractical for any large run script.
</ol>
<br>

After creating these symlinks, the following command ran perfectly:
<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode">
<caption>Building Tomcat</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:/opt/jakarta/jakarta-servletapi > sudo sh build.sh dist
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
<a href="misc/peda/build_servlet_api.txt">Here is the output of servlet build
script</a><p>

<h2>Building Tomcat</h2>
Finally, the moment of truth, building the Jakarta-Tomcat package.  I
still had one error, 
<p>
<table CLASS="errormsg">
<caption>Error messages due to bin directory not being found</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:/opt/jakarta/jakarta-tomcat > sudo sh ./build.sh dist

    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The error message, unlike most, is obvious. After symlinking the bin
directory in jakarta-ant, it ran perfectly. 
<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode">

<p>

Congratulations!  After running the startup script, you can view the
greeting screen by pointing your browser at the web server's machine,
port 8080, unless modified.<p>
<img src="misc/peda/tomcat_works.png" 
alt="Screencap of the Tomcat Demo Webserver Running" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="587">
<p>
Jumping to the various pages supplied you can then check out the
screen shots of the example <a href="misc/peda/servlet_examples.html">Servlets</a> 
and <a href="misc/peda/jsp_samples.html">Java Server Pages</a>. This
is a bit of a tease, because you are tempted to try to run the demos
from the screencaps, but still it's nice to see what you can expect
when you actually get Jakarta Tomcat Running. 
<p>

<h2>It works!</h2>
At this point you have two servers running: a simple web server
listening on port 8080, and a servlet container application server
listening on port 8007. The first thing I am concerned with is the
fact that everything was set up as root.  Supporting documentation
suggests running the server as "nobody", but I felt that a special
jakarta user analogous to a database user would be a good idea because of
the special environmental variables that are set.  Having a dedicated
jakarta user just for servlets would then allow configuration to be kept in
the ~jakarta home directory.  This would be even more useful if there
were other versions of java installed on the system.
<p>

Anyhow this is all fairly simple.  After the jakarta user is set up as
shown, you can run jakarta as that user, and since it runs from a
nonpriviliged port there should be no problem there.  Still I thought
that the permissions could be tightened up more so that only the jakarta
user can run the servlet container, so I shutdown the server, and
changed the permissions as follows:<p> 

<p>
<table CLASS="sourcecode" >
<caption>Tightening Up Permissions</caption>
<tr><td>
    <pre>

    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo $TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh 
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd jakarta
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo /usr/sbin/useradd -g jakarta -c \
    &gt; "Java Server Pages" jakarta
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo mkdir /home/jakarta
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo chown jakarta.jakarta /home/jakarta
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo chown -R jakarta.jakarta $JAKARTA_HOME
    moby:/opt/jakarta &gt; sudo su - jakarta
    moby:~ &gt; cd $JAKARTA_HOME
    </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
<p>

Naturally you could set the password too, but since root can get in
anyhow, I didn't bother.  I decided to tighten some permissions by using 
 <a href="misc/peda/tighten_perms.sh.txt">this</a> script.
Now only user jakarta can start and stop the servlets, and Java server
pages. The environmental variables set in /etc/profile or
 /etc/profile.local can now be set instead in ~jakarta/.profile or
 ~jakarta/.bash_profile leaving other users free to choose other java
 versions and reducing the count of environmental variables.
<p>
Now that Tomcat is running, you can experiment with altering the stock
configuration.  There are many options here, and of course since
Jakarta is a project by the Apache foundation, it is designed to
integrate easily with Apache. Take a look at the users guide
included with the source, it provides some good examples, and
you can also consult the project <a href="#tomcat_ug">web site</a>.  
XML is the native format of it's configuration file, and you'll be
getting a crash course in XML, it you haven't learned about it yet.
To get you started, see the main configuration files, "server.xml" and
"web.xml". 
<p>
So welcome to the wild world of Java Server Pages and Servlets.
You'll find that it's a very mature in interesting technology.  Good
luck.
