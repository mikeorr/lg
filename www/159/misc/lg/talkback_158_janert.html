Jesus, that must have been an Ethiopian marathon race - alsmost nobody finishing
after 3:15. 3:15 is not easy - try it if you like. I could understand the
big bunch of people arriving around 2:30 if this was a big country
championship, but if there are amateurs present the big bunch would
definetely arrive between 3:15 and 4 - even after that.

Since this is the only comment on it we've seen so far, I guess there
aren't too many marathon runners among our readers... or possibly
everyone figured that the data was essentially arbitrary and constructed
to illustrate a point (bi-modal distribution and drawing too many
conclusions from too little information.) In other words, it probably
wasn't intended to be precisely representative.

Yeah, and I wasn't precisely serious (although I did bad job at pointing
that out.) A great article, otherwise!
