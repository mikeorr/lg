Sir,
</p>

<p>
	I have visited your web-site for squid configuration reference. It's
really helpful for me. Because i'm new to squid. Also i'm having a doubt
regarding squid. The main purpose of the squid is load-balancing &amp;
security which hides our webserver from outside world. I'm going to put
a two web server behind my squid. Where can I mention my web servers in
squid configuration. and how I can test that my squid is refering my two
servers if it's not having the cache. Please let me to know about it.
I'm using squid 2 as my reverse proxy and Apache as my web servers with
platform RHEL 4 u 4.  Thanking you,
</p>



<p>
With Thanks &amp; Regards,

Which article(s) are you referring to?  I know I wrote a little bit
about Squid a long time ago now (c. issue 80 or so).  I'm hoping
there's been more since then in LG, yet you fail to mention this
rather crucial aspect to your HTML (grr!) email.

You don't mention webservers at all.  Just point your browser to
either squid cache.  Can you be more specific though as to what it is
you're really trying to do?  Oh, and  please send any future emails
(here, or in general) as plain text.
