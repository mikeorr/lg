<h1>Bash configuration under Ubuntu</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>


<p>
[ From a moldering fragment of ancient writings discovered among the
dustbunnies in an abandoned computer room ]<br>
<blockquote><em> "...And when Ubuntu first came into the land, there was much rejoicing
at the nice interface, the ever-reliable "dpkg" package system, the
user-friendly community, and the rest - and all was good. But lo, there came
the darker days of further discovery: those who had, for ages untold, set
up their environment variables and other configuration bits in their
~/.bash_profile suddenly discovered that this was no longer processed.
Furthermore, they found that seeking advice in the wonderful Ubuntu user
forums availed them not. And there arose a cry in those latter days of
'Dude - WHAT HAPPENED TO MY RESOURCE FILES?'" </em></blockquote><br>
With luck, this article will answer that question - and maybe even tell you
what you can do about it.
</p>

<h3>The Way Things Were, and The Way They Are</h3>

<p> Once upon a time, life with Bash under X was easy and predictable: when
you booted your system, the final runlevel either A) handed you a login
console, which started your login shell and read all its init files, at
which point you could start X, or B) ran a graphical display manager that
would start X, fire off a login shell (which read its init files), and hand
control over to your ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession, where you could run up
whatever X configuration, programs, and desktop manager you wanted. Lots of
flexibility, plenty of choices - although that latter could be somewhat
confusing to Linux newcomers - and all was well.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu, however, did something different: the runlevel passes control to
the GNOME display manager (GDM), which runs your desktop manager (GNOME)
and... that's pretty much it. Sure, it's easier for newcomers - but there's
no such thing as control over the shell behavior anymore; in fact, there's
no login shell, which means that the per-user configuration files are no
longer sourced at login time. There's also no standard way to fire up any X
startup-time configuration. What to do?
</p>

<p>
When I switched to Ubuntu, I found the situation unpleasant but dealt with
it in various ways (mostly hacks involving becoming root and messing about
with Deep GDM Magick - not something I'd recommend for a new user, since
it's a good way to quickly make your system unbootable). Recently, though,
I decided to see if it could be fixed within the limits of what the average
user could do.
</p>

<h3>Following the Wily X Beast</h3>

<p>
First, I traced the execution of the X startup scripts in /etc/X11 and
/etc/gdm; this mostly involved chasing the path through the Xsession file,
which sets up variables and loads the external files, then hands control
off to the display manager defined in /etc/X11/default-display-manager
(gdm).  GDM, in turn, runs its own version of Xsession (/etc/gdm/Xsession)
which goes back and reads a series of scripts in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/, and
so on.  In the process, I noticed that one of the resources read by
/etc/gdm/Xsession was a file called "$HOME/.xprofile". Bingo - a
user-controllable resource! There was one catch, however: since the shebang
line at the top of /etc/gdm/Xsession consisted of "#!/bin/sh", this meant
that .xprofile would be read by that shell - not by Bash - which meant that
I had to avoid any "Bashisms" (i.e., structures or commands specific to
bash as contrasted against ones executable by a plain Bourne shell.) The
positive side to this was that Bash would inherit any of the variables set
by the Bourne shell (I guess some kids <em>do</em> listen to their
parents...) Overall, this didn't look like much of a hardship: it just
required a little extra caution. Previously, I would have just edited the
shebang in /etc/gdm/Xsession - but I was determined to do this from the
non-root perspective, so that option was out.
</p>

<p>
Since the default shell under Ubuntu is Bash, I knew that every invocation
of the shell would read the ~/.bashrc file. The traditional use of the two
bash resource files has always been to place the "run once" stuff like
PATH, functions, "mesg n", etc. in ~/.bash_profile, and "run for every
shell" stuff like aliases in ~/.bashrc. The latter was to be kept as small
and simple as possible, since it was run for <em>every</em> shell
invocation. Given this new system, though, that would have to change a bit:
</p>

<ol>
<li> I decided to leave my ~/.bash_profile alone. As a result of Ubuntu's
hackery, it's not being sourced now, but that doesn't mean that it won't be
at some point in the future - and if I move to some other distro, it's
still as valid as it always was.

<li> ~/.xprofile would now take over - more or less - the function of
~/.bash_profile, but would have to follow Bourne syntax. This means that
functions can no longer be exported (as Bourne does not support the "export
-f" convention), but must be moved into ~/.bashrc. Furthermore, since all of
it is being read <strong>before</strong> a console is spawned, any
tty-specific functions (e.g., "mesg") also need to be moved there. I also
made sure not to include the lines from ~/.bash_profile that sourced
~/.bashrc; that would be sourced every time I spawned a shell, but was not
wanted when X was sourcing ~/.xprofile.

<li> ~/.bashrc would now carry a bit more of a load: all the functions would
now be defined there (meaning they don't have to be exported any longer
- every shell gets the whole set as it starts up), and all the console
configuration would be there as well. The alias definitions, which were in
there previously, would stay just as they were.
</ol>

<p>
In essence, what I ended up doing is combining ~/.bash_profile and
~/.bashrc and splitting them back out into ~/.xprofile and ~/.bashrc,
according to the new "rules" that I set up above.
</p>

<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>
Be aware that you'll be "judged harshly" if you make a mistake: any error
in ~/.xprofile will crash your /etc/gdm/Xsession and cause GDM to show you
an error message - something like <em>"Your session lasted for less than 10
seconds. Failed to start the X server (your graphical interface).  It is
likely that it is not set up correctly. [...]"</em> If this happens, go to
'Options/Select session' in GDM and choose 'failsafe', check out your
~/.xsession_errors to find out why it crashed and fix that problem, then
try again.
</p>

<p>
Just below, I'll give (somewhat reduced) examples of my ~/.bash_profile,
~/.bashrc, and ~/.xprofile. The important thing to note is what got moved
out of the former and where it went, or if it went anywhere at all. I'll
highlight the ~/.xprofile lines in blue and the ~/.bashrc lines in green;
anything in bold black got left out because it was no longer applicable.

<h3>Wrap-up</h3>
<p>
In practice, the only concern that I had - i.e., that each shell invocation
would now load more slowly due to a larger ~/.bashrc - did not prove to be
a problem; testing it with 'time bash -c exit' showed a load+exit time of
0.004 seconds. For the moment, I'm willing to consider this problem solved
to my satisfaction.

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a> and <a href="okopnik1.html">son</a>;
his Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation
points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
