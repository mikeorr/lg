Dear list,
</p>

<p>
I did a net installation of lenny. I have not found xmms and I think the 
source is mising from the configuration. Here is my sources.list
</p>

<pre>
deb <a href="http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian">http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian</a> lenny main contrib non-free
deb <a href="http://security.debian.org/">http://security.debian.org/</a> lenny/updates main contrib non-free
deb-src <a href="http://security.debian.org/">http://security.debian.org/</a> lenny/updates main contrin non-free
</pre>

<p>
will it need additional source to have the multimedia ?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

2 minutes with Google tells me it's not in Lenny. Various other people seem to 
have packages and/or installation instructions, but you can Google as well as 
I can.

"audacious" (gtk2-based) might be a better bet.  Or xmms2, though that's
somewhat of a different thing.

Or, if you're absolutely determined you want xmms, build the package 
yourself:

<em>Quite</em> the different thing, as I found out last week. Instead of a
music player, it's now some weird client/server thing, with a broken
console-based controller app - and no way (that I could find) to do
anything like 'xmms2 song.mp3' and have it play. Highly aggravating,
that; if you're going to completely change not just the interface but
the very nature of an app, the name should not imply that it's just an
improved/updated version.
</p>

<p>
I got rid of the damn thing after struggling with it for half an hour
and getting progressively more and more annoyed. 'audacious' is close
enough to the functioning of the original 'xmms' that I'm happy to use
it instead - but it's somewhat of a pain to lose the use of the habits
I've built up over the years of using 'xmms'.

Hello Rick,
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot to make me familiar about the xmms issue. thanks for the link but 
I like to give audacious a try. If it is also light weight and user friendly 
like xmms then I'll continue with it.
</p>

<p>
Thanks
