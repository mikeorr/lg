Grr, irresponsible comment like "parking nazis" (=parking enforcement
police).  I haven't heard any reports of constitutions being suspended,
generals declaring themselves dictator, legislators overstaying their term
limit, or freedoms being curtailed.

because it's "dangerous".

Yes, and the mayor of N'Orleans ordered everyone out of the city this
morning, if I heard the radio report right.  Funny he should do that the
day after I said the evacuation wasn't "mandatory".

Um... "ordered out of the city". These are the people who couldn't get
out when a <em>hurricane</em> was coming to kill them; they will <em>surely</em> leave
now that the mayor told them to.

To give them full credit, the media has been
building up to this, with pictures of "looters" breaking into stores
(can someone explain "looting" to me? In a city with NO food, NO water,
NO useable plumbing, and when your child is screaming hysterically in
grief for the parent who got washed away, fear of what's happening,
hunger, thirst, and perhaps from being filthy due to lack of diapers and
being surrounded by a lake of toxic waste? Use short words, please;
anything like "political expediency" is going to sail right by me.)

Er, I don't watch TV so I haven't seen the pictures.  I've been realizing
that gives me an incomplete picture of major events and makes them seem
"less real", so occasionally I turn on the TV to see what it looks like.
I'd do it more but I absolutely cannot stand TV news with its hype and
commercials, and its emphasis on trivial stories.  If I knew what time the
good content was on I'd watch it, but I'm not going to sit through entire
newscasts just in case there's one good item during the half hour.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(I did turn on the TV for the London bombings.  Since it was happening
right then I knew there would probably be a TV story on it that moment.  I
was also able to identify with it in a way I couldn't with Spain, since
I'd been in that location.)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I assumed "looting" meant stealing electronics and jewelery and other
high-value items, not food and diapers.  God forbid they prosecute anybody
for taking food from an abandoned house or grocery store.  But no, I
haven't heard any elaboration on what is being "looted".  And yes, one
wonders how valuable a waterlogged computer is, especially if it's been
covered by toxic waste.

There's a lot of that, for sure. There are dead people lying out in the
open, right next to the NO Convention Center; the authorities have been
promising evacuation buses for <em>four days</em> with damn near no action.
There are over 40,000 people in the SuperDome and the Convention Center
right now, and probably another 60-100,000 elsewhere, and they're dying
in the heat and the filth. There just might be a bit of bottled up rage
over that, I suppose...

Rich people in NOLA mostly got out. The people with no cars, no money,
and living close to the financial brink in the first place - i.e., the
poor folks - mostly didn't. Now, they're "looters", and - well, they're
all damn criminals. Why not let them starve and die? That's all they
deserve, anydamn way. Besides, down there in New Orleans, they engage in
sins of the flesh, and they ain't Baptists. Let'em all go to hell.

Most poor
people in the US do have cars, especially in the South where there's not
much other transportation.  (I've even heard of Mexican farmworkers
pooling their resources to buy a $500 clunker to get to a job in another
city, knowing the car won't last more than one trip.)

Have you ever been down to Louisiana, Mike? Come on down out of your
smug white-bread Seattle neighborhood, and let me introduce you to the
realities of life. That's one of the poorest areas of this country, and
- just so you know - it's also the area that takes the most damage,
annually, from "natural causes". And - ready for this? - it got <em>no</em>
money to build or fix anything last year; the head of the Corps of
Engineers had been bitching about it since forever.

People have refused
to leave for various reasons, and it's not clear the poor are doing this
moreso than the rich.  Some of them have multistory houses, indicating
they're at least semi rich.  Surely there must be a lot of homeless people
and single parents without transportation, but whether they're the ones
doing the looting is another question.  Often they won't loot coz they
know it's wrong or they're afraid to; it's the drug addicts and criminals
who loot.  In other words, the ones who least deserve the stuff.

Mike... let me repeat this, so that perhaps you'll have another chance
to hear it: NO POTABLE WATER. NO FOOD. NO SANITATION. NO STORES OPEN. NO
SUPPLIES OF ANY KIND THAT CAN BE BOUGHT; NO BANKS WORKING TO GET MONEY
FROM.

Are you getting the picture yet? "Looting drug addicts" is the picture

Imagine yourself trapped in there, perhaps with your relatives. Some of
those who are close to you have died; the rest are bruised and battered,
or at best just soaked in filthy water that's full of oil (remember,
this is the "Energy Coast" here) and crap from under every sink in the
city. There's no way to wash it off; there's no water in the tap, no
electricity at the socket, no help at the telephone. You and yours
_can't_ leave - some of you are hurt; some may be dying - and there's
nobody to help.

What will you do? Obey that "mandatory evacuation order" and abandon
your family? Tell me, Mike - what will you do?
