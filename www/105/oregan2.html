<h1>RSS and Feed Readers</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>  
RSS, feed readers, and news aggregators are a hot topic right now.
Given the massive amount of news available on the net, it makes sense
to be able to read all of the news you're interested in, without having
to check a dozen or more websites. With a good feed reader, you can
subscribe to your favourite news sites - or even to sites you wouldn't
read as often as you would like - and have the software follow the news
for you.
<p>
RSS is one component of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">Semantic
Web</a> - and the only element currently enjoying widespread use. RSS is
not the only format available for providing news feeds, and the name RSS
even describes two different formats. I say <em>name</em> rather
than <em>acronym</em> because "RSS" has been variously used to mean "RDF
Site Summary", "Rich Site Summary", and "Really Simple Syndication", and
because of this, it is best regarded as a name, to avoid confusion.
<p>
For those who are interested, it was originally RDF Site Summary, and bore
a close resemblance to RSS 1.0. RDF was removed for the first public
version, and it was renamed Rich Site Summary, and Dave Winer (author of
RSS 0.92 and RSS 2.0) subsequently dubbed it Really Simple Syndication.

<h3>Before RSS</h3>
<p>
Before RSS was created, several sites, such as Slashdot, used custom
text files to describe their headlines so other news sites could make
use of them.

<small>Sample of <a href="http://www.linux.ie/">Linux.ie</a>'s <a
 href="http://www.linux.ie/ilugnews.txt">text backend</a>.</small>

<p> When the "version 4" browsers were released, both included
their own mechanisms for supplying "push content" - sections of
websites which were designed to be subscribed to. If the user
subscribed to the channel, their browser read the channel definition,
and periodically checked that site for updates, downloading the
relevant portions.

<p>
Netscape used a HTML-based "sidebar" (which is still present in Mozilla
etc.), but Microsoft created the "Channel Description Format", which
they <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-CDFsubmit.html">submitted to
the W3C</a>. (<a href="misc/oregan/cdf-sample.cdf.txt">Sample</a>).
Push content didn't catch on at the time, but later work on RSS has,
though not for "push content". (Though Dave Winer did add the 
<tt>&lt;enclosure&gt;</tt> element to RSS 0.92 to allow push in RSS).

<h3>RSS/Atom</h3>
<p>
The original version of RSS was 0.90, designed by Netscape for use on
their "My Netscape" portal. It was originally based on RDF, but
according to the <a href="http://goatee.net/2003/rss-history.html">RSS
timeline</a>, Netscape's marketing people caused it to be stripped
down. Netscape later expanded the format, to be closer to Dave Winer's
<a href="http://davenet.scripting.com/1997/12/15/scriptingNewsInXML">Scripting
News XML</a> (<a href="misc/oregan/lg-scripting_news.xml.txt">Sample</a>).

<p> Winer maintained the RSS specification, but meanwhile, the W3C released
their own RSS specification, based on the original idea of having an
RDF based format for syndication. This removed most of the RSS specific
tags, and used RDF schema to provide analogous tags. Since the W3C
decided to call this RSS 1.0, Winer named his updated version RSS 2.0. 

<p> Because of this confusion, an IETF working group was started to produce
an alternate format, called Atom (formerly Echo), which, unfortunately,
only served to add to the confusion. 

<p> RDF 2.0 is backward-compatible with RSS 0.92, which is
backward-compatible with RSS 0.91. The main difference between RSS 2.0 and
RSS 1.0 is that RSS 1.0 removes all terms from the RSS schema which are
available in other schema - in place of the <tt>&lt;title&gt;</tt> element,
for example, you could include a reference to the Dublin Core schema, and
use <tt>&lt;dc:title&gt;</tt> instead. RSS 2.0 can be extended with RDF
schema - as (to the best of my knowledge) can Atom.

<p> There are also websites available which will convert feeds to your
preferred format, for example <a
 href="http://www.2rss.com/software.php?page=atom2rss">2rss.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.tnl.net/blog/entry/RSS2Necho_is_now_RSS2Atom">RSS2Atom</a>.
Linux Gazette can then be accessed as an Atom feed from <a
 href="http://www.tnl.net/channels/rss2atom/http://linuxgazette.net/lg.rss">http://www.tnl.net/channels/rss2atom/http://linuxgazette.net/lg.rss</a>.<br>

<h3>Feed Readers</h3>

<h4>Liferea</h4>

<img alt="Liferea in action" title="Liferea in action"
src="misc/oregan/liferea.png" align="left" hspace="20">

<p style="margin: 50px 0px"> Liferea is my current favourite feed reader.
It features a UI that is similar to most of the popular Windows readers,
supports several formats (including CDF!), and integrates nicely with the
system tray. When minimised to the tray, it is very unassuming. When new
news arrives, the icon is coloured; otherwise, it's greyed. (Though the
version I'm using has a problem with my Blogspot Atom feed - <a
href="misc/oregan/blogspot.xml.txt">try it</a> if you're curious).

<p><img alt="Snownews" title="Snownews" src="misc/oregan/snownews.png"
align="right" hspace="20">
<p style="margin-top: 200px">
<h4>Snownews</h4>
<a href="http://home.kcore.de/%7Ekiza/software/snownews/">Snownews</a>
is an ncurses based feed reader for the console. It handles RSS 0.9x, 0.1
and 0.2, but can be extended with scripts to read other formats.  Snownews
has an excellent interface, reminiscent of Pine and Pico.  Snownews starts
with a blank screen. Various commands are bound to single key presses
(which may be configured by editing <tt>.snownews/keybindings</tt>). To add
a feed, type '<tt>a</tt>', and enter the URL when prompted. To open an item
in lynx (or whatever browser you choose to enter in
<tt>.snownews/browser</tt>), press '<tt>o</tt>'. 


<p> Newer versions of both Liferea and Snownews allow you to use the output
of another program as a feed source. RSSscrape, which I'll look at in a
little while, is a great tool to use with either of these programs.

<h4>Devedge RSS Ticker</h4>

Ben pointed me in the direction of <a
 href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/rss-toolbar-ticker/">Netscape
Devedge's RSS Ticker</a>. This is a very simple RSS ticker, which was
created as an example for a Devedge article. By default, it only
supports 3 news sites - Devedge, CNet, and The New York Times. There
are better tickers available for Mozilla.

<h4>URSS</h4>

<img alt="URSS" title="URSS" src="misc/oregan/urss.png" align="left" hspace="20" vspace="20">

<p style="margin-top: 50px"> <a href="http://urss.mozdev.org/">URSS</a> is
another Mozilla-based news ticker, originally based on the Devedge ticker.
It, however, allows you to add your own feeds, and adds a sidebar that
allows headlines and descriptions to be read. I don't use it much though,
because it's unable to read LG's feed, though this may not be an issue by
the time this article hits the newsstands, as I found invalid code in the
RSS which I've fixed.

<br clear="all">

<h3>A look at various feeds</h3>

<h4>RSS 0.9x</h4>

<p> LG uses the RSS 0.91 format, the original format <a
href="http://my.netscape.com/publish/formats/rss-spec-0.91.html">designed
by Netscape</a>. This is an excerpt from last month's issue:
<pre class="code">
&lt;rss version="0.91"&gt;

&lt;channel&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Linux Gazette&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link&gt;http://linuxgazette.net&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;description&gt;An e-zine dedicated to making Linux just a little bit more fun.
Published the first day of every month.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;language&gt;en&lt;/language&gt;
&lt;webMaster&gt;(email omitted)&lt;/webMaster&gt;
&lt;image&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Linux Gazette RSS&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;url&gt;http://linuxgazette.net/gx/2004/newlogo-blank-100-gold2.jpg&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;link&gt;http://www.linuxgazette.net/&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;

&lt;issue&gt;104&lt;/issue&gt;
&lt;month&gt;July&lt;/month&gt;
&lt;year&gt;2004&lt;/year&gt;

&lt;item&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The Mailbag&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link&gt;http://linuxgazette.net/104/lg_mail.html&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;description&gt;&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;/item&gt;

&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</pre>

<p> Pretty straightforward, isn't it? From issue 105 on, there are a few
extra bits. The <tt>&lt;webMaster&gt;</tt> tag has been added to complement 
the <tt>&lt;managingEditor&gt;</tt> tag, and the <tt>&lt;image&gt;</tt> tag has 
the optional <tt>&lt;height&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;width&gt;</tt> tags:

<pre class="code">
&lt;image&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Linux Gazette RSS&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;url&gt;http://linuxgazette.net/gx/2004/newlogo-blank-100-gold2.jpg&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;link&gt;http://www.linuxgazette.net/&lt;/link&gt;
<b>&lt;height&gt;42&lt;/height&gt;</b>
<b>&lt;width&gt;99&lt;/width&gt;</b>
&lt;/image&gt;
</pre>

<p> One feature which would have been nifty is <tt>&lt;textinput&gt;</tt>, which
allows you to search a site from your feed reader. Unfortunately, since
LG uses Google's site search, we can't use it as that requires an extra
parameter which RSS doesn't support.

<p> We'll take this heavily pruned Google search URL:
<tt>http://www.google.com/search?q=test</tt>. Here's how a textinput for that
URL would look:

<pre class="code">
&lt;textinput&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Search&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;description&gt;Search Google.&lt;/description&gt;
&lt;name&gt;q&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;link&gt;http://www.google.com/search&lt;/link&gt;
&lt;/textinput&gt;
</pre>

<p>One issue with LG's RSS feed is that <tt>&lt;issue&gt;</tt>, 
<tt>&lt;month&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;year&gt;</tt> are not valid tags. From next 
issue on, this information is in the channel description - it was unused 
before anyway.

<p> Our <tt>&lt;description&gt;</tt> now looks like this:

<pre class="code">
&lt;description&gt;An e-zine dedicated to making Linux just a little
bit more fun.
Published the first day of every month.
&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Issue 105: August, 2004
&lt;/description&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note the use of escaped HTML - this can be used in any 
<tt>&lt;description&gt;</tt>.

<h4>RSS 0.92 and 2.0</h4>

<p><a href="http://backend.userland.com/rss092">RSS 0.92</a> is Dave
Winer's expanded version of RSS 0.91. The main difference between RSS
0.91 and 0.92 is that several tags were made optional, and the limit of
15 items per feed was removed. Some experimental tags were added, but
they're not really useful for the majority of people - aside from the
<tt>&lt;enclosure&gt;</tt> element I already mentioned, there is also a
<tt>&lt;cloud&gt;</tt> element, which is used to provide a link to an XML-RPC or
SOAP service, which is used to tell aggregators that the feed has been
updated.

<p>RSS 2.0 builds on RSS 0.92. I couldn't make out what the differences
between RSS 2.0 and 0.92 were, though.

<h4>RSS 1.0</h4>

<p>RSS 1.0 is also backward-compatible with RSS 0.91, though instead of
adding new tags to support new concepts, a different RDF schema may be
referenced. Slashdot, for example, has its own schema which represents
the section, department ("from the do-the-shake-and-vac dept" etc.),
the number of comments, and the "hit parade".

<p> The first difference you'll notice is that the root element is
<tt>&lt;rdf:RDF&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>&lt;rss&gt;</tt>. Another difference 
is that the <tt>&lt;channel&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;image&gt;</tt> and 
<tt>&lt;item&gt;</tt> tags now have <tt>rdf:about</tt> attributes, and that 
the <tt>&lt;image&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;item&gt;</tt> tags must now
appear outside of the <tt>&lt;channel&gt;</tt> tag, and must have matching tags
with rdf:resource tags within the channel element (this applies to the
<tt>&lt;textinput&gt;</tt> element too).

<h4>Atom</h4>

<p> Atom was designed out of frustration with the competing versions of
RSS. It also shows that it was designed after blogs became popular, whereas
RSS predates this. Atom feeds, as is to be expected, are similar to RSS
feeds.

<p> Here's a sample Atom feed:

<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8' ?&gt;
&lt;!--&nbsp; If you are running a bot please visit this policy page
outlining rules you must respect.
http://www.livejournal.com/bots/  --&gt;
&lt;feed version='0.3' xmlns='http://purl.org/atom/ns#'&gt;
&lt;title mode='escaped'&gt;Dung by any other name...&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;tagline mode='escaped'&gt;jimregan&lt;/tagline&gt;
&lt;link rel='alternate' type='text/html'
href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/jimregan/' /&gt;
&lt;modified&gt;2004-07-26T01:12:32Z&lt;/modified&gt;
&lt;link rel='service.feed' type='application/x.atom+xml'
title='AtomAPI-enabled feed'
href='http://www.livejournal.com/interface/atomapi/jimregan/feed'/&gt;
  &lt;entry&gt;
    &lt;title mode='escaped'&gt;Sample title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:jimregan:4251&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;link rel='alternate' type='text/html'
    href='http://www.livejournal.com/users/jimregan/4251.html' /&gt;
    &lt;issued&gt;2004-07-26T02:12:00&lt;/issued&gt;
    &lt;modified&gt;2004-07-26T01:12:32Z&lt;/modified&gt;
    &lt;author&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;jimregan&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;/author&gt;
    &lt;content type='text/html' mode='escaped'&gt;A simple example.&lt;/content&gt;
  &lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/feed&gt;
</pre>
<p> Atom is not as simple as RSS - even RSS 1.0, with RDF, is easier. It's also
much newer than RSS, and not as well documented, or as well supported. It is,
however, the only feed type supported by <a href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a>,
Google's Blog site, so we can expect to see greater support for it.

<p> I tried to set up an Atom creator for LG, so we can support the three feed
types, but none of the feed readers I have installed were able to display 
anything useful from my feed. If you're skeptical, I have <a 
href="misc/oregan/lg.atom.xml.txt">included it</a> - you can <a 
href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Flinuxgazette.net%2F105%2Fmisc%2Foregan%2Flg.atom.xml.txt">check 
it</a> using <a href="http://feedvalidator.org">FeedValidator.org</a>.

<h3>Screen Scrapers</h3>

<p> A screen scraper is a program which checks a website for certain 
information. In this context, we want to take a site which lacks a feed, and
generate one - because we're all sold on the idea of feed readers now, being
the ultra-hip people that we are, right? - but they are also used to check
stock prices, flight details, auctions, etc. - there are several companies
who base their entire business around scraping other sites. 

<p> So, basically, a screen scraper is a script which grabs a webpage, runs it
through a regex or two, and spits out results in the desired format.

<p> I'm still stuck in Perl-novice land, and since I don't want to place too
much extra pressure on <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben</a>, our 
resident Perl guru, I'll use <a 
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/rssscraper/">RSSscraper</a>, a project
which provides the framework for scrapers, including the RSS generation code,
so you have little to do other than provide the URL and regex. (Plus, it's
written in Ruby, so I get to horrify <a href="../authors/adam.html">Thomas</a>
with the poor quality of my code instead (\o/) - check <a 
href="misc/oregan/regex-care.html">this</a> to see what I'm talking about!

<p> So, here's my example, formatted slightly to fit on the screen. (<a 
href="misc/oregan/Ben.scraper.rb">Text version</a>).

<pre class="code">
class <b>Ben</b>Scanner &lt; RSSscraper::AbstractScanner
	def initialize
		<b>@url_string = 'http://okopnik.freeshell.org/blog/blog.cgi'
		@url_proper = 'http://okopnik.freeshell.org/blog/'
		@postsRE = /div class="HeadText"&gt; \n\n([^&lt;]*)\n\n
		&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/td&gt;\n&lt;\/tr&gt;\n\n&lt;tr&gt;\n
		&lt;td bgcolor="#fdfded" class="UsualText" valign="middle"&gt;
		\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;([^&lt;]*)&lt;\/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n
		([^\]]*)\n\n&lt;p&gt;\[ &lt;a href="([^\s\t\r\n\f]*)"&gt;
		([^&lt;]*)&lt;\/a&gt;/m</b>
	end

	def find_items
		require 'cgi'
		items = Array.new
		request_feed.scan(@postsRE).each{ <b>|date, title, content, comments_link, comments|</b>
                        items &lt;&lt; { :title =&gt; title,
				   :description =&gt; "#{CGI::escapeHTML(content)}",
                                   :comments_link =&gt; @url_proper+comments_link,
				   :comments =&gt; @url_proper+comments_link
                                 }
		}
		items
	end
end

class <b>Ben</b> &lt; RSSscraper::AbstractScraper

	def scanner
		<b>Ben</b>Scanner.new
	end

	def description
	{
	        :link =&gt; <b>'http://okopnik.freeshell.org/blog/blog.cgi'</b>,
		:title =&gt; <b>'The Bay of Tranquility'</b>,
		:description =&gt; <b>'Ben Okopnik\'s blog.'</b>,
		:language =&gt; 'en-us',
		:generator =&gt; generator_string
	}	
	end

end
</pre>	

<p> So, looking at the parts in bold, you can probably guess that you need
to customise the main class name, and the scanner class. The file must be
named <tt>[Foo].scraper.rb</tt>, and these classes are then named 
<tt>[Foo]</tt> and <tt>[Foo]Scanner</tt>. 

<p> After that, the items in <tt>description</tt> are pretty obvious. 
<tt>@url_string</tt> is the URL of the site to be parsed; <tt>@url_proper</tt>
is only required in this case because the comments link is not a string
appended to the blog link, as it is in most cases. <tt>@postsRE</tt> is the 
regex, and <tt>date</tt>, etc. are the elements we wish to extract.

<p> The regex is the hardest part, and even at that, it's not too hard - just
remember that the parts you wish to extract go in parentheses.

<p> When you've filled in the blanks, you place it in your scrapers directory,
and run it like so: <tt>scrape.rb [Foo]</tt>. 

<h3>Generating RSS</h3>

<p> Well... I lied about wanting to spare Ben - I'm going to show a simple
example of an RSS generator in Perl. 

<p> <a href="http://cpan.org">CPAN</a> has a great module for generating
RSS (both 1.0 and 0.9x), called <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~kellan/XML-RSS-1.04/">XML::RSS</a>.

<p> Let's look at a sample for generating RSS 0.91 (<a href="misc/oregan/rss-09.pl.txt">Text</a>, 
<a href="misc/oregan/perl-test-0.9.rss.txt">sample output</a>).

<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use XML::RSS;

my $rss = new XML::RSS (version =&gt; '0.91');
$rss-&gt;channel(title          =&gt; 'Linux Gazette',
              link           =&gt; 'http://linuxgazette.net',
              language       =&gt; 'en',
              description    =&gt; 'An e-zine dedicated to making Linux just a little bit more fun.
Published the first day of every month.
&lt;br&gt;Issue 105: August, 2004',
              copyright      =&gt; 'Copyright (c) 1996-2004 the Editors of Linux Gazette',
              managingEditor =&gt; 'email@here.com',
              webMaster      =&gt; 'email@here.com');

$rss-&gt;image(title  =&gt; 'Linux Gazette',
            url    =&gt; 'http://linuxgazette.net/gx/2004/newlogo-blank-100-gold2.jpg',
            link   =&gt; 'http://www.linuxgazette.net/',
            width  =&gt; '99',
            height =&gt; '42');
              
$rss-&gt;add_item(title       =&gt; 'Securing a New Linux Installation',
               link        =&gt; 'http://linuxgazette.net/105/odonovan.html',
               description =&gt; 'By Barry O\'Donovan');

$rss-&gt;save("perl-test.rss");
</pre>

<p> To create an RSS 1.0 feed, we could simply take that example, and change
the version to 1.0 (which would look like <a 
href="misc/oregan/perl-test-1.0basic.rss.txt">this</a>), but with RSS 1.0 we 
can add different schema. XML::RSS uses Dublin Core and dmoz taxonomies by
default (you can, of course, easily add others, but I'm not going to cover 
that).

<p>(<a href="misc/oregan/rss-10.pl.txt">Text</a> and <a 
href="misc/oregan/perl-test-1.0.rss.txt">sample output</a>)

<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use XML::RSS;

my $rss = new XML::RSS (version =&gt; '1.0');
$rss-&gt;channel(title          =&gt; 'Linux Gazette',
              link           =&gt; 'http://linuxgazette.net',

Jimmy is a single father of one, who enjoys long walks... Oh, right.

<p> Jimmy has been using computers from the tender age of seven, when his father 
inherited an Amstrad PCW8256. After a few brief flirtations with an Atari ST
and numerous versions of DOS and Windows, Jimmy was introduced to Linux in 1998
and hasn't looked back.

<p> In his spare time, Jimmy likes to play guitar and read: not at the same time, 
but the picks make handy bookmarks.
