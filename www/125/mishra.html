<h1>Implementing a Simple Char Device in Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/mishra.html">Ranjeet Mishra</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Device</h3>

<p>
For the purpose of this article, let's consider a <em>device</em> to be a
virtual represention, within Linux, of hardware that one would like to
drive by using a piece of software. In the Linux world, devices are
implemented in the form of modules. By using modules, we can
provide device functionality that can be accessed from userspace.

<p>
A userspace entry point to a device is provided by a file node in the
<strong>/dev</strong> directory. As we know, most of the things in Linux
world are represented in the form of files. We can do [<strong>ls
-l</strong>] on any device file, which will report the device type -
character or block device, as well as its major number and minor number.

<p>
The <em>type of device</em> indicates the way data is written to a device. For
a character device, it's done serially, byte by byte, and for a block
device (e.g., hard disk) in the form of chunks of bytes - just as the name
suggests.

<p>
The <em>major number</em> is assigned at the time of registering the device
(using some module) and the kernel uses it to differentiate between various
devices. The <em>minor number</em> is used by the device driver programmer
to access different functions in the same device.
 
<p>
Looking at the number of files in the <strong>/dev</strong>
directory, one might think that a very large number of devices are up and
running in the system, but only few might be actually present and running.
This can be seen by executing [<strong>cat /proc/devices</strong>]. (One can
then see the major numbers and names of devices that are passed at the time of
registering.)


<h3>Modules</h3>

Every device requires a module. Information about the currently loaded
modules can be extracted from the kernel through [<strong>cat
/proc/modules</strong>]. A module is nothing more than an object file that
can be linked into a running kernel; to accomplish this, Linux provides the
[<strong>insmod</strong>] utility. As an example, let's say that my
module's object file is called <strong>my_dev.o</strong>; we can link it to
the kernel using [<strong>insmod my_dev.o</strong>]. If
<strong>insmod</strong> is successful we can see our module's entry using
[<strong>cat /proc/modules</strong>], or [<strong>lsmod</strong>]. We can
remove the module using the <strong>rmmod</strong> utility, which takes the
object file name as an argument.


<h3>Writing a Module to register a Char device</h3>

<p>
First of all, we should know the basics of generating a module object file.
The module uses kernel space functions and since the whole kernel code is
written inside the <strong>__KERNEL__</strong> directive we need to define
it at time of compiling, or in our source code. We need to define the
<strong>MODULE</strong> directive before anything else because Module
functions are defined inside it. In order to link our module with the
kernel, the version of the running kernel should match the version which
the module is compiled with, or [<strong>insmod</strong>] will reject the
request. This means that we must include the [include] directory present in
the Linux source code of the appropriate version.  Again, if my module file
is called my_dev.c, a sample compiler instruction could be [<strong>gcc
-D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux.2.6.7/linux/include -c my_dev.c</strong>]. A
<strong>-D</strong> is used to define any directive symbol. Here we need to
define __KERNEL__, since without this kernel-specific content won't be
available to us.


<p>
The two basic functions for module operations are
<strong>module_init</strong> and <strong>module_exit</strong>. The insmod
utility loads the module and calls the function passed to module_init, and rmmod
removes the module and calls function passed to module_exit. So inside
module_init, we can do whatever we wish using our kernel API. For
registering the char device, the kernel provides
<strong>register_chrdev</strong> which takes three arguments, namely: the
major number, the char string (which gives a tag name to the device), and
the file operations struct address which defines all the stuff we would
like to do with our char device. <strong>struct file_operations</strong> is
defined in <strong>$(KERNELDIR)/linux/include/fs.h</strong> which declares
the function pointers for basic operations like open, read, write, release,
etc.  One needs to implement whatever functions are necessary for the
device. Finally, inside the function passed to module_exit, we should free
the resources using <strong>unregister_chrdev</strong> which will be called
when we do <strong>rmmod</strong>.

<p>
Below is the code listing where the device is nothing but an 80
byte chunk of memory.

<h3>Program Listing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="misc/mishra/Makefile.txt">Makefile</a>
<li>
<a href="misc/mishra/my_dev.c.txt">my_dev.c</a>
<li>
<a href="misc/mishra/my_dev.h.txt">my_dev.h</a>
</ul>

<h3>Playing with the char device</h3>

<p>
Load the device using [<strong>insmod my_dev.o</strong>]. Look for the
entry through /proc/modules and /proc/devices.  Create a file node in /dev
directory using [<strong>mknod /dev/my_device c 222 0</strong>]. Look
inside the code, we have given the major number as 222. You might think
that this number may clash with some other device - well, that's correct,
but I have checked whether this number is already occupied by some other
device. One could use dynamic allocation of the major number; for that we
have to pass 0 as the argument.
 
<p>
Now we can read the data in the device using [<strong>cat
/dev/my_device</strong>] and can write to our device using [<strong>echo
"something" &gt; /dev/my_device</strong>]. We can also write full-fledged
userspace code to access our device using standard system calls of open,
read, write, close, etc. Sample code is presented below.

<pre>
-------------------------------------------
/* Sample code to access our char device */

#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include&lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include&lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include&lt;fcntl.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int fd=0,ret=0;
	char buff[80]="";
	
	fd=open("/dev/my_device",O_RDONLY);
	
	printf("fd :%d\n",fd);
	
	ret=read(fd,buff,10);
	buff[ret]='\0';
	
	printf("buff: %s ;length: %d bytes\n",buff,ret);
	close(fd);
}

-------------------------------------------
<strong>Output</strong>
fd: 3
buff: hi from kernel ;length: 14 bytes
-------------------------------------------

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

[ Note: a tarball containing all the code in this article can be downloaded <a href="misc/mishra/my_dev.tgz">here</a>. ]

<p>
In this article I have tried to show how to use the kernel functions to
register a character device, and how to invoke it from userspace. There are
many issues that have not been touched upon here, such as the concurrency
problem where we need to provide a semaphore for the device to do mutual
exclusion as more than one process may try to access it. I will try to
cover these issues in my future articles.

I am from New Delhi, India and am a great Linux fan and love the way
Linux gives freedom to control the hardware gizmos. I am using Linux
since the start of the new millennium but started digging into kernel
sources recently after completing the B-Tech from IIT-Guwahati.
It all began with a desire to create modules to control the peripheral
devices and since then there is no turning back.
</p>

<p>
I would like to share my experiences and any interesting thing that
comes across me during this Linux journey through Linux Gazette
Articles.
