The US 
<a href="http://cryptome.org/sssca.htm">
SSSCA</a>, so enthusiastically promoted by Senator Fritz Hollings,
has metamorphosed into the 
<a href="http://cryptome.org/broadbandits.htm">
CBDTPA</a>: the Consumer Broadband and Digital
Television Promotion Act, which has now been introduced in the Senate.
Unfortunately, it has not become any more palatable during the transition.
The
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,51275,00.html">
direction of the bill</a>
is unchanged.  If passed, it would mandate government-approved security
standards and "digital rights management" systems which would have to be
included in electronic devices. Import or interstate distribution of devices
not meeting these requirements would be illegal.  Such
regulations would apply to software or hardware that reproduces, displays,
retrieves or accesses copyright work.  Such a definition covers a staggeringly
broad range of devices and programs.  Measures which would fulfil these
obligations could render even completely
<a href="http://hardware.earthweb.com/prodop/article/0,,12099_985991_,00.html">
legitimate procedures</a>
such as backups and disk optimisation impossible, or at least illegal.
<p>
(That "interstate distribution" clause is what allows the federal 
government to get involved; they cannot interfere with in-state commerce.
However, this is small comfort, since most electronic products in the US are
imported from Asia, and few states have domestically-produced substitutes
available.)
<P>
Business support for the bill is not universal, and there were 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/54/24262.html">
heated exchanges</a>
between Hollings and Intel executive VP Leslie Vadasz at a recent hearing
before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
<a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0307/">
LWN's coverage</a>
provides some insight into the nature and conduct of this hearing.
Support for the proposed measures is strongest among "content providers"
such as Disney.  The technology business naturally fears being hamstrung by
regulations which would diminish the usefulness of their products.
Following this apparently courageous stand by Vadasz, the 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">
Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>
requested that people mail Intel to express support and solidarity.
However, a subsequent
<a href="http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20020319aol_intel.htm">
joint statement</a> by AOL Time Warner and Intel painted a somewhat
different picture, critiqued by the EFF 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/SSSCA_CBDTPA/20020322_eff_aol-intel_critique.html">
here</a>.  This statement "envisions a world in which corporate
negotiations decide consumers' rights, and government outlaws devices
falling outside a `consensus' imposed by Hollywood."  It seems the
divisions are not only between companies, but also within. A Slashdot
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/03/01/1423248.shtml?tid3">
comment</a> on the story indicated that this is perhaps really a power
struggle between the two industries, with the tech business trying to evade
regulation so as to gain leverage over the entertainment business.  It
sounds plausible, especially when Disney starts
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/04/1445216">
accusing</a>
Apple of aiding and abetting music piracy.
<p>
Naturally, this story has gained a lot of coverage in the tech press.
Slashdot had stories on 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/03/01/1423248.shtml?tid3">
the hearing</a>,
the 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/21/2344228">
introduction</a>
of the bill to the senate, and a 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/22/2345249&mode=nested&tid=103">
follow up</a> to the same story.
Wired also ran a good 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,51274,00.html">
story</a>
or
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,51245,00.html">
two</a>
following the debut of the bill in the Senate.
An
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=5930">
excellent commentary</a> by
Doc Searls is available online at the Linux Journal website which comments
on the issues surrounding this case, and rebuts much of Hollings'
testimony to the clumsily titled
<a href="http://commerce.senate.gov/press/107-159.html">
Hearing on Protecting Content in a Digital Age-Promoting Broadband and the
Digital Television Transition </a>.
Another fine 
<a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0328/">
commentary</a>, well worth reading, was published in Linux Weekly News.
<P>
Hopefully, after reading some of those links, one gets pretty angry about the
terrible laws some interests would like to control you with.  This leads to the
question, what can be done?  One important step is to stay informed about these
issues.  As usual, 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/">
EFF</a> have  a 
<a href="http://www.eff.org/IP/SSSCA_CBDTPA/">
page</a>
collecting various resources and documents surrounding this case.  Also,
their
<a href="http://www.eff.org/cafe/">
CAFE (Campaign for Audiovisual Free Expression)</a>
webpage is a good source for info on this and related topics.
This
<a href="http://www.eff.org/alerts/20020322_eff_cbdtpa_alert.html">
EFF press release</a>
has some advice on specific measures which can be taken to help stop this
law. You are advised to:
<ul>
<li>
    Send a letter to the senate, which has requested comments on the future
    of digital media distribution. EFF provide a
    <a href="http://www.eff.org/alerts/20020322_eff_cbdtpa_alert.html">
    sample letter</a>,
    though it would  be best if you rephrased it yourself.
</li>
<li>
    Use this
    <a href="http://judiciary.senate.gov/special/input_form.cfm?comments=1">
    webform</a>
    to submit comments to the senate committee (closes April 8th, 2002).
</li>
<li>
    Contact your local elected representatives, and tell them how important
    this issue is. EFF has 
    <a href="http://www.eff.org/congress.html">
    guidelines</a>
    on "Contacting Congress and Other Policymakers".
</li>
<li>
    Try to raise the visibility of this issue among people who would not
    otherwise be aware of it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
And before those in Europe start sniffing that this whole business is
typically American and couldn't happen here, they should take note of 
<a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0307/">
LWN's warning</a>
that the European Commission is considering 
<a href="http://lwn.net//2002/0307/ec-drm.pdf">
similar measures</a> [pdf].

<P>
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk">
The Register</a>
came up with a few good software patent stories over the last month.
<ul>
<li>
    Symantec has been 
    <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/56/24528.html">
    awarded a patent</a>
    on a heuristic technology used to detect viruses. This technique has
    already been in use for some time.
<li>
</li>
    Maz technologies have 
    <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24557.html">
    gained a patent</a>
    on a "method of transparent encryption and decryption for an electronic
    document management system".  This would effectively put a lock on a
    large part of the encryption industry, and has been preceded by
    considerable prior art.  It will be up to the companies being hassled
    for licensing fees to challenge the validity of the patent.
<li>
</li>
    The bizarre attempt by British Telecom to enforce a patent on
    hyperlinks, has been 
    <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/24440.html">
    dealt a blow</a>
    by a US Federal Court Judge who ruled that the patent in question might
    not, after all, cover hyperlinks.  This case is not over yet, though.
<li>
</li>
    Finally, the Amazon 1-Click patent dispute with BN.com has finally
    <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/23/24345.html">
    been settled</a>
    out of court.  This does nothing to challenge the daftness underlying
    the patent.
</li>
</ul>
<P>
<hr noshade width="20%">

The argument is often made by pro-patent apologists that patents are
essential to a growing economy.  Historically, this has not been shown to
be the case.
<a href="http://www.monbiot.com">
George Monbiot</a>
has written an excellent
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/globalisation/story/0,7369,665969,00.html">
article</a> in 
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">
The Guardian</a>,
which tells the story of how many of the companies now demanding
intellectual property rights were built without them.  In particular,
patent free regions enjoyed exceptional growth, until political pressure
from patent enforcing nations lead to a change in policy.

<P>
The GPL 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24286.html">
almost made it to the courtroom</a>
during the last month.  The circumstances concern a dispute ongoing between
MySQL AB and NuSphere Corp.  In June 2000 NuSphere licensed distribution
and support rights for the MySQL Database, from MySQL AB; under a deal that
was also to see significant code contributions from NuSphere into the body
of MySQL.  Relations soured between the two companies.  MySQL accused
NuSphere of trademark infringement (for setting up the mysql.org web site),
of breach of contract, and of infringing the GPL.  The Free Software
Foundation became involved in the case as an expert witness on behalf of
MySQL.
<p>
Regarding the alleged GPL infringement, the 
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-02-26-013-20-PR-LL">
contention</a>
of the FSF is that by statically linking their Gemini product against the
GPL'ed MySQL code, and then failing to distribute source code, NuSphere
violated the terms of the license.  NuSphere
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-02-27-016-20-PR-LL">
vigorously opposed</a>
these allegations, asserting that their product did not infringe the
licence terms, and pointing out that they also distributed the Gemini code
under the GPL (an earlier version was, however, distributed without source
code).
<p>
Though the FSF 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24219.html">
expected</a>
the case would serve as a test of the GPL, the judge's preliminary
injunction 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24286.html">
limited the terms</a>
of the case to the copyright infringement issue.  She took the position
that since NuSphere appeared to be currently in compliance with the
licence, it is unlikely any irreparable harm is being done to MySQL
AB.

<FONT COLOR="green">Good News for Mozilla

</H3> 
It appears that following the recent 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla0.9.9">
0.9.9 release</a>,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">
Mozilla</a> is finally nearing the magical 
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/roadmap/mozilla-1.0.html">
1.0 release</a>.  The development tree has
<a href="http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=2176">
been closed</a> in preparation for the release.
<p>
Additionally, Newsforge has
<a href="http://newsvac.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/03/08/1957252&mode=thread">reported</a>
that AOL is to move closer to Linux and Mozilla, thus gaining more
independence from Microsoft and Internet Explorer.
The move 
<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=581&u=/nm/20020312/tc_nm/tech_aol_redhat_dc_1">
towards Linux</a>
appears to involve a support deal with Red Hat to deploy Linux in back-room
functions.   However Mozilla appears destined to 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24441.html">
be deployed</a>
on the ubiquitous AOL CD's.  Though this development will be welcomed by
many in the Free Software and Linux communities, some 
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/729918.asp?cp1=1">
are worried</a>
it might lead to wider enforcement of web standards.
We should be so lucky.

Richard Stallman, announced in a
<a href="http://www.idg.net/ic_829012_4394_1-3921.html">
recent interview</a>, that he expects
the 
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">
GNU Hurd</a> to be ready for production release this year.
This story was 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/03/12/1236243.shtml?tid=117">
picked up</a> by Slashdot, and also received some
<a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0314/">
comment</a>
on Linux Weekly News.
<p>
While on the subject of Richard Stallman, you might be interested to note
that 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">
O'Reilly</a>

<a href="http://www.opencores.org/">
OpenCores</a> is
an organisation whose main objective is to design, reuse, and integrate IP
cores under the General Public License (GPL) helping the concept of freely
available, open-source hardware to emerge. OpenCores have recently
announced the immediate availability of the open-source, free, complete
33/66MHz 32-bit PCI Bridge Soft Core solution.  The PCI Bridge Soft Core is
a complete, synthesizable RTL (Verilog) code that provides bridging between
the PCI and a WISHBONE (System-on-Chip) bus. The complete package includes
comprehensive specification and design documentation, a comprehensive
verification suite, and a test application.
<P>
Test application is a VGA card implemented using a Xilinx
Spartan II device on a PCI development board from Insight Electronics. PCI
bridge core is connected to a simple VGA controller core forming a
system-on-chip and comes with a Linux frame buffer device driver.
You can download the PCI Bridge Soft
Core from the

organisation</a>
that hosts GNU/Linux Projects for Developing Countries 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01786.html">

announced</a>
the release of a fourth beta of the upcoming
Mandrake Linux 8.2.
<P>
In less happy news, Mandrake is also under a bit of a cash squeeze at the
moment, which has led the company to 
<a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/mdkfuture.php3">
launch</a>
a subscription based club, priced from $5 per month.
This development was commented upon both
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/24395.html">
in The Register</a> and 
<a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0314/">
in Linux Weekly News</a>.
ZDnet also covered the story,
<a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1104-866870.html">
reporting</a> dissatisfaction among club members when it appeared
that the terms of membership were being changed.  This change was the
result of an unexpected change in Sun's pricing structure for Star Office.
Mandrake has replied to these criticisms, in its official announcement of the
availability for club-members of
<a href="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/staroffice-6.0.php3">

There appears to be some feuding going on around the Sorcerer camp.  An
unsigned webpage was
<a href="http://www.sorcerylinux.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=6&mode=thread&order=0">
posted</a> at 
<a href="http://sorcerer.wox.org/">sorcerer.wox.org</a> alleging
that the distribution had effectively been stolen from its creator Kyle
Sallee.  This page is no longer available, but can be read at this 
<a href="http://www.sagelikefool.net/mark/sorcerer.wox.org-index.html">
mirror</a>. 
These allegations were 
<a href="http://www.sorcerylinux.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=7&mode=thread&order=0">
replied to</a>
by the guys at
<a href="http://www.sorcerylinux.org/">

in the original story.  Interestingly,
<a href="http://sorcerer.wox.org/">sorcerer.wox.org</a>

<a href="http://sorcerer.wox.org/news.html">appear</a> to be operated by
Kyle.  An interesting article to read in this context is

suggestions for allocating hard disk space and selecting software.  The
fast installation finishes by simply entering a user name and password and
confirming monitor resolution. Even printer, sound card, and TV card are
installed automatically with a mouse click.
<P> SuSE Linux 8.0 will be available from software retailers from mid-April
2002. The recommended retail price for SuSE Linux 8.0 Personal (3 CDs, 2
