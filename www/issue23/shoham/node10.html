<P>
Over the course of about six months, we implemented the entire
client/server architecture.  With all the building blocks in place,
we could implement some extra features with relative ease:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> We needed a report writer; preferably one that could run on the server.
   By creating reports on the server, the client PCs would require
   minimal software and infrequent upgrades.  Furthermore, reports could
   be produced very quickly, since no data would travel across any
   network, no matter how fast.
<P>
   We already had a system (from a previous project) that could convert
   a high-level description of a report into C source code, to be linked
   against <A NAME="tex2html13" HREF="http://www.sequiter.com">CodeBase</A>.  We integrated stand-alone executable reports
   written using this tool into the server, so that a client could request
   a report and the server would deliver only the output.
<LI> Every Unix system is configured with a mailer.  In our case, the mailer
   was just <TT>sendmail</TT>.  We wanted to give the end-users access to e-mail,
   but over the encrypted SSL connection rather than directly.  To do this,
   we added a rudimentary e-mail user interface to the client and a thin
   server, that just talks to <TT>sendmail</TT> over a local SMTP socket.
<LI> The client/server database, along with the server's ability to 
   regularly execute tasks, allowed us to implement a simple bulletin
   system, where any user could post announcements and the server would
   automatically delete them after a period of time.  The bulletins are 
   stored using a regular table in the database, so access to them
   is controlled by the same mechanism that controls access to data
   elsewhere in the system.
