<h1>Internet Radio Router</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/ziemann.html">Dr. Volker Ziemann</a></b></p>


<h3>Internet Radio Router</h3>
<p>
My family's DSL hookup is in the kitchen, and we distribute Internet
access around the house with a wireless router, but so far, we cannot
listen to Internet radio in the kitchen. Of course, I could buy a
commercial off-the-shelf Internet radio, but what is the fun in doing
that?  On the other hand, I could buy a Linux-based wireless router
with USB, connect a USB sound card to it, and have fun making the
whole enchilada work in a (moderately) user-friendly way, such that
other members of the family can also use it. In order to make the
project reasonably lightweight and manageable over a summer break I
decided to avoid hardware modifications (as much fun as that may be)
or the installation of large software packages like perl on the
router.  Almost all programming is done with shell scripts.
</p>

<p>
Before starting, I'd like to point out that listening to an
Internet radio stream at 128 kbits/sec generates 1.4 GB of network
traffic in a 24 hour period. You might want to keep this in mind, if you
do not have a flat-rate plan, but have to pay proportionate to the
volume of your Internet access.  That being said, let's delve into 
implementation details, and start by discussing hardware.  
</p> 

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>
I purchased what must have been the last available ASUS WL-500g Premium,
with two USB2 connectors on the back. Any other router will probably work,
if it has at least one USB port and can have its operating system
(firmware) replaced by a Linux-based system that also supports USB. I chose
<a href="http://www.openwrt.org">OpenWRT</a> <a
id="ziemann.html_1_back"></a><a href="#ziemann.html_1">[1]</a> which is a
Debian derivative for embedded appliances and comes with support and
drivers for many gadgets, in particular the inexpensive no-name USB sound
card that I bought. (The <tt>lsusb</tt> command reports 0d8c:000c C-Media
Electronics, Inc. Audio Adapter.)  In order to hear the music, I connected
the sound card's output to some active speakers I had lying around.
Standard headphones should also work, but I would refrain from using
passive speakers, because the USB sound card receives power via the USB
port, and larger passive speakers might load the USB port beyond
tolerable levels.  
</p>

<h3>System Software</h3>
<p>
Installing a new Linux-based operating system on the router is next: I
follow the installation instructions for OpenWRT 8.09.1
(Kamikaze) <a id="ziemann.html_2_back"></a><a href="#ziemann.html_2">[2]</a>
and re-flash the firmware of the router. I can then log on to the
router for the first time. Immediately after flashing, the router has
the default IP address 192.168.1.1, and I can connect a computer to
one of the router's LAN ports.  By default, the router has a DHCP
server enabled, such that any computer requesting an IP via DHCP can
connect. I then use telnet to log on to the router as user 'root'. No
password is needed as long as the root password is not set with the
'passwd' command. Once it is set, one needs to use ssh for shell
access. For testing and developing, I prefer shell access, but
standard administrative tasks such as adjusting network settings or
installing additional software can be more easily done with the LuCI
Web-based interface, which can be reached by pointing your browser to
the router, which still has IP address 192.168.1.1, unless you have
changed it.  You need to log on as user 'root' with the previously
chosen password. You can now change all router settings and install
additional drivers and software. To have full access to all
configuration features, select 'Administration' mode, on the top right
of LuCI's interface.
</p>

<p>
Before we can install more software, we need to connect the router to the
Internet. This is helped by the router's WAN port being configured, by
default, to request an IP from whatever it is connected to. I hooked up
the ASUS's WAN port to one of the LAN ports on the old DSL router in our
kitchen. In this way, the ASUS has access to the Internet, and can
contact software repositories.  
</p>

<p>
The initial OpenWRT installation does not support USB devices, we have
to install drivers to enable the use of USB memory sticks and the USB sound
card. In LuCI the software installation page can be found under the tab
labelled 'System/Software'.  First, update the package lists by selecting
the top-left link on the Software page, which causes the page to be
reloaded with a large number of available packages. Install packages by
checking a box in the appropriate line, and pressing the 'Perform Actions'
button at page bottom.  There is a useful filter function available, which
makes finding appropriate packages easy.
</p>

<p>
For USB memory stick support I follow Ref. <a
id="ziemann.html_3_back"></a><a href="#ziemann.html_3">[3]</a> and install
the kernel modules <tt>kmod-usb-uhci, kmod-usb-ohci, kmod-usb2</tt> for
generic USB1 and USB2 support. Since most USB memory sticks come with a FAT
file system, I also install <tt>kmod-fs-vfat</tt>. When installing from the
LuCI Web-interface, all relevant modules are already loaded, so no
<tt>insmod </tt> commands are needed. The kernel-module required for
the sound card is <tt>kmod-usb-audio</tt>, as described in
Ref. <a id="ziemann.html_4_back"></a><a href="#ziemann.html_4">[4]</a>.I
also install the <tt>madplay</tt> mp3-player package. For debugging
purposes, the <tt>usbutils</tt> package, which contains the
<tt>lsusb</tt> command, is useful.
</p>

<p>
After installing all required packages, I finally log on to the router
via ssh to get a command shell, and follow Ref. 4 to play an Internet radio
station from the shell by entering
</p>

<pre>
    wget -q -O - http://94.23.29.150:11022 | madplay -
</pre> 

<p>
To my utter surprise, this worked the first time I tried &mdash;
commendations to the OpenWRT developers. In the above command, <tt>wget</tt>
pulls the mp3 radio stream from IP and port number
<tt>http://94.23.29.150:11022</tt> and pipes it to standard output, where
<tt>madplay</tt> receives it and uses the default sound device
<tt>/dev/dsp</tt> as output, where it is made audible on the speakers. Note
that this constitutes the core of the Internet radio player. However,
logging on to the router to start it is rather inconvenient. Moreover,
there is only one useful button on the router, which makes building a user
interface without direct computer access difficult. Further on, I
describe my user interface to the Internet radio router.
</p>

<p>
A word about finding an Internet radio station's address is in order.
I usually find stations by selecting them
from <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/">http://www.shoutcast.com/</a>
and playing in <tt>xmms</tt> on my desktop computer. In <tt>xmms</tt>,
the 'view file info' selection in the file menu (or pressing CTRL-3)
reveals the station's address.
</p>

<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>
The fact that only a single button is available for a user interface
makes it necessary to contemplate what functionality is essential, and
how often different activities happen. For example, turning the radio
on or off, or switching between radio stations, will happen frequently
and should be possible without an extra computer, by just using the
single available button. Consequently, I will program the button to
cycle between five pre-selected radio stations and 'OFF' as the sixth
state. Selection of stations is aided by short sound files, stating
the channel number, that are played before selection of a new
station. Changing the pre-selected stations occurs much more rarely,
and will use the Web server, including cgi-bin facilities, available
on the router that normally serves the LuCI interface.
</p>

<p>
Let's start with programming the button. There are actually two
buttons on the back of the router: one is red and protruded, and
labelled 'EzSetup'.  The another one is labeled 'Restore', and requires
a pointed device such as a pen to activate. I will therefore use only
the 'EzSetup' button. It turns out to be rather simple to do so. All
the following activities are performed while ssh'd into the router and
using the vi editor installed on it. The button is triggered
asynchronously to other router activities, and is therefore under the
control of a 'hotplug' daemon with configuration files
under <tt>/etc/hotplug.d/</tt>. Under this directory, we first need to
create subdirectory <tt>/etc/hotplug.d/button/</tt>, and, in this
subdirectory, we create the script <tt>handler</tt> that is executed when a
button is pressed. This functionality is also used to turn the
wireless network on or off, as explained in
Refs. <a id="ziemann.html_5_back"></a><a href="#ziemann.html_5">[5]</a> 
<a id="ziemann.html_6_back"></a><a href="#ziemann.html_6">[6]</a>. Specific
information pertaining to the ASUS router can be found in
Ref. [2].
</p>

<p>
Before discussing the script, we need to make its existence known to the
system. All configuration information is stored in the subdirectory
<tt>/etc/config/</tt>, where I create a file <tt>radio</tt> to hold all
persistent information, surving any router reboots.  My copy of that file
is reproduced below:
</p>

<pre class="code">
   # file: /etc/config/radio
   config 'radio'
	option 'button' 'ses'
	option 'state' '0'
	option 'ch1' 'http://216.155.137.150:10000'
	option 'ch2' 'http://scfire-dtc-aa07.stream.aol.com:80/stream/1075'
	option 'ch3' 'http://scfire-mtc-aa04.stream.aol.com:80/stream/1006'
	option 'ch4' 'http://94.23.17.224:8396'
	option 'ch5' 'http://94.23.29.150:11022'
</pre>

<p>
The first non-comment line states the parameter name, here <tt>radio</tt>,
followed by options. The most important one is the assigned button
<tt>ses</tt>. I also added a state, used to keep track of the station just
listened to, and also to tell which station is next. The parameters labeled
<tt>chX</tt> store addresses of the pre-selected radio stations. On the
command line or in scripts, parameters can be read using the <tt>uci</tt>
command using the following construction <tt> uci get radio.@radio[0].state
</tt> and written by <tt> uci set radio.@radio[0].state=3 </tt>, where we
use the state variable in this example. The other parameters can be changed
in a similar way. The program <tt>uci</tt> is a convenient interface on
OpenWRT to access configuration parameters. It does, however, manipulate
copies of the parameters only in memory, not on disc. Current parameters
can be written to the configuration file using the command <tt> uci commit
radio </tt>, which will again make the values persistent. This feature will
be used to change the pre-selected radio stations.
</p>

<p>
Having made available the configuration variables that keep track of the
current station and the station addresses, we can now discuss the
action taken when the back-panel button is pressed.  Remember, this is
stored in file <tt>/etc/hotplug.d/button/handler</tt>.  A fragment of the
file is reproduced here:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
# file: /etc/hotplug.d/button/handler
# logger button handler: $BUTTON $ACTION $SEEN 

STATE=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].state)

CH1=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch1) CH2=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch2)
CH3=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch3) CH4=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch4)
CH5=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch5)

if [ $BUTTON = "ses" ]
then
	if [ $ACTION = "released" ]
	then
		killall wget
		if [ $SEEN -gt "0" ]
		then
			STATE=-1
		fi

		case $STATE in
			0 ) madplay /root/radio/ch1.mp3 wget -q -O - $CH1 |\
				madplay - &amp; uci set radio.@radio[0].state=1 ;;
			1 ) madplay /root/radio/ch2.mp3 wget -q -O - $CH2 |\
				madplay - &amp; uci set radio.@radio[0].state=2 ;;
			* ) uci set radio.@radio[0].state=0 madplay /root/radio/off.mp3 ;;
		esac
	fi
fi
</pre>

<p>
A complete copy is <a href="misc/ziemann/handler.sh">here</a>. Pushing
the router's back-panel button triggers execution of this file.  The
system also supplies three environment variables <tt>$BUTTON, $ACTION</tt>,
and <tt>$SEEN</tt> at runtime. The variable <tt>$BUTTON</tt> can have the
values <tt>ses</tt> or <tt>reset</tt>, depending whether one has pressed 
the red protruded EzSetup button or the other button. The variable
<tt>$ACTION</tt> can have the values 'pressed' or 'released', depending on what
happened to the button. Variable <tt>$SEEN</tt> contains the number of
seconds since the last button event.  We will use it to distinguish short
versus long button presses. These variables will play a prominent role in
the script that we will briefly describe now. At the top of the <tt>handler</tt>
script the state variable is read, which keeps track of the
station. It also assigns the station addresses to variables <tt>CHX</tt>.
Then, we check that the EzSetup button named 'ses' has been activated; the
following section runs only if the button is released.  If we didn't
check for either 'pressed' or 'released', the script would run twice,
once when the button is pressed, and once when released.  By checking the
release event, we can distinguish between short and long button presses,
because the <tt>$SEEN</tt> variable is reset to zero at both events. If
<tt>$SEEN</tt> is zero, less than a second has elapsed between button 
pressed and released. Once inside the if statements, we kill any active
<tt>wget</tt> process, since we can listen to only a single station at a
time. </p>

<p>
The associated <tt>madplay</tt> process also gets killed, because the
parent process is gone. Then we check the <tt>$SEEN</tt> variable, and set
the <tt>$STATE</tt> variable to a value that will cause the following case
statement to reach a state that turns the radio off. The case statement
itself is used to cycle through the stations: if the state is '0', it will
start station 1, and so forth. In each case section, first a short mp3 sound
file gets played to identify the station. On my desktop computer, I recorded
myself saying 'Channel one', and converted the recording to a mp3 file named
<tt>ch1.mp3</tt> and copied the files via 'scp' to the router, but anything
can go here.  You could, for example, extract the jingle of the radio station
and put it in a file. Playing this short identifier is just an aid to
figuring out which radio station has been selected. This is followed by the
construction with wget piped into madplay, discussed above, and the state
variable gets incremented by one. I use five stations to cycle through, and
the last section just tells me that the radio is off and does not receive
data from the Internet.
</p>

<p>
The construction with the <tt>handler</tt> script provides basic
functionality to step through a set of pre-selected radio stations, 
but changing these stations still requires logging on to the router
and editing the configuration files by hand.  We remedy that
deficiency in the next section.
</p>

<h3>Changing Stations</h3>

<p>
The router already sports a Web server to support the LuCI configuration
interface. All served files are located under the directory <tt>/www/</tt>,
and even cgi-bin functionality is supported if one places executables in
directory <tt>/www/cgi-bin/</tt>. This means that we can use a Web browser
to run programs on the router &mdash; cool, eh? Just make certain that the
router is accessible only from a trusted network.
</p>

<p>
First, however, we have to prepare a Web page to tell us what the five
current radio stations are. The following script excerpt does that.
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #!/bin/sh
    # file: /www/cgi-bin/radio.cgi

    echo 'HTTP/1.0 200 OK'
    echo 'Server: Netscape-Communications/3.0'
    echo 'Content-type: text/html'
    echo

    ch1=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch1)
    ch2=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch2)
    ch3=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch3)
    ch4=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch4)
    ch5=$(uci get radio.@radio[0].ch5)

    header='&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Radio Channels&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
    &lt;H1 ALIGN=CENTER&gt;Radio channel selection&lt;/H1&gt;'

    echo $header 
    
    echo '&lt;FORM action="setchannel.sh" method="get"&gt;'
    echo -n 'Channel 1: &lt;input type="text" name="ch1" size="80" value="'
    echo -n $ch1; echo '"&gt; '
    echo '&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;'
    echo '&lt;/FORM&gt;'

                          :

    echo '&lt;FORM action="setchannel.sh" method="get"&gt;'
    echo -n 'Channel 5: &lt;input type="text" name="ch5" size="80" value="'
    echo -n $ch5; echo '"&gt; '
    echo '&lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"&gt;'
    echo '&lt;/FORM&gt;'

    echo '&lt;FORM action="commit.sh" method="get"&gt;'
    echo '&lt;input type="submit" value="Make persistent on Router"&gt;'
    echo '&lt;/FORM&gt;'

    echo '&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;' 
</pre>

<p>
I just omitted a few copies of the five-line <tt>FORM</tt> statement
for channel 2, 3, and 4, but the complete script is
available <a href="misc/ziemann/radio.cgi">here</a>. The script must
be made executable (<tt>chmod +x radio.cgi</tt>) and placed
in <tt>/www/cgi-bin/</tt>. Pointing your desktop computer's Web
browser to
<tt>192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/radio.cgi</tt> will show a Web page with five
lines, where the radio stations are shown, and each line has a button on
the right with 'Submit' written on it. (See screen shot, below.)
</p>

<p>
The idea is to change the radio station's address in the text
area, and press the submit button to update the router's setting. Precisely
that is part of the radio.cgi script's functionality. Note that the script
gets executed under cgi-bin, which implies that all script output, normally
written to standard output, must be redirected to the calling Web browser.
In the script, all output therefore gets generated by an <tt>echo</tt>
command. The first few lines prepare the standard header all Web browsers
expect, and then variables <tt>chX</tt> get filled with the station
addresses. Then, HTML header information gets defined and written by an
echo command. 
</p>

<p>
The next five lines define a form containing the text field with the
station address, that is already filled with the current address. This is
followed by the submit button definition. In the FORM definition's first
line, the <tt>action="setchannel.sh"</tt> portion defines a program that
must reside in the router's cgi-bin directory to receive the contents of
the text field -- the station address -- if the submit button gets pressed.
Please consult any book on HTML about how HTML forms and cgi-bin work in
detail; for example, Ref. <a id="ziemann.html_7_back"></a><a
href="#ziemann.html_7">[7]</a> or <a id="ziemann.html_8_back"></a><a
href="#ziemann.html_8">[8]</a>.  The final three-line <tt>FORM</tt>
statement is used to execute the router's <tt>commit.sh</tt> script to make
the variables persistent across router reboots.
</p>

<img src="misc/ziemann/channel_selection.png" ALT="channel selection screenshot">

<p>
The receiving end of the main FORM construction is the
<tt>setchannel.sh</tt> script, which must be made executable (<tt>chmod +x
setchannel.sh</tt>) and likewise placed in <tt>/www/cgi-bin/</tt>. A copy
is shown below:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #!/bin/sh
    # file: /www/cgi-bin/setchannel.sh
    decode(){
    echo $QUERY_STRING |\
       sed 's/+/ /g'| sed 's/\%0[dD]//g' |\
       awk '/%/{while(match($0,/\%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]/))\
       {$0=substr($0,1,RSTART-1)sprintf("%c",0+("0x"substr(\
         $0,RSTART+1,2)))substr($0,RSTART+3);}}{print}'
    }
    TMP=$( decode )
    CHAN=${TMP%=http*}
    URL=${TMP:4}
    uci set radio.@radio[0].$CHAN=$URL
    echo "Setting Channel $CHAN to station $URL"
</pre>

<p>
A copy for download is available <a href="misc/ziemann/setchannel.sh">
here</a>. In this script we first define a function to undo the URL
decoding imposed on the variables sent by the <tt>FORM</tt> in script
<tt>radio.cgi</tt>. I adapted a script found at
Ref. <a id="ziemann.html_9_back"></a><a href="#ziemann.html_9">[9]</a>
to decode the <tt>QUERY_STRING</tt> and then a little shell scripting
to extract the channel and URL.  A final <tt>uci set</tt> command sets
the variables on the router.  Note that this sets radio station
addresses only in the router's memory. In order to make them
persistent, we need to execute a <tt>uci commit radio</tt> command
using the <tt>commit.sh</tt> script, reproduced below:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #!/bin/sh
    # file: /www/cgi-bin/commit.sh
    uci set radio.@radio[0].state=0
    uci commit radio
    echo 'Channel selection made permanent on Router'
</pre>

<p>
We see that it only initializes the state variable to the initial value
zero, and then executes the commit script and echos what it did to the
calling Web browser.
</p>

<p>
Using the presented interface, it is possible to change the desired radio
stations' addresses, and make them persistent.  Selecting one of the five
stations, or turning the radio off, is then easily done by using the
rear-panel red button. Our router is now permanently placed in the kitchen,
and is used to play music from Internet radio stations.
</p>

<p> Of course, a router with USB connectivity is a magnificent device for
further activities. One could, for example, consider attaching a Bluetooth
dongle (see Ref. <a id="ziemann.html_10_back"></a><a
href="#ziemann.html_10">[10]</a>), and use a Bluetooth-capable cell 'phone
to control radio station selection.  I discuss how to do that on the 'phone
in Ref. <a id="ziemann.html_11_back"></a><a
href="#ziemann.html_11">[11]</a>.  Including the Internet radio control
features into the LuCI interface would also be a nice project. But you, dear
reader, will certainly come up with other fun ways to use a marvelous box
such as a router with USB.  </p>

Of course, I could buy a commercial off-the-shelf Internet radio, but what is the fun in doing that?  On the other hand, I could buy a Linux-based wireless router with USB, connect a USB sound card to it, and have fun making the whole enchilada work in a (moderately) user-friendly way, such that other members of the family can also use it. In order to make the project reasonably lightweight and manageable over a summer break I decided to avoid hardware modifications (as much fun as that may be) or the installation of large software packages like perl on the router.  Almost all programming is done with shell scripts. </p> ';
