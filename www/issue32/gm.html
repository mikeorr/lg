<IMG SRC="../gx/hammel/t.gif" ALT="T" HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=26 ALIGN=LEFT>his column
is dedicated to the use, creation, distribution, and discussion of computer
graphics tools for Linux systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, there were quite a
few announcements in the past month and I'm finding that not all are being
cross posted to both comp.os.linux.announce and to freshmeat.net.&nbsp;
It takes a little more diligence on my part to catch all the announcments,
but since I visit both places fairly often it really isn't that big of
a problem.&nbsp; On the other hand, is it really necessary to repeat those
announcements here?&nbsp; I thought about this for a while, and finally
decided it is worth the effort since both c.o.l.a and freshmeat are sites
for general announcements and the graphics-specific items can easily be
overlooked.&nbsp; By gathering them up and reprinting them here, I can let
my readers worry less about missing the important stuff through the sea
of other announcements at other sites.
<P>I've finally started to catch up on my Musings, too.&nbsp; This month's
issue includes discussions on:
<UL>
<LI>
Managing your CGI Perl scripts using "require" in <I>Web Wonderings</I></LI>

<LI>
A closer look at the libgr package of image file format libraries</LI>

<LI>
A little fun with the Gimp plugin "QBist"</LI>
</UL>
I also considered taking a look at Blender, but I'm not certain my system
is stable enough for that right now.&nbsp; It's been acting a little strange
of late - I'm beginning to think some recent power outages may have corrupted
some libraries.&nbsp; I have plans to upgrade to Red Hat 5.2 whenever it
comes out (I expect the difficulties with dealing with libc/glibc will
all be worked out, much like the 4.2 release had worked out most of the
a.out vs. ELF issues), plus take a look at Xi Graphics Maximum CDE at some
point too.&nbsp; But I hadn't planned on doing either until the October
time frame.&nbsp; I may have to change my plans.
<P>Anyway, a review of Blender is a definite future Musing.&nbsp; The last
time I tried it, the program seemed to be stable, but the interface is rather
complex.&nbsp; A general examination showed that this modeller is quite
feature-rich.&nbsp; It's just that the interface is not intuitive to a 3D
newbie, perhaps not even to an experienced 3D graphic artist.&nbsp; A better
set of documentation is reported to be on the way, due out some time in
September.&nbsp; I'll wait and see what this might offer before stepping
up for a review of Blender.
<P><IMG SRC="./gx/hammel/gm-new.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 HEIGHT=216 WIDTH=225 ALIGN=RIGHT>You
can also keep an eye out for a new and improved Graphics Muse Web site
coming soon.&nbsp; I expect to be able to launch the new site sometime
in the middle to end of September.&nbsp; It will combine the Linux Graphics
mini-Howto with the Unix Graphics Utilities into a single searchable database,
provide recommended reading material and allow you to post reviews of software,
hardware and texts, plus it will provide more timely news related to computer
graphics for Linux systems.&nbsp; And, of course, all the back issues of
the Graphics Muse column from the Linux Gazette will be there too, in a
semi-searchable format with topics for each month provided next to the
links to each month's issue.&nbsp; I'll probably post an announcement about
it to c.o.l.a when it's ready.

<B><I><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">ParPov</FONT></I></B> is a free (GNU), object-oriented
library written in C++ for parsing Scene Files from the Persistence of
Vision (POV-Ray) Ray-Tracer. It will read a scene written using version
1-3 syntax and creates a structure of C++-Objects, representing all details
of the original description. You can query those objects and use the information
to convert the scene to other formats or many other uses. <B><I><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">Pov2Rib</FONT></I></B>

TKMatman</H2>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">TKMatman</FONT></I></B> is a tool that lets
you interactively set and adjust parameters to RenderMan shaders and preview
images with the given parameters. It can handle surface, displacement,
interior, exterior, atmosphere, light and imager shaders and their combinations.
The idea for the program comes from Sam Samai, who wrote the very useful
IRIX version. With the availability of the Blue Moon Rendering Tools for
different platforms the author of TkMatman thought that a lot more people
will use the RenderMan interface and need ways to select their shaders.
That's why he published his private LINUX version of MatMan. The program
was initially only meant for his own use, but it is in a pretty stable
state now.&nbsp; All feedback is appreciated and new versions will be made
available at the following site:&nbsp;

RenderPark</H2>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">RenderPark</FONT></I></B> is a photo-realistic
rendering tool being developed at the Computer Graphics Research Group
of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, in Belgium. The goal is to offer
a solid implementation of many existing photo-realistic rendering algorithms
in order to compare them on a fair basis, evaluate benefits and shortcomings,
find solutions for the latter and to develop new algorithms that are more
robust and efficient than the algorithms that are available today. RenderPark
will offer you several state-of-the-art rendering algorithms that are not
yet present in other rendering packages, not even in expensive ones. Allthough
RenderPark is in the first place a test-bed for rendering algorithms, it
is evolving towards a full-featured physics-based global illumination rendering
system.

I save it in the .gif format file.&nbsp; At that point the shadow in my
image immediately disappears and the text seems to lose its anti-aliasing.
Can anyone shed some light on to this?</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
A: <A HREF="mailto:Simon.Budig@unix-ag.org">Simon Budig</A> responded:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yes. Gimp can only handle 1-bit transparency in indexed color
mode. So when you convert an image to indexed the different levels of transparency
will get lost. There is the great "Filters/Colors/Semiflatten" plugin.
It merges all partially transparent regions against the current Backgroundcolor.
Select a BG-Color (i.e. matching to the BG-Color of your Web-page) and
watch the effect of the plugin. Then you can convert your Image to Indexed
and save it as GIF. (GIF can also handle just 1-bit transparency).</BLOCKQUOTE>

Managing your Perl scripts:&nbsp; using 'require'</H2>
<A HREF="http://www.graphics-muse.org/muse/aug98/gm.html">Last month</A>
we talked about accessing an mSQL database from CGI scripts using Perl
with two modules:&nbsp; CGI.pm and Msql.&nbsp; In the example described
there, we built a couple of HTML tables and embedded some text stored in
a table in an mSQL database.&nbsp; It turns out that generating HTML using
CGI.pm is quite simple, and using Perl with the Msql module makes combining
your HTML output with information from a database really rather painless.
<P>But that example was extremely simple.&nbsp; Real world examples often
have dynamic pages that are built from multiple databases.&nbsp; And each
page often links to other dynamically built pages that provide some, or
even all, of the same information from those databases.&nbsp; In other
words, parts of each page contain the same HTML formatting and data.&nbsp;
How can you avoid having to duplicate that HTML in each page?
<P>With older static page development methods, there really weren't any
methods for including common regions into multiple pages unless you used
frames.&nbsp; The frames allowed you to create a region on the browser
display that would be a single page of HTML that could be displayed along
with various other pages.&nbsp; In this way, you need only maintain a single
copy of that one common page.&nbsp; From a Web developer's point of view,
this was an ideal situation - it meant the probability of error in trying
to update identical HTML in multiple pages was eliminated.&nbsp; It also
meant less work.&nbsp; But to readers of those pages it could mean frustration,
since not all browsers at the time supported frames.&nbsp; Even now, frame
handling is not consistant between the two main browsers, Netscape Navigator
and Microsoft's Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Although frames can be used to
produce some terrific Web pages, they are not the ideal solution for supporting
different browsers, especially older browsers.
<P>Fortunately, this problem can be overcome with our new friend Perl.&nbsp;
The method for inclusion in multiple pages of common formats and data is
simple.&nbsp; However, the management of these common regions takes a little
thought.&nbsp; Let's first look at how to include Perl code from different
files in your main Perl script.
<P>In Perl, a subroutine or other piece of common code would be written
in a <B><FONT COLOR="#006600">module</FONT></B>, a separate file of Perl
code.&nbsp; Modules can be included at any point within a Perl script.&nbsp;
By default, Perl looks at a special variable called <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>@INC</FONT></TT>
to determine where to find these modules.&nbsp; Also by default, the current
working directly, ".", is listed in the <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>@INC </FONT></TT>variable
as the last directory to search for modules.&nbsp; <B>Note</B>:&nbsp; <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>@INC</FONT></TT>
is a list variable, that is, it is an array of strings with each string
being the name of a directory to search for modules.
<P>To include a module into your main Perl cgi script you would use the
require function.&nbsp;&nbsp; The format is simple:
<UL><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>require 'modulename.pl';</FONT></TT></UL>
This function tells the Perl interpreter to include the named module, <I>but
only if it has not been included previously</I>.&nbsp; In this way you
can include the same module multiple times without worry that doing so
will cause serious problems.
<P>When the module is included, the code within it is run at the point of
inclusion.&nbsp; You can, if you so desire, write the module to have code
that runs right then and there using variables with a global scope (i.e.,
they are visible to the original program as well as the included module).&nbsp;
However, it would probably make more sense to write the module as a subroutine
call instead.&nbsp; You can still use globally scoped variables, but by
making the module a subroutine call, you can guarantee the code is not run
until you specifically request it.&nbsp; You can also run it more than
one time if you want.
<P>So how do you make a subroutine?&nbsp; Just wrap the code inside the
following construct:
<UL><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>sub subname {</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>}</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>1</FONT></TT></UL>
The 1 at the end is important - modules must include this or else the require
function will fail.&nbsp; Now invoke the subroutine with the following
command:
<UL><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&amp;subname();</FONT></TT></UL>
The ampersand is important - you should always prefix calls to your subroutines
with the ampersand.&nbsp; Although things may work properly if you don't,
proper Perl syntax suggests the results can be unexpected if you don't
use the ampersand.
<P>If you want to pass parameters into the subroutine, you can do so as
a list.&nbsp; For example:
<UL><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&amp;subname("one item");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&amp;subname("one item", "two items");</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&amp;subname(@listitems);</FONT></TT></UL>
To access the command line arguments in the subroutine, you can do something
like the following:
<UL><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>sub subname</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>{</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; # @_ contains all parameters to the
subroutine.</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; # We first assign these to the @params
variable because the variable</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; # name "@params" is a bit more intuitive
than "@_".</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; @params = @_;</FONT></TT>
<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; foreach $arg (@params)</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; {</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # now run through
each parameter one at a time</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # and process it.</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if ( "$arg" eq ""
)</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; }</FONT></TT>

libgr - A collection of image libraries</H2>
Many users of graphics tools discussed in this column will find that those
tools are dependent on any number of file format specific libraries.&nbsp;
For example, the Gimp needs libraries for JPEG, PNG, PNM, MPEG and XPM
in order to support these file formats.&nbsp; The Gimp doesn't understand
how to read these files directly - it is dependent on the image format
libraries for assistance in reading and writing files in these formats.&nbsp;
Since the Gimp (and other tools) don't include these libraries in their
source distributions, users are often required to retrieve and install
these libraries manually.&nbsp;
<P>Normally, users would download format-specific libraries and build them
separately.&nbsp; Each of the formats mentioned earlier, plus a few others,
are available somewhere on the Net in source format.&nbsp; Most are available
somewhere on the Sunsite archives.&nbsp; Unfortunately, not all of these
format specific libraries are easily built on Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Gimp
User Mailing list is often flooded with questions about how to get the
JPEG library to build shared libraries.&nbsp; By default this library doesn't
build a Linux ELF shared library.&nbsp; In fact, even with the proper configuration
it still only builds a.out shared libraries.&nbsp; A better solution is
needed.&nbsp;
<P>Enter <B><I><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">libgr</FONT></I></B>.&nbsp; This is
a collection of image format libraries that have been packaged together
and organized to easily build and install on Linux systems.&nbsp; The package
builds both static and ELF shared libraries automatically.&nbsp; The distribution
is maintained by Neal Becker (<A HREF="mailto:neal@ctd.comsat.com">neal@ctd.comsat.com</A>)
and is based on the work done originally by Rob Hooft (<A HREF="mailto:hooft@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE">hooft@EMBL-Heidelberg.DE</A>).&nbsp;
The latest version, 2.0.13, of libgr can be retrieved from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ctd.comsat.com:/pub/linux/ELF">ftp.ctd.comsat.com:/pub/linux/ELF</A>.&nbsp;
<P>Libgr contains the following set of graphics libraries:
<UL>
<LI>
fbm</LI>

<LI>
jpeg</LI>

<LI>
pbm</LI>

<LI>
pgm</LI>

<LI>
pnm</LI>

<LI>
ppm</LI>

<LI>
png</LI>

<LI>
rle</LI>

<LI>
tiff</LI>
</UL>
It also contains the <I>zlib</I> compression library which is used specifically
by the TIFF and PNG graphics libraries.&nbsp; It may also, although I'm
not sure of this, be used by the FBM library to (at a minimum) support
the GIF format.&nbsp;
<P>FBM is the Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation library.&nbsp; This package is
related to, but not part of, the PBMPlus package by Jef Poskazner.&nbsp;
The library can read and write a number of formats, including:&nbsp;
<UL>
<LI>
Sun rasterfiles&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
GIF files&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Amiga IFF&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
PCX&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
PBM&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Face files (CMU format for 1bit files)</LI>

<LI>
FBM&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Utah RLE files (from the Utah Raster Toolkit)</LI>
</UL>
It also supports quite a number of image operations, all of which are described
in the <I>Features</I> text file in the fbm directory.&nbsp; Like PBM,
FBM is a format designed specifically by the FBM library author for handling
images internal to the library (although you can write that format to a
file too).&nbsp;
<P>JPEG is actually a standard that defines a suite of encodings for full-color
and continuous-tone raster images<SUP><A HREF="#footnote-1">1</A></SUP>.&nbsp;
The software for this library, which is essentially the same as the software
that comes in the standalone JPEG library package found on the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gimp.org/pub/gimp/libs">Gimp's
ftp site</A>, comes from the Independent JPEG Group and, as far as I can
tell, supports the complete JPEG definition.&nbsp; JPEG is a common format
for the Web since it is one of the formats listed by the WC3 in the early
HTML specifications for Web images.&nbsp;
<P>The PBM, PGM, PNM, and PPM formats are all part of the NetPBM/PBMPlus
packages.&nbsp; These formats are often used as intermediary formats for
processing by the NetPBM/PBMPlus tools.&nbsp; Although these libraries
provide the capability of saving image files in these formats, I have not
seen this as a common practice.&nbsp; This is probably due to the fact
that the files tend to be rather large and the image formats are not generally
supported by non-Unix platforms.&nbsp; These formats are widely supported,
however, by Unix-based graphics software.&nbsp;
<P>The PNG library supports the relatively new Portable Network Graphics
format.&nbsp; This format was designed, at least in part, to replace the
GIF format which had both licensing as well as a few format limitations.&nbsp;
PNG is now an officially supported format by the WC3 although support for
these images is not commonly mentioned by either Netscape or MSIE.&nbsp;
I'm not sure if either supports PNG yet.&nbsp;
<P>RLE is Run Length Encoding, a format from the University of Utah designed
for device independent multilevel raster images.&nbsp; Although the format
is still in use today, you won't see it referenced often in relation to
tools like the Gimp (though the Gimp does support the format) or 3D rendering
engines like BMRT or POV-Ray.&nbsp;

<TD VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>Finally, the TIFF library is a set of routines for
supporting the reading and writing of TIFF files.&nbsp; TIFF files are
popular because of their wide support on multiple platforms (Mac, MS, and
Unix) and because of their high quality images.&nbsp; However, they tend
to be extremely large images since they do not use any form of compression
on the image data.&nbsp;
<H3>
Building the package</H3>
Once you have retrieved the libgr package you can unpack it with the following
command:&nbsp;
<UL><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>% tar xvzf libgr-2.0.13.tar.gz</FONT></TT></UL>
This will create a directory called libgr-2.0.13.&nbsp; Under this directory
you will find the format specific directories, Makefiles and a number of
text files.&nbsp; In the INSTALL text file you will find instructions on
how to build the software.&nbsp; For Linux this is a simple process of
typing&nbsp;
<UL><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>% make most</FONT></TT></UL>
which will build all the software but not install it.&nbsp; I recommend
doing this once to test that the build actually completes successfully
for all directories before trying to install anything.&nbsp; If the build
fails and you attempt to install you may confuse yourself as to what has
and hasn't been installed correctly.&nbsp; After the build completes, check
each directory and see if the lib*.so files - the shared libraries - have
been created.&nbsp; If all appears to have gone well, type&nbsp;
<UL><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>% make install</FONT></TT></UL>
This will install the libraries for you.&nbsp; There are other options
available for building and installing.&nbsp; Read the <I>INSTALL</I> text
file in the top level directory for details on the other options.&nbsp;
<P>At this point you're ready to use these libraries with other tools,
such as the Gimp.&nbsp;
<H3>
Why use libgr vs the individual libraries?&nbsp;</H3>
Libgr provides support for a large range of image file formats, but it
doesn't support every common and/or popular format.&nbsp; So why use it
instead of the individual format libraries?&nbsp; One reason is convenience.&nbsp;
Instead of having to retrieve a whole slew of packages you can grab one.&nbsp;
Second, as mentioned earlier, not all of the individual packages are setup
to build proper ELF shared libraries for Linux.&nbsp; Libgr is specifically
designed for building these type of libraries.&nbsp;
<P>What libraries does libgr not include that you might want?&nbsp; One
fairly common X Windows format is XPM.&nbsp; Libgr does not support this
format so you'll need to retrieve the XPM library separately.&nbsp; Fortunately,
most Linux distributions already come with this library prebuilt and available
to you during installation of the operating system.&nbsp;
<P>Libgr also does not support any animation file formats.&nbsp; If you
have need to read or write files in MPEG, FLI or FLC formats, for example,
you will need to locate and install those libraries individually.&nbsp;
<H3>
Caveats</H3>
One minor caveat to using the libgr package exists with the zlib distribution.&nbsp;
According to the documentation for libgr (in the <I>NEWS</I> text file)
the zlib release numbers went <B>down</B> at some point.&nbsp; This means
it's possible for you to have an older version of zlib installed even though
its version number is higher than the one in libgr.&nbsp; How to resolve
this is a tricky question but in my opinion it makes sense to install the
zlib that comes with libgr because it's known to work with the rest of the
image libraries in the libgr package.&nbsp; If you agree with this logic
then you will probably want to remove the old version of zlib first, before
doing the <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>make install </FONT></TT>for libgr.&nbsp;
<P>
<H3>Summary</H3>
<P>Libgr is not a drop-in replacement for all your image file format needs,
but it does offer added convenience to the Linux users by providing a Linux-specific,
easy to use build and install environment.&nbsp; Since the libraries included
in the libgr package do not change all that often it makes good system
management sense to deal with the one distribution than to try to deal
with updates to multiple image format packages.&nbsp; And if you're dealing
with building the Gimp, which requires many image libraries, libgr is a
much simpler solution to get you up and running in the least amount of
time and with the least amount of frustration.&nbsp;
