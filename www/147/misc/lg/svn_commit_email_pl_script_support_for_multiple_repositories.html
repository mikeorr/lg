<p>
Folks,
</p>

<p>
I have got a subversion repository running on  /svn
</p>

<p>
Under that there are different directories /svn/a/aa ,/svn/b/bb like that.
</p>

<p>
I would like to send a mail to a group of ppl when the checkin happens in only /svn/a/aa this directory and sub dirs
</p>

<p>
I used post-commit script hook supplied with svn.
</p>

<p>
in that I added a line like
</p>

<pre>
$REPOS/hooks/commit-email.pl "$REPOS" "$REV"  -m "*aa*" britto@yahoo.com  --diff "n" --from "ppl@mycom.com"
</pre>
this is not working.
</p>

<p>
-m makes the support to multiple project and it accepts regex as an argument.
</p>

<p>
whatever i have provided any thing wrong.........
</p>

<p>
This is not following link also doesnt help
</p>

<p>
Are you sure that the script hook actually knows what '$REPOS' is? Try
it with the full path and see if that works. You should also test
'commit-email.pl' by running it manually and seeing if it does what you
need. You should also check the permissions on the hook script.

&gt;    -m makes the support to multiple project and it accepts regex as an
&gt;    argument.

<p>
If it accepts a regex, then '*aa*' is going to fail: it uses a
quantifier (*) without a preceding atom (i.e., you've used globbing
instead of a regex.) A working regex for the above would be '.*aa.*' -
although that definition (just like your original one) is too broad, and
should be defined better.

<p>
The thread doesn't appear to be related. "Doesn't work" isn't a
sufficient diagnostic.
