I was stunned that some of it looked exactly like Esperanto:
</p>

<p>
tamen : however
ventus: would have vented (though "ventumus" is traditional for this)
virga: virgin (adjective)
per: by means of
pro: because of
transporto: transportation
-is : (past tense verb)
-us: (conditional tense verb)
vesti (dropping r): to clothe
tenis (dropping u): held
</p>

<p>
I've heard that "tamen" came from Latin but this here's proof.  I
think "sed" (but) also comes from Latin.
</p>

<p>
Taking the English and making it grammatical results in this Esperanto:
</p>

<p>
Mi tre sxatas ambaux intencojn, tamem mi volvas verdan brancxeton
mallargxe margxene. Dankon pro prezenti tion cxi!  Kiel mi povos sendi
al vi monon por via viagxo?
</p>

<p>
Translating that back into English makes:
</p>

<p>
I much value both intentions, however I wind a green twig
narrow-marginly [1].  Thanks for rendering this!  How can I send you
money for your journey?
</p>

<p>
[1] That means as little in Esperanto as it does in English, but I
don't know what else "very a thin margin" means.
</p>

<p>
I had some trouble with "render" in the computer sense because there
was no obvious equivalent.
realize: realigi
draw: desegni
make: fari
present/introduce: prezenti
But these didn't sufficiently express "make a copy from prepared
instructions" as opposed to making something original.  But one of
Webster's definitions for "render" is "to reproduce or represent by
artistic or verbal means : depict", which is one of the meanings of
"prezenti" so I went with that.

Why? From what I recalled, and as confirmed by Wikipedia, Esperanto is
"...a language lexically predominantly Romanic... the vocabulary derives
primarily from the Romance languages." Seems like the most probable
projection of what you'd get when comparing the two languages is exactly
what you got.

Most of the vocabulary comes from <strong>modern</strong> Romance languages.  Some
stuff does come directly from Latin ("post" being the most common),
but it's rare enough that it's an oddity.
</p>

<p>
Zamenhof was pretty random in sometimes choosing words in their
ancient form (post = after, patro = father), sometimes with French
idiosyncracies (preta = ready, instead of presta), and sometimes with
German idiosyncracies (lasi = to let, instead of lati), for no
apparent reason.  I'm sure there are Russian idiosyncracies too though
I can't think of any off the top of my head except:
</p>

<p>
    okopniki = to be a vicious pirate on the high seas
    perle okopniki = to do the same while using Perl, or in a
Perl-like manner (e.g., shouting Haiku at your enemies)
