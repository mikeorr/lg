<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
Please pay attention to unmounting script in "Mounting and umounting" section:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
==================
#!/bin/sh
 
umount /backup
lvremove backuplv
vgremove cryptvg
cryptsetup remove crypt1
cryptsetup remove crypt2
==================
</pre>

<p>
Commands `lvremove backuplv` and `vgremove cryptvg` will remove logical volume 
and its volume group. It is not unmounting but ~erasing~
</p>

<p>
I knew nothing about lvm while reading your article so I deleted important 
data while running 'unmounting' script blindly.
</p>

<p>
Please correct the article.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>

<p>
Andrej
</p>

I don't recall the precise context but I suppose that should have been
<pre>
	lvchange -an backuplv
	vgchange -an cryptvg
</pre>

I think both work. I just checked my backup server (which runs Debian
Etch). It has both commands.
</p>

<pre>
shinare:~# which lvremove
/sbin/lvremove
shinare:~# which lvchange
/sbin/lvchange
shinare:~#
</pre>

<p>
The commands are symlinked to "lvmiopversion".
<pre>
shinare:~# ls -l /sbin/lvremove
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 2006-11-24 23:40 /sbin/lvremove -&gt; lvmiopversion
shinare:~# ls -l /sbin/lvchange
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 13 2006-11-24 23:40 /sbin/lvchange -&gt; lvmiopversion
shinare:~#
</pre>
"lvmiopversion" is part of the lvm-common package. Maybe I should have
mentioned this detail since other distributions might use a different
scheme.
</p>

<p>
Best wishes,
Ren&eacute;.

Just because the underlying binary is the same does not mean that the
functionality is the same!
</p>

<p>
"lvchange -an" and "vgchange -an" mark the corresponding logical
volume (respectively volume group) "inactive".
</p>

<p>
One can reactivate them using "-ay" instead of "-an".
</p>

<p>
On the other hand "lvremove" and "vgremove", remove the logical
volume (respctively volume group). This means that one must re-create
these. In the process, the logical volume make get assigned entirely
different blocks and so the original data is lost. The volume group
will also get re-initisalised so that all logical volume metadata
associated with the volume group will be lost.
</p>

<p>
As a practical example do the following.
</p>

<p>
Setup:
</p>

<pre>
1. Create a volume group (say on a loopback device based on a large
file).
2. Create a logical volume on that volume group.
3. Create a file system on that logical volume.
</pre>

<p>
Test with lvchange/vgchange:
</p>

<pre>
1. Run "lvchange -an" on the logical volume.
2. Do various things which do not involve that logical volume for
example create more logical volumes in the same volume group.
3. Run "lvchange -ay" on the original logical volume.
4. Run fsck on the original logical volume.
5. Do the same tests with "vgchange".
</pre>

<p>
Test with lvremove and vgremove:
Do 1-5 above with these commands in place of the "change" commands.
</p>

<p>
I expect you will see file-system errors in the second set of tests
but not in the first set of tests.
</p>

You are absolutely right. I think I wasn't awake yet when I wrote my

<p>
This is very crucial and I really should have mentioned this. I only
used test volumes for the preparation of my articles and I think I would
have tested more thoroughly if I had worked on volumes containing
valuable data.

<p>
Yes, I think you will.

Best regards,
Ren&eacute;,
who also advises to triple check the device mappings prior to
initialising an encrypted storage device. XFS doesn't like it when you
shuffle its inodes with cryptsetup on the block device where a
filesystem is mounted. "Use the --force!" isn't always  good advice. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
