<p>For the past few years I've used internal modems, but I still miss the
flickering lights on the first modem I ever used, an external unit which
seemed fast at the time.  One of these lights indicated incoming data-packets
while another showed the outgoing.  The advantages of these inobtrusive
lights were that they didn't occupy screen real-estate and they could be monitored
with peripheral vision.

<p>Recently Matthew Bevan released a new version of NetLED, a small utility
which monitors any of several interfaces such as PPP, SLIP, or ethernet using
the keyboard's light emitting diodes (LEDs).  This is a great idea, since
these LEDs aren't particularly useful in their native state.   I've never had 
any use for the Caps Lock key, or its LED; I like to have that key generate
the Escape key key-code (easing VI mode-switching), which leaves its LED open
for alternate uses such as NetLED.

<p>NetLED is a tiny program (meant to be run as a daemon) which can be left
running even when a network interface is inactive.  The command syntax is
simple:<br>

<p><kbd>netled [console] [interface]</kbd><br>

<p>As an example, I use it to monitor activity on a dial-in PPP
connection:<br>

<p><kbd>netled console ppp0</kbd><br>

<p>The <b>console</b> parameter, if just &quot;console&quot; is specified,
allows the LEDs to flash on all consoles, while <b>ppp0</b> tells the program
to monitor the first PPP device.  Substitute <b>eth0</b> in order to monitor
the first ethernet device.

<p>A strongly worded warning in the README file encourages the user to follow
the recommended syntax:<br>

<pre>
     NOTE: DO NOT PREPEND /DEV/ TO ANY OF THE DEVICES!!!
     I MOCK ANYONE WHO ASKS ME HOW TO FIX THEIR COMPUTER
     WHEN THEY ARE DOING THIS!

     PROPER: netled console lo
     NOT: netled /dev/console /dev/loop0
</pre>

<p>I'm curious as to the nature of the dire consequences implied by this
warning, but not curious enough to try it!

<p>NetLED can be started manually (I've aliased&nbsp; <kbd>'netled console ppp0'</kbd> 
&nbsp;to &nbsp;<kbd>'led'</kbd>) or it could be started in either an init script or as an
addition to a PPP start-up script.

<p>If you would like to try it out, the source code can be obtained from this
