Hi,
</p>

<p>
I am working on a  project of making a small OS which will boot up on
my dual core machine and will serve as a simple calculator. If its
possible I would like to add GUI to it too.
</p>

<p>
My question is for this job do I need to program all the stuff as
assembly code or is there a way in which the precompiled linux kernel
or those "boot.img | initrd.img" can help me without having to go
through assembly development?
</p>

<p>
If its possible I would be glad if you tell me how I can achieve this.
</p>

<p>
Thank You.
</p>

<p>

There is no more reason for such a project than a project that takes
a rolls-royce jet engine and uses it to move at 20Kmph! The only
difference perhaps is that your project is possible but the jet
engine one is not!

<p>
You can certainly configure Ubuntu to boot up by default into an X
session with Emacs running the "ess" front-end to "R" which can do far
more than any "calculator" I ever met could.
</p>

<p>
You could replace "R" with "octave" or "scilab" as well.

Oh, we humans excel at inefficiency. E.g., the parasitic computing
concept:
</p>

<p>
<a href='http://www.nd.edu/~parasite/'>http://www.nd.edu/~parasite/</a>
</p>

<p>
Now, all that aside - if you actually want a ridiculously overpowered,
remove-the-fly-from-your-friend's-forehead-with-an-axe solution, I'd
suggest exploring the "memtest" boot option available on many Linux live
CDs. It boots just enough Linux to run "memtest" - which seems like
something you could use.
</p>

<p>
There's also the option of looking at the few remaining "Linux on a
floppy" versions. You could configure one of those to start some sort of
a command-line calculator - say, "bc" or "dc" - and call it a done deal.
This is possibly the simplest answer of all.

<p>
 From your email, it is difficult to see what your goal is.
</p>

<p>
If your goal is to build a "simple calculator", then your plan to develop 
a "small OS" or utilize an existing "precompiled linux kernel" is a drastic 
overkill.
</p>

<p>
OTOH, if your goal is to write a "small OS", then you will have to spend some 
time defining what facilities you want this "small OS" to provide, before you 
start.
</p>

<p>
If you are just looking for a pre-existing "small OS" that you can boot up on 
your system, then there are a vast number of choices available to you, 
including Minix (a great way to learn OS design and development), Xinu, and a 
large number of small Linux distributions.
</p>

<p>
If you are asking whether or not a "small OS" /requires/ that all code be 
assembly language, then the answer is "no". Unix-like operating systems are 
typically developed in a high-level-language (C, actually) with a small 
amount (probably around 5%) of assembly language to deal with the low-level 
hardware. Applications (like your "calculator") and facilities (like 
your "GUI") are typically 100% high-level-language.
</p>

<p>
My recommendation would be to spend some time learning about how operating 
systems and application programs are developed. A /really/ good place to 
start would be the Minix OS, which is a simplified Unix environment written 
specifically for use as an educational tool in learning OS development.

Actually memtest86, which I assume is run by the memtest boot option[1], 
doesn't load any Linux at all.

I didn't realize that - but that would make it all the more suitable for
Abhishek's purposes. A stub loader that rolls over to an application
seems like exactly the thing he's asking for.
