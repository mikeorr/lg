<p>
Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I'm currently trying out a new anti-spam regime on my machine; it's a
sea-change from what I've been trying up until now (SpamAssassin, etc.)
I'm tired of "enumerating badness" - i.e., trying to figure out who the
Bad Guys are and block them. Instead, I've hacked up a procmail-based
challenge-and-response system.
</p>

<p>
The operation of this gadget isn't all that complicated:
<pre>
0) Copy all emails to a backup mailbox.
1) Archive mail from any of my bots, list-reminders, etc.
2) Deliver mail from any lists I'm on.
3) Dump any blacklisted senders.
4) Deliver any whitelisted ones.
5) Check headers to see if it's actually from me; deliver if so...
6) ...and dump any remaining email purporting to be from me into /dev/null.
7) Mail that doesn't fit the above criteria gets held and the sender is
notified of this. If they respond to this verification message, they
automatically get added to the whitelist. Held email automatically get
dumped when it's a month old.
</pre>

<p>
So far, over the past few hours since I've implemented this, it seems to
be working fine: zero spam (once I tuned #5/#6 a little more), and the
valid messages seem to be coming through just fine. I'm still watching
it carefully to make sure it doesn't blow up in some odd way, but so
far, so good.
</p>

<p>
In about a month - depending on where I am and a number of other factors
- I just might write this up. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Having to manually go through and
delete 500-1500 emails per day... I'm just totally over that.
</p>

In related news the spam-l mailing list is going through another thorough 
trashing of the challenge-response idea. it's also regarded as a bad idea by 
most posters on the mailop mailing list. I don't claim expertise, but the 
arguments pro and con are all here <a href='http://spamlinks.net/filter-cr.htm'>http://spamlinks.net/filter-cr.htm</a>.
</p>

<p>
My own personal anti-spam technique of choice is greylisting. It lets some 
spam through, but not enough to be a big deal and it doesn't get people hot 
under the collar in the way that challenge-response seems to.

I use a combination of Postfix options, greylisting, DSPAM and
SpamAssassin. DSPAM is a superb tool for filtering:

</pre>

<p>
I'm pretty familiar with those arguments; in fact, much of the reason
that I hadn't implemented CR years before was based on them. However,
decisions of this sort are rarely (if ever) binary: there are a number
of factors that go into making them, and many of these factors vary with
time, etc. In this case, I had to weigh the fact that some sysadmins/
individuals might be annoyed enough that they'll block my mail against
the literally hundreds of hours that I've so far wasted dealing with
spam, and the hundreds (or thousands) more that I'd be wasting if I
didn't implement something truly effective.
</p>

<p>
As I've mentioned, at this point, I'm getting 500-1500 emails per day,
with a maximum of 20-25 of those messages being non-spam. Despite the
best that SpamAssassin can do, even with Bayesian filtering, training,
and user prefs configured to the max, I'm still getting a flood of spam
in my inbox. The thing that makes it all completely untenable, and
prevents me from "playing by the rules" as espoused by all the
self-proclaimed anti-spam experts on lists of whatever description, is
that I have
</p>

<p>
a) A relatively slow, fragile, connection to the Net (sometimes, I have
none at all; this is, in fact, the case right at this very moment);
</p>

<p>
b) no control over/root access to my incoming mail server.
</p>

<p>
Game over. See, every single one of the wonderful solutions proposed by
the boffins starts with, "first, obtain a spherical cow..." (a mail
server that I can configure attached to an always-on high-speed net
connection.) Well, I don't have a spherical cow. Based on the way that
I've chosen to live (aboard a cruising sailboat), I have no way to feed
and house a spherical cow. Therefore I <strong>CANNOT</strong> implement any of their
wonderful, brilliant, and above all, non-geek-annoying solutions.
</p>

<p>
I've been looking for one for, oh, some ten years now, with no success;
as far as I can tell, a solution that takes my case into account does
not exist. So, I've been putting up with losing - again, let me
emphasize - <strong>hundreds</strong> of hours of my productive time - of my life - to
handling spam. This, mostly, because the Great Spam Council has decreed
that this is what I'm supposed to do.
</p>

<p>
The time has come for me to say, Blow THAT For A Game Of Soldiers.
</p>

<p>
(Nothing against you, Neil; this is just my whole point and/or rant on
the subject. Thanks for bringing it up, though. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; spam through, but not enough to be a big deal and it doesn't get people hot 
&gt; under the collar in the way that challenge-response seems to.
</pre>

<p>
I've looked at a number of greylisting solutions; none of them work for
my situation.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to be refining my CR setup - e.g., I'm going to keep a
database of addresses to which I've sent verfication emails, and will
not respond to them more than, say, once per week if they haven't been
whitelisted; this should eliminate the "backscatter spam" argument.
Perhaps I'll also limit the total number of verfication emails sent to a
given address; after all, if someone hasn't responded after, say, three
tries, chances are, they're never going to. I'm also going to tweak my
MUA so that all the recipients from my outgoing emails will get
automatically added to the whitelist.
</p>

<p>
Other than that - well, some people just chuck verification emails; too
bad for them, I guess. I don't propose to spend my time coddling their
preferences while they choose to get huffy about mine.

I've thought about doing that; essentially using GMail as a filter. That
is, setting up all my .forward files to point to it, then just collect
my mail from them. I might yet do that if this CR test doesn't prove out
in one way or another.
</p>

<p>
GMail, of course, brings its own raft of problems - e.g., the privacy
issues, etc. The thing is, I don't know that the average user [1] can
afford to have that kind of scruples. <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">((
</p>

<p>
I don't like thinking that way... because for many people, that's the
slippery slope to staying with Windows. "What do you mean, I have to
learn to do things a new/different way to use Linux? I can't afford the
time; I've got a business to run."
 
</p>

<p>
[1] In this respect, I unfortunately have to place myself in that
category - since it appears that you do indeed need to have your own,
erm, spherical cow to have any chance of battling spam on your own.

Use Gmail to manage your grey list, everything that you've whitelisted
is handled as normal. Everything else goes to Gmail. As you add every
recipient of a reply to your whitelist, only one email gets sent to
Gmail.

That sounds rather intriguing, although I'm not really clear on the
details (I'm having trouble parsing that last sentence, for some
reason.) Let me see if I have it right:
</p>

<p>
1) Set up procmail to dump blacklisted email, route whitelisted email
directly to me, and forward anything that remains to GMail.
</p>

<p>
2) Retrieve mail from GMail, and auto-add anything that they've passed
through to the whitelist.
</p>

<p>
3) Optionally, once in a while, pull down the "Spam" folder from GMail
and add it to the blacklist.
</p>

<p>
How did I do?
</p>

Sorry, I'm not clear on what you mean. The problem is that I'm having to
spend lots of hours dealing with spam, and C/R handles that.

<pre>
&gt; Might a better vhost solve the problem? 
</pre>

<p>
"Better" in this case meaning "more expensive" - well, yes, it would
solve one problem... while creating another. I really don't see paying a
hundred bucks a month for a dedicated vhost just so I can solve my spam
problem. At that point, using either C/R or GMail seems like a huge
win.
</p>

<p>
I guess my underlying premise here is, "I've got Linux. I've got pretty
good programming skills. Why can't I have an inexpensive, relatively
easy, <strong>effective</strong> anti-spam solution?" It just doesn't seem right.
</p>

&gt; The last time anyone got some spam past my vhost was over a week ago.

<p>
Perhaps I'm missing a Large Clue somewhere, then - despite all my study
on this subject. Could you describe, in more or less general terms, how
your greylisting setup works?

&gt; "Better" in this case meaning "more expensive" - well, yes, it would
&gt; solve one problem... while creating another. I really don't see paying a
&gt; hundred bucks a month for a dedicated vhost just so I can solve my spam
&gt; problem. At that point, using either C/R or GMail seems like a huge
&gt; win.

<p>
OK, vhost was the wrong term, I have a hosted email setup that costs me about 
?15 p.a.

<p>
I leave the details to my email host. It allows me to tune a few 
details like the spam score at which I reject and the use of different 
blacklists. I have some fairly aggressive blacklisting and it all just works.

&gt;&gt;  &gt;  I've thought about doing that; essentially using GMail as a filter. That
&gt;&gt;  &gt;  is, setting up all my .forward files to point to it, then just collect
&gt;&gt;  &gt;  my mail from them. I might yet do that if this CR test doesn't prove out
&gt;&gt;  &gt;  in one way or another.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  I was going to suggest this as a potential solution, with one minor change:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;  Use Gmail to manage your grey list, everything that you've whitelisted
&gt;&gt;  is handled as normal. Everything else goes to Gmail. As you add every
&gt;&gt;  recipient of a reply to your whitelist, only one email gets sent to
&gt;&gt;  Gmail.
&gt;
&gt; That sounds rather intriguing, although I'm not really clear on the
&gt; details (I'm having trouble parsing that last sentence, for some
&gt; reason.) Let me see if I have it right:
&gt;
&gt; 1) Set up procmail to dump blacklisted email, route whitelisted email
&gt; directly to me, and forward anything that remains to GMail.
&gt;
&gt; 2) Retrieve mail from GMail, and auto-add anything that they've passed
&gt; through to the whitelist.
&gt;
&gt; 3) Optionally, once in a while, pull down the "Spam" folder from GMail
&gt; and add it to the blacklist.
&gt;
&gt; How did I do?
&gt;
&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Pretty good Ben.
</p>

<p>
Only one point to make - I wouldn't auto-add everything that GMail 
passes. Some rare spam does get past the GMail filters.
</p>

<p>
My last sentence does need some explanation in the cold light of day.
</p>

<p>
You expressed some concerns over the privacy of emails passed through 
the GMail servers. My thinking was this:
</p>

<p>
Given that you already add every recipient of an email from you to your 
whitelist, and that every email conversation that you have will pass 
through your whitelist and not be delivered to GMail.
</p>

<p>
If someone writes to you for the first time, their email gets passed to 
the GMail account, passes the spam filter and waits in the inbox for 
your reply. At this point GMail only holds one email in an email chain, 
all subsequent emails will be caught by your whitelist and will not be 
sent to GMail at all. Thus the effect on your privacy is limited to the 
initiating email. Would that represent a minimal intrusion on your privacy?

<p>
I'm finding that with the C/R system, getting a single piece of spam is
actually OK: I can instantly see how it got in, and move that address
from the 'allow' to the 'deny' database. I can't think of an easy way to
first vet and then add all the GMail-filtered emails to the whitelist -
so perhaps this is still a pretty good approach, especially if I have
a macro in my .muttrc that moves an entry from the whitelist to the
blacklist.

I see what you mean; that makes a lot of sense. Sure, that does
alleviate some of my concerns.
</p>

<p>
The only thing I'd have to figure out is how to sync everything between
my mail server (where the mail triage is going to happen), my machine
(where the spam/ham decisions are going to be made), and GMail. Hmmm...
have to give that some thought.

I couldn't resist adding some more grist ;-)
</p>

<p>
You can either collect the emails using GMail's POP and IMAP interfaces 
or have GMail forward the emails on to you.
</p>

<p>
Both options allow you to delete emails remaining on GMail's servers if 
you wish. Spam will be left at GMail for them to look after, and you get 
the greylist free of cruft.
