I would like to say, yes, please someone help.... thought maybe a reply
would motivate someone a little more to write a article on this.

<P> 
I liked your comment about quilting being an interest. We tend to forget
that people have interests outside of computers in general (and linux in
particular).
<P> 
Just like to say thanks for what is obviously an enormous effort you are
putting into the gazette. I'm new(ish) to linux and I find it a great
resource, not to say entertaining.
<P> 
Has anyone suggested an article on the use of Xresources? As I said I'm
fairly new and find this a bit confusing... maybe someone would be
interested in an example or three?
<P> 
Oh and with the quilting and geometry ... better make sure its not the
80x25+1-1 variety.
<blockquote> <I> 
(Thanks, LG is a lot of work, as well as a lot of fun. And yes, I do have

Great Resource,
<P> 
	I really like the resource Linux offers new users. I have already
applied a few tricks to my PC. I wish some one would explain how to use
the GNU C/C++ compiler with Linux. It is a tool resting in my hard
drive. With commercial compilers, there is a programming environment
that links libraries automatically. Are there any tricks to command line
C/C++ programming with Linux?? Stay online!

Hi,
<P> 
I have been so far unsuccessful in finding information for InfraRed 
support on Linux.
<P> 
I am particularly interested in hooking up Caldera Linux on a Thinkpad 560 
using Extended Systems JetEye Net Plus.  Caldera on Thinkpad I can handle 
but the JetEye allows connection to ethernet or token ring networks via IR.
<P> 
My searches of Linux Resources page come up negative.
I have posted to USENET and also emailed any web master that has any mention 
of ThinkPad or IR on their pages. Still no answer.
<P> 
Can you help me to find information.  If I am successful, I would be 
willing to write an article about it.
<P>

<P> 
Hi there,
<P> 
First I have to apologize for writing to this address with my problem, but I
don't no where to search for an answer and university's network is so
damned slow that surfing through the net searching for an answer makes no fun.
Another reason is that I've got no access to Usenet... means can't post in 
comp.os.linux.networking... 8-((
<P> 
I tried to find a news server near to Germany which allows posting without 
using that damned -> identd <- but found none, may be you know where to find 
a list with (free) news servers ?
<P> 
Here's the problem: <BR> 
I want to setup Linux in our University's LAN but ran into problems, because 
the LAN is VINES-IP based so that normal TCP/IP packet drivers won't work.
The admin says I do need a driver which can tunnel the normal Linux TCP/IP 
packets into those VINES-IP packets, so that they can be send over the LAN to 
that box which has Internet connection....
<P> 
Maybe you know if such thing is available and/or where I can get it.
Or maybe you can give some Email-addresses for asking people which real 
knowledge 'bout Linux (maybe even that of Linus T. himself) and it's drivers.
<P> 
Hope you can help me 8-))
<P> 
Thanks in advantage <BR>

<P> <I> 
I did a search of LG, LJ and SSC's Linux Resources using VINES as the
keyword. I found only one entry from an author's biography. It's old --
March 1995 -- and the guy was in the marine corp then so may or may not
be a good address. Anyway here's what it said:<BR>

There is one problem I had that may apply to you. Are you throwing away
previous issues and only getting the current one? If so, I apologize
most humbly. I was not aware until this month that people were doing this
and when I made the tar file I included only new files and those that had
been changed since the last month. To correct this problem I put a new
tar file on the ftp site called standard_gifs.html. It's not that I've
forgotten how to make http-ready distributions, it's that I'm just learning
all the complexities. In the future I will make the tar file to include
all files needed for the current single issue, whether they were changed
or not.</I>

<P> 
I run at a resolution of 1152x846 (a bit odd I suppose) and although the
Gazette pages look very nice indeed, it is a bit hard to read when I
have my Netscape window maximized.  The bindings part of the background
seems to be optimized for a width of 1024 and thus tiles over again on
the right side of the page.  This makes reading a bit difficult as some
of the text now overlaps the bindings on the far right.
<P>  
I'm not sure if that's a great description of the problem, but I can
easily make you a screenshot if you want to see what I mean.
<P> 
Anyhow, this is only a minor annoyance--certainly one I'm willing to
live with in order to read your great 'zine.  :)

<P> 
Hi,
<P> 
This is just to let you people know, that there might be a slight problem.
I want to point out and make it perfectly clear that this is NOT a
complaint. I feel perfectly satisfied with the Linux Gazette as it is.
<P> 
However sometimes I prefer to have a printed copy to take with me.
Therefore I used to print the LG. from Netscape. I'm using the new 3.1
version now. With the last two issues I have difficulties doing so.
All the pages with this new nice look don't print too well. The graphics
show up at all the wrong places and only one page is printed on the paper.
The rest is swallowed. Did you ever try to print it?
<P> 
I had to use an ancient copy of Mosaic, that doesn't know anything about
tables, to print these pages. They don't look too good this way too, and
never did. I know this old Mosaic is buggy. At least it doesn't swallow
half of the stuff. This could as well be a bug in Netscape.
I know next to nothing about html.
<P> 
Anyway, have fun.<BR> 
Regards Friedhelm
<blockquote> <I> 
(No, I don't try to print it, but will look into it. Are you printing out
&quot;The Whole Damn Thing&quot; from the TOC or trying to do it page by page?
It is out there in multi-file format and so if you print from say the Front Page,
the front page is all you'll get. &quot;The Whole Damn Thing&quot; is one single file 
containing the whole issue, and the spiral and table stuff are removed so it 
should print out for you okay. Let me know if this is already what you are
printing, so I'll know where to look for the problem. --Editor)

Well, Hi there!
<p>
Amazing. I've just read the Linux Gazette from the first issue to this
one, the 12th (actually I read just the first 7 issues through, because
the others were not downloaded correctly).
<p>
It's 4 in the morning and I'm enthusiastic. I knew Linux was good, I'm
using it for a year (this is because of the lack of my english grammar,
I mean the previous sentence, well...), so I knew it was good, but I
didn't expect to see something so nice like this Gazette.

It's good to see that there are a WHOLE LOT of people with huge will to
share.

I think we owe You a lot of thanks for starting it.

I have lots of bandwidth to read your site. I noticed that you have

Subject: <b> One-shot downloads </b><br>
From: David M. Razler, david.razler@postoffice.worldnet.att.net

Folks:
<p>
	While I realize that the economies of the LINUX biz require that  there
be some method of making money even on the distribution of free and
"free" software, I have a request for them of us who 1) are currently
scraping for the cash for our Internet accounts and 2) would like to try
LINUX.
<p>
	How about a one-shot download? I mean, oh, everything needed to
establish a LINUX system in one ZIP'ed (or tar/gz'd, though zip is a
more compatible format) file, one for each distribution?
<p>
	I'm currently looking to establish LINUX on my "spare" PC, a 386DX-16
w/4 meg and a scavenged 2500MB IDE drive, etc. It will be relatively
slow, limited, lacks a CD-rom drive, but it's free, since the machine is
currently serving as a paperweight.
<p>
	I could go out and buy a used CD-rom for the beast, or run a bastard
connection from my primary, indispensable work machine and buy the CDs.
But I am currently disabled and spending for these things has to be
weighed against other expenses (admittedly, I am certainly lucky and not
destitute, it would just be better)
<p>
	I could get a web robot and download umpteen little files, puzzle them
out and put them together, though the load on your server would be
higher.
<p>
	Or, under my proposed system, I could download Distribution Code,
Documents, and Major accessories in one group, then go back for the
individual bits and pieces I need to build my system.
<p>
	Again, I realize that running your site costs money, and that people
make money, admirably little money, distributing LINUX on CDs, with the
big bucks (grin) of LINUX coming in non-free software, support and book
sales.
<p>
	But if the system is to spread, providing a series of one-shot
downloads, possibly available only to individuals (I believe one could
copyright the *package* and require someone downloading to agree to use
it only on a single non-commercial system and not to redistribute, but I
am not an intellectual properties lawyer), to make life easier for them
of us who need to learn a UNIX-style system and build one on the cheap.
