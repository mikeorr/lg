I have been a windows users forever, and I got tired of the constant
crashing so I have just installed <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 5.2 on my laptop.  I travel
the world in the telecommunications business.  I haven't had one crash
since installing Linux.  My problem is low resolution on the LCD screen
when running Xwindows.  Under windows my screen has an 800 x 600
resolution.  The best resolution that I can get when installing Xfree is
600 x 480.  This is using the probing feature of the installation.  I
know there must be a way to sharpen the characters an icons.  However
with my limited knowledge I can't seem to find the answer.  Please help
or direct me to someone who can help solve this simple problem.

Personally I find X to be unusable until you can get
up to about 1024x768.  However, I rarely use any GUI
so when I <EM>need</EM> one I need it to be pretty good.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(When I use Netscape change the "icon" bar to text
only, and tweak as many of the setting to "unclutter"
the window frames as possible.  Then I size it to
almost completely fill my current screen --- with the
virtual screen panner peekout out above it.  That's
set to 3x2 --- so I can get to any of the three "top row"
screens with just a click and to any of the others with
two --- right click on the app title bar to "bury it"
then the whole panner is available).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, back to your question.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You don't give any details about your laptop.  So,
I can't give any specific suggestions.  However I
can give some general ones.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
First look in the Laptop Support Pages:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><code>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop"
	>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop</A>
</code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... This lists a few hundred models of laptops and
provides details about the installation and use of Linux
on them.  Its an all-volunteer effort (like most of the
best projects in Linux) so the reporting can be a bit
uneven.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, look up your model of laptop in that database ---
or the closest that you can find.  Also read through
some of the entries for some other laptops (more or less
at random) so you can some idea of general problems and
common solutions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of the common problems with many laptops is the use
of the Neomagic chipset.  This is a proprietary chipset
for which programming specifications are not openly
available.  Luckily there is a free binary-only XFree86
"server" for it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since you are new to Linux, and presumably Unix and X as
well, I'll digress for a moment to clarify a point of
terminology that causes greate confusion:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote>
The X Window System is a communications protocol.
You have a "display server" (consisting of one or
more "screens" a mouse and/or sensor tablet and a
keyboard) and a set of clients (various programs
that request operations, such as the drawing of
windows on the screen, or the reporting of mouse
and keyboard events).  The clients can be run
locally (as most of us do with most of our Linux
boxes most of the time --- where the client program
is running on the same system as the server) or it
might be running remotely (communicating over TCP/IP
on port 6000 or so).  In either event the client
and server communicate through the X protocol over
some sort of networking channel (unix domain or
TCP/IP sockets).
</BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, the software driver that responds to video requests
for the "clients" (Netscape Navigator, xterm, GhostView,
etc) is referred to as a "server."  Thus we have different
servers for different video cards.  Technically I think
that there would be different server for different
combinations of mouse, keyboard and video cards --- but
I think that the XFree86 implementation has been able to
consolidate the keyboard and mouse support into a common
set of libraries --- so only the video chipset support is
sufficiently different between systems to warrant different
drivers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
While looking at Kenneth Harker's laptop support pages
you should also look in the documentation for your
laptop (or contact the manufacturer and beat it out of
their support staff).  You want to know the video
chipset (such as the CT65545 from "Chips and Technologies").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is a whole section of KHarker's pages devoted to
general info about XFree86 on laptops (for Linux and
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> users, et al).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Finally, if these free resources fail you --- consider
a commercial solution.  There are at least two companies
that provide commercial X servers for Linux.  Since XFree86
is pretty good --- these companies specialize in laptops
and proprietary video cards that won't play nice with the
freeware programmers.  (Naturally, it would be better for
the free software and alternative OS communities to
refrain from buying such hardware --- but some of us get
stuck with what we've got, so...).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So the two sites I'd check are:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>
MetroLink Inc.  (publishers of Metro-X)
<DD><A HREF="http://www.metrolink.com"
	>http://www.metrolink.com</A>
</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><DL><DT>
Xig (formerly X Inside Graphics)
<DD><A HREF="http://www.xig.com"
	>http://www.xig.com</A>
</DL></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... and, of course, you can check the latest
info on XFree86 by browsing around on its web site
at:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote><code>
<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org"
	>http://www.xfree86.org</A>
</code></BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Its possible that your copy of X can drive your video
card just fine even though the autodetection code doesn't
do it.  Unfortunately X configuration for those cases is
still a bit of a black art (more art and magic than
science).
