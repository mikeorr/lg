Is there a mechanism that enables MS apps to run under Linux?  Is anyone
working on an autoloader for Linux?

There are a few projects.  The most prominent is
WINE (<A HREF="http://www.winehq.com">http://www.winehq.com</A>).  
The goal of WINE is a complete re-implementation of the Windows API's 
to achieve full binary compatibility under any x86 Unix with X Windows 
(Linux is the predominant platform but any other modern x86 Unix 
should be a reasonable platform for WINE).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another is Bochs (which has recently moved it's web pages
to <A HREF="http://www.bochs.com">http://www.bochs.com</A>).  Bochs 
is a package which emulates an x86 CPU and PC chipset (similar to 
<a href="http://www.connectix.com/">Connectix</a>' "Virtual PC").  
It runs on any platform that can compile its C sources.   I've heard 
that it works reasonably well but is to slow for production use 
(for running Win 95 or 98 on a PC).  Considering that you're using a 
PC to emulate a full PC CPU and chipset this is not a surprising 
limitation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For older MS Windows applications  (3.1 and earlier) you
might try WABI --- a commercial Windows Applications Binary
Interface which is available for Linux from 
<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>
(<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com">http://www.caldera.com</A>).  
This is not be updated and is unlikely to ever support Windows '95 
or later applications.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For DOS (non-Windows) you can run a copy of MS-DOS, DR-DOS
FreeDOS or just about any other "real mode" x86 OS under
the Linux '<tt>dosemu</tt>'.  (Just search for it in Yahoo!
using "<tt>+linux +dosemu</tt>").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><em>
	[ Its home page is hosted by SuSE ...
	<a href="http://www.suse.com/dosemu/"
		>http://www.suse.com/dosemu/</a> ... 
	I use it to run dBase stuff and it works pretty well
	at this point. --&nbsp;Heather&nbsp;]
</em></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The DOS support is pretty good these days, though I don't
use any MS-DOS applications any more so I don't have much
first hand experience with it.  The WABI support was pretty
fast (it felt faster running typical Windows 3.x programs
under Linux than it did under native MS-DOS on similar
hardware --- probably do to Linux more efficient filesystem
and memory management).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When thinking about the limitations of Linux support Win '9x
and NT applications support (Win 32S) it is helpful to keep
in mind that these limitations are almost certainly a key
design goal at Microsoft.  Although Linux was not on thier
"radar" during the design of Windows '95 and NT --- OS/2
certainly was.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Enmeshing the interfaces at various levels to make
applications difficult or impossible to support under
competing operating systems is one of the key strategies
that Microsoft employs.  The current DoJ case against them
is only a tip of the backlash that consumers are now
directing to this monopoly.  The fact that Linux
installation tripled in the last year --- and that many
organizations are now considering Linux for their desktop
applications platform is ample evidence of that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
* (personally I think it's still a bit premature
to be touting Linux as typical workers desktop
system --- though the introduction of Corel's
WordPerfect for Linux, and the release of an
updated Wingz Professional for the platform
do certainly bode well for the coming year.
I've heard that Applixware 4.4.1 is also
greatly improved and the next version of
StarOffice 5.x should stabilize and mature that
suite.  Meanwhile <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>, LyX, and GNUStep
are plodding along towards "prime time"
availability).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So that fact that there is only limited support for MS apps
under Linux is a testimony to the skills of Microsoft's
programmers.  We can surmise that preventing these
applications from running on non-Microsoft operating systems
was given higher priority than robustness, security,
stability, integrity, or performance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Probably the only features that were given priority over
"trap the user" were those that would enable magazine
writers, and corporate purchasing agents to "review" the
products and feel that they had evaluated them with about 15
minutes to an hour of actual work time exposure.  This
forces the application programmer to put all sorts of
"features" onto menus, button bars, toolbars, icon ribbons,
and otherwise clutter the screens and windows.   This is an
endemic problem in commercial software --- it's written to
get reviews and make sales, not to satisfy long term users.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course an alternative to direct MS Applications support
is support for their document formats.  However this is
another of those key "customer trapping" opportunities.
They do everything short of strong (non-exportable)
encryption to lock your data into .DOC, .XLS, and .PPT
formats.  The latest Linux applications suites and word
processors are making some headway in this --- and I can
often extract contents from Word '97 files without too
much fuss.  Earlier versions of Word are pretty well
supported at this point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can bet that the next version of Office will egregiously
break format compatability.  MS can't allow its customers
any freedom of choice or portability of documents to
"other" platforms.  That's much too dangerous to their
upgrade revenue scheme.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've talked about MS Windows support and the evils of
proprietary document formats before.  I personally think
that the only rational remedy for Microsoft's monopolistic
practices would be for the DoJ to impose a rule that MS
produce freely available (open source) "reference
implementations" of standards C source code to peform a
reasonable suite of conversions and manipulations on all
"documents" produces by their applications (including .EXE
and .DLL "documents" produced by their programming
"applications").  Under this plan any upgrade to any MS
product that failed compatibility test suites with there
freely available reference implementation (converters, tools
and filters) would result in an immediate injunction on
distribution until the reference implementation as updated
and vetted as compatible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Note that I didn't say that MS has to release any of the
sources to any of their products.  Only that they must
release some reference implementation that is compatible
with the file formats, and freely usable in competing
products --- free and commercial.  Their contention is that
their products enjoy superior market share as a result of
superior interface and integration with one another --- this
would give them a unique opportunity to prove that).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

I have no idea what you mean by an "autoloader for Linux."

OK. Guess I should have fully read your message before I
responded.  By the term "autoloader" I mean a self installing
function - you stick in the CD and Linux (or some other OS) sets
itself up. I wasn't aware that MS was already loading their user's
work (.DOC,. XLS, etc.) with gotchas. I wonder if the DoJ is aware
of and pursuing this?

There are several packages that will automatically
mount CD's (and floppies, NFS directories etc) for
Linux.  This is referred to generically (under Unix)
as "volume management" or "automounting" (the latter
term is more often used with regards to network file
systems while the former is exclusively used for
local media).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under Solaris there is a daemon called '<tt>vold</tt>' that
manages CD's.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under Linux you can use the '<tt>amd</tt>' (automount daemon)
or an old program called "<tt>Supermount</tt>" (Stephen Tweedie,
if I recall correctly).  Under newer Linux kernels you
can look for a module called "<tt>autofs</tt>".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I haven't played with these much so I can't give real
advice on using them.  However, you now have some key
words to search on.  If you get one of them working
in a way that seems like it would meet a typical
requirements scenario --- write it up as a mini-HOWTO
and solicit people to contribute sample configurations
and descripts for other common usage scenarios (or
at least write up an "unmaintained" mini-HOWTO and
encourage the readers to adopt and maintain it.

Although my ire against Gates, et al would like to see a good
platform running his apps that will probably be a moving target.
Better, I think, to develop a good set of apps that can work on
the docs that MS apps produce.  MSs response would have to be to
encumber a user's work with junk to make it incompatible with any
other apps.  The result of that could very well be disaster for
MS.  Could you imagine having your work suddenly become
incomprehensible because of the cute little things your app put in
it?

I don't have to imagine this scenario.  I've seen it
happen many times.

You are right on.  My appreciation of MS coincides with yours.  I wish I had
the time and the money to pursue that emulation of 95 and NT.  Even better
would be a good, competitive set of apps.  Corel's latest release for Linux
may indicate some movement in that direction.  TNX for your response. Happy
Xmas.

I've just installed Redhat. It is "auto loading".  I now have a problem
which Redhat and I must resolve. I'll write it up and post it when it's
corrected. To whit.. WIN95 now crawls along as if it had a bigger bag of
sand on it's back.  Re MS: I'd rather see MS broken up into two separate
companies. One doing APPS and the other doing OS.
TNX for responses.  HAPPY XMAS, MERRY CHANUKAH, SWINGING KWANZA
and JOYFUL RAMADAN.

I can't help with the Win '95 problem.  It's probably
confused about WINS (Windows Naming System) or some other
networking issue.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Re: Breaking up MS.  Historically this has done <EM>NO GOOD</EM>
with other monopolies.  Go read a decent historical account
and business analysis on JP Morgan  (and wash that down
with some Noam Chomsky).  I'd recommend a book for you
--- but I'd have to refer to my father to find one.  My
knowlege is definitely second-hand on this --- but I've
discussed it with a couple people whose background in
the fields of finance and history I respect.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Breaking them up is a fundamentally flawed approach. The
controlling interests -- the OWNERS will still be the same.
The resulting companies would clearly have mutual interests,
complementary product lines, and interlocking boards of
directors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfortunately this approach would "appease" the masses
and actually work in Bill G's favor (as it did with
JP Morgan).  It will allow the DoJ to appear competent
and be touted as a "tough on (corporate) crime" victory.
So, it's the most likely outcome.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's also just about the worst way to deal with the problem.
(It's even worse than sitting back and doing <em>nothing</em>)
since it sets another bad precedent.
