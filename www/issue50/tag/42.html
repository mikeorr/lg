sir,

<P><STRONG>
i am sangeeth george, doing my final year Btech.in
information technology.recently i came across a new
topic(which not actually a new one but i came to know
only recently)called "Daemons".since then i had been
fetching for materials to learn more about it.but i
couldn't find any worthy one.can u help me in getting
more info about this topic. i've got a lot of doubts
about it and i would like to share with you.some of
them are,

A daemon under UNIX (and some other operating
systems) is a program which runs in the background,
has no controlling terminal (is detached) and is
(under UNIX and Linux) in it's own process group.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Other than those (relatively minor and technical)
details it is just a program.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've heard that the term originally was 'dmon'
from Multics, or ITS or some other predecessor
to UNIX.  I guess it stood for "device monitor."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, since I'm on my <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> box, which has
a '<tt>dict</tt>' client, and a '<tt>dictd</tt>' (dictionary daemon)
and several freely available lexicons installed
I'll just yank in a definition from that:

From Jargon File (4.0.0/24 July 1996) [jargon]:
</STRONG></P>

<em><strong><font color="#000033"><br>  daemon /day'mn/ or /dee'mn/ /n./  [from the mythological
<br>     meaning, later rationalized as the acronym `Disk And Execution
<br>     MONitor'] A program that is not invoked explicitly, but lies
<br>     dormant waiting for some condition(s) to occur.  The idea is that
<br>     the perpetrator of the condition need not be aware that a daemon is
<br>     lurking (though often a program will commit an action only because
<br>     it knows that it will implicitly invoke a daemon).  For example,
<br>     under {{ITS}} writing a file on the {LPT} spooler's directory
<br>     would invoke the spooling daemon, which would then print the file.
<br>     The advantage is that programs wanting (in this example) files
<br>     printed need neither compete for access to nor understand any
<br>     idiosyncrasies of the {LPT}.  They simply enter their implicit
<br>     requests and let the daemon decide what to do with them.  Daemons
<br>     are usually spawned automatically by the system, and may either
<br>     live forever or be regenerated at intervals.
<br>
<br>     Daemon and {demon} are often used interchangeably, but seem to
<br>     have distinct connotations.  The term `daemon' was introduced to
<br>     computing by {CTSS} people (who pronounced it /dee'mon/) and
<br>     used it to refer to what ITS called a {dragon}.  Although the
<br>     meaning and the pronunciation have drifted, we think this glossary
<br>     reflects current (1996) usage.

It's obvious that the Jargon file and FOLDOC
entries are basically the same.  I believe that
the Jargon entry was adopted by FOLDOC.

1.It is possible for us to retrieve the commands
that   we have entered in a shell promptusing 'uparrow
key'.Is it due to the action of Daemons . if  yes,name
of that daemon?

What you're describing is a feature of some
of the common UNIX/Linux command shells.  It is
not done through any sort of daemon.

2. in one of the magazine i've read that Daemons are
much more powerful than TSR ,as Tsr need some user
intervention.is it true?can u give an eg. for that.

That is hogwash.  The old MS-DOS print spooler
TSR (terminate/stay resident) was about as close
to a daemon as you can get under MS-DOS (serving almost
the same function as the <tt>lpd</tt> line printer daemon
under Linux and the BSD UNIX').

3.surely there must be some kind of difference exsists
between ordinary programs and daemons in the
INSTALLATION part ,since daemons are executed by
system itself . can you explain me how to(where
to)install a program if we want it to act as a Daemon.
</STRONG></P>

No.  Daemons can be started by any user at
any time under UNIX.  A daemon is just a program
that detaches itself from it's controlling terminal
(by closing STDIN, standard input, STDOUT, standard
output, and STDERR, standard error file descriptors)
and using the<TT> setpgrp()</TT> system call to set itself
into a separate process group.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most daemons on most UNIX systems are started by
the init process (either directly, via <TT>/etc/inittab</TT>,
or through one of the rc*) scripts during the boot
process.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The most common daemons are:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>inetd:	<dd>"Dispatcher"  --- starts other
daemons in response to network connections
on well known service (WKS) ports as
specified in the <TT>/etc/inetd.conf</TT> and the
<TT>/etc/services</TT> files.
<dt>
sendmail: <dd>Handles SMTP, 
	<br>competitors: qmail and Postfix
<dt>
init:	<dd>"Father of all processes" --- it
starts all of the rc* scripts, and
it monitors all terminals, and consoles
forcing new getty and xdm processes
on them as login sessions are ended.
<dt>
httpd:  <dd>Web server daemon.
<dt>
cron:  <dd>Scheduler: this keeps a list of commands
to be run at given intervals.  cron performs
most of the routine system maintenance
<dt>
atd:	<dd>The at service used to be managed by
cron (there was a cron job that ran every
minute to execute any outstanding at jobs).
However, recently (a couple years ago)
at was set into a separate daemon in most
Linux distributions.  This is particularly
useful on laptops where the old method would
keep the disk drives spinning unnecessarily.
<dt>
lpd:	<dd>print spool server
</dl>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... et cetera.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

4.what really is the importance of Daemons in new
world (say E-commerce)?(i raised this question since i
may most probably take a seminar on this topic)
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

There is nothing special about daemons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
What is the importance of background jobs
in e-commerce and the "new world?"  They are
just programs.  Likewise for daemons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
