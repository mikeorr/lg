This is a small excerpt from the discussion thread at Linux Weekly New,
in response to LWN's news story about a "statement" posted at Microsoft
Corporation's Web site, claiming they are not, and never will be,
subject to the provisions of the GNU General Public License v. 3.

LWN is subscriber-supported, and well worth the minor expense.

<p>
Microsoft arranged for Novell to give GNU/Linux to anyone with an MS
voucher, and then proceeded to distribute those vouchers. Sounds like
distribution to me (with a middle man which isn't legally relevant).
</p>

<p>
According to the GPLv3 lawyers, they're "procuring the distribution of"
GPL'd software, and that requires permission from the copyright holder.
So Microsoft are either distributing under the permissions which the GPL
grants them, or they are violating copyright.
</p>

<p>
And, as I understand it, there's no time limit on those vouchers. Novell
might have to declare the deal non-applicable (and thus the "protection"
too) when they distribute GPLv3 software, or maybe Microsoft will have
to make that declaration.
</p>

<p>
In an eWeek article, they have a quote from "Bruce Lowry, a Novell
spokesperson" saying "Customers who have already received SUSE Linux
Enterprise certificates from Microsoft are not affected in any way by
this, since their certificates were fully delivered and redeemed prior
to the publication of the GPLv3".
</p>

<p>
So it sounds like Microsoft does not plan to be "distributing" GPL code
in this manner anymore, and that what has already been distributed is
protected the GPL's grandfather clause.
</p>

<p>
Well, that may not be a huge victory (Did anybody expect Microsoft to
suddenly give up on its patents or start GPL'ing its code because of
GPLv3 and the Novell deal ?), but it's something. It'll be interesting
to watch the GPLv3 / Novell deal interpretation match in the next few
weeks.

<p>
Quite. Moreover, this <em>does</em> affect preexisting software covered by the
Novell-Microsoft patent-shakedown agreement, too (not just future
releases under GPLv3), because a great deal of existing software in both
Novell SLES10/SLED10, per upstream licensors' terms, can be received by
users under GPLv2 or, at their option, _any later version_.
</p>

<p>
For that matter, Microsoft Services for Unix (nee Interix) is affected
in exactly the same fashion, because it, too, includes a great deal of
upstream, third-party code that users may accept under GPLv2 or any
later version.

<h3>SugarCRM goes to GPLv3</h3>

LWN has a new story (currently subscriber-only) about SugarCRM 
announcing that its upcoming 5.0 release of SugarCRM Community Edition
will be under GPLv3 (as opposed to the company's current badgeware
licence, this having been the firm that invented the concept).

<p>
*Is this a blunder, or just too subtle for me?*
</p>

<p>
Posted Jul 26, 2007 4:18 UTC (Thu) by subscriber rickmoen
</p>

<p>
I may be missing something, here, so I'm phrasing this in the form of a
question or two, and it's not rhetorical: Didn't FSF bow to pressure
from sundry interest groups and <em>remove</em> the "ASP loophole" language[1]
that had been present in some GPLv3 drafts? Therefore, what in Sam Hill
is a Software as a Service (Saas) / ASP / Web 2.0 firm doing adopting a
copyleft language whose copyleft language gets finessed by hosted
deployment?
</p>

<p>
FYI, there are a number of genuinely open source licences, a couple of
them OSI certified, that do apply copyleft obligations to the ASP
industry. One of the best is Larry Rosen's OSL, and there is also
Apple's ASPL, both of those being OSI-certified. Non-certified options
include Affero GPL (newly reissued as a patch to GPLv3, by the way) and
Honest Public License.
</p>

<p>
On the basis of recent history, it's possible that SugarCRM not only
lacks any clever, non-obvious reason why it picked a non-ASP copyleft
licence for ASP code, but also doesn't really have any idea what it's
doing in this area, and picked GPLv3 just because it has had good press
(good press that it generally deserved, IMVAO). Remember, this is the
firm that created the first MPL-based ASP licence, and then acted
shocked and indignant when it belatedly discovered that its licence
permitted forking (when TigerCRM of Chennai forked the codebase), and
overreacted by writing what became the prototype MPL + Exhibit B
"badgeware" licence that impairs third-party usage through mandated logo
advertising without a trademark licence.
</p>

<p>
It'd be more reassuring if I thought this firm had a master plan, but I
now rather strongly suspect it's just a bunch of sales people in an
office in Cupertino, staggering from one inadvertant move to the next.

<p>
There was something I annotated at the time of my svn checkin of
lg_bytes -- but just realised I should have ALSO put into the STATUS
notes.  (I'll bet in retrospect that nobody pays attention to svn
checkin comments.)
</p>

<p>
Howard had:
<pre>
  Red Hat Adds Business Solutions to Open Source RHX
 
  RHX launch partners include Alfresco, CentricCRM, Compiere,
  EnterpriseDB, Groundwork, Jaspersoft, Jive, MySQL, Pentaho, Scalix,
  SugarCRM, Zenoss, Zimbra, and Zmanda.
</pre>
Problem:  A bunch of those are JUST NOT OPEN SOURCE.  Zimbra, SugarCRM,
Compiere, Groundwork, and Scalix are classic "badgeware", which is under
MPL-variant software with some restrictions -- while with CentricCRM,
there's not even any room for controversy, since <em>their</em> licence doesn't
even permit code redistribution.  Jive Software (which I'd not heard of,
before) turns out to be equally bad.
</p>

<p>
I have brought this matter, several times, to Red Hat's attention, and
the presence of actively misleading wording on the Red Hat Exchange
site, such as this at the top of
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285:">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285:</a>  
<pre>
  Red Hat Exchange helps you compare, buy, and manage open source
  business applications. All in one place and backed by the open source
  leader. We've collaborated with our open source software partners to
  validate that RHX applications run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and are
  delivered through the Red Hat Network. At RHX, Red Hat provides
  customers with a single point of contact for support.
</pre>
There has been no response and no correction of this error, but the very
bottom of that page now has this "FAQ" item:
<pre>
  Are you only accepting open source ISVs into RHX?
 
  The initial set of participating ISVs all have an open source focus. We
  realize that there is debate about which companies are truly open
  source. To make it transparent to users, RHX includes information about
  each ISV's license approach. Longer term, we may introduce proprietary
  applications that are friendly with open source applications.
</pre>
That is, of course, anything but a straight answer.  First, it's
nonsense to speak of <em>companies</em> being open source or not -- and the
above paragraph in general ducks the question.  The issue is whether
software is.  Second, even if there were debate about the badgeware
offerings allegedly being open source, there could be absolutely none
about Jive Software's Clearspace or CentricCRM 4.1, which are
unambiguously proprietary.
</p>

<p>
I'm surprised that this Red Hat's deceptive characterisation got past
Howard without comment, given that the matter's been extensively covered
in recent _Linux Gazette_ issues.

Quoting Ashlee Vance (ashlee.vance@theregister.co.uk):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Rick, your explanation helped a great. Who are the main culprits of 
&gt; consequence besides Sugar?
</pre>

<p>
SugarCRM started the trend, and the other dozen-odd firms (Socialtext,
Alfresco, Zimbra, Qlusters, Jitterbit, Scalix, MuleSource,
Dimdim, Agnitas AG, Openbravo, Emu Software, Terracotta, Cognizo
Technologies, ValueCard, KnowledgeTree, OpenCountry, 1BizCom, MedSphere,
vTiger) literally copied their so-called "MPL-style" licence, with minor
variations.  MuleSource was for a long time a vocal backer of SugarCRM's
position (but see below).
</p>

<p>
Alfresco <em>used</em> to be a major backer of that position, but then suddenly
decided to shift to GPLv2, which is what they use now.  (They are no
longer a badgeware firm.)   Company spokesman (and OSI Board member, and
attorney) Matt Asay says he tried all along to convince them to do that,
and I do believe him.
</p>

<p>
SocialText (and especially CEO Ross Mayfield) has taken a lead online
role in trying to resolve the impasse -- though I personally find most
of what he says to be almost purely rationalising, and for him to be
mostly unresponsive to (or evasive of) substantive criticism.
</p>

<p>
MuleSource and Medsphere have, within the last few months, improved their 
respective MPL + Exhibit B licences (<a href="http://www.mulesource.com/MSPL/">http://www.mulesource.com/MSPL/</a> 
<a href="http://medsphere.org/license/MSPL.html">http://medsphere.org/license/MSPL.html</a>) <em>very</em> dramatically, in direct
response to criticism on OSI's license-discuss mailing list.  This work
seems to be that of attorney Mitch Radcliffe, and encouraged by
MuleSource and Medsphere Board member Larry Augustin (formerly of VA
Linux Systems).  I have great respect for this work, though I am still
trying to properly assess and analyse it.
</p>

<p>
(Disclaimer:  Larry is a friend of mine, though I see him only rarely,
and I once was employed at one of his firms.)
</p>


<p>
You should be made aware of the role of vTiger (of Chennai) in all of
this:  In August 2004, it forked and since then has offered
independently, under its own name and brand, an early version of the
SugarCRM codebase, plus various changes of their own devising.  It was
in response to that forking event, to which SugarCRM CEO John Roberts
responded very angrily at the time, that SugarCRM adopted the "Exhibit
B" restrictive licensing addendum that then became the hallmark of
badgeware licences generally.  See second post on
<a href="http://www.vtiger.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22">http://www.vtiger.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22</a> , and the matching
apologia at <a href="http://www.vtiger.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22">http://www.vtiger.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22</a> by
Christiaan Erasmus of badgeware firm ValueCard (South Africa).

[Forwarding Ben's private mail, with commentary, at his invitation.]
</p>

<p>
As a reminder, Centric CRM, Inc. has recently been one of the most
problematic of the ASP/Web firms abusing the term "open source" for
their products, in part because their flagship product (Centric CRM)
has been notorious during most of this past year as the <em>most</em> clearly
and unambiguously proprietary software to be offered with the ongoing
public claim of being "open source".
</p>

<p>
I'd call this (below-cited) PR campaign blitz -- apparently, they're
intensively hitting reporters known to be following this matter --
really good news, though it has to be read attentively:
<pre class="code">
o  Former OSI General Counsel Larry Rosen's "OSL 3.0" licence is a
   really good, excellently designed, genuine copyleft licence that is
   especially well suited for ASP use, because it's one of the very 
   few that have a clause enforcing copyleft concepts within the 
   otherwise problematic ASP market.  (In ASP deployments, there is
   ordinarily no <em>distribution</em> of the code, so the copyleft provisions
   of most copyleft licences such as GPLv2 have no traction, and are
   toothless.)  Also, as Centric CRM, Inc. is keen to point out, OSL
   3.0 is an OSI-certified open source licence.
  
o  At the same time, the careful observer will note that this 
   announcement concerns the product "Centric Team Elements v. 0.9",
   which is <em>not</em> (yet?) the firm's flagship product.  That flagship
   product remains the entirely separate -- and very, very clearly
   proprietary, product "Centric CRM v. 4.1", which one wryly notices
   has been carefully omitted completely from this communique.
 
   Just in case there is any doubt about Centric CRM 4.1's proprietary
   status, here's one key quotation from the product brochure, about
   the applicable licence, "Centric Public Licence (CRM)":  "The major 
   restriction is that users may not redistribute the the Centric CRM 
   source code."
</pre>
Now, it may be that the Centric CRM product is on the way out, and that
Centric Team Elements (with genuine open source licence) will be taking
its place.  Or maybe not.  Either way:  
</p>

<p>
The bad news, but perhaps not too bad, is that Centric CRM, Inc. has
spent this past year to date falsely and misleadingly claiming that its
product line is open source -- and deflecting critics by claiming that
the term "open source" is (paraphrasing) subject to redefinition and
needn't be limited to what OSI (inventer of that term in the software
context, and standard body) defines it to be.  That misleading and
deceptive language is still very much a prominent part of the company's
pronouncements to this day, remains on the Web site, and doesn't seem to
be disappearing.
</p>

<p>
The good news is that the firm appears to be sensitive to the public
relations problem it created for itself, and <em>may</em> be taking steps to
fix it.

Yup. And they are mostly unsuccessful ones. It's quite hard to
distinguish two cases:
<pre>
1) where your package is used for SaaS (like Google)
2) where your package is used for some private endeavour (like LWN)
</pre>
Licenses like AGPL/APSL punish equally - that's why I'll probably never
use AGPL/APSL-licensed software. And if I'll be forced to use such
software I'll do everything possible to not ever fix or change it. Even
badgeware is better from practical viewpoint. If you'll think about it
it's only logical.
 
Yes, usurpation of the code by SaaS vendors is a problem but AGPL is
worse medicine then disease itself...

and agreement to post my logo on your forehead. And by the way, I also
deny the premise that LWN is a "private endeavour" in any sense
meaningful to this context. Of course, Jon and co. happen to use their

&gt;Quoting Jamey Hicks (jamey.hicks@nokia.com):

&gt;&gt;There are no OSI-approved licenses for open source hardware, so I am

&gt;
&gt;My understanding is that OSI's licence approval process
&gt;(<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.html">http://www.opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.html</a>) is specifically
&gt;for <em>software</em> licences.  That scope limitation came up previously when
&gt;people proposed documentation licences for certification; I suspect the
&gt;same logic applies here.
</pre>

<p>
I'm afraid the distinction between "software" and "hardware" is  
getting harder and harder to make. The Verilog that's used to make  
the UltraSPARC T1 is definitely software, and the GPL (or any other  
Free software license approved for open source community use by OSI)  
seems 100% applicable to me.
</p>

<p>
If we allow special "hardware" licenses because the copyrighted work  
is used for that purpose, we are on a slippery slope towards many  
other specialist (an in my view redundant) sub-categories.

<p>
You know, there are circumstances in which I'd raise that point, too.  
However, I'd feel a bit silly raising it in circumstances where
something is described very unambiguously aas a licence specifically for
hardware _and used_ (or at least planned to be used) only for that
purpose, to a groups that certifies licences specifically for software.
</p>

<p>
(I do doubt that OSI would refuse to certify a licence actually <em>used</em>
for software, on no better grounds than it having the word "hardware" in
it.)

Hi Rick,
</p>

<p>
Just a quick note responding to your comment in the "More About RHX" 
section of RHX. We're working on a solution that will make the license 
approach used by each RHX software vendor very clear to users, including 
whether or not they are OSI-approved. I'd love to get your feedback on 
our approach if you have the time and interest. Let me know....
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Matt
Product Manager, RHX

<p>
Hi, Matt.  Thank you for your note.  
</p>

<p>
The main problem is actually the statements on the RHX main Web pages
that serve as entry points to RHX (and, in the recent past, by all RHX
press releases).  For example:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhx/">http://www.redhat.com/rhx/</a>
<pre>
  Starts out with "Trusted open source software" -- without saying that 
  some offerings are open source and some proprietary -- and goes on for
  the entire page talking how RHX has helped you select open source 
  applications, etc.
</pre>
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/support/article/DOC-1285</a> ("More about RHX" page)
<pre>
  Starts out with "Red Hat Exchange helps you compare, buy, and manage
  open source business applications. All in one place and backed by the
  open source leader. We've collaborated with our open source software
  partners to validate that RHX applications run on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux and are delivered through the Red Hat Network."
</pre>
Letting people _dig down_ to licensing specifics would be nice but
wouldn't fix the problem of false and misleading general statements 
everyone encounters on the way in.  The latter should be replaced
without delay.
</p>

<p>
And future RHX press releases should mention that it includes both
proprietary and open source applications.
</p>

<p>
The longer the delay in fixing this problem, the more Red Hat's
reputation for integrity is suffering.  Please make no mistake:  Your
firm is being damaged by this.

Dear Ashlee:
</p>

<p>
I note with interest your recent articles in ElReg: "Red Hat's Exchange
roars like a muted lamb" and "Red Hat RHXes out to open source
partners".  However, I'd like to point out one problem you haven't yet
covered: 
</p>

<p>
Many of Red Hat Exchange's offerings, although all are implied to be open
source, are in fact nothing of the kind.  For example, the offered
products from Zimbra, SugarCRM, Compiere, CentricCRM, and GroundWork are
very clearly under proprietary licences of various descriptions.
</p>

<p>
When I attended Red Hat's RHEL5 product launch in San Francisco on March
14, I heard RHX described for the first time, immediately noticed the
problem, and quietly called it to the attention of Red Hat CTO Brian
Stevens.  Stevens acknowledged the point, and said (loosely paraphrased)
that their Web pages should to be adjusted to make clear that not all
RTX offerings are open source -- which is indeed a sensible remedy, but
it hasn't yet happened.
</p>

<p>
I also attempted to call Red Hat's attention to the problem via the
designated RHX feedback forum, at
<a href="http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/feedback/feedback.jspa">http://rhx.redhat.com/rhx/feedback/feedback.jspa</a> .  (You'll note my
comment near the bottom.)
</p>

<p>
I'm sure it's an honest slip-up, but, accidentally or not, Red Hat has
mislead its customers for the past several months on this matter, and is
continuing to do so.
</p>

<p>
Best Regards,
Rick Moen

<pre>
&gt; Thanks so much for this, mate. Will investigate.
</pre>

<p>
Sure.  In case it will help:  
</p>

<p>
Most if not all of those codebases are ASP (Web app) code, which poses a
thorny problem:  Suppose you are, say, Google, and wish to behave
benignly towards open source with your Web apps.  You deploy a Web 2.0 
hosted application, and release its source code to the community under a
proper, forkable licence such as BSD / MIT X11 (simple permissive type)
or GPLv2 (copyleft), that fully satisfies the Open Source Definition.
For the sake of illustration, let's assume GPLv2.
</p>

<p>
Google's competitor EvilCo swoops by, grabs the source tarball, modifies
it extensively behind closed doors, and deploys it under a completely
different name as a hosted Web app (product/service) of its own, bearing
very little resemblance to Google's original application.  Let's say
that EvilCo nowhere mentions its borrowing from Google, and that EvilCo
doesn't provide anyone outside its employees access to the modified
source code.

<p>
Red Hat, Inc. seems to have taken quick and effective action to correct
some misleading statements about licensing that had previously been on 
the firm's Web pages for the "Red Hat Exchange" (RHX) partner-software
sales program:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/rhx/">http://www.redhat.com/rhx/</a>
https://rhx.redhat.com (and sub-pages)
</p>

<p>
Their corrections have been quite thorough and accurate!  The firm
should be commended for this very responsive action.  E.g., the main
description pages for RHX say things like:
<pre>
  RHX helps you compare, buy, and manage business applications -- all
  available from the open source leader. All in one place.
 
  We've done the work for you. You'll find profiles, ratings, priceseven
  free trials -- for every application. Working in collaboration with our
  partners, applications are validated to run on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
  delivered through Red Hat Network, and backed by Red Hat as the single
  point of contact for support.
</pre>
All of the former claims and implications of RHX's offerings being
uniformly open source have been corrected, top to bottom.  I've sent a
specific thanks to the manager in question.
