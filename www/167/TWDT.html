Hi all
</p>

<p>
Would like to introduce myself and this site, that I hope will become
popular place for Linux Gazette translations on Serbia language.
</p>

<p>
Most of my work evolves around Solaris Administration, but sometimes I
also need to do Linux work and Gazette is great source of helpful tips.
</p>

<p>
Despite my extremely busy professional (and personal) schedule, I'll try
to find time for translation, but I also encourage people from former
Yugoslavia to contact me and submit their translations. They all know that
there is no much difference between languages like Serbian, Croatian,
Bosnian, etc, so I am willing to publish all translation (both in Cyrillic
or Latin alphabet) .
</p>

<p>
Cheers

<p>
Hello list,
</p>

<p>
Hope you all are well. It is nearly 2 weeks I am working with iptables
configuration and stuck poorly at a very interesting point. Among
several others feature of my firewall, one I like to implement is
limit_total_connection_of_a_service. There is already rate-limiter like
a user can't get more than 2 ftp connection per min from the same source
IP. I have used hashlimit for this. It can also be extended to restrict
*all total*  2 connection per min . 
</p>

<p>
- But what to do to restrict all total 2 ftp connection from a particular source ?  
</p>

<p>
- And to restrict all together 5 ftp connection to the server ?
</p>

<p>
Could any one suggest a iptables configuration or iptables module to
achieve these two objectives ?  Thanks
</p>

<p>
PS: Please CC me.
</p>

<p>
Folks:
</p>

<p>
I would like to have some configuration advice from you guys for apache.
</p>

<p>
I have Apache 2.2.8 running in RHEL box.
</p>

<p>
I have multiple webapps running in tomcat and connected through apache
via ajp proxy.
</p>



<p>
Now we have the Rewrite rules..like
</p>

<pre>
RewriteRule ^/Context1$ /Context1/ [R]
RewriteRule ^/Context2$ /Context2/ [R]
RewriteRule ^/$ /DefaultContext/ [R]
</pre>


<p>
Here Context1,Context2, DefaultContext all are different webapps hosted
by tomcat.
</p>

<p>
When somebody calls for www.mysite.com it goes to
www.mysite.com/DefaultContext/ now.
</p>

<p>
How can I disable or hide the Defaultcontext being displayed in the URL.
</p>


<p>
So that if there is some hit at www.mysite.com/DefaultContext/DoAction
it should display the user www.mysite.com/DoAction
</p>

<p>
Any advice guys ..
</p>

<p>
Thanks &amp; regards,
Britto

<h3>failed to boot into RAID-5 root filesystem in Ubuntu 8.04</h3>

<p>
Hi Gang...
</p>

<p>
Today I try to setup a server using Ubuntu 8.04. This PC has 3 hard
disks and I plan to bond them as RAID 5 device.
</p>

<p>
To achieve that, during setup stage, I create 6 partitions. 3 of them
are clustered as RAID 5 and mounted as /, while the rest are also made
as RAID 5 device and formatted as swap.
</p>

<p>
There was a warning telling me that those new RAID devices won't be
recognized until I reboot the machine. I hit the Continue button and
proceed with package installation etc. Everything seems OK and finally
the installer ask me to remove the DVD and reboot.
</p>

<p>
Here comes the trouble, the freshly installed Ubuntu won't boot. My
partner told me that it could due to unfinished RAID synchronization.
So again I boot the Ubuntu DVD, this time I pick "rescue mode" and go
into shell (making /dev/md0 the root fs). In this shell, I did "cat
/proc/mdstat" and found out the sync is still on the way. So I wait
until it hit 100% and reboot the machine again. But still, no luck.
</p>

<p>
Thus, I wonder, is this because I pick RAID 5 device as root fs? Is
this a known bug (or limitation of GRUB)? I came to this conclusion
after reading <a href='http://advosys.ca/viewpoints/2007/04/setting-up-software-raid-in-ubuntu-server/'>http://advosys.ca/viewpoints/2007/04/setting-up-software-raid-in-ubuntu-server/</a>
(the 8th comment).
</p>

<p>
Advices are greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your attention .....

Googling here and there, I found very little web sites that talks
about recommended Linux-compatible DVD RW drive. So, I try my luck
here...perhaps you have  recommendation? Preferrably below US$ 100?

Hi Jimmy,
</p>


<pre>
&gt; One of our users is complaining that our transliterator doesn't work;
&gt; the few of us who have tested it all find that it works for us. Now,
&gt; he says it only works because our locales are wrong(?). I'm just
&gt; wondering if anyone other than him can get the incorrect result: i.e.,
&gt; that 'ा' fails to transliterate to 'ા' -- I reproduced the same test
&gt; using standard tools belo, because they do the same thing as our
&gt; transliterator.
</pre>

<p>
Just saw this email, so tried it out on my system. This is what I got:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
suramya@Wyrm:/usr/lib/locale$ echo $LANG
en_IE.UTF-8
suramya@Wyrm:/usr/lib/locale$ echo राम|tr 'राम' 'રામ'

રામ
suramya@Wyrm:/usr/lib/locale$ echo राम|perl /home/suramya/Temp/test.pl

<p>
It seems to be working fine for me... Hope this helps.

Hi Ben,

<p>
I'm glad to see the nitty-gritty of shells and terminals being dealt with in
Linux Gazette.  One thing that might have been unclear to the reader is that
the
</p>

<p>
LESS=FX less
</p>

<p>
syntax is (ba|z)sh code for "run less with the LESS variable set to FX for this
time only".  As you probably know, you could alternatively put
</p>

<p>
export LESS="-FRX"  # The R is for handling color.
</p>

<p>
in your ~/.profile to have less nicely customized everytime you run it, with
less typing.

<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
Thanks for a nice article explaining how to setup and use Scratchbox
for developing on the Nokia tablets.
</p>

<p>
Since the N900 has just be announced by Nokia you can expect a lot of
links to this issue of LG in a short while!
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

We got to the bottom of the transliteration problem: on Vineet's
system, there was a flaw in the locales -- matras were defined as
'punct' instead of 'alpha'.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; 2009/8/6 Vineet Chaitanya &lt;vc@iiit.ac.in&gt;:
&gt;&gt; All the three tests suggested by you passed successfully (using unmodified
&gt;&gt; en_IE.UTF-8 locale).
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     But if I modify "i18n" file so that "matraas" are declared as "alpha"
&gt;&gt; instead of "punct" then lt-proc -t also works correctly.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;     In any case I would like to have a look at your "i18n" file and would
&gt;&gt; like to know the reason why it differs from the usual one.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; in 'i18n', I guess this comment from 'LC_CTYPE' agrees with you:
&gt; ``
&gt; % - All Matras of Indic and Sinhala are moved from punct to alpha class/
&gt; % - Added Unicode 5.1 charctares of Indic scripts/
&gt; % DEVANAGARI/
&gt;   &lt;U0901&gt;..&lt;U0939&gt;;&lt;U093C&gt;..&lt;U094D&gt;;/
&gt;   &lt;U0950&gt;..&lt;U0954&gt;;&lt;U0958&gt;..&lt;U0961&gt;;/
&gt;   &lt;U0962&gt;;&lt;U0963&gt;;&lt;U0972&gt;;&lt;U097B&gt;..&lt;U097F&gt;;/
&gt; ''
&gt;
&gt; So yes, the matras are in the 'alpha' class on my system, not 'punct'.

Hi,

<p>
thank you for the article about GNOMEs history. Looking back made me
happy, nevertheless, I doubt that ... "GNOME development was announced
in August 1977" ;-)

Another option, though I'm not sure if it fits the OP's constraint of
"plain shell methods", is stat with a custom format:
</p>

<p>
prompt$ stat -c %y /tmp/teetime.log 
2009-08-31 09:30:11.000000000 -0400
</p>

<p>
I stumbled across this while looking for filesizes in scripts, seemed a
bit cleaner v. cut against ls output:
</p>

<p>
prompt$ stat -c %s /tmp/teetime.log 
7560497

This post reminded me that at(1) reads it's commands from stdin. Not that I 
had forgotten that fact, but that I usually avoid it. I rarely need to enter 
multi-line commands into at-scripts, and avoid having to cope with at's stdin 
by using the echo command.
</p>

<p>
For instance, I would have written the above at(1) invocation as
<pre>
  echo gnome-power-cmd.sh suspend | at now + 10 minutes
</pre>


<p>
Trivial, I know. That's why I called it a "1 cent tip" <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">

<p>
I recently came across some old notes listing the books I read when starting to use Linux.
</p>


<p>
At first, I wasn't sure what Free Software was, so I read the following:
</p>


<p>
- Free as in Freedom, Richard Stallman's Crusade for Free Software, 2002
<a href='http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/'>http://oreilly.com/openbook/freedom/</a>
</p>


<p>
- Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution, 1999
<a href='http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/toc.html'>http://oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/toc.html</a>
I especially liked the chapter 'Freeing the Source - The Story of Mozilla'
</p>


<p>
- The Cathedral and the Bazaar, Eric S. Raymond
<a href='http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/'>http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/</a>
I particularly enjoyed reading the section 'A Brief History of Hackerdom'
</p>


<p>
- <a href='http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/'>http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/</a>
This has various articles about free software 
</p>


<p>
I also read these Unix books and articles: 
</p>


<p>
- The Art of Unix Programming, Eric S. Raymond
<a href='http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/'>http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/</a>
</p>


<p>
- The UNIXHATERS Handbook
<a href='http://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf'>http://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf</a>
This reminded me that Unix is not the only way of doing things.
</p>


<p>
- Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language, Brian W. Kernighan, 1981
<a href='http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655-S00/readings/bwk-on-pascal.html'>http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655-S00/readings/bwk-on-pascal.html</a>
</p>


<p>
I must have read almost every entry in 'The Jargon File' at '<a href='http://www.catb.org/jargon/'>http://www.catb.org/jargon/</a>'.
</p>


<p>
I always wanted to know about networking, so I read 'The Linux Network
Administrator's Guide' on the Linux Documentation projects website,
'<a href='http://tldp.org/guides.html'>http://tldp.org/guides.html</a>'. On the same site I found two old books:
'The Linux Programmer's Guide' and 'The Linux Kernel' by David Rusling.
I know a bit of C which helped. I also went through most of the series
of 'Anatomy of...' articles at
'<a href='http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/'>http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/</a>'. I even browsed through the
'Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manuals' at
'<a href='http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/'>http://www.intel.com/products/processor/manuals/</a>'.
</p>


<p>
I enjoyed the 'The Bastard Operator From Hell' articles. You can google
for them. There are some at '<a href='http://members.iinet.net.au/~bofh/'>http://members.iinet.net.au/~bofh/</a>'. Also
try searching for lists of how 'You know you've been hacking too long
when...'. I also liked the 'Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal' and 'The
Story of Mel' posts. You can find discussions of them on wikipedia.
</p>


<p>
I learnt about Linux distro's from reading the Distrowatch Weekly at
'<a href='http://distrowatch.com/'>http://distrowatch.com/</a>'.

<p>
In some cases, you might want to hibernate or suspend your Linux
system solely from command line i.e because you want to schedule it
via "at".
</p>

<p>
Don't worry, you don't need to use GUI automation tool such as dogtail
for doing so. Simply use gnome-power-cmd.sh command to do that. Note:
make sure atd daemon is running first. Then do:
<pre class='code'>
$ at now + 10 minutes
at&gt; gnome-power-cmd.sh suspend
at&gt; (press Ctrl-D)
</pre>
will do suspend-to-RAM 10 minutes from now. Replace "suspend" with
"hibernate", "shutdown" or "reboot" to do the respective actions.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Introduces DeltaCloud Project </h3>

<p>Redhat engineers have initiated the DeltaCloud project "To enable an
ecosystem of developers, tools, and applications which can interoperate
across the public and private clouds".</p>

<p>Currently, each Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud has a unique 
API that developers and ISVs write to in order to consume the cloud 
service. The DeltaCloud effort hopes to create a common, REST-based 
API which developers can write to once and manage anywhere and 
everywhere. This requires a middleware layer with drivers that map APIs 
to all public clouds like EC2, and private virtualized clouds based on 
VMWare and Red Hat Enterprise Linux with integrated KVM.
The long term goal is for the middleware API to be test driven 
with a self-service web console, which will be another part of the 
DeltaCloud effort. </p>

<p>Among its goals, DeltaCloud aims to give developers:</p>
<ul>
<li> a REST API (with any-platform access);<br />
<li> Support for EC2, RHEV-M; VMWare ESX, RackSpace coming soon;<br />
<li> Backward compatibility across versions, for long-term use of 
scripts, tools and applications. </ul>

<p>One level up, DeltaCloud Portal will provide a web UI in front of the 
DeltaCloud API to: </p>
<ul>
<li> View image status and stats across clouds, all in one place;<br />
<li> Migrate instances from one cloud to another;<br />
<li> Manage images locally and provision them on any cloud.</ul>

<p>DeltaCloud API and Portal are free and open source (LGPL, GPL). For 
more info, see:<a href=" http://deltacloud.org"> http://deltacloud.org</a>. 

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat, JBoss Innovators of the Year Announced </h3>
<p>At the co-located Red Hat Summit and JBoss World in Chicago in 
September, Red Hat gave out their 2009 Innovator of the Year Awards 
which features major customers and how they put Red Hat and JBoss 
products and technologies to use. </p>

<p>In its third year, theInnovation Awards highlighted six category 
finalists for 2009: </p>
<ul><li> Management Excellence:<br />
<ul>Red Hat: Whole Foods Market<br />
JBoss: American Family Insurance </ul>
<li> Optimized Systems:<br />
<ul>Red Hat: Verizon Communications Inc.<br />
JBoss: Harvard Business Publishing + Rivet Logic </ul>
<li> Superior Alternatives:<br />
<ul>Red Hat: Union Bank, N.A.<br />
JBoss: GEICO</ul> 
<li> Carved Out Costs:<br />
<ul>Red Hat: Discount Tire Company<br />
JBoss: Allianz Australia Ltd </ul>
<li> Extensive Ecosystem:<br />
<ul>Red Hat: Hilti Corporation<br />
JBoss: Optaros + Massachusetts Convention Center Authority </ul>
<li> Outstanding Open Source Architecture:<br />
<ul>Ecommerce Inc. + Vizuri </ul>
</ul>

<p>Voting was open to the entire open source and Red Hat community to 
select the two overall Innovation Award winners - one Red Hat and one 
JBoss winner. This year, Red Hat Innovator of the Year Award went to 
Whole Foods Market. The company was selected for its use of Red Hat 
Satellite that resulted in reduced costs, reallocated resources and 
the ability of the Whole Foods IT department to focus on strategic 
business initiatives.</p>

<p>The JBoss Innovator of the Year went to Ecommerce + Vizuri for 
developing Imperia, a data center Web services hosting platform that 
can reduce operational costs and increase customer reliability using 
Red Hat, JBoss, Hyperic, and EnterpriseDB solutions.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Re-affirms Sun and Solaris Commitment </h3>
<p>Oracle tried to reassure its new-found Sun customers by taking out an 
ad on the front page of the Wall Street Journal in mid-September.</p>

<p>The ad had 4 simple bullet-points addressed to Sun Customers, many of 
whom are in the financial sector of the economy, and a short quote 
from Larry Ellison saying he looked forward to competing with IBM. The 
bullets said the Oracle intends to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spend more money developing SPARC than Sun does now;<br />
<li>Spend more money developing Solaris than Sun does now;<br />
<li>Save more than twice as many hardware specialists selling and 
servicing Sparc/Solaris systems than Sun does now;<br />
<li>Dramatically improve Sun's hardware performance by tightly 
integrating Oracle software with Sun hardware</ol>

<p>Oracle made good on the last point when it announced its improved 
Exadata V2 DB machine. (See article below.) The ad did not mention 
Java or the MySQL database, both of which Oracle now owns.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Unveils Hefty Exadata Version 2 - on Sun Hardware</h3>
<p>The OLTP Database Machine was unveiled in September by Oracle 
Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison and Sun Executive Vice 
President John Fowler. The Exadata Database Machine Version 2, made by 
Sun and Oracle, is said to be the world's fastest machine for both data 
warehousing and online transaction processing (OLTP).</p>

<p>Built using industry standard hardware components plus FlashFire 
technology from Sun, Oracle Database 11g Release 2 and Oracle Exadata 
Storage Server Software Release 11.2, the Sun Oracle Database Machine 
V2 is twice as fast as Version 1 for data warehousing. The Sun Oracle 
Database Machine goes beyond data warehousing applications with the 
addition of the huge Exadata Smart Flash Cache based on Sun FlashFire 
technology to deliver extreme performance and scalability for OLTP.</p>

<p>Bottom line: with the Sun Oracle Database Machine, customers can store 
more than 10x the amount of data and search data more than 10x faster 
without any changes to applications.</p>

<p>"Exadata Version 1 was the world's fastest machine for data warehousing
applications," said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, with characteristically
limited modesty. "Exadata Version 2 is twice as fast as Exadata V1 for data
warehousing, and it's the only database machine that runs OLTP
applications. Exadata V2 runs virtually all database applications much
faster and less expensively than any other computer in the world." Ellison
compared ExaData 2 to Teradata systems and high-end IBM 595 Power RISC
machines. "IBM has nothing like this," Ellison said after noting that only
IBM mirrors disks while Exadata 2 is fully fault tolerant with redundant
hardware.</p>

<p>Ellison also noted the modular ExaData 2 can be installed and 
ready in a single day. "It will be working by evening ... just load 
and run," Ellison said.</p>

<p>Better Hardware Specs from Sun: </p>
<ul>
<li> Sun' FlashFire memory cards enable high performance OLTP;<br />
<li> 80% Faster CPUs -Intel Xeon 5500 Nehalem processors;<br />
<li> 50% Faster Disks -600 GB SAS Disks at 6 Gigabits/second;<br />
<li> 200% Faster Memory -DDR3 memory;<br />
<li> 25% More Memory -72 Gigabytes per database server;<br />
<li> 100% Faster Networking -40 Gigabits/second on InfiniBand;<br />
<li> Raw disk capacity of 100 TB (SAS) or 336 TB (SATA) per rack;</ul>
<p>Software Optimization from Oracle:</p>
<ul>
<li> Hybrid columnar compression for 10-50 times data compression;<br />
<li> Scans on compressed data for even faster query execution;<br />
<li> Storage Indexes to further reduce disk I/Os;<br />
<li> Offloading of query processing to storage controllers using Smart 
Scans;<br />
<li> Applications running on the Sun Oracle Database Machine achieve up 
to 1 Million I/O operations per second with Flash Storage. </ul>

<p>Exadata Version 2 is available in four models: full rack (8 database 
servers and 14 storage servers), half-rack (4 database servers and 7 
storage servers), quarter-rack (2 database servers and 3 storage

All four Exadata configurations are available immediately.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">ARM Announces 2GHz Cortex-A9 Dual Core Processor Designs </h3>
<p>Gunning to displace Intel's netbook-dominant "Atom" processor, ARM 
announced development of dual Cortex-A9 MPCore hard macro 
implementations for the 40nm-G process developed with its partner, 
TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.). Silicon manufacturers 
now have a rapid route to silicon for high-performance, low-power 
Cortex-A9 processor-based devices. The speed-optimized hard macro 
implementation will enable devices to operate at frequencies greater 
than 2GHz with a power efficiency up to 8x greater than Intel's 
current Atom offerings. </p>

<p>The dual core hard macro implementations use advanced techniques to 
increase performance while lowering overall power consumption. Running 
at 2-GHz, the Cortex-A9 delivers about 10,000 MIPS with a power demand 
of about 2 watts. The low power design runs at 800 Mhz, consumes a 
half watt of power and delivers 4000 MIPS. 
In many thermally-constrained applications such as set-top boxes, 
DTVs, printers and netbooks, energy efficiency is of paramount 
importance. The Cortex-A9 can deliver a peak performance of 4000 DMIPS 
while consuming less than 250mW per CPU core.
ARM announced it was developing quad-core and eight-core Cortex-A9 
processor designs. In separate news, ARM also joined the Linux 
Foundation in September. 
The Cortex-A9 speed-optimized and power-optimized implementations are 
available for license now with delivery in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
ARM' 40G physical IP platform is also available at

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linpus' Launches Linpus Linux Lite 1.2 at OSIM World </h3>
<p>At OSIM World in mid-September, Linpus Technologies, Inc. released its 
new version of Linpus Linux Lite, its flagship netbook and nettop 
product aimed to improve a user' online experience.</p>
<p>This new version of Linpus Linux Lite, through its LiveDesktop 
application, improves the user experience by gathering important 
information in one place. LiveDesktop has six modules with thumbnail 
and text summaries, and an option for large previews. The social 
networking module allows access into Twitter, Flickr, Myspace and 
LastFM accounts. There are two modules for email - one for desktop 
mail and one that delivers mail from Web mail accounts. Additionally, 
there are modules for most recent websites and opened files -and a 
module for favorite programs or shortcuts.</p>
<p>LiveDesktop has also been designed so that each module has an extra 3 
or 4 objects, found by tapping the arrow at the side, meaning you can 
for example, actually quickly see six recent Web sites rather than just 
three.</p>
<p>Linpus Linux Lite also has a number of key improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li> Clutter graphic technology is used throughout to improve look and 
feel;<br />
<li> A network manager with support for 3G, WLAN, and LAN connectivity;<br />
<li> A power manager with auto-suspend support;<br />
<li> Dual booting enhancements and decreased boot-time to 3 seconds.</ul>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Enhances VM Template Builder, Oracle Enterprise Linux JeOS </h3>
<p>In August, Oracle announced Oracle VM Template Builder, an open 
source graphical utility that makes it easy to use Oracle Enterprise 
Linux "Just enough OS" (JeOS) and scripts for developing pre-packaged 
virtual machines for Oracle VM.</p>

<p>Oracle VM Template Builder uses "JeOS" to facilitate building an 
operating system instance with only the absolute minimum packages 
needed for an Oracle VM Template, helping to reduce the disk footprint 
by up to 2GB per guest virtual machine and to improve security and 
reliability. </p>

<p>Oracle Enterprise Linux JeOS is backed by 24x7, enterprise-class 
support and has been tailored specifically to facilitate the creation 
of Oracle VM Templates for production enterprise use.</p>

<p>Oracle VM Templates are virtual machines with pre-installed and 
pre-configured enterprise software that can be used by ISVs or 
end-users to package and distribute their applications. Oracle VM 
Templates simplify application deployments, reduce end-user costs and 
can make ISV software distribution more profitable.</p>

<p>This also allows end-users and ISVs the option to develop their Oracle 
VM Templates by using JeOS-based scripts directly or via the 
graphical Oracle VM Template Builder.</p>

<p>The graphical Oracle VM Template Builder utility is based on the core 
technology of Oracle's small footprint Oracle Enterprise Linux JeOS 
operating system image that is designed specifically for Oracle VM 
Template creation and build-process integration. Oracle offers this 
combination of enterprise class operating system and virtualization 
software for free download and free distribution. (O-VM is based on 
Xen virtualization technology.)</p>

<p>Oracle VM supports both Oracle and non-Oracle applications. Oracle 
VM Templates are available today for Oracle' Siebel CRM, Oracle 
Database, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Fusion Middleware, and 
more. See a complete list of templates at: 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/vm/templates/index.html"></a>. </p>
<p>Oracle VM Template Builder is distributed as software packages via the 
Oracle Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) and Oracle Technology Network. </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Toshiba Links vPRO Technology With TCG Self-Encrypting Drives </h3>

<p>Toshiba's Storage Device Division (SDD), a division of Toshiba America 
Information Systems, Inc., showcased its Trusted Computing Group 
(TCG) Opal-compliant Self Encrypting Drives (SEDs) in a demonstration 
of secure access using the Intel's vPro technology during the Intel 
Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco during September. 
As corporate governance requirements, government regulations and other 
industry mandates for stronger data protection increase, TCG 
Opal-compliant SEDs will become an increasingly important component in 
the data protection equation. Unlike earlier SED offerings, TCG 
Opal-compliant SEDs provide standards-based protocols to facilitate 
widespread adoption by disk drive vendors, security management 
software providers, system integrators and security-conscious end 
users.</p>

<p>The IDF demonstration was the first time SEDs were paired with Intel 
vPro technology to securely deliver down-the-wire access 
authentication. Management console applications can use Intel vPro 
technology to securely authenticate and access TCG Opal-compliant SEDs 
on remote PCs, even if the computer is powered off. This capability 
allows remote perform software updates, security audits and 
maintenance tasks in an enterprise domain.</p>

<p>SEDs greatly enhance the data security on any PC, especially laptops,
which are at greater risk of being lost or stolen. The TCG
Opal-specification provides a framework for delivering centrally managed
encryption solutions. TCG Opal-compliant SEDS offer the benefits of
stronger security through industry standardization of security protocols on
the hard drive, providing easier use and lower cost of ownership with
decreased management complexity.  Should a PC be lost or stolen, an IT
administrator can take action to remotely disable the PC and instantly
erase the encrypted data and applications on the SED, through Intel
Anti-Theft Technology, which is available on some Intel vPro
technology-enabled notebooks. Intel vPro technology enhances the
manageability of PCs equipped with Opal-compliant SEDs by providing the
mechanism through which IT administrators can authenticate and remotely
access the unattended PC.</p>

<p>Software updates and other administrative tasks can then be performed 
from virtually anywhere in the world, using a secure out-of-band 
communications channel to access and manage PCs that incorporate TCG 
Opal-compliant SEDs.</p>

<p>Toshiba plans to commercially introduce TCG Opal-compliant SEDs in 
2010. For more information on Toshiba' line of mobile HDDs, please

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Danube Releases ScrumWorks Pro 4, Enterprise-ready Scrum Tool </h3>
<p>Danube Technologies, a leader in project management tools and training 
for the Scrum methodology, announced in September that ScrumWorks Pro 
4, the latest release of the only enterprise-capable tool designed 
exclusively to reinforce the principles of the Scrum framework, was now 
available for purchase and upgrade. New features added to this release 
were driven by customer feedback and address the growing demands of 
enterprise customers. With release 4, large groups organized to meet 
complex development needs now have a flexible system to model features 
and milestones across multiple development groups.</p>

<p>"As the popularity of Scrum continues to grow, so has the demand for a 
project management tool that is sophisticated enough to scale for the 
largest, most complex Scrum development environments," said Victor 
Szalvay, Danube CTO and the Product Owner of ScrumWorks Pro. "This 
latest release gives users a powerful combination of functionality and 
flexibility to effectively model features and milestones across 
multiple related development groups."</p>

<p>New to ScrumWorks Pro 4:</p>

<ul><li> Program Management. Coordinate multiple related development groups 
with cross-cutting releases and feature goals. Track through to 
completion with high-level roll-ups of progress in a single cohesive 
interface.<br />

<li> High-level Feature Decomposition with Epics.<br />
 Epics are the stated 
high-level features or goals associated with any milestone. Define 
Epics and track progress at the project or program level.<br />

<li> Release Planning View.<br />
The release planner view provides a focused, 
high-level perspective of a release milestone. User stories are 
grouped by Epics and progress is front-and-center with embedded 
roll-up reports.<br />

<li> Flexible Modeling of Development Organizations.<br />
 New Program 
capabilities in release 4 are flexible enough to accommodate and model 
complex structures such as shared component projects, where a single 
project group supplies core components to multiple end-products.<br />

<li> Enterprise Reporting.<br />
 Track feature and release milestone progress 
across multiple products. Forecast completion and compare progress of 
contributing products in a Program release. Monitor the scope of 
features at the program level along with progress breakdown.</ul>

<p>"ScrumWorks Pro has always been driven by customer feedback," said 
Szalvay. "For large-scale Scrum deployments, release 4 will help 
coordinate multiple related product backlogs, all of which can work 
toward common release dates and feature goals."</p>

<p>ScrumWorks Pro 4 is currently available and can be purchased directly 
from Danube. Pricing is offered through an on-site, per-seat 
subscription license that starts at $289 per-user, per-year, or less 
than $25 per-user, per-month, as well as an on-site, per-seat fully

<h1>QQ on Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>Here are some pointers that might help learners of Chinese
to communicate with their Chinese friends using the QQ protocol
which is popular in China.</p>

<H2>Preliminary notes</H2>

<OL>

<LI><STRONG>If you <EM>can</EM> get your friends to use something other than
QQ, <EM>do</EM>.</STRONG> Dealing with QQ is messy, much more so than Skype,
MSN etc.</LI>

<LI>To <STRONG>sign up</STRONG> for a QQ account you <EM>will</EM> need assistance
from a Chinese person with good eyesight, as QQ's
<acronym title="Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart">CAPTCHA</acronym>
relies on human recognition of distorted Chinese
characters, and they're <EM>not</EM> beginners' characters.</LI>

<LI>libpurple (as used in Pidgin and Adium) has QQ protocol support; you
likely have to install the latest version (not the one in your package
manager), and in the account details select the Advanced tab and choose the
most recent version of the protocol (QQ's servers no longer allow the 2005
version, for example).  However libpurple is <EM>playing catchup</EM> with
QQ; every so often QQ does something that's not supported by libpurple, and
things can happen like all your incoming messages getting silently dropped, or
people trying to send you screen-shots and not realising you're not receiving
them.</LI>

</OL>

<H2>QQ for Linux</H2>

<OL>

<LI>Download from
<A rel="nofollow" href="http://im.qq.com/qq/linux">im.qq.com/qq/linux</A>
(1.0&nbsp;Beta&nbsp;1 has links to a <tt>.deb</tt> for Ubuntu 7.10+, a distribution-independent
<tt>.tgz</tt>, etc)</LI>

<LI>QQ 1.0 beta <STRONG>does not work well with GTK themes</STRONG>. Some
colours will be taken from the theme and others will not; the result is
usually unreadable. Additionally, you cannot simply change the <TT>HOME</TT>
environment variable to point to a directory that lacks <tt>.gtkrc</tt>; QQ
will find your real home directory anyway.
You have to do something like
<pre>
mv .gtkrc g0 ; (sleep 5;mv g0 .gtkrc) &amp; qq
</pre></li>

<li>The login window includes the expected fields for username and password,
a remember-password checkbox, and a sign-in button (the left-hand part of
which can be used to change status).</li>

<li>QQ bypasses the window manager a lot.
If clicking on a QQ window to raise it does not work,
try switching into it via Alt-Tab or equivalent.</li>

<li>The three tabs at the top of the main window are
"Friends", "Groups", and "Recently chatted with".
The colour button above that lets you choose a colour and picture for the QQ
windows' title bars, and above this is a status button and an area where you
can click to type a status message.
The round button at the bottom is a menu.
The spanner lets you change your account options
(friendly name, etc).
The other buttons are to view recently-downloaded files,
and to find/add more QQ contacts.
</li>

<li> Click to expand a list of contacts (friends, strangers, or other),
double-click to start a chat, right-click to bring up a context menu, the
items of which are Send Message, Send File, Delete Contact, View Profile,
Annotate Contact (i.e. set an alias), and whether or not to show these
aliases.</li>

<li>QQ 1.0 beta <STRONG>will crash</STRONG> if you try to type in an
annotation that is longer than 16 characters. (There is no bounds-checking on the
array until the C library sees corruption after <tt>free()</tt>.
It's reasonable to assume that Chinese-character aliases won't be longer than 16
characters, but Latin-character aliases might well be.)</li>

<li>QQ can also forget some of your annotations from time to time; I'm not sure
why.  You'd be advised to keep a separate copy.</li>

<li>In the chat window, press Control+Enter to send
(Enter just adds a new line).
The icons in the chat window are:
Emoticon,
History (toggles display of the most recent part of the conversation you
had before this one),
Send picture (lets you choose a picture file and pastes the picture directly
into the conversation),
Take screenshot (this button darkens the screen, and you then use the mouse to
drag out the rectangle that you want to send, and double-click on it; it
will then appear in the typing box and you can add words around it),
and Send file.</li>

<li>Voice and video chat are <strong>not</strong>
available in the 1.0&nbsp;beta Linux version.</li>

</OL>

<H2>QQ in WINE</H2>

<p>QQ 2008 (with voice chat) can be set up in WINE as
follows, but it is unstable.</p>

<pre>
mkdir qq &amp;&amp; cd qq &amp;&amp;
wget http://dl_dir.qq.com/qqfile/qq/QQ2008stablehij/QQ2008.exe &amp;&amp;
HOME="$(pwd)" LANG=zh_CN.gb18030 wine QQ2008.exe
</pre>

<p>then click the button marked with an (I), then click the first radio box,
then Next, then Next, then wait for installation, then Finish.  The "what's
new" file will appear in Notepad, and QQ will launch; you may now fill in
your number and password (and choose to remember
password).</p>

<p>You then need to close QQ and do this:</p>

<pre>
killall TXPlatform.exe QQ.exe explorer.exe winedevice.exe rundll32.exe services.exe
rm .wine/drive_c/Program\ Files/Tencent/QQ/TXPlatform.exe
</pre>

<p>Then run QQ with</p>

</pre>

<h2>Concluding Notes:</h2>
<p>(adapted from the Chinese-language thread at
<a href="http://www.linuxdiyf.com/bbs/thread-109610-1-1.html">http://www.linuxdiyf.com/bbs/thread-109610-1-1.html</a>,
with some experimentation to improve stability)</p>

<p>Most characters should be displayed if your system has the zh_CN.gb18030 locale and some Chinese TTF
fonts, although some menus may not display.</p>

<p>Voice chat works for me on Ubuntu Hardy's WINE package
(version 1.0.0-1ubuntu4~hardy1).
Newer WINE packages (1.1.0, 1.1.24)
get an assertion failure about
<TT>(elem)-&gt;type == SND_MIXER_ELEM_SIMPLE</TT>
in the ALSA code, or if you use <TT>winecfg</TT> to set
OSS audio then sound works only one way.</p>

<p> Some Chinese people will tell you that there exists an English
version of QQ.  However, that was released in 2005 and uses a version
of the protocol that QQ no longer supports.  There is a 2008 English
version of their simpler "Tencent Messenger" product, but I was not
able to get that to work with WINE.  </p>

<p>With thanks to Jessy Li for some translation help.</p>

<h1>Away Mission - SecureWorld Expos</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
The SecureWorld Expo series of regional conferences has become an
annual event in many parts of the US. SecureWorld aims to foster
communication between security professionals and technology leaders on
issues of best practices, and to encourage a public/private
partnership with government. These are vest-pocket security
conferences, with many local speakers and a small vendor expo.  They
are held in multiple regions, one or two a month, organized by
SecureWorldExpo.com in Portland, OR.
</p>

<p>
2009's Secure World was the fourth one held in the Bay Area.
The first SecureWorld Expo was held in Seattle in 2001.
</p>

<p>
Close to 50% of conference attendees, not the expo attendees, hold a
CISSP certification or a similar professional security credential.
</p>

<p>
The current list has 9 Expos in the spring and fall, and they will add
another region to their calendar later this year:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bay Area, September 16 - 17, 2009
<li>Detroit, September 29 - 30, 2009
<li>Seattle, October 28 - 29, 2009
<li>Dallas, November 4 - 5, 2009
<li>Houston, February 10 - 11, 2010
<li>Boston, March 23 - 24, 2010
<li>Atlanta, April 27 - 28, 2010
<li>Philadelphia, May 12 - 13, 2010
<li>Washington, D.C., April 13 - 14, 2010
</ul>

<p>
The event is structured into keynotes, presentation sessions and
panels, invitation-only sessions (see pricing section below), and Expo
breaks with the afternoon snacks.  Here are links to the agendas for
2008 and 2009:
</p>

<p>
2008: <a href="http://secureworldexpo.com/events/conference-agenda.php?id=255">http://secureworldexpo.com/events/conference-agenda.php?id=255</a><br>
2009: <a href="http://secureworldexpo.com/events/conference-agenda.php?id=269">http://secureworldexpo.com/events/conference-agenda.php?id=269</a>
</p>

<p>
These agendas have a good mix of topics, and some very qualified
speakers. Unfortunately, presentation materials are hard to come by.
The organizers at the conference say that presenters are not required
to post their slides. They also do not commit to a schedule of
posting materials, but say that attendees will eventually get an
e-mail with the location of those materials they have.  Although I
could find several conference e-mail reminders from 2008, I did not
find an e-mail with info on the 2008 conference slides.  That was
disappointing.
</p>

<p>
I actually wrote to JoAnna Cheshire, the Director of Content at Secure
World Expos to get the scoop on this. She explained: "Due to our
privacy policy with our speakers, we do not post any of the archived
slides. If an attendee is interested in a slide presentation, we
encourage them to e-mail us, and we will contact the presenter directly
to obtain the slides for them. It is up to each individual presenter
whether or not to provide the requested slides."
</p>

<p>
I did like the presentation this year on WiFi vulnerabilities and
hacker/cracker attacks.  It was actually titled "What hackers know
that you don't" and presented by Matt Siddhu of Motorola's AirDefense
group (purchased by Motorola in the past year), and I suspect you
could e-mail him for a copy or search the AirDefense web site.
</p>

<p>
Siddhu gave a good summary of the problems with wireless access
points, especially rogue APs with makeshift directional antennas
having ranges of 100s to 1000s of feet. He also included a good
summary of rogue AP detection. This includes traffic injection, SNMP
look-up, and RF fingerprinting. A security professional may need to
use a combination of wired, wireless, and forensic analysis plus the
historical record of traffic when detecting rogue traffic. He
recommended the use of wireless ACLs for both inside and outside
access, including the possibility of jamming specific rogue APs with
TCP resets and also jamming clients who use outside APs.
</p>

<p>
The closing session was a presentation by FBI Cyber Division
Special Agent John Bennett on the work of Federal agencies in
opposing cyber-crime.  Federal agencies opposing cyber-crime and
terrorism include the FBI, the Secret Service, ICE, and Inspectors
General at varied agencies like NASA.
</p>

<p>
Bennett discussed botnets and national security attacks by state actors.
(He was sorry that his slides could not be released without filling out
dozens of forms.) He said that new targets now include smaller financial
institutions and law firms that generally hold large amounts of
confidential information in unsecured and unencrypted states.
</p>

<p>
Beside the normal attack vector list that includes cross-site
scripting (XSS) and SQL injection, Bennett noted an increased use of
steganography (hiding data in data), which is being seen more on VOIP
streams as a means of leaking data invisibly.
</p>

<p>
2009's Bay Area event was significantly smaller than 2008's, both in
attendance and in vendor participation.  There also were fewer
folks at the end of expo prize drawings - the so-called "Dash for
Prizes" - during the afternoon break.
</p>

<p>
I saw fewer than 200 people at the lunch and AM keynotes. I think
there were closer to 300 at the 2008 event.  With 8 vendors and 10
prize items, chances seemed fairly good. So why didn't I win
something?
</p>

<p>
As in 2008, there were several invitation-only sessions, some by
professional associations or for industry verticals. In fact, local
ISSA and Infragard chapters were local partners and held meetings.
The sessions for "standard" attendees were fewer this year, and didn't
run as late in the day.
</p>

<p>
The conference was still priced below $300 - in fact, $245 this year and
$195 last year - except for "SecureWorld +" attendees, who had more
in-depth sessions during both days' mornings. "SecureWorld +" attendees
could go to the professional group events, and were charged $695 both
this year and last year.  They also could also receive 16 CPE credits.
</p>

<p>
There was a discount code sent by e-mail for $200 off the "plus" rate,
making it $495.  In any case, these are bargain conferences,
especially considering the hot lunch buffets included.
</p>

<p>
As I've said, this is a small conference at a small price, so you have
to accept the lack of certain amenities. To hold down costs, there are
no conference bags, no CDs of presentation slides,  and... no
conference WiFi.
</p>

<p>
I think every other conference I've attended at the Santa Clara
Convention Center has had free WiFi, and that goes back over a decade.
Instead, there was a stack of 2"x4" papers explaining how to
sign-up for a day pass on the paid network. That was $13.95 this year.
</p>

<p>
I also asked JoAnna Cheshire about the WiFi issue and got the
following reply: "We find that the number of attendees who ask for
wi-fi at our conference are a very small percentage, and for us to pay
for WiFi to cover the entire conference would impose a significant
cost on us."
</p>

<p>
I think it would have been better if the daily conference e-mail,
preceding each of the two days of SecureWorld, had mentioned this fact.
I could have printed out a list of nearby WiFi cafes and libraries. So
I had to be resigned to not having an e-mail tether, which isn't all
that bad.  Of course, your situation may differ.
</p>

<p>
In summary, the conference is useful for security professionals, and
should grow again after the economic downturn. I was a bit
disappointed that there was little conference material on
virtualization security, something I expect to change in the future.
Cloud computing security was discussed in a keynote and a panel.
However, if you attend an upcoming Secure World, be prepared to pay for
WiFi or get a cellular card from your cellphone provider.  I'd also
recommend carrying business cards to request copies of any presentations
you may want: They won't be archived after the conferences.

<h3>Silicon Valley CodeCamp 09 -- Free</h3>

<p>
Oct 3-5, Foothill College, Los Altos, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.SiliconValley-CodeCamp.com/Register.aspx">http://www.SiliconValley-CodeCamp.com/Register.aspx</a>
</p> 

<p>
It's been running for several years and it's always been <em>free</em>.
Lunch is provided by the sponsors, as well.
</p> 
 
<p>
I confess that I haven't gone to the CodeCamp before (time conflicts),
but have been to the related Product Manager's Camp, and it was worth
the price of admission. I do know people who have gone before, and all
report a positive experience.   
</p> 

<p>
Using the now-familiar unconference format, volunteer speakers sign
themselves up for sessions and some slots are open for spontaneous
topics.   That makes the agenda a little fluid but you'd only be risking
some weekend time.
</p> 



<h3>Oracle OpenWorld 2009</h3> 

<p>
Oct 11-15, San Francisco, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/openworld/">http://www.oracle.com/us/openworld/</a>
</p> 

<p>
The Oracle behemoth keeps acquiring both major application brands, as
well as open source companies. Previously, it released an
Oracle-supported version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This year, it
swooped up all of Sun Microsystems with its many open source gems,
including Java, Solaris, and MySQL. What will be Oracle's next foray
into the open source universe?
</p> 

<p>
In September, ahead of Oracle OpenWorld, it announced the world's
fastest database machine based on high-end Sun Microsystems X86
hardware. See a summary of its impressive performance in the News
Bytes column, this month.  
</p> 

<p>
So far, Oracle has promised to keep Java free and open, and to also
support MySQL. It now distributes both a Linux distribution and a version
of Unix. It's been a major contributor to the btrfs file system, and
now owns ZFS. What will Oracle do next??
</p> 

<p>
The last Oracle OpenWorld handled logistics well, for an event with over
40K attendees, and offered a lot of content. It also offers a lot of
value, with its Expo pass that includes keynotes, the expo, and the
end-of-conference reception. The main conference is expensive, unless
you can get a customer or partner discount.
</p>

<h3>Agile Open Northern California</h3>

<p>
Oct 15-16, Fort Mason, San Francisco, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.agileopencalifornia.com/registrationcampaign/promo001/">http://www.agileopencalifornia.com/registrationcampaign/promo001/</a>
</p> 

 
<p>
This event is organized by Dayspring, Inc., and is a very low-cost
event at $250: two days of Agile theory and practice with 32 sessions,
lunch, and a networking reception. Also organized like an unconference,
this event uses the Open Space Technology framework to organize
sessions.
</p> 

<p> Here's a link to the wiki for the 2008 proceedings:

<h3>eComm Fall 2009 Europe</h3>

<p>
Oct. 28-30, Westergasfabriek, Amsterdam, NL<br>
<a href="http://www.amiando.com/ecomm2009-europe.html">http://www.amiando.com/ecomm2009-europe.html</a>
</p> 

<p>
This is the first eComm conference in Europe, but the two preceding
eComm events in the US have been stellar.
</p> 

<p>
The mix of speakers goes from major telecoms to the very open, very
alternative developers on the fringe.  It's a challenging environment for
both speakers and audience, with short 15 min. sessions and even
shorter 5 min. bullet sessions. There is hardly a dull moment at eComm,
and some conversations are just short of amazing. If you are anywhere
near Amsterdam, consider checking this one out.
</p> 

<p>

<h1>A Quick-Fire chroot Environment</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
As a teacher in the computer field, I often get invited to teach at various
companies which are not necessarily prepared for the requirements of a
computer class - at least not in the finer details. In this article, I'd like
to share one of the software tools I use to handle some of the unexpected (or
should I say, the "expected unexpected"?) situations.
</p>

<p>
I recall visiting a well-known company, several years ago, that lost track
of the time the class was supposed to start... as well as the fact that I
would need to get through their security. And that the students needed the
books that had been ordered for them (these books were actually in the very
next room, but the people who delivered them didn't manage to route the
information to the people responsible for the class.) And their computers
were set up with Windows - despite the fact that the class was called
"Introduction to Unix" - and the Unix servers they were supposed to connect
to were not available (something about firewalls, and the only sysadmin who
could configure them being out that day.) Oh, and there was no Internet
access from there, either.
</p>

<p>
That, my friends, is what you might call a scorched-earth disaster area. At
the very least, that's a bad, bad situation to walk into on a fine Monday
morning, with a long week of teaching stretching out into forever ahead of
you.
</p>

<p>
So, what happened? Well, I not only survived that one, I got excellent
reviews from all the participants. Yes, I'm fast on my feet. Yes, I carry a
lot of what I know in my head instead of being completely dependent on a
book. Yes, I can take charge and <strong>handle</strong> crazy situations
while other people are reeling and writhing and fainting in coils <a
id="okopnik.html_1_back"></a><a href="#okopnik.html_1">[1]</a>. But one of
the major factors that saved my bacon that day was that I could quickly and
<em>safely</em> set up a bunch of login accounts - i.e., give each of my
students an individual "sandbox" to play in, loaded with a bunch of basic
Unix/Linux tools - without compromising my system, or letting them damage
or destroy it by accident while mangling everything they could lay their
hands on (as new students, or anyone experimenting without restraint,
will.)
</p>

<p>
I did all that by configuring a <em>chroot</em> environment: i.e., one
where the root ('/') of the login system resides somewhere other than my
own system's root does (e.g., '/var/chroot'). Since, as you're probably
aware, there's no way <a id="okopnik.html_2_back"></a><a
href="#okopnik.html_2">[2]</a> to go above the root directory, the users
are effectively "trapped" inside the created environment - and you have a
safe "sandbox" that only contains the tools that you put in there. It's a
very handy tool - actually, a set of tools - if you suddenly need to do
this kind of thing.
</p>

<h3>Thinking about the process</h3>

<p>
In order to have a usable Linux environment, there are several basic items
that are necessary. For one, you need a minimal directory structure
(<code>/etc</code> for the required configuration files; <code>/dev</code>
for the devices; <code>/lib</code> and <code>/usr/lib</code> for all the
required libraries for the programs that expect to find them there;
<code>/bin</code>, <code>/usr/bin</code>, and <code>/usr/sbin</code> for
all the required programs, and so on.) For another, you need the
configuration files, the libraries, and all the external files used by all
the programs you want to run - this actually becomes quite involved,
especially if you want the man pages that go along with these programs!
Then, of course, you also need the devices, the log files, the actual
config files (<code>/etc/passwd</code>, <code>/etc/shadow</code>, and so
on)... and then you need the user accounts and any files you want to
provide for those users.
</p>

<p>
Whew. This is beginning to sound complicated. Is there an end to this, or
does it just keep getting bigger and bigger?
</p>

<h3>Rejoice! Linux is at hand!</h3>

<p>
Fortunately, there is indeed an end to it - and it's not that far off. Not
much more than I described above, in fact. Also, with a bit of thought (and
the amazing tools provided with Linux), much of this can be automated.
</p>

<p>
Here's the script that I use to build the whole thing. It takes an optional
argument specifying how many login accounts to create (it defaults to 20 if
no argument is given.) I'll intersperse my comments throughout; the running
version, along with the other tools that I'll describe below, is available
<a href="misc/okopnik/chroot.tgz">here</a>.
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
# Created by Ben Okopnik on Thu Mar 22 22:50:21 CDT 2007

[ "$UID" -eq 0 ] || { echo "You need to run this as root."; exit 1; }
</pre>

<p>
You have to be root to do this stuff, of course; many of the files and
directories you need to copy are only readable by the root user.
</p>

<pre class="code">
# If a number has been specified as a command-line arg, use it; otherwise,
# create 20 accounts.
if [ -n "$1" ]
then
    if ! [[ "$1" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || [ "$1" -le 0 -o "$1" -gt 100 ]
    then
        echo "If used, the # of accounts to create must be 1-100. Exiting..."
        exit 1
    fi
fi

# Default to 20 accounts unless some other number has been specified
number=${1:-20}
</pre>

<p>
I limited it to a max of 100 users because that's way, way more people than
I'd ever teach in one class - plenty of safety margin. You're welcome to
modify that number, but you should consider carefully if there will be any
adverse unintended consequences from doing so.
</p>

<pre class="code">
source .chrootrc
</pre>

<p>
This is where I get the variables that tell me where to set up the
environment, what IP to use for accessing it, and what netmask to use with
that IP. (See the "chrootrc" file in the tarball if the method is less than
obvious.)
</p>

<pre class="code">
echo "Creating the basic dir structure"
mkdir -p $dir/{bin,dev,etc,lib,proc,tmp,var}
mkdir -p $dir/usr/{bin,lib,local,sbin,share}
mkdir -p $dir/usr/local/share
mkdir -p $dir/var/log
</pre>

<p>
That's all the directory structure that's necessary for now. Later, we'll
add more stuff as needed - see the section on program installation.
</p>

<pre class="code">
echo "Creating devices in $dir/dev"
mkdir $dir/dev/pts

<p>
Here, I manually copy in both the required files and the ones that I use in
my Linux intro, shell scripting, and Perl classes. This is a little crude,
at least now that I have an automated procedure for copying not only the
programs but all their required libs, ini files, man pages, and so on (see
the discussion of this below) - but that's no big deal, since I designed
this whole thing to be highly redundancy-tolerant. This section is actually
a hold-over from the first few versions of the script, but it definitely
does no harm, and is possibly (I haven't tested for this) a requirement for
keeping the entire process going. Anyone who wants to experiment, feel free
to rip out this section and give it a shot.
</p>

<pre class="code">
echo "Installing the required libs for the toolkit progs"
# Different versions of 'ldd' produce several variations in output.
# Debian's includes the paths to the libraries, so deciding what to copy
# where is easy; if yours does not, you'll have to check if it exists in
# the standard paths and copy it to the appropriate place in the chroot
# tree.
for lib in `ldd $dir/bin/* $dir/usr/bin/* $dir/usr/sbin/*|\
	perl -walne'print $1 if m#(\S*/lib\S+)#'|sort -u`
do
	# Extract the original lib directory
	d=${lib%/*}
	# Cut the leading / from the above
	ld=${d#/}
	# Check if the dir exists in the chroot and create one if not
	[ -d "$ld" ] || mkdir -p $dir/$ld
	[ -e ${lib#/} ] || cp $lib $dir/$ld
done
</pre>

<p>
This was my original method for figuring out the libraries required by the
copied programs: I ran "ldd" on the whole kit of them, sorted the list of
libs reported, made the list unique, and copied those libs into the
environment. It works well - but does not take care of the required
files, external programs, and so on. Again, I've greatly improved on this
process (see the program installation section, below) - but this does no
harm, and, again, may be essential.
</p>

<p>
One of the required config files that's referenced by much of the
networking stuff - SSH, etc. - is the Name Service Switch configuration
file, a.k.a. /etc/nsswitch.conf. We need it really early on - so we just
copy it in right here. Ditto the libs that are required for accessing it.

<p>
Hopefully, all of the above are really obvious: these are the files in /etc
that are required for user validation/authentication and so on.  Actually,
these are just the skeletons comprised of non-user account info; the users
will get added in just a moment. Note that the root account (along with the
other non-user accounts) is configured so that you can't log in: the slot
for the password hash contains a '!', meaning it's not a valid login
account. I don't recall the exact reason that I have it there in the first
place - but I do seem to recall that it was useful for something. No harm
in leaving it there.
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Note: users' UIDs will start at 1001; the first account manually added

done

chmod 600 $dir/etc/shadow
</pre>

<p>
This is the fun part: we're actually pretty much done with setting up the
chroot stuff, all except for the SSH server - so it's time to create the
user accounts. For each of them, we'll create the home directory (named
'student$n', where $n is an incrementing number), set the ownership/group
of that directory to that user, create a minimal .bash_profile for that
user (note that the LC_ALL setting is required to prevent Perl from
throwing errors telling you that your system's language needs to be
configured), and create the required entries in /etc/passwd and
/etc/shadow.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Crude Hack of The Day:</strong> I created a 'student' account on my
system, used 'student' as a password, and copied the resulting hash from
/etc/shadow into this script. It works fine, of course, but that's like
using an elephant gun to kill a fly... (I removed the account immediately
afterwards, so if you're a future student of mine, don't even bother
trying. :)
</p>

<p>
Later, of course, I used Perl's "crypt" function to generate the salts and
the password hashes for additional users (see the "chroot-add-user" script
in the kit for the exact technique); this works fine if you want to add
more users after you create this whole thing.
</p>

<pre class="code">
echo "Configuring the SSH environment"
# Change the IP, the PAM, and the PrivSep notes in etc/ssh/sshd_config
sed -i -e "s/#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0/ListenAddress $ip/" -e "s/UsePAM yes/UsePAM no/" \
	-e "s/UsePrivilegeSeparation yes/UsePrivilegeSeparation no/" $dir/etc/ssh/sshd_config
</pre>

<p>
SSH configuration: pretty simple, once you've figured it out. All the
/etc/ssh stuff has already been copied over; now we'll just modify the
relevant bits so that we can log into the chroot instead of the "parent"
system.
</p>

<pre class="code">
ifconfig eth0:chroot $ip down
ifconfig eth0:chroot $ip netmask $netmask
[ -z "`mount | grep $dir`" ] &amp;&amp; {
	mount -tproc proc $dir/proc
	mount -tdevpts devpts $dir/dev/pts 
}
</pre>

<p>
Last of all, we mount the "/proc" file system in the chroot - a necessary
bit of magic, and one you must remember to undo (via "chroot-stop") if you
decide to delete the environment - you won't be able to delete it
otherwise, even as root! We also set up the networking interface - really,
an alias to one. One of the nifty things that Linux allows you to do is to
use a single piece of hardware several times... or at least to make it look
like that. In this case, I use my Ethernet interface, <code>eth0</code>, to
connect to the LAN - but I also use an alias, <code>eth0:chroot</code>, to
provide an "attachment point" for another IP address, that of the chroot.
Am I making myself clear? No? Then read your "man ifconfig" - the part
about aliases. It only mentions numerical aliases, e.g. eth0:0, but
"ifconfig" takes named aliases as well. Quite the cool feature.
</p>

<h3>Now what?</h3>

<p>
Ummm... you know how I said we were done? Well, I lied. I mean, we are
kinda done - that is, you can actually log in as "student1@your_chosen_ip"
- but what do you do then?
</p>

<p>
So, we need to copy in some programs. And some man pages. And their
supporting files. (If you ever want to be driven out of your mind very
rapidly, try tracing down everything required by "man". I'll visit you at
the asylum if you send me an email.) After I struggled with this for a
while - a dozen times over several years, whenever I thought of it - I
finally hit upon an idea that impressed even a cynic like me: run the
program, use "strace" to list all the files it opens in the process, and
copy all those files! Implementing this took a bit of script hackery and
juggling of "strace" options, but the end result is just fantastic: I've
never had to trace down a single missing file since. All that's required
after that is copying the man pages - and that's a breeze by comparison.
Oh, yes: the one requirement for the above is running the program to be
installed in such a way that it will exit (for example, you can't just
install "vim"; you have to use "vim -h", or "vim --version".) As you can
see, this is not much of a hardship.
</p>

<p>
The technique goes like this (this section is from the "chroot-instprog"
script):
</p>

<pre class="code">
for file in $(strace -s 1024 -eopen $full $args 2&gt;&amp;1|awk -F'"' '/[0-9]$/{print $2}')
do
	# Skip device files, security-sensitive system files, and users' private files
	if [ -n "`echo $file|egrep '/proc/|/dev/|/etc/passwd|/etc/shadow|/etc/group|~/home'`" ]
	then
		echo "Skipping $file"
		continue
	fi
	echo "Copying $file to $dir$file"

	# Create the target dir if it doesn't exist
	targetdir=${file%/*}
	[ -d "$dir$targetdir" ] || mkdir -p "$dir$targetdir"

	if [ -f "$dir$file" ]
	then
		echo "$file already present; skipping..."
		continue
	else
		# Copy, and: preserve links/mode/ownership/timestamps; update only;
		# force if necessary; follow symlinks in source.
		cp -aufL "$file" "$dir$file"
		echo $file
	fi
done
</pre>

<p>
I look for <em>successful</em> file "open"s, then copy those files -
assuming they don't already exist - creating any containing directories as
necessary. 
</p>

<p>
Last, we'll install the man pages. A little tricky stuff there due to the
variety of ways in which they're named (and linked), but nothing a little
scripting can't solve. From the same file as above:
</p>

<pre class="code">
# Find man pages, install them if they exist
# Strip out any extensions
b=${prog%%.*}
# Strip all the path info
bare=${b##*/}
m=`man -w $bare`
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
	# Look for a manpage for the progname without any extensions
	mb=${m%%.*}
	# Strip off the path info
	mbare=${mb##*/}
	# Get the path for the manpage installation
	mpath=${m%/*}
	# ...and get the extension as well, since we'll need to add it back on
	mext=${m#*.}

	# If the manpage filename doesn't equal the progname (e.g. 'awk' and
	# 'gawk'), then install the 'linked' manpage by following the link and
	# saving the endpoint under the original name. Weird solution - but it
	# works well as long as we don't need to update or relink the manpages
	# (as we would in a real distro.)
	if [ "$bare" != "$mbare" ]
	then
		[ -d "$dir/$mpath" ] || mkdir -p "$dir/$mpath"
		echo "Copying $mpath/$bare.$mext to $dir/$mpath/$bare.$mext"
		cp -fL "$mpath/$bare.$mext" "$dir/$mpath/$bare.$mext"
	else
		tdir=${m%/*}
		[ -d "$dir$tdir" ] || mkdir -p "$dir$tdir"
		echo "Copying $m to $dir/$m"
		cp -fL "$m" "$dir/$m"
	fi
fi

echo "Copying $full to $dir$full"
cp -fL $full $dir$full
</pre>

<h3>So, how do I use this thing already?</h3>

<p>
Simple: first, reconfigure the "chrootrc" file for the location, IP, and
netmask you want to use. Next, run the "chroot-create" program as root,
optionally supplying an argument if you want something other than 20
accounts. If you're done at that point, or if you just want to check to see
if it all worked, run "chroot-start" as root, and log into one of the
created accounts (e.g., "student1" with a password of "student"). That's
it. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to do more than that, though, just run "list-install"; it
installs a whole raft of programs, via "chroot-instprog", that I like to
use in my classes (or set up your own list; the syntax of "list-install" is
an obvious one.) If you want to add another user - e.g., I like to add one
named "ben" so I don't have to think about which student account I should
use - there's "chroot-add-user". If you need to shut down the chroot -
e.g., you're tired of serving the world, and just want to run SSH so you
can log into your own system - then there's "chroot-stop". That's it - and
that's all I've found necessary for managing this system in practical use.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
This system seems to hang together, work well, and has served me on many
occasions when nothing else would do. If you find yourself in similar need,
or can envision a situation in which you would, I suggest giving this kit
of programs a try - perhaps getting a little practice with it. Then, when
you need it, it'll go smoothly.

</p>

<p>
<a id="okopnik.html_2"></a><a href="#okopnik.html_2_back">[2]</a> That's
not precisely true; there are indeed ways to break out of a chroot
environment. However, as far as I'm aware, those methods require a)
root-level access within that environment, b) the awareness that it can be
done, and c) a bit of savvy about such things. The first is something that
I definitely do not make available (no root login, no 'sudo', 'super', or
anything else of the sort); the second and the third are not something that
I'd expect of brand-new students in a high-pressure learning environment.
And I have a few traps set all over the place just in case, anyway. :)

has proven to be very popular, and a number of people have sent me reports
about domains that weren't being registered by it (since fixed, or listed
as non-reporting.) One of the reporters, however, has been tireless and
amazing: a fellow named Sukbum Hong has been responsible for a good dozen
changes in the script, particularly for domains in East Asia. He's got lots
of credit in the script comments, and I wish there were a lot more people
like him around!

<h1>Two is better than one!</h1>

<p>
<H3>Summary</H3>

<P>This article introduces the concept of twin-boot (as opposed to
dual boot). Twin-boot involves two (or more) Linux distros on the
same machine, and two hard disk drives (optional but highly
recommended). The distros are cleverly installed, so as to make
the best use of the available hardware redundancy. You can do
more, and do it faster, with this kind of an arrangement.</P>

<H3>The twin-boot experiment</H3>

<P>It all started when I was decommissioning my old, self-assembled
PC. I was building another Linux box with bigger/better hardware.
I got a 80 GB disk, to replace my old 40 GB disk, and a brand new
motherboard with built-in sound interface, and a bigger RAM, and
a brand new flat-panel LCD monitor. My <em>God</em>, I was rich! Those
were good old days when a little was enough to make one feel at
the top of the world.  Instead of trading in the old (smaller)
drive for a new drive, I decided to keep it with me. Moreover,
Linux distros were getting easier and more accessible, courtesy of
magazines like <em>Linux for You</em>. So, instead of installing just one
distro, I chose to install two distros and learn how to handle
both. These choices led me to the big question: What would be
the best way to get the most out of the hardware and the software
I now had with me? The rest of this article will explain what I
did. It may give you some ideas and make you extract more out of
your Linux boxes. The twin boot experiment itself is fun to
go through, and will help you experience several finer points of
how Linux works. </P>

<P>The term dual boot has traditionally been used to denote a system
where we have Linux and the other black-box OS together. The term
"twin boot" is introduced in this article, to denote an
"unpolluted Linux box" (ULB), which has two Linux
distributions (and no black-box OS). The twin boot concept helps
us to effectively get rid of the cancer that has infected all of
us. Additionally, twin boot systems have two separate hard disks,
although it is possible to build twin boot systems on a single
hard disk. Having two disks gives us some advantages, as we will
see later. There could be several ways to install two Linux
distros on a system with two drives. This article shows one way
in which this can be done, and discusses the various issues
involved. Of course, you can extend the idea to more than two
distros, and maybe more than two disks, on the same machine.</P>

<P>A word of caution, before you start making your twin-boot system:
Do <em>not</em> attempt this if you are a novice and not fully aware of
how Linux works. Setting up partitions, setting up the boot
loader, and fine tuning the installation etc., require some
prior knowledge and experience in Linux troubleshooting and
administration. All this is not rocket science, but you can still
make serious blunders. So, be careful. Keep a Linux guru close
by, as your helpline, if you are still learning the ropes. Since
you will be working as root, most of the time, you have to be
extra careful.</P>

<H3>How to do this</H3>

<P>The principle involved in this approach is to install the two
distros on the same disk (in two different partitions, of course).
We set up swap spaces for the two distros, on the other disk. We
also make a partition whose mountpoint will be /home. This single
/home will be shared by both the distros. For convenience, let us
call the two distros distro A and distro B, and call the two
drives drive P and drive Q. The architecture we choose would
look like Figure 1. The dotted arrow-lines show that the same
/home is shared by both distros. There are two swaps, one for each
distro. (There is a reason for this.) Both distros sit on the
drive Q (the bigger one), whereas the /home and swap partitions are on
drive P (the smaller one). In fact, this arrangement is a
modified form of the arrangement explained in an article which
appeared in <em>Linux for You</em> (February 2009). A similar effort is
also explained in the article located at 
<a href="http://www.go2linux.org/dual-boot-two-linux-distros-debian-and-mandriva">http://www.go2linux.org/dual-boot-two-linux-distros-debian-and-mandriva</a>.
This article has a large number of screenshots, to make things
easier for you.</P>

<P>In my case, distro A was OpenSUSE 11, and distro B was Ubuntu
9.04. The drive P was a 40 GB IDE drive, and drive Q was a 80 GB
SATA drive.</P>

<LI>Tweak GRUB's menu.lst file on the first OS, so
that it can launch either OS interactively at boot time.
<LI>Boot OS A, and verify that the intended partitions have been
mounted as planned. 
</OL>

<P>
Use command "mount", or run "cat /etc/fstab". Reboot, and repeat with
distro B.</P> 

<P>Create partitions on P and Q :  Use a live CD (e.g. Knoppix),
since you do not have any OS installed on the system just now.
The command  fdisk -l  will give a clear picture of all the
disks and their available partitions. Here is what we would see,
if we did a fdisk -l on our system:</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="misc/parthasarathy/figure2.png" ALT="figure-2"><BR>
Figure 2: Layout of the partitions</CENTER> 

<P>Notice that we made just one partition for /home, but two
partitions for swap.  The recommended size of swap is still a
matter of debate and confusion. I chose 2 GB for each swap (on
/dev/sda), just to be safe.  Each swap partition is reserved for
a specific OS. It is not a good idea to make two OSes write on the
same swap partition, because that can cause serious
inconsistencies and problems. For instance, every time you shut
down Linux properly and subsequently restart it, you get a clean
swap partition. If a distro crashes or hangs or is abruptly
shutdown, the swap space is not deleted, and may lead to
inconsistencies at next reboot. A good article about swap can
be found at 
<a href="http://www.xenotime.net/linux/doc/swap-mini-howto.txt">http://www.xenotime.net/linux/doc/swap-mini-howto.txt</a>.</P>

<P>Install the two OSes: While installing your OS, make sure you
select the right device/partition and mountpoint for each distro.
Do not select "format partition" for the /home partition. </P>

<P>Create user accounts on each OS: Each OS must have its own,
distinct, user accounts. That is, you cannot have the same user
name on both OS. This is because, when you create a user, the OS
adds many hidden files (dot files), to store various
configuration data. Such files may get messed up, if used with
another OS for which they were not made. The /home on my machine
looks like this:</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="misc/parthasarathy/figure3.jpg" ALT="figure-3"><BR>
Figure 3: /home contents</CENTER> 

<P>As the names indicate, "drsuse" is the user on SUSE, and "drubuntu"
is the user on Ubuntu.</P>

<P>Modify GRUB: Linux uses a boot loader called GRUB (GRand Unified
Bootloader) to help you decide at boot time which OS
should run. The behaviour of GRUB is defined in the file 
/boot/grub/menu.lst.  The first Linux should install GRUB on the
MBR.  The second installed Linux should install GRUB on its root
partition.  Here is a screenshot of the menu.lst file on my first
Linux (SUSE Linux):</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="misc/parthasarathy/figure4.jpg" ALT="figure-4"><BR>
Figure 4: GRUB menu.lst file</CENTER> 


<P>Verify using mount or /etc/fstab: The "mount" command is a
very useful command. You can call it without any arguments, in
which case it will display all the mount points and their
respective devices. By examining the mount output of both OSes, you
can confirm that they are indeed using the partitions as you
intended them to use. Here is a mount output of my second distro
(Ubuntu): The file /etc/fstab keeps track of the various
filesystems installed on the system. The file /etc/fstab is like
the horoscope of your system. Each OS you install will have an
/etc/fstab of its own. The /etc/fstab of Ubuntu is shown further
below.</P>

<P>And this is the mount output of my first distro (SUSE) :</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="misc/parthasarathy/figure5.jpg" ALT="figure-5"><BR>
Figure 5: mountpoints</CENTER> 


<P>Notice that on both distros /home is mounted on /dev/sda1. The
SUSE / is at /dev/sdb1, and the Ubuntu / is on /dev/sdb2. Each
distro has been given about 40 GB.</P>


<CENTER><IMG SRC="misc/parthasarathy/figure6.jpg" ALT="figure-6"><BR>
Figure 6: /etc/fstab</CENTER> 

<P>We notice that Ubuntu's swap is /dev/sda3, and SUSE's is
/dev/sda2</P>

<H3>Why to do this?</H3>

<P>It may sound strange to install two Linux distributions on the
same machine, and have two disks where one would do. There are
situations when this is meaningful. For instance, one would like
to be familiar with the finer details of various Linux
distributions. A good Linux professional has to be conversant
with various distributions. We can get confidence only by
actually working on them. It may be a good idea, or even the only
way out, to have both distros on the same machine. We can thus
switch distros, without physically switching between machines.
Each distribution has its own package management mechanism. For
instance, SUSE uses YaST, whereas Ubuntu and Debian look-alikes
use APT.  Each distribution has its favourite desktop interface.
On SUSE, I use KDE.  On Ubuntu, I use the GNOME interface.
These two interfaces are so different from each other. The
internal structure, file hierarchy, startup and shutdown
sequences, and various configuration parameters are all
different between distros. All distros do not carry the same set
of applications.  It is also practical to keep one distro as an
experimental distro, on which we can try our several
"what-if" scenarios, and keep one distro as a stable
operational distro, for serious usage. So, it makes sense to have
two distros on the same machine. On the other hand, keeping two
hard disks is also useful. It would help maintain some kind of a
backup mechanism, or a mirror, for fault-tolerant operations. The
more ambitious user can also configure a RAID, if he/she has two
drives.  (Conditions apply.)</P>

<P>All Linux users know that /home is the directory where all non-root
users' files are stored. Each user gets a sub-directory under this /home
directory. All his/her files are stored inside this sub-directory and
very well protected from other users. In addition, there are several
configuration files specific to each user (usually, files with names
starting with a period), all of which are stored in the respective
user directories. Each distro needs a /home for its users, but it makes
sense to use a single /home shareable by both distros. You save space,
management is easier, taking backups is faster. By putting the /home on
a separate partition (common to both distros), you obtain additional
benefits: You can reinstall or change the distros at will, without
risking /home. Disk access becomes faster, since accesses to /home do
not clash with accesses to other parts of the distro, and swap
operations do not compete with other operations on /home.</P>

<P>In a multitasking OS like Unix/Linux, your disk is constantly
under pressure, to serve two competing and concurrent phenomena:
process state transitions, and swapping (paging). </P> 

<P>Process state transitions: In a multi-tasking OS, the OS keeps
juggling between different tasks (processes), giving the user a
feeling that all programs are running simultaneously. Processes
are shuffled automatically and frequently between the main memory
(RAM) and disk, and vice-versa. Remember, this phenomenon can
occur not just because of your own applications, but also is
provoked by other background processes running in the
background. If you do a "pstree" or "ps -ef" command,
you will be surprised to notice the amazing number of processes
running. There is considerable disk activity going on
because of this phenomenon. </P>

<P>Swapping (paging): At the same time, the disk is also required
for another important function called "virtual memory". When
the system is working on large chunks of data, or data that
require huge disk space, available RAM may not be adequate.
This can occur in situations like when you are trying to invert
a very large matrix, say a 10000 x 10000 real matrix. You may be
working with image-processing applications that handle large
images. If your RAM is not enough, the OS automagically and
cleverly moves unused/unneeded data out to the hard disk, and
brings this data back to RAM whenever needed. The data is
temporarily parked on the disk, in a special area appropriately
called the "swap area" (or swap).</P>

<P>Your system performance can be considerably reduced, if the above
two phenomena are too frequent and occur simultaneously, and on
the same disk. You will notice long periods of silence from your
system, as it recovers from the above two competing activities. In
the arrangement explained in Figure 1, since the swap is on a
different drive, access to the swap will not be affected by
access to the disk due to process switching (and vice-versa).
Your system will appear to run faster!</P>

readers of this article. The author thanks his friends, P.S.
Prasad and Suresh Ramasubramanian, for helping him out when he

<h1>Using Linux to Teach Kids How to Program, 10 Years Later (Part II)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
In last month's article, I talked about the Logo programming
language as a tool to help you introduce mathematics and programming
concepts to kids. This month, I am going to take you one step further
into Logo programming and show you some more advanced concepts like
loops, conditional statements, procedure definition, and (do I dare?)
even the concept of recursion.
</p>

<p>
Before we begin, though, I would like to make a small disclaimer: I've
always thought of Logo as a programming language for kids only, and even
though I've been writing these articles about using Logo to teach kids how
to program, I know of quite a few universities that use Logo even in their
graduate courses, to teach complex techniques in recursion and other
programming topics. Therefore, don't think for a moment that Logo is just a
toy: it's definitely fun <em>and</em> educational.
</p>

<p>
With that said, let's go ahead and learn some more Logo.
</p>

<p>
In Logo, we have the ability to teach our "programmable" turtle new
words. To do that, we use the <em>to</em> keyword. It's with
<em>to</em> that we define our procedures in Logo, and also have the
ability to save our work to disk, which I will discuss later on.
</p>

<h3>Logo's Hello World</h3>

<p>
If you decide to do more research and learn more about Logo on your own,
you will probably see the following procedure as one of the very first
Logo examples:
</p>

<pre class="code">
to square
repeat 4 [fd 100 rt 90]
end
</pre>

<p>
That's how we teach Logo's turtle the word "square". To square means:
<em>Repeat the following 4 times: go forward 100 pixels and turn right 90
degrees</em>. Now, when you call <em>square</em> in the Logo interpreter,
the turtle will draw you the square you are asking for. The only problem
here is that, if you exit your interpreter with the command <em>bye</em>,
the turtle will forget that word, and eventually teaching the same word
over and over again will get pretty boring, even for a kid.
</p>

<p>
<img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_31tgtr85c8_b.png" alt="square">
</p>

<p>
The solution is to save your new procedure (a.k.a. word) into a file,
and load that when you start the interpreter. To save your work use:
</p>

<pre class="code">
? save "square.logo
</pre>

<p>
where, like the <em>help</em> command we talked about last month, the file
name must be preceded with a double quotation mark. Once you save your new
defined word, you will see a text file called square.logo in the same
directory where you started your interpreter.
</p>

<p>
As you start to familiarize yourself with Logo, you will always have the
choice to write your code directly to a text file, and then load it via
the interpreter. To do that:
</p>

<pre class="code">
? load "square.logo
</pre>

<p>
Let's say, once you teach the turtle the word <em>square</em>, you want to
change the definition of it a little. Maybe you want to add colors or
make the square bigger.  Well, Logo will not let you create a new
<em>square</em> word, and it will complain with the following message if
you try it:
</p>

<pre class="code">
? to square
square is already defined
</pre>

<p>
If you want to modify an existing word you taught the turtle, you need
to use the <em>ed</em> command.
</p>

<pre class="code">
? ed "square
</pre>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> For <em>ed</em> to work, you must have the shell
environment $EDITOR set to your favorite text editor. I usually run:
<em>export EDITOR="vi"</em> in my shell before starting my Logo
interpreter.
</p>

<p>
With all that said, I'd like to give you one final and more complex, yet
fun, Logo example. The example below is recorded as if we were typing it
directly into the Logo interpreter, and then saved to a file called
example.logo.
</p>

<pre class="code">
Welcome to Berkeley Logo version 5.6
? to pick_color
&gt; output pick [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15]
&gt; end
pick_color defined
? to colorful_circle :size
&gt; if :size = 1 [stop]
&gt; setpencolor pick_color
&gt; arc 360 :size
&gt; colorful_circle :size - 1
&gt; end
colorful_circle defined
? save "example.logo
</pre>

<p>
In the example above, I teach Logo's turtle two new words:
<em>pick_color</em> and <em>colorful_circle</em>.
</p>

<p>
The word <em>pick_color</em> is basically a function that uses the command
pick to randomly choose a number between 1 and 15. The command
<em>output</em> is used to return the value picked by pick.
</p>

<p>
The word <em>colorful_circle</em> is quite a bit more complex, and it
packs a lot of new Logo features. If you look at the very first line where
colorful_circle is defined with <em>to</em>, we have <em>:size</em> as a
parameter for it. In Logo, variables are identified with a colon (:) in
front of their labels.
</p>

<p>
Then, we have an <em>if</em> statement, checking if <em>:size</em> equals
1, and, if so, to leave the procedure. This <em>if</em> statement is known as a
base case, because colorful_circle is a recursive word, which means it
calls itself to execute a rule, and it will stop doing so only when the
base case is met.
</p>

<p>
With <em>setpencolor pick_color</em>, the turtle will be able to choose
whatever color it wants to draw the next circle it is going to draw.
(<strong>Note:</strong> setpencolor was discussed in last month's article).
</p>

<p>
After a color is picked, and set, it's time to draw a circle with the
<em>arc</em> command. To understand the <em>arc</em> command, let's use
Logo's help. In the interpreter, type:
</p>

<pre class="code">
? help "arc
ARC angle radius

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;draws an arc of a circle, with the turtle at the center, with the
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;specified radius, starting at the turtle's heading and extending
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;clockwise through the specified angle.&nbsp; The turtle does not move.
</pre>

<p>
So, the <em>arc</em> command takes two parameters: an angle and a radius.
Because we want to draw a circle, it makes sense that my arc angle be
360 degrees. The radius, it turns out, will be whatever the
variable <em>:size</em> is. If :size changes, we will have different sized
circles being drawn by the turtle.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we call <em>colorful_circle</em>. Yes, you are seeing it
right: it is the very same word we are teaching the turtle, but we are
subtracting 1 from the original <em>:size</em> for the word. This
completes our recursion. We use recursion in this example to decrease
the <em>:size</em> of the circle the turtle draws, and, when the
<em>:size</em> becomes 1, the turtle stops drawing.
</p>


<h3>Executing example.logo:</h3>

<pre class="code">
Welcome to Berkeley Logo version 5.6
? load "example.logo
? colorful_circle 200
</pre>

<p>
The above will give you the following output:
</p>

<p>
 <img src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_33g8dhb9fw_b.png" alt="example.logo's output">

</p>


<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>
Are you confused yet? Probably not, but that doesn't mean the kids
will get it all at first, so don't get frustrated with them. They don't
need to be able to know recursion to discover Logo. I've said it before,
and I will say it again: enjoy your time with them, teach them the
basics, let them watch you code, let them pick colors, let them choose
shapes on their own, and hopefully someday they will realize that
programming and logical reasoning can be as much fun as things like
playing games or reading a book.

Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?

I offer the following anecdote in belated celebration of National
Punctuation Day (<a href='http://www.nationalpunctuationday.com/'>http://www.nationalpunctuationday.com/</a>) -- which was
September 24th, 2009, but we can hope that it'll prove to be... um...
periodic.

Subject: Comma story
</pre>
An elementary school principal was visiting one of his classes during an
English lesson.  "Why," asked the principal, "are you teaching commas?
They're of no use.  You're wasting time."  The teacher turned to one of
her students, and said "Sarah, please go to the board and write 'The
principal said the teacher is wasting time.'"  Once she had done so, the
teacher told her student, "Now, put commas after 'principal' and
'teacher'."

There's a lot going around at the moment about the metadata in Google
Books, mostly based on the LanguageLog post 'Google Books: A Metadata
Trainwreck' (<a href='http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1701'>http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1701</a>)
</p>

<p>
I mention it, just to quote this part of Google's response
(<a href='http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1701#comment-41758):'>http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1701#comment-41758):</a>
</p>

<p>
'Geoff adds, "And a catalogue of copyright entries from the Library of
Congress listed under 'Drama' — though I had to wonder if maybe that
was just Google's little joke."
</p>

<p>
Hey now. We would never ingest our own mirth into metadata records.
There's too much there already. Like the time one of our partner
libraries supplied us with a catalog record for a turkey baster. Not a
book about turkey basting. An actual turkey baster, presumably to be
found in the stacks. One European library classified Darwin's Origin
of Species as fiction. And there's a copyright record for a book that
has no writer, only a psychic who received the text "clairaudiently."'

&gt; Have you ever been rejected for a loan by other loan companies?
</pre>

<p>
No, but then I don't trust the banks.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Do you need a fast loan that is guaranteed?
</pre>

<p>
Sure, I can ask a banker, they're impartial, trustworthy and certainly
most of the banks in the UK aren't under the tax-payers control, so
it's a no-brainer really,
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Are you behind in your mortgage loan, child support, car loan, school loans?
</pre>

<p>
No, I live in a tent.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Are you getting ready to open up a new business?
</pre>

<p>
I think the doors to Debenhams open at 0700 these days, but it's been a while.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Are getting ready to get married and need fast cash?
</pre>

<p>
Heh -- the wife's already spent it by then anyway.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Then we can help.
</pre>

<p>
Great -- I knew bankers were untrustworthy what with their bonuses,
but I had no idea in order to get ""alternative"" loans I needed to
think about opening the doors of my business, and then get married in
record time.
</p>

<p>
Damn, I will have to bear that in mind next time.  Silly me!

Yeah, that kind of thing tends to give you a bit of armor, or at least a
sense of amusement (or possibly boredom, after a while) when some
slavering net.freakjob starts threatening and attacking you. I've also
recently learned - and I'm not sure that the lesson has quite sunk in,
so at some point, the Universe will teach it to me <strong>harder</strong> - to set a
clock on the idiots. They can continue their blithering as long as I
find it amusing; after that point, they get told "your nickel has run
out. Behave, or get shut off - NOW."
