<h1>Away Mission - Upcoming in October</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<h3>Silicon Valley CodeCamp 09 -- Free</h3>

<p>
Oct 3-5, Foothill College, Los Altos, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.SiliconValley-CodeCamp.com/Register.aspx">http://www.SiliconValley-CodeCamp.com/Register.aspx</a>
</p> 

<p>
It's been running for several years and it's always been <em>free</em>.
Lunch is provided by the sponsors, as well.
</p> 
 
<p>
I confess that I haven't gone to the CodeCamp before (time conflicts),
but have been to the related Product Manager's Camp, and it was worth
the price of admission. I do know people who have gone before, and all
report a positive experience.   
</p> 

<p>
Using the now-familiar unconference format, volunteer speakers sign
themselves up for sessions and some slots are open for spontaneous
topics.   That makes the agenda a little fluid but you'd only be risking
some weekend time.
</p> 



<h3>Oracle OpenWorld 2009</h3> 

<p>
Oct 11-15, San Francisco, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/openworld/">http://www.oracle.com/us/openworld/</a>
</p> 

<p>
The Oracle behemoth keeps acquiring both major application brands, as
well as open source companies. Previously, it released an
Oracle-supported version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This year, it
swooped up all of Sun Microsystems with its many open source gems,
including Java, Solaris, and MySQL. What will be Oracle's next foray
into the open source universe?
</p> 

<p>
In September, ahead of Oracle OpenWorld, it announced the world's
fastest database machine based on high-end Sun Microsystems X86
hardware. See a summary of its impressive performance in the News
Bytes column, this month.  
</p> 

<p>
So far, Oracle has promised to keep Java free and open, and to also
support MySQL. It now distributes both a Linux distribution and a version
of Unix. It's been a major contributor to the btrfs file system, and
now owns ZFS. What will Oracle do next??
</p> 

<p>
The last Oracle OpenWorld handled logistics well, for an event with over
40K attendees, and offered a lot of content. It also offers a lot of
value, with its Expo pass that includes keynotes, the expo, and the
end-of-conference reception. The main conference is expensive, unless
you can get a customer or partner discount.
</p>

<h3>Agile Open Northern California</h3>

<p>
Oct 15-16, Fort Mason, San Francisco, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.agileopencalifornia.com/registrationcampaign/promo001/">http://www.agileopencalifornia.com/registrationcampaign/promo001/</a>
</p> 

 
<p>
This event is organized by Dayspring, Inc., and is a very low-cost
event at $250: two days of Agile theory and practice with 32 sessions,
lunch, and a networking reception. Also organized like an unconference,
this event uses the Open Space Technology framework to organize
sessions.
</p> 

<p> Here's a link to the wiki for the 2008 proceedings:

<h3>eComm Fall 2009 Europe</h3>

<p>
Oct. 28-30, Westergasfabriek, Amsterdam, NL<br>
<a href="http://www.amiando.com/ecomm2009-europe.html">http://www.amiando.com/ecomm2009-europe.html</a>
</p> 

<p>
This is the first eComm conference in Europe, but the two preceding
eComm events in the US have been stellar.
</p> 

<p>
The mix of speakers goes from major telecoms to the very open, very
alternative developers on the fringe.  It's a challenging environment for
both speakers and audience, with short 15 min. sessions and even
shorter 5 min. bullet sessions. There is hardly a dull moment at eComm,
and some conversations are just short of amazing. If you are anywhere
near Amsterdam, consider checking this one out.
</p> 

<p>
Here are links to content from the most recent eComm:
