[[[  Hello, I've been attending Scale5x. Here is my first report. - Kapil  ]]]
</p>

<p>
Don Marti spoke about "Going beyond User-Friendly to
User-Intimate with desktop tweaking power".
</p>

<p>
He began the talk with a description of how various platforms and
GUIs have evolved the Human Interface Guidelines and this was a bit
worrisome since I didn't want to hear much more about those. But I
need not have worried---he was just setting up an obstacle so that he
could show us the ways around it!
</p>

<p>
Thomas Adam would have found this talk interesting since the subtext
of this first 3/4 of talk was "How can we make Gnome/Metacity behave
more like fvwm/scwm/sawfish when we want it to?" Marti gave
a number of tips on how to use the tools "xev", "xwininfo",
"xlsclients", "xsel" and friends to make it possible to provide a
command-line/keyboard/scriptable interface to applications have only
dialog boxes and mouse clicks.
</p>

<p>
In the last quarter of his talk Marti talked about some new ways of
interacting with the computer. The simplest of these are the extra keys
on laptops which are not handled by the keyboard driver. More
unconventional are things like the hard-disk acceleration detection
driver on some laptops; you can use this to detect the orientation of
your laptop to flip the screen. A rather cool idea was using your hand
to cover the wireless antenna and have a program that detects Wi-Fi
signal strength use this in some way---for example, as an application
launcher or even a "theremin".
</p>

<p>
Marti then outlined some dangers of this way of tweaking the
interface:
</p>
<pre>
	(a) Your computer truly becomes personal. Soon no one
	else can use it and you can't use someone else's computer
	either!
	(b) This kind of programming really sucks up time without
	necessarily contributing to the community ... unless you give
	a talk about it or write an article explaining things.
</pre>
<p>
All in all a fun talk and a fun way to start the day.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Roger Klorese from Xen spoke about "Xen: The Open Source industry
standard for virtualisation".
</p>

<p>
For those of our readers who don't know this yet, "Xen" is a system
for running multiple "virtual" systems on one box. As the commonly
available systems today have more and more unused resources, running
virtual systems is one way to get more out of your box.
</p>

<p>
The mechanism used by "Xen" is called "paravirtualisation" which I
will try to explain briefly below to the best of my understanding.
</p>

<p>
There is always a "master" system which we can call "host"; the
others are called "guest" systems. In older virtualisation techniques,
system calls generated in the "guest" system were trapped and passed
to the "host" to be handled. This trapping was done by generating a
fault whenever such a system call was executed.
</p>

<p>
In paravirtualisation this fault generation is avoided in one
of two ways; in either case this leads to smoother running "guest"
systems. One is by re-building the kernel of the "guest" virtual
system so that it interacts with a certain well-defined "API" for
system calls called the "Hypervisor API". The other is through
"hardware assist" where the CPU is given a "Hypervisor Table" by which
it re-directs calls to the "Hypervisor". In either case there is a
Hypervisor layer which is <strong>not</strong> a full system but merely a kind of
system-call router. Thus the Hypervisor could be made to route the
system call to the "host" or could also be made to route the system
call directly to the hardware---the hypervisor configuration tools
can be used to dynamically change this routing information.
</p>

<p>
The speaker clearly had a problem about where to pitch his talk---the
jargon did not grow steadily but came and went in waves. While some
of "Xen" is available as Free and Open Source there is also a product
that is released by the the same group. The lines between what are
features of the Open Source version and the product version were
often not clearly pointed out, which made this occasionally sound
like a marketing talk. This feeling was accentuated by digs at the
"opposition".
</p>

<p>
In summary, the whole game of "virtualisation" is clearly an
interesting one to get involved in during the coming year(s). The talk
could have been better.

</p>

<p>
Jono Bacon of Canonical spoke about "How to Herd Cats and Influence
People". This was basically a talk about how to build the community
around an open source project.
</p>

<p>
Jone clearly had a lot of skill in doing this as he got the audience
chanting and interacting with him---he even encouraged some Gentoo
hecklers! He explained his experience with Ubuntu and Canonical and
creating the community around the Ubuntu project---this is his primary
purpose at Canonical. According to him there are four important
aspects of this work:
</p>
<pre>
	1. Find good people.
	2. Organise them in teams.
	3. Make an overall structure which keeps
	   these teams working with each other.
	4. Create a mechanism to bring in new people.
</pre>
<p>
Though this talk was very entertaining in many ways I can't honestly
say that I brought away much more than that from it.
</p>

<p>
In particular, the aspect of "Herding Cats", which I thought referred
to the fact that these are all quite smart people who consequently
do not "herd" easily, was not discussed much. Is the Ubuntu community
less visibly "flame"-y than the Debian or Gentoo community because it
is young or is it something in the way they organise themselves? A
discussion of this question is what I would have liked to hear.
</p>

<p>
Alex Ionescu spoke about "ReactOS--bridging the gap between Windows
and Open Source". He is the lead developer in a project to construct
a clean-room implementation of an open source replacement of the
Windows NT kernel. This replacement is the core of ReactOS.
</p>

<p>
Alex explained that the motivation for this work was from many
directions. There is the perennial inter-operability issue; to help
us make use of documents and/or environments that are meant for that
90-95% of the computer user world that is still on Windows. There is
the research interest in a operating system that has a fundamentally
different design from the monolithic Linux or BSD kernel that we are
used to.  There is also the desire to play games that are written
for Windows-only, or more generally to run that one application that
some users have not found a Free and Open Source alternative for. He
<strong>didn't</strong> mention the users who might <strong>need</strong> ReactOS when MicroSoft
stops supporting Windows XP and starts requiring users to upgrade to
Vista.
</p>

<p>
Alex explained that the kernel is working fine but there are still a
lot of issues to be sorted out---especially with the layers over the
kernel. In particular, the GUI of Windows is driven through the 
"Win32K" layer for which there is currently no complete replacement
in ReactOS. However, they are currently able to run Open Source
applications on ReactOS --- including OpenOffice, Evolution and
Firefox. Unfortunately, they cannot run MS-Office, Exchange or
Explorer just yet.
</p>

<p>
Alex tried to motivate the audience to get involved with this project,
as it has a number of benefits to the Free and Open Source community
in addition to the ones mentioned above.
</p>
<pre>
	1. Programs get testing and debugging in an environment that
	is different from the standard one---this points out some
	flaws in the login.
	2. Programs meant for Windows can be debugged and traced
	which is much more difficult to do with the native
	environment without signing various NDA's and buying
	expensive tools.
</pre>
<p>
This was a well organised and well presented talk. I went for it
because of my interest in operating systems and also in order to
underline my support for the hard work done by a group of dedicated
developers. It is difficult to get rid of the feeling that this
project will get little more than that from most of us.

<p>
Chris Dibona spoke on "Open Source licensing, a review with some
corner cases". Chris Dibona is now working for Google so I thought it
would be a different point of view from that which Rick Moen has
been sharing with us. In short, it was <strong>not</strong> (though Chris did not use
the term "badgeware")--Rick had prepared me too well.
</p>

<p class="editorial">[[[ Kapil is referring to <a
href="../134/moen.html">(OSI,
GAP, and "Exhibit B" licences)</a> and
these followup discussions--(<a href="../135/lg_talkback2.html">Talkback:134/moen.html</a>, <a href="lg_mail2.html">Issue 136 Mailbag, Part 2</a>). - Kat ]]]</p>

<p>
For those who have been following Rick's postings to TAG this will be
old hat but let me try to review what Chris said anyway. He explained
why trying to get credit in various ways:
</p>
<pre>
	1. By a direct request for payment.
	2. By requiring explicit attribution ("badgeware").
	3. By requiring acceptance of philosophy ("don't use this for
	   the military").
	4. By requiring the purchase of specific hardware.
</pre>
<p>
and so on, leads to licenses which are not open source. To those who
need any of that Chris' advice was "Don't try to be Open
Source---it's OK! Just don't claim to be Open Source either!"
</p>

<p>
He had two bits of advice. One was to read Professor Ed Felten's
deposition to the court regarding the relation between code and free
speech. The other was that we should all read the text of the GPLv3.
</p>

<p>
All in all a great talk and a great way for me to start day 2 ---
(Yes I was late getting there).

<p>
Ted Haeger and Erin Quill from Novell/SUSE spoke on "Linux,
Virtualisation and Virtualisation Management".
</p>

<p>
I wrote earlier how there were talks on Xen and virtualisation and
given some explanation of how I understand these concepts. In this
talk the speakers wanted to show us how easy it is to install a new
virtual machine under SUSE Enterprise Linux and how easy it is to
manage such a machine.
</p>

<p>
The installation was really easy but I wished they had explained the
steps a little more than saying "you point here" and "you click
there" and (but for an occasional "cluck" when the error box appears)
you are done. Just talking through the steps that are happening under
the hood so that we could visualise what was happening would
have helped those of us who wanted something a bit more technical.
</p>

<p>
The second part, about virtual machine management, was also quite
impressive with regard to the ease of management via a graphical
interface. All the resource allocation of and for virtual machines was
done from a point-click-drag-drop kind of interface. It is clear that
SUSE have fully absorbed the GUI paradigm for system administrators
that Novell perhaps pioneered.
</p>

<p>
It is perhaps also clear that I do not particularly like this
paradigm. If you do not know what is happening under the hood and
cannot tinker with it a bit, you should probably not be doing system
administration---IMHO. Still, the talk showcased some impressive
prettying-up of the Xen virtualisation system.
</p>

<p>
The last talk (for me) at Scale5x was the one by Don Armstrong on
"From Sarge to Etch". Don Armstrong is a Debian Developer who among
other things is one of the people managing the Bug Tracking System
(BTS).
</p>

<p>
Now any review by me of a talk by a Debian person is probably very
likely to be biased, but I thought it was a very rich talk. If
anything, Don had too much material (which is a common error of
graduate students!). So let me summarise the main points:
</p>

<pre>
	1. How does Debian release? What users can do to help.
	   Some tools to help users help Debian.
	2. Using "aptitude". Why "aptitude" surpasses "apt-get".
	3. Upgrading from Sarge to Etch.
	4. Pointers to obtaining information about Debian,
	   Debian developers and Debian packages.
</pre>
<p>
One important point he made which may seem contradictory is that
Debian users who keep wanting Debian to release "etch" as stable will
actually benefit from checking it on a "test" machine and filing
bugs. While this may increase the RC bug counti, it will improve the
quality of the release. Furthermore, fresh information on a bug can
often help track it down. So his message to all Debian users was-- keep
finding and filing those bugs. (Hint: Use "reportbug" when you do.)
</p>

<p>
The heart of "apt-get" is "libapt" and the former was meant as a
"demo" program--which achieved "world domination". The newer
curses and command-line program "aptitude" is a meant as a more
complete interface to "libapt". In particular, it can do everything
that "apt-get" can do and more. One important addition is that it can
give hints for conflict resolution. Another is that it can keep track
of packages that are installed only as dependencies--in other words
it incorporates some features of "deborphan"/"debfoster". Then there
are pattern searches. All this with good documentation. Check out 
"aptitude" and you will enjoy it--the "etch" version is even better!
</p>

<p>
The entire text of Don's talk and host of other information (like the
re-usable bits of his "rc" files) can be found on his web site at
<a href="http://www.donarmstrong.com">http://www.donarmstrong.com</a>. (I was surprised and pleased to see that his
"graphical" interface is "ion" and his chosen method of creating a
presentation is "latex-beamer".)
</p>

<p>
A great way to end.
</p>

</p>

<p>
One of the points of going to such conventions is to meet people.
</p>

<p>
I met faces that were only familiar from photographs--our editor
and our TAG editor. Indeed, I met Ben and Kat on Day 2. That was
really great but we could not chat much given the tempo of talks and
so on.
</p>

<p>
Part of the adventure of getting to Scale5x was exactly that--getting
there. I had decided that since it was only myself that was being
transported--no other people and no equipment--it was time to be
environment-friendly and use Public Transportation. "Public Transportation
in LA? You must be kidding!" At least that was the response of many people
I talked to. In the end, the journey by bus and metro was rather easy. It
was long but far from boring. I had some mathematics to keep me company, but
there was all the different kinds of LA that one can only see while riding
in a bus.
</p>

<p>
I have not been to many FOSS meetings in the past--preferring to be a
mailing list person. However, one thing that one notices is that there
is surge of companies coming to these meetings nowadays. The technical
content of the talks was also rather low--perhaps this why it was
called "Expo" and not "DevConf". However, most of the talks which I
attended were well-prepared and useful.
</p>

<p>
All in all a great experience. Since it was Kat who pointed out in
her posting to TAG that "scale5x" was happening just in my temporary
neighbourhood, a big thank you to her as well.

Kapil Hari Paranjape has been a ``hack''-er since his punch-card days.
Specifically, this means that he has never written a ``real'' program.
He has merely tinkered with programs written by others. After playing
with Minix in 1990-91 he thought of writing his first program---a
``genuine'' *nix kernel for the x86 class of machines. Luckily for him a
certain L. Torvalds got there first---thereby saving him the trouble
(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those
days---much to the dismay of many around him who think he should
concentrate on mathematical research---which is his paying job. The
interplay between actual running programs, what can be computed in
principle and what can be shown to exist continues to fascinate him.
