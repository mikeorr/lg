Regarding "2-cent tip: Removing the comments out of a configuration file":
</p>

<p>
I don't like to invoke Yet Another Interpreter (Perl, Python, etc.) for simple 
problems, when I've already got a perfectly good one (the bash shell) 
running, and all those wonderful GNU programs. So I often view 'classic' 
config files (for httpd, sshd, etc) via the following, which I store as 
~/bin/dense:
</p>

<pre>
!#/bin/bash
# Tested on GNU grep 2.5.1
grep -Ev ^\([[:space:]]*#\)\|\(^$\) $1
</pre>

<p>
~/bin is in my path, so the command is simply 'dense PATH/FILE'. This code 
strips comments, indented comments, and blank lines.
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you need this frequently, and bash is your login shell, a better 
approach might be to just add:
<pre>
alias dense='grep -Ev ^\([[:space:]]*#\)\|\(^$\)'
</pre>
to your ~/.bashrc, since it's so small, thus loading it into your environment 
at login. Don't forget to source the file via: 
<pre>
'. ~/.bashrc'
</pre>
after the edit, if you need it immediately!
</p>

You know, I'm often puzzled when people say that. Whether you have Bash
running or not, your script launches another instance of it - *as an
interpreter.* The memory footprint of bash plus grep is not going to be
much smaller than that of Perl, either. You also lose the capability of
(easily) writing the result back to the original file. In what way is
this better?

As far as I'm concerned, if the process does not take some huge amount

I just finished teaching a class on shell scripting, so I just can't
resist. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> You should <em>always</em> escape the command string that you send
to a program - usually by single-quoting it - to avoid having the shell
interpret it. For example, it's quite conceivable that a shell could
interpret '$\)' as a variable - or that it could treat the '#' in the
string as the beginning of a comment. Bash can parse your construct
correctly - but 'csh' can't:

<p>
<pre class='code'>
% grep -Ev ^\([[:space:]]*#\)\|\(^$\) /etc/passwd
Illegal variable name.

<p>
Is there any reason to have those parentheses in the first part of the
regex? It works just fine without them. I would also extend the
definition of 'blank lines' to include lines consisting solely of
whitespace, and get rid of all those useless backslashes:
</p>

<pre>
egrep -v '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' /etc/hosts

The bit about launching another interpreter is forehead-slappingly correct, of 
course. I have systems where bash is the only interpreter present. Sendmail's 
restricted shell is disabled, etc. I wonder if I'm not subconciously making 
peace with that situation, rather than growling about it.
</p>

<p>
My 'dense' actually does other things via switches, such as reporting on local 
modifications to config files via a mandated '# LOCALMOD date name reason' 
standard, etc.
</p>

<p>
But it just growed, and most of it is far too nasty (non-standard switches, 
etc.) to ever be seen by the public. I just grabbed the two most relevant 
lines, and pasted. You'll have seen my shebang typo, for instance. 
The 'dense' that's really in use does have the advantage of actually being 
runable...
</p>

<p>
Regarding the bit about writing back to the original file. I suppose that 
could be useful, but it's not something I'd want (or be allowed) to do, in 
the case of classic config files. In which case, redirection is all that's 
needed.

No need to resist, as it's an excellent point. As mentioned above, portability 
isn't <strong>currently</strong> as much of an issue here as it might be at other 
installations. But greater portability still wins--especially when it's 
achieved at the expense of a pair of single quotes. Things do change (though 
glacially slowly, for good reasons, on the server set I'm thinking of), and 
the machine(s) I personally <strong>use</strong> are fairly standard Linux installs.

The parenthesis and backslashes may be an artifact of dragging this over from 
some (possibly ancient) version of HP-UX. Provenance might be hard to trace, 
particularly as it likely predates the last <strong>two</strong> version control systems.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; ``
&gt; egrep -v '^[[:space:]]*(#|$)' /etc/hosts
&gt; ''
</pre>

<p>
Simpler, more portable, more powerful. What's not to like? Well, other than  
needing to work late a couple of nights next week, grovelling through 'dense' 
and a couple of other scripts that are likely just as old. There won't be 
time during what I laughingly refer to as normal hours, so the lesson here is 
plain. Do not get involved in discussions like this when the weather is nice, 
for you may find yourself working late. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
