<p>
I'm doing well. Thanks for asking.
</p>

<p>
Suit? You can blend me a nice suit? I'll take a classic
single-breasted charcoal gray suit  with matching trousers. And maybe
your blenders can choose me a nicely contrasting tie that will blend
into the background and not stand out too much.
</p>

<p>
So you have a side business in Dotcom glass? Sorry to hear about that,
I know the dotcom crash was hard. It's good to see you survived it and
are still selling blended glass. As it happens, my windshield is
broken, could you make me a new one? It'll have to be clear color
because I need to see through it. You can mail it to me at [address].
</p>

<p>
Thanks, and I hope you have a nice day.
</p>

No-no, Mike; you should go all Chinese on them in return.

amusing in direct translation.)

If you ask politely, they'll even blend up a Saville Row label to go
with it. Heck, the label will probably look pore professional than the
suit! Long practice shows results, you know.

After a crash, that's all glass can be! But, y'know - when life gives
you lemons, make lemonade. In fact, that's probably how they got started
in the blender business (no, wait, that was "bisiness") in the first
place...

<p>
Only if you're willing to receive it in its... um... raw form. It's much
more healthy and natural that way. You'll receive it in no more than 12
or 16 weeks, in 20 bags of 1 lb. each (the freight is much lower that
way) - plus they'll throw in a a FREE gallon of glue! They're sure to
"appriciate" your "bisiness".
