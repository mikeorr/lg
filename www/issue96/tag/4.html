Dear All,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I decided to upgrade my kernel from 2.4.20 to 2.6.0-test2. "No probem",
I thought. So off I trotted to www.kernel.org, selected my UK mirror and
downloaded it, and bunzip/untarred it in <TT>/usr/src.</TT>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I had planned to implement an ACPI/swsusp patch so that I could
effectively make use of some of the more advanced features of my laptop
in terms of power management. I applied to ACPI patch fine, but the
swsusp patch didn't work, so I removed it.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I copied my <TT>/boot/config-2.4.20</TT> to <TT>/usr/src/.config</TT> and ran a "make
menuconfig". Yay, no problems. I simply added my ACPI settings,
eye-balled the rest of the options, removed support for things like ADFS
and AFS (Andrew's File System) and did a classic:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>fakeroot make-kpkg --revision=rev0.1 kernel_image modules_image
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Prior to this I had installed and setup "ccache". For those of you who
haven't got this: "apt-get install ccache". Seriously, I recommend it.
It makes successive compilations much faster; by ccache caching the
results. But I digress...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The make went fine, and I was soon "dpkg -i <TT>../kernel_image-rev0.1*.deb</TT>"
I did notice that as this was happening, I got a lot of "** Unresolved
Symbols **", but that was alright, because it was in modules that I was
never really going to load, and had put them there for a "just in case"
scenario.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So I went through the motions of "liloconfig" et al and was soon
rebooting my nice new kernel. I have to say that I am impressed thus far
with 2.6.0-test2. Finally Framebuffer support is getting better with the
maintainer of that section actually removing that huge flashing block
and replacing it with a static "_" cursor

</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As I watched the screen, nothing out of the ordinary was happening, and
I was soon at a login prompt. I did notice that "acpid" (the acpi
software control) didn't load due to "QM_MODULES function not
implemented". Odd I thought. So I logged in (as 'root'), and did a:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>lsmod
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
hmm, I got the following error message:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
QM_MODULES function not implemented
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
"Ok", I thought, how about this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>depmod -a
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
hmm, same error message.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I wasn't sure what was causing this error, and it was nothing that I had
seen before. So I did the following:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.0-test2 &amp;&amp; find . | xargs grep -i qm_modules
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
...guess what? I got nothing! Grep had let me down 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">. So now I am
thinking that maybe the error isn't listed in any of the textual based
files but that it is statically built into the ".o" files. So....
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>find . | xargs strings | grep -i qm_modules
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
...sigh. Nothing, zilch. Of course this last command is slightly
superfluous because in order for the string "qm_modules" to be there, it
would have to come from one of the ".c" files that created the compiled
object file, but I couldn't see how the command could hurt. Now what
should I do???
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
.... enter "strace" 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> One of my friends. At this point I was thinking
that maybe I should see just where the "depmod -a" command was failing.
Why did I choose this command and not "lsmod"? Well, in order for the
kernel to know about it's modules and dependencies, it has to make use
of "<TT>/lib/modules/$</TT>(uname -r)/modules.dep". So, I typed:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>strace -o ~/.strace/depmod_2.6.0-test2 depmod -a
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
had a quick look in the file and yes, sure as I was I could see it
complaining about "qm_modules". Pah, makes no sense to me, really.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
What I did next was to boot my "old" 2.4.20 kernel. "liloconfig" is
sufficiently clever to actually keep your old kernel for you. I did
that, and ran:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>strace -o ~/.strace/depmod_2.4.20 depmod -a
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
had a look and that worked fine. Hmmmm, what could be wrong? I ran a
"diff" on the two files, but my brain just cannot make any head nor tail
of what it all means.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I cannot see what, or more importantly where the "QM_MODULES" function
exists. The fact that grepping the kernel source tree returns no
results, suggests that this is a function that is called from no where
within the kernel but rather externally, perhaps from one of the rarer
"glibc" libs?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tried a google/linux search, but found nothing conclusive. Perhaps I
have compiled something incorrectly in the kernel? I have tried
compiling it many times now, but still the same result. While I am aware
that 2.6.0-test3 exists, the ACPI patch only works for the test-2
branch.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Three files to help you...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1. depmod_2.4.20
2. depmod_2.6.0-test2
3. diff
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
They can be found here:

My thanks to Hugo Mills for very kindly hosting them. Cheers, Hugo

(number 3 is the difference between the two files. I neglected to do a
unified diff).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any ideas, tips, points of error would be appreciated.

1. Problem with module loading.

2. Problem with Software Suspend (swsusp).

Has any tagger got 2.6.0-testn working successfully?
</blockQuote>

I did manage to solve problem (1) --- one needs a newer version of
modutils.

I've been running 2.5.x and 2.6.x kernels most of the time for most
of the last year on vega (my living room desktop system).  One of my
housemates (Tabitha) used that system's console more than I did for
most of the last year (she was made to sit in the "comfy chair" 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">).
I used it quite alot from the other machine in the living room
(usually booted off of KNOPPIX, with ssh and X11 forwarding making it
mostly just a really smart terminal).  (An Xterminal with a local
running copy of OpenOffice.org ... hmmmm).

Problem (2) eludes me. The swsusp patch from swsusp.sf.net for 2.4.21 is
working fine with 2.4.21. I notice that swsusp in 2.6.0 has run into
stormy weather developer-wise so maybe that's the reason.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
My main reason for trying out 2.6.0-textn was the support for the i815
framebuffer---just can't do without the Penguin at boot-time

I did mention that the original reason I was using 2.6.0-test2 was to do
with the swsusp patch. Because 2.6.0 at the time was VERY new (in terms of
the latest stable release), the swsusp people hadn't yet released one that
would work with that version -- hence I dropped it from my patch'd kernel.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I did, however, apply the ACPI patch so that actions such as "lid_close"
on my laptop would be registered by the kernel.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Having updated "module-init-tools" (as I mentioned in my original thread
to this) it still didn't work -- what I <EM>did</EM> do to try and fix it was to
NOT use "make-kpkg" to compile the kernel. This then fixed my problem.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The only thing i can think of here (albeit loosely) is that fakeroot
caused some weird permissions and/or the package that was produced was
corrupt somehow.
