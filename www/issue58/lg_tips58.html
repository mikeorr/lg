Hi there,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Regarding the 'File With Device Information' in the September Issue, you
should also mention that if you have the <tt>pciutils</tt> package installed,
<TT>/sbin/lspci</TT> is much more useful than eyeballing <TT>/proc/pci</TT>.
 Just my thoughts....

Dear Editor,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
here is another 2cent tip.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm forced to print to a printer connected to a Windows box. This box is
networked with my Linux box and I wanted to setup a working samba printer-
I had problems setting up the printer under Suse 6.4 The passwords and
resource names were correct, but smbclient couldn't connect to the Windows box.
I simply added the commandline option "<TT>-I 192.168.0.2</TT>" in the file
<TT>/etc/apsfilterrc.stcolor</TT> in the line <tt>REMOTE_PRINTER=</tt>
(I'm using the stcolor driver from GhostScript. Check for the file
corresponding to the printer driver you've selected in Yast.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The option above specifies the IP address of the machine where the printer is
connected to. It now works without any problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

cheers, Matthias

<BLOCKQUOTE>
First off - the guy was right, it IS illegal pretty much anywhere in the
world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Second - it won't work because the modems are engineered for a different
kind of communications channel  - RF connections have different
characteristics compared to phone lines.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Amateur radio ( which requires a license obtained by taking at test) has
had a low speed connection for around 15 years called packet radio.
There is quite a bit of support for this technology within Linux (including
modems implemented using sound cards...) These will work over an FM radio
channel.
(CB is AM/SSB which has a much lower quality) and usually only work
at 1200 to 9600 baud.  Not blazingly fast.

Hope this clears up some points.

There's MI/X, the MicroImages X server.  Some people like it.

I am a Linux newbie with a significant MS Windows background
(several MS certs, etc) and I am trying to wean myself off of my Windows
partition at work. The only thing holding me back is MS
Exchange/Outlook. Is there an Exchange client for Linux? I have looked
high and low and can't find one. I hae configured the server (I
administer it) to be a pop3 server, so I can get my mail that way, but I
loose a lot of the functionality that way. Any help would be
appreciated.

According to a message on the linux-admin list, TradeSuite
(they have a server, too) can be found at <A HREF="http://www.bynari.com"

Looks like the client is free though the Exchange support might
not be.  Oh yeah, and Exchange can be told to serve its mail
up as webmail... maybe that will do until your company can
transition to a more flexible mail system

...for a fairly decent and simple explanation, see Hans de Goede's

I am looking for some software that will talk to my tape library. I have
looked at several different commercial packages, but none of them really
work the way I need them to.  I would like to find an application that
would tell me what tapes are in the library (by reporting back the bar
codes), then load the tapes that I select into the drives I want. Then
I can run taper/tar/cpio/mt to my hearts content. I could write my own
software, but I am lazy.

Yes, at least one of the links from <a href="http://www.linmodems.org"

of a Wallace and Gromit fan who keeps track of which cheap store

are software controlled.  Arrgh

Look at <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net/">freshmeat.net</a> for the app

Dear James,
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
I used your answer for the 'telnet - connection closed by foreign
host' to get telnet working on a custom red hat install I did.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
I begin to think that I left off a package that I really needed when
I selected packages in the 'select package' window during the install.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>
I haven't yet found a description of which individual RPM modules
(inetd in.telnetd) are rolled up into what packages that can be selected on
the package selection window in the install screen.
Any help you can give will be much appreciated.

If you know which file you want, but not what RPM it's in,
this script will do the trick ($1 = directory full of rpms,
$2 = file you are seeking)

	for i in *.rpm ; do rpm -qpl $i | grep -q $2 &amp;&amp; echo $i ; done
