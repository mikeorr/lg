<h1>A Brief Introduction to Network Printing with CUPS</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
Tired of hassles with printers not intended for Linux and
the endless compromises they involve, I finally decided to buy a
color laser printer with a network card.
There were several factors involved in making this decision:
<ul>

<li><strong>Cost</strong><br/>

Although laser printers are still fairly expensive,
in the long run it should turn out to have been worth the money,
considering the waste of paper, ink, and my time in the past
fighting hardware not seriously supported by the manufacturer under Linux.

<li><strong>Quality</strong><br/>

For non-professional photographic requirements
ink-jet is still a better choice, but
the quality of laser printers over time remains excellent
(until they start to run low on toner).
I have had ink-jets continue smearing the paper even after
replacing the cartridge (due to the built-in print-head).

<li><strong>Independence</strong><br/>

The motivation for a network card in the printer was
to obtain as much independence from hardware as possible.
It should not be necessary to boot a PC and copy a file
from the notebook onto the PC just to print it.

<li><strong><span style="color: red;">Noise and Emissions</span></strong><br/>

Laser printers produce distinct odors and can be quite loud.
They really don't belong in the same room with anyone trying
to concentrate on something.
This one does go into power-saving mode but it takes about 15 minutes
for the fan to shut down.

</ul>
</p>

<p>
But the consequences of this decision were not trivial.
SuSE (at current writing at 9.3, I'm at 9.2) has been installing CUPS
behind the scenes for several releases.
Since the printer commands are pretty much the same as those used
under lprng, there never was any real need to learn much about CUPS.
Well, not until the network printer arrived and
then very quickly the fun began.
</p>

<p>
Just one example of the problems:
although the documentation says that the password wanted when logging in
to admin is the root password, that has never worked for me.
</p>

<p>
However, as usual, if you know what needs to be done,
CUPS really isn't that difficult to work with.
Assuming that CUPS has already been installed on the machine
in question, here is my list of the steps to install a
network printer on it under CUPS.
You will need to do this on every machine that is to have
access to this printer.
Note that in the following, the installation instructions
of the manufacturer are irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
Make sure you select a printer for which the manufacturer provides a PPD
(Postscript Printer Definition) since only the manufacturer can produce the PPD
needed to make optimum use of the hardware.
Actually, this is important whether the printer attaches directly to a PC
or via the LAN.
The printer I selected didn't have a PPD on the CD-ROMs that came with it,
but a little time searching the Internet pointed me at a file that had
two - one for the black and white variety, and one for color.
</p>

As root, do the following:

<ol>
<li>
In /etc/cups/cupsd.conf comment out
<code>AuthType, AuthClass and AuthGroupName</code>
<li>
Add "<code>cupsd : ALL</code>" to /etc/hosts.allow
<li>
Copy the PPD for the printer into /usr/share/cups/model/
<li>
Restart CUPS with "/etc/init.d/cups restart"

<li>
As some (non-root) user, issue the following command
(almost verbatim from the CUPS documentation):
<pre>
	/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p net_printer -E -m printer.ppd \
		-v socket://192.168.0.1
</pre>
<ul>
<li>
"net_printer" is the name to be assigned to the printer and
can be any text string.
If there is only one printer, the name won't need to be used in
any print commands.
<li>
"printer.ppd" is the name of the PPD file you placed in /usr/share/cups/model/.
<li>
The IP-address I had previously assigned through the front panel
on the printer but CUPS includes a command, arp, with which to do this
by using the Ethernet MAC address.
</ul>
<li>
Then check on the status of printers: "lpstat -p -d".
The output should look something like:
<pre>
	printer net_printer is idle.  enabled since Jan 01 00:00
	system default destination: net_printer
</pre>
</ol

<p>
The line "system default destination" is important.
That is where Mozilla, Opera, OpenOffice, and all their friends will be
printing if not told otherwise when you ask them to print something.
CUPS' web interface "http://localhost:631/admin" is a convenient
way to change the default printer.
</p>

<p>
Recent converts to Linux should note that a PPD is analogous to but quite
different from the notorious driver.
As with a driver, under CUPS one needs a PPD for the printer.
But it isn't executable code that can make your system unstable.
Perhaps better compared with a configuration file, essentially
it just contains plain-text data that informs the print system (CUPS)
what capabilities the printer has and how to format data accordingly.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, each machine that is to send print jobs to the printer
has to have the correct PPD, as is the case with a driver:
the machine initiating printing has to send something to the printer
that it can understand.
</p>

<p>
By following the above steps, it took me less than 15 minutes to enable a
notebook under SuSE 8.0 to print via the network printer.
And that includes the time it took to remove lprng and install CUPS
from the distribution CD!
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that this ignores about 99.99% of CUPS and is totally
insecure.
Anyone with access to your network could start print jobs
wasting toner until the paper runs out.
</p>

<p>
But for a simple home system behind a firewall, it will enable your network
printer under CUPS and buy you the time to learn all the things we've ignored
for the moment.
