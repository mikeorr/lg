I'm familiar with moving a portion of a UNIX file system that doesn't
need to be resident at all times to a larger partition.  What's the
safest way to do this for a portion of the file system (<TT>/usr</TT> ?) that
needs to be resident at all times?
</STRONG></P>

Thanks for your help,

The "resident" is not a "term of art" for Unix systems
administration.  Also <TT>/usr</TT> doesn't have to be <EM>mounted</EM>
at <EM>all</EM> times.  In particular you should be able to
bring the system up in single user mode and peform most
maintenance operations without <TT>/usr</TT> being mounted.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
That's why we have a <TT>/sbin</TT> directory.  Originally we had
<TT>/bin</TT>, which was intended to contain just those files that
were necessary to bring the rest of the system online.
However, as UNIX systems developed shared libraries a number
of the items which were traditionally located in <TT>/bin</TT> (such
as sh --- the shell) came to depend on <TT>/usr/lib</TT> which was the
traditional location of the .so (shared object) files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So some vendors started creating a <TT>/sbin</TT> ('<tt>s</tt>' for
"statically linked" --- which theoretically allows one
to replace <TT>/bin</TT> with a symlink or use it as a mount point
for its own filesystem.  Of course most Linux distributions
don't put <EM>statically linked</EM> binaries in <TT>/sbin</TT> --- we've
moved many of the shared libraries into <TT>/lib</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Personally I think the whole arrangement is a bit ugly.
The idea of having duplicate but statically linked versions
of many commands in <TT>/sbin</TT> is feasible.  Having <TT>/bin</TT>
contain a set of symlinks to the <TT>/sbin</TT> command is fine
(since they will work while nothing is mounted over <TT>/bin</TT>
and the mount of any other filesystem over <TT>/bin</TT> will then
make those symlinks "disappear").  I don't like this
insistence on dynamically linked <EM>everything</EM> since that
means that you can't even run ldconfig to fix the
<TT>/etc/ld.so.cache</TT> file if it gets corrupted.  You have to
boot from a floppy to get anything done.

In any event: let's look at a typical Linux root directory

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is from a fairly new <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> 
2.1 installation.  Here's the same list with some commentary:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><dl>
<dt>bin
	<dd>contains many common commands.  Should be able
	to put this on a mounted fs.  Ironically the mount
	command is in this directory and is dynamically linked!
	That's just WRONG.  (And I don't care what the FHS
	says about it).
<dt>boot
	<dd>contains kernels and associates System.map files
	and backups of the boot sector, as created by
	<TT>/sbin/lilo</TT>.  Oddly enough this can be a mounted
	filesystem.  As I've described many times, Linux
	doesn't require that its kernel be located on its
	root filesystem.  The System.map file isn't
	needed during the boot cycle (and isn't "needed"
	by much of anything --- '<tt>lsof</tt>' seems to complain
	if I don't have one or if it's mismatched to my
	kernel version but that's about it).
<dt>dev
	<dd>contains device nodes.  MUST be on root fs.
	(Richard Gooch has written a special devfs ---
	sort of like <TT>/proc</TT> for device nodes.  That would
	allow this to be a mounted filesystem)
<dt>etc
	<dd>contains passwd, group files, startup scripts and the
	mtab (which tracks all of the mounted filesystems).
<dt>floppy
	<dd>this is stupid.  It's just a mount point.  I prefer
	to put most of my mount points under <TT>/mnt</TT> --- so I have
	a <TT>/mnt/cdrom</TT>, a <TT>/mnt/floppy</TT>, <TT>/mnt/a</TT> 
	(DOS floppy), and others.
<dt>home
	<dd>This should be either a mount point or a symlink to
	some directory on a mounted fs.  I sometimes use -&gt;
	<TT>/usr/local/home</TT> if I have a small number of filesystems
	to work with.
<dt>initrd
	<dd>I'd have put this under <TT>/boot</TT>.  Anyway, mine is empty.
	This is intended to remount any "initial RAM disk" that
	was used.  (I might do a kernel patch to move this)
	When a kernel has initrd support enabled (compiled in)
	then a compressed image of the initrd filesystem is
	appended to the kernel.  The kernel then automatically
	creates the RAM disk, decompresses and copies the image
	into it, and runs the <TT>/linuxrc</TT> program that it should
	find there. (See <TT>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/initrd.txt</TT>
	for details).  This doesn't have to be here if you don't
	want/need access to the initrd after boot.
<dt>lib
	<dd>This <EM>MUST</EM> be on <TT>/</TT>; it contains your 
	<tt>libc.so</tt> and other shared libraries on which almost ALL 
	programs on your system depend.
<dt>lost+found
	<dd>This must be at the top of every filesystem.
	fsck will link any "lost clusters" into nodes under
	this directory; giving you an opportunity to fix them.
	Indeed, you should probably have a script that
	periodically checks this and warns the sysadmin any time
	any of these directories are non-empty.
<dt>mnt
	<dd>This is conventionally used as a mount point or as a
	directory containing a list of mount points.  It's where
	you mount "temporary" and "removable" filesystems.
<dt>opt
	<dd>This is a place to store large "optional" packages
	like WordPerfect, StarOffice, etc.  I usually make
	this a symlink to <TT>/usr/local/opt</TT>
<dt>proc
	<dd>This is a "virtual filesystem"  a representation of the
	system's process state as a set of file nodes.  The BSD
	systems that implement the proc filesystem typically do
	so much different than Linux.  Under Linux you can read
	much more info from <TT>/proc</TT> entries, and more of it is
	represented a plain text.  The idea of <TT>/proc</TT> is that we
	can have the kernel provide a filesystem/directory
	abstraction of its state and we can write programs like
	'<tt>ps</tt>' and '<tt>top</tt>' to use normal UNIX file semantics to
	read that information.  Linux is unique in that you can
	also modify many proc entries to changed the system
	state.  The most common case of this is to enable kernel
	routing using '<tt>echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</TT>'
<dt>root
	<dd>this is the root user's home directory.  Handy if you
	have any scripts or data/configuration files that you want
	to access during boot or single-user mode when <TT>/home</TT> will
	not be mounted.
<dt>sbin
	<dd>as I've noted, this should contain statically linked
	versions of the files that you absolutely need to fix a
	broken system.  Linux, like Solaris and other modern
	versions of UNIX has gone to the dark side of practically
	requiring shared libraries for EVERYTHING.  While shared
	libraries are very useful for conversing disk space and
	memory and offer huge performance benefits --- they are
	just one extra thing to break (for robustness and security).
	So a decent compromise is to have a subset of statically
	linked programs for use when everything is broken.
	(Having a kernel module or patch that could automatically
	detect and repair a corrupt <TT>/etc/ld.so.cache</TT> file would
	be a pretty good idea, too).
<dt>tmp
	<dd>this can be a mounted filesystem or a symlink to a
	directory on one.
<dt>usr
	<dd>this normally <EM>should</EM> be a mounted filesystem
<dt>var <dd>this can be mounted or a symlink.
</dl></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course the preceding is all must my opinion.  The
most authoritative commentary on what Linux filesystems
should look like is the FHS --- the Linux Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard (co-ordinated by Dan Quinlan), homepage
