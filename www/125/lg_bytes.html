<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Fedora Core 5 is OUT!</h3>

<p> And worth the wait with loads of new features including: new desktop 
applications, advances in security, better localization tools, improved software 
installation and management facilities, and strong Java integration help. 
</p>

<p> "Bordeaux" boasts GNOME 2.14 [the latest], KDE 3.5.1, OpenOffice 2.0.2, 
Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.1, and Xen Virtualization. GCC improvements offer 
increased stack protection.
</p>

<p> Here's a screen movie showing off the desktop.... 
<a href="http://linclips.crocusplains.com/index.php?page=clip&amp;id=30">http://linclips.crocusplains.com/index.php?page=clip&amp;id=30</a>
</p>

<p> By the way, only CD1 and CD2 are required for the default installation, so 
just download those if your connection to a mirror is running slow.
</p>

<p> Fedora Core 5 contains a preview of forthcoming Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
virtualization technology. In the summer of 2006, Red Hat plans to make 
Virtualization Migration and Assessment Services available along with an 
Enterprise Virtualization beta. Red Hat Enterprise Linux v.5, scheduled for 
general availability by the end of 2006, will feature fully-integrated 
virtualization. These plans were announced in a March presentation which included 
participation by XenSource, AMD, Intel, and Network Appliances.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SpikeSource and Novell Certify Open Source Solutions on SUSE</h3>
<p> SpikeSource, a provider of certified and business-ready Open Source software, 
announced that as part of its participation in the Novell Market Start Program, 
it is 'YES'-certifying its infrastructure stacks and will provide Spike&trade;
Certification for Open Source solutions running on the Spike Stack and SuSE 
Linux. Spike Certification includes interoperability testing of Open Source 
infrastructure and applications running on SUSE Linux through its automated test 
harness. Through this combined certification program, customers will be able to 
safely bring a wide variety of Open Source solutions into their production 
environments.
</p>

<p> "SpikeSource is an important part of the Novell strategy to deliver safe, 
smart Open Source and Linux solutions to customers of all sizes," said John 
Beuchert, Global Director of Open Source Marketing Programs at Novell. "They 
have automated a critical area of Open Source software management - the testing 
of many combinations of software to ensure they work together as promised and 
deliver significant value."
</p>

<p> SpikeSource will partner with Novell to ensure that recommended applications 
have been rigorously tested and are ready to be deployed into production 
environments. EnterpriseDB has also recently joined in the Novell Market Start 
Program.
</p>

<p> The Novell 'YES' certification program ensures compatibility with SUSE Linux. 
SpikeSource is extending that by incorporating Novell's stringent 'YES' 
certification requirements into the SpikeSource testing and certification 
process. Novell-compatible applications will be tested for compatibility on an 
ongoing basis, and SUSE interoperability issues will be identified and resolved 
before they create issues for customers. This will be done under the umbrella of 
the Spike Certified Solution program (more information at 
<a href="http://www.spikesource.com/partner/spikecertif.html">http://www.spikesource.com/partner/spikecertif.html</a>).

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">BEA to Open Source KODO</h3> 

<p> BEA is preparing to Open Source most of the technology it acquired in its 
purchase of SolarMetric in late 2005. 
</p>

<p> As part of its larger effort to 'blend' OSSw and its own technologies
in a 2-way process, BEA will donate much of Kodo's source code to start an
Open Source project named Open JPA [Java Persistance API]. The goal is to
provide an Open Source persistance framework.
</p>

<p> Open JPA will include a significant portion of the Kodo code base, 
specifically the Kodo kernel and the technical preview of the EJB 3 Persistence 
specification. Once the EJB 3 specification is approved [by the Java Community 
Process], Open JPA will be an Open Source implementation of the EJB 3 
Persistence standard available under an Apache software license. Java developers 
will have a free, Apache-licensed implementation of the EJB 3 Persistence 
specification.
</p>

<p> BEA has been barnstorming around the US in its recent Dev2Dev developer 
workshops, explaining its support of OSSw frameworks like Spring, Hibernate and, 
eventually, JDO [and these sessions are worth taking in]. Although company 
representatives say the amount of SolarMetric code to be released supporting 
Open JPA is still to be decided, this link to an interview with SolarMetric 
co-founder Neelan Choksi in February suggests significant parts of JDO code will 
remain proprietary.

<p> An early access of Kodo 4 can be downloaded from the Dev2Dev Persistence 
Technology Center [<a href="http://www.solarmetric.com/Software/beta/4.0.0EA/">http://www.solarmetric.com/Software/beta/4.0.0EA/</a>]

<h3> <img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sparc hardware and software now Open Source</h3> 

<p> At the Santa Clara, Calif., Multi-Core Expo in March, Sun Microsystems 
released both the hardware design point and the Solaris 10 Operating System (OS) 
porting specifications for the new multi-core UltraSPARC T1 processor, formerly 
called Niagara. With this release, developers gain access to the chip 
multi-threading (CMT) technology unique to the UltraSPARC T1 processor under the 
GNU GPL. This new Open Source version of the UltraSPARC T1 design will be called 
"OpenSPARC T1" and is a 64 bit, 32 threaded processor design - available at no 
charge.
</p>

<p> Sun released the Verilog source code, a verification suite and simulation 
models, the Sparc architecture spec, and Solaris 10 OS simulation images.
</p>

<p> This follows Sun's recent move to release its Hypervisor API specifications 
-- which allow companies to port Linux, BSD and other operating systems to the 
UltraSPARC T1 platform [should they wish] -- and allows developers to create 
hardware, software, tools and applications for the Sparc multi-threading 
eco-system. This is a first in that such a complex hardware design has been 
released under the GNU GPL.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intel gets cooler... and faster</h3>
<p>[see: <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/tradeshows/showdoc.aspx?i=2713">http://www.anandtech.com/tradeshows/showdoc.aspx?i=2713</a> ]
<br>
<p>[updated: <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/tradeshows/showdoc.aspx?i=2716&amp;p=4">http://www.anandtech.com/tradeshows/showdoc.aspx?i=2716&amp;p=4</a>]</p>
 
<p> Back in early March, Anand Tech published an early evaluation of the 
unreleased Intel Conroe dual-CPU chip. They took equal systems, one with a stock 
Athlon 64 FX-60 overclocked at 2.8 GHz, and compared it to similar hardware 
using a sample Intel dual-core Conroe E6700 2.66 GHz processor, The gaming and 
media benchmarks show a 20-30% perf edge going to Intel. [My, how the tables 
have turned!]
</p>

<p> This type of performance may go a long way toward explaining why Apple
chose to roll out its new line on Intel Dual Cores rather than AMD.
Although there have been <a
href="http://www.macspeedzone.com/html/hardware/machine/performance_in_the_raw/06/1_23.shtml">performance
complaints</a> from the Apple faithful on the new iMacs and MacBooks, the
numbers coming from AnandTech provide evidence that Intel will match and
surpass the AMD architecture. Of course, Intel did have a few years to plan
its comeback and sort out a new CPU and memory architecture. And its older
Pentium Netburst microarchitecture had been heating computer desks and the
knees of laptop owners for several years now, so its promises to provide a
real alternative to high wattage have been finally fulfilled. 
</p>

<p> Following AMD's example, Intel has put data throughput on the performance 
throne, not clockrate. And it seems there will be real competition for the CPU 
and chip set crown. And that's good for all of us.
</p>

<p> Here's a link to Anand Tech's review of Intel's roadmap presentation at IDF: 
<a href="http://www.anandtech.com/tradeshows/showdoc.aspx?i=2711">http://www.anandtech.com/tradeshows/showdoc.aspx?i=2711</a>
</p>

<p> Both AMD and Intel have announced that they would have quad-core processors 
in 2007 [That's doubling the doubling....]

<p> <b>Web Ops Summit</b>
</p>

<dl>Look in any modern data center or a mission-critial NOC and you'll find a new 
breed of operations specialist that's both web-savvy and network-fluent. Someone 
who's as at home with URLs and applications as they are with packets and  
throughput. They're part of a vital new IT discipline -- web operations -- 
and you may already be one of them. WebOps deals with the performance, 
availability, scalability, and security of web-based applications. It spans both 
big, public Internet sites and the internal, web-based intranet. And it looks at 
the application lifecycle, from design and deployment to monitoring, repairing, 
and reporting. The WebOps Summit brings together technology leaders and hands-on 
web experts for a half-day of updates and thought-provoking discussion. It's 
free to web operations personnel. If you're responsible for running 
production-grade web applications in B2B, B2C, or enterprise environments, you 
can't afford to miss this.

<p> We were told by MEPIS founder Warren Woodford that a test release of 
SimplyMEPIS 6.0, incorporating software from the Ubuntu Dapper package pools, is 
now available. This marks a break from the Debian Core group which was announced 
at LinuxWorld - SF last summer.
</p>

<p> Ubuntu has a 6 month stable release cycle that will enable MEPIS to offer its 
customers a dependable release schedule. Woodford stated "The switch to the 
Ubuntu pools was made to provide our users with a more stable underlying 
system." 
</p>

<p> "This release is a sneak peek, if you will. There are integration issues and 
new features that have not yet been addressed for SimplyMEPIS 6.0 and the Dapper 
pools are still being improved. However, we want to make it available to our 
subscribers now, so we can get their feedback before proceeding any 
further."
</p>

<p> Woodford also said, "MEPIS is no longer involved with the DCC due to 
'creative differences.' We wish Progeny, Xandros, and Linspire the best of luck 
in their mutual endeavors." 
</p>

<p> The DCC Alliance had been controversial within the Debian community.

<p> Aviram Jenik, Beyond Security CEO. says, "Security certifications are 
becoming a requirement of vendors by many companies. This is because too many 
products have been deployed that are vulnerable to attacks and too much money 
has been spent on fixing the problem after the fact."
</p>

<p> beSTORM arms developers, quality assurance teams and security professionals 
with a tool to test for security holes while still in the development phase. 
Unlike the current assessment tools, beSTORM doesnt look for specific attack 
signatures or attempt to locate known vulnerabilities and it does not require 
the source code (like source-code audit tools). Rather, beSTORM focuses on 
network-enabled applications and models the protocols used to communicate with 
them. beSTORM exercises the protocol with technically legal but functionally 
erroneous cases. beSTORM then performs exhaustive protocol analysis in order to 
uncover new and unknown vulnerabilities in network products. As an example, 
beSTORM automatically tries every protocol combination possible until a buffer 
overflow is triggered. It can generate over 2,000 different attack combinations 
per second on a single CPU server. 
</p>

<p> "Fuzzing tools are probably the closest in comparison to beSTORM. Fuzzing 
tools take an existing network protocol and 'fuzz' it, which means it sends 
malformed requests and analyzes the results," said Jenik. "Fuzzers are usually 
limited in bandwidth trying hundreds or millions of different attack 
combinations where beSTORM can try billions." 
</p>

<p> beSTORM runs on Windows, UNIX and Linux. 
</p>

<p> Beyond Security provides network security solutions including their Automated 
Scanning product for penetration testing. Beyond Security is also the founder 
and operator of <a href="http://www.securiteam.com">www.securiteam.com</a>, an independent security portal.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">U.S. Navy Awards iRobot Additional $26 Million for Robots</h3>

<p> iRobot will deliver an additional 213 iRobot PackBot(R) Man Transportable 
Robotic Systems (MTRS), plus spare parts to repair robots in the field. The new 
award of $26 million marks the third round of funding by the Naval Sea Systems 
Command (NAVSEA), bringing the total value of the orders placed to date to more 
than $43 million.
</p>

<p> The PackBot MTRS robots are customized for NAVSEA and are based on iRobot's 
combat-proven PackBot Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) robots. PackBot MTRS 
robots are equipped with advanced tools and sensors that enable EOD technicians 
to identify and disrupt bombs from a safe distance. The U.S. military's 
dual-sourced MTRS program has requirements for up to 1200 robots through 
2012.
</p>

<p> These PackBot MTRS robots will be deployed in Iraq and elsewhere. Currently 
more than 300 PackBot robots are deployed worldwide where they are used 
extensively to disarm IEDs.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif"> An Army of Cyborg Bugs?</h3>

<p> The U.S. Department of Defense is considering fielding an army of 
remote-controlled insect-cyborg scouts.
</p>

<p> The Hybrid Insect Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (HI-MEMS) program is the 
responsibility of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which 
is soliciting research proposals on the technology.
</p>

<p> The insects would be outfitted with sensors and a wireless transmitter 
designed to enable them to send data on conditions in places inaccessible to 
human troops. The goal of the program is to produce a sensor-enabled insect with 
a 100-yard range that could be placed within five meters of a target using 
electronic remote control and, potentially, Global Positioning System (GPS) 
technologies.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif"> Oracle loses database exec to Open Source</h3>

<p> 
<dl>Senior developer switches sides
<dd>from Tom Sanders in California, vnunet.com 20 Mar 2006</dl>
<p> Ingres Corporation has hired Bill Maimone as its chief architect. A 20-year 
veteran of the database industry, Maimone previously worked for Oracle as part 
of a small team steering the development of the vendor's technology stack.
</p>

<p> Ingres was created last year when Computer Associates spun off its Ingres 
database. The company currently has about 180 employees.
</p>

<p> In a game of corporate tease, the announcement was timed to coincide with 
Oracle's earnings release.
</p>

<p> While Ingres is not positioned to compete head-on with Oracle, the company 
expects to gain business from disgruntled customers and partners, Ingres' chief 
technology officer Dave Dargo told vnunet.com in an interview.

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Hard Disk Drive Organization goes to new lengths... and standards</h3>
 

<p> IDEMA, the International Disk Drive, Equipment, and Materials Association, has released a 
new and longer sector standard for future magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs). An IDEMA committee recommended 
replacing the 30 year-standard of 512 bytes with 4096 byte sectors.
</p>

<p> "Increasing areal density of newer magnetic hard disk drives requires a more 
robust error correction code (ECC), and this can be more efficiently applied to 
4096 byte sector lengths," explained Dr. Martin Hassner from Hitachi GST and 
IDEMA Committee member. It will also help lower storage costs.
</p>

<p> The IDEMA Long Data Block Committee was composed of members representing the 
major hard drive developers, as well as electronics and software companies. 
Microsoft participated in this Committee and plans to include a 4K-byte sector 
capability in their upcoming Windows Vista operating system. 
</p>

<p>
IDEMA foresees the first hard drive products becoming available later this year 
or in 2007.

<p> They interviewed the former CIO of the great state of Massachusetts,
Peter Quinn, regarding his stand on the OpenDocument debacle. He states
that the "sandal and ponytail set" may be inhibiting the adaption of Linux.
He also notes the pressure to conform in goverment agency IT departments
and the significant marketing efforts of the enemies of Open Source. "Open
source has an unprofessional appearance, and the community needs to be more
business-savvy in order to start to make inroads..."
