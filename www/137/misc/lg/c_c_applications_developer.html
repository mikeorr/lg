<p>You're either a bot, or have a poor idea as to the direction LG

Cool.
<pre>
&gt; Required Skills (Must have these skills) 
&gt; 
&gt; o Mid-level developer 
</pre>
<p>Are we talking height here, or being portly?</p>
<pre>
&gt; o An Experienced developer that has developed using C/C++ in an in UNIX environment. 
</pre>
<p>How many years is that? "Experienced" could mean six months for
all I care.</p>
<pre>
&gt; o Perl and/or ksh scripting Plus skills, not absolutely 
&gt; necessary: 
</pre>
<p>Heh.</p>
<pre>
&gt; o HTML, CGI and Web Development experience 
&gt; o Perl experience. 
</pre>
<p>How does this "Perl experience" differ from what was mentioned
above? And how is it you think Ksh and Perl skills are somehow
grouped together? What you shoud be asking for is Perl and/or shell
skills, since specifying ksh alone is non-sensical given other
shells.</p>
<pre>
&gt; o Oracle Pro-C or similar database background 
&gt; o Perl DBI 
</pre>
<p>I meet these requirements.</p>

<p>How can you possibly stupulate C++ above without any C
skills?</p>
<p>Also, what makes you think your email is welcome here?</p>

<p>Seconding Thomas's comments, and speaking as the Linux Gazette
mailing list administrator: As long as you remove tag at
lists.linuxgazette.net from your set of e-mail addresses to use,
and never send us anything like that, ever again, your intrusion is
forgiven.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if I <em>ever</em> see an even vaguely
similar e-mail again, from your company, even once, your entire
firm will be null-routed permanently, on the spot.</p>
<p>If you're unclear on what that means, please ask your network
admin. However, the short form is: you won't like it much.</p>

&gt; line. Include complete address and/or domain/aliases to be removed.
</pre>
<p>By the way, the above is conclusively fraudulent, and will get
your firm automatically classified as a criminal enterprise in most
places.</p>
