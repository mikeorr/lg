<H1><font color="maroon">How I got my Adaptec AVA 1502 SCSI card to work with Linux and SANE</font></H1>
<H4>By <a href="mailto:jrogers@u.washington.edu">James M. Rogers</a></H4>
</center>
<P> <HR> <P>  

<P>I have a Microtek ScanMaker E3 that I have ran under windows for a few
years to allow me to convert from hard copy to digital.&nbsp; I have never
been satisfied with the performance of this scanner under windows because
I was so limited in the size of the images that I could process.&nbsp;
I won't bore you with the details, suffice it to say that it was slow,
tedious and the results were only adequate.

<P>I have heard about Scanner Access Now Easy (SANE) for a few years.&nbsp;
It is a project to implement a consistent scanner interface across all
scanners, digital cameras, and other items.&nbsp; It only works with SCSI
scanners at this time.

<P>It took me three tries to get the program to work for me.

<P>Try one:

<P>The SCSI driver card that came with my scanner claimed to be an AVA-1502E.&nbsp;
I couldn't find a driver to work with this under Linux.

<P>Try two:

<P>I thought that this card is an Adaptec card so I tried to load the Adaptec
modules, concentrating on the aha152x.o&nbsp; The most I got was the insmod
program seeming to lock up.&nbsp; At no point in this process did it recognize
my card.

<P>Try three:

<P>I peeled the sticker off of the main chip and saw that it was an 6360
chip (Doing this probably voids the warranty.)&nbsp; So I dug into the
Linux source code. In <TT>/usr/src/linux-2.0.32/drivers/scsi/</TT>&nbsp;
there is a file called <TT>aha152x.c</TT>.&nbsp; I read this file several
times and got a general picture of how this file worked.&nbsp; I then modified
the file <TT>/usr/src/linux-2.0.32/drivers/scsi/Makefile</TT> and commented
out the line following line:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHA152X = -DDEBUG_AHA152X -DAUTOCONF</TT>

<P>turns to:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #AHA152X = -DDEBUG_AHA152X -DAUTOCONF</TT>

<P>I then added this line right below the commented line:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AHA152X = -DDEBUG_AHA152X -DSKIP_BIOSTEST -DSETUP0="{
0x140, 11, 7, 0, 0, 0, 100, 0 }"</TT>

<P>Basically we are telling the module to stop trying to autoconfigure
the card, don't try to see which card it is and to use the given settings.&nbsp;
<I>I will contact the maintainers of this code and work with them on getting
this driver to autorecognize this card, if possible.</I>

<P>The first two numbers are the ones that you care about.&nbsp; These
numbers correspond to the the jumpers on the card.&nbsp; The first number
is 0x140 if the jumper is on the card , or 0x340 if the jumper is removed.&nbsp;
The 11 corresponded to the irq setting on my card.&nbsp; This number can
be 9, 10, 11 or 12 depending on how the jumper was set.

<P>If you want to know more about these other settings look in the source
code and

<P>I then changed to <TT>/usr/src/linux-2.0.32/</TT>&nbsp; put a floppy
disk in the drive and did a

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make dep ; make clean ; make zdisk</TT>

<P>Once the disk had been made I put the disk in my Linux box with the
scanner attached and rebooted.&nbsp; It came up and saw my card and told
me that the card was device /dev/sga.&nbsp; When I looked in /dev/ for
a device called sga I couldn't find one.&nbsp; So I made a link from <TT>/dev/scanner</TT>
to <TT>/dev/sg0</TT> instead with the following command:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /dev</TT>
<BR><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ln -s sg0 scanner</TT>

<P>I then configured my <TT>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</TT> to look like this:

<P><TT># enable the next line if you want to allow access through the network:</TT>
<BR><TT>#net</TT>
<BR><TT>microtek</TT>
<BR><TT>pnm</TT>

<P>I configured my <TT>/etc/sane.d/microtek.conf</TT> to look like this:

<P><TT>#Uncomment the following if you are tired of seeing the dump of
the</TT>
<BR><TT># scanner INQUIRY every time the backend starts up...</TT>
<BR><TT>nodump</TT>
<BR><TT>/dev/scanner</TT>

<P>Then I ran the following command and it worked!!!:

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scanimage --help -d microtek</TT>

<P>This tells you the other commands that will work with the scanner.

<P>I then scanned in stuff with the command line command and with <TT>xscanner</TT><TT></TT>

<P><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scanimage -dmicrotek -x214 -y296 --resolution
97 > test.pnm</TT>

<P>The above command is a full scan of the entire page at 200dpi. The output
of these programs is pnm format which allows you access to hundreds of
filters to process and convert your output to the exact format that you
desire.&nbsp; See the <TT>man pnm</TT> page for more details.

<P>I have already done some 11MB graphics files and used some pnm utilities
to filter them, edited them with gimp, cut out the area that I wanted and
saved them as jpg's.&nbsp; The neat thing is that I am testing out SANE
by running it on a machine with only 16MB of memory and no swap.&nbsp;
(I am processing the files on a different, faster machine) So far SANE
has only failed on full screen images above 200dpi which is not bad.&nbsp;
Once I have a baseline I will put this machine to 32MB RAM and 32MB swap
space.

<P>I love the ability of Linux to get in there and let me really control
my hardware configuration.&nbsp; With Microsoft the only option that I
would have had would have been to buy a "compatible" product and install
one of the manufactures full featured (bloated), buggy driver programs.&nbsp;
The support tech would have probably sneered at me as he said this.&nbsp;
This is the first time that I have "dug into" the kernel driver code, researched
a problem and found a solution.&nbsp; Just the satisfaction of being able
to fix the kernel to recognize the hardware that I have already paid for
is very rewarding.

<P>Next month I will talk about getting the networking portion of SANE
up and running.
