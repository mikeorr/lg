<h1>A Nightmare on Tape Drive</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>


<p>
And in the fourth month of my new job, I encountered numerous problems
all related to backup.
</p>

<p>
Backup! My eyes glaze over. I suppose some people can get enthusiastic
about backup, but not me. Oh, sure, I understand the point of backup.
And I try very hard in my own endeavours to keep lots of backup. (What
would happen to my writing if I lost it all! Oh, the horror.)
</p>

<p>
Currently, I seem to spend about a third of my time on backup. There
are many aspects to this, and several reasons. Nonetheless, there are
many activities that are not a particularly good match for my
skill-set: operating a Dymo labelmaker; searching for tapes; opening
new tape boxes; removing shrink-wrapping; loading and unloading
magazines; searching for tape cases; loading tape cases; removing
tapes from their covers; inserting tapes into their covers; delivering
tape cases to, and retrieving them from, a nearby site.
</p>

<p>
I yearn to throw the whole lot out and start again. But, of course,
that is unthinkable.
</p>

<p>
We have 3 jukeboxes which feed 5 tape drives. About a month ago, the
PX502 started to misbehave. I started scouring documentation,
searching around in the logs and trying various commands. Somewhere I
came across this helpful message:
</p>


<pre>
	The drive is not ready - it requires an initialization command
</pre>

<p>
Oh, really? Well, if you are so smart, send the appropriate
initialization command. Or tell me what the initialization command
looks like and ask me to issue it.
</p>

<p>
Don't you just hate that? It's on a par with those stupid messages
that compilers sometimes produce, something like:
</p>

<pre>
	Fatal error: extraneous comma
</pre>

<p>
!! I mean, I wouldn't mind,
</p>

<pre>
	Warning: extraneous comma. Ignored.
</pre>

<p>
But "<tt>Fatal error</tt>"?! Give me a break. That's just punitive.
</p>

<p>
It seemed to me that the aberrant behaviour was hardware-related. I
chased around to see if the unit was under maintenance. There was some
difficulty in locating the relevant paperwork, but I was given a phone
number and assured it would be OK. It wasn't really OK, but David came
out nonetheless and poked around.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those visits like when you take your car to the
mechanic - or your kids to their friends. The car and the kids are
suddenly on their best behaviour. The mechanic cannot hear any of
those ominous noises that caused so much consternation. And the other
parents report what sweet children you have.
</p>

<p>
As you drive away in frustration, the car starts its strange noises
and the kids are attempting to kill each other in the back seat.
</p>

<p>
Two days later I was back on the phone to David. He assured me that
our support was not with him but with some other crowd, but since he
had started down this path, he would continue and work out some
cross-charging with the other crowd. He told me to run some program
and send him the output.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, he sent the output on to the US and was informed that one
of the drives needed replacement. They shipped a replacement drive to
David, who came out again a few days later.
</p> 

<p>
And that should have been the end of it.
</p>

<p>
But no. This is the story of a nightmare; don't look for happy
endings. The happiest part of a nightmare is when you wake up.
</p>

<p>
The software which coordinates all the backup tasks is Sun's
StorageTek EBS which is really  Legato NetWorker under the covers.
After the drive swapout, the StorageTek software showed only a single
drive on the PX502.
</p>

<p>
I struggled with this for a while, believing it ought to be fairly
straightforward to solve this problem. And this is where I demonstrate
why I earn the big bucks. <img src='smile.png' alt=":-)" />
</p>

<p>
When you encounter a problem like this you have the analogue of the
manufacturer's make/buy dilemma. Do you try to fix it yourself? Or do
you call in support? Before you can think about calling for support
you have to answer a few questions.
</p>

<p>
First, have you investigated the problem? If your opening gambit is,
"It doesn't work," you may find it hard to get useful help. Support
may suggest politely that you try reading the manual.
</p>

<p>
Second, is the problem hardware or software? In many cases, my answer
is that if I knew that I wouldn't be calling for support.
Nevertheless, you need to be able to engage support, get them
interested enough to want to help you. Otherwise, they'll just give
you a lot of dopey menial tasks.
</p>

<p>
Finally, do you even have support?
</p>

<p>
First, I tried the Microsoft approach: if things don't work, try
restarting them; or power cycling. I'm not proud to take this route,
but I figure support is going to suggest it, so I may as well clear
the decks. Unsurprisingly, nothing was gained.
</p>

<p>
I started trying to break things down. Does the machine see the
hardware?
</p>

<p>
Before the problems, the PX502 controlled 2 tape drives:
</p>

<pre>
	/dev/rmt/0cbn
	/dev/rmt/1cbn
</pre>

<p>
The first of these was the faulty one. When it was swapped out, the
new tape drive came up as /dev/rmt/2cbn. I don't understand why. As I
write this, it occurs to me that another approach to this problem may
have been to persuade Solaris at the lowest level that this tape drive
was /dev/rmt/0cbn.
</p>

<p>
I also thought it might not be a bad idea to reboot the Sun to which
the tape drive is attached, but this is the organisation's file
server; rebooting it is not a task to be taken lightly. Fortuitously,
it rebooted itself one night when one of its SAN disks had a hiccup.
Even the reboot did not improve matters.
</p>

<p>
I was able to go to the front panel of the PX502, press some buttons
and load a tape into the "invisible" drive. So, at least as far as the
PX502 is concerned, the tape drive is present.
</p>

<p>
I then went to the Sun to which the tape drive is attached and issued:
</p>

<pre>
	mt -f /dev/rmt/2cbn status
	Quantum DLT-S4 tape drive:
	   sense key(0x6)= Unit Attention   residual= 0   retries= 0
	   file no= 0   block no= 0
</pre>

<p>
That's promising. It looks like the Sun knows about the tape drive.
</p>

<p>
Since the tape was one of the backup tapes, it had a label. I don't
know exactly what a label looks like, but I expect it to be at the
beginning of the tape. I did:
</p>

<pre>
	dd if=/dev/rmt/2cbn ibs=1000000 count=1 | od -Cx | less
</pre>

<p>
This reads the first MB off the tape and pipes it into a dump format.
Lots of the dump were incomprehensible to me, but about 16 lines down
I found a string that corresponded to the label (tapeBSA.3472).
</p>

<pre>
0000360  \0  \0  \0  \f   t   a   p   e   B   S   A   .   3   4   7   2
</pre>

<p>
At the lowest level, the drive is present and works fine.
</p>

<p>
When David had come out, he had shown me how to connect to the PX502
web interface. From the web interface one can control the PX502 more
conveniently than from its front panel. I navigated from one screen to
another, satisfying myself that it could see two tape drives, could
move a tape from a magazine to a drive; and move it the other way as
well. So it seemed fair to conclude that the PX502 was OK.
</p>

<p>
That left the interface between the PX502 and the Sun, or the
StorageTek software. The StorageTek software claimed it could see the
PX502 and one of the drives, so my money was on a problem with the
StorageTek software. Time to find out if we have support (we do) and
then get in touch with Sun.
</p>

<p>
After only a little bit of palaver over my inability to locate the
correct paperwork, Sun routed my call to someone who took down the
details. He was reasonably patient with my uncertainty as to whether
this was hardware or software. After some discussion, he agreed with
my view that it was probably the StorageTek software that merited
attention. I was given a Tracking Number.
</p>

<p>
I didn't expect anything much to happen right way, especially as I'd
called about 4:30 pm on a Friday. I began thinking about packing up
and going home, expecting that I'd pick up the matter on Monday, so I
was somewhat startled when the phone rang only a few minutes later.
</p>

<p>
"I'm ringing about your Sev 1."
</p>

<p>
<em>Sev 1?!</em> A Severity One error means something catastrophic like the
entire business has ground to a halt! I freaked. Typically, to get an
organisation like Sun to even allow you to call in a Sev 1, you have
to be paying big bikkies. Normally you get "best effort" or maybe
"response within one business day". Sev 1?! Maybe defence departments
get to call Sev Ones, not me.
</p>

<p>
I hastened to assure the caller that I had never mentioned that the
problem was critical. Far from it - I was in no great rush to get the
problem solved. He took this with good grace, and we agreed to leave
it until Monday.
</p>

<p>
I guess Sun runs some sort of tag-team problem-solving that follows
the, um, sun. On Monday morning, my inbox had a couple of emails with
the Tracking Number in the subject, which had arrived Friday after I
had left.
</p>

<p>
The first email seemed to be on the ball. It asked me to provide
details of the software I was using; the output of several
commands; and the contents of several logs. This approach suits me
well. I get to find out which instructions the experts use, so in the
future I can help myself.
</p> 

<p>
The second email came from the same sender. I'm guessing he's based in
India. He had tried to call me and wanted to confirm that the number
he had was correct. Since his email included a bit that went "... as I
did not get a response @ 61-3 ...", I concluded that he had tried to
make an international call. (I usually expect to see a plus (+) for
international access, but "61" is the country code for Australia and
"3" is my area code.) He also asked for a few more details.
</p>

<p>
I spent the rest of Monday fighting fires. It was Tuesday before I
could gather the various responses. I was still a bit antsy about the
Sev 1, so I prefaced my responses with:
</p>


<pre><em>
	I've said this before, but I'll repeat it just in case. The
	unit is usable (even though it seems to complain that it can't
	see the changer). We are doing backups with the one tape drive
	it can see. However, it had 2 tape drives and we want it to be
	able to use both tape drives.
</em></pre>

<p>
I included in my email a summary of the situation to date, pretty much
what I have written above.
</p> 

<p>
When it came to sending the logs, I had a bit of a problem. One of the
log files was 12 MB, the other 544 MB. It seems that these log files
are never rolled over. I sent the last part of the log file, containing 
entries for the last few months.
</p>

<p>
I had been asked to "kindly provide the screenshot that shows the
errors from console."
</p> 

<p>
I had two methods for monitoring the backup: a java GUI; and nsrwatch,
a curses-based application. The GUI proved unhelpful, but nsrwatch
displayed several messages.
</p>

<p>
The main error message was:
</p>

<pre>
	media warning: The /dev/rmt/0cbn is either skipped as
	requested (due to hardware problem) or no longer connected to
	the storage node.

	media warning: Please remove /dev/rmt/0cbn from NetWorker if
	it is permanently disconnected.
</pre>

<p>
Well, that's probably correct. The old drive was zero; for some reason
the new one is two. There was also an analogous message for the
changer. And yet, the software can drive the changer!
</p>

<p>
I wrote back:
</p>

<pre><em>
I've attached a screenshot, but there are no error messages as such.

Perhaps the following might be more useful:

# jbedit -j 'Quantum PX502' -a -f /dev/rmt/2cbn -E 81
Using 'unix33.alpha.wehi.edu.au' as NetWorker server host.
39078:jbedit: RAP error: The device '/dev/rmt/2cbn' is already part of jukebox 'Quantum PX502'.

# jbedit -j 'Quantum PX502' -d -f /dev/rmt/2cbn -E 81
Using 'unix33.alpha.wehi.edu.au' as NetWorker server host.
39077:jbedit: error, Cannot find device `/dev/rmt/2cbn' in jukebox `Quantum PX502'.
</em></pre>

<p>
I included this to underline the point that the software had become
very confused. I can't add the tape drive because it's already there.
But I can't delete it because it isn't there.
</p>

<p>
Late the next afternoon a reply came summarising their understanding
of the problem; then this:
</p>


<pre><em>
	Please Select the jukebox PX502 from GUI and do a scan for
	drives. I am sure this will show the missing drive into the
	configration.

	If this fails we need to delete this Jukebox and recreate it
	once again. It is suggested to do this when there is a
	downtime available.
</em></pre>

<p>
There was an interesting bit that followed. Here's a fragment of my
reply:
</p>

<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<em>--&gt;please let me know how did you get the element number "81". Kindly</em>
</p>

<p>
I honestly don't remember.
</p>

<p>
<em>--&gt;confirm the correct element number using the sjisn command.</em>
</p>

<pre>
        sjisn 3.7.0
Serial Number data for 3.7.0 (QUANTUM  PX500           ):
        Library:
                Serial Number: QP0714BDC00025
                SCSI-3 Device Identifiers:
                        ATNN=QUANTUM PX500           QP0714BDC00025
                        IENN=00E09EFFFF0B61FE
                        WWNN=100000E09E0B61FE
        Drive at element address 128:
                SCSI-3 Device Identifiers:
                        ATNN=QUANTUM DLT-S4          QP0713AMD00014 
        Drive at element address 129:
                SCSI-3 Device Identifiers:
                        ATNN=QUANTUM DLT-S4          QP0734AMD00102
</pre> 



<p>
I guess 81 (hex) = 129 (decimal).<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>

<p>
And here we have an encapsulation of some of the many ways that things
can go wrong. This is so easy in hindsight. I have a PhD in hindsight.
Rear vision is always 20/20.
</p>

<p>
Why <strong>had</strong> I used element number "81"? Because I am too
clever by half! In the man page for jbedit(1m), I had seen an example which
ended with "-E 82". When one is a Brilliant Expert, one gets a "feel" for
the "shape" of numbers. A number like 81 or 82 in the context of devices is
so obviously hexadecimal only a fool would imagine any other possibility.
(Would the fool typing please put his hand up?) When I saw "129" it was
obvious that I was meant to translate it to hex, so I did. Wrong!
</p>

<p>
Strangely, the support guys never corrected me. That's the next
lesson. I had spent much time trying to establish how to determine the
element number. I should never have responded the way I did.
</p>

<p>
I ought to know better. I have worked for many years in support. I am
reluctant to let my customers tell me what they think is wrong. I am
only interested in what they were trying to do, what they saw, and
what they expected or wanted to see. Very often, if I let them tell me
what they think is wrong, I get sucked in to their view of the
problem. Had that view been helpful, they would have solved the
problem already. They are coming to me for a fresh perspective.
</p>

<p>
In researching for this article, I came across this in the man page:
</p>

<pre>
	The data element address is the "decimal number" that the
	jukebox assigns to each of its drives.
</pre>

<p>
This underlines another valuable lesson. Most people, most of the
time, operate as if they subscribe to the theory "don't confuse me
with facts, my mind's made up". Of course, if you try to say that to
people out loud, they respond that it's ridiculous.
</p>

<p>
I may have read that part of the man page when I was trying to solve
the problem. But, if I did, I never connected "decimal number" with
the value associated with "-E". (I wonder why the man page has
"decimal number" in quotes.)
</p>

<p>
The next day I received another email suggesting that the GUI
"database is corrupted"; that I pkgrm (uninstall) the GUI part of the
software; delete the database components; and then pkgadd
((re)install) it. I'd seen a similar suggestion in posts on the Net.
</p>

<p>
Be careful what you wish for. And, once again, I justify my wage.
</p>

<p>
I am always reluctant to delete. Except in extremis, I always rename.
Or take a copy and then pkgrm. Fortunately, that's what I did.
</p>


<p>
And when he got there the cupboard was ...
</p>

<p>
... not exactly bare. However, when I had pkgrmed the software, I then
tried the pkgadd
</p>

<pre>
	pkgadd: ERROR: no packages were found in &lt;/var/spool/pkg&gt;
</pre>

<p>
<em>Oops.</em>
</p>

<p>
I started rooting around the file system. However, there were some
problems. I guess I should have said "more problems"; I seem to have
them in spades.
</p>

<p>
This is a Sun running Solaris 10. Unlike sensible systems (Linux,
FreeBSD), Sun does not offer "locate" by default. As I read somewhere,
if ever a system needed "locate", it's Solaris. Further, this system is
the file server: it serves over 20 TB. It's also extremely overloaded.
I'm not going to be popular if I start doing a find across 20TB; and
I'm not going to get an answer any time soon. So, although I know what
the package is called, I'm going to have a hard time finding it.
</p>

<p>
I eventually found the package and installed it. Um, not quite. I
installed 7.3 and we were running 7.4. So although I can use the GUI,
it doesn't have all the features which used to be present.
</p>

<p>
Some problems can be solved in one sitting. It should be clear that
this saga continued over the course of a month, maybe more.
Concurrently, I was doing other parts of my regular job, including the
limping backups. Every now and then I would find the time to mount
another assault on my problem du jour.
</p>

<p>
Time is a great healer in all sorts of activities. However, a balance
must be struck. If all you do is monomaniacally try to solve the
problem to the exclusion of other activities, firstly you will neglect
important duties; but more importantly, you may get too close to the
problem - you start going round in circles, stumbling blindly, getting
confused, making mistakes.
</p>

<p>
I reckon I've solved more tough problems on the drive/walk/tram/train
home, or in the shower, than I have at the keyboard.
</p>

<p>
One day, I tried a minor variation on an earlier command and had
success.
</p>

<pre>
	jbedit -j 'Quantum PX502' -a -f /dev/rmt/2cbn -E 129
</pre>

<p>
If you've persevered to here, you will recognise this as similar to a
command listed earlier, but now I'm using 129 instead of the alleged
hex 81.
</p>

<p>
Now 2 tape drives show up in the GUI. My original problem has been
solved.
</p>

<p>
If only I hadn't uninstalled the console software!
</p>

<p>
Where was I going to find the version we used to have?
</p>

<p>
When you read job ads, you'll often see specifications that the
prospective employer requires or desires. In my experience, these are
rarely relevant. Sure, you want someone with a computer background,
not a ballerina or a chef. You probably want someone with a Unix
background if you run a Unix shop.
</p>

<p>
But getting more detailed than that seems to me pointless. If your
looking for a mechanic, you want someone who has worked on cars, but
do you really need someone who has worked on 1975 Dodge Darts?
</p>

<p>
I'm looking for some software. Which part of my CV is going to
demonstrate my ability to find it? The question is not going to be
asked. But this is exactly the sort of real-world problem that must be
solved.
</p>

<p>
And that's my point. Most organisations are sufficiently idiosyncratic
that the way they do things contributes to the steepest part of the
learning curve. In-depth knowledge of a particular release of a
distribution, or a specific rev of some software package is only
transiently helpful.
</p>

<p>
The real requirement is to be able to get answers and solve problems;
to perform the necessary research.
</p>

<p>
Before this job, I had used Legato, but I had not been in charge of
the backup. I had no familiarity with managing the backup. But that
task has not been difficult to pick up. It's just like getting behind
the wheel of an unfamiliar car.
</p>

<p>
Finding where the software might be is a horse of a different colour.
</p>

<p>
I decided I needed a locate database. Not a genuine, complete,
standard locate database; but something simple and workable. I didn't
need to update it regularly, because I was only interested in files
which were already there. A df showed that the root directory and /var
were on separate filesystems. All the other filesystems, the 20TB,
were out of my area of interest. I went with
</p>

<pre>
	nice find / /var -mount &gt;&gt; ~/tmp/locate.output
</pre>

<p>
Now I can grep for what I need. It's not brilliant, but it will do.
</p>

<p>
It enabled me to find files which were helpful in other ways, but in
creating my little ersatz locate I managed to overlook /usr/local. A
colleague pointed me to an obscure subdirectory of /usr/local where I
found rev 7.4 of the Legato software.
</p>

<p>
It was close to what we'd had before, but even that wasn't the end of
the story. I found something dated later than the other candidates in
a patch directory. So once more I went through the cycle of uninstall
of the old version and reinstall of the new. But the latest item was
in a patch directory. It complained that it could only be installed
over an existing installation of the Legato software.
</p>

<p>
Patches have come to mean so many different things. When I was just
starting out in computers, a patch was an analogue of what I use to
repair my bike tubes. Typically it consisted of instructions to
overwrite the contents of a file at a small number of locations with
binary data; patching was done by hand. Over time, patching also came
to mean a form of automated editing of source code. And patching is
also used to describe the selective replacement of some files in a
package. In fact, in the Solaris world, patches are packaged in a very
similar way to software. There is not a lot of difference between
pkgadd and patchadd. My guess is that they share an awful lot of
codebase.
</p>

I have seen so-called jumbo patches from Sun which run to nearly a
gigabyte. From humble beginnings...
</p>

<p>
I reinstalled 7.4 and then installed the patch and finally I was back
to our original GUI console. Finally, after nearly a month, all the
problems had been resolved.
</p>

<p>
A day or two later, another jukebox, attached to another machine,
started to play up. As I write, it looks like I am looking at
repeating the exercise above. I hope that my experience will allow me
to get out the the other side with less drama.

<em>
<p>
Henry has spent his days working with computers, mostly for computer
 manufacturers or software developers. His early computer experience
 includes relics such as punch cards, paper tape and mag tape. It is
 his darkest secret that he has been paid to do the sorts of things he
 would have paid money to be allowed to do. Just don't tell any of his
 employers. 
</p>

<p>
He has used Linux as his personal home desktop since the family got its
 first PC in 1996. Back then, when the family shared the one PC, it was a
 dual-boot Windows/Slackware setup. Now that each member has his/her own
 computer, Henry somehow survives in a purely Linux world.
</p>

<p>
He lives in a suburb of Melbourne, Australia.
