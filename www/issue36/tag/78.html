Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I just have some questions about setting up linux to run as a
server for my home computer and to share an internet connection
and also to setup as a server for the internet.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"

O.K. That is three different roles:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><ol>
<li>Network Server (which services)
<li>Internet Gateway (proxy and/or masquerading)
<li>Internet Host/Server (which services)
</ol></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is possible for Linux to concurrently handle
all three roles --- though having all of your "eggs in
one basket" may be not be a good idea with regards to
security and risk assessment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Traditionally your concerns would also have encompassed the
capacity planning --- but a typical modern PC with 200+
Pentium processor, 32Mb to 256Mb of RAM and 4Gb to 12Gb if
disk space has quite a bit of capacity compared to the Unix
hosts of even 5 to 10 years ago.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

	>
Do you know if I can setup a linux box with one 10mbs ethernet for
a modem and a 100mbs ethernet for a network in my house?  Where do
I start and how would I do it.
</STRONG></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
I presume you're referring to a 10Mbps ethernet for a
cable modem, ISDN router (like the Trancell/WebRamp, or
the Ascend Pipeline series), or a DSL router.  These
usually provide 10Mbps interfaces and act as routers to
the cable, ISDN or xDSL services to which you're subscribed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's certainly possible for you to install two or three
ethernet cards into a Linux system.  Any decent modern
100Mbps ethernet card will also automatically handle
10Mbps if you plug them into such a LAN.  So you'd just
put two of these cards into your system, plug one into
your router and the other into your highspeed hub.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You often have to add the following line to your
<TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> to get kernel to recognize the second
ethernet card:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE> <CODE>
append="ether=0,0,eth1"
</CODE> </BLOCKQUOTE> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
... the <tt>0,0,</tt> is a hint to autoprobe for the IRQ and
I/O base address for this driver.  Alternatively you might
have to specify the particulars for your cards
with a line like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE> <CODE>
append="ether=10,0x300,eth0 ether=11,0x280,eth1"
</CODE> </BLOCKQUOTE> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
... instead.    This line must be present in each
of the Linux "stanzas" (groups of lines which refer to
different Linux kernels with their corresponding root
filesystem pointers and other settings).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course you must run the <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> command to read
any changes in your <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> file and "compile"
them into a new set of boot blocks and maps.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have a normal modem connected to the system
--- it's possible to use that as well.  You can use
PPP (the pppd program) to establish Internet connection
over normal phone lines.  There are also internal
ISDN, T1 "FRADs" (frame relay access devices) and
CSU/DSU (or Codecs --- coder decoder units) that can be
installed into your PC and controlled by Linux drivers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've seen references to the ipppd to control some
sorts of internal ISDN cards.  I think most of the others
have drivers that make them 'look like' a modem or ethernet
driver to Linux.

I just want to buy two 100mbs ethernet cards to hook up to each
other... so I don't think I'd need a hub do I?  I only want two
computers hooked up to this makeshift network.

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"

You either need a hub, or you need a "crossover"
ethernet patch cord.  A normal cat 5 ethernet patch
cord isn't wired correctly to directly connect two
ethernet cards.

I don't have such a link.  As you may have realized there
are  a couple of hundred HOWTO documents on Linux and
many of them relate to configuring various services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's go back to our list of different roles:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Network Server (which services)
Internet Gateway (proxy and/or masquerading)
Internet Host/Server (which services)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Starting at the top.  You have a small network that
is not normally connected to the Internet (there isn't
a permanent dedicated Internet connection).  So, you
probably want to use "private net" addresses for your
own systems.   These are IP addresses that are reserved
--- they'll never be issued to any host on the Internet
(so you won't create any localized routing ambiguities
by using them on your systems).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are three sets of these number:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
192.168.*.*			    255 Class C nets
172.16.*.* through 172.31.*.*        15 Class B nets
10.*.*.*                              1 Class A net
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... I use 192.168.42.* for my systems at home.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... These addresses can also be used behind firewalls
and Internet <EM>gateways</EM>.  The classic difference between
a router and a gateways is that a router just routes
package between networks (operating at the "transport"
layer of the ISO OSI reference model) while a gateway
does translation between protocols (operating at the
applications or other upper layers of the reference model).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the case of Linux we can configure our one Linux system
to act as local server and as an Internet gateway.   Our
gateway can operate through "proxying" (using SOCKS or
other applications layer utilities to relay connections
between our private network and the rest of the world), or
through IP masquerading (using network address translation
code built into the kernel to rewrite packets as they are
forwarded --- sort of a network layer transparent proxying
method).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, we're getting ahead of ourselves.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
First we need to setup our Linux LAN server.  So
we install Linux and configure its internal ethernet card
with an IP address like 192.168.5.1.  This should have a
route that points to our internal network, something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
route add -net 192.168.5.0 eth0
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... to tell the kernel that all of the 192.168.5.*
hosts will be on the eth0 segment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, what services do you want to make accessible
to your other systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
By default a Linux installation makes a common set of
services (telnet, NFS, FTP, rsh, rlogin, sendmail/SMTP, web,
samba/SMB, POP and IMAP etc) available to any system which
can reach you.  Most of these are accessible via the
"internet service dispatcher" called '<tt>inetd</tt>'. The list of
these services is in the <TT>/etc/inetd.conf</TT> file.  Some other
services, such as mail transport and relaying (sendmail),
and web (<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> httpd) 
are started in "standalone" mode --
that is they are started by <TT>/etc/rc.d/*/S*</TT> scripts.  NFS is
a special service which involves several different daemons
--- the portmapper and mountd in particular.  That's because
NFS is an "RPC" based service.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The fact that any system that can route packets to you can
request any service your system offers, and the fact that
most Unix and Linux systems offer a full suite of services
"right out of the box" has classically been a major security
problem.  Any bug in any service's daemon could result in a
full system compromise which could be exploited from
anywhere in the world.  This is what led to the creation of
TCP Wrappers (which is installed in all major Linux
distribution by default --- but is configured to be
completely permissive by default).  It is also why we have
"firewalls" and "packet filters."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's tempting to think that you'll be too obscure for anyone
to break into.  However, these days there are many crackers
and 'script kiddies' who spend an inordinate amount of time
"portscanning" --- looking for systems that are vulnerable
--- taking them over and using them for further portscanning
sniffing, password cracking, spamming, warez distribution
and other activities.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I recently had a DSL line installed.  So, I'm now
connected to the Internet full time.  I've had it in for
less than a month and there are no DNS records that point
to my IP addresses yet.  I've already had at least three
scans for a common set IMAP bugs and one for a '<tt>mountd</tt>'
bug.  So, I can guarantee you that you aren't too obscure
to worry about.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You are also at risk when you use dial-up PPP over ISDN or
POTS (plain old telephone service) lines.  The probabilities
are still reasonably on your side when you do this.
However, it's worth configuring your system to prevent these
problems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, you'll want to edit two files as follows:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote><pre>		/etc/hosts.allow
		ALL:LOCAL
</pre></blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote><pre>		/etc/hosts.deny
		ALL:ALL
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... that's the absolute minimum you should consider.
This configuration means that the tcpd program (TCP
Wrappers) will allow access to "local" systems (those
with no "dots" in their host names, relative to your
domain), and will deny access to all services by all
other parties.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For this to work properly you'll have to make sure that
all of your local hosts are given proper entries in your
<TT>/etc/hosts</TT> file and/or that you've properly set up your
own DNS servers with forward <EM>and reverse</EM> zones.  You'll
also want to make sure that your <TT>/etc/host.conf</TT> (libc5)
and/or <TT>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT> (glibc2, aka libc6) are
configured to give precedence to your hosts files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My host.conf file looks like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote><pre>		# /etc/host.conf
		order hosts bind
		multi on
</pre></blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
and my <TT>/etc/nsswitch.conf</TT> looks like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote><pre>		passwd: db files nis
		shadow: db files nis
		group:  db files nis

		hosts:		files dns
		networks:       files dns

		services:       db files
		protocols:      db files
		rpc:		db files
		ethers:		db files
		netmasks:       files
		netgroup:       files
		bootparams:     files

		automount:      files
		aliases:        files
</pre></blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
glibc2 has hooks to allow extensible lookup for
each of these features through modular service
libraries.  Thus we'll soon be seeing options to
put '<tt>LDAP</tt>' in this services switch file ---
so that hosts, user and group info, etc could be
served by an nss_ldap module which would talk to
some LDAP server.  We could see some user and group
information served by "Hesiod" records (over DNS
or secure DNS protocols) using some sort of <tt>nss_hesiod</tt>
module.  We might even see NDS (Novell/Netware directory
services) served via an <tt>nss_nds</tt> module.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But I'm straying from the point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once you've done this, you should be able to provide
normal services to your LAN.  Precisely how you set
up your client system depends on what OS they run and
which services you want to access.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For example.  If you want to share files over NFS with
your Linux or other Unix clients, you'd edit
the <TT>/etc/exports</TT> file on your Linux server to specify
which directory trees should be accessible to which
client systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's an exports file from one of my systems:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<blockquote><pre># /       *.starshine.org(ro,insecure,no_root_squash)
# /       192.168.5.*(ro,insecure,no_root_squash)
/etc/   (noaccess)
/root/  (noaccess)
/mnt/cdrom 192.168.5.*(insecure,ro,no_root_squash)
</pre></blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
... note I've marked two directories as "<tt>noaccess</tt>" which I
use when I'm exporting my root directory to my LAN.  I do
this to prevent any system in the rest of my network from
being able to read my configuration and passwd/shadow files.
I only export my root directory in read-only mode, and I
only do that occasionally and temporarily (which is why
these or commented out at the moment).  My CDROM I leave
available since I'm just not worried about anyone in the
house reading data off of any CD's I have around.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Keep in mind that NFS stands for "no flippin' security" ---
anyone in control of any system on your network can pose as
any non root user and access any NFS share "as" that user
(so far as all filesystem security permissions are
concerned.  NFS was designed for a time when sites only had
a few host systems and all of those were connected and
tightly controlled in locked rooms.  NFS was never intended
for use in modern environments where people can carry a
Linux, <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, or even Solaris x86 system into your office
under one arm (installed on a laptop) and connect it to the
nearest ethernet jack (now scattered throughout every corner
of modern offices --- I've seen them in the <em>reception
areas</em> of some sites).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To do filesharing for your Windows boxes you'd configure
Samba by editing <TT>/etc/smb.conf.</TT>  To act as a fileserver
for your MacOS systems you'd install and configure
'netatalk'.   To emulate a Netware fileserver you'd
install Mars_nwe, and/or buy a copy of the Netware Server
for Linux from <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> (<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com">http://www.caldera.com</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are ways to configure your system as a printer server
for any of these constituencies as well.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Beyond file and print services we move to the "commodity
internet services" like FTP, telnet, and HTTP (WWW).
There's generally no special configuration necessary for
these (if you've installed any of the general purpose
Linux distributions).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you create an FTP account in your <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file then
anonymous FTP will be allowed to access a limited
subdirectory of files.  If you rename this account to
"noftp" or to "ftpx" or to anything other than "ftp" and/or
if you remove the account entirely than you system will not
allow anonymous FTP at all.  If you allow anonymous FTP you
can simply put any file that you want made public into the
~ftp/pub directory --- and make sure that they are readable.
By default the FTP services are run through tcpd so they
will respect your hosts.allow/hosts.deny settings.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you're going to set up a "real" FTP site for
public mirroring or professional "extranet" applications
you'd want to use ncftpd, proftpd, or beroftpd instead of
the now aging WU-ftpd or the old BSD FTP daemon (in.ftpd).
These alternative FTP daemons have their own configuration
files and can support virtual hosting and other features.
In some of them you can create "virtual users --- accounts
that are only valid for FTP access to specific FTP subtrees
and/or virtually hosted services --- accounts that can be
used to access any other service on the system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Web services are controlled with their own configuration
files.  There are a couple of whole books just on the
configuration of Apache servers.  By default they let anyone
view any web pages that you put into the 'magic' directories
(<tt>/home/httpd/docs</tt> or something like that).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's possible to limit access to specific directories
according the the IP addresses (or reverse DNS names) of the
clients.  As with TCP Wrappers this should not be considered
to be a form "authentication" --- but it can be used to
distinguish between "local" and "non-local" systems <em>IF YOU
HAVE ANTI-SPOOFING PACKET FILTERS</em> in place (a part of any
good firewall).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<tt>telnet</tt>, <tt>rlogin</tt>, <tt>rsh</tt>, and other forms 
of interactive shell access are generally pretty easy to setup.  
Like many Unix/Linux services it is harder to disable or to limit
access to these services than it is to allow it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux access 
to these and other
"authenticating" services can be controlled by editing
PAM configuration files under <TT>/etc/pam.d/</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, the short answer to the question "How do I set
up Linux as a server?"  is you install it, setup
its address and routing, then you install and
configure the services that you want to provide.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, when we we want to use Linux as a gateway to
the Internet (or any other network --- to connect
you home network to your office or to a friend's
network) you first resolve the addressing and routing
issues (set up your second interface and add the
appropriate routes).  Then you use IP masquerading
<EM>or</EM> proxy services (SOCKS) to allow your systems
(using the non-routable "private net" addresses)
to access services on the Internet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To use IP masquerading with the old ipfwadm code
(as present in the standard 2.0.x kernels you just
issue a command like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
ipfwadm -F -a accept -m -D 0.0.0.0/0 -S 192.168.5.0/24
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
... which adds (<tt>-a</tt>) a rule to the forwarding (<tt>-F</tt>) table
to "accept" for "masquerading" (<tt>-m</tt>) any packets that are
"destined for" (<tt>-D</tt>) anywhere (<tt>0.0.0.0/0</tt>) and are from
source IP addresses (<tt>-S</tt>) that match the pattern
192.168.5.0/24 (an address mask that specifies the first
24 bits, or three octets as the "network portion" of the
address --- and therefore covers that whole class C
network).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You should definitely use a modular kernel and almost
certainly should have '<tt>kerneld</tt>' loaded when you use
this masquerading technique.  That's because there are
several common protocols (especially FTP) which require
special handling for masquerading (in the case of FTP
there's a data connection that comes back from the
server to the client, while the data connection when
in the usual direction from the client to the server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For this reason I actually prefer applications proxying.
To use that you go to the "contrib" directory at any Red Hat
site and download the SOCKS server and client packages.
You install the server on your Linux gateway then you
install the clients on any of your Linux clients.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the SOCKS gateway you create a file: <TT>/etc/socks5.conf</TT>
with something like this for its contents:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>		route   192.168.5.     -       eth0
		permit  -       -       -       -       -       -
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... there are many options that you can use to
limit access to the socks gateway --- but this is the
simplest working example.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the Linux clients you create a file named
<TT>/etc/libsocks5.conf</TT> with an entry in it that looks
something like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>	socks5 	   -	-	-	-	192.168.5.2
	noproxy	   -	192.168.5.	-
</pre></blockquote><BLOCKQUOTE>
... where the ".2" address is the one on which I was
running this SOCKS server.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the non Linux clients you have various different
configuration methods.  Most Windows TCP/IP utility
suites (other than Microsoft's) support SOCKS proxies.
There are replacement WINSOCK.DLL's that support this
proxying protocol transparently for most/all other
Windows services.  The MacOS applications also seem to
support SOCKS pretty widely.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are a few alternatives to NEC's SOCKS servers.
I've found "DeleGate" to be a pretty good one (search
for it on Freshmeat).  DeleGate as the advantage that you
can use it as a "manually traversed" proxy as well as
a "SOCKS" compatible one.  The SOCKS proxying protocol
allows the client software to communicate with the
proxy server to relay information about the request to
it, so that it can, in turn, relay that to a process
that runs on the external servers.  This is called
"traversal."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Non-SOCKS proxies have to have some other traversal
mechanism.  Many of them are "manually traversed" --- I
telnet or ftp to the TIS FWTK proxies (for example) and I
log in as "<A HREF="mailto:myname@myrealtarget.org"
		>myname@myrealtarget.org</A>." --- in other words I
encode additional account <EM>and destination</EM> information into
the prompts where I'd normally just put my account name.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
DeleGate allows you do use this manual traversal mechanism
when you are stuck with a non-SOCKSified client.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've also seen reference to another SOCKS server
package called "Dante" --- that's also listed at
Freshmeat (<A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net"
		>http://www.freshmeat.net</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are also a few other types of proxies for special
services.  For example the Apache web server, and the CERN
web server and a few others can be used as "caching web
proxies."  Squid can proxy and cache for web and FTP.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some services, such as mail and DNS are inherently
"proxy" capable by design.  I can't adequately cover
DNS or e-mail services in this message.  There are
full-sized books on each of these.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So that's the very basics of using Linux as a
gateway between a private LAN and the Internet.  If you
get a set of "real" IP addresses, and you insist on
using these to allow "DRIP" (directly routed IP) into your
LAN you don't have to do any of this IP masquerading or
proxying --- but you should do some packet filtering
to protect your client systems and servers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Good packet filtering is difficult.  I alluded to one of the
problem when I pointed out that FTP involves two different
connections --- an outgoing control connection and an
incoming data connection.  There's also a "PASV" or
"passive" mode which can help with that --- but it still
involves two connections.  This wreaks havoc with simple
packet filtering plans since we can't just blindly deny
"incoming" connection requests (based on the states of the
"SYN" and "ACK" flags in the TCP packet headers.  One of the
"advantages" (or complications) of "stateful inspection" is
that it tracks these constituent connections (and the TCP
sequencing of all connections) to ensure consistency.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A decent set of packet filters will involve much more code
than the set of proxying and masquerading examples I've
shown here.  I personally don't like DRIP configurations.  I
think they represent too much risk for typical home and
small business networks.  However, here's a sample
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre># Flush the packet filtering tables
/root/bin/flushfw

# Set default policy to deny

There are bugs in that filter set.  Reading the comments
you'll see where I know of a rule that handles most FTP ---
but opens risks any services that run on ports above 1024
--- like X windows (6000+) etc.  This would simply require
the attacker to have control of their system (be root on
their own Linux or other Unix system --- not too tough) and
for them to create package that appeared to come from their
TCP port 20 (the ftp data port).  That's also trivial for
anyone with a copy of '<tt>spak</tt>' (send packet).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, I have this rule commented out and I don't show a set of
rules to allow localhost systems to connect to a proxy FTP
system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that these addresses are bogus.  They don't point to
anything that I know of.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The only parts of this set of filters that I feel confident
about are the parts where I deny access for incoming spoofed
packets (the ones that claim to be from my own addresses or
from non-routable or "martian" addresses like localhost).  I
also have rules to prevent my system from "leaking" any
stray private net and/or martian packets out into the
Internet.  This is a courtesy --- and it has the practical
benefit that I'm much less likely to "leak" any confidential
data that I'm sharing between "private net" system on my LAN
--- even if I screw up my routing tables and try to send
them out.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've read a bit about <tt>ipfil</tt> (Darren Reed's IP Filtering
package --- which is the de facto standard on FreeBSD and
other BSD systems and which can be compiled and run on
Linux.  This seems to offer some "stateful" features that
might allow one to more safely allow non-passive FTP.
However, I don't know the details.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The 2.2 kernels will include revamped kernel packet
filtering which will be controlled by the 'ipchains'
command.  This is also available as a set of unofficial
patches to the 2.0 series of kernels.  This doesn't seem to
offer any "stateful inspection" features but it does have a
number of enhancents over the existing ifpwadm controlled
tables.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your last question was about configuring Linux as an
Internet server (presumably for public web pages, FTP or
other common Internet services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As you might have gathered by now; that is the same as
providing these service to your own LAN.  Under Linux (and
other forms of Unix) any service default to world-wide
availability (which is why we have firewalls).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've spent some time describing how Linux and other Unix
systems need to be specially configured in order to <EM>limit</EM>
access to services to specific networks.  Otherwise someone
in Brazil can as easily print document on your printer as
you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To be an Internet server all you have to do is have a static
IP address (or regularly update your address record at
<A HREF="http://www.ml.org">http://www.ml.org</A>).  Once people know how to route requests
to your server --- assuming you haven't taken steps to block
those requests --- Linux will serve them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most of the challenges in setting up networks relate
to addressing, routing, naming and security.  Most of us
still use "static" routing for our own networks ---
just manually assigning IP addresses when we first deploy
our new systems.  Most of us with dial-in PPP get dynamic
IP addresses from our ISP's.  Some sites now use DHCP to
provide dynamic addresses to desktop systems (servers
still need consistent addresses --- and using DHCP for
those just introduced additional opportunities for failure).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For routing, subnetting, and LAN segmentation issues ---
read my posting on routing from last month (I think Heather is
publishing it this month).  That's about 30 pages long!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(The one thing I glossed over in that was "proxyarp"
on ethernet.  It's covered in <a href="72.html">another message
this month</a> so glance at it if you'd like to learn more.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I hope I've imparted some hint on the importance of
considering your systems security.  Even if you have nothing
of value on your systems --- if the thought of some cracker
vandalizing your files for kicks is of no concern to you ---
it is irresponsible to connect a poorly secured system to
the Internet (since your compromised system may be used to
harass other networks).

I would like to write a faq about this after I'm done... hopefully
I can help other after a bit of exprimenting myself.

While the offer is appreciated --- it would be more of a
book than an FAQ.  However, I would like to see some "Case
Studies" --- descriptions of typical SOHO (small office,
home office), departmental, and enterprise Linux (and
heterogenous) installations.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These would include network maps, "sanitized" examples of
the addresses, routing tables and configuration files for
all services that are deployed in the network, on all of the
clients and servers present.  Company, domain and other
names, and IP addresses would be "anonymized" to discourage
any abuse and minimize any risk represented by exposure.
(E-mail addresses of the contributors could be "blind"
aliased through my domain or hotmail, or whatever).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The important thing here is to define the precise mixture of
services that you intend to provide and the list of users
and groups to which you intend to provide them.  This is a
process that I've harped on before -- requirements analysis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You need to know <EM>who</EM> you are serving and <EM>what</EM> services
they need.
