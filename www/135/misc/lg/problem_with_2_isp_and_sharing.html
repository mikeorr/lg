Dear list,
</p>

<p>
hope every one is well in the new year and charged to do
more with linux <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
I have a critical problem with my net setting and searching
for some kind guidance.
</p>

<p>
well, I have 2 ISP and a load balancing router ( Linksys
RV042).
My one ISP, say ISP1 is based on ADSL technology. The modem
to dialup ISP1 is
smartATX MT841 and it has inbuilt dialing feature. so a
connection from this 
smartATX MT841 direcly comes to WAN1 port the of the load
balancing router.
</p>

<p>
another ISP, say ISP2. now there is a PC with 2 lan card for
this isp2. one lan dialups
ISP2 and another lan card from this same machine fed this
connection to the WAN2 port
of the load balancing router.
</p>

<p>
till now there is no problem at all and the load balancing
feature is running great.
</p>

<p>
BUT the problem is with the PC which dialups the ISP2 and
fed the connection to 
the load balancing router. it actually behaves like a modem.
so the user in that machine
can't share the local lan resources and we can't share the
resources of that PC.
</p>

<p>
could any one kindly suggest any solution please ?
thanks for the support.
</p>
