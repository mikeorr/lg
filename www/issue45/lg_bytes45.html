<FONT COLOR="green">Network giants install Linux-based test bed
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> Chicago, IL (August 23, 1999) -Linux continues to receive solid backing from
major players, with Cabletron Systems, Xylan and FORE Systems installing
network test equipment based on the popular open-source software. Designed
by benchmarking specialist Neal Nelson &amp; Associates, the Network Stress Test
is the first large-scale tool to use real clients and servers to send actual
network traffic at very high bit rates.  The speed and bandwidth capacity of
the Linux platform, coupled with Nelson's unique testing methodology,
enables manufacturers and potential buyers alike to evaluate new products
using the most extreme, real-world network traffic patterns.

<P> Unlocking the power of Linux
"Linux is an excellent operating system for large clusters of computers,"
comments John Hynds, Director of Systems Engineering for Xylan.  "It has
very efficient LAN drivers, can generate high volumes of network traffic and
comes with a full set of client and server application software.  Also,
there are no additional licensing charges when it is installed on a cluster
with any number of individual machines.  It is a very powerful and
cost-effective option."

<P> Real network traffic provides superior testing
While other testing methods generate artificial packets of data from
simulated applications, Nelson's breakthrough in network testing enables
technicians to quickly and easily configure thousands of real clients
talking to thousands of real servers in a laboratory environment.  Billions
of bits per second of real network traffic are generated by the technique,
and the network throughput can be immediately analyzed to uncover problem
areas.

<P> "This type of testing makes a lot of sense," says Kevin Brown, Senior
Marketing Director for Cabletron.  "Using high volumes of real network
traffic is completely different from, and in some ways superior to, testing
with artificial traffic generators.  Neal Nelson's method assures us that we
have put our products through the most realistic stress test possible."

<P> Automated test execution:
the Network Stress Test is a fully automated benchmark that can conduct long
and complicated tests with just a few clicks of the mouse.  Vendors can now
conduct quality testing more efficiently, ensuring that their products are
of the highest reliability before they are released in the market.  This
automation significantly improves on the industry standard 30-minute tests,
which needed to be re-set manually.

<P> The Network Stress Test runs on a cluster of Linux-based computers with
multiple local area network adapters in each machine. The infrastructure can
support 10,000 simultaneous user sessions and perform a variety of common
network activities like web browsing, Telnet/Rlogin sessions, FTP file
transfers, email, streaming video and multicast communications.

<P> Neal Nelson, founder of Neal Nelson &amp; Associates, originally developed
the testing infrastructure for use at the US Army Technology Integration Center
in Fort Huachuca, Arizona.  He comments:  "Modern networks are being challenged
to handle increasingly complex loads that include huge volumes of World Wide
Web traffic, audio streams, video streams and multicast data.  These rapid
innovations in network technology required that we develop similar advances in
network testing techniques.  The result is our Network Stress Test - one tough
test that can assure vendors and buyers that their products won't let them down
in high-traffic, real-world conditions."

<P> About Cabletron:
Cabletron Systems is a pioneer in high-performance computer networking and
provides dependable network access and communications to millions of people
worldwide. With scaleable products designed for Fortune 1000 enterprise

<P> Applications such as weather modeling, fluid flow analysis, real-time ray
tracing and molecular modeling, traditionally have been run on supercomputers.
Through the clustering of high-performance Windows NT servers or Beowulf Linux
clusters, engineers and scientists can achieve the advantages of speed and
availability, leverage the latest technologies and lower costs.  The clustered
systems work in parallel on a scientific challenge, coordinating with each
other on the intermediate results.  The combined MPI/Pro and cLAN solution

<FONT COLOR="green">Udanax (Xanadu) hypertext system now open source
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> Monterey, California(August 23, 1999):  Ted Nelson announced today that
the source code for a working implementation of the Xanadu  hypertext
system are being made open source for developers.  
Udanax.com --
formerly Xanadu Operating Company (XOC, Inc.)  -- released the code and
will serve as the focal point for continuing development and
application of these powerful hypertext systems.   

<P> In 1960, Nelson, who coined the term "hypertext", envisioned a
revolutionary system of publishing.  He foresaw the power of publishing
over computer networks like the World Wide Web but his original vision
exceeded the capabilities of the Web.   Nelson termed this vision
"Xanadu" and has sought to implement it through numerous efforts. 
Udanax is the result of some of this effort.     

<P> With the Xanadu schemes developed by Udanax.com:
<UL>
	<LI> links do not break -- no matter how documents are moved or edited,
links remain intact;
	<LI> many versions can be compared to track the evolution of documents;
	<LI> links go two ways -- you can see the links pointing into a document
as well as pointing out;
	<LI> documents can be edited by multiple authors allowing real time
collaboration
	<LI> documents can be created out of portions of other documents -- and
you can track the source of all portions.
</UL>

<P> According to Nelson, "The Web is a foam of ever popping bubbles, rather
than stable literature."   The key technical difference between the
Udanax implementations of hypertext and the WWW mechanism (HTML) is in
how connections between documents are tracked.  In HTML, the links are
embedded in the document itself and are essentially named by the
location of the machine where the document is stored.  Move the cited
document -- the link breaks (404 errors). In the Udanax systems, the
connections between documents are managed independently of the
documents using sophisticated software algorithms.  

<P> The Udanax development efforts focused on the "back-end" or server
component of the software.  By making Udanax open source, developers
can work on "front-ends" or browsers for different applications. 
"Rather than focusing on a glossy user interface, the Udanax team has
focused on building a complex and robust system to manage the
information." Gregory said.  To date, over 1,500 developers have
indicated interest in developing applications for the Udanax system.

file operations (starting, opening and initialisation of modules) and checks
objects for viruses. Constant presence of the program in computer's memory
allows reliable control over all possible ways of virus attacks on a
computer or corporate network. Besides, AVP Monitor makes anti-virus defense
very convenient and easy to use: it is enough to install and launch the
program each time the computer starts.
