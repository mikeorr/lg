Each year, the USENIX organization (http://www.usenix.org/) puts on a technical
conference dealing with UNIX and other UNIX-like systems. This year
they had an emphasis on free or Open Source operating systems, primarily
Linux and *BSD. The conference was held in New Orleans, Louisiana from June 15th to
the 20th.
<p>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>
Many day-long tutorials were offered on Monday and Tuesday including
``Inside the Linux Kernel'' by Stephen Tweedie, one of the EXT2
developers, and
several talks on Networking and Security. I attended ``Hot Topics in
System Administration'', taught by Treni Hein and Evi Nemeth.
They covered many topics including Samba, Packet Filtering and IPv6.
<p>
<h3>Vendor Expo</h3>
<p>
I found it refreshing to see a vendor exposition (albeit a small one) comprised
completely of UNIX-friendly companies. O'Reilly was there, displaying all of their
titles for sale at 20% off. Needless to say, this made it one of the most
popular booths. Most of the faces were familiar: Red Hat, Linux
International, InfoMagic, the three heads of BSD and others. Among
the unexpected participants was the FBI, just a short distance from the
Free Software Foundation. The whole
atmosphere of the exposition was quite relaxed, without the
hectic feel of Comdex and other large industry trade shows.
<p>
<h3>BOFs and Speeches</h3>
<p>
Each evening offered several talks by different people on a
wide range of subjects. I caught ``The State of Linux'' talk by Linus
Torvalds on Thursday afternoon. He set Aug/Sep 98 as a hopeful release
date for the 2.2 kernel. Another event that took place every evening was
the ``Birds
of a Feather'' (BOF) meetings, which were designed as a place for
people with common interests to come together and discuss their ideas and
goals. It was also a great place to rub
shoulders with some of the ``big names'' in the UNIX community,
such as Keith Bolstic, Eric Allman and Jon ``maddog'' Hall.
<p>
<h3>Terminal Room</h3>
<p>
What UNIX conference would be complete without a terminal room?
Luckily, Earthlink and openBSD donated machines and bandwidth and created a
room with thirty or so machines running openBSD, connected to a T1.
<p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
If I were to do it all over again (and I most definitely want to), I
would spend more time planning what I want to learn. I was
a bit overwhelmed by
the sheer number of talks/events, and therefore found it difficult
to focus on exactly what I wanted to get from the experience--I was
constantly spreading myself too thin.
For any UNIX, Linux, BSD etc. lover, USENIX is a must at least once in
a lifetime. It is a very friendly and co-operative environment and has
definitely earned its reputation as one of the hubs of the computing
community.
