<p>
Quick regular expressions questions, I have a string and i want to
return only whats inside the quotes inside that string - example the
string is -&gt; "Deividson" Okopnik &lt;-, and i want only -&gt; "Deividson"
&lt;-. Its guaranted that there will be only a single pair of
double-quotes inside the string, but the lenght of the string inside
it is not constant.
</p>

<p>
Im using PHP btw
</p>

<p>
Thanks

<p>
Given that there's only one pair of double quotes, that's pretty easy.
Assuming that you're using PHP's "preg_replace" function, and that your
content is in a variable called $name:
</p>

<pre>
echo preg_replace('/"(.*)"/', '$1', $name);
</pre>

<p>
If there was more than one set of double quotes, and you wanted to make
sure that you only got the content of the first one, you'd need to use a
"balanced" capture. This is one of those classic regex methods that
comes up all the time, and is well worth knowing.
</p>

<pre>
echo preg_replace('/"([^"]+)"/', '$1', $name);
</pre>

<p>
In Perl, you can comment regular expressions by using the '/x' option.
I'll do that so I can explain what's going on:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
/
"		# Match the opening double quote
(		# Begin capturing the content
[^"]+	# One or more characters which are NOT double quotes
)		# End capture (content will be in $1)
"		# Closing double quote
/x;
</pre>

<p>
This is very common in processing HTML. Capturing tag content, for
example, looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
/&lt;([^&gt;]+)&gt;/
</pre>

Whoops - I just realized that I forgot to throw away the rest of the
line (for some reason, I thought I was just extracting the matched
part.) I always knew that doing PHP would rot my brain sooner or later.

Any reason for the use of '+' instead of '*' in the second example? It 
could be there is a null string enclosed in quotes, which the first one 
would get and the second would miss.

I've been working with regexes for many years now, and have never seen a
practical reason for matching a null string. Do you know of a situation
in which having a null string is to be preferred over 'undef' (the
result of checking $1 when no capture has occurred)?

Still doesn't answer why you use the <em>zero</em> the first solution, and the

<p>
Maybe this string is valid input...

<p>
   An "" example

A zero length string indicates the input was valid, and undef would 
indicate the input line was not of the correct format. A zero length string
is often a perfectly ok value, and is different from nothing found.

actually, i just noticed there are 2 sets of quotes in the string (the

the content of the second quotes pair of quotes...

Yep - since the initial '.*' is (correctly) greedy and consumes
everything up to the last pair of quotes. If you always want the first
pair, you could specify that in a couple of different ways in PHP:
</p>

<pre>
// Method #1
preg_match('/"([^"]+)"/', $verse_body, $found);
echo $found[1];
 
// Method #2
echo preg_replace('/^[^"]+"([^"]+)".*/', '$1', $verse_body);
</pre>

This is like asking why I would use a cup to drink my coffee one morning
and a mug the next. The answer is, there's no real reason - since it
doesn't matter one way or the other. If there's any reason at all, it
may well be that I didn't do the dishes the night before and that the
mug happened to be clean - i.e., the reason doesn't have anything to do
with the thing you're asking about.
</p>

<p>
There are plenty of situations where '*' vs. '+' would matter, of
course. This just doesn't happen to be one of them.

<p>
Really? That's a new one on me. In fact, I can demonstrate that this is
incorrect in <em>both</em> directions.
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ perl -wle'$a=undef; $b=qq["$a"]; $b=~/"([^"]*)"/; print $1'
Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.) or string at -e line 1.
</pre>

<p>
Even though the format was indeed correct - i.e., there were two double
quotes in the string - the capture returned 'undef'.
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:~$ perl -wle'$b=qq["""]; $b=~/"([^"]*)"/; print "-$1-"'
<pre>-- 
</pre>
</pre>quotes in the string - the capture returned an empty string.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; A zero length string
&gt; is often a perfectly ok value, and is different from nothing found.
</pre>

<p>
"undef" is also often a perfectly OK value, although it is indeed
different from an empty string.
</p>

<p>
Jim, I understand that you're wondering about the inconsistency in my
two regexes. The inconsistency is indeed there, but - as I've explained
above - in the case of the problem as originally defined by Deividson,
it really makes zero difference. Your idea about "correct format",
though, is a case of making <em>way</em> too much soup out of a single oyster.

weirdly enough, both ways are still returning me the content of the
second pair of quotes... On method 1, found [0] is the content of the

If you show us the wrong data, you're likely to get the wrong answer. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
The regex would have worked fine for the string that you initially
showed us.
</p>

<p>
I've just taken a look at the site, and the line you're trying to
process does not contain what you think it does. "View source" shows the
following:
</p>

<pre>
&amp;ldquo;I will praise you with an upright heart as I learn your righteous laws.&amp;rdquo;- [...]
</pre>

<p>
This will, of course, not work with the regex. You'll need to do some
processing first - PHP has functions for converting HTML to text - and
then do the extraction. HTML can be pretty tricky that way.

It's being greedy, as has already been said. You need to alter the regexp 
to <em>something</em> like....

  '/[^"]*"([^"]+)".*/'

i.e. match any non-" chars and find the first "
