The address to which you have sent your query is that of The Answer Gang
for the Linux Gazette. We answer questions related to the Linux operating
system. Unrelated questions are likely to get anything ranging from a
polite answer to astonished laughter, with curmudgeonly replies being
somewhat of a norm. Good karma points are awarded to those who tell us
where they got our address and the reason they thought that we might help
with fish identification, spaceship repair, or nude snowboarding.

Spammers will be whacked with a dead trout; flames will be graded for
content, laughed at, and sent to /dev/null; amusing bits may get shared
with our readers.

Good luck with your search.
