<center><b><font size=+1>Final Thoughts</font></b></center>

<p>O'Reilly has put their <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/samba/chapter/book/">Using
Samba</a> book on line. This is a truly great resource that you should
explore in detail. It is very well written and current.
<p>Some things you can do with Samba:
<blockquote>You can set a number of parameters in the logon.bat. Remember:
the logon.bat has to be a dos file! Here is what mine looks like:
<p><tt>net time \\master /set /yes</tt>
<br><tt>net use H: /home</tt>
<br><tt>net use N: \\master\Netscape /yes</tt>
<p>The first line sets the windows computer clock to the samba server's
time. You also need to add this line to the smb.conf file in the [global]
section to make it happen:
<p><tt>time server = yes</tt>
<p>The second line in the logon.bat makes the H drive on the windows computer
be your home directory on the linux server. This is in addition to the
profile directory be automatically synched. Again, you have to add a line
to the smb.conf file in the [global] section:
<p><tt>logon home = \\master\%U</tt>
<p>where \\master is the name of the samba server.
<p>The last line in my logon.bat sets drive letter and automatically mounts
my netscape profiles resource.&nbsp; When you first create a profile in
Netscape in windows - using Netscape's profile manager - you can tell it
where to put all the user's files. By using a share on your linux server,
you can have your Netscape profile follow you from computer to computer
in windows. You will have to add a section to the smb.conf file to make
this happen. Here is what I have in mine to support this:
<p><tt>[Netscape]</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;comment = Netscape Profiles</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;path = /backup/netscape</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;read only = no</tt>
<p>And if you want to get real fancy, make a link from the bookmarks.html
in your linux home directory on the server to the directory samba is sharing.
In my case it will look like this - all on one line:
<p><tt><font size=-1>ln -s /home/jpollman/.netscape/bookmarks.html /backup/netscape/jpollman/bookmark.htm</font></tt>
<p>Now, whether I am using Netscape in Linux or Windows, I am using the
same bookmark file.
<p>Some thoughts on drive letters - before you get too carried away.&nbsp;
We use "U:" for USER, but "H:" is common and typically symbolizes "Home".&nbsp;
Go for things that are easy to remember in any other share, "F:" for family,
"N:" for Netscape, "T:" for Team, "P:" for public, etc.&nbsp; That makes
it easy for you to explain to the intended audience and easy for them to
remember.&nbsp; Those conventions are common in the Novell environment.
<p>Note: Avoid "Z:" if you'll have Win9x machines logging into your box.&nbsp;
Z:
<br>gets mapped to NETLOGIN by default and mapping things to it in the
logon.bat file will cause a prompt y/n dialog with the user -- answering
"Yes" to remap the resource to Z will fail anyway =)&nbsp; WinNT machines
do not have that same limitation.
<p>You can also map LPT ports in the login.bat file:
<blockquote><i>net use LPT2: \\master\{name of printer share}</i></blockquote>
Hint: Always start at LPT2: in case the user has a local printer, or other
device attached to LPT1:&nbsp; We've mapped upto 9 printers to our networked
PCs.&nbsp; This allows you to add the printer as if it were physically
connected to your machine.&nbsp; That'll help if the printer isn't specifically
supported by
<br>Linux (Lexmark 3200) and you'll get full control over it's options
at each workstation -- each user can have different document defaults!
<p>If the logon.bat is having problems and goes by too fast to see what
is going on, put in a line that says just:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pause
<p>This will stop the batch file until you hit enter.</blockquote>
NFS: there are two issues about nfs that seem to show up all the time in
the newsgroups. First,&nbsp; linux nfs broadcasts that it is version 3,
when it is really version 2. If you are running solaris, you have to use
vers=2 to make the solaris mount work. Second, if you are using NIS, NIS
does not mount anything. To make NIS work the way you think it should,
you need NIS, nfs, and autofs working together: NIS provides the login
verification and tells the system what the user's home directory is, autofs
sees someone trying to access /home/user and then uses nfs to mount that
directory.
