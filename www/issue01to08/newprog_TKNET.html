<P>
Following a brief but enjoyable conversation with John, I am delighted to 
have been asked to introduce 
<A HREF="http://public.logica.com/~kempsonc/tknet.htm"><I>TkNet</I></A> to you 
as part of this new column.  <I>TkNet</I> is already well know by a large 
number of people, despite having been released less than three months ago, 
and  I have been, if not submerged, at least wetted thoroughly by very 
positive comments and criticisms since the version 0.9 was released in 
December '95!  Version 1.0 followed soon after, incorporating many 
suggestions and comments, and was (in my admittedly biased opinion) a large 
improvement on the original.
<P>
So <B>what</B> is it???
<P>
Well, it's an attempt to make connecting to the Internet via your friendly 
local service provider using <B>SLIP</B> or <B>PPP</B> a much simpler 
operation than it has previously been.  <I>TkNet</I> provides a simple 
<I>point & click metaphor</I> for connection, disconnection and status 
display, with many, many configurable 
<A HREF="http://public.logica.com/~kempsonc/tn_feat.htm">options</A>, all 
accessible through the 
<A HREF="http://www.smli.com:80/research/tcl/">Tcl/Tk</A> based interface (for 
the intellectually challenged amongst you, the basis for the name 
<I>Tk</I>Net!).
<P>
Check out the 
<A HREF="http://public.logica.com/~kempsonc/tknet.htm"><I>TkNet</I> web 
page</A>, or go directly to a screenshot of the <A
HREF="http://public.logica.com/~kempsonc/tn_mw.htm">main 
window</A>.  You can get version 1.0 of <I>Tknet</I> on all sunsite mirrors, 
or the latest patched (hey, I never said I was perfect!) version from the 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.logica.com/pub/kempsonc/tknet">Logica FTP site</A>. 
Meanwhile, I am continuing work on the next release, which will provide 
graphical PPP configuration - <I>wow</I>!  I'll be releasing some screen 
shots onto the web site soon, but release is a month or more away, so don't 
hold your breath.
Enjoy!
<P>
