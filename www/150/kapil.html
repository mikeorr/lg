<h1>Virtualizing without Virtualizing</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</a></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p> Nowadays one <a href="../142/lg_bytes.html">reads</a> <A href="../143/lg_bytes.html">a lot</a> about
<a href="../145/lg_bytes.html">virtualization</a>.
The Gazette even ran an <a href="../144/howell.html">article</a> on it. Most
of these reports talk about Xen, Vserver, OpenVZ, Qemu, User Mode
Linux or co-Linux. Each of those modern technologies has its
place no doubt, but this article will concentrate on the humble
<code>chroot</code> way of running programs in a virtual
environment.</p>

<p> Here is the <b>EULA</b><sup><a name="text1" href="#note1">1</a></sup> that you must agree to if you want to read
further:</p>

<ul>
<li>The software you want to run
&ldquo;virtually&rdquo; <em>can</em> run with your currently
running kernel.</li>

<li>Your super-user avatar trusts that the
software you want to run is no less trustworthy than the
software that is currently running on the system.</li>

<li>You have enough disk-space to replicate
a complete installation.</li>

<li>You use Debian or a derived
distribution. (These days that last line probably reads:
&ldquo;You run Ubuntu!&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p> Here some possible scenarios where one might want to run
programs in a virtual context in spite of these (admittedly
rather stringent) conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have installed the
<code>amd64</code> flavour of Debian but you need to compile
and/or use 32-bit programs. (Read as: You want to see those
<code>flash</code> thingies that everyone is talking
about!).</li>

<li>You have installed Debian
<em>stable</em> but you want to &ldquo;try out&rdquo; some
packages from <em>testing</em> or <em>unstable</em>; and you
don&rsquo;t really want to mess up your stable installation.
(<code>apt-get</code> is great for resolving dependencies for
<em>upgrades</em>; those who tried a <em>downgrade</em> have
not lived to tell the tale).</li>

<li>You really like Debian but the <b>BDFL</b><sup><a name="text2"
href="#note2">2</a></sup> has waltzed into town looking for new employees
for Canonical and you want to impress him by running the Hardy Heron.</li>

<li>&ldquo;Girls<sup><a name="text3" href="#note3">3</a></sup> just want to
have fun!&rdquo;.  This is often the best reason of all &mdash; after all
LG stands for Fun with Linux!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ask the super</h3>

<p> Your super-user avatar (SU) must carry out the following steps
for you to enter the virtual context.</p>


<h4>Allocate disk space</h4>


<p> Either there is already enough disk space on some mounted
partition or you have an unused partition. You will need this
empty space to appear in some fixed location like
<code>/srv/schroot</code>. SU can use <code>mount</code> (with
the <code>--bind</code> option in the former case) to set this
up.</p>

<h4>Create a new Debian installation</h4>

<p> Do <em>not</em> reach for that Debian boot CD! Here is a way
that does not destroy your uptime record. SU should install
<code>debootstrap</code>:</p>
<pre>
apt-get install debootstrap
</pre>

<p> and run it:</p>
<pre>
debootstrap --include=iceweasel,mozplugger lenny /srv/schroot
</pre>

<p> SU can of course replace <code>iceweasel</code> and
<code>mozplugger</code> by any comma-separated list of programs
which need to be installed. It is nice to add a local mirror at
the tail end of the <code>debootstrap</code> invocation so as to
get a faster download.</p>

<h4>The main program</h4>

<p> Since you run Debian, installing <code>schroot</code> is as
easy as SU running:</p>
<pre>
apt-get install schroot
</pre>

<p> You also need to configure <code>schroot</code>; there are a
number of rather interesting options. The following configuration
stanza seemed to be just right:</p>
<pre class="code">
[lenny]
description=Debian lenny (testing)
location=/srv/schroot
type=directory
users=luser
root-groups=root
root-users=root
aliases=testing,default
run-setup-scripts=true
run-exec-scripts=true
</pre>

<p> If you are planning to use a 32-bit chroot under a 64-bit
system then you need to have <code>personality=linux32</code> as
part of this configuration. The above stanza is placed in the
file <code>schroot.conf</code> in the configuration directory
<code>/etc/schroot/</code>. It says that SU allows the user
<code>luser</code> to use <code>schroot</code> to run under the
directory <code>/src/schroot</code> after various standard setup
and startup scripts have been executed.</p>

<p> You should also look through the setup script
<code>10mount</code> in the <code>setup.d</code> sub-directory of
the above directory as you may need to create some additional
mounts. For example, adding the line</p>
<pre>
do_mount "-o rw,bind" "/dev/snd"    "${CHROOT_PATH}/dev/snd"
</pre>

<p> to <code>10mount</code> together with the creation of the
<code>dev/snd</code> subdirectory of <code>/srv/schroot</code>
ensures that the (ALSA) sound devices are accessible in the
chroot. This is extremely important for <code>flash</code>!</p>

<p> That completes the setup that the super-user needs to do.
After this, <code>luser</code> can go ahead and play in this newly
created &ldquo;sand-box&rdquo;.</p>


<h3>All play and no work</h3>

<p> The authorized user <code>luser</code> can execute a shell by
running</p>
<pre>
schroot -p -c lenny
</pre>

<p> The shell will normally run in an environment where the users
home directories, <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/dev</code> will be
mounted from the base system. Hence it should be possible to
execute commands with need the X window environment as well. (The
<code>-p</code> option given above is required to preserve the
environment that includes the <code>DISPLAY</code> variable).</p>

<p> Another way to run a command like <code>iceweasel</code>
directly is</p>
<pre>
schroot -p -c lenny iceweasel
</pre>

<p> Note that each such command creates a new schroot
&ldquo;session&rdquo;. To re-use an already created session, you
must save the session identifier and use it. For example, you can
start a new session, without any command:</p>
<pre>
SCHROOT_SESSION=$(schroot -b -c lenny)
</pre>

<p> If you then issue the command</p>
<pre>
schroot -p --chroot $(SCHROOT_SESSION) iceweasel
</pre>

<p> the weasel will start up and run in that session. If you run
this command another time, you will not create a new session.</p>


<h3>Philosophy</h3>

<p> The <code>chroot</code> command has existed for
&ldquo;eons&rdquo;, but it was often felt that it is &ldquo;for
the super-user only&rdquo;. By using <code>schroot</code> it
becomes quite safely accessible to the regular user of the
system. Using this kind of minimal virtualisation is certainly
not in the same league security-wise as the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
virtualisation techniques but has no overhead (except
disk-usage); I hope the article demonstrates that
<code>schroot</code> is at least as easy to set up.</p>

<p> Using <code>schroot</code> is a good solution to the
frequently asked question:</p>

<blockquote>
How do I run the <em>late-esht</em> version of &lt;name your
favourite rapidly developing application&gt; on Debian?
</blockquote>

<p> In my opinion, the above solution is to be preferred over
running a mixed <em>stable/testing</em> version of Debian. Even
<em>backports</em> are slightly worse, as a mixed
<em>stable/backports</em> environment is not what the packages
are being tested in by most developers.</p>

<p> The motivation to write this article came from a discussion I
saw in the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/277799/">letters</a>
to <a href="http://lwn.net">Linux Weekly News</a> where people
said that Debian was hindering those who want to run 32-bit
programs on a 64-bit system. If indeed mixed library setups are
well packaged and maintained, then that is easier than the
solution herein. All the same, Debian does have <em>this</em>
solution!</p>

<p> The title of this article is inspired by John Archibald
Wheeler, one of the most fascinating physicists of the 20th
century, who passed away recently.</p>

Kapil Hari Paranjape has been a ``hack''-er since his punch-card days.
Specifically, this means that he has never written a ``real'' program.
He has merely tinkered with programs written by others. After playing
with Minix in 1990-91 he thought of writing his first program---a
``genuine'' *nix kernel for the x86 class of machines. Luckily for him a
certain L. Torvalds got there first---thereby saving him the trouble
(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those
days---much to the dismay of many around him who think he should
concentrate on mathematical research---which is his paying job. The
interplay between actual running programs, what can be computed in
principle and what can be shown to exist continues to fascinate him.
