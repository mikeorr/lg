Hello TAG:
</p>

<p>
I have been using 'rsync' off late for backups and helping my Prof. do
the same as well.
</p>

<p>
My prof. has ~6G space left on his hard disk and we are trying to back
up everything (~200 G)to a external HDD.  As 'rsync' progresses, the
disk space on the (source) hard disk gets consumed incrementally and
large files (~14G) cannot be copied to the backup hard-disk. rsycn
fails saying "No disk space left on device". I wonder why. I can try
to look into rsync source to see why this happens. But, why is rsync
consuming disk space on the source disk? Its a file copy operation
right? It should consume the main memory, not the secondary memory.
Or, is it a virtual memory thing?
</p>

<p>
Thanks for any insights!
</p>

<p>
Best Regards,
Amit

<h3>compressing sparse file(s) while still maintaining their holes</h3>

<p>
Due to certain reasons, we might have sparse file and want to compress
it. However, we want to maintain its sparseness. Can we do it the
usual way? Let's say we have this file:
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=./sparse.img bs=1K seek=400 count=0
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
0 bytes (0 B) copied, 2.3956e-05 s, 0.0 kB/s
</p>

<p>
$ ls -lsh sparse.img
4.0K -rw-rw-r-- 1 mulyadi mulyadi 400K 2010-03-29 21:14 sparse.img
</p>

<p>
$ gzip sparse.img
$ ls -lsh sparse.img.gz
8.0K -rw-rw-r-- 1 mulyadi mulyadi 443 2010-03-29 21:14 sparse.img.gz
</p>

<p>
$ gunzip sparse.img.gz
$ ls -lsh sparse.img
408K -rw-rw-r-- 1 mulyadi mulyadi 400K 2010-03-29 21:14 sparse.img
</p>

<p>
Bad. After decompression, total blocks occupied by the file "grows"
from 4KiB to 408 KiB.
</p>

<p>
The trick is by using tar with -S option:
$ tar -Sczvf sparse.img.tgz sparse.img
</p>

<p>
$ ls -lsh sparse.img.tgz
8.0K -rw-rw-r-- 1 mulyadi mulyadi 136 2010-03-29 21:18 sparse.img.tgz
</p>

<p>
$ tar -xzvf sparse.img.tgz
$ ls -lsh sparse.img
4.0K -rw-rw-r-- 1 mulyadi mulyadi 400K 2010-03-29 21:17 sparse.img
</p>

<p>
As you can see, the total block size of "sparse.img" are correctly
restored after decompression.

<p>
Hi, gang - 
</p>

<p>
After a history of losing data to dying computers (yes, yes, I know,
it's really about not backing up data adequately), I've come to prefer
leaving my e-mail on remote servers rather than dealing with it locally.
As a result, my non-webmail interaction is done via ssh. I've learned to
run screen so that a dropped connection doesn't result in losing
half-composed mail, but I haven't figured out what to do with my frozen
xterm window. 
</p>

<p>
What I mean by this is that I end up losing the connection, having to
reconnect, and then having to kill the frozen-by-dropped-connection
window. Is there a way that I can resuscitate the dead session in the
existing window, rather than opening up a new xterm window and killing
the old one?
</p>

<p>
Please be gentle as I expose my lack of proper terminology. I'm pretty
sure I'm not describing my problem using all the right words, but I'm
hoping I've come close enough for someone to figure out how I <strong>should</strong>
have put it. (I'd ask my resident *nix guru to vet my question, but he's
up against a deadline while running short on sleep.) I'd wait to ask my
question, but I suspect I'd forget to ask, again...

Hi all
</p>

<p>
Once I read there is a way to close a listening/half
open/connected/etc TCP socket using Linux kernel facility i.e using
one of /proc entries.
</p>

<p>
Do any of you recall which /proc (or /sys maybe?) entry that does the job?
</p>

Thanks in advance..

<h3>how to unmount stale NFS connection</h3>

<p>
Hi all
</p>

<p>
Following my recent question regarding how to close tcp connection, it
turns out that in my case, the sockets belong to stale NFS connection.
In other words, the client try to maintain a mount toward a server
that no longer exist.
</p>

<p>
So, how to unmount it? If you use the usual umount or umount.nfs, you
can't do it and it will yield error messages like below:
$ sudo umount.nfs /media/nfs -f -v
umount.nfs: Server failed to unmount '192.168.1.2:/opt/data'
umount2: Device or resource busy
umount.nfs: /media/nfs: device is busy
</p>

<p>
Thanks to Google, I came to this URL
<a href='http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/Networking/HOW_TO_Unmounting_a_NFS_mount_on_a_server_when_the_mounted_server_has_gone_down_causing_the_applications_thre'>http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answ[...]_gone_down_causing_the_applications_thre</a>
(hopefully I paste the entire URL correctly).
</p>

<p>
Essentially, the trick is to "emulate" the dead NFS server. Bring up a
virtual interface such as eth0:0 and assign it the IP address of the
dead server:
# ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.0
# ifconfig et0:0 up
</p>

<p>
Then retry the umount or umount.nfs command. It takes times, but
eventually it will succeed. Finally, bring down the virtual interface:
# ifconfig eth0:0 down
</p>

<p>
PS: Big credits to Rahul K. who share this valuable information.

Hello,
</p>

<p>
In the context of remote access to mail,
On Mon, 19 Apr 2010, Kat Tanaka Okopnik wrote:
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I tried running a screen session locally, and then ssh to where my
&gt; mail lives, but that resulted in some keystrokes getting interpreted in
&gt; ways that I didn't like (e.g. the backspace key becomes something else,
&gt; IOW not backspacing). This is probably a whole different question that
&gt; should go under another subject line...
</pre>

<p>
So I thought I should try to put together some thoughts on remote
usage of mail. Since this has nothing to do with the original
question, I have broken the thread.
</p>

<pre>
Case 1: Remote system only allows webmail access
------------------------------------------------
</pre>
This is unfortunately all too common nowadays. Possible solutions:
</p>

<pre>
 1. Live with it/abandon it entirely
 2. If forwarding is allowed, then forward your mail to a "better"
 server.
 3. "freepops" may work for you. This is a program that acts as a
 POP3 front-end to a number of webmail interfaces.
</pre>

<pre>
Case 2: Remote system only allows IMAP/POP access
-------------------------------------------------
</pre>
This is slightly more common, yet often sub-optimal!
<pre>
 1. Setup your favourite mail client to access imap/pop.
 2. Use one of the many programs that fetches mail from such servers.
</pre>
Each of these has its own problems. In the first case, you do not get
offline access to your mail, while in the second case you might end
up paying a lot to download an attachment that you did not really
need to access right away.
</p>

<pre>
Case 3: Remote system allows shell access
-----------------------------------------
</pre>
This is the best case scenario that is increasingly scarce!
<pre>
 1. Login to system and use whatever client is locally available. In
 addition you may want to run this client under "screen" or "dtach"
 in order to re-use sessions in case of lost connections.
 
 2. Filter the mail on the remote system (using procmail and friends)
 to sort out the mail (optionally separating out attachments). Then
 download the mail you really want to read using a number of different
 techniques (rsync, unison, git and others or those mentioned in Case 2).
</pre>
Clearly, Kat was using (Case 3, Para 1).

Hey Gang!
I don't know how many of you use VirtualBox (OSE or otherwise), but I
was wondering if any of you had any cool tricks-of-the trade that
perhaps readers might be able to use.
To start off with, here's one that makes VBox really easy for my mom
to use, a little something I've called the "XP Start Button":
It's essentially an icon on the desktop/menu entry. I've upgraded her
laptop to find that she's never ever had a need to boot up windows,
but unfortunately the tax guy wants her to run windows specific
software.
Anyways, here's the tip:
Create a .desktop file in a folder/desktop, and fill it with the following:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Name[en_US]=Windows XP
Exec=VirtualBox --startvm "Windows XP"
Name=Windows XP
</pre>

<p>
Of course, replacing the name of the virtual machine with the one you
wish to start on opening of the .desktop file.
</p>

<p>
Hope to hear more tips, wonder what tweaks i might learn <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Hi Ken,
</p>


<p>
Great article. And you sound like a beautiful person.
</p>

<p>
But enough of this man love.
</p>


<p>
Re melons. Someone of the medical persuasion taught me that the way to
pick melons is to percuss them (see
<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_%28medicine%29'>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_%28medicine%29</a>). I am not
myself medically inclined, but I have applied this process for several
years. To use your metaphor, I certainly do not bat 1.000. I couldn't
tell you for sure how well I bat, but I'd guess up around .7 (I won't
dignify it with 3 decimal places since it could be .6). But I am
quietly confident that I bat much better these days than I used to.
</p>

<p>
I never bring home concrete blocks; the ones I bring home taste from
ok to excellent.
</p>


<p>
On the subject of HeliOS, I probably could not be further from Central
Texas. Your project captures my imagination, but at this distance I
can only offer moral support.
</p>


<p>
I have some ideas related to picking candidates for Linux conversion,
based on points raised in your article. I realise that I do not have a
complete understanding of the environment in which you find yourself,
but I respectfully offer these as possibly useful, perhaps with some
adaptation.
</p>

<p>
We all have an investment in what we know. You said it yourself:
"People get used to doing things one way." I'm writing this on a new
platform (second-hand hardware). I got fed up with Fedora when I
discovered that F10 needed a minimum of 512MB of RAM. I have a Redhat
8 firewall which until recently was running just fine on a 24MB
Pentium 1 100. So I've installed FreeBSD. My /History file indicates
that I started installing 17 January 2010. While I was building I
still had my old Fedora machine. Eventually (16 March 2010), I decided
to bite the bullet and move to FreeBSD.
</p>

<p>
But I'm stilling running my old Fedora machine. I've got at least a
dozen xterm sessions SSHed into it. I keep discovering things I want
to be able to do, things I can do on the Fedora box that I can't yet
do on my FreeBSD box. Gradually I am installing the software I need.
</p>

<p>
And, boy, am I glad that I had the safety net. Recently, I rebooted my
FreeBSD machine because I'd installed quite a lot of software and I
wanted to be sure it would still work after a reboot - and it didn't!
In the event, it was only off the air for a day. But I know that from
the perspective of today looking backwards. Faced with a machine hung
somewhere in the boot process, my first reaction was panic. And
terror.
</p>

<p>
Further, without the ability to fallback to my other machine, I would
not have been able to get onto the forums which eventually gave me a
pointer about how to work around my problem.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps some of the prospects for conversion to Linux need the safety
net of being able to go back to the familiar environment of Windows
until they can be weaned off.

Hi Gang,
</p>


<p>
In his article, "Words, Words, Words", Rick complained about
</p>

<p>
	"Levitz is having a sale at their Oakland warehouse."
</p>

<p>
I was going to write explaining Rick's objection. But that would be
naughty. Instead, I'll explain mine.
</p>

<p>
The sentence uses number inconsistently.
</p>

<p>
I don't care if "Levitz" is singular or plural - so long as it is only
one, not both - especially within a single sentence. It defies logic
for an entity to be simultaneously singular and plural.
</p>

<p>
So, I'm ok with either of these:
</p>

<p>
	"Levitz is having a sale at its Oakland warehouse."
	"Levitz are having a sale at their Oakland warehouse."
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
Henry
</p>

<p>
What is a better way to reboot your system in case it hangs? I mean
rather than three finger salute or kicking the power switch? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Let's assume you have enable the magic SysRq before. Make sure this
feature is compiled in the kernel (CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ) and you enable
it (echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq). Then when the disaster strike,
you can try pressing these key combos in the following order:
1. Alt-SyRq-s (sync the buffer with the disk)
2. Alt-SysRq-u (remount all filesystem as read-only)
3. Alt-SysRq-e (kill all tasks, except init)
4. Alt-SysRq-b (finally, reboot system)
</p>

<p>
If your keyboard doesn't have SysRq, use PrintScreen instead. The way
I do it is like this: press alt, hold, press sysrq, hold, then press s
(or other key), then release them all. You might also try, press alt,
hold, press sysrq, release it, press s or other key, release all.
</p>

<p>
In most cases, the above sequence could reboot your system better. But
if not, just fall back to the "traditional" one <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Reference: sysrq.txt in Documentation directory inside kernel source
code's tree.

----- Forwarded message from Henry Grebler &lt;henrygrebler at optusnet.com.au&gt; -----
</p>

<p>
I was writing an article. I needed more than words; I needed screen
shots. Over the years, I've done this in different ways. Of late, I've
used ImageMagick(1) for this sort of work, in particular, 
</p>

<p>
	import  -  saves any visible window on an X server and outputs
	it as an image file. You can capture a single window, the
	entire screen, or any rectangular portion of the screen.
</p>

<p>
I was capturing parts of web pages. Then I came to a roadblock. I
clicked on a button and it produced a drop-down list. I wanted to
capture the contents of the drop-down list. But, some drop-down lists
are unfriendly. For example, in Firefox, if I click on File, the usual
drop-down list appears, but now my keyboard is deactivated. I also
lose most mouse functions, except for moving the cursor. And, if I
click anywhere, the drop-down list disappears.
</p>

<p>
So how to take the screen shot?
</p>

<p>
I started up a vncserver and a vncviewer (client); and then invoked
Firefox inside the VNC client. 
</p>

<p>
Click on File, move the cursor out of the VNC client, and, voila - I
can now use import to take a screen shot of the menu of the Firefox
running in vncviewer.
</p>

<h2>News in General</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Utah Jury Confirms Novell Owns Unix Copyrights</h3>
<p>At the end of March, the jury for the District Court of Utah trial 
between SCO Group and Novell issued a verdict determining the 
ownership of important Unix copyrights.</p>

<p>The jury's decision confirmed Novell's ownership of the Unix 
copyrights, which SCO had asserted to own in its attack on Linux. 
Novell stated that it remains committed to promoting Linux, including 
by defending Linux on the intellectual property front.</p>

<p>Ron Hovsepian, Novell president and CEO, said "This decision is good 
news for Novell, for Linux, and for the open source community. We have 
long contended that this effort against Linux has no foundation, and 
we are pleased that the jury, in a unanimous decision, agrees. I am 
proud of Novell's role in protecting the best interests of Linux and 
the open source community."</p>

<p>SCO is reported as currently weighing an appeal and it may also 
continue its related lawsuit against IBM for both Unix infringement 
and some contract conflicts.</p>

<p>There is a little more on the tail end of this saga.  From 
<a href="http://www.groklaw.com">http://www.groklaw.com</a>:</p>

<p>"The SCO bankruptcy hearing on the sale of the Java patent will be on 
April 20. That's this proposed sale to Liberty Lane for $100,000, and 
that's an LLC affiliated with Allied Security Trust, the 
anti-patent-trolls company, if you've dropped a stitch and can't keep 
up as SCO's assets get sold off bit by bit. If anyone else has bid, 
other than Liberty Lane, then there would be an auction on the 19th, 
but SCO told the court they don't expect that to happen."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">HP ranked 10th in FORTUNE 500 List</h3>
<p>HP has entered the coveted top 10 category of the Fortune 500 list.</p>

<p>IBM came in at 20th, Microsoft at 36th, Dell at 38th, and Apple 56th, 
just ahead of Cisco at 58th.  Amazon.com was 100th with $24 B in 
revenue.  Oracle was 105th at $23 B, but Sun was separately listed at 
204th with 11 B in revenue.  Combined with Sun's revenue, the new 
Oracle would be competing with Apple and Cisco for their rankings in 
the mid-50s of the list.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Gnome and KDE will co-host 2011 Dev Conference</h3>

<p>Following the successful Gran Canaria Desktop Summit in 2009, the 
GNOME Foundation and KDE e.V. Boards have decided to co-locate their 
flagship conferences once again in 2011, and are taking bids to host 
the combined event.  Desktop Summit 2011 plans to be the largest free 
desktop software event ever.</p>

<p>In July of 2009, the GNOME and KDE communities came together for the 
Gran Canaria Desktop Summit, the first co-located KDE/GNOME event. It 
was a major success and an opportunity for the leaders of the free 
software desktop efforts to communicate on common issues and attend 
combined social events. The attendees from both projects expressed 
great interest in repeating the event and merging the programs to 
synchronize schedules and make the event an even greater opportunity 
for the KDE and GNOME teams to learn from each other and work 
together.</p>

<p>"The Gran Canaria Desktop Summit was a great first event," said 
Vincent Untz, GNOME Foundation Board Member. "We enjoyed working with 
our KDE friends at GCDS in 2009, and want to increase our cooperation 
in 2011. We plan to go beyond simple co-location this time, and 
actually plan a combined schedule in 2011 so that KDE and GNOME 
contributors have every opportunity to work with and learn from each 
other."</p>

<p>The GNOME and KDE projects will hold independent events in 2010. 
GUADEC, the GNOME Project's annual conference, will be held in The 
Hague, Netherlands on July 24 through July 30 of this year. KDE's 
Akademy will be located in Tampere, Finland from July 3 to 10 this 
year. Both groups will likely hold smaller sprints through 2010 and 
early 2011 to prepare for the combined 2011 Desktop Summit.</p>

<p>"The KDE e.V. board felt that GCDS was a fantastic event, and we 
learned what works well and what can be improved when co-hosting an 
event with our GNOME friends," said Cornelius Schumacher of the KDE 
e.V.</p>

<p>More than 850 contributors to the GNOME and KDE projects gathered in 
Gran Canaria last July. The event brought together attendees from 50 
countries, and helped raise local awareness of free software and had a 
measurable impact on the local community. The impact of the event 
continues with nearly 2 million hits to the summit Web site following 
the event.</p>

<p>The projects are seeking a host in Europe at a location that can 
handle more than 1,000 participants. For detailed requirements, 
prospective hosts can see the requirements for Akademy 
(<a href="http://ev.kde.org/akademy/requirements.php">http://ev.kde.org/akademy/requirements.php</a>) and GUADEC 
(<a href="http://live.gnome.org/GuadecPlanningHowTo/CheckList">http://live.gnome.org/GuadecPlanningHowTo/CheckList</a>). Applications 
are welcome before May 15th, and should be sent to the KDE e.V. 
(kde-ev-board@kde.org) and the GNOME Foundation (board@gnome.org) 
boards.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu 10.04 Long Term Support (LTS) Server Reaches for the Clouds</h3>
<p>Canonical has released Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition with extended 
security and maintenance updates free of charge to all users for five 
years (versus 18 months for a standard release). The third and latest 
LTS version of the popular Linux desktop distribution, Ubuntu 10.04 
LTS delivers on the standing commitment to release a version of Ubuntu 
every two years and builds on the success of Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. It has 
been available for free download since April 29th.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 10.04 extends the cloud-computing capability of Ubuntu 
Enterprise Cloud with Eucalyptus - a technology that is becoming 
widely used as a basis for building private clouds. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 
also includes 20 major packages added or updated since the previous 
LTS release, giving new and upgrading users a wide range of 
applications that can be easily installed at launch.</p>

<p>Over 75 organizations have signaled their intent to certify 
applications on the platform including Alfresco, Ingres, IBM, VMware, 
Zimbra, Yahoo and many others with more expected to follow 
post-launch. Dell has announced its intention to support Ubuntu 10.04 
LTS Server Edition and will offer Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud as an option 
on their PowerEdge-C  product line - servers specifically designed for 
building cloud environments. Intel has also been assessing Ubuntu 
Enterprise Cloud and jointly published a white-paper with Canonical on 
how to best deploy the technology on Intel's latest Xeon processors. </p>

<p>New features in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition:</p>

    <p>* Direct upgrade path for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and Ubuntu 9.10 users;</p>
    <p>* Stability and security enhancements for LTS including:<br />
-- Five years of security and maintenance updates free to all 
	  users;<br />
-- AppArmor security by default on key packages;<br />
-- Kernel hardening (memory protection, module loading 
	  blocking, address space layout randomization);<br />
-- Encrypted Home and Private directories;</p>

    <p>* Virtualization enhancements including:<br />
-- KVM now support KSM memory aggregation and live migration 
	  of virtual machines;<br />
-- Automated and fast image creations with VMBuilder;<br />
-- Ubuntu as a Virtual Machine (VM) now supported for VMWare, 
Xen, KVM, Virtualbox, EC2 and UEC;</p>
    <p>* Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud (UEC) and Amazon EC2 enhancements 
    including:<br />
-- EC2 and UEC images are included in five years of free 
	  security and support updates;<br />

	  flexibility using cloud-init;<br />
-- Puppet configuration management framework can be used to 
	  mass control instances from their start. </p>

    <p>* Advanced storage capabilities, including Raid and iSCSI and 
    multipath support;</p>
    <p>* Simpler to mass deploy and manage:<br />
-- Puppet integration from the installer and in the cloud.<br />
-- Version control changes (integrated with Puppet) provides 
	  history and accountability.<br />
-- Many new and improved installation profiles.</p> 


<p>Linux Gazette spoke with Nick Barcet, Ubuntu Server Product Manager, 
and Gerry Carr, Platform Marketing Manager, just before 10.4 was 
released.</p>

<p>Carr said that this was the third release of Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud 
(UEC) and first on an LTS release.  "This is a significant upgrade," 
Carr told LG. "This is well-positioned to take us toward more 
mission-critical deployments in the data center."</p>

<p>"This release will also show a significant shift in ISP support,"  
Carr said,  "We expect about 75 ISVs will declare support for 10.04 
Server when released and more will follow.  ...This is more than 
doubling the number of ISVs supporting Ubuntu." </p>

<p>Barcet explained that many IT depts are experimenting with Cloud 
architectures and seem to considering UEC in hybrid public and private 
architectures. There are now about 200 UEC deployments a day and these 
are approaching 11,000 total deployments, he said.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 10.10 is scheduled for release in October and Ubuntu 11 is 
scheduled for the Spring of 2011.  The next LTS release will be in 
2012.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Server Edition, including Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud, is 
widely available for free download from <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">http://www.ubuntu.com</a>  Users 
can upgrade directly to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS from the previous Ubuntu 8.04 
LTS version as well as the Ubuntu 9.10 release.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop has a new look and social network ties</h3>
<p>The new desktop edition of Ubuntu 10.04 LTS will feature extensive 
design work, a nimbler UI, faster boot speed, social network 
integration, online services and the Ubuntu One Music Store.</p>
 
<p>Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop also includes three years of support through 
free security and maintenance updates.</p>
 
<p>"Ubuntu 10.04 LTS challenges the perceptions of the Linux desktop, 
bringing a whole new category of users to the world of Ubuntu," said 
Jane Silber, CEO, Canonical. "Changes like the new look and feel and 
the addition of a music store, layered on top of our relentless focus 
on delivering an intuitive and attractive user experience for new and 
existing Ubuntu users -- these are the bridging elements to the 
mainstream market that our community, our partners and our users 
really want. Long-term support makes Ubuntu 10.04 LTS very attractive 
to corporate IT as well." </p>
 

<p>New in 10.04 LTS:</p>

<p>* Boot speed: Noticeably quicker on almost any machine.<br />
* Social from the start: The new 'Me Menu' in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 
  consolidates the process of accessing and updating social 
  networks including Facebook, Digg, Twitter and Identi.ca. The Me 
  Menu also integrates chat channels.<br />
* Ubuntu One: Enhanced desktop integration for the online service 
  means files and folders and bookmarks can be shared and saved on 
  the cloud more easily.<br />
* Ubuntu One Music Store: Music from the world's largest labels 
  and greatest bands available direct to Ubuntu users through the 
  default music player. Purchase tracks, store in Ubuntu One and 
  share DRM-free music from one location across multiple computers 
  and devices.<br />
* Ubuntu Software Centre 2.0: An easy way to find new software, 
  and keep track of it once it's installed.<br />
* Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Edition (UNE): As well as benefiting from 
  the improvements in the Desktop Edition, netbook users will see 
  even faster boot speeds on SSD-based devices, and faster 
  suspend/resume that will extend battery life.</p>

<p>Ubuntu 10.04 LTS Desktop Edition and Ubuntu 10.04 Netbook Edition are 
entirely free of charge and are available for download from 
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">http://www.ubuntu.com</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Fedora 13 "Goddard" Beta aims to be a rocket</h3>

<p>The Beta release of Fedora 13 (codename "Goddard") blasted off 
mid-April, named for scientist and liquid-fuel rocketry pioneer Robert 
Goddard. Only critical bug fixes will be pushed as updates for the 
general release of Fedora 13, scheduled to be released in the middle 
of May.</p>
 
<p>The available Live images make it easy to try out Fedora - if you 
write one to a USB key, you can add personal data and your favorite 
applications as you go.</p>

<p>Here are some of the changes that are propelling the Fedora 13 Beta:</p>

<p>* The goal in Goddard is to automate some of the hardware and 
software tasks that help users get their work done. When the user 
plugs in a USB or parallel port printer, inserts a specialized CD 
such as collections of music files as opposed to a standard audio 
CD, or downloads or opens an archive file, using powerful back end 
desktop technologies, PackageKit is designed to detect the user's 
action and offer to install software helpers. </p>

<p>* The Fedora 13 Beta allows developers to install and try a 
parallel-installable Python 3 stack for the first time. This 
feature allows developers to write and test code using either the 
current Python 2.6 or the next-generation Python 3 language.</p>

<p>* There are new functions in Fedora 13 Beta for the GNU debugger, 
gdb, that allow it to deliver unified information for C/C++ 
libraries and Python in the same running process. Programmers who 
are writing Python code that wraps or calls C/C++ functions to 
enhance performance and rapid development can now more quickly and 
efficiently detect and debug problems in their code using this 
work.</p>

<p>* System administrators can also try out some of the advanced file 
system improvements in Fedora 13 Beta. New features in the btrfs 
file system allow for rollbacks of entire file system states, 
making application testing and system recovery more powerful than 
ever. </p>

<p>* During its development cycle, Fedora 13 also featured for the 
first time an installable version of Zarafa, a drop-in groupware 
replacement for Exchange with full featured email, calendaring, 
and other collaboration tools for use by both Linux and Microsoft 
clients. A usable and familiar Web interface for users, and 
support for POP/IMAP and other protocols, is included along with 
tools for integration with existing Linux services.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Mepis antiX 8.5 Released</h3>
<p>April saw the release of antiX MEPIS 8.5, a lightweight MEPIS variant 
designed for older computers. Nine months after the release of antiX 
M8.2, antiX MEPIS 8.5 - a fast, light, flexible and complete desktop 
and live CD based on SimplyMEPIS and Debian 'testing' - is now 
available in full and base versions.</p>

<p>This release defaults to a fully customised IceWM desktop (Fluxbox, 
wmii and dwm are also installed) using a SimplyMEPIS 2.6.32 kernel, 
tweaked MEPIS Assistants for better compatibility in antiX and a range 
of applications for desktop use, including Iceape for Internet needs, 
AbiWord and Gnumeric for office use, XMMS and Google's music manager 
for audio, gxine, MPlayer and GNOME MPlayer for video.</p>

<p>This antiX release works on computers with as little as 64 MB RAM, 
though 128MB RAM is the recommended minimum, and the 486 kernel 
version should work on AMD K5/K6.</p>

<p>Download antiX 8.5 here:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">GNOME Project Updates Free Desktop with 2.30 Release</h3>
<p>On March 31st, the GNOME Project celebrated the release of GNOME 2.30, 
the latest version of the popular, multi-platform free desktop 
environment and developer platform. Released on schedule, GNOME 2.30 
builds on top of a long series of successful six month releases, 
including enhancements for user management, Web browsing, support for 
Facebook chat, and new productivity features.</p>

<p>GNOME 2.30 also marks the last major release in the GNOME 2.x era. 
There will be maintenance releases for 2.30, but the community now 
focuses its efforts on GNOME 3.0.</p>

<p>The 2.30 release contains significant user-visible improvements, 
adding numerous platform improvements for developers, and builds 
towards the upcoming GNOME 3.0 release with a preview of the 
revolutionary GNOME Shell. GNOME Shell, which will replace the
existing GNOME Panel, changes the way users will interact with the 
desktop. </p>

<p>Also, this release includes a number of improvements in GNOME's Orca 
Screen Reader that improve performance and use on netbooks, and 
platform improvements to ready GNOME's Accessibility interface for 
GNOME 3.0. The 2.30 release also delivers comprehensive
support for more than 50 languages, and partial support for many 
others.</p>

<p>"I'm really pleased with all of the updates in GNOME 2.30," said 
Stormy Peters, GNOME Executive Director. "I'm excited that I can 
automatically sync my Tomboy notes between my desktop and laptop 
computer, easily configure Facebook chat in Empathy instant messenger, 
and do more with PDFs in Evince. GNOME 2.30 provides everything I need 
for work and play."</p>

<p>GNOME 2.30 includes updates to Nautilus, the GNOME File Manager, 
including a new split view mode and is now set to browser mode by 
default, replacing spatial mode. </p>

<p>GNOME System Tools now works with PolicyKit for authentication, 
removing the Unlock button for managing users and services. The 
dialogue to create a user has been improved and only requires you to 
provide a the new user's name and will include user name suggestions. 
Upon account creation everything will "just work". This also includes 
support for encrypted home directories.</p>

<p>Vinagre, a remote desktop client for the GNOME Desktop, can now access 
to a remote machine more securely through an SSH tunnel. This needs an 
SSH account on the remote client.</p>

<p>Connecting to clients using a low bandwidth connection is eased by 
allowing you to choose a lower depth of colour to save bandwidth and 
by enabling JPEG compression. These options are available in the 
connection dialogue in Vinagre. </p>

<p>You'll find detailed information about GNOME 2.30 in the release 
notes: <a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.30/">http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.30/</a>.</p>

<h1>Away Mission - Upcoming in May: Citrix Synergy and Google IO</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>
This year, Synergy plays in San Francisco, in the neighborhood of Silicon
Valley and both VMware and Oracle (and also formerly independent Sun
Microsystems.) Last year it was in Vegas, with keynotes available via Web
streaming.
</p>

<p>
Synergy has become a new Virtualization destination since Citrix acquired
the primary sponsorship of the Xen virtuallization platform from XenSource,
Inc, in October 2007.  It is also slowly developing Open Source tendrils.
</p>

<p>
It was only last year, a few months after Synergy 2009, that Simon Crosby,
Citrix's CTO of Virtualization and Management, said, "XenServer is 100%
free, and also shortly fully open sourced. There is no revenue from it at
all." A further shift in the direction of Open Source is expected at
May's event.
</p>

<p>
Synergy will also offer sessions on VDI - virtual desktop infrastructure.
This seems follow along with Cloud Computing and the new internet-based
terminal devices: smart phones and netbooks. We may be seeing the
re-invention of the Mainframe.
</p>   

<p>
If you’ve attended a previous Synergy conference, you’re entitled to a
discount of $600 off the regular registration price. That would be only
$1,295 and there is no deadline on that price. Other discounts are based on
early registration.
</p>

<p>
At the Synergy Testing Center you can take a Citrix exam of your choice for
free.  This can help you pursue a Citrix Certification, including the CCEE
and CCIA for Virtualization. The A15 and A16 beta exams are now available
exclusively to Synergy San Francisco attendees.
</p> 

<p>
Citrix Synergy-SF May 12-14, 2010. San Francisco, CA<br>
<a href="http://www.citrix.com/lang/English/events.asp">http://www.citrix.com/lang/English/events.asp</a>
</p>

<p>
I would also recommend Google I/O 2010; unfortunately, it is closed to
new registrations. It filled up within 2 or 3 weeks of registration
opening.
</p> 

<p>
The 2010 web developer conference has expanded to include a BootCamp day
before the main event, but you have to be already registered for Google IO
to gain entrance to the BootCamp.  These sessions assume you have no
experience working with Google technologies and will be lead by Google
developers.
</p>

<p>
Google I/O features 80 sessions, more than 3,000 developers, and over 100
demonstrations from developers showcasing their technologies.
</p>

<p>
The word must have gotten out that, besides a well organized conference and
great grub, Google bestowed unlocked G-phones on all developer attendees
last year. That's a big perk and some of these showed on eBay for over
$500 each. Which meant several attendees got their fees covered
because...
</p>

<p>
The cost last year and this year was fairly amazing.  Early bird
registration fees was $400 USD through April 16th, 2010. If there were
space available after April 16th they would have been $500 USD. The
Academia (students, professors, faculty/staff) registration fee was $100
USD.  Such a bargain!
</p>

<p>
Of course, with the Iceland eruptions, some Euro guests may have to cancel.
Send inquiries to googio2010@gmail.com and follow on twitter @googleio.

<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>
If a doctor or an electrician came to your house empty-handed, you'd
be a bit bemused, right? (I suppose, these days, if a doctor came to
your house, you'd be astonished! But let's not get side-tracked.) You
expect the professional and the tradesman to come with tools. How else
is she going to do her job?
</p>

<p>
Yet, in the computer industry, people show up on their first day at
work in a suit. And that's it. And, sometimes, not in a suit.
</p>

<p>
Strangely, not only are we not expected to bring our own tools, often
the very idea of computer people relying on tools is considered a
deficiency, a weakness. <i>What?! You look phone numbers up in a
directory! What a wuss! A real sysadmin would just memorise the phone
book!</i>
</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>
I do not come to work empty-handed; I come with a large toolkit. Most
of what I know fits into several classes. It also fits on a CD.
</p>

<p>
These are the components of my toolkit:
</p>

<ol>
<a name="HAL"></a>
<li>HAL - Henry Abstraction Layer</li>
<li>Muscle memory</li>
<li>Help System</li>
<li>History files</li>
</ol>

<p>
This article is about the third of these.
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>
Someone comes to me and asks, "What do you know about SAN, Henry?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," I reply. "Let's have a look."
</p>

<pre class="code">
	help san
</pre>

<p>
I am presented with help on the <strong>San</strong>dringham train timetable and
nui<strong>san</strong>ce calls, in addition to quite a lot of practical information on
SAN accumulated over many years.
</p>

<p>
My <tt>help</tt> command is analogous to something which is a cross
between <tt>apropos</tt> and some implementations of <tt>man</tt>. It
has the wildcarding properties of <tt>apropos</tt>, but gives full
answers like <tt>man</tt> rather than the headings returned by
<tt>apropos</tt>.
</p>

<p>
It's different from <tt>man</tt> and complementary. <tt>man</tt>
contains reference information; the information returned by
<tt>help</tt> is more like what you might find in a HOWTO or a
quick-start guide. <tt>man</tt> tends to contain complete information
on a topic; the information returned by <tt>help</tt> is often
fragmentary, incomplete and very basic.
</p>

<p>
Unlike <tt>man</tt> which is purely technical and only for the machine
I'm on, <tt>help</tt> is not restricted to a single platform; nor is
it restricted to technical matters. People who know me might be
shocked to learn that I have help on Microsoft offerings. I also have
help on how to use my bank accounts.
</p>


<h3>Invoking help</h3>


<p>
To use my help command, I type

<pre class="code">
	help string
</pre>

where <strong>string</strong> is any string which I think might be
relevant. For example,

<pre class="code">
	help rpm
</pre>

should give me help on <tt>rpm</tt>.
</p>

<h3>My <tt>help</tt> directory</h3>

<p>
My <tt>help</tt> directory is <strong>$HOME/help</strong>. I was not
very consistent at first. Arguably, I'm still not. From what I can
see, my earliest entry is dated 14 Aug 1992.
</p>

<p>
These days, I work like this. Each entry is a file. Each file that I
want to be able to look up has <strong>help_</strong> as the first
part of its filename. There may have been a reason for this, though,
honestly, I don't recall. Perhaps I thought there could be other
entries (non-text files like PDFs) that I would access some other way.
I also had subdirectories. I guess I did not want them "getting in the
way" when I was looking stuff up (so their names never began with
<strong>help_</strong>). I don't use subdirectories very often these
days; I can't recall the last time I did.
</p>

<p>
There's a subdir called <strong>FIREFOX</strong> which contains some
html files; another called <strong>HTML</strong> which includes
<strong>Quick_HTML_Reference.html</strong>; another called
<strong>fedora-install-guide-en_US</strong>. But these subdirs are on
the periphery of my help system.
</p>

<p>
The main game is the body of <strong>help_*</strong> files.
</p>

<p>
The "rules" are very simple: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>

	Put into the name of the file any keywords that I think I
	might use to find the info at some time in the future.
	Separate with underscores to keep it readable. Keep the entire
	filename in lower case.
</p>
</li>

<li>
	Put into the file any information I want.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>My <tt>help</tt> command</h3>

My <tt>help</tt> command is implemented as a <tt>bash</tt> function
defined in one of my many startup scripts (which form part of my <A
HREF="#HAL">HAL</A>).

<pre class="code">
function help {
# Assume no arg means standard bash help

        if [ "$1" = "" ]
        then
                builtin help
                return
        fi
        echo 'For bash help, use builtin help'

# avoid backup files:   
        (set -x; less `ls ~/help/help_*${1}* | grep -v '~$'`)
        if [ $? -ne 0 ]
        then                    # try for bash help
                builtin help $1
        fi
}
</pre>

<p>
The first few lines deal with the fact that I have appropriated
<tt>bash</tt>'s builtin <tt>help</tt> command. So, if I just type
<strong>help</strong>, I get <tt>bash</tt>'s help.
</p>

<p>
The line with the parentheses does the work. I'll come back to it.
</p>

<p>
The last 4 lines are supposed to help me coexist with <tt>bash</tt>.
In theory, if I don't have help on the subject in my database, maybe I
meant the bash command. In writing this up, I have discovered that
this part doesn't work! This supports somebody's law that every
non-trivial program has bugs.
</p>

<p>
It also supports the notion that something does not have to be perfect
to be extremely useful. "Perfect is the enemy of good", as Ben said
recently.
</p>


<h3>The main command</h3>

<pre class="code">
	less `ls ~/help/help_*${1}* | grep -v '~$'`
</pre>

<p>
Let's start at the inside.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	ls ~/help/help_*${1}*
</pre>

<p>
This lists all files in <strong>~/help</strong>
(ie <strong>$HOME/help</strong>) which start with <strong>help_</strong>
and have the specified string somewhere in the rest of the filename.
</p>

<p>
I use <tt>emacs</tt> as my editor. It creates backup files which have
tilda (<strong>~</strong>) as the last character of the filename. I
don't want to see these backup files; the <tt>grep</tt> removes them
from the list.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>less</tt> command then displays the files left in the list,
sometimes one file, often several.
</p>

<p>
Before I talk about my <tt>less</tt> command, I'll make one more
comment about the line with the parentheses. It starts with
<strong>set -x</strong>. Long ago, when I first met Unix (before Linux
existed, I think), I read somewhere that Unix commands do their work
quietly. That isn't how I like to operate; I like lots of
confirmation: this is what I did, this is the command I used, these
are the files on which I operated.
</p>

<p>
I don't expect others to share my preferences. Those who prefer
silence can omit the <strong>set -x</strong>.
</p>

<h3>My 'less' command</h3>

<p>
Using <tt>less</tt> on several files would be vastly less useful without a
little wrinkle.
</p>

<p>
I prefer to use <tt>less(1)</tt> as my $PAGER. However, standard
<tt>less</tt> needs a little help. I want to be able to move from one
file to the next and back quickly. By default, less uses
<strong>:n</strong> and <strong>:p</strong> for this, but that's 3
keystrokes, and there is no way that 3 keystrokes can achieve what I
want. I guess I could program the function keys to generate
<strong>:n</strong> and <strong>:p</strong>,
but there are issues with that.
</p>

<p>
I prefer to use the LEFTARROW and RIGHTARROW keys. By default, <tt>less</tt>
uses these to mean "scroll horizontally", but I never want to be able
to scroll horizontally in <tt>less</tt>, so I appropriate those keys.
</p>

<p>
I want RIGHTARROW to mean "next file" and LEFTARROW to mean "previous
file".
</p>

<p>
If you want to do things my way, get hold of my
<strong>.lesskey</strong> file and either copy it to your home
directory or use it to edit your own <strong>.lesskey</strong> file -
see <tt>lesskey(1)</tt>. Either way, check what's there: you may not want
everything I have. See below.
</p>

<p>
Then run <strong>lesskey</strong> to compile the
<strong>.lesskey</strong> file into something <tt>less</tt> can use.
</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>
In my view this is a wonderful example of appropriate technology. It's
appropriate when all factors are taken into consideration. The most
important factor is the customer. I designed this to be used by me, no
one else. Of course, "design" is a gross overstatement; the mechanism
grew organically.
</p>

<p>
Most of my interaction with computers is via the command line,
typically running in an <tt>xterm</tt>. Whenever I can, I use
<tt>bash</tt>. That's pretty nearly always: <tt>bash</tt> is the
default shell on Linux (that which we think of as <tt>/bin/sh</tt> is
really <tt>bash</tt>); it is now standard (<tt>/bin/bash</tt>) on
recent versions of Solaris; and is readily available on BSD. When I'm
not typing commands, it's probably because I've invoked <tt>emacs</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Whether I'm in <tt>emacs</tt> or in <tt>bash</tt>, most of the 
commands I use are the same.
</p>

<p>
So, editing a help file involves one of my bread-and-butter
activities; nothing new to learn.
</p>

<p>
Probably the next most common thing I do is use <tt>less</tt> to
browse files. It is my mail reader of choice (unless I absolutely
can't use <tt>less</tt>). Consequently, reading my help files also
involves one of my bread-and-butter activities.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, it's wonderfully portable. I can take the whole <tt>help</tt>
directory (and other stuff) on a CD wherever I go and copy it to local
disk in no time.
</p>

<p>
The system is deliberately as unstructured as possible. There is a
danger that if I make entering information too onerous, I won't do it.
In many organisations, generally helpful information must be entered
in some markup language. If I have to organise my help information at
the time I'm recording it, I'm going to have to suspend doing whatever
task I'm working on. That won't do.
</p>

<p>
Typically, I just swipe and paste text from where I'm working into a
file. I'm just creating aids for myself - the equivalent of rough
notes one might write on a scrap of paper.
</p>

<p>
If, some time later, I return to a help file because I'm working in
the same area, I might clean the information a little. Or not.
</p>

<p>
The major purpose is to save time. If I spend a long time trying to
work out how to do something, I don't want to have to repeat that
exercise in the future.
</p>

<p>
Of course I'm human and fallible. Sometimes I'm so happy that I got
the thing to work, I just jump in and use it; I forget to record
useful information. But, hopefully, I'll catch it next time.
</p>


<h3>Typical use</h3>

<p>
Let's take an example. I've recently moved to FreeBSD. I'm a bit of a
newbie. Let's see what I feel I need to know.
</p>

<pre class="code">
	ls -lat $HOME/help/help_*bsd* | grep -v '~' | cut -c 30-
 3897 Mar 21 07:35 /home/henryg/help/help_freew_bsd_diary
 3030 Mar 19 14:50 /home/henryg/help/help_bsd_build_notes
  100 Mar 19 11:12 /home/henryg/help/help_bsd
  113 Mar 17 16:38 /home/henryg/help/help_bsd_admin
  261 Mar 17 10:37 /home/henryg/help/help_bsd_build
</pre>

<p>
So when I go <strong>help bsd</strong>, the effect is to load the
above 5 files into <tt>less</tt>. Because I can use the left- and
right-arrow keys to navigate from one file to the next, and because
these keys auto-repeat, I can get to any file very quickly. Since I
put this stuff in, it follows that I know what's there (more or less).
The way my brain works these days, I'm much better at recognising and
selecting than I am at recalling.
</p>

<p>
If I'm looking at a file with <tt>less</tt>, and I decide I want to
modify the file in some way, I can simply type <strong>v</strong> and
I'm in <tt>emacs</tt> ready to edit.
</p>

<p>
If all else fails, I can <tt>grep</tt> through the help files since they are
just text files. Or I can list the <tt>help</tt> directory to see if any of the
filenames trigger recognition.
</p>

<p>
This rarely happens, but let's say I'm looking for some info on xxx
and <strong>help xxx</strong> doesn't produce anything useful. I
resort to <tt>grep</tt> and find the info. Why didn't <strong>help
xxx</strong> deliver the relevant file? I realise that I have
"misfiled". For instance, I stored some info in
<strong>help_audio</strong> but I subsequently look for it with
<strong>help sound</strong>. Ok, simple solution:

<pre class="code">
	mv help_audio help_audio_sound
</pre>

I can now find the relevant help by using either string (or a
substring). For instance, either of these commands will deliver the
above file (and possibly others):

<pre class="code">
        help aud
        help soun
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I can "file" some information under a dozen categories (strings)
virtually for free. I simply need to include more items in the name of
the help file.
</p>

<h3>The contents of help files</h3>

<p>
Please remember that the information in a help file is what I believe
will be useful to me at some time in the future. If you are interested
in such a mechanism for yourself, I expect you to put into your help
files the sort of information that you will find useful. That could be
quite different.
</p>

<p>
Just so you get the flavour, here's the first part of
<strong>help_rpm</strong>:
</p>

<pre class="code">
### For complicated stuff see help_rpm2
### For Uninstall see help_rpm_uninstall
------------------------------------------------------------------------

RPM=wxpythongtk-2.4.2.4-1.rhfc2.nr.i386.rpm

rpm --query -p $RPM   -i
rpm --query -p $RPM   -l | cut -d / -f1-3 | uniq | head
rpm --query -p $RPM   -l | wc
rpm --query -p $RPM   -l

# Test Install
#                               rpm -i --test $RPM      # Use the long option
rpm --install --test $RPM
# Really install
#                               rpm -i $RPM             # Use the long option
rpm --install $RPM

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Tough installs for extreme situations:

rpm -i $RPM --force
rpm -i $RPM --nodeps            # Don't check dependencies

</pre>

<p>
Typically, to perform an install, I set the variable
<strong>RPM</strong>, then copy and paste each of the
<tt>rpm</tt> commands into an <tt>xterm</tt>. If I want, I can pretty
much turn my brain off and run on autopilot.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, it saves me a lot of typing; it minimises typos; and
it allows me to concentrate on more global matters, not the mechanics
of an install.
</p>

<p>
One more example: here's help on the string <strong>pub</strong>.
(Yours might tell you about watering holes.) I have two help files
concerned with public transport:
<strong>help_public_transport</strong> and
<strong>help_aaa_public_transport</strong>. I created the first one
first. It has some detailed information on bus routes. It's the one I
usually don't want to see. So, when I created the second file I put
<strong>aaa</strong> at the start of the string so that it will always
show as the first file in <tt>less</tt> (because of the way
<tt>ls</tt> works).
</p>

<p>
When I want to go somewhere by public transport, I visit <A
HREF="http://jp.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/metlink/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en">Viclink
Journey Planner</A>. It's a marvellous resource, but it can be a
little too general at times. To get answers more quickly, it helps to
provide detailed strings, strings that I would never bother to
remember and could probably never type correctly. So my help shows me
the strings I need for the stations I frequent:
</p>

<pre class="code">
Gardenvale Railway Station (Brighton)

Ormond Railway Station (Ormond)
Caulfield Railway Station (Caulfield East)
Malvern Railway Station (Malvern) 
Armadale Railway Station (Armadale) 

Southern Cross Railway Station (Melbourne City) 
Richmond Railway Station (Richmond)
Flinders Street Railway Station (Melbourne City)
Melbourne Central Railway Station (Melbourne City)
</pre>

<p>
I just paste the relevant strings into the form and get answers very
quickly.
</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>
After many years working with one organisation, recently I've been
contracting to different companies. I am just in the process of
working out how I want to handle this. I'm thinking that the stuff I
gather while working at X Corp could go into directory
<strong>help_X_Corp</strong> and the Y Corp stuff could go into
<strong>help_Y_Corp</strong>. I started doing something along these
lines at my last contract.
</p>

<p>
I'm leaning towards formalising this, using a modified form of the
<tt>help</tt> command. The key line is:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	               v
	less `ls ~/help*/help_*${1}* | grep -v '~$'`
	               ^
</pre>

<p>
I've added an extra asterisk to wildcard across ALL <tt>help</tt> directories.
</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>
That's it in a nutshell. Anyone can adapt what I've done to suit
him/herself. That's the beauty of computers and especially open source
software: near infinite flexibility and customisation. It's such a
shame that we waste the power on "look and feel" (skins and themes).
</p>

<p>
"Off the rack" fits most people reasonably well without fitting anyone
perfectly. But anyone can adapt a system like this to suit as closely
as desired - with enough effort.
</p>

<p>
It doesn't matter if you are a computer nerd or a neophyte.
It doesn't really matter what OS you use (though Microsoft makes it
harder). You need an editor and some way to select and display files.
The only difficulty I can see is if your only access is through GUIs,
because then you have to write (or get someone to write) the selection
code (and maybe the display code). I guess the Microsoft way is to
also use the editor (say Wordpad) as the display program. I'm not real
keen on that, but others might prefer it.
</p>

<p>
If I'd wanted that functionality, I could have used <tt>emacs</tt> in place
of <tt>less</tt>. I think I would have lost a lot if I'd done that.
</p>

<h3>Postscript</h3>

I wrote the above a few days ago. The next day, pricked by some of
the points I made, I modified my help command. I've included it in
Resources below.

<h1>Pixie Chronicles: Part 2 Bootable Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<h3>The Story So Far</h3>

<p>
In Part 1, I said that my project was to build a server. However I
glossed over many details. In this part, I propose to examine those
details more closely. I also raised a problem, which I left hanging.
I'll get back to it a bit later.
</p>

<p>
By the end of this set of articles, you should have enough information
to perform your own PXE network install.
</p>

<p>
Now Read On ...
</p>

<h3>Gathering Information</h3>

<p>
Before I install anything, I like to get some idea of what is on the
machine. Does it have enough memory? How big is the hard drive? Will
Linux recognise all the hardware? For this task, nothing could be
better than a Linux which can run off a CD. I have a couple of
versions of Knoppix, a couple of versions of Ubuntu and a Fedora which
fit this bill quite nicely. I'm sure there are others.
</p>

<p>
My preference is for Knoppix. It has one nice capability that does not
seem to be available on Ubuntu: once the machine has booted from the
CD, it is a simple task to configure networking and then start
<tt>sshd</tt> (the SSH daemon). I can then return to my desktop,
<tt>ssh</tt> into the target machine and do everything from the
comfort of "home". "Home" has my favourite keyboard, mouse and screen.
When the target machine is rolled out, I will probably choose to run
it headless, keyboardless and mouseless. However while it is being
built, I connect the smallest, oldest screen, keyboard and mouse I
have lying around They work, but they are not comfortable.
</p>

<p>
I had been given a machine with a single NIC. I inserted a second, a
spare which I'd bought at a swap meet and which was lying around
waiting to be useful.
</p>

<p>
For the network install, I would need the <A
HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address</A> (aka
Ethernet address) of at least one NIC, preferably both. This is
exactly the sort of information that one can easily get if one first
boots a standalone system from CD.
</p>

<p>

There are other uses for bootable Linux (or Live Linux CD). Some
friends and I have developed a very powerful mechanism for cleaning
viruses from Windows machines. When a machine is infected so badly
that the viruses take control before Windows, a bootable Linux CD and
a USB drive can save the day.
</p>

<h3>Investigation</h3>

<p>
And now for the use which is the point of this part. Part 1 ended with
the discovery that I had installed Fedora 10, the target machine had
then rebooted and restarted the install. It had stopped waiting for
clarification about partitioning.
</p>

<p>
Ok, so what state was my target machine in?
</p>

<p>
I booted off the Knoppix CD to look around. What was on the hard
drive? Hmm, nothing. That's a bit disappointing. What about all the
software that I had seen it install? Actually, it was less nothing
than that. The partitioning information had disappeared!
</p>

<p>
I remembered something that had been in the kickstart file. Or thought
I remembered. I decided to check.
</p>

<p>
Here is a <i>huge</i> advantage of using kickstart as opposed to
interactive install. If there is doubt about what responses were
given at install time, with an interactive install one can only rely
on one's memory. And in some cases, only on someone else's memory. I
have oodles of proof that my memory is fallible; and also that many
people have merely human memory. Even if one is assiduous, as I often
am, and one writes down one's responses, that only makes the situation
better; it's still not perfect. But the kickstart file can always be
examined to confirm or disprove a suspicion.
</p>

<p>
I looked at the kickstart file. There was an interesting line:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	clearpart --all --initlabel
</pre>

<p>
Clearly, I hadn't been paying enough attention when I was constructing
the kickstart file. (I'll have more to say about this at another
time.) The line requests that <i>all</i> disks have their partition
tables removed and their labels reinitialised.
</p>

<p>
<i>All</i>?!
</p>

<p>
[Uneasy feeling.] Surely not <i>ALL</i>?! Surely only real hard drives.
</p>

<h3>It's Worse Than I Thought</h3>


<p>
To make my life more comfortable, when I boot off the Knoppix CD, I
usually insert my USB stick as well. Apart from the antivirus stuff,
the USB stick has my environment - my aliases, functions and scripts.
These are my equivalent of a tradesman's tools of trade. With a couple
of commands, I can recreate my personal environment. It also helps to
shield me from the variations between different Unix and Linux systems:
I have created a sort of HAL - Henry Abstraction Layer.
</p>

<p>
I examined my USB stick. All gone! The install had cleared its
partition table. On reflection, that probably occurred on the first
cycle through the install process, and was repeated on the second. A
subtle but hardly comforting distinction.
</p>

<p>
In addition to losing the install, I had lost all the information on
my USB stick!
</p>

<p>
If you've been paying attention, you might have guessed that all is
not lost. In Part 1 I said, "... it's important to be able to recover
from mistakes."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately I am a wizard of not inconsiderable power and I was able
to recreate the partition table on the USB stick.
</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>
I was also able to restore the install on the hard drive. But that's
not where I want to go right now. I want to pick up on the last point
of Part 1.
</p>

<p>
I implied that just changing the kickstart file to not reboot at the
end of the install was short-sighted. Here's why.
</p>

<p>
Making that change certainly stops problems at the end of the install.
But what happens if I turn off the machine for whatever reason and
then turn it back on again? You might say that if I behaved like that
I would be foolish and would deserve what I got. True. But, what if I
turned off the machine and someone else turned it on? I need a robust
solution.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, there ought to be a way to perform the PXE boot just once.
I'm not aware of such a mechanism on my hardware. When one configures
a boot sequence in a BIOS, one usually sets CD before hard drive. If a
bootable CD is in the drive, the machine boots from CD. If not, it
boots from hard drive. And it's true that if there is no network, the
machine will give up on a PXE boot and try the CD and hard drive. But
that doesn't help me. I need the network there for the network
install. I would then have to remember to remove the network before
the next reboot. I have not solved the problem.
</p>

<p>
For my purposes, it would be nice if the PXE boot mechanism required
that the user press a key while the machine was booting. So, when I
first turned on the machine, I would hold the key down and the PXE
boot would take over. Once the PXE sequence had started, I would stop
pressing the key. Now if the machine reboots at the end of the
install, or it is switched on in the usual way, the PXE boot is
bypassed.
</p>

<p>
Dream on. I needed to look elsewhere. I talked to a colleague, Ian,
who pointed me in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
During the PXE boot, the machine downloads the installation
environment and a PXELINUX config file (which is very similar to a
GRUB config file). The PXELINUX config file can be set to simply
proceed; alternatively it can be set to offer the user a number of
choices for how to boot.
</p>

<p>
After some judicious editing, my PXELINUX config file now achieves a
very serviceable compromise. When invoked it presents a <tt>boot:</tt>
prompt. If the user types <strong>b2</strong> (the name of this
machine) within 10 seconds, the kickstart install process is invoked.
There are some other nice options but I'll defer discussing those.
</p>

<p>
If the user presses <tt>Enter</tt> or 10 seconds elapse with no user
input, the machine boots from local hard disk. Now it doesn't matter
how the machine is turned on: the default condition is to boot from
local hard drive. I have to be at the keyboard to start the kickstart
process, but I'm there anyway to turn on the machine. I have to wait
for perhaps a minute for the PXE boot to finish and the <tt>boot:</tt>
prompt to appear. I then enter <strong>b2</strong> to start the
kickstart install - and then I can leave. The rest of the install will
be automatic. If I've requested a reboot at the end of the install,
the machine will perform the PXE boot from the network and after 10
seconds boot off the hard drive. All boxes ticked.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, when I'm satisfied that the machine is set up how I want
it, I can get into the BIOS and turn off the PXE boot.
</p>

<h3>Lessons</h3>

<p>
Amongst its many advantages, a kickstart file provides an audit trail
and reproducibility. It also allows for convenient change management.
</p>

<p>
One can always keep track of changes using documentation, but it
requires more discipline and is more error-prone.
</p>

<p>

Look for robust solutions.
</p>

<p>

Consider many scenarios, not just the one which presented the problem.

<h1>Solving sudokus with GNU Octave (I)</h1>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++ INTRODUCTION ++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="Sec:Introduction"><h2>I. Introduction</h2></a>

<p>
<a href="#ref-octave">GNU Octave</a> is a high level language designed
for science and engineering applications. Easy to learn and simple
to teach, Octave can be used as a sophisticated interactive graphical
calculator. On the other hand, the rich set of data structures (complex
numbers, vectors, matrices, multidimensional arrays, strings, lists,
function handles, cell arrays, ...) and, in particular, the complete
collection of matrix operations and functions give Octave enough punch
to be used in professional applications. From a programmer's point
of view, the interface of Octave functions is superb. Incidentally,
Octave is highly compatible in notation and functionality with <a
href="#ref-matlab">MatLab</a>, a leading instrument in many engineer's
toolbox.
</p>

<p>
The intention of this article is to show the matrix capabilities
of the language by analyzing the solution of arbitrary 9x9 classical <a
href="#ref-sud1">sudokus</a>. A primitive code, combining simple scan and
brute force trial-and-error guessing will be discussed. More advanced solving
techniques will be the subject of a future installment.
</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++ MATRIX OPERATIONS +++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="Sec:MatOp"><h2>II. Matrix operations</h2></a>

<p>
Before going on to the sudoku problem, it may be useful to discuss a few
ideas about the language matrix capabilities. First of all, Octave
matrices can be defined and addressed element by element, but it is far
more efficient to handle them as a whole using the rich set of operations
and functions that the language provides. Compare, for instance, the
following code for defining and multiplying two 100x100 random matrices
element by element:
</p>

<pre class="code">
tstart = cputime;   # Start timing
rand("seed",pi);    # Initialize random number to a known seed
for i = 1:100       # Fill up the two 100x100 random matrices
   for j = 1:100
      A(i,j) = rand();
   endfor
endfor
for i = 1:100
   for j = 1:100
      B(i,j) = rand();
   endfor
endfor
for i = 1:100       # Multiply the matrices
   for j = 1:100
      C(i,j) = 0;
      for k = 1:100
         C(i,j) += A(i,k) * B(k,j);
      endfor
   endfor
endfor
Sum = 0;            # The sum of all elements in C
for i = 1:100
   for j = 1:100
      Sum += C(i,j);
   endfor
endfor
disp(Sum);
tend = cputime() - tstart;
disp(tend);
</pre>

<p>
with the equivalent code using matrices at once
</p>

<pre class="code">
tstart = cputime;   # Start timing
rand("seed",pi);    # Initialize random number to a known seed
A = rand(100);      # Fill up the two 100x100 random matrices
B = rand(100);
C = A * B;          # Multiply the matrices
Sum = sum(sum(C));  # The sum of all elements in C
                    # The inner sum() returns the sum of each column
disp(Sum);
tend = cputime() - tstart;
disp(tend);
</pre>

<p>
The matrix code is shorter, simpler, and some 2500 times faster (0.024
seconds compared to 58.8 seconds, on a typical 2.4 GHz Pentium). The
main reason for this huge CPU time difference lies in the fact Octave is an
interpreted language, so while loops must be parsed, interpreted, and
performed once per cycle, matrix operations are transformed at once into fast
machine code able to exploit the vector capabilities of the CPU.
</p>

<p>
Addressing parts of a matrix is simple with Octave. The i-th row
and the j-th column of <tt>M</tt> are invoked as <tt>M(i,:)</tt> and
<tt>M(:,j)</tt>, respectively; <tt>M(i:i+3,j:j+3)</tt> slices a 4x4
block that starts at the <tt>M(i,j)</tt> element; <tt>M(2:2:,1:2:)</tt>
slices all elements that belong to an even row and an odd column; and
<tt>M(find(M&gt;0))</tt> returns a vector made of all elements in M that
are positive. More matrix magic can be done by using address indices.
</p>

<p>
As a final remark on the specifics of Octave matrices, the
elements are stored in column-major order (i.e. Fortran-like order, with
<tt>M(1,1)</tt> being followed by <tt>M(2,1)</tt>, <tt>M(3,1)</tt>, etc.),
and the starting value for the indices is 1 by default. As a default, a
two-dimensional matrix can also be addressed as a one dimensional vector
but if that appears a little confussing, the <tt>reshape()</tt> function
can be used to explicitly change the matrix dimensions.

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++ A SUDOKU SOLVER +++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="Sec:MatOp"><h2>III. The first sudoku solver</h2></a>

<p>
A classical sudoku is a 9x9 matrix formed by nine 3x3 blocks. The 0-9
digits fill the 81 matrix cells in such a way that each digit appears
exactly once in each row, each column, and each block. In fact,
the name sudoku comes from the Japanese phrase <em>"suuji wa dokushin
ni kagiru" ("the numbers must occur only once"</em>) that was used by the <a
href="http://www.nikoli.co.jp/en/">Nicoli</a> publishing house. Starting
from a blank matrix, there are 6,670,903,752,021,072,936,960 different
possibilities (<a href="#ref-FJ05">Felgenhauer and Jarvis, 2005</a>), that
reduce to 5,472,730,538 unique sequences when all puzzle symmetries are
taken into account (<a href="#ref-RJ2005">Russell and Jarvis, 2005</a>).
The mathematical enumeration becomes an interesting logical mind game when
a few <i>clues</i> or given digits are added at selected places in the
matrix. In the <a href="#ref-jargon">sudoku jargon</a>, a <i>proper
puzzle</i> has a unique solution, whereas a <i>satisfactory puzzle</i> is
proper and can be solved without trial and error.
</p>

<p>
Two different types of methods have been applied in solving sudokus by
computer. The first kind of programs try to follow the same or similar
logical steps that human solvers employ. The second approach is based on a
reformulation of the problem as the minimization of a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_function">penalty function</a>.
The logical way has two appealing advantages for our purposes: it can trace
the reasoning used in a puzzle, and the logical steps can be used to grade
the difficulty from a human point of view.
</p>

<p>
The code to be introduced in this first article is very basic on
purpose. It uses a minimum of logical reasoning, relying heavily on trial
and error guessing. The input/output is also minimalistic. Notwithstanding
its limitations, the code (<tt>sudoku01.m</tt> from now on) is able to
find all possible solutions of a given puzzle entered by the user. Let
me show first the code and go later to discuss its main parts.

but the default, <tt>sudoku.dat</tt>, is used if no arguments are given.
The data file contains the input puzzle in any of three formats:
</p>

<ul>
<li>a 81 character string with zeros for the unknown digits
<pre class="ex">
700000400020070080003008009000500300060020090001007006000300900030040060009001035
</pre>
<li>a string with dots showing the unknown digit positions
<pre class="ex">
7.....4...2..7..8...3..8..9...5..3...6..2..9...1..7..6...3..9...3..4..6...9..1.35
</pre>
<li>or a 9x9 matrix with zeros as the unkowns
<pre class="ex">
7  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
0  2  0  0  6  0  0  3  0
0  0  3  0  0  1  0  0  9
0  0  0  5  0  0  3  0  0
0  7  0  0  2  0  0  4  0
0  0  8  0  0  7  0  0  1
4  0  0  3  0  0  9  0  0

0  0  9  0  0  6  0  0  5
</pre>
</ul>

<p>
The output is managed by the <tt>sudoku_print()</tt> local function,
minimally reduced to a pair of <tt>disp()</tt> calls. The input is handled
by <tt>sudoku_read()</tt>, which uses <tt>argv()</tt> to retrieve the program
arguments, <tt>fgetl()</tt> to read a string, or <tt>load</tt> to read
the matrix format, and the local function <tt>str2digits()</tt> to convert
a string, character by character, into a matrix of digits.

<a name="subSec:IO"><h3>B. Keeping the principal information ready</h3></a>

<p>
The current state of the puzzle is a 9x9 matrix of integer digits, with
zeros filling in the cells yet unknown. This matrix is appropriate for
simple tasks like obtaining the number of unknown cells,
<tt>length(find(sudoku_matrix==0))</tt>, or printing,
<tt>disp(sudoku_matrix)</tt>. Rows, columns, and blocks in the sudoku
matrix are numbered according to <a href="#fig:sudoku008a">figure 1</a>.
</p>

<p id="figure">

   </a>
   <br/>
   <b>Figure 1</b>
   A standard 9x9 sudoku showing how rows, columns, and blocks are
   labelled.
   
</p>

<p>
The analysis of the puzzle is facilitated through the use of three 9x9
logical matrices: <tt>row(,)</tt>, <tt>column(,)</tt>, and
<tt>block(,)</tt>. The three of them have a similar structure and meaning.
For instance, <tt>block(b,)</tt> is a column vector of nine elements that
contain a one (meaning 'true') in the positions that correspond to the digits
already assigned in block <tt>b</tt>, and a zero (meaning 'false') in the
position of the digits that are not yet assigned. So, in the case of the sudoku
shown in <a href="#fig:sudoku008a">figure 1</a>, <tt>block(3,:)</tt> is
<tt>[0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0]</tt> because 3, 4, and 5 are the only digits
already assigned in block number <tt>3</tt>.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>row(,)</tt>, <tt>column(,)</tt>, and <tt>block(,)</tt>
are initially created in the <tt>sudoku_solve()</tt> function, but
they are used and maintained in synchrony with the sudoku matrix in
<tt>sudoku_trial()</tt>, the real core function of the program and the
true puzzle solver.
</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++ THE sudoku_trial FUNCTION +++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="subSec:IO"><h3>C. The <tt>sudoku_trial()</tt> function</h3></a>

<p>
This principal function of the solver is made up of two different
parts. The first part determines the number of digits admissible for
every unknown cell, identifies and fills those cells that have a single
candidate, and repeats this process until no new information is gained
in a complete cycle. The second part then takes an educated guess about
the content of a cell and recursively calls the <tt>sudoku_trial()</tt>
function to check whether the guess produces a correct solution for the
sudoku or gives rise to an impossible situation. Let me describe both
steps in a little more detail.

<!-- ++++++++++++++++++ NAKED SINGLES SCANNING +++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="subSec:IO"><h3>D. Naked singles scanning</h3></a>

<p>
Determining the possible candidates for a cell is simple with the help
of the <tt>row(,)</tt>, <tt>column(,)</tt>, and <tt>block(,)</tt> matrices.
In the case of the cell in row <tt>r</tt> and column <tt>c</tt> that
belongs in block <tt>b</tt>, the logical expression
</p>

<center><pre class="ex">
   row(r,:) | column(c,:) | block(b,:)
</pre></center>

<p>
where <tt>|</tt> is the logical OR operator, produces a vector with
zeros in the position of the digits that still can occupy the cell. The
following table shows the result for the cell <tt>(r = 3, c = 7)</tt> of the
test sudoku in <a href="#fig:sudoku008a">figure 1</a>:

<p>
Two and nine are the two digits still admissible for the cell of the above
example. In general, the outcome of this analysis for any cell gives rise
to three different cases: (a) when there is a single candidate for a cell
we can assign it immediately, taking care of actualizing the state of the
sudoku matrix but also of the <tt>row()</tt>, <tt>column()</tt>, and
<tt>block()</tt> matrices; (b) when there is no admissible candidate, we
have arrived at an impossible state for the puzzle, probably as a result of
an incorrect guess in a trial-and-error search, and the solving routine
must be terminated with an error condition; and (c) when there are two or
more possible candidates. At that point, nothing can be done, but the cell
with the least number of multiple candidates is remembered for the second
part of the routine.
</p>

<p>
The assignment of a value to a cell produces information that directly influences
all cells that belong in the same row, column, or block, and indirectly 
the neighbors of these neighbors. Therefore, the search of single candidate
cells (<b>naked singles</b> or <b>singletons</b> in the parlance of some
sudoku aficionados) must be repeated until no new assignment is done in
a whole cycle. This loop structure will remain similar when more advanced
scanning techniques are introduced in our code.
</p>

<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- ++++++++++++++++++ TRIAL AND ERROR GUESSING +++++++++++++++++ -->
<!-- +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ -->
<a name="subSec:IO"><h3>E. Trial and error guessing</h3></a>

<p>
Eventually, the scan loop arrives at a point where no further
information is gained. This is where guessing takes control. The cell
with the smallest number of candidates has already been identified in
the previous scan phase: <tt>minr</tt>, <tt>minc</tt> and <tt>minb</tt>
are the row, column, and block of this pivotal element, <tt>minpos</tt>
is the number of admissible digits, and <tt>minipos()</tt> is a vector
containing the actual digits.
</p>

<p>
The trial and error step consists of a loop that tries in sequence
all <tt>minipos(1:minpos)</tt> admissible digits for the pivot. The state
of the sudoku before this loop must be conserved so that each candidate
digit starts fresh from the same situation. The puzzle state is then
changed for the new candidate, and control is passed recursively to the
<tt>sudoku_trial()</tt> function for a new turn of scanning plus guessing.
The recursion stops when either a solution is found or an impossible
puzzle state is reached. An infinite recursive loop is not possible
because every new call to <tt>sudoku_trial()</tt> contains at least one
unknown cell fewer than the previous level call.
</p>

<p>
Keeping the puzzle state between alternative candidates is, in fact, a
consequence of the way that parameters are passed to Octave functions. 
Octave function arguments are passed by value, which means that each
argument is evaluated and copied to a variable local only to the function.
Unlike most languages, however, Octave functions can return multiple
values to the calling program block. This behavior is exploited in the
following fragment of our recursive routine:
</p>

<pre class="ex">
function [solved,sudout] = sudoku_trial(sud,row,column,block)
   ...
   for p = 1:minpos
      ...
      row(minr,n) = 1; column(minc,n) = 1; block(minb,n) = 1;
      [res2, sud2] = sudoku_trial(sud,row,column,block);
      row(minr,n) = 0; column(minc,n) = 0; block(minb,n) = 0;
      if (res2) solved=1; sudout=sud2; endif
      ...
   endfor
   ...
endfunction
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>sud()</tt>, <tt>row()</tt>, <tt>column()</tt>, and <tt>block()</tt>
matrices can be changed within the function, with confidence that their
modified value will not be passed back.
</p>

<p>
The naked singles scanning is just the simplest of the several logical
techniques that have been proposed to solve the sudoku puzzles. In
future articles, we will examine how to implement several additional methods:
hidden singles, subset interactions, x- and xy-wings, swordfish, etc. The
final objective is trying to solve as many puzzles as possible using direct
or indirect logical reasoning and avoiding the trial and error step.

To run the code discussed here under MatLab, please change all

Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern

<h1>Open Hardware and the Penguin: using Linux as an Arduino development platform</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/parkin.html">Tom Parkin</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Linux is one of the more scalable Operating Systems in existence
today, equally at home on tiny embedded single-board-computers as it is on
supercomputing clusters.  However there will always be some
computing applications for which Linux doesn't fit; indeed for which any OS at all
is something of an unnecessary overhead.  Devices fitting this niche are
many and varied, ranging from low-powered
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontroller">PIC devices</a>
to more capable microprocessors (such as those based around Intel's venerable
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8051">8051 chip</a>).  Typically
each device or device family comes with its own software stack and development
environment, and until recently, all the options for development at this level
held one thing in common: proprietary designs, and proprietary software.
</p>

<h2>Enter the Arduino</h2>

<p>
This is beginning to change.  Although hardly as vibrant and diverse
as the Open Source software ecosystem, a nascent Open Source hardware movement
is quietly developing open-licensed hardware designs for a wide range of
applications.  At the most fundamental level, the <a href="http://www.opencores.org/">
Open Cores</a> project aims to develop Open Source hardware designs for chips
themselves, ranging from memory controllers to full-blown processor designs.
Moving up a layer of abstraction, projects such as <a href="http://wiki.opengraphics.org/tiki-index.php">
The Open Graphics Project</a> are developing hardware board designs using
off-the-shelf components.  Sitting somewhere inbetween the two, the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">
Arduino</a> project aims to provide a general-purpose microcontroller platform,
integrating an Open Source board design with Open Source software development tools.
</p>

<p>
The Arduino was conceived in 2005 by academics at an Italian design school
who had become frustrated with the paucity of simple, powerful platforms for
their students to use as a base for projects.  In classic open-source style they
decided to build their own, and in a few days of creative hacking the embryonic Arduino was born.
Since then it has grown from being a teaching aid to become rapid prototyping and hobbyist
platform with a global community of users.
</p>

<p>At its heart the Arduino consists
of an 8-bit microcontroller from Atmel's megaAVR range of chips, which is supplemented
with I/O headers and a USB or RS232 connection for uploading of code.  It is
a simple design which retains a shallow learning curve and provides remarkable
flexibility.  Properties which, in conjunction with the open-source licensing of
the device's circuit design and software stack, have led to an impressive diversity
of applications.  Not only are Arduino hackers exploring such 
traditional geek territory as <a href="http://dawson-station.blogspot.com/2010/01/wii-nunchuk-train-control.html">
a Wii-nunchuk controller for a trainset</a>, they're also developing exceedingly practical
projects along the lines of <a href="http://www.stillhq.com/arduino/000003.html">a controller for a beer fridge</a>,
not to mention pushing the boundaries of computer-music creativity with
<a href="http://hacknmod.com/hack/create-techno-with-a-laser-harp/">a laser MIDI "harp"</a>.
</p>

<h2>Arduino development under Linux</h2>

<p>
In keeping with the Arduino's open-source heritage, all of the tools required to develop
Arduino code will run on a Linux platform, and the remainder of this article will provide
a tutorial for getting started with Arduino hacking.
</p>

<p>This tutorial has been tested using a 32-bit <a href="http://crunchbanglinux.org/">Crunchbang Linux</a> system,
which is based on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 9.04.  Where possible the instructions
have been written to be transferable to other distributions with minimal effort.
</p>

<h3>1. Obtain an Arduino board</h3>

<p>
First of all, it is necessary to source the Arduino hardware itself.
Although it is possible to build an Arduino by hand using widely available
components, it is best to buy a pre-built
board from one of the many hobbyist websites which stock them.  This avoids
the need for potentially error-prone soldering or bread-board
assembly at the early stages of Arduino development.  Pre-built Arduino boards
can be sourced from the websites linked from the 
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy">Arduino project's website</a>,
and are relatively cheap.  At the time of writing, the going rate is around
20 GBP or 25 USD.
</p>

<h3>2. Install the development environment</h3>

<p>
Once an Arduino board has been obtained, it is time to create a development
environment on a Linux host PC.  The simplest way to do this is by using the
Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  This is a Java application
which will provide support for source code editing and compilation, binary image
upload to the Arduino, and a serial communications terminal, all within a
single application.
</p>

<h4>2.1 Download the Arduino IDE from the <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino website</a></h4>

<p>
The latest release of the Arduino IDE at the time of writing was version <tt>0018</tt>.
It is recommended that the latest version of the IDE is used. 
</p>

<pre>
    # Create a new directory to store the IDE in
    mkdir arduino
    cd arduino

    # Download the IDE tarball from the web
    wget http://arduino.googlecode.com/files/arduino-0018.tgz

    # Untar the IDE tarball
    tar -xzf arduino-0018.tgz
</pre>

<h4>2.2 Install the necessary supporting packages for the IDE</h4>

<p>
Since the Arduino IDE is a Java program a suitable Java Runtime Environment must
be installed on a host PC.  In addition, the IDE relies on some further
software packages: GCC for code compilation, binutils and libc for the creation
of a runnable image for the Arduino microprocessor, and avrdude for communication
between the host PC and the Arduino board.
</p>

<p>
Super-user privileges will be required to install these software packages on the
host PC: for the purposes of this demonstration, <tt>sudo</tt> is used.
</p>

<pre>
    # Install Sun's JRE
    sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre
   
    # Install the AVR compiler and runtime tools
    sudo aptitude install gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc

    # Install the AVR communications tool
    sudo aptitude install avrdude
</pre>

<h4>2.3 Unprivileged user access to /dev/ttyUSB0</h4>

<p>
Contemporary Arduino boards such as the Duemilanove communicate with the host PC via
a USB-serial connection.  In order to access this device node as a normal user on
the host PC, it may be necessary to add your user to a group with access rights to
the node.
</p>

<pre>
    # First, connect the Arduino board to the host PC via. a USB cable,
    # then check dmesg output on the host PC
    dmesg | grep -i "usb serial"
        [ 1054.569782] USB Serial support registered for generic
        [ 1054.569860] usbserial: USB Serial Driver core
        [ 1054.594282] USB Serial support registered for FTDI USB Serial Device
        [ 1054.594433] ftdi_sio 2-1:1.0: FTDI USB Serial Device converter detected
        [ 1054.594651] usb 2-1: FTDI USB Serial Device converter now attached to ttyUSB0

    # dmesg output suggests that the device is connected to ttyUSB0,
    # so check the access rights on that device node
    ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
        crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 2010-03-09 22:13 /dev/ttyUSB0

    # The group "dialout" has access to /dev/ttyUSB0, so add user "tom" to that group.
    # You should replace "tom" with your own login name, of course!
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout tom
</pre>

<h3>3. Launch the IDE and connect the Arduino board</h3>

<p>
With the supporting software installed and access to the Arduino USB-serial device node
configured, the IDE can be launched:
</p>

<pre>
    cd arduino-0018
    ./arduino
</pre>

<p>
The Arduino Duemilanove board is powered from the USB bus.  All that should be
required to get this up and running is to plug it into your Linux PC, via a USB cable.
</p>

<h3>4. Test your setup with an example project</h3>

<p>
The Arduino IDE is fairly intuitive and easy to use.  To illustrate
the basic procedures required to build and upload code, we'll use a simple demonstration
project which uses the in-build LED on the Arduino Duemilanove board to flash a message
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Morse code</a>.

<p>
There are a couple of points to note about this simple Arduino "sketch" (n.b. a "sketch" is the
Arduino term for a project).  Firstly, although
it looks like C code, perceptive readers will have noticed that it isn't actually a complete
program.  That's because the Arduino IDE provides a lot of basic functionality behind the
scenes, leaving the programmer to focus on the task at hand rather than the intricacies of driving
a given I/O pin high, for example.
</p>

<p>A full reference to the Arduino environment is
<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage">available via the Arduino website</a>.
Essentially it boils down to a library of utility functions (for example <tt>delay()</tt>, which
delays program execution for the specified number of milliseconds), and two callbacks which
the core Arduino code calls to allow a given sketch to do its work.  As shown above, these
callbacks are <tt>setup()</tt> for initial configuration, and <tt>loop()</tt> for the main event loop of the
program.
</p>

<h4>4.2 Create a new Arduino sketch</h4>

<p>
To import this code into the Arduino IDE, launch the IDE then click <tt>File -&gt; New</tt> to create a
new sketch.  Copy and paste the code into the editor window, then save it (<tt>File -&gt; Save</tt>) with a sensible filename.
</p>

<h4>4.3 Configuring the IDE</h4>

<p>Now configure the IDE to talk to your Arduino board.</p>

<p>
First, instruct the IDE to use
the serial port that your Arduino is attached to by clicking <tt>Tools -&gt; Serial Port</tt>
and selecting the serial port that we determined previously (this was /dev/ttyUSB0, in our example).
Depending on your distribution you may need the Arduino to be connected for this port to show up.
</p>

<p>
With that done, set the IDE to compile code for your specific Arduino device by clicking
<tt>Tools -&gt; Board</tt>.
In your author's case the correct choice is <tt>Arduino Duemilanove or Nano w/ATMega328</tt>,
which is the most recent Arduino board at the time of writing.
</p>

<h4>4.4 Compile and run: the moment of truth</h4>

<p>
Finally, to compile and upload the code to the Arduino, click <tt>Sketch -&gt; Verify/Compile</tt>,
and then <tt>File -&gt; Upload to I/O board</tt>.  Simple!
</p>

<p>
If everything has gone according to plan, the Arduino IDE should load the compiled morse
code application to the board.  Look for the <tt>TX</tt> and <tt>RX</tt> lights flashing
on the board to indicate communications in progress.  The board should immediately
run the program.  After a few seconds, the Arduino should start blinking its green LED
to flash a Morse code message.
</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>

At this stage, you should be well on your way to getting to grips with the fundamentals of
Arduino development, and hopefully you'll already be envisaging how you could use the platform
in an exciting new project.

<h3>It's not working!</h3>

As with any computer-related activity, Arduino development has its fair share of pitfalls and
sticking points to negotiate.  Although the IDE and the example code above provide a simple
introduction, once you set out on your own you'll inevitably hit a problem at some point.
Happily the Arduino project provides many avenues for support, including
<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl">the Arduino forums</a> and
<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1199920386">IRC channel</a>.  In addition,
the Arduino and its IDE have been widely blogged about, and a small amount of work with a search engine
will yield a lead on most of the widely-encountered issues.

<h3>What if I don't want to use the IDE?</h3>

<p>
Although the Arduino IDE is a great tool, some developers may wish to use their favourite editor
for generating code instead.  This is made easily possible
using Kimmo Kulovesi's excellent <a href="http://arkku.com/misc/arduino_make.sh">arduino_make.sh</a>
script, which leverages the internal build files used by the IDE to perform the basic
Arduino compilation and upload processes from the commandline. 
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The Open Source Hardware movement is increasingly demonstrating that the power of open
development is not limited to the software domain.  The Arduino project
leverages the best of both Open Source hardware and software to deliver a great multi-purpose microcontroller
platform.  Whether you're a software hacker looking for an easy entry into the world of
embedded devices, a teacher seeking a device to base an electronics course around, or
a seasoned hardware designer looking for a quick prototyping environment, you owe it to
yourself to give the Arduino a look.

<p>
Tom Parkin has been fascinated by the inner workings of digital
 technologies ever since his father brought home a VIC-20 sometime in the
 mid-eighties. Having spent most of his childhood breaking computers in a
 variety of inventive ways he decided to learn how to fix them again, a
 motivation which lead him to undertake an MEng degree in Electronic
 Systems Engineering in 2000. Since graduating he has pursued a career in
 embedded software engineering, and now feels that he has probably been
 responsible for more working computers than broken ones.
</p>

<p>
Tom was introduced to Linux when a friend lent him a thick stack of
 Mandriva installation CDs, and he has been using Open Source software
 ever since. Like most Linux users, Tom has tried many different
 distributions but is currently settled with Fedora at work and
 Crunchbang on his home machine.

<p>
When not tinkering with computers and Linux, Tom enjoys exploring the
 great outdoors on bike or on foot, and making music.

<h1>Hey, Researcher! Open Source Tools For You!</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/saha.html">Amit Kumar Saha</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>

<p>
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br> Your author is writing this article after
having just finished his latest task - conducting numerous experiments
which involved processing a lot of data, and finally writing the paper on
it in just under five days. He wonders how he would do it without some of
the tools he will be talking about in this article, leaving aside the
pleasure of working on Linux systems. His views are biased and are meant to
be taken <em>cum grano salis</em>, but I hope you will give him a fair
chance.
</p>

<h3>What am I addressing in this article?</h3>

<p>
My meeting with Linux happened accidentally 10 years ago, with the fun of
wiping out and putting in a Linux distribution numerous times on my first
computer without having any clue about how to work on it. Finally, after a
lot of such iterations I finally settled in, working on it full
time for the last 5 years. The accident that happened 10 years ago stood me in
good stead both when I was working at a software company and now when I'm
working in a research lab. In a research lab, we need to plot figures, run
batch jobs remotely, perform scientific and numerical computing, and last
but not least, publish results by writing papers. Just a few days before I
wrote to the Editor-in-Chief about this article idea, I helped a Windows
friend draw some plots (fixing them for publication) for her paper,
wondering all the while "Jeez, how do Windows users do it?" Most tools that
I used were primarily for Linux. On Linux, things are so much easier. You
can focus on the real job instead of bothering about setting up your tools.
This article is therefore an unabashed claim about the coolness of working
with these tools while you focus on your research. Some of these tools can
be set up on a non-Linux system too; however, I shall address their usage
on a Linux system only and make no attempt to cover any non-Linux issues.
The primary focus here is to introduce my readers to these tools, and not
to convert them to Linux. <em>It would, in fact, be a good exercise to get
all these tools that I talk about here on Windows!</em>
</p>

<p>
In this article, I shall take a look at (in no particular order) getting up
and on with LaTex, <em>gnuplot</em>, <em>GNU octave</em>, Python scientific
libraries, <em>Beamer</em>, and some other tools and libraries.
</p>

<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Hello Linux</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
Before I start talking about using the scientific tools, I shall write a
few lines about how you can set up a Linux system for yourself - if you
don&rsquo;t already have one, that is. While bare-metal Linux installations
are the best case scenario, it may not always be possible because your
primary work may be on Windows. In such cases, the best solution is to go
for a <em>virtual Linux installation</em>. In my humble opinion, I have
found using <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> to be a
breeze when you need to set up a virtual machine. Just download a Linux
distribution like Ubuntu and install it using VirtualBox. Once you have the
basic installation, take a little time to gain some hands on familiarity
with the terminal, using the package manager to install packages, and using
a text editor.
</p>

<p>
Here are some resources which can help you getting started:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VirtualBox">Ubuntu community
documentation on VirtualBox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/index.html">Documentation for the
latest stable version of Ubuntu</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Giving LaTex a try</h3>

<p>
LaTex is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting and is
widely used for writing scientific papers, technical manuals, and even
creating presentations <em>(more on this later)</em>. <a href= 
"http://www.tug.org/texlive/"><em>TeX Live</em></a> is an easy way to get up
and running with LaTex on your Linux system. A file written in LaTex is
usually saved as a <em>.tex</em> file. Once you have created your
<em>.tex</em> file, you will compile the file using the <em>latex</em>
command, which gives you a <em>dvi</em> file, which you can convert to a PDF
file using a tool like <em>dvipdf</em>. You can also directly get a PDF
output using the tool <em>pdflatex</em>.
</p>

<p>
You can edit LaTex in your text editor of choice. The widely used
<em>VIM</em> and <em>Emacs</em> both support LaTex editing with
syntax-highlighting, code-completion, etc.
</p>

<p>
The best way to get started with LaTex is by getting started. Start your text
editor, type in some Latex and see the results. Here are some great
resources to help you master it:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=
"http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf">The (Not So)
short introduction to LaTex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/">Text
Processing using LaTex</a></li>
<li><a href="http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html">Draw the LaTex
symbol and get the corresponding command</a></li>
</ul>

<!--TOC section gnuplot-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->gnuplot</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
If you are doing experimental work, there is a fair chance that you are
going to present your results in a graphical plot. Please welcome <em>gnuplot</em>.
It is a command-line driven graphing utility for creating 2-dimensional as
well as 3-dimensional graphical plots. It supports output to many file
formats with <em>eps</em> and <em>fig</em> being of special interest to the
researcher. The easiest way to install <em>gnuplot</em> is using the package
manager of you Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple of links to help you get started with
<em>gnuplot</em>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/documentation.html">gnuplot
documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://t16web.lanl.gov/Kawano/gnuplot/index-e.html">gnuplot not

</ul>
<!--TOC subsection Calling <I>gnuplot</I> from your C program-->
<h4><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Calling <em>gnuplot</em> from your C program</h4>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
A cool way to use <em>gnuplot</em> is to use it to display continuously
changing data that your program may be generating. For this example,
let&rsquo;s assume that you have a program written in the C programming
language and you want to send the data it's generating to <em>gnuplot</em>.
The simplest way to do this is to use the <em>popen</em> system call. Please
refer to this <a href= 
"../168/misc/lg/2_cent_tip__piping_to_gnu_plot_from_c.html">
<em>2-cent tip</em></a> published here sometime back.
</p>

<p>
There is also an ANSI C interface to <em>gnuplot</em> available <a href= 
"http://ndevilla.free.fr/gnuplot/">here</a>, but I haven&rsquo;t personally
used it.
</p>
<!--TOC section GNU Octave-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->GNU Octave</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
GNU Octave (referred to as Octave from now on) is a software tool intended 
for numerical computation. Octave has extensive tools for solving
common numerical linear algebra problems, finding the roots of nonlinear
equations, integrating ordinary functions, manipulating polynomials, and
integrating ordinary differential and differential-algebraic equations.
Octave is available for use on Linux, Solaris, Mac OSX, and Windows.  If
your study or play involves numerical computations, Octave is for you.
Octave has been designed with MATLAB compatibility in mind, so with careful
design you could write scripts which run on both MATLAB and Octave. It is
easily extensible and customizable via user-defined functions written in
Octave&rsquo;s own language, or using dynamically loaded modules written in
C++, C, Fortran, or other languages.
</p>

<p>
Octave is most definitely available in the package repository of your
Linux distribution and that is the easiest way to get it.
</p>

<p>
GNU Octave comes with extensive <a href= 
"http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/">documentation</a>,
which is the best place to get started.
</p>

<p>
In case you happen to like this author&rsquo;s writings, he is currently
writing an article series on Octave elsewhere. Please refer to these

<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Add Python to your toolkit</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
I shall not use this section of the article for <a href= 
"http://www.python.org">Python</a> language advocacy. Rather, I shall point
you to some ways you may consider using Python in your research, if you are
already using it, or think of using it in the future as just another of your
many experiments. Python is already installed on most of the Linux
distributions. Let us now see some of the ways you can use Python:
</p>
<!--TOC subsection As a scientific calculator-->
<h4><!--SEC ANCHOR -->As a scientific calculator</h4>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
With its <a href=
"http://docs.python.org/library/math.html"><em>math</em></a> module, Python
can be a very useful command-line scientific calculator. For
example:
</p>
<pre class="code">
$ python
Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Dec  7 2009, 18:45:15)
[GCC 4.4.1] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.factorial(10)
3628800
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>

<p>
As you can guess, you will have to import the math module every time you
want to use it. You can avoid doing this by automatically importing it at
startup:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a file: .pythonrc in your $HOME and place this line:
<pre>
<em>import math</em>
</pre></li>
<li>Now in your .bashrc or similar:
<pre>
export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonrc
</pre></li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, every time you start Python interactively, you should have the
<em>math</em> module already imported.
</p>
<pre class="code">
$ python
Python 2.6.4rc1 (r264rc1:75270, Oct 10 2009, 02:40:56)
[GCC 4.4.1] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.pi
3.1415926535897931
</pre>

<p>
The <a href=
"http://docs.python.org/library/decimal.html"><em>decimal</em></a> module is
another interesting module which provides support for decimal fixed point and
floating point arithmetic. <a href= 
"http://docs.python.org/library/fractions.html"><em>fractions</em></a> is
another interesting module, which can be used for rational number
arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
The beauty is that you do not need to know the Python <em>programming
language</em> to use these modules. Just fire up the Python interpreter
and import the module(s) you want to use, then call the appropriate
function.
</p>
<!--TOC subsection Scientific libraries-->
<h4><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Scientific libraries</h4>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
If you are already conversant with Python, then you would definitely like
to know about some scientific libraries which you may find useful in your
research:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NumPy and SciPy</strong>: <a href=
"http://numpy.scipy.org/"><em>NumPy</em></a> is an extension to the standard
Python programming language, adding support for large multi-dimensional
arrays and matrices. <a href="http://www.scipy.org/"><em>SciPy</em></a>
builds upon <em>NumPy</em> to provide various mathematical functions for
Integration, Optimization, Interpolation, Linear Algebra, Statistics, and
others.</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><strong>matplotlib</strong>: <a href= 
"http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">This</a> is a plotting library for
Python, which is also used by a lot of other Python scientific tools for
plotting data.</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><strong>NetworkX</strong>:<a href= 
"http://networkx.lanl.gov/">NetworkX</a> is a Python library for the
creation, manipulation, and study of complex networks. Even if you do not have
the need to build very complex networks, it is fun to play around with it to
create simple graphs too.</li>
</ul>
<!--TOC section Beam it with Beamer!-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Beam it with Beamer!</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
You have done your experiments, sent in your findings, they've
been accepted, and now you are going to present them at a
conference. You want to prepare some slides to give you company as you talk
about your work. OpenOffice.org Impress, KOffice? How about taking a look at
something different? You will surely like the results, I promise. <a href= 
"http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net"><em>Beamer</em></a> is a LaTex class
for making presentation slides. In LaTex parlance, it is just another
Document Class. You shouldn&rsquo;t even make an attempt to use Beamer, if
you have no idea what LaTex is. However, if you already use LaTex, chances
are you swear by it, then Beamer is for you.
</p>

<p>
The easiest way to install is to use the package manager in your Linux
distribution. You will see that some more packages providing other extra
LaTex classes need to be installed. Prominent among these are
&rsquo;latex-xcolor&rsquo; and &rsquo;pgf&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
There is, of course, a way to install the LaTex class manually. It's easy to
do it, but not easier than the previous method. The LaTex Beamer user guide
shows how to do it.
</p>

<p>
With the danger of being pulled up by the chief editor for self-publicity,
the author would like to point to his article <em>Typesetting Presentations with
Beamer</em>, published elsewhere. The PDF copy is available from <a href= 
"http://amitksaha.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/02-beamer.pdf">here</a>.

<p>
In this section, I shall talk about some of the other tools, which are
useful for scientific computing that I know of:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sage</strong>: <a href=
"http://www.sagemath.org"><em>Sage</em></a> is an open-source mathematics
software <em>system</em> which brings together a huge number of open-source
mathematical libraries and tools under one common umbrella. In their own
words, the Sage community is building a car, and not reinventing the wheel.
The <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/doc/tutorial/index.html">Sage
tutorial</a> is a good place to start exploring it.</li>
<li><strong>Xfig</strong>: <a href="http://www.xfig.org">Xfig</a> is a
drawing tool which may be used to create figures, import and export figures
in various other formats. <em>fig</em> is the native format that Xfig uses to
save its images. A useful way to use <em>Xfig</em> that I have learnt is to export
your plots from <em>gnuplot</em> as <em>.fig</em> images, open them
in <em>Xfig</em> to add the relevant text/labels to your plots, then
export the plot in a format you desire.</li>
<li><strong>GNU Scientific Library</strong>: The <a href= 
"http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl">GNU Scientific Library</a> is a C/C++
numerical library providing support for Linear Algebra, Complex Numbers,
Numerical Differentiation and others.</li>
</ul>
<!--TOC section The small ones-->
<h3><!--SEC ANCHOR -->The small ones</h3>
<!--SEC END -->

<p>
One category of tools that I haven't talked about yet is some of the Linux
utilities, the ones that ship along with the Linux system - <em>Shell
scripting</em>, <em>awk</em> and <em>sed</em>. My knowledge of each is very
limited, but I have a working knowledge of them all, and I can get things done
with them, which is what matters a lot of the time.
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shell scripting</strong>: Shell scripting is very useful for
running batch jobs: fire up a job and it should finish without requiring any
intermediate user intervention. It's all the more useful when you have to run
an experiment of yours a large number of times. Writing a shell script is
often as simple as just writing several separate commands into one file in a
<em>for</em> loop and running that file. Of course, that's an oversimplification,
but sometimes it <em>is</em> just that simple to set up a batch job. Do not get put
off by the title, but the <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/">Advanced
Bash-Scripting guide</a> is a good place to get started with scripting for
BASH shells.</li>
<li><strong>awk</strong>: The only way I have used <em>awk</em> so far (and a
lot of times) is for text extraction from huge files containing numerical and
textual data. Even with this limited use, it can be a useful tool when you
want to extract text that is stored in a tabular format. The <a href= 
"http://www.gnu.org/manual/gawk/html_node/index.html">GNU Awk User's
Guide</a> is the place to get started to explore <em>awk</em>.</li>
<li class="li-itemize"><strong>sed</strong>: <em>sed</em> is a stream editor
and is useful to carry out batch editing as well as editing of individual
text files. <a href=

<p>
It's often the case that we do not know of a great tool which would
simplify our work as we go about our research work everyday. My hope as a
novice researcher is to acquaint the reader with the kind of software tools
available in the Open Source world.  I have made no attempt to be
exhaustive here. There are a lot of other tools out there, which I
haven&rsquo;t yet used, so I have refrained from writing about them. I hope
you have enjoyed reading this article as much as I have writing it!

<h1>A quick look at what's coming with Fedora 13</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/silva.html">Anderson Silva</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<p>It's Wednesday morning, and it's been exactly 24 hours since the Fedora Project released the beta for Fedora Linux 13th version. If you are not too familiar with Fedora's release schedule, let me give you a quick overview. The Fedora Project tries to release a new version of Fedora around May 1st and October 31st every year.&nbsp; Obviously as with most software projects these dates are goals, and not deadline. For example, Fedora 13, codenamed Goddard, is scheduled to be released on May 18th.</p>

<p>Usually a month or so before the final release of the latest Fedora version, there is a release of a beta, and that's what I am running right now. Like I said, the beta has only been out for 24 hours, and there is no way I've had the chance to go over every single new feature that's coming out with Goddard, but I've been able to verify a few, and those are the ones I will share with you.</p>

<h3>Live "DVD" Installation</h3>

<p>That's right, DVD. At least for this beta distribution Fedora Project has made available a 900+ MB iso for the live image of the OS. Their <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease">site</a> does note that for the final release in May, the image will be back down to fit on a CD. The main reason for this change is the inclusion of OpenOffice to the live image. It's always worth reminding everyone that these live images can also be written to USB drives non-destructively; that is, you can make the disk bootable run and install Fedora live without reformatting your USB drive. For more information see: <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/USBHowTo">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/USBHowTo</a></p>
  
<img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_73cp7pv5d7_b.png" style=HEIGHT:486px;WIDTH:648px><br>

<b>Screenshot 1:</b> A new window in the Fedora live installer that allows the user to pick how they want the OS to be installed on the hard drive.

<h3>Printing</h3>

<p>Remember that scene from 'Office Space' where Peter, Samir and Michael take the office printer to some isolated area and beat the daylights out of it? We've all had that same type of feeling towards printers.&nbsp; I'd even go as far as saying that Linux users may have suffered even more for lack of open source compatible drivers throughout the years. The problem hasn't been completely solved, but we are getting there one release at a time. Fedora 13 will introduce an easier automatic way for your printer drivers to get installed. It detects the printer available, and suggests which RPM needs to be installed to get your system working.</p>

<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_74g72dvrhk_b.png" style=HEIGHT:481.144px;WIDTH:648px><br>
<b>Screenshot 2:</b> My HP Photosmart was automatically detected on the network when trying to add a printer.</p>

<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_75chm6kgfn_b.png" style=HEIGHT:475.669px;WIDTH:648px><br>
<b>Screenshot 3:</b> Fedora suggest the driver needed to get my printing needs met.</p>

<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_76tz42t8fr_b.png" style=HEIGHT:296px;WIDTH:474px><br>
<b>Screenshot 4:</b> I am ready to print</p>

<h3>Network Manager Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>One of the most user-friendly technologies to pop up around the Linux desktop in the past few years is arguably <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a>. It has made detecting network hardware, wifi SSIDs, and broadband cards as easy as plug it in, click, and you are connected. However, this friendliness did not come without a cost. For system administrators like me, the preference of a command line interface for NetworkManager made it virtually impossible to be used in server-based environments.</p>

<p>Fedora 13 will be trying to fill this gap by introducing <em>nmcli</em>, a command line utility that will allow users who prefer the command line to interact with NetworkManager. As of yesterday's Beta's release, this utility still doesn't have a main page, but I am trusting the Fedora community to have one up by the time the final release is out.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_77gkd868gs_b.png" style=HEIGHT:447.298px;WIDTH:648px><br>
<b>Screenshot 5:</b> A couple of examples of nmcli where it shows the status of devices available on my laptop and the connections they are using.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_78ch779zhp_b.png" style=HEIGHT:272.952px;WIDTH:648px><br>
<b>Screenshot 6:</b> <em>nmcli -p dev wifi </em>will show the SSIDs available for you to connect to.</p>

<p>I can tell NetworkManager to connect to my default SSID by running a command such as this:</p>
<pre class="code">
[ansilva@caroica ~]$ nmcli -p con up uuid eceac525-cd30-4df0-8631-73045b42e16e
Active connection state: activating
Active connection path: /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/ActiveConnection/
</pre>

<h3>Languages:</h3>
<p>I am originally from Brazil, and even though I don't think I've ever needed to change my language setting in Fedora, I do know enough people in Brazil, especially new Linux users, who find being able to switch languages in the distribution a nice perk. Fedora 13 will bring a yum plugin that automatically searches for the language RPMs when not already installed on the system.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_79f7tc6gff_b.png" style=HEIGHT:645px;WIDTH:597px><br>
<b>Screenshot 7: </b>Picking Portuguese as the default language will prompt yum to download the correct packages.</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_80323mtpf9_b.png" style=HEIGHT:642px;WIDTH:594px><br>
<b>Screenshot 8:</b> Automatic download. Once installed, just log out and log back in to see the changes.</p>

<h3>iPhone, iPod Touch Support</h3>

<p>I have to be honest, I was skeptical when it was announced that Fedora 13 would work with iPhones and iPod Touches, but I tried it and it worked! I typed in my iPhone passcode, plugged into the USB port, and Fedora recognized my device as a drive, as a camera and as a mp3 player. Very impressive!</p>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_83fzx689cr_b.png" style=HEIGHT:405px;WIDTH:648px><br>
<b>Screenshot 9:</b> My iPhone mounted on Fedora 13 showing my playlists under Rhythmbox.</p>

<p>If you need multimedia codecs to play your media, you can legally purchase them at: <a href="http://www.fluendo.com/">http://www.fluendo.com/</a>. They even have DVD playback software for Linux, including Fedora.</p>

<h3>What else is new?</h3>
<p><img alt="screenshot" src="misc/silva/dgqqst99_82gt33rtgq_b.png" style=HEIGHT:405px;WIDTH:648px><br>
<b>Screenshot 10:</b> Fedora 13 comes with Gnome 2.30, for KDE users, 4.4 is the version packaged for the distro.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other new features and changes in Fedora 13.&nbsp; For example, NFSv4 will become the default version with support for IPv6, and installations and upgrades can now be performed over the internet with boot images available at:&nbsp; <a href="http://boot.fedoraproject.org/">http://boot.fedoraproject.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Even though it started in Fedora 12, it's worth mentioning that Gimp is not a part of the default live image any more, and as of now Fedora 13 Shotwell Photo Manager is. A new GUI tool, called <em>deja-dup</em>,&nbsp; for backup and restore of the system is now part of the OS, although <em>backintime</em> is still my tool of choice.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>During the next few days, or even weeks, there will be plenty of blog posts, press releases and articles written about 'what's new' on Fedora 13.&nbsp; My wish was to give you a quick first-hand look at the changes that most users will start noticing right from the installation process. You can take a more in-depth look at the major features coming out with Fedora 13 at: <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/13/FeatureList">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/13/FeatureList</a> and read its <a href="http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/f13/en-US/html/">Release Notes</a> draft. Be aware that we are dealing with a beta version here, so expect issues and problems. I am not even recommending that you install this beta version, but, if you do, keep an eye on Fedora 13's <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_F13_bugs">Common Bugs</a> page for workarounds and known issues.</p>
<p>And finally, if you do find a bug yourself and would like to report it, you can do so by logging in to <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/</a>.</p>

<h1>Password Management with KeePassX</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/youngman.html">Neil Youngman</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Many of our readers will be familiar with the problems of password
management. How do you keep track of logins for dozens or hundreds of
systems and websites without reusing the same user name and password
over and over? How do you generate passwords for different sites with
different constraints on what constitutes an acceptable password? How
can you securely transfer password lists between systems?
</p>
<p>
There are a whole bunch of solutions to some of these requirements: I
use kwallet, Firefox's password manager and Opera's wand to meet some
of my requirements, but they all have serious limitations. To meet all
those requirements I now use
<a HREF="http://www.keepassx.org/">KeePassX</a>, which is a free
(GPL), cross platform password safe. It also incorporates a password
generator. KeePassX is easy to use and employs high grade encryption
to keep your passwords safe. 
</p>
<p>
This article will give a brief introduction to KeePassX and
demonstrate how to use it.
</p>

<h3>Simple use as a password safe</h3>

<img src="misc/youngman/Fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1">

<p>
When you open KeePassX for the first time you get a window with a number of
blank panes. Passwords can not be saved at this point. All passwords must
be stored in a group, within a database.
</p>

<p>
Start by selecting "File"-&gt;"New database" (shortcut CTRL-N). or
clicking the left-most icon on the tool bar. You will be prompted for
a password (or a key file):
</p>

<img src="misc/youngman/Fig_2.png" alt="Figure 2">

<p>
The button to the right of the password field toggles password visibility,
so you can read the password and check that it is correctly typed, or hide
it from other people in the room.
</p>
<p>
After creating a database the next step is to create a group with
"Edit"-&gt;"Add New Group" (shortcut CTRL-G). You need to enter a group
name and you can also select an icon to go with the group name, if you
don't want the default key icon. I have created a group called,
surprisingly, "Example" for this article.
</p>
<p>
Once a group has been created passwords can be entered with "Edit"-&gt;"Add
New Entry" (shortcut CTRL-Y). This pops up a dialog allowing entry of user
names, passwords and a selection of other details.  
</p>

<img src="misc/youngman/Fig_3.png" alt="Figure 3">

<p>
The entry can include a title, a user name, a URL for web
pages, an expiry date and a comment. If this is not enough, you can
also attach arbitrary files. If you need to see what you are typing
the button with the eye icon to the right of the password toggles
password visibility. When entering the repeat password the background
is red until the repeat password matches the main password.
</p>
<p>
Having entered your passwords In KeePassX, they are easy to access in
a secure fashion. By default passwords are not displayed, but this can
be toggled in the view menu. They can be used without having to
display them, by right clicking on the entry and selecting "Copy
Password to Clipboard". They can then be pasted where they are
needed in the usual way.
</p>

<h3>Using the password generator</h3>

<p>
There are 3 ways to access the password generator. To simply generate
a password select "Extras"-&gt;"Password Generator" or use CTRL-P as a
shortcut. If you are generating a password for an entry in the
database, the password generator can also be accessed via a button
labelled "Gen." next to the "Password Repet.:" entry box. 
</p>

<img src="misc/youngman/Fig_4.png" alt="Figure 4">

<p>
The password entry screen allows the customisation of password
generation according to various criteria, such as length and whether
or not to use upper and lower case, numbers, spaces, special
characters, minus and underscore. There are also tabs for generating
"pronounceable" passwords and using custom sets of characters. The
custom tab does not offer an obvious way of entering ranges of
characters and a quick scan of the source code suggests that this is
not a supported feature.
</p>
<p>
When you have selected your criteria, press the "Generate" button to
create a password. If you are not saving the password, it seems that
you have to make the password visible, by pressing the eye icon, to
copy it. If you are editing an entry, clicking "OK" in the generate
dialog fills in the password. 
</p>

<h3>Cross Platform Use</h3>

<p>
The <a HREF="http://www.keepassx.org/downloads">KeePassX downloads
page</a> offers source code plus packages for Windows, MacOS X, Ubuntu,
OpenSuSE and Fedora. KeePassX is also in the official Debian
repositories. 
</p>
<p>
Password databases generated on Linux or MacOS can be copied to
Windows PCs and accessed from there and vice-versa.
</p>

<h3>Other Features</h3>

<p>
KeePassX offers a choice of AES(Rijndael) or Twofish encryption
algorithms in "File"-&gt;"Database Settings". The number of encryption
rounds can also be adjusted.
</p>

<p>
KeePassX can import <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/passwordmanager/">PwManager</a> files
and XML files exported from kwalletmanager. It can export to plain text or
XML.
</p>


<h3>Postscript</h3>

<p>
In between writing this article and it's publication, I was notified that a
website on which I have a login had been cracked and I should consider the
user name and password compromised. This password dated back to before I
started using KeePassX and like many of my older logins, it had not been
updated to use stronger passwords. At that time I had also followed a
practice of using a limited number of user names and very simple passwords
on "low value" sites to minimise the amount I had to remember. As a
consequence a number of logins were at risk if the attackers tried that
user name and password on other sites I used.
</p>

<p>
I was lucky that the user name on this site was not the user name I used
most often, so the number of sites at direct risk was relatively small.
This has, nevertheless, provided the motivation for me to update my
password on all "low value" logins and any other passwords that appear
weak.
</p>

<p>
In the process of updating these passwords I have noted that the "password
strength" measure provided by KeePassX is essentially useless as it is
calculated by simply multiplying the password length by 8. The string
"aaaaaaaa" is given the same strength as "hr~9kl_p7". I would prefer no
strength indicator to a misleading indicator. <a id="youngman.html_1_back"></a><a href="#youngman.html_1">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
I have also noted that when you copy a password from KeePassX, all the
passwords are erased from klipper (KDE's clipboard history tool) a short
time thereafter.
</p>

I'm just this guy, you know? I'm a CNU graduate with a degree in
 physics. Before starting xkcd, I worked on robots at NASA's Langley
 Research Center in Virginia. As of June 2007 I live in Massachusetts. In
 my spare time I climb things, open strange doors, and go to goth clubs
 dressed as a frat guy so I can stand around and look terribly
 uncomfortable. At frat parties I do the same thing, but the other way
 around.

<p>
Born September 22, 1969, in Gardena, California, "Penguin" Pete Trbovich
 today resides in Iowa with his wife and children. Having worked various
 jobs in engineering-related fields, he has since "retired" from
 corporate life to start his second career. Currently he works as a
 freelance writer, graphics artist, and coder over the Internet. He
 describes this work as, "I sit at home and type, and checks mysteriously
 arrive in the mail."
</p>

<p>
He discovered Linux in 1998 - his first distro was Red Hat 5.0 - and has
 had very little time for other operating systems since. Starting out
 with his freelance business, he toyed with other blogs and websites
 until finally getting his own domain penguinpetes.com started in March
 of 2006, with a blog whose first post stated his motto: "If it isn't fun
 for me to write, it won't be fun to read."
</p>

<p>
The webcomic <em>Doomed to Obscurity</em> was launched New Year's Day,
 2009, as a "New Year's surprise". He has since rigorously stuck to a
 posting schedule of "every odd-numbered calendar day", which allows him
 to keep a steady pace without tiring. The tagline for the webcomic
 states that it "gives the geek culture just what it deserves." But is it
 skewering everybody but the geek culture, or lampooning geek culture
 itself, or doing both by turns?

In keeping with the spirit of the day, Google have released a set of
open source annotations for Java:
<a href='http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/03/google-annotations-gallery.html'>http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/03/google-annotations-gallery.html</a>
(project: <a href='http://code.google.com/p/gag/'>http://code.google.com/p/gag/</a>)
</p>

<p>
This adds some missing features to Java:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
    @ThisWouldBeOneLineIn(language="C++",
toWit="vwords[ivwords]-&gt;add_ignored_string(str);")
    private void vwords_set_superficial(int ivwords, String str) {
        TaggerWord tmp = new TaggerWord();
        tmp = vwords.get(ivwords);
        tmp.set_superficial_form(str);
        vwords.set(ivwords, tmp);
    }
</pre>

<p>
It also includes @LOL, @Facepalm, @WTF, and @AnimalsHarmedDuringTheMaking
</p>

<pre>-- 
&lt;spectie&gt;       Jim only looks at them through the reflection in a mirror
&lt;Aha_&gt;  he told me there are 'some' errors
&lt;spectie&gt;       hahaha
&lt;spectie&gt;       he was being extremely generous
&lt;spectie&gt;       it is more correct to say that "amazingly, there is
some stuff that <em>isn't</em> wrong"
</pre>
