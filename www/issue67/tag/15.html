Domain Renaming and E-mail Routing and Re-writing

<P><STRONG>
Mr. Dennis,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Currently our campus is making a domain change from ricks.edu to
byui.edu  We would like all of our email that is addressed
to ricks.edu to be forwarded to the new byui.edu domain.  Is there a way
to do this with MX records some how?
</STRONG></P>

Changing domain names is hard.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This cannot be done with MX records (alone).  It must be done by
the MTAs (sendmail, qmail, postfix, exim, or whatever you want to
use).  The MX records will associate a list of preferences and
destinations with an e-mail domain.  Usually all but one of the MX
destinations will be relays (your ISP, a couple of your well-connected
and reasonably trustworthy friends or "partners").  Those will all
contain higher precedence values (meaning "less preferred") so any
proper SMTP MTA which attempts to deliver mail to that domain will
ignore all the secondary/tertiary MX hosts and attempt to contact
the (usually one) with the lowest precedence.  (The others are for
"fallback" when the preferred destination is unreachable).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So with MX records you can say that mail to ricks.edu should be
delivered to a machine (hostname) which is in the byui.edu
domain.  Note that you MUST use a hostname and not a "CNAME"
or alias and not an IP address.  Of course the hostname must
be listed in some valid DNS zone which provides one or more
A (address) records for it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's say that you choose to deliver all ricks.edu mail to
rexburgmx.byui.edu.  Publishing a set of MX records like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>ricks.edu.	IN MX 10	rexburgmx.byui.edu.
		IN MX 20	mx.byui.edu.
		IN MX 30	mail.backbone.not.

rexburg.byui.edu. IN MX 10	rexburgmx.byui.edu.

rexburgmx.byui.edu.  IN A	123.45.67.89
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... would serve to get mail delivered to the machine at 123.45.67.89
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Any host that couldn't reach that machine would try to drop it on
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
mx.byui.edu and thence on mail.backbone.not (Note the bogus top-level
domain here --- it's for example only!).  Those secondary MX destinations
should be configured to relay mail to your primary host.  (It used to be
allowed by default in sendmail and most other MTAs --- however the
spammers exploited this courtesy and laissez faire approach and have
increased the burden on sysadmins and postmasters everywhere).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now the host named rexburgmx.byui.edu would have to be configured to
consider itself <EM>the</EM> mail destination for the ricks.edu mail
domain.  In sendmail terms we'd have to add ricks.edu to the "who am I"
class (Cw) or file/list (Fw).  In qmail we'd put this in the
locals or the me control file.  In Postfix we'd add it do the
"mydestination" list (or keyed/database file).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfortunately that approach, by itself might lead to some oddities.
Outgoing mail from this system might end up with headers and envelope
"From" addresses set to the byui.edu domain, or some rexburg.byui.edu
subdomain.  (In the worst case they'd end up with the <EM>hostname</EM>
as their from address).  In sendmail terms they might be "masqueraded
as" being from byui.edu.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's where we get complicated. You have to make some policy
decisions about how you want mail headers to look at mail goes
out of your domain.  This will effect how replies get routed back
to you.  There is no "right way" to do it.  There are many possibilities
and pros and cons to each.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Perhaps all you want is a simple transitional delivery mechanism.  Perhaps
all new addresses will be in the rexburg.byui.edu domain or even directly
in the byui.edu domain or in various departmental subdomains under
byui.edu --- sci. (or science students and faculty), cs (computer science),
adm, admin or staff (for administrative staff) etc.  Perhaps you intend
to move all the old accounts and e-mail addresses to new ones (or you've
already done so <EM>and</EM> resolves any name collisions that arose).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In those cases the ricks.edu e-mail domain exists purely so that
mail to the old addresses gets delivered to the proper recipients.
All responses to <A HREF="mailto:foo@ricks.edu"
	>foo@ricks.edu</A> can reasonably have a From: address
of <A HREF="mailto:foo@byui.edu"
	>foo@byui.edu</A> or possibly even <A HREF="mailto:foo_bar@byui.edu"
	>foo_bar@byui.edu</A> (where the mail
was re-written through some form of aliasing, perhaps to resolve a
name collision between Mr. Foo at byui.edu and Ms. Frances Oo (no relation)
at ricks.edu).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thost are the sorts of things that make this sort of transition
"interesting."  Corporate mergers and aquisitions make it a fairly
common occurence; which doesn't make it any easier.  Unfortunately
I can't describe a simple procedure for you to follow.  There are
too many variables.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As implied by my title, here:  renaming your e-mail domain has
two distinct aspects; routing the incoming mail to its recipients
(mailboxes) and generating/re-writing headers on outbound mail
so that responses can make it back to their authors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Have fun.  You're in for a learning experience.
