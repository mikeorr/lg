<H1>Big Brother</H1>
<H3>A Web-based Unix Network Monitoring <BR>
and Notification System</H3>
<H4>Version 1.00 - 31 December 1996</H4>
<P>
<UL>
This document introduces Big Brother, a solution to the problem
of Unix Systems Monitoring.
<P>
Commercial solutions are available, however these solutions are
very expensive, costing many thousands of dollars in additional
hardware and software.  More distressing though, is the obvious
complexity of these solutions, most requiring several hundred
man-hours of consulting time just to set up.  Finally, they don't
use the Web as their interface, not only making truly remote monitoring
impossible, but also making data sharing extremely difficult.
<P>
Big Brother is a simple, effective solution to the Systems Monitoring
problem, and is presented here for your comments and suggestions.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>What is Big Brother?</H2>

<P>
Big Brother is a loosely-coupled distributed set of tools for
monitoring and displaying the current status of an entire Unix
network and notifying the admin should need be.  It came about
as the result of automating the day to day tasks encountered while
actively administering Unix systems.
<P>
It consists of five major parts:
<UL>
<LI><B>Central monitoring station</B> <I>(Display Server)</I>  This
station accepts incoming reports and prepares them for display.
 Big Brother uses the Web as its user interface, so it can be
accessed by anyone with clearance to access the Big Brother site.
 Furthermore, additional views or displays can be created quickly
and easily by writing simple Bourne Shell scripts.
<P>
<LI><B>Network monitor</B> <I>(bb-network.sh).</I>  The network
monitor runs on any Unix machine and periodically contacts every
machine, router, and firewall in the your bb-hosts file via ping,
and http if appropriate.  Results are then sent to the system
designated as the Display Server.
Connections to the internet may likewise be monitored.
<P>
<LI><B>Local System Monitor</B> <I>(bb-local.sh).</I>  Each server
in the network runs a local system monitor which periodically
samples disk space, CPU usage, number of users, and ensures that
required processes are on-line and active.  It reports the results
to the Display Server, and also has the
ability to directly page the administrator in the case of an emergency.
<P>
<LI><B>Pager Programs</B> <I>(bb-page.sh).</I>
 The client <I>(bb)</I> that sends single lines of information
to the designated server <I>(bbd)</I> and executes a script
<I>(page)</I> which forwards this information using Kermit via modem to the
designated pager.
<P>
<LI><B>Intra-machine communications programs</B> <I>(bb, bbd, nettest).</I>
 A <I>client (tac-bb)</I> that sends single lines of information
to the designated Display and Pager Serverswhich then 
take appropriate action.  These programs communicate using port 1984;
what else would Big Brother use?

<H2>The Big Brother Display:</H2>
<P>
Big Brother was designed to provide instant information about
the health of a Unix Network to anyone, anywhere, with 
Web access to the site.
<P>
Network information is now instantly available to those who need
it most: managers, systems administrators, and people on the help
desk can actively and simply monitor the health of the network.
<P>
If any condition is severe, the administrator will have been paged,
can use Big Brother to get additional information, and can proceed
to fix the problem.  Problem verification, data sharing and correction
should improve immediately, since everyone has implicit access
to the same information.
<P>
Finally, since warnings are displayed, corrective action can be
taken even before users notice that there is a problem.
<P>
The display matrix shows a status of <B>green</B> <I>(ok),</I>
 <B>yellow </B><I>(warning),</I> <B>red</B> <I>(severe),</I> and
<B>blue</B> <I>(no contact)</I> for each system/area combination.
 Furthermore, the entire screen changes color to reflect the most
serious condition on the network.  In order of increasing severity
these conditions are: <B>green, yellow, blue, red.</B>
<P>
Therefore one single warning anywhere on the network results in
the entire display turning yellow which is highly visible, even
from far away.
<P>
Each of the elements in the display matrix can then be clicked
on to provide additional information, including the code, time,
and specific information about the area being monitored.
<P>
Additionally, Big Brother now makes detailed information about every
server in the network instantly accessible, just by clicking on the
server name.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Big Brother Warning Conditions:</H2>

<P>
<I>Every machine, firewall and router is accessed via ping every
5 minutes</I>. Any
loss of contact results in a code red, and the administrator being
paged.
<P>
<I>Every registered Web server is accessed every 15 minutes</I>
using a <I>bbnet.</I>  Loss of contact with a Web
server is a severe condition.  Inability of access a page due
to a &quot;Server Error&quot; results in a warning condition.
<P>
<I>All systems are monitored for disk usage.</I>  Any disk over
90% full is considered a warning condition.  Disks over 95% full
are marked as a severe condition, since this situation can quickly
result in a system crash or hang.  
<P>
<I>All systems are monitored for CPU usage.</I> A load average
over 1.50 is a warning condition, 3.00 merits a severe condition.
<P>
<I>Processes are monitored on each system as well</I>.  The choice
of what is to be monitored is dependent of what each system actually
does.
A warning condition results if any of these important processes
should die.
<P>
<I>System messages are monitored.</I>  Big Brother watches /var/adm/messages
for NOTICE and WARNING conditions.  NOTICE conditions result in the admin
being paged immediately.  WARNING conditions cause a yellow dot to appear.
Clicking on the corresponding dot will report the message that caused the
display.
<P>
<I>And finally the messaging system itself is monitored</I> by
the Central Monitoring station.  Any report over 30 minutes old
results in that report, and the entire screen being marked in
blue, indicating a possible loss of contact within the Big Brother
system itself.
<P>
<I>Note that all of the above are configurable parameters.</I>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Design Considerations:</H2>
<P>
Some of the guidelines involved in the design of Big Brother are
the following:
<UL>
<P><LI><B>Usefulness</B>.  Display only useful information in a timely
and effective manner.  Too much information can be as bad as too
little, especially if it's displayed in an obscure manner.
<P><LI><B>Intelligence</B>.  Use of heuristics to determine health,
in a manner similar to what an actual administrator or user would
do, instead of very low-level testing.
<P><LI><B>Highly scalable</B>. Easily made more redundant through
replication of the individual components.  All that has to be
decided on is the level of redundancy required and where to install
the scripts.  No additional cost and little additional complexity.
<P><LI><B>Modular.</B>  Big Brother is designed in a totally modular
fashion, using simple Bourne shell scripts to test each
area.  Adding more monitoring areas only requires the creation
of a script to monitor that area.  New monitoring areas can be
added and distributed in a manner of minutes.  

<P><LI><B>Easily Customized</B>.  Error levels and actions can be
designated on a system-by-system basis, just by editing the appropriate
script.
<P><LI><B>Replication.</B>  Separation of local system reporting
and network reporting means that there is built-in replication,
at the system level and the network level.  Further redundancy
is built-in at the display level through checking timestamps of
incoming reports; loss of reports indicates a problem which causes
the screen to turn blue.  Finally, each client has the ability
to send messages to the pager daemon; this further reduces the
likelihood of non-notification in the event of catastrophic systems
failure.
<P><LI><B>Simplicity</B>.  The design is extremely simple, the client/server
programs are less than 8K bytes in size, and messages are less
than 100 bytes.  It is extremely lightweight and very efficient.
 
<P><LI><B>Open and Standard.</B>  Using the Web as the display mechanism
allows extremely rapid prototyping of displays, and provides a
standard and elegant method of distributing this essential information,
worldwide.  The C programs involved are small, simple and standard.
 Shell scripts are obviously portable, as are programs like lynx
and kermit, which are used for testing.  Therefore, all the elements
of Big Brother can be easily ported to any Unix System.

<H2>What Big Brother isn't:</H2>

<P>
<I>Big Brother is not a replacement for a qualified and experienced
Systems Administrator</I>.  On the contrary, it is a big brother
to the Sys Admin.  It does not shut down machines or terminate
processes, although it could be programmed to do so.  It just
identifies and notifies.
<P>
<I>Big Brother does not explicitly monitor individual hardware
components.</I>  However, failure of a hardware component is very
likely to cause a severe condition through loss of service.
<P>
<I>Big Brother does not monitor performance of the network, servers,
databases or any individual application.</I>  It will however
provide information about CPU loads and implicit information about
response time; i.e. telnet connections have 15 seconds to answer.
 
<P>
<I>Big Brother isn't complicated</I>.  Once the methodology and
underlying tools are understood, changes and enhancements are
very simple to make.
<P>
<I>Big Brother isn't expensive</I>.  In fact, it's free.
<P>
<I>Big Brother isn't finished.</I>  But it keeps growing every
day, doing more and more watching.  Big Brother is watching...
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Other things Big Brother Should Do:</H2>
<P>
Errors in /var/adm/messages should be handled better.
<P>
Big Brother should support alphanumeric paging and enhanced messages.
<P>
Big Brother should be enhanced to work on black and white screens.
<P>
Big Brother should log critical and warning situations.
<P>
Big Brother should learn something about Oracle databases.
<P>
Big Brother should automatically determine what processes to monitor.
<P>
Big Brother should probably try to monitor security.

<H2>About the Creator:</H2>
<P>
Big Brother was created by Sean MacGuire, while a consultant with the Tactik 
Infrastructure Group of Bell Sygma in Montreal.  After fifteen years of 
Unix Systems Administration, Systems Design, and User Interface Design, 
this system was created to make his life easier.
<P>
Sean MacGuire currently has two patents pending, and is the publisher of
<A HREF="http://www.iti.qc.ca/iti/bunny/"><I>It's a Bunny</I></A>, a 
literary Web Magazine which I-Way magazine ranked as one of the top 500 sites 
on the the Internet, and the 10th best magazine.
<P>
The photo which adorns the Big Brother Display is Sean MacGuire.  He is 
Big Brother... it is meant to be reminicent of George Orwell's book 1984.
That's why it's not a pretty picture.
