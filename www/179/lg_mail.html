<h3>Image size vs. file size</h3>
<p>
<b><p>
Ben Okopnik [ben at linuxgazette.net]

<p>

</p>

<b>Tue, 28 Sep 2010 20:04:15 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
I've always been curious about the huge disparity in file sizes between
certain images, especially when they have - oh, more or less similar
content (to my perhaps uneducated eye.) E.g., I've got a large list of
files on a client's site where I have to find some path between a
good average image size (the pic that pops up when you click the
thumbnail) and a reasonable file size (something that won't crash
PHP/GD - a 2MB file brings things right to a halt.)
</p>

<p>
Here's the annoying thing, though:
</p>

<pre>
ben at Jotunheim:/tmp$ ls -l allegro90_1_1.jpg bahama20__1.jpg; identify allegro90_1_1.jpg bahama20__1.jpg 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ben ben   43004 2010-09-28 19:43 allegro90_1_1.jpg
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ben ben 1725638 2010-09-28 14:37 bahama20__1.jpg
allegro90_1_1.jpg JPEG 784x1702 784x1702+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 42kb 
bahama20__1.jpg[1] JPEG 2240x1680 2240x1680+0+0 8-bit DirectClass 1.646mb 
</pre>

<p>
The first image, which is nearly big enough to cover my entire screen,
is 42k; the second one, while admittedly about 3X bigger in one
dimension, is 1.6MB+, over <strong>40</strong> times the file size. Say *what*?
</p>

<p>
And it's not like the complexity of the content is all that different;
in fact, visually, the first one is more complex than the second
(although I'm sure I'm judging it by the wrong parameters. Obviously.)
Take a look at them, if you want:
</p>

<p>
<a href='http://okopnik.com/images/allegro90_1_1.jpg'>http://okopnik.com/images/allegro90_1_1.jpg</a>
<a href='http://okopnik.com/images/bahama20__1.jpg'>http://okopnik.com/images/bahama20__1.jpg</a>
</p>

<p>
So... what makes an image - seemingly of the same type, according to
what "identify" is reporting - that much bigger? Does anybody here know?
And is there any way to make the file sizes closer without losing a
significant amount of visual content?
</p>

<p>
Hello, Gang -
</p>

<p>
After a number of years of providing hosting services for LG (and a
number of others), our old friend T. R. is, sadly, shutting down his
servers. Whatever his plans for the future may be, he has my best wishes
and the utmost in gratitude for all those great years; if there was such
a thing as a "Best Friends and Supporters of LG" list, he'd be right at
the top.
</p>

<p>
(T.R. - if we happen to be in the same proximity, the beer's on me. Yes,
even the realy good stuff.)
</p>

<p>
I've arranged for space on another host, moved the site over to it, and
have just finished all the configuration and alpha testing. Please check
out LG in its new digs (at the same URL, obviously), and let me know if
you find any problems or anything missing.
</p>

<h3>GPG secret key</h3>

</p>

<p>
Is there a neat way to export and save my GPG/PGP secret key (private
key) on a USB stick ?
</p>

<p>
I have to do this, since I am often changing my machines (most of which
are given on loan by my employers). The secret key goes away with the
machine, and I am obliged to generate a new key pair each time. I did a
Google search and did not succeed.
</p>

<p>
I know I can save/export my public key, but GPG/PGP refuse to let me use
a copy of my secret key.
</p>

<p>
Any hint, or pointers would be gratefully appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks,
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, people are scared to get a screw driver and check what's
inside the hard drive. Or maybe simply because we're too lazy to read
manuals.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the alternative? How about a simple flash based tutorial?

</p>

<p>
It's geared toward disaster recovery, but in my opinion it's still
valuable for anyone who would like to see how the hardware works.

I don't know why this kind of thing keeps coming up. I never wanted to be
a mathematician, I'm just a simple programmer! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
(One of these days, I'm going to sail over to an uninhabited island and
stay there for six months or so, studying math. This is just
embarassing; any time a problem like this comes up, I feel so <strong>stupid</strong>.)
</p>

<p>
I've been losing a lot of weight lately, and wanted to plot it on a
chart. However, I've only been keeping very sparse records of the
change, so what I need to do is interpolate it. In other words, given a
list like this:
</p>

<pre>
6/26/2010 334
8/12/2010 311.8
8/19/2010 308.4
9/5/2010 300.0
9/9/2010 298.6
9/14/2010 297.2
9/16/2010 293.6
</pre>

<p>
I need to come up with a "slope" function that will return my weight at
any point between 6/26 and 9/16. The time end of it is no problem - I
just convert the dates into Unix "epoch" values (seconds since
1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) - but the mechanism that I've got for figuring
out the weight at a given time is hopelessly crude: I split the total
time span into X intervals, then find the data points preceding and
following it, and calculate the "slope" between them, then laboriously
figure out the value for that point. What I'd really, really like to
have is a function that takes the above list and returns the weight
value for any given point in time between Tmin and Tmax; I'm sure that
it's a standard mathematical function, but I don't know how to implement
it.
</p>

<p>
Can any of you smart folks help? I'd appreciate it.

Hi Tag,
</p>

<p>
I am trying to rework a script that currently uses an external file to
keep track of what issue the Linux Gazette is on. I would like to do
this with out relying on an external file (feels cleaner that way) and
just calculate this from within the script using  maybe the month and
year from localtime(time) from within Perl. Using the month and year I
thought this would be an easy task but it turns out its more difficult
than I thought.  I will probably need some  formula to do It to  since I
will be running it from cron. Can you make any suggestions on how I 
might attempt this? I have tried to figure a constant that I could use
to get it to come out correct with no luck. What works for one year
fails when the year changes when you add the month to the year. 
</p>

<p>
# Get Issue
my (@date,$month,$year,$issue);
</p>

<p>
@date = localtime(time);
$month=($date[4])+1;
$year=($date[5])+1900;
</p>

<p>
$issue= $year - 1841 + $month ;
print "Month = $month Year = $year Issue = $issue\n";
</p>

Hi Gang, 
</p>

<p>
I have a question on how to go about installing kernel modules without
going through the entire process of recompiling a new kernel.
In question is the agpgart module which i want to have as a loadable
module. As of now my the agpgart only exists as header files, and dont have
the modules ".ko" file yet. 
Below is the output command from locate agpgart.
</p>

<p>
$ locate agpgart
</p>

<p>
/usr/include/linux/agpgart.h
/usr/src/kernels/2.6.31.5-127.fc12.i686.PAE/include/linux/agpgart.h
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.
