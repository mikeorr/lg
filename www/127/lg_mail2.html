<h3><img ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/envelope.gif"><font color="navy"> questions 
  about discover</font></h3>
<p>J. Bakshi (j.bakshi at icmail.net)<br />
  Sat Mar 25 22:06:39 PST 2006</p>
<p> <strong>Dear list,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am using discover 2.0.6 in a debian sarge(testing) machine with Linux 
  2.6.8-2-k7 kernel. There is no */etc/discover.conf* file. I can't understand 
  where discover is looking after for its default configuration. Pls let me know 
  so that I can change its scanning options. *discover -t modem* or *discover 
  -t printer* don't detect my modem or printer BUT hwinfo detect these H/W perfectly. 
  What may be the problem ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have presently the files in my machine are</strong></p>
<pre>
   /usr/bin/discover 
   /etc/discover.d 
   /lib/discover
   /usr/share/discover 
   /usr/share/man/man1/discover.1.gz
   discover.conf-2.6
   discover-modprobe.conf
   discover.conf.d
   discover-v1.conf
   discover.d</pre>
<p><strong>What to do so that discover can load the drivers module automatically 
  during boot ? Kindly solve my doubts. Please CC to me with best complements</strong></p>
<p>[Rick] - The Debian systems I have at my disposal at this moment don't have 
  discover installed, so I'm limited to the information available on-line. However, 
  searching http://packages.debian.org/ for &quot;discover&quot; turns up a number 
  of packages including the main &quot;discover&quot; one, providing this list 
  of contents on i386 sarge (which is _not_ the testing branch, by the way: sarge=stable, 
  etch=testing -- for quite some time, now):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><a href="http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=discover&version=stable&arch=i386">http://packages.debian.org/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&amp;word=discover&amp;version=stable&amp;arch=i386</a></p>
  <p>I notice in that list a file called &quot;etc/discover-modprobe.conf&quot;. 
    Perhaps that's what you're looking for? Its manpage (also findable on the 
    Internet) describes it as &quot;the configuration file for discover-modprobe, 
    which is responsible for retrieving and loading kernel modules&quot;.</p>
  <p> &gt; *discover -t modem* or *discover -t printer* don't detect my modem 
    or<br />
    &gt; printer BUT hwinfo detect these H/W perfectly. What may be the problem?</p>
  <p>Ah, now _that_ is a completely different question. J. Bakshi, you really 
    would be well advised to be careful of overdefining your problem, when you're 
    asking for help. If your _real_ problem is that you haven't yet figured out 
    how to configure Debian-sarge to address your modem and printer, please _say 
    so_ and give us relevant details.</p>
  <p>If, by contrast, you claim the problem is that you need to find discover's 
    configuration file, _that_ is all you'll get help with, even if your problem 
    has nothing to do with discover in the first place.</p>
  <p>I have a suggestion: Why don't you back up and start over? Tell us about 
    your modem and printer's nature and configuration, what relevant software 
    is installed on your system, what is an is not happening, what you've tried, 
    and exactly what happened when you tried that.</p>
  <p> _Note_:<br />
    You should not attempt to recall those things from memory, but rather attempt 
    them again while taking contemporaneous notes. Post information from those 
    notes, instead of from vague recollections and reconstructions of events in 
    your memory. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[jbakshi]] - My installed sarge is still in testing mode that's why I have 
  explicitly mention * sarge(testing) * I have no broad-band to upgrade my system. 
  Dial-up is too poor.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Automatically You have given answear of a question which was asked latter 
    -:) Yes, discover-modprobe automatically loads kernel module for the discover_detected 
    H/W . </p>
  <p>*cat /etc/discover-modprobe.conf* shows as below</p>
  <pre class="code">
   # $Progeny: discover-modprobe.conf 4668 2004-11-30 04:02:26Z licquia $


   # Load modules for the following device types. Specify "all"
   # to detect all device types.
   types="all"

   # Don't ever load the foo, bar, or baz modules.
   #skip="foo bar baz"

   # Lines below this point have been automatically added by
   # discover-modprobe(8) to disable the loading of modules that have
   # previously crashed the machine:</pre>
  <p> But I am still looking for the configuration_file which define how the command 
    *discover* detects buses.</p>
  <p>I thought this issue is also related with the same doscover_configuration_file 
    but now I have the answear. please see below</p>
  <p>I have Epson C20SX parallel inkjet printer.</p>
  <p>running *hwinfo --printer* detects my printer correctly. below is the o/p 
    of the command</p>
  <pre class="code">
   14: Parallel 00.0: 10900 Printer
     [Created at parallel.153]
     Unique ID: ffnC.GEy3qUgdsRD
     Parent ID: YMnp.ecK7NLYWZ5D
     Hardware Class: printer
     Model: "EPSON Stylus C20"
     Vendor: "EPSON"
     Device: "Stylus C20"
     Device File: /dev/lp0
     Config Status: cfg=new, avail=yes, need=no, active=unknown
     Attached to: #9 (Parallel controller)</pre>
  <p>but *discover -t printer* returns nothing. I have founded the answear. man 
    pages of discover (version 2.0.6) says that discover scans only ati, pci, 
    pcmcia, scsi, usb. That's why it can't detect my parallel printer and PS/2 
    mouse, serial modem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Rick]]] - [Quoting J. Bakshi (j.bakshi at icmail.net):]</p>
  
<blockquote>
  <p>&gt; My installed sarge is still in testing mode</p>
  <p>No. It's really not.</p>
  <p>[Snip bit where I suggest that you start over with a fresh approach, and 
    where you don't do that. Oh well. If you decide you want to be helped, please 
    consider following my advice, instead of ignoring it.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[jbakshi]]]] - </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Please Try to understand</p>
  <p>1) I installed Sarge from CD pack. When I did the installation *sarge was 
    in testing mode THEN*</p>
  <p>2) Now sarge has become stable</p>
  <p>3) As I don't have broadband and the dialup is also too poor, I couldn't 
    upgrade my *installed* sarge hence *that installed sarge in my box is still 
    a testing release*</p>
  <p>4) I have no intention to ignore any advice as I need those seriously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[Rick]]]]] - [Quoting J. Bakshi (j.bakshi at icmail.net):]</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &gt; 2) Now sarge has become stable</p>
  <p>I know all this.</p>
  <p>[no broadband]</p>
  <p>&gt; hence *that installed sarge in my box is still a testing release*</p>
  <p>i knew what you were saying, but it's was somewhat misleading to refer to 
    sarge as the testing branch. Irrespective of the state of your system's software 
    maintenance, it's 2006, and sarge is now the stable branch. Shall we move 
    on?</p>
  <p>&gt; 4) I have no intention to ignore any advice as I need those seriously.</p>
  <p>OK, so, when you wish to do that, you'll be starting fresh by describing 
    relevant aspects of your hardware and system, and saying what actual problem 
    you're trying to solve, what you tried, what the system did when you tried 
    various things, etc. You may recall that _that_ was my advice. </p>
  <p>I said you weren't electing to follow my advice because you weren't doing 
    that. So far, you still aren't. But that is still my suggestion. To be more 
    explicit: You started out by defining your problem as &quot;discover&quot; 
    configuration -- but there was actually no reason to believe that was the 
    case. Therefore, you were asking the wrong question. Start over, please.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Thomas] - I'm jumping in here to say that &quot;discover&quot; is a real PITA. 
  It's the most annoying package ever, and should die after installation. It conflicts 
  no end with anything held in /etc/modules, and actively disrupts hotplug for 
  things like USB devices.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You don't need it for anything post-installation. If you somehow think you 
    do, you're wrong.</p>

<h3><img ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/envelope.gif"> <font color="navy">Please 
  solve a doubt about linux H/W detection</font></h3>
<p>J. Bakshi (j.bakshi at icmail.net)<br />
  Wed Mar 29 04:19:05 PST 2006</p>
<p> <strong>Dear list,</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please help me to solve a doubt. In linux world *discover* *hwinfo* 
  *kudzu* are the H/W detection technology. Do they directly probe the *raw* piece 
  of H/W to collect information about it ? what about lspci, lsusb, lshw ?? Do 
  they also provide H/W information by probing the *raw* piece of H/W or just 
  retrieve the information which are already provided by some H/W detection technology 
  as mentioned above ?? kindly cc to me.</strong></p>
<p>[Thomas] - Not as such. They tend to query the kernel which itself has &quot;&quot;probed&quot;&quot; 
  the devices beforehand.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&gt; lsusb, lshw ?? Do they also provide H/W information by probing the<br />
    &gt; *raw* piece of H/W or just retrieve the information which are already<br />
    &gt; provided by some H/W detection technology as mentioned above ??</p>
  <p>What difference does it make to you if it has or has not? I'll reiterate 
    once more that you DO NOT need discover at all. In fact, it's considered harmful 
    [1]</p>
  <p>[1] Just by me, for what that's worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[jbakshi]] - Nothing as such but my interest to know those technologies, specially 
  from those who have already used those and quite aware the advantage and disadvante. 
  Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>[[jbakshi]] - Just find out from man page. *lspci -H1* or *lspci -H2* do direct 
  H/W access. *lspci -M* enable bus mapping mode</p>
<p>[[Kapil]] - In case that makes you feel happier Thomas, I saw a mail (which 
  I can't find right now) that indicates debian-installer team is in agreement 
  with you. However, the replacement &quot;udev/hotplug/coldplug&quot; may also 
  make you unhappy :)</p>
<p>[[[Thomas]]] - Ugh. :) Udev is a fad that perpetuates the dick-waving wars 
  of &quot;Oooh, look at me, I only have three entries in /dev. You have 50000, 
  so mine's much better&quot;. It has absolutely *no* real advantage over a static 
  /dev tree whatsoever.</p>
<p>[[[[Pedro]]]] - What about the symlink magic explained <a href="http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html">here</a> 
  (http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html)?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>To hotplug different scanners, digital cameras or other usb devices in no 
    particular other, and make them appear always in the same known point inside 
    the filesystem, looks like a good feature. How would that be done without 
    udev?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[Thomas]]]]] - You can use a shell-script to do it. I did something similar 
  a few years ago.</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Are you sure, Thomas? Not that I'm a huge fan of Udev - it smacks 
  too much of magic and unnecessary complexity - but I like the idea of devices 
  being created as they become necessary. Expecting some Linux newbie to know 
  enough to create '/dev/sr*' or '/dev/audio' when the relevant piece of software 
  throws a cryptic message is unreasonable. Having them created on the fly could 
  eliminate a subset of problems.</p>
<p>[[[[[Thomas]]]]] - Well, pretty much. At least you have some kind of assurance 
  that the device &quot;exists&quot; whether it's actully attached to some form 
  of physical device or not. Plus, one the permissions are set on that device 
  and you have the various group ownerships sorted out... it's trivial.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I realise Udev does all of this as well, but you have to have various node 
    mappings and layered complexity not observed with a static /dev tree. Then 
    there's all sorts of shenanigans with things like initrds and the line for 
    some kernels. It's just not worth the effort to effectivelty allow a &quot;ls 
    /dev&quot; listing to show up without the use of a pager. ;)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Well, actually, now that I'm thinking about it - so could a '/dev' 
  that's pre-stuffed with 50,000 entries. Hmm, I wonder why that's not the default 
  - since, theoretically, these things take no space other than their own inode 
  entry.</p>

<h3><img ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/envelope.gif"> OS/X - &quot;Just like 
  real BSD&quot;</h3>
<p class="editorial">The following originally came under the thread "Please solve a doubt about 
  linux H/W detection". Given the drift, I've renamed this subthread for benefit of findability.</p>
<p><strong>OBTW - I would like to get my hands around the throat of the person 
  who decided that '/dev/dsp' and '/dev/mixer' are unnecessary in OS/X. Really, 
  it would only be for a few moments... is that too much to ask?</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Installing X11+xmms on the latest OS/X is a HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS, 
  for anyone who's interested.)</strong></p>
<p>[Thomas] - That's not the only thing that's unneccesary in OS/X from what I 
  hear. :)</p>
<p>[[Ben]]- [rolling eyes] Don't get me started. &quot;Just like real BSD&quot;... 
  yeah, *RIGHT*.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>At least they have Perl, Python, ssh, tar, and find (well, some freakin' 
    weird version of 'find', but at least it's there) pre-installed. That part 
    keeps me sane when dealing with Macs. Last night, a friend of mine who uses 
    one asked my opinion of various $EXPENSIVE_BACKUP_PROGRAMS for his Mac. My 
    response was &quot;why would you want to actually spend *money* on this? You 
    have 'tar', 'cpio', and 'pax' already installed.&quot; Made him happy as a 
    lark; 'tar cvzf' was right up his alley even though he'd never so much as 
    seen an xterm before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Kapil]]] - There is also &quot;fink&quot; which (in conjunction with &quot;xterm&quot;) 
  is a lifesaver when it comes to turning a Mac into something almost normal. 
  (For those not in the know---&quot;fink&quot; is &quot;apt&quot; for OS/X which 
  actually uses a .deb packaging format as well).</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This alone makes OS/X far-far better than its predecessors. Sample of earlier 
    conversion with typical Mac user whose computer I wished to use for a brief 
    while.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Well... more or less. As in &quot;more broken or less useful&quot;. 
  You get a subset of the APT utilities for the command line, as well as Fink 
  Commander which is a GUI; &quot;apt-get&quot;, or at least the repository behind 
  it, is badly broken since at least a quarter (IME) of the &quot;available&quot; 
  packages have unsatisfiable dependencies. It also throws persistent errors (something 
  like &quot;/usr/foo/bar/zotz/cc1plus not executable&quot;) which can't be fixed 
  by installing any of the available software. As well, &quot;apt-cache search&quot; 
  provides a meager subset of the listings shown at Fink.org - e.g., there are 
  several dozen OpenOffice packages shown at the latter, whereas the former has 
  never heard of OO.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Fink Commander is even more &quot;wonderful&quot;: when you hit the 'Upgrade 
    Fink Commander' button, it breaks itself _and_ the entire APT kit due to a 
    stupid interface error (the CLI app that it's wrapping blocks on a question 
    - you can see it in the dialog area - and there's no way to feed its STDIN; 
    all you can do is kill the GUI, which interrupts the process half-way through 
    installation.) To fix it, you have to remove the '/sw' directory - which contains 
    *all the software you ever installed with Fink* - and start from scratch. 
    That's the recommended procedure. Cute, eh?</p>
  <p>Building a compiler toolchain on a Mac with Fink, BTW, is impossible. They've 
    got GCC - both 3.3 and 4.0 - but literally almost *nothing* else that's required.</p>
  <p>In short, pretty bloody awful. It kinda smells like *nix, even sorta resembles 
    it... but falls way short when there's any real work to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Kapil]]]</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> Me: I'd just like a terminal window.<br />
      Mac user: What's that?<br />
      Me: A window where you type commands.<br />
      Mac user: What are commands?<br />
      Me: Things you tell the computer to do.<br />
      Mac user: You can actually tell the computer to do things? The Mac doesn't 
      work that way. You point and click and it guesses what you want to do and 
      just goes ahead and does it.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>At this point each of us walks off in disgust+surprise at having met an alien 
    right here on earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Don't even bother asking; they won't have any idea. Just hit 
  'Apple-F' in Finder, type 'Terminal', click on the icon, and do your work as 
  they sit there in utter bafflement. :)</p>
<p>[[[[[Breen]]]] - Don't forget to drag Terminal.app to the Dock so that it's 
  there when you need to fix something the next time...</p>

<p> <strong>Just wondering if there is a simple (complex? Any?) solution to viewing

  difference. Certainly, my min. is much larger ... 16 as opposed to your 12.

  <p>Does anything here leap out?</p>

<p>[Francis] - Is that because text 1/6th of an inch high is too small for you 
  to read, or because 12pt-text on your display is not 1/6th of an inch high?</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>If the latter, you may see some benefit from telling your X how many dots-per-inch 
    your screen actually uses. For example, a 19&quot; diagonal on a 4:3 aspect 
    ratio monitor (a TFT screen, for example) means the horizontal size is about 
    15.2 inches; if you display at 1600x1200 pixels, that's about 105 pixels per 
    inch. </p>
  <p>If X then believes you're displaying at 100 pixels per inch, everything measured 
    in inches will be about 5% smaller than it should be. For text at the edge 
    of legibility, that's enough to push it over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Ben]] - Not only that, it'll usually result in a bad case of the jaggies 
  (aliasing) in text when X tries to interpolate that fractional size difference. 
  This definitely _will_ make marginally-legible text unreadable.</p>
<p>[[Bob]] - Well, probably a bit of both. I can not read 1/6&quot; lettering 
  anymore. Used to ... but that was when I was younger can could do a lot of things 
  I can't now. Of course, I could break down and get glasses to see the screen, 
  but I'm resisting. I already need to put on cheaters when I read a book, etc 
  (mind you, I seem to manage not to badly in bright light). Ahh, the joys of 
  aging. But as someone told me: aging beats the alternatives.</p>
<p>[Francis] - &quot;xdpyinfo&quot; will tell you what X thinks the current dimensions 
  and resolution are. If they don't match what your ruler tells you, you should 
  consider reconfiguring.</p>
<p>[[Ben]] - [Nod] If there's one thing I've learned from playing around with 
  all the X resolution configuration options, it's exactly that. As a testimonial 
  from the positive side of things, once I got X resolution properly synched up 
  with the actual screen size, I was able to switch to 1280x1024 without any problems. 
  Previously, that mode produced unreadable text in many applications. </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>(Yes, I'm aware that I could tweak ~/.gtkrc, etc. I found it ridiculous that 
    I would have to - and, once I got X configured correctly, I didn't have to. 
    I like for the world to make sense, at least sometimes. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Bob]]] - And I learn that the interface between user programs and X is hopelessly 
  broken. Now, we are not going to fix that little issue :)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I have discovered one thing in Firefox: in the menu bar there is a &lt;view&gt;&lt;page 
    style&gt; which (I think) lets you diable the css stuff (not clear, but I 
    think that is what it does). At least, doing that I can get rid of all overlaying 
    text.</p>
  <p>But, the interesting thing is that now matter what I do the page I was trying 
    to view presents itself with overlaying text. If I turn off the min. text 
    size completely I can get text too small for any mortal to read, but it still 
    overlays. I've also installed additional fonts (namely some msfonts collection), 
    but that doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>
  <p>Oh well, perhaps we should just let ugly find its own home :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Francis] - If the problem is broken absolute positioning code, the quick answer 
  is to use a browser which ignores absolute positioning code.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I don't see anything obvious in the firefox about:config page to disable 
    that bit of their rendering or layout engine, though. If you accept that (a) 
    you will see their content in a layout they did not expect or desire (which 
    is already the case); and (b) you *will* see their content (which is not already 
    the case), use a browser with CSS support which tries to be perfect at the 
    &quot;ignore it completely&quot; end of the scale, rather than any which try 
    to get to the &quot;implement it all correctly&quot; end. I'll mention w3m 
    and dillo, but I'm sure you'll be able to find one that suits you. (These 
    other browsers do have their own quirks and configuration requirements, so 
    depending on how your distribution set things up, you may have some testing 
    and learning to do before things work the way you want them to. And it's also 
    possible that things *won't* work the way you want them to, no matter what.)</p>
  <p>w3m -- the content seems all there, but the links are a bit tough to follow 
    (because of the design choices they made: &lt;a href=link&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; 
    src=img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doesn't leave much clickable space for the link).</p>
  <p>dillo -- the content seems all there, and the images seem all there. Just 
    not both where the designer might have hoped. Keep scrolling down...</p>
  <p>For contrast: my firefox, in my &quot;normal&quot; config -- some text/text 
    overlap, but nothing major obviously unreadable; with 16pt minimum text -- 
    lots of unreadable bits because of text/text and text/image overlapping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - There's a large number of pages on the Net that are badly broken WRT 
  layout; however, over time, I've discovered (much to my surprise) that<br />
  *other*, less- (or even un) broken pages exist as well. Based on this amazing 
  fact, I've developed a strategy: as soon as I encounter the former, I do a bit 
  of clicking, or even typing, and I'm soon looking at the latter. :)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Seriously - truly bad layout can make a page nearly unusable, which is much 
    like not having the info in the first place. Given that much of the data on 
    the Net is available in multiple places, I consider finding an alternate site 
    - rather than trying to curse my way through</p>
  <pre class="code">
  {
     font: 3px bold italic &quot;Bloody Unreadable&quot;;
     text-background: bright-white;
     color: white;
  }</pre>
  <p>that's half-hidden behind a blinking yellow &quot;THIS SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!!&quot; 
    GIF - to be a perfectly valid strategy, unless the info on that specific site 
    is truly unique. For me, it saves lots of wear and tear - and time.</p>
  <p>The above may seem obvious as hell to some, but lots and lots of people tend 
    to get hyperfocused on Must Fix This Problem instead of looking at alternatives 
    - I've done it myself, lots of times, and still catch myself doing it on occasion. 
    Larger context is something that usually bears consideration.</p>
  <p> My own default browsing technique consists of firing off my &quot;google&quot; 
    script, which invokes &quot;w3m&quot; and points it at Google.com with a properly-constructed 
    query. I page through the hits that Google provides, search until I find what 
    I want, and - if I really need a graphical browser to examine the content, 
    which is only true in about 5% of the cases - I hit '2-shift-m', which fires 
    up Mozilla and feeds it the current URL (since I've set &quot;Second External 
    Browser&quot; in 'w3m' to 'mozilla'.) I very, *very* rarely have to deal with 
    really bad layout since text mode prevents many problems by its very nature.</p>
  <p>(If the page really *is* unique, _and_ is badly broken, _and_ you really 
    need to view it in a graphical browser, _and_ you have to keep going back 
    there, Mozilla and Firefox have a plugin that allows you to &quot;edit&quot; 
    the HTML of a given site and remembers your edits locally. Whenever you go 
    to that page, your edits are auto-applied. Unfortunately, I don't recall the 
    name of the plugin... Jimmy, I think I learned about it from you. Do you recall 
    the name?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[Jimmy]] - Mozilla and Firefox let you override the CSS for any page you want 
  (user.css IIRC); there's also Greasemonkey for Firefox, which lets you <br />
  run your own javascript on any page.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Recently, I came across something that allows you to edit a web page and 
    save your edits as a Greasemonkey script: I'll pass on the link as soon as 
    I can dig it up.</p>

<p>[[[Predrag]]] - Platypus(<a href="http://platypus.mozdev.org">http://platypus.mozdev.org</a>)? 
  I also like Web Developer(<a href="http://www.chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/">http://www.chrispederick.com/work/webdeveloper/</a>)</p>
<p>[[[[Jimmy]]]] - That's it!</p>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>&gt; &gt; I think the problem is one of expected font and font size. I use 
    a <br />
    &gt; &gt; fairly large min. size ... but don't know if this is the problem 
    or not.</p>
  <p>It would often be a problem, yes. Many sites are laid out so that there's 
    no room for the expansion necessary to accomodate larger text.<br />
    <br />
    ( http://www.yahkkingsgate.homestead.com/) Looks totally fine in 'w3m'. Oh, 
    and if I want to view it in a larger font, I simply Ctrl-right-click my xterm 
    and set the fontsize to 'Large', or even 'Huge'.</p>
  <p>This is why I prefer to use the 'Tab' key in 'w3m' rather than clicking the 
    links: it never misses, no matter how small the link. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Bob]]] - Yes, reformatting and rewriting broken code is always an option 
  :)</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>But, really, the &quot;problem&quot; is that a guy using a cheap (relatively) 
    out-of-the-box windows system can view these sites just fine (I'm assuming 
    here since I have not tried it). And, one fellow here says it views fine with 
    his Firefox. So, I have to assume that something on my setup is buggering 
    up things.</p>
  <p>I get lots of overlays when viewing the site. Nope, not the end of the world 
    by any means. But, this is not the only one and I guess I was in an easily-annoyed 
    mood yesterday :)</p>
  <p>Since starting this thread I have added extra TT fonts, played with my resolutions 
    and the font settings in firefox. Gotten some &quot;interesting&quot; results, 
    but none which fix the problem.</p>
  <p>Oh well, life does go on without reading badly formatted html!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Karl-Heinz]]] - opera also has that option of using user-css -- which means 
  switching off the regular css and having basically no styling at first. Then 
  you can swtich on some default CSS sheets like high-contrast b/w or w/b,... 
  This helps on many sites to make them quite readable and usable -- if the site 
  works without css that is. If they broke the layout so badly that the page (links,...) 
  won't work unstyled I usually refuse to stay at that site. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> And yes: I also have a rather large min. font size and that *does* lead 
    to trouble when boxes stay fixed but the text gets (much) larger then intended 
    by the designer. I'm a strong advocate of fluid box layout which adapts to 
    font changes ;-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[Bob]]]] - I'm quite convinced that being able to specify absolute positioning 
  or absolute font size in html is a dumb thing. No idea why people think it <br />
  is necessary. Interesting that at one time html was supposed to be browser agnostic.</p>

<p><strong>Heck, I can't even get the Opera help pages.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have tried disabling all my firewall settings, but that has no effect. 
  Besides, that is silly since firefox and konqueror both work just fine. I just

<p><strong>SOoooooo ... any idea why opera is being such a pain? BTW, I had version 
  8 installed and just tried a 9.0 beta. I've dumped my .opera file.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I suspect that there is a proxy or firewall issue, but am no expert 
  in this. Suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>[Neil] - Have you followed the advice above? Does opera have a proxy server 
  setup (if you click F12 is there a tick by &quot;enable proxy servers&quot;)?</p>
<p>[[BobV]] - Thanks Neil. Yes, I have tried that. Just checked again, and there 
  is NO tick beside that option. Just to test, I clicked on the option, but the 
  tick does not appear. Which is probably just as well since I don't have a proxy 
  server set up.</p>
<p>[[[Neil]]] - The error messages you were getting sound like those I got when 
  I had Opera set up to use privoxy and it wasn't running. It seems that network 
  access is not an issue, as you say konqueror and firefox are both working OK, 
  but it sounds as though opera is having a problem with network access.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>As it's a beta, you may be best asking on one of the opera newsgroups hosted 
    at news.opera.com</p>
  <p>Sorry I couldn't help more.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Ben] - A couple of things to try:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>1) Fire up a web server on your machine and try surfing to http://localhost 
    - even if you somehow, somewhere magically created a firewall without knowing 
    about it, you should still be able to get through to your own host.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[BobV]] - Nope. Not on any of my browsers. I assume that is since I don't 
  have apache (or other) server running. But that should not effect web access?</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Bob, you've got to read _every_ part of what's been written. If 
  you don't fire up a web server, then you can't expect to surf to 'localhost' 
  - there won't be a web server there. It wasn't a question of affecting web access 
  but of testing your browser's ability to connect to a server *known* not to 
  be behind a firewall.</p>
<p>[[[[BobV]]]] - Opps. Yes &quot;web server&quot;. Okay ... I don't need one 
  on my system and I've not time to go though and install a full blown server. 
  Is there something simple I can install just to test this?</p>
<p>[[[[[Karl-Heinz]]]]] - what do you use for printing? If its a cups server, 
  try: http://localhost:631/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>2) Look at a local file. I.e., try a URI like file:///etc/hosts - that will 
    tell you if your browser is capable of rendering anything at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[BobV]] - Yes, that works with everything, including opera. I can view pages 
  stored on my system with opera.</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - OK, so rendering works - that's a plus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Ben] - </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&gt; I have tried disabling all my firewall settings, but that has no effect. 
    <br />
    &gt; Besides, that is silly since firefox and konqueror both work just fine. 
    <br />
    &gt; I just tried lynx and it works fine as well.</p>
  <p>Well, it's obviously in Opera itself. However, whether it's something hosed 
    in the settings - shouldn't be, but you never know - or the app itself is 
    dead, you can't really tell without experimenting.</p>
  <p>&gt; SOoooooo ... any idea why opera is being such a pain? BTW, I had version 
    <br />
    &gt; 8 installed and just tried a 9.0 beta. I've dumped my .opera file.</p>
  <p>Hmmm, *beta*. Dangerous waters you swim in, Bob... :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[BobV]] - Well, remember that I did have a non-beta installed. That didn't 
  work either. So, that's when I tired the newer version with the same problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Ben] - If you really want to see all the files that Opera sources as it starts 
  up - which may be a bit more than just that .opera file - you should run 'strace' 
  on it and look for &quot;open&quot; calls, like so:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre class="code">   strace -o opera.strace /usr/bin/opera</pre>
  <p>or wherever your executable is. Then, open &quot;opera.strace&quot; and search 
    for lines starting with &quot;open&quot;:</p>
  <pre class="code">   grep '^open' opera.strace | less</pre>
  <p>You may find some interesting clues in there.</p>
  <p>Conversely, if you just want the thing to work (as opposed to fixing the 
    problem), then just revert to the last working version you used. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[BobV]] - okay. Did this with -eopen and -econnect. But, nothing obvious shows 
  up.</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - What do you mean by &quot;nothing obvious&quot;? I'm certain that 
  there are _some_ files that Opera is opening as it starts up.</p>
<p>[[[[BobV]]]] - I meant &quot;nothing obvious TO ME&quot;. Maybe you can see 
  something in the <a href="misc/lg_mail/opera1.txt">attached log file</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[[BobV]] - I think I'll just be content to use firefox :)</p>
<p>[[[Ben]]] - Well, as I've said - you have to know what your goal is. If it's 
  just to use a browser, then there are plenty of options (including using Firefox.) 
  If you're trying to figure out the problem with Opera, then you need to do some 
  troubleshooting - which is what we've all been pointing you toward. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[[Thomas]] - This is why strace has an '-e' flag:</p>
<pre class="code">   strace -eopen -o opera.strace opera</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>It's a pity Opera isn't dumping core, as that would have been much easier 
    to remedy. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[Neil]]] - I would have thought connect would be more interesting than open. 
</p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - I see both as useful, certainly - it would be interesting to 
  see which 'connect' fails - but I think the 'open' calls should come first in 
  the troubleshooting stack. If there's some sort of a configuration file that's 
  left over from the previous install of Opera, it would be a good idea to &quot;neutralize&quot; 
  it while testing. Also, seeing that a given 'connect' fails rarely tells you 
  why it has done so, whereas an 'open' failure always reports the reason.</p>
<p>[[[Neil]]] - Also /usr/bin/opera is a script on my system, so the -f option 
  to follow children would be essential to get anything useful from strace. </p>
<p>[[[[Ben]]]] - Ah - good point. I've never used Opera under Linux, so no way 
  for me to know, but definitely a good thing to keep in mind. As well, it may 
  make<br />
  sense to just run the executable that the script calls; I recall a Mozilla startup 
  script (the last time that I installed Mozilla from a tarball) that was seriously 
  broken, but the browser itself ran just fine.</p>
<p>[[BobV]] - [Quoting Ben]</p>

<blockquote> 
  <p>Now Opera. 1st time I tried it I got the same &quot;can't access&quot; error. 
    Well, I'm pretty sure I did. I just tried it again so I could copy down the

    can go though the various cups options in opera, until I go to the download 
    software item which brings up:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[Brian]]]]]]] - It sure feels like a proxy problem to me. Works fine 
  on localhost stuff, but not out to the world? When Firefox works to the outside 
  world? I will go to the wall on this one - let's see if I can get Opera running 
  on this Gentoo AMD64 setup...</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>{cue Jeopardy music}</p>
  <p>Okay, emerge search shows Opera 8.5 available via portage. Installing pulls 
    in app-emulation/emul-linux-x86-qtlibs-2.2 (needed because of the AMD64-ness)</p>
  <p>And here we go ... http://portal.opera.com/startup/</p>
  <p>That just works (tm).</p>
  <p>Now: In Firefox (which you say is working), Select from the menu Edit -&gt; 
    Preferences. On the General tab, click the connection settings button. What 
    does it say there? Of the 4 options (Direct connection, Auto-detect proxy, 
    Manual proxy, Automatic proxy), which radio button is enabled? If it says 
    that Direct Connection is the way, well then. I'm confused. If. OTOH, one 
    of the others is selected, and you can translate those settings to Opera's 
    Tools -&gt; Preferences: Advanced Tab, Network, click on Proxy Servers dialog, 
    then maybe this will have been some help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]] - Yup, &quot;Direct Connection&quot;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>I'm confused as well :)</p>
  <p>CHecking (again) opera under Tools-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Network 
    it says to click for setting proxies if not connected directly to the internet. 
    Double checking that, these fields are all empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[Brian]]]]]]] - Odd that lynx works, if proxying is on. What does</p>
<blockquote> 
  <pre class="code">   echo $http_proxy</pre>
  <p>yield, from the commmand line?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]] - Nothing. Nor does &quot;set | grep -i htt&quot;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> Just to summarize some things:</p>
  <p>- this all worked just fine before I upgraded from dialup to my new connection. 
    I had a 8.x version installed (which worked fine). When that didn't work with 
    the new connection I dl'd 9.0 beta ... but the results are identical.</p>
  <p>- every other net aware program I've used so far (Thunderbird, Firefox, Bittorrent, 
    gtk-gnutella, ntpd ...) all work just fine.</p>
  <p>- the only things I did when the new &quot;modem&quot; was installed was 
    to use the Mandriva wizard to set up the ethernet. As soon as the connection 
    was established, everything worked. The only thing I didn't need to do was 
    to dial in.</p>
  <p>My only other GUESS is that it is something to do with my connection. The 
    broadband connection is Ka satellite. I did check with the provider, but they 
    had nothing on the help system for Opera problems.</p>
  <p>Also, I've checked a number of web references and did find some stuff similar, 
    but they appear to be of the windows + proxy type.</p>

    &gt; &gt;What do you mean by &quot;nothing obvious&quot;? I'm certain that 
    there are _some_<br />
    &gt; &gt;files that Opera is opening as it starts up.<br />
    &gt; <br />
    &gt; I meant &quot;nothing obvious TO ME&quot;. Maybe you can see something

  <p>Well, you did say that you blew all that away - so presumably, all of the 
    above got created fresh.</p>

    O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)</p>
  <p>Hmmm... could be time to upgrade that JRE version. Mozilla gave me lots of 
    grief until I did, anyway.</p>
  <p>You're right; doesn't seem to be anything obvious. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[BobV]]]]]] - Cool. Got thttpd running. Serves out the thttpd &quot;got 
  it working&quot; message in both firefox and opera. Firefox will take me to 
  the program's web <br />
  site; opera just hangs (seemingly forever).</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Doing a bit more playing and I've another hint here.??? When you launch opera 
    try a web address it hangs. Apparently forever (at least more than 5 minutes). 
    Try the same address, same behaviour. Try another address and you get the 
    &quot;unavailable&quot; error message. From that point on accessing anything 
    external brings the &quot;unavailable&quot; message.</p>
  <p>I'm really starting to think it is a network problem due to my satellite 
    connection. But, that really does seem silly. Doesn't it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[Ben]]]]]]] - Well, it can't be the network since the other browsers 
  use the network without any problems. It sounds as though the code that does 
  the<br />
  socket-related functions in Opera is broken (which makes Neil's suggestion of 
  checking the 'connect' calls a better guess than mine. :)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just out of curiosity, try this:</p>
  <pre class="code">   strace -f -o opera.strace -e trace=connect `which opera`</pre>
  <p>The resulting file should be pretty short - and might show exactly where 
    Opera is falling down. If it does, that would be a bug report that Opera developers 
    might be very happy to see.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]] - Okay. <a href="misc/lg_mail/opera2.txt">Here it 
  is</a>. Hope it means more to you than to me :)</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[Ben]]]]]]]]] - </p>
<pre class="code">   &gt; 18802 connect(3, {sa_family=AF_FILE, path=&quot;/tmp/.X11-unix/X0&quot;},   19) = 0
   &gt; 18810 +++ killed by SIGKILL +++</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>*That* looks like the dude. When Opera makes that call to the X socket - 
    which, BTW, you should check to make sure that it exists and is usable:</p>
  <pre class="code">   ben at Fenrir:~$ ls -l /tmp/.X11-unix/X0 
   srwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 2006-03-17 11:29 /tmp/.X11-unix/X0

  <p>- that subprocess in Opera dies (perhaps it's killed by some kernel process 
    for trying to corrupt the stack? That's just a SWAG on my part, and you'd 
    need to do a full 'strace' and look at the calls that would have been between 
    18802 and 18810.) I would venture to say that it's internal to Opera rather 
    than the library that does the 'connect' call; there's lots of other stuff 
    that would break if 'connect' itself was at all buggy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]] - Thanks again for taking time to work though this little 
  mystery.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[Ben]]]]]]]]] - You're welcome, Bob. [grin] I have lots of fun with 
  this kind of detective work; helps me improve my own troubleshooting skills 
  for when I need them.</p>
<p>[[[[[[[[[[BobV]]]]]]]]]] - Just to close this thread out :) I have reinstalled 
  my linux distro (Mandriva 2006), downloaded Opera 8.5 and it connects/runs just 
  fine. Honestly, I have no idea what the original problem was ... but I suspect 
  that something broke when I changed from a dialup/ppp system to using the new 
  connection (satellite with a LAN modem). I really do wish I knew what the problem 
  really was ... but that'll have to remain one of the many mysteries of life!</p>

Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>

<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found full of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler.
