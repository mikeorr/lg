<p>It has been a very busy year for the Linux Professional Institute. At
shows and convention
halls around the world, people are interested in Linux*, and people
want to know more about where Linux is headed and the demands that will
be placed upon the administrators of these systems. The spectrum of the
interested Linux participant runs the full scale. From the outright beginner
who doesn't have a clue what all the buzz is over this new operating system,
to the down and dirty hands on faster than a speeding bullet kind of person;
everyone wants to be a player in the Linux game.
<p>The audiences for the Linux Professional Institute have been enthusiastic
and engaged. It seems everyone has a different opinion of what is truly
needed within the Linux community. But one thing that most seem to agree
on, that as Linux grows in demand, more professionals will be needed, and
a standard for competence is the best approach to ensuring qualified professionals.
<p>Linux appears no longer to be a fringe operating system. The representation
at COMDEX/Linux Business Expo in Las Vegas of 47,000 square feet and the
participation of the attendees from COMDEX was a sight to behold. Tens
of thousands of people toured the Linux related companies and I am sure
that the result will be in sales. As sales continue to increase for these
companies, a demand will be generated for Linux professionals. For the
Linux professional, having the right knowledge, the right tools, and the
right qualifications will be everything.
<p>And the Linux Professional Institute(LPI) has helped bridge the wide
gap between the many different players within the Linux professional ommunity
and the ever growing "newbie". The Linux Professional Institute; 
(<A HREF="http://www.lpi.org">www.lpi.org</A>)
 has been spreading the word about Linux and certification
of Linux professionals for the last two years. Their web site and related
information an now be read in French, German, Greek, Japanese, Polish,
Spanish, English.  Chinese is soon to be added, with more to come. All
of this has been
done with volunteers from around the world. LPI continues to be organized
and run with the help of thousands of people from every part of the globe.
<p>Japan just recently went online with 
<A HREF="http://www.vue.com">Virtual University Enterprises (VUE)</A>
for the Linux Professional Institute's tests for certification of Linux
administration. This was a milestone within the Linux community. The Japanese
are embracing Linux in a big way, and they believe in the certification
process. LPI views the interest in Linux in Japan, as one more piece of
evidence that Linux is here to stay. There is currently an LPI- China being
started by a group of professionals and educators in China. Sponsors have
been contacted and enthusiasm runs high for this group as they ready to
embrace their Linux audiences.
<p>Enthusiasm and a sense of community has taken hold for the Linux Professional
Institute. A lot of work remains to be done, and anyone interested in participating
or volunteering their expertise or time should contact 
<A HREF="mailto:wilma@lpi.org">wilma@lpi.org</A>,
<A HREF="mailto:dan@lpi.org">dan@lpi.org</A> or 
<A HREF="mailto:info@lpi.org">info@lpi.org</A>. The organization continues to
work on the next set of exams to be administered. Level two testing is
scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2001. Stay tuned to the web site for
further details.
<p>The Linux Professional Institute invites all Linux enthusiasts and professionals
to participate in their certification exams and
become known as an LPI -1, LPI -2 or LPI -3 Professional. This certification
is currently being recognized by IBM, SGI, HP,
SuSE, and TurboLinux, a partial list. Since the first exam was taken;
just a few months ago in June; there have been exams taken in almost every
part of the globe. The top five countries (for most tests taken, in descending
order) were the U.S, Germany, Canada, Netherlands, and Japan. But, there
were participants from Taiwan, Switzerland, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Brazil,
Bulgaria, China, Ecuador and many more.
<p>As has been the case for the last two years, 2001 appears to be even
busier for LPI. January brings the Linux Professional Institute to Amsterdam,
and New York, then to Paris in February. The rest of the year will ontinue
on this pace with appearances around the globe. To follow our movements,
