<p>
Tired of script-generated logs cluttered with escape
characters all over the place?
</p>

<p>
Try to change the terminal into "dumb" and repeat:
<pre class='code'>
$ export TERM=dumb
$ script
&lt;do whatever necessary to be logged&gt;
&lt;type exit or press Ctrl-D&gt;
$ export TERM=xterm
Switch back to vt100, xterm, or other when you're done, to recover your
terminal's original mode.
</pre>
Observe the generated log:
<pre class='code'>
$ cat -A typescript
 
mulyadi@mushu:/tmp$ ls^M$
gconfd-mulyadi^I^I  mc-mulyadi^I ssh-tYecBM5768^M$
gedit.mulyadi.3088662139  orbit-mulyadi  Tracker-mulyadi.5855^M$
keyring-HzVeHi^I^I  plugtmp^I typescript^M$
mapping-mulyadi^I^I  sqlGIskW0^I virtual-mulyadi.SGmoJb^M$
</pre>

<p>
Note that we see ^I, ^M, and so on, because of the -A option on "cat". This
is needed so we are sure there are no escape characters there.
</p>

I don't think "cat -A" is standard.  And indeed the canonical approach
to this has always been:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
script -f foo
$ blah
$ ls
$ sudo rm -fr / # :P
^D
 
$ col -bx &lt; ./foo &gt; ./foo.transcript

Heh. Here's a cute-but-stupid (in a "watch me cut my leg off with a
chainsaw - WHOOPS!" way) trick:
</p>

<pre>
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ &gt;-rf			# Create a file called '-rf'
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ mkdir xyz		# Create a directory called 'xyz'
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ &gt;xyz/foobar	# Create a file called 'foobar' in 'xyz/'
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ ls -1F
-rf
xyz/
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ rm *
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ ls
-rf
</pre>

<p>
Note that 'xyz', even though it was non-empty, is gone - and '-rf' is
still there.
</p>

  that policy would also keep them from doing clever things.

This is not specific to 'script', but - if you just want to set a
variable's value for the duration of a given program, the syntax works
like this:
</p>

<pre>
TERM=dumb script
</pre>

<p>
Doing it this way means that there's no need to reset it at the end (I
note that your second invocation would have set it incorrectly for my
terminal - which is indeed an xterm):
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ TERM=dumb bash
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ echo $TERM
dumb
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ exit
exit
ben@Tyr:/tmp/foo$ echo $TERM
linux
</pre>

<p>
Incidentally, 'TERM=none' appears to work just as well as 'TERM='dumb'.

This usually works well in BASH, but I'm not sure other shells support this 
syntax?
</p>

<p>
Also a badly setup .bashrc may set TERM to what it thinks is right. If that 
happens, you're stuffed whichever method you use to change $TERM. If you have 
a .bashrc that overrides variables that you don't want changed, you can always 
wrap them like this:
</p>

<pre>
if [ -z "$TERM" ]
then
  TERM=vt666

Any Bourne-derived shell will.

The only time that I'm aware of when TERM isn't set is when you login
via maintenance mode (and I'm not even sure of that one on Linux -
Solaris does this). Modern shells all set their own TERM values, too.
I'm not being snarky, but I really would like to know: in what situation
would this be useful?

True, but most people calling a script will be unlikely to do that.

I'm sure I have seen people blindly overriding TERM in their .bashrc's. OTOH,
that could just be my memory playing tricks on me?

<p>
It's not something I would recommend, but, if someone insists, "I have to make 
sure it's set" and I can't apply a clue bat, then this allows them to make 
sure it's set without overriding anything that's already set.

No -- it used to be a common trick for people with weird
term{cap,info} entries, although this is almost always the wrong way
to fixing things.

Ah. Ah-hah! A light dawns. I can see how someone could go haring off in
this direction - and, as you say, it's the wrong one. Thanks - this is
kinda like one of those tech-support horror stories...

That makes sense - it's the sort of "solution" that I've applied in the
past (harmless, but pacifies the idiots[1]). Oh, and since I just taught
a class on Bash (BTW, "Learning bash" is the first truly awful book I've
seen from O'Reilly), here's the Bash way to do it:
</p>

<pre>
${TERM:=some_value}		# Set $TERM to 'some_value' if it's empty
</pre>


<p>
[1] I take a certain grim pleasure from implementing this kind of thing
- although I do it with a put-upon air, much gnashing of teeth and
(careful) rending of hair, and finally a hang-dog look of defeat. This
gives the idiots tons of satisfaction (they *won*!) and makes sure they
never bother me about this issue again (given what a hassle it was the
last time.)
</p>

<p>
I just love these little corporate games. That's why I'm a consultant.
