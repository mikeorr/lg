<p>
Hello everyone and welcome once more to The Answer Gang.  Last month I
was quite stressed out about some overly broad attempts to curtail our 
freedoms, in case "bad guys" might try to use those freedoms wickedly.
There's a thread on the topic in the 
<a href="lg_mail72.html">Mailbag</a> (one reader didn't like
how I described Dmitry's case) and the <a href="lg_bytes72.html">News Bytes</a>
section has more legal details to cringe about.

</p><p>
In the mail processing space, my pet peeve of the month goes back to those
darn Quoted Printables and HTML attachments.  We've gotten some Spanish
and Italian letters and those really do need to be that way.  (Thanks, 
we can barely recognize things in those languages, but it's so much easier
to give to the translators when it hasn't been mangled.)  But all of you
english speakers need to tell your web browser to stop doing the double 
mail thing.  It's three or four times the bits, and the HTML is utterly 
useless to my processing efforts.  So do yourself a favor, and spend those
recycling electrons on something else.

</p><p>
In the real world space, well, that's it.  Space, the final frontier.  Do
you know that the United Nations had a holiday of their very own declared
a few years ago, called "World Space Week" ?  You probably didn't.  And that
would be because the television media loves to beat on one exciting story
until it's gone past "exciting" and all the way down to "wouldn't rent the 
video from the cheapies rack".  The paper press likes the AP wires because
they don't have to go chase stories, just reformat them a little.  Where's
the real News out there?  Obviously Space isn't news... since there hasn't
been another pair of feetprint on the moon since I was too young to know
what a TV was.

</p><p>
I asked the Gang, since we're a well scattered bunch, what we do to get real
news when we know we're being spoonfed "human interest" timeslices.  Believe
me, this doesn't just happen to US news - editors in other countries "slant"
the stories to satisfy some invisible "market segment" instead of actually
serve up the news itself.  Mike grumbled that if we got even a few articles
translated straight instead of "cleaned up to please western ideas" it
would be worth a lot more.  The answers were pretty solid:  we get enough 
buzzwords to search on a little, then if possible, we hit the internet for 
a news site in the country of origin.  And we read news sites from more than 
one country regularly anyway.  I say "if possible" because, well, it helps 
if the site offers its data in a language we can read...  Here's some of 
the favorites:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Canada: <a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/">www.globeandmail.com</a>
<li>Britain: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">news.bbc.co.uk</a>, the BBC
<li>Britain: <a href="http://www.the-times.co.uk/"
	>www.the-times.co.uk</a>, the Times
<li>USA: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/"
	>www.nytimes.com</a>, New York Times Online
</ul>
<p>Breen adds the valuable comment that we must apply approrpriate filters
as we read - consider the source, and what things they will prefer to bias
towards.  People will express their preferences;  the corporate entity in
charge of the paper will have its say in peer pressure and even just the
headlines they choose.  Still, "the problem with too much of the American 
press is that they apply the filter '&gt; /dev/null' to nearly all foreign 
news. If I never see the news at all it doesn't matter what the perspective
of the publisher is."
</p>

<p>So now I'll turn away from the social ill of talking about newsmen instead
of coming up with some news, or failing that, something to talk about and
get people thinking.  
</p>
<p>I started getting interested in CAD a while back.   Maybe
I'll design my own little space capsule, plan that back patio we're going to
put some changes in... someday ... or speculate on where the new "Enterprise"
keeps the bathroom.  Unfortunately for me, CAD tools for Linux come in four
categories: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>Cirvuitboard design.  Must be everybody's first project in the second
	year of college.  There are lots of these.
<li>Poor excuses for MSwin paintbrush.  Obviously started in a jolt cola
	moment but not finished in a weekend and therefore never finished.
<li>Think I'm already a masters degree in drafting, so I understand all their
    widgets and dots without docs.  
<li>support tools for 3d modelers, mostly experienced ones. 
</ol>

<p>Now sadly, this means I can't give it the fun "unusability test" romp that
I did to word processors a while back.  While I'm not an utter babe in the
woods* in this space, I'd have to say my skills are... well, rustier than my
Spanish, at least I see that once in a while.  But circuitry is not even in
my scope, if they are trying to be paintbrush I can do better with The Gimp,
and for the other two, yes darnit, I'm going to need those docs translated
down a notch or two, or find where they stashed the glossary.  Category 3
looks like it will suit me best, and by the time I can use it, the 3d stuff
will be fun.  But for right now, all I wanted was some ways to stick to a 
grid and drop little "tree" "wall" and "door" icons among my distance marks.
Dia is starting to look good;  as soon as I can grok its XML symbol language
(anybody have a Gimp plugin for these things?  xfig conversions?  anything?)
maybe I'll feed it some really weird stuff and start layout out D&amp;D
wizards' halls again.

</p><p>
If you're working on a CAD project out there, I have a hint for you:  if it
remains easier to do all this on ten-to-the-inch grid paper, I'm not going
to be using your stuff.  Also, I've not a fear about buying software that does
things well, but I'm not an aircraft design shop, you can't be charging me
omegabucks** to see if I can plot out my garden better before springtime, and
you're not going to get me to pay you to discover I can't figure you out.  So
for you commercial types, I recommend making the quickstart guides available 
for taste testing.  In fact you should <em>have</em>*** quickstart guides, 
that put you through putting some sample item or place together. For you 
free-world coders, get some first year drafting students to try and make 
sense of that gibberish;
anytime they say "huh?"  treat it as a bug just as serious as broken menu 
items.  We can only draft when our mechanical pencil actually has lead in 
it...</p>

<p>Hmm, there's a fellow who mentioned he's got a new documentation site up
(mentioned in the mailbag this month); time for me to see what he has lying 
around in the category!</p>

<dl>
<dt>*I used to help my Dad design scoutships for our Traveller games.
<dt>**omegabucks:
	I just made that up.  Lots of dollars including my last one.
<dt>*** to be fair some do... so if you don't your competitors are
	already ahead by one.
