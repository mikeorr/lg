Part computer programmer, part cartoonist, part Mars Bar. At night, he runs
around in a pair of colorful tights fighting criminals. During the day... well,
he just runs around.  He eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's sleepy.

Science, Magna Cum Laude from the University of Maine.  In 1994 he brought
the commercial Internet to the State of Maine by founding the oldest Maine
ISP.  He spells grey with an 'e', never wears watches, hates  mushrooms,
reads books, and collects minerals.

A cyberjack-of-all-trades, Ben wanders the world in his 38' sailboat, building
networks and hacking on hardware and software whenever he runs out of cruising
money. He's been playing and working with computers since the Elder Days
(anybody remember the Elf II?), and isn't about to stop any time soon.

I live and work in Bratislava, Slovakia as a library
information worker, translator and research reader at the Institute for
Child Psychology.  I published some of my poetry here and in USA, I
translated some books from English (e.g., Zen Flesh, Zen Bones by Paul
Reps). You can see some of my stories and poetry at

<H3>Spams I have known</H3>

<H4> Some of the funnier spams found in the <EM>Gazette</EM> mailbox.</H4>

<P> I have got your e-mail from the Web site and I am very interested in working
for your company. I have a BS in Electrical Engineering and computer science
and worked on my Master degree in Telecommunication engineering (not finished
due to the lucrative market!).

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>

certainly not been soliciting for engineers. -Mike.]

<P> Hello Again answerguy!  If this message has reached you in error,
please use the removal link at the end of this e-mail.  However,
I will do my part by keeping you informed...

<HR WIDTH="40%" ALIGN="center"> <!-- ************************************** -->

<P> Imagine how wealthy you would be now if you owned a chunk of a company like
Yahoo or Hotmail. You would be loaded.  However, if someone had contacted you a
few years ago and offered you the opportunity to own a slice of one of these
companies, what would you have done?  I will tell you. You would have ignored
the chance because you would have considered it a get-rich-quick scheme and
relegated the proposal to the trashcan.

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[Darn right.  -Mike.]
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Well, in January a brand new online community <EM>(name)</EM> is being
launched and it is generally felt, by people who know about these things, that
it is going to be as big, if not bigger, than the companies I have mentioned.

<P> I am offering you a chance to be part of this Company for FREE!  True,
there is an opportunity to invest $25, if you want to increase your earning
power, but that choice is purely optional.

<P> You can condemn this message to the waste bin, but if you decide to do
this, remember: in a few years time when [the company] is really big--you
had the opportunity to be on board for no cost and you just couldn't be
bothered.

<P> This IPO company is reserving a portion of the shares offered for sale to
individual investors and will not sell these shares to institutional investors.
Shares will be sold on a first come first serve basis; you will not be bumped
for a large investor!  It is anticipated that the offering will close within
the next 30 days.  Any Subscription Agreement received after the deadline will
be promptly returned.  You need not purchase through a stockbroker and there
are no commissions to be paid.  Only a few investors have been chosen to invest
in the IPO of a revolutionary company that may change the way real estate is
sold.
