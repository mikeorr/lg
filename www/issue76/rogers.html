<EM>I finally have time (after a few years) to give back a little more to
the Linux community with the next in my series of articles on the Standard
C Library.&nbsp; I hope that you enjoy.</EM> </p>
       
<p>The <A HREF="../issue41/rogers.html">last article</A> was on &lt;assert.h&gt; 
diagnostics for programmers.&nbsp; 
  This article is on &lt;string.h&gt; string handling.&nbsp;&nbsp; C is not 
  much better at handling strings than machine code, so machine language programmers 
  will feel quite at home in this section.&nbsp; There are many limitations 
  and problems with string.h that will be addressed in the appropriate function 
  descriptions. </p>
       
<p>I am assuming a knowledge of C programming on the part of the reader.&nbsp; 
  There is no guarantee of accuracy in any of this information nor suitability 
  for any purpose. </p>
       
<p>The example is <a href="misc/rogers/rogers_example07.c">
    rogers_example07.c</a> .&nbsp; This is a basic example that will demonstrate
  each of the string functions.&nbsp; If you compile it and run it you will
  be able to see the output. &nbsp; Compare the output to the code and enjoy. 
  </p>
       
<p>As always, if you see an error in my documentation please tell me and I
will correct myself in a later document.&nbsp; See corrections at end of
  the document to review corrections to the previous articles. </p>
       
<p><b>WARNING:</b>&nbsp; Copying strings in C is the most dangerous part of
programming in C.&nbsp; C itself doesn't perform bounds checking, so it is
very easy to overwrite the end of a string and actually overwrite other variables
or even to crash the program.&nbsp; Crackers use this weakness in C and inexpert
coding practices to perform controlled overflows to force programs into giving
them a shell to the account that the program is running under.&nbsp; This
is usually root for most servers. </p>
       
<p>C doesn't really have strings.&nbsp; I know that is a strange thing to
  say in a document talking about string handling in C, but it is true.&nbsp; 
  What C does have is an array of characters.&nbsp; To make space for a string 
  you can ask the compiler to reserve room for that string.&nbsp; The most 
 common way is with a simple character array: </p>
       
<p><tt>char string[17];</tt> </p>
       
<p>This reserves room for 16 characters and an end-of-string marker. </p>
       
<p><tt>strcpy ( string, "This is a string" );</tt> </p>
       
<p>Will work to copy the static string "This is a string" into the space that
we allocated.&nbsp; The static string is composed of 16 characters followed
  by the ASCII nil character.&nbsp; So there is plenty of room in the variable
  called string to hold the static string.&nbsp; Nil is typically represented
  with the number zero or with the character '\0' or with the character '\000'. 
  </p>
       
<p>Surprisingly the following will sometimes work as well, even though there 
  are more then 17 characters copied into the char array: </p>
       
<p><tt>strcpy ( string, "This is a long string" );</tt> </p>
       
<p>There is never any bounds checking when you are copying strings.&nbsp; 
  So even though you went past the end of string and wrote to memory in an 
 unexpected way, most of the time you can get away with it.&nbsp; Of course 
 your program can also unexpectedly crash at anytime as well, sometimes in 
 a place far away from the place where you made your error.&nbsp; Crackers 
 can get a shell from the computer by overwriting the end of a buffer in such
 a way that the program executes a shell.&nbsp; This is one of the reasons 
 that you should really not use strcpy.&nbsp; Use strncpy instead: </p>
       
<p><tt>#define&nbsp; MAX_STRING_LENGTH&nbsp; 17</tt> <br>
    <tt>char string[MAX_STRING_LENGTH];</tt> <br>
    <tt>strncpy ( string, "This is a long string", MAX_STRING_LENGTH );</tt>
    <br>
    <tt>string[MAX_STRING_LENGTH-1] = '\000';</tt> </p>
       
<p>The reason that I used a macro for the string length is that I am using 
  this length in many places in my program, if I ever decide to change the 
 size of the variable string I would have to find everywhere where I used 
the number 17 and fix each one.&nbsp; Sometimes you may use the same number 
in different places to mean different things.&nbsp; So even if you only use 
a literal number in a few places using a macro can make the meaning of that 
 number really stand out and it makes it trivial to change the size of the 
 string buffer in this case. </p>
       
<p>The reason that I put the last line there is that if the literal string 
  is longer than the string that we are copying into then the end-of-string 
  marker isn't put into place.&nbsp; If you don't set the final character 
to null, most of the time you will be fine, but every once in a while your 
program will crash and you will wonder why. </p>
       
<p>There is also a third way to define a string and that is with malloc, realloc
and calloc.&nbsp; These functions work by requesting the memory that you
need at runtime.&nbsp; This is the most complicated but also the most flexible
and powerful. </p>
       
<p><tt>#define STATIC_STRING "This is a long string that will be copied into
  a location during runtime"</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>char *string;</tt> <br>
    <tt>int string_length;</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>string_length = strlen(STATIC_STRING);</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>if (!(string = (char *) malloc ( string_length ))){</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; /* no memory left, die */</tt> <br>
    <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; exit (1);</tt> <br>
    <tt>}</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>strncpy( string,&nbsp; STATIC_STRING, string_length);</tt> <br>
    <tt>string[string_length] = '\000';</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>/* do something with the string */</tt> </p>
       
<p><tt>free(string);</tt> </p>
       
<p> </p>
    One of the dangers of this method is that you have to clean up after
yourself,   using the free function. &nbsp;If you don't free everything when
you are  done with then you will be leaking memory and eventually your program
will  crash.<br>
       
<hr noshade>     
<p>The &lt;string.h&gt; library has numerous problems. </p>
       
<p>The biggest problem is that the library was never designed to be complete 
  and consistent.&nbsp; &lt;string.h&gt; really is a collection of functions 
  written by various people, assembled into a library and given to the world. 
  &nbsp; And now we are stuck with it. </p>
       
<p>Most of the functions can return a NULL or a pointer to a string.&nbsp; 
If a function <EM>can</EM> return a NULL, you should always check the return
value after calling it, and take appropriate action if it is NULL.&nbsp; If you 
attempt to treat a NULL return value as a pointer to a string, you will quickly 
crash your program. </p>
       
<p> </p>
       
<hr noshade>     
<p>I have arbitrarily grouped the functions into sections according to task,
to show the slight differences between similar functions.  One could also
group by string functions vs memory functions, but that seemed less useful.

<p><b><font size="+1">Copying</font></b> </p>
       
<ul>
      <tt>#include &lt;string.h&gt;</tt>             
  <p><tt>void *memcpy(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);</tt> <br>
      <tt>void *memmove(void *dest, const void *src, size_t n);</tt> <br>
      <tt>char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);</tt> <br>
      <tt>char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);</tt> <br>
    &nbsp;</p>
       
</ul>
     <tt>void *dest</tt> is a pointer to the array which will receive the 
copy.   <br>
    <tt>char *dest</tt> is a pointer to the string which will receive the 
copy.   <br>
    <tt>const void *src</tt>&nbsp; is a pointer to the array from which the 
 copy will be made. <br>
    <tt>const char *src</tt> is a pointer to the string from which the copy 
 will be made. <br>
    <tt>size_t n </tt>is the number of characters to be copied.     
<p>These functions all return a pointer to dest.&nbsp; Which is strange, because
you already have a pointer to dest. </p>
       
<p><b>memcpy</b> copies n characters from the location pointed at by src to
the location pointed at by dest.&nbsp; Don't copy areas that overlap or your
program will crash. </p>
       
<p><b>memmove</b> also copies n characters from the location pointed at by
  src to the location pointed at by dest.&nbsp; But it first copies the characters
  to a temporary location then into the final location, so this is the function
  to use if you are copying overlapping areas of memory. </p>
       
<p><b>strncpy</b> copies no more than n characters from the location pointed 
  at by src to the location pointed at by dest.&nbsp; This function will stop
 at the first null character, which may be at any location less than or equal
 to n. If n characters are copied and no null is found, no null is written.&nbsp;
 This is a great way to leave the end of a string open.&nbsp; You should
always  explictly write zero to the end of the string. </p>
       
<p><b>strcpy</b> copies the string pointed at by src to the location pointed 
  at by dest, including the ending null character.&nbsp; <b>Warning! Never
  use this function for data that comes from the real world !!!&nbsp;</b>
&nbsp;   The biggest danger of using this function is that if there is no
null character   you will happily go copying through memory until you randomly
find a null   or you access memory that doesn't belong to your process and
the process  is killed with a SEGV (segfault) signal.&nbsp; Programs can capture this signal
and shutdown,   but at this point you are so hosed that it is best just to
let the program   core dump. </p>
       
<p>I have already given a few examples of how to use strcpy and strncpy.&nbsp; 
  memcpy and memmove are used exactly like strncpy, but they can copy arbitrary
  blocks of bytes, not just strings. </p>

</ul>
     <tt>char *dest&nbsp;</tt> is a pointer to the string which will receive 
 the copy. <br>
    <tt>const char *src</tt>&nbsp; is a pointer to the string from which
the   copy will be made. <br>
    <tt>size_t n</tt>&nbsp; is the number of characters to be copied. <br>
    &nbsp;     
<p><b>strcat</b> appends the source string, including the final '\0', onto 
  the end of the destination string. It overwrites the trailing '\0' on the 
  end of the destination string. </p>
       
<p><b>strncat</b> does the same, except it will only copy at most n characters 
  from destination and it will append a '\0'. </p>
       
<p>Both <b>strcat </b>and <b>strncat</b> return a pointer to the destination 
  string. &nbsp;Again, there is no bounds checking on the resulting string,
  so make sure that the string you create isn't too long to fit in the memory
  you have allocated for it. </p>

    <tt>const void *s1</tt>&nbsp; is a pointer to the first memory array. 
<br>
    <tt>const char *s2</tt>&nbsp; is a pointer to the second string. <br>
    <tt>const void *s2</tt>&nbsp; is a pointer to the second memory array.
 <br>
    <tt>size_t n</tt>&nbsp; is the number of characters to be copied.   
 
<p><b>memcmp</b> compares the number of bytes given by n.&nbsp; If&nbsp; s1
is less than s2, return a value less than zero.&nbsp; If s1 is equal to s2,
return zero.&nbsp; If s1 is greater than s2, return a value greater than
  zero.&nbsp; The comparison is based on the byte values of the ASCII characters
  in the memory array. </p>
       
<p><b>strcmp</b> compares the two strings s1 and s2.&nbsp; A string is a
null terminated array of characters.&nbsp; If&nbsp; s1 is less than s2, return
  a value less than zero.&nbsp; If s1 is equal to s2, return zero.&nbsp;
If   s1 is greater than s2, return a value greater than zero.&nbsp; The comparison 
  is based on the byte values of the ASCII characters in the two strings. 
</p>
       
<p><b>strncmp</b> is very similar to memcmp, except that it compares the two
strings, up to the length given by n.&nbsp; If a string is shorter than n,
than the memory locations following n are not compared.&nbsp; If&nbsp; s1
is less than s2, return a value less than zero.&nbsp; If s1 is equal to s2,
return zero.&nbsp; If s1 is greater than s2, return a value greater than
  zero. </p>
       
<p><b>strcoll</b> compares the two strings s1 and s2.&nbsp;&nbsp; If&nbsp; 
  s1 is less than s2, return a value less than zero.&nbsp; If s1 is equal 
to s2, return zero.&nbsp; If s1 is greater than s2, return a value greater 
than zero.&nbsp; The comparison is based on the locale that is set with the 
setlocale() function in the &lt;locale.h&gt; library.&nbsp; I will cover this
library in a later article. </p>
       
<p><b>strxfrm</b> transforms string s2 based on the locale category LC_COLLATE.&nbsp; 
  It then copies n bytes into string s1.&nbsp; Finally it returns the number

<p>The <b>strtok</b> man page says that there are a lot of problems with this

string and divides it up into tokens.&nbsp; The first call to the function 
  has string s as its first argument and returns the first token.&nbsp; After 
  the first call the function is called with NULL as the first argument and 
  the function continues to return each token in turn until a NULL is returned 
  when there are no more tokens.&nbsp; The delimiter can be changed with each
 call, or can be kept the same through all the calls.&nbsp; The limitations 
  of this function are many;&nbsp; the function modifies the original string 
  s, the value of the delimiter isn't retained between calls and the function

<p><b>rindex</b> returns a pointer to the last occurrence of the character

 strrchr(), it performs the exact same function, in a portable manner. </p>

<p>"putchar writes a character to standard out.&nbsp; putchar(x) is the same

<p>&nbsp; Actually I think that I even got the capitalization wrong, I believe
  that it should be "fputc(x, <b>stdout</b>)"&nbsp; The example program is
 correct because I compiled and tested that for correctness. <br>

<p>Dear Sir, </p>
       
<p>in <A HREF="../issue31/rogers1.html">The Standard C Library for Linux, 
Part Two</A> you wrote </p>
       
<p>"&nbsp;&nbsp; char *fgets(char *s, int n, FILE *stream); </p>
       
<p>char *s the string that will hold the result. <br>
    int n the maximum number of characters to read. <br>
    FILE *stream is an already existing stream. <br>
    . <br>
    . <br>
    . </p>
       
<p>fgets reads at most n characters from the stream into the string. </p>
       
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; char s[1024]; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FILE *stream; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if((stream = fopen ("filename", "r")) != (FILE *)0)
 { <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while((fgets(s, 1023, stream)) !=
 (char  *)0 ) { <br>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } " </p>
       
<p>but fgets() actually reads up to n-1 characters, so it always has room 
  <br>
    for the \0 (if n is set to the array size). </p>

<p>I didn't know snprintf, but I think that it is a clever thing to <br>
    do to avoid overflowing the string buffer (much better than the evil
<br>
    sprintf). </p>
       
<p>But that the first time I see it in a C library, so is-it a Linux only 
  <br>
    function or is-it a "new" standard function which wasn't included in
<br>
    HP-UX for example. </p>
       
<p>Maybe you could distinguish in your article, the standard library <br>
    function and those Linux only. </p>
       
<p>Anyway this snprintf function is "A good Thing" TM. </p>
       
<p>Thanks for your articles, they are very well-written and very <br>
    informative. <br>

    &nbsp; I think that it is a GNU only thing.&nbsp; So you may want to
avoid   using the snprintf function unless you only want your programs to
work in   a GNU environment.&nbsp; I found a bunch of very useful GNU only
string functions  and will taking your advice on pointing out those functions
that are only  found in Linux. <br>

    (to get the desired result of "99.1" - you need space for the null char)

<p>Hi, </p>
       
<p>your code in Linux gazette is missing the setlocale() function call at
  the <br>
    beginning. That&acute;s why you don&acute;t get any <br>
    useful results for characters above 127 as programs start out in the
C  locale  by <br>
    default. Also, isalpha(), toupper() <br>
    and tolower() are not restricted to the A-Za-z range. </p>
       
<p>Regards, <br>
    J&ouml;rgen Tegn&eacute;r </p>
       
<p><b>Reply:</b> <br>
    &nbsp; Absolutely right, I am saving setlocale() for when I cover &lt;locale.h&gt;.&nbsp; 
  :) </p>
