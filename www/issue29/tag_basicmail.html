<p><strong>From Greg on 15 May 1998

Hi again Answer Guy!
<br><br>
 	I E-Mailed you about a week ago regarding getting a 
<a href="tag_netcard.html">network card</a> to work under Redhat 5. I found 
that the problem was the motherbourd I was using (Intel al440lx) which 
after a bit of examination I found didn't work under NT with a network 
card either. Now with justa standard 166 I can reach my NT network fine 
and they can reach me too.

	Glad you tracked it down.

 	My question for you this time is how I would set up email to be routed 
 through my linux box between a NT network? I have read through a few of 
 your tutorials (<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue14/procmail.html"
	>mini-procmail</a> and other letters) but I am still left a 
 little confused.
 
<br><br>
 	I attempted to send mail between the linux box and an NT box and while 
 the mail sent eventualy, it was very slow (took 2 mins). I am sure this 
 is a fairly simple thing to fix so your help would be much appreciated.

	Two minutes is not slow for e-mail.  Also '<tt>procmail</tt>' is a 
	mail processing language --- it's geared for handling mail as it's
	delivered to the local machine.  To get your mail to other
	machines you need an MTA, such as '<tt>sendmail</tt>' (the most widely
	used: <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/">http://www.sendmail.org/</a>
 	or <a href="http://www.sendmail.com/">http://www.sendmail.com/</a>), 
	'<tt>qmail</tt>' 
	(<a href="http://www.qmail.org/">http:/www.qmail.org/</a>), 
	'<tt>vmail</tt>' (<a href="http://wzv.win.tue.nl/vmail/"
	>http://wzv.win.tue.nl/vmail/</a>), '<tt>exim</tt>' 
	(<a href="http://www.exim.org/">http://www.exim.org/</a>), or 
	'<tt>smail</tt>' (<a href="http://www.sbay.org/smail-faq.html"
	>http://www.sbay.org/smail-faq.html</a>).

<br><br>
	e-mail is a complicated subject.  However, there are a few
	LDP HOWTO documents to look at:

<br><dl><dt>The first and most obvious to read would be:
	<dd><a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Mail-HOWTO.html"
		>http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Mail-HOWTO.html</a>

</dl>
	You can browse around the other titles as you like.

<br><br>
	It should be noted that there is nothing unusual about handling
	e-mail under Linux.  All of the MTA's (transport agents, like
	'<tt>sendmail</tt>'), MDA's (delivery agents, like 
	'<tt>procmail</tt>') and MUA's (user agents like '<tt>pine</tt>', 
	'<tt>elm</tt>', and '<tt>MH</tt>') are all used on a 
	variety of Unix implementations.

I have procmail on my system but I don't seem to have the configuration 
files for it. Do I have to make my own or have I screwed up somewhere. I 
am sure you have covered this on other sections of your site so if you 
can links would be great just to point me in the right direction.

align="left" border="0">
	If your system is configured to use '<tt>procmail</tt>' as the local
	delivery agent then you can simply create a <tt>~/.procmailrc</tt> 
	script (that is a file named <tt>.procmailrc</tt> in your home 
	directory) to use it.  If not, you can create a <tt>.forward</tt> 
	file (as described in my 
	<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue14/procmail.html"
	>introduction to procmail article</a>) or you can reconfigure
	your MTA (probably <tt>sendmail</tt>) to change to it.

<br><br>
	The easiest way to tell is to simply create a <tt>.procmailrc</tt> 
	file, send yourself a slice of mail and wait until it's delivered.
	It should be pretty obvious if the script works (you refile
	the message to a folder, or you "split off" a backup
	copy of it with one of the recipes I described).

<br><br>
	However, you shouldn't have to create a '<tt>procmail</tt>' script 
	for simple delivery into your "inbox" --- it's used to create 
	auto-response scripts, and to do automated filtering, forwarding
	and filing.

<br><br>
	I'd like to say alot more about e-mail as it is one of the
	most important aspects of the Internet.  However, you may just
	have to wait for my book --- since that's how much there is
	to say on the subject.  In any event it sounds like your
	e-mail is working so you'll definitely want to be more specific
	if you have other questions.  

<br><br>
	The best place to post questions on this topic is under the
	<a href="news:comp.mail">comp.mail.*</a> netnews hierarchy.  
	Naturally you should look for the associated and 
	<a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/mail/misc/top.html">appropriate FAQ's</a> and just "lurk" on these
	lists for a little bit, to get some idea of what they are all
	talking about.

<br><dl><dt>The international repository of FAQ's on the web is at:
	<dd><a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/top.html</a>

</dl><dl><dt>... and for e-mail you'd want to look in:
	<dd><a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/mail/misc/top.html">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/bngusenet/comp/mail/misc/top.html</a>

</dl><dl><dt>Ohio State also maintains a wonderful repository of RFC's 
	<dd><a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/information/rfc.html"
	>http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/information/rfc.html</a>

</dl><dl><dt>Via FTP the magic FAQ site is still:
	<dd><a href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/">ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/</a>

</dl><dl><dt>... and for questions about e-mail you'd want to look in:
	<dd><a href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/faqs/mail/"
		>ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/faqs/mail/</a>

</dl>
	As I say --- there's nothing that's Linux specific about
	any of this.

<br><br>
	There's also an FAQ wannabe site (<a href="http://www.faq.org/"
	>http://www.faq.org/</a>) that has a miserable excuse for a search 
	engine and seems to point alot of queries off to the CIS 
	department at Ohio.  (Tsk, Tsk, they could at least
	mirror the docs if they're going to take that domain 
	name!). [Actually, they point at infoseek, and <strong>it</strong>
	points off to Ohio. About the same, really.]
