<h1>Linux's problem with Simplified Chinese</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>


<p>Chinese characters are used not only in Mainland China but
also in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, and sometimes in Korea and
other places.  There are differences in the way these
countries write certain characters, and ideally this should
just be a matter of selecting a different font.  However, for
various reasons some (but not all) of the "Simplified
Chinese" characters used on the mainland have been given
their own Unicode numbers that are different from the Unicode
numbers of their nearest equivalent characters in Japan, etc. 
This leads to a problem.</p>

<p>Imagine a typical text in Simplified Chinese. Some of the
characters have their own special code numbers that occur
only in Simplified texts, whereas other characters have code
numbers that can also occur in Japanese and other texts.  Now
imagine that a rendering system such as Pango is going to
render this text.  Pango takes the text character by
character, and tries to find each character in the available
fonts.  Suppose it first of all finds a character that occurs
in a Japanese font.  There is a Japanese font on the system,
so it takes that character from the Japanese font and renders
it.  But then the next character is not in the Japanese font
because it is a special Simplified character that occurs only
in a Simplified Chinese font.  There is a Simplified
Chinese font on the system too, so off it goes and renders
that second character from the Simplified Chinese font.</p>

<p>The problem is that some of the characters (the ones that
have special Simplified-only codepoints) will be rendered
from the Simplified Chinese font, but others (the ones that
share codepoints with Japanese etc) will be rendered from
another font. If the fonts happen to have the exact same
style and weight, etc., then nobody will notice, but usually
there are noticeable differences in style between the fonts,
so this mixing of fonts, with some characters taken from one
font and others taken from another, can make the display of
Simplified Chinese on Linux look very unprofessional.</p>

<p>Many users can tolerate this situation on the screen, but
printing is a different matter.  For example, the music
typesetting system GNU Lilypond uses Pango to render the text
of lyrics, etc., and if you want to produce beautiful-looking
copy with Simplified Chinese text, this
character-by-character mixing of fonts could be a
showstopper.</p>

<p>The Pango renderer does have facilities for application
programmers to specify the language and therefore influence
the choice of fonts, such as by calling
pango_context_set_language() or by using Pango markup. 
However, this is small consolation for those using
applications that do not expose this functionality to the
user.</p>

<p>One thing you can do is edit your <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt>
file to tell the system which fonts you prefer.  This will
affect all applications, so you may need to change it back
when you want to see Traditional Chinese or Japanese, etc. 
Below is a <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt> file which specifies the
Arphic Simplified Chinese font as a preference (Debian/Ubuntu
package <tt>ttf-arphic-gbsn00lp</tt>). It also specifies
DejaVu for the Latin fonts, along with Gandhari, a font which
is good for Pinyin markup.</p>

<pre>
&lt;fontconfig&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;serif&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;
            &lt;family&gt;gandhari unicode&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;dejavu serif&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;ar pl sungtil gb&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;sans-serif&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;
            &lt;family&gt;gandhari unicode&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;dejavu sans&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;ar pl sungtil gb&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;monospace&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;dejavu sans mono&lt;/family&gt;
			&lt;family&gt;ar pl sungtil gb&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;
</pre>

<p>On a Debian or Ubuntu system, most of the families can be
seen by looking at
<tt>/var/lib/defoma/x-ttcidfont-conf.d/dirs/TrueType/fonts.dir</tt>.
To install Gandhari, download it from <a
href="http://andrewglass.org/fonts.php">Andrew Glass's
site</a>, visit <tt>fonts:/</tt> in Konqueror (package
<tt>konqueror</tt> if you don't already have KDE) and drag
<tt>gur.ttf</tt> into that folder.</p>

<p>This approach does not solve everything; for example, the
on-screen display of Chinese in Tk applications might still
be inconsistent (it does not seem possible to set a preferred
<em>order</em> of fonts in Tk/X11; you can set <em>one</em>
preferred font but there's no obvious way to control what it
falls back on when displaying characters that are not
available in that font).  However, the use of <tt>~/.fonts.conf</tt>
should at least help with applications that you are likely to
use for printing.</p>
