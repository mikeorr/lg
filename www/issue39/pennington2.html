<B>What is Free Software, and Who am I?</B>

<P>
The main problems that most people had with <A
HREF="../issue37/pennington.html"> The Beauty of
Doubt</A> was that I was discussing open source- not free- software, and that
I made it seem as though I was the spokesperson for the Free Software Movement
(FSM). Please understand that it was not my intention commit either of these
errors.

<P>
Firstly, I am not a spokesperson for the FSM anymore than any other free
software proponent. <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/people/rms.html">Richard
Stallman</A> is the founder of the GNU foundation, and there a number of very
active <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/people/people.html">people</A> listed on
the GNU site, as well as hundreds of people who help regularly. I am
merely a member of a very large community, one that openly accepts the work
and opinions of all- even the newest rookies- provided it is open. I wanted to
present this series as a discussion by one of these members, not as the
"Mission Statement" of the FSM. Those new to this community are urged to seek
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">further information</A> before blindly accepting
my arguably flawed views.

<P>
Secondly, I want to assure everyone that I am indeed discussing <B>free
software</B>. I understand that <I>The Beauty of Doubt</I> only touched upon
the open source side of the coin, and most of this will be applicable to both,
but my views are meant to be specific to the free software community. I used
Netscape as an example in the final paragraph of the article. There, I was
hoping to show only that there were benefits to the free software model.
Unfortunately, I failed to mention
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html"> the problems</A>
with Netscape's public licensing policy.

<P>
I recently heard an interview on National Public Radio (NPR) about a "new
operating system that is an alternative to Windows." The interview was with a
computer expert and discussed, of course, Linux. Ignoring for the moment the
fact that Linux is by no means <I>new</I>, just "an alternative to
Windows" (implying that Windows is somehow the only/best operating system in
existence), or that it is even an entire operating system (Linux is the
kernel), I'd like to talk about a large error made by the interviewee (whose
name I have sadly forgotten). In his description of Linux, he stated that
Linux is free software, that the "free" meant freedom, and that the source
code was available. However, he went on to say that any software for which the
source code is available is "open source" and that this and "free" software
mean the same thing. This is meaningless slip for some, but a huge error for
those in the FSC.

<P>
For those new to the concept, <B>free software is open source, but not
all open source software is "free"</B>. I use the term free in parentheses
because the idea has little to do with money and everything to do with
freedom. <B>Open source software</B> means only that the source code for
the software is available. Fully proprietary software can be open source, a
quick perusal of the Linux Journal can show that. <B>Proprietary software</B>
is that which remains the intellectual property of the company. If I write a
proprietary program, it means that it is mine, all mine. I may charge you a
great deal of money to use it, but you are only <I>using</I> it. You only buy
the right to borrow proprietary software, you own nothing. Anyone who has
actually read a license agreement will understand this. This copyright holds
true regardless of whether or not I decide to show you how my program runs,
whether or not I show you the source code. Even if I allow you to modify the
program using the enclosed source code, it remains mine. If you look
carefully, you will discover that some companies try to tell you that any
modifications that you make belong to them as well. This is proprietary
software, open source or not, and it is something that the FSM
emphatically disagrees with.

<P>
<B>Free software</B> is quite different. If I write a program and designate it
free, then I include the code (like open source), but also relinquish
ownership. I designate the software as belonging to <I>everyone</I>. There are
a number of ways to do this, but the most often used is
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html"> copyleft,</A> which is a
way to use copyrighting to ensure that the software, and all of the changes
and additions, will be kept free from proprietary predators.

<P>

about, visit the GNU project's <A
