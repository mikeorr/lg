Hello my name is Bernie.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have a 16 year old son that is heading for big trouble on
the net while I am at work. I can not be in both places at
the some time to keep an eye on him. Do you know if there are
any programs that will run in Windows 98 that can copy the
key board buffer to a file that would let me read in a text
format. I would like the program to run at boot up and be
able to copy the buffer all day long. I believe reading his
keyboard buffer may be of some help to me.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please help, thank you for any help you my have to offer,
<br>Bernie in Los Angeles
</STRONG></P>

First, I'm NOT the "I want to spy on my children's use of MS
Windows" Guy!  I'm the Linux Gazette Answer Guy.

Of course, if you used Linux it would be pretty easy to
secure the system so that the Internet and the modem were
inaccessible during specific times of day or until specific
passwords had been typed.  It would even be possible to
configure filtering and access control (to monitor and limit
web access).  You'd probably need to invest in some
cabinetry (physically securing a PC generally involves carpentry).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your question has nothing to do with Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
More importantly your problem is much larger than any
software can solve.  No software in the world could possibly
make your son more trustworthy.  You cannot keep your kid
out of "big trouble on the net" by spying on his keystrokes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the muddled thinking that leads you to the fundamentally
flawed (and morally corrupt) notion that you should covertly
spy on your own teenage child using such software is typical
of your approach to parenting then its probably too late for
Bernie Jr.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I don't know what kind of "big trouble" you're trying to
protect the kid from.  If it's porn, keep in mind that porn
sites are generally accessed through a GUI browser --- which
are conveniently configured for one-handed operation (point
and shoot, so to speak).  If you're afraid that the kid is
"cracking" (sometimes erroneously referred to as "hacking")
and/or phreaking than any attempts you make to lock him out
of your Windows '98 PC will just be too pathetic.  If you do
successfully find out that he's been vising 'badboys.net'
what do you plan to do?  Confront him with your printouts?
Ground him until he's 35?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So what do you think the kid will do when he knows he's been
caught out?  Will it be an contest: your computer skills and
time against his?  Can he detect and bypass your futre
methods better than you can implement them? Will he go use
some buddy's computer?  Will he skip the virtual trouble of
the 'net and go out to get into trouble of a more dangerous
variety?  What will it do for the kid's opinion of you that
you don't have the balls to talk to him directly and that
you have to resort sneaking around on him?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The whole think is disgusting.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you can't trust the kid with the computer by himself ---
lock the computer is some room when you're not home or get
rid of it.
