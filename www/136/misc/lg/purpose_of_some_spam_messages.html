<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
I was just wondering if someone has thought about what is the purpose
of SPAM messages which only contain some mish-mash text. The
qualifying criteria are:
<pre>
	1. Only text without attachments.
	2. Text that contains incoherent sentences or disconnected sentences. [*]
	3. Definitely messages from addresses not known to the recipient.
</pre>
(The last is to exclude e-mail messages written by friends who are
not quite sober at the time of writing <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">).
</p>

<p>
Here are some possiblities that occured to me.
</p>

<p>
A. These are messages that are designed to test/mar the efficiency of
the spam detection systems currently employed by servers.
</p>

<p>
B. These messages contain coded messages that are flooded across the
internet in an attempt to disguise their true origin/destination. The
real message could be short one such as "the machine from which this
has been sent has serious security holes".
</p>

<p>
C. This is generated for someone's research project.
</p>

<p>
D. This is the result of some spam generating software/virus which has
   bugs.
</p>

<p>
I don't know if this is worth wondering about ... except ... why is someone
going to some trouble to make (a program which is making) life difficult
for everyone?
</p>

<p>
Pointers to prior discussion welcome.
</p>

<p>
Thanks and regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.
[*] Clearly (2) is subjective which makes such spam hard to detect
automatically.

</pre>

<p>
I'm guessing it's intended to poison ("untrain") Bayesian databases used
for spam-detection -- specifically, those there are set to "auto-learn".
</p>

<p>
The lesson is that you don't want auto-learn, but instead want to
periodically manually feed the Bayesian classifier spam and "ham"
(non-spam mail) to keep it on-track.
</p>

<p>
That of course will not, per se, do anything to intercept the gibberish
mails, but will prevent it from doing any harm beyond merely being
there.

You're forgetting so-called "image spam" whereby the message is as an
image, a kind of CAPTCHA, but not.

&gt; 
&gt; A. These are messages that are designed to test/mar the efficiency of

<p>
That's <strong>always</strong> the sole purpose of spam obfuscation.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; B. These messages contain coded messages that are flooded across the
&gt; internet in an attempt to disguise their true origin/destination. The
&gt; real message could be short one such as "the machine from which this

</pre>

<p>
That's a little bit of fiction, isn't it?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; C. This is generated for someone's research project.
</pre>

<p>
Heh.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; D. This is the result of some spam generating software/virus which has

</pre>

<p>
Unlikely.  Note that some spam messages don't even bother to hide the
fact that they're spam anymore.  Take the classic 'replica watches'
spam.  Years ago, you'd only get away selling fake watches if you
pretended they were real and genuine.  Now, spam doesn't even bother to
do that, instead making the person away they're fake is a bonus.  ;)

&gt; I don't know if this is worth wondering about ... except ... why is someone
&gt; going to some trouble to make (a program which is making) life difficult
&gt; for everyone?
</pre>

<p>
Because they're appealing to the mass of AOL users who generally don't
know one plug-end from another.  The law of averages says that at least
one of them will be taken in by it.

&gt; Here are some possiblities that occured to me.
&gt; 
&gt; A. These are messages that are designed to test/mar the efficiency of
&gt; the spam detection systems currently employed by servers.
</pre>

<p>
I don't think that the "testing" idea plays out very well, actually;
most of the possibilities seem to be non-winning ones.
</p>

<p>
1) A server such as Qmail, as described by Rick in
<a href="../../../131/moen.html">http://linuxgazette.net/131/moen.html</a> is going to do the Great White
shark act and swallow anything directed to it, thus producing no useful
data for the spammers.
</p>

<p>
2) The average Joe's mail server isn't going to be configured in any
sensible way even though it could be - same response, same lack of data.
</p>

<p>
3) A server set up to use the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) will usually
reject the message (given that spammers usually try to forge their
addresses) - but this is not content dependent, so the rejection <strong>still</strong>
gives no useful data. In addition, some of these smart folks are going
to be teergrubing the idiots spamming them - so that firing blanks of
this sort just accumulates data on the <em>receiving</em> end, which will then
be used to tarpit the buggers. To put it mildly, that will still not be
a useful result to the spammers.
</p>

<p>
4) Some small percentage of servers will indeed be configured to a)
check for compressed pork content and b) reject it with a "polite note"
(e.g., a 554.) This might allow spammers to tune their garbage... but
that data would be poisoned by the fact that the 554 is just as likely
to be based on the source IP as on the content.
</p>

<p>
If we postulate, however, that one of the above-mentioned drunks or
philosophers (it can be difficult to tell, sometimes...) uses Qmail -
those facts may even be related <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> - and decides to answer the
gibberish, perhaps by arguing with it, then some spammer-usable data
could result. You must admit, though, that this is a low-percentage
possibility; there must be some other reason. Perhaps, as has been
mentioned here, the "cache poisoning" effect is what they're trying for.
</p>

<p>
As far as I recall, SpamAssassin at least has auto-learning disabled by
default. Does anyone here have any data on other Bayesian filters
policies?  Perhaps most importantly, Bayesian filters on Wind0ws
machines and (e.g.) Yahoo's spam filters? I suspect the latter is
intentionally shrouded in Deep Mystery - given how "effective" the
'security through obscurity' tactic has proven to be.
</p>

<p>
(The practice of "always fighting the last war" is, alas, not solely the
province of the Pentagon; the habit of reacting rather than acting in
time with intent and intelligence is far too common of a characteristic. 
Hell, I guess if Breitenfeld and Kasserine Pass aren't enough of a clue
for the brass hats, then we certainly shouldn't expect the average
Micr0s0ft-certifried /soi-disant/ "system administrator" to do any
better...)
 
</p>

&gt; I don't know if this is worth wondering about ... except ... why is someone

<p>
I've just taken a look at the spam in my spam bucket; out of the rather
large pile of messages in there, not a single one matches your
description. The ones that contain gibberish either have an image
attachment (the majority of these appear to be stock promotion schemes),
some "real" text following the gibberish (pharmaceutical/herbal ads), or
- and this is rather cute - a bunch of fake HTML/XML tags interspersed
with the ad text (e.g., '&lt;this&gt;Bu&lt;is&gt;y ou&lt;fake&gt;r Vi&lt;html&gt;ag&lt;crap&gt;ra').
The latter tend to be rather rare, which is a data point in figuring out
the level of sophistication of the average spammer (still fairly low.)
If you have one of these emails handy, and could make it available by
posting it somewhere and providing a link, I'd like to examine it.

Oops. Just cleaned out the "junk" folder. Doubtless more will

This kind of spam is really quite rare but here is an example:

I suspect that it's a broken attempt by a spammer that didn't quite work
out - much like the ones titled "[VAR114]" (or something similar) that
end up in my spambucket. Spammers don't do their experiments in a
sandbox; their crap, whether successful (i.e., carrying their payload)
or not, ends up scattered all over the Net.
