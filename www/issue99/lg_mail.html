Hi Gang,
I asked another question around one month ago and even though I could not
come up with a answer I decided to come up here again.(Incidentally I
tried it also in linuxquestions.org).
What would be the equivalent to the zsh script given below in bash
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$echo ${${(z) $(whereis libcrypto)}[2]}
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
if the output of $(whereis libcrypto) is
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>libcrypto: libcrypto.so libcryto.a
it returns libcrypto.so only.
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Now I could come up with
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$robin=($(whereis libcrypto)); echo ${robin[1]}
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
But can it be done in one go using some construct?
I am not a shell guru so I wonder if it can be done!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Robin

<P><STRONG>
--My question is, what are clusters good for besides graphics /

interested in)? Can I gzip/ bzip2 compress a 4-8GB tar file on a
distributed cluster and save time? Can I recompile a 2.4 kernel that
way so it doesn't take an hour and a half? (Yes, even using "make -s

To the tiniest portion of an answer: there's a mosix aware variant of
Knoppix.  Check out LWN's Distributions page. (lwn.net/Distributions)
If you get things going, I agree wholeheartedly -- this could make a
really fun article by you about getting your cluster going.  Are you
suggesting that you could write this, or that you would like to see
the topic come up?

<P><STRONG>
Dear Ben, hello.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My name is Juan Carlos Diez, a novice Unix Sysadmin with no experience at all
with sendmail, who needs desperately your kindly help 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I read your sendmail notes on <A HREF="../issue58/okopnik2.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue58/okopnik2.html</A>
and I thought maybe you could help me.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Currently we have a <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> v6 server with sendmail v 8.9.3 running. We have
set a new server with Red Hat 7.3 and sendmail 8.11.6 in order to migrate all
of our services from the current server to the new one.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My question is: May I use the current sendmail.cf and sendmail.mc files in the
new server to avoid manually configuring sendmail again? I mean, to copy such
files to the new server and restart sendmail, do you think it will work fine?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you very much.
</STRONG></P>

Why have you not tested it yourselves? You certainly have nothing to loose
by doing so 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)"

using the configuration files. They're based in a rather interesting
scripting language called m4 which is a separate entity to sendmail.

I would disagree with a softening of the advise never to log in as root.
Respectively, I would remind that there are two types of Linux/Unix
Administrators --
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1. Those who have trashed the entire system by mistake.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
2. Those who will trash the entire system some time in the future.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Personally, I avoid logging in as root as much as possible, preferring
to su for a  brief perioed when necessary.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Kind regards
<BR>Tony Dearson
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
I don't see much difference between logging in as root vs su'ing.  Root
is root.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Ever dip your finger in liquid nitrogen, Mike? It's a geek thing, FSVO
"geek" (e.g., radars and black-body targets.) In-and-out, no problem.
Keep it there for a full second or so, and you'll have frostbite that
may require amputation. (Five seconds or so, and you'll be able to
shatter it like glass.) When you log in as root, <EM>everything</EM> you do -
and the chain of consequences that proceeds from it - is done as root,
and you must consider that consequence tree for every single command you
type including "ls". When I type a command, then realize that I need
root privs for it, I just hit the up-arrow, type:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>"&lt;Ctrl-A&gt;su -c "
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>think</EM> about the effects, and press 'Enter'. Somehow, typing 10
characters (7 if I know it beforehand) does not seem to me to be the
Sysyphus' burden (with a bit of Prometheus thrown in for effect) that
you insist it is.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
I hate typing
"su[Enter][password][Enter][command][Enter][ctrl-D]" all the time, or
even worse, "su -c 'command in quotes'[Enter][password][Enter]".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
[shrug] Everyone has their pet hates, of course. This does not in any
way correlate to what makes for reasonable system usage.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
I love
the fact that konsole has a "Root console" menu option, so I can get a
root session any time without using the arcane su syntax.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
In what way is it arcane? Is "-c" in some way connected to the Norse
Edda and the Boghaz-keuy Babylonian tablets? I wasn't aware. Molehill -&gt;
mountain requires a sufficient amount of dirt, and I'm afraid there just
isn't enough.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
(You do have
to type the root password, of course.)  Even with that, I usually leave
the session open in the background for a while in case I need it again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The most important thing I ever learned (from sysadmin Pann McCuaig if
he's reading) is, <EM>sit on your hands</EM> before pressing [Enter] after
any potentially destructive command like "rm -rf", "rsync", etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
[grin] I prefer to use my other end to control my hands when using root
privilege, thanks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
Make
sure you're the right user, on the right system, and in the right
current directory.  (Actually sitting on your hands is optional, but the
metaphor is good so you don't forget it.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If all that information doesn't appear in your shell
prompt, read the manpage for your shell and set PS1 or PROMPT
accordingly.  My favorite prompt strings for zsh are:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>PROMPT="%S%n@$HOST_:%~%#%s "
PROMPT2='%S%_&gt;%s '
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For root I use bash with these lines:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>export PS1='ROOT@`hostname`:`pwd`$ '
export PS2='&gt; '
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
I've done the following in my "~/.bashrc":
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/mailbag/ben.bashrc.txt">ben.bashrc.txt</a></tt></p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whenever I'm root, my text is all in red. Makes for a decent clue, hard
to miss.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
(Normally people use '#' to distinguish their root prompt, but I find
that too easy to miss.  I also need '$' to show it's bash rather than
zsh (whose conventional symbol is '%').
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Another important thing to remember is that "su -" gives you root's (or
anybody's) full shell environment,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
...so that $SHELL, and other ~/.profile
files, etc are sourced, as well as various other exported $VARIABLES are
updated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
while "su" alone gives you a partial
environment that doesn't include all their environment vars.  E.g.,
"echo $USER" (or "echo $LOGNAME" in some shells) shows your login rather
than root's.  That may cause some programs to do the Wrong Thing; e.g.,
'mutt' will read your mail rather than root's.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Thomas] 
Will not change $SHELL, and other variables.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This can be negated with the:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>su -m
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
switch.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Sluggo] 
(No, you still shouldn't
read mail as root anyway!  Put those dark classes back in your pocket,
Ben.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

to generate a list of files belonging to that package, and check the perms

I'm not sure where this should be shoehorned into our FAQs, but - having

Hi all. Just grabbed the #97 and am having some problems reading it on
Mozilla 1.6b on Mandrake 9.0. The navigation box overlays the first
several lines of each article. I played a bit with lg.css (which I don't
know anything about) and got it readable by outcommenting the line:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>	position: absolute;
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG><CODE>
at line 53.
</CODE></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Now, the article text overlays the nav. box. Not what you intended, but
it is readable... a <EM>real</EM> fix would be appreciated. Hey, this bug might
even spur me on to learn how to use stylesheets

[Mike] 
Thanks.  Our stylesheet editor, Rob Tougher, is away on family business,
and I have only a rudimentary knowledge of CSS.  Are the menu links
showing up one per line with a black bullet left of each?  And the
breadcrumbs (=Yahoo bar) too?  That was something I specifically fixed
yesterday, because our stylesheet fixes this month (for Netscape 4 and
Phoenix) broke compatibility with issue 97.  If you do "View Source" on
an offending page and scroll to the bottom, the menu links should <EM>not</EM>
have &lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt; around them.  If they do, your browser is caching an
obsolete version of the page.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I tried your solution but it breaks in my Galeon: it moves the menubar
to the very top, covering part of the logo and Tux.  While this is
readable, it's not acceptable.  Thanks for letting us know anyway, and
for any other ideas you might have later.

A new problem we have is that after I added the "Contact Us" link, the
menubar is extending too far to the right past Tux.  I couldn't figure
out how to prevent that.  Do you have any ideas?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Well, problem is solved. I dl'd the version on the site just now and it
works just fine. Guess I grabbed while you were putting, or something.
Thanks!

It's not supposed to be obvious; you were just shown a shortcut. If you
want to join, the what you're <em>really</em> supposed to do is read the TAG

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Good point - we should update the "About TAG" blurb on the mailman link

Thanks. We've been debating how much to change the back issues.
Plus it's a big job, and we can't change the mirrors that don't resync
back issues.
