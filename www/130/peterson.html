<h1>Custom OpenLDAP Schemas</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/peterson.html">Ron Peterson</A></b></p>

<h3>Editor's Note</h3>

<p class="editorial">As Ron notes in his article, the adoption of
LDAP has been rather slow despite its broad range of benefits; in
my experience as a consultant, much of the problem stems from lack
of general familiarity with the protocol, or even awareness of its
existence. To be fair, today's endless alphabet soup of protocols
is enough to bewilder and stump anyone - so it's unsurprising that
something this useful can get lost in the noise. However, if you
need an organization-wide authentication system, or a secure,
highly-scalable "White Pages" service for your company - i.e., the
ability to browse directories of structured shareable information
(user names, contact info, e-mail addresses, security certificates,
etc.) - then LDAP is custom-made for you, and Ron's introduction
just might make your initial adaptation a bit easier. Enjoy.<br>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>For some reason, in spite of LDAP's ubiquity, many of us are
still unfamiliar with all of its benefits. We have a Free LDAP
server in OpenLDAP, and LDAP-enabled applications are everywhere;
so what's the hang up? Among other things, the standard set of
attribute types and object classes included in the default OpenLDAP
schema files are maladapted to the requirements of many
applications. Fortunately, you can easily create attribute types
and object classes to fit your particular requirements, once you
get the hang of it. This article will attempt to get you
started.</p>

<p>I'm going to organize this article around a practical example.
Both Outlook Express and Mozilla Thunderbird can do address book
look-ups against an LDAP database. The trick is to figure out what
their respective LDAP look-ups expect to see when they perform
their queries. Once we know that, we can construct our own custom
LDAP object which will contain a set of attributes suitable for
both applications.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this article, I'm going to assume you have a
basic grasp of how to configure and run OpenLDAP. If not, there are
a number of <a href="#Res">resources</a>
available to help you brush up.</p>

<p>If you've never seen an OpenLDAP <a href=
"http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin23/schema.html">schema file</a>,
now would be a good time to take a look. They typically reside in a
sub-directory called 'schema' within your OpenLDAP installation's
configuration directory, e.g. /etc/ldap/schema. The schema file
names typically end with a '.schema' extension. If you have any
trouble finding them, try "locate" or "slocate":</p>

<pre>
slocate schema | grep schema$
</pre>

<p>This is also a handy way to discover schema files belonging to
other packages on your system that you might not have known
existed. Look around a bit, but before we start attempting to
emulate the definitions in these files, we must deal with an
important preliminary issue: we have to get our hands on some
OIDs.</p>

<h3>Object Identifiers (OIDs)</h3>

<p>The LDAP <em>attributetype</em> and <em>objectclass</em>
definitions you find in these schema files are each assigned a
unique object identifier called an <a href=
"http://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/index.html">OID</a>. OIDs look
like decimal delimited sets of integers, e.g. 1.3.6.1 (which
happens to be the Internet OID).</p>

<p>There is a lot that can be said about OIDs, but for our current
purposes, you must understand that you can't just use them
willy-nilly. There are a small number of registration authorities
responsible for allocating portions of the OID hierarchy. Hijacking
someone else's OID space is very bad form at best. Improper use of
the OID namespace could cause namespace collisions that break
things.</p>

<p>So then, the first hurdle we must deal with is getting our hands
on a portion of the OID space that we can use. We have a couple of
options:</p>

<ul>
<li>You might belong to an organization which has already
registered a portion of the OID namespace. Work the proper channels
to get your hands on a few.</li>

<li><a href=
"http://www.iana.org/cgi-bin/enterprise.pl">Register</a> for an
<a href=
"http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers">Enterprise
OID</a> with <a href="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</a>. The IANA
administered Enterprise OIDs fit into the OID hierarchy like this:

<ul>
<li>1 - ISO assigned OIDs</li>

<li>1.3 - ISO Identified Organization</li>

<li>1.3.6 - US Department of Defense</li>

<li>1.3.6.1 - OID assignments from 1.3.6.1 - Internet</li>

<li>1.3.6.1.4 - Private</li>

<li>1.3.6.1.4.1 - IANA-registered Private Enterprises</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>I have my own OID namespace registered under the name Yellowbank
(the name of a creek on the farm where I grew up). Yellowbank has
registered the following OID base with IANA: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25948.
It's up to me to decide how to use the OID namespace hierarchy
under this. I have elected to not use the 1.3.6.1.4.1.25948.1
branch of my hierarchy (see the <em>yNonUnique</em> OID Macro
below) for anything important, for example. That means that if you
were to happen to reconnoiter the use of OIDs under
1.3.6.1.4.1.25948.1, you would never run the risk of colliding with
a production Yellowbank OID. Of course, the second you start
thinking you might like to disseminate your work, or put it into
production, you would of course immediately register for your own
OID. I do <b>not</b> condone customizing any portion of the
Yellowbank OID space for any production purpose whatsoever.
Ahem.</p>

<h3>Playing Detective</h3>

<p>Now that we have our OID preliminaries out of the way, let's get
to work. The first thing we need to do is to figure out exactly
what our application expects from LDAP. How? Simple: watch
OpenLDAP's log file. First, make sure your OpenLDAP installation is
configured to log at a level sufficient to see the queries. The
slapd.conf configuration directive is 'loglevel'. For the examples
below, I have my loglevel set to 256. I also direct my syslog
daemon to put my slapd log in it's own file, by adding the
following directive to /etc/sysklogd.conf:</p>

<pre>
local4.*                /var/log/slapd.log
</pre>

<p>As the man page for slapd says, local4 corresponds to slapd's
default logging facility. You may need to adjust this directive to
match your installation.</p>

<h4>Thunderbird</h4>

<p>Let's configure Thunderbird to use our LDAP server for address
book queries: start Thunderbird, open the address book (Menu:
Tools/Address Book), and create a new LDAP directory (Menu:
File/New/LDAP Directory). What you enter here depends on your local
LDAP installation. It goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway,
that you need to be authorized to query the Base DN that you enter.
If you don't enter a Bind DN, then of course the Base DN will be
queried anonymously. If none of this makes sense to you, you need
to consult with your LDAP administrator. If none of this makes
sense to you and you <i>are</i> the LDAP administrator, you should
spend some quality time with some of the aforementioned LDAP
resources.</p>

<p>Once you've added your LDAP directory to Thunderbird's address
book, we can query the database (Menu: Edit/Search Addresses).
Create a query that includes every possible field, with a unique
search string for each field (click the '+' symbol to add
additional query conditions). I set up my query like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
Anyname | contains | MyAnyname
Display Name | contains | MyDisplayName
etc.
</pre>

<p>When you're all done, click the 'Search' button. We don't care
so much about the results returned, as we do about what the slapd
process logged. Open your log file in your favorite pager, so we
can see what happened. On my system, my log looks like this
(reformatted a bit to be browser friendly):</p>

<pre class="code">
Jun  9 11:08:12 ahostname slapd[13144]: conn=349441 op=1 SRCH
base="ou=my,dc=base,dc=dn"
scope=2 deref=0
filter="(|(cn=*myanyname*)
          (givenName=*myanyname*)
          (sn=*myanyname*)
          (?=undefined)
          (?=undefined)
          (cn=*mydisplayname*)

          (mobile=*MyAnyNumber*)

          (homePhone=*MyHomePhone*)
          (?=undefined)
          (pager=*MyPager*)
          (mobile=*MyMobile*)
          (l=*mycity*)
          (street=*mystreet*)
          (title=*mytitle*)
          (?=undefined)
          (?=undefined))
"Jun  9 11:08:12 ahostname slapd[13144]: conn=349441 op=1

</pre>

<p>The slapd log clearly shows us what attributes Thunderbird wants
to see returned. It also shows us which attributes correspond to
the fields in the Thunderbird query form. For example, the value of
the field labeled 'Any Name' in the query form is compared against
the 'cn', 'givenName', and 'sn' attributes.</p>

<h4>Outlook Express</h4>

<p>Now we do the same thing for Outlook Express. First add the
directory service (Menu: Tools/Accounts/Add/Directory Service).
Again, you'll either need to be familiar with your LDAP setup, or
consult with your LDAP administrator to ascertain the proper
settings.</p>

<p>To perform a query, open the Address Book, click 'Find People',
and select your previously configured LDAP provider in the pull
down menu. In the dialog that appears, click the advanced tab, and
enter:</p>

<pre class="code">
Name contains MyName
E-mail contains MyEmail
First Name contains MyFirst
Last Name contains MyLast
Organization contains MyOrg
</pre>

<p>Again, search your log file to determine what attributes are
requested, and to see how the filter expression corresponds to the
search dialog.</p>

<h4>Consolidated results</h4>

<p>My fancy ASCII table below summarizes what I discovered. The
leftmost column contains the intersection of the attributes that
Outlook Express and Thunderbird requested. I took the liberty of
doubling up attribute names like 'cn' and 'commonName' which mean
the same thing. The other two columns indicate how the search
dialogs map to those attributes. So we see that the 'E-mail' box in
the Outlook Express search form is queried against the 'mail'
attribute, for example.</p>

<pre class="code">

</pre>

<h3>Putting it all together</h3>

<p>Wouldn't it be nice if our LDAP directory were populated by user
objects that would make sense to both Outlook Express and
Thunderbird? Well, we now have enough information to do that. It's
time to put all the pieces together.</p>

<h4>The LDAP Schema File</h4>

<p>Your schema file can live anywhere your LDAP daemon can read it.
Edit the LDAP daemon's configuration file. On my system, it's
/etc/ldap/slapd.conf. The 'include' directives in this
configuration file load the schema files used by your LDAP
installation. These schema files typically reside in a
sub-directory of your configuration directory. On my system, they
are in in /etc/ldap/schema. We can put our new custom schema file
anywhere the LDAP daemon can read it. For the sake of consistency,
we'll put it in the same place as the rest of the schema files.
Verify your installation's schema file location by reviewing your
configuration file. Add an 'include' directive to your
configuration file as below. Don't <tt>kill -SIGHUP</tt> your server until our new
schema file is fleshed out, of course.</p>

<pre>
include         /etc/ldap/schema/yellowbank.sample.schema
</pre>

<p>While we're in the slapd.conf file, let's update our indices.
Add indices on whatever attributes you think you might query
frequently. Use the table above to assist you. Something like the
following might suffice, perhaps.</p>

<pre class="code">
index objectClass           pres,eq
index cn,sn,uid,memberUid   pres,eq,approx,sub
index givenName,mail        pres,eq,approx,sub
</pre>

<p>You can add indices later too, of course. Just be aware that
LDAP will <i>not</i> use new indices on an existing database until
you use the the 'slapindex' command.</p>

<p>Guess what? It's finally time to actually start editing our
schema file! What follows is basically just a colloquial summary of
the <a href=
"http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin23/schema.html">schema
specification information</a> available in the OpenLDAP Software
Administrator's Guide. The examples I give will be a partial
representation of what I have in my full 'yellowbank.schema'. You
can use the examples as they are, if you like; or you can adapt
them to your own OID space.</p>

<p>We'll begin by fleshing out a rudimentary OID hierarchy, and
giving these OIDs symbolic names, so that we don't have to remember
really long strings of integers. This is not strictly necessary,
you can use labels like 1.3.6.1.4.1.25948.4.2.1.1.2006.08.20.1 if
you like, but I prefer names I can recognize. We'll do this using
'OID Macros', like so:</p>

<pre class="code">
# OID Macros
#
# Yellowbank's IANA Assigned OID
objectIdentifier  yOID                        1.3.6.1.4.1.25948
#
objectIdentifier  yNonUnique                  yOID:1
objectIdentifier  yPedagogy                   yOID:2
objectIdentifier  yProduction                 yOID:3
#
# Note that OID's are used for more than just LDAP.
objectIdentifier  ypSNMP                      yPedagogy:1
objectIdentifier  ypLDAP                      yPedagogy:2
#
objectIdentifier  ypAttributeType             ypLDAP:1
objectIdentifier  ypObjectClass               ypLDAP:2
#
objectIdentifier  ypPersonAttribute           ypAttributeType:1
objectIdentifier  ypAssetAttribute            ypAttributeType:2
objectIdentifier  ypApplicationAttribute      ypAttributeType:3
objectIdentifier  ypFacilityAttribute         ypAttributeType:4
objectIdentifier  ypOrganizationAttribute     ypAttributeType:5
#
objectIdentifier  ypSakaiAttribute            ypApplicationAttribute:1
#
objectIdentifier  ypPersonObject              ypObjectClass:1
</pre>

<h4>A Custom Attribute Type</h4>

<p>Both Thunderbird and Outlook Express would like to see an
attribute called 'department' which, interestingly enough, is not
included in any of OpenLDAP's standard schema files. So let's
create it. Add the following to our new schema file after the OID
Macro section.</p>

<pre class="code">
attributetype ( ypOrganizationAttribute:1.2006.08.20.1
  NAME 'department'
  DESC 'Department Name'
  EQUALITY caseIgnoreMatch
  SUBSTR caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch
  ORDERING caseIgnoreOrderingMatch
  SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{128}
  SINGLE-VALUE )
</pre>

<p>What do we see here? For starters, I'm appending a unique suffix
to one of my defined OID Macros. There are no rules about how you
create OIDs, but I've adopted the convention of appending a
date.version to the unique integer string that identifies my
attributeType. In other words, my 'department' attributetype is
uniquely yOrganizationAttribute:1, and I follow this with a
date.version string which corresponds to when I edited my
definition. The main thing is that each OID must be unique, and
that the OID string is created by appending a colon and an integer
string suffix to our OID macro.</p>

<p>The Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar for attributetype definitions
can be found in the <a href=
"http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin23/schema.html">appropriate
section</a> of the OpenLDAP Manual. I'll briefly summarize the
definition above. Hopefully 'NAME' and 'DESC' are fairly
self-explanatory. The 'EQUALITY' line defines the matching rule
used in equality comparisons (case and space insensitive). The
'SUBSTR' line defines the matching rule used in substring matching
(case and space insensitive). The 'ORDERING' lines defines the
matching rule used in (you guessed it) ordering comparisons. The
'SYNTAX' line delimits valid input, where the given OID means
'Unicode string', and the {128} at the end limits input to 128
characters. The 'SINGLE-VALUE' line means that there can only be
one instance of this attribute in an object; in other words, this
is not a multi-valued attribute. Attributes are multi-valued by
default, so to create an attribute type which can contain multiple
values, simply omit this line.</p>

<h4>A Custom Object Class</h4>

<p>Assuming our slapd.conf includes any other requisite schema
files, which contain our other standard attribute type definitions,
we can now define our own objectClass.</p>

<pre class="code">
objectclass ( ypPersonObject:1.2006.08.20.1
  NAME 'ypContact'
  DESC 'Yellowbank Contact'
  SUP top
  STRUCTURAL
  MUST ( cn $ sn $ mail )
  MAY ( c $ department $ facsimileTelephoneNumber $ givenName $
        homePhone $ l $ mobile $ o $ ou $ pager $ postalCode $
        st $ streetAddress $ telephoneNumber $ title $ description ) )
</pre>

<p>Again, we see that our definition begins by assigning a unique
OID. Again, I hope that 'NAME' and 'DESC' are fairly
self-explanatory. I'll defer discussion of the 'SUP' line until a
bit later. The 'MUST' line indicates, as you might guess, the
attributes which must be present in objects defined with this
objectClass. The 'MAY' line describes optional attributes. Let's
create one more objectClass.</p>

<pre class="code">
objectclass ( ypPersonObject:2.2006.08.20.1
  NAME 'ypLoginAccount'
  DESC 'Yellowbank Contact'
  SUP ypContact
  STRUCTURAL
  MAY ( userPassword $ memberUid ) )
</pre>

<p>Notice that the 'SUP' line for this objectClass points to our
previously defined objectClass. In other words, our ypLoginAccount
objectClass extends our previous definition to include a couple of
new attributes. We have defined a chain of inheritance that looks
like this:</p>

<pre>
top &lt;- ypContact &lt;- ypLoginAccount
</pre>

<p>When we define objects, the objectClasses we use can only
include one STRUCTURAL inheritance chain going back to 'top'. We
can mix in other objectClasses as well, but only if they are
defined as 'AUXILIARY'. The LDAP Manual includes the following
objectClass definition, for example.</p>

<pre class="code">
objectclass ( 1.1.2.2.1
  NAME 'myPhotoObject'
  DESC 'mixin myPhoto'
  AUXILIARY
  MAY myPhoto )
</pre>

<p>I could define an object which uses myPhotoObject to supplement
the attributes available to an object like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
dn: blah blah
objectClass: top
objectClass: ypLoginAccount
objectClass: myPhotoObject
cn: aname
sn: lname
...
</pre>

<p>But the following definition would give me trouble, because the
ypLoginAccount and inetOrgPerson objectClasses are part of
different STRUCTURAL inheritance chains.</p>

<pre class="code">
dn: blah blah
objectClass: top
objectClass: ypLoginAccount
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
cn: aname
sn: lname
...
</pre>

<p>The linuxlaboratory.org site has a nice <a href=
"http://www.linuxlaboratory.org/index.php?title=Installing_an_OpenLDAP_server_-_Part_II">
LDAP Article</a> which might provide additional illumination.</p>

<h4>Try it out</h4>

<p>Here's a snippet of LDIF you can use to try our new schema.</p>

<pre class="code">
dn: cn=wile,ou=someplace,ou=meaningful,dc=to,dc=you
cn: wile
userPassword: {SHA}Wfi6Kd1nmjpbtmzcFqCnvEqIPzs=
givenName: Wile
mail: wile.coyote@acme.com
l: Los Lobos Hermanos
o: ACME
sn: Coyote
description: Malnourished but dogged
memberUid: coyote
memberUid: mammal
memberUid: emaciated
objectClass: top
objectClass: ypLoginAccount
</pre>

<p>Modify the dn as appropriate to your installation, and upload
with your favorite incarnation of the ldapadd command - after
reloading your slapd.conf file, of course, which will read in the
new schema file. If all goes well, you can now query this user from
either Outlook Express or Thunderbird, assuming you've taken care
of all the configuration niceties.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I find knowing how to customize OpenLDAP indispensable. For
example, I recently encountered an application vendor that
considered their product "LDAP compliant" because it worked with
one particular vendor's directory implementation. Although I tend
to cynically attribute this kind of mischievous marketing
malapropism to clever salesmanship, my world view may just be the
simple result of ensconcing myself in an intellectually gated
community. Who knows? In any case, it was a simple problem to
remedy: I just used OpenLDAP to emulate the other directory
implementation, thereby avoiding pointless additions to our
infrastructure.</p>

<p>May the new-found depth of your LDAP knowledge allow you to
overcome all of life's adversities, get a big raise, and earn a
well-deserved promotion.</p>
