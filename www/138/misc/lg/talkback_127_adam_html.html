Hey all,
</p>

<p>
I read with interest the article that explained how FVWM parses its style
lines.  I've been a FVWM user for about two years now, and this article
really inspired me to rearrange parts of my config.  I now have everything
the way I want it, except for some things, which I want to ask the rest of
you:
</p>

<p>
1.  Are any of you using FVWM, and, if so, do you have anything useful to
share, such as key-bindings, etc?<br>
2.  Can I somehow get new window to receive focus, even though I am using
ClickToFocus?<br>
3.  What's FvwmIconMan and do I really need it to replace FvwmTaskBar?
</p>

<p>
I hope the gang can help with this, and thank you so much for this article.
In klnd regards,
</p>

<p>
David
</p>

Can you be more specific as to what you want from this?

Style * FPGrabFocus,FPgrabFocusTransient,FPReleaseFocus, ClickToFocus
</pre>
Which will grab the focus on newly created windows, and ensure that
thereafter ClickToFocus is the default policy.

<p>
FvwmTaskBar has had numerous prolems in the past -- I am hoping that it
will be removed from a future FVWM version.  FvwmIconMan has many better
enhancements and configurations over FvwmTaskBar, and that coupled with
FvwmButtons can be very powerful indeed.
</p>

<p>
For example, one thing that FvwmIconMan can do that FvwmTaskBar does not
is that you can sort and weight applications together.

A reply from the master himself.  Brilliant, thanks.  This is exactly
what I want,  Can you explain how it works exactly?

Ok, I'll be sure to try it.
