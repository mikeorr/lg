We are looking for a version of Linux we can use legally in Syria.
 
Do you know of a list of all Linux variants and their country of origin or
do you know of a variant that is  export compliant?

I may be wrong, but I believe that you're looking for something that
doesn't exist. Under the The Wassenaar Arrangement, the US OFAC (Office
of Foreign Assets Control) has issued an explicit ruling prohibiting the
exportation of Linux to the countries on the SDN list - of which Syria
is one.

<p>
Don Marti has published an open letter to the US Department of Commerce
in the Linux Journal on the topic (with regard to Iraq, but equally
applicable to your question):
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
  <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7318">http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7318</a>
 
  Under the provisions of License Exception TSU, open source and the
  corresponding object code may be exported to all destinations except
  Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. Thus, open source
  and the corresponding object code are treated as if subject only to AT
  (anti-terrorism) controls. Items subject to AT controls may be exported
  to Iraq under the interim final rule (68 Fed. Reg. 38188) amending the
  Iraqi Sanctions Regulations.
 
  It is incongruous that publicly available software such as Linux has
  more restrictions than proprietary operating system software. Thus, we
  respectfully suggest that BIS amend Section 746.3 to permit exports to
  Iraq of open source and the corresponding object code.

I love America and it's freedoms dearly (despite being South African)

I don't think this message was Ben's intention. The regulations apply if
you want to ship distributions to certain countries. The software may
also go there by Internet.

<p>
This is an interesting twist. On the other hand these countries may have
their own regulations as well. I remember a friend of mine giving a talk
in Syria about how to foster the development of Free Software. While
being there she noticed that all Internet access is monitored and
reduced to proxy connections on port 80 and 25. Getting a CVS/svn/git
checkin or checkout can be tricky if your nice government proxy doesn't
allow that.

<p>
Establishing supremacy has its advantages, it enables you to do your
job, for example do proper spying:
</p>

<p>
"... That's right, my continental friends, we have spied on you because
you bribe. Your companies' products are often more costly, less
technically advanced or both, than your American competitors'. As a
result you bribe a lot. So complicit are your governments that in
several European countries bribes still are tax-deductible. ..."
<a href="http://cryptome.org/echelon-cia2.htm">http://cryptome.org/echelon-cia2.htm</a>

<p>
But this is another debate and more of analog nature (Echelon doesn't do
digital signals).

I wonder if there are any Arabic Linux distributions around as well. If
there are Chinese distributions, there should be others too.

They have user groups, and I am curious how they work and if they

</pre>

<p>
I just knew that somebody was going to say that. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Paul, let me recap what we know:
</p>

<p>
a) Simon has asked about using Linux <em>legally</em> in Syria. This means that
he's concerned with international law in that regard - which lies
squarely across the Wassenaar Agreement (hence, my mention of it.)
</p>

<p>
b) The question is not whether "all open source" is being produced in
the US, but whether <strong>any</strong> of it is. I.e., if you violate "only" 1% of
everything connected with the export of a given item, you're still a
criminal.
</p>

<p>
c) As it happens, a very large part of Linux - many libraries, etc. - is
indeed produced in the US, so it's not even a question of some vanishing
fraction; it's an issue that is definitely applicable.
</p>

<p>
d) The domain that Simon is coming from - and I am making an assumption
here, but not the one you were thinking of - is that of a UK company.
The UK is a signatory to the Wassenaar, AFAIK.
</p>

<p>
Does this make my statement a bit more understandable?
</p>


<pre>
&gt;  Or that all contributors to the Linux operating
&gt; system code are American?
</pre>

<p>
Another non-issue, and for the same reason.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; If exportation of the Linux operating system is prohibited to said
&gt; countries, then are <em>imports</em> of the Linux operating system as produced
&gt; by citizens of those countries not also prohibited from said
&gt; countries?  
</pre>

<p>
I couldn't say, but that's not the question that was being asked - and I
can't actually make out how that would be relevant.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; If some clever fellow from Syria or Iraq at some time in the past
&gt; contributed to an open source product before such restrictions, then is
&gt; his copyright not violated by a subsequent imposition of a prohibition?
</pre>

<p>
I wouldn't think so. He still owns the copyright to what he's produced.
Copyright, however, has nothing to do with the right to export or import
anything - please correct me if I'm wrong.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; What about the long term future of open source- is it to be subject to
&gt; the vaguaries of world politics?
</pre>

<p>
Um... yes? As is anything in the human realm, I'm afraid. The meaning of
the word 'politics' makes that clear, I would think.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I love America and it's freedoms dearly (despite being South African)
&gt; but such arrogance as to assume that any technology of worth is produced
&gt; wholly by America and should thus be treated as "exports" really gets my
&gt; goat.
</pre>

<p>
I assure you that I didn't get any of it. I'd know, since I'm a big fan
of goat. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> No, it was crab last night (Rustic Crab Shack in Ft.
Lauderdale, Florida - extreme yum!)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, there was no arrogance intended - or, as I think I've shown,
inherent - in what I've said.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; If I were Simon, I would forward a friendly note to Mark Shuttleworth
&gt; (of Ubuntu fame) to ask whether he believes his distro is restricted for
&gt; use in Syria.
</pre>

<p>
As much as I respect his work, I assure you that what Mark Shuttleworth
believes in this regard is irrelevant; it's an issue at the federal
levels. If anything, the fact that he holds a dual citizenship makes him
twice as vulnerable - if he violates the law of either SA or the UK,
he's in trouble. That's also pretty much the crux of the problem that
Simon asked about, as I see it.

&gt;
&gt; Does this make my statement a bit more understandable?
</pre>
[snip]
</p>

<p>
This conversation piqued my interest a bit, so I checked out the Wassenaar 
Agreement homepage (<a href="http://www.wassenaar.org/">http://www.wassenaar.org/</a>) and found the Control List 
(revised 2007).In that list 
(<a href="http://www.wassenaar.org/controllists/2007/WA-LIST%20(07)%202%20Corr.pdf">http://www.wassenaar.org/controllists/2007/WA-LIST%20(07)%202%20Corr.pdf</a>), 
it states:
	"The Lists do not control "software" which is either:
	 1.  Generally available to the public by being:
    		a.   Sold from stock at retail selling points without restriction, by
 		means of:
			1. Over-the-counter transactions;
         			2. Mail order transactions;
         			3. Electronic transactions; or
         			4. Telephone call transactions; and
    		b.   Designed for installation by the user without further substantial
		      support by the supplier; or
	2.  "In the public domain".
	"
(with the caveat that "Information Security Software" (i.e strong encryption, 
either symmetric key or asymmetric key) *is not* exempt from the agreement.
</p>

<p>
The GNU Organization has a Wassenaar position page 
(<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/wassenaar.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/wassenaar.html</a>) where they indicate
	"we saw that it continues to have an exception that seems to cover free
	 software. (They use the term "public domain", but they seem to mean
	 something like free software by that.) "
</p>

<p>
Further, participation in the Wassenaar Agreement is limited to 
Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech 
Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, 
Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New 
Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian 
Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, 
Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, United States 
</p>

<p>
ISTM that
a) The Wassenaar Agreement may not apply to a Linux distribution that does not 
include a strong encryption package, and
b) A transfer of such software /may/ be performed from one of the countries 
not participating in the Wassenaar Agreement.
</p>

<p>
However, I am not a lawyer (especially, not a lawyer specializing in the 
importing or exporting of software products), and I *do not* recommend that 
the OP consider my opinion (or other opinions expressed here) as permission 
to commence importing software to Syria. Instead, the OP /really/ needs to 
check with legal council regarding the import/export of such material.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone know of a Linux distro created in or distributed from Syria? I 
noticed that, at counter.li.org, there are 63 registered users of Linux in 
Syria (<a href="http://counter.li.org/reports/place.php?place=SY">http://counter.li.org/reports/place.php?place=SY</a>). Perhaps one of 
these users (the report page gives some contact info) can assist the OP.

&gt; the US, but whether <strong>any</strong> of it is. I.e., if you violate "only" 1% of
&gt; everything connected with the export of a given item, you're still a
&gt; criminal.
&gt; 
&gt; c) As it happens, a very large part of Linux - many libraries, etc. - is
&gt; indeed produced in the US, so it's not even a question of some vanishing
&gt; fraction; it's an issue that is definitely applicable.
&gt; 
&gt; d) The domain that Simon is coming from - and I am making an assumption
&gt; here, but not the one you were thinking of - is that of a UK company.
&gt; The UK is a signatory to the Wassenaar, AFAIK.
&gt; 
&gt; Does this make my statement a bit more understandable?
</pre>

<p>
Sure- and I don't think I misunderstood your initial post.  Thanks you
for the clarification though.   
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt;  Or that all contributors to the Linux operating
&gt; &gt; system code are American?
&gt; 
&gt; Another non-issue, and for the same reason.
&gt;  
&gt; &gt; If exportation of the Linux operating system is prohibited to said
&gt; &gt; countries, then are <em>imports</em> of the Linux operating system as produced
&gt; &gt; by citizens of those countries not also prohibited from said
&gt; &gt; countries?  
&gt; 
&gt; I couldn't say, but that's not the question that was being asked - and I
&gt; can't actually make out how that would be relevant.
</pre>

<p>
Relevant in that there are two sides to any agreement.  In simplest
terms, a barter exchange you trade your pig for a tin of beads.  You
don't just give the pork away for nothing.   Export has an opposite in
an import.  If the law says you are not to do business, then that law
should go both ways.  What I see is a ban on exports, but no equivalent
ban on imports.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt; If some clever fellow from Syria or Iraq at some time in the past
&gt; &gt; contributed to an open source product before such restrictions, then is
&gt; &gt; his copyright not violated by a subsequent imposition of a prohibition?
&gt; 
&gt; I wouldn't think so. He still owns the copyright to what he's produced.
&gt; Copyright, however, has nothing to do with the right to export or import
&gt; anything - please correct me if I'm wrong.
</pre>

<p>
Nit picking perhaps, but theoretically, one should be scanning every bit
of code you have for possible contributions sourced from any of those
countries and stripping them out.  Using someones contribution and
refusing to reciprocate in allowing him to use yours is unethical in my
book.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt; What about the long term future of open source- is it to be subject to
&gt; &gt; the vaguaries of world politics?
&gt; 
&gt; Um... yes? As is anything in the human realm, I'm afraid. The meaning of
&gt; the word 'politics' makes that clear, I would think.
</pre>

<p>
Can't argue with reality.  Tomorrow, South Africa may be on that list,
or America on someone elses list.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; &gt; I love America and it's freedoms dearly (despite being South African)
&gt; &gt; but such arrogance as to assume that any technology of worth is produced
&gt; &gt; wholly by America and should thus be treated as "exports" really gets my
&gt; &gt; goat.
&gt; 
&gt; I assure you that I didn't get any of it. I'd know, since I'm a big fan
&gt; of goat. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> No, it was crab last night (Rustic Crab Shack in Ft.
&gt; Lauderdale, Florida - extreme yum!)
</pre>

<p>
Now I'm hungry <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Anyway, there was no arrogance intended - or, as I think I've shown,
&gt; inherent - in what I've said.
</pre>

<p>
Ben, I am sorry if it came across that I was accusing <em>you</em> of
arrogance.  Certainly not!  What I meant to say, is that for the "Office
of Asset Control" to impose restrictions on open source implies their
belief that open source is their asset to control.  I find that
arrogant.  Certainly, a great part, even possibly most of open source is
of American origin.  However, the law does not make the distinction
between "American open source" and "Foreign open source"- which is
really so mixed up in single OS, app or library code as for the
difference to be indiscernable.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; &gt; If I were Simon, I would forward a friendly note to Mark Shuttleworth
&gt; &gt; (of Ubuntu fame) to ask whether he believes his distro is restricted for
&gt; &gt; use in Syria.
&gt; 
&gt; As much as I respect his work, I assure you that what Mark Shuttleworth
&gt; believes in this regard is irrelevant; it's an issue at the federal
&gt; levels. If anything, the fact that he holds a dual citizenship makes him
&gt; twice as vulnerable - if he violates the law of either SA or the UK,
&gt; he's in trouble. That's also pretty much the crux of the problem that
&gt; Simon asked about, as I see it.
</pre>

<p>
... And I never meant to imply otherwise.  I am certain that Marke
Shuttleworth, and many other upstanding South Africans are respectors of
the law, dual citizenship notwithstanding.  Be that as it may, trade
agreements between different countries do differ, and I am not expert
enough to say what the current political situation might be.
</p>

<p>
Whilst I abhor terrorism in any shape or form, and it may pique me to
think that our Neighboring country, Zimbabwe, might be using open source
to help run their corrupt government, or be used to further insiduous
plots against the west by scaly characters in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libia
(have I left anyone out) etc. etc.   The fact remains that not everyone
in those countries are uneducated or evil, and there is very little
practical value in the sort of export restrictions to which your refer.
The good guys will abide by the law- but don't for a moment think that
the bad guys are in any way deterred.  Particularly unaffected are the
governments.
</p>

<p>
You have answered Simon's question, and answered it well.  Your answer
did raise a whole lot of other questions in my mind though.
</p>

<p>
Paul

&gt; &gt; Paul, let me recap what we know:

&gt; &gt; a) Simon has asked about using Linux <em>legally</em> in Syria. This means that

OK, I wasn't clear on that. Your reply seemed to miss my point.
 
</p>

&gt; ban on imports.
</pre>

<p>
Ah - there's that magic word "should". Has little relation to how laws
work, unfortunately, and <em>no</em> relation at all to international law.
There are plenty of situations in the latter where you're screwed no
matter what you do - because something that you're required to do by one
country is completely forbidden by another. The fact that one country
makes gilliwhillikins available for export imposes no duty whatsoever on
any other country to make it legal to import them; this comes under the
heading of being 'sovereign' (a term that Robert Heinlein defined as
something found in the dictionary between 'sober' and 'sozzled', and of
little meaning otherwise.)
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If some clever fellow from Syria or Iraq at some time in the past
&gt; &gt; &gt; contributed to an open source product before such restrictions, then is
&gt; &gt; &gt; his copyright not violated by a subsequent imposition of a prohibition?

&gt; &gt; I wouldn't think so. He still owns the copyright to what he's produced.

&gt; countries and stripping them out.  Using someones contribution and
&gt; refusing to reciprocate in allowing him to use yours is unethical in my
&gt; book.
</pre>

<p>
Let's extend that, then. How much does that "clever fellow" owe back to
the people who created Linux in the first place, to the people who wrote
the man pages, to the people who created the programming language that
he used, or posted programming information on the Net, etc.? Does he,
then, actually "own" that code in that sense? By your definition, he
doesn't - if that technical debt (to misuse a common term) applies to
those who use his work, then he owes as much, if not more, of a debt to
everyone upstream.
</p>

<p>
One of the majort effects and benefits of open source licensing is that
the <strong>actual</strong> debt imposed downstream is clearly defined rather than
being some nebulous thing that can never be paid off and would require
some heroic, showy action - like ripping out all code created by someone
who may or may not be on some shadowy list created by some government
agency. As long as the people who benefit from that "clever fellow"'s
code acknowledge his contribution (AFAIK, importation of <strong>names</strong> from
Syria, etc., has not yet become subject to restrictions), that debt is
paid in full - except for possibly the part that can't be enforced by
any government but is given freely by ethical people. It's called
'respect', and as I've frequently mentioned here in LG, it's the major
currency of the open source community. That part can't be bought, sold,
stolen, forced, or regulated - but it can be earned by "clever fellows"
who contribute their effort to the community.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, there was no arrogance intended - or, as I think I've shown,
&gt; &gt; inherent - in what I've said.
&gt; 
&gt; Ben, I am sorry if it came across that I was accusing <em>you</em> of
&gt; arrogance.  Certainly not!  
</pre>

<p>
Thanks for clarifying that, Paul. I didn't think you were, but I'd
rather clarify than leave it hanging.

</pre>

<p>
Yep. And the problem is that it's within their control - at least to the
extent that they can punish any American who violates their rules. In
short, they have the guns, so they get to dictate to anyone they can
threaten with those guns. Perhaps I'm too cynical in my viewpoint that
any government anywhere is nothing more than the biggest criminal gang
in the country, and thus gets to boss other criminal gangs and to make
the non-criminal citizens pay them protection money... but I've found
little in all my experience of the world to contradict that. I must, in
all fairness, point out that some of these gangs are less than rapacious 
than others - but that gains them no merit in my book; their restraint
is usually that of a bully who is afraid of pushing his victim too far
rather than some sense of morality or mercy.
</p>

<p>
(Damn it, how did that 'RANT' switch get into the 'On' position? I must
have bumped it.)

I won't go into this much further except to say "I agree with you" -
doing so would have me ranting again. I will, however, cite a relevant
entry from my quote file:
</p>

<pre>
"The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most
of one's time defending scoundrels. For it is against scoundrels
that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped
at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all."
