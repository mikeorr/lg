<I>"Small is beautiful" -- Unix Philosophy </I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Introduction </H2>
<P>Ever wondered what it takes to create a web site that can be 
completely managed by e-mail? Are you one of those e-mail buffs who wants to manage everything with mail? Are you the guy who wants something different? If your answer is yes to any of these questions, read on.... </P>
<p>Have you ever thought how a special correspondent for CNN reporting from the
remotest place on earth can cause a web page to change its content based on
the latest he is reporting ? Or how the Newspaper dot coms manage hundreds of
HTML pages every day ? The achieve this through a concept called a Content
Management System.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Content Management is one of the prominent issues every website has to deal with, from
lightly-loaded sites to very content-intensive sites). A very basic Content
Management System (CMS) at the very least should provide a user friendly
interface to modify the Web Content. A sophisticated CMS does much more than
that, not only providing management of creation, modification and deletion of
content but also services like revision control, roles hierarchy, multichannel
content management and delivery etc. In this article we talk about a relatively
new channel for Content Management very well known to readers:
e-mail! Though this particular channel has already been put to use by commercial CMS's like Vignette, they are rather very expensive and sold on a
per-feature basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above paragraph looked like <i>Greek</i> to you then you are an
Eligible Candidate to read this article. Carry on and you will learn the simplest ever
implementation of e-mail based Content Management System with Procmail.</p>
<P>Here we will show how a web page can be updated just by sending an e-mail. We 
will use this <A href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~ppadala/procmail.html">test page</A>
(Javascript should be enabled to properly view this page).
All it contains is a streamer. We update the text of the streamer when we receive
mail with proper subject!!! </P>
<H2>procmail </H2>Now what's the connection to Procmail? Procmail follows the 
UNIX philosophy that <I>a program accomplishes one task, efficiently </I>. Procmail is an extremely powerful mail filtering utility. All one has to do is write recipes which get executed when certain type of mail arrives. It is generally used to filter incoming mail into seperate directories. In the Procmail 
developers' words,
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Procmail can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your 
incoming mail into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to 
one or more mailing lists or for prioritising your mail), preprocess your mail, 
start any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate different chimes on your 
workstation for different types of mail) or selectively forward certain incoming 
mail automatically to someone.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you don't understand any of those terms above, dont panic. Just sit back and relax. We will 
show some basic examples on how it works and explain a cute method to update the 
streamer on your web page. </P>
<H2>The intial blues </H2>
<P>Procmail is a mail filtering utility. It can be run on each mail sent to you 
and process it accordingly. Say, you wanted to save all the mail with subject 
<I>discuss </I>to a folder named discuss. Then you have to write the following 
lines in the files specified. </P>In your home directory create a file named 
<CODE>.forward</CODE> and put the following lines <PRE>	&quot;|IFS=' ';exec /usr/local/bin/procmail USER=&lt;username&gt;&quot;
</PRE>Replace the username with your username and make sure that the path to the Procmail binary is set correctly. Don't worry about the details. We will dig deeper into them in the next 
section. 
<P></P>
<P>Create a file named .procmailrc in your home directory and add the following 
lines 
<PRE>	:0
	* ^Subject:.*discuss
	discuss
</PRE>
<P>Create a directory named <code>discuss</code> in your home directory for 
putting the mails with subject discuss.
</P>
Now try sending a mail to yourself which contains at least the word &quot;discuss&quot; 
in the subject. This mail will automatically be moved into a directory discuss. 
<P></P>
<P>Let's try to understand what's happening here. When a mail is sent to an smtp 
server, it will be delivered to the corresponding user by a MDA(Mail Delivery 
Agent) like sendmail. This program looks for a file named .forward; if it exists 
it tries to execute the rules specified in the .forward file. Usually the .forward contains a mail address to 
which one wishes to forward all mail. We may also write commands within this file to execute a program 
like Procmail. This is exactly what the lines above in the .forward do. 
For a detailed explanation of things to be put in .forward see 
<A href=http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/users/reriksso/procmail/mini-faq.html#forward>
here</A>
Once Procmail is 
executed, it looks for the file .procmailrc which contains mail processing directives - what actions have to be taken for different kinds of mail. 
</P>
<H2>.procmailrc file </H2>
<P>The file .procmailrc contains rules for how to filter the mail. In above 
example, the rule says that for all the mails with subject discuss, forward them to a 
directory named discuss. General syntax for writing rules (called recipes in 
Procmail jargon) is 
<PRE>	:0 [flags] [ : [locallockfile] ]
	&lt;zero or more conditions (one per line)&gt;
	&lt;exactly one action line&gt;
</PRE>
<P>You can ignore the first line for now. From the second line, you can start 
writing conditions. A condition starting with '*' specifies an extended regular 
expression to be matched. If it matches then the action line is executed. If the 
action line starts with a '|' then it executes the program whose name follows the '|'. You can use the '!' character to forward to mail to another address. If the action line 
doesn't start with either of these two characters or a '{', then it is assumed to be a 
directory or file to which mail has to be delivered, as in the above example. </P>
<P>Another example will clear the mist. 
<PRE>	
	:0 c
	* ^Subject:.*discuss
	discuss

	:0
	* ^Subject:.*discuss
	! yourname@somewhere.com
</PRE>This recipe forwards the mail to the address yourname@somewhere.com and 
keeps a copy in the directory discuss.  The flag 'c' in the first stanza tells Procmail
to continue reading recipes even if this recipe matches.  Normally Procmail stops after the
first match.  The procmailrc manpage says 'c' generates a carbon copy of the message, but
it's easier to think of 'c' as meaning "continue".  Either way amounts to the
same thing.  Another useful but ill-named flag is 'D', which makes the match
expressions case sensitive.
<P></P>
<P>The following example shows the usage of '|' <PRE>	:0
	* ^Subject:.*discuss
	| formail -I &quot;&quot; &gt;&gt; index.html
</PRE>If a mail with subject discuss comes, formail is executed. formail is a 
small utility which can be used to format mail. The above action line extracts 
the body from the mail and appends it to the file index.html. 
<P></P>
<H2>Ready for action? </H2>
<P>You have seen some basic examples. There is a lot of information on Procmail 
recipes on web. Refer to the section on resources for links. In the next few sections, we 
will show how Procmail can be used to update a streamer on a web page. </P>We 
put the following lines in .procmailrc. My procmailc at it stands now is 
<a href=misc/padala/procmailrc.txt>here</a>

<PRE>	
	SHELL=/bin/sh
	PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin
	
	:0
	* ^Subject:.*announce
	| formail -s parse.pl announce;

	:0
	* ^Subject:.*notice
	| formail -s parse.pl notice;
</PRE>
<P>
The first lines set some variables so that Procmail works properly. See 
<A href=http://linux.ctyme.com/man/man2115.htm>procmailrc man page</A> for
details.
</P>
Here, mail containing the subject &quot;announce&quot; or &quot;notice&quot; is forwarded to formail. 
formail parses the mail and each individual mail is given to a perl script named 
parse.pl. The perl script updates the streamer with the string in the body of 
message. The text version of the script is <a href=misc/padala/parse.pl.txt> here </a>

in javascript. You can test it by sending <A

You can see the streamer at <A 
href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~ppadala/procmail.html">http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~ppadala/procmail.html</A>. 
It is magically updated when you send mail to <A

my address </A>with a subject "announce" or "notice". 
The text in the body goes to streamer. 
<H2>Conclusion </H2>
<P>This is a small example of Content Management. Content Mangement is a huge 
topic with a lot of ramifications. It requires well planned procedures for 
updating web pages, keeping their style sheets intact etc.. We have shown a small 
example of how easy it is to create a basic content management system with Procmail. 
	The permuatations are endless. As Descartes had said &quot;<B><I>It is not enough to have a good mind. The main thing is to use it well</I></B>&quot;.  </P>
