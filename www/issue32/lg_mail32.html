Subject: <B>R2000 Mips 2030</B> 
<P>
	I just recently came into a used R2000 "Mips 2030" desktop slab.
Aside from opening the box and finding that it is indeed running an R2000
CPU, I know nothing else about the computer -- literally. I have found
absolutely zero information about any computer bearing the markings 'MIPS 
2030'. To make matters worse, I don't have a proper BNC monitor to
actually use the box yet, but I'm searching. My question, where can I find
information about the R2000 port of Linux? I have visited the Linux/MIPS
page, but the only mention of the R2000/3000 CPU port is an URL which
points at SGI's statistics on the R3000 CPU. I was hoping I could pop
Linux on on the box, and happily run it alongside the little army of Linux
boxen I have now. Any help would be very appreciated.
<P>
	Thanks.<BR> 
	Paul.

I installed Linux in a secondary IDE hard disk booting from a floppy
disk. Then I tried to install LILO in the MBR of the primary IDE hard
disk and I did it. My idea was to maintain Windows 95 in the primary
disk. I configured LILO to be able to start Windows 95, but after
installing LILO the primary disk cannot be seen either by DOS nor by
Linux. If I run msdos-fdisk it says that the disk is active but in the
row where it should appear FAT16 puts unknown or something like that.
Can I recover the information of the hard disk ?

<P>
I recently purchased Red Hat 5.1 and got it running. Evidently I was lucky in
that I have a fairly full FAT 32 Win 98 drive and kind of stumbled through
the defrag / fips / boot to CD / repartition / full install with LILO
process. Everything worked, but I'm a little nonplussed. A few topics I'd
absolutely love to get feedback on...
<ul>
<li>Turns out I have a lousy WinModem. I can see the feedback now, (Run
it over with your car)
<li>I have grown fat and lazy with Win 98 and find myself looking for
"Display Properties" and such. I'm very familiar with C and such and am not
afraid of hacking scripts or the like, but my problem is thus: Where is a
(succinct) list of what gets run when, from where, and why. I'd love to
tweak everything if only I could find it.
<li>I have something called an "Ensoniq Audio PCI" sound card with
"legacy emulation" I don't even know how to begin to get this thing working.
What are the first steps in enabling hardware?
<li>Where do I get information on mounting drives (FAT 32 especially)
<li>I think my printer works (at least text does), but how do I print
things (man pages)
</ul>
I'm not an idiot, not even a "dummy", but what is a good book to answer
the basic questions? I have "Linux in a Nutshell" and it has a very good
command reference and a few other things, but doesn't help in tweaking
things.
<P>
I don't really expect anyone to answer all of these concerns, but any little
help would be greatly appreciated.

An idea for an article.  (You may have already done this but I couldn't
find a search engine to look up past articles).  I have yet to get my
Red Hat 5.1 to connect to the Internet. (Their support is GREATLY
overstated.) I'm consquently using Win95 to do my Internet work. The reason
for this is that my modem, network adapter and sound card are all Plug and
Play (PnP).  I would like to see an article detailing step by step, for a
Linux beginner, how to install Tom Lee's PnP Package. This would involve
recompiling the kernel which I'm not afraid of, but have no idea how to go
about it.  The more step by step the better.  I'm from the DOS world and
any assumed knowledge that I have might be wrong.

Could you explain what hardware (multiport controllers) works best with

<P>
I tell you, .....
<P>
Are you familiar with Nietzsche's description of the ordinary man's
journey from man to superman? ...how he "goes down" into the abyss and
comes up the other side? Moving from Windows to Linux is a bit like that.
;)
<P>
My adventure started in late April. I was sick and tired of Windows NT
bluescreening. I read an article saying how stable Linux was in
comparison. I looked into GUIs & found KDE to be to my liking. 
<P>
In the end, I vaped NT because I needed the hard disk space. ;-P
<P>
It is now August. I have had ro reinstall almost a dozen times because I
am still getting used to "The Linux Way". I have been using computers
since i was 6; PCs since I was 16; Windows since I was 18. Linux is very
stable indeed but it is eccentric & definitely not user-friendly, unless
your definition of user differs wildly from mine.
<P>
I have written a "HOWTO" so that I can recover quickly if I have to
reinstall the entire OS and GUI. It is currently 3500 words long, and
tells me how to install RedHat, compile a new kernel, compile&install KDE
1.0, install the BackUPS software, configure dial-up networking &
autodial, install AutoRPM, and .. umm... that's it, so far.
<P>
Don't get me wrong: Linux _is_ a wonderful thing. It's just ... It's
_such_ a leap from Windows! I am convinced my primary client (with a dozen
Windows machines) could function very well with Linux & Applixware instead
of Windows & Office, just so long as they have someone competent to
maintain their systems. Of course, they'll need much less maintenance
under Linux than under Windows ;)
<P>
Linux requires a lot of competence & intelligence (and downloads!) if
you're going to set it up. Windows doesn't. On the other hand, it seems
much less prone to these embarrassing GPFs.

Neat issue of the Gazette, thanks for all the hard work.  I'm proud to

One little teensie issue of fact though:

First the quote:
The first two issues of Linux Journal were published by Robert Young.
After the second issue, Robert decided to start up Red Hat
Software, and Specialized Systems Consultants took over as publisher.
Also with the third issue, Michael Johnson took on the role
of Editor and continued in that role through the September 1996 issue. I
became Editor on February 1, 1997 and began work on the
May issue. 
<P>
And the correction:
Actually Bob (Robert) started a Linux catalog within the ACC
Bookstores.  It wasn't until quite a bit later when he met Marc Ewing
that he folded ACC into Marc's Red Hat Software.

Subject: <B>Re: The other side of the story (or, on the other, other
hand)</B> 
<P>
Just before I launch into the meat of this email, I'd like to say that
the Linux Gazette is excellent. good articles, and good tips and
comments.
<P>
I'm writing about the mail in the August issue "The Other Side of the
Story", in which Antony Chesser compares the Windows GUI to the shell
prompt, especially the line
<P>
"When Linux finishes installing, you're left with a # prompt. When WIN95
finishes installing, you've a fairly intuitive GUI that allows you to
quickly and easily install and run programs, connect to the net, and
**apply updates without re-compiling the
kernel**"
<P>
My quibble is with the underlying assumption that a GUI (and here I
assume that includes Mac, and X, as well as Windows) is more intuitive
then a command line. I argue that for a complete novice one is as bad as
the other, neither a command line nor a screen full of little coloured
icons and a START button are instantly comprehensible to a complete
computer novice.
<P>
(Before you write me off as insane - remember that a GUI is supposed to
shorten the time it takes to learn how to operate the computer, they
don't eliminate the time altogether.)
<P>
Do you remember the scene in the Star Trek movie (the one with the
whales...) where Scotty tries to use a Mac? He talks to it, and nothing
happens... the operator says "You need to use this [the mouse]", so
Scotty picks up the mouse and uses it like a microphone - "Good morning
computer."
<P>
Can you see where I'm going? Until someone teaches the "complete novice"
the relationship between the pointer and the mouse, and what happens
when you click, double-click, or drag with the mouse, they will be just
as lost as a novice sitting in front of a command line. Actually, they
may be worse off... we have had typewriters for a lot longer then mice,
and people will grasp the concept of typing faster then clicking on
pictures.
<P>
So, in summary, I think that a complete novice will have a learning
curve to cope with whether they use a GUI, or a command line; and the
rest of us should remember that there is a difference between "ease of
use", and "what I'm used to".

Subject: <B>Linux News Standardization/Distribution Project</B> 
<P>
We've been making progress on our proposal to standardize the format and
distribution of Linux news. Our design uses the NNTP protocol to create a
network of servers that will quickly and robustly share news that is
interesting to the Linux community. This will allow websites like Freshmeat
and Slashdot, as well as lists like Threepoint's and linux-announce, to
reduce duplication of effort while still customizing their presentation.
In addition, this will provide a single easy method of submitting an item
of news, whether it's an announcement about a new software release, or a
description of the latest article in Forbes magazine.
<P>
The end goal of organizing the Linux announcements and news articles is
to encourage smaller ISVs to port to Linux, since they will see advertising
their software to a wide audience as less of an obstacle. Other important
benefits include greater robustness (from multiple news servers), less work
for the moderators (messages will be presorted and people can specialize in
their favorite type of news, resulting in faster throughput), and a uniform
comprehensive archiving system allowing people to search old articles more
effectively.
<P>
We are currently at the point where we are designing the standard format
for a news item. We want to make it rich enough that it provides all the
information that each site wants, but simple enough that we can require
submissions to include all fields. At the same time we're sorting out how
the NNTP-based connections between the servers should work. We've got
Freshmeat and Threepoint in on it, and other groups like Debian and
LinuxMall are interested. We need more news sites to provide input and
feedback, to make sure everybody will want to use the system once it's
ready.  
<P>
If you're interested, please check out our webpage at
http://linuxunited.org/projects/news/ and subscribe to the mailing list
(send mail to majordomo@linuxunited.org with body 'subscribe lu-news').
<P>
Thanks for your time (this is the last mail I will send directly about this),

 This is just to inform you that some of our readers have pointed out
that we ought to distribute your magazine on our Cover CD, and after
having read through the lisence, I believe this will be no problem. I
have, just to be safe, saved a copy of the copy lisence together with
the archives and plan on distributing the new issues as the show up.
<P>
Keep up the good work!

In LG#31 Michael Rasmusson wrote: "the majority of Linux users are IT
professionals in some way" and alluded to the fact that Linux will be slow to 
be accepted due to this fact. This is very untrue. Most Linux users are in fact
College and high school students. These forward thinking young minds aren't 
tied down by archaic IT department policy (many of which were penned in the 
70's when IT was called the Processing/programming/systems/data-processing
department) Linux will explode, it will do so violently. In fact it will
explode so fast and vast that Microsoft will say "What happened?" The local
Linux Users groups are all populated by 90% college and high school students.
What do you think will happen when these students hit the computer departments
at large corporations? They will install Linux, they will use Linux, and they
will recommend Linux. The "explosion" has already started. Many large companies
have already abandoned NOVELL and Microsoft for their servers. (The makers of
the CG effects in the movie Titanic are far from small)

<P>
I've been reading the LG mailbag...  A lot of people think Linux should be
made easier to use.  I don't think that's quite right - the idea, IMHO,
should be to make it so that Linux can be used by someone who's new to
computers, BUT they should have to learn to use it's full power.  With
power, knowledge must come or disaster will follow instead.  The goal, in
the end, is that the person becomes a self-sufficient user, capable of
sorting out most difficulties without needing help.  TTYL!
