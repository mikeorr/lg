<h1>Poor Man's Laptop: Richer Features</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/renker.html">Gerrit Renker</A></b></p>


<p>The <a href="../132/renker.html">first part of this article</a>
introduced the basic idea of using an inexpensive USB stick instead of a
laptop for home/work demands. This part turns the bare-bones script (a
glorified wrapper around <tt>tar</tt>) into a robust, conveniently usable
day-to-day solution.</p>

<img src="misc/renker/help_screen.png" border="0" alt="help screen" align="right">

<p>One of the main drawbacks of the basic version is that one has to 
explicitly state the maximum age of files (<tt>--days x</tt> option),
and this is the first thing that can/will go wrong - especially when
synchronising only once in a while. Imagine taking your last batch of
files home, going on vacation and then coming back after some weeks. The
question then is '<em>When was it I last synced my files from work ... 3
days or ... wait a minute ... could be 5 ... better make it 7?</em>'
This is tedious, therefore a <em>timestamping mechanism</em>
is implemented.</p>

<p>The <em>second aspect</em> that complicates usage is that directories
can be synchronised as they grow, but not as they shrink - and this
is again tedious to keep track of. A simple script to automate this
process is presented.</p>

<p>The remainder of this article contains brief discussions of further
add-ons. These can be used as-is, but the intention is rather to
illustrate that a usable solution requires neither expensive hardware
nor complicated programs.</p>

		<h2>A More Usable Script</h2> 

<p>To recap the last part, the <a href="misc/renker/pack.pl.txt">main
script</a> uses a <a href="misc/renker/pack.list-example.txt">configuration file</a>, <tt>$config</tt>, which
stores (tagged) names of directories or files that are to be
tracked.  A good idea is to put it in a fixed location
(e.g., <tt>/etc/pack.list</tt>), and allow all USB stick users write
access to that file. Then, it is possible to simply add a new directory,
in the following manner:</p>

<pre class="code">
pwd &gt;&gt; /etc/pack.list
</pre>

<p>To resolve the question '<em>But how do I keep my configuration files
themselves synchronised?</em>', a second level of configurability is
implemented in form of the <tt>essential()</tt> routine. It provides
robustness against overwriting by tracking a few selected, important
files - among these <tt>$config</tt> itself:</p>

<pre class="code">
sub essential {
  open( ESSENTIAL, "&gt;$tmpconf") || die "can't store essential files in $tmpconf: $!\n";
  print ESSENTIAL "/home/gerrit/.{bash?[place]*,alias,functions,dircolors}\n";
  # ...
  print ESSENTIAL "${config}\n";
  close ESSENTIAL;
}
</pre>

<p>An alternative is to always carry around the configuration file
list on the stick. There is support for such a solution: a directory
<tt>$confdir = $flashdir/.conf.d</tt> exists, and is heavily used by
the other functions that will now be discussed.</p>


		   <h3>Time-stamping</h3>

<p>It is easy to get the number of days (in the <tt>--days x</tt>
option) wrong, and then one ends up with stale files - a nuisance.
The timestamping mechanism is superior to the day-wise backup, and makes
the usage much simpler. It is based on recording a timestamp value in
a file, much like the files <tt>anacron(8)</tt> uses. The important bits
are:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>each host gets its own <em>timestamp file</em>, named <tt>$confdir/timestamp-<em>hostname</em></tt></li>
  <li>when <em>unpacking</em> a file from another host, the timestamp for this host is updated</li>
  <li>when <em>packing</em> a new archive, the timestamp for <em>this</em> host (if there) is consulted</li>
  <li>all file modification times are tracked relative to this timestamp</li>
</ul> 

So the mechanism is: <em>at work</em> - create archive, <em>at home</em> -
unpack archive, update timestamp. Then, after doing some work,
create a new archive with pack: only those tracked files are archived
that are newer than the last recorded timestamp.

<p>If you look inside the timestamp file, there is just a single
number (epoch time in seconds). It is easy to make the contents
human-readable:</p>

<pre class="code">
alias seconds_to_timestring="perl -le 'for (&lt;STDIN&gt;) { print \$_=localtime(\$_) }'"
</pre>
<img src="misc/renker/decoding_timestamp.png"  border="0" alt="Decoding a timestamp" align="top">

<p> With <tt>pack --info</tt>, you can see timestamps of all hosts you
use; <a href="misc/renker/packinfo.png">here</a> is an example screenshot.
(The script recognises which timestamp is local.)  To bootstrap this
mechanism, the <tt>--days x</tt> option is still needed - once, for initial
creation of timestamps.</p>

<p>Since several functions (archive label and timestamping) depend
on <em>distinct hostnames</em>, the source and target PCs should use
different ones (e.g., not both '<tt>localhost.localdomain</tt>').</p>


         <h3>Remote command execution</h3>

<p>An archive can only transport, not delete, files.  While it is not
possible to mimic the <tt>--delete</tt> flag of e.g. <tt>rsync</tt>,
a useful approximation is possible, and not too complicated to implement.
It is based on executing commands that change the structure of directories
(e.g., new owners, file deletion, file access times ...) locally and,
when successful, <em>recording</em> them for later use. The principle is
simple: in essence, the <a href="misc/renker/cmd.bash.txt">script</a>
does the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
cmds=$confdir/commands
while read -p'#' line; do  eval $line &amp;&amp; echo $line &gt;&gt; $cmds; done
</pre>

<p>The <a href="misc/renker/cmd.bash.txt">actual script</a> is a bit more
sophisticated: it keeps track of the <em>current working directory </em>
(as most commands use relative, not absolute directory names); performs
<em>alias expansion</em>; and uses '<tt>su</tt>' to track file ownership.

<p>The output generated by this script is in turn an executable,
'<em>write-once-execute-once</em>', shell script.  If you supplied such a
file in <tt>$confdir</tt>, <tt>pack</tt> will automatically execute
it within the <tt>execute_cmds()</tt> routine - which looks like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
sub execute_cmds {
  (-s $cmds) || return;             # ignore empty files
  # ...
  system "bash $cmds";              # execute commands
  system "mv $cmds /tmp/commands";  # store in /tmp
}
</pre>

To merely <em>see</em> what would happen (without executing), you can use <tt>pack --show</tt>. 

Here is an <a href="misc/renker/removing_a_kernel.jpg">example</a>
where a kernel is removed both locally and remotely (the remote side
is shown further below).  When using such a script, asterisks and
other shell-special characters  need to be escaped, as shown in <a
href="misc/renker/cleaning_up_maildir.jpg">this</a> example.


            <h2>Extensibility</h2>
	    
   <h3>The 'pre.2' and 'add.2' archive files</h3>

<p>Often the one-off situation arises to just carry some files home
once, e.g., some source files or PDF files to read. To provide a simpler
alternative to day-to-day tracking, there are two <em>archives with special names</em>
that will automatically be unpacked:</p>
<ul>
  <li><tt>$pret</tt> (defaults to `pre.2') is unpacked <em>before</em> the main archive is unpacked</li>
  <li><tt>$addt</tt> (defaults to `add.2') is unpacked <em>after</em> the main archive is unpacked</li>
</ul>

<p>The former is useful if there is overlap with files that are already
tracked; the latter is a good all-round default.  The convenience of this
solution is the automatic unpacking via the script - no more forgotten archives.
To create either of the two files, use the <tt>-j</tt> option
(bzip2 compression) and the <tt>-P</tt> option (to not strip leading
'/') with <tt>tar</tt>.  For example, I often do this:</p>

<pre class="code">
tar -jcpPvf  /vol/flash/<b>add.2</b>    /usr/src/patches/  /home/bin
</pre>


   <h3>Automatic unpacking at boot-time</h3>

</div>

<p>Archives of tracked files need to be unpacked before any running
program has a chance of overwriting them. Un-packing is thus
best performed either at boot-time or before the window manager
starts. KDE for instance provides a place for such executables in
<tt>~/.kde/Autostart</tt>. Since not everyone uses KDE, I will present the
former alternative.</p>

<p>But not without a <b>BIG FAT WARNING</b>: Using a synchroniser system,
potentially with command execution, short-circuits all the hard work
other hackers have done to make your Linux box a safe place. A malicious
'<em>bad guy</em>' could feed your computer garbage archives or venomous
scripts which render your system unusable.</p>

<p>At the very least, use some form of authorization; a
simple, but efficient, variant is presented below.  The automatic <a
href="misc/renker/unpackUSB.txt">unpack script</a> is a
standard SysV init script; place or symlink it into <tt>/etc/init.d</tt>
and create a symlink for the appropriate runlevel. (On my Debian box, I use
<tt>/etc/rc2.d/S30unpackUSB</tt>, RH/Fedora
are similar and there is <tt>chkconfig</tt> support.)  When invoked with
the `<tt>start</tt>' argument at boot-time, the script will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>verify that the archive was not created on this host</li>
  <li>authorise the USB stick (described below)</li>
  <li>call <tt>pack --unpack</tt></li>
  <li>create a log of the transaction, both in <tt>/var/log</tt> and in <tt>$confdir</tt> on the USB stick</li>
</ul>

<p>The authentication mechanism uses a MD5 hash of a well-known file.
(Below, it is the script itself.)</p>

<pre class="code">
idfile=$confdir/.idfile
serialnum=$confdir/.serialnum
md5sum $0 | tee ${serialnum} | tee "$(&lt;${idfile})"
</pre>

<p>The <tt>$serialnum</tt> will be automatically created in <tt>$confdir</tt>.
The <tt>$idfile</tt> contains the location (absolute path) of some file known only to the user.
This file must be manually edited (e.g. <tt>echo `pwd`/mysecretfile &gt; $idfile</tt>).
The trick is that the file <em>pointed to by</em> <tt>$idfile</tt> contains the same
hash value as the <tt>$serialnum</tt>.  Hence, the following happens at script invocation time: </p>

<pre class="code">
if ! [ -e "${serialnum}" -a -e "${idfile}" ] || [ "$(&lt;$(&lt;${idfile}))" != "$(&lt;${serialnum})" ]
then
   echo "Authentication procedure failed." &gt;&amp;2
   exit 1
fi
</pre>
<p>This means if some malicious other person tries to compromise your
computer with his forged USB stick, the process will fail
if (1) there is no <tt>$serialnum</tt> on the stick, (2) there is no <tt>$idfile</tt>
on the stick. Both of these could be accomplished but cost hacking and spoofing effort,
and more protection is provided by number (3):</p>

<pre class="code">
"$(&lt;$(&lt;${idfile}))" != "$(&lt;${serialnum})"
</pre>

<p>Translated: '<i>The contents of the file pointed to by <tt>$idfile</tt>
must match the contents of <tt>$serialnum</tt></i>'. To accomplish
this, intrusive hacking is needed. If you are paranoid about
security (sometimes not a bad idea), you can disable this mechanism
entirely. Statistically speaking, however, the theft of a laptop is far more
likely than such a planned intrusion.</p>

		<h3>The Big Picture</h3>

<p>Returning to the above screenshot with the local removal of a kernel,
this <a href="misc/renker/unpack_LOG.png">screenshot</a> shows the
log of what subsequently happened on the remote computer.  First the
'pre.2' file (a new kernel) is unpacked, followed by command execution
(where the old kernel is removed), finally the main archive is unpacked.</p>


	<h2>Further extensions</h2>

<div class="pullquotes">

</div>

<p>The next extension is a kind of <em>personal organiser</em> for taking
day-to-day notes such as important things to do, buy, or organise;
telephone numbers and URLs that are not to be forgotten; and the
like. It is actually very useful, as everything is in one place.</p> 


	      <h3>Note-taker</h3>
<p>Palmtops are horribly and unnecessarily expensive. Let's
code a part of their luxuriant functionality by storing notes in
<tt>$confdir</tt>; <a href="misc/renker/note-taking.png">here</a>
is an example screenshot. Since there are so many scripts already, a
(bash) <a href="misc/renker/note-function.txt">shell function</a>
is used for a change:</p>

<pre class="code">
function note() {
   test -t 0  &amp;&amp;  echo "Type in text, terminated by CTRL-D."
   if note=$(fold -s) &amp;&amp; test -n "$note";  then
      echo "at $(date): ${note}"  &gt;&gt;/vol/flash/.conf.d/notes
   fi
}
</pre>

The first test checks if input is from a keyboard (terminal) and prints
a prompt if so.  Otherwise, it will simply pipe from stdin into the
file. This allows very practical uses such as the following:

<pre class="code">
echo "CVS commit ID was $(cat /tmp/commit-id), done at $(date)" <b>| note</b>
</pre>


<p>To make this a complete system, convenient access to the notes is required.
One is built into the script already: notes can be accessed using <tt>pack --read</tt>.
More convenient is an <a href="misc/renker/read_pack_notes.sh.txt">Autostart script</a> 
(placed in <tt>~/.kde/Autostart</tt>). This  has the following core:</p>
<pre class="code">
kedit --caption "PACK NOTES" $notes &amp;
</pre>
This can easily be changed to suit your individual text viewer/editor of choice.
		
		<h3>How many MBRs fit on one stick?</h3>

<p>Nowadays, hard drive sizes of up to 500GB are no exception. However, on any
such disk there are 64 bytes which, when corrupted, can create a real hell
for an afternoon or two - the <em>partition table</em>, located in the
MBR. I've experienced it more than once that an MBR became damaged at some
time. I wouldn't wish the painful process of restoration to anyone.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ ...but see "<a
href="../issue63/okopnik.html">Clearing out the Master Boot Record</a>" in
issue 63. Perhaps this will convince you of the necessity of following
Gerrit's advice, if nothing else will. :) -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>Code to save the MBR on the stick is easy enough to add. Procedure
<tt>save_mbr</tt> is invoked before creating the archive and will copy
the MBR into <tt>$confdir</tt>.  It uses <tt>rdev(8)</tt> to determine
your root device:</p>

<pre class="code">
sub save_mbr {
  my $rdev = qx{/usr/sbin/rdev 2&gt;&amp;1}; 
  # ...
  system("dd if=$rdev of=$mbr bs=512 count=1") == 0 ||  warn "Cannot save MBR";
} 
</pre>

<p>
The warning shown in the last line will in particular appear if you
don't have read access to the device - you should make sure that you do,
which usually means running the script as root.
</p>


		<h2>Conclusions</h2> 

<p>
What I have presented here has evolved from real day-to-day use over the
period of three and a half years.
</p>

<p>I found the system so useful that I still prefer it to buying a laptop. 
Not only has it saved the expense of buying
costly gadgets, it is amazing how long the lifetime of a 'cheap' USB
stick actually is.  The most fragile part is the connector, for which
a warranty is given (usually about 10000 plug-ins and pull-outs). Mine
had cracked circuits, so I must have been past that - but it was easy to
fix; all that was needed was a soldering iron. On another occasion, I
accidentally forgot the stick in the laundry. After
drying, it worked fine ever after. I don't think
a laptop would survive comparable treatment: it is strange that more
expensive things are usually also more fragile.</p>

<p>I hope that the many programming hints throughout these two
parts will aid in modifying, to fit individual ideas and
requirements - creativity is not as easily exhausted as money.</p>
