One frequent problem faced by Linux adherents like me is the
difficulty of finding hardware which is supported by Linux. Here is
some hope for us::

It'll be interesting to see if it catches on. I see some business
aspects that would motivate a vendor to use it, but I also see things
that would have the average company aghast at the prospect. Given that
intellectual property is one of the traditional "core" investments in
the money world, I'm wondering what benefit can be extracted from this
(beyond scoring points with the Open Source crowd), and whether that
benefit will outweigh the loss of IP. Well... people who are more
business-savvy than me will be scrutinizing this and thinking about it.
It'll be interesting to see how it plays out.

With regard to finding hardware that's supported by Linux, the answer
these days is "most of it." You can find a number of Linux
"compatibility lists" on the Web, but for the most part, I find that a
modern distro usually "just works". Sure, there's the odd WiFi chipset
or the brand-new printer/scanner/fax/copier/floor sweeper/goat milking
machine with the ceiling painting attachment[1] - but for the greatest
part, it really is plug and play.

<p>
Oh, and - since I was just talking about it - I just installed and
configured Ubuntu for a fellow sailor, a Dutch guy who crosses the
Atlantic regularly. In return, he rebuilt the sole (floor) in my main
cabin, which was getting old and a bit too flexy. I'm very happy about
the exchange, and he's just ecstatic: he's been struggling with viruses
and spyware for ages, and all he ever wants to do is hook up via WiFi,
use his GMail account, and talk via Skype. He's also totally shocked by
how much faster his system runs now.
</p>

<p>
I can guarantee he doesn't think of Linux as either "zero cost" or "zero
value".

[1] The Linux driver for it isn't done yet, but should be available by
next Monday - and it'll be a kernel module by the next release.
