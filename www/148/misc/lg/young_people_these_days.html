Just a few minutes ago, I set my 6-month old son, Michael, on the table
in front of my laptop; several moments later, when I looked at the
'xterm', the commandline said
</p>

<pre>
perl -wle'print chr(rand(95) + 33) for 1..40'
</pre>

<p>
"Dear Ghod," I thought to myself. "They certainly do inherit bad habits
at a young age!"
</p>

<p>
(Yes, he was leaning on the 'up-arrow' cursor key while staring at the
screen. But he did stop at that particular entry... that's my boy.)

Kat and I have solemnly agreed that we had him purely for his
entertainment value (note the excellent, seamless backstory
construction, there.) He's quite low-maintenance, doesn't eat much,
hasnt (YET) demanded the family motorcycle keys, and provides us with
endless amusement.
</p>

<p>
For the past two days, he's been climbing Mount Daddy and standing up on
wobbly little legs, and trying to climb up on the table - which has been
the source of much merriment; I'm sure he's permanently psychologically
scarred by all this laughter despite our assurances that we're laughing
<em>with</em> him, not <em>at</em> him (his look of frowning, intense concentration is
just the whipped cream on top.) Kat's originally amusing comment of
"we're going to wake up to find him on top of the mast one of these
days" [1] is becoming less and less funny, and more realistic and scary,
as the days go by. He has also learned about taking headers (there's
about an 18" drop from the bed down to the settee) - and <strong>likes</strong> them.
</p>

<p>
He's a fearless little bugger, and is going to be an adrenaline junkie
when he grows up.
</p>


<p>
[1] This has since been extended to "...with a VHF radio, taunting the
passing boats into throwing a bigger wake so he can have a better ride!"
My glum prediction is that this, again, is going to be a hell of a lot
<strong>less</strong> funny when I have to climb 50 feet straight up to retrieve him.

Similar, but not <em>exactly</em> the same. I wasn't trying to surpass anyone
at that age. Most especially, I did not set a goal of doing so within
the next week...

This little 15-lb. package of focused intent can do more damage from a
non-root account than you could even imagine. I mean, have <strong>you</strong> ever
heard of a firewall designed to keep out drool??? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
