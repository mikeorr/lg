<h2>PostgreSQL Setup</h2>

<p>At the time I wrote this article, I was running the latest 9.0.1
version of PostgreSQL, but earlier versions of the database should work
as well.</p>

<p>Please refer to the documentation linked from
the <a href="peterson.html#references">References</a> section for
information about how to install PostgreSQL.  There's plenty of good
information out there, so I'm not going to replicate that here.</p>

<p>Copy the files found <a href="postgres">here</a> to your PostgreSQL
database server somewhere.  I wrote
the <a href="postgres/create.sh">create.sh</a> script to hopefully
simplify the process of pumping the DDL statements required to construct
this application into the database.  You'll still need to do a little
preliminary setup before this will work.  You'll have to compile and
install the PostgreSQL
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/pgcrypto.html">pgcrypto</a>
contrib module.  This module contains the cryptographic functions we'll
need to construct random numbers and our password hash values.  You'll
find the pgcrypto source in the contrib/pgcrypto directory of your
PostgreSQL source directory.  The pgcrypto module presumes you have the
libossp uuid and ssl development libraries installed.  These are
provided by libossp-uuid-dev and libssl-dev on Debian.  Type 'make' and
'make install' to build and install this module into your local
installation.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, the setup script presumes it will be run on
the database server itself.
The <a href="postgres/environment.sh">environment.sh</a> file configures
a handful of environment variables used by the setup script.  One of
these indicates that the global database administrator is named
'postgres'.  If that's wrong, edit to match.  This user must have ident
priviledge to connect to the local database.  In other words, your
pg_hba.conf file must have a line like:</p>

<p><pre>local all all ident map=mymapname</pre></p>

<p>and, assuming you are running the script as user 'auser' (modify to
match your actual username) your pg_ident.conf file must have a matching
map line like:</p>

<p><pre>mymapname auser postgres</pre></p>

<p>We also presume the database is listening on the standard port 5432 on
the localhost interface.  We have to ensure that we can connect to the
database using md5 authentication in order to setup and use the
application.  A simple catch-all rule to allow you to connect to any
database as any username on the same host might look like:</p>

<p><pre>hostnossl all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5</pre></p>

<p>pg_hba.conf will also need words about ::1/128 for localhost connections
if IPv6 is enabled, e.g.</p>

<p><pre>hostnossl all all ::1/128 md5</pre></p>

<p>If you have more particular security requirements, you are hopefully
in a position to know how to modify these configuration files as
appropriate.</p>

<p>With these preliminaries in place, run the script called 'create.sh'.
It will prompt for three passwords.  The first password is for the
database owner.  The database owner will own all of the tables and
functions in our example database.  The second password is for the user
we will use to access the public interface functions.  This user does
not have permission to access any other part of the database.  The last
password is for a user internal to our application, not a PostgreSQL
user like the first two users.  This user is an administrative user
(called 'admin') who is given the ability to change other user's
passwords.  Try logging in as 'admin' to the XForms application to see
how that affects the values of the usernames available to the change
password function.</p>

<p>If you want to start over, run the 'drop.sh' script to delete the
database and the associated roles.</p>
