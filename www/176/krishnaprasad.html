<h1>Knoppix Boot From PXE Server - a Simplified Version for Broadcom based NICs</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/krishnaprasad.html">Krishnaprasad K.</a>, <a href="../authors/katta.html">Shivaprasad Katta</a>, and <a href="../authors/bennet.html">Sumitha Bennet</a></b></p>


<h3>Why this article?</h3>
	<p> The intent of this article is to exhaustively capture every step of
booting Knoppix Live CD from a PXE Server. Booting Knoppix from PXE is a
straightforward task. But here we would like to pinpoint some areas where
we faced difficulties in booting Knoppix from a PXE server so that it may be
useful for those who might be facing the same issues. We were attempting to
automate system maintenance tasks such as performing system BIOS updates,
updating firmware of system peripherals such as storage controllers, NICs,
etc. We planned to boot Knoppix from PXE and then customize it to execute
the .BIN upgrade packages (For upgrading system component firmware). We
came across the Knoppix Live CD and its' Howtos but we still hit
roadblocks which had to be sorted out before we could boot Knoppix
successfully from PXE on a Broadcom NIC-based system.</p>

<h3> Introduction:- </h3>
	<p>Knoppix is an amazing "one CD does it all" distro where you can
customize it and use it for running your customized programs. About 1900MB
of software compressed and stuck on a 700MB CD, with everything from sed to
Openoffice. Knoppix 6.2 DVD comes with lot of packages so most of the
needed programs / packages are covered in the DVD. Making it network boot
capable will be an advantage as we dont need to run around for a CD/DVD.
This article talks about how to create Knoppix Live CD/DVD PXE Boot capable
and the points to be noted if you use any Broadcom card as the PXE Bootable
NIC</p> 

<h3>Our setup:-</h3>
	<p> This article does not cover on how to create a PXE setup assuming
that the readers will have the knowledge to setup a PXE server. Refer the
following link <a
href="http://linux-sxs.org/internet_serving/pxeboot.html">for setting up a
PXE Server.</a></p>
	
<blockquote>
<h4>Requirements:-</h4>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>A system with a CD/DVD Drive to boot Knoppix Live CD  (preferably
Knoppix 6.2.1 which is the latest release) .</li>
<li>A PXE server configured in your network. </li>
<li>A system running a NFS server. This is for holding the content of the
images that we are going to PXEBoot. The same PXE server can be used for
setting up the NFS Server for holding root filesystem.</li>
<li>Now you need the Knoppix Live CD ISO image burnt onto media. If you
have downloaded a Knoppix version of different langauage other than
English, you need to pass the param lang=us while booting to the live CD.
No one will download a different language version but it can happen. :-) </li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p><strong>That's it. You are ready to start... </strong></p>

<h3>Generating the required files - kernel (named vmlinuz)  and initrd images</h3>
	
<p>Knoppix has the built-in ability to auto-configure itself to network
boot itself, and this makes the process rather easy. Boot into the Live CD
(runlevel 5 - default one). Follow the steps to create the necessary
files:</p>
		
<ul>
<li> Start Knoppix Terminal server by going to Preferences Section in Start menu.</li>
<li>Note that this service will start DHCP server. So if you have a local
network where some other DHCP server is already running, make sure that
there is no network connection to this system till you complete creating
initrd image.</li>
<li>Follow the online instructions. During the creation of initrd and
vmlinuz, you will be prompted to "Choose network card(s) to support/probe
on client machines:". Make sure that you select all the required drivers
that you need in your client boxes. Drivers like bnx2,e1000 will be
included by default. But it's worth going through the list to include some
of the wireless drivers as well.</li>
<li>If you need root access in your client boxes, then make sure that you
disable "Secure: Disable Root access on client(s) option".</li>
<li>If you have any specific kernel parameters to be passed while booting
Knoppix on client boxes, you can even mention that in one of the steps.
Once all the above inputs are given, start running the server so that it
will create a kernel image and initrd image which contains the very limited
required drivers to boot into the client boxes.</li>
<li>Check the /tftpboot/ directory and there you can see files vmlinuz and
miniroot.gz. These are the kernel and initrd images respectively.</li>
<li>Copy these files to your PXE Server's /tftpboot/ directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Create an entry for Knoppix in your PXE Server menu  (/tftpboot/pxelinux.cfg/default) as below:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>
		<dl>
		<dt>label Knoppix</dt>
    		<dt>kernel /path/to/vmlinuz</dt>
	        <dt>append nfsdir=NFS Server IP:/path/to/knoppix-CD-DVD-contents/ nodhcp lang=us ramdisk_size=100000 init=/etc/init apm=power-off nomce vga=791 initrd=/path/to/miniroot.gz</dt>
		</dl>
</strong>
<p> - where vmlinuz is the kernel image that we created from Knoppix Live
CD and miniroot.gz is the initrd image. Note that the complete Knoppix
CD/DVD contents is available at the NFS Server mentioned in the
Requirements list.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>NFS Server Configuration</h3>
<p>Installing an NFS server is beyond the scope of this document; however,
this will give you what's needed to configure your NFS server.</p>

In /etc/exports on the system (NFS Server), make sure that the share noted below is exported:
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt><strong>/path/to/Knoppix-CD-DVD-contents *(ro,no_root_squash,async)</strong></dt>
	</dl></blockquote>

Note how this matches up with the initial nfsdir parameter in the
original knoppix pxelinux.cfg/default file. Do <em>exportfs -a</em> to make
the share visible to the outer world.
	
		<blockquote><dl><dt><strong>...&lt;NFS Server IP&gt;:/path/to/knoppix-CD-DVD-contents/...</strong></dt></dl></blockquote>

	<p>As mentioned above, copy the entire Knoppix CD/DVD contents to the
above-mentioned NFS share. Knoppix expects to mount a directory over NFS
and see the folder "KNOPPIX" right there. So In our NFS Server setup we
changed <em>nfsdir</em> line to match our server's IP address, and then
added an export on our NFS server as above.</p>

	<p>That's it. Your NFS Server is ready with Knoppix contents and now
it's time to boot the client boxes with Knoppix.</p>

<h3> Hold on... Do you use Broadcom Network cards as PXE Bootable devices in your client boxes??</h3>

	<p> <em>This is the heart of this article.</em> Till now you may have
seen other documentation which talks about booting Knoppix from Intel-based
PXE.  If your setup has a Broadcom-based PXE-enabled NIC, the same steps
wouldn't get you to boot your system successfully. This article highlights
why you run into those issues and how you can get rid of them.</p>
	
	<p>The Knoppix initrd image  (miniroot.gz)  is going to fail in the
client boxes where you use Broadcom cards... why? :-( Here is the
solution :-)</p>

	<p>As far as Broadcom drivers  (eg/- bnx2)  are concerned, it is
required to load the firmware image while loading bnx2 driver module to the
kernel. Under some circumstances, as explained below, it would be
interesting to keep firmware images in non-swappable kernel memory or even
in the kernel image (probably within initramfs).	   
	<blockquote>
	<dl>
	<dt>
	- If the device that needs the firmware is needed to access the
	  filesystem. If due to some error the device has to be reset and the
firmware reloaded, it won't be possible to get it from userspace.</dt>
	<dt><blockquote><strong>example:-</strong> <em>A diskless client with a
network card that needs firmware. The filesystem is stored in a disk behind
a scsi device that needs firmware. This is because in our case, real
Knoppix image sits in NFS share which needs to be accessed via the NIC that
we boot the kernel and initrd image of Knoppix.</em></blockquote></dt>
	</dl>
	</blockquote>
	</p>

	So for making the Knoppix PXE Bootable in this case, you will have to
have the firmware images available in the initial ramdisk image  (initrd)
and then make it available at the time of driver load. Here are the
steps/commands with a small piece of code for doing the same :

		<ol>
		<li> You need to recreate the initrd image by having the firmware
images available in it.</li>
		<li> In your PXE Server, copy the initrd image  (miniroot.gz)  to a
temporary directory (let's create /tmp/temp_knoppix in the PXE Server
itself).</li>
		<li> Unzip the initrd image copied to the temporary directory using
<em>gunzip miniroot.gz</em></li>
		<li> Extract the contents of initrd image using <em>cpio -id < miniroot</em></li>
			<blockquote>- Note that this command will extract miniroot cpio
package and hence it would be better to create a temporary directory and
extract the contents to it.</blockquote>
		<li> Now you can see a bunch of directories created in the
temporary directory.Create a directory for copying the firmware image </li>
		<li><em>cd /tmp/temp_knoppix</em></li>
		<li><em>mkdir lib/firmware/ -p</em></li>
		<li><em>Copy the firmware images from Knoppix Live CD to the initrd image using scp </em></li>
			<blockquote> - Note that it's better to copy the whole
<em>lib/firmware</em> directory to initrd as there are different firmware
images of different drivers. In the future it will help if you want to make use
of same initrd for different devices.</blockquote>
		<li>Once firmware images are copied create a hotplug script to load
the firmware image to the kernel when insmod is called. Create a directory
sbin in initrd image using <em>mkdir sbin/</em></li>
		<li> Create a script named <em>hotplug</em> inside the sbin directory.
The content of the script is as below:
		<pre class="code">
	
		#!/bin/sh
		[ -z "$FIRMWARE" ] &amp;&amp; exit 
		echo 1 &gt; /sys/$DEVPATH/loading
		cat /lib/firmware/bnx2/$FIRMWARE &gt; /sys/$DEVPATH/data
		echo 0 &gt; /sys/$DEVPATH/loading
		
		</pre></li>
		<dl>
		<dt>- Where $DEVPATH and $FIRMWARE are already defined in the
environment. Note that this script is for loading bnx2 driver successfully
while PXE-Booting Knoppix. if you use any other Broadcom devices which make
use of other broadcom drivers  (like bnx2x) , you need to change the script
and mention the path to that driver's firmware path.
		</li>
		<blockquote>Refer <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/firmware_class/"> to know more about the need of loading the firmware image while loading the driver.</a></blockquote>
		</ol>
		<dl>
		<dt>11. Make the script executable by <em>chmod +x sbin/hotplug</em></dt>
		<dt>12. Now we have made changes to the initrd content and it's time to recreate the initrd image.. Follow the instructions as below</dt>
		<dt>13. <em>cd /tmp/temp_knoppix/</em></dt>
		<dt>14. <em>find ./ | cpio -H newc -o >../initrd.cpio</em></dt>
		<dt>15. <em>cd ..</em></dt>
		<dt>16. <em>gzip initrd.cpio</em></dt>
		<dt>17. <em>mv initrd.cpio.gz miniroot.gz</em></dt>
		</dl>
<p> Now Replace the old initrd inside /tftpboot/path-to/miniroot.gz by
newly created miniroot.gz inside /tmp/</p>

<p><strong>There you go - you are done with the configuration and recreation of initrd!</strong></p>

	
<h3> Test your Knoppix Boot from PXE!</h3>

	<p> Boot your client boxes to PXE menu and enter Knoppix as the boot
option. This will load vmlinz and miniroot.gz. There you go! You can change
the miniroot.gz initrd image to add your own programs and executables such
that you create your own live CD booting from PXE Server.</p>

	<p> There are lot of advantages as you can test your own program if any
during/after bootup, with out installing it on any OS. This is completely
driven out of NFS share! This setup can be used extensively in academic
institutions, schools and for hands-on sessions in workshops with addition
of ample custom settings.</p>

<strong> We would like to convey our gratitude and thanks to Knoppix User
Forum for helping us to solve this problem!</strong>
