<strong><p>
Do you know if the Reveal SC400 rev 4a soundcard is directly
supported by Redhat 5.0 and how would I go about setting it up under
Linux if it isn't?
</p></strong>

<strong><p>
I'm not really sure but I think this card was manufactured by Aztech
for Reveal if it helps any

>Sound drivers is one area that I know less about than
X.  I've never used them much (under Linux, DOS, or Windows)
and I know nothing special about them.

<blockquote>You might try a 2.1.xxx kernel (since there was a quite a 
bit of work done on those drivers back in the 2.1.70's
or 2.1.80's).  You could also look at the OSS/Linux
(open sound system), which is at:

<blockquote>... this is unusual in the Linux community in that the 
authors of this commercial (shareware?) package are also
the principle authors of the sound drivers that are built
into the Linux kernel (called OSS/Free).  This oddity has
been debated a bit --- but the widely held opinion is 
that the overall benefits outweigh the concerns. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anyone who really doesn't like this arrangement is 
free to derive their own version and enhancements 
off of the code that has been contributed to the the
Linux kernel --- which is why it is still in compliance
with the GPL.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>The commercial OSS only costs $20 and the authors seem to 
contribute as much back to the freeware/GPL code as they
reasonably can (they have to sign NDA's --- non-disclosure
agreements to get the specs for some cards).  
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Looking at their web site I note that the Reveal SC300
is listed --- which suggests that the SC400 is not
currently supported (unless it is also known as the
Wave Extreme Pro).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>In any event, check out their web site yourself for details.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>And, once again, remember, if you want it supported under
Linux, you have your choices --- and if you buy it despite
the lack of support then you are <em>failing</em> to communicate
your prefences back to the hardware vendors in any meaningful way.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>I've taken the liberty of copying the 
<A HREF="mailto:support@opensound.com">support@opensound.com</A>
(the OSS support people) on this request so that they can
comment on, or clarify anything that I've said.
