Hi Jim...I'm new to Linux and am trying to install Redhat version 5.1. I
get as far as the keyboard password and my keyboard will not allow me to
type any characters.  It will allow me to tab or use the arrows but the
keys do not move when pressed.  I do not know who to ask for help and
while browsing the linux site, I came across your name. Can you give me
any advice as to how to get around the Root Password problem.  Do I go
into setup and check to see if I have Aami Bios and make changes?  I'll
look forward to hearing from you.
</STRONG></P>

Thanks,
Joe D'Albert

If I understand you correctly -- you are just confused.
The fact that the installation's prompt (dialog) for
establishing the root password doesn't echo any characters,
stars, nor even register/respond with cursor movements
is PERFECTLY NORMAL.  (It's a feature.  It's supposed to
work that way.  Don't worry about it.  Just type "blind").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's going to ask you to repeat the password (any password
you choose) twice.  That's to ensure that you know what you
typed. (The assumption is that you're unlikely to make the
same typo or mistype twice in a row --- so if the two
entries match one another, than you can probably manage to
keep typing your password that way forever).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that it usually will do the same thing after you've
got the whole system installed and configured.  When you
login, it will ask for a password.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When a Linux system prompts you for a password during
login --- you won't see any characters or cursor movement
as you type.  This is intended to prevent someone from
watching over your shoulder, even to find out <EM>how many</EM>
characters are in your password.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Just type you password slowly and carefully.  Make sure not
to miss any keystrokes (by hitting the keys squarely) and
make sure not to "bounce" the keys --- getting "double
images" for some characters.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As long as you do that you should be fine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I noticed that Lotus Notes used to respond to each keypress
in the password prompt by echoing a small random number (2
to 5?) of *'s.  This was a convenient way to give keyboard
feedback without revealing your password length.  Many
systems will echo *'s for each character typed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Incidentally the Linux passwords have NOTHING to do with any
CMOS/Setup (BIOS) passwords that you may have on your
system.  Linux (and other forms of Unix) are multi-user
systems.  They maintain a list of accounts (in the
<TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file) that provide for all access to the
system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The main benefit of this is that you can create a
Joe account (joe, jdalbert or jda or ja or whatever
reasonable login name you want to use).  You normally long
in under this account.  While using your account you run
very little risk of damaging any system files.  If you run a
"bad" program --- that program will usually be unable to
damage the system (infect system binaries with a virus, for
example).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You should only use the 'root' account for
maintaining the system --- almost exclusively for adding new
accounts, disabling old ones, and installing or upgrading
your main system software.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can use the 'passwd' command to change your password at
any time.  If you forget your personal (joe) password you
can login as root and issue a command like 'passwd joe' to
force a change on the password for any account on the
system.  (Thus, if you create an account for your wife,
girlfriend, kid, roommate, dog, cat or whatever --- and they
forget their password --- can't get it back for them, but
you can just give them a new one).  Read the 'passwd' and
'usermod' man pages for details on that and other tricks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you should ever lose the root password you can reboot
the system (in single-user mode, or possibly you'll need a
rescue diskette --- if 'sulogin' is configured).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you've booted from diskette you'll have to mount
the filesystems that you normally boot from (usually
something like <TT>/dev/hda3</TT> for a partition on your first IDE
drive, or <TT>/dev/hdb1</TT> for one on your 2nd IDE, or <TT>/dev/sda1</TT>
for one on your first SCSI drive).  Let's say you mount that
under <TT>/mnt/</TT>  (this is the <em>floppy diskette's</em> <TT>/mnt</TT>
directory.  Once you've done that you'd change (cd) into
that directory, and use a command like '<TT>chroot . /bin/sh</TT>'
--- which essentially "locks you into" that (floppy's <TT>/mnt</TT>)
directory <EM>as though it were the root directory</EM>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(This process is a bit confusing --- but the purpose is to
let you do the rest of these commands as though you'd booted
from the hard drive in the first place.  You could skip this
step if you know how to issue all of the following commands
while adjusting for the floppy/factor).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From there you can use a text editor on the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT>
(and possibly the <TT>/etc/shadow)</TT> files, or you issue the
'passwd' command to force a change to '<tt>root</tt>'s password.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you booted from floppy/rescue diskette, you'd now type
"<tt>exit</tt>" (to exit from the 'chroot shell' that you invoked
above).  Then you'd unmount ('<tt>umount</tt>') the filesystems that
you'd used and reboot.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Note:  If the last five paragraphs sounded confusing and
intimidating --- take it as a warning: DON'T LOSE YOUR ROOT
PASSWORD!   You can recover from it, but you have to do some
fussing.  If you lose <EM>any</EM> other user's password, you can
just log in as '<tt>root</tt>' and do a forced change to fix it.).
