...and it's quite the story. Not because of us specifically, but because
theplanet is such a huge data center - i.e., it's causing a huge outage
all over the place.
</p>

<p>
To quote Doug Erwin of theplanet (issued at 10:46 PM, May 31 2008):
</p>

<pre>
   This evening at 4:55pm CDT in our H1 data center, electrical gear
   shorted, creating an explosion and fire that knocked down three walls
   surrounding our electrical equipment room. Thankfully, no one was
   injured. In addition, no customer servers were damaged or lost.
   
   We have just been allowed into the building to physically inspect the
   damage. Early indications are that the short was in a high-volume wire
   conduit. We were not allowed to activate our backup generator plan based
   on instructions from the fire department.
   
   This is a significant outage, impacting approximately 9,000 servers and
   7,500 customers. All members of our support team are in, and all vendors
   who supply us with data center equipment are on site. Our initial
   assessment, although early, points to being able to have some service
   restored by mid-afternoon on Sunday. Rest assured we are working around
   the clock.
</pre>

<p>
Our publication process is rolling on regardless of this, of course. In
principle, we should be back up pretty much as soon as theplanet is. For
the moment, if anyone needs to contact me, I'll be monitoring this
linuxmafia.com address.

What would cause that??  Glad no one was hurt and no data was lost...

A fairly close paraphrase from memory, from one of the HGttG books:
<pre>
   Ford:  "I've discovered that there are eddies in the time-space continuum."
   Arthur:  "What?"
   Ford:  "Eddies.... in the time-space continuum."
   Arthur:  "Ah, is he really?"
