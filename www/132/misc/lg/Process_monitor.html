Hi,
</p>

<p>
I am facing a problem with one of my services which needs to be constantly
monitored and restarted in case it dies. I was just wondering if there is a
command / program / script which can be placed in crontab to monitor a
process and restart it if its dead. Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
Brian.

On a larger scale nagios can do that for you too,
It allows you to define actions once one of the monitorred services goes 
down.

That might be overkill for this, I am not sure since the querent gives
no indication as to which processes or how many.  
</p>

<p>
Over the years, I have seen many people try various incantations of the
following:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
[ "$(ps aux | grep '[p]rogramName')" ] || programName &amp;
</pre>
Particularly in crontabs and the like.  But that's just <strong>wrong</strong>.  In
situations such as that the 'daemontools' package should be used (since
that's effectively the operation they're wanting to do).
</p>

<p>
Other methods of this (and this one is only slightly better) is to try
something like:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
 
# Start the program
programName &amp;
 
# Get the PID
thepid=$!
 
while sleep 60; do
  if kill -0 $mypid; then
     # Process is running...
  else
     # Process not running....
  fi
done
</pre>
The above works because signal "0" doesn't exist.

Agreed, however replacing the distribution provided startup/shutdown 
script setup with daemontools is far from trivial in most cases.

<p>
I like this approach, this can be integrated with existing startup 
scripts without much problems and still monitor the service for being up.
</p>

<p>
That doesn't take into account that a lot of daemons can be running 
while not "being up" as perceived by a user. That would require more 
elaborate checking against expected behavior from the server (f.e. can I 
login to this POP server with my password)

P.S&gt; Thomas, thanks for the CC, but I'm on-list so there's no need.

But you wouldn't do that anyway, I should hope.

<p>
What's with this fascination of init scripts?  ;) Most daemons that
<strong>are</strong> daemons (i.e. written as such) are only ever started up in this
way.

<p>
You get that for free because I replied with 'send all'.  Upadate your
MDA to handle the Cc.  I never did understand people that complained
about this on mailing-lists -- it's very easily fixed.  ;)
