"." in root's path is unsafe!! (was: a.out binaries not working)
</font> </H3>
<BR>Date: Sat, 12 Jun 1999 14:58:28 -0400
<BR>From: "Peter V. Inskeep" <pinskeep@iglou.com>

<P> In Linux Gazette, Issue # 42, I provided an answer to the question of
getting an a.out binary to run.  I suggested that typing "./a.out" (sans
quotes) would do the trick.  I went on to suggest that the "current
directory" be added to the path to avoid the bother of typing ./ before
the name of the binary to be run.

<P> Several have written to me to point out that adding ./ to the path is
not good practice from a security viewpoint.  Therefore, I urge anyone
who has added the ./ to their path after reading my answer, remove it.
Instead, just get in the practice of typing ./myprogramname when one
wants to run a binary in the current directory.

<P> I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Alex B., Art W., and
Pete in the UK for taking the time to write me notes explaining the
pitfalls of putting dot slash (./) in one's PATH.  This is especially
true for root, but apparently not good practice for anyone.  As I
understand it, a transgressor could easily put a program with evil
intentions, but with a common name, such as "ls," in one of your
commonly used directories.  Next time you type ls on the command line,
the evil program is run rather than the ls directory display program.
This is so if one had modified one's PATH to include ./.  If one had to
include ./ in one's path, make sure it is at the end of the PATH
statement.

<P> Thanks for giving me this opportunity to correct the bad information I
presented.  Also, thanks again to those who took the time to write to me
to explain the consequences of adding ./ to the PATH statement.

<P> Pete, NO2D

<P><PRE>
&gt; Try running the a.out binary with the command line: ./a.out I recently
&gt; installed RedHat 5.2 and found that its $PATH statement does not include
&gt; a path of " ./: " ./ is the path of the current directory that you are
&gt; in. Remarkably, RedHat does not set up paths so that your current path 
&gt; is looked at to execute a file. 
</PRE>

<P> There is a good reason for RedHat (and hopefully all the Linux distributers)
not to include '.' in your PATH. Its a security risk. Now, you may be OK on
a non-networked system but I don't think it is a good habit to get into. 

The following is quoted from the Path Mini HOWTO:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<H4>12.  Security concerns</H4>

	<P> The path is sometimes a big security problem.  It is a very common
	way to hack into a system using some mistakes in path settings.  It is
	easy to make Trojan horse attacks if hacker gets root or other users to
	execute his versions of commands.

	<P> A common mistake in the past (?) was to keep '.' in the root's path.
	Malicious hacker makes program 'ls' in his home directory.  If root
	makes
	<PRE>
	     # cd ~hacker
	     # ls
	</PRE>

	he executes ls command of hacker's.

<P> If you find it absolutely
necessary to include . in your path, at least put it as the last entry
in your path so that the system binaries are searched before '.' is.

<P> This would only be remarkable to a DOS user.  The inclusion of .
in $PATH exposes the user to trojan horses.  It should never appear in
root's $PATH, and I don't like it in mine either.

<P> When setting up you .exrc file for vi you can use the map command to map
the function keys in addtion to the few unassigned 'normal' keys.  
Example:
<PRE>
	map #1 :set nu

this makes F1 turn line numbering on.

<P> maybe you already know this, but .tar and .gz files can be unpacked under
Windows using Winzip 7

<P> All the README-files (and every other plain-text file for that matter) can
be opened with Notepad/Wordpad.

<P> Also, if you use a Windows filesystem on you floppies ( vfat ), you can read
'em under Windows, but you can also mount them RW on any linux which has
vfat support compiled into the kernel (most distributions have, trust me :-)

<P> If you use StarOffice 5, then you can use Office 97 files to exchange data,
cuz SO5 uses an O97-compatible file format.

<P> This is not exclusively a Linux trick of course but here it goes:

<P> If you've changed your web site structure and thereby removed a previous
entry page (the first page a visitor comes to) which may have links to it you
could link that page to your current entry page.

<P> I removed my foreword.htm some time ago and later found a stale link on a
foreign page leading to the missing page. So I simply created a link to my
current toc.html.  Now whenever someone follows the original link, instead of
getting a 404 they get the toc.html.

<font color="navy">Make modem ignore funny dial tones
</font> </H3>
<BR>Date: Fri, 4 Jun 1999 14:24:18 -0400 (EDT)
<BR>From: Matt Willis <matt@optimus.cee.cornell.edu>

On my telephone line, I have voice mail. The dialtone is different when
there is a message waiting. This causes my modem (USR 56k) to get confused
and quit, saying "No dialtone". Effectively, this breaks any automated
dialup routines, such as a cron daemon to fetch mail in the middle of the
night. To ignore dial tones, I added ATX3 to my modem codes:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> This is no longer true for LinuxPPC (including revision 4) or YDL, although
it's still true for MkLinux.  The partition limit was due to a kernel
problem that disappeared somewhere in the 2.1.x series...use a 2.2.x kernel
and you'll be fine.  (I am using a 4GB partition quite happily with
LinuxPPC R4 right now, with an uptime of several months.)

<P> Midnight Commander allows you to show an FTP-site in one pane and
your local file system in the other. You can acces the FTP-site like
you would a local directory (i.c. F5: copy, F6: move/rename, etc...)

<P> Pete,

<P> I think the tcp wrapper daemon (tcpd) should do the trick.
In /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny you can use constructs like daemon@host
that will accomplish what you need (sort of).

<P> Try:
<PRE>
      man tcpd
      man 5 hosts_access (look for 'SERVER ENDPOINT PATTERNS')

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P> Just read issue 41 and read the great article about direct cable
	connections between Win95 and Linux, I tried implementing this method
	but came across a couple of problems running Windows 98. (4.10.1998)

	<P> I can get terminal emulation (using HyperTerminal) running at 38400
	baud but 115200 crashes at the password prompt. (115200 works with
	xon/xoff using kermit as the terminal program). 

	<P> Can't figure out how to get Windows to dial out over the serial
	line as in your article. I tried creating a new modem using the modems
	wizard in the control panel using 'standard serial between 2 PC's' and
	it goes through the process reporting success at the end but no device
	appears anywhere.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The problem is in Win95/98.  It does not come with a null modem
driver.  Windows assumes that you are using a REAL modem complete
with AT commands, etc.  If all you have is a null serial cable
between the Win95 box and the Linux PPP server, then Win95 cannot
be used because it cannot be set up unless you use a modem and a
phone line.

<P> However, there IS a null modem driver.  You install this driver
by copying it to c:\WINDOWS\INF  (a hidden directory).  You can
then install a new modem.  Select not to detect, but you will
pick it from a list.  When you get to the list, it will be at
the top of the list of manufacturers, and you can select the
generic null modem driver.

<P> This driver has been around the internet for years, but I have
put it up on my ftp server.

<P> I have no problem then using my Win95 computers with terminal
servers such as my Livingstons.  It works a LOT faster than
using a Modem, and communications is typically 115,200.
