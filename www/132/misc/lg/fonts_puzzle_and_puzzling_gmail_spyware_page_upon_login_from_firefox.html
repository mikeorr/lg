Hi All,
</p>

<p>
  Has anyone else come across this gmail "spyware"
  page when trying to log into gmail using Firefox?
</p>

<p>
    [ Snipped image ]
</p>

<p>
  As you can imagine, it plays havoc with the gmail
  notifier extension, as well as making me doubt
  my ability to read, each time I try to log in.
  (Trying to type in the contents of the squiggly
   message displayed in the box seems to be a task
   my brain is almost incapable of handling early
   in the morning).
  So I'm wondering, is this something Firefox is
  doing to annoy gmail? Or just something
  gmail has started doing to annoy all their users?
</p>

<p>
  Another question: I've come across this after updating
  Debian testing: I seem to be loosing fonts, or at least
  the helvetica font I need for vncviewer and imagemagic:
</p>

<p>
  For example, "display image.jpg" gives me:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
display: unable to load font
`-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
display: unable to load font
`-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
</pre>
  And vncviewer gives me this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
$ vncviewer wherever:2
VNC server supports protocol version 3.7 (viewer 3.3)
Password:
VNC authentication succeeded
Desktop name "wherever:2 (myusername)"
Connected to VNC server, using protocol version 3.3
VNC server default format:
 16 bits per pixel.
 Least significant byte first in each pixel.
 True colour: max red 31 green 63 blue 31, shift red 11 green 5 blue 0
Warning: Cannot convert string
"-*-helvetica-bold-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-*" to type FontStruct
Warning: Unable to load any usable ISO8859 font
Warning: Unable to load any usable ISO8859 font
Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion
Warning: Unable to load any usable fontset
Error: Aborting: no font found
</pre>
  I tried searching for explanations, and as far as
  I can tell I've got all the font packages installed.
  I attach the output from running
<pre>
    dpkg --get-selections &gt; /tmp/dpkg--get-selections
</pre>
  in case it could be helpful.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  I have a machine running Debian stable, and both
  "display" and "vncviewer" are working fine, but
  comparing the strace hasn't gotten me very far.
  I was wondering if anyone would have any hints,
  I've not much experience / understanding of X11 fonts.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Peter.
</p>

(For the record, the referenced Google-issued error message was:  "We're
sorry... but your query looks similar to automated requests from a
computer virus or spyware application.  To protect our users, we can't
process your request right now.  We'll restore your access as quickly as
possible, so try again soon. In the meantime, if you suspect that your
computer or network has been infected, you might want to run a virus
checker or spyware remover to make sure that your systems are free of
viruses and other spurious software.  We apologize for the
inconvenience, and hope well see you again on Google.")

<p>
Might it have actually been the <em>frequency</em> of queries from that IP?
Searching on the error text turns up a bunch of discussion of the error
message in various Google contexts.  Apparently, it used to say "We're
sorry... but we can't process your request right now.  A computer virus
or spyware application is sending us automated requests, and it appears
that your computer network has been infected.  We'll restore your access
as quickly as possible, so try again soon.  In the meantime, you might
want to run a virus checker [link] or spyware remover [link] to make
sure that your computer is free of viruses and other spurious software.
We apologise for the inconvenience, and hope we'd see you later on
Google."
</p>

<p>
Posters talking about this error condition say the IP block lapses
automatically after 30 - 60 minutes.  
</p>

<p>
The real mystery is what specific heuristics Google is using to spot 
activity patterns that it considers "similar to automated requests from
a computer virus or spyware application".  Understandably, this isn't
the sort of information <em>any</em> such firm is likely to be talkative about
-- and Google, Inc. is not exactly the most publicly transparent of
firms at the best of times.

(Sorry, I changed the subject of the thread as
   otherwise it tends to trigger the TAG list's filters,
   as explained earlier by Rick.)

  It turned out that the missing fonts problem with "display"
  and "vncviewer" giving messages like:
<pre>
    display: unable to load font
      `-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
</pre>
  was cured by restarting the entire X11 session.
  Apparently something must have gotten fairly
  mixed up during the dist-upgrade. I actually ended up
  doing a full reboot, as the display went completely black
  after exiting the X11 session.
</p>




<p>
  On the topic of the gmail login issue (the additional
  requirement to retype some of the squiggly letters before
  being allowed to proceed to the login page) thanks to Rick
  for typing in all of the content of the message for me,
  I should have done that myself.
</p>

<p>
  When composing my email, I tried to refer back to the message
  so that I could "cut-n-paste" it (I know, I should not be so lazy <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">,
  but it no longer occurred for a while.
  So I ended up logging in and out of gmail for a while, trying
  to get the message again so that I could describe it.
  After all that, I was so flustered that I completely forgot
  to describe the message in plain english. Which would
  probably have been sufficient and better than attaching
  the image in the first place like I did.
</p>

<p>
  It just goes to show how disconcerting it can be to try
  to <strong>use</strong> the communication program you're having trouble
  with, to actually communicate <strong>about</strong> it.
</p>

<p>
  Anyways, the gmail login troubles seem to indeed go away
  after a certain timeout, but in my experiments it seems
  that by using the "gmail notifier" extension it brings
  them back again. Perhaps they're somehow misinterpreting
  the actions of the gmail notifier extension.
</p>

<p>
Peter.
