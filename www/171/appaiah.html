<h1>Random signatures with Mutt</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/appaiah.html">Kumar Appaiah</a></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Ever since the start of the Internet, electronic mail has been a
mainstay for communication. Even as new social networking
phenomena such as online-friend connection databases and
microblogging are taking communication on the Web by storm, e-mail still
remains a preferred means of communication for both personal and
official purposes, and is unlikely to fade away soon.
</p>

<p>
One aspect of e-mail that we often observe is the sender's
signature - the tiny blurb that appears on the bottom. If it's an
official e-mail, then you're most likely constrained to keep it something
sober that talks about your position at work, or similar
details. However, if you are mailing friends, or a mailing list, then
wouldn't it be nice to have a signature that is customized and/or
chosen from a random set of signatures? Several Web-based e-mail services
offer this already; a cursory Web search reveals that services such as
GMail offer this feature. However, the customizability is limited, and
you are restricted in several ways. However, if you use a customizable mail
client like Mutt, several fun things can be done with e-mail
signatures, using more specific details that are within your control.
</p>

<p>
In this article, I describe one of the possible ways of having random
signatures in your e-mail in the <a
href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> mail client, and switching
signature themes and styles based on certain characteristics, such
your inbox or recipient. I will, therefore, assume that you have a
working configuration for Mutt ready, though the concept I describe
applies equally well to other mail clients which support this, such as
Pine. I'll make use of the <tt>BSD/Unix fortune</tt> program
(available in almost all GNU/Linux and *BSD distributions) in this
article, though any solution that chooses random quotes would do.
</p>

<h3>Preparation: collect your signatures for <tt>fortune</tt></h3>

<p>
The Unix <tt>fortune</tt> program is a simple program that uses a
database of strings (called "fortunes") to randomly choose a string
and display it onto the screen. The program is named appropriately,
since it uses a collection of files on various subjects to display
messages, much like those on fortune cookies.
</p>

<p>
It is usually easy to install the program on most GNU/Linux
distributions. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu-like systems, the
following command will fetch the fortune program and several databases
of strings:
</p>

<pre>
apt-get install fortune-mod fortunes
</pre>

<p>
Similarly, <tt>yum install fortune-mod</tt> should help on Red
Hat/Fedora-like systems. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to
install it on your GNU/Linux or BSD distribution.
</p>

<p>
Once installed, you can test out the existing files. For example, on
my Debian machine, the following command lists a random signature from
one of the <tt>/usr/share/games/fortunes/linux</tt> or
<tt>/usr/share/games/fortunes/linuxcookie</tt> files:
</p>

<pre>
fortune linux linuxcookie
</pre>

<p>
If you now open one of the files in
<tt>/usr/share/games/fortunes/</tt>, such as <tt>linux</tt>, you'll
observe that they consist of strings which are separated by the "%"
sign, resembling the format of this file:
</p>

<pre>
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
%
A stitch in time saves nine.
%
Haste makes waste
</pre>

<p>
Also, associated with each file, such as <tt>linux</tt>, is a
<tt>.dat</tt> file, e.g. <tt>linux.dat</tt>. The way <tt>fortune</tt>
works is that it looks for the file specified at the command line,
(absent such a command line option, choosing a random file among those
in the path searched by default), and looks for a corresponding .dat
file, which has a table of file offsets for locating strings in that
file. If it doesn't find the dat file corresponding to a text file
with signatures, it ignores that file.
</p>

<p>
While you can use the signatures present already, if you want to
create and use your own signatures, get them from wherever you want,
and place them in a file, separated by % signs as discussed above. For
example, I'll put the above file in a location called
$HOME/Signatures. Let me call my file $HOME/Signatures/adages. To use
it with <tt>fortune</tt>, I use the <tt>strfile</tt> program to
generate the table of offsets:
</p>

<pre>
[~/Signatures] strfile adages
"adages.dat" created
There were 3 strings
Longest string: 38 bytes
Shortest string: 18 bytes
</pre>

<p>
Now, running <tt>fortune</tt> with the full path of the file causes a random
string to be displayed from the above file. (Note that the full path
must be provided, if the file is outside the default fortunes
directory.)
</p>

<pre>
$ fortune $HOME/Signatures/adages
Haste makes waste
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>fortune</tt> program is versatile, and has several options.
Be sure to read its manual page for more details.
</p>

<h3>Tailoring <tt>fortune</tt> output for signatures</h3>

<p>
The <tt>fortune</tt> output is a random string, and often, these
strings are too long for use as good signatures in your
e-mail. To avoid such situations, we make use of the <tt>-s</tt>
option so <tt>fortune</tt> will display only short strings. The default
definition of a short string is up to 160 characters, but you can
override it with the <tt>-n</tt> option. For example:
</p>

<tt>fortune</tt> -n 200 -s &lt;files&gt;

<p>
could be a suitable candidate as a signature file.
</p>

<h3>Configuring Mutt</h3>

<p>
Now, you're ready to use your neat fortunes in Mutt. If you have no
custom signature, and want to uniformly use a random signature from
your newly created signature file, as well as the default
<tt>linuxcookie</tt> file, then add the following to your
<tt>.muttrc</tt>:
</p>

<pre>
set signature="fortune -n 200 -s linux $HOME/Signatures/adages|"
</pre>

<p>
If this is what you wanted, you're done. However, if you want to
customize the signatures based on other parameters such as recipient,
or current folder, read on.
</p>

<h3>Customizing your signature based on different criteria</h3>

<p>
Let me describe my setup here. I use the <tt>procmail</tt> program
to filter my mail, and let's say that I've got the following folders
of interest:
</p>

<!--"personal e-mail arrive" ? Is this a Brit-usage mass noun? Kat -->

<ol>
<li><tt>inbox</tt>: where all my personal e-mail arrives.</li>
<li><tt>linux</tt>-list: which consists of my local Linux user group mail.</li>
<li><tt>work</tt>-mail: where I read all my work mail.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Now, I want to have the following configuration:
</p>

<ul>
<li>When I reply to or compose mail in the work mail folder, I want a fixed signature.</li>
<li>When I send to linux-list, I want a signature from the linux fortunes database.</li>
<li>Finally, in all other situations, I want a signature from my adages list.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are simple steps to achieve this using the hooks in Mutt. Note that
I have interspersed it with some other configurations for
demonstration.
</p>

<pre>
# Set the default options
folder-hook . 'set record=+sent; set from=me@my-personal-email; set signature="fortune $HOME/Signatures/adages|"'

# Set the custom hooks
send-hook linux-list@example.com 'set signature="fortune -n 200 -s linux|"'
folder-hook work-mail 'set record=+sent-work; set from=me@my-work-email; set signature="$HOME/.signature-work"'
</pre>

<p>
What the above snippet does is to set, amongst other things, the
default signature to be my adages set, and automatically switch the
signature to a fixed file, <tt>$HOME/.signature-work</tt>, when I move
to the <tt>work-mail</tt> folder. Finally, if I send mail to the
<tt>linux-list@example.com</tt> mailing address, the signature is
altered to display a fortune from the <tt>linux</tt> fortunes
file. Simple enough, and the possibilities are infinite!
</p>

<h3>Getting good fortunes</h3>

<p>
You can scout the Internet to get nice quotations and
interesting messages to add to your signatures collection; all you need to do is
to put each in the right format, use <tt>strfile</tt> to enable fortune
to use it, and plug it into your Mutt configuration. I often like to
hunt for quotations on <a href="http://www.wikiquote.org">Wikiquote</a>,
amongst other Web sites. While I am sure most of us don't mean any harm
while using other people's sentences in our signatures, ensure that
you stay on the right side of the law while doing so.
</p>

<p>
I wish to make a mention of the <a
href="http://lost.sourceforge.net/">Linux One Stanza Tip</a> project,
which provides a very nice set of signatures with GNU/Linux tips, and
more, in their distribution. They also provide templates for you to
generate your own signatures with designs and customizations. Sadly,
the project doesn't seem to be that active now, but the tips and
software provided are very apt and usable even today.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
In conclusion, I hope I've managed to show you that with Mutt, you
can customize the way you handle signatures in a neat manner. Should
you have comments or suggestions to suggestions to enhance or improve
this workflow, or just want to say that you liked this article, I'd
love to hear from you!
