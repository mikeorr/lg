<h1>What's up with Google Public DNS?</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</a></b></p>

<p>
A few days ago, out of nowhere, Google, Inc. announced that it was
offering a new free-of-charge service to the public: robust recursive
DNS nameservice from highly memorable IP addresses 8.8.8.8 and
8.8.4.4, with extremely fast responses courtesy of anycast IP
redirection to send the query to the closest network cluster for that 
service (like what Akamai and similar CDNs do for Web content).  
</p>

<p>
This service needs some pretty considerable funding for hardware and
bandwidth, especially if its usage scales upwards as Google intends.
Reportedly, it also developed a totally new recursive-only nameserver
package, name not disclosed, in-house. According to my somewhat casual
research, the software was probably written by Google developer Paul S.
R. Chisholm, who doesn't seem to have any prior record of writing such
software.
</p>

<p>
That is remarkable, to begin with, because recursive nameservers are
notoriously difficult to write correctly, such that the history of open
source DNS servers is littered with failed recursive-nameserver
projects.  (By contrast, the other types, authoritative, iterative, and
forwarder, are much easier to write.  Please see my separate article, "<a
href="lan.html">The Village of Lan, A Networking Fairy Tale</a>", about the
differences.)
</p>

<p>
The obvious question is, what's in it for Google? At first, I guessed
it to be a research/prestige project, an opportunity for Chisholm
and other technical staff to try their hand at managing major network
infrastructure.  It also already serves as DNS foundation for some
internal Google services, such as the WiFi network for visitors to the
Google campus, and for the free public WiFi network Google offers to
residents of Mountain View, California, near its headquarters.  
That didn't really seem sufficient to justify the outlay required in
expenses and technical resources, though.
</p>

<p>
My friend Don Marti suggested an alternative idea that sounds more
promising:  It's a "spamtenna", a distributed data-collection system that
classifies DNS clients: those doing high numbers of DNS lookups of
known spam-related hostnames, and regular DNS clients that don't.  Then,
other hostnames resolved more often by the first group than the second
are noted as also probably spam-involved.  Google can use that
database of suspect hostnames in anti-spam service, to aid GMail
antispam, etc., a usage model consistent with Google's privacy policy.
</p>

<p>
Is Public DNS an attractive offering? Does it have privacy problems? Yes and
no.  
</p>

<p>
For most people, probably even most <em>Linux Gazette</em> readers, 
DNS is just something automatically taken care of, which means it tends
to get referred out to the local ISP's recursive nameservers.  I 
shouldn't be unkind to ISPs, who do their best, but ISP recursive
servers tend to be pretty bad.  In general, they have
spotty performance, often play tricks such as redirecting queries or 
ignoring time-to-live timeouts on DNS data, are security liabilities (on
account of pervasive "cache poisoning" by malign parties elsewhere on
the Internet), and of course are an obvious point where data collects
about all of your DNS queries -- what you and your users ask about, and
what is replied.  Of course, your ISP already sees all all your incoming
and outgoing packets -- but, unlike Google, are contractually obliged to
deal with you in good faith and look after your interests.
</p>

<p>
That is one of the problems with Google's Public DNS offering, and,
likewise, with its other free-of-charge services such as GMail (and, for
that matter, with pretty much any unpaid "Web 2.0" service):  Any
contractual commitment to users is either non-existent or extremely weak.
They say they have a strong privacy policy, with information about which of
your IP addresses queried their servers being erased after 24-48 hours, but
the fact is that you're just not a paying customer, so policies don't mean
much, completely aside from the possibility of them being changed on a
whim.
</p>

<p>
Another problem I've already alluded to:  What software does it use, and
is it reliable and correct?  Google is telling the public nothing about
that software, not even its name, except that it was developed in-house
and is not to be open source in the foreseeable future.  Most of the
really good recursive nameserver packages were developed as open source
(in part) to get the benefit of public debugging and patches.  The rest 
took a great deal of time and money to get right.
</p>

<p>
One common comparison is to David Ulevich's OpenDNS free recursive
service, which is competently run and keeps users away from
malware/phishing hostnames.  Unless you use the paid version, however, 
OpenDNS deliberately breaks Internet standards to return the IP of its
advertising Web server whenever the correct answer is "host not found" 
(what is called NXDOMAIN in DNS jargon).  Google Public DNS doesn't
suffer the latter problem.
</p>
 
<p>
A third alternative:  None of the above.  Run your own recursive
nameserver.  For example, NLnet Labs's open-source Unbound is very easy
to set up, requires no maintenance or administration, takes only about
11 MB RAM, and runs on Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X.  It would be silly
to run such a network service on <em>every</em> machine:  Instead, run 
it on one of the machines of your home or office's LAN, and have all of
the machines' DNS client configurations -- /etc/resolv.conf on Linux
machines -- point to it.  That way, there's a single shared cache of
recently queried DNS data shared by everyone in the local network.
</p>

<p>(Note:  Most people have their machines' "resolv.conf" contents, along
with all other network settings, populated via DHCP from a local network
appliance or a similar place, and configure that to point clients' DNS to
the nameserver machine's IP.  For that reason, the nameserver machine
should be one to which you've assigned a static IP address, and left
running 24/7.</p>

<p>Hey, <a href="http://http://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> wireless-router
firmware developers!  Make me happy and put Unbound into OpenWRT, rather
than just Dnsmasq, which is a mere forwarder, and Just Not Good Enough.
Dnsmasq forwarding to Unbound, however, would be really good, and 
putting recursive DNS in the same network appliance that hands out DHCP 
leases is the ideal solution for everyone.  Thanks!)
</p>

<p>
It seems that hardly anyone other than us networking geeks bothers to
have real, local nameservice of that sort -- a remarkable example of
selective blindness, given the much snappier network performance, and
greater security and control, that doing it locally gains you for almost
no effort at all.
</p>

<p>In fact, what's <em>really</em> perplexing is how many people, when I give
them the above suggestion, assume either that I must be exaggerating the
ease of running a recursive nameserver, or that "professional" options 
like their ISP, OpenDNS, or Google Public DNS must actually be faster
than running locally, or both.  Let's consider those:  (1) When I say
there's nothing to administer with recursive nameserver software, I mean
that quite literally.  You install the package, start the service, it
runs its cache by itself, and there are no controls (except to run it or
not). It's about as foolproof as network software can get.  (2) When 
your DNS nameserver is somewhere on the far side of your ISP uplink,
then all DNS queries and answers must traverse the Internet both 
ways, instead of making a local trip at ethernet speeds.  The only
real advantage a "professional" option has is that its cache 
will be already well stocked, hence higher percentage of cache hits 
relative to a local nameserver when the latter first starts, but then
there will be essentially no difference and the local service will
thereafter win because it's local.
</p>

<p>
Why outsource to anyone, when you can do a better job locally, at 
basically no cost in effort?

<h3>Late Addendum:  The Real World Sends Rick a Memo</h3>

<p>
This might be you:  You have one or more workstation or laptop on either a
small LAN or direct broadband (or dialup) connection.  You're (quite
rightly) grateful that all the gear you run gets dynamic IP configuration
via DHCP.  The only equipment you have drawing power on a 24x7 basis is
(maybe) your DSL modem or cable modem and cute little network gateway
and/or Wireless Access Point appliance (something like a Linksys WRT54G).
You don't have any "server" other than that.
</p>

<p>
Mea culpa:  Being one of those oddballs who literally run servers 
at home, I keep forgetting you folks exist; I really have no excuse.
</p>

<p>Shortly after I submitted the first version of this article to
<em>LG</em>, a friend on my local Linux user group mailing list reminded
me of the problem:  He'd followed my advice and installed Ubuntu's Unbound
package on his laptop, but then (astutely) guessed it wasn't being
sent queries, and asked me how to fix that.  His house had the usual
network gateway appliance, which (if typical) runs Dnsmasq on embedded Linux
to manage his Internet service, hand out DHCP leases on a private IP
network, and forward outbound DNS requests to his ISP nameserver.  
</p>

<p>
As I said above, it would be really nice, in such cases, to run a
recursive nameserver (and not just Dnsmasq) on the gateway appliance, 
forwarding queries to it rather than elsewhere.  That's beyond the scope
of my friend's immediate needs, however.  Also, I've only lately, in
playing with OpenWRT on a couple of actual WRT54G v.3 devices received
as gifts, realised how thin most such appliances' hardware is:  My units
have 16 MB total RAM, challenging even for RAM-thrifty Unbound.
</p>

<p>
My friend isn't likely to cobble together a static-IP server machine
just to run a recursive nameserver, so he went for the only alternative:
running such software locally, where the machine's own software can
reach it as IP 127.0.0.1 (localhost).  The obstacle, then, becomes DHCP,
which by design overwrites /etc/resolv.conf (the DNS client
configuration file) by default every time it gets a new IP lease,
including any "nameserver 127.0.0.1" lines.
</p>

<p>
The simple and elegant solution:  Uncomment the line "#prepend
domain-name-servers 127.0.0.1;" that you'll find already present in
/etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf .  Result:  The local nameserver will be
tried first.  If it's unreachable for any reason, other nameserver 
IPs supplied by DHCP will be attempted in order until timeout.  This 
is probably exactly what people want.
</p>

<p>
(If, additionally, you want to make sure that your DHCP client never requests
additional "nameserver [IP]" entries from the DHCP server in the first 
place, just edit the "request" roster in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf to 
remove item "domain-name-servers".)
</p>

<p>
Second alternative:  Install package "resolvconf" (a utility that aims
to mediate various other packages' attempts to rewrite /etc/resolv.conf), 
and add "nameserver 127.0.0.1" to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head so
that this line always appears appears at the top of the file.  This is
pretty nearly the same as the first option.
</p>

<p>
Last, the time-honoured caveman-sysadmin solution:  "chattr +i
/etc/resolv.conf", i.e., setting the file's immutable bit (as the root
user) so that neither your DHCP client nor anything else can alter the
file until you remove that bit.  It's hackish and unsubtle, but worth
remembering for when only Smite with Immense Hammer solutions will
do.

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/cabal/os-suck.html">sucked less</a>, he blew
away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and
support.  He helped plan the LINC Expo (which evolved into the first
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access
to a card-walloping IBM mainframe at Stanford (1969).  A glutton for
punishment, he then moved on (during high school, 1970s) to early HP
timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer
sessions, and so on.  He's thus better qualified than most, to know just
how much better off we are now.

<P> When not playing Silicon Valley dot-com roulette, he enjoys
long-distance bicycling, helping run science fiction conventions, and
concentrating on becoming an uncarved block.
