As always, I <I>really</I> appreciate all of the letters that folks have
taken the time to pen.  With added work at school I've been a bit pressed
for time and so haven't had the time to comment here on each letter.  I 
apologize for this, but am happy just to have the time to get this issue
out! :-)

<P>
Please don't hesitate to drop the author of a letter a note yourself if
there's something you'd like to follow up on.  Also, there is a letter by
<B>Jeff Richards</B> with a question regarding VI, ftp, and the corruption of
the correct backspace definition after these programs have finished executing.
I've experienced this problem myself and honestly haven't an answer for him.
Any takers...? :-)

<P>
Enjoy.

<B>Subject: PGP compile for linux/ELF</B><BR>

<P>
Hey,

<P>
I just came across something that I thought would be nice to submit to the
mailbag. I came looking for hints in the LG when I was having trouble and it
wasn't there.  :)  So I thought I'd drop a line.

<P>
I discovered, much to my sorrow, that pgp refuses to compile on ELF systems.
Happily, I found a little fix for it on the net.  I can't take credit.

<P>
To make it behave and compile as an ELF binary two changes need to be made.
One to 80386.S and one to zmatch.S - these files are found in the /src
directory of the untarred pgp distribution.

<P>
Near the top of each file, there is an #if directive.  They need to be altered
thusly - (I forget which one is in which file but it's obvious when you look at
them):

<PRE>
#ifndef SYSV     gets changed to
#if !defined(SYSV) && !defined(__ELF__)
</PRE>

and

<PRE>
#ifdef SYSV      gets changed to
#if defined(SYSV) || defined (__ELF__)
</PRE>

<P>
Note the double underscores on either side of &quot;ELF&quot;.  This is crucial.

<P>
Change those directives and it'll do a nice clean compile.  Crypto away.

<P>
Tyger

Hey,

<P>
Here's a nifty little shell script I wrote a while ago (I call it scribble):

NOTESFILE=~/notes

[ -z $1 ] && (cat &gt;&gt; $NOTESFILE;exit)
echo $* &gt;&gt; $NOTESFILE;
</PRE>

<P>
All it does is append either it's arguments, or the data on stdin to the
NOTESFILE. I use it for cases like:<BR>
scribble 123-4567 jane<BR>
Or:<BR>
scribble<BR>
made a link from a to b<BR>
changed the global PATH<BR>

<P>
I find it rather useful, hope you do too. BTW, when is the next Linux
Gazette coming out?

<P>
Hi John

<P>
First of all, thanks for a very nice publication. I have downloaded all your
&quot;editions&quot; of
The Linux Gazette, and found many valueable hints and advise.

<P>
Here is one of my own;

<P>
If you want to make sure that you don't &quot;rm *&quot; in the wrong directory,
create a file called &quot;-i&quot;=20
in each directory that you want to protect. When the shell expands the &quot;rm
*&quot;, it will expand to
&quot;rm -i file1 file2&quot; etc, and automatically ask for permission to delete.
This will increase the
chance that you detect your error by a magnitude !

<P>
Keep up the good work !

<B>Subject: Re: Linux Gazette</B><BR>

<P>
Just wanted to send a quick note to say that I like your electronic magazine,
and to also suggest an idea for a future issue.  It concerns a problem that I
can't seem to solve(possibly because I just don't know what I'm doing - at
least as far as Linux is concerned - I have used other Unix variants for 10-15
years).

<P>
While I have the backspace set correctly using stty erase and it functions fine
when I'm typing commands at the console, when I enter vi, it no longer works.
The same is true within ftp.  However, I have found that the control-H key
combination does work - just not the backspace key.

<P>
And even stranger, if I telnet in from another machine the backspace key works
in both vi and ftp - it only fails if I physically sit at the console.

<P>
Any ideas why this phenomenon is happening?  Perhaps others have come across 
this.  I know I'd love the solution to the mystery and perhaps others might
as well.

<P>
Thanks in advance for any info.

<P>
PS: I'm using Slackware 1.2.3 at present, and haven't diddled with the kernel
    or done any other fiddling about.  I've just been evaluating Linux as
    compared to the Unix available on our workstations(HP & Sun).

<B>Subject: Dangerous Commands</B><BR>

<P>
Hi John.
How about a thread in The Linux Gazette aboyt dangerous commands (ie. 
command which realy can mess up your system.)

<P>
I can think of three, right now, but I'm very sure there are many mores.

<P>
rm - well you know about that one

<P>
tar - yes realy, try 'tar cvf * | (cd /backup; tar xf -)'.  I did that 
the other day. What I relay wanted was to move a hiracy of files, to 
/backup, but I forgot a '-' before the start, so what tar realy did was 
to create a tar achive in the first file, which the star expanded to.
Another on cavet is when you type 'tar cf ..' instead of 'tar xf ..', tar 
overwrite without saying a word....

<P>
chmod,chown,chgrp - thing of all the files located around the system. 
Some of the have to be readable for every one, some of the have to belong 
to the group bin, others must be owned by root or deamon etc. etc.
A chown/chmod/chgrp recursive will surely mess up your system that much 
that you have to reinstall your whole system.

<P>
Kind Regards Jesper

<B>Subject: Homemade icons</B><BR>

<P>
Hi,

<P>
Here is a quickie suggestion for your linux gazette.

<P>
    Effortless fvwm icons - no artistic skill required (for 16bpp or 
32bpp displays - not recommended for 8bpp (you'll run out of colours)):

<OL>
	<LI> Take your application window and make it smaller so that the size
of the significant features in the window is relatively large compared
with the size of the window itself. 

	<LI> Use XV to grab a shot of the window. 

	<LI> Use XV to resize the window to 8x or 16x the desired size of your
icon. 

	<LI> Save the image and reload using XV (this step seems to be
necessary to make XV change its representation from one of a small image
that has been enlarged to a large image at its natural resolution - You 
may know how to do this without a save and reload - I don't).

	<LI> Use XV to pixellize the image by a factor of 8 or 16 as above. 

	<LI> Use XV to resize the image to the desired size of your icon.

	<LI> You now have an antialiased miniature image of the full size
window - save it as an XPM file somewhere where it will be safe for all 
time. 

	<LI> Repeat the above as desired for other applications. 

	<LI> Set the pixmap path in your .fvwmrc to the directory containing
your icon image(s). 

	<LI> Associate the icon image with an application in your .fvwmrc file. 

	<LI> Sit back and admire your new-look desktop.
</OL>

<B>Subject: Re: Yet another HACK script</B><BR>

<P>
Just a point to note with hack.  Once you start using it to maintain
a config file, you really should keep using it.  You can make any
changes you want to a file under hack's control as root and force the
save (they're changed to be readonly), but the next time you hack
that file, RCS will replace it with its stored version.

<P>
IE:

<P>
Hack a file so it has lines one, two and three.<BR>
Save it. <BR>
Now edit that file as root and add lines four five and six. <BR>
Save it with :w! to force the save.<BR>
Hack the file again, and note that lines four five and six are gone.<BR>
RCS has replaced the files with the &quot;correct&quot; version as far as
it's concerned from the /configs/RCS/file,v file.

<P>
Just the way RCS works.

<P>
I like your page, but I don't like the implication that
Netscape is the best or only HTML+ capable browser.
I suggest you include parallel references to
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/www/arena/">Arena</A>
which also does justice to your page.

<P>
While you're at it, most browsers (Netscape, Mosaic,
Arena, Chimera) are good at putting the width and height
specifiers in img tags to good use.  e.g., 
&lt;img src=&quot;http://recycle.cebaf.gov/~doolitt/Doolittle.jpg&quot; width=143 height=170&gt;
Your page would come up cleaner (especally with your slow link)
if you put these in.

<B>Subject: Helpful PPP scripts</B><BR>

<P>
16 Feb 1996

<P>
John,

<P>
    I found your &quot;Helpful PPP scripts&quot;, from the August 1995 issue of the
Linux Gazette, VERY helpful.  Thanks for sharing them.

<P>
    Near the bottom of the man page for pppd, it is revealed that the file
/etc/ppp/ip-up is automatically run just after the ppp link is established. 
By putting your &quot;pppon&quot; script commands in this file, you can avoid having
to manually run pppon.

<P>
    Initially, the last portion of my local IP address (as extracted by your
pppon script) was missing.  Apparently, my numerical IP address is longer
than yours.  Changing the <BR><BR>

cut -b 21-32<BR><BR>

from your script to<BR><BR>

cut -b 21-36<BR><BR>

<P>
will properly extract the longest legal numerical IP address.  Note that
positional parameter $4 passed to /etc/ppp/ip-up is the numerical local IP
address.  Thus, if you want, you can get the local IP address value to write
to /etc/hosts from $4, rather than from /sbin/ifconfig ...

<P>
    Although I too am the only person who uses my system, I don't do
everything as root.  In order to alow non-root users to write to the
/etc/hosts file, I changed the <BR><BR>

echo  &quot; ...  &quot; &gt; /etc/hosts<BR><BR>

command in your pppon script to<BR><BR>

su root -c &quot;echo \&quot; ... \&quot; &gt; /etc/hosts&quot;<BR><BR>

<P>
Note that the double quote characters (&quot;) enclosing the text to be sent in
your pppon script are escaped (\&quot;) in my modified version.  Also, note that
double quote characters are used to enclose everything after su root -c in
my modified version.

<P>
Thanks again.

Hi John.  I was just going through the LG and trying out all the cool new

*should be*

All the ' should be ` (backquotes, not appostraphies (sp?)).  This makes

<B>Subject: Setterm and the Linux Gazette</B><BR>

<P>
Howdy!

<P>
Kudos on your great resource for Linux Users!

<P>
In the November issue, you mention setterm.  I have found that the best use for this (IMHO) is to 
determine which user is currently logged in.  I rarely log in as root, and have found that I often
forget that I am root.  What I have done is changed the screen color for root to a nice bright
red screen with red letters whenever I am root.  This way I know who I am (I also know whenever
someone else that I let use my computer hacks in to my superuser :-) ).  I have edited the following 
files:

<P>
/root/.profile<BR><BR>

<PRE>
--&gt;   add the following lines:
	setterm -background red -foreground yellow- bold -store
	clear
	alias logout='setterm -background blue -foreground white -bold -store ; clear'
</PRE>
	
<P>
/root/.bashrc<BR><BR>

<PRE>
--&gt;   add the following lines:
	setterm -background red -foreground yellow -bold -store
	clear
	alias exit='setterm -background blue -foreground white -bold -store ; clear'
</PRE>
	
<P>
This way, whether I login as root, or if I &quot;su&quot; to root, I change the color.  I also recommend changing
the prompt to something obnoxious like &quot;*****ROOT*****:/&gt;&quot;  just to make the point.  

<P>
I guess that you could do this for every different user that you used, such as webmaster, or KoolMoDee...
Whatever.  

<P>
Now, do you have any way to interactively change the background colors in an xterm?  I use X a lot, and
this would be nice.

<P>
Thanks for the help, and once again, good job!

<B>Subject: supermount</B><BR>

<P>
I applied your article on supermount to my RedHat system, and discovered 
a problem. I thought I'd warn you about this.

<P>
it seems that RedHat's 'mount' command is different than the stock linux 
mount. At least, it didn't like the /etc/fstab line for supermount. When 
I put in the line you recoomended, I'd get something like this:
	
<PRE>
[Root] /&gt;mount
/ on /a type supermount (rw,fs=msdos,dev=/dev/fd0)
/dev/hda1 on /dos type msdos (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,umask=0)
/dev/hdb2 on /home type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hdb4 on /usr type ext2 (rw)
/proc on /proc type proc (rw)
</PRE>

<P>
The supermount on /a somehow superceded the &quot;/dev/hdb1 on / type ext2 
(rw)&quot; line that's normally at the top of the output of mount on my 
system. I was unable to unmount / or /a. 

<P>
What's really bad about this is, if you reboot, it is unable to unmount 
your actual root partition, and then when it boots up, it mounts it 
read-only, and things are very bad..

<P>
My fix was to use this line in /etc/fstab:

<PRE>
/a    /a     supermount   rw,fs=msdos,dev=/dev/fd0   0 0

^
|--notice that /a. I think that for supermount, this field is just a 
placeholder, you can fill it with anything. So I picked something 
innocuous. Now it works, and mount reports:

/dev/hdb1 on / type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hda1 on /dos type msdos (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,umask=0)
/dev/hdb2 on /home type ext2 (rw)
/dev/hdb4 on /usr type ext2 (rw)
/proc on /proc type proc (rw)
/a on /a type supermount (rw,fs=msdos,dev=/dev/fd0)

<B>Subject: TIP LG: Copying files &gt; 1.4 Mb to floppy</B><BR>


<P>
Howdy,

<P>
I originally posted this tip to the c.o.l.m newsgroup back in August of 
1995.  I think it is a valuable tip and am forwarding it to you for 
possible inclusion in the next LG.

<P>
How many times have you needed to transport a file larger then 1.44Mb via 
floppies and did not know how?  I have on many occasions.  It finally 
became a desperate situation and I was forced to read the man page for 
Gnu Tar.  I am glad I did!

<P>
The following command will let you tar either a single file or multiple 
files and span them across multiple floppy disks.  This is the command 
that seems to work best for me:

<PRE>
'tar -cvMf /dev/fd0H1440/ files-to-betarred.gz'
</PRE>

<P>
I hope this helps some folks who may have been scratching their heads 
over just this issue.

<P>
-Rod

Is fmt usable in vi as well as vim?

<P>
Also, is fmt available in UNIX, not just Linux?

<P>
One more thing, in your Nov. issue, you talk about using '/' and '?' to 
search out strings.  Not only can you use 'n' to move forward in a '/' 
search, or backwards in a '?' search, but if you use 'shift+n' it will 
reverse whatever mode you are in.  (i.e. If you start in '/' mode, typing 
'shift+n' will go to '?' mode and reverse the search one step.  Watch the 
status on the bottom of the screen, it indicates which is which).

<P>
Hi.

<P>
I liked your article a lot, even though i have been compiling Linux 
codes on my own for over a year. 

<P>
But just in case you get other queries from desperate people:

<P>
As you may be aware, the 0.3 XF-Mail release doesnt work right with
the newer (&gt; 3.4f) Xpm libs. Specifically, a call to the xform
function fl_set_pixmapbutton_data fails with a segmentation fault. 

<P>
I also noticed a problem with dirent.h   ... xfmail calls 
dirent-&gt;d_namlen  but it should be dirent-&gt;d_reclen . there is a 
define fix in the dirent.h, but it didnt work for me and i had to put 
it in by hand to get a compile... 

<P>
I then upgraded to the alpha release of the newest xforms library, 
but some of the calls have changed their arguments. I fixed them up, 
and the xfmail program then ran, but things weren't quite right (menu 
bar was at bottom, message bar at top!)

<P>
Then i noticed that there was an alpha release of the newest version
of xfmail, and that compiles with my eyes closed and the latest Xpm
and xform libraries...

<P>
Cheers

<B>Subject: xterm escapes - one more time</B><BR>

<P>
I saw a few examples of getting bash to put the current directory into
the titlebar, but they all either replace &quot;cd&quot; or change the prompt. Here's a
method that takes advantage of PROMPT_COMMAND:

<P>
use Escape for ^[ and Ctrl-G for ^G when adding this to your .bash_profile.

<PRE>
if [ &quot;$?PROMPT&quot; ]; then
    if [ &quot;$TERM&quot; = &quot;xterm&quot; ]; then
       echo -n &quot;^[]2;xterm: `pwd`^G&quot;
       export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -n &quot;^[]2;xterm: `pwd`^G&quot;'
    fi
fi
</PRE>

<P>
It works because PROMPT_COMMAND gets executed each time the current directory
is changed. The only downside is having to do the &quot;echo&quot; up front; this is
required because PROMPT_COMMAND doesn't get executed when the shell first
fires up.

<P>
One correction: In my email, I stated that PROMPT_COMMAND gets called 
by bash whenever the current directory is changed. There *IS* a facility 
like that in tcsh (I forget the name of the environment variable), but 
PROMPT_COMMAND is slightly different: it gets run each time bash is about 
to issue a prompt. Thus, you can do things like:

<PRE>
export PROMPT_COMMAND=&quot;touch $HOME/.last.prompt&quot;
</PRE>

<P>
and ~/.last.prompt will be time-stamped with the approximate time that 
the last command finished...

<P>
I really enjoy LG, by the way. Would you be interested in an in-depth 
discussion of how to set up xdm? I can't promise it for your next issue, 
but I really should write something about the setup that I use; it's 
become quite popular with the programmers in my project team.

<P>
Hi John,

<P>
Thanks for your time and your wonderful gazette, here it is my contribution
to the million tons of mails that you may have about this subject.

<P>
Changing the xterm titlebar using aliases can led you to a wrong one If you do 
a lot of telnet or rlogin to anothe system that changes your titlebar too.

<P>
But you can solve it in BASH with the 

<PRE>PROMPT_COMMAND</PRE>

<P>
variable that runs the command in it every time it has to write a new
prompt(I have also try to use a prompt that changes my titlebar but I
find it terrible slowing editing long lines.)

<P>
I put this in my bashrc.

<PRE>
 PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne &quot;\033]2;bhole:$PWD$\007&quot;'
</PRE>

<P>
Hope that you find it useful and understable(english isn't my first language).

<P>
Have you see the wonderful tkman (a X manual pager really cute, written it 
Tcl/Tk). I also invite to see the Bowman Window Manger (it trys to convert 
your linux box in a NeXt one)

<P>
Thanks again for your magazine,

<P>
Hi John, 

<P>
First of all, I'd like to tell ya how much I enjoy the LG.  The tips are cool,
and don't change your style of writing!  Anyway,  I was digging through some
papers today and found the November issue of the LG, and started glancing
through it again.  I noticed in the section  about the xterm title bar where
you talked about setting the current working directory as the title that you
could not get it to work with BASH. Here is a section of my  ~/.profile that
does it:

<PRE>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Start ~/.profile - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

# This function sets the xterm title to be the argument of xtitle
#  It is used below so that 'cd' will write the current directory
#  to the xterm title (see November Linux Gazette for explanation of
#  the escape sequences, and how to insert them)
xtitle()
{
    if [ &quot;$*&quot; != &quot;&quot; ]; then
       echo -n &quot;]0;$* &quot;
    else
       echo -n &quot;]0;xterminal:`/usr/bin/tty`&quot;
    fi
}

# Only write to xterm if X is running
if [ &quot;$DISPLAY&quot; ]; then

   # Assign the titles of any xterms started in ~/.xinitrc
   xtitle $PWD
   
   temp_cd()
   {
       cd $1
       # Set the xterm title
       xtitle $PWD
       # Echo to screen, if you like
       echo $PWD
   }
else 
   temp_cd()
   {
       cd $1
       # Cannot write to xterm, just echo to screen
       echo $PWD
   }
fi
alias cd='temp_cd'    
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - End ~/.profile - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
</PRE>

<P>
I also wanted to tell you about a cool login-notifier  I added to 
/etc/profile after I saw that I had some attempted logins as root while
I had my ppp connection up.  It broadcasts a message to me whenever anyone
other than myself logs in.  

<PRE>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Start /etc/profile - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

# Detect logins
UserId=`id -un`
case ${UserId}
in
  # Don't broadcast when the following user(s) log in:
  mallozzi );;
  # Broadcast for everyone else, especially root
  *) echo &quot;User ${UserId} logged in at `date +%I:%M`&quot; | wall;;
esac
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - End /etc/profile - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
</PRE>


<P>
I also had to put the following in my ~/.profile, to allow the broadcast
messages to be displayed:

<PRE>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - snip, snip - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

# Enable write permission to terminal for the automatic login
#  detection procedure (see /etc/profile)
if [ ! &quot;$DISPLAY&quot; ]; then
   CurrentTerminal=`tty`
   chmod 622 $CurrentTerminal
fi
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

See Ya!

<B>Subject: XTerm title tricks (cont.)</B><BR>
Cc: &lt;fiskjm@ctrvax.Vanderbilt.Edu&gt;<BR>

<P>
I recently saw your email message in Linux Gazette Issue #6 in which
you present some lines to insert into your .cshrc and .login to get the
hostname and current path on the xterm title bar. At the end of the
message you mention that you've yet to figure out how to reset the
hostname and current path after returning from a rlogin or telnet
session (your solution was to run a &quot;renew&quot; command). I have a
solution which works very well for me.

<P>
I'm using tcsh, and I've setup up the following aliases in my .tcshrc:

<PRE>
alias rlogin &quot;(\rlogin \!^; cd .)&quot;
alias telnet &quot;(\telnet \!^; cd .)&quot;
</PRE>

<P>
Whenever I return from a rlogin or telnet session, the &quot;cd .&quot; command is
run which updates the title bar (because of your previous alias).

<P>
I don't know if !^ can be used with aliases in other shells, but
hopefully this helps you out.

<P>
BTW the tcsh man page gives an example very similar to your cd alias.

<PRE>
alias cwdcmd 'echo -n &quot;^[]2;${HOST}:$cwd^G^[]1;${HOST}^G&quot;'
</PRE>

<P>
in tcsh, whatever &quot;cwdcmd&quot; is, gets run after every cd command
automatically.

<B>Subject: Xterm title bar</B><BR>

<P>
Hi!

<P>
Can I still give my way to put info dynamically in Xterm's titlebar?

<P>
I use bash and here goes the relevant portion of my ~/.bashrc file:

<PRE>
#---
if [ -z &quot;$HOST&quot; ]; then
    export HOST=`hostname`
fi

# The string between quotes is used to put the CWD
# in the Xterm title bar. -- ECL
if [ &quot;$TERM&quot; = &quot;xterm&quot; ]; then
    PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -en &quot;\033]2;${LOGNAME}@${HOST}:${PWD}\007&quot;'
fi
#---
</PRE>

<P>
Bash executes &quot;PROMPT_COMMAND&quot; every time it is about to print the
prompt (PS1).

<P>
The variables LOGNAME and PWD are automatically set by Bash. This does
not happen with HOST, which we must set using the &quot;hostname&quot; command.

<P>
The &quot;033&quot; is the octal form of decimal 27 = ESC.

<P>
I prefer this way because I don't have to alias &quot;cd&quot;. Note that the
power that the variable PROMPT_COMMAND gives you goes beyond a
&quot;simple&quot; title in a Xterm window. You can make it speak something like
&quot;Yes sir!&quot; at each prompt... ;-)

<P>
Have FUN!

<P>
Emilio.

I've been wanting to know how to do this for some time now!  Thanks for making
it available.  I'm just sorry that I missed it the first time around...

<P>
Here is a minor suggestion that I didn't see mentioned in any other updates
in the January issue.

<P>
After some fiddling I came up with the following string for PS1:

<PRE>
	PS1=&quot;\[\033]2;\h:\w\007\]\$ &quot;
</PRE>

<P>
The &quot;\[&quot;
at the beginning and the &quot;\]&quot; near the end bracket the non-printing
characters.  This is important when the editing long command lines.  This
is documented in the man page for bash.
