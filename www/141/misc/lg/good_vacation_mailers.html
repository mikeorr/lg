<p>
Hello, TAG!
</p>

<p>
Every once in a while I am looking for a good vacation mailer that can
read emails as good as I can while I am as far away from my mailbox as
possible. I already tried
</p>

<pre>
 - vacation from Sendmail,
 - the Sieve vacation mailer that can be enabled in Cyrus and
 - a Perl script I wrote which is buried under the rubble of the company
   I worked for many years ago.
</pre>
What are your favourite vacation mailers that cause the least trouble
with auto-generated emails? Do you have any preferences or experiences?
</p>

<p>
Best wishes,
Ren&eacute;.
</p>

They're so annoying, it's untrue.  I hate these things, and they should be
banished from the face of the Earth.  Not to mention a lot of the brain-dead
ones repeatedly send the same stupid note of:  "I'm not in the office" over
and over again, because the user who buggered off is signed up to some
mailing list, or rather.

Classic means stable, mostly. Which is good in this case, and vacation
works very well.

That's the reason why I usually never use one. However building a
sensible autoresponder that avoids loops and doesn't talk on decently
formatted mailing lists shouldn't be too hard to implement (I know that
this is the perfect phrase to invite trouble). It's just that a lot of
people are used to having autoresponders because their neighbour has one
and so they need one too. Sysadmins know this vicious circle, that's why
I asked for experience with these beasts.

My primary issue with autoresponders is when conversations ensue anyway.
The first notice was fine and can be helpful (I admit, I have found out
people close to me were leaving via autoresponses, even though they told
me 5min ago), but once we both reply and I receive a
second-third-fourth-etc. notice I become annoyed, especially since they
are <em>replying</em> to me _while on vacation_. Suggestion: pick a better
place to vacation.
</p>

<p>
As for loops and mailing list spam, most of that can be filtered out at
either the server or recipient-client level. Most mailing lists use sane
code that filters such vacation announcements anyway (pre-flame
disclaimer: from my experience).

I know what you are talking about and that's the exact situation I want
to avoid. One reply per sender per vacation is more than sufficient and
since I won't touch my mailbox while being away replying while the
auto-responder is active won't occur. I can't speak for the people who
regularly request auto-responders though.

<p>
I am not worried about proper and sane mailing list servers. I get a lot
of mailings from vendors with product announcements and other things.
Most of them use software that produces strange emails and I am not sure
if they can handle standards.
</p>

<p>
I am testing the vacation program with another account and told it to
generate mails with the envelope sender "&lt;&gt;". So far I didn't run into
any problems. I guess I have go give it a try with my standard account.

Hmm.... quite a while back I used procmail which took care of NOT to
reply to list-mails and vacation which took care of the once-only
vacation message. procmail has a filter rule (or at least there were
templates out there) to filter for any hint of being a list-mail.

I'm glad you mentioned that, Karl-Heinz; it reminded me of what, where,
and how. The recipe is listed and explained in 'man procmailex'; it
keeps a database of the 'already pinged' addresses in "vacation.cache",
and does (theoretically) what you want. Note: I have not tested this
myself.

Sounds nice. I guess I'll give it a try or use the vacation program. I
guess proper testing has to be done with the kind of mails some of my
users or I get. Maybe you'll notice my tests too. ;)
</p>

<p>
The only thing I don't like about this way of auto-responder is that
fact that you have to tie it to user accounts. I still stick to Sieve
when it comes to Cyrus (and soon Dovecot). Plugging an auto-responder
into Postfix as plugin doesn't sound promising as some friend suggested.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Ren&eacute;.
