Dear The Answer Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Hi, I just did a search on the Internet for a problem I was having, and
I was led to a site with an answer by "The Answerman" on it, and I
immediately thought he was great!  Short, straightforward answers; to the
point, simple, and very helpful!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, naturally, right away, I decided to come to him with my own
questions, and that's when I discovered that his E-mail may no longer exist.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So now I am coming to you, The Answer Gang, who were mentioned as a
soon-to-be organized group of people, at the time of the article I was at.
(Linux Gazette Issue 55)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, if you would please, I have some questions for you.  I looked in
The Answer Gang Knowledge Base, but it didn't really give me the simple,
short and succinct answers I was looking for.  There was some help in there,
but it was accompanied by a LOT of extra stuff.  I'm writing in the hopes
that you can deliver as well as The Answerman did.
</STRONG></P>

Since it turns out that I have 12 questions total, and they are all
multi-part, AND because these questions are a serious impediment to my Linux
use, I have named them "The Linux Deadly Dozen".  My questions, because I
can't seem to find too many straight answers online, are:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
1. I'm a home user who uses the Internet a lot, plays games, works with
music, and other average activities, and I have above-average computer
literacy - Which Linux distribution is the best choice for me?  What are the
major differences between Mandrake, <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> and Best Linux?  Are they the
three best distributions out there?
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Breen] 
I'm not familiar with Best. I use Red Hat; others here prefer <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>
(which is probably NOT the best distribution for a new user). Mandrake
has a reputation for being easier on the new user. S.U.s.E is also very
well regarded. Other members of the Gang may have other favorites. The
best distro is the one that works for you. (I know, you wanted a simple
answer. There isn't one to this question.)

2. Does Mandrake, Red Hat, or Best Linux support USB ports?  Is support
built in, or do I have to download a patch or something?  If the ports
themselves work fine with Linux, then is it simply a matter of getting Linux
drivers for specific USB devices?

recent distribution.

Both 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernels will have USB support.  There will be lots
of modules, but usbmgr should deal with all that under the hood stuff

linmodems.org is all for analog modems.  A cable "modem" isn't really a modem.
External ones that connect to the computer via an ordinary Ethernet card have
a better chance of being Linux compatible than internal or USB ones.  It all
depends on whether the modem requires a proprietary driver, and whether such
a driver exists for Linux.

<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

You should search Google for hardware compatibility information. (I'd
advise getting a real modem if you're even halfway serious about Linux.
Or even halfway serious about The Other System for that matter.)

Let's see - I just finished a rousing round of Quake2, and was running
Heretic yesterday - and I'm not a big-time game maven. Admittedly, there
are not nearly as many games for Linux as there are for Wind*ws (although
that's changing fairly quickly), but dismissing it with "games are a
problem" is rather simplistic. Take a look at the "Linux games" section at
Tucows; I think you'll be amazed at what's available. Trust me, I'm <em>not_</em>
talking about yet another version of Tetris here. As well, take a look at
some of the stuff currently in development at <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A>/SourceForge; people
are coming up with distributed game systems that will make Wind*ws stuff
look totally <EM>passe</EM> within a year or so.

6. What are the most common Linux file types, and what are their Windows
counterparts?  I notice Linux doesn't use .exe files?  When I click on
certain files in Linux, it asks what I want to use to open them, but I have
no idea what to choose.  Also, what are, and how do I use, RPM packages?

linux does not have file types like in the windows world. Files are
ssociated with mime-types although there some conventions
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>.sh shell scripts
<br>.pl perl scripts
</font></code></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben] 
That's incorrect. Wind*ws does not have file types - its associations are
based on the extension that a file has (which can lead to some rather funny
situations.) Files under Linux are not associated with mime-types - that's
a purely optional mechanism that is often used by mail clients and browsers
(and a few other odd things) - but the only way a file is going to <em> _have</em> a
mime-type is if one has been <em> _assigned</em> to it by a mail client, etc. Under
Unix in general, files are recognized by their "magic", usually the first
few bytes with which a file begins.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
These extensions are conventions "more honored in the breach than the
observance". I usually tell my students that unless they're writing Perl
on a Wind*ws platform, they should <EM>not</EM> use the ".pl" extensions - and
if they are, to use ".plx", since ".pl" is the correct extension for a
Perl _library._ Under Linux, it doesn't matter whether you use the
extension or not.

<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

	> [Iron] 
... unless the program itself requires them.  For instance, top-level Python
scripts that you run from the shell or by clicking an icon may have the .py or
not--it doesn't matter.  But if it's a Python module you want to import from
inside another Python program, it better have the .py extension or it won't
work.

Ben, surely file "extensions" are depreciated
nowadays, since what is the purpose of the she-bang
line??? -- of course as mike said, <EM>some</EM> languages do
need the extension.

You're confusing filetype checking within the OS and <EM>filename usage</EM> in a
programming context. The OS, as per my earlier statement, does not care
about what extension you give the file - period. The fact that you can't,
for example, rename "<TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT>" to "my_favorite_DNS_servers.really"
and have it work has nothing to do with this.

Python compiles and saves modules at import time, and wants to
see the compiled module stored beside the source code, as file.py
and file.pyc.

Not having to wildcard the name or do a search possibly
shortens the "shall I compile this now" decision.

I can't see how that bears on the issue at all. Libraries and modules in
Perl are also required to have extensions that identify them <EM>within Perl</EM>,
but this has nothing to do with file identification within the OS itself.

<blockquote><pre>Baldur:/tmp$ cp /usr/lib/python2.1/uu.py .

As far as identifying the file goes, the extension makes no difference.

This <em> _still</em> does not use extensions. Actually, given the limited action of
the way it works, I suspect it just sets the colors based on the data in
the inode.

What, in 50 words or less? Rivers of ink have been spilled over
licensing issues. I'm not going to even attempt to summarize. (Besides,
this is yet another way to start a flame war and I didn't wear my
asbestos undies today.)

10. What's the deal with compiling libraries?  What does it mean to do that,
why is it necessary, and how is it done?  What is a compiler, and which one
is the best?

Don't worry about this. You probably won't need to compile anything at
all for at least six months after you move into your Linux system.

When you are starting it is NOT neccesary, but has dvatages when you get
into it. Most programs are available as rpm's

X is the underpinning of the graphical interface you're going to want to
use. Your distribution will install it; you probably won't need to worry
about it for, oh, six months.

For all practical purposes a built in. gnome/kde run on top of X which
runs on top of Linux

12. What is the best web browser to use on Linux?  Do KDE and/or Gnome have
built-in web browsers?  If so, are they good enough for most general purpose
Internet use, and eliminate the need to download anything else?

Boy, you're just trying to start a fight, aren't you? This is yet
another question without an answer. KDE and/or Gnome will install a
browser for you. Try one. Try several. Decide which one is best for you.
(I use and like one called Galeon. Another member of the Answer Gang
foams at the mouth when it's mentioned.)

Hi!

Lots of questions there, and a tremendous amount of answers in the
net. Therefore I give you some pointers where to start
reading. Because this is in my opinion the main difference between win
and linux: you have to actually read stuff! Lots of stuff. But as a
consequence - you learn something

(had this with a friend of mine and me (both quite good in
linux-matters) when he bought a mac with OSX: we simply pushed buttons
- without reading the manual - because you're supposed to do this if
you have a gui, aren't you?)

So, the list:

<li> taking a look at <A HREF="http://slashdot.org"
	>http://slashdot.org</A> 15 to 20 times a day
<br>

isn't that bad either
<br>

<li> Since I use debian I can only point you to their list, maybe the
<br>

others can provide something for the other distros:
<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/testing/allpackages.html"
	>http://packages.debian.org/testing/allpackages.html</A> - available
programs with a short description

I think that's one point that everybody, including me, forgot to make - and
it's possibly the most important one there is. Linux is <EM>not</EM> free. Oh, it
doesn't have to cost anything money-wise - you can download the complete
install, or borrow a CD from a friend (unlike dealing with Wind*ws, this is
actually <em> _encouraged</em> ) - but where it does cost is in the time invested in
learning it. Some people, however, see that as a very good thing indeed
(and I'm among them): not only do you get to have this nifty OS, but you
also get to understand it, woohoo! The thing is, you don't get to just lean
back and click on icons (unless you want just the basic functionality). As
soon as you want to get hold of some of the serious power that's available
with Linux, you've got to open the hood, reach under, grrrab those
high-voltage wires, and <EM>feel</EM> the power of Linux!... Oh, sorry - got a
little carried away there.

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Anyway, that's the big difference. When you want more out of Wind*ws,
well... you can pay lots of money and get, uh, something real pretty and
with lots of flash and neat sound-effects and stuff (functionality will be
included in the next release - no, REALLY!) With Linux, there's (usually)
no money involved and the power is available right now - but you <EM>do</EM> need
to sit down and <EM>study</EM>. If that trade-off sounds good to you... welcome to
Linux. You're in for a fun time.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Oh, and do be careful - those numbers on the speedometer are <EM>exponential</EM>
values.
