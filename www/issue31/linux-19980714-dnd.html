<H3> Door Prizes </H3>

Due to the problems with registering, the door prizes were handed out on the
basis of birthdays instead of tickets.  They included quite a number of copies
of Red Hat, not only for Intel but also for Alpha and SPARC, some red hats,
possibly some t-shirts and at least one boxed, stainless steel mug with an
Intel logo on it.  In addition, there were free VA Research t-shirts and
copies of the July 1998 issue of <I>Linux Journal</I> for (almost) everyone,
and Intel was busy handing out Bunny People key chains in the demo area.

<H3> Demos </H3>

<A HREF="http://www.varesearch.com/">VA Research</A> had a number of
lust-inducing machines on display, all running
Linux and a host of interesting window managers and applications (including
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/quake2/official/unix/">Quake II</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.povray.org/">Persistance of Vision ray-tracer</A>
(POV-Ray), <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/">the GIMP</A>, a <A HREF=
"ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/v2.1/">Linux kernel</A> compile,
<A HREF="http://lore.ece.utexas.edu/~bgrayson/xosview.html">SMP-aware
xosview</A>, some image viewers, possibly Rasterman's <A HREF=
"http://www.enlightenment.org/">Enlightenment GUI</A>, etc.).  All of the
machines were running 400&nbsp;MHz Pentium IIs; the Xeons each had 1&nbsp;MB
of onboard L2 cache (per chip, that is) running at full (400&nbsp;MHz) system
speed.
