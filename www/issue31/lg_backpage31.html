My grandaughter, Rebecca is visiting me this week. We've been having a good
time going to all the fun places around Seattle and have a lot more to
visit. Her sister Sarah will be arriving on Friday to visit a week with me
too. I feel very fortunate to have 2 such wonderful granddaughters. Rebecca
loves to dance and is taking ballet, jazz and tap. Sarah is a Tae Kwon Do
student. Pictures of both can be found on my home page.
<P> 
Have fun!
