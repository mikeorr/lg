<p>
Dear readers:
</p>

<p>
I'm going to get straight to the point - the Linux Gazette needs your help.
No, I'm not going to ask you for money; what we really, really need are
<span class="emph">volunteers</span>. People who are willing to commit a
few hours of their time and effort every month to doing some of the work
that's necessary to get LG out. Without that help, I see the Linux Gazette
slowly grinding to a halt in the not-too-distant future - and that's a
future I'd prefer to avoid.
</p>

<p>
I'll be honest with you: I love LG, and would like to see it continue, even
after I've moved on to something else (as hard as I find that to imagine.)
I see it as a terrific resource for Linuxers, both new and experienced - a
place where people can ask questions about Linux and explore the answers
along with <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html">The
Answer Gang</a>; a place for articles, humor, and challenges; a way to make
Linux "Just A Little More Fun"; most importantly, a way for our
<em>community</em> to <em>communicate</em>.  Behind the scenes, though,
there's a lot of hard work going on - and just a few people carrying the
load. If one of us has a problem, or is tied up by large amounts of Life
Happening in a given month, then... there's no one left to carry the ball.
That, my friends, is a serious problem - or so says the engineering part of
my brain. It's a system with lots of vulnerabilities and no backup.
</p>

<p>
What I'm trying to do is create a system in which there's not only a
significant amount of safety but also less strain - a system in which we,
the staff of LG, get to participate in the fun as well as create it.
Producing LG, making it come alive can be really enjoyable... but not if
it's a chore. More hands would make it light work - and add to the general
level of fun.
</p>


<h3>What We Need</h3>

<p>
At the simplest, most basic level, we need people who are
<strong>communicative</strong> and <strong>punctual</strong>. Punctual,
because LG has fixed deadlines; communicative, because the rest of the team
relies on you to either <em>deliver</em> or <em>notify</em>. That is,
you're expected to either 1) do what you've committed to do, or 2) tell us,
<strong>as early as possible</strong>, that you've run into a problem.
Either one is fine - but making an explicit commitment and <em>not</em>
doing either of the above is a disaster in the making. (These skills would
make you a valuable employee or business partner anyway - so get'em while
they're hot.)
</p>

<p>
Going beyond that - there is a process to publishing LG; consequently,
there is a need for people who can carry that process forward. I'll try to
detail that process here, but do note that it's constantly evolving
(comments on improving the process itself are also welcome, particularly if
they come with an offer of help attached.)
</p>

<ul>
<li> At the beginning of each month, just after an issue has been
published, we need <span class="emph">reviewers</span>. Our
proofreaders and our tech editors are going to miss some things; in theory,
when I audit the articles before (and after) publication, I'll catch some
of those errors... but I've learned that I'm not perfect (who would have
thought???), and need some backup.<br>

<pre>
"Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."
 -- Linus Torvalds
</pre>

<strong>Time commitment:</strong> ~2 hours per month.<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> Review all the published material carefully
as soon as possible after publication; notify the Editor of any layout,
technical, spelling, etc. errors.<br>
<br>
<li> As articles come in, I inspect them for their applicability to LG,
their readability, and a number of other characteristics; once I've decided
that they're acceptable, I upload them to our Subversion repository and
mark them as 'RELEASED' in the issue's "STATUS" file. At that point, they
become available to our <span class="emph">technical editors</span>, who
then vet the material for technical accuracy and ensure that any included
code actually works/compiles/runs.<br>
<strong>Time commitment:</strong> Variable, but averaging ~1 hour per article<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> Requires technical knowledge on a variety of
Linux topics, or at least the ability to research the answers. This is a
position where we need a number of people with a range of qualifications:
if you're knowledgeable about <em>any</em> area of Linux, we'd be glad to
have your help.<br>
<br>
<li> After the technical editors approve an article, we need <span
class="emph">proofreaders</span> to check over the spelling and the grammar.
Presumably, the tech editors will scrub out some of those while they work, but
the proofreaders are responsible for the final polish and gloss.<br>
<strong>Time commitment:</strong> Variable, but averaging ~1 hour per article.<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> Requires a solid knowledge of English grammar
and idiom, as well as an ability to use a spellchecker (and to correct it
when it's wrong!)<br>
<br>
<li> There are several regular columns in LG; all of these require at least
two people apiece, a cooperative effort to produce that content on a
regular basis. <span class="emph">Feature editors</span> collect and
arrange the material - whether it's the incoming TAG mail for The Mailbag,
reader comments for Talkbacks, silly/fun chatter for The Laundrette, or the
latest Linux news for NewsBytes - and submit it for inclusion in LG.<br>
<strong>Time commitment:</strong> At least several hours per month.<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> The duties of a feature editor can be fairly
complex, depending on the task. Since there's already at least one editor
for a given feature, what we really need is <em>assistant</em> editors who
will "learn the ropes" and perhaps take turns at the job.<br>
<br>
<li> As time goes on, resources change and disappear - that's part of the
nature of the Web. Some of our regular columns from the past - e.g., Shane
Collinge's "HelpDex" cartoons - have slowly petered out; some, like Thomas
Adam's "The Weekend Mechanic" (which he reintroduced following John M.
Fisk's original column) just went away due to the author's lack of
available time. In any case, LG needs a hip and knowledgeable <span
class="emph">talent scout</span> - someone who will hunt up new and
relevant content, coordinate with the Editor-in-Chief, and (if it passes
muster) contact the author(s) to determine if they'd like to have their
work appear here.<br>
<strong>Time commitment:</strong> If you spend much time browsing the Web,
there's no additional time commitment necessary.<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> Keeping your eyes open for suitable content
doesn't take much time, but requires good judgement and solid coordination
with the Editor-in-Chief.<br>
<br>
<li> If you can't decide - if you're not sure what you're qualified to do -
volunteer anyway. We need <span class="emph">general assistants</span>, and
will be happy to discuss your abilities and how/where you can best use them
at LG.<br>
<strong>Time commitment:</strong> Up to you.<br>
<strong>Description:</strong> Depends on your skills and our needs.<br>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, we're always looking for <a
href="../faq/author.html">authors</a> and <a
href="../mirrors.html#translations">translators</a>.
</p>

<p>
Friends... help me - help <strong><em>us</em></strong> - keep LG running. It's a
good way to "pay forward" for the value that you get from reading the
Gazette, for the value and power you gain from being a part of the Linux
community. Join us today by emailing me at <a

<p>
Sincerely,<br>

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
