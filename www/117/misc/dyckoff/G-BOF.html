Sometimes you go to a good BOF....  Sometimes its a really good BOF.  In this case, the Geronimo BOF had a surprize announcement early on.
While Aaron Mulder gave a short status talk on the project, highlighting that they were almost ready to pass the J2EE TCK,  he was interupted by team member David Jencks who carried an open laptop. <P>
</P>
&quot;Its all green!,&quot; Jencks shouted as he walked up to a smiling Mulder.
Jencks carried his laptop around showing the result of the test suite &ndash; all green bars.   He said that represented 23,000 test cases and it had been running for a very long time.<P>
</P>
Mulder, with rising confidence, announced that NOW Geronimo is J2EE
complient and got a crash of applause.   He and his team gave thanks to the many OSSw projects that had Software incorporated into Geronimo, including
Jetty, OpenEJB, Howl, etc.  Although the test was passed, the developers explained that there were additional usability issues to clear up before the J2EE certification would be official [but this was completed shortly after JavaOne 2005]. <P>
</P>
Since many of the developers at Geronimo are IBM employees, there was a BOF question asking to position Geronimo verses WebSphere.   Mulder joked  &quot;Well, we just wanted to release a shoddy product that no one will want....&quot;  [And later there were snarky remarks from an IBM JVM engineer regarding Sun's JVM, showing the true state the IBM-Sun partnership.  But then this was a late BOF and many of these guys had been working all day on the certification. ]<P>
</P>
BOF attendees were also warned not to download the so-called milestone release -- its outdated.  Instead, they encouraged everyone to download the &quot;unstable release&quot; which is actually more complete and more stable.   [See, everything we knew is wrong....]
