Subject: Talkback:141/brownss.html
</pre>
In my article in LG 141, "An NSLU2 (Slug) Reminder
Server", I suggested running a script to check for
soundcard failure and repeatedly beeping the speaker
to draw attention to the problem when this happens.
</p>

<p>
However, since upgrading from Debian Etch to Debian Lenny
(LG 161 Upgrading Your Slug), I have found this script to
be most unreliable: the NSLU2 can crash completely in the
middle of a beep, leaving the speaker sounding
permanently and the NSLU2 unusable until you cut the
power.  The probability of this crash seems to be well
above an acceptable level, and the watchdog somehow fails
to reboot the NSLU2 when it happens.
</p>

<p>
I have not been able to get any clue about why this
failure now occurs in the new kernel + OS, except to say
that it seems more likely to occur when the operating
system is under load.  A "workaround" is to increase the
length of time between the beeps (say, beep every 10
seconds instead of every second), but this merely reduces
the probability of the crash; it does not eliminate it.
</p>

<p>
Does anyone have any insight into this?
</p>

<p>
Thanks.      Silas

Subject: How to get a random file name from a directory - thank you for the tip!
To: thomas.adam22@gmail.com
</pre>

<p>
Hello Thomas,
I youst wanted to thank you for the shell script you provided in the
Linuxgazette on how
to pick a random file from a directory. Yesterday I was searcing the
Internet for a simple
way to do this, and then I came across your method in a post there.
</p>

<p>
The script you provided is now in use on a computer that plays wav
audio files from the
hard disk, and the sound card is connected to the stereo, in effect
the computer works
as a conventional CD-changer.
</p>

<p>
Here you can see how your method is implemented in the script aplay.sh
- it is started
like this from the command line:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
$ aplay.sh MusicDirectory
 
aplay.sh:
------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/sh
while sleep 1; do
myfiles=($1/*.wav)
num=${#myfiles[@]}
aplay -D hw:0,0 "${myfiles[RANDOM %num]}"
done
------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>
The aplay.sh script plays music in an endless loop, by pressing Ctrl-C once, it
jumps to the next song. By pressing Ctrl-C twice in quick succession,
the script exits.
I dont know if you know this, but the aplay program that is used
inside aplay.sh is
a program that comes with the new Linux sound system ALSA, so it
should be available
on most of the newer Linux distributions.
Again, thank you wery much for the code, and have a nice day.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,
</p>

<p>
Sigurd Solås, Norway.

<p>
Hello...
</p>

<p>
I have a number of files in a Unix directory that need certain words
replaced.
</p>

<p>
For instance, for ever file inside /TEST I need the word 'whs' replaced
with 'whs2'.
</p>

<p>
I have search and searched the sed command and kornshell scripting...no
luck
</p>


<pre>
Sed 's/whs/whs2/g /TEST*.* &gt; outfile
</pre>
The above came close but places the contents of all files into one.
</p>

<p>
Any advice?
</p>

Subject: Ubuntu Server Setup
</pre>
In August 2007 ....an age ago, you published an article "Serving Your Home
Network on a Silver Platter with Ubuntu". Quite good really, idiot proof,
more or less. I used the article in the main to set up my first home
server. It has stayed up, only crashes when I do something stupid which is
only once or twice a year.
</p>

<p>
I was thinking that it is perhaps time to go back to the table and set up the
server again, running 7.10 does sound a bit dated given the noise that
Canonical have been making about how 9.04 is a good option for servers.
</p>

<p>
Just wondering if you have any plans to update and expand the article?
There really is not much to be found through google. Well actually there is
heaps of it but since it is all written in the words of the mega tech it is of
zero value to people like me. There seem to be a lot of people like me who
run home networks (or really want to) and need some hand holding.
</p>

<p>
The guide was good to start but it left a lot missing ... things like why you
should partition properly to separate out the /home partition; how to tweak
squid so that it really works well; how to implement dyndns; how to run a
backup / image of the server; how to VPN / VNC..... , how to set up a common
apt update server, useful things like that ......
</p>

<p>
I know that home servers are not so important in say the States where the
Internet always works and works well. I live in the North West of Thailand.
For entertainment we go and watch the rice grow. Trust me, that really is
fun.  The Internet performance sucks badly on a good day and so developing
your own independence is fundamental or at least managing your Internet use.
Squid helps, having your own SMTP is good (since the local ISP is owned by the
government and often has problems).... as you will note there are many topics
that could be covered.
</p>

<p>
Many writers can only see technology from the perspective of the West. Asia
is a whole different kettle of fish and a huge expanding market.
</p>

<p>
Do let me know if you have any plans to update this guide ..... even a
comment on the rss feed would be fine ....
</p>


<p>
Peter
