<H2>Introduction</H2>
Slick advertisement led me to Caldera. The fancy images within the Linux Journal magazine promised software that had
features I have come to expect from a GUI.
<P> For US $30.00 one could get a lot of functionality at a decent price. What follows is a synopses of several <I>applets
</I> included with the Caldera DeskTop software.  A in-depth discussion is beyond the scope of this article. 
<HR>

<H2>Package Contents: The Manual</H2>
<P>
The provided manual, while on the thin side, is succinct. It explains how to partition the hard drive and how to select
a boot disk which best fits your hardware. You simply select the boot image from a chart based on the type of CD-ROM, NIC 
card and hard disk controller in your computer.
<P>
The DeskTop software is contained on the included CD-ROM.
<P>
You will need three disks for this installation.  One disk for the boot disk and two disks for the ram disk images.
Its up to you if you want to create a rescue disk.  I found it useless and not worth the effort. 
<P>
Use the Express Install option. You will need about 160 megs of disk space and all packages will be automatically installed
for you. The custom installation procedure will require you to baby-sit part of the installation and I found that I installed
about 90% of the software anyway.
<P>
<B>NB: </B>Using the <I><B>custom</B></I> install cause the font server to be omitted from the installation. I don't know 
why, nor have I tested this, but the font server is one major reason for my buying the software.  After all, what good is 
it to have several thousands of fonts and be forced to use Windoze in order to take advantage of the fonts?
<P>
<B>TIP:</B> Use the text based install- its faster than the graphical install. The text install takes about 45 mins.
Never timed the graphical install, but it was more than 45 mins. Times will vary depending on computer system.

<H3><EM>The Layouts</EM></H3>
<P>
Click on the below highlighted items to view the preconfigured layouts.

<A HREF="./gx/novice.gif">Novice</A><BR>
<A HREF="./gx/poweruser.gif">Power User</A><BR>
<P>
(the difference between the NOVICE and POWER USER layouts is the omission of the JOBS window in the NOVICE)
<P>
The DeskTop come with three pre-configured layouts.  Each of the layouts can be tailored to meet your special needs or wants
simply by adding programs to the desktop and then saving to a <I>user</I> version of the layout. I will save the DeskTop for
next months 'in-depth' review. The DeskTop is pretty and has several powerful aspects which deserve more than a passing mention.

What follows is a short intro. to some of the <I>'applets'</I> of the DeskTop.  I call them applets simply because I like that
idea- small useful programs which don't do alot, but are handy to have.  Crisp is the exception to this; it is a stripped down version
of a text/program editor and is very powerful.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="time">TimeTool</H2>
<P>
(Click here it view TimeTool screen<I><A HREF="./gx/timetool.gif" >fig</I></A>)
<P>
The Timetool program is used to set the system clock and date.  A nice utility and one that I welcome
over the command line program <I>date</I>.
<HR>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="print">PrintTool</H2> 
<P>
(Click here to view printtool<I><A HREF="./gx/printtool.gif" >fig</I></A>)
<P>
Have you ever struggled to set up a printer? Well, look no further amigo. This little utility takes the guess work out of
setting up print services under Linux. Simply click on <B> ADD</B>, enter the required information in each of the blocks, select either
local or remote printer and then fill in the blanks.  Save it, restart lpd and you are off and printing.
<P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME=USER>User Configure</H2></A>
<P>
(Click here to view usrcfg screen <I><A HREF="./gx/usrcfg.gif">fig</I></A>)
<P>
No surprises here folks.  Configure both your users and groups with this utility. This is a nice utility and it takes some
of the confusion and guess work out working with users and groups.  I don't know of too many harried sys admins who have botched
the users and groups files on occasion simply because they were in a hurry and didn't pay attention.  This utility makes 
it easy to add, delete users and groups as well as changing passwords if the need arises.
<P>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME=NET>Net Configure</H2></A>
<P>
(Click here to view netcfg screen <I><A HREF="./gx/netcfg.gif">fig</I></A>)
<P>
Some parts of this utility work, other parts don't. The <B>Name Servers</B> entry form doesn't work.  Entering anything here 
causes an address of 0.0.0.0 to appear instead of the one you want. As you can see from the picture, I don't have much of a
 network.  Just the loopback device.  I believe that PPP is configurable under this utility, but I've not found the ways 
 and means to do that. 
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME=GLINT>Glint</H2></A>
<P>
(Click here to view the glint screen <I><A HREF="./gx/glint.gif">fig</I></A>)
<P>
Preview I introduced the <B>LIM</B> utility which is the forerunner of <B>GLINT</B>. Both utilities are designed to install and de-install software which has been packaged according to RedHat
's <B>rpm</B> rules.  The concept behind Glint is simple: collect all of the parts of a program (or series of programs) into a 'package' and then put that package onto a floppy or CD-ROM for
distribution.  The user then extracts the package to the hard drive in one fell swoop with the Glint program.
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME=CRISP>Crisp Editor</H2></A>
<P>
(Click here to view the crisp screen <I><A HREF="./gx/crisp.gif">fig</I></A>)
<P>
<B>HERE!</B> is the <B>best</B> and only reason I am bothering with the DeskTop. Crisp is the default editor for release II of the Preview program.  It is a third party software program included on
the CD and it is truly outstanding. Only a step below WYSIWYG, it is tempting to spend the additional US $70.00 for the full blown version.  Multiple buffers, autoload of last file edited, and a row of menu
button 'goodies' help make Crisp lite a true gem of a program.  Kudos to Caldera for including it on the Preview II CD.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>
I originally planned on doing only one article on Caldera, however the more "I writ, the more to writ".  It sort of snowballed
into a monster. I believe the only way to do justice to Caldera is to break the software up into byte sized pieces and serve them
up two or three at a time.  So, next month I'll start with the most troublesome applets: the Print tool and the net configuration.
