	This year, Red Hat Software decided to hold the fourth annual Linux Expo
at Duke University's Bryan Center in Durham, North Carolina. The event was
scheduled over three days from April twenty-eighth to the thirtieth. In
addition to the normal vendor displays and conference, the Linux Expo web
site promised such diverse attractions as a quake fest and a paintball
tournament. I arrived at the Center at seven-thirty on Thursday to find
over one hundred people already ahead of me in line. Registration wasn't
until eight o'clock. Apparently I was not the only Linux fanatic champing
at the bit.
<P>
	The doors did not actually open until a little past eight, and I did not
 get in to register until about eight forty. As a pre-registered attendee, I
received a Linux Expo tote bag bearing the Expo logo, as well as logos of
Expo sponsors. Inside I found a bound copy of the proceedings, a VAResearch
tee shirt, a Red Hat cap, an issue of SysAdmin, and a Caldera flashlight, as
well as flyers advertising specials at Expo vendor booths.
<P>
	Prominently placed in front of the entrance was the Red Hat booth. Their
 booth featured the new Red Hat Linux 5.1, due to be released the following
Monday. Also on the upper floor was the Caldera, Linux Hardware solutions,
Linux International, Solid, and RHAD Labs booths, as well as the Expo store,
and the Softpro Bookstore.
<P>
	Because of registration delays, the tutorials and technical conference
fell thirty minutes behind schedule, and remained out of sync with the business
track for the rest of the day. The Extreme Linux tutorial was kicked off by
Mad Dog Hall, who explained the name Extreme Linux, and the snow
boarding penguin logo. Basically, Extreme Linux is Linux with an attitude
Although Mad Dog said that the project's founders do not want to tie.
the commodity cluster idea to a single operating system, he urged people
to use the name Extreme Linux when referring to clusters of Linux machines.
<P>
	After Mad Dog finished, Peter Beckman explained how Extreme Linux
cluste rs were used at Los Alamos' Advanced Computing Labs. Several members of
his team talked about their experiences with the system, and the problems
they had solved. The talk featured the Linux Expo cluster, a four node cluster
set up especially for the show. The cluster consisted of 4 dual 333
MHz Pentium two's, each with 256 megabytes of ram and a four gigabyte disk
drive. The cluster was tied together with a Myrinet network. After putting the cluster through its paces with modeling programs, Beckman decide
to bring out a "practical application", the Extreme Linux monster truck.
<P>
	Although it had been a radio shack remote control toy in a previous
life, the monster truck had undergone an "Extreme" transformation. The body had
been removed, and the truck's circuit board hacked. For vision, the monster
truck had a Connectix quickcam with a custom mount to allow panning.
Mounted on top was a Toshiba Libretto with a wireless Ethernet connection
to the cluster. An operator sat at the console of the cluster, controlling
the truck as it cruised across the floor observing the crowd with
its quickcam. The operator's console was projected on a screen, and the crowd
could see themselves from the truck's point of view thanks to the quickcam.
Beckman assured us that the truck had a practical use, pulling network
cables under the raised floor at Los Alamos. Without a doubt, the truck
stole the show. For more information see http://www.Extremelinux.org/.
<P>
	After the tutorial, I decided to make my way to the vendor area on the
lower level. Strategically placed at the entrance to the vendor area was Cobalt
Microserver Inc. They were showing the inexpensive Cobalt Qube microserver, a
blue 7.25"x7.25"x7.75" cube with powerful intranet server capabilities. This
little box will be near the top of every Linux geek's Christmas list.
<P>
	Inside the door I found Stay online, a retailer of inexpensively priced
computer components. The vendor area was so jammed with Linux enthusiasts
that I had a hard time getting to every booth. Linux Mall was once again
on hand offering great deals on everything. I picked up Red Hat Linux 5.
1 for twenty-five dollars and Star Office Commercial for fifty dollars. Sun
Microsystems was a very noticeable new addition to the Expo this year,
showing off complete Ultrasparc computers as well as Ultrasparc based
motherboards for building your own homebrew ultrapenguin machine. Alta
Technology and Paralogic, two vendors of pre-built Extreme Linux clusters
were also present. At another entrance, Jim Paradis of Digital Equipment
Corporation entertained a mass of power hungry linuxers with a new smp alpha
machine.
<P>
Cobalt wasn't the only company with miniature gee-whiz computers.
CorelComputer was showing off their soon-to-be released Netwinder computers.
These little boxes (9.5"x6"x2") have everything you could want in an
intranet/internet client, and can be used as web servers as well. The
Netwinder could be serious competition for the Qube, but I think many customers might choose a mixed environment of both.
<P>
	Another major attraction was the RHAD Labs booth, which featured a
couple of computers running gnome. The booth was staffed by members of the RHAD Labs development team, and Miguel de Icaza made occasional appearances.
 At just about any point in time, people were lined up three deep to get
a look and gnome and ask the developers questions. One of the gnome computers
had a camera attached to it, and some interesting pictures from the Expo
have been posted on http://www.gnome.org/.
<P>
	Toward the end of the second day of the Expo, I got an unexpected
surprise which made the show immensely better than I had expected. While
looking through the popular tee shirts offered by Xunilung, I overheard
someone proclaiming that Linux was a misnomer, and that the correct name of the
system was Gnu-Linux. This was a position I had heard before. I stepped
back from the tee shirts to peek around people who had gathered around a table
placed perpendicularly to Xunilung's. Sure enough, the gnu-linux admonishment
was coming from Richard Stallman. For those who are not familiar with rms,
as Stallman is often called, he is the person who started the gnu project in
1983 to provide a free version of Unix for anyone who wanted it, unencumbered
by proprietary licensing restrictions. Stallman is responsible for the Free
Software foundation, and the general public license.
<P>
	Although I do not really agree with him about the naming of Linux, I
firmly believe Linux could not have been developed without the tools provide
d by the FSF. Stallman has been a hero of mine since before Linus discovered
Minix, so I was somewhat speechless when I saw him there unannounced.
I stood back and watched for a while as young hackers got autographs and
bought gnu tee shirts, CD-ROMs, and books. Occasionally Stallman would place
the platter from an old disk pack on his head. With this "halo" in place, he
became Saint Richard, patron saint of the Church of Emacs, and he would bless
the young hacker's computers provided they did not have any proprietary
software on them. When it was my turn to talk to Saint Richard, I thanked
him for the work he had done, and bought two Emacs books. He signed the books
happy hacking, and happier hacking, Richard Stallman.
<P>
	After my encounter with rms on the second day of the Expo, I found my
way to the auditorium where Linus would be giving the keynote speech. I
was lucky, I found a seat about fifteen rows back from the stage. Less
fortunate fans continued to file in for another fifteen minutes, and by the
time Linus got on stage, people were standing and sitting in the aisles. An
overhead projector indicated the theme of Linus' talk, titled Ramblin'
Linus. Linus took the microphone and said "I'm Linus, and I am your god",
at which point the crowd responded with deafening applause. Linus thanked
various people for their work, in particular Alan Cox who has taken over
the normally thankless job of maintaining the stable kernel for the last
year or so. Some of the topics covered were the current state of the
development kernel, the upcoming release of the 2.2 kernel, and future
directions of kernel development. Linus spent about twenty minutes answering
questions from the audience, and then everyone filed out for a southern
style barbecue dinner in the university yard.
<P>
	Conference talks were the main focus of the Expo for me. Unfortunately
there were so many talks offered, I had a hard time making up my mind about
which ones to attend. Extreme Linux is the only tutorial I made it to,
but there were eleven more, on subjects as diverse as programming with gtk+,
Python, hacking the Linux kernel, LinuxConf, and a demonstration of the Coda
filesystem.
<P>
	The conference was broken up into a business track and a technical
track. The technical track auditorium was where I spent most of my time, but
I did make it to several interesting business talks. Robert Hart of Red
Hat Software gave a talk on linux certification dealing with what certification
meant, and who should try to get it. He also encouraged the audience to
drop off resumes at the Red Hat booth, which I did. I am still wait
ing on your call Robert. Mad Dog gave an anecdotal talk on how Linux is
used around the world, and Tim Bird of Caldera filled us in on the COAS
project. COAS is a project to develop an integrated administration tool for
Linux and possibly other unices, they are looking for volunteers, so drop
them a line. The last talk in the business track was actually a panel which
discussed free software licensing. The panel consisted of Eric Raymond,
Richard Stallman, and Bruce Perens, who moderated. Raymond's and Stallman's
views were not exactly in sync, so some very interesting discussion concerning
the state of free or open source software licensing took place.
<P>
	The technical track started earlier, and ran longer than the business
track all three days. Unfortunately, registration problems, and technical
difficulties threw the schedule off the first two days, and technical talk
s were out of sync with business talks which made it hard to move freely
between tracks. David Miller gave a very technical talk on optimizing the
Cobalt Microserver. Peter Braam of Carnegie Mellon University gave two
informative talks on the new VFS interface, and the Coda distributed files
system. The Coda team has made a lot of progress, and the filesystem is so
mething worth looking into. Peter also mentioned that the team is looking
for a good system programmer who likes interesting work, but doesn't mind
being poor.
<P>
	Bruce Perens and Daryll Strauss both gave talks on the use of computers
to make movies. Strauss showed us how a pile of alphas running Linux help
ed with the making of Titanic. During a short video presentation, he pointed
out some amazing effects that were computer generated. Bruce went over
some basics of computer animation in Toy Story, and showed an experimental
piece by Pixar called Gerry's Game. The auditorium was packed for both talks.
<P>
	Miguel de Icaza discussed the gnome project to a very large crowd. Due
to technical problems with his laptop, the talk ran over by about thirty
minutes. Fortunately, Miguel is a very entertaining speaker, and he kept
the audience's attention while half of the RHAD Labs team and a concerned
member of the audience fretted over his computer. Lars Wirzenius presented
his Linux Anecdotes, a history of the linux system from someone who was
right there when it was created. Lars shared an office with Linus at the
University of Helsinki, and was the first person to actually run Linux
on his computer. Alan Cox, a fixture at Linux Expo, gave a talk about the
trials and tribulations of porting Linux to the Apple Macintosh 68K. His
talk was titled "I don't care if space aliens ate my mouse". The title
comes from an old Apple document, apparently the only official document
ever written on the apple mouse.
<P>
	These were only a few of the talks given at the Expo, a complete list
can be found on the Linux Expo web site: http://www.linuxexpo.org . In
addition to vendors and talks, there were other things to keep Expo attendees
busy. A quake fest ran all day every day on the lower level, with deathmatches
every fifteen minutes. Prizes were awarded for the highest body count from
each match up. Birds of a Feather sessions were offered throughout
the three days on a variety of topics, and an "email garden" was set
up to allow attendees to get access to the net for checking their email.
On Thursday, the age old question of which editor, Emacs or vi, is superior
was finally answered. Obviously, the only way to resolve the issue was
through brute force, so the Expo hosted Editor Wars, a paintball tourname
nt. When the CO2 propelled paint mist settled, the vi team emerged from the
field victorious.
<P>
	Wrapping up the show Saturday evening was the second annual Linux Bowl.
Mad Dog was the host, and the teams consisted of conference speakers and
audience participants. Rasterman, of RHAD Labs, and audience members were
the judges. Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond were two of the contestants.
Some of the questions asked were: what lilo option is used to list currently
mapped files(answer: -q), what was the first kernel tar.gz to exceed
ten megabytes ( to which Bruce Perens promptly replied Microsoft NT. The
correct answer was 2.1.88), which movie featured the Red Hat Office building
(one contestant replied Debbie does Durham, and Mad Dog felt compelled
to award one point. The correct answer was Kiss the Girls), why was the
Beowulf project named Beowulf( answer: it sounded cool), and a trick question,
what was the first system to run UNIX ( answer: a pdp7).
<P>
	The Fourth Annual Linux Expo was a tremendous success, and I think every
one went home happy. The show organizers deserve a big round of applause
for their efforts, and if this year's turn out is any indication of things
to come, they had better get a bigger building next year.
