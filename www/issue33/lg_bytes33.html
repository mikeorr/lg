Links2Go Key Resource Award
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Wed, 22 Jul 1998 18:38:48 -0400<BR> 
Congratulations! Your page:
http://www.linuxgazette.com/
has been selected to receive a Links2Go Key Resource award in the
Linux topic.
<P> 
The Links2Go Key Resource award is both exclusive and objective. Fewer
than one page in one thousand will ever be selected for
inclusion. Further, unlike most awards that rely on the subjective
opinion of "experts," many of whom have only looked at tens or
hundreds of thousands of pages in bestowing their awards, the Links2Go
Key Resource award is completely objective and is based on an analysis
of millions of web pages. During the course of our analysis, we
identify which links are most representative of each of the thousands
of topics in Links2Go, based on how actual page authors, like
yourself, index and organize links on their pages.

X11.ORG goes public
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Thu, 10 Sep 1998 00:31:27 -0400 (EDT)<BR> 
One of the main purposes of X11.ORG is to provide the X community with
up-to-date information regarding "anything and everything X". By making
this information easily available, you don't have to work quite as hard to
keep up with the fast-moving pace of X developments. As it was imagined in
the development process, we will attempt to be a slashdot.org of sorts,
for the X community, focusing on those topics directly or closely related
to X.  X11.org plans to cover the setup and configuration information for
the majority of WindowManagers, Desktop Environments (eg. CDE, GNOME,
KDE), and X Servers.

IGEL
</H3>
<P>
    Palmer, PA - September 7, 1998 - IGEL LLC today
      announced the availability of Etherminal J, a Thin Client desktop device.
      The first variant has been exhibited at Thinergy '98, the first global
      conference on thin-client/server computing held in Orlando, Sept. 1-3,
      1998. 
 <P>    
    Etherminal J, based on IGEL's Flash Linux Technology,
      is the only thin client device incorporating Netscape Communicator Version
      4.05, and a complete set of UNIX connectivity tools, locally in its own
      Flash Memory. Storing and running these software modules locally keeps
      network bandwidth requirements at a minimum. IGEL's Flash Linux is a
      compressed UNIX-compatible, flash memory accessible operating system. It
      is a POSIX-conform, multi-threading multi user operating system. Based on
      the popular Linux kernel, it offers the largest number of available device
      drivers and applications. It supports Internet and Java. IGEL tailored
      this OS to support a defined Thin Client hardware, and developed a flash
      memory driver technology to compress this OS, and all accompanying
      Emulators, X11R6 X-Server, and Thin Clients for multi-user Windows NT, and
      the Netscape Communicator in 12MB of &quot;Disk-on-Chip&quot; Flash
      Memory. IGEL's BIOS extensions allow to directly boot this compressed
      Flash Linux. At run-time needed OS parts, Emulators, Thin Clients, and the
      Netscape Communicator are decompressed on demand.

Xtoolwait 1.2
</H3>
<P>
Date: Tue,  8 Sep 1998 07:54:58 GMT<BR> 
One and a half year have gone by without a single bug report, so it's time
to release a new version of Xtoolwait.
<P>
This utility notably decreases the startup time of your X sessions, provided
that you start a number of X clients automatically during the X session
startup.
Most people, for instance, start X clients like xterm, xclock, xconsole and
xosview from their .xinitrc, .openwin-init, .xtoolplaces or .xsession file.
<P>
These X clients are started simultaneously (in the background) which puts a
high load on the X server and the OS
<P>
Xtoolwait solves this problem by
starting one X client in the background, waiting until it has mapped
a window and then exiting.
<P>
Download Xtoolwait from this page<BR>

ppdd - encrypted filesystem - kernel patch and support progs.
</H3>
<P>
Date: Tue,  8 Sep 1998 08:38:12 GMT<BR> 
ppdd is an advanced encrypted file system for i386 Linux only.
<P>
ppdd is used in a similar way to the loop device and offers simplicity and
speed plus full strength encryption (128 bit).
The design takes into consideration the fact that data on disc has a
long lifetime and that an attacker may have the matching plaintext to
much of the cyphertext.
A combination of master/working pass phrases offers enhanced security
for backup copies.
Current status is BETA and comments on the
implemenation and underlying crypography are most welcome.
<P>
It consists of a kernel patch plus support programs and is intended
for users with enough knowledge to compile the kernel, setup LILO,
partition disks etc. It is not for absolute beginners or "non technical"
users yet.
<P>
Available from: <A HREF="http://pweb.de.uu.net/flexsys.mtk">

<P>
connect package is a client-server program designed to ease the sharing

Date: Thu, 10 Sep 1998 09:49:21 GMT
a new version of the GTK+ port of the cross
platform library wxWindows has been released.
<P>
To our knowledge, wxWindows is the only cross

it is not its primary goal, wxWindows should 
help make the transition from Windows to Linux 
much smoother, not the least for small companies.

Apart from being platform independent, wxWindows 
is arguably the most complete free class library

to configuration management to internationalization
to a multiple document interface and support for
printing using Postscript on Unix. We also provide
detailed documentation and a set of sample apps.
