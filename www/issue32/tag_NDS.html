<STRONG><P>Mr Dennis,
<BR>Does the new version of red hat linux support 
<a href="http://www.novell.com/">Novell</a>'s NDS.

>Support what aspects or services of NDS?
</blockquote>


<BLOCKQUOTE>Do you mean the user account management and authentication?
</blockquote>


<BLOCKQUOTE>I've heard of a PAM module that allows one to authenticate
(user) against an NDS domain (using a Novell or compatible
server).  I don't know where that is, but I'm sure there are
archives of the PAM (pluggable authentication modules) mailing
list.  I think <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> was hosting 
the PAM list and providing the archive and search space for it for awhile, 
so I'd start there.
</blockquote>


<BLOCKQUOTE>Are you referring to the ability to ncpmount Netware 4.x 
filesystems?
</blockquote>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I have no idea.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>Generally I'd suggest 
<A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> OpenLinux (Standard?) for any
interoperability with Netware.  They have the exclusive
commercial implementation of the Netware NDS and bindery
client code (which is apparently licensed such that they can't
make it freely available).

>NDS (Netware Directory Services) for Linux: Clients and Servers</H3>
<p><strong>From Dave Kauffman on 07 Aug 1998 </strong></p>
<!-- begin body -->

<strong><p>Do you know if the NDS client is now free?
</p></strong>
<strong><p><A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> just released their 
	Netware for Linux product and the 3 user license is free.
</p></strong>
<strong><p>Included in this package is their Netware client.
<br>-Dave
</p></strong>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" height="28" width="50"

>That's an interesting question.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>As far as I know their Netware client software (nwclient) 
(which supported bindery and NDS servers) was proprietary and 
under exclusive license with Caldera's distribution.  From,
what I gather, you could use the package with another Linux
installation -- but I suspect that you were legally required 
to own a copy of Caldera OpenLinux (Standard?) for every 
copy of '<tt>nwclient</tt>' you deployed.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>(I'm a bit unclear on this since the only occasions when 
I've deployed Caldera were in situations where it was a 
gateway between a set of Netware domains and a set of 
Unix systems --- basically a set of cron jobs existed to
<tt>rdist</tt> files from Netware servers out to Unix ftp and 
web hosts (in one case) and all of the Linux/Unix users had
shell accounts to access Netware servers (in another case).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>It would have been handy if I could have deployed nwclient
through the workgroup in the second case --- but a number of
them were able to use ncpfs (the free, OpenSource Netware client)
for their needs.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, with this release of Netware for Linux we get a ability
to download a copy of nwclient for free.  The question becomes
--- what rights does this entail.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>I really don't know, but it is an interesting question ---
one that I didn't think to ask when I was talking to Ransom
Love (the General Manager for OpenLinux) last night.  
(He was in town to speak at the Silicon Valley Association
of Software Entrepreneurs (<A HREF="http://www.svase.org"
	>http://www.svase.org</A>) along
with a number of other OpenSource and Linux notables.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, I'll defer it to Caldera's support address.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>At the same time I'd suggest taking a careful look at the
copyright notices and licensing that are included in the
package, as you downloaded it.  That should state any
intended limitations on the use and redistribution of the
package or its components.  It may be that the included 
copy of '<tt>nwclient</tt>' is only legally valid for use with that
server --- that, technically, you are only allowed to deploy
upto three copies of '<tt>nwclient</tt>' and that all three of those
are to be used only with that particular server.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Their licenses and copyright notices are really the 
final authority in the matter.
