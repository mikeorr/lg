I was on dial-up with kppp on an old 266MHz PC with Fedora running 2.6.2
kernel and running yum for the first time. I did not like the large
number of not small files being downloaded to my machine and did a "kill
-9" on the process. Bad bad bad. "ls" produced "Segmentation fault" as
did several other commands. Machine would not reboot. Booted from rescue
CDROM and "chroot" gave Segmentation fault".

This is indicative that glibc had yet to upgrade. You should never halt
the system in an upgrade if you can help it. <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> does a good job of
recovery, but the point is that if you do, you'll have damaged and
incomplete packages which will invariably break your system. Then you have
to go down the route of rescue CDs and the like.

Read up on chroot and  created a static linked bash on a second machine
and was able to chroot once this was in place. "ls" failed as did "vi"; pwd
worked. On a good  machine I compiled a static linked "ls"

When any one of those libs isn't happy, ain't *nobody* happy; almost

pwd worked because you were using the bash builtin as opposed to the ELF
version.

(I had to add -static to linker  and it complained about one function not
being linked in, but seems to  work. Should not one be able to make static
linked copies of  utilities/programs such as are in Fedora coreutils?).

No, the whole point of having dynamically linked files is that their size
is reduced, making them easy to put onto floppy diskettes, etc. Not only
that it allows for greater portability.

With "ls" in place on the damaged machine, I was able to see what I was
doing and recovered <TT>/lib</TT> from a two week old backup after "chroot"ing to
the damaged file  system. I have cowardly retreated to Fedora kernels and the system boots and I have discovered no problems with one exception.

Usually something like:

<blockquote><pre>mount /dev/abc /mnt &amp;&amp; chroot /mnt /bin/bash

<blockQuote>
where <TT>/dev/abc</TT> is your damaged partition, is sufficient.

On my good machine the route table when on dial up had a route to the
server I am hooked up to and the name is resolved. On my damaged machine
"host" and "dig" work in resolving names or IPs but the server name is
not resolved in the route table.  The real problem is neither Konqueror
non Mozilla will go to any Internet site regardless of whether IPs or
names are used. If an IP is used, such as 000.00.00.0 the name is
resolved in the error message stating that "www.aaaaaaa.aaaaa.com not
resolved.". Text browser lynx does work, although I am worse than a

Sounds like you're missing:

newbie with it. I have checked network files in <TT>/etc</TT> and its
subdirectories  and compared to my good machine until I am blue. I have
turned off the firewall and commented out hosts.&lt;deny allow&gt;. I have
done "rpm -V" on all installed rpms. Although the listing is not
perfectly clean, neither is it on my good machine.  I suspect something
in the <TT>/usr/lib</TT> directory. I do not believe I have been hacked but of
course who knows? How would you proceed?

This is not a <TT>/usr/lib</TT> issue, but more a question of configuration. As
well as checking for <TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT>, ensure that in the file:

<blockquote><pre>/etc/nsswitch.conf

you have the line:

<blockquote><pre>hosts:          files dns

That, is, make sure that dns is listed after files, as above.

I'm amazed at your persistence and quite tickled by yet another
demonstration of how tough Linux is. In my experience and in the stories
that I've heard from others, Linux systems can be rescued from all sorts
of incredible damage - and you've (mostly) managed to pull it off.

I would back up all my data, clear out the partition, do a fresh
install, and put the data back on. Yeah, you could be macho about it and
try to trace everything down by function... which would leave you open
to problems with subsystems you're currently not using (this will, of
course, happen long after you've forgotten that this damage even
occurred.) Since you don't know exactly what you broke, you'll never know
everything you need to fix; this is one of the situations where I'd
apply my mechanic friend Ken's dictum of "keep removing stuff until you
get to something you <EM>know</EM> is good and build up from there." It's also
the most efficient approach at this point, IMO.

I hate to clog your mailbox, but I wanted to thank Ben O. and Thomas A.
for their rapid response to my 2/20 question and their insights.

I have decided to restore my backups (only two weeks old) and if that
fails, reinstall from scratch and reload my data.
