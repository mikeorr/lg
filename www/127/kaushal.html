<h1>Review: amaroK (audio player for KDE)</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/kaushal.html">Pankaj Kaushal</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>
I have always been skeptical of media players and music management
software... using a bare minimum player like XMMS to play my digital music.
I have tried quite a few different ones: Rhythmbox, Banshee, etc.; I've
also giving a fair time to demos of iTunes and the Yahoo Music engine,
recommended by excited Mac and Windows weenies.
</p>

<p>
So, when a friend came to me and said "try amaroK!", I said, "Yeah,
<em>right!</em>" and blew the idea out with a puff of smoke.
</p>

<p>
Then, yesterday morning, I got stuck in a traffic jam and as a result
didn't feel like writing any kind of code - so I decided to install amaroK.
:) Installing it on FreeBSD 4.11 could be only covered under a full-fledged
technical orientation session; since that might scare lots of people, we
will not dwell on those perils. Besides, I have it installed under Linux as
well.
</p>

<p>
So, after I installed amaroK... was I blown? or was I
<strong><em>blown</em></strong>?
</p>

<p>
The really cool thing about amaroK is that you can install it and it's
ready to serve you in its full glory within a couple of minutes - at least
under Linux. :)
</p>

<p>
Tracks are imported into a "collection", which is displayed in the left
pane in a file manager-like fashion. Tracks must be added to a playlist
before one can hear them. There is a playlist tab which has "Smart
Playlists", and - of course - you can create your own.
</p>

<p>
Unlike most applications on Linux, eye-candy is not overlooked here, but is
actually given as much importance as usability and features. I especially
liked the "on-screen display" which comes up every time amaroK starts
playing a new track; mousing over the task bar icon shows the name of
the current song and also adds a little album cover. A lot of work
has gone into creating such a visually appealing tool, and in my opinion at
least, the effort was well worth it.
</p>

<p>
amaroK copies the winamp/XMMS shortcuts and does a great job of handling
them. It also adds XMMS shortcuts to a meta key of your choice and gives you
"Global Shortcuts." Dont like the current song? You don't have to switch
applications/virtual desktops, search for amaroK, or look for any 'skip'
keys - just press WIN+B. Sweet, or what?  
</p>

<p>
And did I tell you it displays the lyrics of the current song in a little
box? did I mention it also gives you a <a
href="http://www.musicminds.com/">musicminds</a> recommendation? maybe I
forgot about the fact that it also looks up the artist at <a
href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and shows the information in a
little box. Oh, yes... I <em>did</em> forget to mention that it
automatically downloads album covers from Amazon.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, though, amaroK gets in my way rather than helping. For example:
every time you play a song, it changes to the "Current" tab. This is rather
irritating; if you were in the 'Playlists' tab and going through a
collection - listening to a bit of this, and a bit of that - you'll be
forced to the 'Current' screen.
</p>

<p>
That being said - I really like amaroK and am really looking forward to
version 1.4.  What I particularly like about it is the cover/lyrics/tag
fetching, as well as the potential value of dynamic mode and its iPod
support.
</p>

<p>
I have Linux on my laptop, and it's also running amaroK now. In my opinion,
'gstreamer' is a whole lot more stable than 'aRts'; the latter seems to be
unmaintained, and imposes a lot of overhead.
</p>

<p>
Amarok appears to be written by hackers who themselves are truly fond of
music. It is a increasingly attractive and capable tool, and these guys
seem to be just getting warmed up. I'm really looking forward to seeing
what they'll do next!
