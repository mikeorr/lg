<P>
Diving into dry pools head-first is a good start, particularly from the
high board - it's been known to cure incipient crackers. Sure, some - well,
most - end up looking like a squashed bug, but you've got to admit, it's
much better than the alternative. Be sure to try it today!

<P> For advanced hacking skills, take a look at Eric S. Raymond's "How To Become A
Hacker", at 
<A HREF="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</A>. That takes you
all the way from beginner to advanced... not what you meant? Oh, right, I
forgot; when the cracker maggots invade your brain, language skills are the
first thing to go. &lt;shrug&gt; I guess you'll never be able to explain what you
really want, now. I understand that progression of the disease is difficult to
reverse, deterioration is rapid, and the prognosis is NOT positive.

<P> A friend of mine's got a 10th floor apartment, and the pool might even have
been emptied for the winter. Want me to ask? Really, it wouldn't take long
at all...

<P> Regarding MSN, Good news!!! I've got a *great* cracking opportunity coming up for you;
you'll need to break into MSN and establish a new account. See, you'll
*have* to do this because I'm about to report your criminal activities to
MSN - including your confession of having already "done a few hacks with
some trojan programs", so that even their admin people can have a laugh at
your terminally moronic behavior. All they have to do is look at the
headers in your e-mail (didn't know about those, did you?), compare them
with the copy that will still be on their servers (missed that one too,
huh?), and TOSs your ass so hard that you'll bounce.

<P> You know, if you ask the folks at your local TV or radio station, they
might let you climb their tower - you could get a coupla hundred feet up
that way - and you could always drag up a bathtub. Seriously, give it a
shot: it can't hurt. Well, actually it would, but it's the kind of thing
you're supposed to say...

<P>
I've got to give MSN their due: they actually have humans assigned to
dealing with this stuff, and when these folks LART one, they let you know:
"Hi, my name is X, and I'm the one assigned to this case. I've examined the
information you've sent us, and terminated our former customer on that
basis. Thank you for...", etc. They also seem to pay attention to the info
that you send them in the complaint letter. My "spamkill" file contains
quite a few from them.

<H4>This is a follow-up to an important issue we 
<A HREF="../issue74/lg_backpage.html#nottag">reported</A> in January, namely:</H4>
<STRONG>
When I gave her a stuffed Tux as a present,

Four out of five sexist computer nerds surveyed agree Tux is male.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

That might refer to Linus' original comment that penguins are happy 
because they have just stuffed themselves full of herring or have been 
hanging out with lady penguins. We only <EM>know</EM> that Tux is stuffed full 
of herring, but we can assume Tux hangs out with lady penguins. 


<P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

<P>
Which actually doesn't get say definitively whether Tux is male. Tux 
could hang out with lady penguins cf. Marlena Dietrich, or be a 
high-class drag king. 
<IMG ALT=":&gt;" SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="24">

<P> However, speaking as a dyke with a largish stuffed animal collection 
(one of whom is a female Peter Rabbit named Katja), my Tux is male. Other 
users' Tuxen may vary according to the needs of the user, much like 
their kernel configurations.

Interesting.  I wonder if Eric Raymond's enhanced kernel configurator
will have a question for which sex your kernel should be built as.

Down with $3 words!  It's ridiculous that children compete in spelling
bees over words that ordinary people would never use and don't know exist.  
Just because it's *possible* to derive a fancy Latin word for an ordinary
English word doesn't automatically make it an English word.  It's academickese,
not English.  There's probably a simple English word or circumlocution that
covers the same terrain perfectly adequately, so why not use it?  There's
nothing to be gained by using words Joe Sixpack can't understand, except for
the "few" technical terms that are absolutely necessary for a given field.

I disagree, almost entirely.
It depends, of course, on what your *objective* is, and there are many
objectives in writing: you might be trying to impress people, to inform
them, to persuade them... 
Each of these jobs requires a different set of tools, just as there
is no one answer to the question "what kind of computer should I buy"
other than "well, what are you going to *do* with it?"

<P> Certainly, it's possible to use words which are fancier-than-thou, and
lose your audience in the process.  But that possibility isn't by any
means justification for not being literate and -- dare I say it --
lyrical in your writing.

<P> But, contrary to many people's belief, I think that people want to read
elegant writing, even if it occasionally makes them need to look up a
word that they can't glark from context.

<P>
True, there is language-for-communication and language-as-art.  I would
argue that academic/techical writing is supposedly language-for-communication, 
thus, its tendency to fanciness hinders its basic purpose.  

<P> An urgent example in US society is the language of laws.  Nobody but lawyers
can understand then, and even lawyers don't agree on what the DMCA means.  How
are people supposed to obey laws they can't understand and don't have time to
read?  How can they evaluate whether the law is just?  How can they avoid being
hoodwinked?

<P> Personal writing-as-art is a personal thing.  I just don't like the way
it can hinder communication, especially works that end up being read by others
than the author intended.  For instance, when non-English speakers read Gazette
articles.  That's why try to keep LG as straightforward as possible.  I'd love
to clean up the spelling/grammar mistakes if I had the time, but I don't have
50 extra hours per month, so I just do the ones that seriously impede
communication.

<P> I read <EM>Trainspotting</EM> and think, the Scottish phonetic style offends my sense
of clarity, but the author's goal is to convey this style of thought/viewpoint
as much as it is to convey content, so I can accept it.  

<P> I read <EM>Star Wars</EM> and think, why does the author have to write in such a
convoluted manner?  It adds nothing to the story except to make it "hip".  

<P> I read <EM>Ratz Are Nice (PSP)</EM> and think, why does the author have to write in
such a slangy style? "They go weekend hunting looking for ruffboichail'z. They
wontz to be quickened... I Edison basically loseout 3 wayz."  Actually, I
never got past the first chapter.  I don't have time to sound out what he's
trying to say, much less guess what dialect they're speaking.  God forbid a
non-English speaker should take an interest in the book.  
I prefer a writing style readable by as wide an audience as possible.

Actually, the book switches between Scots and English pretty much at
random.  There are entire passages in English, and recent words like
"taxis" and "dealer" that have no Scots equivalent are just thrown in
unchanged, looking out of place because they're not spelled
phonetically.

<P> Of course, Scottish literature is pretty scarce and underrepresented,
and Irving Welsh is one of the few authors filling the gap.

I'm fairly close to the middle of this one, but with somewhat of a lean in
Jay's direction: there are times - especially when writing for a techie
audience - when the more spendy variety of verbal pyrotechnics (remember to
always and ever eschew needless and unnecessary word usage!) is called
for... but the reason is the one that Mike mentions: writing to a given
audience.

<P>
Believe it or not, I *am* a fan of writing differently depending on 
your audience.  I'm just pointing out that sometimes one's audience
ends up being bigger than anticipated, and the assumptions one made
about the audience no longer hold true.

<P> PS. Just in case it's unclear, I'm *not* complaining about anything
anybody's written on TAG.  This is just a problem I've seen other places.

There's always the "--view-the-Ethernet-source-and-destination-addresses-
