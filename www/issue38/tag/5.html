I have inherited a box with Linux installed on it and we wish to integrate
the linux email (using <tt>sendmail</tt>) with the dreaded 
ms-exchange which runs
on NT....the main reason is so that LAN clients can receive email
notifications from jobs that will run on the linux box.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Are there any quick guides out there on this procedure..
<br>thanks mate

There should be no special work in this regard.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let's assume that your domain was "<tt>downunder.nz</tt>"
and that you MS Exchange server is configured as
the primary "<tt>MX</tt>" host for that domain (meaning that
all outside mail to "foo@downunder.nz" gets directed
to it).  Let's say your Linux system is named <tt>penguin</tt>.
So you can create an <tt>MX</tt> record for <tt>penguin.downunder.nz</tt>
and mail to foo@penguin.downunder.nz will go to the
Linux system rather than the MS Exchange server (which
we'll call "<tt>msnail</tt>" --- &lt;g&gt;for "MS Nt mAIL"&lt;/g&gt
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now mail coming <EM>from</EM> penguin, to <A HREF="mailto:foo@downunder.nz"
	>foo@downunder.nz</A> will
go automatically to <tt>msnail.downunder.nz</tt> where MS Exchange
will mangle it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A better approach is to point your primary <tt>MX</tt> record to
<tt>penguin</tt>.  Penguin can then have a large aliases file for all
of the users and accounts that exist in your domain ---
directing the mail to the more specific hosts on which those
users get their mail.  Thus all the MS Outlook and MS Mail
users could get their mail from <tt>msnail</tt>, while your Linux
users can get theirs directly from <tt>penguin</tt> (either via
POP/IMAP or by logging in to their shell account and reading
mail with '<tt>elm</tt>', '<tt>pine</tt>', '<tt>mutt</tt>', 
or any mailer they like.
You heavy volume mail users who are using MS Outlook can
still get their mail directly from <tt>penguin</tt> (via POP).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The main advantages to this approach:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote>
Your Linux system probably has a much higher
stability and capacity than NT on comparable
hardware.  So your high volume mail users
won't be bringing down the system for everyone
else.  (It's very hard to flood a modern Linux
system with just e-mail).
</BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You have simple remote configuration and management
of your mail routing (telnet in and edit your
<TT>/etc/aliases</TT> file, then run '<tt>newaliases</tt>').
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can easily create "magic accounts" like
"info@downunder.nz" which feed into autoresponder
scripts (presumably in the simple procmail
scripting language).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You have no licensing constraints, costs or
restrictions.   If you want to add a hundred
new e-mail users, or a thousand --- you just
create the accounts on penguin and have your
account holders point their favorite mail readers
(Netscape Communicator, Pegasus, Eudora, even
MS Outlook) at it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You have relatively easy and <EM>free</EM> access to
a number of evolving anti-spam systems (such as
the RBL (real-time blackhole list).  I haven't
heard of any patches or modules for MS Exchange
to enable RBL support --- and I suspect that
MS would only provide such services on a fee-driven
subscription basis (rather than as a community
service, like Paul Vixie is doing with the RBL).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The difference between these two approaches:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BlockQuote>
In the first case we set up a different <tt>MX</tt> record
for <tt>penguin</tt>.  Anyone who needed to send mail <EM>to</EM> an
account on that system needed to use the full name:
	foo@penguin.downunder.nz.  Mail to 
	foo@downunder.nz
would go to the <tt>msnail</tt> host.  You might have some
options for autoforwarding from the MS box --- but
you'd have to talk to your MS wizards on how to do
it.  It probably involves filling in some GUI dialog
somewhere (requiring you to work at its console) and
its probably subject to MS pricing and licensing ---
i.e. you're paying extra for each account.
</BlockQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the second case we reverse that:  Mail defaults
to landing on <tt>penguin</tt>.  The further routing from
there is trivial (since <tt>sendmail</tt>, <tt>aliases</tt> and
<tt>.forward</tt> files have been used by the majority of
the Internet for over 20 years).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In summary:  MS Exchange can recieve SMTP (Internet mail)
so there is no trick to "integrating" them with '<tt>sendmail</tt>'
'<tt>qmail</tt>' or other Internet MTAs (mail transport agents).
I've heard some people complain about MS Exchange's
behavior (generating mail with "ugly" <tt>WINMAIL.DAT</tt>
attachments that the rest of the net doesn't care for),
compliance (subtle ways that it doesn't conform to the
RFCs and implementation conventions of other systems ---
but these might be argued as a "failure to be bug
compatible" --- so those are moot), performance (more than
100 "normal" e-mail accounts, or 50 "heavy users" will
probably require considerable hardware under NT --- while
an old 386 or 486 can handle those loads under Linux), and
robustness (my household POP server has been up for over
a 125 days; I have no idea why I rebooted it 4 months ago
but I know it wasn't for any real problem --- maybe it was
when I was rewiring and cleaning out the server closet).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, what have you tried so far?  What sorts of problems
are you encountering?
