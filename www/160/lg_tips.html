<h3>2-cent Tip: Reading MHT files in Linux</h3>

<p>
Just ran across Yet Another Proprietary Format from Micr0s0ft: .mht
files. Seems that Internet Explorer saves emails and HTML as an ugly
mess that somewhat resembles an email; according to Wikipedia, there's
no single standard, and the state of the state is best described as
'sauve qui peut' (which translates, at least in Redmond, as "all your
ass are belong to me!") Bleh.
</p>

<p>
Searching the Web shows that there are a lot of people - the
just-converted-to-Linux newbies, particularly - who have loads of these
things and don't know what to do with them. Some people recommend Opera
(I <strong>suppose</strong> a couple of hours of Kiri Te Kanawa is good for relieving
all kind of stress...); some have had luck with various conversion
utilities. I looked at it, and it looked something like a mangled email
header, soooo...
</p>

<p>
I didn't go searching for more than just the one file that I had, but
here's what worked fine for opening it:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# Convert line-ends to Unix format
flip -ub file.mht
# Prepend a standard 'From ' mail header to the file
sed -i '1i\'"$(echo From $USER $(date))" file.mht
# You should now be able to open it with your favorite MUA
mutt -f file.mht
</pre>

<p>
It worked fine for me.

Not very Linux related, but this is a nice tip anyway.
</p>

<p>
If you use a future mail page (like <a href='http://www.futureme.org/'>http://www.futureme.org/</a> ) in
conjunct with a email to sms gateway (you can get a list here:
<a href='http://www.mutube.com/projects/open-email-to-sms/gateway-list/'>http://www.mutube.com/projects/open-email-to-sms/gateway-list/</a> ), you
can send reminders in a free, fast way, directly to your cellphone
(and futureme doesnt even need you to signup for an account)

&gt; 	I don't know this qualifies as one but I have used it quite a bit and I 
&gt; have not seen it mentioned elsewhere. Nor have I found it in the docs. 
&gt; This uses the convert function from ImageMagick.
&gt;
&gt; 	Why? Because many years ago I became addicted to collecting truetype 
&gt; files. There are only a relative few significantly different ones. For 
&gt; the majority they are the same files with a different names. Most of the 
&gt; rest just don't look different enough to matter. I used this to find the 
&gt; one or two gems per thousand.
&gt;
&gt; 	This works to produce a jpg, or any other image format, of the font. It 
&gt; also works on otf files.
</pre>

<p>
You may not be aware of this, but TrueType files can be viewed with the
'display' program - just as if it were another type of image.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; convert font_name.ttf font_name.ttf.jpg
&gt;
&gt; 	Generally a filed named ttf-convert
&gt;
&gt; #!/bin/bash
&gt; while [ $# -gt 0 ];
&gt; do
&gt; convert $1 $1.jpg
</pre>

<p>
This will, of course, fail if the file is called something like
'MS Verdana.ttf' (note the space.) It's <strong>always</strong> a good idea to
double-quote variables used as arguments.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; shift;
&gt; done

<p>
Um... wrong tool for the job, I'm afraid. A "while" loop is a
state-tester (i.e., checks for true/false and loops); the "for" loop is
an iterator, which walks ("iterates") over a list of arguments - which
is the exact requirement here.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
# Loop over the list of all command-line arguments
for f
do
	/usr/bin/convert "$f" "$f.jpg"
done
</pre>

<p>
...but since it's really a one-liner, I would just tend to type things
like
</p>

<pre>
for f in *ttf; do convert "$f" "$f.jpg"; done
</pre>

<p>
right on the command line. It's not much harder to remember than yet
another script name. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<h3>2-cent Tip: Easy way to make security context of two files/directories exactly the same</h3>

<p>
If you're administering a Linux system with SELinux policy being
enforced, you'll know that most of the times you need to set security
context of certain files/directories so it can be properly accessed by
daemons or users.
</p>

<p>
If the task is something like "I create new directory /var/apache/html
to put HTML files for my new Apache virtual host", you should make
security context of /var/apache/html exactly like /var/www/html
(assuming it is the default DocumentRoot of Apache). This command does
that for you:
</p>

<pre>
# chcon --reference=/var/www/html /var/apache/html
</pre>

<p>
For additional information, chmod and chown also employ the same
option too. e.g:
<pre>
# chmod --reference=/var/www/html /var/apache/html
</pre>
makes the access permissions on both directories exactly the same.
</p>

<p>

<h3>2-cent Tip: What was that (masked) script's name?</h3>

<p>
Over the years, I've written hundreds of scripts to help me with various
tasks. Many of them are still very useful - but whether my memory isn't
what it used to be (hmm... I wonder if I can write a script to fix
that...), or whether that's just too many things to keep in my head,
I've often found myself searching and cursing when I couldn't find the
script that I needed and <strong>knew</strong> I'd already written. Too many scripts!
</p>

<p>
To deal with this, I've started copying something that I already do
elsewhere. When I teach, I give my students a group of scripts that I've
made up for each class - and in each of these scripts, I insert an
explanatory comment on line 3 (1 is the shebang, while 2 is a comment
containing the author credit and a timestamp.) I try to come up with
keywords that will be obvious even if I can't remember what I wrote
originally. I also include a 'README' script which reports the third
line of every file in the directory. There's even a method for ignoring
files and adding your own descriptions (do try to avoid the latter, for
obvious reasons.)
</p>

<p>
So, all you need to do is get in the habit of commenting your scripts in
clear and obvious ways on the third line. Once you've done that, this
little script will save you much time and frustration. Enjoy!
</p>
