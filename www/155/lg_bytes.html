<h2>News in General</h2>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Xen 3.3 Hypervisor Released</h3>

<p>The Xen.org community has released the Xen 3.3 engine which includes
enhancements in performance, scalablity, and security.</p>

<p>The new engine handles workloads with high degrees of multiplexing and
supports optimal power usage per server. In addition, Xen utilizes both
hardware and software techniques to enable it to virtualize both current
and legacy operating systems.</p>

<p>Xen 3.3 also supports the new Xen Client Initiative (XCI), a Xen.org
community effort to accelerate and coordinate the development of fast,
free, compatible embedded Xen hypervisors for laptops, PCs and PDAs. The
XCI is targeting three use cases: using Xen to run 'embedded IT' VMs that
allow remote support, security, and service of PCs through embedded IT
applications without any impact on the user's primary desktop OS; 'instant
on' applications that can be immediately available as separate VMs from the
user's primary desktop OS; and 'application compatibility' VMs, which allow
legacy PC applications to run as VMs, alongside the user's primary desktop
OS.</p>

<p>Intel has contributed hardware and software virtualization capabilities
to ensure that Xen-based solutions take full advantage of next-generation
microprocessor technologies. "Xen 3.3 is optimized for Intel's next
generation micro-architecture Nehalem features: enhanced power management,
performance, I/O and networking features for building flexible resource
management solutions in an energy-efficient data center," said Imad Sousou,
Director of Intel Open Source Technology Center.</p>

<p>The release is now available for download from the Xen.org community
site and is the product of a distributed development effort by senior
engineers from more than 50 leading hardware, software, and security
vendors. For more information, please visit www.xen.org.</p>

<p>The first Xen Summit of 2009 will occur February 24 - 25 and will be
hosted by Oracle in Redwood Shores, CA.</p>


<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">VMware vClient Desktops to Follow Users</h3>

<p>At VMworld 2008 in September, VMware announced its vClient Initiative.
vClient is aimed at delivering universal clients - desktops that follow
users to any end point while providing an experience that is secure, cost
effective, and easy for IT to manage.  </p>

<p>This is more significant because vClient is based on ESX, VMware's
bare-metal hypervisor. The underlying technology is a step forward for
desktop virtualization. With ESX, there is no other host environment like
a Linux OS.  This also allows an enterprise to project a single, virtualized
desktop image that could run on all user computers, regardless of installed
OS.  IT administrators will be able to manage, update, and secure all of
these desktops centrally.</p>

<p>The first step of the initiative is the roll out of VMware View, a set
of products that extend VMware's Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) to
include both server-hosted virtual desktops and client virtual desktops
that can run on any laptop or desktop computer. VMware View is actually a
portfolio of products that give end users a single view of all their
applications and data in a familiar, personalized environment - "myview" -
that is available from any device and location. </p>
 
<p>The vClient Initiative also includes several new desktop virtualization
technologies previewed at VMworld which VMware will introduce in 2009.
These new technologies include client virtualization, image management
(available as VMware View Composer) and an offline desktop.  Together,
these technologies make desktops, applications and user profiles secure and
fully mobile. Partners including Fujitsu Siemens, HP and NEC have embraced
and endorsed VMware's universal client and the benefits in extending
virtualization from the datacenter to the desktop.</p>

<p>VMware View products encapsulate operating systems, applications, and
user data into isolated layers, giving organizations the ability to update
and deploy each element independently. Additional technologies that will
help simplify desktop management include:</p>

<p>- VMware View Composer, an advanced desktop image management tool that
simplifies updating and patching desktop users while retaining individual
user data and settings.<br />

- Offline Desktop, which enables users to access their server-hosted desktops
  offline.</p>

<p>VMworld, now in its fifth year, with more than 14,000 attendees, focuses
on products and best practices for virtualizing the enterprise. For more

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Foundation Legal Summit in October</h3>

<p>The next Linux Foundation Legal Summit will take place October 14 - 15,
2008 at IBM's Hawthorne, New York facility. This event follows the Legal
Summit in April of this year that took place at Motorola Customer Briefing
Center in Schaumburg, Ill.</p>

<p>The first LF Legal Summit was held October 25 - 26, 2007 in Boston and
focused on effective ways to collaborate in the development of compliance,
education programs, and evolving intellectual property rights policies
optimized to support open development models.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM Breaks Performance Records with SSDisk</h3>

<p>Engineers and researchers at the IBM's Hursley development lab in
England and the Almaden Research Center in California have demonstrated
groundbreaking performance results that outperform the world's fastest disk
storage solution by over 250%.</p>

<p>The results were achieved using flash solid-state technology coupled
with IBM's industry-leading, highly scalable storage virtualization
technology. Under the codename "Project Quicksilver," IBM achieved
groundbreaking results in transferring data at a sustained rate of over one
million Input/Output (I/O) per second -- with a response time of under one
millisecond (ms). Compared to the fastest industry benchmarked disk
system(1), Quicksilver improved performance by 250% at less than
1/20th the response time, took up 1/5th the floor space and required only
55% of the power and cooling.</p>

<p>Quicksilver is part of IBM's focus on leveraging emerging systems
technologies to deliver advanced data center capabilities. Performance
improvements of this magnitude can have profound implications for business,
allowing 2 to 3 times the work to be completed in a given timeframe for classic
workloads and creating opportunity for entirely new information warehouse
and analytic solutions.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">HP Breaks the 24-hour Battery Life Barrier</h3>

<p>HP reached an unprecedented milestone in mobile computing: up to 24
hours of continuous notebook operation on a single battery charge. As
measured by an industry-standard benchmark, the new HP EliteBook 6930p
configured with an optional ultra-capacity battery delivered up to 24 hours
of battery runtime.</p>

<p>"All-day computing has been the holy grail of notebook computing," said
Ted Clark, senior vice president and general manager, Notebook Global
Business Unit, HP. "With the HP EliteBook 6930p, customers no longer have
to worry about their notebook battery running out before their work day is
over."</p>

<p>This achievement required new equipment in a unique configuration:
energy dense HP batteries, new Intel solid-state hard drives (SSD), and a
new HP mercury-free LED display. For example, the highly efficient HP
Illumi-Lite LED display boosts battery run time by up to 4 hours compared
to traditional LCD displays, while the Intel SSD provides up to a 7 percent
increase in battery life.  Special graphics drivers and a special BIOS were
also required.</p>

<p>With up to 24 hours of battery life, business travelers can easily use
their laptop on the world's longest scheduled commercial airline flight -
linking Newark International Airport and Singapore Changi Airport -
approximately 18 hours, 40 minutes. This EliteBook configuration will be
available starting in October.</p>

<p>In addition to helping achieve outstanding battery life, the new Intel
SSDs provide greater reliability as well as faster system
responsiveness.</p>

<p>The ENERGY STAR HP EliteBook 6930p configuration starts at only 4.7
pounds (2.1 kg) and features a 14.1-inch diagonal widescreen display; the
mercury-free Illumi-Lite LED is optional.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Amazon to sell XO laptops for G1,G1 2008</h3>

<p>One Laptop per Child will be selling its XO Laptop on Amazon.com in late
2008 as part of a renewed global "Give One, Get One" (G1,G1) program.
Although the One Laptop per Child views the first iteration of the G1,G1
program as extremely successful (it sold more than 185,000 laptops), the
delivery of the laptops in the USA did not run smoothly last year and its
fulfillment agent suffered processing and shipping problems. Some buyers
did not receive their XOs until March.</p>

<p>This year, they will be selling their neo-laptops on Amazon.com. Perhaps
size matters for some things. OLTP has a staff of 2 dozen.  They expect to
do better with Amazon, which has the resources to process and ship the
laptops globally.</p>

<p>In addition, and contrary to some media reports, the Xmas XO will be an
only Linux-based laptop and not a dual-boot machine running both a
pre-shrunk Windows and Linux.</p>

<p>In conjunction with the Xmas sales plan, Sugar Labs is currently working
to get the 8.2 software release finished so it can be loaded onto the Xmas
XOs. In addition to interface and preformance improvements, the coming
release of Sugar will allow the WiFi interface to be turned off when using
the XO as a book reader.  This and a Deep suspend mode which consumes only
0.5W will allow battery life to stretch up to 40 hours.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google's Tenth Anniversary Celebration: Project 10<sup>100</sup></h3>

<p>
Google is celebrating its tenth birthday/anniversary with a new project to
promote positive change in the world. From <a
href="http://www.project10tothe100.com">their Web site</a>: "Project 10^100
(pronounced "Project 10 to the 100th") is a call for ideas to change the
world by helping as many people as possible." 
</p>

<p>
More excerpts:<br>
"10<sup>100</sup> is another way of expressing the number "googol," a one followed
by one hundred zeroes. Our company's very name expresses our goal of
achieving great results through smart technology that starts small and
scales dramatically over time to have a tremendous long-term impact.
Project 10<sup>100</sup> is a similar attempt to produce those kinds of scalable
results by harnessing our users' insights and creativity. We don't know
what ideas would help the most people. This project's premise is that maybe
you do."
</p>

<p>
Entries must be submitted by October 20, 2008. A youtube video is an
optional part of the entry. 

<p>
The categories for submissions are:<br>
Community: How can we help connect people, build communities and protect
unique cultures?<br>
Opportunity: How can we help people better provide for themselves and their
families?<br>
Energy: How can we help move the world toward safe, clean, inexpensive
energy?<br>
Environment: How can we help promote a cleaner and more sustainable global
ecosystem?<br>
Health: How can we help individuals lead longer, healthier lives?<br>
Education: How can we help more people get more access to better
education?<br>
Shelter: How can we help ensure that everyone has a safe place to live?<br>
Everything else: Sometimes the best ideas don't fit into any category at
all.
</p>

<p>
Google has committed $10 million to fund up to five ideas selected by an
advisory board. A selection of Google employees will review all the ideas
submitted and select 100 for public consideration. The 100 top ideas will
be announced on January 27, 2009, at which point Google will invite the
public to select twenty semi-finalists. An advisory board will then choose
up to five final ideas for funding and implementation. The following five
criteria will be considered by the advisory panel in evaluating and
selecting the winning ideas:<br>

Reach: How many people would this idea affect?<br>
Depth: How deeply are people impacted? How urgent is the need?<br>
Attainability: Can this idea be implemented within a year or two?<br>
Efficiency: How simple and cost-effective is your idea?<br>
Longevity: How long will the idea's impact last?<br>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Virtualization Wrapup</h3>

<h4>Citrix Unveils XenServer 5 for Cloud Computing with usage-based pricing</h4>

<p>Citrix Systems has announced Citrix Cloud Center (C3) for service
providers. The earlier Citrix Delivery Center product enabled enterprise
customers to transform their datacenters into delivery centers, delivering
apps and desktops as a "cloud-like" service to their end users. The new C3
product family extends these same benefits to Internet-based cloud
providers, providing them with a complete set of service delivery
infrastructure building blocks for cloud computing.</p>

<p>Citrix earlier this year introduced per-server pricing for XenServer 5,
allowing customers to take full advantage of rapidly increasing CPU and
memory capacity of modern servers without paying per CPU core. XenServer 5
also features new XenConvert P2V and V2V conversion tools. Citrix is now
introducing consumption-based pricing for C3, to meet the needs of service
providers that charge their customers based on their metered resource use.
Single developer copies of XenServer are free, but cost $900 each for
multi-server licensing and up to $3000 for the Enterprise Edition with
support for clustering and XenMotion. It is based on the earlier 3.2
version of the Xen engine.</p>

<p>With C3 comes the new XenServer Cloud Edition, a virtual infrastructure
solution optimized for service provider environments and available as a
stand-alone virtual infrastructure platform or as an upgrade pack to open
source Xen implementations. Other Citrix Delivery products that comprise C3
are NetScaler for optimization of application performance in the cloud,
WANScaler to bridge the enterprise to the cloud and Workflow Studio to
provide a rich orchestration capability. Workflow Studio also makes it easy
for customers to integrate Citrix solutions with third-party products to
automate end-to-end application delivery processes. </p>

<p>Citrix Cloud Center (C3) is available immediately and includes XenServer
Cloud Edition, Citrix NetScaler and Workflow Studio Tech Preview.</p>

<p>A summary of new features for XenServer 5 is available here:<br />

<h4>Sun Expands Virtualization Portfolio with xVM products</h4>

<p>In September, Sun Microsystems announced Sun xVM Server and Sun xVM Ops
Center 2.0, key components in its comprehensive virtualization strategy.
Additionally, Sun launched xVMserver.org, a new open source community,
where developers can download the first source code bundle for Sun xVM
Server software and contribute to the direction and development of the
product at <a href="http://www.xvmserver.org">http://www.xvmserver.org</a>. Additional
pieces of the Sun xVM virtualization portfolio, including Sun xVM
VirtualBox software and Sun xVM Ops Center, are open source and freely
available for immediate download at <a
href="http://www.openxvm.org">http://www.openxvm.org</a>. </p>

<p>With the release of Sun xVM Ops Center 2.0, Sun provides integrated
management of virtual and physical environments. The new release adds
virtual guest management to its existing ability to manage physical
infrastructures, making it easier for users to manage thousands of
geographically distributed systems simultaneously. Sun xVM Ops Center
simplifies the discovery, provisioning, updating, monitoring, and reporting
of physical and virtual assets, as well as compliance reporting via one
unified browser-based interface.</p>

<p>With the new Sun xVM Server software, Sun delivers an easy-to-use, open
source, datacenter-grade server virtualization solution to virtualize and
manage heterogeneous workloads, including Windows, Red Hat and SUSE Linux,
Solaris and OpenSolaris operating systems, on Sun x86 platforms and
SPARC-based servers. Sun xVM Server software provides built-in management
through a browser, enterprise-class scalability, reliability, and security.
Sun xVM Server software is designed to inter-operate with VMware and uses
the same virtual hard disk and virtual appliance formats, enabling
customers to easily move workloads between VMware ESX and Sun xVM Server
software. </p>

<p>Sun xVM Server is open source software but support subscriptions can be
purchased in 4 socket increments at $500/yr.  Sun xVM Infrastructure
Enterprise costs $2000 in 4 socket increments for unlimited users.</p>

<p>xVM Ops Center can be integrated with system management tools from Dell,
HP, and other system vendors and can manage over 50 K CPU cores.</p>

<p>Sun estimates that customers running Sun xVM Server software can expect
up to 50% savings in their virtualization infrastructure costs when
compared to offerings from leading competitors.</p>

<h4>Sun Microsystems Unveils xVM VirtualBox 2.0</h4>

<p>Sun Microsystems released a new version of Sun xVM VirtualBox, its high
performance, free and open source desktop virtualization software, as well
as Sun xVM VirtualBox Software Enterprise Subscription, a new offering for
24/7 premium support for enterprise users.  xVM VirtualBox software is the
first major open source hypervisor to support the most popular host
operating systems, including Mac OS X, Linux, Windows, Solaris and
OpenSolaris. To download the software and sign up for an enterprise support
subscription, visit <a
href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/virtualbox/get.jsp">http://www.sun.com/software/products/virtualbox/get.jsp</a></p>

<p>Users of xVM VirtualBox 2.0 software will now benefit from new support
for 64-bit versions of operating systems like Windows Vista and RedHat
Enterprise Linux, in addition to all other major host operating systems.
The software also offers a new user interface for the Mac platform,
improved networking for the Mac OS X and Solaris OS, as well as improved
performance, especially on AMD chips. Additionally, customers who purchase
an enterprise subscription will also receive a Right-to-Use License,
allowing them to deploy the xVM VirtualBox platform using their own
software deployment tools. Subscriptions start at $30 (USD) per user per
year, which includes 24/7 support, and discounts are available based on
volume.</p>

<p>xVM VirtualBox software lets users create "virtual machines" into which
they can install their operating system of choice, so developers can easily
build, test and run cross-platform, multi-tier applications on a single
laptop or desktop computer. Only a 20 megabyte download, xVM VirtualBox
software installs in less than five minutes.</p>

<p>Sun's xVM VirtualBox software has received awards and positive reviews
from top industry experts. Most recently, the software won InfoWorld's 2008
Bossies (Best of Open Source Software) Awards in the "Best of open source
platforms and middleware: Desktop virtualization" category.</p>

the virtual machine and critical data in minutes instead of hours.</p>

<p>HP Insight Dynamics - VSE is an integrated solution to visualize, plan
and change physical and virtual resources in the same way improving data
center efficiency . Combined with VMware VirtualCenter, the solution
provides for high-availability and simplified provisioning of resources
across the data center. HP Insight Dynamics - VSE with VMware VirtualCenter
can pre-emptively move virtual machines to a different hardware platform
before any downtime occurs.</p>

<p>New HP VDI Services is a desktop replacement solution that provides
security for data and applications on a desktop and lowers the cost of
desktop life cycle management, while providing users with the experience of
a standard desktop.</p>

<p>HP's thin client portfolio has been certified for VMware Virtual Desktop
Manager, VMware's connection broker. This certification ensures HP
customers of easy deployment of VMware VDI with any HP thin client.</p>

<p>HP is offering a product for automated disaster recovery for virtualized
environments. HP and VMware have worked together to develop an integrated,
simple and automated disaster recovery solution for virtual environments.
