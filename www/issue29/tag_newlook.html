<font color="#333399">&gt;&gt; I've completely changed the look of this column.
</font>

<br><br>
I don't like this new look one bit. It's much harder to follow
everything when every time you finish one question you have to go back
to the main page and then pursue another link. I much prefer the all in
one big page layout.

<br><br>
Just casting my vote for less page fragmentation, that's all.

	David,

<br><br>
	We'll be adding a few more navigation links to the bottom 
	of each question, so you can continue onto the next one
	without going "back up" and "down" again.

<br><br>
	Part of the impetus to "fragment" this column is to be 
	more search engine friendly.  When someone is looking for
	information relating to two or more concepts it is 
	quite frustrating to keep hitting a few "eclectic" pages
	that cover diverse, unrelated material on large single HTML 
	pages.

<br><br>
	Also, while I appreciate that many of the regular readers 
	of my column read the whole thing, straight through (apparently
	as much for my occasional rants and tirades as for the 
	technical references), I have to be considerate for the 
	"browsers" --- those readers who look over the table of contents
	and the list of question/titles and just want to load selected
	ones.  I hate to waste their bandwidth by shipping them 100K when 
	they only want to see a couple of 5 to 8 kilobyte blocks.

<br><br>
	For those who prefer to fetch "The whole thing" (to mirror
	it unto their localhost pages or go through it using a file:/
	URL) I definitely suggest following the link to the 
	<a href="ftp://ftp.ssc.com/pub/lg/lg-issue29.tar.gz">.tar.gz</a>
	file as referenced by the main home page at:

<br><dl>
		<dt><a href="http://www.linuxgazette.net/"
		>http://www.linuxgazette.net/</a>

</dl><br>
	(Yes, we get a whole domain, now.  Though I have to wonder
	why SSC made it a .com rather than a .org)

<br><br>
	The other motivation is that I simply want to make links of
	references I to the source material that I use to answer
	your questions.  It has always bothered my sense of craftsmenship
	that these weren't "hot."

<br><br>
	Finally it gives me the chance to proofread and comment on the 
	collection of questions and answers before they "go to press."  
	By that time the person who orginally posed their question has 
	long since recieved it via e-mail (and usually solved their 
	problem).

<br><br>
	However, the point of putting it in the Gazette is to make the
	same answer available to a broader audience and to let the 
	search engines pick up on them.  Which leads us right back to
	my first reason for wanting to have them in separate pages.

<br><br>
	If you see that "<tt>+LDAP +Linux +NT</tt>" comes up on an Alta Vista
	search, you want to know that this is an article about
	the co-existence of "light-weight directory access protocol"
	(LDAP) and Linux and NT.  You'll be irritated and disappointed
	if it's a large page that has disparate references to each.
	(Ooops.  Now someone's going to hit those references in 
	<strong>this</strong>.  Oh well, at least it will be a 
	<strong>small</strong> page and quick to scan for relevance).

<blockquote>
	I really do apologize for not giving you internal navigation
	within the Answer Guy column.  That's fixed this time, and I
	hope you find it useful.  I was in a rush to make everything
	beautiful for release...

<br><br>
	You could also read "<a href="issue29.html">The Whole Damn
	Thing</a>" version of the Linux Gazette, in which the footers
	are stripped between Answer Guy letters, but you'd also be 
	downloading and paging through the other Gazette articles.

<br><br>
	If that was a bit more than you hoped, perhaps you understand
	what visitors coming in via a search engine might feel like.
	Since I personally use search engines <strong>a lot</strong> --
	more than 70% of my web visits start with a search -- I sure notice.
