<h1>Hollywood, Linux, and CinePaint at FOSDEM 2008</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/rowe.html">Robin Rowe</a></b></p>

<p>As keynote speakers, Gabrielle Pantera and I (Robin Rowe) are
presenting <i><a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2008/schedule/events/250">Tux
with Shades, Linux in Hollywood</a></i> on February 23rd at FOSDEM
2008 in Brussels. Philip Paeps of FOSDEM asked that we answer
the following questions.</p>

<p><b><i>1. Could you briefly introduce yourself?</i></b></p>

<p>Gabrielle and I are partners in <a href="http://movieeditor.com/">MovieEditor.com</a>,
founded in 1999. We're co-founders of the 2,200-member filmmakers
association <a href="http://screenplaylab.com/">ScreenPlayLab</a>
(www.screenplaylab.com). I'm the project manager for <a href="http://cinepaint.org/">CinePaint</a>
(www.cinepaint.org), a popular open source motion picture retouching
tool that's the same type of application as Photoshop. I write
for <a href="http://linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</a>. Gabrielle
writes for the newspaper British Weekly. My background includes
being chief technologist at a Fortune 500 defense company, a navy
research scientist, and teaching software design at two universities.
I've worked for NBC as a technical director and had an office
on the lot at DreamWorks Animation. I work on television, film
and live events such as <a href="http://www.comedywalk.com/">COMEDY
WALK</a>. Gabrielle works at a film production company making
major movies.</p>

<p><b><i>2. What will your talk be about, exactly?</i></b></p>

<p>We'll talk about Linux in the motion picture industry, especially
its use at the major studios. This community is an upside-down
parallel universe where Linux is everywhere, and Windows and Mac
are niche operating systems. We'll talk about how the movie <i>Titanic</i>
touched off a mass migration to Linux, what Linux tools are used
and how. The result is virtually every blockbuster or animated
feature in theaters today is made using Linux tools.</p>

<p>Every major studio and many minor ones are using Linux for
visual effects and feature animation. Linux-based studios include
CFC-Framestore, Digital Domain, Disney/Pixar, Double Negative,
DreamWorks Animation, Flash Film Works, Hammerhead, Industrial
Light &amp; Magic, the Moving Picture Company, Rhythm &amp; Hues,
Sony Pictures Imageworks, Tippett Studios, Vanguard Animation,
Weta, Wild Brain, and more. Why is Linux #1? How does an industry
convert in mass to Linux in the midst of production? Which distros
and kernels do they use?</p>

<p>At first, studios had no choice but to develop Linux applications
in house. The film industry has millions of lines of Linux code,
both desktop applications and server pipelines. Studio Linux programmers
write code in C++, Python, Perl, and Java. What does all this
secret proprietary Linux code do? And, why do they do parallel
programming with grid computing? How does the film industry use
renderfarms with thousands of CPUs?</p>

<p>Studios no longer have to develop their own tools. They can
buy the Linux tools they need off the shelf. Commercial Linux
motion picture tools available today include Combustion, FrameCycler,
Houdini, Maya, Mental Ray, Nuke, Piranha, Platform LXF, RaveHD,
RenderMan, SoftImage|XSI and more. What are all these tools for
and where did they come from? What do they cost? How did a vibrant
commercial Linux applications market emerge in this industry,
and why nowhere else?</p>

<p>The film industry has funded open source development. CinePaint,
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, and <a href="http://fltk.org/">FLTK</a>
are open source projects that have received financial support
from the film industry in the past. FLTK was developed at Digital
Domain to support their proprietary application development and
then released LGPL. What kind of crazy open source world is this
where copyright zealot Disney funds development of LGPL code in
Wine to replace Windows? Why isn't the film industry doing more
to support open source development?</p>

<p><b><i>3. What do you hope to accomplish by giving this talk?
What do you expect?</i></b></p>

<p>To entertain and inform. We expect to have fun!</p>

<p><b><i>4. How does CinePaint differ from plain GIMP, apart from
higher fidelity?</i></b></p>

<p>CinePaint is software for painting and retouching sequences
of high fidelity (more bits per pixel) high dynamic range (can
go brighter than a white sheet of paper) images. If you're a film
studio or pro photographer you have to choose CinePaint over GIMP
because GIMP can't open your high fidelity images without crushing
them. High fidelity and HDR images are not normally encountered
outside of the film, pro photography and print industries. You
won't see these images on the Web because the files are very large
and monitors lack the color fidelity to reproduce them. Film has
more dynamic range.</p>

<p>Because you asked and since I'm the project leader, I'll go
into more detail on CinePaint here. We're not planning for CinePaint
to be the focus of our talk at FOSDEM, which is the much broader
topic of Linux in the film industry.</p>

<p>The core feature GIMP and CinePaint have in common is the clone
brush. That's a tool that copies pixels from one area to another
to retouch an image. GIMP and CinePaint, despite outward similarities,
are different internally. CinePaint has a high fidelity image
core. CinePaint handles 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit per channel HDR
(high dynamic range) images. GIMP has only an 8-bit core, but
has more features and bells-and-whistles. GIMP is typically used
on JPEG, PNG, and 8-bit TIFF images. CinePaint is typically used
on DPX, EXR, and 16-bit TIFF images (and also supports JPEG, PNG,
etc.).</p>

<p>The CinePaint project adopted software that was a forgotten
fork of GIMP. That fork was created by some GIMP developers in
1998-1999 with funding from the film industry. I was only slightly
aware of it. It wasn't until 2002, while writing an article for
Linux Journal, that I noticed Film Gimp in use at a studio. I
got a copy of the source code and played with it. When my article
came out, readers wrote asking me for the code. Then people started
sending me patches. I made the code available to everyone through
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cinepaint/">SourceForge</a>.
The GIMP clique became quite upset with me, an outsider, releasing
software they thought they'd buried in 2000 when they proposed
creating GEGL instead. Some are still angry that I'm giving away
free open source software that they wish forgotten.</p>

<p><b><i>5. Can you compare CinePaint's Glasgow architecture to
GEGL?</i></b></p>

<p>I've never been a member of the GIMP or GEGL projects, so I
can only comment on those as an outsider. The GEGL architecture
is a node-based image processing library. Its implementation details
have changed significantly since the original GEGL proposal in
2000, with each new GEGL technical lead, but the concept remains
the same. GEGL is quite different architecturally from GIMP. The
GIMP architecture is a tile-based framebuffer with executable
plug-ins that communicate over a library-based &quot;wire&quot;
protocol to manipulate frames.</p>

<p>The Glasgow architecture is an evolution of the GIMP architecture.
Glasgow takes into account several design premises that were not
true when GIMP was designed and that go beyond GIMP's mandate:</p>

<p>a.) We care about high fidelity images (more bits per pixel)
and high dynamic range images (brighter than white). We accept
the more complex core architecture necessary to deal with multiple
bit-depth images. HDR images are becoming less exotic all the
time because digital pro photography uses them now, too.<br>
</p>

<p>b.) We care about exotic features specific to the film industry
and pro photographers such as movie flipbooks, HDR, bracketed
composite images, 16-bit gallery-quality printing, CMS, Z-depth,
and exotic image types such as RAW, CMYK, and XYZ.<br>
</p>

<p>c.) We care about maintainability and debugging. The plug-in
wire protocol needs to be transparent. Rather than use variargs
(which is what GIMP uses to marshal data to plug-ins) we like
ASCII strings and direct memory access. <br>
</p>

<p>d.) We care a lot about performance. We have bigger images
to process. One 2k resolution DPX image is 12MB. A 90-minute film
has 130,000 DPX frames, a total of 1.6TB of data. We have more
to gain from running faster. One way to go faster is to load more
into memory at once. (In the nineties when GIMP was designed,
memory was precious and had to be conserved no matter what the
performance cost.) Another way to go faster is to make plug-ins
DLLs. (GIMP runs each plug-in in its own process space.)<br>
</p>

<p>e.) We care about automation and interoperability features
such as macro-recording, scripting, networked and shared-memory
operations with multiple tools.<br>
</p>

<p>f.) We care about renderfarm grid support to perform operations
on many images simultaneously in a headless environment, not just
one user modifying one image at a time in a GUI.</p>

<p><b><i>6. In a recent <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9653">article
in Linux Journal</a>, you draw a nice picture of Linux platforms
at DreamWorks Animation studio projects where Linux is used extensively
for computing power. However, from the application software point
of view, it appears that most of the Linux code is custom written
and kept proprietary. What are the reasons these companies don't
embrace open source for their applications as well?</i></b></p>

<p>First, studios no longer have to write proprietary Linux tools.
DreamWorks Animation was a Linux pioneer. Reasons for studios
to build their own tools today are the competitive advantage in
having better tools than your competitors or that you simply don't
believe others can make the best tools for your needs.</p>

<p>The studios attract the best software designer talent on the
planet. The work is very sophisticated. Open source studio application
projects don't have the resources to compete with the internal
and commercial tools that studios have. More on that under question
#8.</p>

<p>Studios have tried to support open source. CinePaint exists
because the film industry funded some GIMP development in 1998
and 1999. That GIMP never released what the film industry funded
didn't help the open source cause. If CinePaint could have been
released as GIMP 2.0 in 1999, things might be different today.</p>

<p>As the popularity of studio Linux demonstrates, Hollywood is
a Darwinian system where nothing succeeds like success. There
could be a lot of film industry open source application development
happening today if it was proven as &quot;better, faster, cheaper&quot;

than keeping a hundred expensive Linux application programmers
on staff.</p>

<p><b><i>7. Companies often want to protect their custom algorithms
and adaptations. Does this sometimes conflict with the licenses
of open-source software packages?</i></b></p>

<p>Not really. Most studio code is internal secret stuff that's
not for release. Where open source is modified only for use by
yourself, typical open source licenses don't require you give
your changes back.</p>

<p>Studios are reluctant to touch anything GPL. It's hard to justify
the legal expense of checking for GPL compliance. LGPL or BSD-licensed
is much easier because lawyers don't need to become involved in
the software development process.</p>

<p>CinePaint is the only significant instance where studios took
an open source GPL program and brought it in house to enhance
it and release it back to the open source community. The FLTK
GUI library was developed at a studio internally and released
LGPL, but that's different because it's their code. They can change
the license as they wish.</p>

<p>The one who the GPL disrupts most is me, the open source project
leader who adopted unloved GPL/LGPL code. I can't take GIMP GPL
code and move it into an LGPL library or vice versa. Where GIMP
made bad design choices which code is GPL or LGPL, I can't fix
that without rewriting the code. When I write open source code
I license it BSD.</p>

<p><b><i>8. Are you satisfied with the rate of improvement of
open source applications?</i></b></p>

<p>Are you kidding? The lack of resources in money and expert
developers is totally frustrating. It's almost impossible to get
anything done. Because I don't employ CinePaint developers I can't
really direct them. Everyone delivers what they want, when they
want. Because I have to do other things to earn a living, I can
only moonlight on CinePaint as time permits.</p>

<p>DreamWorks Animation employs over a hundred Linux programmers.
Not students. Not amateurs. Not moonlighters. A studio can and
will put a dozen professionally managed highly paid full-time
expert Linux programmers on a project. Almost no open source project
can do that.</p>

<p><b><i>9. Which are the most popular open-source applications
in the animation/cinema world?</i></b></p>

<p>CinePaint.</p>

<p><b><i>10. Can you actually see in some films with which tools
they're generated? Do filmmakers include visual or audible Easter
eggs?</i></b></p>

<p>Have you noticed there have been a lot of penguin movies lately?
;-)</p>

<p>I've heard that sometimes artists sneak tiny penguins into
the background of a scene where they don't make any sense as an
insider Linux joke, but there isn't much time for pranks. People
are working long hours to finish the film to the highest standard
they can. The goal is to make the tools transparent, to make sure
the audience doesn't look at the movie and think, that's not real.</p>
