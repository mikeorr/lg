Regarding Bessie's problem in the sept. 2002 issue of LG (Help Wanted
#1):
<A HREF="../issue82/lg_mail.html#wanted/1"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue82/lg_mail.html#wanted/1</A>
</P>
<P>
I also have one of these printers, and it has worked nicely, at least for
monochrome. I have done limited color testing - early on, it would print in
color if I selected a different printer driver at that time (bj 200 is only
capable of doing monochrome). Colors were somewhat washed out, and i never
got around to really testing things like gamma correction. Besides, that was
some time ago, before cups et al.
</P>
<P>
I sent bessie an email asking if she were using cups. There is a little
difference in the revs of cups at least with Mandrake 8.1 which is what I'm
currently running. If I use printerdrake, i am able to select a bj200 driver,
which is perfect for doing monochrome printing, and the test page prints just
fine. If i use another printer configuration tool, there is no corresponding
entry for my printer. However, selecting a similar model driver is doable if
the exact model is not listed -- and seemingly in (how?) recent cups it is
not. And seemingly, there are different printer databases. (i built cups
1.1.10 I think sometime ago from source).

Determine if the mail server is trying to perform reverse resolution for

Hello Matt and LG,
</P>
<P>
My name is David Ranch and I am the author of the IP Masquerade HOWTO
as well as the TrinityOS documentation project.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, regarding your eth0/eth1 issue, have you checked the DUPLEX
setting on the Ethernet switch?  The tell-tale signature of this
is the "carrier" transitions in your "ifconfig' output.  Since you
have a switch and not a dual-speed hub, make sure it's set to FULL
DUPLEX for that port connected to eth1.  You also might want to
force the speed on that port to 100 as well.  Ethernet auto-negotiation
has always been a problem.
</P>
<P>
If that doesn't fix things, do you have a different Ethernet card
to try?  Personally, I think all LNX* network cards are pretty crappy
though they do work.  I've had great luck with any Tulip-based network
card (Netgear FA310 [not the 311, etc]), Intel EtherExpress, etc.
</P>
<P>
Ps.  The comment from Heather at the bottom of

<A HREF="../issue82/lg_mail.html#wanted/4"

is plain wrong.  The IPMASQ code has supported ICMP MASQ since
the Linus kernel 1.2 days (possibly earlier).
</P>
<P>
--David

<blockquote><font color="#000066">In fact, I did see some references to it behaving correctly - later -
but never have figured out why it wouldn't work in real life while I was
dealing with it.  Which means that while it's surely supported, if I'm
in a situation on a 2.2.x kernel where ICMP is not working past NAT, I
have no idea how to convince it to start working.

First off, one of the posters mention that EQL is the
solution.  This is incorrect as EQL is rarely
supported any other terminal servers than possibly
older Livingston Portmaster.  Like you mentioned,
you want MultiLink PPP.

Before you start looking into setting this up,
you should call your ISP and see if they allow
ML-PPP?  Many don't and the few that do usually
only support it for ISDN users.

Hello.
</P>
<P>
My new PC running Linux has the new Intel motherboard that supports only
ACPI, not APM.  I understand from the vendor that Linux does not support
ACPI as yet.  Hence, I can't put my machine in stand-by or sleep mode.
The only solutions are to keep it running (room temperature gets high
during day time ~80 degrees) or power off.
</P>
<P>
Is Linux planning to support ACPI any time soon? Are there other
alternatives to power off? After all, one of the best advantages of Linux
is that you don't need to boot it every time you want to use the machine.
It can run for a long time without crashing.
</P>
<P>
Thanks.

Hello.
Thanks for the prompt reply. I guess the vendor knows less about Linux than I
do.  He installed RH 7.3 with kernel 2.4.18-3 on the PC, which as you say supports
ACPI. Unfortunately, it is not activated. In the directory <TT>/etc/rc.d/init.d</TT> I
can find apmd but not acpid. Do I have to reconfigure/recompile the kernel to get it
working.  I checked up all the Linux How-Tos and FAQs and can't find any information
about getting ACPI to work.

O.K. I know this is a lame one but I don't want to mess up!
</P>
<P>
My children are now of the age that they are fighting over whose turn it
is on the (old) computer - it has Windows 95 and (unfortunately) they like
some of the silly games that children love - namely Mario (no I haven't
found one to run under Linux).
</P>
<P>
So now I am under pressure to use my Linux box as a second Windows machine
to satisfy the children (no funds for even a second hand 'puter).
</P>
<P>
On my Linux box I have two hd's, one 20 GB - the main one and a second one
of 6 GB. I want to put Windows 98 on the second hd.
How do I make sure that Windows uses the second hd and not wipe out my
Linux one?
Also how do I rescue the mbr from Windows after the install? - I'm using
Mandrake 8.2 with Lilo.

Take out the Linux drive.  Make it a slave.  Install the smaller
drive (as standalone at first).  Install Win '9x.  Change the smaller
drive to be the master (if necessary) and re-install the big drive.
(Leave a small non-DOS partition near the front of it if you can).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now boot from a rescue CD or floppy specifying root=/dev/hdbX (as
appropriate) and add the appropriate entries for an "other" stanza
to your <TT>/etc/lilo.conf.</TT>  Then run <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> to install a new MBR
on the little drive.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(The MBR on the big drive will be preserved, irrelevant until it's
put back into a system as a master or standalone).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You might not need to use that small non-DOS partition that you
created --- but I'd reserve it anyway (if the Win '9x installer will
let you).  You can boot from a Linux rescue disc or diskette to run
Linux fdisk and mark the small partition as OS/2 or with some sort
of hibernation volume type --- anything but Linux, since I hear that
newer Microsoft releases with eradicate Linux partitions with extreme
prejudice

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are undoubtedly a multitude of alternative approaches.  You
could use GRUB and it's notion of "hidden" drives (to swap the
identities of the two drives during the boot process, in memory).
You might be able to install it (standalone) and then make it the
slave (LILO) but I think MS Windows would get unhappy about not having
a C drive.

If one is resigned to using sharing the system with the rogue OS, then the
above is another good reason to keep MSW straight-jacketed in an
environment such as a virtual machine where it can't do any damage to
things it has no business touching.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[JimD] 
I think John is thrying to suggest that you could use VMWare (or
Plex86 if you're daring, or <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A>) to run Win '9x as a process under
Linux.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This works pretty well --- but has a few downsides that might
apply to you're needs:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>VMWare needs lots of memory and plenty of CPU horsepower.
		   If you machine is older (less than about a 650Mhz Pentium II
		   or so) or doesn't have lots of memory (128Mb minimum, 512Mb
		   won't be wasted) then you may find this approach acceptable.


<LI>You might have relatively limited support for sound, USB
		   joysticks, etc.  You said you're kids are fighting over games
		   (IIRC) and Windows' rehosted under a virtual machine and
		   running a game is likely to be unpleasantly slow.


<LI>VMWare is pretty good as a product.  However it's not free
	 --  purchasing it will more than double your cost over buying
	 the requisite copy of Win '98.  Plex86 (FreeMWare) is free but
	 many not be up to the task of running the software you need nor
	 supporting your hardware.  It will certainly be more work (learning
	 curve) on your part.


<LI>You're kids may have to learn a little Linux/UNIX in order to get
     the VMWare (or other) virtual machine running and booted, possibly
	 switching it to full screen mode and sometimes (perhaps) get back
	 to it or out of it and back to the Linux host under various
	 possible situations.  You might make this all pretty transparent
	 (they log in via xdm/gdm/kdm etc, it starts the VM session and
	 then the just choose shutdown and they log back out).

Saw your not yet.  I am a mechanical engineer.   I run autocad daily on linux
using vmware.  (Running <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 8.0 or 7.3, AMD 1.4 with 768 Mg) Works
beautifully.  Frequently I had 10 or 15 sessions of autocad running at the
same time.   Never a problem.  Nice also when want to reload or update as
from 7.3 to 8.0 simply copy the back the windows 2000 file.  To me it is the
preferrable way to run autocad.

Hi:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
I wanted to share a little bash function I put together to check for the
status code returned by a process (typically "make").
After using IDEs which generate audio feedback after successful
compilation, I realized that this could be done by a bash function,
which I call "ok".
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
I typically run the function right after a long build like this:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>make -f Makefile ; ok
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
It then returns a pleasant note if all went well, and something less
pleasant if not.  Here is the source:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>[zorro@box84 build]$ cat /etc/profile.d/check_return_value.sh
#!/bin/sh

ok() {
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        play /usr/share/sounds/chord.au
        echo "   SUCCESS   "
    else
        play /usr/share/sounds/warning.wav
        echo "   *ERROR*   "
    fi
}
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Works every time (so far).

You could also use "<tt>xf86cfg</tt>" if you like graphical tools. I've found

Ben presumes you use <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>.  If you use RedHat, you'd want

On older distros there was a TCL/tk app called "<tt>XF86Setup</tt>" but it does
nothing to help guess your video card or monitor characteristics.  If
you need this, a brief glance at the results of "<tt>lspci</tt>" is worth your
while, and check your notes about what the maximum resolution is for your
monitor, <EM>before</EM> you run the app.  It's not very happy when you switch
away from its task and back again.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The XF86Setup program, at least, has keyboard commands for everything,
so it will work that way until you finally pick the right mouse protocol
and can start clicking on things.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you're afraid of jumping to graphical mode until you've got something
like a useful config file created, "<tt>xf86config</tt>" is a totally text mode
program, which asks you questions from the database of X gadgetry.
But do make sure that it creates an XFree86 version 4.x file, and not a
version 3.x file ... they are very different.  The section
"ServerLayout" mentioned above didn't exist in version 3.

<P>
I've got <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> 3.0 almost set up to my liking, but one thing I can't get to
work is diald.
</P>
<P>
I installed Debian from scratch and pppd configuration was quite easy. "pon
ntlworld" works, similarly kppp only required me to change auth to noauth in
ppp.options and it worked. Diald OTOH has me puzzled.
</P>
<P>
Debian 3.0 has a completely new diald configuration. All the stuff that used
to appear in <TT>/etc/diald</TT> has gone. The only configuration file it uses seems
to be in <TT>/var/cache.</TT>
</P>
<P>
"ps aux" shows that diald starts up OK.  "route" shows that it has set up sl0
as the default interface, but when I try to access anything on the internet I
get an immediate DNS lookup failure. There are none of the usual messages in
<TT>/var/log/messages</TT> indicating that it's trying to dial out and do a DNS lookup.
</P>
<P>
What have I tried?
</P>

<blockQuote><ul>
<LI>I've reconfigured it half a dozen times.

<LI>I've tried "grep diald /var/log/*"

<LI>I've copied my old /etc/diald from potato and selected "old-config" in
"dpkg-reconfigure diald".

<LI>I've copied the dialup rules from old standard.filters into /etc/diald.options

<LI>I've read everything I could find about the new configuration in
/usr/share/doc/diald

<LI>I've google searched for "debian woody diald problem"

<LI>I've searched the debian-user archives
</ul></blockQuote>
<P>
Now I'm stumped. I could throw away the new <TT>/etc/init.d/diald</TT> script and
import the old one potato, together with all the rest of the configuration
for potato, but even if that works, I would prefer not to rely on an
"obsolete" configuration.

<P><STRONG>
HalloMy name is Debojit Acharya and i am from india. It will be highly
apperciated if you kindly answer the questions furnished below :-1. I
have a 10 GB hard disk with Win 98 installed on it. Now i want to Install
Win XP and <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> Linux 7.2 on to a new 80 GB hard drive.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I have seen this succeed;  it depends a little bit on whether your BIOS
likes such large drives, but once you can get the OS' to see them they
deal with the rest of the details pretty well.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I want to have
multibooting feature with Win 98 (on the old 10GB HDD), Win XP and Linux
(on the new 80 GB HDD) as OSs.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I don't know if mswin will let you boot XP from a second drive.
</P>
<P>
The easiest way by far for Linux, would be to have <TT>LOADLIN.EXE</TT> and a copy
of your favored linux kernel sitting on the old win98 C: ... then just
offer Linux as one of the mswin boot menu choices.
</P>
<P>
A floppy would work (for Linux at least;  possibly for winxp but don't
believe <EM>me</EM> ... check their knowledgebase).
</P>
<P><STRONG>
How to go about it? 2. I had Mandrake Linux 8.2 installed on one of
old HDD's partitions. Later i had tried to delete the partition by
booting from the Mandrake bootable CD. Though the partition got
deleted but had not been uninstalled properly because even now,
at the system startup screen, the default OS is shown as Linux with
Win 98 as the second choice. But after logging into Linux it gets
hanged.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
You still have the old LILO master boot record from the time when you
had Mandrake on <TT>/dev/hda</TT>, however since Mandrake itself ... or more
correctly speaking, that kernel ... is no longer there, the menu option
goes to an explicit location on disk -- which no longer has a kernel!
</P>
<P>
If you store at least one Linux kernel on your <TT>/dev/hda</TT> drive -- for
example, in C:\LINUX -- then you will be able to install a fresh LILO
boot record which points at it, and knows about you wanting to mount
a <TT>/dev/hdbN</TT> partition as your root volume when you select Linux.  You
must re-run <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT>, after editing <TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> to meet your
new setup.   Unfortunately, the kernel and bootloader really do have
to be on the same disk.
</P>
<P>
If you switch to GRUB a different story follows, but it's still probably
a good idea to keep a kernel on your first hard drive.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Pls help me get out of this.
<br>Thanks. Bye,Debojit.
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>
Hello Answers Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there a way to recompile the kernel so as to get
the X11 keymap in the console?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
See
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>linux/drivers/char/defkeymap.c
<br>linux/drivers/char/consolemap.c
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
paying special attention to the comments at the beginning of
defkeymap.c
</P>
<P>
However, it is not necessary to recompile the kernel.  Your
initialization scripts (in <TT>/etc/rc.d</TT>, <TT>/etc/rc.d/init.d</TT>, or <TT>/etc/init.d</TT>
depending on your distribution) very likely have a call to "loadkeys"
someplace in them.  This loads a keymap at boot time.  If not, you can
easily add such.  See
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>man loadkeys
</font></code></blockquote>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Take a look at the LANG variable. It's somewhat odd (e.g., the default
value for English is 'C' (???))
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
I think the default <EM>value</EM> is 'C' and if you have a basically English
distro that's the language you'll, ahem, C.  You can specify one or
another of the English variants but I've seen it cause some things to
act weird - I assume the exact same weirdness they'd offer if I picked
an international variant they dunno how to handle.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
...but mostly it follows the ISO3166
standard for naming, e.g. "de", "fr", "kr", etc. It's also far from
certain that everyone will have it set on their system. For example, I
read a lot of Russian stuff, but leave my LANG at the default setting
and execute specific programs with a local LANG definition:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>LANG=ru_RU rxvt -n Muttley -e mutt -y

In my opinion, though, LANG is as close as you'll come to what you're
looking for as is possible in the wild wooly world of Unix.
