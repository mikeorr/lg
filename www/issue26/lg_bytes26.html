Washington, DC Linux Users Group InstallFest 
</H3> 
<p>
1 Feb 1998 <BR> 
On March 28, 1998, the Washington DC area Linux User Group (DC LUG)
will have its next Linux Installation Fest. Volunteer experts from
several local Linux user groups will assist computer users interested
in trying out Linux, the operating system that Byte Magazine, Wired,
PC Magazine and other industry publications agree is a significant
software phenomenon. Bring your PC and leave with Linux co-installed,
or just visit the demo room to see what Linux is all about.
<p>
Started as an exercise in Internet-based collaboration among hundreds
of software developers around the globe, Linux has acquired a
reputation for superior power and robustness, along with a
relentless pace of improvements, a combination rarely matched by the
mainstream software Unix and Windows NT industry.
<p>
Linux has attracted an estimated 3 to 15 million users, and also 
garnered commercial support, evidenced by several shrinkwrap vendors
with shelf space in mass-market computer stores. Even though in
most cases an installation of Linux is a simple procedure, DC LUG
will help those who may have unusual configurations or simply
some trepidations about jumping in. Representatives from RedHat
Software, one of Linux vendors, will also attend and provide advice.
<p>
The InstallFest will be held at the Uniformed Services University of
the Health Sciences, the medical school at the Bethesda Naval Medical
complex, just inside the Beltway between Wisconsin and Connecticut
Avenues.
<p>
Doors open at 10 AM through 4 PM, Saturday 28 March 1998. See
http://www.tux.org/fest for details and a requested pre-registration
form.

Linux receives the Softwarove noviny "Product of the year" award
</H3> 
<p>
1 Feb 1998 <BR> 

Date: Mon,  9 Feb 1998 13:53:30 GMT
<p>
The Czech computer monthly "Softwarove noviny" awarded the Linux 2.0 
operating system with its award "Product of the Year 1997". This award 
is regularly (for the sixth time this year) assigned to the best 
computer products available on the Czech market without any other 
limitation. The "Product of the Year" award is strictly non-commercial, 
no fee is paid and no application is put in. Among the criteria is 
technical excellence, amount of innovation, price / performance ratio 
as well as the amount of value added by the domestic vendor. The award 
was granted to 18 products for the past year, among them two operating 
systems.
<p>
Softwarove noviny (www.softnov.cz) is a prestigious Czech computer monthly.
Its name (with meaning Software News) is rather traditional than descriptive: 
actually it is a generally oriented computer magazine that focuses on 
software as well as hardware, networking and other aspects of IT 
market. It is published in Czech language and distributed in both Czech 
and Slovak Republics. The Softwarove noviny reader?s group includes 
professional IT users, entrepreneurs and managers. The Softwarove 
noviny is the only Czech computer monthly prepared entirely from 
domestic sources without translated articles from American or German 
industry press. Softwarove noviny magazine publishes now 16,000 copies 
(total population of Czech Republic is 10 million), 85 % of which are 
paid (1/3 by subscribers). About 40 % of the magazine are occupied by 
advertisements of both Czech and worldwide IT companies. According the 
independent surveys from November 1996, the Softwarov&eacute; noviny magazine 
is the most known IT magazine in the Czech Republic.
<p>
The WWW page of Softwarove noviny is available at http://www.softnov.cz/.
The Czech Linux Users' Group has its WWW page at http://www.linux.cz/czlug/.

WANTED: Project LEAP: Linux-Equipped Astronauts Project
</H3> 
<p>
1 Feb 1998 <BR> 
<p>
17 Feb 1998<BR> 
Recent articles on the International Space Station (ISS) have
mentioned that astronauts will be issued laptop computers running
MSWin95.  Other reports have predicted disastrous trouble with
the station control software, because of poor engineering practices
and unrealistic schedules.
<p>
This situation creates a real opportunity for Linux.  While we
(probably) can't help with the main station software, at least
the astronauts can be freed from Win95 crashes.  Imagine the sound
bites: "At least our laptops don't crash all the time."
<p>
PEAL is a project to port the applications that the astronauts use
to run under Linux, so each astronaut has a choice of operating
systems.  Many of them will continue using MSWin95, for a time, but
if any astronaut chooses Linux, the others will begin to pick it up,
just as happens on the ground.
<p>
Anyone who wants to take over the
web page, design a project logo, set up a mail reflector, create a 
newsgroup, become group leader, or (almost forgot :-) port software, 
please write.  We need to know what codes the astronauts need ported, 
and where the sources are.  The project web page, for now, is:

1 Feb 1998 <BR> 
<p>
Fri, 20 Feb 1998 08:42:53 GMT<BR> 
Some discussion about the possibility of a freeware 'GNU' BIOS
was casually mentioned on the Linux kernel mailing list last week.
Talk about it escalated, and a mailing list was quickly formed. 
After a few more days of ideas, it seems like a very good possibility
and some people just hell bent on getting started.
<p>
What we are looking for now are people with a high degree of knowledge
about the low-level workings of the x86 PC architecture, and real mode 
programming experience. Please join the mailing list and offer what help
you can.
<p>
Also understand that many Linux people are involved with this, but the
purpose is a COMPLETE BIOS replacement for use with all Intel x86 OS's,
not just some new boot loader.
<p>
To subscribe to the OpenBIOS Mailing list, write an email
        To: openbios-request@linkscape.net
        Subject [leave blank!]

1 Feb 1998 <BR> 
John McNulty wrote:
I'm sure after Netscape's source code announcement, a number of 
people (like me) must have wondered about the possibility of a
port to KDE and/or Qt.  So I asked one of the Netscape engineers
for an opinion on this.  Below is the answer I got.
<blockquote> <ul>
<li>The GUI frontend is clearly seperated from the rest of the browser
by a well defined API (which all 3 frontends - MFC, Mac, Motif -
use).
<li>There are about 50 widgets ( ls *.c | wc -l) that are Netscape
specific, which'll have to be ported.
<li>The GUI itself is composed of around 160 C++ files, which
instantiate these widgets.
</ul>
Depending on the number of people working on it, it could take
anywhere between 2 months to an year. Of course, stripped down
versions are possible in a shorter period of time.

So if anyone put there is thinking about this, you can use
this as a guideline to figure out how much work is involved.

EDA Software: Linux VHDL Simulator Sells Via Web
</H3>
<p>
9 Feb 1998<BR> 
	Essex Junction, Vt. -- Despite considerable user interest, very
	few Linux-based EDA tools have become available.  One of the
	first is a new Linux version of the Green Mountain Computing
	Systems VHDL compiler, available for $169 via the World Wide
	Web.
<p>
	Green Mountain currently offers a DOS-based VHDL simulator, and
	Accolade Design Automation (Duvall, Wash.) sells a Windows-based
	version of the same simulator.  The new version 2 of the Green
	Mountain VHDL compiler supports most, but not all, of the
	features of IEEE 1076-87 and 1993 VHDL.
<p>
	The Linux version is a port of the DOS version and includes all
	the same features, except for the user interface.  Both versions
	come with two simulation environments for batch or interactive
	simulation, precompiled IEEE packages, an online VHDL tutorial,
	a Motorola HC11 microcontroller example model and free technical
	support via e-mail.
<p>
	Scott Thibault, president of Green Mountain Computing Systems,
	said he developed the Linux version because that freely
	distributed operating system is becoming more important in
	universities, which have made up Green Mountain's primary
	market.  He said the Linux version is slightly slower than the
	DOS version because of its support for multitasking.
<p>
	Linux has gained a following because it's viewed as a stable,
	robust operating system that gives PCs full Unix compatibility.
	Thus, commonly used Unix utilities such as "make" are available.
	Linux also has minimal memory requirements.  The Green Mountain
	Linux VHDL compiler can run in about 8 Mbytes of RAM.
	The simulator can be ordered only by mail or over the Internet.

Olicom Linux Token-Ring driver released
</H3>
<P> 
6 Feb 1998<BR> 
Olicom is pleased to announce the release of a Linux Driver for
Olicom's high performance Token-Ring Adapters OC-3118 and OC-3137. The
driver is also compatible with the older OC-3136 adapter.
The combination of Olicom's Token-Ring adapters and new Linux drivers
provide superior performance in a Linux Token-Ring environment.
<p>
The driver has been tested with the (currently) latest version of the
2.0 kernel, 2.0.33. It will probably work with any 2.0 kernel,
i.e. all of the kernels used by the Linux distributions, but this has
not been tested and can not be guaranteed.
 <p>
For the current development versions of Linux 2.1 the driver has been
tested with version 2.1.78. Changes to the development kernel are
occurring in rapid pace and compatibility can not be guaranteed.
<p>
The Olicom Linux driver is available from Olicom's WEB site
http://www.olicom.dk/ (Europe) or http://www.olicom.com/ (US).
<p>
Pre-compiled kernels with the driver builtin - based on Linux 2.0.33 -
for RedHat 4.2, RedHat 5.0 and other systems using the Linux
2.0.x kernel, are available from

<p>
6 Feb 1998 <BR> 
Release 2.0 of the GNU plotting utilities is now available at
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/plotutils-2.0.tar.gz .  It should soon be
available via ftp from the GNU mirror sites.  A list of mirror sites is
appended below; please try them before you try ftp.gnu.org.
<p>
This is a major release.  The centerpiece of the package is now `libplot',
a function library for 2-D device-independent graphics.  Libplot is
installed as a DLL (dynamically linked library), on systems that support
DLL's.  Libplot now supports Hewlett-Packard Graphics Language (HP-GL and
HP-GL/2) output, in addition to Postscript, xfig, Tektronix, and X11 output.
So HP LaserJet and other PCL 5 printers are now supported.
<p>
The manual for the plotting utilities is now over 100 pages long.  To
install and print the documentation, be sure that you have the current
release of the GNU texinfo package (v. 3.11) installed on your system.
You may retrieve it from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/texinfo-3.11.tar.gz .

The developpment platform is Linux 2.0.32 with glibc libraries as there
are provided with RedHat 5.0. Porting angela! to other systems should not
be difficult as it uses these Programs:
<ul>
<li>Standard C compiler (no C++ code at this time)
<li>CWEB Version 3.4
<li>Tcl/Tk Version 8.0p2
<li>Tix 4.1
</ul>
For binary distributions, only Tcl/Tk Version 8.0p2 and Tix 4.1 are
necessary. Contact your system administrator to help you installing these
tools (also used by other programs, so the disk space is not wasted ;) )

<p>
The program tsinvest is for quantitative financial analysis of equity
values.  An optimal portfolio investment strategy for multiple
equities is computed. The program decides which of all available
equities to invest in at any single time, by calculating the
instantaneous future value of all equities, and using statistical
estimation techniques to estimate the accuracy of the calculated
values. Entropic techniques are used throughout. A tutorial is
presented in the man(1) pages. A companion equity market simulation
program is included.

leap 1.1.9 - A free RDBMS
</H3>
<p>
20 Feb 1998<BR> 
<p>
LEAP is a free RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) that has
been used as an educational tool in Universities around the world to aid
students as they learn database theory. It allows relational algebra
expressions to be entered directly into the system, and the results to
be queried. It supports relational closure, so complete expressions can
be deeply nested. Examples are included from popular database texts,
including C.J.Date's "An introduction to database systems".
<p>
LEAP is entirely free (it is distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License), and is very easy to install. All distributions
contain the full 'C' source code. Versions exist for all Unix
implementations, and Windoze 95/3.1/NT. Full documentation is included
in the distribution, and is available on the web.  LEAP is in active
development (on a Linux 2.0 slackware system) by the author.
<p>
Full details, including links to the main ftp archives, are available on
the LEAP web page:

Strictly speaking LEAP 1.1.9 is BETA software, but extensive testing has
shown no major problems.
