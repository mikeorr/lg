Hello all --
</p>

<p>
This question is purely to test the water.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">  I remember a good few
years ago now using a Sun workstation running some old version of
SunOS.  One thing I remember about it clearly though is that it had a
<strong>cool</strong> keyboard with a whole set of keys down the far left-hand side
[1].
</p>

<p>
So I was wondering...
</p>

<p>
a)  Is this keyboard standard?  For instance, if I go looking for a
"sun keyboard", I'm not going to encounter several different versions
which work subtly different from one another, am I?
</p>

<p>
b) I've heard various rumours I'd need a sun &lt;--&gt; PC converter to use
such a keyboard?  Some websites say you need one, others don't even
mention it.  Some even say you build one, but I don't like the thought
of this -- I'm a software engineer for a reason; I hate hardware.
</p>

<p>
Using it under Linux (X11 specifically) wouldn't be much of a problem.
 I hope... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I do a lot of teaching for Sun, so I get to see those things all the
time. You are the only person I've ever heard of who has actually
expressed a liking for one - they are universally hated and cursed at by
all and sundry, since the key layout differs just slightly from the
standard PC variety. Although I suppose that there has to be a group (a
sizeable one, too) of fans somewhere: Sun has been making these
keyboards for years and years now, and is usually pretty responsive to
their customers' needs.
</p>

<p>
To answer your question, all the SPARC keyboards that I've seen in the
last seven or so years have indeed had the same layout - but there are
several different varieties (e.g., 4, 5, 5C, 6, 7, etc.) However, given
your stated purpose, the answer is easy: buy one of the new (type 7) USB
keyboards - which work with both SPARCs and PCs. Sample listing on eBay:

It won't, once you get used to the odd layout (hint: watch out - it's
<strong>way</strong> too easy to hit 'Ctrl-S' on one of these. If your machine suddenly
"locks up", try 'Ctrl-Q' before rebooting) and learn to readjust every
time you're at a regular PC. Do note, however, that most of those "cool
keys" on the left won't be of any earthly use to you whatsoever:
'Stop-A', for example, will not cause your PC to drop into the PROM or
display 'ok' as a prompt. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Surely, it should be possible to use a suitable "keymap" under Linux
to get the console to respond in <strong>some</strong> way to these keys. Getting
the PROM display "would be a neat trick". (Quoting from adventure.[*])

<p>
I thought the question was about how one connects this keyboard to
a standard PC's board. Some of the SUN keybds that I have seen plug
into the "ps2" socket of a PC just fine --- YMMV.

Sure - but what would be the point? There would still be a problem of
readjusting to "normal" keyboards - now even more complicated because
there would be all those "missing" functions - and the question of
figuring out what else a keyboard should do, complicated by the fact
that people who design keyboards are professionals who do that exact
thing - and they haven't managed to come up with anything else that's
universally useful. The Sun keyboard has the extra keys *because SPARC
machines have those extra functions that PCs don't.* Adding a polished
gold faucet and a diamond-encrusted soap dish to a car doesn't make it
into a bathtub - it just wastes money, time, and effort.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Getting
&gt; the PROM display "would be a neat trick". (Quoting from adventure.[*])

<p>
Heh; I remember that. I'm even somewhat nostalgic for those early
efforts to give games (and computers overall) a personality; it was very
cool back then, and great fun. On the other hand, it <strong>did</strong> result in
Micr0s0ft Bob and the dancing paperclip... I suppose anything can be
taken too far. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Some PCs - and I don't recall which ones, but it was one of the big
names - used to have a key combination you could hit, while the machine
was running, that allowed you to access the BIOS.  Sure, the changes
wouldn't do anything until you rebooted - but it was a nice capability.
On <em>those</em> machines, I could see tying 'Stop-A' to that function - but
my point is that you only need the extra keys if you have the extra
functionality.
</p>

<p>
Besides all that, we already have:
</p>

<p>
A. Bash aliases
</p>

<p>
B. Bash functions
</p>

<p>
C. Bash macros - i.e. the "C-x-(", "C-x-)", and "C-x-e" kit
</p>

<p>
and even
</p>

<p>
D. "~/.inputrc" for keyboard macros 
</p>

</pre>

<p>
I took "connect" to mean both the physical matching and a requirement
that the machine recognize it as a keyboard, and my recommendation for
USB connectors and the ability to switch between SPARC and PC addressed
both. IIRC, most Sun keyboards come with a 6-pin "mini-DIN" connector -
a.k.a. PS/2. I don't know that just plugging one into a PC is going to
work, but I don't think it would fry anything.

Anyone care to point me to a good tutorial?  Binding CTRL-ALT_F1 
to say apt-get upgrade for example might come in handy if I 
remember there is a keyboard shortcut... ;)

Search for 'Readline Initialization'. There's not much to it.

I've seen Sun keyboards described with "type 5" and "type 4" which is a

Hm, I remember seeing a keyboard driver for Sun keyboards appearing in
the Linux kernel configuration a while ago (CONFIG_KEYBOARD_SUNKBD in
.config). It seems others like the keyboard as well. I haven't seen some
for quite some while now.
</p>

<p>
You may have seen this site, but I found a reference for keyboard
adapters.

Provided the keyboard layout is properly configured to use it. I've
debugged some annoying typos in XFree and xorg config files (there is
a difference between "pc104" and "pc105" when using "de" keyboard
layout, or assuming to use it).

[laugh] I quote: "As I recall, the 'compose' key exists for exactly that

also heard about "dead keys" - they're supposed to have something to do

<p>
Again, as I understand it, you can enable them on any keyboard - I seem
to recall that left-meta is used as 'compose' if the keyboard is set up
as 'pc105'. At this point, I'm into "remembering stuff without
understanding any of it" territory though.
