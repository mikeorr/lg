No doubt you mean "rhubarb".
I cut off the leaves, wash in cold water, slice, and parblanch it, if
freezing for later use.
From my childhood in Michigan, I learned that tender young stems
are a nice snack fresh, washed and dipped in sugar.

<P> Yum. Wonder if I can find any rhubarb pie for lunch... :) Cleaning it 
is pretty much like cleaning celery, nothing special; cooking is as per 
any of the above recipes, depending on what you want to make.

Either the leaves or the stems are poisonous, so you shouldn't eat
whichever one is the poisonous part. And whatever you do, don't eat the
top part of the stem where it meets the leaves -- no matter which part
of the plant is poisonous, there will be some poison where they meet. At
least if you pick leaves or stems you have a 50/50 chance.

<P> And how do you "parblanch"? There's no definition of that term in the
Rhubarb-HOWTO.

<P> I don't think rhubarb is ready for the desktop yet, at least until 
you techie type people straighten out the poison issue and make it
parblanch itself.

<P> Don, the GNU version of rhubarb is due out in just a few days; not only
does it parblanch itself, it will also frizz, wargle, blatter, *and*
mangulate everyone and everything in a 7,000-mile radius. Instead of 
just a small part of it being poisonous, the entire plant consists of 
pure potassium cyanide, thus saving you time, money and effort. Not only
_that,_ but it also comes with an attractive set of Ginsu knives, and -
if you order within the next thirty minutes - our combination orange
peeler, toilet disassembler, Fortran debugger, and spaceship detector.
Best of all, the source code is included.

<P> Just say "no" to all those proprietary commercial versions of rhubarb!
Open Source rules!

Say, can you just send me the source to that combination orange peeler,
toilet disassembler, fortran debugger, and spaceship detector?  I want
to compile a local version that detects orange spaceships, and peels them
if they have buggy Fortran code installed.

&lt;laugh&gt; That "folk song to the tune of" 'Those Were the Days' is the

How did "Dear Longs" (whatever that means) get translated as
"Those Were the Days"?  Is it a reference to the 24-hour summer days
in St Pete?

</STRONG></P>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

Wrong accent. "do-ro-GOI" would be "dear"; "do-RO-goi" is "&lt;along the&gt; 
road". It's "[Along|By] the Long Road", and Raskin managed (very well, 
too) to keep the sense of the song... if not the traditionally morbid 
/fin-de-siecle/ ending.

I just remembered there are two "Those Were the Days" songs in English.
One has the same tune as the Russian song and starts off, "Those were the
days, my friend.  We don't know where nor when..."

Those were the days, my friend,

We'd sing and dance forever and a day.
We'd live the life we'd choose,

Then there's the
"All in the Family" theme that goes something like, "When girls were girls
and men were men."  Perhaps the two songs are related, but they sound
awfully different.

[who?] wrote and Miller played,
Songs that made the Hit Parade.
Guys like us we had it made,
Those were the days.

And you knew when you were then,
Girls were girls and men were men.
Mister, we could use a man like
Herbert Hoover again.

Didn't need no welfare state,
Everybody pulls his weight.
[umty umty umty...]
Those were the days.

<P> I think the second was inspired by the first, but as Mike says
the tunes are completely different.
