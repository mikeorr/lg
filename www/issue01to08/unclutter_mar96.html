Have you ever noticed when editing text that as soon as you release the mouse

and start typing, the cursor ends up obscuring a letter you'd like to see? 
I'd 
always classified this as one of those minor unavoidable annoyances of life, 
like TV commercials or hangnails, which shouldn't be dwelled upon.<P>So why I

am I writing this?  Because a programmer named <A 
HREF="mailto:mmm@cetia.fr">Mark
M. Martin</A> evidently had had enough of mouse cursors outstaying their 
welcome.  He wrote a tiny memory resident program, most conveniently started 
from the xinitrc file, which initially does nothing but wait. It patiently 
waits for your mouse cursor to stay still for a configurable number of
seconds;
when this occurs the program simply makes the cursor transparent until you
move
it again.<P>The down side of this is that once you become accustomed to this 
behavior, any time you might be working at a computer which doesn't have 
unclutter installed, or happen to be using DOS or OS/2, you really notice
that 
cursor.  Unclutter becomes sort of a positive reinforcement for using Linux!

Unclutter is probably on every Linux ftp site, but you have to watch out for
an
older version which may not work on current systems.  This is version 1,
dated 
1992.  Version 2, released in 1994, compiles cleanly, and I've never had any 
trouble with it. It's a small download; just grab anything called
unclutter.tgz 
and unpack it to see if it's the right one.
<P>
