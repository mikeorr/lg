<H3>Example Styles using XCalendar</H3>

<P>
Below are some examples of what an application window might look like if you
altered the <B>Style</B> entry for that application.  You'll find a full
discussion of the various Style options back at the LG main page.  These are
included to give you an idea of what things look like on the system that I'm 
using.

I've used the very nice little program <B>xcalendar</B> as an example and
simply altered the styles entry for this app.  For those of you who might be
interested, these images were created using <B>xwd, convert (part of
the ImageMagick suite of graphics programs), and xpaint</B>.

<P>
<B>Beneath each screen dump is a Styles entry that produced the particular
style.</B>

<EM>Style xcalendar		Title, HandleWidth 6</EM>
<P>
This is the default on my system:  each window is given a titlebar which contains
the window name and the titlebar buttons; handles, which allow resizing of the
application window; and a borderwidth of 6 pixels.  You'll notice that since I'm
using <EM>handles</EM> that I set the width of the frame using the <EM>HandleWidth
</EM> option.
<P>

<IMG SRC="./gx/xcal_2_crop.gif">
<P>
<EM>Style xcalendar		Title, HandleWidth 0</EM>
<P>
Setting the <EM>HandleWidth</EM> option to zero causes the border to disappear
completely.  If you use this setting, you may want to set the size of the 
application window on the command line using the &quot;-geometry&quot; option since
you will not be able to resize the window because the handles are no longer visible.
<P>
<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="./gx/xcal_3_crop.gif">
<P>
<EM>Style xcalendar		Title, HandleWidth 10</EM>
<P>
If you're really into nice, sturdy borders, then this is the option for you!  Setting
the <EM>HandleWidth</EM> to 10, as in this case, gives you plenty of screen real
estate to manipulate those handles.
<P>
<BR><BR>


<IMG SRC="./gx/xcal_4_crop.gif">
<P>
<EM>Style xcalendar		Title, NoHandles, BorderWidth 6</EM>
<P>
In this case, using the <EM>NoHandles</EM> option disables the handles on the
window frame.  Once again, if you use this setting you will not be able to resize
the window, so your best use of this is to set the size of the application on the
command line or in a menu setting.  This style works well for apps, such as the
calendar pictured here, that you load up when you start X and leave alone.  Also
note that this is a case where you'd use the <EM>BorderWidth</EM> option instead
of the <EM>HandleWidth</EM> option since you are using only a border and not a
border + handles.
<P>
<BR><BR>


<IMG SRC="./gx/xcal_5_crop.gif">
<P>
<EM>Style xcalendar		NoTitle, NoHandles, BorderWidth 6</EM>
<P>
We're starting to get a bit <EM>minimalistic</EM> here... This style produces a
window with no titlebar, titlebar buttons, or resize handles.  Leaving a border
around it does, however, make the application window easy to move.
<P>
<BR><BR>


<IMG SRC="./gx/xcal_6_crop.gif">
<P>
<EM>Style xcalendar		NoTitle, HandleWidth 0</EM>
<P>
This is about as bare-bones as you can get.  With this style you can completely
strip away all window decorations leaving only the window itself.  Performing any
kind of window operations such as move, resize, or close is a bit difficult and
so you'll probably rarely use this except for apps such as an <B>xclock</B> or
possibly an <B>xbiff</B> type window.
