Barb, your question does not appear to have anything to do with Linux;
worse yet, it's essentially meaningless, much like asking "will I be
able to play the piano if I've had hand surgery?" The answer depends on
too many variables to be answered (e.g., whether you were able to play
<em>before</em> the procedure, the state of your hands after the surgery, as
well as - surprise! - whether or not you get run over by a truck before
you can get to a piano.)
</p>

<p>
Just to demonstrate one or two of the possibilities - what do you mean
by [sic] "download a entire web site"? There's a tremendous amount of
difference based on whether you're the owner or just a user of the
website, and what sort of permissions you have for downloading the files
that it consists of; in the latter case, for example, you won't be able
to download any of the CGI scripts, whereas in the former case, you
will. Based on <em>that,</em> you either will or will not be able to execute
the programs that operate some portion (or all) of the site - assuming
that the site has any CGI programs.
</p>

<p>
In short, you need to rephrase your question (I strongly suggest reading
"Asking Questions of The Answer Gang" at
<a href="../../../tag/ask-the-gang.html">http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</a>, which should help with
the formulation as well as general info on getting your questions
answered), and you need to tell us what it has to do with Linux - since
that's the kind of questions we generally answer here.
