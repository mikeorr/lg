It was sometime during the week of Oct 4th. The day was sunny, bright,
the sky a piercing light blue. I was walking north along Bell Avenue in
Brookhaven National Laboratory on my way to the bank. I had just
finished lunch and was savoring the walk. It was quiet, peaceful. The
first sunny, crisp days of fall had arrived.  The peacefulness
surrounding me was so impressive.  It had been 4 months since I've been
able to enjoy such a quiet moment.

<p>

"What do you mean there are a busload of people wandering lost around
the RHIC ring!" I replied to one of the organizers after being
interrupted from fidgeting with that damn PC projector. "That's what
I've been told, and <b>YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!</b>" she replied. I
ran out to the lobby in a frantic disposition. One of my PHENIX
collaborators was walking around looking at the vendor
exhibits. "Please John, go out and find those wandering conference
attendees and give them a tour of the PHENIX detector!" He looked a
bit puzzled as I explained the situation to him, but was off in a rush
after he understood what was going on.

That was October 2nd, the day of the Open Source/Open Science
conference. The whole day was a series of crises. The first crisis
started that morning when we fired up the projector which was hooked
up to the PC running Linux. The projected image jittered in such a way
as to give me a rather nasty headache. "This will not do!" I
exclaimed. Malcolm, one of the organizers swore again and again that
it was working great the night before. "Hooking up a another laptop or
PC is no easy feat" he warned me. It takes a good 20 minutes to figure
out the settings on the projector so that it will sync properly with
the video output. What to do - what to do. I had 15 minutes before the
conference started, and the only working PC/projector setup was
running Windows NT. What an embarrassment for an Open Source/Open
Science conference. I was not going to do my introductory talk with
the NT desktop brightly displayed behind me, as I used IE to down load
my presentation. I had my laptop setup on a table on the auditorium
stage from where I was going to run the conference. My intent was to
monitor the inbox of the osos account on that laptop, to which people
were to send their e-mail with questions I was to ask the speakers. I
took down my laptop, set it up next to the projector, plugged in the
video cable and pressed <em>fn</em>-<em>crt</em> which in theory
should enable the video output on my laptop. Nothing. A big blue box
shown on the screen with a clear message reading "No video sync." The
conference was to start in 10 minutes. I quickly booted my laptop into
windows 98, and back into Linux. The video projector came alive and
projected my GNOME desktop after logging into my account. 5 minutes to
go and I had a working Linux desktop environment projected onto the
screen for the audience to see and from which I would present the
introductory talk. Wheeewww. Crisis #48 averted....

The idea for this conference was begot back in early June after a
lunch I had with Sean McCorkle. As we walked out of the cafeteria,
Sean suggested that we put on an Open Source conference. This was the
same idea I had in the back of my head for a long time now. "I would
be glad to dedicate time for an Open Source conference," Sean told
me. He said it with a zealot's enthusiasm whence I knew he meant what he
said. With that bit of encouragement, I told him that we should
"explore" the idea further.

<p>

A couple of days later, Malcolm Capel, a big Linux user doing
structural biology work at the Light Source, Tim Sailer, a big Linux
(Debian) developer, who was working for the RHIC computing facility at
the time, Sean McCorkle, who does database work for the Human Genome
project and myself, who spends much too much time on these silly
write-ups, gathered during lunch to push forward this idea of
organizing an Open Source conference at the Lab.

"Let's get Maddog." "How about Bob Young." "Yea, IBM just released
its data visualization software under an Open Source copyright
license. Let's get them." "SGI has a bunch of Open Source projects,
XFS etc." "Hey, Lincoln Stein wrote the CGI perl module. He works at Cold
Spring Harbor Lab, that's right here on Long Island. He'd be a great
speaker!" And so the meeting went. By  the time lunch was over I asked
the question, "So will it be worth having an Open
Source conference?" The consensus was yes, its worth the time
and effort. I can't remember who, but someone said that working on a
conference takes up all your time. This was in reference to a
conference which was recently held at BNL where 300 people came for a
week to talk about small angle scattering experiments at the Light
Source. The head organizer spent <em>all</em> his time working on the
conference. We blew that fact off. "It's only a one day conference."
(That phrase would be uttered many times between then and Oct. 2nd.)
"How much time could it possibly take?!" It was going to be a bunch of guys
from BNL plus a couple of outside speakers. "What's the big deal!"

This brainstorming session stirred my blood for some action.  I
fired off an e-mail to Bob Young, Maddog, and Richard Stallman. I had
met each one of them from previous meetings I strayed to earlier this
year. The e-mail outlined the idea for the conference and asked for
feedback. "Is this a good idea or not?" Bob replied within several
hours. He thought it was a good idea. Maddog got back a couple of days
later. He also thought it was a good idea. I didn't hear back from
Richard for a couple of months. (Some e-mail glitch was at fault and
the outcome turns out to be a whole 'nother chapter.)

<p>

With that positive feedback from Bob and Maddog, I asked to meet with
Mike Murtagh, the chair of the physics department. "It's a software
conference." I told him. "We spend too much of our time on software
not to talk about it." I told him about IBM and SGI and their software
work and about how our software affects our science work and how
people may be interested in what we do, etc. Mike was warming up to the
idea and it wasn't until about 45 minutes into this discussion that I
spoke the words "Open Source" and "Free Software." When I did, Mike
uttered a long "Ooohhh, that's what this is all about" with his
signature Irish accent. He had visions of people dressed in tie-dyed
tee shirts, purple colored rim sun glasses, and flower sack dresses
forming a "Free Software" commune on site during the
conference. "That's not quite the idea Mike, but it's close..." Mike
told me that he noticed that I didn't say "Open Source" or "Free
Software" until well into the discussion. I did that on purpose.

<p>

Getting other Lab officials involved in the conference was something I
didn't like. "They're going to hijack the idea and run away with it
and take all the credit for it!" I told Mike. Mike was sensitive to
this problem, but left me no choice. Either the Lab management was to
get involved and give their stamp of approval or there was going to be
no conference. "You can always reserve a conference room and invite
your speakers, but if you want the Lab's logo (and resources and money)
to back your conference, you have no choice but to get one of the
departments to back you." Mike continued, "If it were a Physics
conference or workshop, I could see the physics department backing you
up, but for this one, you need to go to ITD." (ITD is the Information
Technology Division.) I don't know why I was so jealous of this
conference idea. Who on earth would want to take over this Open Source
conference? No one in the Lab management had ever heard of the term
"Open Source" and they had no interest in the matter. (As it turned
out, this was mostly true. There were several "directors" in the
directors office (we have lots of directors) who, in the end, did show
interest.) I guess what I was worried about was that my efforts in
trying to promote this as a computing conference as much as an Open
Source conference would get those with computing empires at the Lab to
take note and take the conference over. Hindsight has proven that this
was the least of my worries.

From that meeting, Mike told me how to proceed. Make sure I get
ITD management to back the conference. I had to
broach the idea to them which meant getting ITD involved. We also
needed to get someone from the Directors Office involved as well. My
tendency was to go straight to the top, but Mike warned me that the
first thing anyone in the directors office would do is consult with
Don Fleming, the new Lab CIO and chair of ITD.

<p>

While I was pushing the idea of this conference through my contacts,
Sean and Malcolm were pursuing the idea of the conference through
Biology. From that we got two key people on the organizing
committee. Donna Zadow and Ann Emrick. They are pros in this
conference stuff, which I would later find out. "Let us worry about
getting the speakers here, you worry about the content of the
conference." That was a phrase they kept telling me. (And they were right.)

After several weeks of having meetings to meet with X, Y and Z,
meeting with X, Y and Z and then having more meetings to meet with U,
V and W, we finally got 3 of the working folk of ITD involved. Tom
Schlagel, Ed McFadden and Susan McKeon. Ed really pushed the
conference idea. He wanted to set up meetings with Don Fleming and Jim
Glim, the new head of the Center for Data Intensive Computing. We
needed to get their OK for this conference to proceed. And at about
this time, word started to leak to them of the conference as well as
to Peter Paul, the big cheese in the Directors office. As I said, we
have many directors. At the top is the Lab director, Dr. John
Marburger. He had no interest in any of this, which was leaked to me
by his secretary when she called about a month later, to inform me
that he turned down my personal invitation to attend the conference
and VIP dinner.  Under him there is Peter Paul, who is the
scientific lab co-sub director. There is another guy who is also a
co-sub director who is in charge of the non-scientific aspect of lab
management. The guy to talk to was Peter Paul. If we got his OK, then
we knew the conference would happen. But we wanted to make sure he
heard it from us, the original organizers. Not the head of ITD or
anyone else. We had the idea first, and we want to make sure Peter
knew that. (Again, I don't know why I was so jealous of this fact, but
I was.) So, Malcolm, Sean, Tim and I decided on a pre-emtive
strike. Instead of letting Peter hear about the conference from Don
Fleming, or anyone in ITD, we were going to go to him first. The guys
from ITD said that having this meeting with Peter Paul without someone
from ITD would make it look disorganized and could potentially derail
the conference. We didn't care, "This is just a <em>pre</em>-meeting"
to tell Peter what was coming down the pipe. "It's just a heads up
thing."

So I called Peter Paul's secretary, set up a meeting and within a day
we were talking to him in his office. "We want to have the accelerator
facility, the Light Source and the lab scientific infrastructure as a
backdrop to this conference." "It's a great way to promote the
computing efforts of the Lab." "Look, people use this same software on
their PC's at home that we use to do our research. This commonality is
a great way to get them into the lab and show them around." And so we
pitch the idea. "Wait a minute!" he said, shuffling over to his
Xterminal, groping for his mouse. Click, click, click. "Hmmm, October
2nd? I won't be here." Pause.... "But I don't have to be here for the
conference do I..." Finally after about 30 minutes of pitching the idea
to him, (some small/short heads up meeting this was, it was a full
blown presentation,) he asked, "Well, what do you want from me?" It
suddenly dawned on me what he was really asking, was "How much
<em>money</em> do you want from me?" After a brief pause to think
about what he was really asking for, I said. "We need money." I didn't
say anything about how much we needed. He just offered to kick in $2K
to get the conference going. He's got his own directors stash which he
can do with as he pleases and that afternoon he gave us, what turned
out to be, the last $2K he had in his scientific co-directors
fund. Looking back on this, that was quite a feat on our part. Peter
just donated $2K to help promote the use of "Open Source" software at
BNL. More importantly, we got the official backing from the Lab Mike
Murtagh told me I should get. But there was still work to be
done. Peter said that we got his blessing and money but we still
needed to get ITD to fully back the conference. This meant we needed to
get back with the ITD contingent of our organizing committee and
schedule a meeting with Don Fleming.

In the meantime, I set out to try and get other departments to
contribute money to the conference. Our eventual plan was to hit up
the vendors for money by selling ad space on our conference web site
and floor space in the auditorium lobby. But for now, we needed some
"startup" funds. Physics and the Light Source kicked in $2K each
without much fuss. Mike knew that I would need money. I asked if I
could put money in from my own computing funds for the physics
department. He OK'ed that. I sent an e-mail to the head of the Light
Source and that was all it took to get $2K out of him. Chemistry never
responded and I was told that Biology had no money. (But we did get 4
people from Biology on the organizing committee, a much more valuable
contribution. And we did eventually get $2K from Biology, thanks to
Ann Emrick, about a month later which was a real help.) Mike Murtagh
told me that I could ask one of the physics secretaries to help with
the conference and I was able to recruit Bonnie Sherwood, another gold
nugget. The other missing component of this conference was a
budget. Ann Emrick worked up a MS Excel spread sheet with a bunch of
costs she could think of. "You need XXX for lunch, the conference
banners will be that much, the buses will cost this much." She had the
figures pretty much on the ball. The total cost of the conference, if
we did get 450 people to attend, would be $25K. The biggest single and
unpredictable cost was the food which was going to be $25 per
person. If we added a $25 entrance fee, the cost would be $15K. We got
$6K in the bag and needed $9K more to go.

<p>

This set the stage for the crucial meeting with Don Fleming. We knew
the numbers, we had a rough idea of who we were going to invite, the
date of the conference and all we really needed now was someone to
sign the lab conference paper work. In order to have a conference at
the Lab, you are required to fill out a form, get a head of a
department to sign it and submit it to staff services who works within
the director's office. This will then get an account created where one
can deposit money and more importantly, spend it.

The meeting we had with Don Fleming was a small one. Tom Schlagel was
there, along with Ed McFadden, Sean McCorkle and myself. We pitched
the idea to Don. Don got into the Open Source bit. Microsoft vs the
"Free Software" community was a theme he picked up on. He saw this as a
way of promoting ITD and the new computing initiatives the Lab was
embarking on. After about 30 minutes or so he wanted to know "What do
you want from me." Again, that question popped up which really meant,
"How much money do you want from me." We pull out the spread sheet,
showed him the figures. "We have $6K from other departments, the
conference will cost $15K" I started. I then I told him we would try
and raise as much money from outside sources as possible, implying
that this would repay any money he gave us. "OK he said, I'll cover
the remainder." Meaning that he would give us up to $9K for the
conference and he would sign that form needed by Staff Services.

<p>

Bingo! That was it! We had our conference! There was no turning back
now!

<blockquote><tt> *commit* *commit* *commit* *awwuuuugah*
*commit* *commit* *commit*<br><br>
Its a shootin war now, boys.
</tt></blockquote>

Was one e-mail Sean McCorkle fired off to our internal organizers
e-mail list.  Just after that meeting, I had to give a talk to the
PHENIX detector council. The head of the online controls group, the
group I worked in for the PHENIX experiment, touted this talk as some
kind of opportunity to get in front of the senior scientist of the
experiment and "get some exposure." I was on such a high going into
that talk, that they must of thought I had lost it. I was so giddy
during that presentation. There is always some kind of tension in the
PHENIX experiment coming from a competitive attitude within the
various subgroups. This manifests itself through criticism of ones work
as being insufficient, late, not working or whatever angle of attack
your colleague conjures up at the moment. The speaker before me was
one such notorious colleague who would be quick to "qualify" any
statements I said about my particular project for the PHENIX
detector. As it turned out, I wouldn't care less what <em>anyone</em>
in that room thought about what I was presenting. And I was talking
away, at a mile a minute, bouncing around the front of the room,
making jokes about the work, heading off "suggestions" from my
notorious colleague with out a pause, and all the time I had one
thought screaming in the back of my mind. I had just raised $15K to
put on an Open Source conference at the Lab. "PHENIX detector council,
eat your heart out!" Of course I never said that to them, but they
must have known something was going on.

The next step was to try and raise money from the Linux business
community. I got a copy of the Linux Journal and made a list of every
company who advertised there. I then split up the companies into 3
groups of which I was in charge of calling up 1/3 of them. The other
2/3rd's were delegated out to two others in the organizing
committee. Sean McCorkle snagged someone from Microway. He asked me to
follow through with them. I spent a couple of days working down my
list. I learned a valuable lesson during this part of the fund raising
campaign. One of the hardest things to do is call someone up you don't
know and try and sell them on the idea of giving you money. It is a
humiliating experience with a capital H. I have gotten a gazillion
calls from vendors trying to sell me their products and I usually keep
their pitch short and send them on their way. Now it was my turn to be
on the other end of the phone. Most of the time I couldn't get through
to the person in charge of promotions. A lot of the times all I could
do was send e-mail to these people and never get a reply. But there was
the occasional time I did get through to somebody. The first one I
did get through was KAI. I managed to pitch the conference to someone
important there. A week later, I got an e-mail that they were
interested in the coffee break sponsorship. Another victory celebration
erupted immediately.

Through out all this, we kept brining up the idea of getting a "major
sponsor" for the conference. They would contribute the full amount
needed to organize the conference and this would free up our time to
organize it rather than wasting precious time on this fund raising
task. "Ask Red Hat, they got lots of money." Was one comment. "These
guys are flush in Venture Capital funds." Referring to the general
Open Source business community like VA Linux and others. So it was
left to me to try and contact Red Hat and VA Linux. I knew Jim Gleason
of VA Linux from the NYLUG so I contacted him. He gave me names,
numbers and e-mail address of those over in corporate HQ who could
make the decisions. I contacted (via e-mail) Bob Young and pitched
the idea. He warmed up to it. VA Linux after a couple of days told me
that they could only be a minor sponsor. "All our funds have been
committed for the year" I was told. Fair enough, we were pushing to
fund a conference about 3 months before it was to take place. (Its now
mid July.) Also, everyone in Linux land was getting ready for the
Linux World Expo in San Jose CA (early August) and I knew that OSOS
would have to take a back seat to that event until it was over.

<p>

Parallel to raising money for the conference, we started to worry
about promoting it. When we first started working on organizing it, I
thought that a couple of postings on Slash Dot, Linux Today, Linux
Weekly News, Freshmeat and some well chosen news groups would be all
that we needed. WRONG! The first thing we needed to do was get the
word out to those who worked at the lab. "Simple!" I thought. BNL has
a Public Affairs office (PA) who's sole purpose is to promote the
Laboratory. I would just use those resources.

"You can't use the term Open Source. Nobody know what it is." I was
told by PA, in response to our text for the BNL e-mail announcement I
wanted them to send out lab wide. "What do you mean I can't use the
term Open Source. It's an Open Source conference. It's in the Title!"
I argued. "Also, no one knows what source code is. You can't use that
term either" they continued. "We asked someone here what they thought
source code was and they said it must be some kind of government
specification for plumbing. Sorry, you can't use it" PA said. I
couldn't believe what I was up against. PA continued, "Also, we don't
e-mail lab wide announcement of conferences. No body is interested in
conferences, and that is not our job. We do have a special e-mail
list which people sign up to where we can post your announcement
too. It has about 800 people signed up" they boasted. I checked out who
was on the list and it was slim pick'ns as far as laboratory
scientists and engineers went. I had never heard of this announcement
e-mail list which PA was telling me about so how would the rest of the
lab know about it. And I have been at the lab for over 10 years!. So
be it, we did our best to reword the text for our e-mail announcement
to the Lab, replacing the terms Open Source and source code and let
them send out the e-mail to the their 800 list subscribers. This
generated about 30 hits on our web site of which about 5 were
interested in the conference. We had to do something. We used the lab
channels and came up empty handed. Furthermore, of all the people I
asked, no one had gotten our e-mail announcement. And I asked all my
colleagues who I worked with who I knew would be interested in it. This
left us with little recourse but to SPAM the Lab. We were left with no
choice. We were going to get the word out to the Lab via e-mail no
matter how high the obstacles PA and Lab management were going to
throw up in our path. So, after about 2 hours of perl scripting, I
was able to generate a list of over 5000 e-mail addresses of anyone
who in one way or other was involved with the Laboratory. After
setting the mailing in motion, (I had to send out the e-mails slowly
since there was the possibility of crashing the NT mail exchange server
of the Lab and if the OSOS SPAMing did so, we would be in <em>big</em>
trouble. It had happened once before with a situation not related to
our conference and thus our caution) we got a healthy hit rate on our
web site and everyone I talked to had received notice of the
event. Sorry Public Affairs, but we just had to do it. You left
us no choice in the matter.

But that was just the beginning of our efforts to get the the word
out. We spent a healthy 2 weeks generating our own mailing list of
colleges and Universities through out the NE to which we would
snail-mail a flier announcing the conference. But we realized that we
needed to do more. We further realized that we didn't budget a penny
to advertise the conference. By this time, I was able to get KAI, SGI,
Portland Group and others to sponsor the conference. We had generated
about 5K in sponsorships at this point. So we decided to spend all
those funds on advertising. Also, this was just around the Linux World
conference. It turned out that Donnie Barns was talking with VA Linux
during Linux Expo, about a possible joint major sponsorship. A week
later I got e-mails from VA Linux and Red Hat that they were
interested. This sent chills down my spine. This was the mother load!
The organizing committee huddled and tried to figure out how we would
"package" a major sponsorship. It was rather easy. We would put
their names and logos on every bit of real estate we owned, on the web,
on every banner, conference bag and brochure we would print. Anywhere
and everywhere we could think of, Red Hat's and VA Linux's logo would
be there. They like it, and we got $25K. Thank God, because we spent
it <em>all</em> on advertising.

The NY Times science section and Newsday took up the lion's share of
advertising funds. We also got 10 days of prime time space on WSHU,
the local public radio station broadcasting out of Connecticut.  My
guess is that we got word out about the conference to well over
100,000 people. In the end over 200 people showed up, a 10^-3 effect
which is what I expected. The important thing was not so much that we
got over 200 people to attend the conference, but that hundreds of
thousands of people saw the Brookhaven Laboratory logo associated with
Open Source software along with Red Hat and VA Linux. In a country of
250 million people, hundreds of thousands are not large numbers, but
you have to start somewhere. And the long term effects of this "brand
name" association are yet to be known but I'm sure it will be
positive. (Dr. John Marburger, the director of the Laboratory, should
be very grateful of us for what we did here.)

By the time the spots on NPR started airing and the ads in the NY
Times and Newsday started to appear, the registration rate started to
pick up. It peaked the weekend before the conference. All that was
left was to make sure we put on a good show for the attendees. (Ehmm,
I meant to say a good "conference".)

<p>

"What do you mean the VA Linux PC's are stuck in NYC?" I asked Jim
Gleason. Those were the PC's we were going to use for the Post/Demo
room. "Its a union thing" he replied. "The Fed Ex guy wasn't allowed to
cross the corridor to pickup the boxes. Only a union guy could do
that." Where are are we going to get replacements? "Sean, Ed,
Heeeelp!" (Sean McCorkle, Ed McFadden and I managed to scrounge up
enough Xterminals from around the Lab to cover the missing VA Linux
boxes.) "What to do you mean we have to have to conference photo in
the back of Berkner. I want it taken just out side the main entrance!"
I told Ann Emrick. "Sorry, the photographer said there was too much
sun light" she replied. Who ever heard of too much sun light!

And so October 1st and 2nd went, one crisis situation after
another. The day flew by and before I knew it, what remained of the
speakers and who ever I could find hanging around after the
conference, were seated at <em>The Bellport</em>, for our "VIP"
dinner. It was all over at that point. I had a stiff drink which I
rarely do. "A whiskey on the rocks please, and make it a double."
Everyone seemed to have a good time there. I spent most of my time
reminiscing about DEC hardware with Maddog, Larry Augustin, and Bruce
Perens.

<p>

The following week I started to hear feedback on the conference. As
best as I can tell, it turned out to be a great success. The most
admirable compliment came from Tom Kirk, the associate director for
Nuclear and High Energy Physics. (He makes all the decisions
regarding future nuclear and high energy experiments at the Lab. In
other words, he's an important guy.) He told me that the conference,
when looked back several years from now, would be considered as a
key turning point on the topic of Open Source and science. I also got
word that a lot of good things were said about the conference through
out the directors office.

So there I strolled along Bell Avenue, heading north towards the
bank. A bright breezy day. The surrounding trees vibrated in fall color.
Peace and quiet. "So what's next?" was a thought I was trying to avoid. I
was recovering from my 4 month marathon organizational project. I was
going to have to heal some open wounds I had left with my colleagues
over in PHENIX. They were threatening to take my name off the
authorship list of the PHENIX experiment for skipping out on all their
meetings and generally blowing them off. Finally, I was going to have
to think about the future. "Open Source/Open Science 2K. Hmmm that has
a nice ring to it."
