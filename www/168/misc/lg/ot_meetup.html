&gt; Quoting Jimmy O'Regan (joregan@gmail.com):
&gt;
&gt;&gt; I'll be in San Francisco for a couple of days next month (Google
&gt;&gt; Mentor Summit). Will anyone else be around?
&gt;
&gt; Only all the time.
&gt;
&gt; Chez Moen is down about 60 km south of the city of San Francisco,
&gt; at the base of the San Francisco Peninsula, close to Stanford
&gt; University. Â I don't very often get to San Francisco, but certainly
&gt; can/will in order to rendezvous and spend time.
&gt;

<p>
With less than a week left, I just now took the time to look at a map
and see where I'll /really/ be; turns out it's Sunnyvale, which is
much closer to Stanford <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

 From Friday morning to Monday morning; staying in Sunnyvale, and the
Google thing is Saturday and Sunday in Google HQ. I'm planning to go
pretty much straight from the airport to Golden Gate (too many people
have put it into my head that I have to go there), which'll probably
take up most of the day(?); we have a meet and greet thing at 5pm,
which from what I gather is dinner then drinking. (I'm not exactly the
poster boy for the temperance movement, which is why I'd like to get
Golden Gate out of the way first <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

/me checks, and is mildly astonished to note that he's sitting in
front of a workstation in Sunnyvale -- not to be confused with
Sunnydale, home of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and friends.[1]

[1] Except in the movie, where it was indeed Sunnyvale, occasioning much
local amusement.

What a terrible movie... though it does have the best hammed up death
scene I've ever seen <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Just so.
</p>

<p>
The movie took Joss Whedon's original script and joked it up to the
point that it was just high-"camp" -- to the author's disappointment,
but he had no creative control.  Some years later, he was able to 
get television funding for a series based on the same concept <em>with</em>
creative control.  The series was what is termed a "mid-season
replacement", where one of the broadcast networks has cancelled
something and seeks to fill in the vacancy in its schedule with
a speculative offering from its "spare" efforts.  Mid-season
replacements have often been among the more wildly creative programmes,
in consequence.  (Of course, most such replacements fail quickly.)
