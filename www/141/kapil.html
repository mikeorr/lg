<h1>Who is using your Network?</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</a></b></p>

<h2>1&nbsp;&nbsp;The Evil That Lurks Within</h2>
<p>Securing a local network (LAN) usually means creating firewall rules, host
access rules and proper configuration of Mail, DNS and web servers. All these
methods are primarily based on the assumption that the threat to your network
is from the big bad internet. In this article I will take a reverse point of
view&mdash;that is, users of the local network who are (possibly) the bad guys.</p>
<p>Such an assumption may be justified in the following contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network is large one, like a campus-wide network.
The network administrator has no knowledge of or control over all the different
computers that are connected to the LAN.</li>
<li>A typical wireless network where everyone in your
neighbourhood can use your internet link.</li>
<li>You are in a cut-throat corporate office (perhaps this
applies to some academic departments as well) where you do not really trust
your colleagues&mdash;and all of them wear black-hats.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I spoke about &ldquo;users&rdquo; above, the <em>real</em> actors
in a computer network are computers. By making the (often false!) assumption
that each computer is doing <em>exactly</em> what its user wants it to do, I
will reduce the question to the following:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">How can computer Abdul that wants to talk to computer
Chin be reasonably confident that computer Betaal is not able to intercept the
conversation and/or impersonate Chin?</blockquote>

<h2>2&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a telephone network</h2>
<p>In order to understand why a slightly sophisticated solution is required, we
need to realise that a LAN is a not like a telephone network and an IP address
is not an identifying label in the same sense that a telephone number is.</p>
<p>The more sophisticated reader will know about &ldquo;hardware&rdquo;
addresses (also known as Ethernet or MAC addresses) which are built into the
hardware unlike IP addresses. However, the description of the network given in
the paragraph below is equally appropriate if you replace &ldquo;IP
address&rdquo; with &ldquo;MAC address&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A typical LAN is a packet based network. Each computer is always
&ldquo;connected&rdquo; to all other computers. Conversations are based on
packets which are sent &ldquo;via the wire&rdquo; and are &ldquo;heard&rdquo;
by all the computers on the network. Each packet is labelled by the recipient's
IP address so that the relevant party can &ldquo;listen to it&rdquo; (in other
words, <em>copy it</em> to its memory). The packet also contains sender's IP
address so that the recipient knows where to send replies.</p>
<p>Computer Betaal (as the ghost in the machine) can collect (copies of)
packets meant for any destination and can also inject packets with any label(s)
desired.</p>
<p>So, Abdul must (digitally) sign every packet sent out and encrypt it so that
only Chin can read it. If Abdul only signed the packets, then Betaal (still)
could collect them. Since there are a <em>lot</em> of packets that make up any
conversation, Betaal could re-send the packets later in a more profitable
order&mdash;thus delivering a blow to Chin. If Abdul only encrypted the packets
then Betaal could inject his own encrypted packets of gobble-de-gook
(illegible/undecipherable data) and disrupt the conversation between Abdul and
Chin.</p>
<p>Let me re-state this in jargon. "In a packet based network, secrecy and
authenticity go hand in hand."</p>

<h2>3&nbsp;&nbsp;Secure Shell</h2>
<p>When Tatu Ylonen originally wrote <code>ssh</code> it was thought of as a
replacement for <code>telnet</code> and <code>rsh</code> which are
programs/protocols for remote logins (for remote shell access). However,
<code>ssh</code> is a <em>network protocol</em>, so it can be used to create
secure conversations between computers.</p>
<p>Each SSH server has a private key&mdash;usually located at
<code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key</code>. Often, there is a second private key in
<code>/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key</code>. Network administrator's job is to
collect public keys associated to each of these private keys (in the same
place, with a <code>.pub</code> extension) and distribute them to <em>all</em>
computers on the network.</p>
<p>The simplest way to do this is to go to each computer and copy these files
to a USB stick:</p>
<pre>
   cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub /media/usb/&lt;ip_addr&gt;.rsa.pub
   cp /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key.pub /media/usb/&lt;ip_addr&gt;.dsa.pub
</pre>
<p>Admin then creates a &ldquo;known hosts&rdquo; file:</p>
<pre>
   for type in rsa dsa 
   do
       for i in /media/usb/*.$type.pub
       do
         addr=$(basename $i .$type.pub)
         (echo -n "$addr "; cut -f1-2 -d' '&lt; $i)&gt;&gt; known_hosts
       done
   done
</pre>
<p>This <code>known_hosts</code> file is then copied to
<code>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</code> on <em>each</em> computer. Finally, we
set configuration parameters</p>
<pre>
   echo "StrictHostKeyChecking yes" &gt;&gt; /etc/ssh/ssh_config
</pre>
<p>on each computer. (Users on each computer may also need to modify the
configuration file <code>$HOME/.ssh/config</code> if it exists and remove/edit
<code>$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts</code> if it exists).</p>
<p>After this (admittedly) long-winded (but not difficult) procedure, Abdul and
Chin have each other's public keys. So, Abdul can encrypt packets which only
Chin can read and Chin can verify signatures made by Abdul. (The actual SSH
protocol is more complex and doesn't concern us here).</p>
<p>So, now, on Abdul one can do <code>ssh Chin</code> and be confident that it
<em>is</em> Chin who is answering. Chin will still ask for the password unless
all servers enable <code>HostBasedAuthentication</code> in
<code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>. This procedure might be risky for Chin,
unless the <code>root</code> user on Abdul is to be considered equivalent to
the <code>root</code> user on Chin.</p>
<p>What about other (than SSH) types of data exchange? Luckily, this too has
been thought of. If Abdul wants to open TCP port (say) 80 on Chin now, then
Abdul runs</p>
<pre>
   ssh -q -f -N -L 8080:localhost:80 Chin
</pre>
<p>Now, opening <code>http://localhost:8080</code> on Abdul gives Chin's web
server.</p>
<p>What about securing <em>all</em> of data exchange? This has been thought of
as well. In fact, SSH provides at least two ways:</p>
<ol class="enumerate" type="1">
<li class="li-enumerate">Applications that can use the SOCKS protocol (like
Mozilla and Thunderbird) can use a tunnel created by this command:
<pre>
         ssh -q -f -N -D 1080 Chin
</pre>
There are also wrapper libraries like <code>tsocks</code> that can
&ldquo;teach&rdquo; any TCP application to use SOCKS.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">One can also create a TCP <!-- previously,
IP, but I don't think that you can use UDP over SSH tunnels without
non-SSH workarounds - UCP>TCP and TCP>UDP translators -->
tunnel between the hosts:
<pre>
         ssh -q -f -N -w 0:any Chin
</pre>
With some additional network configuration at <em>each</em> end, this tunnel
can be used by all TCP applications, but not by applications that use UDP
instead of UDP for their transport.</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite these efforts, SSH is not always adequate for the problem we set out
to solve for the following reasons:</p>
<ol class="enumerate" type="1">
<li class="li-enumerate">The key distribution mechanism is complex.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">It is not a great idea to tunnel TCP over TCP as
explained in an <a href=
"http://sites.inka.de/sites/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html">article by Olaf
Titz</a>.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">We need to setup tunnels between each pair of hosts in
the network; and this is a pain.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="section"><a name="htoc4" id="htoc4">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;OpenVPN</h2>
<p>OpenVPN can be thought of as SSH with a solution to all three problems noted
above.</p>
<p>One machine is configured as the <code>openvpn</code> server and all of the
other boxen - as clients. Server passively waits for the client to initiate a
connection. Once the connection is established, roles of the two computers in
the conversation are completely symmetric.</p>
<p>The server (respectively, client) can be configured using the sample
<code>server.conf</code> (<code>client.conf</code> for the client) file that
comes with the openvpn package (sample config files should be located at
<code>/usr/share/doc/openvpn-&lt;version&gt;/sample-config-files</code>, if
you're using a prepackaged version. Otherwise, they're located at
<code>sample-config-files</code> directory in the source tarball). In client's
configuration file one needs to edit only one line starting with
<code>remote</code> and put in the correct server to connect to. In server's
configuration file line that starts with <code>server</code> can to be edited
to put in some random network in form of <code>10.a.b.0</code> (you could also
use <code>172.16-32.a.0</code> or <code>192.168.a.0</code>) instead of the
default. Since we want clients to talk with each other, we also enable the
<code>client-to-client</code> option in server's configuration file. In
addition, we will edit these files to put in appropriate names like
<code>host.key</code> and <code>host.crt</code> for certificate and key files
(see below).</p>
<p>One nice feature of <code>openvpn</code> is that it can use certificates.
This completely simplifies key distribution &mdash; we no longer need to
distribute public key(s) of a new host to all other hosts. This gain comes at
the &ldquo;pain&rdquo; of setting up a Certificate Authority.</p>
<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc5" id="htoc5">4.1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stamp
of Authority</h3>
<p>First, we have to set up a Certificate Authority (CA) on one computer
(network administrator's personal computer, for example). There are a number of
ways to do this.</p>
<p>A simple way to setup a CA is provided with <code>openvpn</code>. We begin
by copying the &ldquo;Easy RSA 2.0&rdquo; directory to a suitable place.</p>
<pre>
   mkdir /root/openvpn_CA
   cd /root/openvpn_CA
   cp -a /usr/share/doc/openvpn/examples/easy-rsa/2.0 .
</pre>
<p>Next, we have to edit last few lines of the <code>vars</code> file in this
directory to reflect our organisation. The relevant lines:</p>
<pre>
   export KEY_SIZE=2048
   export KEY_COUNTRY=
   export KEY_PROVINCE=
   export KEY_CITY=
   export KEY_ORG=
   export KEY_OU=
   export KEY_EMAIL=
</pre>
<p>Then, we generate key of the Certificate Authority.</p>
<pre>
   . ./vars
   ./clean-all
   ./pkitool --initca 
</pre>
<p>Once all queries from the last command have been properly answered, we have
a bunch of files in the <code>keys</code> subdirectory.</p>
<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc6" id="htoc6">4.2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Give us a
sign</h3>
<p>Having set up the certificate authority, we have to sign keys of each host.
First, each host generates a signing request:</p>
<pre>
   ln -s /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub /etc/openvpn/host.key
   cd /etc/openvpn
   openssl req -new -extensions v3_req \
         -key host.key -out host.csr
</pre>
<p>All of the queries should be answered carefully. In particular, it is a good
idea to use the fully qualified domain name for the common name (CN) entry.
Then, <code>host.csr</code> is copied to the <code>keys</code> directory, where
the certificate authority was installed with a name like
<code>&lt;hostname&gt;.csr</code>. The CA then verifies and signs the key with
the following commands:</p>
<pre>
   . ./vars
   ./pkitool --interact --sign &lt;hostname&gt;
</pre>
<p>Then, <code>ca.crt</code> and <code>&lt;hostname&gt;.crt</code> files from
the <code>keys</code> directory of CA are copied <em>back</em> to the original
host's <code>/etc/openvpn</code>; we also rename (or symlink)
<code>&lt;hostname&gt;.crt</code> to <code>host.crt</code>.</p>
<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc7" id="htoc7">4.3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting it
all together</h3>
<p>Now, to start the tunnel, we run</p>
<pre>
   /etc/init.d/openvpn start &lt;config&gt;
</pre>
<p>where the <code>&lt;config&gt;</code> is <code>server</code> or
<code>client</code> as appropriate. We can start multiple client versions which
are directed to the same server. Since we want the clients to talk with each
other, we enable the <code>client-to-client</code> option in the server's
configuration.</p>
<p>So, let us say that Octavio is the server and Abdul and Chin are two
clients. When Abdul and Chin have a conversation over <code>openvpn</code>
(which is ensured by Abdul by opening a connection to the
<code>10.a.b.x</code> address assigned to Chin) they can be reasonably
confident that no one&mdash;not even Octavio&mdash;can intercept this
conversation. Since <code>openvpn</code> asks for the certificate at the
start of the conversation, Abdul is also confident that it <em>is</em> Chin
at the other end of the conversation. At the very least Abdul is certain
that this has been certified by the Certificate Authority.</p>
<h3 class="subsection"><a name="htoc8" id=
"htoc8">4.4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Problems</h3>
<p>Have Abdul and Chin solved their problem? Can they communicate without
worrying about Betaal?</p>
<p>Some problems remain:</p>
<ol class="enumerate" type="1">
<li class="li-enumerate">All the parties depend on Octavio who is at the center
of the (virtual) network. This may be appropriate for some situations, like a
wireless network, where the natural shape (topology) of the network is
star-like, but is inappropriate in a campus-wide network.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">Though routing is automated, it is still complex. Each
pair of machines is connected by the underlying local network as well as the
virtual network. To make the conversations secure, we must ensure that all data
is exchanged over the virtual network.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="section"><a name="htoc9" id="htoc9">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat</h2>
<p>The solution to these two problems has essentially been described by Rene
Pfeiffer in his <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/125/pfeiffer.html">article
I</a> and <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/126/pfeiffer.html">article II</a> on
IPsec. We will vary from his prescription in two respects:</p>
<ol class="enumerate" type="1">
<li class="li-enumerate">Use the &ldquo;transport&rdquo; mode for IPsec rather
than the &ldquo;tunnel&rdquo; mode.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">Use the &ldquo;use&rdquo; policy for IPsec rather than
the &ldquo;require&rdquo; policy.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first ensures that routing is &ldquo;automatic&rdquo;. The second allows
us to migrate to an IPsec network without disrupting existing connections. Once
all machines that need to speak securely to each other are configured we can
switch to the &ldquo;require&rdquo; mode to ensure that all conversations are
encrypted.</p>
<p>One difference between IPsec and <tt>openvpn</tt> is, that, in IPsec, a
separate daemon handles the key exchange and authentication. In GNU/Linux, this
is <tt>racoon</tt>. We configure the <code>/etc/racoon/racoon.conf</code> file
as follows. First of all, we put in the path to the certificates. This can be
the same as certificates generated for OpenVPN. Next we configure
authentication.</p>
<pre>
   remote anonymous {
      exchange_mode main;
      certificate_type x509 "$HOST_CERT" "$HOST_KEY";
      verify_cert on;
      my_identifier asn1dn;
      proposal {
            encryption_algorithm aes;
            hash_algorithm sha1;
            authentication_method rsasig;
            dh_group modp1024;
      }
   }
</pre>
<p>Here we have to replace <code>$HOST_CERT</code> and <code>$HOST_KEY</code>
with certificate and key locations, respectively. The next section in the
configuration file describes the encryption used after successful
authentication.</p>
<pre>
   sainfo anonymous {
        pfs_group modp768;
        encryption_algorithm 3des;
        authentication_algorithm hmac_md5;
        compression_algorithm deflate;
   }
</pre>
<p>Next, we instruct the kernel to use IPsec whenever possible. To do this, we
ensure that the following directives are loaded by command <code>setkey</code>.
Flush the security associations and security policies.</p>
<pre>
   flush;
   spdflush;
</pre>
<p>The policy is to use the ESP protocol and AH protocol for <em>all</em>
packets between this host and any other host on the network <em>if
possible</em>. In commands below, one needs to put in the correct
<code>$IP_ADDR</code> and <code>$NETMASK</code> values</p>
<pre>
   spdadd $IP_ADDR $NETMASK any -P out ipsec
      esp/transport//use
      ah/transport//use;

   spdadd $NETMASK $IP_ADDR any -P in ipsec
      esp/transport//use
      ah/transport//use;
</pre>
<p>This means that all hosts will use encrypted and authenticated traffic for
every <!-- reciprocating --> host in the LAN which supports encrypted traffic.
This allows one to enable this configuration on all hosts in LAN <em>one host
at the time</em> without disrupting the existing network in the process. Once
all hosts are configured for IPsec, this can be replaced with</p>
<pre>
   spdadd $IP_ADDR $NETMASK any -P out ipsec
      esp/transport//require
      ah/transport//require;

   spdadd $NETMASK $IP_ADDR any -P in ipsec
      esp/transport//require
      ah/transport//require;
</pre>
<h2>6&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusion and Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>Now, it is relatively easy to configure machines to use encryption and
authentication in a local area network. Today, computers and networks are fast
enough, so extra calculations and extra network packets, that are required for
this, do not cause noticeable delays. Also, it is quite easy to implement such
a solution without bringing down the entire network until all machines are
reconfigured.</p>
<p>So! What are you waiting for? Choose a solution that is appropriate for your
use and put it into use!</p>
<p>In the IMSc network we have tested and implemented the <code>openvpn</code>
solution. A number of my colleagues here helped debug various aspects of this.
I thank them all for their help. The documentation of <code>ssh</code> and
<code>openvpn</code> is also very good. There is a number of great articles on
IPsec including those from LG that have been mentioned above. I thank the
authors of these documents for their assistance.</p>

Kapil Hari Paranjape has been a ``hack''-er since his punch-card days.
Specifically, this means that he has never written a ``real'' program.
He has merely tinkered with programs written by others. After playing
with Minix in 1990-91 he thought of writing his first program---a
``genuine'' *nix kernel for the x86 class of machines. Luckily for him a
certain L. Torvalds got there first---thereby saving him the trouble
(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those
days---much to the dismay of many around him who think he should
concentrate on mathematical research---which is his paying job. The
interplay between actual running programs, what can be computed in
principle and what can be shown to exist continues to fascinate him.
