<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Intel Stakes a Claim to the Future, Shows Off Quad-Core System at IDF</h3>

<p>
At its annual developer conference and Geek-fest/Love-in, the Fall Intel
Developer Forum in San Francisco, Intel gathered partners and technologists
to demonstrate it leadership in a plethora of technologies.   Intel showed
off new graphics engines that rivaled the gaming and video features of
nVidia and ATI [recently bought by its chief competitor, AMD],  LAN and
WiFi solutions, virtualization, experiments in solar power and fuel cells,
and numerous other forward-looking research projects.   Intel used the IDF
conference as a springboard for new initiatives and to explain its road map
in more detail than in the past.
</p>  

<p>
Intel committed itself and its partners to releasing quad-core x86 chips
before the end of this year, moving up its earlier 2007 release date.   And
prototype systems were on hand as proof from many Intel partners.   To be
sure, these were modified dual socket mother boards that now can take dual
core chips, but these showed that most modern OSes could take advantage of
the extra cores and perform reasonable job scheduling without modification.
</p>      

<p>
Code-named Kentfield, the first chips will still sport the "Core 2"
branding, but with be  4 cores, as in 2 dual-core chips in a single socket
package.   This is partly done to improve the product yields [by about 20%
over the 4 cores on the same silicon wafer, according to Intel CEO Paul
Ortelli].  The follow-on chip will be called Clovertown and will be in the
Xeon 5300 series, a quad-core variant of Woodcrest. First out of the
chute are the quad-core products aimed at the desktop, followed server
editions. [see photo here:
<a href="ftp://download.intel.com/pressroom/kits/idffall_2006/Intel%20Core2%20Extreme%20Quad-Core%20microprocessor.jpg">ftp://download.intel.com/pressroom/kits/idffall_2006/Intel%20Core2%20Extreme%20Quad-Core%20microprocessor.jpg</a>
]
</p>

<p>
Patrick Patla, director for AMD's Server and Workstation Business, in
Austin, Texas, was quoted in eWeek calling the Intel Quad core a
"Franken-quad," and less efficient  with a single memory bus than the true
quad-core chip that AMD will release in early 2007.
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Tera scale processors</h3>

<p>
Gigabits and Gigahertz make for a massively parallel TeraScale processor.
Intel's peak at the future of computing included an 80 core CPU.   Seemingly
one-upping the IBM-Sony Cell processor, 'Tera' is more of a design point  to
which Intel is applying its vast engineering resources.
</p>  

<p>
Operating at 3.1 GHz, the goal of this multi-core experimental chip is to
test interconnect strategies for rapidly moving terabytes of data from core
to core and between cores and memory.  This monster  uses SRAM for speed
and directly connect memory blocks to each processor.  One possible design
has entire RAM blocks in the core design.  At 100 MB or more per core, that
would be the entire system, or 8 terabytes, without a memory controller.
Research efforts are aimed at trying to design DRAM to work in this manner
so as to reduce power consumption.  This could be a back door for Intel to
re-enter the memory market.
</p>

<p>
Potential uses of the technology include high-performance devices to play
photo-realistic games, share real-time video and do multimedia data mining.
Intel Senior Fellow and Chief Technology Officer Justin Rattner said
"When combined with our recent breakthroughs in silicon photonics, these
experimental chips address the three major requirements for tera-scale
computing - teraOPS of performance, terabytes-per-second of memory
bandwidth, and terabits-per-second of I/O capacity."

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Eclipse Foundation Selects Black Duck's protexIP to Review Contributed Code</h3>

<p>
Black Duck Software, a provider of software compliance management
solutions,  announced in September that the Eclipse Foundation has
purchased and deployed Black Duck's protexIP(TM)/development platform.
Eclipse uses protexIP to review software submitted by committers and ensure
it is in compliance with the specific software licensing requirements of
the Eclipse Foundation.
</p>

<p>
Eclipse is a community of open source projects, each comprised of its own
group of independent developers. The process of open source software
development regularly involves the assembly of open source code with
invented and reused components, and as a result, various licenses can
govern various parts of an application. The open nature of Eclipse's
projects intensifies the need for Eclipse to evaluate the copyrights
governing their code bases.
</p>

<p>
"Companies worldwide are capitalizing on applications developed by the
Eclipse community, and many software vendors sell products that are
dependent on Eclipse," said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of Eclipse
Foundation. "For that reason, it is absolutely vital for us to analyze our
code before we release it to our community."
</p>

<p>
protexIP compares software code to the protexIP KnowledgeBase, the most
complete database of information on open source software components, code
and license obligations available today. It contains information on tens of
thousands of open source projects from more than 2,000 sites worldwide; and
more than 650 open source and commercial licenses.
</p>

<p>
"The Eclipse Foundation represents some of the most innovative work in
application development today, as teams of developers are working together
to create tools and frameworks that will help build better business
applications," said Douglas A. Levin, CEO of Black Duck Software.
"Eclipse's purchase of protexIP makes sense given the decentralized and
very successful nature of the community's process. Eclipse now has greater
certainty that the licenses governing the code are in order."

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Terracotta Offers Eclipse Plug-in for Point-and-Click Clustering Technology</h3>

<p>
Terracotta, Inc., a leader in solutions for enterprise Java scalability,
has announced availability of its Eclipse plug-in for Terracotta DSO, the
company's enterprise-class JVM clustering technology. Bundled with
Terracotta DSO, the new plug-in makes Terracotta's point-and-click
clustering functionality available from within the Eclipse IDE and
demonstrates the company's on-going commitment to open source integration.
</p>

<p>
"Eclipse has taken the developer world by storm and become one of the most
popular open source IDEs for Java application development," said Ari Zilka,
founder and chief technology officer at Terracotta. "Terracotta DSO already
provides plug-in capacity and availability for Java applications running on
two or more machines. This plug-in further simplifies the clustering
process by automatically generating the necessary configuration files."
</p>

<p>
Terracotta DSO (Distributed Shared Objects) is a runtime solution that
allows data to be shared across multiple JVMs without the need for
proprietary APIs, custom code, databases, or message queues. With
Terracotta DSO, objects can be clustered at runtime just by specifying them
by name.
</p>

<p>
Typically, objects and data to be clustered, as well as classes to be
instrumented, are manually declared in an XML configuration file. With the
Eclipse plug-in, the declaration process is automated via graphical
representation of classes and objects, which can be browsed and acted upon
within the IDE. Right-clicking objects and selecting Terracotta options
from the context menu automatically generates the XML configuration file.
The point-and-click automation improves productivity and eliminates
iterations.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate application testing, the Eclipse plug-in lets developers
start and stop Terracotta servers and clients from within the Eclipse IDE.
In addition, the plug-in provides a more intuitive, developer-friendly XML
experience by replacing raw text with graphical representations of
sub-declarations within the XML configuration file.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />"real boot" in Linux kernel 2.6.18</h3>

<p>
Linus Torvalds announced the release of the 2.6.18 Linux kernel, following
the previous stable kernel release by three months.   With a hearty
"Arrgh!," he said, "she's good to go, hoist anchor!", this being the second
year in a row that a kernel release has coincided with 'Talk Like A Pirate
Day' . "Here's some real booty for all you land-lubbers," Linus continued,
"there's not too many changes, with t'bulk of the patch bein' defconfig
updates, but the shortlog at the aft of this here email describes the
details if you care, you scurvy dogs." In keeping with the theme, he signed
the announcement, "Linus 'but you can call me Cap'n'".

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 -- First Beta</h3>

<p>
The first beta of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, based on Fedora 5 and some
early features from Fedora 6, is available since September -- if you have a
Red Hat Network account --  but some reviewers are not impressed.    The
package management tools don't work well with RH repositories, especially the
version of 'yum' included, and the management tools for the brand new Xen
virtualization hypervisor have received complaints. But that's why there
are beta tests.
</p>   

<p>
RHEL 5 is based primarily on the 2.6.18 Linux kernel.  It comes in client
and server versions with optional directories for additional functionality
like virtualization and clustering.
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Torpark browser anonymizes Internet connections</h3>

<p>
Hacktivismo, an international group of tech-savvy human rights workers
affiliated with the Cult of the Dead Cow [cDc], has released Torpark, an
anonymous, portable Web browser based on Mozilla Firefox. Torpark comes
pre-configured, requires no installation, can run off a USB memory stick,
and leaves no tracks behind in the browser or computer. Torpark is a highly
modified variant of Portable Firefox, that uses the TOR (The Onion Router)
network to anonymize the connection between the user and the website that
is being visited.
</p>

<p>
When a user logs onto the Internet, a unique IP address is assigned to
manage the computer's identity. Each website the user visits can see and
log the user's IP address. Hostile governments and data thieves can
easily monitor this interaction to correlate activity and determine a
user's identity.
</p>

<p>
Torpark causes the IP address seen by the website to change every few
minutes to frustrate eavesdropping and mask the requesting source. For
example, a user could be surfing the Internet from a home computer in
Ghana, and it might appear to websites that the user was coming from a
university computer in Germany or any other country with servers in the TOR
network.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that the data passing from the user's computer
into the TOR network is encrypted. Therefore, the user's Internet
Service Provider (ISP) cannot see the information that is passing through
the Torpark browser, such as the websites visited, or posts the user might
have made to a forum. The ISP can only see an encrypted connection to the
TOR network.
</p>

<p>
But there are limitations to the anonymity: Torpark anonymizes the
user's connection but not the data. Data traveling between the client
and the TOR network is encrypted, but the data between the TOR network and
websites is unencrypted. So a user should not use his/her username or
password on websites that do not offer a secure login and session (noted by
a golden padlock at the bottom of the Torpark browser screen).
</p>

<p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />IBM working on smart-car subsystems</h3>

<p>
IBM has inked a five-year deal with Magna Electronics, a Canadian firm that
makes auto electronics. The goal of the partnership is to develop
systems that protect drivers  and mediate interactions with neighboring
vehicles.
</p>

<p>
Part of IBM's Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA),
systems would be developed to analyze traffic patterns and real time
performance data and react to potential problems. Beside collision
avoidance, driver alertness would be monitored. Another possibility are
headlights that dim for approaching cars. The technology would also
include autonomic systems that could diagnose internal problems, since
there would be no reliable benefit if the safety system failed when needed.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />PNY MaxFile Attache 12GB Micro Drive</h3>

<p>
PNY Technologies, Inc. announced its latest MaxFile(TM) Attache(R), a USB
2.0 micro hard drive with 12GB of storage space. The extra-small drive
includes a Migo(TM) backup and synchronization software download, so users
can sync everything from their e-mail, documents, favorites and settings
wherever they go.
</p>

<p>
"MaxFile Attache provides an ideal solution for users looking for
... cost-effective, high-capacity, compact, portable storage," said Dean
Delserro, senior marketing manager, flash, for PNY Technologies. "Only
slightly larger than a traditional USB flash drive, MaxFile's small form
factor is ideal for anyone that needs to safely carry loads of important
information with them. MaxFile Attache is a perfect choice for the user
that requires more storage at a lower cost per megabyte than is
traditionally available on a USB Flash drive, and still wants to be able to
carry it in their pocket, purse, briefcase or backpack. ...Moreover,
MaxFile Attache eliminates the need to travel with a bulky laptop,
particularly at a time when airline travelers need to limit their carry-on
items"
</p>

<p>
With 12GB of memory, MaxFile Attache can store thousands of documents,
presentations, digital photos, and songs, games - or over 25 hours of video
- and features a read and write speed of up to 11MB/sec.  Moreover, the
device features a durable, aluminum outer casing and is self-powered by a
sturdy, USB connector.
</p>

<p>
PNY's MaxFile Attache is available starting in September from retailers and
e-tailers with an MSRP of $169.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Anousheh Ansari, First Female Private Space Explorer and  the First Blogger
from Space</h3> 

<p>
The X PRIZE Foundation announced that <a
href="http://www.xprize.org">http://www.xprize.org</a> will host the
first-ever blog from space during Anousheh Ansari's historic flight to the
International Space Station. The webpage was designed by the X PRIZE
Foundation, a nonprofit prize institute in partnership with Prodea Systems,
the home technology company that is sponsoring her journey.
</p> 

<p>
"My ultimate goal is to bring this experience ... to more and more people
and to inspire young woman and men to go into the fields related to space,"
said Anousheh Ansari during a recent interview from the Baikonur Cosmodrome
in Kazakhstan. "I hope that thousands of individuals from around the world
will visit the X PRIZE site to learn what its like to fly into orbit."
</p>

<p>
In addition to the <a href="http://spaceblog.xprize.org">first-ever blog from space</a>, visitors will also read
Ansari's life story as well as watch exclusive video and interviews from
her training, preflight activities, launch and landing. Visitors will also
have exclusive access to the first episodes of the X PRIZE Foundation
Futurecast. This new podcast will feature visionaries and entrepreneurs
from around the globe to talk about what the future holds for us. The first
episodes, which can be found on the X PRIZE Foundation website and Apple's
iTunes podcast directory, will be the first podcast from space.
</p>

<p>
An active proponent of world-changing technologies, Anousheh Ansari has
been immersed in the space industry for years. Anousheh along with Amir
Ansari, her brother-in-law, and co-founder and chief technical officer of
Prodea Systems, provided the title sponsorship for the Ansari X PRIZE, a
$10 million cash prize awarded to Burt Rutan in 2004, for the first
non-governmental organization to launch a reusable manned spacecraft into
space twice within two weeks. Anousheh Ansari is also a member of the X
PRIZE Foundation Board of Trustees. Her philanthropic work through the X
PRIZE Foundation has made her an integral figure in the development of the
private spaceflight industry.
</p>

<p>
"The X PRIZE Foundation is very proud to host Anousheh's blog. We are a
21st century organization pushing the boundaries of technology," said Dr.
Peter H. Diamandis, Chairman and CEO of the X PRIZE. "We thought blogging
from space was the proper use of technology to reach today's youth. We hope
millions will visit our website and learn about Anousheh's mission as well
as the X PRIZE Cup in New Mexico, and our future X PRIZES for genome
sequencing and hyper fuel-efficient automobiles."
</p>

<p>
On Monday September 18, 2006 Ansari is scheduled to blast off in a Russian
Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, part of a
crew-exchange flight to the International Space Station. Her journey will
last for 10 days and will include a two day trip to the International Space
Station on the Soyuz as well as numerous experiments and activities that
she will film in order to create education programs upon landing.
</p>

<p>
In 2004, the $10 million Ansari X PRIZE proved that offering a prize is an
effective, efficient and economic model for accelerating breakthroughs in
science and technology. Based on that success, the X PRIZE Foundation is
now expanding their efforts to offer more prizes in the space industry, as
well as, in the areas of health, energy, transportation, and education.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />"Multiplied" Linux Desktop Migration Strategy</h3>

<p>
Modern PCs spend most of the day idle. By using the Multiplied Linux
Desktop Strategy, organisations can now leverage this unused computing
power and connect up to 10 full-featured workstations to a SINGLE,
shared SLED 10 or openSUSE 10.1 computer. For administrators, this means
only one computer to install, configure, secure, backup and administer
instead of 10.  For users, this means a rich user experience that is
indistinguishable from single-user computers for typical office
applications.  Ideal for Linux computer labs, Linux thin clients, Linux
Internet caf&eacute;s and Linux point-of-sale terminals, where users are in
close physical proximity to the host machine.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />StartSSL and Firefox 2.0 release</h3>

<p>
Eilat, Israel, October 23, 2006 - StartCom congratulates the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla</a>
team on the successful release of the new <a
 href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox 2.0</a> web browser.
After one year of development since the last release, this award-winning
and free web browser got even better than before. The new Firefox web
browser is available for immediate download! In addition to that,
StartCom is very pleased to announce the availability of the <a
 href="http://www.startssl.com/">StartCom Certification Authority</a>
as an included and trusted instance for the issuance of digital
certification in Mozilla software, including the new Firefox browser.
</p>

<p>
- The StartCom Certification Authority has matured a lot since the
first announcement in February 2005 and offers today a range of
products from free digital certification to PKI solutions for the
corporate. The project started at <a href="http://cert.startcom.org/">http://cert.startcom.org</a>
with a limited wizard to create free digital certificates for web
servers. Since then, StartCom developed various additional products for
private and commercial use, underwent a third party audit and issued
over 20,000 digital certificates. But today - with the release of the
new Firefox web browser - marks the first time, that free digital
certification (provided by StartCom) is supported and trusted by a
major browser  vendor with a significant market share. This makes it
very easy for the subscribers of the certificates and the relaying
parties (visitors) of digitally secured web sites (SSL) to use this
free service! Also the signing and encryption of email is supported in
the same manner which allows the protection of the identity and privacy
of the user.
</p>

<p>
- This event is also an excellent opportunity to make another few
announcements: StartSSL(&trade;) is the new trade mark for products and
solutions of the StartCom Certification Authority and is available at <a
 href="http://www.startssl.com/">www.StartSSL.com</a>. Additionally
StartCom started the <a href="http://www.startssl.org/">StartSSL&trade;
Web-of-Trust (WoT)</a>, which is an attempt to create a
community network of notaries and members, where notaries perform the
verification of the fellow members. Please visit the new web sites for
more information and everybody is invited to participate in the
StartSSL(tm) WoT or make use of any of StartComs free or paid products and
services.
