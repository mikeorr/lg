Dear Reader,<BR>
The News Bytes you see before you was prepared in mid-March.
As you might expect, some of the news
may not be quite as current as it ought to be, especially regarding the SCO vs
IBM lawsuit which is changing rapidly as we write.  Check with the daily news 
sources for the latest updates.

<FONT COLOR="green">Jon Johansen Will Return to Court
</FONT>
</H3> 
<P>
It
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/29543.html">
has been reported</a>
[<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a>]
that Jon Johansen will have to return to court once more in connection with
his involvement in the creation and distribution of the DeCSS computer
code.  As is well known, the DeCSS code is used to circumvent a primitive
technique used by DVD producers to obstruct users in their enjoyment of the
DVD movies they have purchased.  Norwegian prosecutors argued that to play
a DVD in this manner was a form of theft, similar to cracking somebody's
web server.  Though the ruling was in Johansen's favour, leave for an
appeal has been granted, so the whole business will have to be repeated
once more, probably in the summer.  
<P>
Such is the duration of this case that one wonders if prosecutors are
hoping that when Jon gets older he will lose public sympathy.  As Jon is now
19, headlines like "Norwegian Teen Harassed by DVD STASI" have a limited
shelf-life.

Lexmark's attempt to 
ban recycling of ink cartridges
<a href="http://www.lexmark.com/US/press_releases_details/0,1233,NzkzfDE=,00.html">
received an unsettling boost</a>
as an injunction has been issued against the company producing the
environmentally beneficial products.
SCC has 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/29569.html">
hit back</a> by bringing an anti-trust case against Lexmark.
Though the case is far from over, it highlights some disturbing potential
outcomes of the DMCA.  Wired
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,57907,00.html">
asked the question</a> (and not rhetorically, this is a
<em>real possibility</em>)
how much more would it cost to maintain your car if manufacturers put
computer chips in all the important components.
<p>
Don't mention it to anybody, but at <em>Linux Gazette</em> we have long
suspected that some users print out articles from time to time:
circumventing the CRT/LCD encryption we use to manage access to our
content.  Though our lawyers are still preparing the brief, it would appear
Lexmark printers are often used in this circumvention scheme... lets get us
some of those DMCA dollars.

<a href="http://www.riaa.org/About-Lead-1.cfm">
Hilary Rosen</a> of the
<a href="http://www.riaa.org/">
RIAA</a> has been commenting on the issue of P2P networks again.  It
seems her son Tristram managed to track down a very rare recording of <a
href="http://www.little-sparrow.co.uk/">Edith Piaf</a> singing
<a href="http://www.kumb.com/articles/challoner002.shtml">
<em>Knees Up Mother Brown</em></a>, a recording that Hilary had been hoping
to find for a very long time.  Though Hilary was initially ecstatic to hear
the tune she had for so long sought, her ecstasy soon turned to agony as it
emerged that Tristram had not taken care to clear up the thorny copyright
issues before downloading and playing the track.
<P>
It was with a heavy heart that Hilary phoned the cops to have Tristram
arrested.
<blockquote>
    "Though it hurts to see my son doing hard time, it is nothing
    compared to the pain he was causing through his criminal actions.  I
    want to set an example for all the parents of America, and the world.
    What my son did was despicable.  Even though I love him, he has to be
    made to pay for terrorising the music industry."
</blockquote>
When pressed further, Ms. Rosen replied by quoting another lyric from her
favourite songstress "Je ne regrette rien".  It is unclear at time of press
whether or not she had arranged permission to use the lyric.

<FONT COLOR="green">SCO and IBM
</FONT>
</H3> 
<P>
If you read any internet linux-news sites, you must be aware that SCO, the
company formerly known as Caldera (more or less), have 
<a href="http://www.sco.com/scosource/complaint3.06.03.html">
sued IBM</a>.  This followed several weeks of speculation regarding SCO's
recent hiring of some top legal talent.  There has been much analysis and
discussion of this development, so I am not going to go through the details
of the case.
Linux Weekly News has a 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/24747/">
good overview and discussion</a> of the substance of the claim.  A major
plank in their argument is that IBM used knowledge of UNIX technology it
gained from intellectual property owned by SCO to benefit Linux
development.  This was allegedly an attempt by IBM to kill commercial UNIX
and build-up Linux, though given that there is
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/2003/0310.barr-p2.html">
some debate</a> about many of the "facts" on which these claims are based,
a healthy dose of scepticism may be in order.
Doc Searls at
<em>Linux Journal</em> has also
<a href="http://linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6706">
cogently analysed the story</a>,
and says that with this action SCO has finally made clear which side of the
open-source/closed-source divide it truly stands.  I have to say that this
does not entirely surprise me having seen a "partners-presentation" given
by staff from SCO a few months ago in Dublin.
Further discussions can be read
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/03/03/14/1359251.shtml?tid=136&tid=130&tid=123">

<FONT COLOR="green">Every Day's a Hollings-day
</FONT>
</H3> 
<P>
Senator 
<a href="http://hollings.senate.gov/issues/2002620C00.html">
Ernest "on the Fritz" Hollings</a>
has proposed an interesting new initiative to improve the working
environment for his fellow politicians.  In Fritz's vision, members of
congress would have the opportunity to attend in any one of a range of
<a href="http://www.disney.com/">
Disney</a> inspired costumes.  Capitol buildings will also be re-worked to
bring them more into line with the spirit-lifting aesthetic popularised at
Disneyland.  Hollings is unapologetically evangelical regarding the
proposal:
<blockquote>
    "Nothing in the world is as magical as a holiday in Disneyland, it is
    the pinnacle of our great civilisation and must surely be the finest
    place to work.  What we are doing is bringing that magic into the every
    day lives of our Senators and Congress-folk.  Now, even a Senator can
    live every day in the joyous glow of Disney magic."
</blockquote>
This initiative is sure to gladden
the hearts of the hard working men and women of the government.  Fritz was
quick to point out that this endeavour would have the additional advantage
of raising the profile of the much loved entertainment conglomerate.
<p>
To facilitate the promotion and introduction of this measure, Ernest is
sub-contracting his job to Michael Eisner, Disney CEO.  Eisner declined to
comment at length.  "It will be business as usual", he purred.
<P>
This is seen as a very progressive manoeuvre by Hollings, and is typical of
the visionary and principled leadership of the man who brought us the
<a href="http://www.politechbot.com/docs/cbdtpa/hollings.s2048.032102.html">
CBDTPA</a>.  Indeed, the CBDTPA itself had an origin rooted in Disney
culture.  Taking inspiration from the Disney slogan "Where the magic comes
to you" this much-misunderstood act was intended to put a little bit of
Disney "magic" into every commonly used electronic device.

The
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">
Debian project</a> has announced new licencing terms.  Beginning April 1,
2003, software upgrades will now be on a pay-as-you-go scheme.  This will
initially affect users of Debian mirrors who will have to buy prepaid
blocks of access via the new Debian online store <em>iDebian</em>.
Starting with the next stable release there will also be a pay-per-install
scheme which is expected to be very well subscribed.  Each installation
will have an administrator program <em>DebiWin</em> which will continuously
audit the system and make sure that the user has not innocently installed
twice from a single installation medium.  Uniquely in the default Debian
install, DebiWin is a closed-source application.  This is to maintain the
"unique qualities" of the application.
<P>
Though initial reactions have
been mixed, many users are non-plussed:
<blockquote>

<P>
<a href="http://www.mcobject.com/">
McObject</a>,
developer of the
eXtremeDB
small footprint, in-memory
database, has joined with 
MontaVista Software
to offer a GNU/Linux-based
technology combination for
intelligent devices ranging from consumer electronics to carrier-grade
communications gear.
<P>
With eXtremeDB, McObject offers a new type of database to meet the
unique performance requirements and resource constraints of intelligent,
connected devices. With a footprint of 100K or less, eXtremeDB spares
RAM and CPU resources while delivering critical data management
features.
eXtremeDB's ultra-small footprint and exceptional performance enables
device manufacturers to deploy less expensive hardware, providing a key
economic benefit through reduction of BOM (Bill of Material) costs.
Similarly, by choosing MontaVista Linux tools and platforms, companies
gain significant savings over proprietary real-time operating systems
(RTOSes). Together, McObject and MontaVista lower development and
deployment costs, enhancing customers' positioning in the marketplace.
