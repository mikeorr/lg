<p>
Hello!
</p>

<p>
I am playing with 2.6.26, e2fsprogs 1.41 and ext4, just to see what ext4
can do and what workloads it can handle. Do you know of any tools that
can populate a filesystem with a random amount of files filled with
random data stored a random amount of directories? I know that some
benchmarking tools do a lot of file/directory creation, but I'd like to
create a random filesystem layout with data, so I can use the usual
tools such as tar, rsync, cp and others to do things you usually do when
setting up, backuping and restoring servers.
</p>

<p>
Curious,
Ren&eacute;.

That would be a fairly easy shell script: a loop that a) creates a
random number of files of random size, b) creates a random number of
directories, c) dives into all the subdirectories that were created, and
d) repeats the process. The only thing is that you would have to set
some hard limits: 1) how deep do you want to go, 2) max number for
directories and files, and 3) max file size. Recursive functions of this
sort will run away from you very quickly if you don't watch them.
</p>

<p>
Here's a quick hack that should do it (not very well tested, but should
work OK). Again, you'll need to set the vars at the top as per your
requirements.

Yes, and it's wise to start with low numbers. As initial defaults 32768
came to my mind, but 32768^2 if you use it for both max number for
directories and files is a bit of an overkill. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Running it repeatedly with

MAXDEPTH=5
MAXFILES=100
MAXSIZE=1000
</pre>

<p>
gives me times ranging from 1/3 of a second (no directories created) to
13.5 seconds. The maximum for that depth would probably still be under a
minute. The shell isn't the fastest thing in the world, but there's not
a whole lot of calculation going on here.

[laugh] And would take a good long while, as well - no matter what
language you used. A tree that's 32768 directories deep, with a max of
32768 subdirectories and the same max of files in each one would be...
ridiculously large - 32768^32768 + 32768^32767 and so on (or something
of that sort. It's aggravating to be this stupid at math, but you either
use it or you lose it.) A structure that's 5 dirs deep and 10 wide would
have a maximum of over 100k directories - 100k+10k+1k+100+10 - and
that's before even counting the files.

<p>
Well, big filesystems reach this size. I just counted the content of our
backup server that holds copies of 8 productions systems. It uses 132 GB
out of 1.2 TB (freshly installed in May). The filesystem holds 1,419,834
files and 88,564 directories. One of the external disks that hold
incremental backups (realised through hard links and separate
directories) holds even more files and directories. So it's not that rare to run
into big filesystems, at least for backup servers. $(find . -type f |
wc -l) takes ages (I waited for 30 minutes now and I still have no files
count).

<p>
Since I used 'mktemp' to create the files and the directories, you can
run this script multiple times to give yourself even more granular
control. It'll "back off and redo" if the directory or filename already
exist.
 
</p>

<pre>

That was sorta my point, backwards. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Setting 'MAXDEPTH' to much more
than 5 will give you ridiculous runtimes and numbers.

<p>
So, maybe a MAXDEPTH=5 and MAXDIRS=11? That gives you a maximum of 177155
or an average of 88577 directories. For files, you could do MAXFILES=32
and MAXSIZE=200000.

<p>
[laugh] Drive space is cheap, right? And Shakespeare's entire life's
work fits into 5MB or so. What's the big deal?
</p>

<p>
Yeah, we've got serious information pollution going on - and no way to
really stop it, given the associated psychological factors. We'll just
have to scrape along somehow... just like we've managed for the past few
million years.

So, now I checked your Bash script. It works and it was a wonderful

randomness. The latest test run already filled a NFS share used for
temporary data. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I'll polish the source, write some text glue and

Yeah, I use it once in a very rare while - when I have a very specific
and very narrow task to do (i.e., printing a 'field' on a line that
matches a regex) and feel too lazy to type the few extra characters.

Other than that... well, keeping backup tools in your mental toolbox is
the Unix way. Besides, I have to teach people about the stuff.

&gt; So, now I checked your Bash script. It works and it was a wonderful
&gt; template for getting slightly insane and coding a population tool in C++
&gt; with a SSE2-capable Mersenne Twister PRNG linked in for some extra fast
&gt; randomness. The latest test run already filled a NFS share used for
&gt; temporary data. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> I'll polish the source, write some text glue and
&gt; submit it for LG's "Getting Decently Distracted with Simple Problems,
&gt; Screws and Hammers" column.
</pre>

<p>
See, this is why I like robust tools. "...so then, I used these
Vise-Grips to hammer on the chain coupler and broke it loose, which
prevented the fission reaction and saved the world from a nuclear
winter." You never know how someone is going to creatively misuse your
code. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>


<pre>
&gt; P.S.: You might have guessed that I tried avoiding some real problems,
&gt; such as repairing a site with PHP code that can't properly deal with 
&gt; Unicode strings. ;)
</pre>

<p>
PHP and Unicode strings. Isn't this like that door in the movie, with
all the chains and warnings and skulls/crossbones on it that the "spear
carrier" type decides to open while everybody in the audience is going
"NO! NO! DON'T DO IT!!!"... only to hear gristly crunching and squishing
sounds a moment later?

&gt; There's supposed to be an actual use for that stuff??? <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; Yeah, I use it once in a very rare while - when I have a very specific
&gt; and very narrow task to do (i.e., printing a 'field' on a line that
&gt; matches a regex) and feel too lazy to type the few extra characters.

<p>
That's about the only occasion when I use awk, too.

Where's your sense of adventure?
Do you know why engineers and no physicists run nuclear power plants?
The physicists would only replace the circuit breakers with copper rods
and start the experiments. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Exactly, and after I read <a href="http://www.phpwact.org/php/i18n/utf-8">http://www.phpwact.org/php/i18n/utf-8</a> I gave
up all hope. It's a mess. I think the PHP developers shouldn't run
nuclear power plants either.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am playing with 2.6.26, e2fsprogs 1.41 and ext4, just to see what ext4
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can do and what workloads it can handle. Do you know of any tools that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can populate a filesystem with a random amount of files [...]
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That would be a fairly easy shell script: a loop that a) creates a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; random number of files of random size, b) creates a random number of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directories, c) dives into all the subdirectories that were created, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d) repeats the process.

Oh, Randal is one of the amazing people in the Perl community. Nice guy,
<em>brilliant</em> coder, excellent teacher... one of the pillars [no pun
intended], really. I've got a whole lot of respect for the man.
