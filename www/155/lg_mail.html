<p>
The Linux kernel is one of most complex open source project. There is a
lot of books, however it is still a difficult subject to comprehend.
The Interactive map of Linux kernel
(<a href="http://www.makelinux.net/kernel_map">http://www.makelinux.net/kernel_map</a>) gives you top-down view to the
kernel.  You could see most important layers, functionalities, modules,
functions and calls. You can zoom in and drag around to see details.
Each item on the map is hypertext link to source code or documentation.

Quoting James Harper (james.harper@bendigoit.com.au):
</p>


<pre>
&gt; According to Slashdot, Zarafa has just been open sourced.
</pre>

<p>
Rules of thumb:
</p>

<p>
1.  Be skeptical of any claim that a Web 2.0 application is open source
until you've carefully examined the actual licence.  There's been an
extremely large amount of cheating, deception, and outright lying about
licensing in this market.
</p>

<p>
2.  Be doubly, super-skeptical of those claims when you go through the
project's Web front page and find <em>three</em> claims of open sourcing but
nothing whatsosever about the licence.
</p>

<p>
In this case, a great deal of digging, one <em>finally</em>, on a subpage,
finds a Sept. 18 press release saying that the "full core" of the Zarafa
platform will be at some unspecified time be available under Affero
GPLv3.  Affero GPLv3 is indeed a genuinely open source licence targeted
at the Web 2.0 / SaaS / hosted-software / ASP market -- even though it
isn't yet OSI-certified.
</p>

<p>
The real remaining question, then, is whether the "full core" --
whatever that means -- will be turn out to be a viable, useful piece of
software.  Another scam that's <em>extremely</em> common in Web 2.0 space is to 
have a deliberately buggy, undocumented, incomplete "community" version
under open source licensing, functioning strictly as a sales come-on to
upsell users to a "commercial" (proprietary) version.  
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to remember the leading example.  Hmm, Sug[censored for
reasons of legal self-defence] 
</p>

<p>
If you want to know without doing a pilot installation of your own, wait
for comments on the Debian package.  ;-&gt;

<p>
Hi, all
</p>

<p>
A friend is looking for recommendations for cross platform software,
ideally linux, MacOS-X, Microsoft - "an address book/ diary programme that
can be synchronised with other computers. Ideally this would work like the
old Psion one, where it can be synchronised automatically with Lotus
Organizer or Microsoft Outlook on an office computer."
</p>

<p>
Any sage advice?

Hi I a, new to Linux I have installed Vector Linux on my machine but 
unfortunately where I live only dial up internet is available and I can 
only dial up the internet if I am signed in as root, if I sign in with 
the other account, chestnut dialer will not dial up at all it keeps 
telling me it cannot open the modem, is there a way to be able to use 
the other account to dial up the internet since I keep getting the 
warning message that I shouldn't run the computer in root?Thanks Vesna

Hello,
</p>

<p>
according to your author FAQ[0] under "Copyright Issues" you state
that you will publish the works sent to you under the Open Publication
License. The Wikipedia article states that the author of the OPL
recommends using a Createive Commons License as a replacement. I
understand that there are issues with the existing articles which may
prevent relicencing them but for new articles would it be OK if I'd
like to articles to be published under a Creative Commons License -
personally I prefer "by-nc-sa" for written works and "by-sa" for code
works.
</p>

<p>
Given that efforts to keep the OPL updated seem to have stopped
(actually never made it beyond a version 1.0) at 1999-07-08 I think
switching to a CC license should be considered, maybe even let authors
choose between
</p>

<pre>
 * default (stay with OPL)
 * the CC options
</pre>

<p>
any thoughts on that?
</p>

<p>
regards
martin
</p>

<p>
PS: no I don't think you can't google but I guess it's a lot easier to
just click the link of my sources, we all got enough work to do.

<h3>Using DNS blacklists to reject mail.</h3>

<p>
Hi all,
</p>

<p>
I am wanting to gather some information about using DNSBL on mail
servers. I have been reading the information on most of the more popular
used blacklists like Spamcop and Spamhaus. Now I have come up with all
kinds of questions on the subject.
</p>

<p>
I would like to hear from any mail server administrators of their
experiences with these methods of rejecting spam at the "gate". It
seems apparent that one must gage what type of spam and what type of
lists to use very carefully because of the possibility of refusing valid
mail?
</p>

<p>
Is the implementation of using a DNSBL definitely something mail server
administrators should consider?
</p>

<p>
Is it common practice to use spamassassin and DNSBL together to reduce
bombardment of spam?
</p>

<p>
Although I have been using spamassassin for some time and see that it
does a very good job of filtering and correctly labeling mail. Also the
majority seems it could be prevented altogether by implementing the
correct DNSBL or DNSBL's at the mail server level as I can see by
spamassassin headers.
</p>

<p>
One thing I have heard is that it is not a good practice to put into
effect something like this because many bigger institutions can and
periodically do get put on blacklists, through no fault of their own.
One example I have seen:
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/services/email/antispam/blacklist.html">http://www.stanford.edu/services/email/antispam/blacklist.html</a> is this
an accurate representation of some of the possible effects of this being
put into practice?
</p>

<p>
Any recommendations as to suggested best practices in using these
measures?
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
</p>
