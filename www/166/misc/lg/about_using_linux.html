No -- and neither is Firefox a webserver.  See:

Because you want something different from MS-Windows?  You want to
program in languages other than C# and VB?  Because you want something
*reliable*?

<p>
There are a few points to be made before explaining to you "why a
personal computer user would want to use this program":
</p>

<p>
1 - Firefox is a browser (a program someone uses to navigate the
internet), not a web server
</p>

<p>
2 - Linux is an operational system - just like Windows, which is what
you probably use on your computer.
</p>

<p>
And the points on why to use Linux, theres quite a few, but some of
the most important ones are:
</p>

<p>
1 - Linux is free, windows costs almost 200$ for a very limited
version (<a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/compare-editions/default.aspx'>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/compare-editions/default.aspx</a>)
</p>

<p>
2 - Linux is just as easy to use as windows (check out www.ubuntu.com)
</p>

<p>
3 - Linux has got free software alternatives for everything you need.
</p>

<p>
I guess this is it for now, drop a new message if you need anything else.

<p>
Sorry, but no
</p>

<p>
a) Linux is not a webserver, but then again
</p>

<p>
b) Firefox is not a webserver either.
</p>

<p>
Linux is the core of many operating systems that compete with Microsoft's 
WIndows and Apple's Mac OS (to name a couple). What Linux does is provide a 
modern, stable, secure, small framework on which "applications" (programs) 
can run. 
</p>

<p>
It is free (in cost, and in other ways), and runs on just about anything. Did 
you have to upgrade your PC when you moved from Windows 98 to Windows XP, or 
from WIndows XP to Windows Vista? You wouldn't have to have spent that money 
to change your computer, and would still have had a great system, had you 
used Linux instead.
</p>

<p>
Have you had a computer virus or spyware/adware program on your computer? Do 
you run virus scanners and/or spyware removal tools on your system? You don't 
have to do that with a Linux-based system; there are no viruses on Linux 
systems. No spyware either. And virus/spyware scanners don't slow down the 
system the way they do on Windows.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I have never used Linux,
</pre>

<p>
Likely, you have. You just don't know it. Do you have a Linksys or small Cisco 
router? Do you use a TomTom or Garvin GPS unit? A Samsung, SanDisk or Archos 
portable media player?  A Motorola, NEC DoCoMo, Panasonic DoCoMo, Grundig or 
Palm Pre cellphone? These /all/ use Linux as their base operating system.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; but I have  heard of it.  Can you tell me why I would use Linux?
</pre>

<p>
* Because you want to run software and applications that are Linux or Unix
   compatable
</p>

<p>
* Because you don't want to lose your data or programs to viruses and spyware.
</p>

<p>
* Because you don't want the other users of your computer to be able to
  change /your/ data or programs.
</p>

<p>
* Because you don't want to buy new hardware every time a new version of the
   Operating system comes out
</p>

<p>
* Because you don't want to buy a new version of the Operating System whenever
  the manufacturer wants you to
</p>

<p>
* Because you want to be able to use the same programs and data on various
  platforms, other than x86 PCs
</p>



<pre>
&gt; I read some about it on the site, but I would like to know why a personal
&gt; computer  user would  want to use this program.
</pre>

<p>
See above.

My favorite was when I was on a plane (JetBlue?) and they had to restart the
in-flight entertainment system. On reboot who should appear on the screen but
Tux! If memory serves they were using Knoppix. There was a mini-cheer on the
plane from my friend and I. People were rather confused by our joy at the TV
system crapping out.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, I felt much safer knowing that the plane was being piloted by our
black/white/orange friend. Especially when compared to my airport experience on
the same trip when the TV monitors in the terminal popped up a Windows error
over the national weather map and arrival/departure statuses. Another win for
Logan.

<p>
(Interesting that you should mention Firefox, Sandra. It's a piece of
open source software - something that is true of Linux as well - and
everything that I'm about to say applies to it as well. I hope that
you're using Firefox and enjoying it; at the moment - and I'm making a
guess based on your question - you may have more of a moral right <em>to</em>
enjoy it than any other piece of software on your system. Please read
further to see why I say that.)
</p>

<p>
A number of people here have mentioned quite a list of reasons, most of
them technical ones. However, there's also a strong moral perspective to
your "why" - and to some people, it's the main reason. That's what I
want to explore here.
</p>


<p>
One thing that's often cited by Linux enthusiasts is "Linux is free,
Windows costs lots of money." That's true, from some perspective... but
let's face it: very, very few people actually go through the physical
act of hauling out their wallet and paying for a box of software that
says "Windows Operating System" or whatever - almost everyone buys their
computer with Windows already installed, pays the total at the counter,
and never realizes that a large part of the price tag is for that
operating system. It's a hidden cost.
</p>

<p>
By the same token, when it's time to upgrade their computer, they pay A
Computer Geek to come do something magical to their box; he sticks a
marker-labelled CD into their CD-ROM drive, mutters some incantations,
waves a dead chicken over the CPU, and - ready for this? - charges them
$50 or whatever for his time.
</p>

<p>
Did he actually install a licensed copy of Windows on that machine? No,
because that would cost $200 or so <strong>plus</strong> his time, and no average
computer user would ever pay that for some weird geek magic. So, he
installs a hacked copy of Windows on your machine, and you go on, no
wiser for the experience.
</p>

<p>
BUT:
</p>

<p>
In the first place, you were ripped off - your money sneaked out of your
wallet without your knowledge - when you bought that first copy of
Windows. In the second place, you are - to use a bit of legal
terminology - a receiver of stolen goods, and are criminally liable,
since ignorance of the law is not accepted as a valid excuse. Pretty
outrageous, both of those; you're either a victim or a criminal, with
little or no power to make a decision at the critical moment.
</p>

<p>
Now, chances are that you will never be prosecuted on that charge (and
you will certainly never recover that original hidden cost)... but
people who are aware of the situation - as you now are - must make an
ethical decision: what is the right thing to do in this situation?
What's the right thing to do from here forward?
</p>

<p>
1) You could just say "Hell, I don't care; everybody does it" and let it
go at that - but it <em>is</em> illegal, and the ethics of it are highly
questionable.
</p>

<p>
2) You could say "Fine, then I'll pay for my copy of Windows", call
Microsoft, and take care of it. It's only a couple hundred bucks, right?
Oh, right... there's also a few hundred for MS Office, and Photoshop,
and a few other pieces of software... that's only a few thousand dollars
- no big deal, right?
</p>

<p>
Obviously, for most people, that's not a viable solution: they don't
have that kind of money to just casually and suddenly throw at something
as nebulous as an "operating system" or "software" - and particularly
one that allows viruses, worms, crashes, and so on. Would <strong>you</strong> pay good
money for, say, a car that worked as poorly as that? Or would you take
it back and scream at the dealer for a refund?
</p>

<p>
3) ...or you could install Linux (there are other free operating systems
out there - just to make the issue a bit more confusing - but none of
them are nearly as well developed for the average computer user as
Linux.) It's free - really and truly free in every useful sense - and
you're legally and morally clean and clear. All updates are, again, free
and legal. So is pretty much all the software.
</p>

<p>
There are many benefits - too many to list, although some of the folks
in this discussion have mentioned a number - that accrue from the above
basis. But that, to me, is the start of it all. I like to keep that
slate clean - and Linux dovetails perfectly with that part of my
philosophy.

I've had the same exact experience on JetBlue, and was immensely cheered

learned over the years from using Windows machines - which just happens
to be the most practical solution for a minor system on a plane that's
full of complex technology.
</p>

<p>
So, no, there's no reason that a reboot of that system should bother
anyone. It's perfectly appropriate.

&gt; Thank you for this information. However, I do the re-installing of my

&gt; Is Linux compatible with Windows. I have Windows XP version 7.  I also
&gt; use msn. So, if I install Linux, will it mess up what I already have?
&gt; One reason I am inquiring about Linux is that Microsoft and MSN often
&gt; have lots of frustrating problems.  So, does Linux require Windows to

</pre>

<p>
Perhaps I can expand your definition of computer literacy. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Let me go
over the same ground that was covered earlier by Lew Pitcher among
others: Windows is an operating system. So is Linux. Linux is usually
used as a replacement, or a superior alternative to Windows; it does not
in any way depend on Windows.
</p>

<p>
Will it "mess up" what you already have? Let me put it this way: I would
expect a better-phrased question from someone who is computer-literate.
Now, if you were to ask "will erasing Windows from my machine and
replacing it with Linux let me keep all my old software, my settings,
and the quirks that I'm used to from Windows and its software", the
question would answer itself. As it is - if you have an old Buick and a
bunch of parts for it in your garage, and you replace that old clunker
with a brand-new Porsche, then those Buick parts would become useless to
you. Would that make those parts "messed up"? Perhaps you can enlighten
us.

&gt; 
&gt; So, no, there's no reason that a reboot of that system should bother
&gt; anyone. It's perfectly appropriate.

Tux - e.g., <a href='../../../gx/tux_86x95_indexed.png'>http://linuxgazette.net/gx/tux_86x95_indexed.png</a> - is the
Linux mascot. Lots of logos, mascots, etc. are about representing the
speed, power, size, etc. of the entity that they represent; the Linux
community sorta prides itself on Tux not being representative of much of
anything at all. A "hack the culture" sort of thing... although I might
be mistaken.

  Some people have told me they don't think a fat penguin really embodies
  the grace of Linux, which just tells me they have never seen a angry
  penguin charging at them in excess of 100mph. They'd be a lot more
  careful about what they say if they had.

It's a new mail client in the works to "compete with" Mutt

It is coming along very well. Who knows? Someone might put caca or aalib

Presumably, that's <a href='http://sup.rubyforge.org/'>http://sup.rubyforge.org/</a> (missing "y"). Sounds
interesting, although it would take something amazing - y'know,
something that does everything Mutt does PLUS serves me nicely chilled
beer, balances my accounts, washes the dishes, and can also be used as a
crunchy salad topping - to make me switch away from Mutt.
</p>

<p>
I don't do religious wars, but Mutt's pretty much a perfect fit for what
I need in a mail client (and has hooks to let me add any external stuff
I might want.) There are lots of other pieces of software that I'd like
to see improved, but that one, as far as I'm concerned, is a Solved
Issue.

<p>
Same here!
</p>

<p>
All the same, it must be said that what is described there is
enticing. The basic idea seems to be to automatically index incoming
mail and thus provide the following kinds of views of mail selected
from possibly different folders:
</p>

<p>
 1. Mails associated with a particular thread.
</p>

<p>
 2. Mails grouped by tags.
</p>

<p>
 3. Mails selected by a search key.
</p>

<p>
and so on ...
</p>

<p>
This is like Mutt's "limited" view of mails in a particular folder but
across folders and with a (presumably) faster search.
</p>

<p>
This would indeed be a neat thing to add to Mutt. One drawback
is currently mentioned in the write-up about 'sup' on its home
page. Losing the index is quite bad. Similarly, editing mail folders
using a different program screws things up.
</p>

They have an option to sync in that case. Also an option on setting up
that account that sets it as ?unusual? (don't remember); for accounts
being used by other clients.

Honestly, I don't pay that much attention - as long as it looks right
and does all the things I want it to, I'm happy to leave it to the
