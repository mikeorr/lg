Q and A</h2>
<i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Q:&nbsp; Can I restore the
default values on a [Gimp plug-in] easily?&nbsp; If I experiment with various

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A:&nbsp; Some plug-ins have
Reset or Defaults buttons but many do not.&nbsp; There is no standard for
how plug-ins should behave for resetting to default values.</font></font>

But when you press Ctrl-L in an image the layers dialog shows the layers

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The easiest method is to
find Type 1 versions of the fonts you already have.&nbsp; I have found
that many of the font collections on CDs available from the local software
stores come with both True Type and Type 1 fonts.&nbsp; I just copy the
Type 1 fonts to a local directory and then tell the X server to include
this new directory.&nbsp; Take a look at the <b><font color="#006600">xset</font></b>

a look at the <a href="http://goblet.anu.edu.au/~m9305357/type1inst.html">Type1Inst</a>
script, which will configure the new directory so WordPerfect, the Gimp
and other tools can use the common Font name instead of the longer XLFD,
X Logical Font Description (that long name with all the dashes in it).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Alternatively, you can use
the True Type fonts through the use of a Font Server.&nbsp; A Font server
is a separate program that talks to the X server and manages fonts for
the server.&nbsp; There are two fonts servers available that handle True
Type fonts:&nbsp; <b><font color="#006600">xfstt</font></b> and <b><font color="#006600">xfsft</font></b>
(similar names, but different programs).&nbsp; Look on <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">freshmeat</a>
for where these can be downloaded. Font servers should be able to handle
both True Type and Type 1 fonts, but I've not tried to do mix them.&nbsp;
Using xset it should also be possible to mix local Type 1 fonts with those
managed using a font server.</font></font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><i><font color="#993300">'Muse:</font></i></b>&nbsp;
This is true if the text has already been merged with other layers in the
image.&nbsp; If the image is one you just scanned in, then the text is
already part of the single layer you scanned in.&nbsp; In any case, the
text is a bitmap image, not a vector image.&nbsp; That means you just can't
edit the text.&nbsp; In a bitmapped image, its not really text - its just
a bunch of pixels that happened to be shaped like letters.</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Some things you
may want to consider in the future is to put text on its own layer so that
it does not corrupt existing image data.&nbsp; This makes things slower
because it uses more memory, but is generally a good idea, especially for
things like text where lines are important.&nbsp; It is always possible
to have layers smaller than the image as well, and this may help speed-wise.</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><i><font color="#993300">'Muse</font></i></b>:&nbsp;
This is correct, and part of the solution to saving the old text.&nbsp;
What you can do to save the old text is to make a selection of that text,
float the selection and make that floating layer a new layer.&nbsp; Then
add two new layers:&nbsp; one "patch" layer that fills in the background
where the old text used to be and another that is the new text.&nbsp; Position
the layers so the original is at the bottom, the patch is right above it
and the new text above that.&nbsp; The old text layer can be anywhere -
just make sure its visibility has been turned off (click on the eye icon
in the layers dialog).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>The most difficult part of
this technique is creating the patch.&nbsp; This is due to the fact that
the original image probably was not a solid color so creating the patch
requires multiple steps:</font></font>
<ol>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>create a solid patch that is
very near the original image background colors.</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>select a region of background
off the original image</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>paste into the patch</font></font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>use the clone tool to copy from
the pasted region to the edges of the patch.</font></font></li>
</ol>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Its tricky, but you can do it
if the background was not too complex of a design.&nbsp; The more solid
the original background the better.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>All of this simply replaces
the old text with new text, but both "texts" end up as new layers in the
Gimp image.&nbsp; You need to save the file as an .xcf format file in order
to preserve the layers.&nbsp; Once you "flatten" the layers or "merge visible
layers" then the layer information is gone and you have a single bitmap
image (and if the old text layers visibility is turned off then the old
text goes away in the flattened image).</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Another thing
to look at is the gDynText plugin.&nbsp; I don't know the URL offhand,
but you can find references to it from <a href="http://news.gimp.org">news.gimp.org
</a>and
from <a href="http://registry.gimp.org">registry.gimp.org</a>.&nbsp; Simply
download and untar the file, then type "gimptool --install gdyntext.c"
(if that's the source file name).&nbsp; You may want to read the README
that comes with it.</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1><b><i><font color="#993300">'Muse</font></i></b>:&nbsp;
You can also, as a short cut, create a text file using vi (or some other
editor) and then copy/paste from that window into the stock Text Tool window.&nbsp;
Pasting this way will get you multi-line text, which you can't get if you
simply try to type newlines in the Text Tool's text input window.&nbsp;
Thats just an additional trick for getting multiline text into your image.</font></font>

<br>Although I do a fair amount of web design, it has been quite some time
since I've picked up any references on HTML&nbsp;, JavaScript or general
web page layout.&nbsp; When it came time for this months Muse column I
find, as usual, I&nbsp;couldn't find something new to write up.&nbsp; It
then hit me that its been quite some time since I'd done any book reviews.
<p>So off I went to visit SoftPro Books, my favorite local haunt here in
Denver for technical-oriented texts.&nbsp; I&nbsp;browsed the shelves for
a solid hour (it had, after all, been over a year since I'd last visited
them - I'd been Dallas all that time) for something new on graphics but
applicable to Linux.&nbsp; A few items looked promising but nothing stood
out as particularly motivating.&nbsp; I then moved over to the Web-based
texts.&nbsp; <b>Web Design In A Nutshell </b>by Jennifer Niederst caught
my eye, partly because of its familiar O'Reilly cover.&nbsp; Since I had
never done a review for Web Wonderings I thought this would be a good choice.
<p>The first problem I have when doing book reviews is to find one that
is applicable to Linux users.&nbsp; Keep in mind that although there are
plenty of administrative texts for Linux, there are relatively few that
are specific to Linux in other areas of computing.&nbsp; I&nbsp;scanned
the table of contents of Jennifer's text looking to see if there were any
glaring OS issues.&nbsp; There is mention of Shockwave and Flash under
one chapter heading, but other than that the five part, 27 chapter text
looked fairly platform inspecific.&nbsp; Thats a good sign for a text on
a subject that isn't supposed to care much about which platform its running
on.&nbsp; A quick chat with the SoftPro crew and I&nbsp;headed home with
the text.
<p>Once home I&nbsp;did a little deeper research.&nbsp; First, the 27 chapters
are broken into 5 parts (not including the appendices):&nbsp; The Web Environment,
HTML, Graphics, Mutlimedia and Interactivity, and Emerging Technologies.&nbsp;
Each chapter within these parts is fairly short and to the point - exactly
what you'd expect and need from a Nutshell reference.&nbsp; The opening
chapter, Designing for a Variety of Web Browsers, is a good lead in.&nbsp;
It talks about the various browsers out there, some less well known than
others, and includes a very helpful table showing feature support for many
of the different versions of Netscape, IE, and other browers.&nbsp; This
is followed in the next chapter with information on designing for various
display issues and includes graphical descriptions of the maximum and minimum
screen space available to both Netscape and IE&nbsp;users.&nbsp; A brief
list on making sites accessible (such as to speech synthesis software)
rounds out&nbsp; this chapter.
<p>The next chapter unveiled hidden platform specifics that I'd missed
on first glance - throughout the text there sprinkled pointers to tools
that can be used to deal with the current chapters topics.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
these pointers are decidedly MS and Mac oriented.&nbsp; The third chapter
goes beyond this by offering an introduction to accessing Unix systems
(as if they were so foriegn!).&nbsp; Despite these hidden annoyances, most
of the text is still platform inspecific.&nbsp; So you can just skip those
short tools sections.
<p>Through out the text there are tables and graphical descriptions mixed
in with the text.&nbsp; The tables are especially good.&nbsp; For example,
chapter 5 has a table showing relationships between common color names
(as defined by the X&nbsp;Window System), their RGB and Hex equivalents
<b>AND</b> the nearest Web safe color.&nbsp; This last bit is a new twist
on other tables like this that I've seen and is a nice bonus.&nbsp; Later
in the same chapter is a table showing the character codes used for displaying
various uncommon characters in HTML.
<p>Jennifer uses a nice guide when defining specific HTML tags - she shows
which of 5 browsers (with their various releases included) support that
tag.&nbsp; For example, the horizontal rule tag definition opens like this:
<br><img SRC="./gx/hammel/hr-example.jpg" VSPACE=10 height=82 width=580>
<br>In this case all the browsers support the &lt;hr> tag.&nbsp; If any
of them didn't, they would be grayed out.&nbsp; This makes it easy to find
which tags are browser specific and, therefore, which tags to avoid.
<p>Along with the tables, the graphical descriptions used in many parts
of the text are very useful.&nbsp; In one table in chapter 12, the appearance
of form elements is shown for 4 different browsers (2 versions each from
Netscape and IE).&nbsp; This visual explanation of the differences in implementations
is very helpful to anyone who has muddled through trying to create forms
that are usable to users of any browser.
<p>The section on graphics is disappointingly biased to MS and Mac platforms.&nbsp;
Although much of the information can be applied to the Gimp and other Linux
graphics tools, its an excersize for the reader to make the translation
from the tools Jennifer describes to their Linux counterparts.
<p>Unlike the graphics section, the audio and video chapters are less biased
in the fact that Jennifer talks more about file formats than specific applications
that use them.&nbsp; For the most part, Linux has tools that support most
of the common audio and video formats.&nbsp; At least for playing these
files, if not for creating them.&nbsp; And even then, the creation tools
are slowly coming to public availability.
<p>Two areas that are covered that I&nbsp;find quite useful are DHTML and
XML.&nbsp; I've looked at DHTML a little but have not yet begun to read
up on XML.&nbsp; The two short chapters on these subjects are good introductions
for someone who is familiar with HTML in general.
<p>This nice thing about O'Reilly's Nutshell series is that the are more
than a straight reference guide but not so boring as a full blown collegiate
text on the subject.&nbsp; Jennifer Niederst's text <b>Web Design In A
Nutshell i</b>s a fine example of this series and, despite some of the
biases toward MS and Mac applications, is well worth the price.

<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Accessing non-keyboard characters in X</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>A question came up recently
on the Gimp-User mailing list that I found interesting, mostly since I
didn't know the answer:&nbsp; How do you access characters that are available
in a certain font but do not have a key stroke assigned to them?&nbsp;
For example, how do you get to the Copyright character if there is no Copyright
key?</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It turns out you can configure
your X server to understand new keystrokes for these unattached characters.&nbsp;
The key, if you'll parden the pun , is to learn about xmodmap, the program
that maps of keys to characters for the X server.&nbsp; This program, which
should be available on every Linux distribution under /usr/X11R6/bin, allows
you to specify the keystroke to use to access extended characters in a
font.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Let's say you want to map
the copyright character to the 2 key with the Shift key held down.&nbsp;
Currently, this is mapped to the familiar "at" (@) character.&nbsp; If
you make a short text file with the following line in it(<a href="#alan">1</a>):</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>keysym 2 = 2 copyright</font></tt></blockquote>
<font size=-1><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and save the file, say named
</font><tt>temp.map</tt><font face="Arial,Helvetica">,
and then run</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>% xmodmap temp.map</font></tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>this will map the copyright
character to the shifted 2-key. Now fire up the GIMP and you will be able
to generate the copyright character when using a font which supports it.&nbsp;
To get your keyboard back to normal, edit the temp.map file:</font></font>
<blockquote><tt><font size=-1>keysym 2 = 2 at</font></tt></blockquote>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>and again run xmodmap.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Alternatively, you can use
a graphical interface to map lots of keys all at once.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.jwz.org/xkeycaps/">xkeycaps</a>
tool, written by Jamie Zawinski of Mozilla/Netscape fame, gives you a graphical
display of your keyboard and allows you to map multiple characters to single
keys when those keys are used with various modifiers (such as CTRL or ALT).</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>If you make one of your keys
be a <i>Mode_switch</i> key, you can add two more characters to pretty
much every key that produces a character.&nbsp; For people that use international
characters, but want to use the US keyboard layout, you can make a key
a <i>Multi_key</i> and do sequences like <i>Multi_key-`-e</i> to get an
e with a grave accent on it<a href="#lyle">(2</a>).</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Xkeycaps has to know about
your keyboards physical configuration, but fortunately its been around
for so long (since about 1991) and so many people have provided configurations
for so many keyboards that there is a good chance your keyboard will be
available.&nbsp; Even if its not, you can edit a configuration file in
order to add your keyboard to the list of keyboards.</font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1></font></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I didn't have time to explore
this very useful application any further than this but plan when time permits.&nbsp;
For the most part I don't have a need to access any keys outside of those
available from my Dell keyboard.&nbsp; Still, occassionaly it would be
nice to have access to accent marks, copyright symbols and other symbols
for use in both my word processor as well as in the Gimp.</font></font>
