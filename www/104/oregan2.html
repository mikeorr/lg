<h1>Desktop Matters!: A guide to Windows technologies for Linux users</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>

<p>
<p> A reasonable question, and one which will not go unasked (no matter how 
well I explain this!), is: "Why should Linux users read about Windows 
technologies?"

<p> The main answer is: because so much development on Linux is influenced 
by Windows. Windows is the most common platform at the moment; most new
users coming to Linux are coming from Windows, but more importantly, so are
a lot of new developers. 

<p> Now, I don't mean to suggest that the technologies presented here 
originated in Windows, or that the equivalents available on Linux are
limited to merely following the Windows version. In many cases, especially
in the desktop, Linux technologies are arguably better, though in other
cases, arguably worse. 

<p> The main motivation behind writing this is to have a document to point
to when writing about desktop topics. I have already <a 
href="../issue97/oregan2.html">compared DCOP to OLE Automation</a>; Tom Brown 
has <a href="brown.html">also made this comparison</a>. As many articles on
desktop topics are written with the intention of introducing former Windows
users to Linux, I feel it is helpful to have a glossary of sorts to point 
them to.

<p> I also feel there would be no harm in introducing long-time Linux users
to the concepts of Windows, to better aid those who would attempt to aid
these new users, and to help them to understand why some software is
designed the way it is. For example, most Linux types dismiss Visual Basic,
without understanding <em>why</em> Visual Basic is useful to Windows
developers.

<h2>A note about Wine</h2>

<p> Most people know about <a href="http://www.winehq.com">Wine</a>, even
if only vaguely. Wine is an implementation of the Windows API, with a
loader for Windows binaries. Using Wine, many Windows applications can be
run on Linux; and several open source projects for Windows can be compiled
using Winelib.

<p> One problem with Wine is that it can't be used as a regular Unix
library, because it has to be binary compatible with Windows to work.
Because of this, you can't link to Wine to get an easy DLL loader. Work is
being done in this area: Mono is using Wine to develop its implementation
of .Net's Windows Forms, and Ardour.

<p> Another, larger problem, is that the Windows API contains several
hacks to support backwards compatibility. After I started writing this, 
Slashdot posted <a 
href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">this article</a>, 
which provides me with a way of explaining why Wine has such a hard task in 
implementing the Windows API:

<blockquote>
I first heard about this from one of the developers of the hit game
SimCity, who told me that there was a critical bug in his application: it
used memory right after freeing it, a major no-no that <em>happened</em> to
work OK on DOS but would not work under Windows where memory that is freed
is likely to be snatched up by another running application right away. The
testers on the Windows team were going through various popular 
applications, testing them to make sure they worked OK, but SimCity kept
crashing. They reported this to the Windows developers, who disassembled
SimCity, stepped through it in a debugger, found the bug, and <em>added
special code</em> that checked if SimCity was running, and if it did,
<em>ran the memory allocator in a special mode in which you could still use
memory after freeing it</em>.
</blockquote>

<p> Yet another problem is that much of Windows is undocumented. From the
article quoted above, I was lead to <a 
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">the weblog of Raymond Chen</a>,
one of the developers of Windows, where I found <a
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/23/45481.aspx#45741">this
quote</a> from another Windows developer, which explains why: "The reason
we can't publish the structures is that it precludes our changing them
FOREVER. I mean FOREVER." (<a 
href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/19/44644.aspx">This
page</a> has more comments on this, though the main story is pretty
amusing, considering that many people could be forgiven for thinking that 
this is what Microsoft does).

<h2>Language integration</h2>

<p> One of the reasons behind the design of Windows is the goal of language
integration. Most of the technologies in Windows seem to have been written
for Visual Basic, but were made part of the operating system so that other
languages could take advantage of them. This places an extra burden on
language developers, but makes life easier for the developers who use these
languages.

<p> On Windows, a developer can access a COM object just as easily from
Python as they can from C++ or Visual Basic. On Linux, they have several
hoops to jump through first. A Perl or Python programmer who wants to use a
C library must find a wrapper for their language first; if one is not
available, they must write one of their own. A C programmer wishing to
access a C++ library must write a wrapper library in C++, which exposes
functions which may be called from C. 

<p> There are equivalents available; Perl's Inline modules allow Perl 
programmers to embed other languages inside Perl code. This allows the reuse 
of libraries, no matter what language they are written in; but it
also requires you to be able to write enough of another language to access
the functions you want.

<p> <a href="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</a>'s use of CORBA allows for
language integration on a similar level to that present on Windows,
especially with the <a 
href="http://search.cpan.org/~hrogers/CORBA-ORBit-0.4.7/">Perl</a> and <a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/orbit-python/">Python</a> bindings, but
unfortunately these came too late. As it is, it is possible to fully access
any CORBA object in GNOME, and to write CORBA servers, in both Perl and Python, 
but CORBA has all but been discarded from GNOME as a mechanism for
calling functions. Ximian have focused their attention on Mono as a means
of getting this integration, while other GNOME developers are looking at <a 
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/dbus">D-BUS</a>.

<p> OpenOffice.org and Mozilla <em>have</em> got the sort of framework which
allows the same level of language integration as Windows. This is not
surprising though, as both UNO and XPCOM have designs based on COM's.

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p> Of much more importance is the compatibility between the various aspects
of Windows. In Linux, though there are equivalents available for every 
individual part of Windows, these come from different projects, and several
of these parts are incompatible.

<p> There are three main collections of office software for Linux; OpenOffice,
KOffice, and GNOME Office. Because components are incompatible, if I use KWord,
I can't use Gnumeric for my embedded sales figures. I have to use KSpread. If
I use OOCalc, I can't have an embedded Dia drawing.

<p> As I mentioned, KDE, GNOME, OpenOffice, and Mozilla each have different
component systems. Now, the situation isn't as bad as it could have been, 
as the nice people at Sun have written software to allow OpenOffice to be 
used as a Bonobo component, as a Netscape plugin, and to access XPCOM
components, which they use for various purposes; and KDE have a technology
called XParts which allows non-KDE components to be embedded as KParts
(though not without a little hacking - only Mozilla is supported, though
there is also the <a
href="http://kde.openoffice.org/cuckooo/index.html">Cuckooo</a> project to
use OOo as a KPart), as well as <a
href="http://dot.kde.org/1073668213/">QtGtk</a>, which allows Gtk
apps to use Qt dialogues - software using this library could, for example, 
display the KDE file dialogue, which allows KDE's IOSlaves to work within the 
GNOME app (Ars Technica has an <a 
href="http://arstechnica.com/reviews/004/software/kde-3.2/kde-3.2-01.html">overview</a> 
of KDE's technologies). There is also a <a 
href="http://www.nongnu.org/moz-bonobo/">Bonobo plugin</a> for Mozilla. 

<p> Other compatibility problems exist; but these are being tackled, mainly 
due to the work of <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a>. 
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/gtk-qt">Gtk-Qt</a> is an example
of this in action; it unifies the themes of Gtk and Qt, so users can have a
common look on their desktop. 

<h2>Visual Basic</h2>

<p> Now, when I say Visual Basic, I mean the component-oriented type of 
programming which VB allows, which can easily apply to Delphi, or any other
programming language available for Windows. But VB is the most popular
language on Windows, so I use it for the purposes of this article.

<p> There are several reasons behind the popularity of Visual Basic: Graphical
GUI design, simple syntax, easy access to COM objects, and easy access to DLLs
written in C. GUI designers are available for Linux: there's Glade for GNOME,
QtDesigner for KDE, etc. Simple syntax is also not a problem: Python has at
least the same level of simplicity. 

<p> That leaves access to components, and to libraries. Access to libraries 
isn't much of a problem, as for most common libraries, it's only a matter of 
time before someone writes a wrapper. Access to components, as mentioned 
earlier, is possible, but your choice is limited.

<p> For a VB programmer, it's a common task to use Internet Explorer to grab 
some figures from a web site, use Excel to perform calculations on
them, insert them into an Access database, mail them with Outlook etc. It's
just as easy to grab those figures from Mozilla, to use Lotus 123 for
calculations etc. (Though I should note that in reality, most people won't
<em>want</em> to use components from other desktops/office suites).

<p> On the plus side, there are technologies such as <a
href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/sashxb/">Sash
XB</a> out there!

<h2>.Net</h2>

<p> .Net is Microsoft's newest baby. .Net languages target the CLR, or Common 
Language Runtime, which is like the Java runtime, but with
extensions to support several languages. Programs written in one .Net
language can access libraries written in another through the CLR. 

<p> .Net, especially when considered with C#, is seen by many as Microsoft's 
reaction to losing the lawsuit Sun brought against them after
they made incompatible changes to Java. .Net, however, is also an
extension to the COM + VB programming environment which Microsoft already
had. It provides a class library with all of the different facilities of
the Windows/COM API, which the <a href="http://www.go-mono.com">Mono</a>
team are making great effort at implementing.

<p> There are two important things about .Net from a Linux point of view;
firstly, that there are <em>two</em> projects which aim to implement it:
Mono and DotGNU <a 
href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html">Portable .Net</a>; 
secondly, that Microsoft is designing a completely new API for it, so that
these projects have less catching up to do than the Wine project does. 

<p> Plus, if you want to have an embeddable virtual machine which supports
several languages, and will most likely have a large and varied class 
library, you can always follow the progress of <a 
href="http://www.parrotcode.org/">Parrot</a>, which is still being
designed, but will host Perl 6 and (a version of) Python by the time it's 
finished.

<h2>The technologies</h2>

<a name="dde"></a>
<h3>DDE</h3>

<p> DDE, or Dynamic Data Exchange, is a protocol which allows Windows 
applications to exchange data. Data is exchanged in the form of short
messages, which contain either a short item of data, or a pointer to a 
location in memory where this data is available.

<p> DDE is deprecated.

<a name="ole"></a>
<h3>OLE</h3>

<p> OLE stands for Object Linking and Embedding. OLE was originally intended to
complement DDE, and to provide a simple method of linking files, so that. for 
example a spreadsheet linked from a word processor would have the latest 
figures; and embedding the application, so that the user would be able to edit
the spreadsheet without exiting the word processor.

<p> On Linux, KDE has KParts, while GNOME has Bonobo. Bonobo is quite similar
to the Windows design, as it uses CORBA interfaces which are very much like the
interfaces used in Windows. KParts however, is a much simpler technology. A
KPart is a shared library written in C++ which implements an interface. This
library is accompanied by an XML file which describes the menu items the
KPart provides. This allows for similar embedding, with a much less 
complicated framework. KParts use DCOP to communicate with each other.

<a name="vbx"></a>
<h3>VBX</h3>

<p>VBX, or Visual Basic eXtensions, also called "custom controls", were 
introduced as a way of extending Visual Basic. Built on the embedding of OLE,
custom controls were intended as a way of allowing component reuse. Controls
could be added to the form (the "canvas" of VB's GUI designer) of a program,
where they provided customised GUI elements, with their own properties and
methods. For example, a VB programmer wishing to display an image would include
an image control, setting the appropriate property to provide the location of
the image. 

<p>VBX is an obsolete technology.

<a name="oleaut"></a>
<h3>OLE Automation</h3>

<p>OLE Automation is a set of COM interfaces used to present functions in an
<a href="#ocx">ActiveX</a> object, or other program, in a standard way.
Automation also provides a system like Java's reflection. This is used in
VB to provide code completion, for example.

<p> Despite Eric Raymond's <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch03s02.html#nt_contrast">assertion</a>
that "Most programs cannot be scripted at all. Programs rely on complex,
fragile remote procedure call (RPC) methods to communicate with each other",
most large programs <em>do</em> provide OLE interfaces. (See <a
href="#com">DCOM</a> to find out about the RPC part.

<a name="ocx"></a>
<h3>OCX/ActiveX</h3>

<p> OCX, or OLE Control eXtensions, were an extended version of VBX designed
for 32-bit versions of Windows. VBX was a popular idea, and Borland's Delphi 
was able to use them. This, perhaps, convinced Microsoft that the idea would 
prove useful in their other languages, so they made OCXs a part of Windows.

<p> OCX was later rebranded ActiveX, though this term was later used to refer
to COM and other related technologies, when Microsoft extended Internet 
Explorer to act as an OCX container, as a reaction to Java applets and
Netscape plugins. ActiveX components could be run on demand, like applets,
but could also be installed, like plugins. Microsoft didn't pay as much 
attention to security as Sun did, though, and after the bad publicity ActiveX's
security received, few use them as anything other than plugins.

<p> <a 
href="http://webcvs.kde.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/kdenonbeta/reaktivate/">Reaktivate</a>
is a KDE extension which uses Wine to allow ActiveX controls in Konqueror. 
There is a <a href="http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/plugin.htm">Mozilla 
ActiveX plugin</a>, but as this is a Windows plugin, you'll either need to
have the Crossover plugin (and note that this is no longer sold separately from
Crossover Office), or install the Windows version of Mozilla using Wine. (The
Wine project eventually wish to use the Mozilla code, but as the current code
is written using ATL, this would involve a large rewrite).

<p> For equivalents, see <a href="#ole">OLE</a>, though it's worth noting 
that with Mozilla, it's now possible to write ActiveX-like components in Java.

<a name="axscript"></a>
<h3>Active Script</h3>

<p> Active Script is an OLE technology which allows scripting languages to be 
used in any "host" application. This was (probably) a result of the work being 
done to add Javascript to Internet Explorer in addition to ASP. Active Script
languages can access any function exposed through <a href="#oleaut">Automation</a>.

<p> The result is, for example, Perl in ASP and Python in web pages. 

<p> OpenOffice.org has a similar technology. Mono and Parrot will probably add
this on a widespread basis.

<a name="com"></a>
<h3>COM/DCOM</h3>

<p> COM, or Component Object Model, is an extension to OLE which also took in
OCX, based on a modified version of DCE/RPC. Previously, object interfaces
were specified using ODL (Object Description Language); with COM, these
were specified using DCE IDL, with an extended syntax. DCOM stands for 
"Distributed COM". The only real difference here is that when an object is
accessed on the same machine, it is accessed in the same way as a C++ class is,
but if the object is on another machine, the RPC mechanism is used.

<p> In Linux land, Samba implements quite a lot of DCOM. They are currently
working on making it easier to write programs which use the Samba 
infrastructure to access DCOM objects. There is a lot of work going on in Wine
at the moment which is aimed at getting RPC working.

<p> DCOP is based on X's libICE, and Bonobo is based on CORBA, so both KDE and
GNOME are as network transparent as Windows when it comes to accessing remote
objects.

<a name="asp"></a>
<h3>ASP</h3>

<p> ASP, Active Server Pages, is an <a href="#axscript">Active Script</a>
based way of generating web pages. 

<p> There have been several attempts to clone ASP for Linux. <a 
href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/chilisoft/">Sun Java System Active 
Server Pages</a> (formerly SunONE ASP, formerly Chilisoft ASP) is possibly the 
best known, though it is a proprietary product. 

<p> Of open source attempts, there are <a 
href="http://www.tripi.com/arrowhead/">Arrowhead ASP</a>, a Java 
implementation, which requires all objects to be reimplemented in Java (though
if Wine becomes usable as a library, <a 
href="http://jawinproject.sourceforge.net/">Jawin</a> could remove this 
requirement); <a href="http://asp2php.naken.cc/">ASP2PHP</a>, which converts
ASP (VBscript) to PHP; and ASP.NET in Mono.

<a name="ado"></a>
<h3>ADO</h3>

<p> ADO, Active Data Objects, is an Automation based interface to databases,
similar to Perl's DBI. ADO is based on OLE DB, an earlier framework aimed at
systems programmers. OLE DB is little used, as it is a very complicated, low 
level API, though programmers who wish to provide access to a new database 
must first write an "OLE DB Provider" (to continue with the Perl comparison, 
this is similar to a DBD module) before ADO programmers can use the database. 

<p> GNOME's <a href="http://www.gnome-db.org/">GNOME DB</a> is an ADO 
influenced library, which is similar enough that Mono used it to implement 
their version of ADO.NET. KDE, through the Qt library it's based on, also has 
a set of libraries for accessing databases.

<a name="jdirect"></a>
<h3>J/Direct</h3>

<p> Worth a brief mention, J/Direct is the extension to Java that Sun sued
Microsoft over. J/Direct provided extra syntax for Javadoc comments which
specified how a DLL function or COM object was to be accessed, as well as a 
set of attributes for compiled Java classes.

<p> This technology is obsolete now, but lives on in Microsoft's J# for .Net.
Portable .Net provides a Java compiler, though it doesn't accept either 
J/Direct or J# extensions; neither does <a 
href="http://weblog.ikvm.net/">IKVM</a>, a Java VM for .Net which comes with
Mono.
