<P> <HR> <P>  

<P>The Linux certification saga continues. In my <a 
href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue33/york.html"> October
article</a>, I outlined
why I thought Linux needs a certification program and what I thought the
major characteristics of such a program should be. In my
<a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue34/york.html"> November
article</a>,
I described what efforts were already underway toward Linux
certification,
provided pointers to resources on the Web, and explained how people
could
become further involved. With this article, I would like to relay
the current status of our discussions, and provide additional pointers
to information and resources.</P>

<HR WIDTH="100%"><A NAME="linux-cert"></A><H2>Status of
&quot;linux-cert&quot;
discussion list</H2>

<P>In last month's article, I mentioned a &quot;linux-cert&quot; mailing
list that was established to host further discussions on creating a
Linux
certification program. That list is operational and has had a strong
volume
throughout the last month. There has truly been too much discussion to
adequately summarize, although the points of consensus mentioned below
should give you a flavor of the list. People have been contributing from
all around the world and it has been great to be a part of it all!</P>

<P>If you would like to subscribe, send a message to:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A
HREF="mailto:majordomo@linuxcare.com">majordomo@linuxcare.com<BR>
<BR>
</A>&nbsp;&nbsp; with the message:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subscribe linux-cert<BR>
<BR>
Messages to the discussion list are sent to
&quot;linux-cert@linuxcare.com&quot;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
The list is intended for people who *want* to build a certification
program.&nbsp;
This is not another place to discuss whether or not a Linux
certification
program *should* exist... subscribers to the list agree that, yes, we
want
a Linux certification program - now let's discuss how best to build
one.</P>

<P>We now have two sites that are hosting web-based archives of the
mailing
list where you can view what has been discussed on the
&quot;linux-cert&quot;
list. Dave Sifry at Linuxcare set up our primary archive at his site.
You
can see every message from the beginning of the list at: </P>

<P>Bruce Dawson also set up a second site to see the messages (albeit
over
a slower connection) at:</P>

<P>Thanks are due to both Dave and Bruce for setting these archives up.

<P>Please visit the archives, see what we're up to, and join in our
efforts.</P>

<H2><A NAME="linux-cert-announce"></A>New List -
&quot;linux-cert-announce&quot;</H2>

<P>After we set up the &quot;linux-cert&quot; list, I had several people
contact me and say that they were interested in staying up on what was
going on with Linux certification, but didn't want to subscribe to a
high-volume
mailing list. To address this concern, we have now established a second
list, &quot;linux-cert-announce&quot;, which will be a <I>very</I> low
volume list (probably only a few postings per month). We will only send
occasional status reports and announcements to this &quot;announce&quot;
list. It is a moderated list with a limited number of possible senders,
so there will be no extra traffic or spam.</P>

<P>If you would like to subscribe to this list, send a message to:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A
HREF="mailto:majordomo@linuxcare.com">majordomo@linuxcare.com<BR>
<BR>
</A>with the message:<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subscribe linux-cert-announce</P>

<P>in the message body. Thanks again to Dave Sifry at Linuxcare for
setting
up this second list.</P>

<P>Note that if you subscribe to &quot;linux-cert&quot;, you do
<B>not</B>
need to also subscribe to &quot;linux-cert-announce&quot;. Any message
sent to &quot;linux-cert-announce&quot; will automagically be sent to
the
&quot;linux-cert&quot; mailing list. </P>

<P>So... subscribe to &quot;linux-cert&quot; if you want to be involved
with the ongoing discussions and receive a strong volume of email,
subscribe
to &quot;linux-cert-announce&quot; if you only want to get occasional
updates
on the current status of certification discussions and plans.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="lta"></A>Linux Training Alliance</H2>

<P>In order to promote the teaching of classes in Linux, I am organizing
an alliance of training centers who either are currently or are planning
to teach Linux classes. We now have a web site located at:</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <A
HREF="http://www.linuxtraining.org/">http://www.linuxtraining.org/</A></P>

<P>The goals of the organization and Web site include:</P>

<UL>
<LI>to provide a central place on the Internet where potential students
can learn about available Linux training resources</LI>

<LI>to publicize the classes of those training centers currently
offering
Linux training</LI>

<LI>to be a resource for other training centers that want to start
teaching
Linux classes</LI>

<LI>to promote the ongoing efforts to create a Linux certification
program</LI>

<LI>to prove to courseware publishers that if they create Linux
courseware
there would be centers who would potentially purchase their
materials</LI>

<LI>to provide another way to combat the argument made against Linux
that
&quot;there is no support&quot;</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you are interested in Linux training, please visit the site and
let
me know what you think (it's pretty basic so far).</P>

<P>If you are affiliated with a training center (loosely defined as a
corporate
training center, college, university or basically anyone else currently
teaching Linux) and would like to be listed on the site (and join the
LTA),
please contact me at <A
HREF="mailto:dyork@Lodestar2.com">dyork@Lodestar2.com</A>.</P>

<P>If you are an freelance/contract instructor who would be available to
teach classes in Linux, of if you have developed courseware in Linux
that
would be available to other training centers, please contact me as I
would
like to publicize your contact information as well.</P>

<A NAME="cp"></A><H2>Points of Consensus from the &quot;linux-cert&quot;
discussion list</H2>

<P>Our discussion on the &quot;linux-cert&quot; mailing list has been
quite
involved and detailed with numerous points being debated quite intensely
at times (check out the archive mentioned above). In recent days, I have
asked the list to approve a number of &quot;Consensus Points&quot; that
I have summarized from the ongoing discussions. Realizing that we will
not always be able to reach consensus on every issue, we are working out
a method of voting. In the meantime, I&nbsp;have been trying to collect
the points on which we do all agree. The process is continuing as this
article is being written, but so far the following points have been
agreed
upon:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The cost of attaining Linux certification shall be as low as
possible.
Costs of exams shall be targeted at only that needed to cover delivery
of the exam, with perhaps a slight portion helping to offset development
of the exam.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Whatever mechanism we develop for delivering Linux certification
must
be global in scale. People in any nation must be able to take exams
toward
certification.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>The Linux certification program will consist of multiple levels. For
instance, after perhaps 1 or 2 exams, someone becomes a &quot;Linux
Certified
Professional&quot;. After 2 or 3 more, one becomes a &quot;Linux
Certified
Administrator&quot;, etc. (Note that we have NOT agreed upon
names.)</LI>
</UL>

<P>Additionally, the following points appear headed toward consensus
(but
have not, as of 11/25/98, been approved by the group):</P>

<UL>
<LI>The Linux certification program will employ standardized
multiple-choice
exams for at least the entry and perhaps middle certification levels.
The
highest certification level will involve either a hands-on or oral exam
of the candidate. The exact mechanism for the upper level test will be
determined by a working group.<BR>
</LI>

<LI>Linux certification exams will initially be developed in the English
language. Exams in other languages will be made available as soon as
possible
depending upon financial and conversion support. <BR>
</LI>

<LI>The core Linux certification program will be distribution-neutral.
Distribution differences will be addressed through a required
distribution-specific
exam or other mechanism developed by a working group. </LI>
</UL>

<P>We did not reach consensus on another point, and there are a number
of other items which we cannot yet agree upon.</P>

<P>If you are interested in being part of this process, please join the
&quot;linux-cert&quot;&nbsp;mailing list mentioned above and visit the
web archives to see what has already been discussed.
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<H2><A NAME="wg"></A>Working groups close to formation</H2>

<P>In the process of debating these consensus points, several
participants
have suggested we form smaller &quot;working groups&quot;&nbsp;to refine
specific subjects and report back to the larger group. It looks at this
point that at least one group will be launched to develop some proposals
for naming conventions (i.e. &quot;Linux Certifed Professional&quot;?
&quot;Linux
Certified Engineer?&quot; etc.) and also to explore some possible
options
for the non-computer-based test for the highest level of certification.
Other groups will also be launched as our efforts continue.</P>

<P>If you are interested in being involved with this working group,
please
join the &quot;linux-cert&quot; mailing list mentioned above.</P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<H2>Final Thoughts</H2>

<P>This past few weeks on the mailing list has been quite an interesting
one. The global scale of this project has brought in a wide variety of
contributors and made for interesting discussions.  It's been a great
group of people to work with and I look forward to our evolving
discussions
and plans. </P>

<P>Along the way, we also
discovered another group coordinated by Evan Leibovitch from the
<a href="http://www.linux.ca/">Canadian Linux User's Exchange (CLUE)
</a>
that had been discussing Linux certification
since earlier this year. Evan and I have now been working together to
combine
the expertise from both groups and it has been a great experience - look
for more exciting news and opportunities to come soon!</P>

<P>Please join us on the list(s) and let's make this happen!</P>
