Thanks, and thanks for the link <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Would you mind if I forwarded your e-mail to Linux Gazette? LG has a
lot of Indian readers, and maybe we can recruit some others who would
be interested in helping with an Indian language pair.
</p>

<p>
Also, I note from your blog that you have lttoolbox installed, and
that you can read Devanagari - we have a Sanskrit analyser that uses
Latin transliteration; I tried to write a transliterator to test it
out, but, alas, it doesn't work, and I can't tell why.

<p>
It's in our 'incubator' module in SVN, here:

So, basically: Apertium has analysers for Sanskrit, Hindi and Urdu
that look to be relatively "complete". Alone, they could be useful as,
for example, stemmers for Lucene - Felipe, one of our developers (who
received his doctorate this week - congratulations!) wrote code to
allow the output of our analysers to be used by Lucene, as well as
adding other linguistically-oriented features to Lucene - code
available here: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1284">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1284</a>
</p>

<p>
What would be really great would be if we could find either GPLd
bilingual dictionaries, or, better, volunteers to help work on
translators. We can help to write translation rules[1], but we need
native speakers to tell us which rules need to be written.
</p>


<p>
[1] Francis Tyers, our 'community coordinator' and I (99% him, but
still...) have been working on an early alpha level Welsh-English
translator, despite neither of us being able to speak a word of Welsh.
It's very basic, but already gives better results than the only other
Welsh-English translator we can find:
</p>

<p>
	Roedd y Comisiwn yn ymchwilio i'r honiadau bod yr AS wedi methu
datgan Â£103,000 o roddion.
</p>

<p>
    the Commission Was investigating the allegations that the MP has
failed to declare Â£103,000 of gifts. (Apertium)
</p>

<p>
    "He was the Commission crookedly ymchwiliad I ' group claims be he
drives ACE has failed declare he gifts." (InterTran)
</p>

<p>
(Our translation uses two of my rules <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Two of the best resources for Welsh on the Internet are Kevin
Donnelly's Eurfa (<a href="http://www.eurfa.org.uk/">http://www.eurfa.org.uk/</a>) and Mark Nodine's
dictionary (<a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/fun/welsh/LexiconForms.html">http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/fun/welsh/LexiconForms.html</a>) - and
both of them have granted us permission to use their data under the
GPL, as well as providing us with comments and feedback (in addition,
Kevin did the export of his database himself, saving us some trouble).
</p>

<p>
There are quite a lot of GPLd resources out there, for a lot of
languages. Unfortunately, a lot of dictionaries, etc. are basically
useless to us - MT lexicons are quite different from standard
dictionaries in a number of respects. We have tools that can, for
example, induce cognates using the same techniques as spell checkers,
but this can give as many misses as hits, and because these lists need
to be manually checked and edited afterwards, I've found that it's
actually quicker to just use the spell checker for L2 on a list of
words from L1.
</p>

<p>
(And even when this does work, it can give less than optimal results:
the Polish 'pies' would be added as 
 '&#1087;&#1105;&#1089;' in Russian,
but '&#1089;&#1086;&#1073;&#1072;&#1082;&#1072;' is the preferred
translation, for example)

&gt;&gt; Also, I note from your blog that you have lttoolbox
&gt;&gt; installed, and
&gt;&gt; that you can read Devanagari - we have a Sanskrit analyser
&gt;&gt; that uses
&gt;&gt; latin transliteration; I tried to write a transliterator to
&gt;&gt; test it
&gt;&gt; out, but, alas, it doesn't work, and I can't tell
&gt;&gt; why.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; It's in our 'incubator' module in SVN, here:
&gt;&gt; <a href="http://apertium.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/apertium/trunk/apertium-sa-XX/apertium-sa-XX.ucs-wx.xml">http://apertium.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/apertium/trunk/apertium-sa-XX/apertium-sa-XX.ucs-wx.xml</a>
&gt;&gt;
&gt;
&gt; I was introduced to apertium as part of NLP summer school last month, let me grab that module and look at it.
&gt;
&gt; Please kindly mention why/what did work with the transliterator you created.
</pre>

<p>
We have a Sanskrit analyser that uses WX notation. I made a
transliterator that converts UTF-8 Devanagari to WX notation, as input
(so we could benefit from FSTs, rather than using Python or something
similar to perform the conversion); however, some of the combined
ligatures aren't being processed properly - it's transliterating in
part, but some UTF characters are still coming through. I can't read
devanagari, so I can't tell if I'm missing something, or what the
problem might be.
