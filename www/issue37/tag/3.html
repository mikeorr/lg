Dear Answerguy,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
A Quickie: (please read this!)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
WHERE THE HELL CAN I GET THE GRAPHICAL TERMINAL ETERM??? (The
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
new replacement for rxvt, you know, the one that supports pixmaps
....not the terminal mode of emacs, great as that is).  I can't
find it anywhere, it's not in the sunsite or GNU ftp archives,
it's mentioned in some HOWTOS, but with no reference as to how to
obtain it. Is it part of commercial X distributions only or
something?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
yours confusedly, Liam.
</STRONG></P>

As far as I know Eterm is the Enlightenment inspired
xterm.  The fastest way to find files like this these days
is the Freshmeat QuickSearch feature.  This lead me right to
Eterm and its web home page at:

A Comment: (linux SUPERGRAN)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
On a personal note, my familiy in London who know LESS THAN
NOTHING about computers, got their first PC (assembled by me) for
Christmas, and are all using a pleasent Linux/<A 
HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>/Netscape+Applixware combo 
which they aver they find much easier
to use than "those funny computers at the university" (-
i.e. basic win95+Novell/IE/MSOffice monstrosity). Obvoiusly I set
it all up and do 100% of the sysadmin, but still even my GRAN uses
it (with my sisters help!) for e-mail &amp; browsing. They are quite
pleased that it never crashes

On My Soapbox: (consign to <TT>/dev/null</TT> now if looks 
too long &amp;or boring)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Great column! Nice to see someone with the patience to answer
those 'naieve' (i.e. uninformed!) newbie questions of the general
form "So what's this Linux all about, can I run it on a PC ..."
e.t.c.  A waste of time and annoyance to old-timer hacks and busy
developers it may be, but if the OS community is to get the
message accros to joe public as well as relative "techies"
(sys-admins, businessmen, university students like myself...) in
the rapidly accelerating battle for hearts and minds; it is vital
that everyone makes an effort to encourage outsiders to give it a
try. There is an hightened level in media attention in OS &amp; Linux
right now which will not neccesairily last forever, and an
exciting window of opportunity with the rapid development of
'user-freindly' desktop environments such as KDE and 
<A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A>. It is
all too much to ask of one poor Answerguy! Indeed it is an issue
that needs attention from the OS community with hopefully a more
rounded systematic approach developed: the risk of inaction is
that growth of Linux in the home/light use market does not come
quickly enough, and home/light users get locked into a depressing
windows 2000 (NT5) "development" cycle, (if windows 2000 actually
gets off the ground by 2010 that is!).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Two years ago I myself was converted to the 'light side of the
force'and became a newbie (perhaps I still am), and if it wasn't
for an achademic UNIX familiarity, and a good freind who was my
local guru and walked me through the first few weeks, I would not
be e-mailing you now (although a lot has changed in two years). I
have been pleased to spread Linux to four freinds since then,
(walking them through their first install e.t.c), and a healthy
informal Edinburgh LUG, has sprung up consisting mostly of
home-users. The growth has been phenomenal as all the 'statistics'
attest, but in the coming two years word-of-mouth will not be
enough.
</STRONG></P>

Glad you like it.  Please feel free to do your part in
the great tech support effort.  Join a users group
in your area.  Help out at the occasional installfest.
Jump into the newsgroups or onto the occasional mailing
list to <EM>answer</EM> a few questions when you can.

There are still some rough spots for us to go through.
However, I think that we'll make it.  Linux currently
enjoys about 2.5 percent of the <EM>desktop</EM> market according
to one of the recent surveys.  So that's our next goal.
We tripled our penetration into the server market last year
--- I think we can at least quadruple our share of the
desktop (for a total of 10%).  Talk to me after the Y2K
dust settles in 12 months and we'll see if we made that
goal.
