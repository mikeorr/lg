<p><strong>From Adam S Engel

</strong></p>
<p><strong>
I was hunting down  a "fugitive" process and accidently hit the BSD
command ps aux (thinking it was an accident because I'm using Mandriva,
which I thought was based on System V)
</strong></p>

In terms of Init level structures then it is, yes.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"

and received something like this:
</strong></p>

<pre><strong>~ 495 --&gt; ps aux | head -5

<p><strong>
But then, just for the hell of it, I hit the System V command, ps -ef
and got this:
</strong></p>

<pre><strong>~ 494 --&gt; ps -ef | head -5

<p><strong>
I thought most Linuxes, particularly the "big ones" like Fedore, <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>,
<a href="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</a>, Mandriva, were based on System V.

They are, but the ps command is an oddity in that sense.   Still useful,
though.

<img src="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)"

Even so, my MacOSX, based
loosely on BSD, will not accept the ps -ef command.  Can a system
(Mandriva in this case) be comprised of both?

All modern Unixes (except *BSD, which are holdouts) are the result of
(or inspired by) a shotgun marriage of those two cultures (plus SunOS),
called System V R4, released by AT&amp;T in 1988.  Quoting from the Unix FAQ:

Even prior to that, retrofitting "BSD enhancements" onto System V-based
systems was a nearly ubiquitous customisation:  Sys V R4 simply
acknowledged that reality, bowing to the technical community's mandate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The general architectural description of Sys V R4 got abstracted out as
the POSIX.1 specification, which served as the blueprint from much of
what Torvalds and co. (and FSF, and others) then performed in building up
what today we call GNU/Linux systems:  Linux distributions generally are
an independent implementation of (most of) the POSIX spec, which in turn
was based largely on Sys V R4.  And so, here we are.

See "man ps".  The 'ps' Linux uses has two sets of command-line
options to please everybody.  There are also verbose long options, and
two sets of output formats.

Linux generally follows the System V "style" but deviates whenever it

Amen to that.  Back when there was a <a href="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</a> Systems, Inc. (remember them?),
they kept trying to get Torvalds to accept a huge patch to add the
System V "STREAMS" interprocess I/O system.  Torvalds turned them down
flat, repeatedly, saying (and I paraphrase):  "Why would we need that
bloatware in our kernel, when Berkeley sockets already do that same job
at least as well?"

The init
system is not part of "Linux" (the kernel) but is chosen by each
distribution.  Most distros use System V style, and even those that
don't like <a href="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</a> have compatibility directories so that
vendor-compiled commercial programs can be installed without too much
hassle.  However, the init strategy is one of the most varying things
between distributions.

hard-drive space are far more than i need, so I'm installing SuSE,
Mandriva, and a third.  It was going to be Debian, but now I'm thinking
of <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>.  Can anyone tell me the major difference between FreeBSD and
Linux?

<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"

	> [Rick] 
Speaking in very broad terms, FreeBSD was designed and is maintained by
people who never liked AT&amp;T Unix or any of its derivatives and
independent reimplementations at all, and who thus were unsatisfied by
the System V R4 compromise.  Of course, that's hardly all there is to
it:  If you'd been sued, more or less baselessly, by a Fortune 500
corporation for copyright infringement, you'd probably develop an
attitude problem, too.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The difference in init scripts, you know about.  A minority of Linux
distributions have offered BSD init scripts, too, all along, e.g.,
Slackware, for those who like them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Additionally, there are such a large number of other small but
significant architectural differences that I cannot hope to remember
them all.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The BSDs tend to favour a "BSD slice"-type partition map, as opposed to
the IBM/Microsoft-style partition map more typical of Linux systems
(at least on IA32/x86-64).  Their directory layout is a bit different,
not very close to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard promoted by the
Linux community.  They tend to use variants on UFS as their main
filesystem.  (FreeBSD favours a variant called FFS = Fast Filesystem,
incorporating Marshall Kirk McKusick's softupdates instead of
journaling.  Softupdates are a clever and effective way to get most
of journaling's advantages in protecting metadata following crashes or
power loss -- but sadly does nothing about the problem of long fsck
times after such events.)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
They tend not to have anything resembling <tt>/proc.</tt>  They favour csh over
Bourne variants such as bash.  They favour nvi over vim.  They default
to use of the wheel group (which Linuxes usually lack mostly because
Stallman at FSF doesn't like the concept).  In general, their prejudices
tend to come across to Linux users as a bit old-fogey-ish.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
They offer both binary packages plus a very successful build-from-source
architecture called the "ports" system.  The closest thing to the latter
on Linux would be Gentoo's portage and the GAR build system (and similar
things in other build-from-source Linux distros).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
They have their own libc (not based on GNU's, as Linux always has been)
and their own implementation of make.  Otherwise, a lot of the userspace
toolsets are literally exactly the same (except compiled to a different
ELF binary format).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Spend some time reading "The FreeBSD Handbook", online:  It's a landmark
in clarity for technical documentation, and worth reading on that basis
alone.
</blockquote>
<p><strong>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)"

I've heard that FreeBSD is known for its security and other
network capabilities.

<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"
	> [Rick] 
FreeBSD is not <em>  especially  </em> known for security.  (You might be thinking
of <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>.)  I would say that it best known for scalable network
performance under heavy load, and for stability.  It's also known for
having relatively narrow scope of hardware compatibility (i.e., driver
selection), compared to Linux, and for relatively slow and conservative
development:  You may or may not find FreeBSD 6.0-STABLE's driver
support for your new Dell Dimension's chipsets to be adequate.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Specific comparisons of FreeBSD with typical Linux systems have been
done repeatedly, but tend to have the problem of being out of date
(which doesn't stop people from alluding to them, out of ignorance).
E.g., often-heard claims about better FreeBSD VM performance rely on
Linux 2.4.x results, back when Linux had a real problem, there.  For
that matter, Linux's entire TCP/IP stack has been thrown out and
rewritten four or five times during the kernel's history, so you can
imagine the large opportunity for outdated comparisons, there.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It used to be the case that FreeBSD's SCSI subsystem gave significantly
better performance than that of the Linux kernels, but I suspect that
difference, too, has been eliminated.  What probably does remain is the
matter of NFS/autofs/amd:  If you're a heavy NFS user, you'll find that
FreeBSD's NFSv3 implementation still has fewer bugs than Linux's, though
the gap is pretty small by now.

Some people say BSD's network stack can handle a higher load.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"
	> [Rick] 
That's largely on the basis of data like this 1999 event:
<a href="http://www.bafug.org/news/NewRecord.html"
	>http://www.bafug.org/news/NewRecord.html</a>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
At that time, Walnut Creek CD-ROM set the world record for most bytes of
network traffic processed in 24 hours by a single host:  One
single-processor PII box (a then-famous FreeBSD ftp server) handled 1.39
terabytes.  (This burst of traffic was, ironically, occasioned by the
release on that machine of Slackware 4.0.)
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Fast-forward:  About a year ago, I helped build what became the
second-fastest computational cluster in the world, "Thunder", a set of
1024 quad-Itanium2 Linux boxes.  The interconnects for node-to-node
data passing used Quadrics cards, and I don't have figures handy but it
was a stupendous level of network traffic.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"
	> [Sluggo] 
But
both systems are widely used in high-performance mission-critical
situations, so the difference is a bit academic.  Isn't Linux being
used for rocket control somewhere?
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Linux comes in a wide variety of flavors from user-compiled hacker
systems (Gentoo) to turnkey Windows clones (Linspire), with RPM/DEB
distros in between.  BSD sticks to the user-compiled route.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"
	> [Rick] 
Misconception.  It's actually probably more common, in practice, to
install software from the binary packages than to build it from ports.
I can tell you that BSD admins will often resource to packages when
there are local build problems, if nothing else.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"
	> [Sluggo] 
BSD also
tends to have less support for new hardware, and last time I checked
it had an incompatible disk-partitioning scheme, making dual booting a
problem.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"
	> [Rick] 
FYI:  FreeBSD (at least) is perfectly happy booting from an
IBM/Microsoft-style partition table.  For that matter, you can boot
Linux (but not MS-Windows) from a BSD "slice"-style disklabel.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<img src="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"
	height="28" width="50" border="0"
	> [Sluggo] 
But if a user-compiled distro appeals to you and you like
the BSD traditions, FreeBSD would be worth looking into.  That seems
to be the most popular one for new users, although <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> and OpenBSD
are also free and would be worth comparing.
