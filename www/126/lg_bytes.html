<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Will Oracle buy a Linux OS provider?</h3>

<p>"I don't see how we could possibly buy Red Hat... I'm not going to spend $5 
billion, or $6 billion, for something that can just be so completely wiped off 
the map," Ellison was quoted as saying in the FT. He also said that he had 
considered making an offer on Novell. </p>
<p>Ellison did mention supporting or buying a small distro and building it up 
for the Oracle user community. Ubuntu and Mandriva are possibilities cited by 
commentators.</p>
<p>"At some point we could very well choose to have Linux as part of the Oracle 
database server. We certify it, we test it. We could have JBoss as part of our 
middleware. It costs us nothing. We can do that, IBM can do that, HP can do that 
- anyone with a large support organization is free to take that intellectual 
property and embed it in their own products."</p>
<p>And: "Why didn't we buy JBoss? Because we don't have to. If it ever got good 
enough we'd just take the intellectual property - just like Apache - embed it in 
our fusion middleware suite, and we're done."</p>
<p>The full Financial Times story is here:

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Will Sun Open Source Java?</h3>

<p></p>
<p>The rumor mills are reporting internal debate at Sun over how far to go with 
its ongoing Open Source initiative, up to and including fully Open Sourcing Java. 
This is all motivated by need to make some statement of direction for the 
upcoming JavaOne conference in May. </p>
<p>With Sun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz newly settled in after the 
departure of Scott McNealy, the pressure to go the OSSw way is mounting. But the 
real issue is helping Sun's bottom line. </p>
<p>Sun has historically tried to prevent forking within the Java source tree to 
maintain its 'run everywhere' goal. On the other hand, Microsoft's C# borrows 
heavily from Java and is a major alternative. Also the work on Eclipse plugins 
and IDEs for scripting languages like PHP may be undercutting the position of 
Java in the developer community.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Introducing MySQL Forge</h3>

 
<p>MySQL AB has introduced MySQL Forge, a new Web site and community directory 
designed to support active MySQL-related open source development. Located at 
<a href="http://forge.mysql.com">http://forge.mysql.com</a>, MySQL Forge is a central online resource for all MySQL 
users and developers to communicate, collaborate and share MySQL code and 
applications.</p>
<p>MySQL now also supports Ubuntu, a popular version of Linux. In a keynote 
address at the 2006 MySQL Users Conference, Mark Shuttleworth, founder of the 
Ubuntu project, outlined the new partnership. Shuttleworth said, "The new 
partnership and technology support between MySQL and Ubuntu will make it much 
easier for our joint communities and customers to build and use everything from 
Web 2.0 applications to large, business-critical software, on the Ubuntu-MySQL 
platform." </p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linux Desktop goes to LSB 3.1</h3>

 
<p>At the recent Linux Desktop Summit in San Diego, the Free Standards Group 
announced support of the current Linux Standard Base (LSB) 3.1 standard for 
desktop applications by 14 Linux vendors. This is the first version of the LSB 
to include portable Linux desktop applications. The initial group, which is sure 
to grow, included Ubuntu, Xandros, Red Hat and Novell and system vendors Dell, 
HP and IBM.</p>
<p>LSB 3.1 also incorporates the recently approved ISO standard LSB Core 
(ISO/IEC 23360) into the standard.</p>
<p>Greater participation of Linux distribution vendors and upstream maintainers in 
the LSB development process will make it easier to synchronize roadmaps and improve 
binary compatibility. This initiative will be kicked off at the FSG Summit 
on June 1 and 2, 2006 in Boston with participants from major 
distributions, upstream maintainers and ISVs.</p>
<p>"LSB 3.1 is a big step forward for the Linux desktop. <a href="http://freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a> is 
looking forward to working closely together with the Linux Standard Base to 
drive even more desktop related technology into the next revision of LSB," said 
Waldo Bastian, a senior software architect at freedesktop.org.</p>
<p>"LSB-compliance is very important for Ubuntu," said Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu 
founder and chief developer. "We believe that Linux offers the world freedom of 
choice, freedom to innovate and freedom to localize. The Linux Standard Base is 
a crucial enabler of those freedoms, creating confidence in the standardization 
of the core platform while still preserving the ability of the platform to 
evolve and improve."</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SuSE flaws in KDE</h3>
 
<p>Several flaws and vulnerabilities in the desktop KDE environment have been 
discovered and patched in the latest release of SuSE. These could exploited by 
attackers to access sensitive information or run arbitrary code on an affected 
machine.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Novell buys security monitoring firm e-Security</h3>

 
<p>Novell has bought e-Security, a security information management and 
compliance monitoring firm, in a deal worth $72 million. e-Security's key 
product is Sentinel 5, a total-enterprise view of attacks and policy violations. 
Novell said this software provides "...Automated Compliance Monitoring and 
Reporting." </p>
<p>Novell estimates a positive revenue impact from the acquisition of roughly 
$20 million in the coming 12 months. Their webcast on the acquisition is

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">SCO include mobility services</h3>
 
<p>SCO has been seen on the conference circuit demonstrating two new mobility 
services they call VOTE and SHOUT. With Shout you can send a 60-second custom 
audio message to any number of people through a Web browser. Vote is an easy 
polling service that lets you gather instant opinions and manage feedback in a 
mobile environment. Both were demonstrated at recent conferences, including the 
MySQL user conference, as part of its 'Me, Inc.' initiative. [I picked up a free 
CD, but its trialware that times out in 60 days.] This also shows that they are 
still developing software.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM and the X Factor</h3>
 
<p>IBM has unveiled System X to replace its eServer X Series. The new x86 line 
includes the System x3800, x3850 and x3950 servers, will have virtualization 
switched on by default [previously it was off]. So the machines are 'virtually' 
the same as its xSeries 260 and up models.</p>
<p>IBM polled its customer base and learned that the majority of them would 
pursue data center virtualization projects with planned hardware projects. These 
servers will work with VMWare and Xen hypervisors.</p>

<h2><i>Magical Realism</i>... (non-Linux news of general interest)</h2>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Virus threatens both Linux and Windows </h3>
 
<p>Hackers have released proof-of-concept code for a virus that can infect both 
Linux and Windows systems. The virus, which was given the symmetric name 
'Virus.Linux.Bi.a/ Virus.Win32.Bi.a', was reported by security firm Kaspersky 
Lab. While it does not carry a malicious payload, security researchers there 
worry that this malware is part of a trend of viruses that can run on Windows 
and other operating systems. In this case, code infects both PE (Portable 
Executable) and ELF (Executable and Linking Format) file types. </p>
<p>Although this is worrying, it is not entirely without precedent. In 2001 the 
"ELF/Winux.2784" virus was also able to infect both Linux and Windows 
platforms.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Samsung Develops 3D Memory Package </h3>
 
<p>Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., a leader in advanced memory technology, has 
developed a small-footprint, wafer-level stack package (WSP) of high density 
memory chips using 'through silicon via' (TSV) interconnection technology. WSP 
reduces the physical size of a stacked set of semiconductor chips, while greatly 
improving overall performance. The next generation in package technologies, WSP 
can be applied to memory and processors to deliver higher speed and higher 
density packaging.</p>
<p>Using this technology, mobile device and consumer electronics manufacturers 
can make slimmer, high-performance handsets with longer battery time.</p>
<p>Samsung's industry-first WSP is a 16Gbit memory solution that stacks eight 
2Gb NAND chips. The WSP generates a much smaller multi-chip package (MCP), which 
is the current mainstream solution for designing miniaturized, high-capacity 
memory devices. Samsung's eight-chip WSP prototype sample, which vertically 
stacks eight 50-micrometer, 2Gb NAND flash dies, is 0.56 millimeters in 
height.</p>
<p>Samsung's WSP technology reduces production cost by using a tiny laser to 
drill the TSV holes. WSP also reduces the length of the interconnections, 
resulting in an approximately 30-percent increase in performance from reduced 
electrical resistance. This makes it attractive for applications requiring lower 
power consumption, higher performance and higher density, such as today's 
slimmer handset designs. Samsung will apply its WSP technology to mobile 
applications and consumer electronics in early 2007.</p>

<h3><img title="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Restraining Order Against the Geek Squad</h3>
 
<p>The Feds granted a request by Winternals Software for a temporary restraining 
order (TRO) requiring that Best Buy Co. and its Geek Squad subsidiary to stop 
using unlicensed versions of Winternals' software.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that Best Buy and Geek Squad used illegal copies of ERD 
Commander 2005, a system repair and data recovery tool that boots a dead 
computer into a Windows-like environment for rapid system recovery. The software 
helps restore deleted data, reset passwords, copy files to and from unbootable 
systems, edit the registry, and access Restore Points on a dead Windows 
computer. The software is regarded as the most complete set of administrative 
system tools available for the Windows professional.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, Winternals claimed that Best Buy and Geek Squad contacted 
Winternals in October 2005 about purchasing a license that would allow their 
12,000 employees to use Winternals' software in their jobs. The licensing would 
have covered most Geek Squad employees at a cost of several million dollars.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that during the next three months, Winternals and the 
defendants entered into a trial-and-test agreement. The complaint contends that, 
in February 2006, the defendants abruptly informed Winternals that they were no 
longer interested in pursuing a licensing agreement but still continued to use 
Winternals' software. </p>
