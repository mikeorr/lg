<h1>Fvwm</h1>

<!-- start: Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.fvwm.org">Fvwm</a>! I'm sure some of you remember it
quite well as a window manager of the days past - and you'd be forgiven for
thinking that it no longer existed. It is, perhaps, a shame that it has
been over-shadowed by the newer, glitzier desktop managers such as KDE and
GNOME, but I suppose that the times have changed. People are after more
eye-candy than even before - right?  Well, not me. While it may be true
that we all like pretty things, often these things come with a sacrifice.
The most noteworthy thing for me over the years has been that using KDE and
GNOME requires a supercomputer with tons of RAM, while Fvwm remains fast as
lighting on machines with even marginal resources. For those of us who wish
to get full usage out of our existing hardware instead of chasing the
ever-changing "latest and greatest" machinery with our hard-earned cash,
software such as Fvwm can be the factor that makes the key difference.</p>

<p>What separates a <em>window manager</em> from a <em>desktop
environment</em> is that the former does not have integrated applications
such as file managers and utilities to tweak the overall environment.
Instead, all such utilities are external - just as they should be. The job
of a window manager is just that; it manages windows.</p>

<p>Fvwm was <a href="http://www.fvwm.org/history.php">created</a> by Robert
Nation. It is based on code from 'twm' (Tom's Window Manager) which was at
the time perhaps the only real window manager available. Frustrated with
the lack of features and the fact that 'twm' was full of memory leaks, Rob
began hacking on it; the result was that Fvwm was kick-started in early
1993. Rob had, in fact, already made a name for himself as the author of
the popular terminal emulator <a
href="http://www.rxvt.org"target="_blank">rxvt</a>, which is still used by
a lot of people today.</p>

<p>What I intend to demonstrate here is how to start from a minimal
configuration of Fvwm and work upwards, discussing how Fvwm operates and
how to configure it to do various things. There is a lot to Fvwm, so this
won't be quick - but I hope it will be interesting nevertheless.</p>

<!-- end: introduction -->

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Since Fvwm has been bundled with every distribution that I have used,
chances that you have it anyway. You should not use Fvwm1, since this is
old and is no longer supported by the developers. Currently, the stable
version is <b>2.4.18</b> while the unstable version is <b>2.5.10</b>.
Unlike many classifications of stable/unstable, the unstable version of
Fvwm has never crashed for me, so I can recommend using it. Indeed, most of
what I will talk about over the next few months will rely on the features
in this version, and that are absent in the 'stable' version.</p>

<p>As a side note to using pre-compiled binaries, depending on the
distribution used, some features that I may mention might not be compiled
in. Therefore, if you want to have all the features that I'll be
discussing, you would be well advised to <a
href="ftp://ftp.fvwm.org/pub/fvwm/version-2/fvwm-2.5.10.tar.gz">download</a>
the unstable version and compile it. There's plenty of helpful information
in the README and INSTALL files.</p>

<h3>Features of Fvwm</h3>

<p>There are too many features to list, but as an overview of what Fvwm
provides, here are some of the more interesting ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full Enhanced Window Manager Hints support</li>
  <li>Virtual Desktops</li>
  <li>Full internationalisation</li>
  <li>Greatly improved font support, including anti-aliasing</li>
  <li>Improved decoration code</li>
  <li>Side titles, including vertical text</li>
  <li>Powerful WindowShade in all directions, including diagonal</li>
  <li>PNG support, including alpha blending</li>
  <li>Image rendering in colorsets</li>
  <li>Perl library for creating modules in Perl</li>
  <li>New module FvwmPerl to enable scripting in rc files</li>
  <li>Optional text shadows (looks nice with light text)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also <a href="../100/adam.html">session management</a> support
for those who want it.</p>

<!-- start: Starting Fvwm -->
<h3>Starting and Configuring Fvwm</h3>

<p>Fvwm's configuration is best done on a per-user basis, although a global
configuration is possible. When Fvwm loads, it looks for the following files
and will use the first one it finds:

<ul>
  <li>$HOME/.fvwm/config</li>
  <li>/usr/local/share/fvwm/config</li>
  <li>$HOME/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc</li>
  <li>$HOME/.fvwm2rc</li>
  <li>/usr/local/share/fvwm/.fvwm2rc</li>
  <li>/usr/local/share/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc</li>
  <li>/etc/system.fvwm2rc</li>
</ul>

<p>If no files are found, Fvwm loads with a default builtin menu. This can
initially be used to create a basic ~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc file, as shown by figure
1.</p>

<center>
  <img src="misc/adam/fvwm-startup.png" alt="Fvwm startup" /><br />
  <b>Figure 1: Fallback mode that Fvwm uses if no config files were found.</b>
</center>

<p>You can then reload Fvwm, and you'll have a bare-minimum config file.
By default, Fvwm takes on the appearance of <em>mwm</em> and although mwm's
style can be emulated completely, Fvwm's own internal style is to have raised
borders and a raised title, as shown in figure 2.</p>

<center>
  <img src="misc/adam/fvwm-initial2.png" alt="Fvwm's initial config" /><br />
  <b>Figure 2: Screenshot of the settings produced after the generated
    config.</b>
</center>

<p>You may well be thinking <em>"yuck!"</em> - and I wouldn't blame you.
There are certain things about it that are hideous, I know. But everything
you see in the screenshot is configurable. Of course, all actual window
management features are supported; there are menus, button bars, etc. Let's
take a closer look at what makes up a window.</p>

<h3>A window is a window is a window</h3>

<p>A window is a decorated screen frame containing the graphical interface
of a program. There are several characteristics of a window, some of which
are obvious and some not so obvious, all of which allow us to configure the
window's appearance. The structure of a typical window usually contains the
following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Title Bar</li>
  <li>Window Buttons</li>
  <li>Window Border</li>
</ul>

<p>A popular configuration is to have three buttons on the title bar. The
leftmost one when clicked, pulls down a menu of choice that can be applied
to the window. This is more or less the same as the decor in MS-Windows.
The next button after that (moving right) iconifies the window, while the
button next to that one maximises the window (as seen in Figure 3).</p>

<center>
  <img src="misc/adam/fvwm-window.png" alt="Sample Fvwm Window" /><br />
  <b>Figure 3: A decorated window using the default Fvwm settings.</b>
</center>

<p>Fvwm allows up to a maximum of ten buttons on the window titlebar. These
can be defined to perform a number of functions. I've yet to personally
think of a reason why you would need to define all ten, but I'm sure some
people do. There are two types of buttons that can be defined: <b>vector
buttons</b> and <b>pixmaps</b>, the former of which are used by default.
I'll come back to the difference later on, but for now we'll look at how
the buttons are arranged and seen by Fvwm. As such, each button is numbered
in turn.</p>


<center><pre>
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1 3 5 7 9			   Title			 0 8 6 4 2 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|									   |
</pre></center>

<p>Fig. 3 therefore shows that buttons 1,4 and 2 have been defined. I
mentioned vector buttons earlier. These are "drawn" by Fvwm. Essentially,
they're just coordinates of points used by Fvwm for specific functions. You
can see a huge list of vector definitions <a
href="http://www.fvwm.org/screenshots/vectorbuttons/"> here</a>. You can
also apply various definitions to the buttons as you see fit. The code for
the buttons is defined within a <i>decor</i>. By default (as is the case
here), if no decor has been defined, the builtin is used.</p>

<h4>Defining Decors</h4>

<p>A decor is a defined set of characteristics that can be applied to
windows. Typically, they're suited for defining all the attributes we've
looked at so far.</p>

<p><pre class=code>
AddToDecor   fDecor
 + BorderStyle Simple
 + TitleStyle	   -- Raised
 + ButtonStyle All -- Raised
 + AddButtonStyle 1 Vector 5 25x40@1 25x60@1 75x60@0 75x40@0 25x40@1
 + AddButtonStyle 2 Vector 4 50x25@1 75x75@0 25x75@0 50x25@1
 + AddButtonStyle 4 Vector 4 50x75@1 25x25@1 75x25@1 50x75@0
 + ButtonStyle	  1 - Clear MWMDecorMenu
 + ButtonStyle	  2 - Clear MWMDecorMax
 + ButtonStyle	  4 - Clear MWMDecorMin
</pre></p>

<p>This code can be placed in the <em>~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc</em> file. This
decor does a number of things. <em>BorderStyle</em> sets up the style of
the border.  The <i>simple</i> option tells Fvwm that you want the
defaults. If you look closely at the border, you'll notice that the edges
are cut into. These are the window <em>handles</em> that define how much of
the edge is available for grabbing the window (to resize it, move it, etc.)
<em>TitleStyle</em> can set a number of attributes; here, it is being
used to give the tilebar a raised look, and the same is done to the buttons
with the <em>ButtonStyle</em> command. <em>AddButtonStyle</em> adds to an
existing style. Following that, the button number is specified (see
diagram), and last are the vector definitions that you can replace with your
own.</p>

<p>One aspect you must be aware of is that if you define a new button to be
added to the titlebar, you <b>must</b> give it a mouse-binding, otherwise it
will not display. I won't be covering mouse bindings just yet, but for now you
can locate the following in the <em>~/.fvwm/.fvwm2rc</em> file:</p>

<p><pre class=code>
#   for the title bar buttons:
Mouse 0 1       A       Menu MenuFvwmWindowOps2 Close
Mouse 0 2       A       FuncFvwmMaximize
Mouse 0 4       A       Iconify
</pre></p>

<p>Adding your own definition is simple. Although nothing will be bound to
the button, you can add below those definitions something like the
following, replacing the number after "0" with the corresponding number of
the button for which you have defined the vector:</p>

<p><pre class=code>
Mouse 0 0	A	Nop
</pre></p>

<p>You'll have to restart Fvwm for the changes to be applied.</p>

<p>There is a <b>huge</b> number of options available for just these
commands. For instance, you can define the Titlebar to be flat, by adding
the following line:</p>

<pre class=code>TitleStyle -- Flat</pre>

<p>If you add <i>--flat</i> to the end of your vector button definitions,
the button takes on a sunken, rather than raised, appearance. You can also
define button styles based on state, i.e. one for <em>ActiveUp</em> and
<em>ActiveDown</em>. Border styles can also be set, so that, rather than a
raised border, you can have <em>sunken</em> or <em>flat</em> ones.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, pixmaps can also be used, in place of vector
buttons. The same rules apply about defining the mouse-bindings from earlier. 
These are .xpm files that you can define to replace the buttons with images of your 
own. The style is similar to the one just defined:</p>

<p><pre class=code>
ButtonStyle 2 Pixmap my_pixmap.xpm
ButtonStyle 4 \
  ActiveUp   (Pixmap activeup.xpm) \
  ActiveDown (Pixmap activedown.xpm) \
  Inactive   (Pixmap inactiveup.xpm)
  ButtonStyle 4 \
  InactiveDown Pixmap inactivedown.xpm
</pre></p>

<p>Here, Button 2 remains the same throughout all states, but Button 4 uses a
different pixmap depending on the state. The button states are listed
below:

<ul>
  <li><em>ActiveUp</em> -- This is the default used, if nothing else is set.
  It cannot be destroyed.</li>
  <li><em>ActiveDown</em> -- This is the state of the button when it is
  pressed in.</li>
  <li><em>InActive</em> -- This is used for windows that are focused and
  defocused (hence the <em>ActiveUp</em> state is used).</li>
  <li><em>InactiveDown</em> -- Used for button/title presses for
  non-focused windows.</li>
</ul>

<p> To apply the decor that you create, you have to tell Fvwm about it. The
following general line can be used, obviously replacing the name of the decor
with whatever you called it. In the examples above it is <i>fDecor</i>:</p>

<p><pre class=code>
Style *  UseDecor  fDecor
</pre></p>

<h3>Next Month...</h3>

<p>Obviously, this has been a cursory review of what a window is, and how
to define the basic decor such as buttons and borders. There is a plethora
of options that I have not covered just for these alone. Although somewhat
cumbersome, the man page for fvwm contains all of these, and includes a lot
of options in addition to what I have mentioned. Play around and experiment
with defining buttons and vectors.</p>

<p>Next month, we'll take a look at defining menus, coloursets for windows, 
and some other style options.</p>

I write the recently-revived series "The Linux Weekend Mechanic", which was
started by John Fisk (the founder of Linux Gazette) in 1996 and continued
until 1998.  I'm also a member of The Answer Gang.

<P> I was born in Hammersmith (London UK) in 1983.  When I was 13, I moved to
the sleepy, thatched roofed, village of East Chaldon in the county of Dorset.
I am very near the coast (at Lulworth Cove) which is where I used to work.

<P> I first got interested in Linux in 1996 having seen a review of it in a
magazine (Slackware 2.0). I was fed up with the instability that the then-new
operating system Win95 had and so I decided to give it a go.
Slackware 2.0 was great. I have been a massive Linux enthusiast ever
since.  I ended up with running SuSE on both my desktop and laptop computers.

<P> While at school (<A HREF="www.purbeck.dorset.sch.uk">The Purbeck
School</A>, Wareham in Dorset), I was actively involved in setting up two
Linux proxy servers (each running Squid and SquidGuard).  I also set up
numerous BASH scripts which allowed web-based filtering to be done via
e-mail, so that when an e-mail was received, the contents of it were added to
the filter file. (Good old BASH -- I love it)

<P> I am now 18 and studying at University (Southampton Institute, UK), on a
course called HND Business Information Technology (BIT). So far, it's great.

<P> Other hobbies include reading. I especially enjoy reading plays (Henrik
Ibsen, Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw), and I also enjoy literature (Edgar Allan
Poe, Charles Dickens, Jane Austin to name but a few).

<P> I enjoy walking, and often go on holiday to the Lake District, to a place
called Keswick. There are numerous "mountains", of which "Great Gable" is my
most favourite.

<P> I am also a keen musician. I play the piano in my spare time. 

<P> I listen to a variety of music. I enjoy listening to
Rock (My favourite band is "Pavement" (lead singer:
Stephen Malkmus). I also have a passion for 1960's
psychedelic music (I hope to purchase a copy of
"Nuggets" reeeeaaall soon).
