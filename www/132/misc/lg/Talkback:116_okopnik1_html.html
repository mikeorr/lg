Hello Ben,
</p>

<p>
I have been trying to modify your script to work with latest Knoppix
with no luck at all. File called 'linux' is too big to fit to floppy
and besides, it seems that latest Knoppix cannot boot from diskette.
</p>

<p>
Please tell me, what is the latest Knoppix version that can work with
your script?
Could you please make a boot.img that would work with Knoppix V5.0.1 and
put it online somewhere?
</p>

<p>
  
</p>

Not what the querent asked (which is why I dropped the cc), but I
recently tried out DSL Embedded
(<a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/damnsmall/current/dsl-embedded.zip">http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/damnsmall/current/dsl-embedded.zip</a>)
- a version of Damn Small Linux that will boot from a pendrive, or
from within Windows using Qemu. Pretty nifty.
</p>

<p>
Even further off-topic: a friend needed a DOS boot floppy for a
floppy-less machine, and I was surprised to learn that treating a
pendrive as a floppy... works!
</p>

<p>
dd if=/dev/fd0 of=/dev/sda bs=512
</p>

<p>
and boom... the BIOS on the other machine saw a floppy drive, and
happily booted.

You bet. If you take a look at the whole CD-booting scheme, you'll find
that the CD's boot sector is lifted bodily from a DOS floppy. Hence, my
previous tip about making bootable CDs:
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../../issue99/lg_tips.html#tips.1">http://linuxgazette.net/issue99/lg_tips.html#tips.1</a>
</p>

<p>
Pendrives are just a logical extension of that; the boot mechanism is
exactly the same.

Yeah, I'm afraid that this is the case today - and became so shortly
after I wrote the article. The fact that Knoppix can't boot from
external media, by the way, is the result of 'linux' not fitting onto a
floppy: the way the booting procedure for external devices works is,
believe it or not, <em>still</em> based on a DOS floppy, or at least an image
of one.

<p>
Sorry, I don't have that version of Knoppix anymore. :\
</p>

<p>
There are alternative approaches, however. You could, for example, boot
using any sort of Linux distro, e.g. Tom's RootBoot
(<a href="http://www.toms.net/rb/">http://www.toms.net/rb/</a>), mount your USB-based Knoppix filesystem, and
"pivot" the system to use the latter with the 'chroot' command. There
are a few problems with this approach, but in the main, it works OK.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, you could use any of the other distros that <strong>will</strong> boot from
a pen drive - DSL Embedded (suggested by Jimmy O'Regan):

</p>

<p>
Knoppix is great, but it's not the only distro out there.

The other part (the fact that it works) is, perhaps, less important, but

is the "satisfacton" the smallest measurable particle of satisfaction? Or
are we going to run into the equivalent of quarks, that can be combined
into satisfactons, exuberinos, and woetrons?

<p>
But Knoppix has so much more software..
I do have Damn Small Linux  boot floppy for DSLonUSB, how do I modify it to boot Knoppix from
USB instead of Damn Small Linux?
</p>


<p>
BTW, I have managed to boot from Knoppix LiveCD, then put in
cheatcode at startup:
<pre>
knoppix fromhd=/dev/sda1
</pre>
and it runs from USB nicely. still I wish I had a floppy option too..

<p>
Since, as Jimmy mentioned, DSL is based on Knoppix, it too can have "so
much more software". <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Knoppix is, in turn, based on Debian - all you
have to do is modify '/etc/apt/source.list' so that it contains a few
valid servers, and you can 'apt-get' any software you need to your
heart's content.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I do have Damn Small Linux  boot floppy for DSLonUSB, how do I modify it to boot Knoppix from
&gt; USB instead of Damn Small Linux?
</pre>
 
<p>
Since I have no idea how DSL built that boot procedure, I really have no
idea - but it might be worth your time to research it and find out,
since it just might turn out to be easily adaptable (I'd appreciate it
if you'd let us know when you find an answer; yours is not an unusual
question.)

Speaking of small bootable linuxen has anyone tried out the
"live-package" of Debian unstable. It can produce a 70 MB iso image
of a bootable etch/sid distribution. They are working on the USB
stick version. (<a href="http://live.debian.net">http://live.debian.net</a>).
