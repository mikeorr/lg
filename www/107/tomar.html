<h1>How to Reset forgotten Root passwords</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/tomar.html">Suramya Tomar</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>
   1.0 Introduction
</h3>

<p>
Suppose you have just taken over as a new system administrator from another 
person just before they left and they forgot to give you the root password. 
Now, let's say you have to install the latest version of PHP on the system
so that the sales department's website works the way its supposed to. You
have to get the website up yesterday, since you are losing money every
minute it doesn't work. Or maybe you simply need to add another user to the
system.

<p>The above scenarios are just two possible cases when you might need to reset 
the root password on a system; there are hundreds of other possible cases
when you might need to do this, but I am not going to list all of them.
Most of us know what to do when something like this happens on a Windows
machine, but not a lot of us know how to recover lost passwords from Linux
machines. This document attempts to rectify this situation by telling you
about the different options available to recover passwords from
<b>YOUR</b> machines. (Don't use this to break into other people's systems
as that would be stupid and will get you into big trouble if you are
caught.)
</p>

</h3>

<p>Use the information in this document at your own risk. I disavow any 
potential liability for the contents of this document. Use of the concepts, 
examples, and/or other content of this document is entirely at your own risk.
</p>

<p>
The information in this document should only be used to recover passwords from 
machines to which you have legal access. If you use this information to break 
into other people's systems, then I am not responsible for it and you deserve 
your fate when you are caught. <b>So don't blame me.</b></p>

<p>
You are strongly advised to make a backup of your system before performing 
any of the actions listed in this document.
</p>

<h3>
   1.2 Credits
</h3>

<p>In this version, I have the pleasure of acknowledging the following people 
without whose input this would have never seen the light of the day:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
The community at <a 
href='http://www.justlinux.com'>http://www.justlinux.com</a>, for the really 
helpful debate about this topic in one of their threads. 
 </li>

 <li>
 The creators and maintainers of the various Linux documentation sites using 
 which I gathered this information.
 </li>

 <li>
 Matt Hoskins and Kevin Walsh, for getting me interested in Linux in the 
 first place.
 </li>

 <li>
  My friends and family, for bearing with me when I was compiling this document.
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>
   1.3 Before you start
</h3>

<p>
Before you attempt to change or replace the password of any machine, make
sure you get permission from the management authorizing it, 'cause otherwise
it can be mistaken as an attempt to hack into the machine, which is not
good.
</p>

<p>Secondly, create a backup of all important data before you do anything else, 
so if anything goes wrong you'll still have a copy of your data. If you didn't, 
and something went wrong, don't blame me. I tested most of this stuff on my 
system and it worked, but you are responsible for your system, not me, so don't 
blame me if something did go wrong.</p>

<h3>
   2.1 Various Options available
</h3>

<p>There are various methods available for resetting a root password. In 
this section, I will list all the major ones, and we will go over each in detail 
later in the document. I will also go over some steps to prevent some other 
person from doing this and hacking your machine.
</p>

<p>The various methods are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Boot into single-user mode (easiest, least risky)</li>
 <li>Boot using a boot disk and edit the password file</li>
 <li>Mount the drive on another computer and edit the password file</li>
</ul>

<h3>
   2.1.1 Reseting passwords by booting into single-user mode
</h3>

<p>This is the easiest and the fastest method to reset passwords. The steps 
are a little different depending on if you are using GRUB or LILO as a 
bootmanager.</p>

<p><b>Booting into single-user mode from LILO</b></p>

<p>Follow these steps to reset the password when using LILO: </p>

<ul>
<li>Reboot the system. When you see the <tt>LILO:</tt> prompt (see Fig. 1 
below), type in <tt>linux single</tt> and press 'Enter'. 
This will log you in as root in single-user mode. If your system requires 
you to enter your root password to log in, then try <tt>linux
init=/bin/bash</tt> instead.</li>

<li>Once the system finishes booting, you will be logged in as root in 
single-user mode. Use <tt>passwd</tt> and choose a new password for root.</li>

<li>Type <tt>reboot</tt> to reboot the system and then you can login with the 
new password you just selected.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have a new version of LILO which gives you a menu selection of the 
various kernels available press <tt>Tab</tt> to get the 
LILO: prompt and then proceed as shown above.</p>

<p><b>Booting into single user mode from GRUB</b></p>

<p>
Follow these steps to reset the password when using GRUB:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reboot the system, and when you are at the selection prompt (See Fig. 2
below), highlight the line for Linux and press 'e'. You may only have 2
seconds to do this, so be quick.</li>

<li>This will take you to another screen where you should select the entry 
that begins with 'kernel' and press 'e' again. </li>

<li>Append <tt>' single'</tt> to the end of that line (without the quotes). 
Make sure that there is a space between what's there and 'single'. If your 
system requires you to enter your root password to log into single-user 
mode, then append <tt>init=/bin/bash</tt> after 'single'. Hit 'Enter' to
save the changes.</li>

<li>Press 'b' to boot into Single User Mode.</li>

<li>Once the system finishes booting, you will be logged in as root. Use 
<tt>passwd</tt> and choose a new password for root.</li>

<li>Type <tt>reboot</tt> to reboot the system, and you can login with the 
new password you just selected.</li>

</ul>

<h3>
   2.1.2 Reseting passwords by using a boot disk and editing the password file
</h3>

<p>This method is a little bit more complicated than the previous one and has 
a very high chance of success (assuming your filesystem is not encrypted and 
you didn't forget the password to decrypt it if it is). As before, get 
permission before you do this.</p>

<p>To start, you need a Linux boot disk or a rescue disk. (If you didn't
create one when prompted during the installation then let this be a lesson
for you.) You can use your installation CD as a rescue disk; most distros
have an option to allow you to boot into rescue mode. With my Redhat Linux
CD, I have to enter <tt>linux rescue</tt> to start the rescue mode. But
this might be a bit different in each distro. You can also use a live linux
CD like <A href='http://www.knoppix.net'>Knoppix</a> or <A
href='http://www.gnoppix.org/'>Gnoppix</a> for system recovery.  (Click <A
href='http://www.frozentech.com/content/livecd.php'>here</a> for a list of
all the live Linux CD's). In this tutorial I will use Knoppix as my rescue
CD but the process is almost the same for any rescue CD you might use.

<p class="editorial">[ You can also download one of the many single-floppy
Linux distributions (e.g., Tom's RootBoot <http://toms.net/rb/>), and use it
to bring up the machine as described. This is, of course, much faster than
downloading and burning a rescue CD, especially on a slow connection. -- Ben ]

<p>Follow these steps to reset the password using Knoppix:

<ul>
<li>Reboot the system and configure it to boot from the Knoppix CD 
(instructions available <A 
href='http://www.ehow.com/how_6028_designate-start-drive.html'>here</a>) </li>

<li>At the Knoppix Boot Prompt (See Fig. 3 below) enter: <tt>knoppix lang=us</tt> 
to start boot Knoppix using the english locale. If you understand German,
feel free to just hit 'Enter' to boot into Knoppix.</li>

<li>Once the system finishes booting, press <tt>&lt;Ctrl&gt; + &lt;Alt&gt; + 
&lt;F1&gt;</tt> (The Control, Alt and F1 key together) to switch to a  virtual 
terminal.</li>

<li>Type <tt>mkdir mountplace</tt> to create a directory called 'mountplace'. 
This is where we will mount the filesystem.</li>
 
<li>Type <tt>mount /dev/hdaX mountplace</tt>, where /dev/hdaX is your root 
partition. More information on Linux partitions is available <a 
href='http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/tutorials/4269/1/'>here</a>.</li>

<li>Change to the "/etc" directory on your root partition by typing <tt>cd
mountplace/etc</tt>.

<li>Use your favorite text editor and open the 'shadow' file for editing. I 
use 'vi', so I type <tt>vi shadow</tt> (If you have a really old system, you 
won't have a shadow file, in which case you need to edit the 'passwd' file.)</li>

<li>Scroll down to the line containing the root user's information, which looks something like:  
<br><code>root:dsfDSDF!s:12581:0:99999:7:::</code></li>

<li>Delete everything between the first and second colons, so that the line 
looks like: <br><code>root::12581:0:99999:7:::</code></li>

<li>Save the file and exit your editor.</li>

<li>Type <tt>cd</tt> to return to your home directory.</li>

<li>Type <tt>umount mountplace</tt> to unmount the partition.</li>

<li>Type <tt>reboot</tt> to reboot your system, and remove the Knoppix CD from the drive.</li>

<li>Now you can log into your system as root with no password. Make sure you change the 
password immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
2.1.2 Reseting passwords by mounting on another system and editing the password 
file
</h3>

<p>
This option is a bit more work than any of the earlier options but is almost 
sure to work (except when the filesystem is encrypted).
</p>

<p>Follow these steps to reset the password:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shut down the machine after backing up all important data.</li>

<li>Open the casing, unplug the hard drive, and take it to another machine. 
(This system should be running Linux, since Windows can't read the Linux partition 
formats.)</li>

<li>Connect the hard disk as a slave drive and boot the new system.</li>

<li>Once the system finishes booting, mount the slave drive's root
partition as shown above and edit the password file.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
   3.1 How to Prevent someone else from reseting your root password
</h3>

<p>
If you are an even slightly security-consious sysadmin, the previous sections 
must have set off alarms while you were reading them. Is it really that easy 
to hack Linux? Yes and No. It all it comes down to the following: <b>Physical 
Access is Root Access</b>. Meaning, if you give someone physical access to a 
system, then you are giving them a very good chance of getting root access on 
your box. <b>This is true for Windows, Linux, or any other OS out 
there</b>.
</p>

<p>But... you say that you need to give some people physical access to the 
server? There are some precautions you can take to slow down attackers and 
stop the noob's. In this section I will talk about various ways you can make 
your computer more secure against these types of attacks. So lets get 
started.</p>

<h3>
   3.1.1 Password protecting GRUB and LILO
</h3>

<p>First, edit the <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> file and insert the following line, 
right after the "initdefault" line: <code>~~:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin</code>. 
This will require a password to boot into single-user mode by making init run 
'sulogin' before dropping the machine to a root shell. 'sulogin' requires the 
user to input the root password before continuing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the above step won't protect us against people who know what 
they are doing and pass <tt>init=/bin/bash</tt> to the kernel at the LILO 
prompt. To prevent unauthorized access I would suggest that you password 
protect LILO/GRUB by following these steps:

<p><b>How to Protect LILO:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Open a shell prompt and log in as root</li>
<li>Open <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code> in your favorite text editor</li>
<li>Add the following line before the first image stanza: 
<code>password=&lt;password&gt; </code>, where &lt;password&gt; is your password.</li>
<li>Run <tt>/sbin/lilo -v</tt> to let the changes take effect</li>
<li>Type <tt>chmod 600 /etc/lilo.conf</tt> to give only root access to read 
and edit the file since all passwords are in plain text</li>
<li>Relax a bit, as your system is a little bit more secure</li>
</ul>

<p><b>How to password-protect GRUB</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Open a shell prompt and log in as root</li>
<li>Type <tt>/sbin/grub-md5-crypt</tt> and press enter</li>
<li>Enter the password you chose for GRUB when prompted. This will return an 
MD5 hash of your password</li>
<li>Open <code>/boot/grub/grub.conf</code> in your favorite text editor</li>
<li>Add <tt>password --md5 &lt;password-hash&gt;</tt> below the timeout in the main 
section (Replace &lt;password-hash&gt; with the hash you got in the previous 
step)</li>
<li>Save and exit</li>
<li>The next time you reboot, the GRUB menu will not let you access the 
editor or command interface without first pressing [p] followed by the GRUB 
password.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
   3.1.2 Password-protecting the BIOS
</h3>

<p>There are two primary reasons for password-protecting the BIOS of a 
computer:

<ul>
<li>Prevent Changes To BIOS Settings: if an intruder has access to the BIOS, 
they can set it to boot off of a diskette or CD-ROM. </li>

<li>Prevent Booting the System: Some BIOSes allow you to password protect the 
boot process itself. When activated, an attacker would be forced to enter a 
password for the BIOS to launch the boot loader. </li>
</ul>

<p>Because the methods for setting a BIOS password vary between computer 
manufacturers, you should consult the manual for your computer. If you forget 
the BIOS password, it can often be reset either with jumpers on the 
motherboard or by disconnecting the CMOS battery. However, you should check 
the manual for your computer or motherboard before attempting this procedure.</p>

<h3>
   4.1 Conclusion
</h3>

<p>
By now I have hopefully saved you a lot of trouble by telling you how to 
recover your root password and make it harder for others to get the password.

<p> I was born in 1980 in a small Air Force hospital in Hashimara, India. I
then spent the next 18 years of my life all over India during which I had
the pleasure of attending 7 schools to complete 12 years of schooling.

<p> I started using Linux in late 1999 when a friend lent me a Redhat 7.1
installation CD and another friend 'donated' a 6GB harddisk. This was right
after my Win98 had crashed for the nth time so I decided to give Linux a
shot. I tried it and got hooked almost instantly. Over the next 2 years I
upgraded to Redhat 7.3 but when Redhat decided to stop support for RH 7.3 I
switched to Debian and have been living happily ever since.

<p> I like to program a lot and have recently figured out how to decipher 
the jumble of characters some people like to call Perl and found that I
actually like it. For websites I like using PHP with MySQL backends and can
program with C, C++, VB and .Net. I am also very interested in computer
security and Artificial Intelligence and try to read as much on
these topics as I can.

<p> Other than working on the computer I like reading (mainly Fantasy and
Science Fiction but I will read anything except romance novels), listening
to music (fav singers include: Shania Twain, In-Grid, Crystal Waters) and
taking stuff apart to see how it works.

<p> If you are really bored and want to learn more about me then feel free to

more info about me than you ever wanted to know.
