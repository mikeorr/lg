<p>"Well, should we get one pitcher or two?" That was the question
that began the first unofficial event of the Linux Expo Thursday
night. A group of people, including Red Hat employees, some of the
speakers and a tired maddog were at the Carolina Brewery in
Chapel Hill, North Carolina. It was late, and I was the
last person to arrive."Two pitchers," I cried,"Now what
will you be drinking?"

<p>The next day, Friday April 4th started early, as I had to set up
the Linux International booth, as well as absorb all that was
happening. The event was held in the North Carolina
Biotechnology Center at Research Triangle Park. As I
approached the Biotech Center, I was met with a friendly
parking coordinator that reinforced the information that
"parking was scarce", and that most people had to park at
outlying lots. Fortunately Red Hat had arranged for shuttle
busses from those lots and from several of the hotels. Since our
car had an exhibitor's pass, we were able to park close to the
Biotech Center and unload our banners, handouts and stuffed
penguins.

<p>There was a large tent to the left outside of the building
containing the "Linux Expo Super Store" stocked with
Linux books, Linux bumper stickers, T-shirts (including
an excellently designed Expo shirt that said "Expose yourself to
Linux" with a front and rear view of a penguin holding open an
overcoat) and other interesting souvenir items. Further
to the left was an outdoor viewing area for the conference talks
that (due to the excellent weather) was a favorite spot for
people to view the technical talks for free, especially while
playing Frisbee. A raffle was held in the registration area, 
and prizes were given away on an hourly basis.
Having registered, attendees were given a copy of the talks as
well as an event schedule.


<p>The event was held on two floors with the exhibits spread out on both. There
was another conference viewing area inside the building with TV
monitors, as well as the conference auditorium itself. There was
an Install Fest area (sponsored by the Washington D.C. Linux
User's Group, Linux Hardware Solutions and Red Hat Software),
where people brought their systems, received help with installing
Red Hat's latest release, and Olaf Kirch's kernel-based NFS
server was "stress tested" at the same time. Finally, there was a food
court area, where people could buy sandwiches, chips, soda and
other "software development food".

<p>There were fifteen vendors at the Expo, each with "table-top"
booths to display their wares. I prefer the "pipe-and-drape"
approach to trade shows rather than expensive booths, since I
would rather the vendors put more money into development of the
product and less into elaborate displays or floor shows with
unicycle riders who juggle things. While not all Linux vendors
were at Linux Expo, a wide spectrum of companies, including Linux
International, Cyclades, Numerical Algorithms Group, Linux
Hardware Solutions, Enhanced Software Technologies, Caldera,
Applix, Xess, WorkGroup Solutions, Stay Online, VA Research, Apex
Systems Integration, PromoX Systems and (of course) Red Hat
Software were present. One item being demonstrated at the Linux
Hardware Solutions booth was a free piece of software called [cw]em86[ecw]
that allowed an Intel/Linux binary to run without change on an
Alpha/Linux system. Being shown for the first time, it allowed
Applixware, Netscape and various other applications to execute as
if they had been ported to the system.

<p>Penguins abounded in various T-shirts, giveaways and objects
d'art. In fact, there were so many people there (I estimated 900
over the two-day event) with penguin "stuff", that I thought
I'd
had enough of penguins; but afterwards while wandering around Chapel Hill, Alan Cox found some
candy in the shape of penguins, so penguin "lust" started all
over again.

<p>The technical conference started off with a presentation by
Gilbert Coville of Apple Computer with a talk about the MkLinux
kernel. For people who were afraid that this would turn into a
"Red Hat Only" event, it was interesting that Gilbert's talk
opened the Expo and that a talk about the Debian Linux
Distribution (given by Bruce Perens) followed shortly after.
Bruce also discussed the graphics used in the making of Toy Story in
a separate presentation.

<p>Various presentations about hardware-specific ports were given.
Dave Miller talked about the "Next Generation SPARCLinux" as well
as the Free Software Development Model, and David Mosberger-Tang
talked about the Alpha Port, as well as methods, applicable to both Intel
and Alpha, for
speeding up your programs by paying attention to memory and
cache accesses.

<p>Other talks were more general across the Linux OS, such as Jeff
Uphoff's "Network File Locking", Alan Cox's "Tour of the Linux
Networking Stack", Peter Braam's "Coda Filesystem", Alexander
Yuriev's talk on the IPv4 family of protocols and infrastructure
and his talk on security, Michael Callahan's "Linux and Legacy
LANs", Eric Youngdale's "Beyond ELF", Olaf Kirch's "Linux Network
File System", Theodore Ts's "Ext2 File System: Design,
Implementation and the Future", Miguel de Icaza's talk on the new
RAID code and Daniel Quinlan's talk on the File System Hierarchy
Standard.

<p>To round out the list of talks and events was Dr. Greg
Wettstein's talk on "Working and Playing with others: Linux Grows
Up" and the Linux Bowl.

<p>The Linux Bowl was the final event. Two teams
of six developers were pitted against each other to answer
thirty questions about Linux and the Linux community. Questions
ranged from "What liquid should one drink between rounds of a
Finnish sauna?" (correct answer: beer) to "What version library
fixed a particular security hole?" to which Alan Cox gave a
(seemingly) ten minute answer. While some of the questions were
very obscure (even the moderator was unsure of the answer), most
of the time either the right answer (or a good facsimile) was
given.

<p>The show sponsors (after tallying up the attendence) reported that
958 people showed up, which could be the largest Linux-specific event
ever, of which 40% were from within North Carolina.  Attendees came from
over 25 states, 4 Canadian provinces, and 10 countries, including Australia,
Korea and European countries.


<p>Finally, I would like to thank the members of the Atlanta Linux
Enthusiasts <a href="http://www.ale.org/">http://www.ale.org/</a> group who helped to staff the Linux
International booth. They were great and helped give me the freedom
to get out from behind the booth every once in a while, because
most importantly, Linux Expo was a chance to talk with the
vendors, the developers and other old and new friends on a
one-to-one, quality basis. Perhaps some things could be improved
for next year: A larger auditorium for the talks, more and
closer parking  and less expensive food in the food court. But
certainly the southern hospitality and warmth of Red Hat Software
came through. I want to thank the sponsors for arranging a great event,
and I hope that next year's will be even larger and better.
