No Linux support Lexmark 40 printers
</H3> 
Date: Thu, 15 Oct 1998 12:18:37 -0600 (MDT)<BR>

<P>
For your information:<BR> 
The Lexmark 40 color printers do all setup/alignment from MS whatever OS.
<P>
Lexmark first told me they don't support Linux
on their new 40 & 45 printers (all alignment functions are from software
under MS something). But hey, the guys at Lexmark came through. They sent me a
<A HREF="./tips_cartutil.c">C program</A> for aligning the printer.
<P> 
It would be a good candidate to go into an archive (sunsite.unc.edu). I
don't know the process for putting software into an archive so I am
passing it on to you folks. I also am sending it to Grant Taylor
gtaylor+pht@picante.com, who is listed as the custodian of the
Printing-HOWTO. The model 40 printer is PostScript and works well. 
<P>

configure the colors for the display of the different tags as one
wishes. It is very clear from the comments in the config file on how to
do it. One can start lynx with an option <tt>lynx -f config.file</tt> if I

From: "Anthony E. Greene", <A HREF="mailto:agreene@pobox.com">
agreene@pobox.com</A> 
<P>
I saw your letter to Linux Gazette and decided to drop you a few pointers.
<P>
Linux Documentation Project: <BR> 
First, the Linux Documentation Project is your friend. Take a look around
the site <A
HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/">http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/</A>. The documents that you'll find most
valuable as a new Linux user are the "Installation and Getting Started
Guide" and the "The Linux Users' Guide". Both are available for download in
multiple formats. Descriptions and pointers are at
http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/ldp.html. If you really consider yourself (or
your curious friends) clueless, then I'd advise you to buy a ream of paper
and print the PDF version of the Linux User's Guide for casual reading.
Then get one of the easier distributions, back up your Win95 data, and give
Linux a whirl. 
<P>
Linux Distributions:<BR> 
I'd recommend Caldera <A
HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">http://www.caldera.com/</A> for casual non-programmers
that are comfortable with Win95 and just want to try Linux. Current
versions of Caldera come with the KDE desktop <A
HREF="mailto:http://www.kde.org/">http://www.kde.org/</A>. KDE
presents a familiar interface to Win95 users. Red Hat
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">http://www.redhat.com/</A> is very popular and also relatively easy but is
oriented more toward knowledgeable computer users. I'm not familiar enough
with SUSE <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">http://www.suse.com/</A> to make a recommendation, although it's
supposed to be easy too. Debian <A
HREF="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</A> and Slackware
<A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">http://www.slackware.org/</A> are considered by most to be for those who
already know how to install and use Linux. There are other distributions,
but these are the most popular.
<P>
Included Documentation:<BR> 
Once you get Linux installed, fire up Midnight Commander from the command
line using 'mc'. This is an easy to use file manager that, despite its DOS
look & feel, is also powerful. Use it to take a look around the /usr/doc
directory for the wealth of documentation installed in any popular Linux
system. You'll be astounded at the amount of information available if
you're accustomed to the Win95 way of doing things. The HOWTO documents in
particular will be very useful to new users. HOWTOs are cookbook-style
documents written by Linux users who have taken the time to share the steps
they took to accomplish something in Linux. Perhaps if you use Linux for a
while, you'll have occasion to write a HOWTO of your own.
<P>
Manual Pages<BR> 
If you see references to a command in Linux and would like to know more
about using it, chances are you'll find a comprehensive description of the
command and all its options in the associated Manual Page. Just type: 'man
command' at the command line, substituting the name of the command you're
interested in and you'll be presented with a summary of the syntax, usage,
and available options for the command. Many man pages also include examples
and references to related man pages and commands. To see how to use the
manual page system itself, just use 'man man'.
<P>
Mailing Lists and Newsgroups<BR> 
Mailing lists and newsgroups provide a good way to find the answer to a
question you haven't been able to find the answer to in the extensive
documentation included with Linux or available from the LDP. Mailing lists
are generally archived and the archives will probably be able to answer
your question. If not, post a note asking for a pointer to the
documentation and you'll probably get several good answers. If the problem
is simple enough, you'll probably get an explanation too. I've found
pointers to comprehensive documentation to be more valuable in the long run
though. Often, understanding the solution to one problem allows you to
solve other problems later. When subscribing to a mailing list or
newsgroup, try to find one that's specific to the distribution you use.
Most things are the same across distributions, but there are enough small
differences that new users would be best served by getting help that's
specific to their distribution.
<P>
One more thing; be prepared to do lots of reading.  ;-)

Locally Searching the <I>Linux Gazette</I> 
</H3>
Date: Sat, 3 Oct 1998 01:33:17 -0400 (EDT)<BR> 
From: Ray Marshall, <A HREF="mailto:raym@vnet.net">raym@vnet.net</A> 
<P>
To begin with, I often like to browse and/or reference present and past
issues of the <I>Linux Gazette</I>.  But, since I'm not always connected to the
Internet, and even when I am, I hate waiting for a page to download; I
mirror it locally, both at home, and at work.
<P>
On occasion I have found myself grepping the TWDT files for specific
references to various topics, commands, packages, or whatever.  But,
just a plain grep of lg/issue??/issue??.html, will only show references
in all but the first 8 issues.  So, I made some minor changes in
lg/issue01to08, and put an alias (command) in ~/.bashrc, to allow easy
scanning of ALL issues.
<P>
First, the changes:
<PRE> 
  cd ~/html/lg/issue01to08
  ln linux_gazette.html lg_issue1.html
  ln linux_gazette.aug.html lg_issue2.html
  ln linux_gazette.sep.html lg_issue3.html
  ln linux_gazette.oct.html lg_issue4.html
  ln linux_gazette.nov.html lg_issue5.html
</PRE> 
Now the command declaration (for bash):
<PRE> 
  lgfind () { command grep -i ""$@"" ~/html/lg/issue01to08/lg_issue?.html ~/html/lg/issue??/issue??.html | more ; }
</PRE> 
The same declaration in C-shell (csh):
<PRE> 
  alias lgfind 'grep  -i ""\!*"" ~/html/lg/issue01to08/lg_issue?.html ~/html/lg/issue??/issue??.html | more'
</PRE> 
I suppose I could have used "linux_gazette*" in my grep, but that would
have put the resulting output out of order.  Besides, these links allow
the grep to show which issue number a match is found in.
<P>
And I suppose I could also have created either soft or hard links to ALL
of the TWDT files in another directory.  But I would then have to go there
and add another link, every time a new issue came out.
<P>
Using this is simple, just:
<PRE> 
  lgfind &lt;string&gt;
</PRE> 
and obvious to most experienced UNIX users, I quote the string if it
contains spaces.  Also, the string can be a regex expression.  You may
have noticed the "-i" -- I don't like having to remember the case of
the characters I'm looking for.
<P>
Once I have the output of lgfind, I point my browser to another html page
that I have generated, that contains just links to all of the TWDT files.
I will attach that page to this message.  You can either add it to the
base files, publish it, or whatever TYO.  ;-)  I put it in the directory
that contains your `lg' directory.
<P>
I hope this helps someone else, too.
<P> 
Ray Marshall
<P>
PS:  I agree with your decision to use "TWDT".  It can be read in whatever
     way one wishes, including very inoffensively.  Wise choice.

Mounting DOS Partitions in Linux
</H3>
Date: Fri, 02 Oct 1998 17:08:23 -0400<BR> 
From: Ed Young, <A HREF="mailto:youngej@magpage.com">
youngej@magpage.com</A> 
<P>
Secure Mounting for DOS Partitions:
<P>
In order to open up permissions on your DOS partitions in a
secure way, do the following:
<P>
Note: in the samples below, the dos usrid (63) and grpid(63)
      were selected so they wouldn't duplicate any other
      usrid or grpid in /etc/passwd or /etc/group.
 <P> 
      Also, this solution works with Red Hat 5.1, you may
      have to adjust it slightly if you are using a 
      different distribution.
<P>
1) Make a dos user who can't log in by adding the following 
   line to /etc/passwd:
     dos:*:63:63:MSDOS Accessor:/dos:
<P>
2) Make a dos group and add users to the dos group.  In the
   following example, root and ejy are in the dos group.  To
   do this, add a line like the following to /etc/group:
     dos::63:root,ejy
<P>
3) Add the following line (changed to suit your system) to 
<PRE> 
   /etc/fstab:
     /dev/hda1  /C      vfat    uid=63,gid=63,umask=007 0 0
   </PRE> 
   Of course, you have to locate your DOS partitions in the 
   first place.  This is done by issuing the following 
   commands as 'root':
<PRE> 
     /sbin/fdisk -l
     df
     cat /etc/fstab
</PRE> 
   The `fdisk -l` command lists all available devices.  `df`
   shows which devices are mounted and how much is on them.
   And /etc/fstab lists all mountable devices.  The devices
   remaining are extended partitions, a kind of a partition
   envelope, which you don't want to mount.  And the 
   partition's allocated to other operating systems which you
   may want to mount.
<P>
4) Create a mount point for your DOS disk by issuing the 
   following commands as root:
     mkdir /C
     chown dos:dos /C
<P>
With this setup, the C: drive is mounted at boot time to /C.  
Only root and ejy can read and write to it.  Note that vfat 
in /etc/fstab works for vfat16 (and vfat32 natively for 
Linux 2.0.34 and above).
<P>
Enjoy...

When people are talking about printer drivers for Linux, they are
mostly referring to a piece of code that enables the "Ghostscript"
program to produce output on your printer.
<P>
Ghostscript is an interpreter of the Postscript page-description 
language. In the Unix world, it is kind of a lingua franca of talking to
a printer. A lot of programs can produce Postscript output.
<P>
More expensive printers support Postscript in hardware, other printers
need Ghostscript with a driver for that particular printer compiled in.
<P>
Invoke Ghostscript as "gs -?" to see a list of all the printers for
which support is compiled in. If your printer is not in the list, use a
driver for a printer from the same family. Otherwise you might have to
compile GhostScript with another driver.
<P>
The Ghostscript 5.1 that I'm using (Debian distro) is compiled with the
bjc600 driver.

</font></blockquote> 
To use a Plug-and-Play device under Linux, you have to configure it.
For that, you can use isapnptools package. It will probably be included
with your distribution. 
<P>
Log in as root, and execute the command "pnpdump >isapnp.conf"
Now edit this file to choose sensible values for the parameters the
modem requires. Read the isapnp.conf man page. You might want to do 
"cat /proc/interrupts", "cat /proc/dma" and "cat /proc/ioports" to see
which interrupts, DMA channels and I/O addresses are already in use.
Once you're finished. copy the isapnp.conf file to /etc (as root). You
can now configure the card by issuing the command "isapnp
/etc/isapnp.conf" as root. 
<P>
This probably must be done before the serial ports are configured. Look
at the init(8) manpage, and see where the serial ports are configured in
the system initialization scripts. Make sure that isapnp is called
before the serial ports are configured.
<P>
If the modem is an internal one, you might have to disable one of the
serial ports in your BIOS, so the modem can use in's address and
interrupt.
<P>
Now, about the printer, AFIAK all HP *20 models are Windows-only
printers. They use the host computer's CPU to perform all kinds of
calculations that are normally done by the printer hardware. Therefore
it needs a driver. Since HP doesn't release programming info on these
devices, there will probably never be Linux drivers for these printers.
<P>
You should avoid this kind of brain-dead hardware (mostly referred to as
"winprinters", or "winmodems").

Hope this helps :-)

Most printing on Linux is handled through the use of the Ghostscript
drivers.  Ghostscript takes postscript input directed to it via the lpr command
and converts it to the raw data streams that a particular output device can
handle.  Ghostscript can handle devices like printers but can also be used
to display postscript files to your display (via the ghostview program).
<P>
To see if you have ghostscript installed, type the following:
<PRE> 
% gs -v
</PRE> 
"gs" is the command name for the ghostscript program (yes, it's really a
program that has a bunch of output drivers compiled into it).  The -v
option asks it to print version information.  If you have gs installed
you'll see something like this:

</PRE> 
(the dashed lines are just to delimit the output from my email message)  
<P>
This output comes from a version of ghostscript built for a Solaris system
by someone other than myself.  I don't know if this is the default set of
devices you'll see on a Linux distribution or not.
<P>
The "available devices" say which devices you can use with gs.  In this
case the bubble jet 250 is not specifically listed (I suspect it would say
bjc250, but I could be wrong), so I would (if I were using that particular 
printer) have to get the source and read the devices.txt file to find out if 
this printer is supported, either by its own driver or by one of the other 
drivers (perhaps the bjc600 supports it, for example).  
<P>
This is the short explanation.  To summarize, you'll need to familiarize
yourself with Ghostscript and using lpr.  If you're lucky and this printer
is commonly supported by the various Linux distributions then you may
already have this printer configured in the ghostscript you have installed
on your box.
<P>
For information on Ghostscript you'll need to look at the Ghostscript FAQ
at <A
HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsfaq.html">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsfaq.html</A>.
Note that there are two
versions of Ghostscript:  Aladdin's and the GNU version.  Aladdin's is a
commercial product but it's free for personal use.  If you're not planning
on redistributing it then I recommend the Aladdin version.
<P>
Okay, that's all the good news.  I just checked the devices list at
<A HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/devices.html">
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/aladdin/devices.html</A> and it doesn't list the
Canon Color Bubble Jet 250.  If this printer is supported it's either with a
newer, unlisted driver or by one of the other drivers.  You'll probably
need to check the .txt files that come with the source, find the author of
the Color Bubble Jet drivers and drop them a line to see if they know if
this printer will work with one of the existing drivers.
<P>
Hope that helps point you in the right direction.

SMB Printing for users with spaces in their SMB username 
</H3>
Date: Tue, 06 Oct 98 14:31:42 -0800<BR> 
From: <A HREF="mailto:vwdowns@bigfoot.com">vwdowns@bigfoot.com</A> <BR> 
<P>
In order to get SMB printing to work under Red Hat Linux 5.1
with my username
(which has a single space in it), I made the following
addition to the Red Hat print filter "smbprint", located in:
/usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/smbprint
<PRE> 
USER="`echo $usercmd | awk '{printf "%s %s", $2,
$3}'`"%$password
usercmd=""
</PRE> 
(The above lines were inserted just prior to the last line
in the script, which on my
system was):
<PRE> 
(echo "print -"; cat) | /usr/bin/smbclient "$share"
$password -E ${hostip:+-I} $hostip -N -P $usercmd
2>/dev/null
</PRE> 
This has the effect of setting the USER variable to "User
Name"%password, where User Name is the name of the user as
passed in to the script in the $usercmd varible. AWK is used
to strip out the leading "-U" supplied as part of $usercmd
somewhere up the command chain.
<P>
This solution only works for usernames with a single space
in them.  A more complex and full-featured solution would
deal with no spaces or multiple spaces, either way.  In any
case, I feel Red Hat should find a general solution to this
and incorporate it in their next release.
<P>
Warren
<P>
P.S. Thanks for a great forum for sharing tips and tricks
for Linux.  BTW, does Red Hat read these tips?  I'd
appreciate it if someone would submit this bug to them for
fixing.

<B>Generalized fix for SMB printing-- usernames w/spaces</B> 
Date: Wed, 07 Oct 98 06:38:02 -0800<BR> 
From: <A HREF="mailto:vwdowns@bigfoot.com">vwdowns@bigfoot.com</A> <BR> 
<P>
I wrote you earlier about a bug in Red Hat 5.1's
/usr/lib/rhs/rhs-printfilters/smbprint
<P>
I later realized a simple generalized solution, by looking
at the
source code in more detail.  The lines I added before can be 
replaced with:
<PRE> 
export USER="$user"%$password
usercmd=""
</PRE> 
(Just prior to the last line which calls smbclient).
<P>
For a more full-featured fix, simply modify the setting of
$usercmd
to:
1. Replace references to $usercmd with references to $USER.
<P>
2. $USER should be set/exported conditionally as $usercmd is
at present.
<P>
3. $usercmd should be removed entirely from usage.
<P>
The only reliable way to pass a username/password to
smbclient is via
the USER environment variable.
<P>
1. The environment variable will not be seen on the cmd line
by someone running ps, thus not exposing your password
accidentally.
<P>
2. User names/passwords passed on the command line cannot
contain spaces.  If you embed them in quotes, smbclient
keeps the quotes instead of trimming them off, causing
username/password mismatch on the server.  If you leave off
the quotes, normal command-line parsing separates the
username/password into separate parameters, and only the
first word of each will get used.
<P>
Anyone using Red Hat print-filters will want to fix this,
just in case they ever decide to set up SMB printing and are
stuck with spaces in their username/password (as I am).

2 Cent Tip -- Netscape
</H3>

From: Hans-Joachim Baader, <A HREF="mailto:hans@grumbeer.inka.de">

<P>
we all use Netscape every now and then. Most people won't use it as
mailreader since it is too bloated, and the UNIX mailreaders are
generally much better.
<P>
Nevertheless, Netscape seems to create a directory nsmail in the user's
home directory every time it starts and doesn't find it, even if mail
is not used. This is annoying. Here's a trick which doesn't make this
directory go away, but at least makes it invisible.
<P>
I didn't find a GUI equivalent to change this setting so you have to
do the following:
<P>
Edit the file ~/.netscape/preferences.js and change all occurences of
'nsmail' to '.netscape'. The important thing here is, of course, the
leading dot before 'netscape'.

I saw your request for help in the Linux Gazette re Cobol.
I've been using AcuCobol for 2 years under Linux and I strongly recommend
the product and the company.
<P> 
I don't know the cost of the compiler because my company bought it - but
email them and ask for a student copy - they can only refuse...
They have a full development environment called 'AcuBench' which currently
only runs only under Windows.

The amazing thing about AcuCobol is that programs compiled on one platform
will run totally unchanged on another machine - I tend to develop under
Windows but install at clients sites on Linux.
I hope this has been helpful.

This has probably come up before, but the "more fun with pipes" thing in
issue 33 reminded me of it.
<P>
Have a different signature appear in your emails every time you send
one.
<P>
Create a subdrectory in your home called .signatures and copy your
.signature file into it under a visible name.
delete your .signature file and create a pipe in its place using
<PRE> 
mkfifo .signature
</PRE> 
Create a script which simply "cat"s each of the files in the .signatures
directory out to the .signature pipe:
<PRE> 
#!/bin/sh
while true
do
	for SIGNATURE in ${HOME}/.signatures/*
	do
		# Cat each file out to the .signature and throw away any errors.

		cat ${SIGNATURE} > ${HOME}/.signature 2> /dev/null

		# This sleep seems to be required for Netscape to work properly
		# I think buffering on the filesystem can cause multiple signatures
		# to be read otherwise. I think the sleep allows Netscape to see
		# the End Of File.

		sleep 1
	done
done
</PRE> 
Have this script kick off in the background every time you log in to the
system in your profile or xsession. Add more entries to the .signatures
directory and they automatically get used in your emails.
<P>
Issues and problems:<BR> 
One issue might be blocking on the pipe. If there is no process feeding
signature files down the pipe, any programs  which open the pipe can
appear to hang until something is written.

Fixing backspace and delete Key in X-windows
</H3>
Date: Sun, 18 Oct 1998 17:40:28 +1000<BR> 
From: "Steven K.H. Siew",<A HREF="mailto:ksiew@tig.com.au">
ksiew@tig.com.au</A> 
<P>
If you have installed Red Hat version 5.0, you will have come across this
problem. It will not take you long to realise that the backspace key (by
this I mean the key above the ENTER key) and the delete key (by this I mean
the key below the INSERT key and to the left of the END key) behaves
differently on the console than on xterm in X-windows.
<P>
This is extremely irritating if like me you work in both the text-only
console and xterm on X-windows. I set about to make sure that the behaviour
is the same on both of them. In other words I want them to be standardise.
<P>
My solution is to make the backspace, delete and the pageup and pagedown key
to behave exactly like they do in the text-only console. 
<P>
The literature to do this is available on the web, however here I shall show
those who have not done this yet, the steps needed to acheive this. A word
of warning! This is dangerous. You can potentially stuff things up very very
badly. In other words you must do this extremely carefully (and make lots of
backups).
<P>
For your information I included the links below where you may obtain more
details about this matter.

	kcuu1=\EOA, kdch1=\E[3~, kend=\EOe, kent=\EOM, 
</PRE> 
Step five<BR> 
* * * is to create a .terminfo directory, setup the TERMINFO, setup TERM 
as xterm, change into superuser  and then recompile the "xterm" settings file
<PRE> 
original-terminfo-file > mkdir ~/.terminfo

original-terminfo-file > export TERMINFO=~/.terminfo
</PRE> 
    If you are using tcsh, type instead

    If you are using tcsh, type instead
<PRE> 
    original-terminfo-file > setenv TERM xterm

original-terminfo-file > su
password: opensesame

#| tic xterm
</PRE> 
Step six<BR> 
* * * is to change to the ~/.terminfo/x/ directory and copy the xterm file 
to /usr/lib/terminfo/x/xterm 
<PRE> 
#| cd ~/.terminfo/x/
#| cp xterm /usr/lib/terminfo/x/xterm
#| cd ~
#| rm -rf .terminfo
#| exit
ksiew>
</PRE> 
Step seven
* * * is to logoff and log back on (this is to get rid of the TERMINFO
variable) and change the .Xdefaults file
<PRE> 
ksiew> logout
login: ksiew
password: opensesame
ksiew> less .Xdefaults
</PRE> 
<A HREF="./tips_xdefaults.txt">Output from less</A><BR>  
Now change the last few lines from 
<PRE> 
xterm*VT100.Translations: #override\n\
	&lt;KeyPress>gt;Prior : scroll-back(1,page)\n\
	&lt;KeyPress>gt;Next : scroll-forw(1,page)
nxterm*VT100.Translations: #override\n\
	&lt;KeyPress>gt;Prior : scroll-back(1,page)\n\
	&lt;KeyPress>gt;Next : scroll-forw(1,page)

to the following lines 
<PRE> 
xterm*VT100.Translations: #override\n\
	&lt;KeyPress>gt;Prior : string("\033[5~")\n\
	&lt;KeyPress>gt;Next  : string("\033[6~")
nxterm*VT100.Translations: #override\n\
	&lt;KeyPress>gt;Prior : string("\033[5~")\n\
	&lt;KeyPress>gt;Next  : string("\033[6~")
*VT100.Translations: #override \
        &lt;Key>gt;BackSpace: string(0x7F)\n\
        &lt;Key>gt;Delete:    string("\033[3~")\n\
        &lt;Key>gt;Home:      string("\033[1~")\n\
        &lt;Key>gt;End:       string("\033[4~")
*ttyModes: erase ^?
</PRE> 
That's it! Save the .Xdefaults file and now you can start X-windows and
the backspace key, the delete key, the pageup key and the pagedown key
will work just like in the text-only console window.

Creating bzgrep Program

If you have ever used zgrep on gzip-textfiles then you would have realise
what a wonderful it is. The program zgrep allows you to grep a textfile even
if the text file is compressed in gzip format. Not only that it can also
grep a uncompress textfile. For example if you have the following directory
<PRE> 
testing > ls -al
total 2086
drwxrwxr-x   2 ksiew    ksiew        1024 Oct 18 11:07 .

-rwxrwxr-x   1 ksiew    ksiew      582867 Oct 18 11:00 moon10a.txt
</PRE> 
Then if you are looking for the word "haste",
<PRE> 
testing > zgrep -l haste *
cortes.txt
lost_world_10.txt.gz
moon10a.txt
</PRE> 
Tells you that "haste" is in all three files.
<P>
Now if you compress a textfile using the famous bzip2 compress program, you
have a problem.
<PRE> 
testing > bzip2 cortes.txt 
testing > ls -al
total 1098
drwxrwxr-x   2 ksiew    ksiew        1024 Oct 18 11:12 .

testing > zgrep -l haste *
lost_world_10.txt.gz
moon10a.txt
</PRE> 
What happen now is that zgrep no longer recognise the file cortes.txt.bz2 as
a compress text file. 
<P>
What we need is a new program bzgrep which can recognise bzip2 compress text
files.
<P>
The best way to create bzgrep file is to modify the existing zgrep file.
<PRE> 
testing > locate zgrep
/usr/bin/zgrep
/usr/man/man1/zgrep.1

testing > su
password: opensesame
#| cp /usr/bin/zgrep /usr/local/bin/bzgrep
</PRE> 
The bzgrep file is a copy of zgrep file can contain
<A HREF="./tips_zgrep.txt">this text</A>.
<P> 
We cannot change the last few lines to the following
<P>
<pre>
res=0
for i do
  if test $list -eq 1; then
    bzip2 -cdf "$i" | $grep $opt "$pat" &gt; /dev/null && echo $i
    r=$?
  elif test $# -eq 1 -o $silent -eq 1; then
    bzip2 -cdf "$i" | $grep $opt "$pat"
    r=$?
  else
    bzip2 -cdf "$i" | $grep $opt "$pat" | sed "s|^|${i}:|"
    r=$?
  fi
  test "$r" -ne 0 && res="$r"
done
exit $res
</pre>
<P>
Now the bzgrep file is a program that will be able to grep bzip2 compressed
textfiles. BUT there is a problem.
<P>
bzgrep program WILL NOT recognise ordinary textfiles or gzip compress
textfiles. This is a major problem! It means you have to compress all your
textfiles with bzip2 in order to use bzgrep program.
<P>
Luckily there is always a solution in Linux. All we have to do is alter
the program to be more choosy on which decompression program to use. ie. Do
it uses <tt>gzip -cdfq or bzip2 -cdf</tt>
<P>
Now change the last few lines again to resemble this
<PRE> 
res=0
for i do
  case "$i" in

  *.bz2 )
      if test $list -eq 1; then
        bzip2 -cdf "$i" | $grep $opt "$pat" > /dev/null && echo $i

Hi... Mike, I read your article about the Linux in palm pilot.Its very
intersting.Iam kind of new in LINUX platform! Because Iam so curious
about Linux. I bought a palm pilot 111 the new version of palm with 2meg
of memory.the main problem is, I don't know where to get the Linux
operating system that it runs on palm pilot 111 the newer version. what
about the HOW TO LINUX DOCUMENTATION FROM from its official site?
Once I get this software do I run this in Linux operating system then
transfer this to palm 111? Iam kind novice in Linux. If you could help
me.I would gladly appreciated. Thanks a lot....
</font></blockquote> 
Actually, you don't run Linux on the PalmPilot itself (although there is a
project to do so - I don't know much about that however).  You run Linux on
your PC and transfer data files between the Linux system and the Pilot.
You still run the same programs you normally would *on* the PalmPilot -
it's just that you can transfer these programs and their data file to the
Pilot using tools on Linux.
<P>
Don't let using Linux confuse you.  You use Linux in the same way you use
Microsoft Windows - it runs on your PC to do word processing or
spreadsheets or whatever.  You then pass data files back and forth the the
Pilot using special tools.
<P>
If you want to try out a program that helps transfer files back and forth
you can try my XNotesPlus.  Its a sticky notes program that will allow you
do backups of your Pilot to your local hard disk and will transfer the
Address database from the Pilot to be used in doing some simple printing of
envelopes.  You can download the program from 
<A HREF="http://www.graphics-muse.org/xnotes/xnotes.html">
http://www.graphics-muse.org/xnotes/xnotes.html</A>.  You will also need to get
the PilotLink software that I described in the article you read.
XNotesPlus uses PilotLink to do the actual data transfers to and from the
Pilot.
<P>
Hope this helps.

Red Hat 5.1 + Acrobat Reader 3.01 HOWTO
</H3>
Date: Thu, 22 Oct 1998 22:55:27 -0400<BR> 
From: Louis-Philippe Brais, <A HREF="mailto:lpbrais@grm94.polymtl.ca">
lpbrais@grm94.polymtl.ca</A> 
<P>
Some people I know went nuts trying to install Acrobat Reader 3.01 as a
helper app in Netscape, as shipped with Red Hat Linux 5.1.  Here's how
I've done it:
<P>
1.  Download Acrobat Reader 3.01 from ftp.adobe.com.  Let the installer
    script install the whole thing under /usr/local/Acrobat3.
<P>
2.  Create the following shell script:
/usr/local/Acrobat3/bin/nsacroread
<PRE> 
    #!/bin/sh
    unset LD_PRELOAD
    exec /usr/local/Acrobat3/bin/acroread $* >$HOME/.nsacroread-errors
2>&1
</PRE>
<P>
3.  Don't forget to make this script executable:
<PRE> 
    # chmod 755 /usr/local/Acrobat3/bin/nsacroread
</PRE> 
4.  If the directory /usr/local/lib/netscape doesn't already exist,
create
    it.
<P>
5.  Copy (exactly) the following two files into this directory.
<P> 
mailcap:
<PRE> 
      #mailcap entry added by Netscape Helper
      application/pdf;/usr/local/Acrobat3/bin/nsacroread -tempFile %s
</PRE> 
mime.types:
<PRE> 
      #--Netscape Communications Corporation MIME Information
      #Do not delete the above line. It is used to identify the file
type.
      #
      #mime types added by Netscape Helper
      type=application/pdf  \
      desc="Acrobat Reader"  \
      exts="pdf" 
</PRE> 
<p>
Note:  You can do without the last two steps and instead configure the
helper apps with the Edit &gt;&gt; Preferences menu of Netscape.  This will
create similar .mailcap and .mime.types files in the user's home dir. 
But IMHO the first method is best because this way you can configure
Acrobat Reader for all users at once.
<P>
Cheers,<BR>

2 $.25 tips

1. I was having some real problems with Netscape (3.04 Gold) the other
day. No matter what I did, I could not get the helpers to work.
Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew that they had worked in the
past, but I couldn't see anything that I'd changed. A few messages on
various newsgroups turned on the lights: I had upgraded my Bash to
2.0.0--and this version has a bug in it. Expressions of the form ((..)
.. ) are interpreted as arithmetic expressions, rather than nested
sub-shells. Upgrading to 2.02.1(1) was almost painless and fixed the
Netscape problem.
<P>
To get 2.02.1(1) go to the gnu site (www.gnu.org) and follow the links
to the software sections. The new software should compile out of the box
(it did for me). One problem I had was that the install script put the
new binaries in /usr/local/bin, and since I had my old versions in
/usr/bin they weren't found. A quick mv solved that.
<P>
2. For a number of years I've been struggling trying to read the results
of color-ls on my xterm screens. A number of the colors (green and blue)
were just too bright to read. I didn't want to turn down the brightness
of my monitor...so I mostly just squinted. For some reason I was looking
at the XTerm.ad file, and noticed that the colors could be adjusted! The
XTerm.ad file should be located in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults (or
something similar). It is read each time a new xterm start up and sets
various options. If you look near the end of this file you'll see a
number of definitions for the VT100 colors. I changed:
<PRE>
	*VT100*color2: green3
</PRE> 
to
<PRE> 
	*VT100*color2: green4
</PRE> 
and
<PRE> 
	*VT100*color6: cyan3
</PRE> 
to
<PRE> 
	*VT100*color6: cyan4
</PRE> 
Like magic, the colors are darkened and I can read the results. If you
don't want to fool with your global default file, you could also just
add the entries to your ~/.Xresources file.

S3 Virge/DX and XFree
</H3>
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 1998 00:56:25 -0500 (EST)<BR> 
From: "Andy K. Jalics", <A HREF="mailto:ab212@acorn.net">
ab212@acorn.net</A> 
<P>
I had a S3 Virge/DX, and couldn't get it working well in XFree.
This made me very mad since there is a specific XFREE_S3V (S3 virge
server).
<P> 
I used a borrowed Xaccel, but it made me feel guilty real quick. :)
So I decided that I need to get XFree configured well, and then ditch
Xaccel. I found that xfree86config can not be well used to configure a
Virge. 
<P> 
Here are the modelines I use for a mid-range 17 inch monitor @ 16bpp using
the SVGA server.
*WARNING* If this blows up your monitor/card, It's not my fault, although
it shouldn't.
<PRE> 
   Modeline "640x480"    31.5   640  680  720  864   480  488  491  521

   Modeline "640x400"     36     640  696  752  832   480  481  484 509 -HSync -VSync
   Modeline "800x600"     40     800  840  968 1056   600  601  605  628 +hsync +vsync

</PRE> 
This cured me of using Xaccel, and should cure your S3 Virge blues.
P.S. A S3 Virge can go up to 1600x1000?
