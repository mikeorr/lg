<h1>Easy Shell Scripting</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/cherian.html">Blessen Cherian</A></b></p>


<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
Shell scripting can be defined as a group of commands executed in sequence.
Let's start by describing the steps needed to write and execute a shell script:
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the file using an editor (e.g., "vi" or "pico".)</em>
</p>

<pre>
vi Firstshellscript.sh
</pre>

<p>
<em><strong>Step 2:</strong> All shell scripts should begin with
"#!/bin/bash" or whatever other shell you prefer. This line is called the
shebang, and although it looks like a comment, it's not: it notifies the
shell of the interpreter to be used for the script. The provided path must
be an absolute one (you can't just use "bash", for example), and the
shebang must be located on the first line of the script without any
preceding space.</em>
</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Step 3:</strong> Write the code that you want to develop.  Our
first shell script will be the usual "Hello World" routine, which we'll
place in a file called 'Firstshellscript.sh'.</em> </p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
echo "Hello World"
</pre>

<p>
<em><strong>Step 4:</strong>The next step is to make the script
executable by using the "chmod" command.</em> </p> 

<pre>
chmod 744 Firstshellscript.sh
</pre>

<p>
or
</p>

<pre>
chmod +x Firstshellscript.sh
</pre>

<p>
<em><strong>Step 5:</strong> Execute the script. This can be done by
entering the name of the script on the command line, preceded by its path.
If it's in the current directory, this is very simple:</em>
</p>

<pre>
bash$ ./Firstshellscript.sh
Hello World
</pre>

<p>
If you want to see the execution step-by-step - which is very useful for
troubleshooting - then execute it with the '-x' ('expand arguments') option:
</p>

<pre>
sh -x Firstshellscript.sh
+ echo 'Hello World'
Hello World
</pre>

<p>
To see the contents of a script, you can use the 'cat' command or
simply open the script in any text editor:</p>

<pre>
bash$ cat Firstshellscript.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo Hello World
</pre>

<h3>Comments in a Shell</h3>

<p>
In shell scripting, all lines beginning with # are comments.
</p>
<pre>
# This is a comment line.
# This is another comment line.
</pre>

<p> You can also have comments that span multiple lines by using a colon
and single quotes:</p>

<pre>
: 'This is a comment line.

Again, this is a comment line.

My God, this is yet another comment line.'
</pre>

<p>
Note: This will not work if there is a single quote mark within
the quoted contents.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p> As you may or may not know, variables are the most significant part of
any programming language, be it Perl, C, or shell scripting. In the shell,
variables are classified as either system variables or user-defined
variables.</p>

<h4>System Variables</h4>

<p>
System variables are defined and kept in the environment of the <em>parent
shell</em> (the shell from which your script is launched.)  They are also
called environment variables. These variable names consist of capital
letters, and can be seen by executing the 'set' command. Examples of system
variables are PWD, HOME, USER, etc. The values of these system variables can
be displayed individually by "echo"ing the system variables. E.g.,
<code>echo $HOME</code> will display the value stored in the system variable
HOME.</p>

<p>
When setting a system variable, be sure to use the "export" command to make
it available to the <em>child shells</em> (any shells that are spawned from
the current one, including scripts):
</p>

<pre>
bash$ SCRIPT_PATH=/home/blessen/shellscript
bash$ export SCRIPT_PATH
</pre>

<p>
Modern shells also allow doing all this in one pass:
</p>

<pre>
bash$ export SCRIPT_PATH=/home/blessen/shellscript
</pre>


<h4>User-Defined Variables</h4>

<p> These are the variables that are normally used in scripting - ones that
you don't want or need to make available to other programs. Their names
cannot start with numbers, and are written using lower case letters and
underscores by convention - e.g. 'define_tempval'.</p>

<p> When we assign a value to a variable, we write the variable name
followed by '=' which is immediately followed by the value, e.g.,
<code>define_tempval=blessen</code> (note that there must not be any spaces
around the equals sign.) Now, to use or display the value in
<code>define_tempval</code>, we have to use the <code>echo</code> command
and precede the variable name with a '$' sign,
i.e.: </p>

<pre>
bash$ echo $define_tempval 
blessen
</pre>

<p>
The following script sets a variable named "username"
and displays its content when executed.</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

username=blessen
echo "The username is $username"
</pre>

<h4>Commandline Arguments</h4>

<p> These are variables that contain the arguments to a script when it is
run. These variables are accessed using $1, $2, ... $n, where $1 is the first
command-line argument, $2 the second, etc. Arguments are delimited by spaces. $0
is the name of the script. The variable $# will display the number of
command-line arguments supplied; this number is limited to 9 arguments in
the older shells, and is practically unlimited in the modern ones.</p>

<p>
Consider a script that will take two command-line arguments and display
them. We'll call it 'commandline.sh':
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

echo "The first variable is $1"
echo "The second variable is $2"
</pre>

<p>
When I execute 'commandline.sh' with command-line arguments like "blessen" 
and "lijoe", the output looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
bash$ ./commandline.sh blessen lijoe
The first variable is blessen
The second variable is lijoe
</pre>

<h4>Exit status variable</h4>

<p> This variable tells us if the last command executed was successful or
not.  It is represented by $?.  A value of 0 means that the command was
successful.  Any other number means that the command was unsuccessful
(although a few programs such as 'mail' use a non-zero return to indicate
status rather than failure.) Thus, it is very useful in scripting.</p>

<p> To test this, create a file named "test", by running <code>touch test</code> .
Then, "display" the content of the file:</p>

<pre>
bash$ cat test
</pre>

<p>
Then, check the value of $?.
</p>

<pre>
bash$ echo $?
0
</pre>

<p>
The value is zero because the command was successful. Now try running 'cat'
on a file that isn't there:</p>

<pre>
bash$ cat xyz1
bash$ echo $?
1
</pre>

<p>
The value 1 shows that the above command was unsuccessful.
</p>


<h4>Scope of a Variable</h4>

<p> I am sure most programmers have learned (and probably worked with)
variables and the concept of <code>scope</code> (that is, a definition of
where a variable has meaning.) In shell programming, we also use the scope
of a variable for various programming tasks - although this is very rarely
necessary, it can be a useful tool. In the shell, there are two types of
scope: global and local. Local variables are defined by using a "local" tag
preceding the variable name when it is defined; all other variables, except
for those associated with function arguments, are global, and thus
accessible from anywhere within the script.  The script below demonstrates
the differing scopes of a local variable and a global one:</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

display()
{
    local local_var=100
    global_var=blessen
    echo "local variable is $local_var"
    echo "global variable is $global_var"
}

echo "======================"
display
echo "=======outside ========"
echo "local variable outside function is $local_var"
echo "global variable outside function is $global_var"
</pre>

<p> Running the above produces the following output: </p>

<pre>
======================
local variable is 100
global variable is blessen
=======outside ========
local variable outside function is 
global variable outside function is blessen
</pre>

<p> Note the absence of any value for the local variable outside the
function. </p>


<h3>Input and Output in Shell Scripting</h3>

<p> For accepting input from the keyboard, we use <code>read</code>. This command
will read values typed from the keyboard, and assign each to the variable
specified for it.</p>

<pre>
read &lt;variable_name&gt;
</pre>

<p>
For output, we use the <code>echo</code> command.
</p>

<pre>
echo "statement to be displayed"
</pre>


<h3>Arithmetic Operations in Shell Scripting</h3>

<p> Like other scripting languages, shell scripting also allows us to use
arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. To use these, one uses a function called <code>expr</code>; e.g.,
"expr a + b" means 'add a and b'.  </p>

<p>
e.g.: 
</p>

<pre>
sum=`expr 12 + 20`
</pre>

<p>
Similar syntax can be used for subtraction, division, and
multiplication. There is another way to handle arithmetic operations;
enclose the variables and the equation inside a square-bracket expression starting
with a "$" sign. The syntax is</p>

<pre>
$[expression operation statement]
</pre>

<p>
e.g.: 
</p>

<pre>
echo $[12 + 10]
</pre>

<p class="editorial">[ Note that this syntax is not universal; e.g., it
will fail in the Korn shell. The '$((...))' syntax is more shell-agnostic;
better yet, on the general principle of "let the shell do what it does best
and leave the rest to the standard toolkit", use a calculator program such
as 'bc' or 'dc' and command substitution. Also, note that shell arithmetic
is integer-only, while the above two methods have no such problem. -- Ben ]
</p>

<h3>Conditional Statements</h3>

<p>
Let's have some fun with a conditional statement like "if condition".
Most of the time, we shell programmers have situations where we have to
compare two variables, and then execute certain statements depending on
the truth or falsity of the condition. So, in such cases, we
have to use an "if" statement.  The syntax is show below:</p>

<pre>
if [ conditional statement ]
then
	... Any commands/statements ...
fi
</pre>

<p>
The script cited below will prompt for a username, and if
the user name is "blessen", will display a message showing that I
have successfully logged in. Otherwise it will display
the message "wrong username".</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

echo "Enter your username:"
read username

if [ "$username" = "blessen" ]
then
	echo 'Success!!! You are now logged in.'
else
	echo 'Sorry, wrong username.'
fi
</pre>

<p> Remember to always enclose the variable being tested in double quotes;
not doing so will cause your script to fail due to incorrect syntax when
the variable is empty. Also, the square brackets (which are an alias for
the 'test' command) must have a space following the opening bracket and
preceding the closing one.</p>


<h3>Variable Comparison</h3>

<p>
In shell scripting we can perform variable comparison.
If the values of variables to be compared are numerical, then you have
to use these options:</p>

<p>
-eq Equal to<br />
-ne Not Equal to<br />
-lt Less than<br />
-le Less than or equal to<br />
-gt Greater than<br />
-ge Greater then or equal to<br />
</p>

<p>
If they are strings, then you have to
use these options:</p>

<p>
= Equal to<br />
!= Not Equal to<br />
&lt; First string sorts before second<br />
&gt; First string sorts after second<br />
</p> 

<h3>Loops</h3>

<h4>The "for" Loop</h4>

<p>
The most commonly used loop is the "for" loop. In shell scripting,
there are two types: one that is similar to C's "for"
loop, and an iterator (list processing) loop.</p>

<p>
Syntax for the first type of "for" loop (again, this type is only available
in modern shells):
</p> 

<pre>
for ((initialization; condition; increment/decrement))
do
	...statements...
done
</pre>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

for (( i=1; $i &lt;= 10; i++ ))
do
	echo $i
done
</pre>

<p> This will produce a list of numbers from 1 to 10. The syntax for the
second, more widely-available, type of "for" loop is:
</p> 

<pre>
for &lt;variable&gt; in &lt;list&gt;
do
	...statements...
done
</pre>

<p>
This script will read the contents of '/etc/group'
and display each line, one at a time:</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

count=0
for i in `cat /etc/group`
do
	count=`expr "$count" + 1`
	echo "Line $count is being displayed"
	echo $i
done

echo "End of file"
</pre>

<p>
Another example of the "for" loop uses "seq" to
generate a sequence:</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

for i in `seq 1 5`
do
	echo $i
done
</pre>

<h3>While Loop</h3>

<p> The "while" loop is another useful loop used in all programming
languages; it will continue to execute until the condition specified
becomes false.  </p>

<pre>
while [ condition ]
do
	...statement...
done
</pre>

<p> The following script assigns the value "1" to the variable <code>num</code> and
adds one to the value of <code>num</code> each time it goes around the loop, as
long as the value of <code>num</code> is less than 5.</p>


<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

num=1

while [$num -lt 5]; do num=$[$num + 1]; echo $num; done
</pre>

</strong>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<h3>Select and Case Statement</h3>

<p>
Similar to the "switch/case" construct in C programming, the combination of
"select" and "case" provides shell programmers with the same features.
The "select" statement is not part of the "case" statement, but
I've put the two of them together to illustrate how both can be used
in programming.</p>

<p>
Syntax of select:
</p>

<pre>
select &lt;variable&gt; in &lt;list&gt;
do
	...statements...
done
</pre>

<p>
Syntax of case:
</p>

<pre>
case $&lt;variable&gt; in
	&lt;option1&gt;) statements ;;
	&lt;option2&gt;) statements ;;
	*) echo "Sorry, wrong option" ;;
esac
</pre>

<p>
The example below will explain the usage of select and case together,
and display options involving a machine's services needing to be restarted.
When the user selects a particular option, the script starts the
corresponding service.</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash

echo "***********************"
select opt in apache named sendmail
	do
	case $opt in
		apache) 	/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart;;
		named) 		/etc/rc.d/init.d/named restart;;
		sendmail)	/etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail restart;;
		*) 			echo "Nothing will be restarted"
	esac
	echo "***********************"

	# If this break is not here, then we won't get a shell prompt.
	break

done
</pre>

<p class="editorial">[ Rather than using an explicit 'break' statement -
which is not useful if you want to execute more than one of the presented
options - it is much better to include 'Quit' as the last option in the
select list, along with a matching case statement. -- Ben ]
</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>
In the modern world where all programmers use the OOP model for
programming, even we shell programmers aren't far behind. We too can break
our code into small chunks called functions, and call them by name in
the main program. This approach helps in debugging, code re-usability,
etc.</p>

<p>
Syntax for "function" is:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;name of function&gt; ()
{	# start of function
	statements
} 	# end of function
</pre>

<p> Functions are invoked by citing their names in the main program,
optionally followed by arguments. For example: </p>


<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh

sumcalc ()
{
	sum=$[$1 + $2]
}

echo "Enter the first number:"
read num1
echo "Enter the second number:"
read num2

sumcalc $num1 $num2

echo "Output from function sumcalc: $sum"
</pre>

<h3>Debugging Shell Scripts</h3>

<p> Now and then, we need to debug our programs.  To do so, we use the '-x'
and '-v' options of the shell. The '-v' option produces verbose output. The
'-x' option will expand each simple command, "for" command, "case" command,
"select" command, or arithmetic "for" command, displaying the expanded
value of PS4, followed by the command and its expanded arguments or
associated word list. Try them in that order - they can be very helpful
when you can't figure out the location of a problem in your script.</p>
