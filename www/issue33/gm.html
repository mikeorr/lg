<IMG SRC="../gx/hammel/t.gif" ALT="T" HEIGHT=28 WIDTH=26 ALIGN=LEFT>his column
is dedicated to the use, creation, distribution, and discussion of computer
graphics tools for Linux systems.
<P>Wow, what a month.&nbsp; Since I'd finished working on my Gimp book
in July and early August, I had all of September to work on my Muse column.&nbsp;
Its been quite some time since I've been able to devote this much time
to the Muse.&nbsp;&nbsp; I managed to keep up to date on all the product
announcements made over on Slashdot, freshmeat, and on comp.os.linus.announce.&nbsp;
And there were a ton of them.&nbsp; So many, in fact, I considered leaving
some out just to keep this page from being too large.&nbsp; But that didn't
seem right, so this month the Muse is a big, big column.
<P>What we've got this month for you:
<UL>
<LI>
Visual DHTML from Netscape - a review of their initial release</LI>

<LI>
Configuring and using X Input for use with Wacom drawing tablets</LI>
</UL>
I got rather motivated with all this extra time on my hands.&nbsp; First,
I planned some hardware research into getting X Input running, which then
lead to plans for an article on off the shelf video boards.&nbsp; This
latter idea will be in next months issue since its quite a bit of information
to gather and organize.&nbsp; I got quite a bit of help on the X Input
issues from Owen Taylor.&nbsp; His tips got me up and running with X Input
and allowed me to gather some reasonable information for helping my readers
do the same.&nbsp; Along with X Input, I've got a review of Netscapes Visual
DHTML in the Web Wonderings section.
<P>You may also want to take a look at the new and improved <A HREF="http://www.graphics-muse.org">Graphics
Muse Website</A>.&nbsp; I've complete revamped the site.&nbsp; The old
Linux Graphics mini-Howto and Unix Graphics Utilities pages are no more
- they've been replaced by a searchable database of graphics tools, texts,
news stories, and reviews.&nbsp; No more frames either, at least not in
the Linux specific sections (my bio page still uses them, however).&nbsp;
Its not as nice as Slashdot or Freshmeat, but its better than the static
frame-based pages I had before.&nbsp; Hopefully, everyone will find these
updates to their liking.&nbsp; It should certainly make finding tools a
little easier.&nbsp; At least that was the plan when I started on it.
<P>For those who don't want to see the new graphics in my portal pages,
you can jump straight to the <A HREF="http://www.graphics-muse.org/linux.html">Linux
specific section</A>.&nbsp; But take a look at the graphics in the <A HREF="http://www.graphics-muse.org">portals</A>
some time.&nbsp; I really kind of like them.

Thanks to widely spreading Windows, you can get a large variety of TrueType
fonts at no or relatively low cost. X-TT supports various font transformations,
such as slanting or magnifying which makes X-TT very useful for X users
especially in far-east Asia, including Japan. These users have been suffering
a bitter experience that only a few fonts were available.

&nbsp;<B><I><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">Mesa</FONT></I></B> is a 3-D graphics

Mesa cannot be called an implementation of OpenGL since the author did
not obtain an OpenGL license from SGI. Furthermore, Mesa cannot claim OpenGL
conformance since the conformance tests are only available to OpenGL licensees.
Despite these technical/legal terms, you may find Mesa to be a valid alternative
to OpenGL. Most applications written for OpenGL can use Mesa instead without
changing the source code.

SciTech is readying the first release of SciTech Display Doctor for Linux!</H2>
SciTech Display Doctor is the universal display driver utility that supports
over 250 different graphics chips -- just about every one ever made. SciTech
Display Doctor for Linux will bring SciTech's proven device driver technology
to the Linux platform (x86 only at this point in time).
<P>SciTech is looking for all types of Linux users to help us stress test
the utility before its final release. If you would like to participate
in a beta, please contact <A HREF="mailto:KendallB@scitechsoft.com">KendallB@scitechsoft.com</A>
or visit the SciTech Web site at <A HREF="http://www.scitechsoft.com">http://www.scitechsoft.com</A>.
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#006600">Editors Note</FONT></B>:&nbsp; a form for registering
to participate in the beta release program accompanied this announcement
in comp.os.linux.announce, however I felt it was a bit too large for inclusion
here.&nbsp; The form doesn't appear to be on their web site, so you'll
probably need to send email to the above contact address to request a copy
of
the form.&nbsp; Also, this program may have already expired by the time
this column reaches you.&nbsp; Display Doctor may already be released for
Linux by that time.

OpenGL driver for xmame in development</H2>
Slashdot reports that an OpenGL display driver is being worked on for xmame.
<B><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">Xmame</FONT></B>
is the MultiArcade Machine Emulator, basically a way to port lots of old
arcade style video games to X windows.&nbsp; The OpenGL driver allows you
to do vector graphics direct to the hardware, eliminating the need to render
to bitmaps first.&nbsp; It also allows easy scaling of the game (ie for
larger displays) and bilinear filtering.&nbsp; The latter allows for a
cleaner display using anti-aliased lines and lettering after scaling or
rotations.

Q and A</H2>
<I>Q:</I>&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>I want to place a block of text with evenly single-spaced
lines using some arbitrary font onto my Gimp image.&nbsp; Rather than doing
it line by line with the Text Tool, is there an easier way?</I>
<P>A:&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Use the ASCII 2 Image script:
<UL>Xtns->Script-Fu->Utils->ASCII 2 Image</UL>
or
<UL>Script-Fu->Utils->ASCII 2 Image Layer</UL>
The former is available from the Toolbox, the latter from an Image Window.&nbsp;
Both of these options run a Script-Fu script that reads in a text file
and turns it into one or more layers using the font you specify.&nbsp;
If you're installation does not have this script, check the <A HREF="http://registry.gimp.org/">Plug-In
Registry.</A>
<P>Q:&nbsp; A Gimp-User mailing list member asked - <I>A few months back
someone posted a method (maybe a script) for making text look like it was
dripping, as if it had just been painted on and the paint.</I>

I write the Graphics Muse column for the Linux Gazette and maintain the
list of graphics tools for Linux/Unix systems on my web site (<A HREF="http://www.graphics-muse.org">www.graphics-muse.org</A>,
which is undergoing a major rewrite at this time).&nbsp; I was curious
if you've tried Magician on Linux platforms and, if so, what sort of success
you had with it.&nbsp; I'm still not clear on the use of the runtime and
development environs for Java on Linux, so a little info from a commercial
venture who might have some insight on this would be helpful to my readers.</I>
<P>And his reply to me follows:
<UL>Magician supports Linux both libc and glibc variants on a bunch of
the JDK ports (except JDK-1.1.6 which seems hopelessly busted in many places
). We're in the process of porting to Kaffe and the OpenGroup JVM as well
for Linux.&nbsp; MkLinux support in the near future is planned as is SparcLinux.
Basically, we support Linux.
<P>It runs pretty fast even though it's using the slightly slow Mesa OpenGL-a-like
implementation and supports hardware acceleration where Mesa supports it,
typically on Voodoo Graphics accelerators.</UL>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#993300">'Muse</FONT></I></B>:&nbsp; I did notice the
note on portability, but Linux was specifically mentioned so I thought
I'd ask.
<UL>Yup. The identical Java code is supplied for Windows95/98/NT, Linux,
Irix, Solaris, OS/2, AIX and MacOS so far. BeOS ports will happen when
Be supply a JVM that we can write to. So, it's pretty damn portable!</UL>

other formats.</UL>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#993300">'Muse</FONT></I></B>:&nbsp; My only objection
to doing a review of PIL is that I don't know Python.&nbsp; As it is I'm
behind the curve on languages.&nbsp; I just picked up Perl and want to
learn Java and Tcl/Tk (I'm a GUI programmer by trade, and these are tools
I hear requests for in potential jobs).&nbsp; Plus I have to learn Scheme
in order to offer tips for Gimp developers (another reason to learn Perl
and Tcl, since these also have scripting extensions for Gimp).&nbsp; Python
is Yet Another Language and its hard to find the time to learn them all.
<P>However, I'll put it on my list of things to do.&nbsp; If you'd like
to write a review for this package and have it included in the Graphics
Muse column (with full credit to you, of course) feel free to send it my
way.&nbsp; I'll make sure it gets included (I may edit it a little to make
sure it reads well, but thats about it).

wrote to take a minor issue with last months Perl advice in the Muse:
<UL>I have a small issue with your advice on Perl which you dish out in
your Graphics Muse in issue 32 of <A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net">Linux
Gazette</A>.&nbsp; You write:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>"The ampersand is important - you should always prefix calls to your
subroutines with the ampersand.&nbsp; Although things may work properly
if you don't, proper Perl syntax suggests the results can be unexpected
if you don't use the ampersand."</UL>
Quite to the contrary!&nbsp; The above was indeed valid for an obsolete
Perl 4.&nbsp; Nowadays this is straight from 'man perlstyle' which undoubtely
you have installed on your machine and which is a worthwhile reading:
<BR>&nbsp;
<UL>Call your subroutines as if they were functions or list operators to
avoid excessive ampersands and parentheses.</UL>
Things not only "may work properly" without this ampersand but are guaranteed
to work if you either defined or declared your subroutines before the first
use and ampersands are really retained for a backwards compatibility.&nbsp;
Prevailing practice among people who really know Perl is to avoid spurious
ampesands to even greater degree than the quoted documentation may suggest.&nbsp;
See, for example, perl tutorials on Randal Schwartz web page (<A HREF="http://www.stonehenge.com">www.stonehenge.com</A>).
This implies that if you do not want/can't define your subroutines early
then you <B><I>should</I></B> declare them (and "use strict").&nbsp; One
reason is that if you would happen to reimplement your subroutine as a
function provided by a new module you would be hunting for those pesky
ampersands all over the place.
<P>Nobody will run you out of town for an excessive use of punctuation
in a Perl code - if these are your private kinks.&nbsp; But claims in a
widely published material that one <B><I>should</I></B> do that, instead
of presenting this as an unhealthy personal habit, is a totally different
matter.</UL>
<B><I><FONT COLOR="#993300">'Muse</FONT></I></B>:&nbsp; You're obviously
more well versed in Perl than I, so I bow to your recommendations here.&nbsp;
I had wondered why the ampersands didn't seem necessary (I had left them
off initially for some routines which were not previously declared).&nbsp;
I also thought they seemed rather unwiedly and wondered why a language
such as Perl, which I am quite fond of after my first few weeks of working
with it, would use such a syntax.&nbsp; Your response clarifies the situation
for me.&nbsp; Many thanks for your letter.
<P>However, I would like to address a few points about your reply.&nbsp;
First, I don't have the perl documentation installed.&nbsp; I did install
Perl 5 binaries at one point, but I don't (currently) run Perl at home
- I run it on my Web server, whose Perl installation is handled by the
commercial Web server provider (<A HREF="http://www.vservers.com">vservers.com</A>).&nbsp;
I ran "man perlstyle" but it died trying to display the page for unknown
reasons.&nbsp; Same thing with any of the man pages I tried for Perl on
that system.&nbsp; So my sources at the time the article was written were
the two documents I listed:&nbsp; <B><U>Programming Perl</U></B> by Wall
&amp; Schwartz and the <B><U>Official Guide to Programming with CGI.pm</U></B>
by Stein.&nbsp; The former is where I got the information about using ampersands
for subroutines.&nbsp; Perhaps this is an outdated document - although
I had just purchased it from Borders Books, its print date appears to be
1992!&nbsp; Still, its all I had.&nbsp; Yes, the Perl archives have documenation
too, but I also have deadlines.&nbsp; The problem with writing articles
(I've slowly discovered) is choosing between reaching a certain level of
expertise and actually getting something out to my readers.&nbsp; In this
case, I just happened to be working with Perl, so thats how I chose to
write about Perl.&nbsp; In fact, its pretty much how every months articles
get written.&nbsp; Whatever I happened to be working on that month.&nbsp;
But it limits how much of an expert I can become before I have to start
writing.&nbsp; Its not a very good excuse, but it is the reality of trying
to do this column.&nbsp; Writing is much more work than I had expected.
<P>But, "unhealthy"?&nbsp; Hmmm.&nbsp; The excessive use of ampersands
doesn't seem to have affected my current bench press max....

Visual DHTML from Netscape</H2>
Last month I came across an announcement that Netscape had released a graphical-based
interface for designing Dynamic HTML, otherwise known as DHTML.&nbsp; DHTML
is the next phase of the evolution of HTML and allows for more animated
and configurable Web pages using a programmatic interface (as opposed to
using, for example, the animation features of the GIF image file format).&nbsp;
With DHTML and JavaScript you can implement such features as drag and drop,
menus and scrolling text subwindows.&nbsp; Netscape's tool for supporting
DHTML is known as <B><I><FONT COLOR="#CC6600">VisualDHTML</FONT></I></B>.&nbsp;
Although not supported officially, I thought it would be interesting to
explore the features and problems of this new product as a way of getting
a little more exposure to one of the Web's latest markup languages.
<P><B>Where do you get it?</B>
<P>VisualDHTML, which I'll shorten to VDHTML for this article, is a actually
a tool written in entirely in DHTML.&nbsp; It is available from <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/examples/dynhtml/visual/index.html">Netscape's
Web site</A>.&nbsp; Since it is written in a form of HTML you can actually
run it across the network, but you may find it more convenient to download
the complete package from their web site to your local hard disk.&nbsp;
In the tests I ran I found that the performance was significantly better
running locally.
<P>The download page for VDHTML is the same as the index page in the package
you download.&nbsp; The download file is a zip file which you can save
to any local directory.&nbsp; Use the Linux (or equivalent) "unzip" command
to unpackage the files, which will be placed in a newly created directory
called "visual".
<P>The only prerequsite for running VDHTML is that you have a browser that
supports JavaScript 1.2.&nbsp; That fairly well eliminates all browsers
except Netscape Communicator 4.06 or the latest 4.5 beta releases of Communicator.&nbsp;
If you don't have one of these, you may want to skip the rest of this article.&nbsp;
Also, although you are supposed to be able to run this on your local system,
attempting to run the application without being connected to the Net or
by using local URL's seemed to cause unexpected behaviours:&nbsp; drag
and drop no longer worked, widgets did not become visible in the preview
window, etc.&nbsp; I suggest, during your experimentation, that you only
run this early version while connected to the Net, if possible.
<P><B>What does it look like?</B>
<P>Once you've unpacked the package you simply need to open the index.html
file to get started.&nbsp; For example, if you unpacked the zip file in
the /tmp directory you can type the following in the Location field of
the Netscape browser:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>file:/tmp/visual/index.html</FONT></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The "file:" prefix is not actually necessary, but if you're unfamiliar
with accessing files this way you might use it till you get used to where
you're headed with this sort of URL.&nbsp; On the index page you'll find
a link to <FONT COLOR="#006600">Launch Visual DHTML</FONT>.&nbsp; Just
click on this and a small window will open announcing that the application
is starting.&nbsp; For the sake of this article we'll refer to this window
as the VDHTML Main Window.&nbsp; Once the page starts it looks pretty much
like any other application.&nbsp; However, its really just another Web
page!&nbsp; This is the first bit of magic to learning about DHTML.&nbsp;
The pages they create can look like real applications.&nbsp; Note that
the VDHTML page can take a while to load, even from a local hard drive.
<P>Before we get too far I should note that VDHTML is relatively buggy
at this point.&nbsp; If you use it just right it works fine, but straying
from the straight and narrow (ie not using it just right) can cause Netscape
to crash.&nbsp; I'll point out the caveats that I know about as I go.

<BR><B>Figure 1 </B>- The Visual DHTML Main Window</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
The New Page dialog opens when you start the application for the first
time.&nbsp; Its not obvious, but that dialog lives within the VDHTML window.&nbsp;
It cannot be moved outside the borders of that window.&nbsp; Figure 2 shows
what happens when you try to do so.
<BR>&nbsp;

<BR><B>Figure 2</B> - Dialogs don't exist outside of the application window</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
The four options in the New Page dialog allow you to select the size of
a new browser window to open.&nbsp; This new window will be used to preview
your DHTML page and allow you to make edits by dragging and dropping DHTML
components around the preview.&nbsp; Of the four options provided, the
Normal Window will probably be the most useful.&nbsp; Its window is about
3/4 the size of my display, which gives it a resolution of roughly 950x750
pixels.&nbsp; The Normal and Full Screen windows provide the familiar menu
bars you normally see in your Netscape browser windows.&nbsp; The Kiosk
window is smaller than these and does not provide those menus.&nbsp; That
means to close the Kiosk window you have to use the window manager Close
option.&nbsp; Be certain you use "Close" and not "Destroy" (assuming you
use a flavor of FVWM) since Destroy will exit Netscape completely and you'll
have to start over.
<P>The Desktop option opens a window that will stay underneath all your
other windows and acts like an interactive background image, except that
its not "sticky", meaning it doesn't follow you around to other desktops
(again, assuming you have a window manager like FVWM or CDE/mwm that allows
multiple virtual desktops).
<P>Once you've opened your New Window you are ready to start adding DHTML
components to it.&nbsp; VDHTML comes with a set of predefined widgets that
you can add to your page.&nbsp; Clicking on the Widgets icon in the menu
bar of the Main Window will open the Widgets dialog (see Figure 3).&nbsp;
Note that you may need to click and hold the left mouse button over the
Widgets icon longer than you might normally in order to get the dialog
to open.&nbsp; At least I did on my system.&nbsp; Also, when you click
on a widget name in the dialog you need to hold the mouse button down until
after the dialog is closed.&nbsp; Then release the mouse button. If you
don't do it in this order the configurable parameters for the widget will
not be shown and you won't get the widget in the preview window.&nbsp;
Clicking in the Widgets dialog and releasing the mouse button before the
dialog closes will simply close the dialog.
<P><IMG SRC="./gx/hammel/vdhtml-widget-dialog.jpg" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=194 WIDTH=323 ALIGN=LEFT>Ok,
so you've got the Widgets dialog opened.&nbsp; Notice that the dialog is
actually labeled "Components Palette" - a bit of inconsistancy from Netscape,
but thats to be expected with any first release of a product.&nbsp; The
available widgets are listed in a table, below a set of three options which
act something like tabs in a notebook widget.&nbsp; The first tab is the
widgets tab, which provides components like menus and buttons and clocks.&nbsp;
The next tab is for setting specific HTML tags.&nbsp; The last tab is for
setting link properties.
<P><I>Bug:&nbsp; don't try to access the Tags option in the Widgets dialog
without a preview window open.&nbsp; Doing so will crash netscape.&nbsp;
In fact, the widgets dialog in general seems to cause Netscape crashes
at random.</I>
<P>The available widgets include some unusual components, such as the drawer
widget.&nbsp; This option creates what appears to be a small button that,
when pressed, opens a drop down menu.&nbsp; This button can be placed anywhere
in the page but seems to want to be anchored only to window edges.&nbsp;
I'm not sure if thats intentional or a bug in VDHTML.&nbsp; Also, the default
image for the drawer (the small button) can be changed to any image you
want when you configure the widget.&nbsp; Figure 4 shows the configuration
options for the drawer widget.

</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
Any of the components you add can be dragged around the preview window
(except the marqee which must be positioned using its configurable parameters
before its added).&nbsp; When you drag a component to a new location it
causes the preview page to be reloaded.&nbsp; Remember - that page is a
form of HTML, so all the links have to be resolved again.&nbsp; If those
links are across a network (as they are likely to be if you followed my
suggestion of trying this initial version only while connected to the Net)
then page reloads may take a little while.&nbsp; Be patient.
<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 COLS=2 WIDTH="100%" NOSAVE >
<TR NOSAVE>
<TD VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>One exception to dragging is the marquee widget.&nbsp;
This widget creates a window that drops down (or comes in from the sides
or up from the bottom of the browser window) with an image or text, sort
of like an animated menu.&nbsp; But you can't drag marquees in the preview
window.&nbsp; You have to specify the direction from which the marquee
will enter the browser when you create it by using the configurable options.&nbsp;
Apparently the marquee will always be on the left side of the preview window
but as always you can edit the source later to move it to another location
and have it enter the browser appropriately from any point.
<P><I>Bug:&nbsp; While experimenting with the various widgets I discovered
that they often didn't perform as expected in the preview window.&nbsp;
Sometimes I could open a drawer, for example, but not close it.&nbsp; Buttons
would post a menu but then I couldn't clear it.&nbsp; Its clear that the
widgets functionality and their interaction within the preview window are
still to be worked out.</I>
<P>With all widgets the VDHTML Main Window offers configurable parameters.&nbsp;
The defaults for those options which require a URL point to Netscape's
site.&nbsp; This isn't a problem but you should keep it in mind if you
take the default option values.&nbsp; If you decide to use the defaults
(remember:&nbsp; be online if you do so or VHDTML might crash Netscape!)
you can edit the HTML document by hand later and use your own URLs.</TD>

is an extension to X to allow the use of input devices beyond the standard
mouse and keyboard. The extension supports a wide range of devices, including
graphics tablets, touch-screens, joysticks, and dial-boxes. The most common

For many readers of the Muse, X Input is how you'll want to interface with
the <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</A>.&nbsp; Outside of the Gimp there
are only a few other tools that currently make use of the X Input extension.&nbsp;
However, as graphics tools on Linux mature, there will be a much greater
need for these sorts of extra input devices.&nbsp; Later, after we cover
some configuration and testing issues, we'll restrict our application discussion
to the two tools you are most likely to use with X Input:&nbsp; Gimp and
<A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/~otaylor/gsumi/index.html">gsumi</A>.
<P><B><I>What X servers support X Input?</I></B>
<P>X Input is reported to be supported by all 3 of the major X server vendors:
<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org">XFree86</A> (which includes SuSE since
they work so closely in their X server development), <A HREF="http://www.xig.com">Xi
Graphics</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.metrolink.com">MetroLink</A>.&nbsp;
Xi Graphics sent me their latest server, 4.1.2, to try for this article.&nbsp;
I also downloaded the 3.3.2 XF86_SVGA server for use with my Matrox Mystique.&nbsp;
I neglected to contact MetroLink in time to ask for a copy of their server,
unfortunately.&nbsp; An email I received from MetroLink back in March stated
that their 4.3 server includes support for dynamically loadable X Input
driver modules.&nbsp; This includes Elo Graphics, Carroll, Micro Touch
and Lucas/Deeco touch screens.&nbsp; They also mentioned plans for support
of Wacom tablets and 3D input devices such as the Space Orb but I don't
know if this support has been released yet or not.&nbsp; I also don't have
any information on how devices would be configured to work with their X
Input drivers.
<P>In testing the two servers I did have, I was successful in getting only
one of them to work, XFree86's XF86_SVGA server.&nbsp; I have to thank
<A HREF="mailto:otaylor@redhat.com">Owen
Taylor</A> for his helpful hints and suggestions in getting that server
up and running with X Input.&nbsp; Most of the information I'm going to
provide came with clarifications from Owen.
<P>The Xi Graphics server does list X Input as a supported extension, both
in the documentation and from the xdpyinfo program.&nbsp; However, there
is no information available on how to get that extension to recognize and
work with any particular devices.&nbsp; It may be possible to use the gxid
daemon, a daemon program which comes with the Gtk+ source distribution,
to work with this server but I was unsuccessful in doing so.&nbsp; I contacted
Xi Graphics about this and the last I heard they are still looking into
it.&nbsp; I haven't heard if they had any more success than I did.
<P>Since I was only able to get one server to work with X Input, the rest
of this article will focus on that server.&nbsp; If I get feedback from
any one, vendors or users, on getting the other two servers to work with
X Input I'll write up an update here in the Muse.
<P><B><I>What devices are supported?</I></B>
<P>The XFree86 support of X Input includes drivers for the following devices:
<UL>
<LI>
Wacom devices:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<B><FONT COLOR="#006600">ARTZ II</FONT></B>; in Europe this is currently

<UL>
<LI>
Only tablet specifically listed was the <B><FONT COLOR="#006600">DrawingSlate

driver to work with this CalComp tablet.&nbsp; I didn't find any other

</UL>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Joysticks are supported but I didn't try this nor do I have any information
on what joysticks are known to work.</LI>
</UL>
The new Wacom <B><FONT COLOR="#006600">Intuos</FONT></B> line, which is
Wacom's latest line of tablets, is not yet supported.&nbsp; It is unclear,
according to Owen, whether or not drivers will become available for these
devices.
<P><B><I>Requirements for making use of the XFree86 X Input support</I></B>
<P>I have a Matrox Mystique card with 4Mb of memory which I've been using
for about 2 years now.&nbsp; This card is still on the market and will
cost you roughly $100US or less depending on where you purchase it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Along with this I'm using a Wacom PenPartner, a 4"x5" tablet that sells
for about $79US.&nbsp; This is the low end tablet from Wacom.
<P>The Matrox card is supported by the XF86_SVGA server (see the Resources
section at the end of this article).&nbsp; X Input support in XFree86 has
been available in since the 3.3.1 release (at least, perhaps longer).&nbsp;
Most Linux users will probably have either the 3.3.1 or the latest 3.3.2
servers if they use any distribution that is less than 2 years old.

<TD VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>Along with the servers you also need to make use
of one or more loadable modules.&nbsp; If you are like me and use the PenPartner
tablet then you need to make sure you have the 3.3.2 version of the xf86wacom.so
module.&nbsp; The 3.3.1 version of this module does not support the PenPartner
but should work fine for other Wacom tablets.
<P>If you have the 3.3.1 version of XFree86, you can download the particular
server you need and the X3323bin.tgz file, which contains the binary versions
of the 3.3.2 modules (plus other tools).&nbsp; You can find links to these
packages from the XFree86 web site.&nbsp; You might wonder if you can run
your older 3.3.1 libraries with an the newer 3.3.2 servers and modules.&nbsp;
The answer is yes, you can.&nbsp; You don't have to update all your libraries,
development tools, and X applications (the tools under /usr/X11R6/bin)
although you can if you want a full 3.3.2 update.
<P>Along with the server and modules there are a couple of other tools
you'll want to make sure you have:
<UL>
<LI>
Configuration tools:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/utilities/xinput-1.2.tar.gz">xinput</A></LI>

xsetpointer</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Graphics tools:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
gsumi</LI>

<LI>
Gimp</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
The xinput program shouldn't be confused with the generic term X Input.&nbsp;
The program is a little tool written to set various parameters for the
device you are using with the X Input server extension.&nbsp; This includes
things like mapping pen buttons to mouse buttons and so forth.&nbsp; The
xsetpointer program is used to set the pointer to a given device but using
the configuration we will be using in this article you shouldn't need to
do this as both pen and mouse should work as your pointer device at all
times.
<P><B><I>Configuring the X server and hardware</I></B>
<P>In order to make use of the X Input extension you need to tell the X
server about how you want it configured and what driver to load for the
device you will be using.&nbsp; XFree86's configuration file, XF86Config,
is located under the directory /etc/X11.&nbsp; Although you can use the
graphical setup tool XF86Setup for most options, you can't use it to configure
X Input.&nbsp; You'll need to edit the configuration file by hand.
<P>The first thing you need to know about is which modules you'll need.&nbsp;
Under /usr/X11R6/lib/modules you will find the X Input modules.&nbsp; For
Wacom tablets you'll be using the xf86Wacom.so module.&nbsp; Similarly,
SummaGraphics tablet users will want to use the xf86Summa.so modules.&nbsp;
There are also modules for Elo Graphics devices (xf86Elo.so) and joysticks
(xf86Jstk.so).
<P>To configure the module for use with the server, edit the XF86Config
file and add the following lines:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>Section "Module"</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp; Load "xf86Wacom.so"</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>EndSection</FONT></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR>Substitute the module of choice, of course.&nbsp; These lines can
go anywhere, I believe, but I placed them immediately after the Pointer
section.&nbsp; Next you need to add the section which defines the devices
you'll be using.&nbsp; According to Owen Taylor's X Input Howto there is
a simple configuration and a more complete configuration.&nbsp; We'll skip
the simple version since its just a subset of the complete version and
Owen discusses it in his Howto quite well.
<P>The text to add looks like the following:

The 4 SubSections define different devices to X Input.&nbsp; You can see
these listed (after you start the server) by running <TT><FONT SIZE=-1>xsetpointer
-l.</FONT></TT>&nbsp; I'm not completely certain why you have to have two
entries for each device but assume that the first entry is used by applications
and the other entry is used to allow the tablet pen to be used as your
regular pointing device.

The following links are just starting points for finding more information
about computer graphics and multimedia in general for Linux systems. If
you have some application specific information for me, I'll add them to
my other pages or you can contact the maintainer of some other web site.
I'll consider adding other general references here, but application or
site specific information needs to go into one of the following general
references and not listed here.
