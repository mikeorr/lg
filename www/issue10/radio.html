This year's ARRL/TAPR sponsored conference on Digital Communications
was in Seattle on September 20-22.
Being a ham, a packet fan and 18 miles away from the conference, I decided
to attend.
I also offered to bring some <I>Linux Journal</I> magazines to give away.
By the end of the conference &quot;some&quot; had become about 100.
<P> 
The papers presented varied from very introductory material to a
serious look at how to equalize group delay of IF filters.
Many of the papers and one of the three workshops dealt with a system
called Automatic Position Report System.
For those not familiar with this, a GPS receiver is combined with
a packet station to send out position reports.
<P> 
But, the purpose of this article is not to talk about the
&quot;ham content&quot; of the conference (if you want more info on
that, check out <A HREF="http://www.tapr.org/">http://www.tapr.org/</A>,
but to talk about the L-word.
<P> 
In the first workshop (on APRS), Keith Sproul demonstrated both a Windows
and a Mac version of the system, but regularly referenced the fact that a
Linux version also existed.
I was surprised (as there was no mention of a Sun version or any other
Unix-like version), but I was now sure that Linux had infiltrated the ham
packet radio community pretty seriously.
<P> 
The L-word then continued to come up in discussions with people.
It varied from comments about installing Linux to how Linux became a
significant part of a ham network.
For example, in Barry McLarnon and Dennis Rosenauer's presentation on
Wireless Networking Using the WA4DSY 56K RF Modem Technology, Barry said
&quot;Linux is the platform of choice&quot;.
Later, when describing the Ottawa MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) he
pointed out that their Internet server (hydra.carleton.ca) is a Linux box, and
they, when talking about the packet gateway machine, said &quot;It hasn't been
converted to Linux yet.&quot;
<P> 
At the end of their presentation we had a chance to play with a wireless
network set up in the room.
The machine on one end of the 56K link was running Linux as was one
downstream machine off the other end.
<P>
All in all, the conference was good for Linux.
