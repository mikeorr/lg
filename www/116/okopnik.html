<h3>Random Wanderings</h3>
<p> Well, this should be the last article in the "Introduction to Shell
Scripting" series - I've had great feedback from a number of readers (and
thank you all for your kind comments!), but we've covered most of the
<strong>basics</strong>; that was the original purpose of the series. I may
yet pop up at some point in the future ("Oh, rats, I forgot to explain
XYZ!"), but those of you who've been following along should now consider
yourselves Big-Time Experts, qualified to carry a briefcase and sound important...
erm, <em>not</em>. :) At least you should have a pretty good idea of how
to write a script and make it work - and that's a handy skill.


<h3>A Valued Assistant</h3>
<p> Quite a while ago, I found myself in a quandary while writing a script;
I had an array that contained a list of command lines that I needed to
execute based on certain conditions.  I could read the array easily enough,
or print out any of the variables - but what I needed was to execute them!
What to do, what to do... as I remember, I gave up for lack of that one
capability, and rewrote the whole (quite large) script (it was <em>not</em> a
joyful experience). "eval" would have been the solution.

<p> Here's how it works - create a variable called $cmd, like so:

<pre>
Odin:~$ cmd='cat .bashrc|sort'
</pre>

<p> Now, you can echo the thing -

<pre>
Odin:~$ echo $cmd
cat .bashrc|sort'
</pre>

<p> - but how do you execute it? Just running "$cmd" produces an error:

<pre>
Odin:~$ $cmd
cat: .bashrc|sort: No such file or directory
</pre>

<p> This is where "eval" comes into its own: "<code>eval $cmd</code>" would
evaluate the string contained in the variable as if it had been entered at
the command line. This is not something that comes up too often... but it
is a capability of the shell that you need to be aware of.


<h3>Trapped Like a Rat</h3>
<p> One of the standard techniques in scripting (and in programming in general)
is that of writing data to temporary files - there are many reasons to
do this. But, and this is a big one, what happens when your users interrupt
that script half-way through execution? (For those of you who have scripts
like that and haven't thought of the issue, sorry to give you material
for nightmares. At least I'll show you the solution as well.)

<p> You guessed it: a mess. Files in "/tmp", perhaps important data left
hanging in the breeze, files thought to be updated that are not... Yuck.
How about a way for us to exit gracefully, despite a frantic
keyboard-pounding user who just <em>has</em> to run Quake <strong>RIGHT
NOW</strong>?

<p> The "trap" command provides an answer of sorts (shooting said user is
far more effective and enjoyable, but may get you talked about).

<pre class="code"> 
#!/bin/bash

function cleanup ()
{
	# Ignore 'Ctrl-C'; let him pound away...
	trap '' 2
	
	echo "Wake up, Neo."
	sleep 2
	clear
	echo "The Matrix has you."
	
	echo "He's at it again."|mail admin -s "Update stopped by $USER"
	
	# Restore the original data
	tar xvzf /mnt/backup/accts_recvbl -C /usr/local/acct
	
	# Delete 'tmp' stuff
	rm -rf /tmp/in_process/
	
	# OK, we've taken care of the cleanup. Now, it's REVENGE time!!!
	rm /usr/games/[xs]quake
	
	# Give him a nice new password...
	chpasswd $USER:~X%y!Z@zF%HG72F8b@Moron!&amp;(~64sfgrnntQwvff########^
	
	# We'll back up all his stuff... Oh, what does "--remove-files" do?
	tar cvz --remove-files -f /mnt/timbuktu/bye-bye.tgz /home/$USER
	# Heh-heh-heh...
	umount /mnt/timbuktu
	
	trap 2 # Set Ctrl-C back to normal
	exit        
	# Yep, I meant to do that...
}

trap 'cleanup' 2
...
</pre>

<p> There's a little of the BOfH inside every admin. &lt;grin&gt; (For those
of you not familiar with the "BOfH Saga", this is a <strong>must</strong> read for
every Unix admin; appalling and hideously funny. Search the Web.)

<p> DON'T run this script... yes, I know it's tempting. The point of "trap"
is, we can define a behavior whenever the user hits `Ctrl-Break' (or for
that matter, any time the script exits) that is much more useful to us than
just crashing out of the program; it gives us a chance to clean up,
generate warnings, etc.

<p> "trap" can also catch other signals; the fact is that "kill", despite
its name, does not of itself `kill' a process - it sends a signal. The
process then decides what to do with that signal (this is a crude
description, but generally correct). If you wish to see the entire list of
signals, just type "trap -l" or "kill -l" or even "killall -l" (which does
not list the signal numbers, just names). The ones most commonly used are
1) SIGHUP, 2) SIGINT, 3) SIGQUIT, 9) SIGKILL, and 15) SIGTERM (this last
one is the default for 'kill' when no signal name or number is specified.)

<p> There are also the `special' signals. They are: 0) EXIT, which traps on
any exit from the shell, and DEBUG (no number assigned), which can - here's
a nifty thing! - be used to troubleshoot shell scripts (it traps every time
a simple command is executed). DEBUG is actually more of an "info only"
item: you can have this exact action without writing any "trap"s, simply by
adding "-x" to your shebang (see "In Case Of Trouble...", below).

<p> "trap" is a powerful tool. In LG#37, Jim Dennis had a short script
fragment that created a secure directory under "/tmp" for just this sort of
thing - temp files that you don't want exposed to the world. Pretty cool
gadget; I've used it myself a few times since.


<h3>In Case Of Trouble, Break Glass</h3>
<p> Speaking of troubleshooting, Bash provides several very useful tools
that can help you find the errors in your script. These are switches -
part of the "set" command syntax - that are used in the shebang line
of the script itself. These switches are:

<ul>
<li>-n     Read the shell script lines, but do not execute
<li>-v     Print the lines as they're read
<li>-f     Disable wildcard expansion
<li>-x     Prints $PS4 (the "level of indirection" prompt), interprets, executes, and prints the command.
</ul>

<p> I've found that "-nv" and "-x" (and perhaps "-xf") are the most useful
invocations: one gives you the exact location of a "bad" line (you can see
where the script would crash); the other, `noisy' though it is, is handy
for seeing where things aren't happening quite the right way (when, even
though the syntax is right, the action is not what you want). Good
troubleshooting tools both. As time passes and you get used to the quirks
of error reporting, you'll probably use them less and less, but they're
invaluable to a new shell script writer.


<h3>Use The Source, Luke</h3>
<p> Here's a line familiar to every "C" programmer:

<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
</pre>

<p> - a very useful concept, that of <em>sourcing external files</em>. What
that means is that a "C" programmer can write routines (functions) that
are used repeatedly, store them in a `library' (an external file),
and bring them in as they are needed. Well - have I not said that shell
scripting is a mature, capable programming language? - we can do the same
thing!  The file doesn't even have to be executable; the syntax that we use
in sourcing it takes care of that. The example below is a snippet of the
top of my function library, "Funky". Currently, it is a single file, a
couple of kB long, and growing apace.

<p> There's a tricky little bit of Bash maneuvering that's worth knowing:
if you create a variable called BASH_ENV in your .bash_profile, like so:

<pre>
export BASH_ENV="~/.bash_env"
</pre>

<p> then create a file called ".bash_env" in your home directory, that file
will be re-read every time you start a `non-login non-interactive shell' -
i.e., a shell script. That's where I source "Funky" from - that way, any
changes in it are immediately available to any shell script. It can also be
sourced right from the command line.

<pre class="code">
calc () # Integer-only command-line calculator
{
    printf "$(($*))\n"
}

getch () # silently gets a char from keyboard, returns $GETCH
{
    OLD=`stty -g`
    stty raw -echo
    dd if=/dev/tty bs=1 count=1 2&gt;/dev/null
    stty $OLD
}

colsel () # Color selector - iterates through all the $TERM's color choices
{
trap 'echo -en "\E[$40;1m"; clear' 0	# Reset on exit
n=49	# Max foreground color value
while [ "$n" -ne 0 ]
do
	m=39	# Max background color value
	while [ "$m" -ne 0 ]
	do
		echo -en "\E[$m;${n}m"
        	clear
		echo "This is a test."
		echo -en "\E[$40;1m"
        	echo -n " $n $m "
        	read
		(( m-- ))
	done
	(( n-- ))
done
}
</pre>
<p> Not too different from a script, is it? No shebang is necessary,
since this file does not get executed by itself.  So, how do we use
it in a script? Here it is (we'll pretend that I don't source "Funky" in
".bash_env"):

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
. Funky
declare -i Total=0
leave ()
{
    echo "So youse are done shoppin'?"
    [ $total -ne 0 ] &amp;&amp; echo "Dat'll be $total bucks, pal."
    echo "Have a nice day."
    exit
}

# Exec the 'leave' function on exit
trap 'leave' 0

clear

# Infinite loop!
while :
do
    echo
    echo "Whaddaya want? I got Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Onions,"
    echo "and Radishes today."
    echo
    
    # Here's where we call a sourced function...
    input=`getch`
    # ...and reference a variable created by that function.
    case $input
    in
	C|c) Total=$Total+1; echo "Them are good cukes." ;;
	T|t) Total=$Total+2; echo "Ripe tomatoes, huh?" ;;
	L|l) Total=$Total+2; echo "I picked da lettuce myself." ;;
	O|o) Total=$Total+1; echo "Fresh enough to make youse cry!" ;;
	R|r) Total=$Total+2; echo "Real crispy radishes." ;;
	*) echo "Ain't got nuttin' like that today, mebbe tomorra." ;;
    esac
    sleep 2

 done
</pre>

<p> Note the period before "Funky": that's an alias for the "source" command.
When sourced, "Funky" acquires an interesting property: just as if we had
asked "bash" to execute a file, it goes out and searches the path listed
in $PATH. Since I keep "Funky" in "/usr/local/bin" (part of my $PATH),
I don't need to give an explicit path to it.

<p> If you're going to be writing shell scripts, I strongly suggest that
you start your own `library' of functions. (HINT: Steal the functions from
the above example!) Rather than typing them over and over again, a single
"source" argument will get you lots and lots of `canned' goodies.


<h3>Wrapping Up The Series</h3>

<p> Well - overall, lots of topics covered, some "quirks" explained; all
good stuff, useful shell scripting info. There's a lot more to it - remember,
this series was only an <em>introduction</em> to shell scripting - but anyone
who's stuck with me from the beginning and persevered in following my brand
of pretzel-bending logic (poor people! irretrievably damaged, not even
the best psychologist in the world can help you now... :) should now be
able to design, write, and troubleshoot a fairly decent shell script. The
rest of it - understanding and writing the more complex, more involved
scripts - can only come with practice, otherwise known as "making lots
of mistakes". In that spirit, I wish you all lots of "mistakes"!

<p> Happy Linuxing!
