Answer Gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I run a smallish mail server and am using Squirelmail for web-based email. I
use spamassassin/procmail to move emails that are borderline spam to
/home/username/Trash.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My users have been instructed to occasionaly log into squirelmail and look
through their Trash folder and empty it occassionaly even if they're popping
in with the dreaded Outlook Express. They of course don't, and it's becoming a
problem. I need to run a command that will find all the files called Trash in
the user's home directories and empty them. I can't simply delete this file as
it causes Squiremail to generate an error and I would get many many phone
calls even though squirelmail will fix this problem on their next login.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This is my third attempt at automating this procedure and my third failure.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I can do this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>find /home -name Trash -exec ls -al {} \;
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
and this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>find /home -name Trash -exec rm {} \;
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
but not this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>find /home -name Trash -exec cat /dev/null &gt; {} \;
</strong></pre>

<blockQuote>
It's the redirection that's the problem. If you quote the '&gt;' thus:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find /hometest -name Trash -exec cat /dev/null '&gt;' {} \;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
it will work, with the caveat that you may still hit some "trash" files in
subdirectories.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Check where you ran the command.  You will find an empty file called "{}",
created by your redirection. The command you ran was equivalent to
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find /hometest -name Trash -exec cat /dev/null \; &gt; {}
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
That will empty anything called Trash in subdirectories as well as in the
login directories. To only hit files in the login directories you should use
a for loop, e.g.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>for file in /home/*/Trash
do
  echo -n &gt; $file
done
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Before trying this put another echo in front of echo echo -n &gt; $file, so you
can see the commands it will run and sanity check them before running it for
real.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
What errors are you getting? Do you have permissions to write to these files?
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
or this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>find /home -name Trash | xargs cat &gt;  /dev/null
</strong></pre>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Neil] 
That wouldn't work. You're just listing the files and directing the output
to <TT>/dev/null</TT>, which won't achieve what you want.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
While root, when I do this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>find /hometest -name -Trash -exec cat /dev/null &gt; {} \;
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
it runs and exists after a second giving me a new prompt (a carriage return)
and no errror messages.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
When I run this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>find /hometest -name Trash -exec ls -s {} \;
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
I get this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>  60 /hometest/accounting.test/Trash
 264 /hometest/adam.test/Trash
3120 /hometest/agency.test/Trash
 164 /hometest/joh.doe/Trash
4976 /hometest/alice.test/Trash
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
so obviously it didn't work but I didn't get any errors.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Your "for" script worked great and is short and sweet. I'm very greatful,
however, for my own information, I'd still like to understand what's wrong
with my find syntax/structure. If you guys post this solution on the website
you should put in the keywords "empty files". I've googled for all kinds of
crazy things and never found a solution.

Look carefully at your command.
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find /hometest -name -Trash -exec cat /dev/null &gt; {} \;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This runs "find <TT>/hometest</TT> -name -Trash -exec cat <TT>/dev/null</TT>" and
redirects the output to a file named "{}".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Quoting the '&gt;' doesn't help since find doesn't use the shell to expand
commands given with -exec. (That is, if you quoted the "&gt;", cat would be
run with three arguments. The first would be a file named "<TT>/dev/null</TT>".
The second would a file named "&gt;", which cat would probably complain
doesn't exist. It is possible you might actually have a file named "&gt;",
but it's such a weird and confusing name that you probably don't. And
the third would be the name of the file you're trying to truncate.)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If, for some reason, you needed to use "find" (perhaps to only truncate
files with a certain mtime, or whatever), you could use a script like
this:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>#! /bin/sh

for file in "$@"; do
    [ -f "$file" ] &amp;&amp; echo -n &gt; "$file"
done
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
name it truncate.sh or something, make it executable, and save it
somewhere. Then you could do:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find /path/to/files -exec truncate.sh {} \;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
...or use xargs, or whatever.
</blockQuote>

There's nothing wrong in your implimentation, but it is worthy of note
that the test is simply going to add another "thing" for the script to
do. If the number of files are vast, this is just going to slow it down.
You could remove [1.] entirely and let find match the files beforehand:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find . -type f -exec ./truncate {} \;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Jason] 
Oh! I didn't think of that. That is better than silently dropping
non-existent and non-regular files.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] 
I could hash this argument out in any <EM>number</EM> of combinations involving
xargs, -exec, etc, with arguments as to whether you should use a shell
script, etc., etc.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Jason] 
Yes, and you probably would be wanting to use xargs if the number of
files is vast.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] 
Maybe. But that will still fail where a filename has spaces in it.
Example:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[n6tadam@station fi]$ ls -lFb
total 8
-rw-r--r--  1 n6tadam n6tadam    0 Jan 11 11:18 foo
drwxr-xr-x  2 n6tadam n6tadam 4096 Jan 11 11:11 ignore/
-rw-r--r--  1 n6tadam n6tadam  120 Jan 11 11:08 this\ has\ spaces
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Ignoring the "ignore/" directory, I've got a file with spaces in the
filename [1], as well as a 'normal' file. If I wanted to truncate the
files in the CWD above, I might use:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find . -type f -maxdepth 1 -exec sh -c 'cat /dev/null &gt; {}' \;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... which is fine, for the file with no spaces. Of course, the
truncate.sh script you wrote is fine for handling that (you actually
quoted the variable -- thousands do not). But just what is wrong with
that command above? Well, for each file that find finds, it has to spawn
a separate non-interactive shell to process it. That's slow.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
xargs might improve things (I'll leave this as an exercise to the reader
to use 'time'):
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find . -type f -maxdepth 1 -print0 | xargs -0i sh -c "cat /dev/null &gt; \"{}\""
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Note the quoting. It's paramount that this is done, because even though
the '-print0' option to find splits file names ending '\0' (and xargs
re-interprets them again at the other end), we're <EM>still</EM> having to
quote the filename (this will <em>  still  </em> fail if the filename contains a
'"' character, though). Why? Because by the time it gets passed through to
the shell to handle it, we're back to the our old tricks of: '"\"use\" more
quo\"t\"es'.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So is using find(1) any better than using a plain shell script that
globs a given directory for files to truncate? No. Because find blindly
 <TT>exec()</TT>'s whatever we pass to it (and we're having to use shell
redirection) we must invoke the shell for it to work. The only advantage
to using find is that it would handle some strange files, nothing more
(in <EM>this</EM> particular application of it, anyway).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I suppose you could make that find command more efficient:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find . -type f -maxdepth 1 -not -empty -print0 | xargs -0i sh -c "cat /dev/null &gt; \"{}\""
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
... which just ensures that the files we pass to it have a filesize
greater than zero. The "best" solution that I personally can see,
is using the following:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>find . -type f -maxdepth 1 -not -empty -print0 | xargs -0i cp /dev/null {}
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This obliterates the need to fork a subshell to perform any redirection
-- and as with any "find .. | xargs" combination, it'll be quite fast,
too. But the main reason for using it is that by avoiding any
shell-redirection-mangle-filename techniques, we don't have to worry
about quoting. The delimiter of '\0' via find and xargs should be enough
to protect it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Also note that cat'ting <TT>/dev/null</TT> is nonsensical in this instance.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[1] Remember that there is nothing "illegal" about using such
characters. Any character is a valid one for filenames at the filesystem
level. What defines them as being a pain is the shell. Nothing more.

Not quite; '<TT>/</TT>' can't be used as a filename. Although "\n" can, which
(along with any high-bit characters) can create lots of pain for anyone
trying to work with them...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Jason] 
But ASCII NUL <EM>is</EM> an illegal character, right? So this will <EM>always</EM> work?

Right; you can't use a NUL or a '<TT>/</TT>'. Other than those two, anything is
fair game... well, not really.
