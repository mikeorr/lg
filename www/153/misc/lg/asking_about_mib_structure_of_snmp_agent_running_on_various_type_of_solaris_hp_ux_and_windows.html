Hello gang!
</p>

<p>
As the subject says, I have hard times understanding the result of
snmpwalk against those platforms. Not that I can't query those nodes,
but snmpwalk is unable to translate the numeric form of OID into human
readable string label.
</p>

<p>
More precisely, I need to find the MIB files that describe the
returned SNMP data. So far, my best bet is by referring to
oidview.com, but the MIB files I have downloaded from this site don't
always work as expected i.e some OIDs are still in numeric form, thus
I don't whether it refers to disk usage, cpu utilization and so on.
</p>

<p>
I will highly appreciate any inputs regarding this issue.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi.

The MIBs are just plain text files. Have you looked at the ones you have
to ensure that they actually describe/cover the OID you're interested
in? The structure is certainly supposed to be OS- and whatever else
independent; that's the whole point of SNMP.

<p>
The trick is usually getting the appropriate MIB in the first place.
</p>

<p>
If the objects you're looking for begin with the OID prefix
.1.3.6.1.4.1, they're under the vendor's enterprise tree and you'll have
to get the MIB file from the vendor.
</p>

<p>
Vendor support for that is spotty at best - you may have to be
persistent. (Good luck!)

Hmm...and as far as I can tell, local vendor in Indonesia can't help
me much for this issue. Either they are confused which MIB related to
a platform, or the worst....they don't know what I am talking about <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":(">
</p>

<p>
But I am curious for one thing, if an snmp agent is running on certain
machine, can I safely assume that MIB file exists in that machine too?
Is there any common place to find for that MIB, let's say something
like /var/snmp/mib?

<p>
I would suggest 2 things
</p>

<p>
1. find /usr /var /opt -xdev -iname \*.mib
</p>

<p>
you may need to vary that to make sure it covers all partitions that might 
contain the mib
</p>

<p>
2. Google for solaris snmpd mib
</p>

<p>
Obviously replace Solaris with any other OS of interest. Google suggests 
<a href="http://docs.sun.com/source/816-2014/man8/snmpd.8.html">http://docs.sun.com/source/816-2014/man8/snmpd.8.html</a> and that says 
</p>

<pre>
FILES
 
The following files are provided for agent operation:
 
snmpd
    agent binary snmpd.conf configuration information (described below) 
 
sun-snmp.schema
    SNM schema generated by mib2schema utility from MIB 
 
sun.mib
    Sun-specific MIB in ASN.1 format

<p>
Mulyadi's mentioned <a href="http://www.oidview.com/">http://www.oidview.com/</a> ; there's also
<a href="http://www.mibdepot.com/">http://www.mibdepot.com/</a> (more than 1.25M object definitions available.)
Or you could just write your own and fill it in with the data you have -
or modify an existing similar one.

<p>
Again, I think you're hunting for something that doesn't exist - which
may be why they don't know what you're talking about. MIBs, as far as I
know, have nothing to do with any platform - they're just device
descriptions. 
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; But I am curious for one thing, if an snmp agent is running on certain
&gt; machine, can I safely assume that MIB file exists in that machine too?
</pre>

<p>
Nope. They <em>should</em> be, but there's nothing to guarantee it.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Is there any common place to find for that MIB, let's say something
&gt; like /var/snmp/mib?
</pre>

<p>
On my system, /usr/share/snmp/mibs contains a bunch of MIBs. However, I
don't think that this is necessarily where the new ones would always get
installed.

Neither case is at all uncommon. You typically need to reach a specialized
support person, or better yet, an engineer, to find somebody who understands
SNMP.

<p>
The MIB file is just a description of how the software agent on the
device works.  There isn't any actual MIB in the device itself. You
certainly can't assume that the vendor has thought to install a MIB
along with an agent.
</p>

<p>
What device are we talking about? And what is the numeric OID you're
interested in?

Hi!

<p>
First  of all, thanks to all of you who had answered....

I'll see what I can do about it. I suppose I can bug somebody from HP
Indonesia (again).

I slowly realize this fact...which brings me into further deeper headache......
</p>


<pre>
&gt; What device are we talking about? And what is the numeric OID you're interested
&gt; in?
</pre>

<p>
Servers....they are running Solaris ( ver 5 up to 10), HP-UX (version
11), Windows NT/2000/XP/2003, Linux.. list could grows in the future.
</p>

<p>
For the OID, I am focusing on 4 aspects: disk, CPU, memory and
traffic. So for example, I need CPU utilization (% of time spent in
user, kernel time) and processor queue length.
</p>

<p>
To the best I know, looks like querying the traffic information is the
easiest...because it is the same for all platform. But when it comes
to processor or disk or memory....OID can be different....
</p>

<p>
Any further hints are greatly appreciated.
