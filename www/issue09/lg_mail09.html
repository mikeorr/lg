<P> 
Hi John,
<P> 
Thanks for taking the time for putting together the Gazette.  I hope
you have some time left over for doing work for your employer !!!
I trust/hope that Phil Hughes will be able to keep the Gazette going ...
I've certainly enjoyed the Gazette over the last year.  One comment
though.  In the most recent issue (#8) the format has changed so that
the Gazette is no longer (easily) printable, but is split among many
pages.  I know this is supposed to be an e-zine, but I liked the old
format better :-(.  I'd hazard to guess that I'm not alone in this, but
probably in the minority.....  Any chance of putting an organized single
postscript file on the ftp site? That way those of us loosers who like
to read from paper at our leisure (and don't have laptops, sigh..) can
still easily print out a copy of the Gazette.  This may understandably
not fly with Phil, but I thought I'd suggest it and see what happens
anyway!
<P> 
Thanks again for all your work!
<P>

<I>(Yes, you are in the minority, and I must say it is much easier for me if
the Gazette is in a multi-part format. As a result, it's very likely to
stay in multi-part format. However, you should note that it can be
downloaded as one file from the SSC ftp site -- <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ssc.com/lg/">
ftp.ssc.com/lg/</A>. So you
could download it, convert it to postscript, print it and read at your
leisure. We're not going to do all the work for you -- that would take all
the fun out of it. :-) --Editor)</I>

<P> 
This month I've found some really nice utilities and programs in the
incoming directories of the Linux archive sites.  If any of you LG readers
find (or have written) a program you're excited about, and don't have the time
or inclination to write a piece for the Gazette, drop me a line telling me
what you like about it and its location.  I'll include a piece on it in next
month's issue.

<b>Subject: Microline Software Free LINUX GUI Version<br></b>
<P> 
I don't know if you are aware, but we have a free LINUX advanced GUI
toolkit (based on the Microline Widget Library for Motif) on our ftp
site www.mlsoft.com.  The MWL was used to build Netscape Navigator for
UNIX and is used for mission critial applications by AT&amp;T, 3Com, Merrill
Lynch, Canon, Netscape, Sun, SGI, etc.
<P> 
Please download our free LINUX version.  We would like to be reviewed or
mentioned in the Linux Journal to get the word out.  Since we are giving
it away for free, we can not pay for an ad, etc.  We welcome your
feedback and hope that the LINUX community enjoys the free download.

<b>Subject: MindQ Publishing Inc.'s Intro to Programming Java Applets</b><br>
<P> 
Dear Editor:
<P> 
"I'm a programmer and I want to spend a few hours getting acquainted with
Java applet programming. Is there a faster way to learn than books?"
"I'm not a programmer, but I want to learn about Java without wading through
Dweeb books. Is there a way?"
"My programmers are learning Java and I want to keep up without being
overwhelmed. How do I do that?"
<P> 
These are comments we overheard at the Web Interactive Show in New York this
month. The point? It's not just hard-core techies who want to learn about
Java--or have time to read the books. So where do the rest of us go?
<P> 
MindQ Publishing Inc.'s "Intro. to Programming Java Applets" is a multimedia
CD-ROM tutorial designed to teach all of the above--using animation, audio,
video and hypertext. Experienced programmers can use the hyperlinked table of
contents to find exactly what they need. Newbies can jump on any one of five
tours. People inbetween can use a combo. All of them can use the Java
Developers Kit, or the Launch button to go right to other Java-related
programs or websites (when the Launch capability is activated). The program
retails for $49.95, but I can provide you with an eval copy. Please email me:
MikKass@aol.com, or call me (203)323-4166. Thanks. I look forward to hearing
from you.
<P> 
Cordially,<br>

<P> 
I might be the sort of person you are looking for.  I've been hacking
on the kernel since around version 0.8.  I'm a new professor looking
to get my name published.  I'm teaching a class in System
Administration using Linux, and I've written before.  Does this sound
like the qualifications for writers for the Linux Journal?  How do I
get an article in the Linux Journal?
<P>

<P> 
Hey.
<P> 
I would like to write some small articles for the Gazette. Like some novice
articles that were in the early articles in LJ. Or maybe it is interesting
to review some new products or small articles on how to set up different
network features.
<P> 
Yours sincerely, Olof S (and of course I will spellcheck my articles)

Hello Marjorie
<P> 
First, excuse me, my english is not very fluent.
<P> 
I have several articles, covering general topics, of the intallation and
configuration of Linux, test of soft, etc... but all in spanish.
<P> 
My idea is to make a new section on Linux Gazette in others languages
than english.
<P> 
This will put LG in a new dimension and, why not, LJ :-)
<P> 
What do you think about ?
<P> 
Bye<br>
Manu
