SGI Visual Workstation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<P><STRONG>
Hi Answer Guys!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I must install LINUX on an SGI 540 Visual Workstation running
WinNT4.0.  I'm using RedHat 6.2 and want to make a dual boot
system with LINUX on the 2nd SCSI drive.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My problem is that I can't boot off the RedHat install floppy or the
CD.  I can't get past SGI's system initialization/setup to boot off
either device.  I have installed this software on several INTEL Pentium
platforms without any trouble.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Please help me get started and/or provide some useful websites
that will help.  I find SGI/MIPS stuff, but can't seem to find anything
else.  I checked your answers too so if I missed it, my apologies.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks,
<br>Beth H.

Well, Beth, You've discovered a fundamental truth about the
SGI vis. WS.  It's not a PC.  It uses an x86 CPU but from what
the SGI folks told me when I was teaching advanced Linux courseware
to some of their tech support and customer service people, the
resemblance pretty much ends at the CPU pins.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So you can't boot one with a typical Linux distribution CD or
floppy.  I guess we have to find a custom made kernel and prepare
a custom boot floppy or CD therefrom.  Did you call SGI's
technical support staff?  They probably have a floppy image
tucked away on their web site somewhere; and SGI is certainly
not hostile to Linux.  Give them a call; if that doesn't work
I'll try to dig up the e-mail addresses of some of the employees
that took my class and see if I can get a personal answer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After writing this I got to a point where my Ricochet wireless
link could "see bits."  (I do all of my e-mail from my laptop
these days, and much of it as during business meetings or at
coffee shops and restaurants; so it's a little harder to do
searches --- I write most of my TAG articles from memory and
locally cached <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">LDP</A> docs 
--- an 18Gb disk is good for that).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So I did a Google!/Linux (<A HREF="http://www.google.com/linux"
	>http://www.google.com/linux</A>) search
on the string: 'SGI "visual workstation" boot images' and
found:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Luckily the main differences are in the kernel and (possibly)
in the boot loader and a few hardware utilities.  I wouldn't
expect programs like hwclock, lspci, isapnp etc work ---
though some of them might.  I've seen lspci used on PowerPC
(PReP) systems, and I've used it on SPARC Linux.  I seem to
remember that hwclock was modified to use a <TT>/proc</TT> interface
and that most of its core functionality is now in the kernel.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The other software element that is very hardware dependent
is the video driver.  As more accelerated framebuffer drivers
are being added to the kernel then this becomes less of an
issue (it folds back into the earlier statement: "MOST of the
differences are IN THE KERNEL").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, once you get the boot disk/CD and an X server working most
other software and all of your applications should work just fine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course updates to RH6.2 or later, and to newer kernels
might be a bit of a challenge. However, I'll leave those as
exercises to the readership.  The source is all out there!
