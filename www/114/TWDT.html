<P>
Hello,
</P>
<P>
I'm hoping this will drum up some replies.  I'm tumbling head-first into
the world of python and ncurses for this, and know very little about both.
</P>
<P>
To cut a long (and rather boring) story short, I run
<a href="http://www.irssi.org/">irssi</a>
in a screen
session on my poor P166 server.  X11-forwarding is not an option as I
don't have nor want X11 installed, and it's damn slow even if I did.
But one useful feature is using one of the many scripts off of irssi's
website, I can get irssi to scrape urls into a text file.  "Wooooo, I
hear you say".
</P>
<P>
Well, it is nice.  And thanks to network transparency, I am able to tail
that logfile via shfs (ssh filesystem, essentially).  So then I got to
thinking.  What's an easy way of displaying the URLs in the file?  I
remembered a program that ships (often) with mutt -- "urlview".  It
scans a file for a regexp for URLs and presents a means of selecting
them and launching them.  Brilliant.  Except... it expects a file --
piping to stdin blocks.
</P>
<P>
Bah!  I don't want to hack the source-code, unblocked I/O in C is a
headache.  So I stumbled across pyurlview [1]  a replacement written in
Python.  It's "ok" and is in a language I can read.
</P>
<P>
What I'm wanting to do is emulate this:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>tail -f ./some_file | pyurlview
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Now that doesn't work as-is.  So I thought about it a bit, and came up
with this little bit of python code (which I hope is the correct "way"
to do it):
</P>

<blockquote><pre>#! /usr/bin/env python
import os,sys

while 1:
  #sys.stdin.fileno()
  s = sys.stdin.readline()
  print "Got", s
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
Which seems to work when one does:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>tail -f ./foo | testfile.py
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
So I thought I'd try and incorporate that idea into the pyurlview script
[1] I tried all I might, to no avail.  The closest I got was here [2]
but that's mangling everything and isn't functioning like in the example
I correctly showed above.
</P>
<P>
So if someone can see the error in logic, do say.  Or does anyone know
of an existing program that will do what I want?  I can use any form of
scripting language to do it (awk, ruby, etc) already -- but it's more
the curses and non-blocking I/O I'm interested about.  Plus, I'd rather
not reinvent the wheel, hence battling it out with python.  <EM>maybe</EM> I
could use 'multitail' but it's UI sucks for what I am wanting.
</P>
<P>
Thanks In Advance,
</P>

Hi Guru's.
</P>
<P>
I'm a novice as far as Linux goes and want to attend a course but don't
know which flavour to go for or who supplies the best training. From
what I have seen my choice should be between RedHat and <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>..
</P>
<P>
Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
Thanks in advance,

When it comes to shell scripting I am a rank novice, but it seemed to me that the passage
"if $1 has a length of zero, then the following statements (echo... echo... exit) should be executed" (quotes not mine)
should read
"if $1 <EM>does not have</EM> a length of zero, then the following statements (echo... echo... exit) should be executed"
</STRONG></P>
<P>
In fact, the article is correct - the
</P>
<P><CODE>
[ -z "$1" ] &amp;&amp; { ... }
</CODE></P>
<P>
construct will execute the statement block if $1 is zero length; the
"-z" operator returns "true" in that case. You can try it on the command
line:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~$ foo=abcdefg     # Give some value to 'foo'
ben@Fenrir:~$ [ -z "$foo" ] &amp;&amp; echo "Foo is empty"
ben@Fenrir:~$ foo=     # Unset 'foo'
ben@Fenrir:~$ [ -z "$foo" ] &amp;&amp; echo "Foo is empty"
Foo is empty
</pre></blockquote>

<P>
Hi Gang,
</P>
<P>
Just a quick note about the difference between "Voice recognition" and
"Speech recognition".
</P>
<P>
Voice recognition means recognizing "The person who is speaking". This
is a means of identifying people/persons by listening to their voice.
We all do this whenever we use the phone and know who is on the other
end as soon as they start talking.
</P>
<P>
Speech recognition means recognizing the words being spoken.
</P>
<P>
Voice recognition tools are used to identify people as part of access
security systems.
</P>
<P>
Speech recognition tools (Dragon Naturally Speaking, ViaVoice) are used
to "speak" into a computer microphone and have that computer understand
what words you said.  Currently Naturally Speaking seems to hold the
edge in recognition accuracy. This can vary from person to person.
</P>
<P>
Janine's articles,  [issue 113]  Voice recognition shorthand and the
birth of Weblish and  [issue 87]  Linux-Based Voice Recognition
are actually about Speech recognition, not voice recognition.
</P>
<P>
--
Jeff Kinz, Emergent Research, Hudson, MA.
(A former Speech Recognition software developer)
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">Thanks for clarifying the distinction, Jeff; we'll pass this on to our
readers. I suspect that the common usage isn't likely to change much as
a result - but, to misquote Larry Wall, I do occasionally struggle
feebly against ignorance, and I admire other people's efforts in that
direction as well.

<LI>Not all of the past LG issues have a TWDT.html (which is what's used to generate the PDB doc.)


<LI>Issues before #100 are actually called "issueXX", where 'XX' is a two-digit issue number (i.e., leading zeros for low numbers.)

To make it simpler, you can use any sort of a bogus string for NAME, and
you'll get a list of all issues with links that will return a PDB for
that issue. I hope that helps.

<!-- begin hgreeting -->
<p>Greetings, and welcome to summertime in the world of 
<en>Linux Gazette</em>.  As promised last month we've a few juicy bits for you; we hope you like them.</p>

<h4 align=center>Got Questions?</h4>
<p>We're seeing a drop in the number of good questions though.  Or even bad ones. Jim (the Answer Guy himself) attributes this to all the good questions having already seen answers in past columns.  This can't be completely the case - and on rare occasions the answers do change and why they had to is a juciy discussion.  But there's certainly some grain of truth to it.</p>

<p>We like it when more people <a href="../tag/ask-the-gang.html">ask the answer gang</a> their linuxy questions.  </p>

<p>Ah, but that's not the topic I've planned to yak about for this month.  Maybe in a later column, when The Answer Guy brings back his <em>Retrospectives</em>, I'll do a nice breakdown on how people find helpful friends these days.  But I've been having a lot of fun (and even some clients) doing web glitz, so I'm probably going to talk about that next month.  Send in your own tidbits of good web techniques, we'll make a pool of them.</p>

<h4 align="center">Good Companions</h4>

<p>I had spring cleaning last month, which means that this month there is room on my desk - and in my office - for some nifty things.  Right now my lab's about to bloom with new power and color, as I bring machines from my internet lounge into gear.  I haven't decided if I'll run them with full distros this time, a liveCD again as I usually do (<a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> being the front runner), or as terminals served off one higher quality machine, in the same spirit that the <a href="http://www.k12ltsp.org/">K-12 LTSP</a> people do.  One way or another it's bound to be a fun time at <a href="http://www.baycon.org/">Baycon</a> again this year, as my <a href="http://trek.starshine.org/">starship</a> gets a Piece O' Da Action.  I should invite our Editor In Dark Glasses along, and see if the ladies who fly the black helicopters are inclined to TAG along...</p>

<p>My teddybear now has a permanent place of honor on my FVWM desktop.  If you've been paying attention you've got a copy of him in your /usr/share/xteddy directory too, from our <a href="../issue111/lg_cover.html">February cover art</a> and perhaps he brightens your day.  Thomas gave me a rather sweet birthday present that I hadn't gotten around to showing you folks - note, this is very specific to FVWM, and you have to name your bear correctly, too.</p>

<p>First, you symlink xteddy to the name <b>bear</b> so the window title will be seperate.</p>

<p>Second, add this fragment to your <tt>.fvwm2rc</tt>.  It's kind of important to advise FVWM that he accepts WM hints:</p>

<blockquote><em>See attached <a href="misc/tag/bouncing-bear.fvwm.txt">misc/tag/bouncing-bear.fvwm.txt</a></em></blockquote>

<p>Third, I added a little bit to my fvwm's <b>StartFunction</b> which makes sure that bear's on my desktop.  You'll probably have the geometry a little different - have fun with it...</p>

<pre>
AddToFunc StartFunction
+ I Test (init) Exec exec /usr/bin/fvwm-root /home/heather/.fvwm/stars16a.xpm
+ I Test (init) Exec exec bear -wm -geometry +1320+820
</pre>

<p>Now anytime I press Shift-Alt-B he bounces.  The only mystery I haven't solved - feel free to send in if you're a fvwm fan who knows the answer - is that if I have clicked him, say to drag him out of the way momentarily - then he won't bounce anymore, until I've minimized him.  then his minimized form bounces fine, and so does his restored form.  Pretty silly seeing the word with no picture bounce like that.  It makes me giggle.</p>

<p>I hope you're enjoying a happy Summer.  As for me, it's too bright out there, time to go hide in my starfields for awhile.  Stargazing fans, the skies are clear, and there's plenty of software to tell us what to look for.  In the realm of spaceward travels, things are... if you'll pardon the expression... looking up.  Bye now!</p>

	>How do I get a non-US keyboard mapping in Xnest?</H3>


<p><strong>From Matthias Arndt

<p></strong></p>

Dear Answer gang,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
it has been more than 4 years that I am reading (and sometimes
publishing in) the Linux Gazette with real pleasure. I always did find
most answers to my questions here but this time I'm really stuck.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
From time to time I use the Xnest command to connect to remote boxes
with graphical login.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
This works much as expected except for one thing: I'm used to a german
keyboard layout and my local X server is configured to use it. But Xnest
does not use it - I always get US keyboard layout inside Xnest.
For example I tried:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$ Xnest :1 -broadcast -xkbmap de -geometry 980x680
Cannot open "keymap/de" for reading
(EE) Error opening keymap file de, reverting to defaults
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
for example but I got above error and still only got a US keyboard
inside. The rest was working as expected.
Another try was something like this:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>$ Xnest :1 -broadcast -xkbmap /etc/X11/xkb/keymap/xfree86 -geometry 980x680

Cannot open "keymap/etc/X11/xkb/keymap/xfree86" for reading
The XKEYBOARD keymap compiler (xkbcomp) reports:
 &gt; Error:            Cannot open
"/var/tmp/etc/X11/xkb/keymap/xfree86.xkm" to write keyboard description
 &gt;                   Exiting
(EE) Couldn't load XKB keymap, falling back to pre-XKB keymap
(EE) Error opening keymap file /etc/X11/xkb/keymap/xfree86, reverting to
defaults
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
The main question is: how do I need to call/configure Xnest that it will
use my german keyboard setup <em>  inside  </em> the Xnest window so that I can use
remote applications with my german keyboard?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I'm using <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> Linux 9.1 with XFree86 Version 4.3.99.902 (4.4.0 RC 2)
and the according version of Xnest.

The problem you have, Matthias, is that Xnest does not support the
-xkbmap inherently.  Yes, although Xnest will emulate a server, at
present Xnest is only capable of using its own default keyboard
extension map.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You have to remember that Xnest is a complex program.  To the Xserver
and indeed any other Xclient, it looks and behaves as such (it looks
like an Xserver to the underlying real Xserver, and as an Xclient to the
windows mapped to it) [1]. The reason why the -xkbmap is ignored is
because when Xnest loads, it changes the keyboard layout procedures of
the real server to its own defaults [2].  Currently there is no pure
workaround, other than you <EM>might</EM> be able to use Xmodmap from within
Xnest to change it (or possibly Xkeycaps).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I realise I've been vague about some points, but this is a really
complex issue that I might (if the interest is high enough) turn into an
article or TAG entry.
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>This has several inherent problems, that I'll skip.


<LI>To many people, this is complex to work around -- but think about.  Xnest is both an Xclient and an Xserver (in this sense).  The kdb extensions are inherently supplied and then dropped by the real Xserver.  It's a transparent process only.

	>Question about file mtime on linux</H3>


<p><strong>From Suramya Tomar

<p align="right"><strong>Answered By:  Benjamin Okopnik, Pete Jewell, John Karnes, Mike Orr, Jay R. Ashworth, Kapil

<P><STRONG>
Hi Everyone,
I have a question for you about file mtime(modify
time) on linux. Does the mtime stamp of a file change
as soon as a process starts modifying the file or does
it change it after the change is done?
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben] 
After the change is done, of course; up until that time, the file has
only been <em>  read,  </em> not written to. What is modified (in e.g., an editor)
is a <EM>copy</EM> of the file, generally held in memory - which is why the
"save" function exists.  Otherwise, a crash in the middle of editing
would destroy your original file.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
The reason I am interested in this is that I am
writing a perl script which is supposed to monitor a
file for changes and as soon as the change is done run
another script which processes the changed file. I
don't want the second script to run before the file change is
complete(Which would happen if the mtime changes as
soon as the modification starts).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So how would I check that the file change is done?One
way would be to keep checking in a loop if the mtime
changed if it did goto sleep and check again after a
few seconds, keep repeating this until the mtime stop
changing. But in my opinion this is a stupid way of
doing this so I am hoping one of you has a better way
of doing it.
</STRONG></P>

File locking might be useful. The script sees the change in the mtime,
then waits for the lock to go away and starts processing.  You would
have to tell the modifying program to use file locking though.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

	> [Sluggo] 
I would agree to use the kernel monitor first.  But for alternatives...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Why not have the first process send the second process a signal when it's
done?      Put the observing process in indefinate sleep, and have the
write process send a SIGALRM (Alarm) to kick it.  You'd prob'ly want to
put the observer's PID in a well-known file so the other process can find
it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Or use file locking.  The writer holds a write lock till it's done.  The
observer sees the mtime change and acquires a read lock.  The read lock
blocks until the write lock has released.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you really want to know when the mtime is set, look in the kernel
source.  or the libc source, and see what <TT> fwrite()</TT> does.  That's one of
the advantages of open-source software.  Even if you don't know much C,
you can still tell whether the word "mtime" appears above or below a
 <TT>write()</TT> call.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Or just think about why most programs don't have to worry about this.
Unix programs tend to open-write-close quickly, and close the file when
they don't need it.  (As opposed to Windows text editors, which often hold
the file open the whole time.)  Unless the program has to hold the file
open for a long time (e.g., streaming log entries), your chances of
hitting the file in the middle of an update are pretty slim.  Then think
about, what's the worst that would happen if you did?  Your observer would
produce garbled output, with part of one version and part of another.  Or
maybe it would crash.  Would this be the end of the world or a minor
inconvenience?  At least it would tell you how (in)frequently such a
collision is occurring.

From past experience I seem to remember that the only 'pure perl' way to
ensure that a file is not being modified, without relying on file locks,
is to check the size/mtime of the file, wait a bit, and then check it
again, repeat until the two size/mtimes are the same.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The reason I ran into this was because I was writing a routine to process
a file after it had been uploaded to an ftp server.  In the end, because
we had control over the ftp server, we configured it so that the uploader
and my routine both logged into the ftp server using the same username,
and restricted the number of times a user could concurrently login to 1.
This did the trick quite nicely.

[grin] Multiple xterms are useful for this. In one of them, run this
program:
</blockQuote>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tag/mike.show-mtime.pl.txt">mike.show-mtime.pl.txt</a></tt></p>
<blockQuote>
where "foo" is the file you're looking at; this will print the mtime of
'foo' once a second. In another xterm, open 'foo' and modify to your
heart's content - all the while glancing at the first term. Nice and
easy.

How about making a call to 'lsof' to see if the file is open?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I'm not sure if a latency in the kernel flushing disk buffers would be a
concern in this kind of scenario.  If so, you might want to have either
one of the processes make a call to flush the buffers to ensure that there
is not a pending update to the file.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In fact I've sometimes wondered about this myself: if there is a pending
write to a file via a dirty buffer, is that automatically taken into
account if I read the file before the buffer is flushed?  I.e., is the
pending change transparently mapped to a read of the file by libc or
whatever?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

It would be a very severe bug if it didn't read from the buffer, since
that's the official version currently.  I've sometimes wondered this
myself, but I've found the kernel developers pretty trustworthy so I
assumed they wouldn't do such a thing.

It seems to me that the kernel should update the mtime in the inode (as
the inode is transparently cached in RAM) *everytime a write(1) call is
made to the file*.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, at this point, your question expands to "if someone makes a write
call which takes a finite amount of realtime to execute (like, writing
1MB from a RAM buffer to a file), at which end of the execution of that
write call will the inode get updated?"

Short version:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>ext2 updates the inode <EM>after</EM> it writes the actual data,


<LI>since it's buffered, the order in which the actual bytes hit the disk is indeterminate, and


<LI>it's filesystem specific, since the answer to the question lives in a filesystem specific location in the source.

The specific answer lies in the relative positions of <TT> ll_rw_block()</TT> and
the assignment to inode-&gt;i_mtime in the function.

Wow, I didn't expect my question to generate such a
big response. Now I know why I like TAG :)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
NEways I did a little research after reading all your
answers and found the following:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>The file modification time changes continuously when
the file is being created/modified. (For example when
creating the file using cp).
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
To test this I wrote the following perl script that
displays the mtime of my test file every 1 second:
</STRONG></P>
<p align="center">See attached <tt><a href="misc/tag/suramya.show-mtime.pl.txt">suramya.show-mtime.pl.txt</a></tt></p>
<P><STRONG>
Then I opened another xterm window and ran the
following command: 'cp <TT>/var/log/messages</TT> test.dat'
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>suramya@StarKnight:~/Temp$ perl test.pl

</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
As you can see when the copy started the numbers
started changing. So now we know that the mtime keeps
changing when the file is being modified. And if you
think about it, it makes sense: The mtime changes
whenever any changes are made to the inode's used by
the file so when the file is being created new inodes
are being used constantly so the mtime has to change.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Now I will be looking into the other suggestions you
guys made and see if I can get this to work. (And no
this is not a school project
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) "

data from an oracle DB to a CSV file and have another

If that's the case, then a low tech solution might suffice.  Write your
CSV file out from oracle as something like 'temp_output.csv', and then
have your oracle process rename the file once it's fully exported.  Then
your perl script is only looking for the renamed file, instead of trying
to guess when the file creation is complete.

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Ben] 
Oh, <EM>nice</EM> solution, Pete! You could even follow the (more or less)
standard practice of "building" the file in a temp dir, then moving it
into the location from which it should be copied. As long as the temp
and the final locations are on the same partition, that's just a matter
of changing the inode info - which is an atomic op, so there's no chance
of retrieving a partial file.

Key-bindings as set by the user for the window manager are always greedy
with respect to the window manager.  So for instance, in FVWM, one might
have a key-binding such as:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Key X   A 3   Function FvwmTitleRxvt
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Now, of course, it might be the case that windowskey+X is an actual
binding to an application I have running, but it's tough -- the WM has
precedence in that binding as I have it defined there.

Always the window manager.  Remember that GNOME is just a framework and
a collection of utilities.  If you wanted a hierarchy, a depiction such
as the following is an accurate representation:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>GNOME &lt;--&gt; window manager --&gt; Application
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, the integration aspect of GNOME &lt;--&gt; Window Manager how
depends on EWMH.  I've talked about these in the past, but I might as
well summarise them here for clarity.  EWMHs are extensions from window
states which were first outlined by the ICCCM manual [1].  Unfortunately,
the ICCCM is rather old, but it does provide a fantastic framework on
which to build a WM, and it is still very relevant today.  When <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> and
GNOME were developing into the bloatware we see today, one thing they
both did were to extend the ICCCM to define their own window states.  Of
course, compatability became a nightmare in such instances, and so these
were cleaned up and standardised by the freedesktop people [2].  They're
only windowing hints at the end of the day for things such as 'Working
areas', 'Number of Desktops', and such like.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You may ask why the WM has precedence over an application, when it is
the job of the WM to manage applications.  The answer is simple.
Key-bindings are the job of the Xserver.  So actually the propogation
looks like this:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Xserver -&gt; Window Manager -&gt; Application.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
When you get your window manager to bind your keys for you, what's
actually happening is that the window manager will map the requests
itself, so it keeps a record of WM-specific keybindings.  When the WM
grabs the Xserver when it maps an application or a key-binding it then
checks to see (via the Xserver) whether that keybinding is WM-defined or
not.  If it <EM>is</EM> then it will act appropriately, else it will pass it
down to the underlying application, or do nothing.
</blockQuote>
<P><STRONG>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> 
A similar question could be raised regarding how window positioning
and decorations are decided/executed. Perhaps the overall GNOME/GTK
theme decides and passes on the info to the window manager which
actually executes these?
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] 
Not quite.  GTK itself is window manager agnostic.  When you apply a
GTK-theme, all that happens is that any currently running GTK apps are
redrawn by the Xserver.  There is no interaction with the window manager
in anyway while this is happening.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, GTK themes don't really allow for the stylation of title bars
-- that's the job of the WM, and rightly so.  You have to remember
thatit's the job of the xserver to map the window which the WM then
grabs and decorates as it sees fit.  So the decoration could come in any
form.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Window positioning is a separate entity in itself.  When windows are
mapped to the Xserver, the server will naturally map it to 0+0 which is
top-left.  The window manager already has one window that is top-level,
and that is the root-window.  This is the ultimate window from which
everything else stems from, when windows are created.  Consider the
following Xlib snippet:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>win = XCreateSimpleWindow(dpy, DefaultRootWindow(dpy), xsh.x, xsh.y,
	xsh.width, xsh.height, bw, bd, bg);
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
I could easily spend hours talking about this line of Xlib alone, but
I'll save you the gory details.  Essentially, the point you should
realise is that all windows created in this way [3] are always a child
of the root-window.  Why?  Well, it's all about management.  Once the Wm
knows the top-level window, it knows how to stack windows as well as
place hints on them.  Of course, the WM is not allowed to change
application-set windowing hints when the window is being mapped.
Indeed, this is really where 'xprop(1)' comes in useful.  This allows
one to examine all of the window states as well as set them.  There's
also 'xwininfo(1)' for a more high-level view, although to be honest, I
prefer FvwmIdent for such things.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, with window hierarchies comes the notion of Transient
windows.  These are (by definition) short-lived windows, such as dialog
boxes.  They'll often have the the following hint set:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[n6tadam@station ~]$ xprop | grep -i trans
WM_TRANSIENT_FOR(WINDOW): window id # 0x2a0002e
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The window manager might well treat these differently -- indeed, FVWM
does.  Due to their short-lived nature, it's often not desireable to
have all buttons on the titlebar, so FVWM might well not decorate
transient windows in such a manner.  Of course, one can change that
with:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Style * DecorateTransient
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Anyway, window positioning is managed by the window manager.  The
geometry of a window defines its position on screen, and hence its size.
In the form:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>widthx height+/- xorigin+/- yorigin
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Note that the window geometry will often be with respect the actual
window itself, and not the frame that surrounds it. In slight relation
to that is a window gravity.  There's 'Window Gravity' and 'Bit
Gravity', and they specify for the window as a whole (including the
borders) and the window contents how to react on window resizing.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, as you have no doubt guessed, it is not quite as simple as
-geometry.  There is certain other hints that provide additional
positioning.  Take for instance Mozilla.  That doesn't have a
'-geometry' option because of they way it was designed.  Instead that
remembers its position (and hence window size) each time it is closed.
The WM can be instructed to ignore or react to such things.  As is the
case with FVWM there's a hint called 'NoPPosition'.  This instructs FVWM
to place the window based on what/where it tells the WM to put it.
Hence:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Style gecko NoPPosition
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
would be such an example [4].  There are instances though where a window
will use PPosition hints as well as accept geometries.  Notably,
[X]emacs is such a beast and will set its PPosition to (0,0) each time,
so overriding that is paramount for some. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) "

specifications take precedence over PPosition hints where they're
supported.

I hope this helps.  I could rabbit on for ages about all of this, but
I'd rather answer such things as they come up, as opposed to overloading
you with tedious information.  Unfortunately, information such as this
is sparse, and represents my understanding through working with FVWM,
and Xlib in general.

<LI>Of course, it doesn't have to be at the low-level such as Xlib.  Often, languages have wrapper functions around XCreateSimpleWindow() which will automatically map a window to be a child of the root window.

Oh, how I wish it did.
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) " 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> Not a big thing, but this has been a
long-standing problem with Mozilla for me (both the Big Moz and now
Firefox): Due to couple of info bars that I use (MailDooHicky and the
Moaning Goat Meter),I like for my windows to span from the left edge of
the screen to ~100px short of the right edge, and from ~30px down from
the top to ~30px short of the bottom. Xterms are, of course, no problem
- I've got "XTerm*VT100*geometry: 134x40+0+21" in my ~/.Xresources, and
that takes care of it. Mozilla, well... I've got a little Java
bookmarklet on the toolbar that makes it jump to the correct position
whenever I find it too annoying. But it <em>  never  </em> remembers the position.

It does work, but it's dependant on how the window manager deals with
such things.  I have to say that some WMs are better than others in this
regard.  It has been many years since I used icewm for any serious use,
but as far as I can recall, it doesn't allow for arbitrary commands to
be run on a window.

Eh, well... for certain values of 'arbitrary'... kinda sorta. :)
You can't (so far as I know, at least) run commands on a window once
it's up. You can, however, assign initial properties to windows
(actually, your discussion of all this stuff is what I needed to remind
me of that - thanks!) by defining them in ~/.icewm/winoptions; in this
case, what I needed was:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>Gecko.Firefox-bin.geometry: 1212x722+0+23
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
This sets the initial position of the window to what I need, which is
perfect.

In FVWM, doing what you're
describing above can be achieved in two ways, the first is to use a
function, as in:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>DestroyFunc FuncStartMoveBrowser
AddToFunc   FuncStartMoveBrowser
+ I Exec exec $0
+ I Wait $0
+ I Next ($0) ResizeMove w+0 -100px 0 -30p
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
(I've most likely got the co-ordinates wrong, but that can be left as an
exercise to the reader).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So the above will exec the first formal argument to the function ($0),
wait for it to appear, and then will move and resize it to the said
co-ordinates.  You might invoke it thus:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>FuncStartMoveBrowser mozilla
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
One would replace 'mozila' with whatever program was wanted.  But there
are limitations with that method.  The first one is that it will only
work when invoked from within a menu, or FvwmConsole, and won't work if
one were to type in 'mozilla' from an Xterm.  In such cases where this
is more desirable, FvwmEvent can be used, as in:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>DestroyModuleConfig FvwmEvent-Browser: *
*FvwmEvent-Browser: Cmd Function
*FvwmEvent-Browser: add_window  FuncStartMoveBrowser
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Which would set up an event for each window that was created, calling
the function specified.  The function as we have it defined needs
modifying for use with FvwmEvent, as the window would have already been
created, hence:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>DestroyFunc FuncStartMoveBrowser
AddToFunc   FuncStartMoveBrowser
+ I All (CurrentDesk, AcceptsFocus, !Transient) ThisWindow ("gecko") ResizeMove w+0 -100px 0 -30p
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
I've used 'gecko' as that is the window class common to both Mozilla and
Firefox.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You're probably wondering how this helps you, Ben.  It doesn't, <em> but </em>
there is an application which can move and resize windows which you
could make use of, coupled with xwininfo(1).  It's called 'xwit' and is
just a wrapper program around some of the Xlib functions, so for
example:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>xwit -move x y -resize x y -names 'mozilla'
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
If you wanted to get specific, you could use xwininfo to fine tune
things, matching by window ID, etc.  Maybe a little crude, but it might
help you.

</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>ben@Fenrir:~$ xwininfo|grep 'Window id'
xwininfo: Window id: 0xc00031 "Google Advanced Search - Mozilla Firefox"
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Since Firefox changes its window name to whatever the site happens to
be, I have to <em>  click  </em> the Firefox window in order to find out its window
ID (which could then be used to do 'xwit' twiddling.) This is, shall we
say, suboptimal for the task.
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=" :) " 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> I'd imagine there are other ways to
hunt it down - 'xwininfo -all -root|grep Mozilla' comes to mind - but
that gets a bit shaky. Anyway, you've avalanched some synapses for
me, the appropriate brain cells fired, and All Is Now Well.

No worries.  You can probably get a fairly accurate result in making use
of '-root' to xwininfo, so something like:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>[n6tadam@station ~]$ xwininfo -root -all -tree | grep -m1 'Mozilla-bin'
     0x282c250 "Gecko": ("Gecko" "Mozilla-bin")  200x200+0+0  +0+0
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
At least with it displayed in a tree form (and stopping at the first
match), you can be fairly well assurred that you'll be matching the
parent window.

Use a program such as rox-filer [1] or 'idesk' (search LG.net for that
one, there was an article about it not so long ago).  You're also
suffering from a fundamental lack of understanding about what a desktop
environment is, and what a window manager is.  I'm not going to cover it
here again - see any of the recent LG releases within the last six
months.  Essentially the term "desktop" isn't.  It's just the
root-window.

You clearly don't pay enough attention to reading the LG, if at all.  :)
[2,3].  I suppose you ought to read the recent TAG entries as well [4,5,6].
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Only where those window managers are EWMH compliant [3], for which icewm
seems to be.  This allows things like the kde kicker and gnome's taskbar
to be handled correctly from the window manager that will run 'inside'
of the <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> or <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A> environment.  Effectively this process is using
Session Management [2], although in reading that, you would need to
replace the current running window manager in GNOME with icewm.  You
can't use "icewm --replace" as that's specific to FVWM, hence you should
use:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>killall metacity &amp;&amp; sleep 1 &amp;&amp; icewm &amp;
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
Then you'd have to save your session before you logged out (via
gnome-session-properties).  I have to say that I absolutely <em> hate </em>
session managers.  I can't stand them.  They're terrible at what they do
and what they do, is second rate.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you want to use KDE instead, the process can get a bit trickier -
I have heard rumours of the use of candles and goats, but....
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
KDE is started via the 'startkde' script.  If you edit that script what
you might see is a line such as:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>ksmserver
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
which starts the window manager (kwin by default). To start fvwm you
should add the option "-w icewm" to the ksmserver line, and save the
file.  On typing  'startkde' this should then launch icewm as the window
manager of choice.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Of course, all of this is theory - I don't use icewm so I am just
applying what I already know.

Thomas already mentioned that you're suffering from a bit of confusion
in this regard. You don't "create shortcuts on desktop"; you run an
application that allows you to create clickable icons linked to
applications. My favorite is "coolicon", which is available as a
standard <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> package; it does not come with particularly exciting
icons - but you can use any XPM image as an icon, and it's very
flexible, powerful, and lightweight.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You can also create clickable links on the IceWM toolbar - here's my
~/.icewm/toolbar file as an example:
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>prog "BackFlip" "xv.xpm" bkgr
prog "Lock screen" "lock_16x16.xpm" xlock -random
prog "CD Player" "dvd_unmount_16x16.xpm" grip --small
prog "Mix" "music_32ndnote_16x16.xpm" /usr/bin/tkmixer
prog "Firefox" "mozilla_16x16.xpm" /usr/bin/firefox
prog "JPilot" "pda_black_16x16.xpm" /usr/bin/jpilot
# prog "Liferea" "rebuild_16x16.xpm" /usr/local/bin/liferea
prog "Snap" "camera_16x16.xpm" /usr/local/bin/snap
prog "Cell-up" "randr_16x16.xpm" /usr/local/bin/cell-up
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
The first string after "prog" is the 'hover label' for the icon, the
second one is the 16x16 XPM image to be used, and the third one is the
program to execute. Simple and easy.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Furthermore, IceWM allows you to associate programs with other toolbar
entities (the mail notification icon, the CPU activity icon, the clock,
etc.) See the "preferences" file - same locations as the "menu" file -
and search for the word 'Command' (the variables will be MailCommand,
ClockCommand, etc.)

I'm an icewm boy.  I can answer two of your questions.  In your home
directory, once you save your preferences with the program called
'icepref', you will have a directory called .icewm.  There will be a
file called preferences.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
For a background image (wallpaper), set the following line:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
DesktopBackgroundImage="myfile.jpg"
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
In this case, a jpeg file will represent your wallpaper.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I have attached another file in that directory called programs.  It
represents your menu items.  The file that I have included is the one
that I use.  Modify this as you like.  In it you will see menu entries,
and within each menu entry, you will see prog entries.  The prog entries
are the selections within each menu.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Actually, I have attached both (preferences and programs) files.  If you
don't have icepref, just create the directory .icewm in your home
directory, and copy the attached files into that new directory.

If you're using a Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME, why do you
need a win manager at all, except to literally "manage windows;" that
is, what's the difference between Metacity or Icewm or Sawfish if you're
already using GNOME with all it's  icons, menus, etc.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Thomas] 
Because KDEs and GNOMEs framework are such that you <EM>can</EM> use different
window managers within them as long as they're EWMH-compliant.  It just
so happens that GNOME uses metacity now as its window manager or choice.
Before that, it was sawfish.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Adam] 
As "stand-alone"
win managers, sawfish and metacity don't seem to do much (on my system)
-- as compared to window maker or enlightentment or fvwm etc -- yet
sawfish and metacity are the "window managers" of GNOME, which doesn't,
as far as I know, have a win manager of its own.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

That's right, it doesn't.  It's allowed for the choice to be down to the
user.  Of course, most don't bother changing it, because the options
that GNOME gives them aren't dependant on the window manager being used,
but rather how GTK will react to those events;  in the same way that the
options GNOME allows for affect the gpanel, etc.

I don't understand  the relationship of a window manager, such as sawfish,
to a full desktop environment such as GNOME.  If I want to go with a
window manager, I use  window maker or enlightenment and customize it,
otherwise, I use KDE or GNOME for the "desktop experience."  Can anybody
explain what the  relationship between a window manager and a Desktop
Environment like GNOME?

Although, currently, campaigning for the European
Constitution referenda is dominating European politics at
the moment, the importance of contacting your MEPs on this
matter should not be underestimated.  Only by paying
attention to their actions, and calling them to account for
them (whatever your personal views), can citizens begin to
reduce the democratic deficit manifest in EU institutions.

<font color="green">Who's The Git?</font></h3>
<p>
Over the years we've seen a number of heated arguments 
among the members of the Linux kernel project.  Favourites
among these have included the debates over preemption
strategies and discussions of how to manage memory most
effectively.  A repeated focus for acrimonious discussion
has been Linus's choice of source-management
tool:
<a href="http://www.bitkeeper.com/">BitKeeper</a>.
The selection of a proprietary piece of software for this
fundamental part of the development infrastructure has rankled
many of the more idealistic open-source/free-software
purists in the development community.
<P>
This issue came to major prominence in the past month, as
Andrew Tridgell publicly revealed that he had reverse
engineered the BitKeeper protocol to allow developers to
obtain project meta-data from the repository.
On seeing this, the lead-developer of BitKeeper, Larry McVoy,
responded by revoking the free BitKeeper licences that have
been used by kernel developers since the tool was adopted by
the project.
<P>
This sequence of events drew the ire of
Linus Torvalds,
<a href="http://www.realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&PostNum=3322&Thread=2&entryID=49312&roomID=11">
who accused Tridgell</a>
of acting irresponsibly and
jeopardising an effective and working system without
offering any alternative.  Others in the free software
community, such as
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/15/perens_on_torvalds/">
Bruce Perens</a>, see these criticisms as unjustified, and
point out that Tridgell was essentially engaged in the same
type of activity that allowed him to develop 
<a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</a>.
<P>
Nonetheless, in spite of these travails, Linux kernel
development has not been stopped in its tracks.  An
alternative tool,
<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/4982">
git</a>,
to manage the kernel source 
(<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/5003">advice for
beginners</a>).
Following the 
<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/5014">
successful import</a>
of kernel source into git, the 2.6.12rc3 release
<a href="http://programming.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/04/21/1330210&from=rss">
is the first to be built up completely using git</a>.
<p>
An interesting aside to consider is
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/subversion-linus.html">
the response of the Subversion</a> project to discussion
among users that Subversion might be a suitable BitKeeeper
replacement.  Highlighting the difficulties in achieving a
compromise between Linux development practice and the
current Subversion feature-set, attention was instead
briefly focussed on three new version control systems that
have emerged in the past year or two
<a href="http://www.venge.net/monotone/">Monotone</a>
<a href="http://www.gnuarch.org/">GNU Arch</a>
and
<a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">SVK</a>.  All three of

<h1>Python for scientific use. Part I: Data Visualization</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/andreasen.html">Anders Andreasen</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h2>Motivation and outline</h2>

<p>A first step towards qualitative understanding and
interpretation of scientific data is visualization of the data.
Also, in order to reach a quantitative understanding, the data
needs to be analyzed, e.g. by fitting a physical model to the data.
The raw data may also require some initial processing in order to
become useful, e.g. filtering, scaling, calibration etc.</p>

<p>Several open source programs for data analysis and visualization
exist: <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">gnuplot</a>, <a href=
"http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/">grace</a>, <a href=
"http://www.octave.org">octave</a>, <a href=
"http://www.r-project.org">R</a>, and <a href=
"http://scigraphica.sourceforge.net/">scigraphica</a>. Each of
these has its own pros and cons. However, it seems like you always
end up using more than one program to cover all the different needs
mentioned above, at least if you don't have the programming
abilities to write your own custom programs using e.g., Fortran or
C.</p>

<p>Recently, I came across <a href=
"http://www.python.org">Python</a> and found it to be a very
powerful tool. In this article, I would like to share my experience
and illustrate that even with basic (or less) programming skills it
is still possible to create some very useful applications for data
analysis and visualization using this language. The article is
centered around a few illustrative examples and covers the
visualization part &mdash; data analysis will be covered in a
future article.</p>

<h2>Python: a brief review</h2>

<p>Python was originally created by Guido van Rossum and is an
interpreted programming language (like e.g. Perl) with a clear and
easy-to-read syntax. You can write stand-alone applications with
Python, but one of it's strengths is its ability to act as glue
between different kinds of programs.</p>

<p>The standard introduction to any programming language is the
<em>Hello world!</em> program. In Python this is generated by first
opening the Python interpreter by typing <code>python</code> on the
command line. Your screen should look something like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
Python 2.3.4 (#1, Jan 21 2005, 11:24:24)
[GCC 3.3.3 20040412 (Gentoo Linux 3.3.3-r6, ssp-3.3.2-2, pie-8.7.6)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
Then the following code is typed:

<pre class="code">
print "Hello world!"
</pre>

<p>Python code can also be stored in a file e.g. named
<code>script.py</code>. By convention, files containing python code
have a <code>*.py</code> extension. The script can be executed by
typing <code>python script.py</code> on the command line. The
program output will then be written to stdout and appear on the
screen. If the following line is added to the top of the file:</p>

<pre class="code">
#! /usr/bin/python
</pre>

<p>(assuming that the python executable or a symlink to it exists)
and giving the file executable mode with <code>chmod u+x
script.py</code> the script can be executed by typing
<code>./script.py</code> on the command line.</p>

<p>Python comes with many modules, either built-in or available for
separate download and installation. In this article we will use
<a href="http://www.scipy.org">SciPy</a>, which is a very powerful
library of modules for data visualization, manipulation and
analysis. It adds functionality to Python making it comparable to
e.g. octave and matlab.</p>

<h2>Plotting 2-D data</h2>

<h3>Example 1: Plotting x,y data</h3>

<p>The first example illustrates plotting a 2-D dataset. The data
to be plotted is included in the file <a href=
"misc/andreasen/tgdata.dat">tgdata.dat</a> and represents weight
loss (in wt. %) as a function of time. The plotting routine is in
the file <a href="misc/andreasen/tgdata.py.txt">tgdata.py</a> and
the python code is listed below. Line numbers have been added for
readability.</p>

<pre class="code">
     1  from scipy import *
     2
     3  data=io.array_import.read_array('tgdata.dat')
     4  plotfile='tgdata.png'
     5
     6  gplt.plot(data[:,0],data[:,1],'title "Weight vs. time" with points')
     7  gplt.xtitle('Time [h]')
     8  gplt.ytitle('Hydrogen release [wt. %]')
     9  gplt.grid("off")
    10  gplt.output(plotfile,'png medium transparent picsize 600 400')
</pre>

<p>To run the code, download the <a href=
"misc/andreasen/tgdata.py.txt">tgdata.py.txt</a> file, rename it
to <code>tgdata.py</code>, and run it with <code>python
tgdata.py</code>. Besides Python, you also need SciPy and gnuplot
installed. Gnuplot version 4.0 was used throughout this article.
The output of the program is a plot to screen as shown below. 
<!-- 29Apr2005 dsrich The original text of this next sentence was "A hard copy is also made." -->
The plot is also saved to disk as <code>tgdata.png</code> per line
4 above. <!--  --></p>
<img src="misc/andreasen/tgdata.png" alt="2-D TG data" width="600"
height="400">
<p>In line 1, everything from the SciPy module is imported. In order
to make use of the various functions of a module, the module needs
to be imported by adding an <code>import module-name</code> line to
the the python script. In this case it might have been sufficient
to import only the <code>gplt</code> package and the
<code>io.array_import</code> package. In line 3 the
<code>io.array_import</code> package is used to import the data
file <code>tgdata.dat</code> into the variable called
<code>data</code> as an array with the independent variable stored
in column 0 (note that array indices start with 0 as in C unlike
Fortran/Octave/Matlab where it starts at 1) and the dependent
variable in column 1. In line 4 a variable containing the file name
(a string) to which the plot should be stored. In line 6-10 the
<code>gplt</code> package is used as an interface to drive gnuplot.
Line 6 tells gnuplot to use column 0 as x-values and column 1 as
y-values. The notation <code>data[:,0]</code> means: use/print all
rows in column 0. On the other hand <code>data[0,:]</code> refers
to all columns in the first row.</p>
<!-- 29Apr2005 dsrich - This paragraph split from the paragraph above the
previous graphic and moved here (program discussion) for clarity. I am
also assuming that here is referring to the build options of gnuplot 
in his talking about libpng/zlibc/libgd. -->

<p>The gnuplot png option <code>picsize</code> can be a little
tricky. The example shown above works when Gnuplot is built with
<code>libpng + zlib</code>. If you have Gnuplot built with
<code>libgd</code> the required syntax becomes <code>size</code>
and the specified width and height should be comma separated.</p>

<p>In order to plot a file with a different file name, we have to
open the python source in a text editor and manually change the
name of the file to be imported. We also need to change the name of
the file copy if we do not want to overwrite the previous plot.
This is a little tedious. We can easily add this functionality to
our python script by allowing filenames to be passed as command
line arguments. The modified script is called <a href=
"misc/andreasen/tgdata1.py.txt">tgdata1.py</a> and is shown
below.</p>

<pre class="code">
     1  import sys, glob
     2  from scipy import *
     3
     4  plotfile = 'plot.png'
     5
     6  if len(sys.argv) &gt; 2:
     7          plotfile = sys.argv[2]
     8  if len(sys.argv) &gt; 1:

<p>In the first line we have imported two new modules &mdash;
<code>sys</code> and <code>glob</code> &mdash; in order to add the
desired flexibility. In Python, <code>sys.argv</code> contains the
command line arguments when execution starts.
<code>sys.argv[0]</code> contains the filename of the python script
executed, <code>sys.argv[1]</code> contains the first command line
argument, <code>sys.argv[2]</code> contains the second command line
argument and so on. The <code>glob.glob()</code> function behaves
as <code>ls</code> in *nix environments in that it supplies
filename wildcarding. If no matches are found it returns the empty
list (and thus has a len() of zero), otherwise it contains a list
of matching filenames. The script can be executed with any desired
number of command line arguments. If executed with two arguments
e.g. <code>python tgdata1.py tgdata.dat tgdata1.png</code> the
first argument is the name of the file containing the data to be
plotted, and the second argument is the desired name of the file
copy of the plot.</p>

<p>The script works as follows. A default file name for the hard
copy of the plot is stored in the variable <code>plotfile</code>
(line 4). Then some conditions about the number of given command
line arguments are checked. First, if two or more command line
arguments are given <code>plotfile</code> is overwritten with
argument no. 2 (line 6-7.) Any arguments after the second are
silently ignored. For 1 or more arguments given argument 1 is used
as the data file name (line 8-9). If no command line arguments are
passed, the user is prompted to input the name of the data file
(line 10-12). In case of an invalid file name being used for the
data file the script prints an error message and exits.</p>

<h3>Example 2: Plotting x,y data with error bars</h3>

<p>So far we have shown that the <code>gplt</code> package is easy
to interface with gnuplot and very effective. However, for
scientific use it is often desirable to represent uncertainties for
each data point. Although this is possible in gnuplot the
<code>gplt</code> interface lacks this functionality. Instead we
use the <code>popen</code> package included in the <code>os</code>
module. With <code>popen</code> it is possible connect to the stdin
(or stdout) of a program through a pipe.</p>

<p>The code below (also available in <a href=
"misc/andreasen/xrddata.py.txt">xrddata.py.txt</a>, the data file
is available as <a href=
"misc/andreasen/xrddata.dat">xrddata.dat</a>) more or less shows
how example 1 is reproduced using <code>popen</code> instead of the
<code>gplt</code> package. The major difference is the fact that
with <code>popen</code> it is not necessary to import the data to
be plotted into Python - instead it is read directly by
gnuplot.</p>

<pre class="code">
     1  import os
     2
     3  DATAFILE='xrddata.dat'
     4  PLOTFILE='xrddata.png'
     5  LOWER=35
     6  UPPER=36.5
     7
     8  f=os.popen('gnuplot' ,'w')
     9  print &gt;&gt;f, "set xrange [%f:%f]" % (LOWER,UPPER)
    10  print &gt;&gt;f, "set xlabel 'Diffraction angle'; set ylabel 'Counts [a.u.]'"
    11  print &gt;&gt;f, "plot '%s' using 1:2:(sqrt($2)) with errorbars title 'XRPD data' lw 3" % DATAFILE
    12  print &gt;&gt;f, "set terminal png large transparent size 600,400; set out '%s'" % PLOTFILE
    13  print &gt;&gt;f, "pause 2; replot"
    14  f.flush()
</pre>

<p>The code of example 2 produces the output shown below. The error
bar plot is created with <code>plot 'filename' using 1:2:(sqrt($2))
with errorbars</code> because in <a href=
"misc/andreasen/xrddata.dat">xrddata.dat</a> the standard
deviations are equal to the square root of the y-values. This is a
special case and usually errors are given explicitly as a third
data column in the data file. Thus, an error bar plot is created
with <code>plot 'filename' using 1:2:3 with errorbars</code>.</p>

<h2>Plotting 3D-data</h2>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

<p>Now we look at how 3-D data can be represented by using a
combination of Python/gnuplot. In order for gnuplot to represent
3-D data it requires that the data is either given by a
mathematical expression or stored in a data file. The data file
should have either a <em>matrix</em>-format where z-values are
given as a matrix with x and y equal to the row and column number,
respectively, corresponding to each z-value or a 3 column format
where each row represents a data triple with x, y, and z given by
the 1., 2., and 3. column respectively. See the <a href=
"http://www.gnuplot.info/docs/gnuplot.html#data-file_">gnuplot
manual</a> for further details.</p>

<p>The data to be represented in a 3-D fashion in this example is
actually a collection of 2-D data files (like the one shown in
example 2). Each data file corresponds to an experiment at a
different time (with 150 s intervals between experiments) so we
have two independent variables and one dependent variable: x(file
number/time), y (diffraction angle),and z(counts) distributed
across several files. This makes the 3-D data not suitable for
plotting &mdash; <em>yet</em>.</p>

<p>The script <a href=
"misc/andreasen/3ddata_1.py.txt">3ddata_1.py</a> shown below finds
all files with a given extension (*.x_y in this case) in the
current working directory and creates a list containing their file
names (line 5, <code>FILELIST</code>). In line 6 the number of data
rows in each file is determined (<code>SIZEX</code>). This
information, including the number of data files, is then used to
construct an array (<code>DATAMATRIX</code>) with a size of
<code>SIZEX</code> by <code>len(FILELIST)</code>. In lines 11-12 we
cycle through the data files copying the second column in datafile
number y is copied to column number y in <code>DATAMATRIX</code>.
The array now holds all z-values. This array is only temporary,
suitable for data processing before the actual data file for the
3-D plotting is written.</p>

<p>In line 14-22 the data file is written in the (x,y,z) format
with x corresponding to time (found by multiplying the file number
with the time step), y corresponding to diffraction angle as given
by <code>TWOTHETA</code>, z corresponding to counts. In this case
we only want to plot the data with diffraction angles between 35-60
(corresponding to data rows 1126-1968). Therefore, only this range
is written to file in order to speed up both the process of writing
to file and the plotting. In line 24-29 gnuplot is fed input using
the <code>popen</code> package.</p>

<pre class="code">
     1  import os, glob
     2  from scipy import *
     3
     4  EXT='*.x_y'
     5  FILELIST=glob.glob(EXT)
     6  SIZEX = len(io.array_import.read_array(FILELIST[0]))
     7  DATAMATRIX = zeros((SIZEX,len(FILELIST)), Float)
     8  TWOTHETA=io.array_import.read_array(FILELIST[0])[:,0]
     9  TIMESTEP=150
    10
    11  for y in range(len(FILELIST)):
    12                  DATAMATRIX[:,y]=sqrt(io.array_import.read_array(FILELIST[y])[:,1])
    13
    14  file = open("3ddata.dat", "w")
    15
    16  for y in range(len(FILELIST)):
    17          for x in range(1126,1968):
    18                  file.write(repr(TIMESTEP*y)+" "\
    19                  +repr(TWOTHETA[x])+" "+repr(DATAMATRIX[x,y]))
    20                  file.write("\n")
    21          file.write("\n")
    22  file.close()
    23
    24  f=os.popen('gnuplot' ,'w')
    25  print &gt;&gt;f, "set ticslevel 0.0 ;set xlabel 'Time [s]'; set ylabel 'Diffraction angle'"
    26  print &gt;&gt;f, "set pm3d; unset surface; set view 60,75; splot '3ddata.dat' notitle"
    27  print &gt;&gt;f, "set terminal png large transparent size 600,400; set out '3ddata_1.png'"
    28  print &gt;&gt;f, "replot"
    29  f.flush()
</pre>

<p>If you wanted to write a 3-D data file in the
<em>matrix</em>-format, lines 14 through 22 can be replaced with
the following code.</p>

<pre class="code">
file = open("3ddata_matrix.dat", "w")
for x in range(SIZEX):
        for y in range(len(FILELIST)):
                file.write(repr(DATAMATRIX[x,y])+" ")
        file.write("\n")
file.close()
</pre>

<p>The 3-D plot produced by the above script is shown below.</p>
<img src="misc/andreasen/3ddata_1.png" alt="3-D (pseudo) XRPD data"
width="600" height="500">
<p>The plot above shows that it can be difficult to produce a 3-D
plot of non-monotonic data that shows all of the details of the
data &mdash; some of the smaller peaks are hidden behind larger
peaks. It is also difficult to see changes in peak positions as a
function of time. In order to bring out these details it is
sometimes better to create a 2-D contour plot by projecting the
z-values down into the x,y plane. This is achieved by replacing
lines 24-29 of <a href=
"misc/andreasen/3ddata_1.py.txt">3ddata_1.py</a> with the code
below (<a href=
"misc/andreasen/3ddata_2.py.txt">3ddata_2.py</a>).</p>

<pre class="code">
f=os.popen('gnuplot' ,'w')
print &gt;&gt;f, "set pm3d map; set palette rgbformulae 30,31,32; set xrange[0:4500]"
print &gt;&gt;f, "set xlabel 'Time [s]'; set ylabel 'Diffraction angle'"
print &gt;&gt;f, "splot '3ddata.dat' notitle"
print &gt;&gt;f, "set terminal png large transparent size 600,500; set out '3ddata.png'"
print &gt;&gt;f, "replot"
f.flush()
</pre>

<p>The contour plot is shown below.</p>

<img src="misc/andreasen/3ddata_2.png" alt="3-D (pseudo) XRPD data"
width="600" height="500">

<p>The 3-D example plots were made with 39 data files, each containing 4096
data rows. The data files are available at this <a
href="http://andr.dk/wiki/index.php/Supplementary_material#Linux_gazette_114">offsite
link</a>, and can be unpacked with <code>tar xvfz 3ddata.tar.gz</code>.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this article a few examples have been given in order to
illustrate that Python is indeed a powerful tool for visualization
of scientific data by combining the plotting power of gnuplot with
the power of a real programming language. It should be noted that
all the examples given here could probably have been solved with a
combination of e.g. <code>bash</code>, <code>gawk</code> and
gnuplot. It appears to me that Python is much simpler and the
resulting scripts are more transparent and easy to read and
maintain. If heavy data processing is required the
bash/gawk/gnuplot might also need the added functionality of e.g.
octave. With Python this functionality is in SciPy.</p>

<h1>A Tale of Three Conferences</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>
-- Software Development West 2005, Santa Clara Convention Center<br>
-- Open Source Business Conference (OSBC), Westin St. Francis, San Francisco<br>
-- MySQL User Conference, Santa Clara Convention Center<br>
</p>

<p> Three significant conferences in March and April provided evidence of a
paradigm shift in our industry. Two were for geeks and one was also for
IT managers and Gucci-shoed VCs. </p>

<p> The paradigm shift is in group development methodologies - and it's
getting support partly from the increasing acceptance of Open Source
Software(OSSw). Because OSSw calls for the collaboration of many
individual contributors in far-flung locations, Test Driven Development
(TDD) is a rising star in the developer world.</p>

<p> The gurus of software design and technique are now extolling TDD, and
are finding that it dovetails nicely with other schools of developer best
practice. Many gurus, some grudgingly, now extol TDD because the
disciplines they have advocated over the years 'just fall out' of the
practice of coding test cases first or simultaneously with each module.
Tools like JUnit - freely available and open-sourced - reinforce this
shift.</p>

<p> We all know we should do our Design work up-front, and that we should
code in small modules to encourage reuse, and that Agile and XP programming
methods advocate frequent, small steps, and we should regularly refactor
code and test performance during development, and... and.... It is
interesting that TDD enforces all of these and other best practices without
having to attend a lot of classes and reading at least half a dozen books.
TDD Just Works&trade;. </p>

<p> First, there should always be a test-case for each bit of code.
Second, writing test cases encourages up-front design. Third, you always
have working code at the end of a unit. And fourth, consistent with OSSw
strategies, major bugs are uncovered early and dealt with in the
development phase. Just like in the case of XP, you can have stylistic
variations with TDD - but there is a lot more agreement than disagreement.
</p>

<p> The new wrinkle with OSSw is that new applications - and new companies
- drive value up the stack. A company like Google doesn't spend all of its
time just tweaking its web servers; just take a look at <a
href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> with its satellite images.
It relies on standard hardware and software to be the base for totally
new applications. And that standard software is increasingly become
dependent on Open Source.</p>

<p> In fact, it's not just about the software itself: it's the utility of
that software to a user or company. Google and Yahoo and eBay provide
services to users, and the value of those services drives users to their
web sites. But it's not the underlying hardware or the OS that necessarily
enhance these services; instead, it's how developers leverage the
underlying platforms in new and creative ways. </p>

<p> TDD and OSSw have an overlap, a sweet spot where developers become
enabled by tools and methodologies that free them up to do the next thing
- which will, of course, be totally awesome and amazing, or so goes the
promise of this Brave New World. In either case, it's nice that Linux and
its OSSw cousins will be part of that.</p>

<p> Conspiracy theorists will speculate about coincidence of the Santa
Clara Convention Center hotel, originally a DoubleTree, becoming a Westin.
Does that mean that Westin is the chain of choice for techno-geek? Or an
open source Mecca? I think not. </p>

<p> At OSBC, the stars were visionaries, suits, and venture capitalists.
Small companies were looking for financing, large companies were testing
the Open Source waters, and the model of free software and paid support was
being refined and extended into an ecosphere of interrelated companies and
development communities.</p>

<p> At the MySQL User Conference [I may use MUC as an acronym occasional],
however, the emphasis was different: the stars here were Open Source
developers, many now employees of a confident, growing MySQL AB, now 10
years old. Since these folks came from over 40 countries, it was a very
festive time.</p>

<p> This year, the MySQL User Conference was managed by O'Reilly Media.
This kept things interesting and edgy - and attendees were also encouraged
to come to O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conference in SF during the fall. </p>

<p> Technical sessions were only 50 minutes long with a 30 min or longer
breaks after every two sessions, and even the Monday tutorials were only 3
hours long. Sessions moved quickly, often with little time for Q&amp;A.  By
contrast, sessions at SD West were almost double at 90 minutes, and some
security workshops spanned two sessions in the same room. I preferred the
longer ones, since that allowed attendees to move if the material or
presentation wasn't what was expected.</p>

<p> The food at MUC was hotel banquet style, and O'Reilly put a book into
each of the conference tote bags [for early registrants, at least.] This
contrasts with no books and sandwich boxes at OSBC and SD West. The
difference may be that O'Reilly and MySQL AB treated the participants as
customers, or even potential authors, and cultivated them more. </p>

<p> Another difference was the approach to internet access. At SD West,
there was a limited number of internet-connected machines for emailing -
but at OSBC and MUC there were none. The assumption there seemed to be that
almost everyone has a personal laptop or pocket PC, and the conference
organizers only needed to provide wireless access. We'll probably see more
of this as a way to cut conference costs, so be prepared to travel to
conferences with a 'device' of your own. </p>

<p> Each of the conferences had their stalwarts who come year after year
[that was less so at OSBC, since this was only the second year]. However,
informal conversations showed a very high level of satisfaction with the
MySQL User Conference. This may be partly due to the tighter subject
focus and the clear technical levels of the sessions. It may also have
been due to the friendly user community that has emerged around MySQL.
</p>

<p> Read on to find out more about the individual conferences and their
highlights. </p>

<h1>Secure Knoppix on CD-ROM for Disaster Recovery</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<!-- 20050505 dsrich - Added hyperlinks to relevants sites and
section headers as necessary - no hrefs in text originally. -->

<p>A friend recently sent me a CD with a version of <a href=
"http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html">Knoppix</a> designed
to enable surfing the Internet without risk. For its intended
purpose alone worth looking at, to me the real mind-blower is its
use to recover from disaster.</p>

<p>As chance would have it, I had barely started to play around
with it a bit when our nephew called: Blue Screen of Death. No
back-up. Cool. Yeah, OK, come on over tomorrow afternoon and I'll
see what I can do. Windows?! Well...</p>

<p>This thing was put together by people who really know what they
are doing. Their use of symbolic links was sheer genius. Well, OK,
if you insist, pretty straight-forward &mdash; that's what they're
there for.</p>

<h2>What is Knoppix?</h2>

<p>Knoppix is a self-contained mini-version of Linux on CD-ROM. I
had heard of it, of course, but never had the time to investigate
it. Big mistake. It is well worth being familiar with.</p>

<p>This particular version is intended basically to turn your PC
into something like a diskless workstation. You boot from the
CD-ROM and it sets up an environment analogous to a chroot-jail
without access to any hard drive. In this environment you can surf
with Firefox. Even save settings &mdash; to diskette or USB. And
when you are all done, whatever you haven't yourself explicitly
saved somewhere is history.</p>

<p>No virus. No trojan. No spyware. No cookies. Nada. Niente. Rien.
Nichevo.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this was introduced to me by a friend
who had no prior experience with GNU/Linux because the software he
requires professionally is only available under Windows. But he is
using it now for Internet access. Pretty easy to understand. I like
Firefox, too.</p>

<h2>Putting it to work</h2>

<p>OK, so I admit, I haven't gone surfing with it just yet. But is
it ever a powerful recovery tool! I like <a href=
"http://www.toms.net/rb/">Tom's Boot Disk</a>, which is on the
<a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com">Ultimate Boot CD</a> along
with quite a few other useful tools. But you have to experience
what this thing can do.</p>

<p>Perhaps it should be pointed out that this is based on Debian
and the kernel is a bit old, 2.4.29.
<!-- 20050505 dsrich - What version of Knoppix is he talking about - According
to the changelog, they were running 2.4.27 through the 3.6 and 3.7 releases,
then dropped 2.4.x completely in 3.8.1, which is the latest - his version must
have been heavily hacked. Other points made in text indicate this also. -->
But so what? There aren't too many exploits possible if there is
nowhere to store anything. And nothing unusual to look at.</p>

<p>Once you boot, you are given a gui &mdash; user, not root &mdash;
under X11 and options to do things needed to surf. That's it. No
hard drive. Everything you need to access the Internet and not a
single thing more.</p>

<p>However &mdash; this is Linux after all &mdash; there are the
other virtual terminals. All already logged in as root.</p>

<p>Very quickly I was able to put together a simple script with
which to establish a network connection. And mounting a drive or
partition is no biggey &mdash; Knoppix has /etc/fstab all set up
for us, mount-points for every single formatted partition.</p>

<p>During the time I needed to use it, the only things I really
missed were Midnight Commander and netcat. Apparently netcat is
entirely self-contained because there was no no trouble running it
copied from a floppy, copied there from SuSE 8.0. On the fly (and
without SSH) over the network "cp -R" along with netcat had to
substitute for "mc".</p>

<p>Knoppix seems to deal fairly well with "mature" hardware. While
X11 baled out on the Pentium 166 with 32 MB, I didn't want to surf
on it anyway. And several command-line interfaces as root anywhere
is nirvana!</p>

<p>I ought to mention that I was unable to boot the 5-year-old
Toshiba notebook (AMD K-5) from the CD. There are numerous options
one can enter at boot but none of them helped. My guess is that
there is something wrong with a file needed only for the notebook
&mdash; repeated read errors on one specific block. Proprietary
that they are, notebooks are notoriously difficult to configure and
deal with anyhow, so no real surprise and not particularly
important to me.</p>

<h2>Tinkering Under the Hood</h2>

<p>Ignoring its original intent, this is a wonderful tool for
disaster recovery with both network and mountable devices on which
to rescue data. You likely will still want whatever tools you have
collected over time to diagnose things like hardware problems. And
we're root, so we still do need to be extremely careful about what
we do. I had no trouble using fdisk to re-format our nephew's
second hard drive and allocate partitions.</p>

<p>The way the people who put this together went about it was very
impressive. Instead of hard-wiring everything in, they made
skillful use of soft-links. Once I noticed that /etc/hosts etc.
were soft-links, it didn't take long to do a script on a floppy to
copy what I really wanted from it to /tmp, remove the links and
replace them with references to the files in /tmp.</p>

<p>All that was necessary to set up networking was to copy
/etc/hosts, /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny from one machine
to diskette and then shut it down while our nephew was here and his
machine was attached to the network. No long-term approach, but
effective in haste.</p>

<p>I looked at the contents of /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, and /usr/sbin

daemons, window managers or bells-and-whistles, as if anyone should
care in the intended environment. Since this CD isn't even half
full, you might want to check for your favorite programs before
producing your own.</p>

<p>The version I was given was in German but included texts for
English prompts at boot. It looks like it ought to be pretty
straight-forward to rename two files in order to change to English
before burning a CD. And they might serve as patterns for other
languages. Pure speculation.</p>

<p>So our nephew brought his PC over and we connected it to the
LAN. Between that and a USB-stick we were able to recover about 90
percent of the stuff he hadn't backed up properly from a drive that
seems to have developed a heat-allergy leading to read errors
&mdash; this drive also had operating system. When all was said and

<p>If you decide to use this software for Internet access, do be
aware of the significance of those root sessions &mdash; without

/etc/hosts and friends are tightly locked down. But it was
extremely easy for me to open up network access.</p>

<p>So if some SOB somehow can get some sort of attachment past you

<h1>Shelling your Linux box with Festival</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/john.html">Maxin B. John</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>Do you want a bit more "humanized" version of your computer? If
you are ready for this adventure, all that you need is a computer
with Linux operating system and a little bit of time to download
and install the required programs. Now let us have some fun with
bash and Festival TTS (<u>T</u>ext <u>T</u>o <u>S</u>peech)
software.</p>

<h3>My setup</h3>

<p>I am using a Pentium 4 (1.6 GHz) machine with 128 MB of RAM and
Redhat Linux 9 installed. The system has an onboard soundcard,
which is quite sufficient for this venture. 
<!-- 20050501 dsrich - Details? ALSA or OSS - What comes with
RH9 and how is it installed? -->
If you want some privacy with your system, I would also recommend a
pair of headphones.</p>

<h3>Software installation</h3>

<p>The software that we are going to use is the Festival speech
synthesis system &mdash; a Text to Speech program developed by the
University of Edinburgh. The power of shell scripting can harness
the full potential of the Festival program. Festival comes bundled
with Redhat 9 and Fedora distributions. If you don't have it
installed, you can download it from <a href=
"http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/downloads/festival/1.95/">http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/downloads/festival/1.95/</a>
or install from its rpm package using the usual rpm command.</p>

<h3>Let's begin</h3>

<p>Just like every C language book begins, let us start with a
"Hello World" program. For this type</p>

<pre>
echo  "Hello World"| festival --tts 
</pre>

<p>at the command prompt. If everything is working, we should hear
"Hello World" through the speakers.</p>

<h3>The "Salute" Program</h3>

<p>Now let's write a script to play something like "Good morning
Sir" whenever we log on to the system. The sound output will
dynamically change based on the login time. The shell script goes
like this:</p>

<pre class="code">

#!/bin/bash

dat=`date +%H`
morning=12
afternoon=15
evening=24

if [ $dat -le $morning ] 
then
        echo "Good morning sir" |festival --tts

elif [ $dat -gt $morning ] &amp;&amp; [ $dat -le $afternoon ]
then
        echo "Good afternoon sir"|festival --tts

elif [ $dat -gt $afternoon ] &amp;&amp; [ $dat -le $evening ]
then
        echo "Good evening sir"|festival --tts
fi

</pre>

<p>Save this file as <code>salute.sh</code> in your home directory,
then edit <code>.bash_profile</code> in your home directory and add
<code>. ~/salute.sh</code> to it. 
<!-- 20050501 dsrich - Deleted "If you log in as root, write /root/salute.sh in your
.bash_profile file."  This sort of misbehavior should not be encouraged! -->
Now whenever you login to your system, you will hear the "sweet
salute."</p>

<h3>Create a "Virtual Personal Assistant" with cron</h3>

<p>Festival can be used along with the cron to create a personal
assistant who reminds you about your appointments. Cron is used to
schedule programs in Linux. If it is not already running, start the
cron deamon by running <code>service crond start</code> as root.
Now create your sound alerts &mdash; put the following lines into
tea.sh in your home directory:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
echo  "Don't forget to drink tea at 6.30 "| festival --tts
</pre>

<p>Now schedule this as a job in the cron with specified date and
time. To remind you of this every day at 6.30 P.M , create a file
and name it <code>test</code>. In it insert the line given
below</p>

<pre>
30 18 * * *  sh ~/tea.sh
</pre>

<p>and run the command</p>

<pre>
crontab test
</pre>

<p>to schedule the event. To check that the job is correctly
scheduled, run <code>crontab -l</code>. The system will speak the
message at the specified time. You could even program your parents
PC to wish them happy birthday and surprise them.</p>

<h3>Get really hot news from BBC World website</h3>

<p>Curious to know what is happening around the world? You can
create a News reader to fetch the hot news from the BBC world
website and read it for you. For this purpose, we are going to use
the RSS feed of that website.</p>

<p>Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a technology for sharing
information on the web. It simple and well-established XML format
used to syndicate headlines. Once a website creates an RSS file
they have created a means to allow others to retrieve their
headlines. Popular news sites like Yahoo!, BBC News, The New York
Times along with tens of thousands of personal blogs and
independant media sites all publish RSS feeds that we can use.</p>

<p>This shell script will fetch the RSS feed from the BBC World
website and then process its headlines and contents. The output is
then piped to the Festival program so we can hear the hottest news
happening around the world.</p>

<pre class="code">

#!/bin/sh
#Shell script to fetch and read the hottest news from BBC world using Festival
                                                                                                 
#Here we specify the url
url="http://news.bbc.co.uk/rss/newsonline_uk_edition/world/rss.xml"
                                                                                                 
#specify the proxyserver here, if you have one
proxy="151.8.18.40:6588"
                                                                                                 
headarg="-10"  # default is five headline, change it to increase the no of feeds
                                                                                               
#specify the proxy with -x option in curl program, if you
#don't use one, then remove the '-x "$proxy"' part
curl --silent -x "$proxy" "$url" | grep -E '(title&gt;|description&gt;)' | \
  sed -n '4,$p' | \
  sed -e 's/&lt;title&gt;//' -e 's/&lt;\/title&gt;//' -e 's/&lt;description&gt;/   /' \
      -e 's/&lt;\/description&gt;//' | \
         
#Here we pump the output to Festival
   head $headarg | fmt|festival --tts
exit 0
</pre>

<p>Save the code as <code>rss.sh</code> and run it as</p>

<pre>
sh rss.sh
</pre>

<p>Make sure that you are connected to internet before running this code,
since the <code>curl</code> program needs to contact the bbcworld website
and fetch the contents.</p>

<h3>The god of small things</h3>

<p>Sometimes I wish I could hire somebody to read me books or
boring man pages. Nowadays I don't read man pages &mdash; I just
listen to them! For example, to hear the man page of cron:</p>

<pre>
man cron | festival --tts  
</pre>

<p>Curious to know the name of people logged on to your system?</p>

<pre>
 who | awk " print {$1};"| festival --tts

</pre>

<p>There are lots of things you can have read to you - give them a
try!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The power of Festival combined with shell scripting is huge
&mdash; the sky is the limit.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>

<p>I haven't discussed the theory behind the text to speech as it
is out of the scope of this article. If you are curious, visit

<h1>Right To Your Own Devices</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/kapil.html">Kapil Hari Paranjape</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Linux 2.4.x had the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) and other
multi-disk/multi-partition block device constructs. These have been
enhanced by the Device Mapper in Linux 2.6.x. Here is a one line
summary:</p>

<blockquote>You can choose any sequence of blocks on a sequence of
block devices and create a new block device <em>some</em> of whose
blocks are identified with the blocks you chose
earlier.</blockquote>
That'll take a while to chew on. Meanwhile here are some ways you
can use the device mapper:

<ul>
<li>What files will this program create? Get it to write them on a
COW!</li>

<li>Let the file-system not go on holiday while you take
snapshots.</li>

<li>Dice it, slice it, and resize it - but don't reboot.</li>

<li>If your data is more valuable than the hard disk - encrypt
it.</li>
</ul>
There <em>is</em> a catch, of course. To do all this with the
<em>root</em> device, some changes need to be made at boot time.
Rather than get diverted, we will concentrate on learning how to
use the device mapper - to do this we will use &ldquo;dummy&rdquo;
loop devices instead of &ldquo;real&rdquo; disks. After you have
gained some confidence, you can move on to real disks and perhaps
even the root device.

<h3>How To Fake It With A Loop</h3>

<p>In Unix, everything is a file. Even a block device like
<code>/dev/hda2</code> which is meant to be read in
&ldquo;chunks&rdquo; called <em>blocks</em>, can be read
byte-by-byte like a file. The loop device allows us to reverse this
asymmetry and treat any file like a block device. Activate loop
devices for your Linux with <code>modprobe loop</code> (as root) if
necessary.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this without risking serious damage to useful
files, we will only use empty files. First of all, create an empty
file like so:</p>

<pre>
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/store1 bs=1024 seek=2047 count=1
</pre>
This creates a file full of nothing and 2 Megabytes in size. Now we
make it into a block device:

<pre>
    losetup /dev/loop1 /tmp/store1
</pre>
We then operate with this block device just as we would with any
other block device:

<ol type="1">
<li>Check its size in 512-byte blocks

<pre>
        blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1
</pre></li>

<li>Make a file system on it

<pre>
        mke2fs /dev/loop1
</pre></li>

<li>Mount this file system somewhere

<pre>
        mount /dev/loop1 /mnt
</pre></li>
</ol>
After this you can use <code>/mnt</code> just as you would any
other file-system - the changes will be written to
<code>/tmp/store1</code>. When you get tired of playing with the
loop blocks, you put them away with commands like <code>losetup -d
/dev/loop1</code>.

<p>We will use loop devices like <code>/dev/loop1</code>,
<code>/dev/loop2</code> and so on as the building block devices in
what follows.</p>

<h3>Step Into My Parlor...</h3>

<p>...said the device mapper to the block device. If it is not
already activated, load the device mapper for your Linux with
<code>modprobe dm-mod</code> (as root.) The device mapper can take
any block device under its wing with a command like</p>

<pre>
    echo 0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1) linear /dev/loop1 0 | \
        dmsetup create new
</pre>
This creates a &ldquo;new&rdquo; block device
<code>/dev/mapper/new</code>; but this is not really new data.
Reading from this block device returns <em>exactly</em> the same
result as reading directly from <code>/dev/loop1</code>; similarly
with writing to this block device. Looks a lot like the same old
blah in a new block device! So you could get rid of this block
device by <code>dmsetup remove new</code>.

<p>Of course, you can do things differently. For example, you can
take only half of <code>/dev/loop1</code> as your block device:</p>

<pre class="code">
    SIZE1=$(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1)
    echo 0 $(($SIZE1 / 2)) linear /dev/loop1 0 | \
        dmsetup create half
</pre>
The remaining half (which could be the bigger &ldquo;half&rdquo; if
<code>/dev/loop1</code> is odd-sized!) is then also available for
use. You could use it in combination with <code>/dev/loop2</code>
to create another block device:

<pre class="code">
    REST1=$((SIZE1 - $SIZE1 / 2))
    echo 0 $REST1 linear /dev/loop1 $((SIZE1 / 2))  &gt; /tmp/table1
    echo $REST1 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop2) \
        linear /dev/loop2 0 &gt;&gt; /tmp/table1
    dmsetup create onenahalf /tmp/table1
</pre>
Let us try to understand this example and what each of the three
numbers on each line of <code>/tmp/table</code> mean. The first
number is the starting sector of the map described, the second
number is the number of sectors in the map. The word
<code>linear</code> is followed by the name of the original device
that the map refers to; this is followed by the sector number of
the first sector (of this original device) which is assigned by
this map. Read that again!

<p>So you can slice and splice your disks as you like - but there
<em>is</em> a small cost, of course. All operations to these new
block devices go through the device mapper rather than directly to
the underlying hardware. With efficient table management in the
kernel, this overhead should not slow down things perceptibly.</p>

<p>Notice how I slipped in (clever me!) the use of
&ldquo;tables&rdquo; that contain the mapped device descriptions.
If you are planning to use mapped devices a lot and don't want to
forget your settings, such tables are the way to go. Don't worry -
you can always get the table of any device like
<code>/dev/mapper/new</code> by</p>

<pre>
    dmsetup table new
</pre>
In the output, the original block device will appear as
<code>major:minor</code>, so you will have to figure out what the
device is actually called if you need the table in human readable
form. (Hint: Try

<pre>
    ls -l /dev | grep "$major, *$minor"
</pre>
or something very like it.) Don't forget to run

<pre>
    dmsetup remove half
    dmsetup remove onenahalf
</pre>
when you are through.

<p>Perhaps you are one of those people who own multiple disks
configured so that reading <em>n</em> bytes from one of them is
<em>slower</em> than reading <em>n</em>/2 bytes from two of them;
this may happen because your disk controller is capable of
multi-disk operations in parallel or because you have multiple disk
controllers. The device mapper can help you to speed up your
operations.</p>

<pre class="code">
    SIZE=$(( $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1) + \
         $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop2) ))
    echo 0 $SIZE striped 2 16 /dev/loop1 0 /dev/loop2 0 | \
        dmsetup create tiger
</pre>
Now reads/writes from <code>/dev/mapper/tiger</code> will alternate
(in 16 sector chunks) between the two devices; you will also have
combined the disks into one as in the <code>linear</code> case.

<h3>Snapshots and COWs</h3>

<p>There may be a number of reasons why you may want to stop all
writes to your block device but not want the system to come to a
grinding halt.</p>

<dl compact>
<dt><b>Regular backups</b>
</dt>

<dd>&ldquo;Classically&rdquo; machines were put in single-user mode
to take backups. Backing-up a &ldquo;live&rdquo; system has the
risk of incomplete or corrupted files and erroneous time
stamps.</dd>

<dt><b>Security</b>
</dt>

<dd>This jazzy new screen saver you want to install - what changes
is it going to make to your file-system? You want to find out.</dd>

<dt><b>CDROMs</b>
</dt>

<dd>...or other read-only physical devices. Say you want to set up
your system on a CDROM but still want to allow local
&ldquo;ephemeral&rdquo; changes that are discarded when the system
reboots.</dd>
</dl>
The solution is re-direction. Effectively you tell the processes,
&ldquo;Look behind you!&rdquo; and in-a-snap put a layer between
the process and the device. Activate the snapshot feature of the
device mapper with <code>modprobe dm-snapshot</code> if necessary.

<p>Let us start then with a device which is managed by the device
mapper. For example it could be created by</p>

<pre class="code">
    SIZE1=$(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1)
    SIZE2=$(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop2)
    cat &gt; /tmp/table2 &lt;&lt;EOF
    0 $SIZE1 linear /dev/loop1 0
    $SIZE1 $SIZE2 linear /dev/loop2 0
    EOF
    dmsetup create base /tmp/table2
</pre>
Now assume that you have put a file system on this device with a
command like <code>mke2fs /dev/mapper/base</code>; and suppose you
have begun using this file system at <code>/mnt</code> with the
command <code>mount /dev/mapper/base /mnt</code>.

<p>We will now take a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; of this file-system -
in slow motion! The following steps have to be run quite quickly
(say with a script) on a running system where this file-system is
being changed actively.</p>

<p>First of all you create a duplicate of this device. This is not
just for safety - we will be changing the meaning of
<code>/dev/mapper/base</code> without telling the file-system!</p>

<pre>
    dmsetup table base | dmsetup create basedup
</pre>
Next we prepare our COW (copy-on-write) block device by making sure
the first 8 (or whatever you decide is your chunk size) sectors are
zeroed.

<pre>
    CHUNK=8
    dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/loop3 bs=512 count=$CHUNK
</pre>
Now we suspend all I/O (reads/writes) to the <code>base</code>
device. This is the critical step for a running system. The kernel
will have to put to sleep all processes that attempt to read from
or write to this device; so we want to be sure we can resume soon.

<pre>
    dmsetup suspend base &amp;&amp; TIME=$(date)
</pre>
The next step is to use the COW to clone the device:

<pre class="code">
    echo 0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/mapper/basedup) \
        snapshot /dev/mapper/basedup /dev/loop3 p 8 | \
        dmsetup create top
</pre>
What this says is that from now on reading from
<code>/dev/mapper/top</code> will return the data from
<code>/dev/mapper/basedup</code> <em>unless</em> you write
&ldquo;on top&rdquo; of the original data. Writes to
<code>top</code> will actually be written on
<code>/dev/loop3</code> in chunks of size 8 sectors. If you have
used multiple transparent plastic sheets one on top of the other
(or &ldquo;Layers&rdquo; in GIMP) the effect is similar - what is
written on top obscures what is below but wherever nothing is
written on top you see clearly what is written on the lower layer.

<p>In particular, we can now make sure that all changes to the
underlying block devices are &ldquo;volatile.&rdquo; If we execute
the following commands (we'll bookmark this as <a name="point_A"
id="point_A">'<strong>Point A</strong>'</a> for later use) -</p>

<pre>
    dmsetup table top | dmsetup load base
    dmsetup resume base
</pre>
we will have replaced the file-system under <code>/mnt</code> with
another one where all changes actually go to
<code>/dev/loop3</code>. When we dismantle this setup,
<code>/dev/loop1</code> and <code>/dev/loop2</code> will be in
<em>exactly</em> the state that they were in at time
<code>$TIME</code>.

<p>If <code>/dev/loop1</code> and <code>/dev/loop2</code> are on
non-writable physical media (such as a CDROM), whereas
<code>/dev/loop3</code> is on a writable one (such as RAM or hard
disk), then we have created a writable file-system out of a
read-only one!</p>

<p>This solves the last problem in our list above - but what about
the first two? To tackle the second problem we must have some way
of comparing the new file-system with the older one. If you try to
mount <code>/dev/mapper/basedup</code> somewhere in order to this,
you will find that Linux (the kernel!) refuses to let you do this.
Instead we can create yet another device:</p>

<pre class="code">
    echo 0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/mapper/basedup) \
        snapshot-origin /dev/mapper/basedup | \
        dmsetup create origin
</pre>
You can now mount <code>/dev/mapper/origin</code> somewhere (say
<code>/tmp/orig</code>) and compare the original file system with
the current one with a command like

<pre>
    diff -qur /tmp/orig /mnt
</pre>
What happens if you write to <code>/tmp/orig</code>? Check it out
and you'll be mystified for a moment.

<p>The analogy of plastic sheets breaks down here! All writes to
<code>/tmp/orig</code> go directly to the underlying device
<code>basedup</code> but are <em>negated</em> on
<code>/dev/loop3</code> so as to become invisible to reads from
<code>/mnt</code>. Similarly, reads from <code>/tmp/orig</code>
ignore whatever changes were made by writing to <code>/mnt</code>.
In other words the original file system has been <em>forked</em>
(and orthogonally at that!) and <code>/dev/loop3</code> actually
stores both negative and positive data in order to achieve this. No
plastic sheet can be made to work like this!</p>

<p>To see why this is useful, let us see how it solves the problem
of backups. What we want is to get a &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo; view of
the file-system but we want to continue using the <em>original</em>
system. So in this case we should <em>not</em> run the commands at
<a href="#point_A">point A</a> above. Instead we run the commands
here, at <a name="point_B" id="point_B"><strong>point
B</strong></a>:</p>

<pre>
    dmsetup table origin | dmsetup load base
    dmsetup resume base
</pre>
Now all writes to <code>/mnt</code> will go onto the original
device, but these changes are negated on
<code>/dev/mapper/top</code>. So if we mount the latter device at
(say) <code>/tmp/snap</code>, then we can read a snapshot of the
files at time <code>$TIME</code> from this directory. A command
like

<pre class="code">
    cd /tmp/snap
    find . -xdev | cpio -o -H new &gt; "backup-at-$TIME"
</pre>
will provide a snapshot backup of the file-system at time
<code>$TIME</code>.

<p>We could also have taken such a snapshot at <a href=
"#point_A">Point A</a> with the commands</p>

<pre class="code">
    cd /tmp/orig
    find . -xdev | cpio -o -H new &gt; "backup-at-$TIME"
</pre>
The main difference is that the changes to
<code>/dev/mapper/top</code> are volatile! There is no way to
easily dismantle the structure created under (A) without losing all
the changes made. In the backup context you <em>want</em> to retain
the changes; at <a href="#point_B">Point B</a> you run

<pre>
    dmsetup suspend base
    dmsetup remove top
    dmsetup remove origin
    dmsetup table basedup | dmsetup load base
    dmsetup resume base
</pre>
and you are back to business as usual. If you were to run this at
<a href="#point_A">Point A</a> the results would be quite
unpredictable! What would be the status of all those open files on
<code>/dev/mapper/top</code>? A number of hung processes would be
the most likely outcome - even some kernel threads could hang - and
then perhaps break!

<h3>For Your Eyes Only</h3>

<p>Say you have a laptop or CD which carries some valuable data -
valuable not just to you but to anyone who has it. (When, Oh! When
will <em>I</em> ever get my hands on such data). In this case
backups are no good. What you want is to protect this data from
theft. Assuming you believe in the strength of current encryption
techniques you could protect it by encrypting the relevant file.
This approach has some serious problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>The file must be de/re-encrypted every time you want to use
it.</li>

<li>The encrypted file is pin-pointed, thus narrowing down the
search for anyone wanting to steal your stuff.</li>

<li>You may not know precisely which files contain secret stuff.
For example you prepare a secret report and send it to the printer.
Unbeknownst to you a temporary PDF file was created for this purpose
and you didn't encrypt that.</li>
</ul>
For these and a possible host of other reasons you may want to
encrypt the entire block device. The device mapper offers a way to
do this. Activate the encryption service of the device mapper with
<code>modprobe dm-crypt</code> if necessary. Also activate some
encryption and hashing mechanism by commands like <code>modprobe
md5</code> and <code>modprobe aes</code> if necessary.

<p>First of all you need to generate and store your secret key. If
you use AES as indicated above then you can use a key of length
up to 32 bytes which can be generated by a command like</p>

<pre class="code">
    dd if=/dev/random bs=16 count=1 | \
      od --width=16 -t x2 | head -1 | \
      cut -f2- -d' ' | tr -d ' ' &gt; /tmp/my_secret_key
</pre>
Of course, you should probably not output your secret key to such a
file - there <em>are</em> safer ways of storing it:

<ul>
<li>Output it directly to the screen and memorize it! It's only 32
characters after all!</li>

<li>Write it to a USB stick or some such device which
<em>never</em> leaves your pocket.</li>

<li>Encrypt it using <code>gpg</code> or <code>openssl</code> and
then store it on a the USB stick or a device that never leaves
you.</li>
</ul>
If you use the third option you will need to use a passphrase - you
must remember this passphrase as well. One way to do that is to use
this passphrase often - use it... or lose it!

<p>You can now setup the encrypted device</p>

<pre class="code">
    echo 0 $(blockdev --getsize /dev/loop1) \
      crypt aes-plain $(cat /tmp/my_secret_key) 0 /dev/loop1 0 | \
      dmsetup create mydata
</pre>
You can then make a file-system <code>mke2fs
/dev/mapper/mydata</code> on this block device and store data on it
after mounting it somewhere with <code>mount /dev/mapper/mydata
/mnt</code>. All the data written to <code>/mnt</code> will then be
transparently encrypted before storing it in
<code>/dev/loop1</code>. When you are through you unmount the
device and dismantle it as before:

<pre>
    umount /mnt
    dmsetup remove mydata
</pre>
The next time you want to use the device you can set it up with the
same command as above (providing you supply the secret key in
<code>/tmp/my_secret_key</code>). Of course, you shouldn't rune
<code>mke2fs</code> on the device a second time unless you want to
erase all that valuable data!

<h3>Getting To The Root Of The Problem</h3>

<p>All the steps given above can be carried out on any block
device(s) in place of the loop devices that were used. However,
when the block device is the root device then life gets a little
more complex. (Roots generally <em>are</em> complex).</p>

<p>First of all we need to put the root device under the control of
the device mapper; this is best done with an initial RAM disk (or
<code>initrd</code>). Even after this is done, we need to be
careful if we are trying to run some of the above commands for the
root file system on a &ldquo;live&rdquo; system. In particular, it
is not advisable to suspend I/O on the root file system without
deep introspection! After all this means that all processes that
make a read/write call to the root file system will be put to
sleep.</p>

<p>Here is one way around the problem. Create a temporary file
system</p>

<pre>
    mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /mnt
</pre>
To this file system copy all the files that are necessary in order
to perform the changes - in particular, you need
<code>/sbin/dmsetup</code>, <code>/bin/sh</code>, the
<code>/dev</code> files and all shared libraries that these
programs depend on. Then you run <code>chroot /mnt</code>. After
this you <em>can</em> run a script or (if you type quickly and
without errors!) a sequence of commands that will suspend the root
device map and make relevant changes to it - for example, to take a
snapshot. Don't forget to resume the root device before exiting the
<code>chroot</code>.

<h3>After word</h3>

<p>Given the complexity of the various operations, it is probably
best to produce a shell script or even a C program that carries out
the tasks. Luckily, the latter has already been implemented - the
<a href="http://sourceware.org/lvm2/">Linux Logical Volume Manager
version 2</a> does carry out most of the tasks described above
quite &ldquo;automagically.&rdquo; Setup and use of encryption is
greatly simplified by the <a href=
"http://www.saout.de/misc/dm-crypt/"><tt>cryptsetup</tt></a>
program. Why then did I write this article?</p>

<p>I originally came upon <a href=
"ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/dm/"><tt>dmsetup</tt></a> while
trying to create a read-only root file system for a
&ldquo;live&rdquo; CDROM. Unfortunately, the LVM2 tools are not
useful as they only look at the use of snapshots for backups -
clearly they don't care for COWs! The only resource that I found
for this was the <a href=
"https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2004-July/msg00071.html">RedHat
Mailing list</a> archives. There are now tools which come with live
CD's that make use of <code>dmsetup</code>; for example I came
across <a href=
"http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/LiveCDPersistence">this link</a>
which explains how UBuntu does it.</p>

<p>Of course, using <code>dmsetup</code> allowed me to get as
&ldquo;close to the metal&rdquo; as is possible without writing
real programs...</p>

(once again) of actually writing code. In eternal gratitude he has spent
a lot of time tinkering with and promoting Linux and GNU since those

<h1>Lock It Down With Arno's iptables-firewall</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/keeling.html">S. Keeling</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>This describes my experiences in transitioning from a homebuilt iptables
firewall script<a href="#ii"><sup>ii</sup></a> to &quot;Arno's iptables-firewall&quot; (AIF)<a href="#v"><sup>v</sup></a>, from
Arno van Amersfoort (<img src="misc/keeling/arnova.png">).  AIF can produce
a robust iptables based firewall, even when wielded by a relative newcomer
to iptables firewalls.  The time between reading the documentation and
dropping it into place could be as little as an hour.

<h3>Caveats</h3>

<p>AIF is described in Arno's README as &quot;Arno's iptables firewall
- Single- &amp; multi-homed firewall script with DSL/ADSL
support&quot;.  It is (C) Copyright 2001-2005 by Arno van Amersfoort.
It's free software, licenced under the GNU General Public License.

<p>If you decide you want to try using this, I <b>strongly</b>
recommend you READ THE FAQ on Arno's website, especially if you join
the mailing list in hope of support.  Arno points out in there that if
you haven't done so, your pleas for assistance will be cheerfully
ignored until you do.

<p>Of course, considering this is the Twenty-first Century:

<pre class="code">
  I AM NOT ADVISING YOU TO DO THIS!  IF YOU DO THIS AND IT BREAKS
  SOMETHING, YOU GET TO KEEP BOTH PIECES.  I EXPRESSLY, AND
  VIGOROUSLY, DENY ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY NEGATIVE RESULTS YOU OR
  ANYONE ELSE MAY SUFFER FROM YOUR HAVING DONE THIS.  THE FOLLOWING IS
  WRITTEN FOR ITS ENTERTAINMENT VALUE ONLY!  TELL YOUR MOTHER YOU'RE
  ABOUT TO DO THIS PRIOR TO DOING IT. 
</pre>

<p>[fscking lawyers (no, that's not a typo)...  Sorry for shouting.]

<p><b>When I started writing this, I was working with version
1.8.2</b>, which is apparently over a year old.  At Arno's suggestion,
I've since upgraded to the latest release, version 1.8.3-RC3 (April 9,
2005).  So, if I've missed anything important in updating this, that's
why it may appear confused.  Certain example listings were left alone,
but I've tried to cover the important bits of the latest version.

<p>Some of Arno's comments on my original article are as follows:

<em>
<pre class="code">
   Thanks for the article. I like it a lot.
   
   May I suggest to have a look at the latest 1.8.3RC3 (instead of 1.8.2a
   stable, which is over 1 year old)? It has a lot (and I mean A LOT)
   [of] improvements like:
<ul>
  <li>80-character long README &amp; config file (one of your bothers).
    Furthermore the config file layout is improved a lot. 
  <li>DMZ support (ie. to shield WiFi nets).
  <li>Multiple external (internet) interfaces.
  <li>Multiroute NAT (for load balancing internet connections).
  <li>MAC address filtering.
  <li>Full (transparent) proxy support.
  <li>The execute bit isn't set anymore on this version's config file
    either. ;-)
  <li><strong>...and...</strong>
  <li>version <code>1.8.4-stable</code>, with even more improvements, will
  be out soon.
</ul>
</pre>
</em>

<p>Nice guy, that Arno.  When I started on this, I (mis)corrected his
usage of &quot;DRDOS&quot; to &quot;DDoS&quot; (or &quot;Distributed
Denial of Service&quot;<a href="#xi"><sup>xi</sup></a>), and that was the wrong thing to do.  He
actually means &quot;Distributed Reflection Denial Of Service&quot;,
something I'd never heard of. I took his advice. For me, just
getting config files with eighty character long lines is a terrific
improvement.

<p><b>Many thanks to the helpful and patient staff at LG</b> for all
their support in producing this article, and the same to Arno van
Amersfoort for having made any of it possible.

<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>My situation is this (which is not to suggest you need to be doing
something similar):

  <ul>

    <li>I run a personal workstation (laptop) with Debian
    &quot;stable&quot;<a href="#ix"><sup>ix</sup></a> loaded on it.</li>

    <li>The lion's share of my connectivity is done via dialup, connected
    to my ISP.</li>

    <li>I do connect up to other machines locally (friends, work, family),
    via ethernet (and a four-port hub or crossover cable).</li>

    <li>I prefer to remove firewall functionality (take it down) when no
    interfaces are up.  Similarly, I see no point in starting the
    firewall at boot time when there's no interfaces up.  I like my
    firewall to be started either when pppd starts, or when ethN is
    configured.  When they're taken down, the firewall should go
    down.</li>

    <li>I run some local services which traditionally would be exploited by
    black hats:

    <ul>

      <li>identd: fauxident.py<a href="#iii"><sup>iii</sup></a> produces just enough identd-ish
        information to placate the CVS servers I've dealt with.</li>

      <li>MaraDNS<a href="#iv"><sup>iv</sup></a>: A caching-only nameserver.</li>

      <li>ssh: When connecting locally to other machines, I allow sshd
        to run, accepting logins.</li>

      <li>email: Popped by fetchmail.  Outgoing is via exim.</li>

      <li>chrony: An NTP daemon which connects up to [012].pool.ntp.org
        to manage system time.</li>

    </ul>

  </ul>

<p>Previously, I'd used a handcrafted set of iptables commands which
pretty much ruthlessly, and blindly, locked everything out through
sheer brute force.  Anything the firewall saw that wasn't connected to
an ESTABLISHED or RELATED IP process previously initiated by my
actions, was simply logged and dropped.

<p>This is generally not difficult to do, but at times, it is.  How to
let NTP servers' replies back in?  I struggled with that for months.
Googling for help on that produced so many conflicting examples (some
of which worked, some not), it was infuriating.  I was always on the
lookout for an alternative.  I wanted something somewhat like my
existing setup, but more robust, more suspicious, more dynamic, and
smarter overall about networking than I am.

<p>Over the years, I've tried things others suggested, but they always
seemed a bit wrong.  I don't want the thing to fire up an X Window GUI
forcing me to point and click my way through the configuration.  If I
<em>already</em> knew everything there was to know about TCP/IP and
networking, that might be helpful, but I don't.  Besides, that's just
not how I do things.  I want something with few moving parts, all of
which have their own home directories, and which can be expected to
stay there.  I don't want the thing to fail some morning because
somebody changed some obscure library I'd never heard of<a href="#vi"><sup>vi</sup></a>.

<p>On &quot;Sun Jan 9 12:18:45 MST 2005&quot;<a href="#i"><sup>i</sup></a>, I found mention of
&quot;Arno's iptables-firewall&quot; (AIF).  Now that I've finally
taken some time to get it working and try it out, I'm happy to say
it appears to be just what I was looking for.  Arno's system is
intended for far more complicated setups than my own (for instance, it
supports NAT and VPNs), but it easily scales down to my needs.  It
thinks of an external (connected to the internet) and an internal
(LAN) interface.  In fact, the latest release has been updated to
handle multiple external interfaces.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>It's not difficult.  You should be able to get the mechanics of
this done in half an hour, depending on how careful you want to be.
Budget an hour for the job since there's some reading to do beforehand.

<p>Go to his download page and grab it.  It's ~54 kilobytes.  It'll be in
the form of a tarball (gzipped tar archive).  <code>cd</code> to somewhere
safe, make a new directory to hold it, and extract it:

<pre class="code">
   cd
   mkdir ~/dwn
   cd ~/dwn
   tar xzf /path/to/arno-iptables-firewall-1.8.3-rc3.tgz
</pre>

<p>That creates a new directory, ~/dwn/arno-iptables-firewall-1.8.3-RC3:

</pre>

<p>They're all flat ASCII text files.  Now, read the README.  It
starts out by mentioning it's free software, licenced under the GNU
General Public License.  It goes on to explain what the various files
are for.  One of the most welcome things to me in the latest version
is Arno has chopped the line length in most of his stuff to a much
more readable eighty characters or so.  He appears to like lines that
are about a hundred characters long, and displaying them in an eighty
character wide xterm (or console) made them very difficult to read.
Mostly, that's no longer a problem.  You'll still see remnants of
this, in his actual firewall script for example.

<p>Following the file descriptions, he lists &quot;Some IMPORTANT
(security) information&quot;.  Following that is a &quot;Quick
setup&quot; section, a section on WHAT TO DO IN THE CONFIG FILE, and
some info you may need in rebuilding your kernel if it doesn't already
have iptables support (:-O really?!?  I haven't seen any distributions
supplying pre-compiled kernels without iptables support, or maybe this
is in case you're having trouble rolling your own...  I'll have to go
back and re-read that bit sometime).

<p>The old version flatly refused to work if you were using a 2.2.x
kernel and ipchains.  The latest version detects 2.2.x and ipchains
and continues (I haven't tested this).

<p>The README used to suggest installation instructions you might use,
but perhaps he's blended those into the other sections?  I notice
there's also a bit at the top of the firewall script itself.  However,
I suggest you use common sense and figure out how you need it done for
your system.  They're just a couple of scripts and config files.  How
difficult can it be?  :-)

<p>On the other hand...


<h3>What I Did - Configuration</h3>

<p>As root:

<pre class="code">
   $ cp rc.iptables /etc/init.d
   $ vi /etc/init.d/rc.iptables
</pre>

<p>A few lines into the file, you'll see CONFIG_FILE.  Change that to
say:

<pre class="code">
   CONFIG_FILE=/etc/firewall/iptables-firewall.conf
</pre>

<p>Now make it executable (Arno suggests this should be 700; you decide):

<pre class="code">
   $ chmod 744 /etc/init.d/rc.iptables
</pre>

<p>If necessary:

<pre class="code">
   $ chown root:root /etc/init.d/rc.iptables
</pre>

<p>Now make a home for the config file(s):

<pre class="code">
   $ mkdir /etc/firewall
   $ chmod 755 /etc/firewall
   $ cp iptables-firewall.conf /etc/firewall
   $ chmod 600 /etc/firewall/iptables-firewall.conf
   $ vi /etc/firewall/iptables-firewall.conf
</pre>

<p>If you're going to use them, you now want to create
iptables-blocked-hosts, iptables-custom-rules, and
iptables-mac-addresses (make sure those are the names mentioned, down
at the bottom, in the config file).  I notice they're commented out in
the latest version's config file.  These need to be at least one blank
line long, so vi them, insert a carriage return, save, and exit.

<p>Now go back to the top of iptables-firewall.conf, inserting the
important stuff telling AIF how it should do things for your system.
This part gets a little hairy, so you might like to peruse the mailing
list archives to see if you can find explanations of how to do this
correctly.  The FAQ also mentions a few little syntactical nits that
it might help to know.  I went with Arno's suggestion and changed as
little as I could.  There are lots of comments explaining what things
do and when you might want to use them.

<p><b>Yes, that is a little vague.</b> Sorry, but this bit is the
so-called kernel of what you need to learn about iptables for AIF to
work for you the way you want it to work.  What is it you want to do,
and what is there that you have to work with?  DSL/ADSL?  Dialup ppp?
WiFi from a broadband modem?  What ports do you want to open up to the
crackers?  Do you know what you're doing with iptables, or are you a
dilettante like me?

<p>You do want to tell it what your external interface is:

<pre class="code">
   EXT_IF=&quot;ppp+&quot;
</pre>

in my case ("ppp+" covers ppp0, ppp1, ppp2, etc.)  Then:

<pre class="code">
   INT_IF=&quot;eth0&quot;
</pre>

takes care of my NIC along with:

<pre class="code">
   INTERNAL_NET=&quot;192.168.1.0/24&quot;
</pre>

<p>One of the things mentioned in the FAQ is you don't want or need
&quot;127.0.0.1&quot; (the loopback interface) mentioned anywhere.
&quot;Ah, so I guess I don't need to do anything about my caching
nameserver?  Uhh...&quot; Well, the MaraDNS man page has a good
section on this. Later.

<p>Also, you might like to take my chmod commands above with a grain
of salt.  I don't see a great deal of point in locking things down so
group and other can't read them.  However, that is how Arno suggests
they be.  You make up your own mind.  To me, if a config file doesn't
contain any sensitive information, it's a little silly to make it
owner:group read-only.


<h3>What I Did - Implementation</h3>

<p>Once you've solved the config file problem, you then need to figure
out how you want it executed.  If you want it to come up at boot time,
you'll need init script links in /etc/rcN.d directories.  Arno
mentions how to do this at the top of the firewall script itself.  You
can do it by hand, but most distributions have some sort of tool you
can use to manage those links.

<p>For my purposes, I wanted it controlled by interface
initialization, and that fits well with Debian's /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/
system.  Any script in that directory will be run when the interface
is brought on line and configured.  There's also /etc/ppp/ip-down.d/
which works similarly in reverse.

<p>Now, take a look in /etc/network.  Just like ppp, there are if-up.d
&quot;-ish&quot; (among others) directories in there too.

<p>In my case, I created the script /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00iptables_firewall.
It needs only two lines: the &quot;shebang&quot;, and a line to call
rc.iptables:

<pre class="code">
   #!/bin/sh
   /etc/init.d/rc.iptables start
</pre>

<p>Now, &quot;chmod 744 /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00iptables_firewall&quot;.
Similarly, you need a script in /etc/ppp/ip-down.d that will take the
firewall down when the interface goes down:

<pre class="code">
   #!/bin/sh
   # if [ ! &quot;$(/sbin/ifconfig | /bin/grep eth0)&quot; ]; then
      /etc/init.d/rc.iptables stop
   # fi
</pre>

<p>Notice the commented out lines.  When I started on this, that did a
sanity check first: if, by chance, I happen to have both ppp0 and ethN
up and connected, it would be a little silly to take down the firewall
if only one of the interfaces was being taken down.  However, now that
I think about it, that might be a little dumb.  I'm still re-thinking
that bit.

<p>Make sure that file's executable too.

<p>The last thing you <b>might want</b> to do is tweak
/etc/syslog.conf to tell syslogd to send firewall related messages to
/var/log/firewall.  In the latest version, this is optional.  Arno was
kind enough to include a couple of examples of syslog.conf that you
can work with.  I just did this: look for the first instance of
&quot;kern.*&quot; and change that to &quot;kern.!=debug&quot;, then
add a new line that points kern.=debug at /var/log/firewall.  Now, I
have:

<pre>
   auth,authpriv.*                 /var/log/auth.log
   *.*;auth,authpriv.none          -/var/log/syslog
   #cron.*                         /var/log/cron.log
   daemon.*                        -/var/log/daemon.log
   kern.!=debug                    -/var/log/kern.log
   lpr.*                           -/var/log/lpr.log
   mail.*                          -/var/log/mail.log
   user.*                          -/var/log/user.log
   uucp.*                          /var/log/uucp.log

   # Logging for iptables
   kern.=debug                     -/var/log/firewall
</pre>

<p>Once you change /etc/syslog.conf, you need to touch the new logfile
(<b>only do this if it doesn't already exist</b>):

<pre class="code">
   $ touch /var/log/firewall
</pre>

<p>and you need to cycle syslogd to make it re-read its config file:

<pre class="code">
   $ kill -HUP $(pidof syslogd)
</pre>

<p>If you don't have &quot;pidof&quot;, you'll have to determine
syslogd's PID and insert that there instead.  &quot;ps fax | grep
syslogd&quot; says this:

<pre>
   (0) keeling /home/keeling_ ps fax | grep syslogd
     242 ?        S      0:00 /sbin/syslogd
   30307 pts/2    S      0:00          |       \_ grep syslogd
</pre>

<p>so you need to say &quot;kill -HUP 242&quot;

<p><b>If you've done the syslog.conf fiddle,</b> make sure you've set
&quot;FIREWALL_LOG=/var/log/firewall&quot; and
&quot;LOGLEVEL=debug&quot; in /etc/firewall/iptables-firewall.conf.
Hopefully, you have logrotate on your system, else the log file will
just grow and grow, eventually filling your filesystem.

<p>This is &quot;/etc/logrotate.d/firewall&quot;:

<pre class="code">
   /var/log/firewall {
           rotate 7
           daily
           compress
           notifempty
           create 0640 root adm
           delaycompress
           create
   }
</pre>

<p>Now, you should be good to go.  I would suggest the first (few?)
time(s), you should run /etc/init.d/rc.iptables by hand (&quot;chmod
644 /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/00iptables_firewall&quot; first, bring up the
connection, then run &quot;/etc/init.d/rc.iptables start&quot;).  It
spits out quite a few messages mentioning what it's doing.  You should
peruse that output (see the example below), ensuring it's doing what
you want.  This is also when you'll get a chance to do something about
any errors found in the config file.  &quot;iptables -nL | less&quot;
will show the firewall rules.  &quot;tail -f /var/log/firewall&quot;
will show you the effect of those rules.

<p>If you can't figure out how to make AIF do something you did
before, Arno has thought about that and made exceptions possible.
Take the iptables rule you used before and stuff it into iptables-
custom-rules.  Of course, <b>be warned</b> that this may compromise
whatever AIF is attempting to do for you.  However, if you were doing
it before, you're probably no worse off now than you were.

<p>In my case, when I was using the older version, I had this in my
/etc/firewall/iptables-custom-rules to make chrony/NTP work:

<pre class="code">
   # man iptables says using a name that must be resolved via remote
   # DNS is a Really Bad Idea.  Sigh.
   # 
   iptables -t filter -I INPUT -s 0.pool.ntp.org -m tcp -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
   iptables -t filter -I INPUT -s 1.pool.ntp.org -m tcp -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
   iptables -t filter -I INPUT -s 2.pool.ntp.org -m tcp -p tcp --dport 123 -j ACCEPT
</pre>

<p>With the new version, however, I've commented those out and used
&quot;HOST_OPEN_TCP&quot; in the config file instead:

<pre class="code">
   HOST_OPEN_TCP=&quot;0.pool.ntp.org&gt;123 1.pool.ntp.org&gt;123 2.pool.ntp.org&gt;123&quot;
</pre>

<h3>AIF In Action</h3>

<p>Take a look at what it's doing.  Here's an example of rc.iptables
output:

   Apr 18 14:47:12 All firewall rules applied.
</pre>

<p>Woof!  You should see the &quot;iptables -nL&quot; output!  Some of
this stuff, I'd only vaguely heard of.  Take a gander into the
rc.iptables script itself to see all that it's doing.  First, the
&quot;Sanity checks&quot;, then it modprobes all the necessary kernel
modules (again, some of which I'd never heard of).  Arno's doing all
the obscure:

<pre class="code">
  echo ${some_integer} &gt; /proc/sys/net/blah/blah
</pre>

<p>that I've never managed to either take the time to understand or
find a decent reference for.  Finally, he defines various firewall
rulesets.

<p>One of the neat things about this is, instead of the fairly bland:

<pre>
   Mar 16 07:24:38 localhost kernel: IN=ppp0 OUT= MAC= \
      SRC=xxx.xxx.xx.xx DST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx LEN=48 TOS=0x00 \
      PREC=0x00 TTL=102 ID=59091 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=3946 DPT=6348 \
      WINDOW=64240 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0
</pre>

<p>I now see things like this:

<pre>
   Apr  6 12:41:06 localhost kernel: Connection attempt (UNPRIV): \
      IN=ppp0 OUT= MAC= SRC=xx.xxx.xxx.xxx DST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx LEN=48 \
      TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=109 ID=28712 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=4194 DPT=15118 \
      WINDOW=65535 RES=0x00 SYN URGP=0 
</pre>

<p>which is pretty slick.  It explains what it is it saw.
&quot;UNPRIV&quot; means the destination port (DPT) is higher than port
1024 (see /etc/services).

<p>Other interesting stuff:

<pre>
   Apr 18 20:22:42 localhost kernel: Possible DRDOS TCP attempt: \
      IN=ppp0 OUT= MAC= SRC=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx DST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xx \
      LEN=576 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=63 ID=48819 DF PROTO=TCP SPT=110 \
      DPT=4345 WINDOW=5840 RES=0x00 ACK URGP=0 
</pre>

<p>That came in on pop3/TCP (&quot;grep 110 /etc/services&quot;) looking
for some port I don't have (4345).

<p>Among the things you get in AIF, Arno includes
&quot;fwfilter&quot;, a shell script you can use to massage the
logfile entries.  I'm already running something else called
fwlogwatch<a href="#viii"><sup>viii</sup></a>, but I decided to try this anyway.  Arno supplies
instructions inside the script explaining how it's to be used.  I
created a short script in /etc/cron.daily/fwfilter:

<pre class="code">
   #! /bin/sh
   #
   #  /etc/cron.daily/fwfilter - arno's iptables-firewall activity
   #  monitoring script.
   # 

   FWFILTER=/path/to/arno's/fwfilter
   FWLOG=/var/log/firewall
   DAY=&quot;$(/bin/date '+%b %e' --date=yesterday)&quot;
   
   if [ -f &quot;${FWFILTER}&quot; -a -f &quot;${FWLOG}&quot; ]; then
      /bin/grep &quot;${DAY}&quot; ${FWLOG} | ${FWFILTER}
   fi
</pre>

<p>When the system runs its daily cron jobs, this slurps in the
firewall log looking for entries from yesterday, pipes them through to
Arno's fwfilter script, and the output is mailed to root.  The result
is quite pretty and informative.  <b>Log file entries are colorized by
type.</b> The mutt mail program can show ANSI escape sequence color
with &quot;set allow_ansi=yes&quot;, but you really ought to see the
output in (eg.) rxvt or xterm.

<p>Note, depending on your installed version of awk, you may need to
fiddle with the fwfilter script prior to using it.  See the variable
&quot;AWK_BIN&quot;.  If &quot;which awk&quot; (or better, &quot;dpkg
-l | grep awk&quot;, or &quot;rpm -qf $(which awk)&quot;) mentions
&quot;mawk&quot;, you'll need to install gawk for fwfilter to work.

<h3>D'enouement</h3>

<p>I think it was a success.  I haven't lost anything, other than a
little time.  All the things I could do before, I can still do now.  I
see log records of other, more esoteric events, that I hadn't noticed
before.  That's the sort of thing I do want to hear about.

<p>I've since had the chance to drop this into the computer I'm
rebuilding for a friend as well.  It's worked pretty well, hasn't
interfered with the two computers' ability to communicate with each
other, and was easy to implement.  So far, I've nothing but praise for
AIF.  It's just what I've been hunting for for a long time.

<p>Arno's system is easy to use, can probably scale to fit any
situation, and can do it in the hands of a relative newcomer to
firewalls.  If you can read, you can benefit from Arno's firewall.

<p>If you do try this, and you like it as much as I do, take his
advice in the README and donate to his favourite charities.

<p><b>Rock on, Arno.  Bravo.  Thank you very much!</b>

<p> In 1990, after about a decade of processing seismic data (first as a
computer operator, then as geophysical technician), I sat down to my first
personal computer and started teaching myself how to program in C. After a

esthetically pleasing career, so I signed up for a programming course.  I
graduated with an A average.

<h3>The Deep, Dark Secrets of Bash</h3>
Deep within the "bash" man page lurk terrible things, not to be
approached by the timid or the inexperienced... Beware, Pilgrim:
the last incautious spelunker into these mysterious regions was
found, weeks later, muttering some sort of strange incantations
that sounded like "nullglob", "dotglob", and
<code>MAILPATH='/usr/spool/mail/bfox?"You have mail":~/shell-mail?"$_ has
mail!"'</code>
<p> (He was immediately hired by an Unnamed Company in Silicon Valley
for an unstated (but huge) salary... but that's beside the point.)

<p>&lt;Shrug&gt; What the heck; I've already gone parasailing and
scuba-diving this month (and will shortly be taking off on a
500-mile sail up the Gulf Stream); let's keep living <em>La Vida
Loca</em>!</p>

<h3>Parameter Expansion</h3>

<p>The built-in parsing capabilities of "bash" are rather minimal
as compared to, say, Perl or AWK; in my best estimate, they're not
intended for serious processing, just "quick and dirty" minor-task
handling. Nevertheless, they can be very handy for that
purpose.</p>

<p>As an example, let's say that you need to differentiate between
lowercase and capitalized filenames in processing a directory - I
ended up doing that with my backgrounds for X, since some of them
look best tiled, and others stretched to full-screen size (file
size wasn't quite a good-enough guide). I "capped" all the names of
the full-sized pics, and "decapped" all the tiles. Then, as part of
my random background selector, "bkgr", I wrote the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
...

# We need _just_ the filename
fn=$(basename $fnm)

# Set the "-max" switch if the test returns 'true'
[ -z "${fn##[A-Z]*}" ] &amp;&amp; MAX="-max"

# Run "xv" with|without the "-max" option based on the test result
xv -root -quit $MAX $fnm &amp;

...
</pre>

<p>Confusing-looking stuff, isn't it? Well, part of it we already
know: the <code>[ -z ... ]</code> is a test for a zero-length
string. What about the other part, though?</p>

<p>In order to 'protect' our parameter expansion result from the
cold, cruel world (e.g., if you wanted to use the result as part of
a filename, you'd need the 'protection' to keep it separate from
the trailing characters), we use curly brackets to surround the
whole enchilada -</p>

<p><code>$d</code> is the same as<code>${d}</code> - except that
the second variety can be combined with other things without losing
its identity, like so:</p>

<pre class="code">
...
d=Digit

# "Digitize"
echo ${d}ize

# "Digital"
echo ${d}al

# "Digits"
echo ${d}s

# "Digitalis"
echo ${d}alis
...
</pre>

<p>Now that we have it isolated from the world, friendless and all
alone... oops, sorry - that's "<em>shell</em> script", not
"<em>horror movie</em> script" - I lose track once in a while...
Anyway, now that we've separated the variable out via the curly
braces, we can apply a few tools incorporated in Bash to perform
some basic parsing. Note that I'm going to show the result after
each 'echo' statement as if that statement had been executed.</p>

### ${#var} - return length
echo ${#var}
10

### ${var#word} - cut shortest match from start
echo ${var#*n}
uensis

### ${var##word} - cut longest match from start
echo ${var##*n}
sis

### ${var%word} - cut shortest match from end
echo ${var%n*}
amanue

### ${var%%word} - cut longest match from end
echo ${var%%n*}
ama

### ${var:offset} - return string starting at 'offset'
echo ${var:7}
sis

### ${var:offset:length} - return 'length' characters starting at 'offset'
echo ${var:1:3}
man

### ${var/pattern/string} - replace single match
echo ${var/amanuen/paralip}
paralipsis

### ${var//pattern/string} - replace all matches
echo ${var//a/A}
AmAnuensis
</pre>

<p>(For the last two operations, if the pattern begins with #, it
will match at the beginning of the string; if it begins with %, it
will match at the end. If the string is empty, matches will be
deleted.)</p>

<p>There's actually a bit more to it - things like variable
indirection, and parsing arrays - but, gee, I guess you'll just
have to study that man page yourself. &lt;grin&gt; Just consider
this as motivational material.</p>

<p>So, now that we've looked at the tools, let's look back at the
code -<code>[ -z "${fn##[A-Z]*}" ]</code> Not all <em>that</em>
difficult anymore, is it? Or maybe it is; my thought process, in
dealing with searches and matches, tends to resemble
pretzel-bending. What I did here - and it could be done in a number
of other ways, given the above tools - is match for a max-length
string (i.e., the entire filename) that begins with an uppercase
character. The <code>[ -z ... ]</code> returns 'true' if the
resulting string is zero-length (i.e., matches the [A-Z]* pattern),
and $MAX is set to "-max".</p>

<p>Note that, since we're matching the entire string,
<code>${fn%%[A-Z]*}</code> would work just as well. If that seems
confusing - if <em>all</em> of the above seems confusing - I
suggest lots and lots of experimentation to familiarize yourself
with it. It's easy: set a parameter value, and experiment, like so
-</p>

<pre class="code">
Odin:~$ experiment=supercallifragilisticexpialadocious
Odin:~$ echo ${experiment%l*}
supercallifragilisticexpia
Odin:~$ echo ${experiment%%l*}
superca
Odin:~$ echo ${experiment#*l}
lifragilisticexpialadocious
Odin:~$ echo ${experiment##*l}
adocious
</pre>
...and so on. It's the best way to get a feel for what a certain
tool does; pick it up, plug it in, put on your safety glasses and
gently squuueeeze the trigger. Observe all safety precautions as
random deletion of valuable data may occur. Actual results may vary
and <strong>will</strong> often surprise you.

<h3>Parameter State</h3>
There are times - say, in testing for a range of error conditions
that set different variables - when we need to know whether a
specific variable is set (has been assigned a value) or not. True,
we could test it for length, as I did above, but the utilities
provided by "bash" for the purpose provide convenient shortcuts for
such occasions.

<pre class="code">
joe=

### ${parameter:-word} - If parameter is unset, substitute "word"
echo ${joe:-mary}
mary
echo $joe

### ${parameter:?word} - Display "word" or error if parameter is unset
echo ${joe:?"Not set"}
bash: joe: Not set
echo ${joe:?}
bash: joe: parameter null or not set

### ${parameter:=word} - If parameter is unset, set it to "word"
echo ${joe:=mary}
mary
echo $joe
mary

### ${parameter:+word} - "word" is substituted only if parameter <em>is</em> set
echo ${joe:+blahblah}
blahblah
</pre>

<h3>Array Handling</h3>
Another built-in capability of "bash", a basic mechanism for
handling <em>arrays</em>, allows us to process data that needs to
be indexed, or at least kept in a structure that allows individual
addressing of each of its members. Consider the following scenario:
if I have a phonebook/address list, and want to send my latest
"Sailor's Newsletter" to everyone in the "Friends" category, how do
I do it? Furthermore, say that I also want to create a list of
names of the people I sent it to, or do some other processing...
i.e., it becomes necessary to split it up into fields by length -
and arrays become one of the very few viable options.

<p>Let's look at what this might involve. Here's a clip of a
notional phonebook to be used for the job:</p>

<table border="0" width="700">
<tr>
<td><strong>Name</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>Category</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>Address</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>Email</strong>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Jim &amp; Fanny Friends</td>
<td>Business</td>
<td>101101 Digital Dr. LA CA</td>
<td>fr@gnarly.com</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Fred &amp; Wilma Rocks</td>
<td>friends</td>
<td>12 Cave St. Granite, CT</td>
<td>shale@hill.com</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Joe 'Da Fingers' Lucci</td>
<td>Business</td>
<td>45 Caliber Av. B-klyn NY</td>
<td>tuff@ny.org</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yoda Leahy-Hu</td>
<td>Friend</td>
<td>1 Peak Fribourg Switz</td>
<td>warble@sing.ch</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Cyndi, Wendi, &amp; Myndi</td>
<td>Friends</td>
<td>5-X Rated St. Holiday FL</td>
<td>3cuties@fl.net</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Whew. This stuff obviously needs to be read in by fields - word
counting won't do; neither will a text search. Arrays to the
rescue!</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
# 'nlmail' sends the monthly newsletter to friends listed
# in the phonebook

# "bash" would create the arrays automatically, since we'll
# use the 'name[subscript]' syntax to load the variables -
# but I happen to like explicit declarations.

declare -a name category address email

# A little Deep Hackery to make the 'for' loop read a line at a time
OLD=$IFS
IFS='
'
for line in $(cat phonelist)
do
    # Increment the line counter
    ((x++))

    # Load up the 'name' variable
    name[$x]="${line:0:25}"
    
    # etc. for 'category',
    category[$x]="${line:25:10}"
    
    # etc. for 'address',
    address[$x]="${line:35:25}"
    
    # etc. for 'email'...
    email[$x]="${line:60:20}"
done

# Undo the line-parsing magic
IFS=$OLD

...
</pre>
At this point, we have the "phonelist" file loaded into the four
arrays that we've created, ready for further processing. Each of
the fields is easily addressable, thus making the stated problem -
that of e-mailing a given file to all my friends - a trivial one
(this snippet is a continuation of the previous script):

<pre class="code">
...
for y in $(seq $x)
do
    # We'll look for the word "friend" in the 'category' field,
    # make it "case-blind", and clip any trailing characters.
    if [ -z "${category[$y]##[Ff]riend*}" ]
    then
        mutt -a Newsletter.pdf -s 'S/V Ulysses News, 6/2000' ${email[$y]}
        echo "Mail sent to ${name[$y]}" &gt;&gt; sent_list.txt
    fi
done
</pre>
That should do it, as well as pasting the recipients' names into a
file called "sent_list.txt" - a nice double-check feature that lets
me see if I missed anyone.

<p>The array processing capabilities of "bash" extend a bit beyond
this simple example. Suffice it to say that for simple cases of
this sort, with files under, say, a couple of hundred kB, "bash"
arrays are the way to go.</p>

<p>Note that the above script can be easily generalized - as an
example, you could add the ability to specify different
phone-lists, criteria, or actions, right from the command line.
Once the data is broken up into an easily-addressable format, the
possibilities are endless...</p>

<h3>Wrapping It Up</h3>
Bash, besides being very capable in its role as a command-line
interpreter/shell, boasts a large number of rather sophisticated
tools available to anyone who needs to create custom programs. In
my opinion, shell scripting suits its niche - that of a simple yet
powerful programming language - perfectly, fitting between
command-line utility usage and full-blown (C, Tcl/Tk, Perl, Python)
programming, and should be part of every *nix user's arsenal. Linux
encourages the "do it yourself" attitude among its users by giving
them access to powerful tools and the means to automate their usage
- something that I consider a tighter integration (and that much
higher a "usability quotient") between the underlying power of the
OS and the user environment.

<p>Until next month -<br>
Happy Linuxing!</p>

<h1>Measure CPU Fan Speed with an RTAI/LXRT Stroboscope!</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<p>The BIOS on most modern motherboards will show you the
rotational speed of the CPU fan. Let's design a simple
&lsquo;optical&rsquo; experiment for verifying whether the value
reported is indeed correct. For maximum voodoo effect, the
experiment should be conducted at night with the only source of
light being an LED blinking under the control of some dark and
devious <a href="http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai">RTAI/LXRT</a>
code!</p>

<h3>What is the big idea?</h3>

<p>Think of a fan with four blades rotating at a speed of 3600
rotations per minute (RPM.) Let's mark a part of one of the blades
with a distinct color, say white. Once the fan starts rotating, it
will be difficult for us to differentiate this blade as everything
becomes blurred. Each full rotation takes 1/60th of a second. What
if we look at the blades for a very brief period only once in that
1/60th of a second? It will appear as if the white mark is
motionless because each time we will see it at almost the same
position each revolution. A light source (like an LED) can be made
to generate short bursts of light at fairly high frequencies; an
object illuminated by such a source will be seen only during those
periodic short bursts of light. When the frequency of the bursts
match the frequency of rotation of the object being observed, the
object appears to be stationary. This is the principle of the
<a href=
"http://homepages.which.net/~paul.hills/Circuits/Stroboscope/Stroboscope.html">
stroboscope</a>.</p>

<h3>The hardware</h3>

<p>There is almost always a cooling fan attached to the CPU in a
desktop computer; your only job is to &lsquo;mark&rsquo; one of the
blades. I did this by pasting a small piece of white paper onto one
blade and it seems to work well.</p>

<p class="editorial">[Editor's note - leaving a high-speed fan
unbalanced <b>will</b> shorten the life of its bearings. I strongly
advise you to remove the marker from the fan when you are done with
the experiment! &mdash; dsrich]</p>

<p>The light source is a &lsquo;high-brightness&rsquo; LED
controlled by the parallel port. It's better that the LED is driven
by a transistor other than the parallel port output to increase the
amount of current through the LED and therefore its brightness. If
you are new to PC interfacing, please proceed with caution,
preferably after reading the material presented on web sites such
as <a href=
"http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/parallel_output.html">this
one</a>.</p>

<h3>The software</h3>

<p>Generating small (and precise) time delays under a general
purpose operating system like Linux is not an easy job. In one of
my <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue95/pramode.html">earlier
articles</a>, I had explained the use of an exciting technology
called &lsquo;Real Time Application Interface&rsquo; (RTAI) which
converts GNU/Linux into a hard real-time OS capable of doing
complex timing-sensitive control operations. The trouble with the
&lsquo;classical&rsquo; RTAI approach was that timing sensitive
code had to be written as modules and loaded into the kernel. The
more &lsquo;modern&rsquo; way of doing things is to use a component
of RTAI called LXRT and code real-time tasks as ordinary POSIX
threads.</p>

<h3>Setting up RTAI/LXRT</h3>

<p>RTAI/LXRT is composed of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A kernel patch which does some low level magic to convert your
Linux kernel to a &lsquo;real time OS&rsquo;.</li>

<li>A set of kernel modules which implement functionality like
intertask communication.</li>

<li>A library which gets linked with your application code and
helps to convert it into a real-time application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the steps required to get RTAI/LXRT running on your
machine:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download a a &lsquo;plain&rsquo; Linux kernel (from kernel.org)
- I used linux-2.6.10.</li>

<li>Download rtai-3.2-test3 from <a href=
"http://www.aero.polimi.it/~rtai/">here</a></li>

<li>When you untar the RTAI source package, you will see several
patches under the <code>base/arch/i386/patches</code> directory.
Apply the proper patch to your newly downloaded Linux kernel
(hal-linux-2.6.10-i386-r9.patch, in case you are using Linux
2.6.10). The patch should apply cleanly.</li>

<li>Configure and compile the kernel. When you configure the
kernel, make sure that module versioning support is disabled. The
experimental &lsquo;pass parameters in registers&rsquo; feature
should also be disabled. You can verify both by reading your
.config file (after you have done <code>make menuconfig</code>)
which should contain the lines:

<pre>

# CONFIG_REGPARM is not set
# CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is not set

</pre></li>

<li>Configure and compile rtai-3.2-test3. The configuration and
compilation process is fairly simple - you just have to do:

<pre>

make menuconfig; make; make install

</pre>
When you run <code>make menuconfig</code>, you will be asked to
provide the full path to the RTAI-patched Linux kernel source tree.
During <code>make install</code>, a few directories will be created
under /usr/realtime/ - the header files, libraries and kernel
modules required to do RTAI/LXRT development will be found under
these directories.</li>

<li>Reboot with the newly compiled kernel. Go to the
<code>/usr/realtime/modules</code> directory and try to insert the
modules rtai_hal.ko and rtai_lxrt.ko:

<pre>

cd /usr/realtime/modules/
insmod ./rtai_hal.ko
insmod ./rtai_lxrt.ko

</pre>
The modules should load cleanly. Check the output of the program
<code>dmesg</code> if there is any problem.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Blinking LEDs</h3>

<p>The traditional &lsquo;hello world&rsquo; program of the
hardware enthusiast is a simple LED blinker. Let's code it as an
RTAI/LXRT application:</p>

<p>[Download <a href="misc/pramode/listing1.txt">Listing 1</a>]</p>

<pre class="code">

/* led1.c, an LXRT LED blinker */

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai_lxrt.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;

// delay in nanoseconds
#define TICKS 500000000 

main()
{
        RT_TASK *task;
        int priority = 0, i;
        int stack_size = 4096;
        int msg_size = 0; // use default

        // get enough privilege to 
        // access the I/O ports.

        iopl(3);

        task = rt_task_init(nam2num("main"), 
                        priority, stack_size, msg_size);
        if(task == 0) exit(1);
        rt_set_oneshot_mode();
        start_rt_timer(0);
        mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE);
        rt_make_hard_real_time();

        for(i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
                outb(0xff, 0x378);
                rt_sleep(nano2count(TICKS));
                outb(0x0, 0x378);
                rt_sleep(nano2count(TICKS));
        }
        // back to non-rt land!
        rt_make_soft_real_time();
        stop_rt_timer();
        rt_task_delete(task);
        return 0;
}

</pre>

<p>The <code>rt_task_init</code> function registers our program
with the RTAI/LXRT kernel subsystem - the return value is a
pointer. Each task should have a name associated with it - we have
assigned the name <code>main</code> to our task.</p>

<p>Timing delays in RTAI/LXRT are generated by using the hardware
timer chip found on the motherboard. The timer is capable of
generating interrupts and can run in two modes - periodic and one
shot. When running in periodic mode, it keeps generating interrupts
at a fixed rate (say once every 1 millisecond). If all the time
delays required in your code can be expressed as multiples of a
&lsquo;base&rsquo; period (say 1 millisecond), you can think of
using the periodic mode. In the &lsquo;one-shot&rsquo; mode, the
timer will generate just one interrupt at a time after a certain
delay. This mode provides more flexibility as the timer can be
reprogrammed repeatedly to fire at differing intervals.</p>

<p>The <code>mlockall</code> function is called to disable paging
of program memory - paging might result in the program being
transferred to persistent swap store medium thereby affecting its
real-time behavior.</p>

<p>The <code>rt_make_hard_real_time</code> function transfers
control of our application to the RTAI/LXRT realtime scheduler. The
effect of this transition is that our code will never get disturbed
by normal Linux processes or activities going within the Linux
kernel. Note that once the program becomes &lsquo;hard real
time&rsquo;, it should never invoke Linux system calls - doing so
will result in the task becoming non real-time.</p>

<p>The <code>nano2count</code> function converts time specified in
nanoseconds to some &lsquo;internal count units&rsquo; specific to
RTAI/LXRT. We have defined TICKS to be 500 milliseconds; so</p>

<pre>

rt_sleep(nano2count(TICKS))

</pre>
will suspend our task for half a second. If we run the code with an
LED connected to an output pin (pins 2 to 9) of the parallel port,
we will see it blinking on and off ten times.

<p>The program should be compiled like this:</p>

<pre>

cc led1.c -I/usr/realtime/include -L/usr/realtime/lib -lpthread -llxrt

</pre>
Before running the code, make sure to edit your /etc/ld.so.conf
file so that it contains the path to the directory containing the
LXRT library (say /usr/realtime/lib); the <code>ldconfig</code>
command should also be executed.

<h3>The LXRT stroboscope!</h3>

<p>I enter the CMOS setup program of my Athlon64 machine and note
that my CPU fan is running at a speed of about 3900 rotations per
minute, or 65 rotations per second. The time for one rotation is
therefore (1000000000/65) nanoseconds, or 15384615 nanoseconds. The
idea is to blink an LED connected to pin number 2 of the parallel
port at this frequency.</p>

<pre>

LED on + off time = 15384615 nanoseconds
LED on time = 15384615/12 nanoseconds

</pre>
Out of the total period of 15384615 nanoseconds, the LED would stay
on for (1/12)th of the period and would be off for the remaining
time. The fan (and the white paper stuck onto one of the blades)
will be visible only during this brief period; by the time the LED
is on again, the blade with the paper will have returned back to
its original position. Thus, we should be able to see an almost
static image of the paper pasted onto the blade.

<p>In practice, I had to continuously tweak the period to get an
almost static image. This might be because the fan speed is not
remaining constant and keeps on changing slightly.</p>

<p>The code I had written is shown below:</p>

<p>[Download <a href="misc/pramode/listing2.txt">Listing 2</a>]</p>

<pre class="code">

#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;rtai_lxrt.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/io.h&gt;

#define ONE_ROTATION   15384615

volatile int stop = 0;
unsigned int on_time, off_time; 

void* led_task(void *arg)
{
        RT_TASK *task;
        int priority = 0, i;
        int stack_size = 4096;
        int msg_size = 0;

        printf("LED started ...\n");

        task = rt_task_init(nam2num("led"), 
                        priority, stack_size, msg_size);
        if(task == 0) exit(1);
        mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE);
        rt_make_hard_real_time();

        while(!stop) {
                outb(0xff, 0x378);
                rt_sleep(nano2count(on_time));
                outb(0x0, 0x378);
                rt_sleep(nano2count(off_time));
        }
        rt_make_soft_real_time();
        rt_task_delete(task);
        return 0;
}

main()
{
        RT_TASK *task;
        int priority = 10, i;
        int stack_size = 4096;
        int msg_size = 0;
        pthread_t t1;

        on_time = ONE_ROTATION/12;
        off_time = ONE_ROTATION - on_time;

        task = rt_task_init(nam2num("main"), 
                        priority, stack_size, msg_size);
        if(task == 0) exit(1);
        rt_set_oneshot_mode();
        start_rt_timer(0);
        
        pthread_create(&amp;t1, 0, led_task, 0);
        getchar();
        stop = 1;
        pthread_join(t1, 0);
        stop_rt_timer();
        rt_task_delete(task);
        return 0;
}

</pre>
Note that the main thread is spawning a new thread which calls
<code>rt_make_hard_real_time</code> - this is the real-time LED
flasher. The main thread remains non real-time because it has to
interact with Linux (the <code>getchar</code> function will call
the <code>read</code> system call). This is typical of LXRT code;
one or more non real-time threads will do all the Linux-interaction
part and the hard real-time threads will do some hardware
manipulations without invoking any system calls.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>As I mentioned in the beginning, do this experiment at night,
preferably near around midnight! Whether you see the stroboscopic
effect or not, your friends (or family members) who might catch you
in action staring at the open motherboard of the machine in pitch
darkness with an LED light in your hands are sure to get a very
favorable impression about your general geek qualities!</p>

<p>If you have trouble compiling your RTAI patched Linux kernel, 
<!-- 20050508 dsrich Moved config.txt to local directory, changed link. -->
you might try using my <a href="misc/pramode/config.txt">.config
file</a> (Linux 2.6.10, patched with the corresponding RTAI patch.)
You should modify the CPU type to match your computer before

<p>You can learn more about RTAI/LXRT by reading the paper <a href=
"http://people.mech.kuleuven.ac.be/~psoetens/portingtolxrt.html">Porting
your C++ GNU/Linux application to RTAI/LXRT</a>. The <a href=
"http://www.fdn.fr/~brouchou/rtai/rtai-doc-prj/doxyapi/lxrt_faq.html">
LXRT-Informed FAQ</a> is good reading too. The <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobe_light">wikipedia entry on
strobe light</a> links the phenomenon to &lsquo;aliasing&rsquo;
which is common in digital signal processing.</p>

<p>As we are not dealing with sub-millisecond time periods here,
the usual Linux delay mechanisms (based on the system clock running
at 1KHz on the 2.6 kernel) should be sufficient for this
experiment. Doing so is left as an exercise to the reader!</p>

<h1>PmWiki - Wiki the Painless Way</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/shekhar.html">Raj Shekhar</A></b></p>


</b>
</p>


<p>
<h3> 1.1 Why use a Wiki </h3>
<p> In the Issue 108 of Linux Gazette, Neil Youngman had written an <a
href="../108/youngman.html ">article introducing JSPWiki</a>.  In this
article I would like to introduce you to an obscure but feature packed
Wiki, called <a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/PmWiki/PmWiki
">PmWiki</a>.  Before diving into the intricacies of Wiki, I will speak a
bit about where I have used wikis and found them quite good.  </p>

<p> <dl compact> <dt>Knowledgebase <dd>Wikis make it easy to create
interlinked HTML pages.  You can concentrate on the task of writing actual
content without worrying about HTML tags or how to create the navigation
links.  The easy markup of the wikis make it very easy to copy text from
emails, chat logs and random web pages and add it in your wiki.  The
wikiengine takes care of transforming the simple text to clean HTML. (a
side note: you should give credit to the original author when you are
copying text from some email/web page.)</p>

<p> Most wikiengines come with a search engine too, which makes the task to
searching through the Wiki pages easier.  </p>

<p> <dt>Available anywhere to-do list <dd>I have tried a lot of things to
keep a list of things I have promised to do.  At one time I experimented
with keeping it on a wiki page (on the Internet) and then kept
adding/subtracting to it.  (these days I use the excellent <a
href="http://sacha.free.net.ph/notebook/wiki/PlannerMode.php">emacs-planner</a>
).  Since it is quite easy to edit the wiki page, it was quite effective.
</p>

<p> <dt>Keeping meeting notes <dd>In a brainstorming session, it is
important to keep notes.  However, if the company is small, the onus is
upon the participants to keep track of the discussions that happened.  In
my previous company (which was quite small), each one of us kept our own
notes in a simple text file.  After the session was over, we used to create
one wiki page and put our individual notes on that page.
</dl>
</p>

<p>
<h3> 1.2 Why Pmwiki </h3>

The main features that I was looking for in the Wiki were
<ul>
<li>It should not require a database backend, since I had used up all the databases allocated to me by my hosting provider
<li>It should be written in PHP, since this is the language that I know quite well
<li>It should be under GPL license
<li>It should be <em>skinnable</em>, i.e. I should be able to change its look and feel without too much trouble
</ul>

Looking through the list of <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngines">available Wiki options</a>, I
found <a href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/">PmWiki</a>.  It met all the
requirements that I was looking for.  I also saw that this project
definitely believed in <a
href="http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&amp;Database=jargon&amp;Query=dogfood">eating
its own dogfood</a>.  The documentation as well as the <a
href="http://www.pmwiki.org/PITS">bug list</a> has been maintained using
PmWiki itself.  I also had a look at the <a
href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/TextFormattingRules">wiki's markup
syntax</a>, which seemed to be simple enough.  <p>

<h3> 1.3 Installation </h3>
<p> The <a
href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/Installation">Installation</a> page
has instructions on how you can get the latest version of PmWiki.  The page
also has installation instructions.  As it is common with most of the PHP
applications, the process is quite simple.  You have to copy the files to a
directory in your webserver's document root (for example in
<code>/var/www/html/mywiki</code>) and then change the directory
permissions to 2777.  Use a browser to open the <code>pmwiki.php</code>
page in this directory i.e.
<tt>`www.yourdomain.com/mywiki/pmwiki.php'</tt>. If the permissions have
been set properly, you should see the default PmWiki home page.  </p><p>

<h3> 1.4 Customization </h3>
<p>
Once the wiki has been installed, the next step is to customize it.
The customizations are usually controlled by the
<code>config.php</code> file found in the <code>local</code> directory.  When you first
install PmWiki, the <code>config.php</code> file will not exist and so
you'll have to create one if you want to perform any local
customizations. You can copy the <code>sample-config.php</code> file (in the
same directory as <code>pmwiki.php</code>) to <code>local</code> directory and use it as a
starting point.
</p>

<p> The first thing that you may want to customize is the
<code>$WikiTitle</code>.  The <code>$WikiTitle</code> variable gives
the name of your site as it will appear in a user's browser title bar.
</p>

<p>
The next thing you may want to customize is the skin. If you lack
design skills, like me, there is still hope for you.  The PmWiki has
<a href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/Skins">good skins available
at the site itself</a>.  Once you have downloaded the skin, unzip and put
it in the folder <code>pub/skins/</code>).  Then you set the <code>$Skin</code>
variable to the name of the directory that contains your skin files.
For example, if you like
<a href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/JHSkin">JHSkin</a>, download
the zip file and unzip its content.  You will have a folder called
<code>jhskin</code>. Upload this folder to the <code>pub/skins</code> folder in
your wiki's directory.  Then change the <code>Skin</code> variable to
<code>$Skin = 'jhskin'</code>.  When you reload the wiki in your browser,
you will see that it sports a new look now.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/wiki/Cookbook">PmWiki cookbook</a> has
 tips for more customizations.
</p>

<h3> 1.5 Antispam Measures </h3>

<p> Since wiki pages are editable by everyone, spammers use them to serve
as their link farms (For example, <a
href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=poker+casino+online+game+inurl%3Awiki">this
google search</a> will help you to locate some abused wikis).  Luckily
PmWiki provides a few measures to fight against this menace.  You can use
the <a href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/MTBlackList">Movable Type
black list</a> to help control wiki spam.  If the number of users who need
to use the wiki is small, you can even <a
href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/PasswordsAdmin ">give them indivual
passwords</a>.  There is a <a
href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/UserAuth">UserAuth script</a>
available too, which allows you to manage a larger number of users.  This
script also allows you to register users before they can edit pages.  </p>

<p>
If you are making a wiki which will reside on your LAN, you can leave
out these antispam measures. If you are making the wiki for your own
use, I strongly suggest you have an admin password and allow only the
admin to edit the pages. If you are making a world editable Wiki, be
sure to review the <a href="http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/Security">PmWiki Security page</a>.
</p>

<p>"Foolish Things" is a now-and-again compilation that we run based on our
readers' input; once we have several of these stories assembled in one
place, we get to share them with all of you. If you enjoy reading these
cautionary tales of woe, proud stories of triumph, and just plain weird and
fun things that happen between humans and silicon, that's great; if you
have some to share so that others may enjoy them, even better. Please send
them to <img src="../gx/lgmail/articles.png">.

&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And don't do live demos on your laptop where you might have personal
&gt; &gt; data unless you've already rehearsed every step of your demo in the
&gt; &gt; privacy of your own cubicle, and verified that nothing of questionable
&gt; &gt; interest might be exposed.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; And on a completely unrelated topic, keep in mind that the resource
&gt; &gt; fork of a movie you downloaded to a UFS partition on MacOSX will be
&gt; &gt; stored in a file named "._moviename.mpg", which doesn't get removed
&gt; &gt; when you say "rm *".
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; :-)
&gt; 
&gt; Not that I've ever suffered from any of the above problems, oh no...
&gt; (Displaying your /etc/bashrc, when it happens to contain aliases
&gt; designed to discourage those who type curse words as commands - during a
&gt; demo at a bank headquarters, no less - cannot *possibly* have happened

<h3>Oh, Fuss and Botheration. I think I've Just Nuked the World...</h3>
<p id="by">from <b>Richard Neill</b><br>

<p> When I was learning Linux, I decided to install the recent version of
Mozilla (from <a href="http://mozilla.org">mozilla.org</a>), since the
version that came with Mandrake 8.0 was a few months old, and Moz was
really making leaps every month (around version 0.93, I recall).

<p> Anyway, the installer asked me where I wanted to put it. I looked where
the distro put it, (<code>/usr/bin/mozilla</code>), and told the installer
to put the new copy in <code>/usr/bin</code>. Of course the installer
wanted to put a whole bunch of files there, not just the mozilla
executable, and it complained that the directory wasn't empty. Might it
delete the other files in the directory, it asked? <em>Yes</em>, I said.

<p> Bother. It's surprising how useless a Linux distro gets when you
effectively do <code>rm -rf /usr/bin</code>. It's also odd that nothing
immediately breaks, e.g. KDE continued to work fine.

<p> What I should have done was <code>rpm -Va</code> and then reinstalled
the packages.  But in the end, I did a full reinstall.

<h3>If It Walks Like a DIG, and quacks like a DOC...</h3>
<p id="by">from <b><a href="http://robinlyl.freeshell.org">Robin Twombly</a></b><br>

<p> I run several version of Linux and the worst problem I had was when I miss
typed a directory name when deleting.  I wanted to delete the folder var/www/
htdig  and I accidentally typed var/www/htdocs thus deleting all my internet
files for my apache web server.

<p> At the time I was not clear on how to undelete a file on Linux.

<p> Thank you for many hours of fun reading.<br>

do was play guitar. Out of the 16 or 17 more or less completed songs
I came up with, only 4 or 5 passed the quality control process
before being presented to my band (my next "Songs..." article will
have some of the details), but the thing that's really irking me
is that every time I try to finish off one of these metal songs, I
end up getting delicate acoustic music that'll never be played.

Jean-Michel Jarre??? Oh, well. There was some small chance of recovery
up until you did that, but now... it's not even worth attempting. Heavy
metal locked in by J-MJ is a self-replicating meme that results in an
instantly-fatal case of acne for its host if anyone tries to remove it;
you're permanently stuck. Don't worry, though; we'll keep AC/DC, some

would eventually be in the millions, someone else said, "Where are they
all going to go? It's not like you need a computer in every doorknob!"
Years later, I went back to the same hotel. I noticed the room keys had
been replaced by electronic cards you slide into slots in the doors.

Marriage is very much like a violin; after the sweet music is over, the strings are attached.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Marriage is love. Love is blind. Therefore, marriage is an institution for the blind.

Marriage is an institution in which a man loses his Bachelor's Degree and the woman gets her Masters.

Marriage is a thing which puts a ring on a woman's finger and two under the man's eyes.

Marriage is not just a having a wife, but also worries inherited forever.

Marriage requires a man to prepare 4 types of "rings": The Engagement Ring, The Wedding Ring, The Suffe-Ring, The Endu-Ring.

<blockQuote>
Married life is full of excitement and frustration: In the first year of marriage, the man speaks and the woman listens; In the second year, the woman speaks and the man listens; In the third year, they both speak and the neighbors listen.

<blockQuote>
It is true that love is blind but marriage is definitely an eye-opener.

Getting married is very much like going to the restaurant with friends. You order what you want, and when you see what the other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that.

The fact that Nigeria has a House and Senate like the US sounded suspicious, since
few other countries do, so I checked the president's name and government structure
against the CIA World Factbook

They seem to be correct, surprise, although of course maybe the spammer himself read
the Factbook entry and based his letter on it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, why is the President of Nigeria sending an official e-mail from a Brazilian
address and asking people to contact an agent in Italy.  Does Nigeria not have a
working e-mail system?  Oh, of course it does, that's where the previous 419 scams
came from.

Well, that depends on a couple things. There's nothing left of Social
Security right now. It takes money from young people, and gives it to
old people. There's no money in the system. Oh, sure, there's a "trust
fund", but as I understand it, nearly all of it is "loaned" to other
government programs. That is, we've spend the money, and we've promised
ourselves we're going to make up for it later. Given the spending habits
of the government, how much you wanna bet we ever get around to it?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I don't think the Social Security program as we know it can continue for
long. It's a bugger to deal with. On the one hand, I don't think the
government should really be moving money around in that way. It's the
responsibility of the individual.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But on the other hand, we've said "No worries, we'll always be there for
you with this bit of money every month." We were, of course, lying for
political expediency. It's obvious the whole thing is going under and
was flawed from the start. But that doesn't matter now. We've got the
program, whether we like it or not.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So, the question is, how do you faze it out while still being fair to
everyone? The answer is: You can't. You can rip off seniors by cutting
off "benefits" or you can rip off young people by having them pay in and
receive nothing back. There's no nice way out now. The thing was a
pyramid scheme from the start: Somebody's got to lose.

When you're used to "pudding" as a smooth silky sweet dessert, and then
you're all excited coz there's pudding on the menu, and then you get it
and it's this bread thing, it's a real disappointment.  That happened

Hahahahaha.  Sorry, I shouldn't laugh.  Hehehehehehehe.  Ordinarily, a
"pudding" is a sweet-dish, yes.  There's also "steak and kidney pudding"
-- the "pudding" part made from suet [1]. But that's savoury.  You
should try and look at a Yorkshire pudding in a new light -- cumberland
sausages [2] in a huge yorkshire pudding with onion gravy, is divine.
Mmmmmmm.  It's a typical English dish, for sure.

<blockquote><pre> Pouding de pain (mind the spelling)

 /Do not believe this word is from an English origin, it's actually
  French. The British adopted it one day and gave it its current
  spelling, 'pudding'.
  This bread pouding, similar to some other European recipes, was once a
  tasteful way not to lose remains of stale bread; it often used to feed
  little hungers at tea-time.
  At the time when the bread pouding was a family habit, the stale bread
  remains that were used were from good, old-fashioned bread; pouding
  made of modern bread is very likely to give disappointing results,
  unless one chooses so-called artisanal "country" bread./

   Raisins: 100g                            Fresh eggs: 4
   Amber rhum: 100cc                        Salt (optional): 1 pinch
   Stale country bread: 500g                Butter: 25g (for the mold)
   Cinnamon: according to taste             Ice sugar: plenty
   Sugar: 100g                              Milk: 250cc

 - Rinse the raisins quickly, remove the possibly remaining little
   tails; put the raisins in a bowl, add the rhum and let soak.
 - Break the stale bread into pieces. Put these in a salad bowl,
   sprinkle them with the milk until they fully absorb it; let soak.
 - Preheat the oven (180&deg;C).
 - Dry the bread with one's fingers to remove the excess of milk; crush
   it with a fork. One should obtain evenly sized chunks, not too big
   but not a pulp either. Add the desired quantity of cinnamon, the
   sugar, the beaten eggs. Taste and correct with the salt if
   needed. Add the soaked raisins, as well as their excess juice.
 - Pour into a buttered mold, flatten the surface. Put in the oven.
   Cook for 30 minutes (use this time to re-read a few chapters from
   http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin22/guide.html, for example). Check
   with a knife: the blade must remain dry when the cooking is over.

sheep, etc., stuffed with minced meat, suet, seasoning, boiled and kept till

Westphalian dial. puddek "lump, pudding," Low Ger. pudde-wurst "black pudding,"
Eng. dial. pod "belly," also cf. pudgy). Other possibility is that it is from
O.Fr. boudin "sausage," from V.L. *botellinus, from L. botellus "sausage"
(change of Fr. b- to Eng. p- presents difficulties, but cf. purse). The modern
sense had emerged by 1670, from extension to other foods boiled or steamed in a
bag or sack. Ger. pudding, Fr. pouding, Swed. pudding, Ir. putog are from Eng.

I don't believe that the etymology of "pouding" can be traced back in French
further than the English, although I'm willing to be caught out on this, as
medieval French is not my bailiwick.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One can trace a possible "boudin --&gt; pouding" explanation, but "boudin"
definitely means sausage in French, while "pouding" is a rice pudding/bread
pudding concoction.  In English "pudding" applies across the board from "black
pudding" (clearly boudin noir) to the generic (non-American) "pudding ==
dessert in general unless otherwise modified" usage.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The English usage of "pudding" to mean dessert makes sense in that the original
versions were all boiled puddings, whether savory or sweet.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Are the French not using "pain perdu" as a term anymore?  This is the term used
in English language cookbooks for what's known in the U.S. as "bread pudding",
and previously as "poor knights".  There is a version known as "bread and
butter pudding" as well, which is similar.

It's still not fully passed yet.  The commission have approved it, but it
still needs to go back to the European Parliament for a second reading.
However, this time it will take a 2/3 majority to <TT>/prevent/</TT> it being

Indeed, if it were not for those few, namely Poland, Denmark, with support

Sounds like the sports stadium syndrome.  The team owners (billionaires)
want the public to pay for a new stadium.  The public votes it down --
twice -- but the city or state rams it through anyway citing "emergency
economic necessity".  This happened twice in my state, and now a third
team is saying, "Hey, you did it for the other two, now it's my turn."

It would appear that today's events were as a result of 'process'.  From
what I've read the Danish minister could have lodged a request that the
item be removed from the A list, instead of asking for it to be converted
to the B list.  Had he done the former the Luxembourg Council Presidency
would have had to agree, but because he chose the latter they could
decline the request (and it has also been suggested that this was his
intent, having been forced by a Danish Parliamentary Committee to try and
have it removed).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Anyone who lives in a European country and cares about the software
patents issue should now be writing to their MEP explaining why they
should be voting NO for this when it comes before the EU Parliament
(which is likely to be sooner rather than later).

I only hope that you're right and I'm wrong.  I know that there is
considerable discontent among the MEP for the way that their votes have
been trampled, but I'm not sure that's enough.  Maybe they'll get
thoroughly disgusted and react effectively.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Some say that the existance of the EP serves more to provide the illusion
of a democratic process and that their vote is not really meant to be
deterministic.  Again, I hope it proves not be the case, but the whole
matter has made a mockery of the concept of democratic process.

EU law.  Whole books have been written on the subject, and yet no one
really understands it.  My own idea of it, is that because we are a
member of the EU, we have MEPs (which represent us in the EU).  EU law
rules over any specific laws each respective country might have.  So in
that way, it can be fairly dangerous...

As I understand it, there are two main institutions, the European
Commission, which is made up of unelected officials from the various
member nations, and the European Parliament, which is made up of
representatives voted for by 27% percent or so of EU citizens, those who
could be bothered to express a preference.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, the Commission seems to have more power than the Parliament, a
problem that the European Constitution is supposed to go some way in
rectifying.

But as you say, whole books have, and will continue to be, written on the
subject.

Thanks for your message. Following yesterday's decision in the
Competitiveness Council, the EP has requested that the Commission make a
statement to the EP Plenary tomorrow in Strasbourg at 6.00pm. MEPs are
awaiting with considerable interest to see what the Commission has to
say but it's important to remember that the EP has the right to retable
any of its first reading amendments not taken up in the Council's common
position, which the EP has yet to see, or to reject the common position
in its entirity. If Council still refuses to accept them, a
'conciliation committee' of MEPs and national civil servants will meet
to reach a compromise. If none is found, the proposal falls. The
important point is that the Ministers do not take the final decision on
this issue - they must work with the EP.

This is a bad idea.  As I have pointed out in the past to people, having

Yeah, that's probably an even better way to phrase it. This is one of
the reasons that you an still accomplish useful tasks - hell, pretty

I'm not sure 386/8/20 is still sustainable though.  The kernel size has

There was a book I read when I was little about a boy who met a Martian
who had a spaceship disguised as a car.  It was the intersection of two
technologies: (1) the spaceship walls couldn't be seen except with special
glasses, and (2) you could fold the car up and put it in your pocket.  Now
that's compressibilty.  I've often thought about how that would solve the
problem of parking spaces....

Actually, in my mid-teen years, I "invented" an inflatable car that
would go a long way toward that scenario.  Seriously. Did the research,
found out what it would take... looking back at it today, it's still
quite a reasonable proposition. It was an ACV, of course; tapped the
engine output to inflate and deflate (via a tiny two-chamber extraction
pump) the passenger compartment. You could stack these things, deflated,
on top of each other, in your garage or whatever.  Steered via a
joystick, <EM>way</EM> safer than a regular case in case of an accident... very
simple design, but - alas, I've never had the cred in that world or the
money/desire to do it myself. Oh well.

Again, it looks like two passes is the optimal for bzip2 when dealing

file would be about a gig, but it occurs to me I could do two-pass
compression on the fly:

justified? Anyway, uuencode isn't cooperating, so we'll do it this way:

save from viruses on a Dec alpha/64 bit running OSF Unix which was even

Both of the servers, of course, have a minimal tool set (just enough to
accomplish the job they need to do) so that Mr. Cracker has nothing to
work with if he should get that far... so cracking the outside router
AND root on the servers that have a public "face" leaves him essentially
where he was before he started - or worse. Better yet, use Kapil's
"transparent FS" idea: the reads go through to the FS, but the writes to
everything except, e.g., the mail spool and the logs go off to
<TT>/dev/null...</TT> let'em figure <EM>that</EM> one out.

[bows] Thannnk you; Kapil's got the wheels spinning in my head on this
topic, although I have no time to fiddle with it for now. Sure, it's
security through obscurity... but face it, how many crackers would even
have the slightest clue? And what could they do about it if they did,
given that the tools are either missing or are sitting on the far side
of the chroot jail? It's kinda like using 'chattr' on certain key files
and then taking 'chattr' with you when you go away - only with more
hair, teeth, and muscles.

Still for the querent I think the best is to to decouple the
gui-mailer and the filtering to avoid long waits and hangs. Then
spamd/spamc should do nicely even on a rather meager system. I did not
get the impression that fetchmail was exceptionally memory hungry, just
CPU spikes.

[Nod] That's my experience as well. It seems to me that anytime you can
use an "older", console-based Unix utility or an older, time-tested
daemon, you're better off in terms of resiliency and broader
capabilities; certainly in regard to the range of things that can be
handled without bogging the system.

A blonde was headed to Detroit. She got on the plane and sat down in first class. A few minutes later, a flight attendent  came up to her and told her that her ticket was for coach and she had to move from the seat. She refused. The flight  attendent was persistant, but the blonde replied, "No, I want to sit here, I've always wanted to see what it is like in  first class." The flight attendent was getting frustrated. Finally, after quite some time, she convinced her to move.  Another passenger who had witnessed the exchange asked the attendent, "How did you get her to move?" The flight attendent  replied, "I told her first class doesn't stop in Detroit."

John and Marsha decided that the only way to pull off a Sunday afternoon quickie with their ten-year-old son in the  apartment was to send him out on the balcony and tell him to report on all the neighborhood activities. He began his  commentary as his parents put their plan into operation. "There's a car being towed from the parking lot," he said. A few  moments passed. "An ambulance just drove by." A few more moments passed. "Looks like the Andersons have company," he called  out. "Matt's riding a new bike." "The Coopers are having sex." Mom and Dad shot up in bed. "How do you know they're having  sex?" "Their kid is standing out on the balcony too."

So the robot proceeded to make conversation about Quantum physics, string theory, atomic chemistry,  and so on. The man listened intently and thought, 'This is really cool.' The man decided to test the robot. He walked out  the bar, turned around, and came back in for another drink. Again, the robot asked him, 'What's your IQ?' The man responded,  '100.' So the robot started talking about football, baseball, and so on. The man thought to himself, 'Wow, this is amazing.'  The man went out and came back in a third time. As before, the robot asked him, 'What's your IQ?' The man replied, '50.' The  robot then said, 'So, you gonna vote for Bush again?'

A 70-year-old man went to the doctor's for a physical. The doctor ran some tests and said to the man, "Well, everything  seems to be in top condition physically, but what about mentally? How is your connection with God?" And the man answered,  "Oh me and God? We have a really tight bond, he's so good to me. Every night when I have to get up to go to the bathroom, he  turns on the light for me, and then, when I leave, he turns it back off." The Doctor was astonished. He called the man's  wife and said, "I'd like to speak to you about your husband's connection with God. He claims that every night when he needs  to use the restroom, God turns on the light for him and turns it off for him again when he leaves. Is this true?" And she  said, "That idiot, he's been peeing in the refrigerator!"

I was curious about this quote in a <A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A> article: "~$350,000 (Rs. 1.5
crores)".  Is a crore a multiple of rupees?  Or is this a typo?

Crore = 100 Lakhs = 100 00 thousand.

For some reason, the Indian system of counting goes in 100's after 1000.

I suppose, since the FF 1.0Pre I use handles it - probably because the
installed flashblock extension is preventing it.

<blockquote>Dammit, I love Firefox. There's an extension called
<a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">GreaseMonkey</a>
that allows you to install user defined javascripts to
modify individual websites, such as this one that not only
replaces Flickr's flash interface, but improves on it!

Funny "small world" coincidence: we had a discussion on hydrogen powered
cars, etc. here a while ago - and I just got an article submission from
a fellow who works at Ris&oslash;, as the webmaster for their Hydrogen Storage
Group.
