<P>Every  time we  telnet  into  a  remote machine  the
connection data  will cross the  local network, giving an eventual
intruder the  possibility to spy  the connection and  eventually insert
some malicious commands into the data flux. The use of some strong
cryptography systems will allow an enormous improvement in the security
of the net.

<P>From the  manual page of ssh we  can learn that: "Ssh
 (Secure Shell)  is a  program for logging  into a remote  machine and
 executing commands  in a remote  machine.  It is intended  to replace
 rlogin and  rsh, and provide secure  encrypted communications between
 two untrusted  hosts over an  insecure network.  X11  connections and
 arbitrary  TCP/IP  ports  can  also  be  forwarded  over  the  secure
 channel".   It is  a  powerful, very  easy-to-use  program that  uses
 strong cryptography for protecting all transmitted confidential data,
 including passwords.

<P> At present time there are two SSH protocol, referred
 as SSH2  and SSH1,  the first  one being an  improvement of  the SSH1
 protocol.   SSH2  now  supports  other key-exchange  methods  besides
 double-encrypting  RSA key exchange.  The current  distribution comes
 with Diffie-Hellman  key exchange and  has support for DSA  and other
 public key algorithms besides RSA.

<P>SSH2  can  be  compatible  with  SSH1,  but it is  not
compatible  by default;  the SSH2  server  alone can't  manage a  SSH1
connection and a SSH1 server must be in place in order to do that. 

<h1 align=center>Obtaining and installing SSH</h1>

<P>You can  obtain SSH2 & SSH1 clients  and servers from
the <a  href="http://www.ssh.com"> master FTP server</a>,  or from its
mirrors.   The last  version  of SSH1  protocol is  ssh-1.2.30.tar.gz,
while for SSH2 you can download ssh-2.3.0.tar.gz.

<P>The installation process is really easy. The first
step is unpack your SSH1 sources:

<pre>
tar -zxf ssh-1.2.30.tar.gz
</pre>

<P>This will create  a directory ssh-1.2.30. Now go into
that directory and start the configuration process:

<pre>
cd ssh-1.2.30
./configure
</pre>

<P>The <em>configure</em>  script carries  out  all the
configuration needed in the  compiling stage, searching the system for
the required  library and programs. When  the scripts end  its job you
can start the compilation:

<pre>
make
</pre>
 
<P>After the compilation  stage, become  super-user and
install binaries, configuration files, and hostkey by typing:

<pre>
make install
</pre>

<P>This  will normally install  clients (scp1, ssh-add1,
ssh-agent1, ssh-askpass1, ssh-keygen1,  ssh1) to /usr/local/bin, and a
server  (sshd1) to  /usr/local/sbin.  Notice  that,  in /usr/local/bin
there are also  symbolic link (without the trailing  "1") to the real
executables.

<P>The next step  is to  install SSH2.   The operations
needed are the same required by SSH1:

<pre>
tar -zxf ssh-2.3.0.tar.gz cd ssh-2.3.0 ./configure make
</pre>
 
and as a super-user:

<pre>
make install
</pre>

<h3 align=center>Compatibility SSH1 - SSH2</h3>

<P>In the following part we suppose you have either SSH1
and  SSH2 installed.<br>  In order  to make  the SSH2  server  able to
manage a  SSH1 connection you should edit  SSH2's configuration files,
which  are normally placed  in the  directory /etc/ssh2/.<br>  In that
directory edit the  file <em>sshd2_config</em>, the configuration file
for  sshd2 (Secure  Shell  Daemon)  which is  the  daemon program  for
ssh2. Add the lines:

<pre>
Ssh1Compatibility yes Sshd1Path /usr/local/sbin/sshd1
</pre>

<P>Obviously       modify      the      information
/usr/local/sbin/sshd1 to agree with your sshd1 installation directory.
With this configuration, sshd2  server will forward requests from SSH1
client to sshd1.

<P>Then add two  lines to the file <em>ssh2_config</em>,
placed in the same directory:

<pre>
Ssh1Compatibility yes Ssh1Path /usr/local/bin/ssh1
</pre>

<P>now  ssh2  client   will  invoke  ssh1  client  when
contacting a SSH1 server.

<h1 align=center>Starting SSH</h1>

<P>There  are mainly  two different techniques  to start
sshd at boot time.

<ul>
<li ><P> Go into  /etc/rc.d directory, and edit the file
<em>rc.local</em>. At its end add the lines:

<pre>
echo "Starting sshd ...."  /usr/local/sbin/sshd
</pre>

<P>In such  a way,  at the  end of  your  next computer
reboot, sshd is invoked and the message <em>Starting sshd ....</em> is
printed on  the screen. To start  sshd without  rebooting the machine
type from the command line:

<pre>
/usr/local/sbin/sshd
</pre>

<li>  Alternatively,   in  systems  using  System  V
   initialization,  you  can  put the  <em>sshd2.startup</em>  script,
   which came  with this distribution, to  /etc/rc.d/init.d, naming it
   sshd2.   Then go to  rc$number.d directory,  where $number  is your
   default runlevel.   If you don't  know your runlevel search  in the
   file /etc/inittab the line specifying it:

<pre>
 id:5:initdefault
</pre>

or

<pre>
 id:3:initdefault
</pre>

In the first case your runlevel is 5, in the second one it is 3.

<P>In the directory rc$number.d issue the command:

<pre>
ln -s ../init.d/sshd2 S90sshd2
</pre>

Then change directory to /etc/rc.d/rc0.d and run the command:

<pre>
ln -s ../init.d/sshd2 K90sshd2
</pre>

Repeat the operation in the directory /etc/rc.d/rc6.d.

<P>After  doing  that  you  can start  sshd2  with  out
rebooting the machine, simply running the script:

<pre>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/sshd2 start
</pre>
</ul>

<h1 align=center>Establish a SSH connection</h1>

<P>Once  sshd is  running on your  machine you  can test
your configuration trying to login into it using the ssh client. Let's
suppose that you  machine is named <em>host1</em> and  your login name
is <em>myname</em>. To start a ssh connection use the command:

<pre>
ssh -l myname host1
</pre>

<P>In such  a way ssh2 client (default  client) tries to
connect  to  <em>host1</em>  port  22 (default  port).  sshd2  daemon,
running  on  <em>host1</em>, catches  the  request  and  asks for  the
<em>myname</em>  password. If the  password is  correct it  allows the
login and open a shell.

<h3 align=center>Generating and managing ssh keys</h3>

<P>Ssh allows  another authentication  mechanism, based
upon   <em>authentication  keys</em>,   a   public  key   cryptography
method. Each  user wishing to  use ssh with public  key authentication
must runs <em>ssh-keygen</em> command  (without any option) to create
authentication keys.   The command starts  the generation of  the keys
pair (public and private) and ask for a passphrase in order to protect
them.<br> Two file are created in the $HOME/.ssh2/
directory: <em>id_dsa_1024_a</em>  and <em>id_dsa_1024_a.pub</em>, the
user private and public key.

<P>Let's suppose that we have two accounts, <em>myname1</em> on
<em>host1</em> and <em>myname2</em> on <em>host2</em>. We want to login
from host1 to host2 using ssh public key authentication. In order to do that
four steps are required:

<ol type=1>
<li> On host1 generate the key pair using ssh-keygen
command, and choose a passphrase to protect it.<p>

<li> Login  into   host2,   using  ssh   password
authentication,  and  repeat   the  previous  operation.  Then  change
directory    to    $HOME/.ssh2    and    create    a    file,    named
<em>identification</em>, containing the following lines:

<pre>
# identification
IdKey  id_dsa_1024_a
</pre>

<P>This file is used by sshd to identify the key pair to
be used during connections.<p>

<li> <P>From host2,  get the ssh  host1 public  key and
rename it in a suitable way (e.g. <em>host1.pub</em>):

<pre>
ftp host1
[...]
cd .ssh2
get id_dsa_1024_a.pub host1.pub
</pre> 

<P>At the end of ftp process a copy of host1 public key,
named <em>host1.pub</em>, resides in host2 $HOME/.ssh2 directory.<p>

<li> Create   the   file   <em>authorization</em>
containing the following lines:

<pre>
# authorization
Key     host1.pub
</pre>

<P>This file lists all trusted ssh public keys placed in
$HOME/.ssh2 directory.  When a ssh  connection is started from  a user
whom  public key matches  one of  the entry  of <em>authorization</em>
file the public key authentication scheme starts.
</ol>

<P>In order  to  test the  previous configuration,  you
could try  to connect from host1  to host2 using ssh.  Sshd must reply
asking  for a passphrase,  otherwise, if  password is  requested, some
mistakes  occurred in  the configuration  process and  you  must check
carefully steps 1 to 4.<br>
The passphrase required is your LOCAL passphrase (i.e. passphrase 
protecting host1 public key). 

<h1 align=center>Coming next...</h1>

<P>The next article will  present other programs  and facilities
from ssh suite: ssh-agent and ssh-add (two useful
passphrase management programs),  and sftp and  scp (a secure
way to transfer files across the net).
