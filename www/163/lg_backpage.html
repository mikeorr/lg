<p>
Hi - 
</p>

<p>
As you've noticed, the only thing published this month is NewsBytes.
</p>

<p>
LG is on hiatus this month. If you're pining for your usual fix, please do
send a note to <a
href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lg-tag">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/lg-tag</a>
to let us know; we may be keeping quiet for the moment, but we're still
listening.
</p>

<p>
Best regards,<br>

<p>
Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.
</p>

<p>
<em>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory (the recurring nightmares
have almost faded, actually.)
</p>

<p>
His subsequent experiences include creating software in more than two dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, writing articles for publications ranging from sailing magazines
to technological journals, and teaching on a variety of topics ranging from
Soviet weaponry and IBM hardware repair to Solaris and Linux
administration, engineering, and programming. He also has the distinction
of setting up the first Linux-based public access network in St. Georges,
Bermuda as well as one of the first large-scale Linux-based mail servers in
St. Thomas, USVI.
</p>

<p>
After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean cruise under sail and passages up and
down the East coast of the US, he is currently anchored in northern
Florida. His consulting business presents him with a variety of challenges
such as teaching professional advancement courses for Sun Microsystems and
providing Open Source solutions for local companies.
</p>

<p>
His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, Roman history, and <strike>mangling</strike> playing
with his Ubuntu-based home network, in which he is ably assisted by his <a
href="tanaka-okopnik.html">wife</a> and <a href="okopnik1.html">son</a>;
his Palm Pilot is crammed full of alarms, many of which contain exclamation
points.
</p>

<p>
He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.

<em>
<p>
Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>
<p>
Her transition away from other OSes started with the design of a
massively multilingual wedding invitation.
<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found wielding of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler. More often these days, she's occupied with managing
her <a href="okopnik1.html">latest project</a>.
