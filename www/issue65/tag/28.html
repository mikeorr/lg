How do I choose?

<P><STRONG>
Hi,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I may confess that I am coming from another platform and wants to migrate to
the open world ...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My question which distribution choosing ... I am lost between caldera,
redhat and other SuSe ...?
</STRONG></P>

Nope, not a stupid question at all.  You actually want to take a look at
the differences before picking one;  sounds wise to me.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have had this question fairly recently and discussed it in some detail.
Basically, you need to know what kind of things you want to use your Linux
for, and what things various distros are aiming to be -- then, you can pick
one that is trying to head your direction, and you have a much better chance
of picking usefully.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Gang expounded on this in Issue 60, "Best Linux Distro for a Newbie...?"
(<A HREF="../../issue60/lg_answer60.html#tag/4"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/issue60/lg_answer60.html#tag/4</A>) and I hope
you'll find that answer useful too.  If these aren't quite enough, let us
know what you're thinking of, and we'll try to help out a bit more.

Welcome to the world of Linux, Serge.  I hope you'll find your first forays
here pleasant.

Thank for you answer, I read the Gazette but I am still a bit confused so
...

I have cc'd back in the <A HREF="mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net"

can see, and reply if they also have more comments.

I am coming from the Windows world, started as a developer on Windows 2, 3,
3.1, 9X and NT/2000. I also did a lot on the system side as well as acquired
a certain knowledge on Databases ...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
As you mentioned, it depends what you want to do with it. I don't search for
a new graphical environment, I look for acquiring some new knowledge on a
growing system that - if I am not that wrong - is quite close to UNIX.
Because as my experience should tell that I am not too much into console
mode only, I want something with a GUI which is not available on my home PC
at this time...or I am wrong...???
</STRONG></P>

Well, you can take a look at a bunch of the screenshots over at <A HREF="http://www.libranet.com/">LibraNet</A>,
because they give a very clear sense of what the K desktop looks like.
The Gnome desktop also looks very similar.  (<A HREF="http://www.libranet.com"
	>http://www.libranet.com</A>)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If those are close enough to a usable GUI for you then you can probably
do okay with most of the nicer distributions, and the next concern would
be making sure that you have a decently safe bet on a clean install,
followed by an interest in good access to developer tools.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If that's too different from the GUI you enjoy, there's a Window Manager
named fvwm95 that's designed, as you might guess, to be a <EM>really</EM> close
match.  That means the task bar acts the same, for example.  There will
still be slight differences.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once you start to get used to a few applications, you can play with loading
a few other Window Managers and see if you like some of the others;  many
have interesting extra features.

I plan to learn about the environment but once it is installed, I don't want
to spend 10 weeks - I am not often at home - to have the PC installed...This
has to be done in one shot. I will learn from the system after...as well as
starting to do some development - porting application from Windows to
LINUX/UNIX ....

So you probably want to try following the Willows Software Twin API
(<A HREF="http://www.willows.com"
	>http://www.willows.com</A>).  Or stick very closely to GTK+ and follow the
same style that The Gimp did, since it has a win32 version as well as
a linux one you get a successful example to study the similarities and
differences.  GTK has its own site, <A HREF="http://www.gtk.org"
	>http://www.gtk.org</A> and so does the
Gimp, <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org"
	>http://www.gimp.org</A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
...and if having to run an occasional, but possibly well behaved Windows
binary on your Linux is interesting, you'll also want to keep an eye on
the <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A> project (<A HREF="http://www.winehq.com"
	>http://www.winehq.com</A>) which is trying to provide a
support layer for win32 binaries to be run directly within Linux and a
few other OS'.

Okay, so we want to get you into a developer-friendly install, but not one
that expects you to be a guru during the installation itself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most packages available out there are available in at least one of 4 states:
source tarballs (you get to build it yourself; if you're lucky that's only
3 commands, not very hard, and listed in the README or INSTALL textfile for
the package), Redhat style rpm files, rpm files for non-redhat derivitive
systems (like <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> or <A HREF="http://www.turbolinux.com/">TurboLinux</A>), and <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> packages.  Mandrake and some
other Redhat derivitives can share Redhat style rpms.  <A HREF="http://www.stormix.com/">Stormix</A>, <A HREF="http://linux.corel.com/">Corel</A>Linux,
Libranet, Progeny, and Debian itself all can share deb files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you decide that a debian based system works for you, then I'd definitely
choose either Libranet or Corel, instead of "the real debian" installer,
because in your case, you're not a Linux expert;  even though the Debian
installer is ok, the boost in helpfulness that these commercial distros
provide during the install would be extremely worthwhile for you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you're afraid of repartitioning but still want an fairly easy install of
a "big name" Linux distro, consider BigSlack... the version of ZipSlack
(<A HREF="http://www.slackware.com/zipslack"
	>http://www.slackware.com/zipslack</A>) that includes X and Gnome, but can be
installed directly into a FAT filesystem just using PKunzip.  <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>
has been around a long time and is well known as being friendly for people
who like to work directly with source code.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you decide that because there are lots of Redhat-style packages out there,
you need a redhat compatible system, I guess Mandrake would be worth a try.
Make sure to get a really recent version or buy it direct tho, because they
had some bugs during install that they fixed recently, and you wouldn't want
to get nailed by one just because the local store had a dusty copy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I notice you're not in the U.S. so if English isn't your native language,
maybe there's a localized variant that would be handy for you.  Linux Weekly
News lists a whole bunch of them (<A HREF="http://www.lwn.net"
	>http://www.lwn.net</A>) in its Distributions
sidebar.  Some of the major distros support many languages too.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Backing up the system in its current state is a good idea, not so much
because of the risk (well, yes, there's some, not horridly bad) but because
now is a good time to decide what's important and not on your machine;  it
will be good to have if there's any sort of trouble, not just linux install
issues.  For example, a power outage right when you've almost got things
humming :(
