Hi there,
I have installed lg-all and lg-subscription on my Debian Etch, but I
only have issues 1 to 113 (April 2005) when pointing my browser
to /usr/share/doc/lg/index.html (or <a href="http://localhost/lg/">http://localhost/lg/</a>).
</p>

<p>
Is it normal that I miss issues 114 to 132 (as of today)?
</p>

<p>
Is perhaps the maintainer of the Debian packages still packing all those
missing issues?
</p>

<p>
Or perhaps something is wrong in my system?
</p>

<p>
Thanks for answering.
</p>

More likely those packages haven't migrated into testing yet.  You don't
even need the Debian ones -- just ftp the archives you're missing from
linuxgazette.net -- as linked to from the front page.
