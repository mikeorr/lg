<font color="navy">Xterm Huge Font by Default
</font> </H3>
Date: Sat, 24 Jul 1999 03:59:08 -0700

 <P> When you run X in 1024x768 or 1200x1024 you might notice that 
 a typical xterm comes in a font that's just a bit too small to
 read.

 <P> Of course you can use a [Ctrl]+[Right Mouse Click] to bring up
 a small menu of alternate fonts (ranging from "Tiny" to "Huge")
 to interactively change these to a more (or less) readable
 setting.  However, that gets old after awhile, and it's irritating
 to have to teach that to every new user as we migrate more people
 from those "legacy" systems like MS Windows.

 <P> So, here's how you can change the default font for your xterms.

 <P> Basically all you have to do is add an entry to your "X resource
 database."  The "X resource database" is sort of like your shell
 environment.  
 
 <P> Just as the environment contains a list of values associated 
 with names.  In the case of the environment you have names
 like PATH, TERM, HOME, etc.  The X resource db contains
 patterns like XTerm*foreground:  X applications (clients)
 query the X server and get the patterns that most closely
 match the names of the settings that they are looking for.

 <P> Thus the resource pattern XTerm*foreground: matches 
 XTerm.menu.foreground, XTerm.terminal.foreground and
 XTerm.anything.else.foreground.  So, whatever value this
 resource pattern has (a color, for example) will be used 
 for any settings that don't have a more specific match.
 If you had XTerm*foreground: Cyan and an XTerm.main.foreground
 of Wheat then the "main" windows would be set to "Wheat"
 (an off white color) and all of the others would have a 
 "foreground" color of cyan (a bright bluish green).
 (I'm just making up some of these names, by the way --
 I don't know if xterm looks for any XTerm.main* or
 XTerm.terminal* etc.

 <P> Just as the programs you start under a shell may take
 settings and options from environment variables, so an 
 X client can take settings from the X server's resource
 database.

 <P> When you start your X server, one of of the things the
 typical xdm, xinitrc, ~/.Xclients, or ~/.Xsession will do
 as part of the process is to invoke the xrdb command.  So
 you can set these resources by editing files and restarting
 X.  By default the system will look for a file named ~/.Xdefaults
 and merge those into any settings that are compiled into
 the server.  In fact you can change your resources without restarting
 X by using a command like:
<PRE>
 		xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
</PRE>

<P> So, to change your "normal" font size for your xterms you can
use a setting like:
<PRE>
	XTerm*VT100*font: 10x20
</PRE>

<P> ... there are many other settings (like X XTerm*VT100*font1: through
XTerm*VT100*font6: (which correspond to the tiny, through the 
Huge settings).

<P> You can get a list of (some) resources using the appres command.
Some can be found in the man pages.  There is no comprehensive list
of these that I know of.  I suppose is all in the source code, 
somewhere!

<font color="navy">Redhat 6.0 on a Sharp Widenote
</font> </H3>
Date: Wed, 28 Jul 1999 15:30:38 -0500 (CDT)
<BR>From: jwang@CS.UH.EDU (John I-Chung Wang)


<P> Hello

<P> I've recently installed Redhat 6.0 on a Sharp Widenote after swapping
the factory 1 GB drive for a more suitable 6.4 GB drive purchased over
the web.

<P> The interesting thing about the Widenote is that the display is a
letter box format (16 x 9) screen which has a resolution of 1024x600.
It works just fine at the default 1024x768 settings except that the
lower 168 lines are not visible hence the command panel for the
enlightenment GUI is not easily used.

<P> Various websites on the Internet had proposed XF86Config files but all
of them tried to combine the horizontal modeline arguments of the
1024x768 settings with the vertical modeline arguments of the 800x600
settings. This approach does not work and admittedly, the web pages
advocating those settings stated that they still could not get them
working.

<P> Well, the solution is far more simple. the display is a 1024x768
display in every respect except that only 1024x600 is visible so you
actually want to keep all the timing sections of the 1024x768 modelines
the same, except for the 768 which indicates what can be displayed. So
just use the LCD 1024x768 XF86Config file except change the one 768 to
600 in each modeline for each 1024x768 setting ie.:
<PRE>
	Modeline "1024x768" 44.9 1024 1048 1208 1264 768 776 784 817
</PRE>
becomes:
<PRE>
	Modeline "1024x768" 44.9 1024 1048 1208 1264 600 776 784 817
	                                             ^^^
	                                       only thing changed
</PRE>

<P> Note there are multiple Modeline's for the 1024x768 setting, I changed
all of them to be on the safe side though presumably only one need be
changed, I'm just too lazy to figure out which one. Of course, it does
mean that if you wish to use the full 1024x768 on the external monitor
port, you'll have to swap XF86Config files.

<P> This solves the problem without having to rewrite the XF86Config file
from scratch. I thought I would email the Gazette since I'm too lazy to
mess with authoring web pages at the moment.

<BR>From: Giancarlo Castrataro &lt;weenrdog@bluemarble.net&gt;

<P> To get the suprasonic II modem to function properly, try the following
steps:

<P>
0) Set modem to jumpered config, boot, and back to PNP (this resets PNP
config)<BR>
1) Configure modem properly in windows 9X to reasonable settings...<BR>
2) I used com1/com2, and irq 3<BR>
3) Set bios to PNP OS: NO<BR>
4) Ensure that the modem entry in isapnp.conf is commented out (should
be already)<BR>
5) Use /dev/ttySn and /dev/ttyS(n+1) for each modem respectively<BR>

<P> (step zero is if you are having problems with getting the modem to work
in win9X)

<P> I also have information on getting the modem to work in windows 98 SE.  I
found that all I had to change was one registry key, and shotgun shows up under
the DUN modem types.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	My question is, if you would be so kind, could you go into a little
	more detail.  I know how to run fdisk, that is not the problem, but I
	am a little unclear as to what would go onto the system partition, how
	large to make it and what is considered data files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> The system partition should be about 2G.  That's because if you decide to
take the easy route and install everything from a RH distribution you', they
get automatically shoved into the system partition.

<P> That said, you should understand I'm talking about KDE and GNOME system
libraries and environment files - the core bits of these two.  An application
written for GNOME or KDE can be installed under /usr/local later, after you
download from the net and build it yourself.  But the KDE and GNOME environment
and development files are likely to go under the system directories during
installation.  There's really no reason to change this.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	red hat manual says the boot partition should be about 16meg and the
	root partitiion about 500m - 1 gig.  They state that all apps go on the
	root partition but I don't think that is what I want.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Only the apps *they* install will go there.  Don't bother trying to
separate out the applications to another partition during installation (in
fact, I doubt you can do so).  What you're separating with multiple partitions
is 

<OL>
	<LI> what comes on the installation CD
	<LI> the data you create on your own
	<LI> programs you download and build on your own.
</OL>

<P> Over time, you end up replacing the tools on the CD with newer versions you
download from the net.  In most cases, you'll build and install them under
/usr/local, then use rpm to remove the original version you installed with RH
6.0.  In cases where using rpm to remove the original will break many
dependencies (Perl is a good example of this), you can just install the new
version, they get automatically shoved into the system partition.

<P> That said, you should understand I'm talking about KDE and GNOME system
libraries and environment files - the core bits of these two.  An application

Any clarification would be much appreciated.  I'm what I would call a "liitle
past beginner stage, but not much" Linux user.  I am a developer, mainly on the
Tandem mainframe (about 15 yrs), some windows development and about 2.5 yrs on
Linux using as a workstation and developing.  My only experience has been with
Slackware.

Date: Thu, 22 Jul 1999 16:31:33 +0200 (MET DST)
<BR>From: Frido Ferdinand &lt;frido@euronet.nl&gt;

<P> Just discovered a neat trick to using ssh-key authentication in a nice way,
this will let you connect to remote hosts without typing in your password
all the time. It's also very convienient to make (perl) scripts connect
to remote hosts without using scary .rhosts/rsh combinations.

<P> To use this just do the following:

<PRE>
1 Install ssh
---------------
You can get the source from: ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/
or RPMS from: ftp://ftp.replay.com/pub/crypto/linux/redhat/i386/


2 Run ssh-keygen
----------------
ssh-keygen - authentication key pair generation
Run it and use a good long passPHRASE. (phrase not word)


3 Edit .xinitrc
---------------
Put in your .xinitrc ssh-agent in front of the command

for example 

	# Window Maker default X session startup script 

	PATH="$PATH:/usr/X11R6/bin"

	<STRONG>exec /usr/local/bin/ssh-agent wmaker</STRONG>
	exec /usr/local/bin/xscreensaver -no-splash &amp;

I think that if you use xdm you should edit your .xsession file.
Now every time you start up ssh-agent, the program that will manage your
ssh-keys, will start up in the background.


4 Run ssh-add
-------------
When you're in X just type in your favourite terminal,

ssh-add

It'll ask you for the passphrase of your key, type it in and your
private key will be loaded in memory.



5 Authorize the remote host 
---------------------------
Now on the host to which you want to connect, do the following:

copy the contents of the generated public key (.ssh/identity.pub) 
to the "authorized_keys" file on the remote host. Be sure to set
the permissions of this file to 600. 

Now connect to your remote host with: ssh remote-host. If everything
goes well you won't need to type in your password but still have
a good secure authentication scheme.


6 Examples
----------

Run command 'ls' on remote host:

	ssh remote-host ls

The ssh-agent uses two environment variables: 

	set | grep SSH gives

	SSH_AGENT_PID=10953
	SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-frido/ssh-10952-agent

In your perl script put:

	$ENV{"SSH_AGENT_PID"} = 10953;
	$ENV{"SSH_AUTH_SOCK"} = "/tmp/ssh-frido/ssh-10952-agent";

And you can do:

	$output=`ssh -q remote-host ls` 
	print $output

I normally use this to call other scripts. This way  you can have one script 
which accesses multiple servers !

There's lots of other things you can do with it, just experiment with it !
Thanks to some of my collegues for some great tips.

	I recently attempted to install RedHat Linux 6.0 on a Toshiba Tecra

	the keyboard keys were too "touchy". Many times, it would act like the

	<P> After I used Linux for several days on the notebook, I encountered

	At this point, I decided to reformat and do another install from
	scratch.  This time around, the only changes I made were #1, not to put
	the system in runlevel 5 so it started in X immediately upon boot-up,
	and #2, enabled the apmd service for advanced power management. When
	this install completed, I had problems right away where Linux would
	boot - and then I wouldn't be able to type on the keyboard at all.

<P> I had the same problem on my old notebook (digital Hinote) and Redhat 6.0.
Now I've just installed Linux Mandrake 6.0 on My Tecra 8000 and every thing
works perfect. Mandrake has:
<UL>
	<LI> Linux Kernel version: 2.2.9
	<LI> ld.so version: 1.9.5
	<LI> Glibc: 2.1.1
	<LI> RPM: 3.0.1

	<LI> pgcc version: 1.1.3 (based on egcs 2.91.66)

<P> You can try to update these or simply get Mandrake..

connecting an external PS/2 mouse. So this might also be true in your case.

<P> It's not that difficult as you think it is. Under SUSE you probably have a=
.fvwm-whateverfile in youre home directory, otherwise use the
system.fvwm-whatever-rc file commonly located= in /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fvwm..
Now look for xterm startup instructions (Exec xterm ......) and make sure=
switch "-sb", wich enables the scrollbar, is included. By the way press
CTRL+Middle mouse button on an xterm, and= first function you can set/reset is
"enable scrollbar" no matter what kind of window manager you are using.

<BR>From: "Richard N. Turner" &lt;rnturn@baxter.com&gt;

<P> About the inverted images you get back from Kodak:

<P> You must remember that the image you see through viewfinder of your
camera is actually projected and recorded upside down on the film (just
like it is on your retina) and that's why Kodak stores them that way. 
Just kidding...  I've been getting pictures on Kodak's floppies and have
wondered about the inverted images as well. (The camera /does/ record
them upside down, though.)

<P> Seriously, you can use "xv", which should be available on your RH5.1
CD-ROM, to invert the upside images that you receive on the Kodak disk. 
At least that's what I've used.  It may be possible to pull this off
using the GIMP but I've yet to find such an option among the gazillion
other things it can do.

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[In the GIMP, right-click on the image to get the pop-up menu.  Choose
	"Image / Transforms / Rotate".  Select 180 and press OK. -Ed.]
</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> BTW, I've heard that "xv" may not be part of the newer RH
distributions.  I hope that's not true; I've been using "xv" since I was
running Consensys SVR4.2 on my old '486 and have gotten so used to it. 
I still use it to load JPEGs on my root window and haven't found a
substitute that can do that yet.

<BR>From: sleske@filesvr1-cddi.informatik.uni-essen.de (Leske Sebastian)

<P> If I understand you correctly, the pictures you load from the photo CD
are upside down and you simply want to correct that, i.e. turn them around.
To do that, you can use the 'rotate' function from the 'Transform tool' in gimp.
In principle that lets you do rotation by any angle you want, but by holding
the Ctrl-key, it lets you select the rotation angle in 15-degree steps.
Just rotate the image by 180 degrees, and it should be 'right-side-up'.

<P> As an alternative, consider using the ImageMagick tool (available from just
about any Linux ftp site, and a part of most distributions).  The 'display'
program (part of ImageMagick), has a function to rotate an image by 90 degrees
(key / ), you would just have to do that twice to get the desired effect.  If
you want, you can also automate the process with the 'mogrify' program (also
part of ImageMagick).  To rotate the file picture.jpeg in your currnent
directory, just enter: mogrify -rotate 180 picture.jpeg The advantage of this
is that the process works automatically.  mogrify -rotate 180 *.jpeg for
example, would rotate ALL jpeg-pics in your current directory.  That's probably
easier than doing it by hand for every picture.  You should know, however, that
mogrify overwrites the original picture file with the transformed version, so
if you want to keep the original file, you should copy it first before using
mogrify. (If the files are directly from the CD then you have the CD anyway, so
then you won't need to make a copy).

<P> I hope that helps. I'd like to know whether those tips did the job for you,
maybe you could send me a short mail telling me whether it worked or not.

<P> Kedric,

<P> The default xterm does not include scrollbars when you run it.

<P> You can fix this manually for each xterm by bring up the "VT Options"
menu by holding down "Ctrl" and clicking the middle mouse button (or
chording the left and right buttons if your a two-button mouse user). 
You should see listed as the first menu item "Enable Scrollbar" which,
in your case, is probably unchecked.  Turn it on and you'll get a
scrollbar.

<P> If you always want a scrollbar you'll need to get into the menu
definitions for fvwm95 and fix the command for launching an xterm. 
You'll probably want to include some xterm options so your xterm command
will look something like:
<PRE>
     xterm -sb -sl 512
</PRE>

<P> These options mean:
<PRE>
     -sb        ! Turn on a scrollbar.
     -sl 512    ! Save 512 lines in the scrollback buffer.
</PRE>

<P> See the xterm(1x) for other useful options that you could specify.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	 I have a small home network with 5 systems. I use Linux as my
	 proxy/firewall/dial-upon demand internet server and fileserver. Before
	 I upgraded to RH6 I could go to any site on the Web. Now with RH6 I
	 cannot get to some sites. ie: www.hotmail.com, www.outpost.com and
	 www.iomega.com to name a few. I can get to them from my Linux box but
	 not from the network.  It sends the request and I see some data return
	 but then everything stops. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> I just tried, and those sites worked fine from my Win98 box which is
proxied to the Internet via a RH6 box.

<P> I think perhaps you are missing a few important rules, such as rules to
allow DNS replies.  My own script for enabling masquerading and
firewalling is available at 
<A HREF=http://www.cyberport.com/~tangent/ix/scripts/>
www.cyberport.com/~tangent/ix/scripts/</A>.

<P> That script is quite a bit more complicated than yours, but it offers a
much tighter firewall.  Plus, it's very well commented, so you should
have no trouble modifying it to meet your needs.  You should only have
to modify the variables at the top of the script and leave the rest
alone. 

<P> You should still read through the rest of the script, however, to ensure
that its actions are acceptable to you.  For example, it opens inbound
Web access.  This may be harmless, but if your webserver holds private
documents, you'll want to comment that rule out.

<P> Good luck.

<P> I had a similar problem using my Slack 4.0 box as the masquerading
gateway... looks like your timeouts are ok, but I don't think it hurts to
increase those a little... here's what fixed the problem for me though:

<P> Open your local ethernet init script (for me it's /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1, it's
the file with the ifconfig eth0 lines in it, use grep if you're not sure).
Look for a line similar to this one:

<P> /sbin/route add -net ${NETWORK} netmask ${NETMASK} eth0

<P> This line sets up the eth0 routing table... make it look like this:

<P> /sbin/route add -net ${NETWORK} netmask ${NETMASK} window 8192 eth0

<P> Below or nearby there should also be a line to set up your gateway route,
looking similar to the above.  Do the same thing basically, here's what my
line looks like:

<P> /sbin/route add default gw ${GATEWAY} netmask 0.0.0.0 window 8192

<P> In short, I think the problem has something to do with the packets being
sent from your masq box to the web box being either too large or too small
or are not reassembled correctly... setting this window setting seems to
correct it though!

<P> Hope it works for you...

Subject: Re:  

<P> Your 2-cent tips column in issue 43 contained an answer to a question
about using inetd to bind a given server to a particular address on a
server with several virtual IPs.  While the solution will work if you
just want a given server to work on _one_ of those IPs, you can't, for
example, run two different FTP daemons, each configured differently, and
have inetd choose which ftpd to use depending on the requested IP
address.

<P> The correct answer to the original question is that inetd is not
terribly useful for virtual hosting.  Virtual hosting requires servers
that know how to bind to a single IP address on their own.  You then run
multiple copies of that server, each configured for a different IP
address.

<P> I suppose it's possible to change inetd to allow what the original
poster wanted, but so far as I know none of the alternative inetds does
this.  If you're _really_ interested in this feature, you might want to
join one of the alternative inetd development projects (xinetd looks
closest) and add your feature.  There's a pretty good chance that the
regular inetd people won't be interested in your patch because it would
require changes to the inetd.conf file format.  xinetd has already
changed that format, so they should be open to other changes.

<P> It's not a tip just an observation that I've installed Suse 6.0, RH 5.2 and
then RH 6 on a 10.2 gb drive with now problems at all. The linux partition
was on the last 2 GB of the drive, well outside the 2 gb maximum. The RH
manual states that it's down to the bios as regards whether this will work
or not so I would guess that it's possible on the mojority of new(ish) PC's.
Mine is a year &amp; a half old but worked ok.
The only problem I had was that when I tried to compile a new kernel and
update lilo using yast with suse 6 it then reported the error of the kernel
lying outside the 2gb limit.

<P> Errno 2 means "no such file or directory" (see
/usr/include/asm/errno.h).

<P> The file /etc/X11/X which shoud be a symbolic link to the X server,
does not exist. It implies that your X installation is not complete,
the configuration program has not made the correct link. Most of the
time this is the last thing the configuration program does.

<P> If you know which X server you should use, do the following:
(supposing you use the XF86_S3 server, like I do)
"ln -s /usr/X11R6/bin/XF86_S3 /etc/X11/X"

<P> Now X should start if correctly configured.

<P> you sent an e-mail to the Linux Gazette asking about FAT Compatibility:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	At work I have a Linux (Redhat 6.0) workstation and at home I have a

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Maybe I can help here.  The Linux kernel has built-in FAT support. All you
need to do is to mount the disk (hard disk or floppy disk, it doesn't really
matter) with a FAT filesystem. Then you will be able to access it just like a
Linux disk.

<P> How you do that depends on your system setup. You could either add an
entry to your /etc/fstab file or mount 'by hand' using the mount
command. 

<P> This is explained in detail in the 'DOS-Win-to-Linux-HOWTO', which can be
found at any site of the Linux Documentation Project. A list of
mirrors is at <A HREF=http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/mirrors.html>

Use any mirror and to go the 'Howto' section.
