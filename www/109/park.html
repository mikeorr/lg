<h1>Bash Shell and Beyond</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/park.html">William Park</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>Patching and Compiling Bash Shell</h2>

<p>In a <a href="../108/park.html">previous article</a>, I
presented shell functions which emulate C functions strcat(3),
strcpy(3), strlen(3), and strcmp(3). Since the shell's main job is
to parse text, a pure shell solution was possible for string
operations found in &lt;string.h&gt;. However, this is rare. It's
not always possible to emulate C in shell, especially for accessing
low-level system libraries and third-party applications. Even if it
were possible, you would be re-inventing the wheel by ignoring the
work that has gone into the C libraries. In addition, shell scripts
are, without exception, orders of magnitude slower. But, shell has
the advantage of rapid development and easy maintenance, because
it's easier to write and read.</p>

<p>What is needed, then, is the ability to write a shell wrapper
with binding to C routines. A shell mechanism which allows you to
write a C extension is called a <em>builtin</em>, eg.
<tt>read</tt>, <tt>echo</tt>, and <tt>printf</tt>, etc. When
certain features require changes in the way the shell interprets an
expression, then modifications must be made to the shell's parsing
code. When you need speed, then a C extension is must.</p>

<p>My patch to Bash-3.0 shell is available from</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=
"http://freshmeat.net/projects/bashdiff/">http://freshmeat.net/projects/bashdiff/</a>
--- announcement</li>

<li><a href=
"http://home.eol.ca/~parkw/index.html#bash">http://home.eol.ca/~parkw/index.html#bash</a>
--- documentation</li>
</ul>
The latest tarball <tt><a href=
"misc/park/bashdiff-1.11.tar.gz">bashdiff-1.11.tar.gz</a></tt>
contains 2 diff files:

<ol>
<li>
<p><tt>bashdiff-core-1.11.diff</tt> is for features that will be
compiled into shell statically. It adds new features by modifying
Bash parsing code. It's 100% backward compatible, in that no
existing meaning is changed; so, what works in your old shell, will
also work in the new shell. For example, it adds</p>

<ul>
<li>a new brace expansion {a..b} --- integer/letter generation,
positional parameters and array expansion</li>

<li>new parameter expansion ${var|...} --- content filtering, list
comprehension (like Python)</li>

<li>new command substitution $(=...) --- floating-point hook to
Awk</li>

<li>extended case statement --- regex, continuation, then/else
sections</li>

<li>extended for/while/until loops --- then/else sections, multiple
for-loop variables</li>

<li>try-block with integer exception (like Python)</li>

<li>new &lt;&lt;+ here-document --- relative indentation</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt>bashdiff-william-1.11.diff</tt> is for dynamically loadable
builtins (loadables) which are available separately from your shell
session. It adds new commands, to interface with system and
application libraries and to provide a fast wrapper for common
operations. For example, it adds</p>

<ul>
<li>extended read/echo builtins --- DOS lines</li>

<li>sscanf(3), &lt;string.h&gt; and &lt;ctype.h&gt; wrappers,
ASCII/string conversion</li>

<li>new raise builtin for try-blocks</li>

<li>array cut/splicing, array filter/map/zip/unzip (like
Python)</li>

<li>regex(3) operations --- match, split, search, replace,
callback</li>

<li>HTML template engine (like PHP, JSP, ASP)</li>

<li>GDBM, SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL database interface</li>

<li>Expat XML parser interface</li>

<li>stack/queue operations on arrays and positional parameters</li>

<li>x-y character plot</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
All features are documented in the shell's internal help files,
which can be accessed by the <tt>help</tt> command.

<h3>Compiling</h3>

<p>Before being introduced to a patched shell, you have to know how
to compile from source, since the patch is against source tree.
Here are the steps required to download and compile the standard
Bash-3.0 shell:</p>

<pre>
    wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/bash-3.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzf bash-3.0.tar.gz
    cd bash-3.0
        ./configure
        make
</pre>
You now have a binary executable <tt>bash</tt> which is just like
your current shell, usually <tt>/bin/bash</tt>. You can try it out,
like

<pre>
    ./bash              # using freshly compiled Bash-3.0
    date
    ls
    exit                # back to your old shell session
</pre>

<h3>Patching</h3>

<p>To compile my patched shell the steps are essentially the same
as above. You download a tarball, apply my patch to the source tree
(from the above steps), and compile. <tt>bashdiff.tar.gz</tt> will
always point to the latest patch, which at the moment is
<tt>bashdiff-1.10.tar.gz</tt>.</p>

<pre>
    wget http://home.eol.ca/~parkw/bashdiff/bashdiff-1.10.tar.gz
    tar -xzf bashdiff-1.10.tar.gz
    mv bash-3.0 bash            # it's no longer standard Bash-3.0
    cd bash
        make distclean
        patch -p1 &lt; ../bashdiff-core-1.10.diff
        patch -p1 &lt; ../bashdiff-william-1.10.diff
        autoconf
        ./configure
        make
        make install            # as root
        cd examples/loadables/william
            make
            make install        # as root
            ldconfig            # as root
</pre>
Now, you have

<ul>
<li>
<p><tt>bash</tt> which is the main shell just like before, and it
will be installed as <tt>/usr/local/bin/bash</tt>, and</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt>william.so</tt> which is a shared object containing
loadables, and it will be installed as
<tt>/usr/local/lib/libwilliam.so</tt> with a symbolic link to
<tt>/usr/local/lib/william.so</tt>. There are 33 loadable builtins
in version 1.10, namely</p>

<blockquote>Lsql Msql Psql gdbm xml array arraymap arrayzip
arrayunzip basp match vplot pp_append pp_collapse pp_flip
pp_overwrite pp_pop pp_push pp_rotateleft pp_rotateright pp_set
pp_sort pp_swap pp_transpose sscanf strcat strcpy strlen strcmp
tonumber tostring chnumber isnumber</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Dynamically loadable builtins</h3>

<p>If your shell has 'enable -[fd]', then you can load/unload
builtin commands dynamically, hence the name. Usage is simple. For
example,</p>

<pre>
    enable -f william.so vplot
</pre>
will load <tt>vplot</tt> command from the shared library
<tt>william.so</tt> which you just compiled and installed. Use
'./william.so' if you haven't installed it yet. Once loaded, you
can use them just like standard builtin commands which are
statically linked into the shell. So,

<pre>
    help vplot
    help -s vplot
</pre>
will print the long and short help file for the command,

<ul>
<li><tt>vplot [-0 -x columns -y lines -X xtitle -Y ytitle] {xy | x
y | x1 y1 x2 y2 ...}</tt>
</li>
</ul>
and

<pre>
    x=( `seq -100 100` )
    y=( `for i in ${x[*]}; do echo $((i*i)); done` )    # y = x^2
    vplot x y
</pre>
will print an x-y character plot of a parabolic curve on your
terminal. To unload,

<pre>
    enable -d vplot
</pre>

<h3>All-in-one</h3>

<p>Loadables are convenient if you just want to load the builtins
you need and don't want to or can't change your login shell. Also,
loadables are easier to compile incrementally, which is important
since new builtins are added or updated more often than the main
parsing code of the shell.</p>

<p>However, you may want to compile and link everything into a
single executable, say on Windows for an example. To compile an
"all-in-one" binary, you have to type a bit more. You still have to
generate the default <tt>bash</tt> binary, because you need all
those .h and .o files.</p>

<pre>
    cd bash
        make bash
        make bash+william       # all in one
        make install-bin        # installs only 'bash', 'bashbug', 'bash+william'
</pre>
Here, <tt>bash+william</tt> is like <tt>bash</tt>, but with all
builtins linked statically into it. I recommend single binary
<tt>bash+william</tt> for newbies, because you don't have to
remember what to load and unload. Everything is at your fingertips.

<h2>strcat, strcpy, strlen, and strcmp</h2>

<p>In a previous article, you've seen strcat(3), strcpy(3),
strlen(3), and strcmp(3) as shell functions. Now, shell version of
those C functions are also available as builtins.</p>

<pre>
    enable -f william.so strcat strcpy strlen strcmp
    help strcat strcpy strlen strcmp
</pre>
You will discover that command usage is the same as shell
functions, except for '-i' option in <tt>strcmp</tt> for case
insensitive comparison, i. e.

<ul>
<li><tt>strcat var string [a:b]</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>strcpy var string [a:b]</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>strlen string...</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>strcmp [-i] string1 string2 [a:b]</tt>
</li>
</ul>
For example,

<pre>
    strcpy a abc
    strcat a 123
    echo $a                             # abc123
    strcmp $a abc123
    strlen abc123 0123456789            # 6 10
</pre>

<p>If you have both a shell function and a shell builtin with the
same name, then the shell function will take priority. To find out
what is what,</p>

<pre>
    type strcat strcpy strlen strcmp
</pre>
and to delete shell functions,

<pre>
    unset -f strcat strcpy strlen strcmp
</pre>

<p>To compare their speed,</p>

<pre>
    . string.sh
    a=; time for i in `seq 10000`; do builtin strcat a "$i "; done
    b=; time for i in `seq 10000`; do strcat b "$i "; done
    strlen "$a" "$b"            # 48894 48894
    strcmp "$a" "$b"
</pre>
You'll find that the shell function is only about 5x slower, which
is pretty good since we're talking about shell script vs. C. But,
if you use substring options,

<pre>
    a=; time for i in `seq 10000`; do builtin strcat a "$i " 1:-1; done
    b=; time for i in `seq 10000`; do strcat b "$i " 1:-1; done
    strlen "$a" "$b"            # 28894 28894
    strcmp "$a" "$b"
</pre>
there will be a 25x difference.

<h2>ASCII and &lt;ctype.h&gt;</h2>

<p>Although string operations are easy in shell, it's generally
difficult to examine and manipulate individual characters of the
string. Also, printing the full range of ASCII chars (0-127) and
high-bit chars (128-255) is difficult, because you have to use
octal, hex, or backslash-escaped characters if they are not
printable. Capitalizing a word, for an example, is unbelievably
verbose in regular shell,</p>

<pre>
    word=abc123
    first=`echo ${word:0:1} | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'`
    rest=`echo ${word:1} | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'`
    echo $first$rest
</pre>
which only works in English locales, because of explicit [a-z] and
[A-Z] ranges. In C, however, this is simple matter of calling
isupper(3), islower(3), toupper(3), and tolower(3), which work in
all locales that the C library supports.

<p>What we need are shell wrappers for all those standard C functions -
<code>toupper(3), tolower(3), toascii(3), toctrl(),
isalnum(3), isalpha(3), isascii(3), isblank(3), iscntrl(3),
isdigit(3), isgraph(3), islower(3), isprint(3), ispunct(3),
isspace(3), isupper(3), isxdigit(3), and isword()</code>.
Most of these are defined in &lt;ctype.h&gt;, so that character
operations can be done simply and efficiently.

<ul>
<li><tt>tonumber string...</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>tostring [-v var] number...</tt>
<p>I decided to follow 'od', and convert strings into sequences of
ASCII numbers (0-255). <tt>tonumber</tt> prints the ASCII number of
each char in 'string', much like 'od -A n -t dC'. These are now
whitespace-delimited fields which are much easier to work with in
shell. In reverse, <tt>tostring</tt> converts each 'number' to an
ASCII character. If the -v option is specified, the output will be
saved in 'var' variable. Eg.</p>

<pre>
    tonumber ABC                # 65 66 67
    tostring 65 66 67           # ABC
</pre>

<p>One notable feature about <tt>tostring</tt> is that it can
handle the null byte (\0), so you can write shell scripts to handle
binary data, like</p>

<pre>
    tostring 65 00 97 | od -c           # A \0 a
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt>chnumber { toupper | tolower | toascii | toctrl }
[number...]</tt>
</p>

<p>Shell versions of toupper(3), tolower(3), and others in
&lt;ctype.h&gt;. These read numbers and print converted numbers
according to options which are the same name as those of the
corresponding C functions, e.g.</p>

<pre>
    tonumber aA                 # 97 65
    chnumber toupper 97 65      # convert to uppercase: 65 65
    chnumber tolower 97 65      # convert to lowercase: 97 97
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt>isnumber { alnum | alpha | ascii | blank | cntrl | digit |
graph | lower | print | punct | space | upper | xdigit | word }
[number...]</tt>
</p>

<p>Shell versions of isupper(3), islower(3), and others in
&lt;ctype.h&gt;. They read numbers and return success or failure,
according to options which are the names of the corresponding C
functions without the 'is' prefix. Eg.</p>

<pre>
    isnumber upper 65                   # is 'A' uppercase?
    isnumber upper 97                   # is 'a' uppercase?
    isnumber alnum 97 98 99 49 50 51    # is 'abc123' alphanumeric?
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the above example of capitalizing a word becomes</p>

<pre>
    set -- `tonumber abc123`
    set -- `chnumber toupper $1; shift; chnumber tolower $*`
    tostring $* 10              # add \n for terminal
</pre>
which is much more efficient and understandable.

<p>Now that Bash has pretty good coverage of &lt;string.h&gt; and
&lt;ctype.h&gt;, you can do string and character operations in
shell script much the same way as in C code. Both text and binary
data are handled with ease and consistency. This alone represents a
vast improvement over the standard shell.</p>

<h2>Formatted I/O</h2>

<h3>sscanf</h3>

<p>One of the first things you learn in any language is reading and
printing. In C, you use printf(3), scanf(3), and others defined in
&lt;stdio.h&gt;. For printing in the shell, you use <tt>echo</tt> and
<tt>printf</tt> builtins. Curiously, though, a shell version of
scanf(3) is missing. For example, to parse out 4 numbers of
11.22.33.44, you can do</p>

<pre>
    IFS=. read a b c d &lt;&lt;&lt; 11.22.33.44
</pre>
However, if the field you want is not nicely delimited as above,
then it gets complicated.

<p>I've added shell version of C function sscanf(3):</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>sscanf input format var1 [... var9]</tt>
</li>
</ul>
Since the shell only has the string data type, it supports only string
formats, i. e. %s, %c, %[...], %[^...], and up to 9 variables. So,
you can parse formatted strings just like the way you would in C,
eg.

<pre>
    sscanf 11.22.33.44 '%[0-9].%[0-9].%[0-9].%[0-9]' a b c d
    declare -p a b c d          # a=11 b=22 c=33 d=44

    sscanf 'abc 123 45xy' '%s %s %[0-9]%[a-z]' a b c d
    declare -p a b c d          # a=abc b=123 c=45 d=xy
</pre>

<h3>Reading and printing DOS lines</h3>

<p>From time to time, you have to print and read DOS lines which end
with \r\n (CR/NL). Although you can print \r explicitly, the
automatic insertion of \r just before \n is difficult in shell. For
reading, you need to explicitly remove the trailing \r.</p>

<p>I've patched standard <tt>echo</tt> and <tt>read</tt> builtins
to read and print DOS lines:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>echo [-...] -D [arg ...]</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>read [-...] -D [name ...]</tt>
</li>
</ul>
For example,

<pre>
    echo abc | od -c                    # a b c \n
    echo -D abc | od -c                 # a b c \r \n

    read a b &lt;&lt;&lt; $'11 22 \r'            # a=11 b=$'22 \r'
    read -D a b &lt;&lt;&lt; $'11 22 \r'         # a=11 b=22
</pre>

<h3>Simple Awk emulation</h3>

<p>Often, you need to parse lines and work with Awk-style variables
like NF, NR, $1, $2, ..., $NF. However, when you use Awk, it's
difficult to bring those variables back into shell; you have to
write them to a temporary file in shell syntax and then source it.
Because of this, it's a hassle to jump back and forth between shell
and Awk.</p>

<p>I've patched the standard <tt>read</tt> builtin to provide
simple Awk emulation, creating NF and NR variables and assigning
the fields to $1, $2, ..., $NF.</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>read [-...] -A [name ...]</tt>
</li>
</ul>
For example,

<pre>
    IFS=. read -A &lt;&lt;&lt; 11.22.33.44
    echo $#: $*                 # 4: 11 22 33 44
    declare -p NF NR
</pre>
And, just like Awk, each call to <tt>read -A</tt> will increment
NR.

<h3>Indentation in &lt;&lt; here-document</h3>

<p>'&lt;&lt;' is the input redirection operator, where standard
input is taken from actual text in the script source. '&lt;&lt;'
will preserve the leading whitespaces, and '&lt;&lt;-' will remove
all leading tabs. The problem with '&lt;&lt;-' is that relative
indentation is lost.</p>

<p>I've added a new operator '&lt;&lt;+' which preserves tab
indentation of the here-document relative to the first line. This
is available directly from the shell (i. e. <tt>./bash</tt> or
<tt>/usr/local/bin/bash</tt>), because it's patched into the main
parsing code. So,</p>

<pre>
    cat &lt;&lt;+ EOF
            first line
                    second line
    EOF
</pre>
will print

<pre>
    first line
            second line
</pre>

<h2>Sequence Generators {a..b} and {a--b}</h2>

<h3>Integer sequence {a..b}</h3>

<p>Bash-3.0 (and Zsh) have the '{a..b}' expression which generates
an integer sequence as part of the brace expansion, but you can't
use variable substitution because the '{a..b}' expression must
contain explicit integers.</p>

<p>My patch extends the brace expansion to include variable,
parameter, and array substitution, as well as a single letter
sequence generator. For example,</p>

<pre>
    a=1 b=10 x=a y=b
        echo {1..10}
        echo {a..b}
        echo {!x..!y}           # use 'set +H' to suppress ! expansion
    set -- `seq 10`
        echo {**}
        echo {##}
        echo {1..#}
    z=( `seq 10` )
        echo {^z}
</pre>
all produce the same result, i. e. 1 2 ... 10. More details are
available from the help file:

<pre>
    help '{a..b}'
</pre>

<p>One useful application might be in downloading a bunch of images
from a website. There are so many family-oriented sites on the Web,
it's difficult to recommend one. When you find one chock full of
educational content, you can try</p>

<pre>
    wget -x http://your.favourite.site/conception/pic{001..200}.jpeg
</pre>
so that you can continue your private study (as allowed by the
Copyright Act of your country) later when you have more time.

<h3>Letters sequence {a--b}</h3>

<p>In addition to integers, you can also generate a sequence of
single letters using the '{a--b}' variation, where 'a' and 'b' are
explicit letters as recognized by isletter(3) in &lt;ctype.h&gt;.
Eg.</p>

<pre>
    echo {A--z}         # A B C ... z
</pre>
skipping any non-letters (if exist) between the end points.

<h2>Content Filtering ${var|...}</h2>

<p>This is called <em>list comprehension</em> in Python and
functional languages. Essentially, it's way of generating a list
from another list. For each list element, you can change the
content or choose not to include it all.</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>${var|command}</tt>
<p>By default, the output of command substitution `command var` is
used in the parameter expansion, instead of the original string. If
the stdout is empty, then it is removed from the expansion. Here,
'var' can be anything that can appear in other parameter
expansions, i. e. ${var:...}, ${var#...}, ${var%...}, and
${var/...}. 'command' is anything you can type on your command
line, i. e. alias, shell function, builtin command, external
command, and shell scripts. So,</p>

<pre>
    b=( `date` )
    func () { tr 'a-zA-Z' 'A-Za-z' &lt;&lt;&lt; "$1"; }
    echo ${b[*]|func}           # switch case of letters

    set -- `date`
    func () { [[ $1 == *[!0-9]* ]] || echo $(( $1 + 1 )); }
    echo ${*|func}              # only numbers, and incremented by 1
</pre>
This is similar to what's available in functional languages, except
it's implemented in the shell framework. Unfortunately, command
substitution doesn't preserve whitespace, because it captures
stdout.</li>

<li>
<p><tt>${var|?command}</tt>
</p>

<p>When 'command' follows immediately after '?', then the original
string is included in the parameter expansion only if 'command var'
returns success (0). If not, then it's removed from the expansion.
The content is not changed, but you can decide whether to include
it or not. Therefore, ${var|?true} will be equivalent to ${var},
since 'true' always returns success (0). Eg.</p>

<pre>
    b=( `date` )
    func () { [[ $1 == [A-Z]* ]]; }
    echo ${b[*]|?func}          # only capitalized words

    set -- `date`
    func () { [[ $1 == *[!0-9]* ]]; }
    echo ${*|?func}             # only non-numbers
</pre>
</li>

<li><tt>${var|/regex}</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>${var|=glob}</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>${var|~regex}</tt>
</li>

<li><tt>${var|!glob}</tt>
<p>As a special case of filtering, you can specify a glob(7) or
regex(7) pattern to be matched against items in the variable:
${var|=glob} and ${var|/regex} will include the string only if
there is a match; conversely, ${var|!glob} and ${var|~regex} will
include the string only if there is no match. The above examples
can be rewritten as</p>

<pre>
    b=( `date` )
    echo ${b[*]|=[A-Z]*}        # only capitalized words

    set -- `date`
    echo ${*|=*[!0-9]*}         # only non-numbers
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<p><tt>${var|:a:b}</tt>
</p>

<p>You can extract a Python-style [a:b] range using ${var|:a:b}
which is similar to standard shell syntax ${var:a:n}. If 'var' is
string, then it will be a substring; if 'var' is list, then it will
be sublist. Eg.</p>

<pre>
    a=0123456789
    echo ${a|::3} ${a|:-3:} ${a|:1:-1}          # 012 789 12345678

    set -- {a--z}
    echo ${*|::3} ${*|:-3:} ${*|:1:-1}
</pre>
will print the first 3, the last 3, and all except the first and
the last, respectively, chars or list elements.</li>

<li>
<p><tt>${var|*n}</tt>
</p>

<p>When you need to duplicate a string or a list, then ${var|*n}
will copy string or list 'n' times. Eg.</p>

<pre>
    a=abc123
    echo ${a|*3}                # 3 times

    set -- a b c
    echo ${*|*2+3}              # 5 times
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Case Statement</h2>

<h3>regex pattern</h3>

<p>Syntax of standard 'case' statement is</p>

<pre>
    case WORD in
        glob [| glob]...) COMMANDS ;;
        ...
    esac
</pre>
I have extended the syntax to

<pre>
    case WORD in
        glob [| glob]...) COMMANDS ;;
        regex [| regex]...)) COMMANDS ;;
        ...
    esac
</pre>
so that the pattern list will be interpreted as 'regex' if it's
terminated by double parenthesis '))'. Other than that, it works
like before. Although Bash-3.0 has [[ string =~ regex ]], a case
statement is still better syntax for two or more patterns, or if you
need to test for both 'glob' and 'regex' in the same context.

<p>Whereas 'glob' matches the entire string in order to return
success, 'regex' can match a substring. If there is a match, then
array variable SUBMATCH will contain the matching substring in
SUBMATCH[0] and any parenthesized groups in 'regex' pattern in
SUBMATCH[1], SUBMATCH[2], etc. For example,</p>

<pre>
    case .abc123. in
        '([a-z]+)([0-9]+)' )) echo yes ;;
    esac
    declare -p SUBMATCH
</pre>
will match successfully, and

<ul>
<li><tt>SUBMATCH[0]=abc123</tt>, the entire regex
'([a-z]+)([0-9]+)'</li>

<li><tt>SUBMATCH[1]=abc</tt>, the first group '([a-z]+)'</li>

<li><tt>SUBMATCH[2]=123</tt>, the second group '([0-9]+)'</li>
</ul>

<h3>Continuation</h3>
In Zsh and Ksh, you can continue on with the next command list if
you use ';&amp;' instead of ';;'. So,

<pre>
    case WORD in
        pattern1) command1 ;&amp;
        pattern2) command2 ;;
        ...
    easc
</pre>
'command1' will run if 'pattern1' matches. After that, execution
will continue on to 'command2' and subsequent command list, until
it encounters double semi-colon. Now, Bash can do it too.

<p>In addition, when you terminate command list with ';;&amp;',</p>

<pre>
    case WORD in
        pattern1) command1 ;;&amp;
        pattern2) command2 ;;
        ...
    easc
</pre>
'command1' will run if 'pattern1' matches. After that, execution
will continue on to testing 'pattern2' instead of exiting the case
statement. Therefore, it will test all of the pattern list, whether
or not there was a successful match. Zsh and Ksh don't have this
feature. :-)

<h3>Exit condition</h3>

<p>Often, you need to know the exit condition of a 'case'
statement. You can use '*)' as a default pattern, but it's not
straightforward to find out if there was a match as you're coming
out of the 'case' statement. With my patch, you can add an optional
'then' and 'else' section at the end of 'case' statement right
after 'esac', and treat the 'case' statement as big 'if' statement.
The new syntax goes something like</p>

<ul>
<li>
<pre>
case ... in             case ... in             case ... in
    ...                     ...                     ...
esac then               esac then               esac else
    COMMANDS                COMMANDS                COMMANDS
else                    fi                      fi
    COMMANDS
fi
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
where 'esac then' and 'esac else' cannot be separated by ';' or
newlines. The then-COMMANDS will be executed if there was a match,
or else-COMMANDS will be executed if there was no match.

<p>For example,</p>

<pre>
    case abc123 in
        [A-Z]*) echo matched ;;
    esac then
        echo yes
    else
        echo no         # no match
    fi
</pre>
will print 'no', but

<pre>
    case Xabc123 in
        [A-Z]*) echo matched ;;         # match
    esac then
        echo yes                        # match
    else
        echo no
    fi
</pre>
will print 'matched' and 'yes'.

<h2>For/While/Until Loops</h2>

<h3>Multi-variable for-loop</h3>

<p>In standard shell, you can only use one variable in a 'for'
loop. I added multi-variable syntax, so that</p>

<pre>
    for a,b,c in {1..10}; do
        echo $a $b $c
    done
</pre>
will print

<pre>
    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9
    10
</pre>
as you expect. Here, the variables must be separated by comma. If
there is shortage of items to assign in the last iteration, the
leftover variables will be assigned the empty (null) string.

<h3>Exit condition</h3>

<p>Just like the 'case' statement, you often need to know if you
exited the loop normally or through the use of 'break'. With my
patch, you can add optional 'then' and 'else' sections at the end
of 'for', 'while', and 'until' loops right after 'done'. The new
syntax goes something like</p>

<ul>
<li>
<pre>
[for|while|until] ...; do       [for|while|until] ...; do       [for|while|until] ...; do
    ...                             ...                             ...
done then                       done then                       done else
    COMMANDS                        COMMANDS                        COMMANDS
else                            fi                              fi
    COMMANDS
fi
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
where 'done then' and 'done else' cannot be separated by ';' or
newlines. Here, then-COMMANDS will be executed if the loop exited
normally, and else-COMMANDS will be executed if 'break' was used.
By "normal", I mean the 'for' loop exhausted all list items, the
'while' test failed, or the 'until' test succeeded.

<p>For example,</p>

<pre>
    for i in 1 2 3; do
        echo $i
        break
    done then
        echo normal
    else
        echo used break         # 1 
    fi
</pre>
will print '1' only for the first iteration, then it will break out
of the loop. But,

<pre>
    for i in 1 2 3; do
        echo $i
    done then
        echo normal             # 1 2 3
    else
        echo used break
    fi
</pre>
will print all items '1 2 3', and the exit condition will be
normal. The same applies to 'while' and 'until' loops.

<p>The ability to test the exit condition improves the readability
of shell scripts, because you don't have to use a variable as a
flag. Python has a similar mechanism for testing the exit condition
of a loop, but it uses the return value of the test. So, a 'while'
loop exits when the test fails, and Python uses 'else' for the
normal exit condition, which is a bit confusing.</p>

<h2>Exception and Try Block</h2>

<p>Practically every modern language has ability to raise an
<em>exception</em> to break out of deeply nested code, to handle
errors, or to do multi-point jumps. I added a new 'try' block to
Bash which will catch integer exceptions raised by a new 'raise'
builtin.</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>raise [n]</tt>
</li>

<li>
<pre>
try
    COMMANDS
done in 
    NUMBER [| NUMBER]... ) COMMANDS ;;
    ...
esac
</pre>
where 'done in' cannot be separated by ';' or newlines. Also, the
pattern list in the case-like statement must be an explicit integer
number.</li>
</ul>

<p>This combines elements of loops, the break builtin and the case
statement. Within a try-block, the 'raise' builtin can be used to
raise an integer exception. Then, the execution will break out of
the try block, just like 'break'ing out of for/until/while loops.
You can use an optional case-like statement to catch the exception.
If the exception is caught, then it will be reset and execution
will continue following the try-block. If the exception is not
caught, then execution will break out upward until it is caught or
until there are no more try-blocks.</p>

<p>For examples,</p>

<pre>
    try
        echo a
        while true; do  # infinite loop
            echo aa
            raise
            echo bb
        done
        echo b
    done
</pre>
will print 'a aa', and

<pre>
    try
        echo a
        raise 2
        echo b
    done in
        0) echo normal ;;
        1) echo raised one ;;
        2) echo raised two ;;   # raise 2
    esac
</pre>
will print 'a' and the exception is 2.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In the next article, I'll cover dynamically-loadable builtins
related to arrays, regex splitting, interfacing to external
libraries like an SQL database and an XML parser, and some
interesting applications like HTML templates and a POP3 spam
checker.</p>

I learned Unix using the original Bourne shell.  And, after my
journey through language wilderness, I have come full-circle
back to shell.  Recently, I've been patching features into Bash,
giving other scripting languages a run for their money.

Slackware has been my primary distribution since the beginning,
because I can type.  In my toolbox, I have Vim, Bash, Mutt, Tin,
TeX/LaTeX, Python, Awk, Sed.  Even my shell command line is in
Vi-mode.
