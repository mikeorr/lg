<h1>Getting Started with Linux Mint</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/lazar.html">Shane Lazar</a></b></p>

<p>This is my second article aimed at new users of the <a
href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a>
distribution. My <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/136/lazar.html">first
article</a> is on installing a dual-boot setup with Linux Mint and
Windows XP. In this article, I would like to talk you through some basic
things one should know about using Linux Mint, and generally just help
you be productive in your new OS environment. I am going to direct my
articles toward a single home PC connected to the Internet, with
multiple users.</p>

<p>Although the desktop environment in modern day Linux is intuitive and
more or less easy to navigate through, for someone coming from Windows
XP, we must keep in mind that the two OSs are different at the 'roots',
even though at the surface they may seem similar. At first, the way
somethings are done in Linux might seem quirky.</p>

<p>One immediate difference you will notice is that Linux always asks
you for an administrator's password when performing changes to the
system. This may seem like an annoyance coming from Windows, but it is to
make sure nobody makes changes that could break your system, including
the administrator (by accident of course) and malicious software.
However, to ease things up a bit, once entered, Linux Mint will maintain
administrator mode for 15 minutes, and will not ask you for the password
in this period. The administrator is the user you created during the
installation.</p>

<p>I urge you to persevere a little, as once you have set everything up,
you will not be asked for the password unless system changes are
required. As you use Linux, you will (at least I did) realize that
Linux today is an easy, secure, and convenient solution for your
computing needs. Let us move on, to using Linux Mint.</p>

<h4>mintMenu</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/1.png" border="0" alt="the mint menu" width= "357" height="254"></p>

<p>Your primary interaction with your computer is the menu at the bottom
left labeled 'Bianca'. This menu (<em>mintMenu</em>) is unique to Linux
Mint, and I must say they have developed a very easy and efficient menu
system. The menu has been neatly divided into three sections: Places,
System, and Applications. 

<ul>

<li><p>The items under <strong>Places</strong> logically opens the file
manager, <em>Nautilus</em>, in the respective locations.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>System</strong> houses the Application Installer
(<em>Synaptic Package Manager</em>), the Control Center
(<em>mintConfig</em>), <em>Terminal</em>, Lock, and Quit dialogues. I
shall expand on some of these, later.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>Applications</strong> section, in true Linux
tradition, groups applications according to their use. This, in my eyes,
has always been a plus point for Linux over Windows: a very simple idea,
but very effective. Also, newly installed applications are automatically
placed in their respective categories. In keeping with simplicity, most
application names are simplified with their use in mind, e.g., <em>Movie
Player</em>, which is actually <em>Totem Movie Player</em>. <br>A
brilliant touch to <em>mintMenu</em> is the search field at the bottom.
When you enter text here, the list of applications is filtered, finding
what you are looking for. If you know what application you are looking
for, you could type its name, <em>Firefox</em>, for example. However, if you
don't know the name of the application, you could also type the task you
wish to perform! For example, typing <tt>hardware</tt> gives you
<em>Device Manager</em>, <tt>command</tt> gives you <em>Terminal</em>,
<tt>spreadsheet</tt> gives you <em>OpenOffice Calc</em>, etc. Although
it is not all-inclusive, it is a handy feature for newcomers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/2.png" border="0" alt="search
application" width= "466" height="383"></p>

<p>Further, entering something and then hitting <tt>Enter</tt> opens the
search application and searches your home folder for the string you have
entered, even searching inside documents, logged IM conversations,
contacts, and more. This uses an indexing service called <em>Beagle</em>
that runs continuously in the background. I am not a big fan of such
non-essential applications that run continuously in the background, and
eliminate their need by organizing and naming my files properly. So, I
usually turn <em>Beagle</em> off and use the command-line interface
(CLI) -based search tool called <em>slocate</em>. However, I have seen
situations when it can be useful, and I have used it before. Point being
that it all boils down to <strong>choice</strong>.</p></li>

</ul>

<h4>Networking</h4>

<p>In today's world, a computer not networked is like an airplane without
wings: you're not going to get very far without networking. If your
network is a wired Ethernet one with <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP" target="_blank">DHCP</a>
(automatically assigned IP addresses), Linux Mint should have already
set everything up for you nicely. Some ISPs require you to configure a
static IP address. You will need the following information about your
connection: your IP address, Subnet mask, Gateway address, and DNS
server address.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/3.png" border="0" alt="network
configuration tool" width= "577" height="403"></p>

<p> Open the <em>Control Center</em>, and click on the
<tt>Networking</tt> button, which will take you to the page with the
network configuration tools. Select the first tool labeled
<tt>Networking</tt>. It will prompt you to enter the administrator's
password. The tool opens with a tab displaying all your networking
hardware. Select <tt>Wired connection</tt>, and click
<tt>Properties</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/4.png" border="0" alt="enter
network settings" width= "250" height="166"></p>

<p>Set your connection as <tt>Static IP address</tt> from the drop-down
list, enter the settings appropriately, tick <tt>Enable this
connection</tt>, and accept the settings.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/5.png" border="0" alt="enter DNS
settings" width= "328" height="245"></p>

<p>Then, select the DNS tab, enter your ISP's DNS server address in the
first row, and hit <tt>Enter</tt>. Some ISPs may have more than one DNS
server, and you can add them by clicking <tt>Add</tt>, which will create a
second field for entering a DNS server. Repeat for other DNS servers.
Click <tt>Close</tt>, and you should be done! Fire up Firefox, and try
browsing your favorite Web site, or at least one that will be up for sure.
My default is the <a href="http://www.google.com"
target="_blank"/>Google homepage</a>. If it does not work, you could try
rebooting.</p>

<p>If you use a wireless connection, Linux Mint comes with a specialized
configuration tool, <em>mintWifi</em>, and a comprehensive guide to get
it working. Enter the following location in the <em>Firefox</em> address
bar <b>while in Linux Mint</b>, to access this guide
(<tt>file:///usr/lib/linuxmint/mintWifi/index.html</tt>). If you are
relying on an internal dial-up modem for Internet access, then the solution is
slightly more complicated: You can follow the <a
href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto"
target="_blank"/>Ubuntu HowTo</a> to try and get it working. Linux's
problem in this area is not due to its shortcomings, but rather the
refusal of hardware manufacturers to provide drivers for them. This is
why the community is fighting for open-sourced drivers. The dedicated
Linux developers have even <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/7636"
target="_blank"/>offered to make the drivers for free</a>! Slowly but
surely, the community is making advances in this field.</p>

<p>If you are still facing problems, do not hesitate to ask questions on
the multitude of community-supported help sites. There is a <a
href="http://www.linuxmint.com/forum/" target="_blank">forum</a> that is
supported by and dedicated to Linux Mint. See the links section at the
top right of my blog for <a href="http://www.linuxquestions.org"
target="_blank">my favorite Linux forum</a>. Friendly and helpful people
abound in the Linux community and it is on the shoulders of these giants
that Linux stands.</p>

<h4>Updating</h4>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/6.png" border="0" alt="update
notification" width= "278" height="66"></p>

<p>I am sure by now you have seen a little orange square and a pop-up,
informing you that updates are available for Linux Mint. Until we got
the network up and running, there was no way to update your OS. Since
we've now got access to the Internet, we will proceed with updating.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/7.png" border="0" alt="update
manager" width= "275" height="377"></p>

<p>This is a no-brainer, and all it requires is clicking the orange icon
and entering your administrator's password. This opens the <em>Software
Updates</em> dialogue that shows you what updates are available,
categorizes them according to importance, and tells you how big the
download is. You have the option of deselecting updates, but, unless you
are restricted by your Internet connection, it would be unwise to do so.
Click <tt>Install Updates</tt>, and the application downloads, installs,
and configures everything just right.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/8.png" border="0" alt="reboot
dialogue" width= "212" height="91"></p>

<p>Sometimes, when core system updates are made, as is the case with the
first Linux Mint update, you will be required to restart your computer
for them to take effect. The <em>Update Manager</em> will inform you
when this is necessary, and the orange icon is replaced with a blue
reboot icon.</p>

<p>The beauty of the <em>Update Manager</em> is that it automatically
keeps track of available updates without any input from you. When
updates are available, you will get a visit from the little orange icon,
and will have to follow the same steps. So, your system is always fitted
with the latest versions of software, patches and fixes. As I said, it's
a no-brainer!</p>

<h4>Mounting Windows Partitions</h4>

<p>Here, I am writing pretty much blind and from speculation. This is
because I do not have Windows installed on my computer, as you may have
gathered from my first article. I suppose Linux Mint mounts your Windows
partitions during the install, and everything should be setup properly.
The default mount points for the partitions are <tt>/media/hda1,
/media/hda2</tt>, and so forth. Linux Mint also creates links to the
partitions on your Desktop labeled <tt>hda1</tt>, <tt>hda2</tt>, etc.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/9.png" border="0" alt="mintDisk"
width= "358" height="253"></p>

<p>However, if your partitions are not mounted, a tool is provided that
will enable you to do so. It is called <em>mintDisk</em>, and can be
found in the menu under <tt>Applications &gt; Administration</tt> or in the
<em>Control Center</em> under the <em>Hardware</em> tab. Once you start
<em>mintDisk</em>, you will be prompted for the administrator's password,
and <em>mintDisk</em> opens up. There are fields available for
configuring various options, but, unless you know what you are doing, it is
better to leave them alone and simply click <tt>OK</tt>. If the
partitions are not mounted immediately, they will be after the next
reboot. Again, I apologize but I have no way of testing this, first
hand.</p>

<p><em>mintDisk</em> will mount your NTFS and FAT32 partitions with read
and write permissions. Practically, what this means is that you will be
able to browse, open, modify, create, or delete files and folders in your
Windows partitions, i.e., you will have full access to them.</p>

<h4>Installing NVIDIA and ATI Graphic Card Drivers</h4>

<p>Both Windows XP and Linux Mint come with a wide range of drivers for
various graphic cards. While these will give you basic functionality, in
order to get the most out of 3D-accelerated cards you will need to
install the drivers provided by the manufacturer. As you may know, the
most popular graphic card manufacturers on the market today are NVIDIA
and ATI. You will have to know which one you have (NVIDIA or ATI), in
order to install the correct driver. If, like me, you have a low end
graphics card, you will <strong>not</strong> need to install any other
drivers as they are well supported with Open Source drivers. These 
low-end cards include SiS, Intel, and others that escape my memory 
right now - generally anything not NVIDIA or ATI.
<a href="#1"><strong>[1]</strong></a></p>

<p>Since I do not have an NVIDIA or ATI card, I cannot give you a 
first-hand account of what you should do, but, apparently it is as
simple as most of the other tools in Linux Mint, albeit a little
different. The tool in question is <em>Envy</em>. Linux Mint (at the
time of writing) comes with an older version (0.8.x). The newer version
is way too easy to ignore, so I'll guide you as far as I can using
that.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/10.png" border="0" alt="envy home
page" width= "600" height="450"></p>

<p>First, we will get the new version from the <a
href="http://www.albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html"
target="_blank">author's Web site</a>. You can read through the brief
description of <em>Envy</em>, to have an idea of what this brilliant tool
does. <em>Envy</em> was written for Ubuntu, but since Linux Mint is
dedicated to maintaining compatibility with Ubuntu, it will work fine.
The download section follows the description of <em>Envy</em> (as shown
in the screenshot). Linux Mint 2.2 Bianca is based on the latest version
of Ubuntu, which is Ubuntu "Edgy Eft" 6.10. Simply go with the latest
version of Ubuntu, since that is what Linux Mint is based on. Soon (April
2007), it will be Ubuntu "Feisty Fawn" 7.04.</p>

<p>There are many downloads available, but you are looking for the latest
<tt>*.deb</tt> file. At the moment, you will find it under <em>Package
for Ubuntu Edgy Eft 6.10</em>. The file name (now) is
<tt>envy_0.9.1-0ubuntu3_all.deb</tt>, but always go for the latest
<strong>stable</strong> version. Click on the download, and
<em>Firefox</em> will ask you what you want to do with it. Select
<em>Open with</em> <tt>Gdebi Package Installer</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/11.png" border="0" alt="Gdebi
warning" width= "335" height="255"></p>

<p>Once Gdebi opens it (administrator's password required), it will
inform you that an older version is installed, and recommend you install
software from the Linux Mint <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository"
target="_blank">repositories</a>. I would recommend the same, but we'll
make an exception, this time:  Close the dialogue, and click <tt>Install
Package</tt>. <em>Gdebi</em> will then provide you with a list of
required <a
href="http://www.answers.com/topic/coupling-computer-science"
target="_blank">dependencies</a>, which it will have to download. Accept
to do so. When the installation is complete, close <em>Gdebi</em>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/12.png" border="0" alt="envy" width= "419" height="347"></p>

<p>Now we run <em>Envy</em>. You will find it in the menu under
<tt>Applications &gt; System Tools</tt>, and it will require the
administrator's password. Select <tt>Install the NVIDIA driver</tt> or
<tt>Install the ATI driver</tt>, as appropriate for your graphics card.
Click <tt>Apply</tt>.  If I am not mistaken, everything should be
handled '<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/automagical"
target="_blank">automagically!</a>' I am not sure, because I do not have
the hardware, but <em>Envy</em> may ask you for some information such as
your screen resolution, monitor specifications like frequencies, and the
like. These you can get from your monitor's manual or run a quick Google
search. When <em>Envy</em> provides you the option of restarting the X
server, do so. This should take you back to the login screen, and you
should see the NVIDIA or ATI logo before the login screen (unless things
have changed since I had my Geforce2). If not, you could try
rebooting.</p>

<h4>Synaptic Package Manager</h4>

<p>New users to Linux usually try to do things as they would in Windows.
This is most often seen in program installation. Most go hunting on the
Internet for sites from which to download software they need. Usually,
they end up going to the project's homepage, downloading the tar.gz file,
and then usually get stumped on installing it from the command line. 
Many a time they also run into what is known as <a
href="http://www.answers.com/topic/dependency-hell"
target="_blank">dependency hell</a>. On the contrary, application
installation in Linux is meant to be painless, thanks to the plethora
package managers available. Linux Mint uses <a
href="http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">Debian's</a>
<tt>apt-get</tt> package manager. <em>Synaptic Package Manager</em> is
one of the available <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"
target="_blank">graphical user interfaces (GUI)</a> of this powerful
package manager.</p>

<p><em>Synaptic Package Manger</em> is in the menu under the
<em>System</em> section, and is labeled <em>Install Software</em>. To run
it, you will need the administrator's password.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/13.png" border="0" alt="Synaptic
Package manager" width= "600" height="450"></p>

<p>The interface is divided neatly into three fields: On the left, there
is a list of categories of software, grouped according to various
criteria. There are four grouping criteria, which can be selected by
clicking on the buttons on the bottom left: <em>Sections, Status,
Search Results</em>, and <em>Custom Filters</em>. The top-right field
contains the list of packages in the category selected in the left field,
and their status. The bottom-right field gives a short description of
the package selected in the top right field. <em>Synaptic Package
Manager</em> contains a database of all the packages available for Linux
Mint, including those not installed on your system. Browsing through the
database, you will see that the amount of free software available to do
almost any task imaginable is truly mind-boggling!</p>

<p>The easiest way to find a an application or package is to use the
search tool. Click the <tt>Search</tt> button, and a small dialogue opens
with a field to enter your search term and a drop-down list telling it
where to search. If you know what package you are looking for, select
<tt>Name</tt> from the list, and run the search. If you want to perform a
task but don't know what application you should install, select
<tt>Description and Name</tt> from the list, and run the search.</p>

<p>For example, I needed an image editor to crop and resize the
screenshots for this article. So I ran a search for <tt>image
editing</tt> in <tt>Description and Name</tt>. This gave me a
substantial list of matching packages. You will notice that some
packages also have the Ubuntu logo next to them. This indicates that
these packages are officially supported by Ubuntu, and will most probably
work perfectly. Among the officially supported packages in my search
result, the descriptions showed that the <tt>GIMP</tt> package is what
suited what I was looking for, the most. (I confess, I knew that
already....) Installing is just a matter of <tt>Right-clicking</tt> on
the package and selecting <tt>Mark for Installation</tt>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/14.png" border="0" alt="Synaptic
additional marked changes" width= "275" height="224"></p>

<p>If additional packages are required, a dialogue opens, informing you
what other changes are required for things to work properly. Click
<tt>Mark</tt> to accept the other changes. You will see the package
highlighted as marked for installation.<p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/15.png" border="0" alt="Synaptic
confirmation dialogue" width= "265" height="256"></p>

<p>Then click <tt>Apply</tt>. A dialogue will open, which will give you a
summary of changes to be made, including the total size of packages to be
downloaded and the space that will be used by the installed packages.
Click <tt>Apply</tt> again and wait for it to download, install, and
configure everything for you.<p>

<p align="center"><img src="misc/lazar/16.png" border="0" alt="Synaptic
success dialogue" width= "299" height="136"></p>

<p>You will be informed when the installation is complete, and if there
have been any errors. You can now close the package manager, and you will
find your newly installed application in the menu, under
<tt>Graphics</tt> in the case of <tt>GIMP</tt>. Simple, isn't it!</p>

<hr align="center" width="50%" noshade="noshade">

<p>If everything has gone well so far, you now have a computer running a
pretty, stable, secure, convenient, and free OS:


<ul>

<li>equipped with a wide range of software for all common computing
tasks</li>

<li>with access to the Internet,</li>

<li>updated with the latest software, patches and fixes,</li>

<li>with full access to your Windows partitions,</li>

<li>with the latest and best drivers for your graphics cards, and</li>

<li>with the knowledge to install any other application you may
need.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>This basic setup should have you well on your way to being productive
in your new Linux desktop. In my next article, I will talk about some of
the most commonly used applications, fine-tuning, and enhancing your
experience in Linux. Till next time, take care, and be nice!</p>


<a name="1"></a>
<p> [1] <span class="editorial">Rick Moen comments</span>:  The utility
and necessity of ATI and Nvidia's proprietary drivers are frequently
overstated, innocently by most commentators, and less so by that
driver software's core constituency.  That core constituency has to date
comprised 3D gamers (majority), scientists and animators using 3D for
various types of 3D modeling (minority) and miscellaneous desktop users
experimenting with 3D desktop effects such as provided by the quite
flashy Compiz and Beryl 3D window managers (small minority).</p>  

<p>Utility:  As noted above.  It's important to note that no video chipset,
from any manufacturer, in any way requires proprietary drivers for
regular everyday X11 desktop functions, including all regular
applications including graphics, desktop publishing, etc.  A combination
of 3D-capable video hardware and 3D-capable drivers are required only
for the rather specialised uses described previously.</p>

<p>To be blunt, aside from having found Compiz/Beryl screen-rolling visual
effects cute and appealing for about the first half-hour, I personally
could go the rest of my life without 3D cabilities in my X11 sessions,
and not miss them at all -- and I strongly suspect that will likewise be 
true of almost all Linux users, for some time to come.  Also, avoiding having
some hardware manufacturer's un-auditable binary-only proprietary
drivers running in my systems' kernelspace leads immediately to a huge 
gain in system reliability and security.  (Note that the Linux kernel's
"taint flag" was developed in response to the Linux kernel mailing list
being swamped with bug reports ultimately traceable to buggy Nvidia
kernel drivers: deployment of the "taint flag" enabled kernel coders to
ignore problem reports from all such users, and they consistently now do
so.)</p>

<p>Necessity:  An increasingly significant number of graphics chips from
non-ATI/Nvidia manufacturers, notably the Intel i965 chip series, have
lately been able to achieve quite respectable 3D framerates using
entirely open source drivers/libraries (X.org and Mesa, or Xgl) -- 
because those manufacturers, unlike ATI and Nvidia, cooperate with the
open source community.  Additionally, and almost never mentioned by the
proprietary drivers' proponents, entirely open source 3D works for 
most ATI R2x0 and R3x0 chips, and a project is underway to do likewise
for Nvidia chips.  
See <a href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/">http://dri.freedesktop.org/</a> and
<a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/">http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/</a>
for details.</p>

<p>Discussion of 3D on Linux was for years -- again, to be blunt --
relegated mostly to 3D gamers, especially during the 2000-2004 economic
downturn when gamers were practically the only people buying new
hardware. It's past time for the open source community to take the
subject back, and correct the misperception that proprietary drivers are
broadly necessary and desirable. They are neither.</p>
