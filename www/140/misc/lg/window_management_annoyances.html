Occasionally I get a window behaving in a way I haven't seen until recently. 
The window is not displayed, just the title bar. When I move the cursor over 
the title bar the rest of the window displays, but when the cursor is moved 
off the window it shrinks back to just the title bar. 
</p>

<p>
I assume that this is configurable behaviour in some way, but it seems to 
happen fairly randomly. It's most common in JBuilder (spit), but it's also 
happening to an xterm window at the moment.
</p>

<p>
The Window Manager is KDE and I'm running Debian Etch. Does anyone know what 
causes this and how to stop it?

Window Shading!  I like the window shading, personally, but it's
usually easy to fix.  Depending on how the KDE is setup, (i.e.,
default kde settings) double clicking on the title bar will turn off
the shading.  There should be an option in the menu you get when you
right-click on the title bar.  I'd suggest going into the window
decorations settings in kcontrol, and adding a button to the titlebar
so that you can see if the shade is activated or not.

<p>
Hope that helps!

That definitely helps 
</p>

<p>
Any idea why I randomly get some shaded windows, particularly JBuilder 
dialogs? I can see myself accidentally double clicking on a title bar 
occasionally, but when a dialog has just popped up and I haven't had a chance 
to click on it, why should shading be actovated sometimes , but not 
consistently?
