<h1>PowerPC Assembly Programming on the Mac Mini</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/pramode.html">Pramode C.E.</A></b></p>

<p>

<p> The <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a> is a very
compact desktop computer designed by Apple. Based on the PowerPC (PPC) G4
CPU, the machine is ideal for those who wish to experiment with GNU/Linux
on a non-Intel platform.  In this article, we will examine how to get
Ubuntu Linux up and running on the Mac Mini. Assembly language skills on a
RISC CPU like the PowerPC are very much in demand in the embedded-systems
industry - and we shall use the  PPC Linux system to do a bit of assembly
language hacking!

<h3>The Mac Mini Hardware</h3>
<p>
The Mac Mini runs on  a PowerPC  CPU having 
a clock speed of 1.25GHz (a higher-end version is also
available). Figure 2 shows the output of
running 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' on my machine:

<pre>
processor	: 0
cpu		: 7447A, altivec supported
clock		: 1249MHz
revision	: 1.2 (pvr 8003 0102)
bogomips	: 1245.18
machine		: PowerMac10,1
motherboard	: PowerMac10,1 MacRISC3 Power Macintosh 
detected as	: 287 (Unknown Intrepid-based)
pmac flags	: 00000000
L2 cache	: 512K unified
memory		: 256MB
pmac-generation	: NewWorld
</pre>

<p> There is a 40GB IDE hard disk, two USB ports, one
firewire port, built-in sound and a "slot-loading" CD/DVD drive. 
The power supply, 
rated at 85W, is provided as an external 'brick'. The unit does not
come with a monitor or keyboard - you have to provide 
them yourself. Both the keyboard and the mouse are USB-based.
I had no difficulty getting my Microsoft USB mouse detected,
but I had to try a few different brands before I got my USB keyboard
working.

<p>
There are some minor hardware peculiarities - one is the absence
of an 'eject' button for the CD drive. If you are running Linux
or MacOS, software eject will work; otherwise, holding the mouse
button down during the boot process will do the trick. Another 
idea is to get into 'OpenFirmware' (similar to the CMOS setup
on the PC) during the boot process by holding down the
<code>Alt-Windows-O-F</code> keys and
then executing the 'eject cd' command. Booting from the CD requires
holding down the 'c' key during powerup.


<h3>Installing Ubuntu</h3>
<p>
Ubuntu Linux has a PowerPC edition; the CD image can be
downloaded from <a
href="http://ubuntulinux.org">http://ubuntulinux.org</a>. The Mac Mini
comes pre-installed with MacOS X in the single partition which occupies the
whole of the hard disk. The first step, then, is to run the installation CD and
get OS X into a smaller partition (say 20 GB). Once this is
done, you can boot with the Ubuntu installation CD and create
a few partitions for Linux to work with. The rest of the Ubuntu
installation process will proceed very smoothly and you will
have a MacOS X/Linux dual boot system working perfectly. 

<h3>Tweaking Ubuntu</h3>
<p>
Ubuntu is a nice end-user distro; but developers will have to
put in some effort to get their favourite tools working.
I had to do an:

<pre>
apt-get install gcc
</pre>

to have 'gcc' working. I downloaded the 2.6.8.1 kernel from <a
href="http://kernel.org">kernel.org</a> and tried compiling it with

<pre>
make menuconfig
</pre>

which failed because the 'ncurses-devel' package was missing. The 
problem was solved by getting <code>ncurses-5.4.tgz</code> from a GNU FTP site
and installing it from source. 

<p>
Once the kernel compilation process is over, you will see
a file called 'vmlinux' under the root of the kernel source tree.
This has to be copied to the '/boot' directory under a different
name, e.g. 'mykernel'. PowerPC systems use the 'yaboot' boot
loader whose configuration file '/etc/yaboot.conf' looks similar
to LILO's config file. Here is what I added to my 'yaboot.conf':

<pre>
image=/boot/mykernel
	label=mykernel
	read-only
	initrd=/boot/initrd.img
	append="quiet splash"
</pre>

The 'ybin' program has to be executed to install the boot
loader.


<h3>Learning PowerPC Assembly</h3>
<p>
The PowerPC is more of a processor specification rather 
than a processor. Originally developed by an Apple-IBM-Motorola
alliance, there are a lot of processors in the market which
can be called PowerPCs; the Mac Mini uses a processor called
7447A. PowerPC chips are often used in embedded devices
as well as in high-end servers. 

<p>
Understanding the architecture and the assembly language 
of a microprocessor is crucial in tasks which involve
low level interaction with the machine - like designing/debugging
operating systems, compilers, embedded applications, etc. 
The Mac Mini running GNU/Linux can be used by universities and 
engineering colleges to provide computer architecture
education to its students. We shall examine the basics
of PowerPC assembly language programming in the rest of this
article, mostly with a view towards understanding the code which
GCC generates.


<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
The PowerPC is a Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC).  All instructions
are encoded uniformly in 4 bytes and the only instructions which access
memory are load and store instructions. There is a large register set
consisting of 32 integer registers, 32 floating point registers, a
condition register (CR), a link register (LR) and a few others. Programmers
familiar with the x86 instruction set will note the absence of special
registers like the stack pointer - the idea is that one of the general
purpose registers itself can be used as a stack pointer. An Application
Binary Interface (ABI) defines the conventions to be adopted; the SVR4 ABI,
which ppc32 Linux follows, requires GPR1 (General Purpose Register 1) to be
used as a stack pointer. Also, the ABI requires arguments to a function to
be passed in registers starting with GPR3. A function can freely modify
GPR3 to GPR12 - the caller is expected to save them if necessary. 

<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/listing1.txt">Listing 1</a> shows a  simple 
assembly language program. Let's see what each of the 
instructions does. 

<p>
The instruction:

<pre>
li 4, 0x10
</pre>

loads the immediate (constant) value 0x10 to the general purpose register
4; x86 programmers may be bothered by the use of pure numbers to represent
registers rather than more meaningful names like r0, r1 etc. The instruction:

<pre>
add 4, 4, 5
</pre>

may be thought of as doing the algebraic operation:

<pre>
r4 = r4 + r5
</pre>

That is, sum the contents of general purpose registers 4 and 5 and store the
result in GPR4. The instruction:

<pre>
addi 4, 4, 5
</pre>

does the operation:

<pre>
r4 = r4 + 5
</pre>

ie, simply add the constant value 5 to contents of register r4.

<p>
The 'stwu' (store word and update) instruction is a bit
tricky. The general format is:

<pre>
stwu rS, d(rA)
</pre>

The instruction stores the contents of register rS into a memory location
whose effective address has been computed by taking d+rA. At the same time, rA
is updated to become equal to the effective address. Note that the general
purpose register R1 is taken to be the stack pointer, so 'stwu 1, -16(1)'
stores the contents of the stack pointer register to a position at offset
-16 from the current top of stack and decrements the stack pointer by 16.
A sample interaction with 'gdb' shows that this is indeed the case.

<p>
What remains is the instruction 'blr' which should be read as 
'branch to link register'. The Link Register (LR) is a special
register which holds the return address during a subroutine call.
Our 'main' was called from a standard library 'start' routine; LR
will have the address of the instruction which main should return
to. Doing a 'blr' will result in execution getting transferred
to the address contained in the Link Register.

<h3>Using GDB to trace programs</h3>
<p>
The GNU Debugger helps us  single-step through assembly
language programs; we will also be able to examine the
contents of memory locations and registers after executing
each instruction. First, we have to compile the program
like this:

<pre>
cc -g listing1.s
</pre>

and invoke gdb:

<pre>
gdb ./a.out
</pre>

Here is a sample interaction with GDB:

<pre class="code">
Breakpoint 1, main () at listing1.s:5
5		li 4, 0x10
Current language:  auto; currently asm
(gdb) s
6		li 5, 0x20
(gdb) s
7		add 4, 4, 5 
(gdb) p/x $r4
$1 = 0x10
(gdb) p/x $r5
$2 = 0x20
(gdb) s
8		addi 4, 4, 5
(gdb) p/x $r4
$3 = 0x30
(gdb) s
9		stwu 1, -16(1)
(gdb) p/x $r4
$4 = 0x35
(gdb) p/x $r1
$5 = 0x7ffff8e0
(gdb) x/4xb 0x7ffff8e0-16
0x7ffff8d0:	0x7f	0xff	0xf9	0x44
(gdb) s
main () at listing1.s:10
10		addi 1, 1, 16
(gdb) p/x $r1
$6 = 0x7ffff8d0
(gdb) x/4xb $r1
0x7ffff8d0:	0x7f	0xff	0xf8	0xe0
(gdb) p/x $lr
$7 = 0xfebf100
(gdb) s
main () at listing1.s:11
11		blr
(gdb) s
0x0febf100 in __libc_start_main () from /lib/libc.so.6
</pre>

The 's' (step) command is used for stepping through one
instruction. We can print the value of a register, say, GPR4
by doing 'print $r4' or 'p/x $r4' (print in hex). The contents of
a memory location can be printed by executing a 'x/4xb' command. 
We note that executing the 'blr' instruction resulted in control getting
transferred to the location 0x0febf100 - this is the address
which the Link Register (LR) was holding.

<p>
The GDB command 'disas' (short form for 'disassemble') can be used
to view the assembly code in a better way - here is the output
obtained by running 'disas main':

<pre class="code">
(gdb) disas main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
0x100003d0 &lt;main+0&gt;:	li	r4,16
0x100003d4 &lt;main+4&gt;:	li	r5,32
0x100003d8 &lt;main+8&gt;:	add	r4,r4,r5
0x100003dc &lt;main+12&gt;:	addi	r4,r4,5
0x100003e0 &lt;main+16&gt;:	blr
</pre>

<p>
The 'objdump' command too can be used to disassemble the 
machine code.

<h3>Subroutine Call</h3>
<p>
Branching to a subroutine results in the return address being stored in the
Link Register - if this subroutine calls another one, the current address
in LR will be lost, unless it is saved on the stack. <a
href="misc/pramode/listing2.txt">Listing 2</a> shows a simple C program and
<a href="misc/pramode/listing3.txt">Listing 3</a> is part of its assembly
language translation obtained by running:

<pre>
gcc -S -fomit-frame-pointer listing2.c
</pre>

Let's try to work out the code line by line.

<p>
The first line of 'main' simply decrements the stack pointer
by 16 and stores the old value at that location. We are
basically building a stack frame to hold the local variables
defined within the function. Let's say the initial value of
the stack pointer is 1000; after the first line, it becomes
984. The next instruction, 'mflr 0' copies the contents of the
link register to general purpose register 0 which is then stored
onto the stack by the 'stw' instruction at a location whose 
address is found by adding 20 to the value of the stack pointer
register r1 (ie, location 1004).  

<p>
The next two lines copy the number 3 to r0 and then stores it
at the location whose effective address is computed by adding
8 to the contents of r1 (ie, location 992); this is the variable 'm' defined
in our C program. The 'load word and zero' (lwz) instruction
loads the register r3 with the value of 'm' and executes a 'branch and
link' to function 'fun'. The 'bl' instruction transfers control to
the function 'fun' and at the same time loads the Link Register with
the address of the instruction immediately after the 'bl' in 'main'.
We note that the old value of LR (which is the address to which 
'main' is to return to) is overwritten, but that is not a problem
because we have already saved this value on the stack.

<p>
The function 'fun' sets up its own stack frame and copies the
value it received in register r3 onto the stack thereby creating
the local variable 'x'. This is then copied into r9, incremented
and copied to r3 (the instruction 'mr 3, 0' copies the value in
r0 to r3). The function returns by doing a 'blr' - the stack
pointer is adjusted back to its initial value before the return
is executed.

<p>
Back in 'main', the value in r3 (the return value) is copied
to the variable 'm' stored on the stack. The old value of the link
register saved on the stack is copied to r0 after which the
'mtlr' (move to link register) instruction transfers it to LR.
The function then returns by doing a 'blr'. The entire sequence
of events can be understood clearly by stepping through the
code using GDB.


<h3>Invoking System Calls</h3>
<p>
The 'arch/ppc/kernel/misc.S' file under the PPC32 Linux kernel source
tree defines a data structure called a 'sys_call_table' which holds
pointers to all the system calls defined in the kernel. Here is a
part of this array:

<pre>
	.data
	.align 4
_GLOBAL(sys_call_table)
	.long sys_restart_syscall /* 0 */
	.long sys_exit
	.long ppc_fork
	.long sys_read
</pre>

We note that the address of the fork function is stored in slot 2 of 
this array - the system call number of 'fork' is therefore 2. It's possible
to write a simple assembly language program which invokes 'fork' - the idea
is to execute the 'sc' instruction after storing the call number in r0 and
any arguments in r3, r4 etc. <a href="misc/pramode/listing4.txt">Listing
4</a> demonstrates the idea. The program goes in a loop (by using the
'branch' instruction, 'b') after invoking 'fork'. If we run 'ps ax' on
another console, we would be able to see two copies of 'a.out' running -
proof that 'fork' has indeed been invoked!


<h3>Taking the address of a variable</h3>
<p>
<a href="misc/pramode/listing5.txt">Listing 5</a> is a simple C program in
which we store the address of a local variable in a pointer and then
dereference the pointer to modify the pointed-to object. <a
href="misc/pramode/listing6.txt">Listing 6</a> is part of the assembly
language translation obtained by calling 'gcc -S -fomit-frame-pointer'. We
see that the assembly code is not doing anything special. The situation is
a bit different when we try to take the address of a global object. The
problem is that because each instruction (opcode + operands) is encoded in
32 bits, it is impossible to store a 32 bit address as part of the operand
of a PowerPC instruction - we will have to split the address into two parts
and add them up in a 32 bit register using two instructions. <a
href="misc/pramode/listing7.txt">Listing 7</a> is part of the assembly
output that we would get if the variable 'i' in Listing 5 had been defined
as a global.

<p>
Let's compile the code into an 'a.out' and execute the command:

<pre>
nm ./a.out
</pre>

'nm' shows you the names and addresses of all the globally visible symbols
in your program; on my machine, I see that the variable 'i' has been 
assigned the address 0x100108a8. Split up into two parts and expressed in
decimal, the most significant 16 bits is 4097 and the least significant
16 bits is 2216. Coming back to the assembly language program, the two lines
we are interested in are:

<pre>
lis 9, i@ha
la 0, i@l(9)
</pre>

A disassembled listing of the program displays these lines as:

<pre>
lis r9, 4097
addi r0, r9, 2216
</pre>

The assembler has encoded the 'load algebraic' instruction as an 'add'
which has the same effect; this is something very common in PowerPC
assembly programming.  The notation 'i@ha' results in the higher 16 bits of
the address of 'i' getting extracted and 'i@l' yields the lower 16 bits.
The 'load immediate shifted' (lis) instruction loads 4097 into the most
significant bits of r9 and the add instruction simply combines it with the
lower 16 bits of the address of 'i'. 


<h3>Smashing the stack</h3>
<p>
PowerPC programs too are vulnerable to the same buffer overflow
attacks so common on x86 architectures. A function saves the
contents of the Link Register on the stack if it calls some
other function; it is very easy to overflow a buffer and overwrite
this return address. <a href="misc/pramode/listing8.txt">Listing 8</a>
shows a C program in which we overflow the buffer 'a' - we are adding 12 to
the contents of a[13]. Reading the assembly code produced by doing

<pre>
cc -S -fomit-frame-pointer listing8.c
</pre>

tells us that <code>a[13]</code> refers to the memory location where
the Link Register has been saved. Adding 12 to it results in the
function returning back to its caller (main) with the next 3 
instructions skipped ('m++' takes 3 instructions and each instruction
is encoded in 4 bytes). So the program prints 57 instead of 
58. <a href="misc/pramode/listing9.txt">Listing 9</a> shows the relevant
assembly code segment. 


<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>
We have just had a glimpse into the fascinating world of
assembly language programming - 
readers interested in Computer Architecture should refer to
the book 'Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software
Interface' by Patterson and Hennessy to get some idea
of the amazing techniques used by microprocessor designers
to convert a slice of silicon to a marvel of engineering.
