It emerged during the past month, to the dismay of everyone interested in
open file formats and free software, that the JPEG image compression scheme
may be subject to patent royalties.   As 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26272.html">
reported</a>
by The Register, 
<a href="http://www.forgent.com/">
Forgent Networks</a> have recently come into possession of a 
<a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1='4,698,672'.WKU.&OS=PN/4,698,672&RS=PN/4,698,672">
patent</a> which they claim covers the transmission of JPEG images, and
have even managed to claim royalties from two companies.  If this patent
proves to be enforceable, the ISO have said that they will
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26339.html">
withdraw JPEG as a standard</a>  (the licencing terms being enforced by
Forgent are not compatible with ISO regulations for standards).
Hopefully the patent will not stand up.  To make sure of this, the JPEG
committee is 
<a href="http://www.jpeg.org/newsrel1.html">
seeking examples of prior art</a> which would render the patent null
and void.  
If the worst comes to the worst, it appears that the patent will
expire in 2004 in any case.
<P>
The 
<a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/group/index.en.html">
Software Patent Working Group of the FFII</a>, 
has pointed out that there are also
<a href="http://swpat.ffii.org/patente/wirkungen/jpeg/index.en.html">
European Patents in existence</a>
which could be used to put a lean on JPEG compression.
A small step can be taken against EU software patents by signing
the <a href="http://www.noepatents.org/index_html?LANG=en">
Petition for a Software Patent Free Europe</a>.
<P>
A webpage bringing together many links on this story is the new
<a href="http://burnalljpegs.org/">
Burn All .JPEGs!</a> website.
Forgent's website also has a 
<a href="http://www.forgent.com/company/press_room/in_the_news.shtml">
list</a> of recent appearances of the company in the news, which has a
couple of links to stories regarding the JPEG patent.

Wired <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,54141,00.html">reports</A>
that the US Ambassador to Peru has come out against Peruvian Congressman
Villanueva's bill advocating usage of open-source software in
gonvernment computers.  Also, Bill Gates personally delivered
Peru's president Alejandro Tolero a donation estimated at $550,000
for the national school system.  Not surprisingly, the money is
to go to the same schools Villanueva's bill targets.
Villanueva said he believes Microsoft isn't worried so much about
losing the small Peruvian market as the cascading effect that might
happen if other Latin American countries follow suit.  Similar bills
are pending in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, and Spain's Extremadura
region has

<A HREF="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6204">Pakistan</A> is
getting into the Open Source game too.  50,000 Pentium IIs running GNU/Linux
are being installed in schools and colleges all over Pakistan, at a cost of
less than US$100 each.  "Proprietary software for these PCs would cost a
small fortune.  Surely more than what the computers cost!"

<A HREF="http://www.msnbc.com/news/785970.asp">USB 2.0</A> is being 
backported to Linux kernel 2.4.19.  This means the stable Linux kernel
will have access to the upcoming generation of USB devices running 40
times faster than currently.  The speedup makes USB CR-RW drives and
network cards practical, and gives performance comparable to FireWire
(but cheaper).  This is only the first step: the specific device drivers
still need to be written.  Linux users can rejoice that the delay in 
getting USB 2.0 support is much less than was the case with USB 1.0, and
that the rate of progress is quite competitive with that of proprietary OSes.

which is half owned by Microsoft but continues to publish pro-Linux articles.)

available to all users of a program, in a convenient location, and so that the
project can use the article as primary documentation if desired, updating it as
the program evolves.

It looked like the end of the road for
<a href="http://www.lwn.net/">
Linux Weekly News</a>
earlier this month, when they 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/5052/">
announced</a>
that the August 1st edition would be the last ever.  The basic cause for
this decision was lack of money, and the absence of any plan which could
generate money.
Following the announcement, many disappointed readers put their money on
the table and contributed to LWN's donation scheme.  This quickly raised
$12000, leading to a 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/5838/">rethink of LWN's future</a>.  
A final decision on the magazine's fate has not been made.

Congratulations to the folk behind the

Ogg Vorbis</a>

<a href="http://www.ogg.org/ogg/vorbis/index.html">

As linked

there are currently various news items related to the 1.0 release on

This story was also reported
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26176.html">

<P>
<a href="http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/">Ogg Vorbis</a>  and 
<a href="http://www.xiph.org/">Xiph.org</a> have also been in the news this
month due to the links being forged between the open source format and the
new 
<a href="http://www.realnetworks.com/info/helix/index.html">
Helix</a>
software of 
<a href="http://www.realnetworks.com/">RealNetworks</a>.  This development
should see some parts of RealNetworks' software 
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-07-24-016-26-NW-DT-SW">
being released</a>
under "a community and open source licence".  Inclusion of the Ogg Vorbis
codec into RealNetworks products should follow.
<P>
Bruce Perens has written an 
<a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/07/23/0032247&mode=thread&tid=11">
in-depth account</a>
of the issues surrounding the RealNetworks-Xiph link-up, and has criticised
many features of the deal, such as the fact that Real's codecs will remain
proprietary, and the use of community licencing (rather than opensource)
for parts of their software.
Rob Lanphier of RealNetworks has 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?cid=3933287&sid=36511&tid=126">
replied to Bruce</a> on Slashdot, and asked for good will to be shown to
the company's open source contribution.
The Register has also 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26314.html">
reported on</a>
Real's open source experiment,
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-945406.html">
as has CNET</a>.
The
