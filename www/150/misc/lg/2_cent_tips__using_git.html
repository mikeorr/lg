<strong>Using git to recreate an old CVS layout</strong><br>I had to go hunting for old data in a CVS repository today, and wanted
to hang on to the data in one place. git-cvsimport does a nice job of
maintaining the CVS history of each module, but because of the way the
repository was laid out, each module had to be grabbed separately. To
join them back together, I created a new git repository, and used
'git-submodule add' to drag in each of the converted modules.
</p>

<p>
It's not as convenient as being able to look at the whole project
history at once, but at least it's a lot easier to pass to the next
poor soul who finds themselves in my situation.
</p>

<p>
 
<strong>Git as a better SVN</strong><br>I've been using git-svn for decentralised SVN access for a few months
- sometimes I don't have access to an internet connection, sometimes I
don't want to commit something until it's finished, sometimes I want
to be able to work on a branchwithout having to redo everything when I
want to merge - but today I found another use: to revert a whole
commit, instead of individual files.
</p>

<p>
There's probably a proper way to do it, but being able to open gitk,
right click on the commit and save it as a file, chop off the mail
headers and use patch -R -p1 was a lot quicker than the subversion
way. (Though SVN is probably a better if you just want to revert one
file from a commit).
</p>

The main pain with git-svn is the amount of time it needs to get
started as it pulls the entire history of the svn repository.
</p>

<p>
One thing which I haven't figured out is how to create svn tags in the
remote repository using git-svn. So currently, I cheat and use svn
for that
</p>

<pre>
	svn copy &lt;remoteURL&gt;/trunk &lt;remoteURL&gt;/tags/&lt;version&gt; \
		-m "Tagging release &lt;version&gt;."
	git svn fetch
</pre>
Any better ideas?
</p>

Yeah, and the SVN revision -&gt; git revision information doesn't seem to
be passed by default when you clone from git. Older versions of the
script had a 'rebuild' option that's curiously lacking these days. The
information is easy to get at, but the last time I had to do it was at
a pretty early hour of the morning, and I let it run as I slept.

<p>
No, sorry. I've only tagged something once - does SVN really do some
internal magic? Because I didn't notice anything other than a copy of
the directory. I have to keep an SVN copy around anyway, so it's not
something I would have played with.

This is what git-log allows for.
