Hello.
</p>

<p>
I need some help and I'm hoping you can do it. Ok,here goes.
I traded a guy at work for an Apple laptop with Linux installed. He got
it from a guy who didn't have the Root password. How nice! I've tried to
</p>

<p>
+ reinstall Opensuse 10.2 to gain controll of the laptop,and it won't
autorun. I made sure the discs were in ISO form. When the disc is in the
cdrom
</p>

<p>
+ it shows how big the disc is but it doesn't show how much space is
available. The memory shows that there's' 2.34mb avaliable. I'm very new at
this
</p>

<p>
+ Linux and don't really understand it yet. So, do you think you'ins' can
help me?
</p>

<p>
ON Opensuse site it said if it didn't start auto to open Bios setup and
go from ther. I'm not sure how to do that ,or where to type in Bios.
Any help would be greatly welcomed and appreaciated!
</p>

<p>
Thank-you,

touched, made his hand retrack uncontrollably it was that hot?

I have <strong>absolutely</strong> no idea what you just said there.  In either case,
you want to get the BIOS to load from the CDROM rather than the
harddrive.  How you'd do that is anyone's guess.  You haven't even
told us what model this laptop is.

See avove.  We need more information.

<p>
First off, you have an Apple laptop.  The instructions you are reading
(that refer to BIOS and the like) are for PCs.  Apple laptops (of the
recent variety, anyway) don't have a BIOS, they have a PROM which
performs some of the similar functions as a BIOS on PCs but is
completely different.
</p>

<p>
On a PC, you would boot the machine and watch the screen.  You will see
a message on it like 'F2 - Setup' and you would hit the F2 key and the
would put you into the BIOS. You would then set the configuration to
boot off of the CDROM.  But you don't have a PC, you have an Apple and
they do things differently.
</p>

<p>
On my Macbook, I boot off a CDROM by a) putting the CD into the drive,
b) rebooting the machine, c) and hold down the 'c' key during the
boot process.
</p>

<p>
As Thomas, said, we need more information on what kind of laptop you
have, amongst other information before we can reliably help.

If you're not able to boot from the CD following Faber's hints, you may need  to
boot into Open Firmware. Googling on that phrase may also help.
