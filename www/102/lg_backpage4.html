bank account every month?  </STRONG>

    Freak out. Then I'd call them to ask why they were doing that, and when
    I was told it was a "computer error" I'd move on with my life.

    There was an episode of <I>I Love Lucy</I> where Lucy was a door-to-door
    vacuum saleswoman.  Some lady opened the door and Lucy immediately threw
    some dirt on her floor.  So the lady would have to let her demonstrate the
    vacuum as she cleaned it up.  Unfortunately the apartment she picked had
    new owners and the electricity hadn't been turned on yet.

    <BR>Dear Answer Gang,<BR>
    This patch doesn't work.  I tried running it as suggested and it said:

<PRE>
ben@baldur# /tmp/patch.exe
/tmp/patch.exe: /tmp/patch.exe: cannot execute binary file
</PRE>

    Please respond immediately.  I don't want to get a virus.  Why do you
    computer guys send out software that doesn't work?  Also, my other
    computer is having trouble with Access.  You'd better fix it right away.

        You *creep!* Sure, I know your kind; you'd be _glad_ to expose me to all
        those viruses, .exe files, and other sorts of nastiness. You'd probably
        replace my "vi" with "edlin" if you could, wouldn't you?

        <P>
        <STRONG>[Jason]</STRONG> 
        Did you try rebooting it?

Just like any generic pharmaceutical, 
our products are less expensive than 
the brand name equivalents.

Generic viagra, at cheap prices.
Most places charge $20, we charge $3. 

Quite a difference, huh? with guarantees to.

    Well. Genevi&egrave;ve must be a doctor; they used to scribble absolutely
    indecipherable prescriptions by hand - but now they've brought that
    skill forward into the computer age! Amazing how some things never
    change.

    <P> On the other hand, that could be a message from my stock broker to tell
    me which stocks I need to buy... or is that sell? I keep getting
    confused, which is why I've ended up with a small fortune from playing
    the stock market. Oh, did I mention that I started with a large one?

I couldn't leave without singing an ode to LG's new Editor, our resident
Russian spy.  It's another Rush song, "Red Lenses", from <I>Grace Under
Pressure</I> (1984), lyrics by Neal Peart.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4><A HREF="http://www.2112.net/xanadu/lyrics/gup.html#redlenses">Red Lenses</A></H4>

<PRE>
I see red
it hurts my head
guess it must be something
that I read

it's the colour of your heartbeat
a rising summer sun
the battle lost --- or won
the flash to fashion
and the pulse to passion ---
feels red
inside my head
and truth is often bitter ---
left unsaid
said red red
thinking about the overhead ---
the underfed
-- couldn't we talk about
something else instead?

we've got mars on the horizon
says the national midnight star
(it's true)
what you believe is what you are
a pair of dancing shoes ---
the soviets are the blues ---
the reds
under your bed
lying ---
in the darkness
dead ahead

and the mercury is rising
barometer starts to fall
you know it gets to us all
the pain that is learning
and the rain that is burning ---
feel red
still --- go ahead
you see black and white ---
and I see red
(not blue) 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Yes, Ben, I know you don't know how to thank me for that song.  Cash will
be fine.  Just think of it as a little brib^H^H^H^Hcontribution for keeping my
mouth shut when Heather asked us all if there was any reason not to let Ben 
near LG's big red "Publish" button.

It started as just a "Not Linux" section at the bottom
