<p>Are there any Cobal compilers that will run under Linux,  I have a

Subject: Packard Bell SOUND16A Soundcard

<p>I have a Packard Bell Pack-Mate 4990CD, which has a soundcard apparently
called a "SOUND16A" (the documentation doesn't make it clear whether PB or
Aztech made it, or if it was a joint production).  It is a 16 bit sound
card, which I can use under Windows 95 as such.  However, in Linux, the
best I can do is 8 bit sound (via Sound Blaster Pro 2.0 emulation).  The
card claims to support MSS, but nowhere in the documentation or setup
program does it specify which IRQ this runs at, although it does tell what
port.  I have contacted Packard Bell's tech support, but they say they only
support Windows software for free, and that if I wanted to talk about Linux
or some such operating system, I would need to get "special support" which
would cost a ridiculously high number.

<p>As a struggling college student, I don't have much money to spend on the
computer (it is actually my family's that I scratched up enough space to
install Linux on), so I can't get a new sound card, and I am not even sure
if the commercial sound drivers support this particular sound card.

<p>I'm probably spoiled by Windows, but it's not asking too much for 16 bit
sound so I can listen to 44KHz samples in stereo (I'm quite a MOD fan),
listen to MP2's or MP3's, etc...

<p>I'm not much of a coder, so I can't go about writing my own drivers.  If
anyone knows of how to set up this sound card for full 161 bit sound,
please inform me.  Or, if you know of any 8 bit .MP? players, that would
work too =)

Subject: Linux HELP!

<p>I would like to install Linux on a Sun 386i machine with 16 meg of ram, 2
350 meg scsii drives color video adapter and a tape drive, and Network
support. When I try to install using a boot disk, I get the following message.

<pre>	Boot: Device fd(0,0,0): Invalid Boot Block</pre>

<p>This occurs with any boot disk except for Sun. Is there a way I can get
Linux to install to this system?  Any suggestions would be greatly
appreciated. If you can not help me, Please redirect this message to
someone who could. I don't know where to get this type of information. I
received these machines for free and would like to put them to use using
Linux. 

<p>Thank you

Subject: Interfacing Genius Color Page-CS Scanner

<p>Hello,

Please help-me to interface my Color Page CS desktop scanner to Linux.
Now, I can scan only from Windows (Argh!!) and it would be fine to have
The Gimp accessing my scanned material.  I can program in C and Tcl/tk, if
I at least have the information on its SCSI card, and the scanner itself.

Any information you may have is precious to me. When I have this job done,
of course, I'll be happy to publish my adventures in the Gazette.

<p>best regards,<br>

<p>Sir, 
I am a 35 from Sweden using at present *2 90 Pentium /NT4 and Slakeware
1.2.13 and Red Hat 3.0 (and DOS 6.22 !) all on the same machine. (paranoid !)
I am interested in knowing how to take advantage of the *2 cpu's on a Linux

Any thing regarding *2 + processing is of interest to me, as i use the NT4 as

Subject: CD Burners, Scanners, Digital Cammeras, etc.


<p>I have a mess of family photographs and possibly 35mm slides that I 
want to preserve.  One idea I'm considering is scanning these and putting
them on CDs.  So I have a few questions.
<ol>
<li>Will a Sony CDU926S burner work with xcdroast?
The documentation says a Sony CDU920S will work, but I don't know
     the differences between the CDU920S and CDU926S.  A bare bones
     (no docs, drivers, software) CDU926S is only $265.  The MS ready
     version is $350, but who would want that?

<li>What is a good, but cheap flatbed scanner to use?
     (Good means 24 bit color and &gt;= 300dpi optical resolution.)
     What software (in Linux) supports the scanner?

<li>I can't afford one, but...
     Are there any 35mm slide scanners on the market with Linux support?

<li>And as long as I'm asking dumb questions...
     Does Linux have support for any digital cameras yet?
     Someday many of us will want to change to digital photography,
     and it would be awful to have to learn Windows to do this.

</ol>
<p>Thank you for your time and help,<br>
         Dave Mandel
<blockquote> <I> 
(We'll have to depend on our readers for 1 and 3. As to 2, we use the HP5P
flatbed scanner, which fits your qualifications for good. As to cheap it
depends on your definition--it sells for around $400. The Linux software
that supports all HP scanners is XVscan, and a very nice program it is.

Subject: Ascii Problems with FTP

<p>When I use a dos ftp(in ascii mode) program to download a Linux Script,
because it is not running yet, the script fails to work when installed. 
This is because a ^M is appended to every line, take them out and it works. 

<p>What's happening?

<p>How can I stop it?

<p>Or how can a filter all the ^M's out?

<p>Many Thanks<br>
Andrew Crook.

<blockquote> <I> 
(In a couple of last year's issues, there are several Tips & Tricks for
getting rid of ^M. You can't stop them from happening. I personally get
rid of them in vi using a global replace (e.g., :%s/^M//g); one command and
they're gone forever. --Editor)

Subject: Problems with XFree86

<p>I'm a new user to Linux and the problem still XFree86!  So then I tried
to know want can I do to Linux community.  In Issue #16, you said
that the problem is not video card and is Monitor balancing.  So why
Windows 95 can have all these preset on monitor and Linux don't have?
Why we can't use the stuff in the Microsoft Lib to transfer it into the
database of XF86Setup or something like that.  Cause that's real that
the dotclock and all this is very scrambled!  Why not just resolution
and Virtual Refresh, that's all we need to know, the program could do
the rest!  We don't have to know what horizontal frequency and dotclock
it is!

Subject: Need Help

<p>Hi,
 If you happen to have time on your end please be so kind as to answer a
few questions for a newbie!

<p>Well , here is the situation and I need to get some serious advice
from people like you. I have been reading the newsgroups and HOWTO's .
They have been quite informative and ,increasingly so, as I continue .
 Now , thank GOD I got my Linux (RED HAT 4.1) box set up and running on
my slave drive with Win95 on the Master. It detected my CDROM and I also
configured my Xwindows (X11R6) .

<p>But there are couple of questions
<ol>
<li>I have a video card of type diamond s3 virge 3D 2000 . The driver
for S3 was a choice in the XF86Setup which I chose and everything seems
to work fine. Also I chose the 800*600 resolution SVGA monitor . I have
been hearing rumors from friends that the video card when being used by
Xwindows may mess up the monitor . This has been troubling me quite a
bit . What's up with this ??

<li>I read using the dmesg command  that Linux at boot time does not
notice that there is a device on  tty1 . The specific line reads this
 <pre>Serial driver version 4.13 with no serial options enabled
 tty00 at 0x03f8 (irq=4) is a 16550A
 tty03 at 0x02e8 (irq=3) is a 16550A</pre> 
There seems to be no mention of tty1 (com 2 irq 3) where my modem is
installed at !How  to fix this ?? By the way my modem happens to be a
plug-n-play modem -SUpra 28.8bps. I have heard that pnp modems have
problems with Linux and there are fixes for pnp types - please recommend
any.(In effect how do I get my Modem to work)

<li>Also I did not notice during the boot time messages any thing to do
with PPP Protocol which I definitely need to dialup to an ISP . Does
that mean recompiling the Kernel -- HOw ( if red hat distribution has
specific or simpler way of doing things  then let me know )
Thanks a lot in anticipation.
</ol>

Subject: User-Level Driver For HP ScanJet 5p?<br>

<P>Hello!

Please can you point me to some direction were I can find a user-level
driver for the HP ScanJet 5p? There exist the HPSCANPBM driver which
works in part, but does not support the -width and -height options
for the ScanJet 5p. I guess it was written for a ScanJet 4c or something like that. 
BTW: The homepage of HP does not give much support for Linux users. They do not publish the ESCAPE sequences of the scanners.

Subject: WordPerfect for Linux

<p>Before more users spend many hours downloading the 50 megabyte (!) 
WordPerfect for Linux, you may want to note that the beta download lets
you get a demo version that times out after just 15 days. They seem to
have demo versions of WordPerfect 6 available, so it is not that big a
deal.

<p>However, I would like to see a comparison of WordPerfect for Linux, 
StarOffice's word processor and the what is planned for GNU WP.

<p>Hello,

I'd like to download the past issues of LG (having enjoyed LJ now since 
last fall), but I don't think I could even get an 11 meg file downloaded 
over my 14.4 modem within the 1 hour that I have before my local Internet 
connection (the Greater Detroit Free Net) times out on me.  Is there any 
way to download the past issues in smaller "chunks"?

<p>Thanks and have a real nice day...

(Hmmm, that is a problem. No, I don't save the individual tar files of
previous issues separately. There is, of course, The Whole Damn Thing,
option for each issue which gives you the issue as one great big
file. Not as nice as the normal multi-file format but very popular so must
work for some. --Editor)</I> </blockquote>

<p>Hi,

I read the ActiveX for Linux question in the Answer Guy's article, I did a

<p>I don't know if this is actually the ActiveX port for Linux or not, I
didn't feel like trying to figure it out, but there is a Beta for Linux
there.  Beats me what it does or how it does it...

Subject: Re: X Color Depth

<I>(In response to the message by Roland Smith)</I>

<P>Normally 8-bit displays use 256 colours chosen from 2^24 (16,777,216), and
15/16/24/32 bits displays just use a fixed number of colours spread
"evenly" throughout the colour spectrum. 

<p>16-bit displays use 5 bits for red, 5 bits for blue and 6 bits for green,
however the 65536 colours cannot be changed and so the overall
"resolution" of colour is lower than 256 bit displays. For instance you
can only have 2^5 different shades of green, rather than 2^8.

Subject: CNE Certification for Linux?

<P>Oh, no not a certification suggestion......

<P>Linux was developed as a better and free version of UNIX.
Now someone wants to make a CNE for Linux? As a successful Linux Network
Administrator (and Business owner that proudly states no Microsoft here!)
I am appalled at charging ten's of thousands of dollars to get a piece of paper 
that states I can do my job.  As an Internet service provider and an avid
Linux, Freeware, and Free Software Foundation supporter I hire my network
administrators and Engineers( We call them System Administrators ) based on 
their abilities and trainability.  A CNE paper does not nor will ever impress
me. Even suggesting such an idea toward Linux is appalling. Let's keep our
last bastion of freedom from the clutches of cooperate greed! If we must 
have a Linux CNE make it 100% free and available to everyone on the planet.
