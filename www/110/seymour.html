<h1>Design Awareness</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/seymour.html">Mark Seymour</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Kids, Do Try This at Home</h3>
<p> Now that we've talked about some of the basics of design, let's use
some. In this issue, we'll use those design principles to create a simple
opening web page for a fictitious company. (That will keep the lawsuits to
a minimum, rather than reworking something like, say, the www.microsoft.com
site.)

<p> The first thing is to name the company. There are firms out there that
do nothing else; I once worked with a genius (his company is at <a
href="http://www.namelab.com">http://www.namelab.com</a>) who's still at
it, thirty years later. Since this is the January issue, we'll do something
appropriately winterish.

<p> How about a winter sports equipment company? Skis, sleds, that sort of
thing. We want to give a vaguely European feel to the company, so we'll use
'alpine' rather than 'mountain'. We want to imply more than just sporting
goods (we might decide to sell clothing and climbing videos and tents, as
well), so we'll use 'gear' rather than 'equipment'.

<p> So, our company is called Alpine Gear. Except we're very hip and
internet, aren't we? So we'll use the serial-capital version of the name,
like any good computer company: AlpineGear.

<p> A domain search did turn up a link to an existing company
(http://www.alpinegear.com), but it's called Old Style Log Works, Inc., out
of Kalispell, Montana. They build custom log cabins. If you're more curious
than me, you can ask their web designer (http://www.snowdogweb.com) why
they have their client linked to that particular URL. But, since they don't
use Alpine or Gear or AlpineGear anywhere on their site, I'm sure they
won't mind our borrowing the name for this project. Yet it's a good lesson;
domain names are getting more scarce, and finding a good name that's also
an unused domain is getting harder.

<p> Now we have to create a logo for the company. Or, in this case, a
logotype.

<p> What's the difference? A logo is an icon, a picture, a 'bug' that
communicates the image (and hopefully the name) of the company without any
additional words. Think of the <a href="http://www.shell.com/">Shell Oil
Company</a> logo, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Computer</a>
logo, and the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">International Business Machines
Company</a> logo. (I'd bet many of you didn't even know that IBM stood for
International Business Machines.) A logotype is just the name used in a
particular typography that, hopefully, also communicates the image of the
company.  Recent examples are the <a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a>
logotype, the <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> logotype, and the
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> logotype, complete with its own
punctuation.

<p> Why use a logotype rather than a logo? Mere personal preference, some of
the time; either your own or that of the CEO of the company. But you'll
notice a pattern in the companies selected above: the ones that have a
product (something that needs an immediately recognizable sign on a
building or on a box on a shelf) use logos, and the ones that are service
providers use logotypes. It's not a perfect system, however; Ace Hardware
(definitely a product company) uses a logotype and many banks (definitely
service companies) use a logo. Since our company is going to sell many
products, most of them produced by other companies, we'll go with a
logotype.

<p> We want to emphasize the 'European' quality of the company, so we'll
pick the only font typically recognized by Americans as 'Euro', one usually
referred to as either Old English or German Black Letter, for the
'European' half of the name:

<div align="center">
<p> <img src="misc/seymour/Alpine.png" alt="" height="76" width="201" border="0">
</div>

<p> This is a font called Berliner. The image was created in Photoshop, but
the letterspacing was hand-tightened because the standard spacing looked
too 'open', and the capital A didn't look much like an A, except to a
19th-century German. (Logotypes must be grasped as images, rather than
'read' as words, and if the letters are farther apart it tends to invite
letter-by-letter 'reading' by the viewer.)

<p> For the 'equipment' half of the name, we'll use something that's not too
technical looking, something comfortable, that suggests our stuff is fun
and easy to use:

<div align="center">
<p> <img src="misc/seymour/Gear.png" alt="" height="72" width="123" border="0">
</div>

<p> This is ITC Garamond Book Condensed, also with tightened letterspacing.
It also had to be scaled, because  letter proportions are not the same in
all fonts; at 72 points, the capital G was much larger in this font than in
the Berliner. We picked Book Condensed because it gave us a similar
width-to-height ration for the lower case letters. Not perfectly, but
optically. You'll find a lot of things that 'look' right never measure
'right'...

<p> Now we have our logotype:

<div align="center">
<p> <img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGear.png" alt="" height="60" width="290" border="0">
</div>

<p> It needs to appear in color, in most usages, so we'll need to pick them.
We might as well come up with a 'color way' for our site at the same time.
A 'color way' (the industry term for a series of colors to be used
together) is merely the list of colors (whether PMS numbers for printing
inks or hex values for the Web) that will reinforce the image we wish to
show our customers.

<p> We want to look precise (like the Swiss), but fun-loving (like the
Italians). Yet we don't necessarily want to use particularly 'national'
colors, with their flags (red and white for the Swiss and green, white, and
red for the Italians) providing the most recognizable colors for each
country. We do want to look high-tech, and definitely ready for the
mountains. We don't want to look like rocks or dirt (brown), because that's
what you fall on. So we'll rely on the standard mountain-evoking colors of
blue (mountain air and streams) and white (snow), along with old reliable
high-tech gray:

<div align="center">
<table width="408" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" height="20">
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#99ccff"></td>
<td bgcolor="#3399ff"></td>
<td bgcolor="#6699cc"></td>
<td bgcolor="#0066cc"></td>
<td bgcolor="white"></td>
<td bgcolor="#666666"></td>
<td bgcolor="#cccccc"></td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p> Note that we've chosen several different related blues and a couple of
grays, using our favorite <a href="http://www.visibone.com">VisiBone</a>
swatch set; you'll eventually need to present information in varying
levels, whether in a brochure or a website, and having a preset color way
will help you organize it faster.

<p> Let's see what happens when we apply our color way to our logotype:

<div align="center">
<p> <img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.png" alt="" height="60" width="291" border="0">
</div>

<p> We'll also want to use it on colored backgrounds, so we need at least
one more variant:

<center>
<img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearOnBlue.png" alt="" height="60" width="291" border="0">
</center>

<p> <a id="anchor1" name="anchor1"></a>Now let's look at the basic <a
href="misc/seymour/Page1.html">landing page</a> for the company. (Click the small
white box at the top of the page to return here; it's not part of our
design. These pages have also been optimized for an 800x600 display, so set
your browser to display that size if your resolution is higher.) To the
basic page, we'll now <a href="misc/seymour/Page2.html">add the logo</a>. And then
<a href="misc/seymour/Page3.html">some simple navigation</a>. We'll put in <a
href="misc/seymour/Page4.html">some page links</a>. Finally, we'll display one of
the links, an <a href="misc/seymour/Page5.html">internal directory page</a>, which
points to further specific pages on the topic of High-Altitude Gear.

<p> Note that we've used, to a modest extent, our color way to help guide
the viewer. Other than using <b>bold</b> to show navigation, we've
deliberately left out font specifics on the sample pages, but if you wanted
to use particular fonts you could render the text as PNGs. (The gradient,
of course, would require making the images with transparent backgrounds.)
We've also set up a simple yet flexible navigation system, which would
allow for potentially hundreds of pages in this on-line catalog.

<p> The product pages for this site will require better definition of the
use of the color way, along with setting the style of the illustrations
and/or photographs and the text required to describe the objects in the
catalog. Next month we'll cover some of those aspects.

<p> I hope this has given you some things to think about in your own design
work. As ever, if there are specific topics you'd like covered in future
columns, don't hesitate to email me.

<em>
<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven
years old, and the state of the art was typing copy on Gestetner masters.
I've worked on every new technology since, but I still own an X-acto knife
and know how to use it.

<p> I've been a freelancer, and worked in advertising agencies, printing
companies, publishing houses, and marketing organizations in major
corporations. I also did a dozen years [1985-1997] at Apple Computer; my
first Macintosh was a Lisa with an astounding 1MB of memory, and my current
one is a Cube with a flat screen.

<p> I've had a website up since 1997, and created my latest one in 2004. I'm
still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.
