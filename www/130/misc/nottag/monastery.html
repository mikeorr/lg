<p>BOFHen: LART! LART! LART! LART! LART!</p>
<p>Arthur: Who are you?</p>
<p>BOFHen: We are the BOFHen who say... LART!</p>
<p>Arthur (horrified): No!  Not the BOFHen who say &quot;LART!&quot;</p>
<p>BOFHen: The same.</p>
<p>Arthur (to Bedevere): Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!</p>
<p>BOFHen: The BOFHen demand..... a clue!</p>
<p>Arthur: BOFHen, we are but simple travellers who seek free advice about
the administration of our home linux machines.</p>
<p>BOFHen: LART! LART! LART! LART! LART!</p>
<p>Bedevere: No!  Noooo!  Aaaugh!  No!</p>
<p>BOFHen: We shall LART you again... if you do not appease us.</p>
<p>Arthur: Well, what is it you want?</p>
<p>BOFHen: We want.....</p>
<p>(pregnant pause)</p>
<blockquote>
A 166 MHz Pentium!!!!</blockquote>
<p>(minor music)</p>
<p>Arthur: A <em>WHAT</em>?</p>
<p>BOFHen: LART! LART! LART! LART! LART!</p>
<p>Arthur: No!  No!  Please, please, no more!  We will find you a 166 MHz
Pentium.</p>
<p>BOFHen: You must return here with a 166 MHz Pentium... or else you will
never log in... alive.</p>
<p>Arthur: O BOFHen, you are just and fair, and we will return with a 166
MHz Pentium.</p>
<p>BOFHen: One that looks nice.</p>
<p>Arthur: Of course!</p>
<p>BOFHen: And not <em>too</em> expensive.</p>
<p>Arthur: Yes!</p>
<p>BOFHen (excitedly): THEN... Then, when you have found the 166 MHz
Pentium, you must place it here, beside this 25 MHz 486, only slightly
higher so we get the two-level effect with a little private ethernet
running down the middle.</p>
<p>Then, when you have found the 166 MHz Pentium, you must process ten
thousand e-mail messages a minute... wiiiiiithh... A HERRING!</p>
<p>(minor music)</p>
<p>Arthur: We shall do no such thing!</p>
<p>BOFHen: Oh, please!</p>
<p>Arthur: Process e-mail with a herring?  Not even qmail would run on
that!</p>
<p>BOFHen: AAugh!  AAAAAH!  Oww!! (writhe in pain)  Don't say that word!</p>
<p>Arthur: What word?</p>
<p>BOFHen: I cannot tell; suffice to say, it is one of the words the
denizens of alt.sysadmin.recovery cannot hear!</p>
<p>Arthur: How can we <em>not</em> say the word if you don't tell us how you
expect us to run the system fast enough not to queue mail?</p>
<p>(BOFHen are in pain again)</p>
<p>BOFHen: Ahhhh! He said it again!</p>
<p>Arthur: What, &quot;if&quot;?</p>
<p>BOFHen: No, not &quot;if&quot;!  You couldn't write many computer programs without
saying &quot;if&quot;!</p>
<p>Bedevere: My liege!  It's Sir Robin!</p>
<p>Sir Robin and his minstrels &quot;ride&quot; up.</p>
<p>Minstrels (singing): He's sacking it in, and packing it up,</p>
<p>Robin: My liege!  Finally that qmail ftp is done and I could come down
to the pub.</p>
<p>BOFHen: Now <em>he's</em> said the word!</p>
<p>Arthur: Surely you've not given up on trying to get foo.example.net
on-line by tomorrow morning?</p>
<p>Minstrels, by way of answering: He's sneaking away, and buggering off,</p>
<p>Robin: Shut up!  No no, no, I've got qmail building right now!</p>
<p>BOFHen: He said the word again!</p>
<p>Robin: ... I was... estimating the load at which we'd begin to queue
mail...</p>
<p>BOFHen: AAAAAAAuugh!</p>
<p>Robin: uh, here -- here while sitting on a lawn along the canal.</p>
<p>Arthur: No, there's a routing problem between the wireless network here
and www.qmail.org.</p>
<p>BOFHen: Aaaaaaugh!  Stop saying the word!!!!</p>
<p>Arthur (getting really amused by the BOFHen): OH, STOP MAKING ME QUEUE
MAIL!!</p>
<p>BOFHen: Ow!  He said it again!</p>

<p>It's just too bad that I had to lose the part where Roger the Shrubber
says in an accusatory tone, &quot;Are you relaying spam through that old
woman?&quot;</p>
