<h3>FTP</h3>

<p>
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) utilizes Transmission Connection Protocol (TCP) 
communication and listens on port 21 for incoming client connections by 
default. The connection to this port from the FTP client will form the control 
stream from which commands are passed from the FTP client to the FTP server 
and on occasion from the FTP server to the FTP client. FTP uses a separate 
connection for control and data. So for the actual file transfer to take place, 
a different connection is required which is called the data stream. Depending 
on the transfer mode, the process of setting up the data stream is different. 
Port 21 for control, port 20 for data.
</p>

<p>
The original FTP specification is an inherently unsecure method of transferring 
files because there is no method specified for transferring data in 
an encrypted fashion. This means that under most network configurations, user 
names, passwords, FTP commands and transferred files can be captured by anyone 
on the same network using a packet sniffer. The common solution to this problem 
is to use either SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol), or FTPS (FTP over SSL), 
which adds SSL or TLS encryption to FTP as specified in RFC 4217.
</p>

<h3>VSFTP</h3>

<p>
Very Secure File Transfer Protocol Daemon (VSFTPD) is an FTP server for 
UNIX-like systems, including Linux.  VSFTPD is a highly scalable and very 
configurable FTP server. The VSFTPD server is the default FTP application for 
RHEL 5.X. Many web hosting companiesâ€™ permit FTP because it a good mechanism to 
distribute files that are too large or impractical to distribute by other means 
such as e-mail. This makes VSFTP skills attractive if you are a systems 
administrator.  
</p>

<h3>Files involved</h3>

<p>
The files involved with vsftpd are located in /etc/vsftpd and are: ftpusers, 
user_list, vsftpd.conf,  and vsftpd_conf_migrate.sh. We will cover all of these
briefly except vsftpd_conf_migrate.sh which is just a migration script for old 
installations of vsftpd.   
</p>

<p>
Let us examine each file keeping in mind that depending on the options you 
select in the vsftpd.conf you may additionally need to create or modify a file 
that the directive needs to read for the option to work correctly. 
</p>

<h3>/etc/vsftpd/ftpusers</h3>

<p>
The text  file  ftpusers  contains a list of users that may not log in 
using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server daemon. This file is used 
not  merely  for system administration purposes but for improving security 
within a TCP/IP networked environment. It will typically contain a list  
of the users that either have no business using ftp or have too many 
privileges to be allowed to log in through the FTP server  daemon. 
Such  users usually include root, daemon, bin, uucp, and news.
</p>

<pre>
# Users that are not allowed to login via ftp 
root 
bin 
daemon 
adm 
lp 
sync 
shutdown 
halt 
mail 
news 
uucp 
operator 
games 
nobody 
</pre>

<h3>/etc/vsftpd/user_list</h3> 

<p>
The user_list file is one of those files that is acted upon differently 
depending on the invocation of a boolean directive in the vsftpd.conf file. 
If userlist_deny=NO in the vsftpd.conf file then it will only allow users 
in this file. If it is equal to YES which is the default, then the users in 
this file are not allowed to login via FTP and no password will be prompted 
for.  
</p>

<pre>
# vsftpd userlist 
# If userlist_deny=NO, only allow users in this file 
# If userlist_deny=YES (default), never allow users in this file, and 
# do not even prompt for a password. 
# Note that the default vsftpd pam config also checks /etc/vsftpd/ftpusers 
# for users that are denied. 
root 
bin 
daemon 
adm 
lp 
sync 
shutdown 
halt 
mail 
news 
uucp 
operator 
games 
nobody 
</pre>

<h3>/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf</h3>

<p>
This is the main configuration file for this daemon. It has a good amount of 
directives in it and adequate comments that explain them in sufficient detail. 
Although not all possible directives are listed in this file. The complete 
list is at <a href="http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html">http://vsftpd.
beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html.</a> 
</p>

<h3>Anonymous FTP configuration</h3>

<p>
To configure an anonymous FTP server for simple file distribution is a simple 
task. The copy of vsftpd that is packed with RHEL 5.X comes ready to run in 
this manner right out of the box. With one exception the vfstpd.conf file 
suggest that you use a unprivileged user for vsftpd. This is the name of the 
user that is used by vsftpd when it wants to be totally unprivileged. Note 
that this should be a dedicated user, rather than nobody. You want to use an 
unpriviledged user so that, if compromised, nothing can be done through that 
user to your server. The user nobody tends to be used for rather a lot of 
important things on most machines and that is what it defaults to. 
</p>

<p>
(always make a backup first cp /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf 
/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf.orig)
</p>
<pre class="code">
# It is recommended that you define on your system a unique user which the 
# ftp server can use as a totally isolated and unprivileged user. 
# 5-14-09 Joey  I edited below to allow vsftpd to use user ftpsecure with no privileges
#nopriv_user=ftpsecure 
<b>nopriv_user=ftpsecure</b> 
</pre>

<p>
The server is then started with the following command:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# service vsftpd start
</pre>

<p>
This will also create the /var/ftp and /var/ftp/pub directories. Once this 
is done you can start serving files via ftp. Simply place the files into 
the /var/ftp/pub directory and they will be available. This is one method 
that can be used to distribute files and is fine for a local area network 
that is behind a firewall. Other options exist and may be preferable 
depending of you need. You will be able to have users anonymously connect 
and download files. They will not be able to upload unless you configure 
the sever to allow for this and set a writable directory.
</p>

<h3>SSL Connections</h3>

<p>
If you are allowing local users to login via ftp then you may want to 
seriously consider using ssl for the simple reason that this will encrypt 
the password so it will not be sent over the wire in plain text. Below I 
will show one way to configure this. 
</p>

<p>
First we would generate the certificate which will require you to answer 
some questions.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@station17 ~]# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout /etc/pki/tls/certs/vsftpd.pem -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/vsftpd.pem 
</pre>

<p>
Once the certificate is generated we would need to add the following 
lines to the vsftpd.conf file to force users trying to connect to use 
ssl and therefore encrypt the sending of the password. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
ssl_enable=YES 
ssl_tlsv1=YES 
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
rsa_cert_file=/etc/pki/tls/certs/vsftpd.pem 
</pre>

<p>
Having made the changes you would need to restart the daemon and test it 
by using a FTP client  that supports connecting via ssl such as Coreftp 
<a href="http://www.coreftp.com/">http://www.coreftp.com.</a>
</p>

<img src="misc/prestia/cert.png" alt="Coreftp displaying SSL certificate" height="456" width="490">

<h3>Chrooting Users</h3> 

<p>
It is a common practice to force local users into a chroot home directory 
that are using the server to post web content. The way to do this is by 
locating the following section and adding the line chroot_local_user=YES 
if you notice the line is in the comments but not located at the beginning 
of the line like the rest of the commented out directives.
</p>

<pre class="code">
# You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home 
# directory. If <b>chroot_local_user</b> is YES, then this list becomes a list of 
# users to NOT chroot(). 
# 5-14-09 Joey  I added the following line to chroot users on the system to their 
# home directories that are using ftp clients to upload web files.
<b>chroot_local_user=YES</b> 
#chroot_list_enable=YES 
# (default follows) 
#chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd/chroot_list 
# 
</pre>

<h3>Changing the Anonymous Root Directory</h3>

<p>
Perhaps you have a non-standard directory with the files you want to 
distribute located in it. The anon_root directive allows you to set the root 
directory to whatever you want. Simply add this directive and  your chosen 
path as I have shown below and restart vsftpd. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
anon_root=/powervault/distros 
</pre>

<h3>Hiding Files</h3>

<p>
This option can be used to set a pattern for filenames (and directory 
names etc.) which should be hidden from directory listings. Despite 
being hidden, the files / directories etc. are fully accessible to 
clients who know what names to actually use. Items will be hidden if 
their names contain the string given by hide_file, or if they match 
the regular expression specified by hide_file. Note that vsftpd's 
regular expression matching code is a simple implementation which is 
a subset of full regular expression functionality. 
Example: hide_file={*.mp3,.hidden,hide*,h?} 
</p>

<pre class="code">
hide_file={hidden,hide,private} 
</pre>

<h3>Using a Banner</h3>

<p>
There are two methods of using a banner with vsftpd. The first is commented 
out and suitable for one liners in the vsftpd.conf file where you can just 
specify the string right there after the directive. Simply uncomment it and 
change it, then restart vsftpd.
</p>

<pre class="code">
# 
# You may fully customize the login banner string: 
#ftpd_banner=Welcome to blah FTP service. 
# 
</pre>

<p>
This is the one that is preferable to use if you need to specify a large 
amount of text to display the appropriate warning message. 
</p>

<p>
This option is the name of a file containing text to display when someone 
connects to the server. If set, it overrides the banner string provided by 
the ftpd_banner option. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
banner_file=/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd_banner
</pre>

<h3>Conclusion</h3> 

<p>
There are a great deal of options available to further configure the vsftpd 
server. The man page vsftpd.conf(5) has a a listing of them all. Be aware 
that you can use TCP wrappers with vsftpd to protect the service in 
conjunction with any other security you may already have in place. Although 
being insecure it can be adapted to be run in a relatively secure fashion. 
Always make sure you take the necessary time to secure it and throughly test 
your security.

Joey was born in Phoenix and started programming at the age fourteen on
 a Timex Sinclair 1000. He was driven by hopes he might be able to do
 something with this early model computer. He soon became proficient in
 the BASIC and Assembly programming languages. Joey became a programmer
 in 1990 and added COBOL, Fortran, and Pascal to his repertoire of
 programming languages. Since then has become obsessed with just about
 every aspect of computer science. He became enlightened and discovered
 RedHat Linux in 2002 when someone gave him RedHat version six. This 
 started off a new passion centered around Linux. Currently Joey is 
 completing his degree in Linux Networking and working on campus
 for the college's RedHat Academy in Arizona. He is also on the staff of
 the Linux Gazette as the Mirror Coordinator.
