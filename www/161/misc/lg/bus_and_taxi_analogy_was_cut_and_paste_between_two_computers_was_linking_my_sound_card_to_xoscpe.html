Hello,

&gt; Don't know how to do that in Linux.  Can't seem to figure it out.
&gt; 
&gt; Judging by how my query on siggen is being handled I despair of ever
&gt; figuring  out these other issues.  Maybe I should stick to Windows.
&gt; I am just getting more confused by all the jargon.

<p>
Here is an analogy that may help you understand the distinction.
</p>

<p>
A man who has only ever ridden in a taxi decides to take a bus one
day. The bus stops and he gets in along with the other people waiting
at the stop.
</p>

<p>
He starts to occupy a seat when the driver (or in India the
conductor) asks him to buy a ticket before getting in. He is
annoyed: "I have to pay <em>before</em> I get to my destination?"
However, he agrees as tries to pay $50 -- which is refused. Other
passengers try to help him and suggest that he use a smaller
amount. Somehow he manages to find some small change and pay
his fare.
</p>

<p>
He then tells the bus driver he wants to go to the airport. The people
in the bus tell him he got into the wrong bus and that he should get
off this bus at the next stop and get into a different one. Now he is
quite annoyed and has started yelling at people saying that they are
making him really confused. He tells them that he has taken Shuttle
services (which are a shared transport service) and even there he has
never been made to do things so differently from a simple taxi ride.
</p>

<p>
...
</p>

<p>
There are many ways this story could end:
</p>

<p>
 1. One kind old lady says she is going to somewhere near the airport
 and will get off with him at the next stop and get him on the right
 bus. The guy calms down and agrees.
</p>

<p>
 2. The guy finds a booklet in the bus that explains the way the bus
 system operates. He is fascinated and reads it all the way through.
 Of course, as he is engrossed in his reading he then reaches the last
 stop of the bus he is on but by then he knows the system well enough
 that he can get to the airport from there by bus.
</p>

<p>
 3. The guy yells and screams at everybody and gets off at the next
 stop and vows to always only travel by taxi ever again.
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.

Cheers,              Crypto lets someone say "Hi! I absolutely definitely have 
Rick Moen            a name somewhat like the name of a large familiar 
rick@linuxmafia.com  organization, and I'd like to steal your data!" and lots 
McQ!  (4x80)         of users will say "OK, fine, whatever."    -- John Levine

Thanks for the kudos. A moment of inspiration, growing no doubt, out
of many hours of interaction with the fun-filled folks of TAG!
</p>

<p>
(I also have a feeling that it is based on something I have heard
or seen somewhere ...).

Thanks for saying that, Rick - I was just telling Kat much the same
thing while reading it. We'll preserve it, in standard LG fashion, for
the education of the young. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Our lovely Mailbag Editor assures me that she will make a special effort
to include it.
