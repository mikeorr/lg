<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
Hope you all are well.
</p>

<p>
I have designed a script which compress some files and store those files in a 
folder named by date like 10-11-2008 ( for 10th Nov 2008 ) and uploads it in 
a remote ftp server through lftp. the script runs every day. As the FTP space 
is little after every 15 or so days the FTP space qouata is full. I like to 
include a section in the script which will check the folders in the ftp 
server through lftp and deletes the folders which  already 10 days matured.
</p>

<p>
Can any one suggest me how to do this throug lftp ?
</p>

<p>
thanks a lot
</p>

Lftp has an rm -r command, which is the obvious option to use. 
</p>

<p>
You can probably work out the directory names to remove with a little bit of 
perl/python to do the date calculations.

Hello,

<p>
I stuck exactly here. The folder names are like 10-11-2008 11-11-2008 
12-11-2008 and so on. lftp is not suppose to support pattern matching; even 
it is not possible to calculate the date with in lftp <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-(">
Any suggestion is most welcome.
</p>

<p>
thanks

<p>
Obviously you need to do the calculation externally. I don't use lftp, but I 
think you should try something like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ DATE=`perl -we "date calculation"`
$ lftp -c rm -r $DATE

The first problem is the format of the date you're using. Yes, it's
possible to calculate using those - but you have to do some really
heavy-duty processing (leap years, etc.) before you can get a stable
base for calculating anything. You'd be much better off using either the
RF3339 format ('date --rfc-3339=date') or the epoch (time in seconds
since 1/1/1970 12:00:00; e.g., "perl -we'print time'.) The latter is
especially useful for the kind of thing you're trying to do.
</p>

<p>
The other approach would be to ignore whatever you used for the name and
to use the file's timestamp - just as the script that I pubbed here last
month did.
</p>

<pre>
savedir=/my/backup/directory
keeptime=30		# Delete files older than $keeptime days
/usr/bin/find $savedir -ctime +$keeptime -delete

Thanks for your response.

<p>
I can access the remote ftp space through FTP, hence I have to check if the 
script can run internally via lftp.

Well, nothing can "run internally" via FTP - that's not how FTP works.
You can execute commands on your <em>local</em> machine via the "!command"
syntax, but not on the remote machine. Given that FTP passwords and such
go across the wire as plain text, it wouldn't make much sense to allow
an FTP client to exec a command, right?
</p>

<p>
For what you describe, I suggest you consider SSH. It should work just
fine.

Yes, with ssh all these could work fine. Unfortunately I the remote ftp space 
provides ony ftp access.

Your script runs every day. So just delete the folder from 10 days ago.
</p>

<p>
If you once, manually, delete anything older than that, then as the
script keeps running, it will never build up again.
</p>

<p>
Your script currently does something like
</p>

<pre>
new_folder=$(date +%d-%m-%Y)
lftp_upload_stuff_to $new_folder
</pre>

<p>
where lftp_upload_stuff_to presumably includes "mkdir" and "mput".
</p>

<p>
So add in
</p>

<pre>
old_folder=$(date -d '10 days ago' +%d-%m-%Y)
lftp_delete $old_folder
</pre>

<p>
where lftp_delete will presumably include "rm -r".
</p>

<p>
All the calculation should happen in the script that drives the ftp client,
not in the client itself.

Good luck,
