<h1>Stepper motor driver for your Linux Computer</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/sreejith.html">Sreejith N</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>An introduction intended for people with no prior device driver
knowledge</h3>

<p>This article is intended for those newbie Linux users who wish
to use their Linux-box for some <strong>real</strong> work. I will
also share some interesting experiments that I did with my AMD
machine.</p>

<h3>INIT</h3>

<p>Learning new stuff is fun, but can be a bit frustrating. So, you
want to write a <em>device driver</em>. The name itself is high-tech! You
have some skills in the C programming language and want to explore the
same. Also, you've written a few normal programs to run as processes
in user space, and now you want to enter kernel space - where the
real action takes place. Why Linux device drivers? The answer
is,</p>

<ul>
<li>For fun</li>

<li>For profit (Linux is HOT right now, especially embedded
Linux)</li>

<li>Because you can! The source is with you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although it is possible to learn device driver coding by
reading some books and PDFs written by the masters, this is a
complicated and time-consuming approach. We will take the quick and
easy approach, which is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find some pre-written, working code</li>

<li>Understand how this code works</li>

<li>Modify it to suit our needs</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's make an easy start with some fundamentals.</p>

<h3>Stepper motor basics</h3>

<p>Stepper motors are special direct-current (DC) motors, typically used in
applications like camera zoom drive and film feed, fax machines, printers,
copying machines, paper feeders/sorters, disk drives and robotics.</p>

<p>A DC stepper motor translates current pulses into motor rotation. A
typical unipolar (single voltage) motor contains four winding coils.
Applying voltage to these coils forces the motor to advance one step. In
normal operation, two winding coils are activated at the same time, causing
the motor to move one step clockwise. If the sequence is applied in
reverse order, the motor will run counterclockwise. The speed of rotation
is controlled by the frequency of the pulses.</p>

<p><img alt="Basic Stepper Motor Conceptual Wiring Diagram" src=
"misc/sreejith/windingdiag.png">
</p>

<p>A typical full step rotation is 1.8 degrees, or 200 steps per rotation
(360 degrees).  By changing the time delay between successive steps, the
speed of the motor can be regulated, and by counting the number of steps,
the rotation angle can be controlled.</p>

<h3>Hardware ideas</h3>

<p>The circuit diagram for the drive is shown below.</p>

<p> <img alt="Unipolar Stepper Motor Drive Circuit" src=
"misc/sreejith/motordriveckt.png"></p>

<p>The circuit consists of four TIP122 power transistors (T1, T2, T3 and T4),
220&Omega; resistors (R1, R2, R3 and R4), 3.3K&Omega; resistors
(R5, R6, R7 and R8), 1N4148 freewheeling diodes (D1, D2, D3 and D4), and
one LM7407 buffer chip (IC1). The 7407 buffer used here is a hex-type
open-collector high-voltage buffer. The 3.3K&Omega; resistors 
are the pull-up resistors for the open-collector buffer. The input for this buffer
comes from the parallel port. The output of the buffer is of higher
current capacity than the parallel port output, which is necessary for
triggering the transistor; it also isolates the circuit from the PC
parallel port and hence provides extra protection against potentially
dangerous feedback voltages that may occur if the circuit fails. The diode
connected across the supply and the collector is used as a freewheeling
diode and also to protect the transistor from the back EMF of the motor
inductance. The motor used in my experiments (and documented here) was an
STM 901 from <a href="http://www.srijandrives.com/product.htm">Srijan
Control Drives</a>.</p>

<p>During normal operation, the output pattern from the PC drives
the buffer, and corresponding transistors are switched on. This
leads to the conduction of current through those coils of the
stepper motor which are connected to the energized transistor.
This makes the motor move forward one step. The next pulse will
trigger a new combination of transistors, and hence a new set of
coils, leading to the motor moving another step. The scheme of
excitation that we have used here has already been shown above.</p>

<h3>How do we interface the hardware with the Linux-box?</h3>

<p>You can use either the parallel port or the serial port for this
purpose. We will be using parallel port as a digital interface
between PC and the hardware (stepper motor drive). The parallel port
can be considered as a register, and the I/O operations can be done
simply by writing bit patterns (numbers like 0xA, 10, '1010', etc.)
to this register. The base address of parallel port is 0x378. The PC
parallel port is a 25 pin D-shaped female connector in the back of
the computer. It is normally used for connecting computer to
printer, but many other types of hardware for that port are
available.</p>

<p><!-- IMG height=200 alt=[pport]
src="misc/sreejith/pport.png"
width=300 --> <img alt="Parallel Port Pinout" src=
"misc/sreejith/pport.png"></p>

<p>The original IBM PC's Parallel Printer Port had a total of 12
digital outputs and 5 digital inputs accessed via 3 consecutive
8-bit ports in the processor's I/O space.</p>

<ol>
<li>8 output pins accessed via the DATA Port</li>

<li>5 input pins (one inverted) accessed via the STATUS Port</li>

<li>4 output pins (three inverted) accessed via the CONTROL
Port</li>

<li>The remaining 8 pins are grounded</li>
</ol>

<p>To read a byte (8 bits) coming <em>into</em> a port, call <code>inb
(port)</code>; to <em>output</em> a byte, call <code>outb (value,
port)</code> (please note the order of the parameters). The data outputs
are provided by an 74LS374 totem-pole TTL integrated circuit, which can
source (+) 2.6 mA and sink (-) 24 mA. The best option for preventing
damage to the port is to use optocouplers; by doing so, the port is
completely electrically isolated from external hardware devices.</p>

<h3>What is a module?</h3>

<p>Modules are pieces of code that can be loaded into and unloaded from a
running kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel
without the need to reboot the system. Device drivers are a class of
modules which allows the kernel to control hardware connected to the system.
In this article, I have written a simple device driver to control a stepper
motor drive; now it is time to log on to your console and start coding your
very first module.</p>

<p>Let's have an unusual start! You have written so many "Hello,
World" programs. So this time something different - "No gates, No
windows, it's open". You will get these words printed on your
console when you insert your first module.</p>

<pre class="code">
/*mymodule.c - The simplest kernel module.*/
#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt; /* Needed by all modules */
#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt; /* Needed for KERN_ALERT */

int init_module(void)
{
        printk("&lt;1&gt;No gates, No windows, it's open\n");
        return 0;/* A non-0 return means init_module failed; module can't be loaded.*/
}

void cleanup_module(void)
{
        printk("Goodbye\n");
}
</pre>

<p>The "start" function in a kernel module is init_module () which
is called when the module is insmoded into the kernel, and the
"end" (cleanup) function cleanup_module() is called just before it
is rmmoded.</p>

<h3>Compiling kernel modules</h3>

<p>Kernel modules need to be compiled with certain GCC options to
make them work. In addition, they also need to be compiled with certain
symbols defined. This is because kernel header files need to behave
differently, depending on whether we're compiling a kernel module or
executable.</p>

<ol>
<li>-C: A kernel module is not an independent executable, but an
<em>object file</em> which will be linked into the kernel during runtime
using insmod.</li>

<li>-O2: The kernel makes extensive use of inline functions, so
modules must be compiled with the optimization flag turned on.
Without optimization, some of the assembler macro calls will fail. This
will cause loading the module to fail, since insmod won't find those
functions in the kernel.</li>

<li>-D_KERNEL_: Defining this symbol tells the header files that
the code will be run in kernel mode, not as a user process.</li>

<li>-W -Wall : Enable All Warnings.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a href="misc/sreejith/Makefile">Makefile</a> (2.4.24
kernel)</h3>
 
<p> As an example, let's take a look at the options we're going to use in
compiling the "stepper" module that we'll see a little later in this
article:</p>

<pre class="code">
TARGET := stepper
WARN   := -W -Wall
INCLUDE:= /usr/src/linux-2.4/include
#INCLUDE:= -isystem /usr/src/`uname -r`/include
CFLAGS := -O2 -DMODULE -D__KERNEL__ ${WARN} -I${INCLUDE}
all : stepper.o
#${TARGET}.o : ${TARGET}.c
clean:
        rm -rf *.o
</pre>

<p>You can learn more about <code>make</code> utility by reading "man make".</p>

<h3>Anatomy of device drivers</h3>

<p>There is a lot of documentation on the Web, including PDFs and ebooks,
on device drivers; also, you can download some useful guides from The Linux
Documentation Project website. For the time being, just read these
points carefully; later, you can move on to some detailed references.</p>

<ul>
<li>A device driver has two sides. One side talks to the rest of
the kernel and to the hardware, and the other side talks to the
user.</li>

<li>To talk to the kernel, the driver registers with subsystems to
respond to events. Such an event might be the opening of a file,
writing some useful data, the plugging in of a pen-drive (USB
device), etc.</li>

<li>Since Linux is a type of UNIX, and in UNIX everything is a file, users
talk with device drivers through device files, which are like a digital
representation of a hardware device.</li>

<li>A stepper is a <em>character</em> device, and thus the user talks to it
through a character device file. The other common type of device file is
<em>block</em>. We will only discuss character device files in this
article.</li>

<li>The user controls the stepper motor through the /dev/stepper
device file</li>

<li>When the user opens /dev/stepper, the kernel calls stepper's
open routine</li>

<li>When the user closes /dev/stepper, the kernel calls stepper's
release routine</li>

<li>When the user reads or writes from or to /dev/stepper - I think
you got the idea...</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's examine our code.</p>

Follow this <a href="misc/sreejith/stepper.c">link</a> to download
the code.

<h3>Driver initialization</h3>

<ol>
<li>The init_module() function is called on the driver's
initialization</li>

<li>The cleanup_module () function is called when the driver is
removed from the system</li>

<li>The init function will register hooks that will get the
driver's code called when the appropriate event happens</li>

<li>There are various hooks that can be registered: file
operations, PCI operations, USB operations, network operations.
Ours is a file operation.</li>

<li>The driver registers a character device tied to a given major
number and a user can create access points corresponding to this
major number.The following command will do it for you:</li>
</ol>

<pre class="code">
mknod /dev/stepper c 254 0
</pre>

<h3>How stuff works</h3>

<p>A user space program can write commands to the device file to
rotate the stepper motor through a desired angle at desired speed.
The speed of rotation depends upon the delay given in the user
program.</p>

<p>The built in commands for controlling the stepper motor is given
below.</p>

<ul>
<li>H ----------- Help</li>

<li>h ----------- Half-step mode</li>

<li>f ----------- Full-step mode</li>

<li>F ----------- Rotate one step clockwise</li>

<li>R ----------- Rotate one step anti-clockwise</li>
</ul>

<h3>File operations</h3>

<p>The driver makes use of the following device file
operations:</p>

<ol>
<li>open for allocating resources</li>

<li>release for releasing resources</li>

<li>write the required pattern to the parallel port.</li>

<li>there is no reading in our program, but if you want, you
can read the current pattern at the parallel port.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you write 'F' once to "/dev/stepper", the motor will rotate
through its minimum step-angle. If you keep on writing 'F' to
"/dev/stepper", it will rotate continuously. The "write" system
call will do this for you.</p>

<pre class="code">
#include "<a href="misc/sreejith/header.h">header.h</a>"

main ()
{
        char t,buf[6] = {'h','f','F','R','H','q'};
        int fd,rt,i,j;
        size_t count;
        printf("Select Mode \n(1) [Half-step clockwise]\n(2) [Half-step
anti-clockwise]\n(3) [Full-step clockwise]\n(4) [Full-step anti-clockwise]  :
");
        t=getchar();
        if(t=='1') {i=0; j=2;}
        else if(t=='2') {i=0; j=3;}
        else if(t=='3') {i=1; j=2;}
        else {i=1; j=3;}
        fd=open("stepper",O_WRONLY);
        rt=write(fd,&amp;amp;buf[i],count);
        for(i=0;i&lt;1000;i++) {
                rt=write(fd,&amp;buf[j],count);
                usleep (100000);
        }
        close(fd);
}
</pre>

<p> Also, if you are familiar with shell scripting, you can do the same by
writing a simple shell script. Now you can start talking to the device
/dev/stepper. It will be really interesting if you talk in Linux's language
- I mean a <a href="misc/sreejith/sscript">shell script</a>. Just use
simple echo commands as given below:</p>

<pre class="code">
echo H &gt; /dev/stepper
</pre>

<p>Do you think that Morpheus is talking to you? Your kernel is replying to
your commands. How's that! Now, you too can feel like you are The One.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I hope I have given you some basics of device driver coding and perhaps
a "small step toward Robotics". Here is a detailed schematic of a
stepper-controlled <a href= "misc/sreejith/robotichandscematic.png">robotic
arm</a>; feel free to <a href= "misc/sreejith/robotichand/diagram.html">try
it out</a>. One can connect three stepper motors simultaneously to the PC
parallel port and can achieve step-wise mobility; this allows anyone to
start thinking of complex innovative mobility with multi-threaded
programming in Linux. You can also add C functions to our module to enhance
its functionality... the possibilities are endless!</p>
