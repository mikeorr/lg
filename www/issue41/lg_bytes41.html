Open Source Modeller for Povray & AutoCAD forming nicely
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Thu, 29 Apr 1999 12:00:41 +1200<BR> 
<P>
An Open Source 3D Modelling program using GTK is shaping up; it's called
"Giram" (Giram Is Really A Modeller). Giram can already create scenes
and provide a front-end to Povray, the clever part being that it both
reads and writes Povray scripts - the only one that does that we know
of. AutoCAD import and export filters are shaping nicely and we would
like to include other formats too. Animation and post-production
features are planned.
<P>
If you are interested, or would like to help create the free 3D modeller
that Linux so badly needs, please visit the Giram website.

Programming with Qt Book Release
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Fri, 23 Apr 1999 09:48:58 -0700 (PDT)<BR> 
Sebastopol, CA--Qt is an easy-to-use, multi-platform C++ GUI toolkit.
With Qt, a developer can write an application once and run it on UNIX,
Windows 95/98, and Windows NT platforms. Linux developers can acquire Qt
for free (unless they wish to develop closed-source commercial
applications in which case they must purchase a license). Now O'Reilly
and Associates has published a book on Qt"Programming with Qt" by
Matthias Kalle Dalheimer.
<P>
Qt's benefits are impressive, but the learning curve can be steep. Qt
comes with excellent reference documentation, but beginners often find
the included tutorial is not enough to really get started with Qt. "We
felt there was a need for a book that  guides you through the steps of
writing a Qt application  and presents all of the GUI elements in Qt,
along with advice about when and how to use them, so that you can make
full use of the toolkit." said Elke Hansel, Managing Director of
O'Reilly Germany, "There's also lots of information for seasoned Qt
programmers, including material on advanced 2D transformations,
drag-and-drop, and writing custom image file filters."

<P>
Johannesburg, 3 May 1999 - The Chernobyl virus, which was
responsible for destroying data from thousands of hard drives
throughout the world, has proven just how powerful PowerQuest Corporation's
data recovery tool Lost & Found can be when facing damaged data. People 
throughout the world are using Lost & Found to retrieve files from
their Chernobyl-infected computers and, in all known cases, have recovered
100 percent of the lost, deleted or corrupted data. Search & Rescue, the
enterprise version of Lost & Found, is also being used to help businesses
recover from virus infections. Both products are available from
Johannesburg-based software distributor OS/2 Express SA.
<P>
Lost & Found is a fast and easy way to restore lost data on your PC.
Lost & Found automatically recovers and restores data after virus
infection, accidental (or intentional) data loss, a disk crash or
logical system failure. As long as the disk is still spinning, Lost &
Found can locate and recover almost any lost file for FAT and FAT32.
In addition, Lost & Found does not need to be installed prior to data
loss.
