<HR>
<EM>The basic features of ptrace were explained in 
<A HREF="../issue81/sandeep.html">Part I</A>. We saw a small example too. As I
said earlier, the main applications of ptrace are accessing memory or registers
of a process being run (either for debugging or for some evil purposes). So
first we should have some basic idea on the binary format of executables - then
only we know how and where to access them. So I shall give you a small tutorial
on ELF, the binary format used in Linux. In the last section of this article,
we find a small program which accesses the registers and memory of another one
and modifies them so as to change the output of that process, by injecting some
extra code.</EM>
<HR>
<P><B>Note:</B>  Please don't get confused. Definitely this is an article about ptrace,
not about ELF. But a basic knowledge of ELF is required for accessing the core images 
of processes. So it should be explained first.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="s1">1. What is ELF?</A></H2>

<P>ELF stands for Executable and Linking Format. It defines the format of 
executable binaries used on Linux - and also for relocatable, shared object and
core dump files too. ELF is used by both linkers and loaders. They view ELF
from two sides, so both should have a common interface.
<P>
<P>The structure of ELF is such that it has many sections and segments.
Relocatable files have section header tables, executable files have program
header tables, and shared object files have both. In the coming sections I shall
explain what these headers are.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="s2">2. ELF Headers</A></H2>

<P>Every ELF file has an ELF header. It always starts at 
offset 0 in the file. It contains the details of the binary file - should 
it be interpreted, what data structures are related to the file, etc.
<P>
<P>The format of the header is given below (taken from /usr/src/include/linux/elf.h)

<P>As said above, linkers treat the file as a set of logical sections described by a

program header table. The following section gives details on sections and 
segments/program headers.

<H2>3.1 ELF Sections and Section Headers</H2>

<P>The binary file is viewed as a collection of sections which are arrays of bytes 
of which no bytes are duplicated. Even though there will be helper information to 
correctly interpret the contents of the section, the applications may interpret 
in its own way.
<P>
<P>There will be a section header table which is an array of section headers.
The zeroth entry of the table is always NULL and describe no part of the 
binary. Each section header has the following format:

<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Loading The ELF File</A></H2>

<P>We have got some idea about the structure of ELF object files. Now we have to 
know how and where these files are loaded for execution. Usually we just type 
program name at the shell prompt. In fact a lot of interesting things happen
after  the return key is hit. 
<P>
<P>First the shell calls the 
standard libc function which in turn calls the kernel routine. Now the ball is 
in kernel's court. The kernel opens the file and finds out the type/format of
the executable. Then loads ELF and needed libraries, initializes the program's
stack, and finally passes control to the program code.
<P>
<P>The program gets loaded to 0x08048000 (you can see this in /proc/pid/maps)
and the stack starts from 0xBFFFFFFF (stack grows to numerically small addresses).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="s5">5. Code Injection</A></H2>

<P>We have seen the details of the programs being loaded in the memory. So when
a process is given and its memory space known, we can trace it (if we have
permission) and access the private data structures of the process. It is very 
easy to say this, but not that easy to do it. Why not make a try? 
<P>
<P>First of all, let's write a program to access the registers of another 
program and 
modify it. Here we use the following values of <CODE>request</CODE>.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>PTRACE_ATTACH : Attach to the process pid.
</LI>
<LI>PTRACE_DETACH : Detach from the process pid. 
<P><B>Note :</B> Do not forget to call this, otherwise the process will
stay in stopped mode and is hard to recover.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>PTRACE_GETREGS : This copies the process' registers into the struct
pointed by data (addr is ignored). This structure is 
<CODE>struct user_regs_struct</CODE> defined as this, in asm/user.h.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
struct user_regs_struct {
                long ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi, ebp, eax;
                unsigned short ds, __ds, es, __es;
                unsigned short fs, __fs, gs, __gs;
                long orig_eax, eip;
                unsigned short cs, __cs;
                long eflags, esp;
                unsigned short ss, __ss;
        };
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

</LI>
<LI>PTRACE_SETREGS : Does just the reverse of GETREGS.
</LI>
<LI>PTRACE_POKETEXT : This copies 32 bits from the address pointed by data
in the addr address of the traced process.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Now we are going to inject a small piece of our code to image of the process being traced and force the process to execute our code by changing its instruction pointer.
<P>
<P>What we do is very simple. First we attach the process, and then read the 
register contents of the process. Now insert the code which we want to get 
executed in some location of the stack and the instruction pointer of the 
process is changed to that location. Finally we detach the process. Now the 
process starts to execute and will be executing the injected code.
<P>
<P>We have two source files, one is the assembly code to be injected and 
other is the one which traces the process. I shall provide a small program 
which we may trace.
<P>
<P>The source files
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="./misc/sandeep/Tracer.c">Tracer.c</A></LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="./misc/sandeep/Code.S">Code.S</A></LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="./misc/sandeep/Sample.c">Sample.c</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Now compile the files.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#cc Sample.c -o loop
#cc Tracer.c Code.S -o catch
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Go to another console and run the sample program by typing
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#./loop
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Come back and execute the tracer to catch the looping process and change its
output. Type
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
#./catch `ps ax | grep "loop" | cut -f 3 -d ' '`
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>Now go to where the sample program 'loop' runs and watch what happens. 
Definitely your play with ptrace has begun.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Looking Forward</A></H2>

<P>In the first part we traced a process and counted its number of instructions.
In this part we studied the ELF file structure and injected a small piece of 
code into some process. In next part I would expect to access the memory space
of some process. Till then, bye from Sandeep S.
