<hr>

<p>As the community effort to develop a Linux certification effort matures, we need <strong>your</strong>
help to move the process to the next level. It seems hard to believe that it's only been
four months since the <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue33/york.html">October LG
article</a> that launched this particular initiative. In that time, we have gathered
together over 120 people interested in developing the certification program, joined
together with another group that was working on certification since the spring of 1998 and
have moved the whole process along quite far. (See my <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue34/york.html">November</a> and <a
href="http://linuxgazette.net/issue35/york.html">December</a> articles for a history
of the process.)&nbsp; This month's article will address:

<h2><a name="New Web Site">New Web Sites</a></h2>

<p>This month we are pleased to announce a new web site describing our proposed
certification program:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.linuxinstitute.org/">http://www.linuxinstitute.org/</a>
</p>

<p>Please visit the web pages, read about the program we are proposing, and jump on board
to help us out!</p>

<p>Credit for the site (and thanks!) is due to <a href="mailto:evan@starnix.com">Evan
Leibovitch</a> who set up the site, established the domain name, and is serving as our
webmaster.</p>

<p>I also have updated a web site I established a few months ago to provide a central
listing of Linux training resources at:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.linuxtraining.org/">http://www.linuxtraining.org/</a>
</p>

<p>If you are a training provider, courseware vendor, or independant instructor, please
visit that site and submit a listing so that I may include you on the list.</p>

<h2><a name="Revised Mission Statement">Revised Mission Statement</a></h2>

<p>After much discussion, we have arrived at a mission statement that defines the goal of
our certification effort:</p>

<blockquote>
  <font COLOR="#000066"><i>We believe in the need for a standardized, multi-national, and
  respected program to certify levels of individual expertise in Linux. This program must be
  able to satisfy the requirements of Linux professionals, as well as organizations which
  would employ or contract them. </I></font> </blockquote> 
<blockquote> <font color="#000066"><I> 
  Our goal is to design and deliver such a program from within the Linux community, using
  both volunteer and hired resources as necessary. We resolve to undertake a
  well-considered, open, disciplined development process, leading directly to the
  establishment of a recognized and widely-endorsed Linux certification body.</i></font>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks are due to Evan, Chuck Mead, Tom Peters and a number of other individuals who
hashed this out on the linux-cert mailing list.</p>

<h2><a name="Logo Contest">Logo Contest</a></h2>

<p>As part of our effort to build this new web site, we are sponsoring a contest for a
logo for our project. Several entries have already been received. Please visit <a
href="http://www.linuxinstitute.org/tli/logos.html">http://www.linuxinstitute.org/tli/logos.html</a>
if you have an interest in creating a graphic for the site.</p>

<h2><a name="How You Can Help">How You Can Help</a></h2>

<p>We need you!&nbsp; If we are to pull off a program of this size and scale as a
community effort, we need the help of everyone who may be interested in having a
professional certification program for Linux.&nbsp; Whether you have a large or small
amount of time to help... whether you are a Linux &quot;guru&quot; or a
&quot;newbie&quot;... you <strong>can</strong> help make this program a reality!</p>

<p>To help out, you need to join one or more of our <a
href="http://www.linuxinstitute.org/tli/involved.html">mailing lists</a>.&nbsp; Before you
decide how you can help, please read about our proposed <a
href="http://www.linuxinstitute.org/tli/program.html">program</a> (which has been arrived
at over the past four months of discussions) and the <a
href="http://www.linuxinstitute.org/tli/structure.html">structure</a> we are building to
move the whole process forward.&nbsp; I would suggest you also browse the <a
href="http://www.linuxcare.com/linux-cert/archive">archive</a> of our linux-cert mailing
list to understand the discussions we've had to date.</p>

<p>After reading our information, please plunge on in, join a list (or lists) and help us
out!</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's been an exciting time for us all. We've had some great debates and argued many
philosophical and practical points. We have a lot more to do - and will doubtless have
many more debates ahead of us.&nbsp; But above all, it's been a very professional group of
people focused on getting a program accomplished!&nbsp; The market has changed, too. There
is no longer a question of <em>should</em> a Linux certification exist (which our group
never debated - we have only asked for people to be involved if they want to see a
certification program happen), but rather <em>who</em> will define that certification
program.&nbsp; Will it evolve out of the community?&nbsp; Or will it be specified by a
vendor or distributor?&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We believe it should come from the community and we
hope you will join us in that effort!</em></p>

<p>Please join us on the list(s) and let's make this happen!</p>
