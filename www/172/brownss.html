<h1>Recovering FAT Directory Stubs with SleuthKit</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

<p>
When I accidentally dropped an old Windows Mobile PocketPC onto the floor
at the exact moment it was writing to a memory card, the memory card's
master FAT was corrupted and several directories disappeared from the root
directory.  Since it had not been backed up for some time, I connected the
memory card to a Linux system for investigation. (At this point it is
important not to actually mount the card. If you have an automounter, turn
it off before connecting. You have to access it as a device, for example
<tt>/dev/sdb1</tt>. To see which device it is, you can do <tt>ls
/dev/sd*</tt> both before and after connecting it and see what appears. The
following tools read from the device directly, or from an image of it
copied using the <tt>dd</tt> command.)
</p>

<p>
<tt>fsck.vfat -r</tt> offered to return over 1 GB of data to the free
space.  This meant there was over 1 GB of data that was neither indexed in
the FAT nor listed as free space, i.e. that was the lost directories.  It
was important not to let <tt>fsck.vfat</tt> mark it as free yet, as this
would impair data recovery.  <tt>fsck.vfat</tt> can also search this data
for contiguous blocks and reclaim them as files, but that would not have
been ideal either because the directory structure and all the filenames
would have been lost, leaving thousands of meaninglessly-named files to be
sorted out by hand (some of which may end up being split into more than one
file).
</p>

<p>
The directory structure was in fact still there; only the entries for the
top-level directories had been lost. The listings of their subdirectories
(including all filenames etc) were still present somewhere on the disk, but
the root directory was no longer saying where to find them. A few Google
searches seemed to suggest that the orphaned directory listings are
commonly known as "directory stubs" and I needed a program that could
search the disk for lost directory stubs and restore them. Unfortunately
such programs were not very common. The only one I found was a commercial
one called <A HREF="http://www.cnwrecovery.com/">CnW Recovery</A>, but that
requires administrator access to a Windows PC (which I do not have).
</p>

<h2>SleuthKit to the rescue</h2>

<p>
A useful utility is SleuthKit, available as a package on most distributions
(<tt>apt-get install sleuthkit</tt>) or from <A
HREF="http://www.sleuthkit.org/">sleuthkit.org</A>.  SleuthKit consists of
several commands, the most useful of which are <tt>fls</tt> and
<tt>icat</tt>. The <tt>fls</tt> command takes an image file (or device) and
an inode number, and attempts to display the directory listing that is
stored at that inode number (if there is one). This directory listing will
show files and other directories, and the inode numbers where they are
stored. The <tt>icat</tt> command also takes an image file and an inode
number, and prints out the contents of the file stored at that inode number
if there is one. Hence, if you know the inode number of the root directory,
you can chase through a normal filesystem with <tt>fls</tt> commands
(following the inode numbers of subdirectories etc) and use <tt>icat</tt>
to access the files within them.  <tt>fls</tt> also lists deleted entries
(marked with a <tt>*</tt>) as long as those entries are still present in
the FAT. (Incidentally, these tools also work on several other filesystems
besides FAT, and they make them all look the same.)
</p>

<p>
The range of valid inode numbers can be obtained using SleuthKit's
<tt>fsstat</tt> command. This tells you the root inode number (for example
2) and the maximum possible inode number (for example 60000000).
<tt>fsstat</tt> will also give quite a lot of other information, so you may
want to pipe its output through a pager such as <tt>more</tt> or
<tt>less</tt> (i.e. type <tt>fsstat|more</tt> or <tt>fsstat|less</tt>) in
order to catch the inode range near the beginning of the output.
</p>

<h2>Scanning for directory stubs</h2>

<p>
Because the root FAT had been corrupted, using <tt>fls</tt> on it did not
reveal the inode locations of the lost directories. Therefore it was
necessary to scan through all possible inode numbers in order to find them.
This is a lot of work to do manually, so I wrote a Python script to call
the necessary <tt>fls</tt> commands automatically. First it checks the root
directory and all subdirectories for the locations of "known" files and
directories, and then it scans all the other inodes to see if any of them
contain directory listings that are not already known about. If it finds a
lost directory listing, it will try to recover all the files and
subdirectories in it with their correct names, although it cannot recover
the name of the top-level directory it finds.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it finds data that just happens to pass the validity check for a
directory listing, but isn't. This results in it creating a "recovered"
directory full of junk. But often it correctly recovers a lost directory.
</p>

<pre class="code">
image = "/dev/sdb1"
recover_to = "/tmp/recovered"

import os, commands, sys

def is_valid_directory(inode):
    exitstatus,outtext = commands.getstatusoutput("fls -f fat "+image+" "+str(inode)+" 2&gt;/dev/null")
    return (not exitstatus) and outtext
def get_ls(inode): return commands.getoutput("fls -f fat "+image+" "+str(inode))

def scanFilesystem(inode, inode2path_dic, pathSoFar=""):
    if pathSoFar: print "   Scanning",pathSoFar
    for line in get_ls(inode).split('\n'):
        if not line: continue
        try: theType,theInode,theName = line.split(None,2)
        except: continue # perhaps no name (false positive inode?) - skip
        if theInode=='*': continue # deleted entry (theName starts with inode) - ignore
        assert theInode.endswith(":") ; theInode = theInode[:-1]
        if theType=="d/d": # a directory
            if theInode in inode2path_dic: continue # duplicate ??
            inode2path_dic[theInode] = pathSoFar+theName+"/"
            scanFilesystem(theInode, inode2path_dic, pathSoFar+theName+"/")
        elif theType=="r/r": inode2path_dic[theInode] = pathSoFar+theName

print "Finding the root directory"
i=0
while not is_valid_directory(i): i += 1

print "Scanning the root directory"
root_inode2path = {}
scanFilesystem(i,root_inode2path)

print "Looking for lost directory stubs"

recovered_directories = {}
while i &lt; 60000000:
    i += 1
    if i in root_inode2path or i in recovered_directories: continue # already known
    sys.stdout.write("Checking "+str(i)+"   \r") ; sys.stdout.flush()
    if not is_valid_directory(i): continue
    inode2path = root_inode2path.copy()
    scanFilesystem(i,inode2path)
    for n in inode2path.keys():
        if n in root_inode2path: continue # already known
        p = recover_to+"/lostdir-"+str(i)+"/"+inode2path[n]
        if p[-1]=="/": # a directory
            recovered_directories[n] = True
            continue 
        print "Recovering",p
        os.system('mkdir -p "'+p[:p.rindex("/")]+'"')
        os.system("icat -f fat "+image+" "+str(n)+' &gt; "'+p+'"')
</pre>

<p>
Note that the script might find a subdirectory <em>before</em> it finds its
parent directory. For example if you have a lost directory <tt>A</tt> which
has a subdirectory <tt>B</tt>, it is possible that the script will find
<tt>B</tt> first and recover it, then later when it finds <tt>A</tt> it
will recover <tt>A</tt>, re-recover <tt>B</tt>, and place the new copy of
<tt>B</tt> inside the recovered <tt>A</tt>, so you will end up with both
<tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt> and <tt>A/B</tt>.  You have to manually decide which
of the recovered directories are actually the top-level ones. The script
does not bother to check for <tt>..</tt> entries pointing to a directory's
parent, because these were not accurate on the FAT storage card I had (they
may be more useful on other filesystems). If you want you can modify the
script to first run the inode scan <em>to completion</em> without
recovering anything, then analyze them, discarding any top-level ones that
are also contained within others. However, running the scan to completion
is likely to take far longer than looking at the directories by hand.
</p>

<p>
As it is, you can interrupt the script once it has recovered what you want.
If Control-C does not work, use Control-Z to suspend it and do <tt>kill
%1</tt> or whatever number <tt>bash</tt> gave you when you suspended the
script.
</p>

<p>
This script can take several days to run through a large storage card. You
can speed it up by using <tt>dd</tt> to take an image of the card to the
hard disk (which likely has faster access times than a card reader); you
can also narrow the range of inodes that are scanned if you have some idea
of the approximate inode numbers of the lost directories (you can get such
an idea by using <tt>fls</tt> to check on directories that are still there
and that were created in about the same period of time as the lost ones).
</p>

<p>
After all the directories have been recovered, you can run <tt>fsck.vfat
-r</tt> and let it return the orphaned space back to the free space, and
then mount the card and copy the recovered directory structures back onto
it.
</p>

Some GNU/Linux live CDs have a forensic mode that doesn't touch local
storage media. For example if you boot the <a href="http://grml.org/">GRML</a>
live CD you can select "forensic mode" and can safely inspect attached harddisks
or other media. AFAIK Knoppix has a similar option. -- Ren&eacute;
