<h1>Digital Speed Controller using RTAI/Linux</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/sreejith.html">Sreejith N</A></b></p>

<p>

<p>
Speed control of an Industrial motor may sound complicated, but it's not as
complex an affair as it sounds. What's interesting is that a PC powered
with a Linux based RTOS can be used to control anything from a small motor
to a complex industrial drive with the utmost reliability.  This article
presents the implementation of a Digital PI (Proportional+Integral)
Controller on a PC running RTAI (Real Time Application Interface).
</p>
 
<h3>Control Systems</h3>
<p>
Control Systems can be broadly divided into two categories: open loop
systems and closed loop systems. Systems which do not automatically correct
the variations in their output are open loop systems. This means that the
output is not fed back to the input for correction. For instance, consider a
traffic control system where the traffic signals are operated on a time
basis. The system will not measure the density of the traffic before giving
the signals, thereby making it an open loop system.</p>

<p>Consider now a temperature control system, say an air conditioner. Output 
of this system is the desired room temperature. Obviously this 
depends on the time for which the supply to heater/cooler remains ON.
Depending on the actual temperature sensed by sensors and the desired 
temperature, corrective measures are taken by the controller. Thus 
the system automatically corrects any changes in output by monitoring 
the input, hence making it a closed loop system.</p>

<p>An open loop system can be modified into a closed loop system by providing
feedback. The provision for feedback automatically corrects the changes 
in the output due to disturbances. Hence, the closed loop system is also called
an automatic control system. The general block diagram of an automatic 
control system is shown below.</p>

<h3>Automatic controller</h3>
<p>A controller is a device introduced into the system to sense the error 
signal and to produce the required control signal. An automatic controller compares 
the actual value of the plant output with the desired value, determines 
the deviation, and produces a control signal which will reduce the 
deviation to zero or to a smaller value. According to the manner in which 
the controller produces the control signal (called control action) 
controllers are classified as proportional(P), integral(I), derivative(D) 
and their combinations( PI, PD and PID).</p>

<p>
The proportional controller is a device that produces a control signal
<em>u(t)</em>, which is proportional to the input error signal, <em>e(t)</em> (error signal,
the difference between actual value and desired value), i.e.:
<pre>
u(t) = Kp * e(t)
</pre>
where 
<em>Kp</em> = proportional gain or constant; a proportional controller amplifies 
the error signal by an amount <em>Kp</em>. 
The drawback of the P-controller is that it leads to a constant steady 
state error. Integral control is used to reduce the steady state error 
to zero. This device produces a control signal <em>u(t)</em> which is proportional 
to the integral of the input error signal:

<pre>
u(t) = Ki * integral { e(t)*dt }
</pre>

where <em>Ki</em> = integral gain or constant.
Integral control means considering the sum of all errors
over an interval, so this always gives us a measure of variation  
over a constant interval. The other choice is derivative control where the 
control signal <em>(u(t))</em> is proportional to the derivative of the input error 
signal <em>(e(t))</em>. We consider the derivative of <em>e(t)</em> at a given instant as 
the difference between present and previous errors. A large positive 
derivative value indicates a rapid change in output variable (here, the 
speed of the motor). In other words, the rate of change of speed is greater. 
The drawback of the integral controller is that it may lead to oscillatory 
response. For these reasons combination of P, I and D are used. Most 
(75-90%) of controllers in current use are  PID. In this article,
we shall look at the design of a PI controller.
</p>

<p>
The PI controller looks at:
<ol>
<li> The current value of the error,
<li> The integral of the error over a recent time interval.
</ol>

<p>This not only determines how much correction to apply, but for how long. 
Each of the above two quantities are multiplied by a `tuning constant'( <em>Kp</em> and 
<em>Ki</em> respectively) and added together. Depending on the application, one may want a 
faster convergence speed or a lower overshoot. By adjusting the weighting 
constants, <em>Kp</em> and <em>Ki</em>, the PI can be set to give the most desired performance. The 
implementation of software PI controller is discussed later in this article.

<p>Today, digital controllers are being used in many large and small-scale 
control systems, replacing analog controllers. It is now common 
practice to implement PI controllers in its digital avatar, which means 
the controller algorithm is implemented in software rather than in 
hardware. The trend toward digital control is mainly due to the 
availability of low-cost digital computers. Moreover, as the complexity 
of a control system increases, demands for flexibility, adaptability 
and optimality increases. Digital computers used as compensators
are a better option in such cases. A general purpose computer, if used,
lends itself to time-shared use of other control functions in the 
plant.</p>

<h3>Why real time</h3>
<p>Using general purpose computers puts us at a disadvantage, if the operating 
system (OS) employs various tasks to be 
executed on a time shared basis. An example of such an OS is the standard
version of GNU/Linux,
where the time constraints required by the control system are not met.
</p>

<p>The systems that ensure timing requirements are termed Real-Time (RT)
systems. An appropriate OS should be used to satisfy time constraints.</p>

<h3>Real-Time Systems</h3>
<p>A real time system can be defined as a "system capable of guaranteeing 
timing requirements of the processes under its control". It must be fast 
and predictable. Fast means that it has a low latency, ie it responds 
to external, asynchronous events in a short time. The lower the latency, 
the better the system will respond to events which require immediate 
attention. Predictable means that it is able to determine a task's 
completion time with certainty. It is desirable that time-critical 
and non time-critical activities coexist in a real time system. Both 
are called tasks and a task with a hard timing requirement is called 
a real time task. 
 
<h3>What is RTAI?</h3>
<p>RTAI stands for Real Time Application Interface. Strictly speaking, it is 
not a real time operating system, such as VXworks or QNX. It is based on 
the Linux kernel, providing it with the ability to make itself fully 
pre-emptable. RTAI offers the  services of the Linux kernel core, 
adding the features of an industrial real time operating system. It lets you 
write applications with strict timing constraints for your favourite 
operating system. Like Linux itself, this software is a community effort.

<h3>PC parallel port as analog I/O interface</h3>
<p>The PI Controller described in this article uses the PC parallel port 
as an analog I/O interface. Just two bits are used as analog interfaces 
through a technique called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). This technique 
allows an analog interface to be built without the use of A/D or D/A 
converters, and analog voltages and currents can be used to control 
processes directly. As intuitive and simple as analog control may seem, 
it is not always economically attractive or practical. Analog circuits 
tend to drift over time and can, therefore, be very difficult to tune. 
By controlling analog circuits digitally, system costs and power 
consumption can be drastically reduced. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) 
is a powerful technique for controlling analog circuits with digital 
signals. PWM is a way of digitally encoding analog signal levels. 
The duty cycle of a square wave is modulated to encode a specific 
analog signal level, as shown in this figure:</p>  
                                            			
<p><IMG alt=[PWMwave]
src="misc/sreejith/pwm1.png"
> </p>

<p>The PWM signal is still digital because, at any instant, it is either 
on or off. The relation between the on time and the off time varies 
according to the analog level to be represented. Given a sufficient 
bandwidth, any analog value may be encoded with PWM.</p>                                        		
<p><img alt=[PWMGenerationWaveForm]
src="misc/sreejith/pwm.png"
> </p>

<p>In this work, PWM technique is used to generate the gating signals for 
the chopper circuit. The speed of a DC motor can be controlled by varying 
its input voltage. A DC chopper circuit can do this job.</p>

<h3>DC Chopper</h3>
<img src="misc/sreejith/chopper_ckt.png">
<p>A chopper is a static device that converts a fixed DC input voltage 
to a variable DC output voltage. A chopper may be thought of as 
a DC equivalent of an AC transformer since they behave in an identical 
manner. Chopper systems offer smooth control, high efficiency, and fast 
response.</p>

<p>Power semi-conductor devices used for a chopper circuit can be 
power BJT and/or power MOSFET. Like a transformer, a chopper can be used to 
step up or step down the fixed DC input voltage. Here, for motor speed 
control, a step-down chopper circuit with a power MOSFET is used. It is 
basically a high speed semiconductor switch. It connects source to load 
and disconnects the load from source at a high speed according to the 
gating signal. The average load voltage is given by</p> 

<p><img alt=[Chopperequation]
src="misc/sreejith/choppereqn.png"
> </p>

<p>where <em>Vs</em> is the source voltage, <em>Ton</em> is the on-time,
<em>Toff</em> is the off-time, T (the sum of <em>Ton</em> and
<em>Toff</em>) is the chopping period, and <em>Ton/T</em> is the duty
cycle.</p>

<h3>Preparing The Parallel Port</h3>

<p>Although the parallel interface is simple, it can trigger interrupts. 
This capability is used by the printer to notify the lp driver that 
it is ready to accept the next character in the buffer. 
A simple <strong>outb()</strong> call to a control register 
makes the port ready to generate interrupts; the parallel interface 
generates an interrupt whenever the electrical signal at pin 10 (the 
so-called ACK bit) changes from low to high. The simplest way to force 
the interface to generate interrupts is to connect pins 9 and 
10 of the parallel connector. A short length of wire inserted 
into the appropriate holes in the parallel port connector 
on the back of the system will create this connection. Pin 9 is 
the most significant bit of the parallel data byte. 

<h3>Real time speed controller</h3>

<p>The figure below represents the 
closed loop speed control of a 6V DC motor controlled by a chopper 
circuit. The duty cycle of the chopper is controlled using gating 
signals (PWM) from the PC parallel port. The PC is running the speed 
sensing (shaft encoder) module to read the current speed measured by 
the encoder. This device works by generating a square wave pulse produced 
when a perforated disc (keyed onto the shaft of the motor) cuts an IR beam. 
This square wave pulse train is fed back to the 10th pin of the parallel 
port. The controller program is running as a hard real time user program.
</p>

<p><IMG alt=[RealTimeSpeedController]

></p>

<p>The well-implemented PI controllers are usually hard real time 
systems. I have implemented a Digital PI Controller in a standard 
PC running Linux/RTAI (Linux-2.4.24 kernel 
patched with the RTAI-3.1). The I/O was done by PWM through two pins 
of the parallel port: one for input and the other for output, dispensing 
with the need for an A/D converter which is the most expensive component 
in a data-acquisition system. The PWM coding/decoding is handled
by software routines implemented in Linux threads with LXRT RTAI hard 
real time constraints. The main routine, which is responsible for the 
actual PI calculation has also been implemented in a thread with hard 
real time constraints. The communication between threads was made through 
global variables. The controller program produces the necessary actuating 
signal (in terms of a PWM pulse), which in turn depends on an error 
signal produced by the difference of the set speed (a constant in the 
program) and the present speed. The chopper varies the average DC output 
voltage, used to control the speed of the DC motor. The motor used here 
is a small 6/12 V motor commonly found in most tape recorders. The 
following sections present the speed sensing (shaft encoder) module 
and the controller program followed by a brief description of the same.
</p>

<h3>Speed sensing (shaft encoder) module</h3>
<p>Once interrupts are enabled, the parallel port generates an interrupt 
whenever there is low to high transition at pin 10 (ACK bit). This module 
includes the operations that should be performed when the interrupt occurs. 
The <em>'init_module'</em> function registers a handler for interrupt 
number 7 (IRQ number). In the first execution of function 
<em>'lpt_irq_handler (void)'</em> the count is zero; the control 
enters the if statementi, and the 64-bit time stamp counter (tsc) value is obtained 
by rdtsc macro function defined in 'msr.h'. By getting two tsc values at 
consecutive interrupts, the number of CPU clock cycles in between these 
interrupts can be calculated and hence the frequency. Frequency thus 
measured is communicated with a userspace program via a FIFO. Thus the 
userspace program can calculate the real-time speed. Here is the <a href="misc/sreejith/1.c.txt">code</a>
which implements this idea:</p>

<p>The rt_request_global_irq and rt_enable_irq functions together instruct
the RTAI kernel to service IRQ 7 (which is the parallel port interrupt).
After compiling this module, insert it into the kernel address space using
the "insmod" or the "modprobe" command, and check "/proc/modules" to ensure
that it loaded successfully.</p>


<h3>Controller program</h3>
<p>
The controller program is responsible for three things:
<ol>
<li> Reading the current cpu_clock_count from the speed sensing module,
     ie from the FIFO, which is stored in an array for future reference;
<li> The PI task, and,
<li> Encoding the PI digital output, which is stored in a variable, 
     into an external PWM wave signal which is the gating signal for 
     chopper circuit.
</ol>

<p>The algorithm used for implementing the PI controller can be summarized as 
follows:
<ol>
<li>      Create a periodic task with period <em>Tc</em> 
<li>      Read the state of the parallel input pins
<li>      Compute the control signal and update PWM signal
<li>      Update the output-write thread
<li>      Wait for the next task period <em>Tc</em>.
</ol>

<p>The main function creates five hard real-time threads which are shown in 
listings 1-4. An LXRT task starts out as an ordinary POSIX thread. It gets 
transformed to a hard, real-time thread by calling a function available as 
part of the LXRT library. The effect of this transition is that the thread 
is no longer managed by the normal Linux Scheduler - it comes under the 
supervision of the RTAI Scheduler, which guarantees that its timings do not 
get disturbed by activities taking place within the Linux kernel or in other 
user-space threads. The main() thread runs as a low priority task.</p>

<h3>The PI task</h3>
<p>The PI task is the core of the application, where the controller 
calculation is actually made. The PI controller receives as input the 
error, given by <em>e(t) = r(t) - y(t)</em> and computes the control variable <em>c(t)</em> 
which is its output. The control signal <em>c(t)</em> is calculated from the 
discrete PI equation given below:</p>

<p><IMG alt=[piequation]
src="misc/sreejith/pieqn.png"
> </p>

The PI thread looks at

<ol>
<li> The current value of the error;
<li> The integral of the error over a recent time interval;
<li> Compute control signal and update PWM signal;
<li> Update output-write thread
</ol>

<p>This thread has been assigned the fifth highest priority among the 
five hard real time tasks.

<h3>Task `rt_task_out_put'</h3>

<p><a href="misc/sreejith/5.c.txt">Listing 2</a> shows a hard Real-time LXRT program 
generating a PWM running at a frequency of 50Hz on a parallel port pin to feed the motor 
drive (DC chopper). The PWM is generated by comparing the instantaneous values 
of a sine wave and a triangular wave of required frequency. The instantaneous 
values of the sine wave and the triangular wave are generated in the threads 
given in Listing 3. These instantaneous values are compared in the thread 
rt_task_out_put to generate the PWM. This thread has been assigned the third
highest priority.

<a href="misc/sreejith/6.c.txt">Listing 3</a>, below, shows the code 
for generation of sinusoidal and triangular function values used in the

<h3>Task `rt_task_in_put'</h3>

<p>
This task continuously reads values from the FIFO (note that the
shaft encoder writes real-time speed to the FIFO) and stores it in the
`cpu_clock_count' variable. The value of cpu_clock_count is 
converted to speed in RPM and is stored  in `rt_speed'. This 
thread has been assigned the second highest priority. The code for this
process is shown in <a href="misc/sreejith/7.c.txt">Listing 4</a>:

<pre>
/*The Feed back Task*/
void* rt_task_in_put (void *arg)
{
	RT_TASK *task;
        task = rt_task_init(nam2num("rtl3"), 3, 4096, 0);
        iopl(3);
        rt_task_make_periodic(task, now + tick_period, tick_period);
        rt_make_hard_real_time();
        while(!stop) {
                rt_speed=CPU_CLOCK*60/(float)cpu_clock_count;
               	rtf_get(FIFO, &amp;cpu_clock_count, sizeof(cpu_clock_count));
                rt_task_wait_period(); /*Tc =5ms*/
       	}
        rt_make_soft_real_time();
        rt_task_delete(task);
}
</pre>
<p>
The real-time speed of the motor can be displayed either by running 
the code below as a thread, or by running main() as a GUI application by 
using FLTK/GTK.

<pre>
/*Print Real Time Speed*/
void* task_show_report(void *arg)
{
        while(!stop) {
		printf("%d\n",rt_speed);
       	}
}
</pre>

The complete controller code can be seen
<a href="misc/sreejith/2.c.txt">here</a>.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The above experiment illustrates the use of a PI controller 
for closed loop speed control of a small DC motor. The performance of this
PI controller was found to be acceptable for such a motor. However, in
attempting to model a converter along similar lines for a real large-scale
industrial drive, I found that the large number of control parameters
required a more in-depth and detailed controller design using the concepts
of Control System theory.
