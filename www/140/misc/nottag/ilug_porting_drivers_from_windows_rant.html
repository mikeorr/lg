Subject: [ILUG] Porting drivers from Windows (rant)
</pre>

<p>
Hi all,
    I'm currently writing Linux support for a piece of custom hardware -
I have Windows source code for hardware drivers and data conversion
algorithms, and I'm porting/re-writing that to Linux and I am beyond
unhappy at some of the intrinsically stupid things I am seeing.
</p>

<p>
Today's little bundle of joy regards writing to device registers.  It's
not actually so complicated - the I/O regions are set up automagically
during boot, your driver basically just has to tell the kernel (a) that
it now owns the appropriate region, and (b) how it wants the region to
be made visible to it.  Then you go and poke the registers that live
there, and the hardware goes and does what you said to.  Drive carefully.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the Windows driver, there is a little snippet of code like the
following.  It's part of the wake-up sequence for the hardware:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    #define CTR_REG 0x4000
    ...
    WRITE_REGISTER_ULONG(CTR_REG,0);
</pre>

<p>
How obvious - it writes the value 0 to a 32-bit register located at
0x4000.  This is kindergarten stuff.  If you don't believe me, read
this page:
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/Kernel_r/hh/Kernel_r/k103_af58a3ec-4102-4a89-9c58-e56f99d793d0.xml.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/...</a>
</p>

<p>
which says (the very first line):
    The WRITE_REGISTER_ULONG macro writes a ULONG value to the specified
address.
</p>

<p>
So, yea, we nod wisely, and write the equivalent under Linux, which
happens to be
</p>

<pre class="code">
    iowrite32(0,CTR_REG);
</pre>

<p>
And yea, we would make many attempts to get a response.  We would poke
and prod.  We would reboot into Windows and check that the hardware
still worked.  Was the hardware sulking because we missed some
vanishingly obscure initialisation step?  We would examine our
documentation again and again - was it possible?  We would try and trick
the damn thing.  We would sacrifice goats.  Nada.  Not a whisper of
response.
</p>

<p>
Because, of course, the register isn't at 0x4000 at all.
</p>

<p>
It is (where else?) at 0x10000 (i.e. 0x4000 * 4).
</p>

<p>
Think about it...... and let the nausea sink in.
</p>

<p>
For those it hasn't hit yet, some <strong>genius</strong> in Redmond decided that, when
talking about 32-bit quantities, they were going to count 32-bits at a
time, like C array notation.  ("Hey Bill! I know this really cool way
of implementing WRITE_REGISTER_ULONG!").  Of course, they're still
going to call them "addresses".
</p>

<p>
Of course, this means:<br/>
    - the value 0x4000 is now mercifully free of the ravages of
<strong>MEANING</strong>.  It's useless now, unless the programmer separately knows
that it refers to a 32-bit quantity.<br/>
    - what a pointer refers to can't be changed without a conversion
function.<br/>
    - they've created a new class of bugs that the compiler can't catch.<br/>
    - rather than being opaque or confusing, the code now <strong>deceives</strong>
anybody who isn't from their part of town (for 2 days of zero progress,
in my case)<br/>
    - But hey! It'll be dead easy to implement!
</p>

<p>
I don't know whether this crock of stupidity is the worst I'm going to
see, but for oh-so-carefully using the word "address" in the
documentation, they get maximum fscking points for style.
</p>

<p>
