So, it's basically DRM-corrupted binary-only proprietary software that
may be altered <em>on your system</em> at the whim of its copyright holder,
which you receive under an agreement that the copyright holder may
<em>also</em> alter on a whim, software that you are forbidden to try to
understand or modify.</p>
<p>If you object to any harm it causes to you or your system, you're 
required to foreswear any legal recourse.  If you insist on trying to 
pursue recourse anyway, you're required to do so in a foreign court. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2" name="id2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Thank you, Google, Inc., for reminding us of what open-source coders
worked so hard to get away from.  ;-&gt;</p>

Further to Rick's comments, good luck UN-INSTALLING this hideous piece
of crap, and it truly IS crap ... the uninstall script is very broken,
and there is no way to help them fix it.

So ...
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/google-earth

Well done google.

Also note that <a class="reference" href="http://maps.google.com/">http://maps.google.com/</a> viewed in a graphical browser
like firefox, followed by a switch to satellite mode is not a bad
alternative to Google Earth.</p>
<p>In particular, it uses the same images.</p>
<p>The main difference is the lack of the GL interface.</p>
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
A good point.  I had a good time touring around my home town (Victoria,
Hong Kong Island) via Google Maps's satellite view.</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
For those who may be interested here is a satellite image of where I
live (maps.google.com url shortened using tinyurl.com). It's the third
house from the top in the row of houses in the centre of the picture.</p>

<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
Ah, Chennai, Tamil Nadu.  &lt;sigh&gt;  For now, all I can do is look from the
air, and visit Andhra-style restaurants for lunch.</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
Andhra-style in Chennai is often an excuse for red-chilli overdose.
However, there <em>are</em> also many good Andhra and Chettinadu style places
here. Other semi-local/local styles include Kerala (including but not
limited to Appams with Chicken Stew) and specifically Moplah (they
have their own version of biriyani--according to some people the
Moplahs invented biriyani).</p>

(Giving this information may consitute a security risk but I hope that
either my enemies do not have access to GPS guided missiles or if one
of them reads LG, then they are so intrigued by the articles that they
forget to bomb me. :-))</p>
<p><strong>[Rick]</strong>
Well, just to be thoughtful, I've furnished ICBM coordinates on
<a class="reference" href="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/">http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/</a> for anyone who cares enough to send the
very best.  (The elevation figure is just my guesstimate, so please send
corrections if any of you are moved to send ranging shots.)</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
Not knowing enough about this I didn't think of elevation as part of
the co-ordinates at all---still thinking of 2-d instead of 3-d! Proves
that I have much to learn about projectiles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[Jimmy]</em> On the subject of maps...</p>
<p>A few months ago, I was telling Beata about something I'd read in a
book called &quot;Why Men Don't Listen and Why Women Can't Read Maps&quot;.
She immediately pounced on the title: &quot;When I came to Ireland, my
friend drove, and I navigated. Am I in Ireland or not?&quot;</p>
<p>Much discussion about the title ensued (including her challenging me
to draw a map... hers was better, but mine took into account that
the street we were drawing is curved, not straight), until I managed
to explain that the title referred to the fact(?) that men are
generally better able to visualise maps, and can read maps without
needing to turn them.</p>
<p>A while later, I felt honour bound to tell her when two friends, 
Mariusz and Tomasz, while driving to Tomasz's job site, managed to
follow correct directions, using the wrong map...</p>
<p>Of course, it was a little worse than that... I knew Tomasz is a 
land surveyor, but didn't really think about what that entails,
until I heard him describe what he does in Polish: &quot;Robi&#x0119; mapy&quot; -- 
&quot;I make maps&quot; :)</p>
<p>(Yes, I told her that too :)</p>
<p>We've all had fun with Tomasz's equipment: he uses a two-piece,
extremely accurate GPS system (accurate to 5cm) that's been used
to map open WAPs; laser measuring devices that we've used to check
if the hoop at our regular basketball court is the correct height
(it isn't), and that Beata used to measure her height; and a company
van in which I received my first driving lessons -- which are 
automatically more fun when the &quot;instructor&quot; has to spend the first
five minutes making sure of the English names of the pedals :)</p>
