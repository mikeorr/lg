<P> <HR> <P> 
<!--======================================================================-->

<P> Look ma, I got a greetings column just like Heather now!

<P> Only two changes to LG's format this month:
<OL>
<LI> The author bios are the bottom of the articles again.  Raj Shekhar
requested this, so he can print the articles and read them off-line while 
still seeing the bios.  As always, the lastest bio and contact info is on
the author's Author page.
<LI> The yellow articles table on the Front Page and Site Map is smaller now
(when viewed in a graphical browser).  Now, if I could just make it smaller
vertically....
</OL>

<P> SSC was closed Christmas week so I had a wonderful five days off.  I finished
a long-awaited project, updating the 
<A HREF="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/learn.html">Cheetah Users' Guide</A>.

<P> Then I started putting together a computer for my mom.  Right now she's got
Windows 95 on a 486.  I gave her the 
<A HREF="http://store.linuxjournal.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=LJS&Product_Code=litw&Category_Code=B">Linux in the Workplace</A> book a month ago so that
the transition to Linux won't be a total shock.  The book goes over the KDE 
user interface step by step with lots of screenshots.  Then I had her open her
Word documents on my computer so she could verify they opened properly and that
the user interface was OK, before I commandeer her monitor and keyboard for the
new computer.  I had her try out AbiWord, KWord (part of the KOffice suite) and
OpenOffice Writer.  Both AbiWord and OpenOffice opened all the documents, but
OpenOffice handled her headers/footers and tabs the best and had a slightly better
user interface.  KWord failed to open two of the documents, which had a .doc
extension but were really RTF (Rich Text Format).  She doesn't know how they
got that way.  So I used "Save As..." in OpenOffice to convert them back to Word
format.

<P> Rather than installing Debian from scratch and remembering all my 
customizations, I decided to clone my existing partitions and delete what she
won't use.  That went well enough, although again I had to use "linear" in
/etc/lilo.conf instead of "lba32".  That's the third drive it's happened with,
which confirms that it's my BIOS' fault, not the drives'.  We'll see what the
new motherboard does when I connect it up.

<P> I did have trouble making a boot floppy.  First, I couldn't find my Debian
rescue disk.  Then I found a disk that booted my current system.  It contained
just a kernel, no LILO.  I could use <CODE>rdev</CODE> to change the root
device, but I didn't want to sabotage my only boot floppy, so I tried to make
another boot floppy.  But every time I copied the kernel to a disk and booted
from it, it would hang after the "Uncompressing Linux..." message, saying something
like, "unexpected end of compressed data: system halted".  One disk gave an I/O
error so I threw it out, but it wouldn't work on two other disks either.  I tried
both <CODE>cp</CODE>'ing and <CODE>dd</CODE>'ing the kernel, but neither way
worked.  Then I realized I could set up LILO for my new system from my old
system, so I did that instead.  The first time I got the "L 99 99 99" error, but
the second time it worked.

<P> Friday my DSL went down, and I spent four days calling Qwest and The River
(my ISP) to do something about it.  Actually, it's not "down" but there's 99%
packet loss, which is essentially the same thing.  It would come up every
several hours just long enough for a bit of e-mail to slip in and out, and then
go down again.  The ISP and Qwest wouldn't support Linux so I had to plug in my
roommate's Windows XP box so they could troubleshoot it.  We checked the IP
configuration multiple times and reconfigured the DSL modem (which involves
plugging in a serial "management cable" and running
Minicom/Kermit/HyperTerminal and typing commands to a router OS).  I kept
asking, "Can you see the ping packets going back and forth?  Can you see the
ATM packets?"  They could (sometimes), but I wasn't getting replies.  I decided
to call them both once a day until somebody took responsibility for it, or I
cancelled the service, whichever came first.  Finally on Monday, Qwest admitted
they were having severe hardware problems in the DSLAM (that's the DSL
connector in the central office), and that it had been going up and down for a
week.  Contradicting what the woman had told me Sunday, that there had been a
DSLAM problem but they had fixed in at 10pm Saturday.  It's doing a lot better
today (Tuesday), but it's still not fixed.

<P> Just for fun, here's a 
<A HREF="misc/backpage/mad_mike_nolegos.png">picture of me</A> that LJ made for the
<A HREF="misc/backpage/lj-cover104.png">December cover</A>, then decided not to
use.  Here's how they
<A HREF="misc/backpage/mad_mike.png">would have gone together</A>.  (I can already
see Ben Okopnik saying, "I knew it.  I just knew it.  You can't trust that Mike
any farther than you can throw him....")  It was Don Marti's
idea, but then the Marketing department decided they couldn't have a picture of
somebody smashing people with a hammer on the cover, even if they are lego
people....

My only guess is that you're using Linux (good man!)
and that you've neglected to realise that you
currently have the BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death)
screensaver running. 

I know it is confusing, especially as you've probably
only just made the crossover from Windows to Linux,
but bear with us, the BSOD screensaver is only a
joke!! You poor thing -- you don't have to be haunted
anymore. YOU'RE FREE!!

my question is<BR>
1. The beginning of gangs?<BR>
2.their reason for joining a gang in those years?<BR>
3. In what state/country did gang first began?<BR>
please write as much as you can about this is for a report.
</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Iron:</H4>
(1) What is a gang?  Is a group of close friends a gang?  If not, what would they
have to do to be a gang?  Get a name?  A clubhouse?  A secret handshake?
Choose a bandana color?  Look menacing?  Sell drugs and shoot people?

<P> (2) I bet you can already answer this.  If not, you can ask some gang members, or
see any of the hundreds of studies and documentaries that focus on this
question.  Or take any pop movie (Colors, West Side Story, American History X,
8 Mile, A Clockwork Orange, Quadrophenia, etc) and ask, why did those people
join gangs?  What benefits do they get by being in them?  What is their family
life like?  Is there something missing in their family life?  Is there any
connection between the two?

<P> Quadrophenia has a lot to say about this.  Why is Jimmy a mod?  Why is he so
excited about the demonstration in Brighton?  Why is he so devastated when he
goes to Brighton again and it's empty?  How does his mom treat him?  How does
his dad treat him?  When he tries to convince his girlfriend not to dump him,
what are their differing views about the Brighton rumble?  

<P> (3) depends on how you answer (1).

I am Madam Brenda Williams wife/widow to late Gen Patrick Williams
an Army Officer, im also a mother of 3 lovely boys, Patrick
(12yrs), Kevin (8yrs), Dotun which is a traditional name, he his 5
yrs, and im also the last wife out of 3, married to my late husband.

<P> Before my husband died he willed all his landed property to his elder
wives and children, all the elder wives and their children enjoyed
what is left of our husbands wealth, leaving me the last wife with
nothing, well we did not get along well when he was alive but he
loved the kids i had for him.

<P> Things are not going too well, after 1yr of his death, i mean raising
the kids, sending them to school, clothing them even shelter and
feeding, my parents are already dead, just me in this miserable world
and i have just 2 months to evacuate the house im staying now, all
the other wives dont allow me in their houses including the house i
used to live with my husband before he died or even render any kind
of help, but i really loved my husband.

<P> Why i have contacted you is because my late husband left some money
for his children (7 million US Dollars) deposited in a Security
Company(www.XXXXX.net) abroad, which was revealed to me by
the family lawyer just 6 months ago, which he claimed to be the time
stated on the will by my late husband to avoid clashes between myself
and the other wives.

<P> But this money can only be claimed when each child is up to 21yrs in
age, not even myself can extract from this fund according to the
will. The other option is if i can provide someone(FORIEGNER) who
will stand as a caretaker for my kids and my self, and help invest
this money with profit in future.
