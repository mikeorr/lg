<p><strong>From Mark Thomas Mercado on Tue, 30 Jun 1998 in the
	<a href="news:comp.unix.questions">comp.unix.questions</a>
	newsgroup
<br><br>

I've looked around on the web, and couldn't find any documentation
on setting up X with two monitors (myhost:0 and myhost:1)... I would
love to RTFM if anyone could point me in the right direction...
<br><br>

Thanks,
<br>Mark.

	This would usually be called "multi-headed" mode and
	the different screens would be addressed as "<tt>myhost:0.0</tt>"
	and "<tt>myhost:0.1</tt>" -- "<tt>myhost:1.0</tt>" and 
	"<tt>myhost:1.1</tt>" (etc) would refer to a different server or 
	instance running on the same machine.
<br><br>

	I don't know what this means on other forms of Unix
	--- but I think you'd usually see it on a system that
	was hosting multiple X Terminals via XDMCP.  On my Linux
	boxes I usually see it as an extra instance of the X server
	running on a different virtual console (so my wife and
	I can each have a running copy on any of the systems 
	around the house without having to disturb the other's).
<br><br>

	In our case we run <tt>startx -- :1</tt> to start the 2nd instance
	of our X server.  We can then switch between them with 
	the [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Fx] sequence (or the [Alt]+[Fx] sequence
	to get to either of them from any of our text mode virtual 
	consoles.  (If you don't use a PC Unix that supports 
	VC's this probably won't make any sense -- don't worry 
	about it).
<br><br>

	Getting back to multi-headed support:
<br><br>

	This depends on your X server. Last I heard XFree86 servers
	(the suite of X servers that's most commonly used with Linux
	<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> (PC) etc) don't 
	currently support multi-headed operation.
<br><br>

	I know that some of the commercial X servers for Linux
	(and presumably FreeBSD, etc) support it.  Unfortunately
	I've never used a PC or Mac Unix that was configured 
	this way.  So, I don't know how it works.  I've used an
	old Sun system set up this was --- but I didn't configure
	it or even look at it very closely --- it was just used
	for some compatability at a place where I was working,
	so I barely touched it.
<br><br>

	I've used Macs that were multi-headed.  That was a piece
	of cake to configure.  I also noticed that Win '98 has
	this feature available --- so it might become much more 
	common in the next year or so.
<br><br>

	Anyway, check out the XFree86 FAQ at 
	<A HREF="http://www.xfree86.org/">http://www.xfree86.org/</A>
	for more pointers.
