<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Novell and Microsoft sign agreement... and then agree to disagree</h3>

<p>The biggest news this month is undoubtedly the Microsoft-Novell deal
that sees the two companies improve compatibility in key areas, as well as
containing a "do-not-sue" clause. The key points of the agreement are
improving interoperability between Windows and SUSE Enterprise Linux Server
(SLES) on virtualization, Microsoft's Active Directory and Novell's
eDirectory, and Microsoft Office and OpenOffice XML formats on the
desktop.</p>

<p>Besides this, Microsoft  will also promote SLES where customers pick
Windows over Linux or decide to run Linux alongside Windows. While the idea
of Microsoft promoting anything Linux related may come as a shock to many,
no one will be more concerned than Red Hat. After already facing Oracle's
assault on their service business, Red Hat must now face the galling fact
of the largest proprietary software company in the world promoting a rival
Distribution. Microsoft announced that their sales staff will distribute
70,000 coupons for SLES.</p>

<p>Microsoft has also undertaken not to prosecute developers and users of
SLES over possible infringements of its intellectual property (IP) in SLES.
A special Microsoft covenant will cover non-commercial developers and those
contributing code to SLES. However, it is to be noted that this covenant
does not cover Novell itself! This slightly bizarre situation is explained
by the fact that doing so would mean that Novell would violate the GNU
Public License.</p>

<p>The financial details of the deal were quickly disclosed, and the upshot
is that Microsoft is paying Novell close to $400 million. Microsoft is to
pay Novell $240m for 350,000 subscription coupons of SLES, to be released
in annual batches of 70,000. Another $94 million will be spent on sales and
marketing through the five years of the deal. A patent co-operation
agreement will see Microsoft paying another $108 million, while Novell pays
Microsoft a minimum of $40 million.</p>

<p>The reaction from the Free Software community was prompt, and furious,
with Bruce Perens calling Novell the new SCO. Across the board criticism
led to Novell putting up a <a
href="http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/faq_opensource.html">FAQ</a>
that tries to answer some of the most important issues. Not all are
convinced, however. The Samba team criticized the deal, saying that "the
agreement struck between Novell and Microsoft is a divisive agreement. It
deals with users and creators of free software differently depending on
their "commercial" versus "non-commercial" status, and deals with them
differently depending on whether they obtained their free software directly
from Novell or from someone else."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer further raised the
hackles of the Free Software community by claiming that every Linux
customer had an "undisclosed balance sheet liability", because Linux uses
Microsoft's Intellectual Property. He also implied that the
Novell-Microsoft deal happened because of this. Novell was quick to <a
href="http://www.novell.com/linux/microsoft/community_open_letter.html">refute
this</a>, stating that they did not at any point admit to any infringement
of Microsoft IP. Microsoft then released a <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/nov06/11-20Statement.mspx">statement</a>,
the gist of which is that while they agree that Novell did not admit to any
patent problems, Microsoft still believes that there may be issues... and so
the matter rests for the moment.</p>

<p>Legal issues on the horizon may force a rethink of the deal, with the
Free Software Foundation offering hints of its strategy to fight the deal
in an <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/20/eben_moglen_on_microsoft_novell/">interview
with The Register.</a></p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Oracle Announces Support for Red Hat Customers</h3>

<p>Oracle CEO Larry Ellison shook up the Enterprise Linux space by
announcing three-tiered support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 3 and
4 starting at $99 per system per year. It's not necessary for Red Hat
customers to be running Oracle products.</p>

<p>Ellison claimed Oracle would undercut Red Hat by up to 60 per cent.
Oracle middleware and application users on Red Hat who switched within 90
days of the news get Oracle's support for an additional 50 per cent
off.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Oracle Openworld conference, he also confirmed that
Oracle would deliver a complete open source stack, comprising the entire
gamut from operating systems to applications. He denied Oracle would fork
Linux, as it will return bug fixes to the community and make fixes
available to Red Hat. "Each time Red Hat comes out with new code we'll
synchronize with that version. We will add our bug fixes to current, future
and back releases. Your application will run unchanged. We are going to
stay synchronized with the Red Hat version. We are not trying to fragment
the Linux market."</p>

<p>Red Hat shares took a tumble the next day, dropping 25% as investors
reacted to the news. Red Hat reacted by refusing to change it's pricing
strategy, and criticizing Oracle's move. Red Hat CEO Matt Szulik stated
that Oracle's changes would result in a different code base than Red Hat
Enterprise Linux. Red Hat also claimed that the changes made by Oracle
might result in "material differences in the code that will result in
application failures." </p>

<p>The long term effects of this move still remain to be seen.</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Fedora Core 6 "Zod" Released</h3>

<p>"Zod", also known as Fedora Core 6, was released late last month. Zod is
packed with shiny new features, including the Compiz window manager running
on the AIGLX framework. Zod also features GNOME 2.16 and KDE 3.5.4, a brand
new "DNA" theme, and much better printing support. Users with
multi-core/processor systems will be pleased to know that the new unified
kernel 2.6.18 autodetects the number of processors, and automagically
enables the corresponding bits. The days of separate kernels are finally
over.</p>

<p>Zod has also added a GUI tool for managing Xen virtual machines, a
revamped Anaconda that allows the user to select third-party repositories
at the time of installation, and a graphical troubleshooting tool for
SELinux. Other changes are the removal of Helix Player in favor of GNOME's
Totem, inclusion of Dogtail, ext3 file-system performance improvements, and
DT_GNU_HASH performance improvements with Fedora Core applications.
Additional packages comprising Fedora Core 6 are the Linux 2.6.18 kernel
and X.Org 7.1. Pirut and Pup also have minor updates to the interface since
their premiere with Bordeaux.</p> 

<p>Reviews for Zod have been largely positive. Most reviewers found the new
version to be fast, and stable, and appreciated the changes.  Proprietary
programs and multimedia codecs are missing of course, in line with the
Fedora philosophy, and some reviewers have asked for easier ways to get
everything working.</p>

<p>Download Zod at <a
href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraMain">http://fedoraproject.org</a></p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Slackware 11.0 out</h3>

<p>Another one of the old-school distributions, Slackware 11.0 released
after spending more than a year in developement. Slack 11.0 ships with Xfce
4.2.3.2 and KDE 3.5.4, the latest version of the award-winning K Desktop
Environment. Slackware uses the 2.4.33.3 kernel with features such as the
ReiserFS journaling filesystem, SCSI and ATA RAID volume support, SATA
support, and kernel support for X DRI (the Direct Rendering Interface)</p>

<p>Slack 11.0 also fully supports the 2.6 kernel series, using either the
well-tested 2.6.17.13 kernel or the recently released 2.6.18 kernel. Unix
veterans will appreciate the simplicity and stability of Slackware.
Slackware 11.0 comes with everything needed to run a powerful server or
workstation, but new users might be taken aback at the lack of GUI
configuration tools.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://slackware.com/getslack/">list of mirrors</a> will
help you get your Slack on.</p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Linux Mint combines Ubuntu and Mulitmedia</h3>

<p>Linux Mint is a distro that attempts to overcome the lack of Proprietary
Multimedia codecs and plug-in's in Ubuntu. The Ireland based Linux Mint
team released version 2.0, based on Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy Eft". It uses the
Ubuntu installer, and comes standard with Flash 9, Java and Real Player
10.</p>

<p>MP3, Windows media and other codecs, along with DVD support is also
enabled. The rest of it is mostly Ubuntu, so all the usual bits and pieces
are present.</p>

<p>Download <a href="http://linuxmint.com/download.html">here.</a></p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Xandros 4 for Thanksgiving</h3>

<p>Xandros Inc. will be giving business Linux users yet another reason to
give thanks: Xandros Desktop Professional version 4.0 is slated for release
the day after Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The new version of Xandros is designed to work well in both Linux- and
Windows-based office networks. It comes ready for use on NT domain, AD
(Active Directory), and Linux/Unix NIS (Network Information Service)-based
LANs.</p>

<p>The Xandros team has taken great care to provide seamless integration
into existing Windows-centric networks by supporting group policy profiles,
logon scripts and domain and AD authentication. Read/write support for NTFS
is standard.</p>

<p>The Xandros UI is customized to look a great deal like Windows XP, and
includes Crossover Office that allows you to run selected Windows
applications on Linux. Don't expect every application to work, but
Microsoft Office is reasonably well supported.</p>

<p>All this comes at a price, however. Pricing information has not released
yet, but is expected to be similar to the last version, at $129 for a
single license.</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Mark Shuttleworth attempts to lure OpenSUSE developers</h3>

<p>Just a few weeks after the Novell-Microsoft deal, Ubuntu head honcho
Mark Shuttleworth sent an <a
href="http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse/2006-11/msg03765.html">email</a>
out to the OpenSUSE Mailing list, in which he speaks of the wickedness of
Novell, and pitches Ubuntu's way of development. "If you have an interest
in being part of a vibrant community that cares about keeping free software
widely available and protecting the rights of people to get it free of
charge, free to modify, free of murky encumbrances and 'undisclosed balance
sheet liabilities', then please do join us."</p>

<p>Reaction to this has not been very positive, so far, with people on both
sides of the fence claiming that Mark should not have been quite so eager.
However, as of this writing, there has been no official comment from either
Novell or Ubuntu.</p>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt" />Sony Playstation 3 Launches, and Linux is quickly installed on it</h3>

<p>November saw the launch of Sony's next-generation console. There were
the usual reports  of long lines, of crazy prices on Ebay, and the
not-so-usual reports of <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/11/17/playstation.ap/index.html">people
getting shot for it</a>! Linux fans will be more interested to learn that
Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) actively encourages installation of Linux
on their new baby.</p>

<p>The necessary files can be downloaded from the <a
href="http://www.playstation.com/ps3-openplatform/index.html">Open
Platform</a> website. You will need to follow instructions, but Fedora Core
6 is fairly easy to install, and supports most of the PS3's hardware. A few
tutorials are <a
href="http://ps3.qj.net/PS3-Linux-The-void-has-been-filled-Full-install-instructions-for-Fedora-Core-5-/pg/49/aid/73144">available</a>.

Aditya was bored one day in 1997 and decided to take a look at this
 "linux thing". After installing Red Hat 5, and looking at the blinking
 cursor, he promptly removed it and went back to Windows. And then
 reinstalled a few days later, determined to figure it out. So far, he's
 figured some stuff out, but he's still trying, and he's still having
 fun.

<p>
Samuel Kotel Bisbee-vonKaufmann was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA
area. His interest in all things electronics was established early as his
father was an electrician. Teaching himself HTML and web design at the age
of 10, Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science
and the FOSS community, running his first distro, Red Hat, when he was
approximately 13 years old. Entering boarding high school in 2002,
Northfield Mount Hermon, he found his way into the school's computer club,
GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and Science (a recursive
acronym), which would allow him to share in and teach the Linux experience
to future generations. Also during high school Sam was abducted into the
Open and Free Technology Community (<a
href="http://www.oftc.org">http://www.oftc.org</a>), had his first article
published, and became more involved in various communities and projects.
</p>

<p>
Sam is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at Boston University and
continues to be involved in the FOSS community. Other hobbies include martial
arts, writing, buildering, working, chess, and crossword puzzles.  Then there
is something about Linux, algorithms, programing, etc., but who makes money
doing that?
</p>

<p>
Sam prefers programming in C++ and Bash, is fluent in Java and PHP, and while
he can work in Perl, he hates it. If you would like to know more then feel free
to ask.
