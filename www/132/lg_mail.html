We have a big Mailbag for you this month - we've finally caught up!

<p>
Thanks to a lot of fantastic work on Ben's part, and a lot of
troubleshooting (and creative breaking) on mine, the Mailbag also has a hot
new look. We'd love to hear feedback from you on your opinion of it.

Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I've just put up an "LG projects" page (it's not yet linked anywhere);
please take a look at it, let me know what you think. I've found it
tremendously useful already for "externalizing" the project ideas I've
been carrying around in my head for a long time - now, I don't have to
remember all that stuff any more (whee!!!) <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I'd appreciate any comments on improvements, changes, etc.

<h3>Shoe string hosting</h3>

<p>
Or maybe the subject should read "I'm cheap, I want a host, but don't 
want to get ripped off and feel poorly about my choice".
</p>

<p>
Seriously, I've been looking at a bunch of low-cost hosting services. 
There are a whole bunch in the sub-$5.00 per month range ... and they 
all seem to be pretty much equal. Some of the review sites even give 
them decent ratings.
</p>

<p>
But, for everyone which a decent rating it's not hard to find a "never, 
ever use this host" review.
</p>

<p>
So, any of you folks using a cheap host you're happy with?
</p>

<p>
Oh, this is just for my personal stuff. I think I need less than 100meg 
storage and a few gig/month bandwidth. I can register my own domain, or 
get the free one included in most of the packages (is this a good/bad idea).
</p>

<p>
Hopefully someone has some experience to share.

&gt;  Another question: I've come across this after updating

&gt; display: unable to load font

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;  And vncviewer gives me this:

&gt; $ vncviewer wherever:2
&gt; VNC server supports protocol version 3.7 (viewer 3.3)
&gt; Password:

Mine certainly recognizes those patterns, and can match them from the
installed fonts (which is why, I suppose, I don't have that problem. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
If yours can't - and I suspect that this is what you'll find - then you
need to do a little investigative work to find out what's happening.
First, you'll need to find out what X considers your font directories:

<h3>Nokia tablet article</h3>

</p>

<p>
[For the Mailbag, regarding my Aug 9 letter about a Nokia tablet article.]
</p>

<p>
The more I looked into the Nokia Internet Tablet 770, the more I
became concerned about its speed, capacity, and cost of add-ons I
considered essential.  I finally ended up going to the dark side and
getting a Macintosh laptop. [1] So if anybody wants to do an article
on the Nokia or on Linux or Open Source use in palmtops in general,
we're looking for one.
</p>

<p>
[1] Well, it's not <strong>that</strong> dark, it's only twilight compared to a
certain other OS.  But it was strange reading a 6-page license
agreement when I hadn't used proprietary software for nine years.  And
I still use Linux at work. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<h3>FFMPEG Installation</h3>
<p>
<b>Suramya Tomar [suramya at suramya.com]</b><br />
<b>Tue, 10 Oct 2006 17:04:22 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
Hey Everyone,
  Got the questions below via email and I was hoping one of you might 
have an answer for him (The stuff in brackets are my questions):
</p>

<p>
1. If /tmp partition is mounted with noexec and nosuid flags, is it not 
possible to run ./configure? If so how can we bypass this?
</p>

<p>
(I remember reading somewhere that mounting /tmp with noexec and nosuid 
is a good security precaution, but if it causes trouble with the 
./configure then is it worth it?)
</p>

<p>
2. How to modify (RPM - atrpms.net) installation of FFMPEG to include 
the amr_nb / amr_wb fixes in order for me to be able to convert 3GPP 
video to FLV.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for the help.

<h3>More suggestions on my perl app... And, an announcement!</h3>
<p>
<b>clarjon1 [clarjon1 at gmail.com]</b><br />
<b>Tue, 1 Aug 2006 20:50:57 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
Hello, gang!
I've worked on my perl program a bit, and added stuff like command
line switches to it.  I've gotten it set up so that, if I don't enter
a switch, it will display the contents of the 'calendar' file, and if
there is a command line switch, it won't.  Nothing fancy...
</p>

<p>
I've attatched it, because I don't want to spend a lot of time
stripping out a lot of comments.  Hope you don't mind.  Here's what I
want to do (other than update the TODO in it):
</p>

<p>
1) More interactive:  Nothing like Ncurses, just something along the
lines of if I add my -A switch (for Add), and I don't specify any
input, that it will allow me to enter input rather than just add a
blank line.
2) Make it use arrays!  That is, be able to read arrays from disk.  Or
would I just be better off telling it to use postgres as a database?
Either way, I don't know what to do.
3) Make it able to search for a specific item, and/or sort by specific
items.  Very useful, dunno if it's worth the time and effort, really.
</p>

<p>
That's all I can think of at the moment.
</p>

<p>
Oh yeah, the announcement!
</p>

<p>
I'm going to Los Angeles, California on the 8th this month, to attend
the DCLA conference there.  I'm going to be in a plane on Monday!
Very nervous, I am.  I believe that we will be driving a 2hr drive
down to Toronto, Ontario, and then taking a flight from there all the
way to LA (hope I get a window seat!!)
</p>

<p>
Any LG people in LA?  Maybe we could meet (unlikely, but would be nice :D)
</p>

<p>
Apparently, the hotel is nearby the conference (a Hilton, I've heard)

<h3>Debian Installation</h3>
<p>
<b>Neil Youngman [ny at youngman.org.uk]</b><br />
<b>Sun, 1 Oct 2006 19:49:09 +0100</b>
</p>

<p>
Well I've had enough of the creeping bit rot in my Mepis installation and I 
want to be rid of Mepis. I'm trying to go back to a plain vanilla Debian 
installation. I've also recently upgraded my system with a SATA conroller and 
a 200GB hard disk, onto which I tried to install Debian with the Debian 3.1 
net installer.
</p>

<p>
The default install hung, so I went for the "expert" install and got an 
installation on the SATA disk. It's definitely there, I can see it, but I 
can't boot from it. 
</p>

<p>
It's on /dev/sda5, and grub loads the kernel up, but the kernel panics because 
as far as it's concerned /dev/sda5 doesn't exist. I can only assume that the 
kernel it has installed doesn't have the right module (SiI3112) installed for 
the SATA controller. 
</p>

<p>
Is there a way to check what modules are built into this kernel? 
</p>

<p>
Is there a simple way around this? 
</p>

<p>
Is it best just to build my own kernel to replace the one that has been 
installed? 
</p>

The weird thing is, it was Mailman that objected to your message and
held it for my manual approval, claiming that SpamAssassin had flagged
it as "possible spam" -- yet, as you can see, SA's score was 3.5, well
below the 4.0 spamicity threshold I set in SpamAssassin.  I'm not sure
what's going on <em>there</em>.
</p>

<p>
In any event, spamicity = 3.5 is eyebrow-raising enough in itself, so
let's see what all those failed tests in the X-Spam-Status line are:[1]
</p>

<p>
AWL:  Auto-WhiteList.  This is a simple "address or IP that has been
heard from in the somewhat recent past" database, giving ones <em>not</em>
heard from recently a small boost to the maybe-distrust-this spamicity
score.
</p>

<p>
BAYES_00:  A "Bayesian" statistical test on the body text.  The "BAYES_00" 
result means that the Bayesian estimate of probability is that there's 
only a 0-1% likelihood of your post being spam, and that result actually
<em>reduces</em> the post's spamicity score.

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Some news.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose this was bound to happen sooner or later. Debian
&gt; maintainer's J. Jaspert and E. Bloch lost patience with J. Schilling
&gt; and have forked "cdrtools" to create cdrkit. Some details at
&gt; 
&gt; 	<a href="http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/FORK">http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/FORK</a> 
&gt; 
&gt; (The forked tar.gz can be found in <a href="http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/">http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/</a>).
&gt; Other reasons for the fork can be found on
&gt; <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cdrecord">http://bugs.debian.org/cdrecord</a> and on the Linux Kernel mailing lists.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Good for them <strong>and</strong> everyone else, I say. I've been struggling with (and
quietly cursing at) Joerg Schilling's DVD-writing software for a long
time. On the one hand, it's the only DVD-writer that I could get to work
on this strange DVD drive I have (Matshita DVD-RAM UJ-820S) - but it
would only let me write at 1x due to nothing more than some strange
conceit of the author's. As I recall from his explanation on a web page,
he had decided that the Linux /dev implementation sucks, and until it
was rewritten to be more like that of BSD, he wouldn't do anything to
make 'cdrecord' work reasonably. Elsewhere, in every instance that I've
seen him involved in a discussion about any technical issue, I was
struck by his inflexibility ("bull-headedness" would be too strong of a
term, since he is highly technically competent, but the stubborn refusal
to even consider any viewpoint other than his own was... less than
admirable.)
</p>

<p>
Now, according to the Debian bunch, he's exhibiting that same kind of
intransigence and blind adherence in an area which is clearly not his
strong point - licensing issues. [shrug] His right as the author, of
course... but this is exactly the reason that forking is such a useful
method. This is, in my opinion, as good as Open Source gets.
</p>


<p>
(BTW: has anyone else noticed that the largest, toughest, most dangerous
monster in QuakeII is called 'Jorg'? I'm just sayin'. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">))

<h3>navigation using ubuntu</h3>

&gt; Hi Ben
&gt; I've started using Ubuntu which is so great compared to Windoze and if I
&gt; can manage to run some navigational software I could eliminate Windoze
&gt; altogether. (It would be like getting rid of an abcessed tooth). Any
&gt; ideas? Will Wine run Nobeltec? Or do you know of any Nav software
&gt; available in open source?
</pre>
</p>

<p>
I've actually posted about this on the 'origamiboats' list a while back,
but I'll repeat it and expand on it a bit. If you don't mind, I'm also
going to CC this exchange to The Answer Gang at the Linux Gazette; this
is actually a question that I get asked on a regular basis by other
sailors who use Linux, and I believe a number of people could benefit
from the answer.
</p>

<p>
I've checked out a number of programs intended for navigational use
under Linux; all of these have been useful to some degree, and some,
like SeeMyDEnc (<a href="http://www.sevencs.com/index.php?page=123">http://www.sevencs.com/index.php?page=123</a>) are becoming
more and more useful day by day, as NOAA and other chart-producing
agencies convert more and more of their charts to the S-57 and other
modern charting formats; in fact, S-57 charts and viewers have become so
good that they are now treated as a legal equivalent of paper charts in
commercial shipping regulations (!). These converted charts,
incidentally, are available free of charge at
<a href="http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/">http://chartmaker.ncd.noaa.gov/</a> - a service that's worth thousands of
dollars to cruisers, given the average cost of paper charts.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the two programs that I use most of all in my navigation are
'xtide' and Mayko's 'mxmap'; the former shows a list of currents and
tides for any location in the world, while the latter is a very
featureful chart viewer. 'mxmap' reads BSB charts, does GPS tracking,
allows you to construct/follow routes, set markers, "scribble" on the
charts, and do lots of other goodies. It also allows you to use, e.g., a
scan of a map or a chart - you just set the lat/long of diagonally
opposing corners, and away you go.
</p>

<p>
The only problem with 'mxmap' is that it is unmaintained; the developers
(Mayko), as far as anyone seems able to tell, have disappeared off the
face of the earth leaving us with this really nice piece of software.
Maybe they went cruising. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Since Ubuntu is Debian-based, you should be able to install 'xtide' via
the standard installation mechanism ('apt-get install xtide' as root);
"xmap" can be found at <a href="http://fresh.t-systems-sfr.com/linux/src/">http://fresh.t-systems-sfr.com/linux/src/</a> (look
for three files with 'xmap' in the name - one of them is a bunch of
sample maps, the other two are static and dynamic versions of the
program.)

<h3>mass-editing MP3s</h3>
<p>
<b>Faber J. Fedor [faber at linuxnj.com]</b><br />
<b>Wed, 6 Sep 2006 11:11:07 -0400</b>
</p>

<p>
<p class="editorial">
 Ben's response to this question was published as
<a href="../131/lg_tips.html#2-cent-tips.05">http://linuxgazette.net/131/lg_tips.html#2-cent-tips.05</a> --Kat 
</p>

Does anyone know of an app/script that will automagically set ID3 tags
in my MP3s files using freedb?
</p>

<p>
I got one of those pod thingies that are so popular with the kids these
days and discovered that quite a few of my MP3s don't have ID3 tags on
them.  I have no idea how that happened since I've ripped every CD with
grip (which means my MP3s directory hierarchy follow the standard format
of artist/album/song.mp3). 
</p>

<p>
Googling "mass edit mp3s" brings up mostly Windows apps. I gather most
of those will let me makes changes to ID3 tags across a group of MP3s
(say changing "Bush, Kate" to "Kate Bush" en masse) as opposed to what I
want (look up the info on freedb and apply that info to the MP3s).
</p>

<p>
I did come across something on IBM Developer Works that uses a couple of
Perl modules (we now have Ben's attention!) and freedb but I couldn't
get it to work properly, meaning a) I couldn't understand the docs and
b) I couldn't redirect the output to a file to see wtf it was doing.
</p>

<p>
Since I don't want to rip and encode all of those CDs again, I'll
happily roll my own, but I thought I'd check with you guys to see if
I've missed an existing solution.

<h3>gmail setup</h3>

<p>
Hi All,
</p>

<p>
I'm getting lots of bounce notices regarding incoming mail from gmail.
I'm baffled.  Would this be generated by <em>my</em> host?
</p>

<p>
1) I'm popping with fetchmail.
</p>

<p>
2) Due to postfix (yuck) sending mail to the bit-bucket, I've tried
bypassing it and specifying procmail as the mda in .fetchmailrc.
</p>

<p>
I don't understand why it cites failure to establish an smtp connection
with jkarns at localhost:
</p>

<p>
   TEMP_FAILURE: Could not initiate SMTP conversation with any hosts:
   [localhost (1): Connection refused]
</p>

<p>
It would make a little more sense to me to see msgs like this being
generated by postfix on my host, but don't see what POPping from gmail
should be related in any way to an smtp connection.
</p>

<p>
Any suggestions / help much appreciated.
</p>

Here's an example:

</p>

<p>
For 2.6.17-rc1 upwards you should try out "uswsusp" which tries to
sort out problems with prior suspend(s).
</p>

<p>
My current situation is quite happy vis-a-vis both suspend to disk
suspend to ram. I use the "stock" Debian linux-image-2.6.17-2-686
(version 2.6.17-8) and initramfs-tools (version 0.77b) with
aforementioned uswsusp (0.2-3).
</p>

<p>
Everything "works" out of the box except for a minor hiccough with
suspend-to-ram which required some hacking as follows. 
<pre>
	a. Save current device config to disk 
		cat /proc/bus/pci/00/02.0 &gt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_0
		cat /proc/bus/pci/00/02.1 &gt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_1
	b. Suspend-to-ram
		echo -n mem &gt; /sys/power/state
	c. Restore device state on resume
		cat &gt; /proc/bus/pci/00/02.0 &lt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_0
		cat &gt; /proc/bus/pci/00/02.1 &lt; /var/lib/acpi/vid_1
</pre>
The developers of suspend are undecided on whether they should wait
for the kernel to fix this or just make the change to s2ram since the
problem seems to be for specific hardware combinations like the
thinkpad R51 with intel graphics (or perhaps only for that
combination!).
</p>

<p>
I should perhaps also mention that suspend worked fine on my laptop
with Ubuntu Dapper which I tested out.
</p>

<p>
Generally, I have found that "suspend-to-disk" works out-of-the-box
with all laptops that I have come across; "suspend-to-ram" seems more
tricky. Given my experience, I would say that Ben is singularly unlucky :-(

Everything looks fine to me.  I would suggest you move the default port to
another address: something high (&lt; 64000) and random. A cracker seeing
something open on port 22 will do an SSH attack, but on port 54256 he won't
know what program to use.

<p>
IIUC, I think it's asking for your passphrase, the one you used to generate
the key-pair, no?  To get around that, you have to generate keys with no
pass-phrase (which is considered A Bad Thing).

<p>
Not only that, but despite

<p>
<pre>
&gt; setting PermitRootLogin to 'no', and AllowUsers to 'user' (the name of
&gt; the account I set up), when attempting to login as either root or any
&gt; other user on the machine, the ssh client simply asks for the account
&gt; password three times and then fails, instead of failing immediately -
&gt; is it supposed to do that?

</p>


<p>
Yes, it's supposed to do that.  With that behaviour (prompting for the
password three times), the cracker isn't sure if A) root logins are disabled
or B) he has the wrong password. If it failed immediately, he would know
that A was true.  Anything to slow the little buggers down.

You know what I mean.  I have only one OS setup on my harddisk and I have no
use for grub or lilo.  How do I boot directly into linux?
</p>

<p>
I noticed in the kernel sources there is a file named bootsector.  I cannot
find any information on how to use it.

<p>
It must be simple to do but the question is how?

I am using fedora core 5, arch: x86_64.  All updated using yum.

<h3>IE6 under IceWM</h3>

Hi. I've dl'd and installed the IE6 running under Wine from
<a href="http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page">http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/page/Main_Page</a> This is useful step 
in testing web page development ... I don't care enough about it to 
actually test with a real windows machine, but if I can test locally 
using IE6 it is not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
Under gnome or KDe it works just fine. But, it crashed (or stalls) under
icewm. I have tried to start from a terminal and from the toolbar. Under
a terminal I get the Wine debug prompt, and a "loading" window. But that
is about it.
</p>

<p>
I am thinking there is a path difference or something. But, I have
checked and don't see and obvious differences.
</p>

<p>
I have checked on the tatanka page and don't see anything on this topic. 
And a request to the IceWM users list has drawn a blank as well. Maybe 
one of you guys has an idea on this?

<h3>fonts puzzle, and puzzling gmail spyware page upon login from firefox</h3>

<p>
Hi All,
</p>

<p>
  Has anyone else come across this gmail "spyware"
  page when trying to log into gmail using Firefox?
</p>

<p>
    [ Snipped image ]
</p>

<p>
  As you can imagine, it plays havoc with the gmail
  notifier extension, as well as making me doubt
  my ability to read, each time I try to log in.
  (Trying to type in the contents of the squiggly
   message displayed in the box seems to be a task
   my brain is almost incapable of handling early
   in the morning).
  So I'm wondering, is this something Firefox is
  doing to annoy gmail? Or just something
  gmail has started doing to annoy all their users?
</p>

<p>
  Another question: I've come across this after updating
  Debian testing: I seem to be loosing fonts, or at least
  the helvetica font I need for vncviewer and imagemagic:
</p>

<p>
  For example, "display image.jpg" gives me:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
display: unable to load font
`-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
display: unable to load font
`-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--12-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1'.
</pre>
  And vncviewer gives me this:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
$ vncviewer wherever:2

Warning: Unable to load any usable ISO8859 font
Warning: Missing charsets in String to FontSet conversion
Warning: Unable to load any usable fontset
Error: Aborting: no font found
</pre>
  I tried searching for explanations, and as far as
  I can tell I've got all the font packages installed.
  I attach the output from running
<pre>
    dpkg --get-selections &gt; /tmp/dpkg--get-selections
</pre>
  in case it could be helpful.
</p>

<p>
    [ snipped ]
</p>

<p>
  I have a machine running Debian stable, and both
  "display" and "vncviewer" are working fine, but
  comparing the strace hasn't gotten me very far.
  I was wondering if anyone would have any hints,
  I've not much experience / understanding of X11 fonts.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
Peter.

My plans are to develop simple web-based application using Perl
scripts and MySQL as back-end for data storage. Am planning to host
the application using Apache http server. Am aware that Perl modules
(DBI) are needed to interact with database. I have little knowledge of
db design.
</p>

<p>
My question :
</p>

<p>
Am lost here, how to start this whole activity ? Reason is, am not
comfortable in embedding the Perl scripts with HTML tags and regular
functions for data management needs.
</p>

<p>
Intention is to keep the, scripts providing the front-end and back-end
processing, separate and not mix all in the same script(s).
</p>

<p>
Looking forward to your suggestions.
</p>

<h3>"New" Windows Vista features vs. OS/X</h3>

Somebody took the audio from a Micr0s0ft Vista "we're so brilliant,
we've invented all this new stuff" shill session and overlaid it on a
video of themselves doing it all on their OS/X desktop - with a few
additional twists. High amusement factor, including Bill G's 1977
"jailbird" photos.

<h3>frame rate of VCD and DVD</h3>
<p>

<p>
Dear gang...
</p>

<p>
I face a trouble here. Does anyone know the frame rate of VCD and DVD? 
Also, what is the fps (frame per second) of movie trailers spreading on 
Internet? What is the right way to calculate the fps? 
</p>

<p>
My another problem is, suppose I have a video clip which has 30 fps. 
What should I do if I want to double the fps (i.e 60 fps)? Is there any 
tool available to do this?
</p>

<p>
Any hints would be greatly appreciated... Thanks in advance.
</p>

<p>
regards,
</p>

<p>
Mulyadi

<h3>DNS security</h3>

I am a member of the network group at a university in Atlanta Georgia,
some time ago we had a minor DOS from off campus to our main DNS server,
at that time we decided to only allow outside connections from our
service provider (Peachnet) and block all others with our firewall. We
seem now to have a problem with the root "EDU" servers.
<pre>
;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      M3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      A3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      C3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      D3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      E3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      G3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      H3.NSTLD.COM.
edu.                    172800  IN      NS      L3.NSTLD.COM.
</pre>
They cannot resolve anything in our domain including our primary DNS
server. Do we need to include these servers in our rule base ?
How do we protect against a DOS attack on our DNS servers ?
</p>

<p>

Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>

<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found full of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler.
