<center><h3>Introduction</h3></center>

<p>I've accumulated a few updates to past articles and reviews, presented here
in reverse chronological order.  By the way, I appreciate the e-mail I receive
from LG readers; keep it coming!

<center><h3>The Keyboard Practicer</h3></center>

<p>Last month, in the second of two articles about typing tutor
programs I included the Tcl source for a program by Satoshi Asami 
called Keyboard Practicer.  It turns out that the version I had
didn't include the licensing information, which follows:

<p>The updated archive (which doesn't include any changes other than the
inclusion of the above license) is available from this FTP
<a href="ftp://stampede.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/kp/kp-0.97.tar.gz"> site</a>.

<center><h3>Typist</h3></center>

<p>A couple of issues ago I wrote about a console keyboard tutor called
Typist, which at that time was in Sunsite's /pub/Linux/Incoming directory.
I've received e-mail inquiries as to its current location, which isn't
obvious.  The new location is 
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/cai/typist-2.1a.tar.gz">here</a>.

<center><h3>TkDesk</h3></center>

<p>After a long hiatus, Christian Bolik has released a new version of his
featureful file-and-desktop manager TkDesk.  I reviewed a much earlier release
back in 1996 (LG #8), and in the several releases since then the application
has improved and matured.  Another factor which has changed since 1996 is the
typical desktop machine running TkDesk.  The application felt a trifle
sluggish on my old, low-memory 486, but on a reasonably recent Pentium-based
system TkDesk runs well.  Aside from being a versatile and configurable
file-manager, TkDesk occupies a sort of middle ground between the typical
miscellaneous collection of Linux apps and a full-fledged desktop manager such 
as KDE or Gnome.  Its integration with Netscape and XEmacs is particularly
useful, and the button-bar is one of the most configurable and useful I've
seen for X-Windows. 

<p>TkDesk still won't run with Tcl/Tk 8.0, but now that incrTcl
(the C++ object-oriented extension to Tcl) has been updated to work with the
newer Tcl/Tk releases,  the release of a version of TkDesk which uses these
libraries can't be too far off. The new 1.1 release of TkDesk works fine with
Tcl7.6/Tk4.2 for the time being.  The TkDesk homepage is
<a href="http://people.mainz.netsurf.de/~bolik/tkdesk/">here</a>.

<center><h3>Window Managers</h3></center>

<p>Two of the most promising new window-managers available for X have been
undergoing rapid development lately.  Marco Macek's Icewm is getting better
with each release, and the recent betas have been including GNOME-specific
features.  This won't affect those users who aren't using GNOME, as the
configure script detects a GNOME installation and disables these features if
CNOME isn't installed.  Check out the icewm 
<a href="http://berta.fri.uni-lj.si/~markom/icewm">home-page</a>
for the latest news.

<p>Brad Hughes has been working hard to squelch bugs and further refine his
Blackbox window-manager.  He has successfully converted Blackbox so that it
uses the GNU autoconf system instead of an Imakefile type of configuration; in
other words it now uses a configure script to generate a custom-tailored
makefile, which in some cases will make Blackbox easier to compile.

<p>The Blackbox home-page is <a href="http://linux.wiw.org/blackbox">here</a>.
