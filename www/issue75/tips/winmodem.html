<h2>So I'm having trouble with this internal modem...</h2>

<p>It's probably a winmodem.  Winmodems suck for multiple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of them lack drivers for Linux.  Notice the term "most" and not
    "all" -- see <a href="http://linmodems.org/">http://linmodems.org</a> for 
    more about those few that do, and some general knowledge on the subject.
    Last time we looked (Issue 63, "<a href="../../issue63/tag/2.html">State
	of the Art in Softmodems</a>") only four models had any support,
	and only two had vendor help.
<li>Since they aren't a complete modem without software, even if they
    were to work under Linux, they'd eat extra CPU that could be better
    spent on other things.  So they'll never seem quite as fast as their
    speed rating would imply.
<li>Internal modems (even those which bear complete chipsets) have their own 
    problems;  they overheat more easily, and have a greater danger of harming
    other parts in your system when they fail, merely because they're attached
    directly to the bus.  The tiny portion of speed increase that might lend
    is not really worthwhile compared to the risk of losing other parts in
    the system. 
</ol>

<p>So, yeah, there can be good internal modems, but it's more worthwhile
   to get an external one.  It will often contain phone line surge suppression
   and that may lead to more stable connections as well.</p>
