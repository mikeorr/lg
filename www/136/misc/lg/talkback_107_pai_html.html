&gt; Section:
&gt; 4.3 Profiling Threaded Code.
&gt; .
&gt; .
&gt; .
&gt; We get some surprising results, notably the following..
&gt; 
&gt; Running 2 threads took 0.000 seconds
&gt; Running Without Threads took 5.160 seconds
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Correct ans:
&gt; Running 2 threads took 6.170 seconds
&gt; Running Without Threads took 6.810 seconds
</pre>

<p>
It appears to me that the author has explained why the result is showing
0.000 seconds: 'run' never gets called, as it says in his article. Was
there something you wanted to add?

<p>
In the future, please use the Talkback: link at the bottom of each
article to comment on it; that sends the mail to the correct address and
allows The Answer Gang to discuss it. I've forwarded your e-mail to TAG for
you, this time.

Thanks,

That would be a little difficult in this case, as this article
predates the talkback mechanism.

Whoops. In any case, the principle holds good - I prefer that anyone
following up to articles use the mechanism, and it never hurts to remind
the readers <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
Unfortunately, the author seems to have disappeared, or at least his
e-mail address comes back dead.
