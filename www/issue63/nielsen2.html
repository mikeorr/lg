<h3>
<a NAME="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3>
When moving from Ohio to California, GNUJobs.com had some hard drives
(along with other hardware and software)
which were to be donated to 
<a href="http://www.colug.net">COLUG</a> (Central Ohio Linux Users Group). 
They needed to be deleted
before they were donated. 
2 out of the 3 hard drives had bad sectors on them, and the third
I ended up using as a hard drive for testing purposes, like creating
this article, so I ended up not giving any away. Still, I will need to
wipe a hard drive in the future, so I created this Perl script (which I 
will later convert to Python and make it have more options).
<p>
The goal of this Perl script is to just delete the hard drive at /dev/hdb 
(the slave drive on the Primary IDE controller) since I have a hard drive
removeable kit there. I want it to delete all partitions, create one
partition that takes up the whole hard drive, and then fill up the
hard drive with garbage data (including some random encrypted data
just to ruin a hacker's day trying to find out what the data is).      

<h3>
<a NAME="problems"></a>The Problems</h3>

Here is a list of problems I had and how I solved them:
<ol>
<li> <font size= +1>How do I get it to delete all the partitions?</font>
<p>I remember researching many different options to alter partitions on 
a hard drive, and doing it manually yielded the best results. I had used
a Perl Expect script to automate the fdisk program (fdisk partitions hard 
drives in Linux) in the past, and I decided to continue to do it
that way. I believe
there are better alternatives for the simple task of deleting all the 
partitions, like sfdisk and others, but if one solution covers all 
possibilities with 100% power and flexibility, I usually just stick to
one way of doing things so that I don't have to remember too many things
and if it ever gets more complicated, I don't have to learn anything new.  

<p>Thus, I used Expect code to simulate a user typing in the commands
for fdisk. The Expect code deleted all the partitions and then
it created one big partition.<p></li>
<li><font size=+1>How do I fill up the hard drive with garbage data?</font> 
<p> Just deleting partitions isn't enough to delete the data. I want 
to overwrite all old data 
with garbage to make sure the previous data was deleted.
I used sfdisk to get the size of the partition that fdisk created.
Then, I created a loop which would continuously print garbage data 
until the amount printed was equal or greater than the size of the partition.
<p></li>
<li>
<font size=+1> How do I put binary data on the hard
 drive to confuse a hacker?</font> 
 <P> I created random binary data using the
random function and "chr" function in Perl. Then, I encrypted the random
data using the Perl Blowfish module. If someone manages to decrypt the
data, it will still look like garbage and confuse them. I wanted to encrypt
the data so that it didn't look purely random in a mathematical sense.
<p> </li>
<li> <font size=+1> How do I reformat the big partition?</font> 
 <P> This was easy.  I just used a simple "mkfs" command. 
</ol>

<h3>
<a NAME="perl"></a>The Perl Script</h3>
The version of Perl I was using for this Perl script was out of date. 
I was using Perl 5.005_03 and I believe Perl is up to 5.6 as of 1/2001.
<p>
There are a lot of things I need to enhance to make this 
script more user friendly. There should be a lot more error checking,
considering how dangerous this script is, and prompts to ask a user
if they really want to do so stuff. I am waiting until I restart my MILAS
project (which will be written in Python) before I make this script better.
It was only to get me through moving from Columbus to the Bay Area.   
<p> I have commented a lot of the code, so hopefully a novice Perl
programmer can understand most of what I am trying to do.

##### Things to do
# 1. Make sure we create a brand new directory for temporary mounting
#     in order to avoid security risks in case someone is logged in.
# 2. Use perl functions to handle a lot of the system calls. 
# 3. Let it autodetect hard drives, and floppy drives, and only perform
#    actions on unmounted hard drives and floppy drives.

<h3>
<a NAME="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
Using Expect was not necessary (other programs could have solved
the simple problems I had). Using Blowfish was not necessary. As a matter
of fact, the whole darn script was way too long if you just wanted to
wipe a hard drive and fill it with blanks. However, I wanted to use
fdisk because I always want to use fdisk, Expect is such a powerful tool,
it is good to let people see how it works, and putting random garbage
 encrypted binary data in to confuse a hacker is just an extra touch. 
<p>
I don't understand the complete complexity of hard drives, so I am not
sure if there are residual data left on the hard drive.
For my purposes, and my level of security, it does exactly what
I need. As I develop MILAS more, I am sure there will be tighter checks
and enhancements to delete all data off of a hard drive.      
<p>
I tend to look forward in time trying to anticipate things which might be
needed in the future, which always causes a programmer to work more than is 
required for the project at hand. However, the mood struck me, and I like
the direction the script is going, and so, it doesn't bother me to write
up this article on an airplane flight. Making something cool doesn't
wear me out, unlike having to do work for someone else, which is real work.
