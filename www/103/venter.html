<h1>How Linux is Changing the Face of Education in Africa</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/venter.html">A.J. Venter</A></b></p>

<p>
<p> <b>O</b>kay, let's get the formalities out of the way first, so we can get
on with what this article is actually about: the FOSS revolution happening
in African Educational institutions today.

<p> My name is A.J. (It stands for an unpronounceably long Afrikaans name
so just don't ask), and what I do is to develop FOSS solutions for
Education. I work as lead developer for a company called DireqLearn. We are
South-African in origin, but have offices in several other African
countries now. The past two years have been very exciting for us. But this
is not about my company, it's an attempt to share what I have learned and
seen over this period about what is happening in Africa today: the
successes, the failures, and the alteration in mindset we are witnessing. 

<p>Two years ago, we started deploying LTSP-based thin-client solutions in
schools. As we progressed, we found that there were so many specific setups
and enhancements that we were doing over and over again, that we started
doing single pre-installed disk images, which we then just dd'd onto the
drives for the schools.

<p>This worked for a little while, but it didn't scale up far enough. Our
answer was to develop our own distribution that meets the needs of schools
specifically. We called it <a
href="http://direqlearn.net/olce">OpenLab</a>. There are a number of other
similar projects out there, although as best I am able to ascertain,
OpenLab is currently the most advanced project to create a distribution
specifically tailored to the needs of the African education market.

<p>But why is education in Africa different from anywhere else? Why not
just use <a href="http://www.k12ltsp.org/">K12LTSP</a> and be done with it?
Because the first thing you realize if you do this for a while, is that
when you put a computer lab into a school in rural Namibia where there is
only dirt roads and solar power, the teachers - petrified of damaging this
valuable gift, and generally petrified - will lock up the lab, and never
open it up again. In direct contrast, put children in front of these
computers and they will start exploring, digging, learning - not just about
computers; it becomes a means of accessing the wealth of knowledge that is
just a google away. A way for a little 8 year old boy who lives essentially
in the middle of knowhere [<i> I don't know if A.J. intended to use this
word or if it's a misspelling, but I'm leaving it in just as it is - I
<b>like</b> it. - Ben </i>] to become a citizen of the world.

<p> But you need to overcome the teacher barrier first. That means training
teachers until they are comfortable with the technology. Only then will
they let the children use them. Only then can you see growth, and
learning. I am an African, born and raised, and all too aware that the
continent is in shambles (and we do not gain anything by denying that fact.)
I know that at least part of the answer is education. It takes a lot more
than computers in schools to fix education, but it is a step in the right
direction.

<p>FOSS in this world is not just an idea, but a crucial requirement to
success, I believe. It's not just about cost, in fact with some of the
"education initiatives" a certain huge software developer has launched in
Africa, you could well find the costs basically equalling out. It's about
at least two other things.

<p> There is a philosophical side to it. Africa cannot proceed into the
twenty-first century as just a software consumer, we have a lot of
programming talent and potential on this continent, and we want to
participate in the global software industry as equals. That means skills
development. FOSS is just that, a form of skills development everyone can
afford. Universities and colleges are out of the price-league of most
Africans by far, but anyone can download and study source-code. By giving
more people access to FOSS systems, we improve the market for skills
attained on them, we increase the abilities of these people to gain and
expand those skills and perhaps most importantly, we keep our markets alive
and vibrant with the reality that alternatives exist.

<p> There is also a practical, technical side to it. Thin-client computing
doesn't just save money, it actually works much better in educational
environments. Suddenly, you are talking about a user-based system, rather
than a machine-based system. This means that you can let the children
explore and learn without worrying that they'll break the system for
everybody else. If a user in a Wind0ws(tm) lab hides the 'My Computer'
icon, the teacher has to waste time helping the next user get his system
standardized again in order to do the days lesson. This leads to draconian
measures - suddenly everyone just follows the rules, there is no personal
data, no exploration, no development. LTSP solves this nicely: if a user
hides an icon from the desktop, it's hidden on his desktop, no problem.
Also for the first time, users can learn to customize desktops to really
suit their working style, despite sharing resources. Some people prefer a
taskbar at the bottom, some prefer it on the left hand side. Neither is
better, each just a matter of preference. The more the computer works like
you think, the easier it is to work on. LTSP makes this possible.

<p> Finally FOSS offers one thing that is absolutely crucial to education,
and which no other model can compete with. Language support. First language
education is proven to be by far the most effective kind. FOSS systems
simply have better language support. Anyone can translate open code. The
number of African languages for which desktops, spellcheckers, and useful
applications are available is increasing almost daily, with the <a
href="translate.org.za">translate.org.za</a> project taking a leading
position here, including teaching translation skills to people doing
similar work in other countries.

<p>So all this sounds nice, but I said there is a revolution happening, so
I need to back that up. Here are just some of the projects which are
currently running <a href="http://direqlearn.net/olce">OpenLab</a> or
similar systems, such as <a href="http://k12ltsp.org">K12LTSP</a> and
<a href="www.skolelinux.no">SkoleLinux</a>.

<p>In Nigeria, the Education Tax Fund along with SchoolNet Nigeria has
already deployed 35 school sites with LTSP based systems.

<p> In Uganda, a project launched by SchoolNet Uganda has convinced the
ministry of education to mandate thin-clients for all future funded school
lab roll-outs.

<p> In Namibia a project currently running led by Schoolnet Namibia, will
be placing thin-client labs with wireless Internet access into over 200
schools. The largest non-Microsoft based lab roll-out in Africa to date.
Schoolnet Namibia aims to eventually put such labs into every school in
Namibia.

<p>Apart from the thin-client labs which is the area I am most heavily
involved in, there are numerous other projects currently running. The <a
href="http://www.cs.wits.ac.za/~adi/ossms/">OSSMS</a> project as well as
the schooltool project at <a
href="http://www.schooltool.org">schooltool.org</a> are working on creating
viable school administration software. Currently both are in advanced,
stable and usable states. In South-Africa the CSIR also has a number of
FOSS education projects under way.

<p>Simply put there is a revolution under way in Africa, education is being
revamped and taken to new levels. FOSS, and especially Linux is a key part
of this. Will it be successful? Will Africa move out of it's legacy of
poverty, disease, corruption and war? Perhaps not, it probably takes a lot
more than any given type of software to achieve a social revolution on that
scale, but it is not unattainable, and education is a key factor in
uplifting any society, and FOSS is changing the face of education in Africa
for the better.
