-------------------------
INSTALLING   THE   LINUX  MEGARAID   DRIVER

Ver: 0.91beta
Date: August 19, 1998

Requirements:

You need a full installation of Redhat 5.0, or Redhat 5.1, including the
kernel-headers and kernel-source packages.  If you don't have either of
these, you can get them off the CD or download them from Redhat, or
ftp.kernel.org.  The kernel version must be 2.0.x.  All kernels that
come with Redhat 5 are 2.0.x.  Support will be added soon for 2.1.x.


Applying the patch:

The patch file is named megaraid.patch.  You need to get this onto your
Linux system, and run it (in any directory).  If it stops and says "File
to patch:" then you don't have kernel-source or kernel-headers on the
system.  Go get them before you continue.

If you download the file directly onto your unix box, you need to make
sure megaraid.patch is executable before running it.  You can accomplish
this by typing:
chmod 755 megaraid.patch

If you get it onto the system using a DOS formatted diskette, use the
following commands to run the patch:
mount /dev/fd0 /mnt/floppy
/mnt/floppy/megaraid.pat

Now that the patch is applied, you can go on to rebuilding the kernel.


Recompiling your kernel:

Depending on your system configuration, you may want to customize your
kernel in any number of ways.  This document is only concerned with
adding MegaRAID support to an existing default kernel distribution.  The
following example will work with a default installation of Redhat, but
will need to be modified accordingly, if customized changes to the
system have been made.  More information on recompiling your kernel can
be found in the man pages and HOWTO documents for Linux.

All of the kernel compilation needs to be done from the /usr/src/linux
directory.  Type:
cd /usr/src/linux

To configure the kernel, type:
make menuconfig
A blue menusystem will come up.  To add MegaRAID support, select SCSI
support, then SCSI low-level drivers, and then AMI MegaRAID support. 
Space bar will toggle between disabled, [ ], linked into the kernel [*],
and make as a module [M].
If you want to boot from a drive connected to a MegaRAID controller, you
will need to have it linked into the kernel.
Exit out of all menus, and then select Yes when it asks if you want to
save changes to the kernel configuration.

To compile the kernel, type:
make dep
make clean
make zImage
The last of the three commands will take a while, possibly more than 30
minutes, if you have a slow system.

When it's finished compiling, copy the kernel image generated into your
boot directory:
cp arch/i386/boot/zImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.0.31m
The name vmlinuz-2.0.31m is an example, and can be whatever you like. 
If your kernel is not version 2.0.31, I would not recommend using this
example, as someone looking at your system later would be confused by
the different version number.  Don't name it the same as your old
kernel, which by default is /boot/vmlinuz-2.0.31 (or whatever the
version # is).

If you chose to compile the MegaRAID driver as a module (which can be
dynamically loaded and unloaded after the system has booted), you now
need to run:
make dep
make clean
make modules
make modules-install

Updating the OS loader:

The last step is to tell LILO (Linux loader) where to look for the
kernel image when booting up.  You need to edit the LILO configuration
file /etc/lilo.conf.  The old file should look something like this:
	
LILO.CONF   (OLD)   -----  unedited

boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.31
label=linux
root=/dev/sda1
read-only


You need to create a new section, similar to the one starting with
image= and ending with read-only.  The new section should be added
before the old one, so that the default kernel for LILO to load will be
the new one.  The only lines that should be changed in the new section
should be image=<new kernel image from above> , and label=linux-mega. 
The new file should look something like this:


LILO.CONF  (NEW)   -----   edited

boot=/dev/sda
map=/boot/map
install=/boot/boot.b
prompt
timeout=50

image=/boot/vmlinuz -  2.0.31m
label=linux-mega
root=/dev/sda1
read-only

image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.31
label=linux
root=/dev/sda1
read-only

If you want, you can change the image= to any name you want.  This is
the name that will appear when you presss TAB at the LILO prompt while
booting.

Before you reboot, make sure you run the following command:
lilo
This will write the new LILO configuration to the boot sector of the
hard drive, so the changes will take effect.
When you reboot, it should now automatically load the new kernel, and
should scan for a MegaRAID controller while booting.
If anything goes wrong and the new kernel doesn't load automatically,
press TAB and then select the label name of the old kernel ("linux", by
default).


· SPECIAL  NOTES

1.   This  driver  supports   the   428 , 466   and  438  controllers.

2.   Currently  Redhat Linux  5.0  is   the  only Linux distribution
this   driver   has   been  tested  on.

3.   This   driver   has   not   been  tested   for   multi  processor  
support,  or   any   extented  
      service   with-in   Linux  (only  basic  installation).   It  
has   not   been   tested   in   a   Networking   
      environment.

4.  This   driver   has   not   been   tested   for   performance.

5.    Currently, this driver does not support multiple luns from the
upper layer.  Multiple logical drives will  appear as targets on a
channel 1 greater than the last channel on the card.

6.  This   is   a   AMI   beta   driver   which    is   currently  
under   development.

7.  The   following   firmwares   have  been   tested   with   the 
0.91   driver.

                                    428  firmwares :     U79
                                    438  firmwares :     1.24
                                    466  firmwares :     2.09,  2.10



Driver  changes  since  last  release:

The  patch   command   has   been   added    to   the   source   code  
to   ensure   compatibilty
with   Linux   5.1.
