Title: Unix Storage Management<BR>
Authors: Ray A. Kampa, Lydia V. Bell<BR>
Publisher: Apress<BR>
Year: 2003

<P> There are some rather complex--and dare I say it--arcane
issues involved in managing storage in a Unix environment.
Indeed, Unix storage management can be a complicated affair. This is
especially true when you consider the many needs business places on storage
systems such as fault tolerance, redundancy, speed, and capacity.
Apress has published a book that they promote
as being written specifically about this topic, which weighs
in at a comfortable 302 pages of actual material.

<P> In general, I find <I>Unix Storage Management</I> to be a good
primer on storage management. However, I am a little
disappointed in the lack of focus on actually administering
storage. When requesting the book I assumed that I would
learn how to pull up my sleeves and tune and tweak file
system performance, optimize access to network-based
storage, and in general get a real feel for managing storage
in a Unix environment. But alas, that isn't the case. <I>Unix
Storage Management</I> deals mostly with the higher-level
details of understanding how storage works, determining what
kind you need, and then working to integrate that storage
into your network.

<P> This isn't to say that the book doesn't do a good job of
introducing the reader to the major components of modern
Unix storage systems. Indeed, technologies covered include
RAID, SANS, NAS, and backups, to name just a few. Kampa and
Bell actually do a good job of introducing this material,
but they do not treat the subject matter in great depth.
Essentially, after reading the text, readers will have enough
knowledge to do more research and know what they are looking
for, but they doubtless would not be in a position to
actually implement a solution in a demanding environment.

<P> The target audience for this book, whether intentional or
not, are IT managers and those that want a broad overview of
how storage systems work. Administrators that are in the
trenches would also enjoy skimming this book if for no other
reason than to remind themselves of the technologies
available for them. Also, most administrators will look
favorably on the chapter "Performance Analysis", which does
a rather good job of detailing the process of collecting and
analyzing performance information on storage systems. All in
all, this is not a bad book as long as you aren't expecting
to walk away with guru-like powers over Unix storage
systems.
