<P><STRONG>
Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I had a problem recently that I think was caused when I a shutdown from
a terminal in <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A> windows.  I did a 
<TT>shutdown -h now</TT> .  The system shut
down all right but the next time I booted I had some errors that stopped
<tt>apmd</tt> from loading and bringing up NFS failed.  Upgrading some packages I
was able to fix all that.  The system now boots properly.  I now find
that when I go to a virtual console and try to log in it fails with a
'<tt>login incorrect</tt>'.  I could sure use some help here.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks
<br>Ken Keith

A <TT>shutdown -h</TT> from within the X Windows System is likely
to leave a few stray lock and PID files laying around.
However, it should have any effect on your APM (advanced
power management daemon) or your NFS (network file system)
subsystem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I suspect that something else was going on here.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You say that you "upgraded some packages" --- though
you don't say which ones, nor which package management
system you're using (RPM, <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>, <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A>, Stampede?)
* (<A HREF="http://www.stampede.org"
	>http://www.stampede.org</A>).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Blindly upgrading packages may occasionally solve some
problems.  It's as likely to exacerbate them or cause
others.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One nice feature of the RPM system is the <TT>-V</TT> (verify) option
which allows you to get a handy list of which files differ
between the package database records and their actual nodes
in the filesystem.  Thus you can see size, MD5 checksum, and
especially ownership and permission differences which might
be causing problems.  Naturally it will also warning of any
missing files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Slackware simply uses compressed binary tarballs.  So
creative use of the '<tt>tar dzf</tt>' command can also give you
pretty good hints as to what's wrong, corrupted or missing.
(I wonder if Patrick every created/added a script to
automate that process.  I suggested it to him last year
at Linuxworld, but he might have been busy.  I'll copy
him on this note as a reminder).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
From what the Stampede folks told me in New York (at
the more recent LinuxWorld) the <tt>.slp</tt> format is a bzip'd
tar file with an appended trailer that contains all their
package management meta-data.  (I just tested that in
another '<tt>screen</tt>' session --- it works).  So a command
like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
bunzip2 -c /.../foo-0.1.2.slp | tar df -
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... should report differences between this SLP file and
the corresponding files on your system.  (This would
have to be done from the root directory, of course).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
We can ignore the error:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>bunzip2: foo-0.1.2.slp: trailing garbage after EOF ignored
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To make this into a reasonable system integrity
system all we have to do is have some way of getting
a list of all the packages that are intalled unto
the system --- and some way of translating those
package names into corresponding package filenames.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A Debian file (<tt>.deb</tt>) is generally an 'ar' file with
two or three members.  The '<tt>ar</tt>' command is a predecessor
to the '<tt>tar</tt>' command -- it was primarily used to "archive"
object (<tt>.o</tt> files) into libraries (<tt>.a</tt> files).  These
members are usually a <tt>control.tar.gz</tt> and a <tt>data.tar.gz</tt>
--- and (usually?) a small debian-binary file text file
listing some sort of debian dpkg version specification.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, all of the popular alternatives to the RPM system
are built around some sort of tar file core.  Thus we
can use '<TT>tar --diff</TT>' features to verify the basic integrity
of individual packages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course this only tells us about differences among
regular files (and device nodes).  There is a bug in
GNU tar which will report errors on UNIX domain sockets
(filesystem nodes that are marked in an <TT>ls -l</TT> with a
leading "<tt>s</tt>" character).  We could ignore those.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To make this into a reasonable system integrity
system all we have to do is have some way of getting
a list of all the packages that are intalled unto
the system --- and some way of translating those
package names into corresponding package filenames.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The we have to feed those tar files into a command
(or series of commands) to do the difference checking.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For Debian the core of this would be something vaguely
like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>cd /
for eachfile in .../*.deb; do
	ar p $eachfile data.tar.gz | tar dz
	done
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... if we had a single directory that contained links
to every <tt>.deb</tt> file that we had installed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One of these days all of the distribution maintainers
will take my suggestion and provide us with an easy way
to pop in our installation CD, boot from it, and give
us a report on the integrity of all our packages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(I'm oversimplifying a bit here.  We really want
ubiquitous use of digital signature databases for all
those cases where we grab our packages and package updates
from off the 'net.   The technology is there and free ---
but we seem to lack the will to employ it.).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I mean I can manage to do this sort of thing.  Little
scripts like the one above don't even take a moment to
formulate --- though they take much longer for me to type.
However, in increasing percentage of the Linux using world
doesn't know shell magic and the '<tt>ar</tt>' '<tt>tar</tt>' and related
commands like that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, enough about how to do package integrity checking.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Back to your question:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
You say that you can no longer log in from your virtual
consoles (VCs) after you did these upgrades.  Presumably you
can still log in through <tt>kdm</tt>, <tt>xdm</tt>, or some other means.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You don't say whether you are trying to login as '<tt>root</tt>' or
as some other user.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are a number of possible problems that can cause this
failure.  First, if it only happens to your '<tt>root</tt>' user (and
regular user accounts are not affected) you might have a
bogus <TT>/etc/securetty</TT> file.  <TT>/etc/securetty</TT> is a list of
terminals (and VCs) on which '<tt>root</tt>' is allowed to log in
directly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is generally preferable to log in under a normal user
account and use the '<TT>su -</TT>' command to to assume '<tt>root</tt>'
privileges.  However, it has classically been considered
O.K. to log in as root directly from the console.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If your system is PAM (pluggable authentication module)
based (like <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> since version 
5? or so, all versions
of Mandrake, and most other RPM based systems) then you
can control the login policies on your system by editing
the various files under <TT>/etc/pam.d/</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are small text files.  One for each "authenticating
service."  The ones you care about in this case are
<TT>/etc/pam.d/login</TT> and <TT>/etc/pam.d/other</TT>.  By removing or
commenting out the lines that refer to "<tt>securetty.so</tt>" you
can over-ride the default policies regarding where root
is allowed to log in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<em><p>[ I got problems during a PAM upgrade once; thank goodness for ssh, 
	which doesn't use the typical means to authenticate you if its own 
	keys are properly in place.  Thus I was able to go in and reset the 
	PAM policies to match local practices. It took less than 5 minutes,
	but that was 3 minutes too long, because two important people who
	couldn't login during the change complained!
</p><p>If root is fine, and some other low numbered accounts are fine 
	but most user accounts aren't, maybe you were editing the shadow
	file by hand? One colon out of place and nobody after the broken
	spot will align properly with their password hashes...
</p><p>-- Heather ]</p></em>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If this problem is affecting all users, root included, then
it could be that your new upgrades have disabled or enabled
some alternative mechanism for store your account passwords.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most likely this would mean that you were set to use
shadow with MD5 password hashes rather than the more
traditional DES hashes stored in the world readable
<TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Most Linux distributions that support MD5 passwords
at all will include '<tt>pwconv</tt>' or '<tt>pwconv5</tt>' and 
'<tt>pwunconv</tt>' or '<tt>pwunconv5</tt>' commands to convert to 
and from the shadow system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even if you're not using a PAM authentication suite
it's quite likely that you do have the shadow suite
installed.  You might look for a file named <TT>/etc/login.defs</TT>
to see if any of the comments or settings in there
relate to your problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let me backtrack for a moment and explain.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under UNIX and Linux the kernel (which enforces all
system security) isn't involved in the authentication
process at all.  This is done purely by user-space
utilities (like the '<tt>login</tt>' command).  The idea is that
these programs, running under the auspices of ultimate
system privilege (root) perform whatever process of
authentication their programmers designed; they set
the real UID and then execute the shell, or service
as appropriate to how you are connecting.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The oldest traditional form of UNIX login was a
program which was called by '<tt>getty</tt>'.  '<tt>getty</tt>' is
a program that simply "gets a TTY" --- setting the
communications parameters and terminal device driver
characteristics (like '<tt>stty</tt>'), emmiting the system's
<TT>/etc/issue</TT> message (pre-login banner), and waiting for
input.  When you entered anything on such a terminal
(into the '<tt>getty</tt>' program) then '<tt>getty</tt>' would '<tt>exec</tt>'
the '<tt>login</tt>' program, passing it whatever you had entered.
This was usually a username.  The login program would then
request a password.  You'd type in that, and it would
perform some math on it.  
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ul>
<li>(Specifically it was
taking the first 8 characters of what you entered,
stripping any of the 8th bits that were set, and using
the resulting string as a 56 bit DES key to "encrypt"
a sequence of ASCII NUL characters.  The result of this
encryption would then be encoded into a printable format).
</ul></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The login program would then read the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file,
search for an account that matched the username you gave to
'<tt>getty</tt>' extract the second field (the hash of the password)
and compare that to the value it computed from the password
you just entered.  If the value stored matched the value it
computed then it presumed that you know the right password
and it lets you in.  The login program would then extract
the next field of the passwd file entry, set the UID to that
value (this is your numeric user ID --- which is what the
kernel uses to identify your processes, files, etc), and
it would set you primary GID (group membership), change (cd)
to your home directory, and exec your login shell (the
seventh field in the old <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This <TT>"exec()</TT>" to which I keep alluding is significant.
Through the <TT>"exec()</TT>" family of system calls a UNIX process
"becomes" a new program.  The PID doesn't change.  It
doesn't  spawn a new one (that's done by <TT>"fork()</TT>").  It
just starts running a different program.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This authentication model was adequate for early UNIX
systems.  The number of systems out there, they way that
they were managed and monitored, the ways in which they
where interconnected, the computing horsepower which they
had available and the purposes for which they were being
used all make this a reasonable system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, over the years UNIX system were deployed in more
critical environments (growing beyond their research,
academic and modest business system roots into mission
critical infrastructure roles throughout industry and
government.  In addition the level of management and
monitoring changed (from primarily programmers to
wildly varying levels of system administration).  Meanwhile
the ways in which these systems became interconnected
(via phone, leased line, LAN and Internet) and the amount of
of computing horsepower, memory and available storage
all increased.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So the simple "adequate" authentication system that they
started with had become woefully inadequate.  After 10
years it was possible for crackers to compute most simple
passwords with "dictionary" attacks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file was traditionally where all primary
account information was stored on UNIX systems.  It store
username and UID, password hash, home directory, full name
(originally used for interconnections to GE computer system
accounts, and thus still called the GECOS field), etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Much of that information really needed to be accessed
quite frequently and by all users.  For example when you
do an '<TT>ls -l</TT>' command the '<tt>ls</tt>' command is referring to the
<TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file to map the file owner UIDs into user
names.  Thus the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file had to be "world readable."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Of course, one could argue that this was a bad design
decision.  They could have had a series of separate
files, one for the mapping of username to UID, another for
store the username/password hash values, another for
mapping shells to UIDs, etc.  This would have been somewhat
more complicated and less efficient in the early design,
though it might have been better in the long run).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The point of this story is that storing a hash of the
password in a world readable file was considered safe back
then.   Knowing that my password can be used as a
DES key to encrypt a sequence of NULs into a string like:
dV69Gd3wTNex5  was pretty useless 25 years ago.  It took
a significant amount of computing power to perform that
encryption operation just once (over a full second on the
common systems of the day).  So trying every word in a
dictionary on one of them was prohibitive.  You'd be
eating up so much CPU time that some system administrator
was sure to catch you at it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Of course the most common 60,000 words in the English
language could by tried in about a day or so --- so
it's ALWAYS been strongly recommended that you choose
passwords that aren't simple, common words).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Anyway, once the situation changed enough for this formerly
"adequate" system to be horribly and notoriously vulnerable
most UNIX vendors (and Linux distributions) adopted a
different set of conventions for storing the password
information.   In this case they simply extract the
password hashes  from the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> file and store them
elsewhere in an "adjunct" or "shadow" file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The adjunct/shadow file (so called because its contents
must shadow or be "kept in sync with" those of <TT>/etc/passwd</TT>)
is not world readable.  It only stores the user names and
password hashes.  Thus all of the programs that need access
to this file must run with advanced privileges.  The '<tt>login</tt>'
program is already running as '<tt>root</tt>' which it needs to do
in order to set the UID to an arbitrary value and "become"
some other user.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<em><p>[ Nowadays it also stores accounting information, like how long
	before your password expires, which is also considered privileged
	info, and none of any standard app's business to be poking around in.
</p><p>-- Heather ]</p></em>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Technically, under Linux, deep inside the kernel internals
this isn't strictly true.  The 'root' user on Linux is
really running with a whole set of "capabilities" or
"privileges" and it would be possible for those to be
individually raised and lowered for programs like '<tt>login</tt>'
--- in that regard Linux is a bit more like VMS than like
traditional forms of UNIX.  Notably there are other forms of
UNIX that have this sort of feature --- they are not sold
for general use but are sold as "Trusted" versions for
military and specialized use.  Like I said --- that is all
deep under the hood behind many tangles of other issues;
don't worry about it here).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course this change from traditional to shadow password
systems also required that all of the software that
check and change passwords be updated to use the extra file.
It also entailed the creation of new software to create
maintain and verify the consistency of the new file to the
old one.  A whole suite of utilities was affected.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One problem with this very simple authentication model
(where the system administrators, and system programmers
can rip out the authentication system an replace it) is
that you end up with lots of different programs all
co-ordinating on a common set of conventions.  Those
conventions then become written in stone --- they become
STANDARDS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you renamed <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> to <TT>/etc/accounts</TT> (which would be
an obviously more apt name) then you'd break all of the
software that relied on using <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> to perform
UID to name mappings.  Suddenly '<TT>ls -l</TT>' wouldn't work!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Actually all the programs that care are SUPPOSED to
use a set of well-defined library functions to get
this information.  That abstraction is SUPPOSED to allow
one to change underlying implementation details in
a way that is transparent to the programs that are
linked to those libraries.  This is SUPPOSED to be
rendered even easier with the nearly universal
adoption of shared libraries.  et cetera!  However,
these sorts of things often don't go quite as they're
SUPPOSED to).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, this brings us back to your problem.  I've described
quite a bit about how UNIX and Linux perform authentication
because I can't pinpoint what the problem is.  Now that
you understand a little about what's going on under
the hood -- you might be able find out what's happening
by looking at your <TT>/var/log/messages</TT>, reading any <TT>/etc/pam.d</TT>
files you find, tracking down any packages that report
differences (through whatever verification tricks you
try), and look at the <TT>/etc/passwd</TT> and the <TT>/etc/shadow</TT>
files to see if they don't match up somehow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Also, check your caps lock key!  You'd be surprised how
many people try to login with caps lock set and get
confused when it doesn't work.)
