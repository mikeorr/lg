<P>
Hello, and greetings once again from the world of The Answer Gang. I'm sure
some of you are wondering why we're so late - fact is, we actually managed
to get some of us together for lunch, having had the odd chance of being
close enough in the same state to drive the rest of the intervening
distance.
</P>
<P>
Real Life also has its interventions.  Not all bad - but the timing, well,
that can be.
</P>
<P>
I'm pleased to say one of my own interruptions of the outer world here
probably <em>won't</em> bore you to death -- and now it's revealed...
</P>

<h3 align="center">Running an internet lounge</h3>
<P>
For fun and profit?  Fun, absolutely!   Profit, um, no.  My Star Trek
Crew (<A HREF="http://trek.starshine.org"
	>http://trek.starshine.org</A>) runs an internet lounge at a handful
of science fiction conventions around here, and we either bring our own
older and not-so-valued equipment, or we use whatever is donated.  These
being the old grey mares of the computing world, it's inevitable - so
far at least one monitor or computer has gone on the fritz each time.
The one time we thought we were unscathed, a monitor died near the end,
it was wellll.... <EM>sort of</EM> usable... we shut it off.  Within the span of an
hour it got so bad the working blind really was better, or you'd be a
candidate for blinux afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular failure was a power supply glitch, all the magic smoke
leaked out, luckily it didn't incite anything else.  California has this
no-smoking indoors policy you see...
</P>
<P>
The first of these lounges fit Battlestar Galactica more than Star Trek - a
rag tag fugitive fleet, some can jump to light speed, and some, well, they
can't.   What distro, I hear you ask!   Well, since different members of my
crew - and a neighboring LUG - provided setups, we had:
</P>

<p><Strong><ul>
<LI>some Sparcs running debian

<LI>about 6 PCs running Mandrake

<LI>10 PCs running some form of Red Hat, kickstarted

<LI>maybe 4 more PCs running some debian or other

<LI>the token, err, talking BORG - as recommended by a blind friend of mine.

<LI>people brought their laptops of course.
</ul></Strong></p>
<P>
We've not run nearly so large a lounge since. 6 or 10 machines <EM>total</EM> is
more like it.
</P>
<P>
That was a pretty big conference, and people enjoyed the variety.  I was
surprised at why a particularly slow Sparc was enjoying such popularity, but
apparently it had the best selection of chat clients...
</P>
<P>
There's the key.  If you want to run a netlounge, know your audience, and
give them what they want.  In my experience, they <EM>mostly</EM> care very little
about the OS.  What they want are features:
</P>

<p><Strong><ul>

<LI>GOOD web browsers, so their webmail and blog sites won't turn them away.

<LI>Chat, oboy do these people like chat clients.

<LI>SSH for the geekier souls, we've gotta get our email, and/or, we have to
solve someone's problem at the most inopportune moment.

<LI>Being able to play sounds and run videos is certainly appealing.

<LI>Alas, with so much of the web being "live content" you should at least
make an effort to support flash and shockwave. Java would be nice too.

<LI>Some do want a word processor, although in retrospect, a friendly enough
text editor such as Nedit will serve many of them.  Printer's a good idea to
go with this...

<LI>Games? well, okay, maybe some games.  I recommend PySol.  Add it if your distro didn't put it in.  Even the deepest windows fan warms to PySol ... so far.

<LI>If you're going to offer sound, xmms and Mplayer rock. literally.  Beware
that the plugins above may make the browsers cranky about embedded video.
</ul></Strong></p>
<P>
They want to get at things too.  Handicapped access, icons NON geeks can
figure out (or else a big ol' icon map on the wall for this number one FAQ,
where's the $whatsit) and room to scootch the chairs around (yeah, a
technical term). In other words, make sure there's some <EM>lounge</EM> in your
net lounge.
</P>
<P>
In earlier lounges the word processor was not really a big hit. The glitz
was too good too early, abiword <EM>felt</EM> right, then crashed at the worst
moments.  It's better now - but some people have a rotten opinion of it. :(
StarOffice did better - but needs a machine with some oooooooooomph. Java...
</P>
<P>
Live CDs really made the thing take off nicely.  Now if the cords would
learn to telekinese themselves.... or the computers all came with wheels
like luggage...  mmmmmm case mods.  Yummmmm.  (No I haven't done it.  But
it's a thought.)   We've been using Knoppix in the last few lounges,
customizing it with our own art.  We might try Ubuntu, too.
</P>
<P>
Make sure you've enough people, that they stay fed so they aren't cranky,
that they occasionally get to run off and do other things (eyestrain makes
people cranky too).   Your silicate lifeforms will be easier to keep happy
when Murphy's Law isn't able to get your goat when it strikes... because
troubleshooting that fist through the case would be much easier, but,
umm, that's not the kind of disk first aid I had in mind!
</P>
<P>
Plan that setup and teardown will take double the time it takes to setup and
teardown in the otherwise perfect conditions of your geeky home.  Those
cords get tangled, the upstream DHCP looks askance at you, whatever.  Expect
delays - just get the Express Lane up and have a wild guess at your
estimated full-service time.  That solves desperation and hovering.
</P>
<P>
If the event is of any decent size, have an Extra Special Express Lane for
the people who make things happen.  It'll make them feel like it's a special
benefit - and those moments when a piece of the event is about to suffer if
they can't find some important reading that happens to be online, will not
involve kicking someone off a machine who doesn't already kinda behind the
scenes already.
</P>
<P>
This weekend's convention will be a fun filled time of music and getting
together with good friends.  Maybe a few will wish me a happy pre-dated
birthday.   That's the scoop this month folks - above all else, have fun!
</P>
