Rene,
</p>

<p>
Did you ever get around to publishing the scripts mentioned above?
</p>

<p>
What web management UI are you using? Was it something like phpldapadmin 
or some custom job?
</p>

<p>
What webmail system are you using with this setup?
</p>


<p>
Cheers,
Peter.

Not yet, and I am planning to release the code in a few weeks. I have to
make sure that all passwords are removed.

I use phpldapadmin for administrator access, but I used custom Perl

<p>
The system used a patched and ancient variant of TWIG
(<a href='http://informationgateway.org/'>http://informationgateway.org/</a>), but any IMAP-capable webmail system
will do. Squirrelmail is quite popular.

Renee,
</p>

<p>
I have been using Squirrelmail for sometime now. I have been rather 
disappointed in the lack of core development on it and looking around 
for other solutions that might be a better fit.
</p>

<p>
I looking at implementing sieve. I have not used it before. Seeing as I 
am currently using Squirrelmail (for now <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> ) there is a nice plugin 
made by the folks at the University of Athens in Greece called Avelsieve 
to make it easy for users. All of the different sieve interfaces seem to 
write their data to a place on the IMAP server (specified in 
imapd.conf). I see in your LDAP scheme you have "mailReplyText - for 
auto replies such as vacation messages". Is this somehow tied to sieve? 
How is this used?
</p>

<p>
Would it be too much trouble if you would shoot me an email with a link 
to those scripts when you are done sanitizingthem? I am not a 
Linuxgazette subscriber and would like to see if they are something that 
would fit.
</p>

<p>
I really appreciate your willingness to participate with end users (like 
myself).
</p>

<p>
Thank you,
Peter
