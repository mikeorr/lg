Note that for many readers, hda1 would have been dos or mswin, and
hda3 would have been linux ... or maybe hda5 would have been, if hda3
was an extend partition.  And for those of you wondering whatever
happened to hda2, it has almost certainly been set aside for swap.

You will note that each stanza entry has a "label"  In the sample above
the windows stanza is labeled "dos" So as root we add a line to the top
of the file "default=dos". Save and exit from editing the file and run
lilo. Now the label dos will be the default. Of course use your label as
the default, if it says windows instead of dos in your file then use
that. Don't forget to run lilo after saving the file since all changes
to the lilo.conf file must be processed by lilo before you reboot in
order to take effect.
