<P>
We used TCP/IP as the communication
protocol because it is also common, well supported and 
independent of physical media.  Although modems are used in
the MHCID system today, we anticipate other media in the future.
<P>
In order to secure the database communications, we needed an
efficient, robust and <EM>proven</EM> encryption protocol.  Developing
encryption algorithms and secure protocols is a complex task,
fraught with danger.  Rather than invent our own, it was preferable
to use something ``tried and true.''  SSL, developed by Netscape,
is just such a protocol.  It can use public-key cryptography
to authenticate the server and to exchange a secret session key
in a secure fashion.
<P>
Fortunately, an efficient implementation of
SSL is available on the Internet, courtesy the hard work of
Eric Young and Tim Hudson - <A NAME="tex2html7" HREF="ftp://psych.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL">SSLeay</A>.
<P>
We developed our own DBMS protocol using a simple syntax,
on top of SSL sockets.  A set of three-letter commands was defined,
which supports everything from logging in, to multi-record read and
write operations.  The client sends commands to the server,
and the server replies with any relevant data, plus a status code.
The protocol was designed to be terse, simple and to support
every operation required by our client software in a single
operation.
<P>
Some examples of how the protocol speeds up the client/server
interaction are:
<UL>
<LI> The client can open every table it needs for a given operation with
   one command.
<LI> The client GUI frequently needs to validate a data entry field.  
   Only one command is needed to check whether ``value X appears in
   column Y in some row of table Z.''
<LI> The client can read many records from one or more related tables on
   the server with a single command.
