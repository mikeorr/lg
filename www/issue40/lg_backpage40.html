<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Bob Sparks</H4>
Bob is a computer consultant working in the homelessness 
and housing areas. He works with Linux and "other" OSs. He likes Linux because 
it is a better OS, and because it is budget friendly for shallow pocketed
non-profits. His hobbies include: reading, writing, wife, kids, &amp; grandkids.
He can be reached at  bobnhlinux@aol.com.

Dan is a technical instructor and the training manager for a technology
training company located in central New Hampshire. He has been working with the Internet

two-and-a-half years working with Windows NT. He is both a Microsoft Certified System
Engineer and Microsoft Certified Trainer and has also written a book for QUE on one of the
MCSE certification exams. He is anxiously awaiting the day when he can start teaching
Linux certification classes.

Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
I decided to put out an EXTRA issue this month for three reasons:
<ul>
<li>I get so much mail asking for help, I hate to make them wait so long
before it gets posted. I know as soon as I post they get answers to their
questions. You guys are so generous with your time and expertise.
<li>I didn't want to wait any longer to put the Corel Conference article up.
<li>Third, the article by Bob Sparks was actually supposed to be in issue 38,
but I inadvertently left it out of the Table of Contents. My apologies to
Bob.
</ul>
At any rate, I've thought it would be nice to have an abbreviated mid-month
issue for some time, so here it is. Enjoy!
<P> 
Have fun!
