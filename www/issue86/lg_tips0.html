The often quoted segment from the lilo readme is sort of backwards in both

I have installed RH's 8.0.  I'll have to admit I'm in Windows at the moment.

<P>
'sokay, that's fixable :&gt;  Or if you get really tricky you can convince
a good copy of <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A> to use the Windows setup, and run mswin apps even
when you are in Linux.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Also the e-mail program that came with 8.0 that isn't connected to a
browser retrieved my mail, but wouldn't, couldn't send my mail.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
That's probably:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Fetching mail from another serv explicitly (via POP3) works.  (This is
common.  Your ISP did all the work setting up and keeping that POP
server, your mailer just visits it once in a while.)
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
Sending mail outbound, no SMTP server is found to talk to.  (There are
a few browsers which will "speak SMTP" on their own, but they are not
very good mailers on the average, for other reasons.)
</P>
<P>
Adding an SMTP server to your setup is usually quite easy;  look for an
RPM package named any one of sendmail, qmail, or postfix.  (but you only
want one of them.)
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">and I forgot to mention that if your ISP actually gives you the explicit
address of an SMTP server to use, say, mail.isp.example.com, then you
could try telling that to your mailer, rather than worrying about
setting up your own.

<P><STRONG>
You lost me on the KPPP Tool and Linux.  Linux is an OS, right?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Indeed.  Thus the term "Linux Answer Gang", you see.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Now, where did I get your address?  I asked some friends about how to
get my telephone to operate through the PC.  One person sent me a
forward with "The Answer Guy" and the address.  I believe it to have
been a page from an old site that contained pertinent information, but
not the site itself.  Does this help?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Not nearly as much as it would if you inquired with that person and
tracked down the "old site" for us.  That would be much appreciated, as
we continue to be deluged with misdirected non-Linux queries.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
I am self-taught, so do not confuse me with high-altitude techtalk,
just the facts.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Self-taught was at one time the only way to learn Linux, back when many
of us got started with it, so we sympathise, and now attempt to assist
others while, as we say, "Making Linux just a little more fun".
</P>
<P><STRONG>
What is my best approach for learning a program language?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Well, first you'd have to install a Linux distribution, of course.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Strictly speaking, most of these languages are available for Windows
too, but some of the mswin implementations may be less than perfectly
portable, or the documentation may suggest non-portable over portable
coding strategies.  Go for dual booting, perhaps.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
You'll find that it comes with an amazing variety of programming
language development kits, from C, C++, and Python through tk/tcl,
Java, Lisp, and heavens knows what else.  I personally maintain a list
of Integrated Development Environment software for Linux, here:
<A HREF="http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/#idedev"
	>http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/#idedev</A> .  As you'll see, the list has
grown to pass 100 entries.
</P>
<P>
How you would proceed from there would depend on which type of
programming language you'd like to use, and what you want to do with it.
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
Rick Moen

Is it possible for me to run Routing Protocols(ospf,BGP,rip) on my

network (including subnetwork ip pool)ip pool range of my ISP.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Look for GNU Zebra: <A HREF="http://www.zebra.org"
	>http://www.zebra.org</A>
It's considered to be the best available package for Linux, and
has (I'm told) syntax that's reasonably similar to Cisco's IOS.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[someone else in the Gang expands] 
Of course you can!  This is not your grandpa's operating system, here.
OSPF v. 2 and BGP4/4+ are both supported by either the gated daemon or
the GNU zebra daemon, both of which should be standard on your Linux
distribution.  Zebra can also do pretty much every variety of RIP (v.1,
v.2, and RIPng).  The standard old routed (prounounced "route-dee")
daemon can do RIPv1, and gated can do RIPv2.  (gated will also do EGP,
thrown into the bargain.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for replying. But what I wanted exactly to know is that
should I need any kind of details from the ISP (like Router ip,ASN...)
or any permission from the ISP for my LINUX Router to have a OSPF
session with
the ISP Router.

Let me guess, you're using the Konqueor 3.0 web browser, right?  Konq is

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I'm not able to verify this; it could just be the same problem as in
Konqueror 2.x, where the SSL support is a seperate package

visits non-encrypted URLs if you don't have that package installed.
Of course it doesn't bother to <EM>say</EM> so... an error message like

Galeon and Mozilla will work, but you need to d/l the Personal Security

Until I find an updated Konq or install PSM, I use an old version of

I've been looking around and can't find the info I need. How do I
configure Linux to run headless with a terminal connected to a serial
port?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Not quite headless, with a serial terminal connected.  I choose to
call the condition "nearly headless", after the phantom named
"Nearly Headless Nick" in the Harry Potter series.
</P>
<P>
Take a look at:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Documentation/serial-console.txt
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
in the kernel source.  This won't get you quite everything you'd
get from a console connected.  In particular, you don't have access
to the BIOS.  But if you can get past that, you're pretty much
there.  You can even tell LILO to use the serial port, as described
in the documentation file.  No doubt there's also a GRUB option
for serial console, if that's the boot loader you're using.
</P>
<P>
As I understand it, there's at least one card which will even
make the BIOS available via a serial port.

Though you never mentioned what your video card was, I will respond since I
was having a similar problem with Mandrake Linux 9.0 on my home-built
machine. I was getting lockups all the time and yet I could ssh into the box
from another machine and see that everything behind the scenes was still
running fine. Just X froze, but it also meant that I could not kill it with
CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE. I happened to have an ATI Xpert 2000 video card (Rage
128 chipset). The ONE item that fixed it was that the card does not seem to
handle DRI properly. I commented out the line in my XF86Config file that
said: load "dri", restarted X and I never saw the problem again. Perhaps
your problem is similar.

<P><STRONG>
after using linux for several years now on i-586 I tried to install it
on my imac-g4.  the problem: I do not get X to run, because of my
NVIDIA GeForce4 MX.  I am using debian woody for ppc and don't find
any hints in the net.  can anybody send me a working XF86Config for
XFree 4.1.0 or any other help.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It looks like you'll need XFree86 4.2.0 or later, and will have to use
the "vesa" driver (not the "nv" driver) in 16-bit mode, which is the
only one supported thus far.
</P>
<P>
As you may know, these things do tend to happen with newly introduced
video chipsets, and Nvidia have unfortunately been notably uncooperative
with the XFree86 Project.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">That they didn't buy into the XFCom release sequence (compatible
binaries, source eventually committed to the open source X code tree) and
want to roll their own we can understand; but they have to keep up with
the Xfree86 codebase or it makes them look slow.  And act slow, if one has
to back down to the generic servers in order to work...

I would like to know what linux program to get that I could use to repartition
a hard drive without going through setup.

If you want to repartition without losing data, GNU Parted is a great
tool. Details at:

You can also use fdisk or diskdruid but both will destroy the data after
repartitioning. These two should be installed by default in most of the
distributions.

<BR>Question by  (dhar_mca from jntu.net)

<P><STRONG>
Friends,
Last week I posed a question for booting with 3 OSes. Thank U.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Here I again partitioned ... [lots of stuff about prepared system]
I am trying boot from boot
disk. It is coming upto "localhost login:" after which GUI screen be
displayed. It displays the localhost login: prompt for a second or a half
and then hangs. I thought its a problem with monitor sync values. Mine was
samsung's samtron 56V model. But in the list specified - no exact match
for it. So I opted for the default given (unprobed type)and modified the
sync values with the ones given in my monitor manual. (My friends who have
already loaded windows, have not even changed the sync values). One of my
friend got the same problem. But his system didn't hang but it flashes
between blank screen and the text based localhost prompt.
</STRONG></P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">His "chooser" - the GUI login, keeps crashing but the system keeps
trying to put it back up.  kdm, gdm, xdm, one of those dm thingies.

<P><STRONG>
He was able to
login. He logged into it with root and modified the Xconfigurator and now
works fine.

Plz assist me.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">If you're hung too hard for that to work, use the boot loader to put
yourself in sincgle user mode, then fix the boot runlevel (/etc/inittab
default entry) to stay in text mode.  For Red Hat flavors that's
runlevel 3.  Set it back when you'r sure it's fixed, use startx as a
user to run X explicitly while experimenting.

I used to have an IBM Aptiva system that had in the bundle a switchboard
supplied by Phoenix.
I now have an hp pavilion 7850.  It has a modem and phone dialer, but I
cannot use the telephone through my computer as before.
Is there some way to connect to my telephone line for normal surface
telephone lines?  What would I need to do?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ashwin] 
If you're using Linux, have you tried connecting using the KPPP tool?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
I'm not sure, but if he means that his computer used to handle the voice
lines in his office (and yes, there are such things, which have some
cute GUI app to configure them) ... then he may want to play with the
program Asterisk, and maybe the hardware "LineJack" or "PhoneJack" by
Quicknet, which are telephony cards you add to a computer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If he just means that his computer needs to reach the internet, then
it's true we have a bunch of dialer-helpers (KPPP is one of the better
ones; xisp and a few others are out there) ... but he will still need
to know some basic things like his ISP's phone number, the username
he was assigned, and maybe some connection features like whether they
use PAP or CHAP to identify him.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are all things which his ISP can tell him better than we could.

<P><STRONG>
Is it possible to install Linux on
a thumb drive(size 120 MB).
Or Can I copy selected files from my normal
linux installation(RH 7.2 on a 40 GB hard disk)
and make the thumb drive bootable independently.
What is the best way to do this?
I thought of copying files from my
normal linux installation.But i am in doubt whether
i can boot this drive in this way.
Looking forward to your suggestions.

<blockquote><font color="#000066">You'll need to make sure your kernel has builtin USB, and that your
machine is capable of considering it a boot device.  If it can't
directly, then you may have to carry a floppy with you to go with
it.  Yeah, it's bulky, but ...
