Knowing there are at least a couple of Heinlein readers here, some of
you might be interested in this Slashdot story:
<a href="http://entertainment.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/09/10/0216202&amp;from=rss">http://entertainment.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/09/10/0216202&amp;from=rss</a>
(pointing to this:
<a href="http://kk.org/ct2/2008/09/heinleins-fan-mail-solution.php">http://kk.org/ct2/2008/09/heinleins-fan-mail-solution.php</a>)
</p>

<p>
"In the days before the internet, Heinlein's solution was to create a
list of frequently asked questions, answer them, and remove the
questions. Then he, or rather his wife Ginny, checked off the
appropriate answer(s) and mailed it back. Some of the entries in
Heinlein's answer sheet are quite illuminating and amusing. Our
personal favorite: 'You say that you have enjoyed my stories for
years. Why did you wait until you disliked one story before writing to
me?'"

Speaking of technology, did you know that blogging is much older than
the Internet?

Well, on the subject of technology, I decided to try the jpg out with
the two open source OCR engines. It was a good test image, because
both open source engines currently lack layout management.

Care of Mr. Lurton Blassingame
60 East 42nd Street, Suite 1131
New York, N.'{. 10017
Dear s1r/Madam/Ma./mea
An ever·increas1.ng flood of mail forced me to choose between writing letters
and writing fiction. But I read each letter sent to me and check its answer.
( ) Thanks for your kind words. You have made my day hrxghcer.
( ) You say that you have enjoyed my atariea for years. Why did you wan mtu
you disllked one story before writing to me'!
( ) Renshaw: Saturday Evming Post, You're Not As Smart As You Could Be, April
17**. 24**, and May 1st, 1948.
( ) Essay Mental Telegraphy, Mark Twain's Works, Harper &amp; Brothers
( ) D0n't aehd books to be autographed; we many have failed me reaeh me.
Registering or insuring is no answer; the post office is s 3D—mile round trip.
( ) Story ideas come from everywhere and anything &amp; writers are sel!-taught.
The book WRITER'S MARKET tells how to prepare manuscripts A: lists markets.
( ) My agent handles all business; your letter has been sent to him.
( ) I don't discuss my colleagues' works or my own. A novelist writes from
many viewpoints; opinions expressed even by a firstpperson character are not
necessarily those of the author. Fictlon is sold as entertainment, not as fact.
( ) Tne item you want is herewith/not available/: Ask your reference librarian.
( ) I don't sell books. All my books are Ln print &amp; can be bought or ordered
at any bookstore or directly from publishers. Bookstores have
"in·print" lists. . .
( ) 1 get 4 dr 5 or more requests each week for help 1h class aaaighmehta, tem
papers, theses, or dissertations. I can't cope with so many J, have quit trying.
( ) It is not just for a student's grade to depend on the willlngness
or capacity
of a stranger to help him with his homework. I am ready to discuss this with
your teacher, principal, or school board.
( ) Science fiction: stories that would cease to exist if elements involving
science or technology were omitted. For hill discussion see my lecture in
THE SCIHVCE FICTION NOVEL, Adve*nt:Publishers, Chicago.
( ) VIho's Who Ln America; Encyclopaedia Britannica 1974; IN SEARCH OF WONDER,
chapter 7, Damon Knight, Advent:Publishers; SEEKERS OF TOMORROW, chapter 11,
Sam Moskowitz, World Publishing Company; Current Biography magazine; reference
books about authors. I don't discuss private life, politics, religion,
philosophy
( ) Your question: Yes/No/No comment/NY publishers announce new works/
( ) Please do not write to me again.
( &gt; Thanks rm- the stamped a addressed e¤ve1¤pe—a rare courtesy eaday.
( ) Pressure ar work causes me to avoid interviews, queauahhaxrea, rama e
television appearances, public speaking.
( ) For legal reaaaha 1 dd hat read unpublished rahuaeupca.
( ) D0n't plan to call at our home; we work very long hours every day
of the year.
( ) Your letter was most welcome!—loaded with friendliness and with no requests
or demands, You suggested that no answer was expected but I must tell you how
much it pleased me. I wish you calm seas, following winds, and a happy voyage

Cuneiform is at a much earlier stage of its open source life, and I
think it would be more fair to try it with Russian, but tesseract
looks pretty good.
