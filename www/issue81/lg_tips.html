<P>
Hi,
</P>
<P>
Regarding Bill Parks question on the June issue, as to how to play
CD audio <EM>without</EM> the analog cable usually connecting CD-ROMs to
audio cards, a similar situation happens if you have one of the latest
iBooks. There is no way to tweak the sound driver to do what he wants,
but XMMS can be of help. He should try using the "CD Audio Player"
Input Plugin (select it via Preferences -&gt; Audio I/O Plugins) and
configure it accordingly, say have <TT>/dev/hdc</TT> (the "real" CD-ROM device,
not <TT>/dev/cdrom</TT> which is usually a symlink) and <TT>/cdrom.</TT> Then, put the
audio CD, and open a "Playlist" in XMMS but instead of selecting a File,
select the <TT>/cdrom</TT> directory; he'll see the audio tracks there and be
able to play and listen to them.
</P>
<P>
That's right, the system will be doing CDDA extraction from the CD
into XMMS, which then plays it through OSS/ESD/ARTS. Ugly, but works.
</P>

<P>
Hello. I'm trying to write a very simple C program
that needs to attend the user input without blocking a
loop. I have porgrammed many time on pascal, and there
the code will be something like:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>begin
  while not keypressed
    writeln('hello! i'm still alive');
end.
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
well... when i use C code i try the getchar function,
but it waits until a key is pressed blocking the
program.
</P>
<P>
How can i know if there is a key into the buffer
without blocking the execution of my programs?
</P>
<P>
Thanks in advance

Well, you can, but it's not exactly trivial, and how you do it depends
on which environment you're coding: raw-C for the glass-tty,
curses/termcap, X, <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>, Gnome, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is more generic C stuff than Linux stuff; I'd recommend you look
into books like The Unix Programming Environment, by (I think)
Kernighan and Pike, and the Stevens books.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[pradeep] 
As the other poster mentioned, it depends on where you want this
behaviour. Assuming that you want to do this on a console, ncurses is a
great library to use. It gives you the right abstraction.

<P>
Recently one of the gang mentioned renaming an rpm file to a much
higher version number before running alien, so that the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> package
system would not want to overwrite the result.
</P>
<P>
The key to doing that "the right way" is a value that the Debian
maintaineers call the epoch.
</P>
<P>
Of course people are used to seeing package versions like 1.2 or even
1.4.3p1.
</P>
<P>
In the Debian world that might be 1.4.3p1-2 meaning that this is the
second time the Debian maintainer had to build the same version.
Probably he or she has patches in it.
</P>
<P>
But to handle programs whose version numbers don't go constantly up
like time goes forward ... a certain typesetting package comes to
mind ...
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Must have been some other package.  According to its FAQ, TeX's version
number asymptotically approaches pi, growing digits along the way.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
... they invented an epoch.  epochs start at the invisible "1"
and go up to 99.
</P>
<P>
So a version:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>        99:1.4.3p1-local
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Would be 98 epochs ahead of a mere:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>        1.4.3p1-12
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
and the same number of epochs ahead of:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>        2.1.12-1
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
If you want your package and the Debian one to live together in
harmony, then rename yours to something before the version number that
does not overlap:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>        mtools4flash-3.9.7-1fp
<br>        mtools-3.9.7-2
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
Of course that's safest if the files inside their file list don't
overlap either!
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#1F1F1F">That was the problem, of course;  the filesets were exactly the same.
 -- Ben</font></blockquote>
<P>
Using either of these methods is safer than setting a hold on the
package, which is sometimes recommended, but which I've seen fail before.
</P>

<P><STRONG>
g++ -lcrypt server.c
Error: 'crypt' undefined
</STRONG></P>
<P>
The order of the arguments matter. You should try:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>g++ server.c -lcrypt
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
The linker links from left to right and is a bit dumb.
After compiling server.c, the crypt call is undefined. Then libcrypt.a
is tried, and crypt is defined in there. So it will be resolved.
</P>
<P>
In your case, libcrypt.a doesn't match any undefined symbols (YET!), so
it is not linked into the executable. Then server.o is linked, and that
has an unresolved symbol (crypt). The linker isn't smart enough to go
back to libcrypt.a.
</P>
<P>
The answerer of the questions talks about the name mangling. If you mix
C and C++ code, you have to tell the compiler what is C. That is usually
done by doing:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>extern "C" void foo(int);
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
This tells the compiler that function foo takes an int, returns nothing
and is a C function. But all standard libraries already do that for you,
so it's very safe to call <TT> crypt()</TT> from C++ code.
</P>
<P>

<P><STRONG>
I've mainly been connecting to the internet using diald, but I've noticed
that I'm only getting about 3.5 KBps , whereas on W98 I get about 5KBps. A
little experimentation shows that dialling with kppp gives about 5KBps as
well.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
kppp seems to use an initialisation string of ATM1L1, but changing MODEM_INIT
to "ATM1L1" in <TT>/etc/diald/connect</TT>, didn't improve the performance.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
MODEM_INIT started out as "ATZ&amp;C1&amp;D2%C0". I changed "%C0" to "%C3" to ensure
that compression was enabled, but this made no difference. I can't find an
option in diald to log exactly what's sent to the modem and I can't see any
conflicting options in the configuration for pppd.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any suggestions for how to track down why kppp gets better performance than
diald would be appreciated.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The modem is an MRI 56K internal modem.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Check the port speeds.  It's likely that diald is using a port speed of
28.8KBps or 56KBps.  Try to have something well above the actual speed of the
modem, as the data coming from the modem may be substantially higher in
volume than the actual modem's capability (due to hardware compression).
</P>
<P>
The only exception to this is with a USR 56k Faxmodem I have when used with
WvDial; it must be at 56k, and I don't know why.  If the computer port speed
is set higher than that, what comes across the line from the modem seems to
be escaped characters of some sort, along the lines of

I'd let you know about this problem in case you have it.

<P>
It is simpler to use Midnight Commander. Click on the rpm file like you
would a directory and transverse the rpm as you would a branch of the
directory tree. Locate the file or files and copy them to an actual
directory with the copy button. Simple and effective!

I've found that some mc versions changed the rpm handling behavior.  I had
grown quite accustomed to viewing rpm contents and copying parts via mc,
then after installing <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> 7.1 on my laptop, was no longer able to view
more than a partial list of the files in the rpm; specifically the rpm
headers (description, etc.).  I was able to correct the problem finding
the mc scripts used for rpm handling, and changing one to agree with a
previous mc version script.

One other point is that for very large rpm files (over 2 or 3 MB), the
process can be very slow.  When dealing with rpm files containing large
tar balls of source code, I usually just "install" the rpm, which copies
the desired file to <TT>/usr/src/packages/SOURCES.</TT>

<h4 align="center"><br>Watching multiple log files at once
</h4>
<P>
Recent versions of the GNU tail command let you tail multiple files
with the same command. Combined with the -f option, you can watch
multiple log files. For example:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>   tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log /var/log/httpd/error_log
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
will monitor the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> access and error logs.

<h4 align="center"><br>Switching to Maildir format mailboxes
</h4>
<P>
If you're moving from old-style mailboxes to Maildir directories for
your mail, you can force Mutt to create Maildir directories by default
with:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>   :set mbox_type=Maildir
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
in your .muttrc file.
</P>
<P>
To get Procmail to deliver to directories as Maildir and not MH
folders, put a <TT>/</TT> after the directory name in your recipes, like this:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br># Dump mail from Microsoft viruses into a trash Maildir
<br>:0 Bf
<br>* Content-Type: application/octet-stream;
<br>trash/
</font></code></blockquote>

<h4 align="center"><br>Running screen-oriented programs directly
</h4>
<P>
To run a screen-based program such as top remotely with one ssh
command, use the -t (terminal) option to ssh, like this:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>   ssh -t myserver top
</font></code></blockquote>
<HR width="10%" align="center">
<h4 align="center"><br>Your running processes
</h4>
<P>
For an easy-to-understand, compact view of what's running on your
system now, try the pstree command. A handy option is -u, which shows
the name of the user running each process. Option -p shows the process
ID, so if you want to memorize only one option combination, try:
</P>

<blockquote><code><font color="#000033"><br>   pstree -pu
</font></code></blockquote>
<P>
(No pun intended.)
</P>
<P>
pstree is a good way to make sure that privilege separation is working
in your upgraded ssh install--you did upgrade sshd, didn't you?
