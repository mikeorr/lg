<center> <H2>DOSEMU & MIDI: A User's Report</H2> <H4>By Dave Phillips,
<a href="mailto:dlphilp@bright.net">dlphilp@bright.net</a></H4> </center>
<P><HR><P>
<BASE="/root/htmlstuff/var/dp_dosemu.html"></a> <p> First, the
necessary version info: <ul> <li>Linux kernel 2.0.29 <li>dosemu
0.66.1 <li>Sound Driver 3.5.4 </ul> And then there's the hardware:
<ul> <li>AMD 486/120 <li>MediaVision Pro Audio Spectrum 16 (PAS16)
soundcard w. MIDI interface adapter <li>Music Quest MQX32M
MIDI interface <li>two Yamaha TX802 synthesizers </ul> <p> <a
href="http://www.ednet.ns.ca/~macleajb/dosemu.html">dosemu</a>
 is an MS-DOS emulator for Linux. The <a
href="http://lexington.lasermoon.co.uk/uncompressed.shtml/texinfo/dosemu_1.html">on-line
manual</a> describes it as <blockquote>"...a user-level program which uses
certain special features of the Linux kernel and the 80386 processor
to run MS-DOS in what we in the biz call a DOS box. The DOS box, a
combination of hardware and software trickery, has these capabilities:
<ul> <li>    the ability to virtualize all input/output and processor
control instructions <li>    the ability to support the word size and
addressing modes of the iAPX86 processor family's real mode, while
still running within the full protected mode environment <li>    the
ability to trap all DOS and BIOS system calls and emulate such calls
as are necessary for proper operation and good performance <li>    the
ability to simulate a hardware environment over which DOS programs are
accustomed to having control.  <li>    the ability to provide MS-DOS
services through native Linux services; for example, dosemu can provide
a virtual hard disk drive which is actually a Linux directory hierarchy.
</ul> The hardware component of the DOS box is the 80386's virtual-8086
mode, the real mode capability described above. The software component
is dosemu."</blockquote> <p> I installed version 0.66.1 because I read
that it supported MIDI, and I was curious to find whether I would be
able to run my favorite DOS MIDI sequencer, Sequencer Plus Gold from
<a href="http://www.voyetra.com">Voyetra</a>. Installation proceeded
successfully, and after some initial fumbling (and a lot of help from
the Linux newsgroups), I was running some DOS programs under Linux.  <p>
However, the MIDI implementation eluded me. I followed the directions
given in the dosemu package: they are simple enough, basically setting
up a link to /dev/sequencer. But since Sequencer Plus requires a Voyetra
API driver, I ran into trouble: the VAPI drivers wouldn't load.  <p> I
tried to use the VAPIMV (Voyetra API for Media Vision) drivers, but they
complained that MVSOUND.SYS wasn't loaded. These drivers are specific
to the PAS16 soundcard, so I was puzzled that they couldn't detect
MVSOUND.SYS (which was indeed successfully loaded by config.sys). I
also tried using the SAPI drivers, Voyetra's API for the SoundBlaster:
the PAS16 has a SB emulation mode which I had enabled in MVSOUND.SYS,
but those drivers wouldn't load, again complaining that MVSOUND.SYS
wasn't installed. VAPIMQX, the driver for the MQX32M, refused to
recognize any hardware but a true MQX. Checking the Linux sound driver
status with 'cat/dev/sndstat' reported my MQX as installed, but complete
support for the sound driver (OSS/Free) has yet to be added to dosemu.
<p> Since MVSOUND.SYS was indeed installed (I checked it in dosemu
using MSD, the Microsoft Diagnostics program), and since the MIDI
interface on the soundcard was activated, I began to wonder whether that
interface could be used. I tested the DOS MIDI programming environment
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/music/ravel">RAVEL</a>, which is
"hardwired" internally to only an MPU-401 MIDI interface: to my surprise
and satisfaction, the soundcard's MIDI interface worked, and I now had a
DOS MIDI program working under Linux.<p> Following that line of action,
I figured that the Voyetra native MPU driver just might load. I tried
VAPIMPU: it failed, saying it couldn't find the interrupt. I added the
command-line flag /IRQ:7 and the driver loaded. I now had a Voyetra MIDI
interface device driver loaded, but would Sequencer Plus Gold run ?
<p> Not only does Sequencer Plus run, I am also able to use Voyetra's
Sideman D/TX patch editor/librarian for my TX802s. And I can run RAVEL,
adding a wonderful MIDI programming language to my Linux music & sound
arsenal.  <p> All is not perfect: RAVEL suffers the occasional stuck
note, and the timing will burp while running Seq+ in xdos, particularly
when the mouse is moved. The mouse is problematic with Seq+ in xdos
anyway, sometimes locking cursor movement. Since my configuration
for the dosemu console mode doesn't support the mouse, that problem
doesn't arise there. Switching to another console is possible; this is
especially useful if and when dosemu crashes. Also, programs using VGA
"high" graphics will crash, but I must admit that I have barely begun to
tweak the video subsystem for dosemu. It may eventually be possible to
run Sound Globs, Drummer, and perhaps even M/pc, but for now it seems
that only the most straightforward DOS MIDI programs will load and
run without major problems.  <p> And there is a much greater problem:
only version 1.26 of the VAPIMPU driver appears to work properly. A more
recent version (1.51) will not load, even with the address and interrupt
specified at the command-line. However, Rutger Nijlunsing has mentioned
that he is working on an OSS/Free driver for dosemu which would likely
permit full use of my MQX interface card. When that arrives I may be able
to utilize advanced features of Seq+ such as multiport MIDI (for 32 MIDI
channels) and SMPTE time-code.  <p> [Since writing the above text, I have
tweaked /etc/dosemu.conf for better performance in both X and console
modes. Setting <b>hogthreshold 0</b>seems to improve playback stability. I
have yet to fix the problem with the mouse in xdos, but it isn't much of
a real problem.  <p> Linux is free, dosemu is free, RAVEL is free. My
DOS MIDI software can't be run in a DOS box under Win95 with my hardware:
it <i>can</i>be done, but I'd have to buy another soundcard. Linux will run
its DOS emulator, with MIDI and sound support, from an X window or from a
virtual console (I have six to choose from). If I want to run Sequencer
Plus in DOS itself, I have to either drop out of Win95 altogether
(DOS mode) or not boot into Win95 at all. With Win95 I get one or the
other; with Linux, I get the best of all possible worlds.  <p><hr><p>
