Ok, that clarifies why you want to make sure it's <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> that you run.
The instructor wants it?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
They don't have their own live-CD as far as I can tell, but somebody
put some extra effort into basing one off of a Red hat 7.3 distro -
perhaps that will be close enough.  Or maybe the live flavor isn't
handy because RH just released 9, and haven't finished up a demo disk
yet.  Who knows.  Anyways, you can try this one:
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/emergencycd2"
	>http://sourceforge.net/projects/emergencycd2</A>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you really just need a Linux of some sort and your instructor was
thinking of RedHat because it's the only distro he knows, perhaps you'd
like one of the flavors which can install into your Windows disk space
without repartitioning.  Look at <A HREF="http://old.lwn.net/Distributions"
	>http://old.lwn.net/Distributions</A>
under the heading "DOS/Windows install".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Or, it can be noted that while RedHat really soaks up the disk space on
older hardware, is someone has a paperweight computer around, you could
boot it off of one of the many floppy based distros easily.  Nearly all
Linux flavors have similar networking abilities, though only the fancier
ones will have cool stuff like samba support.

The company "VMware" makes a reasonably good virtual machine product.
I haven't kept track of whether they can run in winXP as the host yet
but it seems likely.  'Course they sell their host for Linux, as well,
and you would be able to host MSwin or many other OS' under that.  It
may interfere with MS' nefarious plans for your computer a little, but
it's really great for rolling back the damage from any virii that come
after you.  They do have a trial edition, at least, so I guess that
counts as shareware:

</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
...Brief pause while I check whether winXP has joined their extensive
list of OS' that can be successfully hosted this way.  My own experience
shows that win98 can be hosted just fine - but it runs a little slower
under this emulation, than the apps themselves do under <A HREF="http://www.winehq.com/">WINE</A>'s direct
binary support for MSwin apps.  Not that this is perfect mind you, but
it's gotten pretty damn good, and there's a handful of commercial vendors
helping give WINE a booster shot if you need that.

It is not free ( costs about $300 ) but a 30 day fully working demo is availble.
It emulates a harddisk, networkcard, SVGA card, in short a whole PC.
But unlike BOCHS it does not emulate the CPU.

At least last time I looked at it 'twas a bit better at hosting Linux than
SoftWindows, its competitor, was.  Heh, back in our own issue 32 someone
asked The Answer Guy if there was a Linux port of it.  Well, it looks
like Insignia went and sold that off to somebody else, so if someone out
there with a PowerMac wants RealPC look for the current vendor:

Microsoft is in the process of purchasing either Connectix, or at least
its virtual machine stuff.  I hope they don't screw up a decent product.
It did mention one more commercial competitor though, SW-soft.  Their
"Virtuozzo" looks like it's on way too grand a scale for what you need

Normally I'd leave you to your own homework there, but I'm curious if
anything new has cropped up that would let the MSwin-bound run Linux.
Unfortunately surfing their site has become more painful than it used
to be;  I seem to recall being able to find small product blurbs, on
the order of the paragraph or two found at freshmeat for projects listed
there.  Even one-liners would have been nice. I mourn the demise of more
pleasant interfaces like the "program manager" style icon map that
winfiles.com used to have before zdnet inhaled them.  Hitting up Google
for the "windows virtual download" idea finds me an easier to use
shareware trove - maybe you'll find it handy.  I didn't find more
virtual machines there, but I stopped looking after awhile.  At least
this one's search widget looks in the descriptions as well as titles:

Linux, of course, is free if you want to spend some time downloading it,
or pretty darn cheap if you choose the right place to buy your ISOs and
don't need a manual.  So perhaps we can look at virtual-machine projects

Maybe some of the free and opensource projects listed on <A HREF="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</A> will
work on MSwin environments too?  Well, what the heck, can't hurt to
look.  Both this and a search on TUCOWS for "virtual machine" are likely

The analogous project for the PC-compatible platform is currently named
Plex86, used to be called FreeMWare.  Of course GNU's savannah project is
roughly similar to SourceForge, so if a project doesn't wanna make it easy
to find their FAQ or other docs, you'll have to thrash around on your own.

The folks there recommend "bochs" for emulating a 32-bit PC on non-PC
hardware.  (I know, they haven't made Windows for non-PC hardware in

It seems likely that it would be much easier to set yourself up with a
runs-from-CD setup, if you want it in RAM simply 'cuz you don't want to
ruin a local hard disk while experimenting a little.  Many Linux vendors
offer "live CD" editions of their stuff to whet your whistle.  I can't
blame you for asking us, since my own quick glance around their website
doesn't seem to reveal Red Hat as one of them.

Once or twice, just to make sure it can be done, I dig out a source
tarball from the vanished world of 1992 Linux, and see if it can be

11 years of compatibility is pretty good, esecially given that the OS

I had to slow him down enough to say that I'd heard of it so I just

If/When the next big open source OS

everything.), we really don't have to worry about supporting our old Linux

It's possible that the next major non-UNIX OS to
take a look at would be EROS.  It has a vitally different security model
from that of UNIX - a true capabilities system, of which the "privs" in
the latest linux kernels are a mere shot in the right direction, and
where virtual spaces are part of the basic environment.

I'm hoping, that as Microsoft's market share slips, they'll actually have to
make their OS compatible with other OSes. Windows 2000 uses Kerberos for
network security. Of course, they had to add their own extensions to it, but

Accordingly, my stock answer to <em> _that</em> question follows, and you may be
able to use some of its suggestions despite your
through-the-looking-glass perspective on the problem.  E.g., you could
use the Win32 version of VMware, running RH9 within its virtual session.

Thank you all for your answers to my question. I actually do
appreciate the time most of you took to give me alot of information. To
answer some of your questions: Yes I do have an expensive machine. I've
an 80GB HDD partitioned NTFS so, although I have the space, I'm not
going to repartition to install LINUX nor buy another HDD. I've 512MB of
RDRAM with 566MHZ FSB &amp; a 2.27GHz P4. (Yes, I'm a hardware geek). I can
understand your pro LINUX position but frankly, hardening the security
of a server from the command line is difficult, but you can't beat free,
now can you?

Anyway heartfelt thanks for your time and effort.
