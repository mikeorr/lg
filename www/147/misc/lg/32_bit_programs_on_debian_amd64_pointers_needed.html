I've had a badly configured Debian on a Core2 Duo system for a while and I am 
starting again from scratch. The area where I am having trouble finding 
guidance is support for 32 bit programs and plugins on the AMD64 
architecture. 
</p>

<p>
I have found various recipes for getting specific programs working. Many of 
them appear to involve maintaining a separate i386 architecture installation 
in addition to the main AMD64 installation. 
</p>

<p>
I am not keen on on maintaining 2 installations, nor am I keen on piecemeal 
solutions for each 32 bit program I may need to run. Can anybody point me to 
a good guide on the issues involved and/or a general solution to the problem 
of running 32 bit code on AMD64 debian?

I run Debian AMD64 on two workstations, and I know this problem.

<p>
Having another Debian IA32 installed via debootstrap and chroot is
easier than maintaining additionally IA32 libraries on the system.

<p>
I took some advice from Gentoo's AMD64 HOWTO
(<a href="http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_AMD_64">http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_AMD_64</a>). Having some 32-bit libraries
around helps, and I am able to run Opera, Doom 3, Neverwinter Nights,
Enemy Territory, Adobe Acrobat Reader and some more applications on my
AMD64 boxes. Not all of them are typical office programs though. ;)
