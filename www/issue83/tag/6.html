Dear answer gang:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BLOCKQuote>
Sometimes when I mount a CD, mount hangs. ps shows it is
in an "uninterruptible sleep", and kill won't kill it. As a
result, I can not access my CD drive until I restart my computer.
</BLOCKQuote></STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is there a way to kill a process in uninterruptible sleep?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks!

What I usually do is to kill the parent process, which is usually a bash
shell.  In many <TT>/</TT> most cases this allows killing of the errant process.
However, you may run into the situation where the driver or a port is
hung.  In those cases, you may have no choice but to reboot.

Sometimes the parent process is apt-get. I kill it, but the spawned
mount remains in state "D" and I can not kill it.

Have you tried "kill -9"? This is not a good thing to do by default. but
if you've already tried a plain "kill" (which issues a "-15"), that's
what's left. See "man kill" for more details.

Nope, they won't.  They only work on processes sleeping above priority
PZERO (if I remember the terminology correctly).  The problem your
having is almost certainly coming from a process sleeping <EM>below</EM> PZERO
-- which is almost always a device driver with either bad hardware, or
a bug.

Yep, those are the correct terms; however, I believe that the only
processes below PZERO are zombies. I think what happens with fast
devices is simply a loop that's too "tight" to break into, fast and
straight to hardware without any intervening layers that would allow a
signal to "break in".

I suppose the mount(2) syscall is having a problem... but shouldn't I
be able to interrupt a system call in some way?

A system call, yes.  But not necessarily inside a driver call.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Tape drives are famous for this... they seem to be implemented as fast
devices, even though they manifestly are not.

And that is the one situation that comes to mind where I experienced the
problem - using a SCSI tape drive and encountering a read or write error,
the process would hang.  I was unable to kill the process directly, but
was more successful in killing the parent process.  But I also encountered
situations where the SCSI driver for the PCMCIA card hung, and the only
way I could clear it was a reboot.

Nope.  There are some things even root can't do.  There's fairly
extensive discussion of this in a couple of the kernel design books,
and I <EM>think</EM> in Nemeth, Snyder and Seebass: the problem stems from the
fact that there are two types of device drivers -- those for "fast"
devices and those for "slow" devices.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Slow-device drivers -- for things like terminals, and such -- are
usually split in two pieces, and can therefore be interrupted while
they're in the middle of something.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Fast-device drivers -- which service things like hard drives and
(I think) ethernet cards -- are designed to expect that when they call
out to hardware, it will respond instantly (in human terms), and that
they won't have to wait on anything.  Such drivers have, as a rule,
proven extremely intolerant of hardware trouble -- if your hard drive
start having to do hardware retries to read a sector, your system
perfromance is going int he toilet, even if you have more than one
drive...

Thank you for your explanation, Jay. So I suppose I should either resign
myself to rebooting every time it happens, or rewrite the driver...

Have you ever tried to wait really long (in human terms 
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">, something in
the range of 30mins or so? I think I had a case when my cd hung and I simply
continued with something else and - yo and behold - after that the cd worked
again. But I'm not sure anymore.

Oh - good point, Robos. I've had things like that happen... Midnight
Commander trying to read "<TT>/dev/fd0</TT>" with a bad floppy from an LS120
drive comes to mind, but that was way back when. Took about 10 minutes
to stop generating console errors (about two per minute), even after MC
(<EM>and</EM> the parent shell!) were killed; it had to have been from the
kernel is my guess. Rare, but I've seen it.

One thing we haven't mentioned here...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Occasionally, you'll get lucky, and rmmod will permit you to remove
whichever module supports the device you're having trouble with... and
then your stuck process will go away.  I've had luck with this,
particularly, on the SCSI CD-R attached to my laptop with an Adaptec
APA-1460 PCMCIA card...
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Now, that <EM>could</EM> be because PCMCIA busses are natively hot-pluggable,

A process which ends up in "D" state for any measurable length of
time is trapped in the midst of a system call (usually an I/O
operation on a device --- thus the initial in the ps output).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Such a process cannot be killed --- it would risk leaving the
kernel in an inconsistent state, leading to a panic.  In general
you can consider this to be a bug in the device driver that the
process is accessing.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Once case that I can't consider to be a Linux bug occurs when
one is attempting to access a hard mounted NFS exported share
without the intr (mount(
<IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT="8)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">) flag.  If the NFS server (or the network
connection thereto) becomes unavailable all processes that try to
access any part of that share will be set into D state.  (Use intr or
soft mount options on NFS to avoid all that).  I might consider that to
be a design bug in the NFS protocol --- but that might be contentious.
That particular NFS behavior can actually be a feature in some cases;
I think it should NOT be the default, though.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
When it comes to scsi and similarly local device drivers --- I would
report cases of "D" state as bugs (after due diligence of checking
for prior reports, updates, and perhaps trying to troubleshoot it a
bit).

You're welcome.  Could you recap one more time, in about a sentence,
exactly what's hanging and when?  Jim's right: if this is repeatable,
the kernel wonks would like to hear about it.

Sometimes, when I mount the cdrom, mount hangs and I can not kill
it; and I can not access the cdrom either. Ah, and the door remains
closed and I can not open it.

I'll back Carlos' report; I've seen this before, although not in the
past... erm, for sure since I've been using 2.4.18 and maybe even well
before that, but my memory refuses to pony up. Seems like it was in the
past three years, though.

ISTR that a damaged (boot/signature sector damage) CD would do it pretty
much every time. I've got about 50% confidence in this memory, but
there's something in the back of my brain that's hinting thataway.

Kernel 2.4.17.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Ah, and maybe important (I only thought of this now, sorry): I have
a binary kernel module and a binary X server (not source available) for
my nVidia graphics card. Maybe they are corrupting the memory and this
affects the driver(?)? I know these binary components are not very good
because the computer hangs on some GL screensavers... but I never
thought they could make the ide/cdrom/whatever drive go wrong.

Similar things used to happen to me with a faulty CDROM drive.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If this problem happens only with the CDROM drive, then <em> _maybe</em> the
drive is faulty. If you have 'the other OS' you could boot it up and put
in a CD and check for similar symptoms.

I have a related problem when resuming from APM suspend on my laptop.
Since I updated the BIOS it resumes without hanging as it used to do, but
the NIC (eepro100) doesn't get reset; and unloading <TT>/</TT> reloading the NIC
driver doesn't help, so I'm stuck with rebooting if I want to connect to a
LAN after suspending.

John, have you tried unplugging/reinserting the card (I'm assuming it's
PCMCIA)? That's what used to work for me when this happened back in the
2.2 kernel.

No, unfortunately it's integrated - never thought that there would be an
advantage to PCMCIA vs integrated, but I guess that's one.  I have three
PCMCIA cards that I bought to use with previous machines - two Xircom
ether <TT>/</TT> modem combos and a 3Com ether only.  One of the Xircoms is 10/100
ether the other 10.  Both really heat up, which exacerbates the internal
heat problem considerably especially in warmer climates.  I get nervous
when the bottom of the CD/DVD drawer gets too hot to touch.  OTOH the 3Com
stays pretty cool most of the time.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
A while ago someone told me that there was talk of the eepro100 reset
problem on the kernel dev list, and that there may a patch or fix for it -
maybe in the 2.4 kernel.  I'm still using 2.2 kernel, mainly because of
VMWare - will have to re-install the MSW I have setup in virtual
partitions - something that I've been putting off until I have enough time
to deal with it all.

If Vmware is what's keeping you from going to 2.4 and you would like to
switch -- there is at least a patch for vmware 2.x to make it work beyond
kernel 2.4.6.
