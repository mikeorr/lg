<h2>Orbeon Forms Setup</h2>

<p>The Orbeon Forms documentation (see parent
article's <a href="peterson.html#references">References section</a>)
explains the installation well enough.  I'm going to assume you're
comfortable installing a .war file into a Tomcat installation (copy the
.war file to the Tomcat application's 'webapps' directory, whew).
Instead I'll just say a few words about setting up Tomcat.</p>

<p>I'm going to assume you'd like to run Tomcat as a non-root user.  So,
first, of course, create that user.  Make that user the owner of your
Tomcat installation.</p>

<p>You need Java installed of course.  I use Oracle's latest 1.6 JDK.
Then I create a file to set up the JVM's runtime environment.  I source
this file from Tomcat's startup.sh and shutdown.sh scripts.  I also
modify these scripts so that Tomcat runs as my designated user.  The
environment setup file on my laptop looks like:</p>

<p><pre>
unset CLASSPATH
export JAVA_HOME=/local/apps/java
export JAVA_OPTS='-server -Xmx384M -Xms384M -XX:NewSize=64m -XX:MaxNewSize=192m -XX:SurvivorRatio=2 -XX:PermSize=128m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -XX:+UseAdaptiveSizePolicy -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+UseParNewGC -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/var/log/tomcat/gc.log -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true'
export CATALINA_HOME=/local/apps/tomcat
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
</pre></p>

<p>I source this file in my startup and shutdown scripts.  The
startup.sh and shutdown.sh scripts live in Tomcat's /bin directory of
course.  I modify them as follows (adjust to suit your setup):</p>

<p><pre>
startup.sh:

# replace this
# exec "$PRGDIR"/"$EXECUTABLE" start "$@"
# 
su - tomcat --shell=/bin/bash -c ' \
source /local/etc/tomcat/environment.sh && \
exec /local/apps/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh start'

shutdown.sh:

# replace this
# exec "$PRGDIR"/"$EXECUTABLE" stop "$@"
#
source /local/etc/tomcat/environment.sh && \
exec /local/apps/tomcat/bin/catalina.sh stop
</pre></p>

<p>You might find the wiki documentation
about <a href="http://wiki.orbeon.com/forms/doc/developer-guide/xforms-logging">debug
logging</a> useful while doing development work.  I did.</p>
