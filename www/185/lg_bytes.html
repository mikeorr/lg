<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Next Ubuntu will shed 'Netbook' Edition</h3>

<p>The next release of Ubuntu, code-named Natty Narwal, is expected in 
the next few weeks, but there will be only 2 major platforms targeted. </p>
 
<p>The development of future Ubuntu distributions will merge into a 
single version of Ubuntu for desktops and netbooks, known simply as 
"Ubuntu" for Version 11.04. See more details in the Distros section, 
below.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">20th Anniversary of Linux Celebrations Kick Off at the LF Summit</h3>
<p>The Linux community will come together to celebrate 20 years of Linux. 
In August of 1991, Linux creator Linus Torvalds posted what today is a 
famous or infamous  
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b?pli=1">message</a>
to share with the world that he was building a new operating 
system. The Linux Foundation will kick-off months of 20th Anniversary 
celebrations starting at the Collaboration Summit in San Francisco, 
April 5-8.  Attendees will learn what else is in store for the months 
leading up to the official celebration in August  of 2011.</p>

<p>The Linux Foundation invites everyone in the Linux community to participate in 
celebrating this important milestone. There will be a variety of ways 
to get involved, including an opportunity to record a personal message 
to the rest of the community about Linux' past, present and/or future 
in the the "20th Anniversary Video Booth." The Booth will be located 
in the lobby area of the Collaboration Summit, and the messages will 
be compiled into a display to be shared online and at LinuxCon in 
August.</p>

<p>"The Linux Foundation Collaboration Summit continues to be one of our 
most important events of the year.," said Jim Zemlin, executive 
director at The Linux Foundation. "The Summit will showcase how Linux 
is maturing while kicking off an important year for the OS that will 
include 20th anniversary celebrations where people from throughout the 
community can participate online or at our events in a variety of 
different ways."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Android Developers Confident about Oracle-Google Litigation</h3>

<p>Attendance at AnDevCon in March was almost a sellout and indicative of 
the rapid growth of Android in the Open Source Community.  Google IO 
did sell out in less than an hour of open registration.  At this 
event, 36% of attendees came from organizations with more than 1000 
developers and about 50% came from organizations with more than 100 
developers.</p>

<p>Oracle sued Google in August of 2010 over its possible use of Java 
source code in Android without licensing.</p>

<p>During the conference, representatives from Black Duck and competing 
firm Protocode both told LG that most large firms involved in 
developing Android apps seem relatively unconcerned about the legal 
battle between Oracle and Google.  Many of these issues have played 
out before for Linux veterans and a relative calm pervades the Android 
community.</p>

<p>Said Peter Vescuso of Black Duck software, "Google is the goat to 
sacrifice at Oracle's altar", meaning that most developers do not 
expect any serious legal threats to be directed at them.</p>

<p>He added that many of their customers were using Android, including 8 
of 10 biggest hand set makers. "The most shocking thing about the law 
suit is that there is  almost no reaction from customers; it's not 
their problem."</p>

<p>Black Duck made an  analysis of 3800 mobile open source companies in
2010. This has been roughly doubling every year since 2008.   When Black
Duck  looked at development platform, 55% listed Android, 39% listed IOS,
which was not surprising as even iPhone apps use chunks of open source
code. Android has the advantage of being GPL-based, while IOS is not.</p>

<p>According to Protocode's Kamil Hassin, some of their smaller 
Android customers have been  hesitant about the potential outcome of 
Oracle's litigation but many are now moving more into Andriod 
development.</p>

<p>He noted that Black Duck focused on bigger companies with large code 
bases, while Protocode's products were lighter weight and focused more 
on where  FOSSw occured internally, especially code from Apache Ant, 
Derby, MySQL, and even more on PostgreSQL.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Google Delays Honeycomb Delivery to Open Source</h3>
<p>Google will delay releasing its Honeycomb source code for the new 
series of Android-based tablet computers as it works on bugs and 
hardware compatibility issues.  Honeycomb is called Android 3.0, while 
mobile phone developers are expecting the release of Android 2.4 
shortly.</p>

<p>Google has indicated that some UI improvements will be back-ported to 
Android phones in 2.4.</p>

<p>Speaking with Bloomberg News on March 25th, Andy Rubin, Google's 
top honcho for Android development, said that they would not release the 
source code for the next several months
because there was a lot more work to do to make the newer OS ready for 
"other device types including phones".  Instead, source code access 
will remain only with major partners such as HTC and Motorola.</p>

<p>Developer blogs initially showed mixed opinions of the delay, with a 
few developers recognizing that Google was trying to get a better and 
more consistant user-experience for future Android tablets, especially 
less expensive models that will come from small third world 
manufacturers.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle dropping future Itanium development for its Database</h3>

<p>In March, Oracle announced that it would discontinue development work 
for future versions of the Oracle database on Intel Itanium RISC 
platform.   In a press statement, Oracle said, "Intel management made 
it clear that their strategic focus is on their x86 microprocessor and 
that Itanium was nearing the end of its life."</p>

<p>Oracle added, "Both Microsoft and RedHat have already stopped 
developing software for Itanium."</p>

<p>Oracle pointed to trends that show no real growth in Itanium 
platforms, which are almost exclusively sold by its rival HP.  Intel 
publically defended its chip platform and said work would continue on 
the next 2 generations of Itanium - Poulsen and Kittson, but did not 
state clear support for the future of Itanium after that.</p>

<p>Oracle support would continue for current versions of its database 
running on Itanium for the next several years, but would be stopping 
development on new versions.  This would have a negative effect on 
future sales of HP SuperDome servers and force current customers to 
reconsider strategic vendor relationships.</p>

<p>According to a blog at  Forrester Research, "Oracle's database is a 
major workload on HP's Itanium servers, with possibly up to 50% of 
HP's flagship Superdome servers running Oracle. A public statement 
from Oracle that it will no longer develop their database software 
will be a major drag on sales for anyone considering a new Oracle 
project on HP-UX and will make customers and prospects nervous about 
other key ISV packages as well."</p>

<p>For more Forrester analysis of this development, go 
<a href="http://blogs.forrester.com/richard_fichera/11-03-23-oracle_says_no_to_itanium_embarrassment_for_intel_big_problem_for_hp">here</a>.</p>

<p>Oracle revenues and profits were up for the first quarter of 2011 
and exceeded analysts' expectations.  Total revenue for the quarter 
ending Feb. 28 gained 37 percent to $8.76 billion.</p>

<p>Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said that the products and IP acquired from 
Sun Microsystems get the lion's share of the credit.  Ellison noted 
that revenue from the Sun-built Exadata database server - which he 
claimed was the fastest database server in the world - has doubled 
to $2 billion.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">APT Breach at RSA may undermine SecureID</h3>
<p>Security stalwart and edifice RSA, the home of the ubiquitous RSA 
algorithm and provider of 2-factor security devices, announced that it 
had been breached by sophisticated attackers who were after the 
Intellectual Property used in such devices. RSA has filed an 8-K 
SecureCare document  and the Federal Government is investigating the 
incidents.  In the first few days that followed, RSA did not offer 
details about the exploit or the specifics of what was taken.</p>

<p>The announcement of the breach came on St. Patrick's Day and led to a 
lot of reflection by network and systems security experts.  In the 
forefront of many on-line comments is concern for the very large 
customer base around the world using RSA's SecureID products.</p>

<p>RSA said:
"Our investigation has led us to believe that the attack is in the 
category of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). Our investigation 
also revealed that the attack resulted in certain information being 
extracted from RSA's systems. Some of that information is specifically 
related to RSA's SecurID two-factor authentication products. While at 
this time we are confident that the information extracted does not 
enable a successful direct attack on any of our RSA SecurID customers, 
this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness 
of a current two-factor authentication implementation as part of a 
broader attack. We are very actively communicating this situation to 
RSA customers and providing immediate steps for them to take to 
strengthen their SecurID implementations."</p>

<p>LG spoke with  Steve Shillingford, president and CEO, Solera Networks, 
who pointed to the value of Network Forensics in this type of attack 
and explained that, "RSA is able to say specifically what happened - 
Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) - and what was and was not 
breached - SecurID code, but no customer records.  Compare RSA to the 
many companies breached in the Aurora attacks, and the difference in 
insight is striking. Intel had stated that though they knew they had 
been breached they had no specific evidence of IP taken - very 
different than the evidence that RSA cites."</p>

<p>Shillingford also told LG: "Many companies and organizations are using 
NF for complete network visibility and situational awareness, to limit 
the kind of exposure RSA is noting. NF enables superior security 
practice, which is especially important when you're working with 
private customer security records and systems, in this case. It is 
difficult for customers to put trust in an organization that has 
difficulty calculating the extent of an attack and its source, 
especially today."</p>

<p>Shillingford recommended that RSA take the following steps:
<ul><li> Take steps to further obfuscate the SecurID code that was breached, 
to limit what can be done with the compromised information
</li><li> Take an 'open' approach, recognizing that the exposed code will 
produce reaction/response that accomplishes tighter SecurID security.</li></ul></p>

<p>Securosis, another security firm, drew similar lessons in a company 
blog and asked questions such as "Are all customers [e]ffected or only 
certain product versions and/or configurations?"  </p>

<p>Securosis recommended waiting a few days if you use SecureID for 
banking or at other financial institutions and then requesting updated 
software and security tokens.  RSA is already offering their customers 
advice on hardening SecureID transactions, including the obvious 
lengthening and obscuring of passwords used with 2-factor 
authentication. See their blog posting at:
<a href="http://securosis.com/blog/rsa-breached-secureid-affected">http://securosis.com/blog/rsa-breached-secureid-affected</a>.</p>

<p>And NSS Labs, a security testing service, recommends that 
organizations using SecureID to protect sensitive information should 
consider eliminating remote access until all issues are resolved.</p>

<p>NSS Labs has prepared an Analytical Brief on the RSA situation and 
points that need to be taken into consideration by enterprises needing 
to protect critical information. That brief is available here: 
<a href="http://www.nsslabs.com/research/analytical-brief-rsa-breach.html">http://www.nsslabs.com/research/analytical-brief-rsa-breach.html</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">RSA Conference Offers Multiple Data Breach Reports</h3>

<p>Multiple reports on the state of cyber-security were available at this 
year's RSA security conference and the conclusions are that the trends 
are getting worse.  And this was before RSA itself was breached.</p>

<p>Every year, Verizon Business publishes the Data Breach Investigations 
Report (DBIR), which presents a unique and detailed view into how 
victims get breached, as well as how to prevent data breaches.   It is 
released early in the year, usually in time for the RSA security 
conference or just preceeding it.  </p>

<p>Much of this data is collected by the Veris website, an anonymous data 
site maintained by ICSA Labs and Verizon, located  
<a href="https://www2.icsalabs.com/veris/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In order to better to facilitate more information sharing on security 
incidents, Verizon released VERIS earlier this year for free public 
use.</p>

<p>Data breaches continue to plague organizations worldwide, and the DBIR 
series, with additional info from the US Secret Service,  now spans 
six years, more than 900 breaches, and over 900 million compromised 
records. The joint goal is to distinguish who the attackers are, how 
they're getting in, and what assets are targeted.</p>

<p>Two shocking stats from the 2010 DBIR were:
<ul><li> 86% of victims had evidence of the breach in their log files;
</li><li> 96% of breaches were avoidable through simple or intermediate 
  controls (+9%).</li></ul></p>

<p>This leads to the conclusion that simple scans and basic data mining 
from these logs could alert most organizations to anomalous activity. </p>

Report

<p>Organizations are encountering more cybersecurity events but the 
events, on average, are costing significantly less than in the 
previous year, according to the 2011 CyberSecurity Watch Survey 
conducted by CSO magazine, and sponsored by Deloitte. Twenty-eight 
percent of respondents have seen an increase in the number of events 
in the 2011 study and 19% were not impacted by any attacks, compared 
to 40% in the 2010 study.</p>

<p>More than 600 respondents, including business and government 
executives, professionals and consultants, participated in the survey that is
a cooperative effort of CSO, the U.S. Secret Service, 
the Software Engineering Institute CERT Program at Carnegie Mellon 
University and Deloitte.

<p>The 2011 CyberSecurity Watch Survey uncovered that more attacks (58%) 
are caused by outsiders (those without authorized access to network 
systems and data) versus 21% of attacks caused by insiders (employees 
or contractors with authorized access) and 21% from an unknown source; 
however 33% view the insider attacks to be more costly, compared to 
25% in 2010. Insider attacks are becoming more sophisticated, with a 
growing number of insiders (22%) using rootkits or hacker tools 
compared to 9% in 2010, as these tools are increasingly automated and 
readily available.</p>

<p>Another cybersecurity threat are increasing cyber-attacks from foreign 
entities, which has doubled in the past year from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 
2011.</p>

<p>By mid-2010, Facebook recorded half a billion active users, Not 
surprisingly, this massive  user base is heavily targeted by scammers 
and cybercriminals, with the number and diversity of attacks growing 
steadily throughout 2010 - malware, phishing and spam on social 
networks have all continued to rise in the past year.</p>

<p>The survey found that:
<ul><li> 40% of social networking users quizzed have been sent malware 
  such as worms via social networking sites, a 90% increase since 
  April 2009;
</li><li> Two thirds (67%) say they have been spammed via social 
  networking sites, more than double the proportion less than two 
  years ago;
</li><li> 43% have been on the receiving end of phishing attacks, more 
  than double the figure since April 2009.</li></ul></p>

<p>The US continues to be the home of most infected web pages. However, 
over the past six months alone, European countries have become a more 
abundant source of malicious pages, with France in particular 
displacing China from the second spot, increasing its contribution 
from 3.82% to 10.00% percent of global malware-hosting websites.</p>

<p>The full Security Threat Report 2011 contains much more information 
and statistics on cybercrime in 2010, as well as predictions for 
emerging trends, and can be

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Apple Revenue to Surpass IBM and HP</h3>

<p>According a Bloomberg News interview with Forrester founder and CEO 
George Colony, Apple revenues, fueled by mobile 'apps', may grow about 
50% this year.  At that rate, Apple's revenues would surpass IBM's in 
2011 and then HP's in 2012. In 2010, Apple's market valuation passed 
that of Microsoft.</p>

<p>Several analysts surveyed by Bloomberg think that Apple's revenue will 
exceed $100 billion, IBM's current revenue, with a growing share of 
its revenue coming from internet apps.  Colony also thought the trend 
to such mini-applications may undermine revenues for other companies 
from websites and web advertising.  This could spell some trouble for 
Google and Yahoo, among others, although the Android market place for 
apps is catching up to Apple's.</p>

<p>But Colony also saw a downside to Apple's reliance on iconic Steve 
Jobs to get the best designs and technology into future Apple 
products.  "Remember, every two years they have to fill that store 
with new stuff. Without Steve Jobs as the CEO, I think it will be 
much harder for them to do that. That would be a massive, massive hit 
to the valuation."</p>

<h2>Distro News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Natty Narwhal Alpha 3 will become Ubuntu 11.04</h3>

<p>Alpha 3 is the third in a series of milestone CD images that will be 
released throughout the Natty development cycle.  The 11.04 version of 
Ubuntu is expected some time in April or early May.</p>

<p>In March, Cannonical announced that Ubuntu releases from 11.4 would no 
longer have separate netbook editions.  The desktops will be 
standardized for all users and simply be called Ubuntu 11.04, and the 
server edition will be called Ubuntu Server 11.04.</p>

<p>Pre-releases of Natty are <strong>not</strong> recommended for anyone needing a stable 
system or anyone who is not comfortable with occasional or frequent 
lockup or breakage.  They are, however, recommended for Ubuntu 
developers and those who want to help in testing and reporting and 
fixing bugs in the 11.04 release.</p>

<p>New packages showing up in this release include:
<ul><li> LibreOffice 3.3.1
</li><li> Unity 3.6.0
</li><li> Linux Kernel 2.6.38-rc6.
</li><li> Upstart 0.9
</li><li> Dpkg 1.16.0-pre + multi-arch snapshot</li></ul></p>

<p>The Alpha images are claimed to be reasonably free of show-stopper CD 
build or installer bugs, while representing a very recent snapshot of 
Natty. You can download it here:</p>

Server</a><br />

for UEC and EC2</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">openSUSE 11.4 now out</h3>
<p>In March, the 11.4 version of the openSUSE brought significant 
improvements along with the latest in Free Software applications. 
Combined with new tools, projects and services around the release, 
11.4 shows growth for the openSUSE Project.</p>

<p>11.4 is based around Kernel 2.6.37 which improves the scalability of 
virtual memory management and separation of tasks executed by terminal 
users, leading to better scalability and performance and less 
interference between tasks. The new kernel also brings better hardware 
support, with open Broadcom Wireless drivers, improved Wacom support 
and many other new or updated drivers. It also supports the 
improvements to graphic drivers in the latest Xorg and Mesa shipped, 
so users will enjoy better 2D and 3D acceleration.</p>

<p>New tools for an enhanced boot process. The latest gfxboot 4.3.5 
supports VirtualBox and qemu-kvm while Vixie Cron has been replaced 
with Cronie 1.4.6 supporting the PAM and the SELinux security 
frameworks. More experimental software options include GRUB2 and 
systemd.</p>

<p>The KDE Plasma Desktop 4.6 introduces script-ability to window manager 
KWin and easier Activity management as well as improvements to network 
and bluetooth handling. Stable GNOME 2.32 improves usability and 
accessibility. 11.4 also has GNOME Shell, part of the upcoming GNOME3, 
available for testing.</p>

<p>Firefox 4.0, first to ship in 11.4, introduces a major redesign of  
the user interface with tabs moved to the top of the toolbar, support 
for pinning of tabs and more. Firefox Sync synchronizes bookmarks, 
history, passwords and tabs between all your installations. Firefox 4 
also supports newer web standards like HTML5, WebM and CSS3. Version 
11.4 of openSUSE  includes up to date Free Software applications as 
it's the first major distribution to ship LibreOffice 3.3.1 with 
features like import and edit SVG files in Draw, support for up to 1 
million rows in Calc and easier slide layout handling in Impress. 11.4 
also debuts the result of almost 4 years of work with the Scribus 1.4 
release based on Qt 4 and Cairo technology. Improved text rendering, 
undo-redo, image/color management and vector file import are 
highlights of this release.</p>

<p>11.4 brings the latest virtualization stack with Xen 4.0.2 introducing 
memory overcommit and a VMware Workstation/player driver, VirtualBox 
4.0.4 supporting VMDK, VHD, and Parallels images, as well as resizing 
for VHD and VDI and KVM 0.14 with support for the QEMU Enhanced Disk 
format and the SPICE protocol. As guest, 11.4 includes open-vm-tools 
and virtualbox-guest-tools, and seamlessly integrates clipboard 
sharing, screen resizing and un-trapping your mouse.</p>

<p>openSUSE is now available for immediate
<a href="http://software.opensuse.org/">download</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Gentoo Linux LiveDVD 11.0</h3>

2.32, Xfce 4.8, Enlightenment 1.0.7, Openbox 3.4.11.2, Fluxbox 1.3.1, 
XBMC 10.0 and more.
Office, graphics, and productivity applications include  OpenOffice

more.</p>

<p>The LiveDVD is available in two flavors: a hybrid x86/x86_64 version, 
and an x86_64 multilib version. The livedvd-x86-amd64-32ul-11.0 
version will work on 32-bit x86 or 64-bit x86_64. If your CPU 
architecture is x86, then boot with the default gentoo kernel. If your 
arch is amd64 then boot with the gentoo64 kernel. This means you can 
boot a 64bit kernel and install a customized 64bit userland while 
using the provided 32bit userland. The livedvd-amd64-multilib-11.0 
version is for x86_64 only.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linpus demos MeeGo-based tablet solution at CeBIT</h3>

<p>Linpus, a provider of open source operating system solutions, demoed 
its MeeGo-based tablet solution at CeBIT in March. Linpus has created 
a ready-to-go tablet solution, based around MeeGo and Intel Atom 
processors, with a custom user interface and application suite.</p>

<p>Linpus originally announced its solution, Linpus Lite for MeeGo 
Multi-Touch Edition, last November and has since been working to 
improve the performance and stability of the product.  The solution is 
aimed at OEMs and ODMs looking to get a tablet product in the market 
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Linpus created their own user interface, with an emphasis on 
multi-touch interaction, on top of MeeGo. It includes an icon based 
application launcher and an additional desktop for organising media 
and social streams. Linpus also developed a number of custom 
applications, which have all been written in Qt: E-reader, Media 
Player, Webcam, Media Sharing, Photo Viewer, Browser, Personalization 
and Virtual Keyboard that supports 17 languages and can be customized. 
 See <a href="http://www.linpus.com/products_meego_slate.html">screen shots here</a>.</p>

<p>The solution is MeeGo compliant, which means users will be able to 
take advantage of the Intel AppUp store for additional content. Linpus 
is not delivering a device itself, rather it would provide its 
software to a device manufacturer looking to create a tablet product. 
The minimum specifications for such a device would be an Intel Atom 
(Pinetrail or Moorestown), 512 MB RAM, at least 3GB of storage (hard 
disk or SSD), a 1024 x 600 display, WiFi/Bluetooth and 3G 
connectivity.</p>
