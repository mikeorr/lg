Let's just be clear about what exactly was said about the "license's main
point." You are taking the quote out of context in order to make your
argument. What I was specifically talking about was the method that would
allow users wanting to use Mule in a commercial product with no attribution.
In no circumstance did I say that the license was designed to force people
to pay. The license is there to protect our IP. However I do understand the
confusion around the license and my comments--and understand that we all may
interpret these things differently.
</p>

<p>
That said, I appreciate the feedback but wonder why not a single person who
has so much to say about these licensing issues ever said "hey, we think you
should consider changing this, and here is my recommendation." The same goes
for the FAQ. If you think the information is incorrect how about helping us
fix it? Ross and I are incredibly easy to get ahold of and have numerous
emails and phone numbers. 
</p>

<p>
You do note that we made a change yesterday that significantly softens the
attribution clause, which I have stated publicly that the old version may
have not made sense for us in the first place. I am not sure that this
license is the best choice, but we are still evolving. Give us a hand and
we'll send you a Mule T-shirt (uh-oh, there's that attribution again <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":&gt;">)

<p>
That may be true, but there's no context to ignore in the FAQ entry I
quoted.
</p>

&gt;

<p>
I've been doing that for weeks, implicitly and explicitly.
</p>

<p>
 The same goes
</p>

<pre>
&gt; for the FAQ. If you think the information is incorrect how about helping us
&gt; fix it?
</pre>

<p>
Okay, I'll spell it out.  Take out the text
<pre>
"# Sell any MSPL covered code
# Sell derived works of Mule"
</pre>
from below "What am I not allowed to do with code that is covered by the
MSPL?"  It's not a question of ethics.  Legally, those restrictions are
absolutely not in either the MPL or MSPL.  You're just misstating the
license.
</p>

<p>
In general, sometimes I say how something's broken, and sometimes I say
how to fix it.  Either way, my unspoken advice is the same:
</p>

<p>
Fix it.
</p>

<p>
If you really don't know how, feel free to ask for clarification.
</p>

<p>
 Ross and I are incredibly easy to get ahold of and have numerous
</p>

<pre>
&gt; emails and phone numbers.
</pre>

<p>
That may be true, but I'd rather post to the list so everyone hears the
advice.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; You do note that we made a change yesterday that significantly softens the
&gt; attribution clause, which I have stated publicly that the old version may
&gt; have not made sense for us in the first place.
</pre>

<p>
I don't understand why you want this kind of clause at all if, as you say:
</p>

<p>
"Mule is usually middleware and often doesn't have a GUI component. As
such, the common attribution clause that expresses a demand for logo
placement on every user interface screen caused much confusion. To that
end we've decided to make changes that make more sense for where Mule
lives in the stack and we hope will make the situation less cloudy."
</p>

<p>
Are you just following the other Business Logic companies here?  Why
can't you use straight MPL?  You get a pretty OSI-certified logo to use
(<a href="http://opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.php">http://opensource.org/docs/certification_mark.php</a>), and will stand away
from the pack.
</p>

<p>
 I am not sure that this
</p>

<pre>
&gt; license is the best choice, but we are still evolving. Give us a hand and
&gt; we'll send you a Mule T-shirt (uh-oh, there's that attribution again <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":&gt;">)

&gt; your argument. What I was specifically talking about was the method
&gt; that would allow users wanting to use Mule in a commercial product
&gt; with no attribution.
</pre>

<p>
Which is just a fancy way of saying "If you need to avoid the badge for your
commercial use, then you'll need to negotiate a separate licence with us"
(<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/openresource/archives/2006/11/licensing_in_lo.html">http://weblog.infoworld.com/openresource/archives/2006/11/licensing_in_lo.html</a>)
-- thus (precisely) my point.  And it's interesting that all you have to
say about the FAQ is to suggest that it's somehow up to <em>us</em> to do
something about it.
</p>

<p>
Whether your FAQ entry is "correct" or not is beside my point:  It seems
reasonable to believe it reflects what MuleSource wants people to think.
Thus, again, my point.
</p>


<p>
Also, come to think of it, the purpose of this mailing list isn't to
help vendors improve their online documentation.  It's to evaluate
submitted licences from aspiring open-source publishers, to determine if
they can be certified as "open source".  
</p>

<p>
Your firm, not to put too fine a point on it, has been going around for
some time telling the public you're "open source".  Is there some
reason why you are unable to submit your licence?  Selective finger
malfunction, perhaps?  If not, when can we expect to see it -- and are
you going to suspend your public claims of being "open source" until
it's approved?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; In no circumstance did I say that the license was designed to force people
&gt; to pay.
</pre>

<p>
This is the Ben Tilly line:  They're not UNABLE to use the badgeware
version in commerce.  They're juse UNWILLING.  Quoting your InfoWorld entry:
"My answer was simple. You make a deal with us for a commercial license
and then you do whatever you want."
</p>

<p>
Right.  Exactly.
</p>



<pre>
&gt; The license is there to protect our IP. 
</pre>

<p>
MuleSource uses this phrase a lot -- including in yesterday's
announcement of the new badgeware provision.  But it doesn't mean
anything.  Your "IP" (copyright title) is protected (in the USA) by 17
U.S.C., the Copyright Act.  It is neither more nor less protected with
the badgeware clause.  
</p>

<p>
Do you think the "IP" (copyright title) in Firefox (real MPL 1.1) is up
for grabs?  Try creating and redistributing a proprietary, binary-only
fork, and see how long the court summons takes.
</p>

Again, I think interpretation is in the eye of the beholder. Re: FAQ, it's
completely possible that it was wrong to begin with, but not everyone has
time to read these license-discuss threads (though perhaps if we had sooner
than we could have fixed things in a more timely manner) so take it as you
will. 
</p>

<p>
We are absolutely happy to submit our license, but have been in contact with
a number of OSI board members who suggested we wait and see what happened
with the SocialText submission. Our goal was not/is not to create confusion
or non-compliance with the OSI. We don't use the OSI badge, and we have been
counseled that the license is compliant. We'll figure that out soon enough
as we continue the discovery.
</p>

<p>
RE: IP protection--We have run into multiple issues with public and private
companies who have made attempts to skirt the MPL/MSPL/maybe anything and
essentially take Mule as their own with no recognition of the author,
copyrights, license agreements etc. Forking is one thing, stealing is
another. Your Firefox example is actually one that I hadn't entirely
considered (so thank you for the input.)
</p>

<p>
I don't know that the attribution clause makes any difference--which is why
I asked for suggestions. It's highly possible that we can switch to the MPL
with zero negative effects--we just haven't figured it out yet. For that
matter we might also consider the GPL.

That's fair enough.  I'm still wondering where you got that idea (that
selling was prohibited by MPL).  The Open Source Definition explicitly
requires that "The license shall not restrict any party from selling or
giving away the software".  MPL wouldn't be approved by OSI (which it
is) if it banned selling.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; We are absolutely happy to submit our license, but have been in contact with
&gt; a number of OSI board members who suggested we wait and see what happened
&gt; with the SocialText submission.
</pre>

<p>
That makes some sense.  However, SocialText seems to have withdrawn
their original submission (and intends to resubmit soon).  So if you
submitted MPSL now, you might actually be ahead of the game.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Our goal was not/is not to create confusion
&gt; or non-compliance with the OSI. We don't use the OSI badge, and we have been

</pre>

<p>
We would rather you not use the phrase "open source" either until the
license was approved.  The badge is legally protected, but the phrase
"open source" is just as important really.
</p>

<p>
You're not being very specific, but in general MPL and GPL have strong
protections against this.
</p>

<p>
MPL says, "You must include a prominent statement that the Modification
is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the
Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a)
the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or
related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of
the Covered Code."
</p>

<p>
GPL says you must, "conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty."
</p>

<p>
Also, both require redistributors provide source for the MPL/GPL code,
though the copyleft differs.
</p>

<p>
 Your Firefox example is actually one that I hadn't entirely
</p>

<pre>
&gt; considered (so thank you for the input.)
</pre>

<p>
Mozilla diligently goes after perceived trademark violations, and I
think they would be equally vigorous about copyright infringement.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I don't know that the attribution clause makes any difference--which is why
&gt; I asked for suggestions. It's highly possible that we can switch to the MPL
&gt; with zero negative effects--we just haven't figured it out yet. For that
&gt; matter we might also consider the GPL.
</pre>

<p>
I definitely would urge you to consider both.

&gt;&gt; Their FAQ (<a href="http://mulesource.com/products/licensing.php">http://mulesource.com/products/licensing.php</a>) also has the
&gt;&gt; interesting interpretation that one cannot:
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; * Sell any MSPL covered code
&gt;&gt; * Sell derived works of Mule
&gt; 
&gt; Yes.  You may recall I asked John Roberts of SugarCRM to explain how a very
&gt; similar FAQ entry on <em>that</em> firm's Web pages
</pre>

<p>
Yes, I remember.
</p>

<p>
  The MuleSource and SugarCRM FAQs say third parties
</p>

<pre>
&gt; _may not sell derivatives_.
</pre>

<p>
Actually, these two both ban sales outright; see
<a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/open-source/public-license-faq.html">http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/open-source/public-license-faq.html</a> and
<a href="http://mulesource.com/products/licensing.php">http://mulesource.com/products/licensing.php</a>.  Jitterbit (another
company Radcliffe consulted for) says
(<a href="http://www.jitterbit.com/Product/licensefaq.php">http://www.jitterbit.com/Product/licensefaq.php</a>) "Despite your
copyright, you can not sell derived code" [of JPL code].  One would hope
these companies know they probably can not enforce restrictions counter
to their license; who are they fooling, themselves or their customers?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Anyway, predictably, we're now seeing the beginning of Badgeware Take Two --
&gt; MuleSource yesterday, probably Socialtext in a few days or so.  The new
&gt; tack seems to be to <em>try</em> to defuse the heretofore slam-dunk OSD#10
&gt; argument (which effort from MuleSource I do appreciate, as it at least
&gt; tries, and can probably be fixed in that area), but retains from Take
&gt; One the "big logo with name and URL must be shoved into every user's
&gt; face" notion.
</pre>

<p>
It's certainly an improvement, but still non-compliant in my view.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; SATAN's still available:  It's just that nobody's cared in a decade,
&gt; because its licensing crippled reuse, leaving a gap into which
&gt; alternatives like Nessus stepped eventually.
</pre>

<p>
To be fair, it seems Nessus also cripples reuse in the traditional
method ("You agree not to deliver or otherwise
make available the Software, in whole or in part,
to any party other than Tenable" ...).

Thanks for pointing to those statements in the FAQ. While I am not sure that
the statements are wrong, they are clearly open to interpretation.
Regardless, we intended to remove them when we made the license change.
Sorry to add to the confusion.

<p>
It would have been helpful for you to have sent me a note so that we can
help to dispel any confusion or inaccuracy. Should there be other issues,
