	What and Why</H3>

<p><strong>From Stephen Oberther on Tue, 07 Apr 1998 </strong></p>

<P><strong>First of all let me say that I love the magazine and your
column.  This problem has been bothering me for quite
some time now and I can't seem to figure out how to
remedy it.  I have a dial-up internet account but use my
local sendmail for email distribution.

<br><br>
My question is this: Is there a way to have my actual
email address stampled onto my email so that the
recipient can just reply to the email normally and have
the reply go to my account with my ISP?  Currently, with
the exception of this message if netscape works properly,
the from field is posted with my username and my local
machine name, as it should be.  Is this possible at all
or is it just a lost cause?</strong></p>

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
	align="left" border="0">Yes, 
	there is a way to have your system "masquerade" as
	some other system or domain.  In fact this is what most
	organizations do.

<br><br>
	Note:  this '<tt>sendmail</tt>' masquerading feature should 
<em>not</em> be
	confused with "IP Masquerading" (which is a form of 
	TCP/IP network address translation -- or NAT).  In the 
	contest of mail the term refers purely to how the headers
	of each piece of mail are constructed.  (IP masquerading is
	at the transport layer of the OSI reference model while 
	'<tt>sendmail</tt>' masquerading is at the applications layer).

<br><br>
	Now the fact that you mention Netscape (presumably NS
	Navigator or Communicator) raises a different issue.
	Some MUA's --- particularly those that have been ported 
	from or significantly influenced by non-Unix code ---
	will bypass the normal conventions for mail handling under
	Unix and deliver their own mail directly to the apparent
	recipient (by doing the appropriate DNS query for MX 
	records and engaging in a direct TCP dialog with that
	host's SMTP port.  In many cases you can configure these
	to relay mail through some other system --- such as
	'localhost' which will allow your '<tt>sendmail</tt>' (or qmail,
	or vmail, or other local MTA (mail transport agent) to
	apply your local policies (like header rewrites) to the 
	mail).

<br><br>
	Host "hiding" via '<tt>sendmail</tt>' masquerading is such a local
	policy.  Assuming you're using '<tt>sendmail</tt>' you can enable
	it with the following lines to your '<tt>mc</tt>' (Macro Config)
	file:

<blockquote><code>
FEATURE(always_add_domain)dnl<br>
FEATURE(allmasquerade)dnl<br>
FEATURE(always_add_domain)dnl<br>
FEATURE(masquerade_envelope)dnl<br>
MASQUERADE_AS($YOURHOST)dnl

</code></blockquote>
	Naturally you probably need other lines in there
	and you need to run this through the M4 macro preprocessor
	to generate your <tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt> file.  (I do not
	recommend hand hacking the cf files as this is 
	more error prone and harder to document and review later).

<br><br>
	You might not need all of these features --- but I use them.

<br><br>
	Note:  this doesn't "hide" your internal host names and/or
	IP address in the "<tt>Received:</tt>" headers --- which is an FAQ
	in security (via obscurity) features.  I merely affects the
	<tt>Reply-Path:</tt> and <tt>From:</tt> addresses.  

<br><br>
	The part about "masquerade_envelope" is one I've added 
	more recently.  It prevents some potentially alarming headers 
	from appearing in my mail when a recieving or relaying mailhost's
	sendmail (or other MTA) can't do a proper "double reverse"
	lookup of my address.  (Yes, my DNS and reverse DNS are out
	of sync --- and no, I haven't fought it out with my ISP
	nor have I assumed control of my own DNS.  Let's not 
	talk about the footwear on the cobbler's kids!).

<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(!)"
	align="left" border="0">The
	first test I would make in your situation is to 
	pass a message straight to sendmail with a command like:

<blockquote><code>
	/usr/lib/sendmail -t -v -oe &lt; $TESTMAIL
</code></blockquote>

	... where $TESTMAIL is the name of a file that has a 
	reasonably formatted piece of mail (at least a <tt>To:</tt> and
	a <tt>Subject:</tt> line for a header, a blank line and a few
	lines of text for the body).

<br><br>
	point the <tt>To:</tt> line at one of your other accounts to
	a friend or through some autoresponder (pick one that
	doesn't remove the headers).  Then you can see
	what sort of rewriting is occuring.  It may be that 
	you system's MTA is already properly configured and 
	you can focus on the MUA (mail user agent).
