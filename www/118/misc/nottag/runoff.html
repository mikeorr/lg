The rest was easy. (I'm speaking relatively here, of course - relative to a

toilet and which can of soup to open for supper, it was the seventh circle

Because what I'm feeling is gratitude, what I'm feeling is an affection so
deep for this big-shouldered oblivious old lady in the bed at my feet that
it's verging dangerously close to love, and beyond love, to forgiveness and
even - dare I say it? - bliss. I'm in love all over again. I am. Standing
there in the dark, the silence so profound it's beating in my veins with an
unconquerable force, the force of life undenied and lived right on down to
the last tooth in the last head, I'm almost sure of it. On the other hand,
it could just be indigestion.

Business Readiness Ratings (BRR) is being proposed as a new standard
model for rating open source software. It is intended to enable the
entire community (enterprise adopters and developers) to rate software
in an open and standardized way. BRR is a community initiative that is
being sponsored by Carnegie Mellon West Center for Open Source
Investigation, O'Reilly CodeZoo, SpikeSource and Intel. Phase one is a
public comment period. We are asking the community to provide feedback
and help shape this standard to make it useful to both enterprise
adopters and open source developers.

St. Brendan was, if the stories are true (and if you think they're
not, I suggest you have some more whisky until you do), the first
person to reach the Western Hemisphere from Europe in the sixth
century (well before that other guy whose Day we celebrate merely for
doing it a thousand years later), traveling west in a hide boat from
Ireland. He is the patron saint of navigators, and with the right PR
behind him might well have become the patron saint of the internet ...

Deirdre and I are now equipped to perform this important task, thanks to
purchase of some Tullamore Dew on Saturday in, of all places, Glasgow.
It is averred that such is not ordinarily imported into the USA, owing
perhaps to the relative rarety of the likes of Brendan the Navigator in
these impoverished times.

I personally have no taste for the aforementioned water of life, but I
can use Deirdre as my interpreter.  (I gather that the message comes

Everyone in Ireland is indoctrinated with this legend. For those of

In 1977, adventurer, author and filmmaker, Tim Severin constructed a
boat fashioned from oxhides stretched over a wooden frame, and based
on 6th century designs and materials. He sailed from Brandon Creek on
Ireland's Dingle Peninsula to Newfoundland to prove that it was
possible for Brendan the Navigator (see below) to have made his
voyage.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The medieval legend of Saint Brendan the Navigator claims that an
Irish monk and a few companions crossed the Atlantic in a leather boat
to a "blessed land" of many wonders. A 1977 Expedition (National
Geographic Volume 152, Number 6 - December 1977) has reenacted this
crossing in a leather boat thereby proving the feasibility of such a
voyage.

The boat used in the 1977 voyage is kept at Craggaunowen
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craggaunowen"
	>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craggaunowen</A>), which also features a
replica crannog (artificial fort the Celts used to build in lakes[1])
as well as other examples of how life in Celtic Ireland is assumed to
have been.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
[1] It's speculated that the pathways to these forts were hidden
underwater, and twisted and turned in ways only known to the
inhabitants, to slow down invaders (though I prefer to think it was so
those who couldn't make it to the pub could laugh at those who could)

Excellent book, that; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed
Heyerdahl's "Kon-Tiki" or other tales of exploration. Great story, huge
loads of fun, and proves a theory as well. What's not to like?

My son's mother went on a holiday and couldn't take him, and decreed
that I should take him on holiday instead[1], and that since he so
enjoyed my parent's winnebago, that such would be his holiday. Not a
holiday I would have chosen, but it turned out OK in the end[2]. We went
to Banna and Castle Gregory in Kerry, and ended up with a day in
Limerick while my Dad underwent dialysis.

[1] Sure, it's reasonable to expect me to take him on a holiday, but not
to follow her method of planning the joy out of everything or face

Here's one for Ben.  I went to a boxing/kickboxing tournament tonight,
and there was a Russian fighter.  It was in the suburb where I grew up,
but I'd forgotten how many Russians had moved in after I left, or how
many go to this particular event ("Ring Sports United").  There were two
guys at his corner, who might have been his older brother and his
father.  The one guy was jumping up and down shouting at him,
"Pobol'she, pobol'she!  Davay!  Yescho, yescho!"  (I'll let Jimmy figure
those out, but they all more or less mean, "More!")  I hadn't heard
"bol'she" with a "po" in front of it before.

It's an "additional imperative/superlative" kind of thing (I'm obviously
not a semanticist or a linguist - this is just the water I swim in.)
Making the word longer gives it additional emphasis - just like the
"baaa-leen!" that you mention later. However, "pobol'she" is actually
official usage; I haven't looked at Dal' or anything like that, but it's
got to be in the dictionary (possibly as "somewhat more/bigger", as
contrasted against "bol'she" (more/bigger).) The way it was being used,

Yes. Dawa[c with an acute] is the verb "to give". 'Dawaj' is the
imperative, and I think it's used in the same way (or, at least, that

Not everybody, certainly; that's generally a sign of a serious drinker
or an alcoholic. Usually, you just look at somebody and sort of bend
your head to the side, kinda like "let's go" in the US (actually, it's
also used for "let's go" in Russia - it's just that "let's go" has a few
additional meanings.

Palm pointing inwards with fingers at 90 degrees? When the Polish guys
do that, it means vodka, specifically. (And flicking your throat means

Yep, ditto in Russia. There's a way of making a hollow sound by flicking

This is mainly for Ben to look over, but I've started learning Russian

It follows the rules in "Teach Yourself Russian Grammar" (typical that
the grammar book would arrive before the beginner's book), but I'm sure
it's wrong in at least one place: the book says the Cyrillic 'o' is 'o'
(and not 'a') in monosyllabic words, but I'm pretty sure that doesn't
count for prepositions.

The Russian letter o is pronounced oh when stressed and ah when not.  It's
oh in all the one-syllable words I can think of.  It's normally left as o
when Anglicizing, unless you really really want to track the
pronounciation.

Believe it or not, both of the above would be 'k' rather than 'ko'. The
latter is sorta deprecated, and is very rarely used - except where 'k'
would just smash the following word into an unrecogizeable mush.  "Ko
mne" is about the only thing that comes to mind, right off the top.

None of the above 'e's following the "hushers" are pronounced 'o'. In

I didn't explain it right.  Those are cases where the vowel is naturally
ye.  But there are cases where it's naturally o but is forced to ye
because of the spelling rule.

Russian's got the same thing going on with "yo" versus "ye", with the
former being quickly deprecated.  Both are being written as "ye" 99% of
the time, newspapers and all (although books, and to a smaller degree,
many magazines are still holding the line.) Languages, as I understand
it, lose those special cases over time... but it's hell explaining how
to figure out where to pronounce it "yo" or "ye" to someone just
learning it.

That's
because sh/ts/zh were formerly soft but are now considered hard.  ch/sch
are soft, so they have to be followed by a soft vowel anyway.  But ts +

Yeesh. I think the Russians hung or shot all their grammarians and

Absolutely true. Even for those who don't try to use slang, modern usage

It's a delightful story about a young man in a tiny Siberian town who
drives a truck.  He's saving up for a leather jacket, and dreams about

delivery, his wife impulsively spends the money on a fur coat that's on
sale.  He comes home and is angry with her.  "Thanks, I'm happy you got
it --- your mother!"  (tvoyu mat'yu!)  Then her mother, whom they live
with, takes her side and says, "What kind of husband are you?  Any
husband should want his wife to look beautiful.  A pretty wife
'decorates' her husband."  He huffs and puffs, saying he's a successful
husband, he drives a truck!  And a long truck at that.  The wife joins
the insults and calls him a smelly man.  He calls her a 'kurva' (whore,
bitch).

Not a crime, exactly... although the connection can be difficult to
explain, or understand. The way the Russian system worked then, anyone
could write a complaint about another; it wasn't exactly a legal matter,
unless the authority being complained to (the manager of the factory
where the accused person worked, the secretary of the "raikom" ("area
commission"), etc.) felt that the problem needed to be "passed upwards".
From there, once "serious people" took a hand, it could turn into
anything at all - and, if you were unlucky, could result in a long, long
sentence, literally for no reason at all other than that you came to the
attention of the authorities.

I've always considered that to be a place-holder - i.e., "we have not
the slightest goddamn idea of how this weird Russki thing is pronounced,
so we'll use something that no one else can figure out how to pronounce
either." 'sh' is pronounced more or less as you'd expect it (except, of
course, harder - this being Russian); 'sch' (my preferred gloss for it)
is sorta like the "sh" in "sheet". Actually, to break it down in more
detail, the beginning of it is much like "sh", but the end is more like
the "ch" in "cheese"; the tip of the tongue is almost between the teeth
with the lips pulled back (unlike 'sh', where it's about 1" back from
the teeth and the lips are more relaxed - at least for me.)

The word for clock is chasy, plural of chas
(hour).  You can say five clocks just fine (pyat' chasov), with a
genetive plural noun.  But numbers 2-4 take a genetive singular noun
(the old dual form), and there is no singular for clock.  "Dva chasa"
means two hours or two o'clock, not two clocks.  You have to use a
parallel set of numbers, the collectives.  "dvoe chasov", a pair of
clocks.  But the collectives are defined only to ten.  If you want to
say twenty-two clocks, you're out of luck.  The only way is to recast
the sentence to put the noun in a non-nominative case, then you can use
the ordinary plural.
"dom dvadtsati dvukh chasov", the house of twenty-one clocks.

Collectives <EM>are</EM> plural, and since Russian matches the adjective

'one' behaves like an adjective.  But its nominative forms are short
(odin/odna/odno/odni   vs   novyy/novaya/novoe/novye).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The other numbers behave kind of like nouns.  Only 'two' has a feminine
form, and that only in the nominative.  The others all have one form for
each case.  A nominative number takes a genetive noun, but the other
cases are all normal.  Sampling of nominative, genetive, dative:

You meant "kanikuli", of course - which is both "school holiday" <EM>and</EM>
"school holidays" (collect the entire set!) And "sutki" used by itself
is explicitly singular; you could say "odni sutki", but only as a way of
emphasizing that singular status.

Err... well... they're actually kinda in the middle between the two.
I see "kanikuli" is a collective because there isn't a "more singular"
form of it, and the meaning is plural - it's a sort of a super-plural,
because even in its simplest meaning it still covers a range of days; in
the other one, it means a group of those ranges.

A "collective" is the opposite, a word that
has a singular form but plural meaning.  Two sheep, two fish.  Also all
non-count nouns like "sand" and "ketchup" where you say "some" or "how
much" instead of "how many".  Russian has more collectives than English,
e.g., kartofel'  (potato, potatoes).

They also tend to use singular for
food where we'd use plural, even when a plural noun exists.  "Frodo
sobiraet grybu," (Frodo collects mushrooms.)  Well, he's not collecting
just one mushroom, is he?

Grr, another place where I meant 'gribu'.  But that's wrong too.  I keep
thinking 'grib' is feminine like 'ryba' (fish).  Anyway, what I meant
is, both languages consider 'fish' collective even though a plural
exists (fishes):

[blink] I'm afraid not, Mike. It would be "sobiraet griby" (gen masc
plural); there's no case here in which it would be "griba". Although
there is a usage in which this works - something like "Hawkeye ushel v
les strelyayet barsuka" - which also works in English: "Hawkeye has gone
to the forest to shoot the badger" (even though the meaning of "badger"
in both cases is plural, the usage is singular.)

None of my teachers said chasy, sutki, kanikuli were collectives, they
said they were plural, in that inexplicable way that
"scissors/jeans/clothes" are plural in English.  Perhaps that's

There's no such word. "Sutki" is just a... how do I put it... more
"precise" way of saying "den'", because "den'" is very aproximate to a
Russian. Anything from more than a half a day to less than two is
"den'"... perhaps it's the vodka. :\ "Sutki" is, as you say, 24 hours -
although there's nothing in the word (as far as I know; it's Old
Russian, and I'm not sure of the exact meaning) that means "24" or
"hours". It's the word that's used in official documents (when a drunk
gets jailed, it's always "na troye sutok", never "na tri dnya".)

As for "one", it just looks hilarious with a plural noun.  Because in
English we'd drop it.  "One jeans", no!   Just "jeans".  Although
"scissors" gets irritating and people sometimes say "one scissors",
grammar be damned.  But "one clothes": "one cloth"?  No, that means
something else.   A pair of jeans, a pair of scissors, a piece of
clothing, sigh.  There was that joke in <EM>Crazy English</EM>, "Why is it that
you can never see just one smithereen?"

aspirations. It can be tough letting them know (as politely as possible)
that they need more practise. Especially when you get the arrogant types
who think they're a guitar(<TT>/whatever</TT>) god. (Though I have, more than
once, found them coming back, having asked around to see "who that guy
thinks he is", to ask for lessons

Among my acquaintances, there are somewhere between 100 and 200
musicians. All living in this town, or the villages around it (Rock
musicians, that is). In my circle of friends alone, there are 6 bands.
I can think of maybe 10 people who I would consider to be extremely
talented, to the degree that it's obvious they've gone through the
phase of spending every spare moment with their instrument.

Ah. That's ... a really difficult question to answer. I can only think
of one person who's known nationally, and I wouldn't call her 'famous'
exactly. Aside from U2 and Thin Lizzy I can't really think of anyone
Irish who's Internationally famous (well, aside from some pop people,

The general wisdom in Ireland is that you have to bypass the Irish
music industry to even have a chance at being successful, and on top
of the other odds against being successful as musicians (as in, being
able to play music for a living) that's enough to make most people
give up any professional aspirations.

Even with independant lables... it's almost impossible to get anything
other than mainstream rubbish. Most of the Irish indie stuff I have
was bought in pubs. A friend of mine, with whom I started my first
band, was a member of the band society in the University of Limerick.
One year, for charity, they decided to release an 'Unplugged' CD:
arranged with the university to use their studio equipment, recorded
the best of the bands in UL, and released the CD to a few shops in
Limerick. My friend's band was on the CD, so I wanted to get a copy.
Damned if I could find it anywhere.

I'd also like to point out that I'm not particularly gifted, but I did
have that magic combination of too much spare time, and not enough money
(so whenever I read a guitar magazine, it was a quick flick through the
interview section where I always managed to pick up the "you must do X"
bits, but never the parts that said that X wasn't actually necessary).

I once arranged to meet someone at a cafe, and when I arrived I found out
there would be a band playing soon.  The band came and started tuning
their instruments.  A while went by and I noticed they had been tuning
their instruments for an awfully long time.  Then we realized this "music"
was the show and walked out.

Lol - that sounds a bit like the Purple Turtle bar we have in town here.
It usually has a local band playing every night.  One memorable Friday
evening we were treated to a band that included a vacuum cleaner as one
of the instruments, and they were deadly serious...

but my brother's been in a few (after I
pimped him out -- I knew my band wasn't going to go anywhere quickly
because both my brother and I are control freaks when it comes to our
music, and being brothers means we don't pull our punches). His second
gig with his first band wasn't quite Spinal Tap material, but it was
pretty funny, IMO.

After a pretty successful warm-up gig at our (then) regular, with an
audience of maybe 90 friends and acquaintances, he went to playing a gig
for a local festival, in the middle of the town, with an audience of
somewhere between 800 and 1000 people. They had nothing but trouble
right from the start -- the drumkit was falling apart (the singer and
guitarists had to kick the bass drums back into place at regular
intervals),

brother didn't even know whether or not he was in tune.

So, he was pretty angry right from the start.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Halfway through their third or fourth song, he broke a string. That was
the last straw: he threw his bass into the corner, and jumped off the
truck trailer that was serving as a stage. The crowd parted to avoid
him, the rest of the band thought that he'd quit (and the singer made a
remark to that effect), but my brother is pretty dedicated: he stormed
over to the band's former bass player and asked if he could borrow his
bass

The oddest decoration I've seen on a band was a one-off (well, two-off)
System of a Down tribute band my brother was in (called "System of an

stores where I work, and managed to lay his hands on the empty tonne
packets of sugar, and the band were to decorate themselves with those
logos. They thought better of it after seeing how stupid they looked at
practise

but in his second band (basically his first
band, but with a new singer) they were playing in the finals of a
'battle of the bands' competition. Part of the competition was that they
had to put their own spin on a cover chosen for them by the judges: the
fey indie band got a heavy metal song, and my brother's band -- a metal
band -- got a Britney Spears song: "I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Shocks, the (male) singer, dressed for the occassion: a school tie and a
t-shirt with the slogan "Britney sucks, Christina swallows". They even
exceeded expectations by playing a medley of other Britney songs, and
after they'd noticed that a local hero (singer of a British metal band
that had a major lable deal) was in the audience, they played an
unrehearsed cover of one of his band's songs. Guess who won?

I eventually fell out with the drummer, but bump into other ex members of
the band occasionally.  The keyboard player is now a manager with Royal
Mail, sold his kit when kids came along.  The lead guitarist carried on,
travelled around the world a bit playing some fairly lucrative gigs (so
I'm told), although last time I saw him he was working as an orderly at
the Endoscopy department at my local Hospital.

Nah. It's a common tale. Fact of the matter is, it's bloody difficult to
make a living as a musician. It's no coincidence that so many people
from successful bands go on to become record industry executives: look
at any successful band and you'll find at least one member with a flair
for marketing and a good grasp of the essentials of business.

I always knew that about Python. I mean, look: spam-fighting software is
almost exclusively written in Perl; it would make perfect sense that all
the spam generators are written in Python. It's obviously the battle of
Good against Evil... or at least against the confusingly unreadable.

[1] For the rest of you: Part of the problem is that there isn't really
any standard for conjugation groups: most texts have different
conjugation groups: this
(<A HREF="http://www.phrasebase.com/archive2/62_verb_in_polish.html"
	>http://www.phrasebase.com/archive2/62_verb_in_polish.html</A>) lists only
4, this (<A HREF="http://lightning.prohosting.com/~popolsku/Verbs.htm"
	>http://lightning.prohosting.com/~popolsku/Verbs.htm</A>) lists 10,
this (<A HREF="http://home.unilang.org/main/forum/viewtopic.php?t=566&amp;start=0"
	>http://home.unilang.org/main/forum/viewtopic.php?t=566&amp;start=0</A>)
says that there are possibly 18, etc.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Polish dictionaries generally help by listing the first and either the
second or third person singular of each verb with the infinitive[2] (as
well as the perfective form[3]). The function in my mail handles one
(generally agreed) subgroup: verbs whose first and second person forms
end in 'am' and 'asz'. That's the easy bit 
<IMG SRC="../../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> Where it gets complicated
is that some verbs have stem changes, there are different stem changes
for different conjugation groups, and I want my program to cope in the
event that it gets no information other than the infinitive.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[2] Well, not really. Some list the whole forms, others just list the
endings, others list the whole words with a delimeter separating the
stem from the ending.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[3] There's another complication 
<IMG SRC="../../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> Polish doesn't differentiate between
the simple present and the present continuous, but it does have separate
verbs to describe ongoing actions (imperfective) and actions that, for
lack of a better way of putting it, will have an end or outcome. 'I
speak English' would use an imperfective, 'I will speak to him' would
use a perfective. The complication is, because of their nature,
perfective verbs don't have a present tense

My friend in Dublin (not Mick Conry) sent me a copy of what proclaims
itself "Ireland's Only Muslim Newspaper".  He said the street he lives on
is mostly Muslim.  Us yanks are just getting over the shock that large
Muslim communities exist in France and Britian, and now lily-white
Ireland....

Heh. Imagine the shock five to ten years ago when immigrants went from
being a "city thing" to a "country-wide thing". In my own home town, it
was African refugees[2.2]. At first the reaction was "Gasp! Black
people!", but now they're just part of the furniture.

It was the same thing where I work when the first group of Philipinos
came over. And the same with the second group of Polish[2.3], the
Lithuanians, etc.: "Taking Irish jobs" etc. etc.

It has been amusing over the years watching the European paranoia over
immigration.  It's like, "Dude, we've had a lot higher percentage of
immigrants for decades and decades, and our society hasn't fallen apart
yet.  Get over it."  [A]

Actually, now that I think over it a bit more, there hasn't been as
much said about the Polish etc. coming over. Partly, it's because...
well... they're not actually "taking Irish jobs" as such. They're
mostly doing jobs that Irish people just don't want to do.

There's another aspect people don't seem to notice.  It's not so much
"taking our jobs" or "doing jobs we don't want to do" as "those jobs
don't pay enough".  Why would I want to rake a garden for $8/hour when I
can get $12/hour doing something much easier?

When I went
to The Business/Runnin' Riot/Skint show in Dublin in 2000, we went to a
bar afterwards.  There was one guy nobody would talk to saying he's a
bonehead (=white power).  So of course I had to find out for sure, since
I heard there weren't such things in Ireland, and there hadn't been
WP/sharp battles for years.  So I asked him what's up, found out he's
from some town away from Dublin, and he volunteered, "Not many people
will talk to me coz they think I'm WP.  ---Are you?  ---No, it's just
there are six Ethiopian refugees in my town living on welfare, and I
don't like my tax money supporting this bla bla bla."  My thought was,
"Six people out of 15,000 (assumed population of his town) or of 6
million (assumed population of Ireland) is enough to give you a bad day?"

And yet, if a friend of mine is to be believed, if you want a properly
poured pint of Guinness, you have to do it yourself. (For those who
don't know, Guinness is properly poured at a 45 degree angle. Leave to
settle for a minute or so when the pint is half-poured, finish
pouring. Scrape the excess head off with a knife, and draw a shamrock
with the edge. If the pint has been poured properly, the shamrock will
still be intact after drinking. (If you value your intestines, you
*don't* drink the bottom of a pint of Guinness)).

My family has an odd genealogical situation: my uncle Tim (RIP) spent

Boru (about a thousand years, give or take a few decades), as an
anniversary present for his parents. They dumped it in the attic, so
it's all pretty much lost

(My uncle Tim was responsible for my introduction to computers. He had
bulshitted his way into a job as a systems analyst, and thought
computers were the way to go, so he bought me a Sinclair Spectrum.
Unfortunately, he died before he had a chance to send it, and his
house was robbed shortly after (he had a lot of expensive hobbies, and
a knack of making money at everything he turned his hand to). One of
the things[1] that was left behind was an Amstrad PCW, which was given
to my Dad, because he did the accounts for his brothers. As soon as he
got it, he decided to wake me by dropping the manuals on me: "Read
those. Learn how to program this thing."

our 'ch' sound is to the Polish 'ch' or Russian 'kh' as
they are to the English 'h'. (We also have 'th' and 'gh' sounds[3]).
Donegal speakers take it up a notch further. The bane of everyone's
school life was the Irish spoken comprehension exams, because they
always contained at least one segment in the Donegal dialect. We never
stood a chance... you couldn't tell if the speaker was saying something
or clearing his/her throat

[1] Red is dearg, but red hair is rua or ruadh (Irish still has some

[2] It amuses them even more now, because one night we went out drinking
in a nearby village with a bunch of people from work, and got talking to
an old woman from the area. One of the girls explained to her that most
of the guys were Polish, and the woman turned around to me and said (in
fairly shaky Irish) 'Conas ata tu?' ('How are you'). I rattled off a
long-ish explanation (in Irish) about how I was fine, thanks, and how I
hoped she was in good health, etc. She just stared at me, before turning
back to my colleague: "I can't understand these Polish lads at all".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[3] Umm... I can't really explain them. Mostly, the 'th' sounds like a
slightly more aspirated English 'h' (maybe more like a Spanish 'j'),
sometimes you can hear the 't' underneath. You'd need to be familiar
with the Irish 'ch' sound to really understand an explanation of the
'gh' sound. It's like a normal 'g' with that kind of aspiration.

been known for their adeptness at e-mail, being primarily charged with
various religious and military duties, the reading of the auguries, and
leading armies in the field.  A Linux computer and e-mail program might
