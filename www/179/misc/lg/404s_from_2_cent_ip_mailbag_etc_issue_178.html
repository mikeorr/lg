Hello,
</p>

<p>
A bunch of the "Thread continues ..." links aren't working in issue #178.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

<p>
<a href='../../../178/misc/lg/load_average_vs_cpus.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/178/misc/lg/load_average_vs_cpus.html</a>
<a href='../../../178/misc/lg/2_cent_tip___counting_your_mail.html'>http://linuxgazette.net/178/misc/lg/2_cent_tip___counting_your_mail.html</a>
</p>

<p>
etc.
</p>

<p>
Also, it seems my name no longer appears in the list of mailbag
contributors, and hasn't done for a while now.  Not for many issues.  I
don't -think- I've changed my name, although at the weekends... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

That's why you shouldn't be looking at the new issue until the "Issue
XXX is out!" notification email has been sent. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> Are you signed up for
'lg-announce' at lists.linuxgazette.net?
</p>

<p>
I've been struggling against a horribly frustrating lack of connectivity
today; for some reason, <strong>all</strong> the open local WiFi APs disappeared today
- <strong>and</strong> my Verizon broadband connection, which has been fast enough for
me to watch videos during the entire past week, went catatonic: no
connection 90% of the time, and extremely slow (like, 1kB/S or less, I
kid you not) the rest of the time - with frequent hangups. If it wasn't
for rsync, LG wouldn't have been published today at all. As it was, it
took me the last 2 hours (!) to upload it.
</p>

<p>
What you saw was me being part-way through the upload.
</p>

<p>
At this point, I appear to have marginally-better connectivity via
Verizon, but not enough to really check out the just-pubbed issue. Would
you folks please check it over for missing images, bad links,
mis-formatting, etc.? I'd really appreciate it.

The list of contributors is generated by the mailbag script which keys
off the email address of the participants. Your bio has you as
'thomas.adam22 at gmail.com'; please let me know if you want that updated
to something else.

See -- you need to upload the files depth-first; in reverse order, that way
by the time the index page is uploaded, all the links will work without
anyone realising you're still uploadling it.  ;P

Doing so might lead to less confusion for you in the future, then.

[laugh] Thomas, I'm glad that you put that smiley in; if I didn't know
you were being silly, I'd have had to read you the Riot Act. What would
solve the problem is a solid connection to the net, period - like what I
had the day before yesterday, and like what I have today. Yesterday was
a real oddity.

I'd imagine other mail clients have various equivalents to this...
