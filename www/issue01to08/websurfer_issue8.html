<P> 
Welcome fellow intrepid surfing type dudes!  Well, last month was a
slow one surfing wise. I've been hard at work trying to fix several
problems which croped up while doing last issues' Web and Caldera
articles. Let's see; <B>Perl</B> quit working; my e-mail system had a
problem; right smack in the middle of working on that my ISP underwent
some major revisions which took time to complete, <B>and</B>

<P> 
My Netscape trial period also had to expire.  

<P>
When it rains.......

<P> I want to give a big hearty welcome to Laurie who is doing a monthly
column devoted to Q&A.

<P> 
Big Tip Laurie: BACKUP your machine!! Often.

<P> 
For this months <B>Cool Sites</B>, I plugged my grandsons into the
keyboard and they found a place to visit and talk about their favorite
video games.  I had to ummm...well, you know!...HEY! they would've
<B>hogged</B> my computer all night!  Anyway, Cool Sites is devoted to
children and video game stuff for both big and small kids.  Enjoy.

<H3>TkNet</H3>
<IMG SRC="../gx/ecame/tknet.gif">

<P> 
Nope, not another service provider or network thingy; TkNet is a
utility to manage a PPP/SLIP dialup account with the emhasis on
<I><B>ease of use and maintainability.</I></B>

<P> 
Is TkNet easy to use?  Yes.  I was able to set the program up for
PPP simply by entering the name of the script file I normally use as
root whenever I want to dial up the  ol'ISP. E-Mail routines can be
configured as well. TkNet includes an application launcher which is also
easy to configure.

<P>
<STRONG> The Launcher Setup </STRONG>

<CENTER>Global and local save options.  Nice touch!<BR>

<P>
One minor complaint: I don't 'get' the <B>QUIT</B> button. Not only does it Quit TkNet, but also kills the ppp daemon.
Hmmm...thought killing the ppp daemon was the job of the <B>Disconnect</B> button.

still comming into our house!  (You know, I may <B>never</B> run out of
excuses to buy a new toy!)  Anyway, webhead gramps has a <B>Sega</B>
game machine and the boys got to tune into the Sega web page.  Check out

3DO.  Gotta get this machine.  Check out <A HREF="http://www.3do.com">3DO's home page</A> and you can find out
what makes this a 'must have' toy.  MPEG video, 3-D video, <B>and</B> surround sound all make the other game machines seem a 
little flat.  <B>3DO</B> was founded in 1994 and is the largest software development company focusing on 32/64 bit programing.
I also love the ability to download video clips of <B><I>Blade Force</B></I>.  WOW. Too way cool game.
<P>
Speaking of games, check out the games price difference between any system and 3DO.  3DO prices are a lot cheaper, sometimes <B>$18.00</B>
cheaper!

Maybe I don't have to buy the machine, maybe I can just buy the software and pop it into the computers CD-ROM. 
Huh? Has Ed spent too many nights staring at the screen?  Finally unable to tell the televisions' remote from the mouse?  
<B>Nope!</B>  Check out the 3DO web site and find out what I'm talking about.

of Maui Hi, is devoted to marine turtles.  Drop in somethime and say howdy.
