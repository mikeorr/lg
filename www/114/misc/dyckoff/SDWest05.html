<h2>Software Development West 2005, March 15-19</h2>
<b>by Howard Dyckoff</b>

<p>Another March, another SDWest in the SF Bay Area... this one in a
persistent wet spell. Once again, leading lights in Software Development
met, networked, and proclaimed their views on the direction, or diverging
directions, of their craft. But this year there was more agreement on key
approaches, including Agile methods. There were over 200 conference
sessions in 12 tracks and 6 very interesting keynotes. The attendance was
also on the upswing, with over 3000 attendees, marking the recovery in at
least the developer end of the computer industry. [This in a year where
Comdex got cancelled again.]</p>

<p> It was often hard to pick a technical session with all of these tracks,
especially as key tracks like Java, Web Services, and Security often had 2
sessions per time slot in different locations:
</p>

&bull; .NET<br>
&bull; C++<br>
&bull; Java<br>
&bull; Modeling &amp; Design<br>
&bull; People, Process &amp; Methods<br>
&bull; Requirements &amp; Analysis<br>
&bull; Scripting<br>
&bull; Security<br>
&bull; System Security<br>
&bull; Testing &amp; Quality<br>
&bull; Web Services<br>
&bull; XML<br>

<p> The number of sessions on Agility and XP in programming show that these
practices are rapidly becoming mainstream; linked with these trends
was acceptance of test-driven development [TDD] methodology. Model-driven
development [MDD] and UML tools also were featured in many sessions, often
linked to Eclipse plugins, along with a re-emergence of Web Services. </p>

<h3>Web Services - Redux</h3>

<p> We were told about the brand-new Web Services standards that are still
being hammered out - but this version is really much closer to what
developers need. The new-new wrinkle is SOA - Service-Oriented-Architecture
[which may embody the other meaning of SOA]. Several sessions discussed the
convergence of these two design points and an incisive keynote by <a
href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw5/a.asp?option=G&amp;V=3&amp;id=276810">David
Chappell</a> included how these new services relate to objects and, more
importantly, why services/SOA imply the rise of business process
management.  WS, he predicted, will move deeper into the organization and
become the infrastructure for business logic. [His weblog summary of the
presentation appears <a
href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/index.html">here</a>.] This was
echoed in a later keynote by Chris S. Thomas, Chief Strategist at Intel,
where he described a future Service-Oriented Enterprise framework (SOE)
spanning from the datacenter backend to the wireless edge, a system that
will provide the foundation for future business growth. </p>

<p> Several Web Services sessions dealt with design and security issues.
Some sessions were platform agnostic, although many of the presenters were
.Net consultants. A team of speakers from <a
href="http://idesign.net">idesign.net</a> anchored many of the Web Services
presentations, with <a
href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw5/a.asp?option=G&amp;V=3&amp;id=91943">Michele
Bustamonte</a> appearing at most of these. Her blog, <a
href="http://www.dasblonde.net/">dasblonde.net</a>, summarized some of the
sessions and listed many of these newer Web Services standards emerging
from the standards bodies:

</ul>
</p>

<p> On the .Net side of Web Services, Microsoft's vision for Visual Studio
2005 was described in a technical keynote by Craig Symonds, General Manager
of Visual Studio, in a session heavy with video testimonials. The audience
participated by encouraging him to 'move on' to the technical details after
many minutes of talking heads [he complied]. The session described
flexibility options in the MS tools platform and new features that help
software teams collaborate. </p>

<h2>Security in software design</h2> 

<p> One of the best presentations I saw was given by Gary McGraw on <a
href="http://www.cigital.com/presentations/exploit05/">"Exploiting
Software: How to Break Code"</a>, about finding SW flaws in the
development cycle. He started by noting that SW patching was relatively
cheap to a vendor like Microsoft, but very costly in both time and $$s to
SW users. Patches, he said, "are vulnurability pointers and they also
create new holes."</p>

<p> McGraw's main point was that security personnel are not adequately
trained in SW development techniques and often miss major flaws in SW
design and execution. He wants skilled developers to learn cracking
techniques and move into prominent security roles - to even up the growing
skills gap with criminals and cracker gangs. "We have to stop
pretending that attackers can't reverse engineer our code.", he said.
</p>

<p> Some of the ways in which bad coding and testing can break application
software: 
<ul>
	<li>unsafe vars and system calls
	<li>race conditions
	<li>relative path traversals 
	<li>method overloading problems
	<li>buffer overflows and input validation failures
	<li>insecure and incomplete auditing
	<li>failure to use static analysis tools
	<li>postfix, null terminate, and backslash problems
	<li>client-controlled environment variables  
</ul>

The proposed solution map includes using full testing suites and coding to
capture and pass all errors up the stack. Gary McGraw's full presentation
as a PDF will be available shortly at <a
href="http://www.cigital.com/presentations">http://www.cigital.com/presentations</a>. 
</p>

<p> "J2EE Secure Coding Guidelines," by <a
href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw5/a.asp?option=G&amp;V=3&amp;id=257806">Roshen
Candran</a>, of Paladion Networks, summarized many web-based attacks,
including the infamous SQL injunction, and Cross-Site scripting. He also
discussed the issues using POST and GET in Java Servlets, and favored using
POST since variables were not visible in the URL, the user history, or in
the web logs as they would be with GET methods. One of Chandran's
guidelines was to set cookies and to encrypt these when carrying sensitive
info:</p>

<pre> Cookie myCookie; myCookie.setSecure(true); </pre>

<p> The password in the cookie can also be salted and hashed to add 
additional security and authentication between browser and server.</p>

<p> Chandran's presentation should be posted to the Paladion web site soon, but 
similar conference presentations are available at: 
<a href="http://www.paladion.net/papers/index.htm">http://www.paladion.net/papers/index.htm</a>. 
He also presented a session on "Built-in Intrusion Detection: How 
Smart Software Stays Ahead of the Attacker."

<p> Here are 2 sets of slides posted on the web for sessions taught by 
<a href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw5/a.asp?option=G&amp;V=3&amp;id=229599">Allen 
Holub</a> at SD-West: 
</p>

<a href="http://www.holub.com/publications/notes_and_slides/Everything.You.Know.is.Wrong.pdf">Everything 
You Know is Wrong!</a> 

<p> These slides, originally used at the 2004 Software Development 
conference, discuss two significant problems of OO systems: 
fragile base classes and the inappropriate use of accessor and 
mutator (getter/setter) methods. The slides describe how overuse of 
implementation inheritance (<code>extends</code> in Java) can get 
you into trouble, how getter/setter methods can make code 
unmaintainable, and solutions to both problems.</p>

<a href="http://www.holub.com/publications/notes_and_slides/security101.pdf">Security
101</a>

<p> These slides are an introduction to security and cryptographic 
technology, from a presentation given at the Software Development 
conference. This version introduces some big-picture issues as well 
as focusing on the crypto technology.</p> 

<p> It was refreshing that there were so many tracks on developing software with 
security in design. Other tracks dealt with software security and 
also system level security.</p>

<h3>TDD, code and test</h3> 

<p> Several sessions focusing on testing and test-driven methods. Many of
the Design seminars also endorsed TDD. Even Scott Ambler's session on
"Agile Data" gave a few nods to TDD.</p>

<p> On of the clearest seminars showing this convergence of Design
Patterns, TDD and code refactoring was a too-short seminar with a very long
title: <a
href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw4/a.asp?option=C&amp;V=11&amp;SessID=2318&amp;Mgt=0&amp;RVid=0">Emergent
Design: evolving systems with high efficiency</a>by Scott Bain.</p>

<p> I think the best way to introduce this is to list the detailed but succinct description from the longer 
tutorial he gave the previous year at SDWest:</p>

<p>Session Title: <a
href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw4/a.asp?option=C&amp;V=11&amp;SessID=2318&amp;Mgt=0&amp;RVid=0">Emergent
Design: Design Patterns and Refactoring for Agile Development</a>
<br>
Track: <a
href="http://www.cmpevents.com/SDw4/a.asp?option=C&amp;V=1&amp;CPid=36&amp;scTKs=217&amp;SL=2&amp;SB=4">Modeling,
Design &amp; Quality</a>
<br>
Format: </b>Tutorial</p> 

<blockquote><b>Description:</b> Many modern design practices (XP for 
example) suggest that code should be developed in a highly 
incremental way, with frequent opportunities for validation, 
refactoring, and that we should embrace change as an ally, rather 
than seeking to avoid it through heavy analysis. At the same time, 
the Design Patterns movement has opened up powerful new ways of 
thinking about Objects and their relationships, and how we can 
efficiently find our way to the best designs in a given context. 
Initially, these two points of view would seem to be at odds with one 
another. However, layered architectures suggested by the proper use 
of patterns leads to more flexible designs, designs that tolerate 
change better than traditional OO would, and patterns are a great 
refactoring existing code, in the light of new and/or better-defined 
enabler for an incremental approach. Furthermore, we have found that 
requirements, often leads to patterns, and that an understanding of 
this can make for a much more efficient development process overall. 
The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to the essential 
tools needed to work in this way: Agility in process Unit Testing (a 
la test first), Refactoring, Design Patterns as forces in code, and then 
we will demonstrate how they work together in an incremental process.
</blockquote> 

<p>
Here's the slide text from the conclusion of his Emergent Design talk:</p>

<b>Conclusions</b>

<p>
Design comes from:
<ul>
<li>Refactoring, with adherence to good principles
<li>Thinking in Patterns, which reflects past adherence to good principles
<li>Test-Driven Development, which forces us to test our understanding before we 
code, and is a watch on good design principles
</ul>

<p>
&quot;Good Principles&quot; are:
<ul>
<li>Encapsulation
<li>Strong cohesion (method, class)
<li>Loose coupling
<li>No Redundancy 
</ul>

And an earlier slide:
</p>

<p>
<b>TDD - When to Use it</b>
</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A tool to use when confidence/clarity is low
<li>Promotes good object composition and assignment of responsibilities
<li>Validation-centricity is consistent with agile development methodologies
<li>Requires Unit Testing and Refactoring skills
<li>Guarantees you'll have unit tests
<li>Keeps code quality high
</ul>
</p>

<p> Scott Bain's company, NetObjectives, has several <a
href="http://www.netobjectives.com/emergentdesign/ed_toc.htm">books in
progress online</a> and his book on Emergent Design has <a
href="http://www.netobjectives.com/emergentdesign/download/paying_attention_to_disciplines_unit_testing.pdf">this
chapter on Unit Testing</a>. NetObjectives also runs discussion groups on
topics of interest to SW developers.</p>

<p> <a href="www.ambysoft.com/scottAmbler.html">Scott Ambler</a> held 5
thought provoking presentations covering the Enterprise Unified Process {or
EUP, based on Rational RUP], UML 2, UML Data Modeling, Object Relational
Mappings, and Agile Data [and design]. These all reference the trinity of
Design-first, TDD and Agile methods. Here are his critical observations
about software development from the Agile Data session:</p>

<p>
<b>Modern Development</b>
</p>
<p> 
<ul>
<li>Leading development lifecycles are iterative and incremental
<li>New applications typically use a combination of object and data technologies - the world isn't pure
<li>There is growing proof that serial/traditional approaches are ineffective
<li>Data in only one of many important aspects, and it is rarely the primary one
<li>There is growing evidence that craftspeople, or "generalizing specialists", are significantly more effective than specialists
<li>Traditional IT organizations appear to be vulnerable to offshore outsourcers
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Cultural</b>

<ul>
<li>There is a serious rift between the data and development communities
<li>Each community is relatively ignorant of what the other one is doing
<li>There are few books within either community that do the other justice
<li>The Agile movement is coming from the development community
<li>Many developers are prepared to ignore data professionals, and do so quite often
<li>White boards are the most common CASE tool
</ul>

<p> Ambler encouraged developers to "...actively strive to find the 'sweet spot' for any issue, avoiding
the black and white extremes to find the gray that works best for your
overall situation."</p>

href="http://www.agiledata.org/">www.agiledata.org</a>.</p>

<p> And Robert Martin offered a complete tour of TDD with a little
tour-de-force of how the rigid <a href="royce-waterfall.jpg">Waterfall
Development Cycle</a> may have been intended to be more interactive: slides
of Winton Royce's <a href="royce-observ.jpg">original notes</a> for
Waterfall Development in 1970 show <a href="royce-conclusion.jpg">feedback
arrows</a> throughout the development process <em>a la Agile</em>. [It was
DOD's rigid version in spec 2167 and 2167A that gave us the linear model,
according to Martin, but then they had all the SW $s in the '70s.]</p>

<p> The final plenary session was a panel on evaluating SW Dev tools, with
luminaries such as Scott Ambler and Joel Spolsky. A side discussion there
focused on how to use magazine reviews. Rick Wayne, the moderator and a
regular at SD, suggested avoiding the new-product type of review, most of
which are slanted to be pro-vendor. In-depth reviews are better since they
often list some negative points about a product. But a more telling
situation is a lack of reviews - this means the reviews were bad and they
were pulled from appearing in various publications [Rick stated that often
happens at SD Magazine]. So no review at all, bad news.</p>

<h3>Vendor-sponsored Expo Tracks</h3>

<p> These were detailed and technical, for the most part, and ran in
parallel with the conference tracks but were open to Expo attendees. Intel
sponsored a mobile app developer seminar the day of SDWest tutorials,
available to any Expo attendee.  The majority, however, were Microsoft
presentations on new developments and features in products like Visual
Studio and MS-SQL Server, but some of these were interesting offerings. An
Introduction to Design Patterns, by Microsoft's Ron Jacob, was surprisingly
vendor neutral and informative. There are links below [in the expo section]
to the Microsoft Design Patterns web resources, but Jacob told participants
to check his own website for a link to a similar presentation: <a
href="http://www.Ron.Jacobs.com/">http://www.Ron.Jacobs.com/</a>.</p>

<p> SPI-Dynamics presented a session on "New Exploits" which focused on
Cross-Site-Scripting (CSS) and the new phenomena of 'Google Hacking'; this
is where crackers search for systems with certain characteristics. In a
minute or so, a search for URLs sensitive to an SQL injection attack pulled
up over 500 sites. An alternative hack <a
href="http://www.threadwatch.org/node/2002">steals a websites' ranking</a>
via 302 redirects. A list of web secuity white papers at SPI-Dyamics and
web security webinars is <a
href="http://www.spidynamics.com/support/whitepapers/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>The 15<sup>th</sup> Annual Jolt Awards</h3>

<p> There were some standard bearers here, but there were some surprises as
well.  Macrovision's InstallShield was inducted into Software Development
Magazine's Jolt Awards Hall of Fame, after having won Jolt awards for
several years running. They Also Won Programmer's Paradise's Best
Installation and Deployment Tool for Sixth Consecutive Year. In addition,
InstallShield was given the &quot;Riding the Crest&quot; award for the 2004
best-selling installation tool by Programmer's Paradise. Check out this
link for <a
href="http://www.sdmagazine.com/pressroom/jolt_winners_2005.pdf">the full
list of winners.</a></p>

<h3>Products from a small expo</h3>

<p> This may be considered a weakness of the conference. This was the
smallest expo I ever recall seeing for this conference, although there were
interesting vendors and products to be found. Only IBM, Intel and Microsoft
were in attendance as major vendors. And these companies had small booths.
In contrast, hardware manufacturers Dell, HP, and Sun joined IBM in being
at the MySQL user conference, and Google has a demonstration booth
there.</p>

<p> Microsoft actually had a second small booth to discuss their software
design patterns initiative where CDs with white papers were handed out.
Some of this material, aimed at developers of .Net class libraries, is
available at the following link: </p>

<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/cpconnetframeworkdesignguidelines.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpgenref/html/cpconnetframeworkdesignguidelines.asp</a>

<p><b>BuildForge</b></p>

This build and report suite is gaining traction at major software houses.
Their lead developer and CTO also appeared on a January SD webinar: "<a
href="http://event.on24.com/event/10132" target="_blank">Real-World Agility
Lessons: A Conversation with Peter Schuh</a>". The PDF is available here -
<a
href="http://webcast.on24.com/event/10132/1/documents/slidepdf/10132.pdf">http://webcast.on24.com/event/10132/1/documents/slidepdf/10132.pdf</a>
</p>

Here's what <a href="http://buildforge.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=30&amp;Itemid=62">Buildforge</a> 
attempts to do:

<ul>
<li>Modularize and automate the build process and related reporting
<li>Eliminate process "silos" and integrate tools across the organization
<li>Automate information sharing across the team
<li>Make testing convenient and accessible
<li>Establish metrics &amp; measure improvements
</ul>

Bob Setterbo, architect and development manager at Adobe, strongly supports
BuildForge as an enabling tool for Agile Development. "BuildForge
integrates well into existing tools, like scripts, ant, etc. You don't have
to have developers retool or relearn, you are just productive from the
start." He has over 20 developer product teams participating in over 70
builds each day. "One of our product builds used to take 10 hours and was
deployed to 4 targets. With BuildForge, the same build now takes 4 hours
and is deployed to 72 targets." Another suite user [who spoke off the
record] claimed 10x-50x throughput gains. BuildForge is now in use at EMC,
Electronic Arts, Symantec, and other technology companies.</p>


<p><b>Visual UML</b></p>

<p> This Hong Kong company was a finalist last year and a Jolt award winner
for 2005. They provide a best-of-breed visual modeling tool at several
purchase increments.  They gave expo attendees the personal copy of their
tool, which is a step or two up from the web <a
href="http://www.visual-paradigm.com/product/">downloadable 'community'
version</a>. Although this is worth $60 retail, this version creates but
does not export UML diagrams and meta-information. Of course, you could
develop a full-blown model with the CD they handed out and later purchase
the full package with code-generating capabilities and model exports for a
mere $300. This is truly the cheapest professional tool in its class, but
should be weighed against rolling your own modeling tools with Eclipse
plugins.</p>

<p> Bottom line: there was a lot to learn and a lot of interesting
speakers. Software Development is still a good conference to find out what
trends are emerging. But choose your sessions carefully.  </p>
