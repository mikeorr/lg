I am trying to set up a LINUX web server for Colorado State =
University - CIS Dept. I have Red Hat 5.0 Installed with user accounts =
set up but I cannot telnet to the machine. I get the login prompt, but =
none of the user accounts that I have created seem to work, including =
root. they all give me "Login incorrect". I was wondering how to fix =
this validation problem...<BR> 
Thanks, Brad
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	First I'll have to assume that you installed RH5 on 
	a fresh x86 machine with no previous OS, and that you've
	just installed the package from a CD and have yet to
	apply any upgrades or patches to it.
<P>
	If that's the case -- fire up the old browser and go
	to Red Hat's "Errata" pages at:
<P>
http://www.redhat.com/support/docs/rhl/rh50-errata-general.html
<P>
	There are about 30 upgrade packages there -- including
	fixes for the utils package (fixes 'vipw' command),
	and glibc (the core c libraries which most of your
	other programs depend upon through the magic of 
	shared libraries).
<P>
	I don't see a specific entry for the problem that you're
	describing -- and I haven't upgraded any systems to RH5
	yet -- so I don't know if this problem is generic.
<P>
	A quick search of Yahoo!/Alta Vista and DejaNews doesn't
	show a match to exactly this problem either -- but it
	does show that telnet to RH5 boxes is working for many
	people.  (Many of the problems reported have to do with
	long delays, caused by the "double-reverse lookup" that
	TCP Wrappers uses to prevent most varieties of spoofing).
	
	So, given that the search string "+red +hat +5 +telnet
	+login" didn't give us an easy answer we'll have to do
	some troubleshooting.
<P>
	Let's start with some questions:
<P>
	Does your syslog (/var/log/messages or /var/log/security) tell 
	you anything?
<P>
	Have you run pw5conv to enable shadow passwords?
<P>
	If you run 'vipw' ('vi' the /etc/passwd file) do
	the password hashes appear there?
<P>
	Have you installed a different PAM (pluggable authentication
	modules) or modified its configuration  (any of the files
	under /etc/pam.d/)?
<P>
	I didn't see a new PAM RPM up at the site listed above
	-- though things like the initscripts package and the
	glibc package might help.
<P>
	If these questions don't help you find the problem and
	resolve it I'd suggest that you grab a Red Hat 4.2 or
	a S.u.S.E., Debian or other distribution and install 
	that.  If you use Red Hat 4.2 you'll want to fetch all 
	the upgrades for that -- and you might be able to install
	specific RH5 rpms (including the glibc which *should* 
	co-exist cleanly with the libc 5.x that most (almost
	all) Linux distributions prior to RH5 rely on).
<P>
	As a support volunteer I find Red Hat's decision to
	push the release of "Hurricane" out the door at the
	end of last year to be abominable.  I suggested to them
	that they do a 4.5 first -- and wait until about March
	of this year for a 5.0 (hoping that glibc would be 
	better understood, that PAM would move much closer to
	1.0, and that the 2.2 kernel *might* ship by then).*
<P>
	*** Please note:  I don't have any "inside" hints as
	to when any of these event will occur.  I don't know
	how long it will take to go from the 2.1.8x kernels 
	through the inevitable 2.1.99.x flurry and get to
	2.2.  I read the kernel mailing list and cross my fingers
	like everyone else.  Obviously Red Hat Inc (the company)
	and Caldera, and Yggdrasil, and many other organizations
	and individuals can help.  If I were a programmer I might
	be able to help more.
<P>
	However, I was sure that 5.0 was too soon -- and the 
	34 Mb of upgrades and patches that were available as of
	last November needed to be released on CD to save the 
	'net a bunch of bandwidth.  (I occasionally cut these
	and similar new stuff onto CD's using my ISDN line and
	my CD-R and give them away.  I'm hoping to give one or
	two away at tonight's SVLUG (Silicon Valley Linux User's
	Group) meeting where we'll be hearing from Bruce Perens
	of the Debian project, and Eris S. Raymond, whose 
	paper on the "Crystal Cathedral" was cited as a key
	part of Netscape's decision to release their sources)).
<P>
	I'd like to see Red Hat adopt a subscription model, where
	I can get monthly update of their "updates" and "contrib"
	mirrors for about $10/month.  (I suppose it doesn't *have*
	to be Red Hat to do this, anyone with a CD-R and a reasonable
	trickle feed from the 'net could do it.  Though the 
	economies of scale don't work until we get a few hundred 
	subscribers).  
<P>
	Heck, if there's enough interest I'll do it.
<P>
	In any event, I hope one of these methods works.
<P>
	At the risk of starting serious flame wars and raising
	questions about my "loyalty to the cause" (which cause
	we're not sure) I'd also suggest that you look at the
	OpenBSD (and FreeBSD and NetBSD) distributions if you 
	don't have a specific reason for picking Linux for 
	this application.
<P>
	Linux is the most popular of the free Unix' -- but
	it's not the only one -- and it's not necessarily the
	best for all applications.  OpenBSD, in particular, seems
	to be very well suited to multi-user "student use" and
	"computer lab" use.  This is because Theo de Raadt and 
	his team have found and corrected a large number of 
	buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities in the sources 
	for FreeBSD and NetBSD (and probably in the sources of
	many Linux utilities as well).
<P>
	Obviously this depends quite a bit on your intended
	applications.  However, if I was setting up a general
	use shell account system for a school lab, an ISP, or
	a USENIX "terminal room" I'd probably suggest OpenBSD.  
<P>
	For personal workstations I think Linux holds the edge
	in performance and applications availability.

Here there something that maybe you can answer me.
From where i can get the information about Linux 
File system,memory managemant,and scheduling algorithm.
Thank you! <BR> 
                                  coco
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	In many ways I'm not the best person to answer this 
	question.  Remember that I am not a coder -- and I haven't
	contributed any programming to the Linux kernel (which I'm
	sure we all appreciate).  However, I've read a bit of it
	-- and will offer some opinions.
<P>
	If you want deep information about -- technical
	details -- about Linux filesystem, memory management,
	and scheduling internals than the obvious thing to do
	is to read the sources.
<P>
	/usr/src/linux/kernel/sched.c is about 1700 lines long
	(about 80 pages).  There are about 30 .c files under
	/usr/src/linux/fs (the filesystems directory) -- and 
	about 160 .c files under that whole tree.  Linux supports
	many different filesystems -- although the one that is 
	considered to be "native" to Linux is the ext2fs.  
<P>
	A variant of this filesystem has been adopted by the FSF 
	for their ongoing HURD project (which is a microkernel 
	OS for which rms and the Free Software Foundation developed
	gcc, GNU emacs, and most of the applications and utilities
	that make Linux possible).
<P>
	The code for ext2fs is about 5000 lines.  Probably the simplest
	filesystem that ships with Linux is the Minix compatible one.
	Minix is a simple microkernel operating system written by 
	Andrew S. Tanenbaum for inclusion with (and publication in)
	his text book on "Operating Systems: Design and Implmentation."
	That book is one of the seminal works on the topic -- and has
	probably been studied by every major contributor to Linux.
<P>
	The memory management code is in /usr/src/linux/mm.  It 
	probably shows off the greatest innovations in the Linux
	kernel.  The aggressive strategies here allow a Linux kernel
	to operate within a pretty modest footprint despite the 
	"freeping creaturism" that some of its detractors lament.
<P>
	Where to begin:
<ul>
<li>I'd start by reading Tanenbaum's book (there's a 
	second edition where he's joined by Albert S. 
	Woodhull).  Just read the first half to get all 
	the key concepts.  The latter half of the book
	are the sources for Minix; which don't relate to 
	Linux.
<li>I'd then pick up a copy of the <I>The Linux Kernel 
	Hacker's Guide</I>  by Micheal K. Johnson (should be 
	at any good LDP -- Linux Documentation Project -- 
	mirror site).
<li>Then grab a copy of <I>The Linux Kernel</I> by David
	A. Rusling and <I>LINUX Kernel Internals</I> by Michael 
	Beck et al.  (This last one is published by 
	Addison Wesley -- the others are available online
	-- and published/printed in various editions of
	_The_Linux_Bible_, _Dr._Linux_, etc). 
</ul>
	After you've read some of those the kernel sources will 
	hopefully make sense.  Keep in mind that many of these things 
	are still changing in the form of patches and in the newer 2.1.x 
	kernels.  For example there is a "evolution scheduler" which 
	allows you to experiment with different scheduling algorithms
	for your Linux system.    You can learn quite a bit about current
	Linux limitations by perusing Kurt Huwig's collection of 
	"unofficial" Linux patches at http://linuxhq.sigkill.org/
  	or http://www.huwig.de if you'd like to read them in the
	original German.  These include several experimental 
	shedulers and memory management tweaks (like one that 
	search for duplicated pages and aliases them to one another
	on the fly).
<P>
	I hope you find all those interesting and informative.

'ifconfig' to Troubleshoot Dropped Ethernet Packets?  Uh-Unhg!
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Chris Oliphant, <A HREF="mailto:Chris.Oliphant@nextel.com">
 Chris.Oliphant@nextel.com</A> 
</B> <P><B>  
I have a HP Vectra XM2 4/100i computer with an onboard PCnet/32 
ethernet chip running Red Hat Linux 4.0, kernal version 2.0.18.  I 
currently am having problems communicating over the ethernet 
connection for the last three days.  I want to use IFCONFIG to 
troubleshooting the problem, but don't understand how to use the 
command's output.  My problems are excessive receive packets being 
dropped and excessive transmit errors.  I am able to ping the onboard 
chip, and the port connect is good with other systems connected to it. 
But when I connect my Linux system to the port, I have problems.  
Please advise.  Thanks for any assistance you may provide.
--Chris Oliphant     
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	'ifconfig' is the "interface configuration" utility.  It
	isn't a troubleshooting tool.  I'd usually 'ping', 'tcpdump'
	and 'netcat'* or 'kermit'* for troubleshooting this sort of 
	problem.
<ul>
<li>netcat is at ftp.avian.org
		  (It is a little "swiss army knife" for TCP/UDP
		  -- providing a simple facility for scripted
		  TCP connections and transfers).
<li>kermit (C-Kermit) is at kermit.columbia.edu
		  (Aside from being a venerable file transfer 
		   protocol and serial communications packages,
		   C-Kermit is also a telnet/rlogin client --
		   offering file transfers, scripting, debugging,
		   and log-to-file features over TCP connections).
</ul>
	Based on your question here's a few standard support questions 
	to echo back:
<blockquote> 
		"for the last three days"?  What happened then or
		before then?  Did the link work fine before then?
		Did you upgrade your kernel? Change drivers? Add
		a new video card?  Did this kernel/driver/module
		ever work acceptably with this ethernet card?
		With this system's mixture of other components?
		With a similar (so-called "identical") system?
</blockquote> 
	Excessive errors on an ethernet line suggests the following
	sorts of problems:
<ol>
<li>high collision rates -- 
		  Are there other boxes on your LAN segment that might
		  be utilizing an excessive amount of the bandwidth?
		  How many systems are on this segment?  What 
		  applications are they running (particularly network
		  intensive)?
<P>
		As an example if you put a few xterminals or diskless
		workstation on a network and they fetch all of their 
		X resources, binaries and libraries over the wire 
		(rather than tftp to a local RAM disk for example) then
		you can flood an unswitched ethernet segment in no time.
<li>hardware problems with your card or someone else's
		  (on the same network segment) --
<P>
		 It is possible that some ether card on your segment
		 is broken and "chattering" (generating spurious 
		 signals which corrupt the data frames (network layer
		 "packets") from other cards.  This is likely to 
		 show symptoms across the entire segment (all the machines
		 will be affected).  It is also possible that any
		 particular card is damaged.  It is also possible for
		 the problem to be in a particular wire (are you using 
		 10BaseT, coax/thin net, or (heaven forbid!) thicknet?), 
		 or even a particular port on one of your hubs (repeater, 
		 concentrator, whatever the "term du jour" for that 
		 thingie-me-bob is).  It could be as simple as "someone
		 kinked the wire by running it over with their chair
		 wheel."
<P>
		A good way to test for this is to get an ethernet
		"cross over" cable (sort of a "null modem" for 10BaseT)
		and plug it between the problem system and a known
		good one.  This bypasses all the intervening components
		to help isolate the problem.
<P>
		(Basic troubleshooting 101:  identify all components,
		eliminate as many as possible for testing, continue
		simplifying the configuration -- and possibly the tests
		-- until something works, re-add components back until
		failure.  That isolates the problem.)
<P>
<li>bad driver or configuration --
		If this has never worked under Linux (or under the
		specific kernel your working with) you should boot
		under some other OS and use whatever diagnostic 
		utilities HP provides.  If those work and Linux
		still fails it suggests a software configuration
		or driver problem.  If you had an older kernel that
		did work without a problem, try booting with it
		and running your tests -- it's always possible that
		the card is broken in someway that only shows up
		under conditions that don't occur from DOS or Win '95.
		It's also possible that something in your kernel is
		broken.
<P>
		Naturally you'll also want to try a 2.0.33 or 2.0.34
		kernel to see if that helps.
</ol>
	As I've pointed out -- you need to do basic troubleshooting
	in situations like this.  You also want to ask yourself:
	"Have I provided enough information for anyone (short of a 
	psychic) to answer this question?"
<P>

         Sorry.  Can't be much help there.
         I presume you mean Cthugha (no 'n') which would be

         system into a $40 "discoteque" light).  
<P> <B>

Hmm....I detect a tad of dissatisfaction with the product!

<P>
        I have no idea if or when it would be available for Win '95

         the author/maintainer (should find his/her/their name(s)

What I am seeking is a program that is capable of applying digitized

<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	I'm the "Linux Answer Guy" (or, to be more specific and 
	a little less pretentious, the "Linux Gazette Answer Guy").
<P>
	It appears that Cthugha *is* just what you want -- for Linux.
	I'm not the "Windows '95 Answer Guy."  A role which I probably
	would be wholly inadequate at since I don't run it on any of 
	my systems and I don't like what little of it I've had to run.
<P>
	Despite this I can offer you a pretty simple piece of advice:
<blockquote> 
		Ask the author.
</blockquote> 
	Another possibility is that you could try the port yourself.
	I'm not sure what the licensing of Cthugha and its sources is
	-- but it's probably GPL.  That license lets you port it to 
	any OS or platform you like -- or pay anyone else to perform
	the port to your specs.
<P>
	If you should find that the port to native Windows API's is 
	too difficult you could try DESQview/X (which offers X Windows
	API's over DOS) or you could try OpenNT (from Softway Systems
	at www.softway.com).  OpenNT offers reasonably complete Unix
	API's -- and some X Windows if I heard correctly -- and runs
	under NT.  I have also heard of several developers tools that
	purport to compile Unix/X Windows code into native MS Windows
	API's.  However I don't have any experience with them, nor any
	personal interest in them.

xdm Login doesn't!
</h3>
<P> <B> 
From: Cesar Augusto Kant Grossmann, <A HREF="mailto:ckant@fazenda.gov.br">
ckant@fazenda.gov.<BR></A>
</B> <P><B>  
I run my Linux Box in the "graphics mode" (changing inittab accordling) =
bu I can't login as normal user. When I try to login as normal user, the =
screen flickers like a logout in the X, and the login screen comes back.
</B> <P> 
<img align=bottom alt=" " src="../gx/ans2.gif">
	This is also referred to as "using 'xdm'" (X Display Manager)
	which provides a GUI login to X.
<P>
	You don't mention what sort of system you have (which distribution
	what architecture/platform, what packages you've installed or
	updated, etc).  You also don't mention whether you can login via
	a text mode console (VC/VT) or via telnet or a serial line.
<P>
	If you can, the problem is likely to be a mismatch between your 
	'xdm' binary and the authentication model/settings that you 
	have for your other 'login' modes.
<P>
	This is one area where the FreeBSD crowd definitely had a 
	better model.  Under Linux you can use the old-fashioned
	(traditional -- and insecure) authentication mode where 
	the hashes of your passwords are stored in the /etc/passwd.
	Alternatively you can install or enable some variation of the
	"shadow" suite.  This removes the password hashes from the
	/etc/passwd file and stores them in a different file -- one which
	is only accessible to privileged (SUID) programs -- and not
	readable by normal users.
<P>
	The purpose of all that is to make the system more resistant
	to dictionary and cryptanalytic (brute force or otherwise)
	attacks.  In other words using the 'shadow' options is more
	secure than allowing normal users to just snarf the hashes
	up, and copy them to a machine running 'crack'.
<P>
	The problem is that there are many programs that authenticate
	users under Unix/Linux.  In addition to login there's xdm,
	ftpd, xlock, vlock, screen's lock feature, popd, imapd, the
	passwd command etc.  In FreeBSD they modified the libraries
	-- and ensured that all the programs were linked against the
	same shared library.  This hides the details -- because the
	library calls that "getpwent()" (get password file entries)
	automatigically merge the passwd hash from the shadow file
	(called /etc/pwdb.master? or somethine like that -- in 
	FreeBSD) if that file exists and is readable.  
<P>
	Thus unprivileged files on a shadow enabled get pw entries
	with an "obscured" password field (usually just a "x")
	while privileged (SUID) program get a merged one that's 
	suitable for comparison to a properly crypted/hashed 
	password as provided by an alleged user.
<P>
	The other advantage to the FreeBSD method is that changing
	the hashing algorithm (from the traditional 56-bit DES on
	a string of zeros -- to a MD5 sum) is relatively easy --
	only has to be supported in one place (the shared libraries)
	and doesn't require that all the other programs be changed.
	(Another feature of the FreeBSD password/account management
	libraries is that they support dbm hashes of the account
	names -- meaning that *huge* lists of accounts are possible
	without suffering a "linear" increase in login/authentication
	response times)
<P>
	For now Linux has three different, and partially incompatible
	account/authentication schemes:
<ul>
<li>Traditional /etc/passwd files
<li>Shadow suite (still with flat text files)
<li>PAM and libpwdb (dbm files and modular authentication
model).
</ul>
	The frustrating thing is that these can all work together
	do some degrees -- a pwdb system maintains a set of text
	flatfiles that are sync'd to the dbm/hash tables (these hashes
	are the indexed/search type -- as opposed to the cryptographic
	variety that I referred to earlier -- like 56-DES and MD5).
<P>
	Although Red Hat has shipped their last 2 or three releases
	with PAM -- it isn't quite all there yet.  The most recent
	version of PAM is about 0.63 (beta). However -- if you installed 
	a recent Red Hat Linux (4.2 or 5.0 with patches)
	you should be able to use its xdm and all of their stock utils
	without trouble.
<P>
	If you compiled your own 'xdm' or fetched it from somewhere
	you should consider recompiling it -- but looking for
	options that relate to "shadow" support.
