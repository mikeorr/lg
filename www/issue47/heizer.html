<STRONG>Abstract:</STRONG> A small business acquires a stable network by
installing Linux on their servers.
</i>
<p>
The computer systems of a small business often leave something
to be desired, especially in New Jersey. Sometimes a collection of
off-the-shelf PCs running generic office applications gets the job done, but
they're not the most efficient way of doing it.
<p>
One of the main obstacles to upgrading any business' computers is
when the employees become dependent on one system, program or way of doing
things. The thought of making any change, however minor, often strikes holy
terror into the heart of any boss or company owner. Cindy Wallace,
owner of Binding Specialties in Camden, New Jersey, is no exception. After
discussing our options, Cindy and I decided the best route to take
for getting the company's computers networked was a Linux-based file
server. This would allow transparent access to important files from
every workstation in the office, with user-level security for important
confidential data. The biggest change in this type of setup would be each
user having to log on to their computer instead of just accepting the
default generic desktop. Using Linux would also save quite a bit of money,
because even a five-user license for Intel-architecture server software from
that other software company can cost up to $1000, without a mail or
web server. Although we have only a few people using the computers, this
would be limiting from day one and would waste more money as the company
expanded. Another important consideration was ease of administration,
since I spend much of my time in the shop working on production.
<p>
Hardware consists of five x86-based PCs, the least powerful of which is
a Pentium-133 with 8MB of RAM. We decided to keep the faster machines
for workstations, since a P133 with 8MB RAM was sufficient for a
Linux server in a network of this size. The other machines are a 450MHz
Celeron-based HP Pavilion, a 366MHz Celeron Dell Inspiron notebook and a few
Pentium II-based custom-built boxes. All four of these machines came
pre-installed with GUI-based operating systems from a software vendor near
Seattle, Washington. We figured integrating these computers would be easy using
Samba.
<p>
We quickly purchased the additional hardware we needed, including NICs,
cables, LAN hub, UPS and a new 13GB hard drive for the server, since
the existing hard drive had less than 600MB capacity. This would ensure
adequate storage space for all company files. The next step
was installing Linux and configuring everything. For this, I chose the
new Caldera OpenLinux distribution. I originally planned to use
Slackware 3.5, since I was most familiar with it, and wanted to get
up and running as quickly as possible. However, having recently found the setup
of Caldera on a personal machine to be quite easy and still in possession of the CD-ROM, I decided to opt for the up-to-date
kernel and programs that come with OpenLinux. Cindy was happy she
didn't have to shell out any money for the OS.
<p>
The installation was tricky because the graphical installation
program requires 32MB of system RAM, but it went fine with a temporary
RAM transplant. Unlike our workstation operating systems, each of which took several
tries to recognize the NICs, Linux correctly identified all installed
hardware the first time through. The only problem occurred when rebooting
the system, because OpenLinux is set to start KDE on bootup--it took
forever on 8MB of RAM.
<p>
Once the server was up and running, it was a simple matter of going around to
each of the workstations and setting them up for networking. After checking
the numerous boxes in all the endless tabs and filling in all
fields, each workstation was configured. Setting up the server with
OpenLinux required filling in an IP address, gateway address and domain
name during the installation, then uncommenting lines in smb.conf,
the Samba configuration file. This was easy, which surprised me, considering Linux
is well-known for being hard to install and set up.
One problem I had with the workstations was
the OS released in 1998 requires encrypted passwords,
while the 1995 version uses plaintext passwords. When Samba was first
configured, the 1995 computers interfaced perfectly with the
'98s had trouble logging in to the server until I uncommented a few more
lines in smb.conf. Of course, there was no mention of this difference in
any of the workstation's documentation, on-line help or troubleshooting
guides. We feel that using a more homogeneous collection of operating
systems would have simplified things a bit more, but that would have to
wait for more commercial applications to be released for Linux.
<p>
The next step was setting up user accounts on each computer for
everyone in the office, putting all the shared data onto the server, and
linking appropriate shortcuts to that data on each workstation. Database
files for financial and contact managing applications, as well as spreadsheets,
letters, artwork and essential job information are all stored on the
server for each workstation to access. This frees up valuable disk
space on the workstations that can now be used for installation of
important games. Backups of all critical data are easily done with
a single Colorado Trakker tape drive. This leaves the IOmega Zip drive
free for storage of MP3 clips and graphics downloaded from the Internet
when no one is looking.
<p>
Some people feel Linux is not yet ready for the desktop. My
office is probably typical in that the people who use
the computers on a daily basis do so because they have a job to do, and
pencil and paper is more of a hassle and clutters up their desk. The
applications they need and know are available for other operating systems, and
it would take more time and effort than it is worth for them to convert to
Linux-compatible programs. However, using off-the-shelf computers as personal
workstations, no matter how confusing, confounding or questionable in the
reliability department, with a Linux-based back end makes a reliable,
cost-effective, familiar, easy-to-use network. Cindy is very impressed
with the power and features of Linux, and we await the day when some of
the vendor-specific software she currently uses will support this stable
desktop.
<p>
In the future, Binding Specialites is planning to get on the Web
with their own domain and go live with an Apache web server. Also on the
horizon for us is
having dial-in, TELNET, FTP and POP service run from the server.
Cindy is excited about not having to buy
an extra server program.
<p>
Binding Specialties' new network is a great example of a small
business setup that benefits not only from Linux' power, flexibility
and reliability, but also from its economical bottom line. With the ease
of installation and setup of the newer distributions, there aren't any
excuses for small businesses not to have a reliable network if they need
one, even if their current corral is limited to standard GUI-windowed
x86 PCs.
