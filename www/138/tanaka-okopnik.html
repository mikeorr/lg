<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This massive, 2-inch (5cm) thick tome showed up on our doorstep (maststep?),
just in time for my transition to Ubuntu. Somewhat embarrassingly for a
staff member at LinuxGazette.net, I'd been using an aging Win2k machine for
some time until it died, and then inherited our Editor-in-Chief's system
running Debian unstable. That was perhaps not the best choice for a
somewhat frazzle-prone computer user. Happily, Ubuntu lives up to its
reputation as "Linux for people", and the <em>Ubuntu Linux Bible</em> carries
on in this tradition.
</p>

<h3>Organization is Everything</h3>
<p>
The <em>Ubuntu Linux Bible</em> is aptly named - its four sections cover
everything from the very basics to advanced topics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Part I: Getting Started with Ubuntu Linux</br>
	Introduction to Linux, Ubuntu, Open Source; Installing Ubuntu</li>	
<li>Part II: Ubuntu for Desktop Users</br> 
	Basic System Concepts; GNOME; Command Line; Various Applications</li>
<li>Part III: Ubuntu for System Administrators</li>
<li>Part IV: Configuring Servers on Ubuntu.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This neatly separates major topic areas, so that the reader isn't burdened
with sorting through portions that are below or beyond his or her current needs.
</p>

<p>
Each part is well-organized, with mini-indexes included throughout.
Between the table of contents, the index, and various page titles, I had no
problem finding the information I needed at any point. The boldface notes
were pertinent, and reassuring; and the section headings were clear and
easy to find. Skipping to the bullet points on any page generally gave a
good overview of relevant commands.
</p>

<p>
I spent most of my time in the Desktop User chapters. I liked the layout
of general introduction, followed by usage guides for individual
applications, with a brief exploration of other application options. This
went a long way toward helping me sort through the firehose of application
possibilities that open source tends to offer.
</p>

<p>
The text is written in a precise but friendly manner, explaining concepts
without engaging in either patronizing or overly aloof tones. Author
William von Hagen and his editor have done a fantastic job of getting the
necessary information on the page. Overall, it's like having a friendly
Ubuntu guru close at hand to give general guidance.

<h3>Quibbles</h3>
<p>
The only criticism I have of ULB is the typesetting. Despite (or perhaps
because of) being 900+ pages long, the type is small and grey and thin, and
even my jeweler-trained eyes were straining to read the text. Also, some of
the screenshot images (I noticed figs. 14.15 and 14.17 on pp.422-423) were
illegible. These all seem to be cost-cutting choices, or perhaps they
didn't look quite so bad in the proofing stages. I hope that this is
resolved in a future edition, because otherwise the book is quite useful.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
If the heft doesn't put them off, I wholeheartedly recommend this book as
a suitable companion for the Linux newbie who has aspirations of doing more
than checking e-mail, browsing the Web, and playing games. I'm looking
forward to needing the more advanced topics, and it's nice to think that
I'll be able to ask more clueful questions if I do my homework by reading
more of the Ubuntu Linux Bible.
</p>

<p>
In the end, the online Ubuntu community is so thorough and helpful that
I found myself using the ULB as more of a yellow-pages guide to what was
possible and available, rather than as an end reference. For that purpose,
the extreme breadth of materials covered was quite helpful, and I
appreciated the shallowness of each point, knowing that I could get more
detail if necessary from various Ubuntu fora.
</p>

<p>
The book comes bundled with a CD-ROM, but unfortunately the copy we
received at LG had errors, and I was unable to review it.

<p>
Kat likes to tell people she's one of the youngest people to have learned
to program using punchcards on a mainframe (back in '83); but the truth is
that since then, despite many hours in front of various computer screens,
she's a computer user rather than a computer programmer.
</p>

<p>
When away from the keyboard, her hands have been found full of knitting
needles, various pens, henna, red-hot welding tools, upholsterer's shears,
and a pneumatic scaler.
