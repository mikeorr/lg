Announcing apertium-ht-en 0.1.0
</p>

<p>
In response to a request from volunteers at Crisis Commons
(<a href='http://crisiscommons.org'>http://crisiscommons.org</a>), we have put some effort into creating
a Haitian Creole to English module for Apertium. We do not usually
make releases at such an early stage of development, but because of
the circumstances, we think it's better to make available something
that at least partly works, despite its numerous flaws, than to
hold off until we can meet our usual standards.
</p>

<p>
The present release is for Haitian Creole to English only; much of
the vocabulary was derived from a spell checking dictionary using
cognate induction methods, and is most likely incorrect -- CMU
have graciously provided Open Source bilingual data, but have
deliberately used a GPL-incompatible licence, which we cannot use.
We hope that they will see fit to change this.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks to Kevin Scannell for providing us with spell checking
data; to Francis Tyers and Kevin Unhammer for their contributions;
and to the Apertium community for their support and indirect help.
</p>

<p>
I would like to dedicate this releas to the memory of my grandmother,
Anne O'Regan, who passed away on Monday the 18th, just after I began
working on this.

Well done, with good reasoning.

After a quick, unscientific comparison with the statistical system put
together by another set of Crisis Commons volunteers it appears to me
to be about on equal footing; I'm currently at MT Marathon, where I
plan to try building both a statistical system of my own, and a hybrid
system - hopefully, an extra week of work will give something much
more useful <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Thanks. My grandmother had just recently reached the ripe old age of
88, and I think it was just her time, though apparently the hospital
staff also agreed :/
