Hey all,
</p>

<p>
I'm fairly new to C programming but am familiar with most programming
principles from Java and Perl. I understand what pointers are in C,
but I have lots of problems knowing when best to use them, since many,
if not all tasks, can be obtained just from passing parameters into
function directly.
</p>

<p>
Are there any good tips for knowing when or when not to use pointers?
</p>

<p>
David.

Hi David,
</p>

<p>
Welcome to the world of C Pointers!
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, pointers is such a C feature which is often either
under-used or over-used in C programming. These points may be worth
noting
</p>

<p>
1. In some cases pointers are just difficult/often complex
alternatives for simpler things - like in case of arrays.
</p>

<p>
2. The other extremist view is that pointers are often indispensable -
like linked lists, or places where we need dynamic memory allocation.
</p>

<p>
In C you have you have two ways of doing most things - using pointers
or without it. For eg. you can write a Binary Search tree using arrays
as well as pointers. But generally , you will need to use pointers in
cases where you need some kind of dynamic memory allocation among
others.
</p>

<p>
Also you must have already used the scanf() function, Now in due
course of  time, you will know that scanf() implicitly uses pointers.
</p>

<p>
There is an excellent tutorial here <a href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/">http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/</a>
</p>

<p>
hope this helped you!
</p>

<p>
Cheers,

If you're familiar with references in Perl, many of the same reasons
apply. How would you pass multiple complex structures into a subroutine
without them? How would you <em>create</em> complex structures (say, an array
of arrays) without them? If you have a data structure that takes a
significant portion of your memory, doing a "pass-by-value" (i.e.,
"passing parameters [...] directly") would amount to making a copy of
the original structure - and thus consuming twice as much memory.
Passing a pointer is faster and more efficient.
</p>

<p>
That being said - references in Perl (Ruby, etc.) are pleasant, polite,
and bring a bottle of wine to dinner without being asked, while pointers
in C are a pure, unmitigated evil and will perform unspeakable acts on
your pet weasel. I'm just sayin'. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<pre class="code">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
 
# Creates a hash (%employee_db) of employee IDs, which point to a list
# of hashes keyed by category (i.e., 'phone_nums'), etc. This defines
# the second cell number for employee 12345.
$employee_db{12345}{phone_nums}{cell}-&gt;[2] = '1-800-555-1212';

If you are interested in a deeper insight into C pitfalls and tricks you
should take a look at the book "Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets".
It has a lot of examples and is written in an entertaining style.
