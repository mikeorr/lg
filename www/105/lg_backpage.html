<h1>The Backpage</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</A></b></p>

<p>
<p> One of the deepest problems of our much-maligned society - usually
unnoticeable due to more pressing concerns, such as "Gee, Homeland Security
just issued a Mauve-and-Puce-with-Fuchsia-stripes Threat Level
End-of-the-World Doom Warning <a
href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/alert/action.html">Terror Alert</a>.
Do my socks go with that?" - is <strong><em>acronym overrun</em></strong>.
Yes indeed; for those of you who have recognized the problem but suffered
in silence for years - this is it! The Revolution is <strong>NOW!</strong>
...at least I'll explain what I mean, for those who are scratching their
heads and wondering what the heck I'm ranting about <em>this</em> time.

<p> (Curmudgeons must curmudge, at least on occasion, in order to keep
their status. Don't mind me, I'm just keeping up the membership
requirements.) 

<p> It's simple. Like the standard dotted-quad IP space in networking, the
standard and obviously far more limited TLA (three-letter acronym) space is
quickly being filled to its maximum capacity. Some have suggested that
ETLAs (the extended, or four-letter version) are the solution... do you
hear my hollow laugh? (Besides, we already <em>have</em> lots of uses for
four-letter words - especially with all these Terror Alerts.) The
population is growing, the rate of our technological expansion is just now
becoming non-linear - and we poor geeks are running around desperately
searching for three-letter abbreviations that are not totally overloaded.
Some of the definitions even conflict with each other! Consider the
following (Bowdlerized for the pleasure of the ^%(@!%$#*%^*s at the FCC,
who have <a
href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20040517&s=jarvis">redefined
"obscenity" and "indecency"</a> by making of themselves an excellent
example of both):

stuff, check out my <a
href="http://okopnik.freeshell.org/acronyms.cgi">AcroFinder</a>. Feel free
to contribute if your favorite abbrvtn is missing.)

<p> Now, I ask you. Is this right? Is this fair? Is this <em>just</em>? I
mean, what's next - <em>words</em> or even <em>phrases</em> with multiple
meanings? I'm shocked - shocked, I tell you! - by what I see in our future
if this trend continues (it's all sorta dim and fuzzy - I'm never buying
that brand of digital camera again! - but involves high prices, a desperate
lack of good beer, and people wearing 1970s-style disco clothes. [shudder])
Trust me, you don't want to go there.

<p> As an example of this, just a while ago, LG's Editor Gal and I were
discussing a problem in a production script, and ran into a snag:

<div class="irc">
<table>
<tr><td id="q">06:59 &lt; okopnik&gt;     </td><td id="t">There was a broken
'..104' in there, but not the '..issue80'.</td></tr>
<tr><td id="r">06:59 &lt;@editorgal&gt;   </td><td id="t">line number 3266. 1
mo</td></tr>
<tr><td id="q">06:59 &lt; okopnik&gt;     </td><td id="t">'K.</td></tr>
<tr><td id="r">07:00 &lt;@editorgal&gt;   </td><td id="t">missing
fencepost</td></tr>
<tr><td id="q">07:00 &lt; okopnik&gt;     </td><td id="t">I figured it was
STL.</td></tr>
<tr><td id="r">07:01 &lt;@editorgal&gt;   </td><td id="t">not your garden variety
fencepost error :D</td></tr>
<tr><td id="q">07:01 &lt; okopnik&gt;     </td><td id="t">Oh?</td></tr>
<tr><td id="r">07:01 &lt;@editorgal&gt;   </td><td id="t">line now
reads</td></tr>
<tr><td id="r">07:01 &lt;@editorgal&gt;   </td><td id="t">if ( $refdir eq "") {
$ea =~ s/=LG=/\.\.\//g; }</td></tr>
<tr><td id="q">07:01 &lt; okopnik&gt;     </td><td id="t">Banananana???
:)</td></tr>
<tr><td id="r">07:01 &lt;@editorgal&gt;   </td><td id="t">procmail folk call \/
fencepost...</td></tr>
<tr><td id="q">07:02 &lt; okopnik&gt;     </td><td id="t">Ah.</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

(Classically, a "fencepost error" in computer programming is an off-by-one
mis-count; e.g., a 100' fence with a post every 10' requires
<strong>11</strong> posts, not 10. It's often found in loops, where it's
likely to be called a "banana error" - from the story of the little girl
who said "I know how to spell 'banana', I just don't know where to stop!")

<p> So - now that you're aware of this terrible problem and are surely
unable to just sit on your hands while this terrible injustice goes on -
<em>help!</em> Dear readers, please give us your detailed opinions and
suggestions, written legibly on the back of a recently-issued postage stamp
(and remember, <strong>no toxic ink</strong>. We might want to, um, use
them or something. [<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1">1</a>]) Send them,
along with the box-tops from your favorite cereal and a 500-word essay on
why you should be the one that NASA sends to found the colony on Hyperion,
to Uncle Louie, Box 100, Nucla CO 81424. 

<p> Better yet, send all that junk to the White House. It might confuse
them and keep'em busy long enough to stop or at least delay any further
Terror Alerts... I'm gettin' mighty tired of digging through this sock
collection.

<p style="margin-top: 75px">[<a name="footnote_1" href="#back_1">1</a>] Most 
people, when they run out of stamps, simply walk down to the local post office 
and get some. Here at LG, though, some of us are a different - and maybe even 
arguably <em>better</em> - breed of disturbed individuals... we just write an 
article and wait for the mail carrier. It's less work, and much less tedious 
than chewing through the straps besides.

Ben is the Editor-in-Chief for Linux Gazette and a member of The Answer Gang.

<em>
<p>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.

<p>His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.

<p>He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
