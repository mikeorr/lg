Oh yeah - I used to wonder why the military was screwing around with
depleted uranium, osmium, and other crap like that for their
armor-penetrating rounds, since even a tiny chunk of my old AST laptop
would have instantly crushed any armor division that it fell on.

<blockQuote>
On the other hand, since accelerating that kind of mass to anything
above pedestrian velocities would require a nuclear explosion, and since
any violent state change stands a chance of precipitating gravitic
collapse and black hole formation, perhaps it's just as well...

<p><strong>From Mark W. Tomlinson

<P><STRONG>
I had just settled in of a Saturday evening with a wee dram of Irish
whiskey, a good Henry Clay cigar and Linux Gazette #109.  I had worked
my way to "Return of the Linux Laundrette" and reached the section "Re:
[LG 87] help wanted #4".  This piece caused me to drop my cigar (due to
uncontrollable grinning, giggling and guffawing), setting my sweatpants
on fire.

I'm fine, thanks - I extinguished the blaze by spilling my libation in
my lap - followed, of course, by the water chaser.  Be advised that I
will be taking legal advice re: financial recovery for the loss of the
whiskey...

Well, Ben and I have our own sideline business
(<A HREF="../107/misc/laundrette/lg_hitsquad.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/107/misc/laundrette/lg_hitsquad.html</A>), so I can
say with some confidence that it won't come to that, though some
recovery may occur at some later date.

I don't know how you people manage to produce such an outstanding
combination of useful Linux information, non sequiturs and a, ah, rather
&lt;veering&gt; approach to humor (my kind!) -  but I certainly hope you keep
doing it for a long time to come.

Well, I'll be compiling it for a while to come: it's a lot of fun to go
back over the offtopic threads every month, especially since there are
so many of them:

Here in the Greater Metro DC area (and south of the Mason-Dixon line),
there are <EM>two</EM> kinds, sweet and unsweet, at least in iced teas. The
chinese restaurants uniformly serve hot black pekoe. You can stand a
spoon up in "sweet" and they both taste powdered, and of the same brand,
at least in all the restaurants I've been in. I only got sweet once, and
that before I knew what I was in for. The funny thing was, I didn't know

We have the same sort of 'you won't drink with me?' thing here. It's probably

The tea thing happened indirectly.  You can't drink the water in Russia
unless you boil it first.  Russians did not generally keep fresh water
around, but you were never far from a teapot.  And tea is boiled water
-- how convenient!  The babushkas were surprised when I kept coming back
for tea, and were amazed when after a few cups I'd say, "Just let me
have some hot water, please" until I was ready for more tea.  So I came
home and never stopped drinking tea.

<blockQuote>
The thing I missed most in Russia was ice water.  I love ice water,
especially with hot food.  You can refrigerate boiled water, but you
can't make ice cubes without ice cube trays.  I guess ice is not a
Russian tradition; I did not see a single ice cube tray my whole time
there.  I decided if I ever go back to Russia, I'm gonna make sure to
pack a couple ice cube trays.

We have the same sort of 'you won't drink with me?' thing here. It's probably
because there's very little physical contact between sober males - it's OK
when you're drunk, or already very good friends with someone, so drinking
together is an essential part of the friendship process.

Not that I saw.  People in Ireland drank if they wanted to, but they
didn't get all out of sorts if you didn't.  And if you stuck to one
beer a day they didn't mind.  It wasn't this one after another "you
must have more" thing.

Well, it's more that if you continually decline invitations to the pub,
people get really annoyed. And you're right, no one minds if you don't
drink. They will tease you for it, though.

Heh. Ya gotta unn'erstan', Mike... despite the overt simplicity, there's
a lot to that custom. In many ways, it's like the Jewish "eat, eat!"
thing. First off, there <em>  is  </em> the obvious - "hey, aren't we friends? Why
do you want to insult me?" But there's also an undertone of "just how
much will you let me force you to drink?", with the sure knowledge that
if you agree once, it becomes much easier after that. Then there's the
cultural imperative of "you must be drunk to talk about <EM>serious</EM>
things", which is What Men Do (i.e., big-time male bonding ritual.)

Another "What Men Do" thing, at least around here, is insulting your
best friends. It's like a private joke: if the implicit "I love you
really, man" is ever made explicit, the bond is... cheapened (that is,
unless you're +/- two drinks from throwing up); if someone else joins
in, serious in their insults, they find their mouth has been shut for
them really quickly.

In Russia, that was considered more or less juvenile (i.e., college
students, etc. would do it, but not most "adult men".) If you're good
drinking buddies with each other, and you've "talked about the deep
things", there's an implied deep level of trust. There are sayings and
jokes about "knowing who you're drinking with", somewhat parallel to "I
(would|wouldn't) go with you to scout enemy positions" (WWII expression
that's stuck around, particularly among the older set.)

His most used term of endearment is 'bitch', so all of the guys I work
or worked with call each other that as a piss-take. I talking to a
Polish coworker, Beata, in the pub last week. She started to get
offended when a friend (who was put working with my former supervisor
when I changed shifts) called me a bitch, and started to say something
about how she knew what those words meant. At the time I thought she was
offended by his language, but afterwards I realised she only knows one
meaning of bitch, and it never occurred to her that he was talking about
me, let alone that she's completely unaware of our little custom.

Navigating those rocks and shoals is a little challenging, but here it
is: a Real Man is one who stands up to the bullying by being relatively
polite but totally firm about refusing... and <em>  then  </em> proceeds to get
righteously fried with you anyway. [grin] Foreigners don't thread that
particular needle well, usually. For that matter, there aren't that many
Russians who do, either. I guess you could call it a fairly tough test.

Yeah, but it's just fucking ridiculous.  Sorry for the cultural
insensitivity, but I have a big issue with forcing alcohol on people,
or letting it intrude into these areas of personal relationships that
it really has nothing to do with.  It is possible to be buddies and
talk about deep stuff without alcohol.

I don't like the idea of force being used between people - we've talked
about how I switch modes when anyone initiates it - but that doesn't
mean I'm going to get torqued about 99% of human history, or ignore how
people interact. I'm also able to distance myself enough to see that it
can work for others, and even find amusement, interest - and most of
all, compassion - for those involved. For myself, I just need to know
the basics for surviving whatever it is; coming out on top and with
style is a plus, if available.

I did it as a conscious choice, one that took a lot of struggle to make.
I do have things I consider private (mostly because other people are
involved), but nothing secret or hidden; I just refuse to do that to
myself anymore.

I said lemonade.  Then, remembering "lemonade" in England means some
horrible piss-colored soda like Mountain Dew, I said, "Wait!  I mean with
real lemons."  He looked at me with a "what the hell are you talking about"

I finally took the plunge to soundcard-driven music.  Actually it was
forced by a receiver and CD player that are intermittently failing.  I
either had to replace them or get a bookshelf system or switch to the
computer, and I wanted to do it for less than $100.  But I don't like
the current generation of components (way overkill).  The used
components in the shops are, um, worse than I already have.  I don't
like the bookshelf systems (no phono input).  But my computer has crappy
speakers.  So do I get good computer speakers or connect my PC to my
stereo?  I looked into the $50 and $100 amplified computer speakers,
but was afraid to get something that still didn't sound as good as my
stereo.  So I opted for two 25-foot patchcords and an adapter instead,
for the princely sum of $15.  The sound is a bit quieter than it should
be and seems "compressed", but it's OK.  I'm not sure if a better
soundcard or shorter patchcords would make a difference, but I can't
do anything about the patchcords.  The soundcard is... something that
uses the Ensoniq 1371 driver.  So, now I can avoid the failing CD
player.  The receiver is holding up better than it did with CDs.  And
when it does eventually fail, I can replace it with anything that
amplifies.  The only radio station I listen to regularly has
webcasting so I don't really need a receiver per se, except for
records and tapes.

My brother used the same sort of setup. Switch to FLAC instead of MP3
and you'll get some improvement, but there'll always be a difference
because the majority of soundcards are rubbish. The volume difference is
down to the cables - most guitar leads run to about that length and
standard practise is to add a pre-amp to compensate.

torch means something with an open flame like the ancient Romans used.

<pre><strong>English is the most widely spoken language in the history of our
planet, used in some way by at least one out of every seven human beings
around the globe.  Half of the world's books are written in English, and
the majority of international telephone calls are made in English.
English is the language of over sixty percent of the world's radio
programs, many of them beamed, ironically, to the Russians, who know
that to win friends and influence nations, they're best off using
English.  More than seventy percent of international mail is written and
addressed in English, and eighty percent of all computer text is stored
in English.  English has acquired tha largest vocabulary of all the
world's languages, perhaps as many as two million words, and has
generated one of the noblest bodies of literature in the annals of the
human race.

Nonetheless, it is now time to face the fact that English is a crazy
language.

In the crazy English language, the blackbird hen is brown, blackboards
can be blue or green, and blackberries are green and then red before
they are ripe.  Even if balckberries were really black and blueberries
really blue, what are strawberries, cranberries, and gooseberries
supposed to look like?

To add to the insanity, there is no butter in buttermilk, no egg in
eggplant, neither worms nor wood in wormwood, neither pine nor apple in
pineapple, and no ham in a hamburger.  (In fact, if somebody invented a
sandwich consisting of a ham patty in a bun, we would have a hard time
finding a name for it.)  To make matters worse, English muffins weren't
invented in England, nor french fries in France, nor Danis pastries in
Denmark.  Sweetmeat is made from fruit, while sweetbread, which isn't
sweet, is made from meat.

Greyhounds aren't always grey (or gray), ladybugs and fireflies are
beetles, a panda bear is a raccoon, and a guinea pig is neither a pig nor
from Guinea.

It was amusing attending a US-Canadian soccer game last year.  It was
the Seattle Sounders vs the Vancouver Whitecaps, who are traditional
rivals.  Some Sounders fans were trying to promote a "loud section" --
an area where people were encouraged to stand and make noise like the
Europeans do -- and were passing out flyers trying to convince people to
get tickets for that section.  But the section was pretty empty.  The
Canadians meanwhile had brought their maple leaves in force and were
shouting and blowing noisemakers the whole time.  The Sounders fans
couldn't be bothered to bestir themselves, and just sat watching and
quietly thinking, "Canadians are weird".  Of course, everybody goes
"Ooooh!" when there's a score, but that only lasts ten seconds and
then it's over, it's not the continual rumblings.

Vamos means "we go" or "let's go" in Spanish.  Vamoose (va-MOOSE) is an
English corruption that's more urgent (disappear, scram, get lost,

Did you see the Inspector in the Pink Panther cartoons?  He was a French
guy with a Spanish sidekick.  Every time he gave an order, the sidekick
would say, "si".  The inspector kept chiding him, "Don' say 'si', say
'oui'."  Once they were on a pirate ship battling this evil clam
captain.  They escaped the ship in a dinghy.  The sidekick commented,
"We're sinking into the oui!"  The Inspector glubbed in his last breath,
"Don' say 'oui', say 'sea'."

Well -- properly pronounced the "a" would shift to a darkish "o" sound.
Spelling is not fixed for Bavarian like it's for "High german".
Gramatically there is more in there -- The Bavarian "hast" actually
includes the "du". "Haben sie" = "hams", "hat er" = "hod a" (putting the
o sound in writing here).

were soccer-like games but not persistent teams and rankings.  He said
that was not just a coincidence but a conscious campaign by the business
owners to instill corporate values in the workers (i.e., being a "team
player").  Thus why so many teams were founded and sponsored by companies.

They're all out chasing Britany; that's why they're not at home. At
least until their wives learn to start sending these emails that say,
"Hey You, I'm &lt;Name&gt;. My friend gave me your email..." Eventually, the
Brownian motion in the total population of the husband/wife set will
settle to its minimum-disturbance level as the individual units
recombine into stable pairs (which implies a drop to minimum temperature
- take <EM>that</EM> as you will), and the spams will stop, or at least
decrease greatly.

I'm not convinced they have the right order of definition there: as far

penis (and, if you think about it, it makes more sense that way anyway).

<pre><strong>'Said Hanrahan'

"We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   In accents most forlorn,
Outside the church, ere Mass began,
   One frosty Sunday morn.

The congregation stood about,
   Coat-collars to the ears,
And talked of stock, and crops, and drought,
   As it had done for years.

"It's looking crook," said Daniel Croke;
   "Bedad, it's cruke, me lad,
For never since the banks went broke
   Has seasons been so bad."

"It's dry, all right," said young O'Neil,
   With which astute remark
He squatted down upon his heel
   And chewed a piece of bark.

And so around the chorus ran
   "It's keepin' dry, no doubt."
"We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "Before the year is out."

"The crops are done; ye'll have your work
   To save one bag of grain;
  From here way out to Back-o'-Bourke
   They're singin' out for rain.

"They're singin' out for rain," he said,
   "And all the tanks are dry."
The congregation scratched its head,
   And gazed around the sky.

"There won't be grass, in any case,
   Enough to feed an ass;
There's not a blade on Casey's place
   As I came down to Mass."

"If rain don't come this month," said Dan,
   And cleared his throat to speak --
"We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "If rain don't come this week."

A heavy silence seemed to steal
   On all at this remark;
And each man squatted on his heel,
   And chewed a piece of bark.

"We want an inch of rain, we do,"
   O'Neil observed at last;
But Croke "maintained" we wanted two
   To put the danger past.

"If we don't get three inches, man,
   Or four to break this drought,
We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "Before the year is out."

In God's good time down came the rain;
   And all the afternoon
On iron roof and window-pane
   It drummed a homely tune.

And through the night it pattered still,
   And lightsome, gladsome elves
On dripping spout and window-sill
   Kept talking to themselves.

It pelted, pelted all day long,
   A-singing at its work,
Till every heart took up the song
   Way out to Back-o'-Bourke.

And every creek a banker ran,
   And dams filled overtop;
"We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "If this rain doesn't stop."

And stop it did, in God's good time;
   And spring came in to fold
A mantle o'er the hills sublime
   Of green and pink and gold.

And days went by on dancing feet,
   With harvest-hopes immense,
And laughing eyes beheld the wheat
   Nid-nodding o'er the fence.

And, oh, the smiles on every face,
   As happy lad and lass
Through grass knee-deep on Casey's place
   Went riding down to Mass.

While round the church in clothes genteel
   Discoursed the men of mark,
And each man squatted on his heel,
   And chewed his piece of bark.

"There'll be bush-fires for sure, me man,
   There will, without a doubt;
We'll all be rooned," said Hanrahan,
   "Before the year is out."

It's all about the music, dude. It <em>  obviously  </em> (since we're going to go
off the bugf*ck end of the guessing spectrum) refers to the 15th century
ballad "Captain Wedderburn" - capably redone by Great Big Sea.

<blockquote><pre>A nobleman's fair daughter
Came down a narrow lane
Met with Captain Wedderburn
Keeper of the game.

"Now my young, fair miss
If it wasn't for the law,
Then you and I in a bed might lie,
Roll-me-over-next-to-the-wall,
Roll-me-over-next-to-the-wall."

The Center for Disease Control has issued a warning about a new virulent strain of a sexually transmitted disease.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
This disease is contracted through dangerous and high risk behavior. The disease is called Gonorrhea Lectim (pronounced "gonna re-elect him").
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Many victims have contracted it after having been screwed for the past 4 years, in spite of having taken measures to protect themselves from this especially virulent disease.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Cognitive sequelae of individuals infected with Gonorrhea Lectim include, but are not limited to:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Antisocial personality disorder traits; delusions of grandeur with a distinct messianic flavor; chronic mangling of the English language; extreme cognitive dissonance; inability to incorporate new information; pronounced xenophobia; inability to accept responsibility for actions; exceptional cowardice masked by acts of misplaced bravado; uncontrolled facial smirking; ignorance of geography and history; tendencies toward creating evangelical theocracies; and a strong propensity for categorical, all-or nothing behavior.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The disease is sweeping Washington. Naturalists and epidemiologists are amazed and baffled that this malignant disease originated only a few years ago in a Texas Bush.

The Utah state legislature challenges a University of Utah ban against
concealed firearms on campus, saying the university does not have the
authority to restrict guns further than the state does.  Opponents raise
the prospect of disgruntled students shooting professors or chilling free
speech.  Proponents argue said professors (and women, and janitors) have

I have a brain twister of a question for you.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was reading your article on Bluetooth and Mobile phones.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Is it possible to write a program in the computer which captures the
digits being dialled from the (Nokia or whatever) mobile phone and
also preferably the ID of the phone and send that information to a
file on the computer in as close to real time as possible.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I would really appreciate your help. There may even be a dollar or so
in it for an enterprising person.

Yes and no, depending on what you mean.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you mean that you want to grab this information from any phone within range, even if they are not yours, then no, it's not possible:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
"To use most of the services on a mobile (or most Bluetooth devices, as far as I can tell), the mobile and the computer must first be paired. Basically, this involves both having the same PIN code entered -- just imagine how horrible it would be if anyone could browse around the files on your phone, or use your computer as an Internet gateway."
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That would be a new horrible idea that had not occurred to me, but fortunately the creators of bluetooth were prepared for it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If, on the other hand, you mean that you have a number of phones that you use for different purposes, then yes, it is possible to find out which phone numbers have been dialled, or from which numbers calls have been received, and to log them.

Now, with this statement, and the mention of 'Marketing' you have helped me to categorise your question better - we answer questions for a much larger audience than just the individual querent, which is why you have received so much help from me so far.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I would like to warn our readers that it is possible to be subjected to spam via bluetooth by simply walking within range of a device. There is a bit of a trend where people send strangers random messages in the form of empty vcards, where the name field is used to carry the message.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I doubt this is of any particular interest to our friend in marketing, however, as this kind of abuse was foreseen by the makers of mobile phones: file transfers of any nature are turned off by default, and must be authorised in any event. It is only when a phone is paired with a computer - i.e., that you have specifically told it to trust a computer - that you can have any degree of automation.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The range of bluetooth devices (10 metres) is too low for this to be a realistic marketing vehicle. The only real use I can imagine, if it were possible to snoop unauthorised on the numbers being dialled on a phone, is that of the jealous spouse who wishes to spy on their loved one.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Because we are the answer gang, I'll go beyond our 'Linux questions only' charter for this case.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If this is your intended use, you should first be aware that this kind of jealousy is usually self-fulfilling: it starts out without basis, but the accused eventually decides to commit the crime for which they are being punished. It is, quite honestly, difficult for me to imagine this kind of mindset, as there are so few who have as much to offer as I do, so my advice to a person with these inclinations would be to improve yourself and your outlook on life to the point where you, like me, have so few competitors that jealousy is simply unfathomable.

"This Intent To Package posting was guaranteed to raise a bit of a

FOR ANYONE WHO WONDERED WHERE THIS TRADITION STARTED - TRUE STORY SANTA TOLD ME SO
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
One particular Christmas a long time ago, Santa was getting ready for his
annual trip, but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones, so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. Then, Mrs. Claus told him that her Mum was coming to visit.This stressed Santa even more. Then when he went to harness the reindeer, he found three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out heaven knows where.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the
toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys everywhere. So, frustrated Santa went back into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered that someone had drank all of his liquor and there was nothing left to drink. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it broke into a thousand pieces. Santa went to get the broom and found that the mice had eaten the straw from which it was made.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Just then the doorbell rang and Santa cussed his way to the door. He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said cheerfully, "Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a wonderful day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?"
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree.

Subject: Judge slams spammers with $1-billion judgment

A federal judge in Iowa has awarded a small ISP more than $1 billion in
damages in what's believed to be the largest judgment ever against
spammers. The case was brought by Robert Kramer, whose company provides
e-mail service to about 5,000 customers, and who filed suit after his
inbound mail servers were jammed with as many as 10 million spam-mails a day
in 2000. Citing federal racketeering laws (RICO) and the Iowa Ongoing
Criminal Conduct Act, U.S. District Judge Charles R. Wolle ordered AMP
Dollar Savings of Mesa, Ariz., to pay $720 million; Cash Link Systems of
Miami, Fla., $360 million; and TEI Marketing Group, also of Florida,
$140,000. "It's definitely a victory for all of us that open up our e-mail
and find lewd and malicious and fraudulent e-mail in our boxes every day,"
said Kramer, who is unlikely to ever collect on the judgments.  [AP/*Wall
Street Journal*, 20 Dec 2004; NewsScan Daily, 20 Dec 2004]

Dang, caught. I couldn't remember whether it was 'daoibh' or 'dhaoibh' (which is silly, because it's the same for 'duit' vs. 'dhuit').

Hmmm. Being of black Irish descent doesn't help me when the phrasing
gets complex and Google's not nearly as much help this time. Um...:

I think where you're getting 'greetings' is that the Irish for goodbye is 'sl&aacute;n' (actually, 'sl&aacute;n leat': may you be healthy).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
'Beannachta&iacute;' literally means 'blessings', but in common usage it's usually taken to mean 'be well'. (A Latin loan word, fact fans).

Mmmm, I'd want to suggest something about a new year, except that it
appears that new year would be either "an bhliain &uacute;r" or "an athbhliain".

'&Aacute;th' is a word I can't translate off the top of my head. It means 'superior' or 'higher'. Town is 'baile', city is 'baile &aacute;tha'. ('Baile' is also a Latin loan word, I think. It might not look it at first glance, because Irish has no direct 'v' sound, but the accusative form 'an bhaile' sounds too close to 'villa' to be a coincidence).

But the implication that as a standalone word, "year" has the undertone
of vintage I find least surprising. Grin. Altavista's Babelfish doesn't
do Gaelic, I'd bet good sheckles that Arthur Dent's does, though. I
mean, it translates Vogon poetry, doesn't it?

Heh. It wouldn't have helped out at the last Christmas party I was at. An old guy (with no teeth) decided to tell me a story, and I had to watch him closely to have any idea of what he was saying.

O'Leary showed up at Mass one Sunday and the priest almost fell down
when he saw him. O'Leary had never been seen in church in his life.
After Mass, the priest caught O'Leary and said "O'Leary, I am so glad
you decided to come to Mass, what made you come?" O'Leary said, "I got
to be honest with you Father, a while back, I misplaced my hat and I
really, really love that hat. I know that Shaunassy had one just like
mine and I knew that Shaunassy came to church every Sunday. I also knew
that Shaunassy had to take off his hat during Mass, and I figured he
would leave it in the back of church. So, I was going to leave after
Communion and steal Shaunassy's hat." The priest said, "Well, O'Leary, I
notice that you didn't steal Shaunassy's hat. What changed your mind?"
O'Leary said "Well, after I heard your sermon on the 10 commandments, I
decided that I didn't need to steal Shaunassy's hat." The priest gave
O'Leary a big smile and said "After I talked about Thou Shalt Not Steal,
you decided you would rather do without your hat than burn in Hell,
right?" O'Leary shook his head and said "No, Father, after you talked
about Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, I remembered where I left my
hat!"

Three Lutheran ministers are having dinner at a restaurant when the
Archangel Gabrial approaches and points to one of them. "I HAVE A GIFT
FOR YOU," the angel says. "BUT YOU MUST CHOOSE: INFINITE WISDOM OR A
MILLION DOLLARS?" Being amongst Lutheran ministers, the man chooses
wisdom, and Gabrial dissapears in a puff. "So?" one of the ministers
asks with awe in his voice, "what do you know now that you didn't know
before?" He answers: "I should have taken the money."

A man, while playing on the front nine of a complicated golf course,
became confused as to where he was on the course. Looking around, he saw
a lady playing ahead of him. He walked up to her, explained his
confusion and asked her if she knew what hole he was playing. "I'm on
the 7th hole," she replied, "and you are a hole behind me. So you must
be on the 6th hole." He thanked her and went back to his golf. On the
back nine, the same thing happened and he approached her again with the
same request. "I'm on number 14, and you're still a hole behind, so you
must be on the 13th hole." Once again he thanked her and returned to his
play. He finished his round and went to the clubhouse where he saw the
same lady sitting at the end of the bar. He asked the bartender if he
knew the lady. The bartender said that she was a sales lady and played
the course often. He approached her and said, "Let me buy you a drink in
appreciation for your help. I understand that you're in the sales
profession. I'm in sales also. What do you sell?" "I'll tell you, but
you're going to laugh," she replied. "No, I won't." "Well, if you must
know," she answered, "I work for Tampax." With that, he laughed so hard
he almost fell off the bar stool. "See," she said. "I knew you'd laugh!"
"That's not what I'm laughing at," he replied, "I'm a salesman for
Preparation H, so I'm still a hole behind you."
