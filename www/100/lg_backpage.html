I *told* you not to read it, didn't I? And did you listen? Boy, I bet
you went right out and played in the mud when your Mom told you not to.
It's kids like you who are responsible for the mess our society is in!

Robos says that his mail to "tag@" got swallowed up, so I'm just
checking. Move along, nothing to see here.

Well, *if* you're going to be formal, you might as well address me by my
rightful title - "Your Sublime Imperial Majesty, King of Kings, Ruler of
the Known Universe and the Reaches Beyond and the Sun and the Stars,
Light of the World, Power of the Trinity, the Earth's Rightful Ruler,
Elect of the Gods, as revealed to us in his wondrous person. And, like,
just a generally cool dude besides."

Or you could just stick with "Ben". Most people find it simpler, for
some odd reason.

If you're _really_ lucky, you'll be able to fly by and drop lightly pieces

Oh _Fly-By_......

Boy, Thomas; no matter how hard I try, I _still_ can't get the point
across to you. We lightly drop _flies_ into the waiting mouths, etc.
Hasn't your Mum ever mentioned not keeping your mouth open for that very
reason?

Yeah, but she was too busy fly fishing, Ben.

I write the recently-revived series "The Linux Weekend Mechanic", which was
started by John Fisk (the founder of Linux Gazette) in 1996 and continued
until 1998.  I'm also a member of The Answer Gang.

<P> I was born in Hammersmith (London UK) in 1983.  When I was 13, I moved to
the sleepy, thatched roofed, village of East Chaldon in the county of Dorset.
I am very near the coast (at Lulworth Cove) which is where I used to work.

<P> I first got interested in Linux in 1996 having seen a review of it in a
magazine (Slackware 2.0). I was fed up with the instability that the then-new
operating system Win95 had and so I decided to give it a go.
Slackware 2.0 was great. I have been a massive Linux enthusiast ever
since.  I ended up with running SuSE on both my desktop and laptop computers.

<P> While at school (<A HREF="www.purbeck.dorset.sch.uk">The Purbeck
School</A>, Wareham in Dorset), I was actively involved in setting up two
Linux proxy servers (each running Squid and SquidGuard).  I also set up
numerous BASH scripts which allowed web-based filtering to be done via
e-mail, so that when an e-mail was received, the contents of it were added to
the filter file. (Good old BASH -- I love it)

<P> I am now 18 and studying at University (Southampton Institute, UK), on a
course called HND Business Information Technology (BIT). So far, it's great.

<P> Other hobbies include reading. I especially enjoy reading plays (Henrik
Ibsen, Chekhov, George Bernard Shaw), and I also enjoy literature (Edgar Allan
Poe, Charles Dickens, Jane Austin to name but a few).

<P> I enjoy walking, and often go on holiday to the Lake District, to a place
called Keswick. There are numerous "mountains", of which "Great Gable" is my
most favourite.

<P> I am also a keen musician. I play the piano in my spare time. 

<P> I listen to a variety of music. I enjoy listening to
Rock (My favourite band is "Pavement" (lead singer:
Stephen Malkmus). I also have a passion for 1960's
psychedelic music (I hope to purchase a copy of
"Nuggets" reeeeaaall soon).
