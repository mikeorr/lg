From a conversation I had yesterday with a man in his 80s that I met on
the street; all this in a slow, unhurried Southern accent.
</p>

<p>
  I used to work f' the Forestry Service, y'know. A man there - he must
  be dead b'now - tole me once: "Never hire a man t'do a job o'work for
  you who eats salt herrin' for breakfast, rolls his own cig'rettes, er
  wears a straw hat. Reason bein', he's either chasin' his hat down th'
  road, rollin' a cig'rette, er lookin' fer a drink o'water!"

  "Ever'body says words different," said Ivy. "Arkansas folks says 'em
  different, and Oklahomy folks says 'em different. And we seen a lady
  from Massachusetts, an' she said 'em differentest of all. Couldn' hardly
  make out what she was sayin'."

Regional accents can be very hard to judge even for a native - e.g., the
average Californian probably wouldn't be able to identify a north
Georgia drawl or a Texas twang... might be able to tell one from the
other, though - which isn't much to boast about, given that those two
average more than a thousand miles apart. They're going to be
essentially impossible when presented in written form - unless the
writer has Mark Twain's gift for conveying accents... which I can't lay
claim to. So you're <em>definitely</em> climbing a steep hill. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> No bonus
points for guessing "Texas", though - that's the most likely guess for a
non-American about some unknown American regional accent.
</p>

<p>
For the record, it was pretty similar to this, although a bit slower:

</p>

<p>
(A lot of accents are disappearing these days; people move around and
resettle quite a lot. E.g., if you want to hear a real Florida accent,
you have to go at least 20 or 30 miles inland and then search fairly
hard; the coast is all populated by Yankees now. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

&gt; 
&gt; No kidding. Both times I was in America, I was asked numerous times
&gt; which state I was from. My son's mother thought that was extremely
&gt; amusing, and on her honeymoon in Las Vegas told everyone who asked
&gt; that she was from Washington.

Boston, MA would have been a totally safe bet. Ditto New York. (I'm
pretty sure that the Irish in those places are still allowing the rest
of us to live there, although I may be wrong.) Just a couple of miles
away by water from southern Brooklyn is a place called Breezy Point,
a.k.a. The Irish Riviera - 60%+ Irish (had to look that last bit up,
which also brought up Squantum, MA - 65% Irish.)

&gt; On the other hand, on the flight over the second time I asked the
&gt; woman seated beside me which state she was from and it turned out she
&gt; was actually also Irish (but had lived in the US for most of her life
&gt; - the Donegal accent only emerged for 'Donegal' and quickly
&gt; retreated), and had spent most of the last 10 years living in the same
&gt; 20 mile radius as me <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
[LOL] Cue the "earthworms in love" story. That's just wonderful.
