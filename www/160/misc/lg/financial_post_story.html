In the headers, one notes:

<p>
So, the headers claim that it came from a typical throwaway GMail
account (though that might be a lie), but in any event the mail somehow
ended up at Canada.com, which is a commerical outfit billed as "Canadian
news, entertainment, television, newspapers, free email and more".  
So, in addition to blacklisting the (alleged) GMail sender, I attempted
to contact "abuse@canada.com" and "postmaster@canada.com", both of which
are RFC-required mail drops for any domain that does SMTP mail.
</p>

<p>
Why?  Because I really don't like having to blacklist entire large mail
concerns, just because one bad apple sneaked abusive mail through.
Those mail drops <em>are</em> the canonical places to get a provider's
attention to exactly such problems.  So, what happened next?
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
  This message was created automatically by mail delivery software. 
 
  A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its 
  recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed:
 
  postmaster@canada.com                                                         
     SMTP error from remote mail server after RCPT TO<img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":&lt;">postmaster@canada.com&gt;:

</pre>


<p>
So, wow!  They've decided to <em>disable</em> postmaster, and to ignore the
abuse mailbox to the point where the software automatically disabled
delivery.  Well, if they want to completely disregard key RFC
requirements on all SMTP senders -- requirements so key that you need to 
go out of your way to <em>disable</em> them in commodity SMTP software -- then
my server doesn't need to hear from them again.
</p>

<p>
So much for Canada.com.  <strong>plonk</strong>

<p>
Searching on one of the more distinctive parts of this canned e-mail, 
one can easily figure out the rest of the story:  It seems likely that,
a couple of years ago, a mentally disturbed (classic schizophrenic)
person, whose real name we probably don't have, either saw or heard
about a flash-in-the-pan 2005 science-fiction / thriller movie called
"The Island", starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson.  
</p>

<p>
In that movie, two citizens of a future, toxic-contaminated world win a
lottery prize to visit an uncontaminated paradise called "The Island".
Much plot follows, with the protoganists eventually finding out that
the entire setup of their lives is a ruse; that they themselves are
vat-grown clones about to be harvested for their organs at hidden
medical floors at "The Island", escape, and so on.
</p>

<p>
Somehow, the author of the recent e-mail apparently developed a fixation
that at least part of the premise of this fiction was real, and has set
on an Internet crusade to let us all know that Scarlett Johansson is a
clone -- rather than going back onto his meds, as he should.
</p>

<p>
The e-mail is just loopy enough that you can find copies of it willingly
hosted, and discussed, widely around the Internet.
</p>

<p>
And somewhere, the sender has been madly cramming his schizophrenic production
out through unguarded mail relays, incessantly over the last few years,
and otherwise going quietly nuts.
