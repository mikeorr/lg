<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Larry Ayers</H4>
Larry Ayers lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare
prairie plants, as well as growing shiitake mushrooms. He is also
struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

Gerd Bavendiek</H4>
Gerd has worked as a software engineer with various flavors of Unix since 1988.
In 
1994 he realized that using Linux could make his every-day work more
convenient.
Since that time he has used Linux and various GNU-software. He lives in Essen,
Germany. 
In my spare time I build model-steam engines using real hardware: lathe,
milling-machine and a lot of hand tools.

to complete a graduate degree in Computer Science before
entering a Medical Informatics Fellowship. In his dwindling
free time he and his wife Faith enjoy hiking and camping in

ago.

inactive) maintainer of his research group's web pages at <a

Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.

<IMG ALIGN=CENTER ALT="" SRC="../gx/rose.gif">
My assistant, Amy Kukuk, did all the work again this month.
She's so good to me. Thank you, Amy.

<P>
Vacations are fun and wonderful, but mine sure put me behind schedule with my
<I>Linux Journal</I> work. My grandchildren are even smarter and more
beautiful than I remembered. It was a much needed break, and I expect to
get caught up this week. :-) 
<P> 
<I>Linux Journal</I> is expanding to 116 pages
and going to perfect binding with the October issue. No wonder I'm working
so hard!

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT ALT="" SRC="./gx/bmw.gif">
Riley is going off again this Saturday for our
annual week-long motorcyle trek with friends. This time I'm staying home.
:-( Oh, well, perhaps next year. (Needless to say, our motorcycle is a BMW.)
<P> 
Have fun!
