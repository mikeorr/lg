Subject: lang="utf-8" makes Firefox use an ugly font
To: editor@linuxgazette.net

<p>
Hello editor,
</p>

<p>
In the source of many of the HTML pages of the <em>Linux Gazette</em>, the 
&lt;html&gt; tag contains 'lang="utf-8" xml:lang="utf-8"'.  This has the 
effect of making Firefox think that this is some exotic language 
and it falls back to a simple, smaller, uglier, unaliased font.
For example on <a href="../../../150/index.html">http://linuxgazette.net/150/index.html</a> .
</p>

<p>
On <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/</a> the W3 suggests that the &lt;html&gt; tag 
contain 'xml:lang="en" lang="en"'.  When I replace the existing 
attributes with these, then the page gets shown fine for me.
</p>

<p>
(The possible reason that only I see this problem is that I've set 
Firefox to always use my chosen font and ignore the fonts of the 
Web site.  This works fine on almost all Web sites.  Only on Japanese 
sites and on <em>Linux Gazette</em> do I still get this ugly unaliased font.)
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

<p>
Benno

That's odd - my Firefox and my Mozilla browser from 'mozilla-suite' both
display it just fine. Or perhaps I'm just used to ugly fonts everywhere
- the <em>LG</em> site just looks normal to me.

That sounds completely reasonable. Perhaps there's a better font you can
use? Also, looking at my font setup in Firefox, I see that the 'Allow
pages to choose their own fonts' box is checked - so you may well have
spotted the problem right there.

<p>
Having the 'Allow pages to choose their own fonts' <em>not</em> checked was 
not the problem.  When clicking on the 'Fonts for:' selection box, 
all the way down there's the choice "Other languages".  For that 
item I had Times selected for Serif, Helvetica for Sans-serif, and 
Courier for Monospace.  After selecting there the defaults, the 
<em>Linux Gazette</em> pages now display fine for me, in my chosen font.
</p>

<p>
Thanks for helping to clear this up.
</p>

<p>
However, I'd still like to suggest you replace "utf-8" in the 'lang' 
attributes with "en", because utf-8 is not a language, and the 
language the <em>Linux Gazette</em> pages are written in is English.

Да, grundsätzlich. 絶対.

Especially in those discussions about the Türkçe language that we had
recently, or those bits of Russian that I (or Jimmy, who adds Polish to
the mix) quote once in a while - or when we have authors like Anders
Andreasen, who is the webmaster for the hydrogen storage facility at
Risø... or even our own Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer.
</p>

<p>
<em>LG</em>, for those Missing The Point (since I've carried the anvil this
far...), is an international publication - and even more to the point,
we get mail from people all over the world on a regular basis. Assuming
that it's English-only mistakes the purpose and the point of this
webzine. We're as international as the Linux community - and damned
proud of it.

I think he was pointing out that utf-8 is not a language! 
</p>

<p>
Benno: 
Linguistically speaking this you are correct in asserting that
utf-8 is not a language but the attribute is "lang" not "language"!
</p>

<p>
The "lang" attribute refers to the <em>encoding</em> of an HTML page. Very
often pages are encoded in a way that is specific to a certain
language, which is why the attribute is called "lang".
