Non-linux machines: any recommendations for this set-up though running on
Windows XP? 
</p>
</strong>

<p>
[Ben] - You bet: switch to Linux. :)
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Amber, I'm not the world's top expert when it comes to Windows, but I've
got quite a lot of experience and expertise with it under my belt.
Speaking from that perspective and to the best of my knowledge, there
are a few minor things that you can do in this direction - i.e., a pair
of video cards and even multiple keyboards attached to a single CPU -
but all of this hardware is still tied to one session, i.e. one person
using all of it. There are some uses for this type of configuration, but
it's a completely different kettle of fish.
</p>

<p>
As far as creating a robust, serious piece of software that will do this
under Windows, or even a project toward that end, it's simply not going
to happen: Microsoft would need to open-source their OS, and that's not
in the cards. This is one of the many reasons that so many people and so
many companies <em>are</em> switching to Linux: in the world of Open Source, if
you have this kind of a requirement, you can either find someone
somewhere who has already done it (and perhaps fund them to tweak it to
your exact specs) - or you can do it yourself (perhaps by hiring a
little programming muscle if the capability does not exist in-house.)
It's a different - and we believe, better - approach to computing.
</p>

<p>
Best of luck in your search, and we'll be happy to hear from you if you
decide to make the switch at some point in the future.

You have very interesting timing, Maxim; one of our readers, Jos&eacute;

dual-video cards. I suspect that what you're asking is possible; take a

Probably not news to most LWN readers, but the font article should be
ignored: it is describing technologies that are no longer in common
use. Goodbye and good riddance to the XLFD (X Logical Font
Description). Contemporary applications, toolkits, and desktops use the
fontconfig library instead.
</pre>
<strong>
<p>
What I will say to that is it's true in part -- but it's only very
<strong>recent</strong> applications which aren't using the XLFD (that's the long-form
font names).  Many applications still using XLFD (think xterm, rxvt,
etc).
</p>

<p>
I certainly don't agree that the article should be ignored.

I found the subversion article by Muthaiah is outstanding. It covered
topics that the Subversion book did not.  I had a scenario (regarding
library mismatch) described in the "Post-installation tips" section and
have been strugling. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
</p>

<p>
This is my output:
</p>
<pre>
[root at localhost test]# ldd /usr/lib/httpd/modules/mod_dav_svn.so | grep apr
        libaprutil-0.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libaprutil-0.so.0 (0x00cb2000)
        libapr-0.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libapr-0.so.0 (0x00man 6a5000)
[root at localhost test]# ldd /usr/sbin/httpd | grep apr
        libaprutil-0.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libaprutil-0.so.0 (0x002ba000)
        libapr-0.so.0 =&gt; /usr/lib/libapr-0.so.0 (0x005ca000)
</pre>
<p>
For some reason, these apr libraries point to the older versions (while I
have newer version compiled and installed during the Apache 2 installation
on Red Hat Linux 4 - by default RH does not have apxs  and I could not
uninstall the non-conventionally installed Apache. I had to reinstall Linux
leaving Apache out)
</p>

<pre>
[root at localhost lib]# ls -al libapr*
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     17 Jul 17 10:22 libapr-0.so.0 -&gt; libapr-0.so.0.9.4

-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  83260 Jun 16  2005 libaprutil-0.so.0.9.4
</pre>
<p>
Changing the soft links to point to newer versions would cause Apache not
to start.  Any suggestions on how to upgrade these apr libraries and force
both Apache and Subversion to use them?
</p>
</strong>

<p>
[Ramanathan] - You should not change the soft links to newer versions.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
You can try to recompile svn and use the --with-apr switch in the
configure script to point to the apache version of the apr. apxs can
also be a problem.

With a host of UNIX O/S there are often a lot of admin logs that get kept,
and grow until you do something about them.  Any of these in Linux?

<p>
[Ben] - Sure - in '/var/log', just like many other *nixen. Those aren't
much of a problem, though: most programs that create logs also create an
entry in '/etc/cron.{d,daily,monthly,weekly}' which rotates those logs at
that specified interval.

There's also the fact that this is one of the classic reasons for having
multiple partitions: even if '/var' does get filled up, '/' isn't
affected.

Hi Gang!
</p>

<p>
Another fantastic issue, maintaining this level of excellence must be
difficult, but please keep it up.
</p>

<p>
I was just reading the section regarding printers (fantastic idea -
disturbing the pool) and the description of the user dragging the My
Documents folder to the printer. Made me think of a guy I work with.
</p>

<p>
I have worked with him for four years, we have to use Windows (Blechh)
and use Citrix as a rule. I have patiently tried to teach this guy to
use cut and paste. For <strong>four</strong> years. Four LONG years. The other day I
sat with him for an hour copying and pasting, from lots of apps into
lots of other apps, just so he got the hang of it. He could actually do
it in the finish. Friday I caught him. Only one app open (IE) writing
stuff down a sheet of paper, he closed IE and opened Word and typed it
in. He believes - very strongly, and contrary to the demonstrated
evidence - that you can only have one app at a time open at once.
</p>

<p>
I no longer work in the same office as him, and I am sure that has led
to an increase in my expected lifespan. My hair has greyed and thinned
because of this man, and I should feel resentment, but I just feel pity.
I hear you cry "Why do you still help him?" well it's a bit like that
tricky puzzle in a text adventure, the one you just can't get past? It
just pulls you in, one day it will stick and he will understand. I am
not the only one to try, many have failed before me, but I am the most
persistent.
</p>

<p>
I spend my days yearning for my linux box. I should get another job.
</p>

<p>
Be well all,

No -- to do so is pointless since the mirrors of LG would have already

Greetings, Blizbor.  I can perhaps comment as the editor who did the
technical edit of Ed Neville's article (whom I am cc'ing).  You might
recognise my name from the several footnotes I added.
</p>

<p>
On the matter of controlling BIND9's caching nameserver functionality, 
please note that Mr Neville correctly and commendably qualified his
statement by saying that open access to caching is a problem of BIND9's 
_default installation_.  That is absolutely correct as stated, and a
very valuable point that should be heeded by all BIND9 users.

&gt; users.  To the author - in the bind manual is a chapter about "view"
&gt; keyword, I appreciate your work in writing this article - well done
&gt; about djb, but you missing trueth about bind.
</pre>
<p>
That would have been a very different article from the article Mr
Neville chose to write; _Linux Gazette_ has no wish to dictate the
scope of articles to authors.  We merely ask that they be clear and
accurate, so as to increase the wealth of understanding among our
readers, and are delighted to assist authors in hitting that target.  
</p>

<p>
Along those lines, you seem to have missed the fact that BIND9's 'view'
keyword actually <em>is</em> described within Mr Neville's article, courtesy of
the additional material I added in footnote number 1, referring any
interested readers to Rob Thomas's 'Secure BIND Template' for good
examples.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; In actual form article is unacceptable and should be removed.  I wish
&gt; you Linux Gazette never again put such poor quality material on your
&gt; pages.  Fix this asap - only those doing nothing arent doing mistakes.
&gt; 
&gt; (This is my personal opinion.)
</pre>
<p>
I say this as a sysadmin familiar both with DJBware and with its
open-source alternatives, who chooses to use BIND9 for nameservice on
various servers, and who has published in <em>LG</em> a primer on simple
DNS setup modes in BIND9 (<a href="../121/moen.html">http://linuxgazette.net/121/moen.html</a>):  
Bosh.  Bollocks.  Mr Neville's piece was technically adept and well
written.
</p>

<p>
(It also may be of interest that I'm a major devil figure for many 
of the less civil of DJB's coterie, because of critiques I have written
online.  E.g., Prof.  Bernstein's Web pages call me names on account of
those critiques.)

Can you explain any other errors you feel need resolving, if there are
technical mistakes it might be possible to alter it, but I think the
only point you want emphasised is that small mention of BIND.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; please note that Mr Neville correctly and commendably qualified his
&gt; statement by saying that open access to caching is a problem of
&gt; BIND9's  _default installation_.  That is absolutely correct as
&gt; stated, and a very valuable point that should be heeded by all BIND9

I knew there would be some flack if I did not! I've had this same old
discussion all over the place. The article is in no way about "my NS is
better than your NS", what I wrote is my experience of running a large
ISP's NS, it's what works well for us and our customers. The
introduction was to explain why I wrote it, if nothing else, the various
components helps the reader to understand a little about lookups in the
process.

If I may say so, I've learned a great deal from study of djbdns and from
reading technical pieces written by knowledgeable members of the DJBware
community.  In particular, I'll treat Jonathan deBoyne Pollard and Russ
Nelson to tall quaffs from their favourite beverages any day of the week,
out of gratitude.  You follow in their footsteps, and I'm glad to have 
"met" you.

Well, it gives me a rare distinction, actually:  I can ask people who
else they know who's mentioned by name in a major software licence?  ;-&gt;
The mean-spritedness doesn't bother me, in fact, but Dan's non-sequitur
evasion of my substantive critique did.  (Please pardon this URL, as I 
was a bit annoyed at the time:)

&gt; Greetings, Blizbor.  I can perhaps comment as the editor who did the
&gt; technical edit of Ed Neville's article (whom I am cc'ing).  You might
&gt; recognise my name from the several footnotes I added.
&gt;
&gt; On the matter of controlling BIND9's caching nameserver functionality, 
&gt; please note that Mr Neville correctly and commendably qualified his
&gt; statement by saying that open access to caching is a problem of BIND9's 
&gt; _default installation_.  That is absolutely correct as stated, and a
&gt; very valuable point that should be heeded by all BIND9 users.
</pre>
<p>
Greetings,
</p>

<p>
I'm a bit not precise in saying what I mean. Sometimes what I want to say
are a bit unkind.  The point of my mail is: nobody on the world is using
_default configuration_. Actually I think that default configuration of any
network demons should be crippled to the extent they are do start and do
extremely limited functionality on the loopback interface.  I found
referring to default configuration as primary source of principal mistake
of the article.  It can be done and should be said "it can be, but we will
keep focus on how to do that using djbdns because ...".  Wait ? I read that
article and why exactly it's worth to use DJB ... I still don't know.  I
must tell it again (emphasize) - from technical and editorial (samples,
config quotes, etc) article is good, however mistake on the beginning makes
it sounds different.  GIGO...

It's OK.  We try to work through to the substance, which is the
important thing.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; The point of my mail is: nobody on the world is using _default
&gt; configuration_.

<p>
I wish that were true, but for example a presentation by Dan Kaminski at
the 2005 LISA Conference in San Diego revealed the interim results of his 
project to study the world's Internet-reachable DNS servers -- including
the fact that a frighteningly large percentage are vulnerable to cache
poisoning:  I think the figure was well over 25% (would have to check).
</p>

<p>
You can also spot-check domains you know:  I think you'll find the
problem to be widespread.  For example, I just tried
<a href="http://www.dnsreport.com/tools/dnsreport.ch?domain=cocacola.com">http://www.dnsreport.com/tools/dnsreport.ch?domain=cocacola.com</a> .
Notice that both of the Coca Cola Company's are open to public recursive
queries.  Nameserver software versions were not available in that case,
but Kaminsky's results suggest that BIND8 versions for Unixes and
Windows still predominate.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Actually I think that default configuration of any network demons
&gt; should be crippled to the extent they are do start and do extremely
&gt; limited functionality on the loopback interface.
</pre>
<p>
I tend to agree with you, but that is not Mr Neville's responsibility,
especially since his piece wasn't about BIND9 in the first place.  To
the extent he referred to that software, his point was correct, well
stated, and properly qualified.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I found referring to default configuration as primary source of
&gt; principal mistake of the article.
</pre>
<p>
We will have to agree to disagree, since I see no mistake.  To the
contrary, Mr Neville was commendably careful -- and, incidentally, much
more helpful to BIND9 users than are many who actually write on that
subject.
</p>

<pre>
&gt; It can be done and should be said "it can be, but we will keep focus
&gt; on how to do that using djbdns because ...".
</pre>
<p>
I've read advocacy pieces, and this wasn't one.  
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Wait ? I read that article and why exactly it's worth to use DJB ... I
&gt; still don't know.
</pre>
<p>
I'd say the piece was more <em>how</em> to effectively use djbdns.  It should
be read in that spirit.
