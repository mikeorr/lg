The Irish is so bad it can only have come from Google Translate, but
it's fun to see spam in my (native? no, that implies first; national?)
language.

Jimmy, I'm sure you've seen this one from the Language Log, but others may
be amused:

====
Quadrilingual Garbage

<p>
This notice on the window of a shop selling a very special type of
life-extending egg in Hakone, Japan vies for the worst signage
translation we've ever seen.[...]

It's an alarming example of what can happen out there in the 
wild (so to speak).

<p>
Jimmy, I didn't realize that Irish wasn't your first language. Is that
normal in Ireland, or was there some unusual circumstance involved?
</p>

<p>
One of the things I've been doing - not as any formal project, but just
a loose visualization - is keeping a mental map of where spam comes from
and the sophistication level (which definitely has a per-country
component to it.) I've also found it interesting to see how fast, or how
slowly, that level of sophistication changes: the Chinese, for example,
don't seem to ever get beyond the "The weather here is wonderful. We
make stuff; buy it from us. Thank you" level. The Nigerians have kept up
with variations of "I'm a widow named Maryam Abacha with 30,000,000$
(THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS)", and they're clearly trying to learn to push
different buttons ("From SERGEANT JOHN SMITH in IRAQ", "I am WIDOW who
is about to GO TO GOD'S BOSOM"), but still pretty basic stuff.  The
Japanese nationalist/anti-US spam is hysterically funny ("Japan have
electrical space ray defeat America any time because eat fish is good
for brain and America weak from don't eat fish. World must defeat
America or they stop Japan from eat whale which make old people powerful
like 19 years old!"), while the Russians push a mind-bogglingly broad
array of services, from "Brick recycling in Rostov" and "Aquariums for
rent" to "Secretary who will also function as your lover" - but don't
seem to be in on the deeply-held secret that English is the language of
the web (but then, neither do the Greeks or the Vietnamese.) The Germans
seem to focus on either advertising degree mills OR sex services (it may
even be an 'AND' instead of an 'OR', for all I know...)
</p>

<p>
Then there's the whole *-phishing scene. A whole bunch of (mostly) clever
Poles, Russians, and other Slavs doing some very sophisticated social
hackery (unsurprisingly so; when I recently spoke to a Russian CS
graduate who was visiting the US, he expressed some shock at learning
that the US CS degree requirements *did not* include up-to-date social
engineering techniques. It seems that Russian schools have been teaching
these for at least a decade.) Unsurprisingly, it seems that combining a
very loose sense of ethics with a good education produces a very
sophisticated and highly successful criminal class.  There's a huge
amount of money powering this aspect of things...
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I could go on for a while, but this Irish spam is a great
example of somebody just starting out. "Loans to/by Christians" - awwww,
how cute. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> It seems that the Irish gift of blarney doesn't map to the
Internet Age all that well...

Yes, that's very much the norm. My father used to be very interested
in languages, and taught me little bits of French and Latin before I
ever learned a word of Irish.
</p>

<p>
Learning Irish natively is so far from the norm that there are
specific areas, collectively called the Gaeltacht, that have a special
status, etc. They hold summer schools in Irish every year, which are a
curious mix of the kids of the ultra rich and relatively poor kids on
scholarships (I was in the latter category <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Yeah. There was quite a disturbing mail on the corpora list where
someone's email account had clearly been broken into. I can imagine
that sort of targeting could be very successful (y'know, if they
figure out to not send those sorts of things to public mailing lists).

I think most of Ireland is too busy with Farmville to try such
things... (y'know, I saw a piece of software on sourceforge earlier to
automate something about Farmville - the mind boggles).

Fascinating - and yet, more or less predictable (as a major probability)
given Irish history.

Oh, they have; in fact, they've become quite smart about sliding into
vulnerable places, time slots, and attention/awareness failures. There's
a very interesting account at Boing-Boing about how Cory Doctorow
himself got phished - which makes one go "HMMM". I mean, he's a
technically-savvy guy who runs a site that's all about the <em>Zeitgeist</em>
of the net.culture - and <em>he</em> gets caught? Introspection time...
