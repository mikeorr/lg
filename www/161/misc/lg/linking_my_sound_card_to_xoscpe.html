Ben Okopnik recommended a software program called "xoscope" and gave a

I now have the sound card microphone input working and the Xoscope

Hi, Arild - nice to see you here!
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I can't offer a whole lot of help for this problem: your
problem doesn't have anything to do with Linux, just with the program's
interface. Like every other program in every other operating system,
'xoscope' has its own controls and adjustments - and I'm not all that
familiar with it. There are instructions in its manual page (go to the
terminal and type 'man xoscope'), which also contains a description of
the keys used to control it in the "RUN-TIME KEYBOARD CONTROLS" section.
</p>

<p>
I found that figuring it out is a lot easier when you have a steady
waveform to read - so I downloaded and ran a program called "siggen"
(written by our own Jim Jackson - it's quite the nifty gadget!) After
that, I started 'xoscope' and presto - I could see the waveform, and
didn't need to click 'Run' or anything else. I did need to adjust the
sensitivity to see more amplitude, but that's just how scopes work.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and - it's OK for the sound to come out of the speakers. That
doesn't interfere with the operation of 'xoscope' at all.
</p>

<p>
Good luck!
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a couple of minutes of messing around with it
produced good results. Here's a screenshot with 'siggen', 'xoscope', and
the 'xoscope' man page:

</p>

<p>
I ran 'siggen' and set the frequency to 60Hz and the gain to 1.0; then,
I ran 'xoscope', set the base level of channel 1 about half-way up in
the top half of the display using the ']' key, and raised the vertical
gain with the '}' key. Channel 2 (selected with '2') got much the same
treatment on the bottom half of the screen. Last, I hit the space bar to
set the trigger mode to "Run", which 'froze' the two waveforms on the
screen. Not bad, even though the sound card is clipping the input signal
- which I'm sure could be resolved with a bit more messing around.

Nope. Just the program. The fact that you have a way to interact with
your computer - whether via menus, command line, icons, or whatever -
means that you're not having a problem with Linux. If you <em>were</em> having
a problem with Linux, you'd get some high-powered artillery backing you
up: there's a bunch of smart, knowledgeable people on this list who are
quite expert in various aspects of Linux. Since you're not, there isn't
a huge amount of help available - except, perhaps, in the
'xoscope'-related forums:

&gt; For example  starting at the Ubuntu desk top  where is the command line

<p>
In the terminal - and it would be 'siggen' (lower case.) In fact, in my
opinion, it's best to run any program that you're not sure of in the
terminal; that way, if there are any error messages or warnings, you'll
see them printed out.

I meant to say  I am missing something fundamental in my comprehension  of 
Linux. Not that  a fundamental parto of Linux was missing.
</p>

<p>
I found a terminal and opened it. Typed in siggen.
It then told me to type in   &lt; sudo apt-get install tripwire  &gt;.
?? Wazzat?    I don't know about any tripwire.
It then tells me to bash siggen.  Its confusing to me.
</p>

<p>
What's with the bashing???   Smash it with my fist or use a hammer?? 
&lt;smile&gt;
Come on;  that's teenage jargon of the lower class sort. Not worthy of real 
engineers.
</p>

<p>
And who but engineers would try to use an oscope in the first place.
Hence my earlier question to you about a lexicon for us Windoze  refugees 
trying to get ahead in the computer world.
</p>

<p>
Then it prints [sudo] password for Arild but when I enter  the password it 
comes back at me saying the program (password) is currently not installed. 
Well of course not;  it's a password!
</p>

<p>
Again it's a lot of insider jargon and verbal short cuts.  I'm not a twenty 
year old college student into jive ( or should that be linux ) talk.   I do 
speak  the Queen's english properly, although it is my second language.
</p>

<p>
Yeah  I eventually  got it but it took a while. &lt;sigh&gt;
</p>

<p>
I am trying to promote a shift to Linux but this kind of thing puts of many 
of my contemporaries off.   They are barely comfortable with windows  but at 
least microsoft sometimes tries to use plain english.   This is probably one 
of th ebig stumboling blocks  to widespread acceptance  by  the genral 
population.  Two of my friends  uninstalled Ubuntu for that very reason. It 
was hard enough to convince them to try it at all.

After i finally got the Tripwire thing going after a lot of minutes it get 
to the point of askign me for a key phrase only to reject it by saying it is 
not  an existing file or directory.   ?????????

<p>
Very frustrating.  People my age are not usually  possessed of a

<p>
Arild, I honestly have no idea of what you're doing on your system -
except that your results make no sense whatsoever. 'tripwire' has
absolutely nothing to do with 'siggen', and no conceivable action
related to 'siggen' would cause the system to tell you to install
'tripwire'.
</p>


<pre>

</pre>

<p>
Well, no - it didn't tell you to "bash siggen". I'd appreciate it if
you'd actually copy and paste the messages that you're getting - that's
standard protocol when asking for help - rather than (mis)quoting what
you saw.
</p>


<pre>

&gt; &lt;smile&gt;
&gt; Come on;  that's teenage jargon of the lower class sort. Not worthy of

</pre>

<p>
What's with the misreading? That's not worthy of real engineers. You
wouldn't just pick some random numbers to put on a schematic, right? In
fact, you'd be very precise about part numbers, values, tolerances, and
so on - at least if you wanted to be understood. The same applies here,
to an even greater degree.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And who but engineers would try to use an oscope in the first place.
&gt; Hence my earlier question to you about a lexicon for us Windoze  refugees 
&gt; trying to get ahead in the computer world.
</pre>

<p>
Can you show me the kind of lexicon you're talking about for Windows?
Once you do, I'll be happy to point you to an equivalent one for Linux.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Then it prints [sudo] password for Arild but when I enter  the password 
&gt; it comes back at me saying the program (password) is currently not

</pre>

<p>
Again, you're misquoting. I realize you're frustrated, but I'd
appreciate it if you didn't keep blasting us with your frustration
instead of supplying accurate information. "It" didn't print "[sudo]
password for Arild"; in fact, I have no idea what you saw except that
it wasn't what you've said here.
</p>

<p>
What it sounds like - and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong - is that
you didn't enter the password when you were prompted; instead, you typed
the word "password", possibly followed by your password, at the command
line. Unsurprisingly, you got an error message; random pounding on a
keyboard does that.
</p>

<p>
I have no idea how you got into this tripwire/sudo/password/etc. round
of errors, but whatever that's about, you need to stop, take a deep
breath, and reapproach it with care and attention. You know, just like
engineering.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Again it's a lot of insider jargon and verbal short cuts.  I'm not a 
&gt; twenty year old college student into jive ( or should that be linux ) 
&gt; talk.
</pre>

<p>
Y'know, that's pretty unpleasant language. It implies that the rest of
us are students who are into jargon, etc. I <strong>strongly</strong> suggest that you
stop venting your frustration here; this isn't the place for it, and
doing so will result in return unpleasantness.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I am trying to promote a shift to Linux but this kind of thing puts of 
&gt; many of my contemporaries off.
</pre>

<p>
You may consider yourself as promoting a shift to Linux; in reality,
given what you've said here, you're promoting a hostile attitude toward
it instead. In fact, you have a very serious flaw in your understanding
of how this works, and a badly-mistaken social approach based on that
flaw.
</p>

<p>
See, none of us gain anything if you or your friends use Linux, and we
lose nothing if you don't. Frankly, we don't really care. We <em>do</em> like
to foster a sense of community by helping people who have problems with
Linux, but we don't owe it to them; in fact, anyone coming here to ask
for help owes <em>us</em> - at least by the rules of common politeness. And
yet, we sometimes get people coming in here with a belligerent sense of
entitlement, <strong>demanding</strong> that we help them and throwing their
frustration at us as if to beat us "jargon-using students" into quaking
compliance with their demands.
</p>

<p>
People who do that usually get laughed at and ridiculed for their pains.
The only reason I've remained civil throughout is because you and I have
had pleasant off-list conversations - where, I note, you <em>never</em>
displayed behavior like this.
</p>

<p>
Now, you can either stomp out of here (which would be the classic
pusillanimous behavior in such cases), or you can start behaving in a
reasonable manner. That would include being polite, asking questions in
an informative manner - remember when I told you about that being an
important requirement? - and expressing gratitude for the help that
you're given (which, I note, you still owe: I've already helped you with
several issues, and you haven't said "thank you" yet.) <em>That</em> would be
behavior consistent with rationality and maturity worthy of a real
engineer.

I'm afraid I'm coming in late on this thread, and am not clear on what
Arild's problem is, either.  (Arild, my sincere regrets that you're
having a difficult time with something.)  I happened to spot one thing
in Ben's post I might usefully comment on -- even though I completely
lack the larger context of this discussion:

Back when I was spending time working with the extremely human-hostile, 
ponderous, cryptic intrusion detection system (IDS) called Tripwire,
written eons ago by Eugene Kim and Gene Spafford at Purdue University, I
learned it furnished a number of utilities to handle its crypto encoding
and signing of all files.  Chief among them was siggen(8), which
calculates CRC32, MD5, SHA1, and HAVAL hash values of any target file.
</p>

<p>
I have no idea what specific "it" advised Arild to install the Tripwire
package, but it (well, part of it) makes a weird, backwards kind of
sense, I suppose -- albeit I find it unlikely that Arild actually
intends to work with siggen or any other aspect of Tripwire.

<p>
If presented with a call to a command that bash can't find, the Ubuntu
flavour of apt will attempt to identify the package that would contain
said command, and recommend that the user "sudo apt-get install
$(package)". So in this case, it would appear that the package that was
found was tripwire, and when attempting to follow the instructions Arild
muddled up his password at the prompt and was presented with a confusing
message. At least, that's my understanding of the scenario, anyway.

Just to give a little context here: in a previous exchange, I told Arild
to install Jim Jackson's "siggen" and even gave him the specific command
line for doing so. Clearly, he failed to do that - so the
"command-not-found" program (that's its actual name, believe it or not)
told him (incorrectly) to install 'tripwire'.

And a reminder that one of the reason we ask people to be specific in
their problem reports is that the phrase "it didn't work" often <em>does</em>
conceal an utter failure to bother following instructions, leading to 
wasting of the helper's time, in addition to the un-diligent user.

First of all, I did not use the non-word "undiligent":  You did.

</pre>

<p>
First off, by not yelling (ALL-CAPITALS TEXT IS CONSIDERED TO BE
YELLING. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
Copying and pasting in Linux is easy: hold down the left mouse button
and drag the mouse over the text that you want to copy (the text will be
highlighted as you do this.) When you want to paste it, click both mouse
buttons at the same time; the pasted text will be inserted at the
current position of your cursor.
</p>

<p>
I suggest you practice this by opening up a terminal and starting an
editor (e.g., "nano" which is probably already installed on your
system), then writing something like "Hello, world!" and copying and
pasting a few dozen times to get familiar with the process.
</p>

<p>
You can also copy and paste from one window to another. The procedure is
exactly the same, except that you'll need to "move the focus" from the
first window to the second one between the two operations. That
procedure goes like this:
</p>

<pre>
1) Highlight the text in window 1.
2) Left-click anywhere in window 2.
3) Both-click anywhere in window 2.
</pre>

<p>
This is a basic procedure that's used dozens of times every day. Good
idea to get familiar with it.

Ben that is the problem.

I am quite familiar with cut and paste in Windows, but; . . . .

<p>
Whenever I try this in UBUNTU when I start to copy something into a
webmail window or change from one webmail to another email the first
window disappears. And nothing shows up when I click on &lt;paste&gt;.
Apparently this particular webmail my ISP uses doesn't allow multiple
windows being open simultaneously.  At least not inside webmail. Its all I
got to ork with.

<p>
This is why I gave step-by-step instructions in my last email, Arild:
copying and pasting is <strong>different</strong> between Windows and Linux. It really
is. I suggest that you read what I wrote, and follow the instructions so
that you become familiar with how it's done in Linux.
</p>


<pre>

<p>
Again, whatever it is that you're doing does not sound like standard
behavior for mail - including webmail. The webmail window disappears
when you try to paste into it? The only thing I can imagine is that
you're hitting some key combination (Alt-F4? Ctrl-C?) that makes it go
away. I can't think of any kind of normal copy-and-paste behavior that
would close a browser window.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; And nothing shows up when I click on &lt;paste&gt;.
</pre>

<p>
What's the &lt;paste&gt; that you're clicking on? If you read my instructions
- the ones that you quoted above - there's no "&lt;paste&gt;" to click on.
Whatever that "&lt;paste&gt;" may be, it's the wrong thing to do. Please try
following my instructions, then tell me what happened, and we'll be able
to go forwar from that.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Apparently this particular webmail my ISP uses doesn't allow multiple

<p>
Have you tried right-clicking on the link and opening it in a new tab or
window? That might be a good answer to this problem.
</p>

<p>
(The real answer would be not to use webmail - at least not via the
browser-based, which has its own set of behaviors. It's much better to
use one of the mail programs available under Linux.)
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I cannot cut and paste from one computer to the other.
</pre>

<p>
Let's be a bit more precise here: you haven't yet learned how to do so.
I assure you that you can - at least once you learn the method I've been
telling you about.

I think I might - if the Ubuntu desktop that Arild is using has the X
focus follows mouse behavior, it may appear as if the previous window
is being closed.
</p>

<p>
Arild, if you're forced for the moment to use webmail, you're clearly
using a web browser of some kind. It's probably Firefox. Instead of 
opening another browser window, try typing Ctrl-T to open another 
<em>tab</em>. That should get you past the problem of copy and paste that
you're working on with Ben.

The real difficulty with the cut and paste method is due to the fact that
xoscope is running on a different computer from what I use for webmail. So
when I get Ben's email its on my Windows only computer; but the program I
am trying to fix up is on the other computer. The only way I have at
present is to link them via webmail on  Wi Fi.

Ah - <strong>now</strong> I understand why you were saying that you can't
copy-and-paste between computers. Although I <em>am</em> a little confused
about why you'd do that: since I remember you installing packages via
"apt-get", I know that your Linux machine is connected to the Net, and
since you use webmail, you shouldn't have a problem using a browser from
Linux to do your email. If you do that, you wouldn't need to C-and-P
between computers; it would make life simpler for you overall.
</p>

<p>
You are right to this extent: it's a little more complicated to
copy-and-paste between machines running different operating systems. Not
impossible, mind you: you could run a VNC server on your Windows machine
(<a href='http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/download.html'>http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/download.html</a>) and a VNC
client on your Linux box, and you could definitely paste from one to the
other.

Odd that you should mention that:  I was a BBS sysop in the early to
late eighties (RBBS-PC behind BinkleyTerm), and one of few small
blessings along with the rather primative infrastructure and software
was that people <em>did</em> use proper quoting practices, such as the ones
Ben is now suggesting you use.

<p>
Since you don't know, and since you're having to follow expert
instructions sent to you asynchronously via e-mail, you need to 
_follow instructions carefully_ and be specific and detailed in your
problem reports.  We dinosaurs learned that back in the 80s, right?
</p>

<p>
Ben should not be needing to coach you into recognising that
"dpkg-p" is not an accurate way of typing "dpkg -P", for example.
Please stop floundering around, take a deep breath, and start over with
what Ben asked you to do, paying closer attention this time.

<p>
The bit about "requiring state of the art equipment" is rubbish.  My
<em>server</em>, which runs all of _Linux Gazette's_ mailing lists, plus a major
Web site, plus other mailing lists and a great deal of local user
services, is an 11-year-old throwaway VA Research model 500 PIII/500
with 256 MB RAM and a pair of 9 GB hard drives.
</p>

<p>
If I wanted it to run VNC (not "VNS") software, it would do that too.
But never mind about that passing reference to VNC[1], which was just
someone's offhand refutation of your claim that you can't cut and paste 
between machines, and please concentrate on the original solution, which
you flubbed by not bothering to type it accurately.

</p>

<pre>
&gt; &gt;Although I <em>am</em> a little confused about why you'd do that: since I
&gt; &gt;remember you installing packages via "apt-get", I know that your Linux
&gt; &gt;machine is connected to the Net, and since you use webmail, you
&gt; shouldn't &gt;have a problem using a browser from Linux to do your email. If
&gt; you do &gt;that, you wouldn't need to C-and-P between computers; it would
&gt; make life &gt;simpler for you overall.
&gt; 
&gt; Because;  as I told you before  I DON'T KNOW HOW!!
</pre>

<p>
Yes, you do. I've told you how. The problem is that instead of
listening, you've spent all your time yelling how you don't know.
</p>

<p>
Stop. Wind down. Take a deep breath. Then, carefully follow the
instructions that you've been given. If they don't resolve the problem,
or if you encounter new problems, come back and state those problems -
including any error messages - clearly and concisely, and we'll help
you, just as we have been all along.
</p>

<p>
I fully realize that going through the process of asking for technical
help can be intimidating and uncomfortable, particularly the first time.
This is, however, what it takes to make it possible for people to help
you - and getting frustrated and loud only 1) prevents people from
helping you and 2) makes it progressively more likely that someone on
the helping end will get annoyed and tell you to... um, chase flies, but
more emphatically.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I am a newbie  with
&gt; only a limited exposure to Linux. Every time I ask for help I'm told it
&gt; available online but I can't make sense of all the techno jargon, acronyms
&gt; and verbal short hand used.
</pre>
 
You have received actual top-quality help here, including a hell of a
lot of proper behavior clues, painstaking explanations of fine details,
and advice about things that any "dinosaur" from the early 80s would
know. The only thing you're being asked is to stop yelling about your
inability and FOLLOW SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; &gt; mind you: you could run a VNC server on your Windows machine
&gt; &gt; (<a href='http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/download.html'>http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/download.html</a>) and a VNC
&gt; &gt; client on your Linux box, and you could definitely paste from one to the
&gt; &gt; other.
&gt; 
&gt; What's that?
</pre>

<p>
You could actually read the page at the above link and find out, you
know.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; What does V N C stand for?
</pre>

<p>
Could be anything at all. Why not read the page and find out?
</p>


<pre>
&gt;  Never heard of it nor how to use it.
</pre>

<p>
Perhaps you could, y'know, actually READ THE PAGE AND LEARN? It's a
novel concept, but might be worth exploring.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; If the install procedure is anything like this siggen program I have
&gt; little hope of getting it right.
</pre>

<p>
If you do it by getting obnoxious and yelling about how you don't know
anything, then you're right: it's hopeless. If you actually follow
instructions, then it's very easy.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; The only reason I can get online is because the UBUNTU program figured it
&gt; out by itself. However I can't puzzle out how to configure it to do
&gt; anything else like using these clients you refer to. All the instructions
&gt; are so obscure with jargon I get lost.
</pre>

<p>
No, the instructions here have been written in plain, clear,
unabbreviated English. Anything that might have been unclear was
explained to the best of our ability. You've ignored all the help that
you've received and continued yelling about "jargon" and so on.
</p>

<p>
If you stop yelling, start listening, and follow instructions, you just
might learn something.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; I told you I am a newbie with only a couple months experience with Linux.
&gt; And that mostly with webmail.
</pre>

<p>
That's why you should be listening really, really hard, and following
instructions to the best of your ability.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; A lot of this stuff requires using state of the art equipment.
</pre>

<p>
What "stuff" are you panicking about? Nothing that anyone here has
mentioned requires any "state of the art equipment".
</p>


<pre>
&gt; My
&gt; computers are all salvaged from the scrap yard. They are 8 to 10 years
&gt; old.
&gt; My linux box was destined for the dump when I intercepted it. Will this
&gt; VNS stuff be compatible.
</pre>

<p>
That would be VN*C* - this being yet another example of your sloppy
approach and unpleasantly careless attitude toward what you're being
told. The answer is "yes" - VNC works fine even on very old equipment...
not that that really has to do with anything. Have you practiced copying
and pasting as I suggested? If you haven't, then I don't know what
you're expecting to gain here.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Arild, I'd appreciate it if you'd actually copy and paste the messages
&gt;&gt; &gt; that you're getting - that's standard protocol when asking for help -
&gt;&gt; &gt; rather than (mis)quoting what you saw.
</pre>


<p>
Ben I have been experimenting.
</p>

<p>
First off ;  I am quite familiar with cut and past in Windows.
</p>

<p>
However this Linux webmail does not seem to allow me to open two  windows
or emails simultaneously. Every time I try to write you a reply, the
webmail vanishes as soon as  I open the second window.  When I try to
backtrack by clicking the back arrow, the first window has vanished. There
is no sign of the message I began in Drafts. Scrolling jumps me right out
of webmail and I have to log back in again and start over.
</p>

<p>
Apparently webmail is not designed to work like this. At least not on what
my ISP uses.
</p>

<p>
Normally I handle my email correspondence on my windows computer but I
have not figured out how to cut and paste from one computer to another,  
- especially when they are not linked.  Which is why I paraphrased.
</p>


<p>
I tried to send myself an email from one computer to the other but that
just got me an error message  saying it could not be delivered.
Nor can I highlight something inside xoscope.for copying out.
</p>

<p>
To cut and paste I would have to go to my windows machine but then I can't
run siggen or Xoscppe inside Windows.
</p>

<p>
Ideas?
