<p>"Foolish Things" is a now-and-again compilation that we run based on our
readers' input; once we have several of them assembled in one place, we get
to share them with all of you. If you enjoy reading these cautionary tales
of woe, proud stories of triumph, and just plain weird and fun things that
happen between humans and silicon, that's great; if you have some to share
so that others may enjoy them, even better. Please send them to <img
src="../gx/lgmail/articles.png">.  <p>[ You can even tell us that it happened
to A Friend of Yours, and we'll believe you. ]

<h3>Do Not Fold, Spindle, or Mutilate</h3>
<p id="by"><b>[ Name withheld by request ]</b><br></p>

<p>...hold on to your chair, and put on whatever you need to survive this.
Its not funny, unless you weren't there, and I wasn't. 

<p> Back in 1990. 

<p> Seriously, seat belts required. And crash helmets. No, really. 

<p> Back in 1990 I was a computer tech guy at a small university campus. 

<p> We were switching over from all 5.25 inch drives to some machines having
only 3.5 inch drives, with a few having that old garbagey (if that's a
word) combo floppy drive. Two half-height drives, one a 5.25 and the
other 3.5, all one unit. And a few 'legacy' PCs with a 5.25 inch floppy
drive in them. Some had both sizes of floppy drives, as a separate unit.
A total of 6 computers. 

<p> It's finals week, when we don't have to provide tech support to the other
students. Why yes, we had finals too. 

<p> So, I'm walking down the hallway and one of the other computer lab guys
walks out of the computer room just as I walk past. 

<p> Know what the melting point of titanium is? I don't, but his face must
have beeen giving off that much heat. To use the phrase 'he was livid'
would be a major understatement. 

<p> He said to me, between clinched teeth, "Don't ask!" 

<p> Brrr... or high temperature frying, takes your pick. 

<p> I journey off to class, and try not to think of the horrors that he had
just gone through. 

<p> By the next day he had calmed down enough to tell me. 

<p> Due to the huge numbers of students, about 200, trying to use the 6
computers, they had to take turns printing. Some had printers at home,
and some didn't. Many still had 5.25 inch floppy drives at home, and no
printer. 

<p> One machine with a 5.25 inch floppy drive was kept available, just for
printouts. 

<p> The lab guy being there for the other students that night is the one who
should be given a medal. For not harming anyone. He repeatedly said, as
each new person walked into that room, that each person would have to
wait their turn to do their printout and take it to class. 

<p> One bright student, not wanting to wait for the one 5.25 floppy drive
computer to become available... folded their 5.25 inch floppy, and stuck
it in the 3.5 floppy drive machine that was available for use. 

<p> Yes, folded it in half! 

<p> of course, it stuck. 

<p> Billy had to get a pair of needle-nose pliers to carefully get the
floppy out and then test the read/write heads, to see if they were
broken. 

<p> There were two other people in line waiting to do their printouts on
their 5.25 floppies, for their final term papers. 

<p> After Billy spoke a few choice words about the lack of usefulness of
folding a floppy and the miscreant who folded it blamed Billy for lost
homework, the next two came to a startling conclusion. 

<p> If folding it is bad, cutting it to fit is okay. 

<p> You can stop shaking and/or laughing now. Yes, that was their next
thought. Scary, isn't it? Didn't ask Billy. They just got out a pair of
scissors and trimmed the 5.25 floppies they had. 

<p> Yes, they cut their 5.25 floppies to fit the 3.5 inch floppy drive. Cut
it to fit.... eekkkk. Sorry, I'm screaming on the inside. 

<p> All three of the miscreants blamed Billy for the loss of their homework.
Our boss told Billy later to not worry about it. 

<p> They stormed out of the computer room, and went off to class. 

<p> Backups you ask? They didn't have any, and those papers were one-fourth
or one-half of their final grade. 

<p> Just a few short minutes later, I walked by. 

<p> And the rest was history. 

<p> Oh, wanna guess what their major was? 

<p> Two of them were undergrad Applied Computer Science majors, and the
other was a grad student, working on his Master's in Applied Computer
Science. I.e., programmers. 

<p> I was appalled. That's my major! But I never did anything like that
to a poor defenseless floppy. Dropped books on them yes, but never
folded nor cut them.

<h3>A Doggone Chew-tastraphe</h3>
<p id="by"><b>Steve Brown</b><br></p>

<p> My wife and I decided to spend the weekend away to celebrate our wedding
anniversary, well she decided, I did as I was told. The children were packed
off to Grandma and a dog sitter was arranged, who would ensure that the
mutt (don't confuse with the useful software) was thoroughly entertained in
our absence.

<p> We had a wonderful time, collected the kids on the way back and piled
in to the house to greet our loyal and faithful hound. When we opened the
door there was no rushing 'waggy dog', as the children call him, to meet
us. He seemed very loathe to come out of his basket at all. I was busy
unloading the car when my wife called me in. "Steve", she said in tremulous
tone, "you had better sit down." "Why, what's up? Is the dog dead?" "No",
she said, "he may not have long to live though - he's chewed your
computer!".

<p> I charged in to the dining room where I kept my box, (it's an upgrade - I used
to have to sit in the cupboard under the stairs), and my jaw hit the floor.
Picture the scene if you will - one keyboard, all the keys removed,
partially chewed and placed in a neat pile next to the body (less cord) of
the mouse. Printer and modem power supplies, less leads, in a pile next to
that. Every single wire, apart from the monitor lead, had been removed from
the box and had the connectors/plugs chewed off and discarded.

<p> To add insult to injury, because it was plugged in (but not switched on) the
dog had tripped the RCD on the mains, so the freezer contents had thawed
out. Absolutely gutted.

<p> We had to take the dog to the vet, as he wasn't well shortly after this, it
turns out he had an inflamed colon (there's justice for you) for which the
dog-sitter paid the bill, but he wouldn't replace the leads for me, the
bar-steward.

<p> I've only just got all my stuff together to repair everything, my wife
wouldn't let me sell the dog to make good the damage, I've a sneaky feeling
she was quite pleased as I've been sitting with her in the evenings instead
of 'that damn computer'. Soon sort that out.

<h3>Ooo-ooo that smell/Can't you smell that smell...</h3>
<p id="by"><b>Charlie Pearce</b> (from the deepest, darkest edges of Dartmoor, England)<br></p>

<p> A few years ago I purchased a HP8200 USB CD-rewriter as I had no spare drive
bays, and it seemed convenient at the time (though not cheap, that 4x recorder
cost ten times as much as a 52x internal one does today!).
The drive sat happily on top of that mini-tower until some time after I put the
motherboard (along with some extra memory and hard drives) into a larger case, with
plenty of spare drive bays.

<p> It struck me that from the outside, the USB CD-writer looked very much like a
normal IDE cd drive in a fancy shell.... ever the curious (and with no further
research) I took some allen keys to it and took it apart. And as I thought,
inside it was just a normal IDE drive with some USB circuitry plugged into it.

<p> So one Sunday afternoon, I unplugged it all and installed the now liberated
drive into the spare drive bay - after some fiddling with cables and screws (this
ain't a modern case) I made a cup of tea, opened my window to get some air,
crossed my fingers and switched the computer back on...

<p> At which point I noticed a strange burning smell... - panicking, I pulled
the plug and didn't go near the machine for a few days.

<p> In fact, after a couple of days I was in my back garden speaking to my 
neighboor when I noticed a small blackened area at the back of their lawn. I
enquired as to what it was, "Oh we had a little bonfire there, just to get rid
of some garden waste." - when was this I asked?

<p> "Sunday afternoon".

<p> Doh! The next day I went back to my computer, booted it, and both the
drive and the rest of machine have worked fine ever since!

<p>
Ben was born in Moscow, Russia in 1962. He became interested in electricity
at the tender age of six, promptly demonstrated it by sticking a fork into
a socket and starting a fire, and has been falling down technological
mineshafts ever since. He has been working with computers since the Elder
Days, when they had to be built by soldering parts onto printed circuit
boards and programs had to fit into 4k of memory. He would gladly pay good
money to any psychologist who can cure him of the recurrent nightmares.

<p>His subsequent experiences include creating software in nearly a dozen
languages, network and database maintenance during the approach of a
hurricane, and writing articles for publications ranging from sailing
magazines to technological journals. After a seven-year Atlantic/Caribbean
cruise under sail and passages up and down the East coast of the US, he is
currently anchored in St. Augustine, Florida. He works as a technical
instructor for Sun Microsystems and a private Open Source consultant/Web
developer. His current set of hobbies includes flying, yoga, martial arts,
motorcycles, writing, and Roman history; his Palm Pilot is crammed full of
alarms, many of which contain exclamation points.

<p>He has been working with Linux since 1997, and credits it with his complete
loss of interest in waging nuclear warfare on parts of the Pacific Northwest.
