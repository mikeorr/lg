Hey Everyone,
  I have been using a SOCKs proxy via SSH (using port tunneling [1]) to 
browse the net from unsecure locations and it works great.
</p>

<p>
  However I have noticed that when I connect to certain hosts I am 
unable to use the connection as a SOCKS proxy and I was wondering how 
these hosts were configured to do this. It seems like a good feature to 
have on servers that I configure. Are there any disadvantages to this 
setup that I am missing?
</p>

<p>
  I have tried looking for a solution online but I guess I am not asking 
the right questions because I didn't find anything useful. So any 
idea's/suggestions on what/where to look?
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance.
</p>

[1] To set up a SOCKS proxy using SSH from a windows system follow these 
steps:
</p>

<p>
Open PuTTY. You should be greeted with a configuration screen. First, 
you will enter the hostname or IP address of the SSH server. Type in a 
name for your connection settings in the box below ?Saved Sessions?, and 
click the Save button.
</p>

<p>
Now you need to look at the tree of options to the left; expand the SSH 
tree, and select ?Tunnels?. Enter 4567 (or any port number above 1024) 
in the Source Port area, and click the Dynamic radio button to select 
it. Leave the Destination field blank, and click ?Add?.
</p>

<p>
Now go back to the Session tree (very top of the left section), and save 
again. You will be prompted to enter a username, which is the username 
of your shell account. Type that in, hit enter, and then type in your 
password when it prompts you.
</p>

<p>
In your browser change the proxy setting to localhost and the port you 
used earlier and you can browse the net safely.
</p>

I'm left wondering too!

<p>
Perhaps I don't understand your question. The way SOCKS works with
SSH tunnels is:
	a. Browser performs name lookup for the server you are trying
	to reach.
	b. Browser asks SSH to open connection to PORT:ADDRESS combination.
	c. SSH opens the connection to P:A from the remote end of the
	the SSH connection.
	d. SSH sends the packets back and forth between browser and
	the server; between the browser and the remote end these
	packets are wrapped up in socks.
</p>

<p>
As far as the server is concerned it sees the connection as coming
from the address/hostname of the remote end of the SSH connection.
Perhaps the servers are refusing connections from the remote end of
your SSH tunnel.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, it <strong>is</strong> possible that the browser is sending the server
information <strong>inside</strong> the HTTP packet (think cookies!) which contains
its "real" address/hostname and so the server figures out that this is
not the same address/hostname to which it is connected.
</p>

<p>
One problem with using SOCKS the way you are using it is that name
lookups are still performed "locally" (see (a) above). This could be a
problem if you prefer to use name servers from the remote end.
</p>

<p>
A much bigger problem is that you are using Windows <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-(">

I just realised that I probably misunderstood Suramya's question.

You can configure an SSH server to refuse to forward TCP connections.
"man sshd_config" says:
</p>

<p>
     AllowTcpForwarding
         Specifies whether TCP forwarding is permitted.  The default
         is "yes". Note that disabling TCP forwarding does not improve
         security unless users are also denied shell access, as they
         can always install their own forwarders.
</p>

<p>
I also realised that I said something wrong in my previous mail. The
packets are wrapped in socks between the browser and the SSH client
(not the SSH remote end); it is the SSH client which is the SOCKS
server! The SSH client then uses standard SSH port forwarding to
forward the packets to the other end.

<p>
I was wondering about a similar thing for a while. I've ssh access on a
remote system and one or two years back it was possible to do a direct
port forwarding (ssh -L option) for my local browser to the remote
proxy server to access  some restricted web pages. This stopped working
all of a sudden, error message was something like "administratively
forbidden".  I never really found out if the sshd configuration on the
remote end changed or the proxy (which still exists).
</p>

<p>
Then I discovered that SOCKS forwarding does still work and now I use
that. But the AllowTCPForwading would surely switch off SOCKS forwarding
as well? So do you have an idea how they switched this off selectively?
Is it a web-proxy feature instead of an ssh one?

<p>
Awesome. Thats probably what they are using to stop the forwarding. Is 
there some way to bypass this?

<p>
True. I verified it by visiting whatismyip.com to get the IP address I 
was browsing with and it gave me the IP of the remote server.
</p>

&gt; its "real" address/hostname and so the server figures out that this is
&gt; not the same address/hostname to which it is connected.
</pre>

<p>
Don't think this is whats happening, because I am unable to get to sites 
like google.com and yahoo either. Which I can access from the shell 
using lynx.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; A much bigger problem is that you are using Windows <img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-(">
</pre>

<p>
Yeah. I have Linux on my desktop but have to use Windows on the laptop 
due to work. (I have to debug programs written in VB.NET and ASP.NET for 
work so I need to run windows to use Visual Studio, believe me its a pain)
</p>

Thanks,
