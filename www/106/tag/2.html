Damn, I'm starting to foam at the mouth and twitch uncontrollably. This
Mutt + SMTP-via-SSH-tunnel thing's got me going batty...
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Mutt doesn't want to know anything about ports or hosts; instead, it
invokes Sendmail directly. The SSH tunnel is trivial to set up, but I can't
use it - despite spending the entire evening Googling for a possible
answer. I really don't want to switch to another email client, either. Do
any of you folks have a suggestion?

It's often forgotten that ssh can be used to <EM>run a command</EM> at the
other end; have you considered using it to run the local-injection
program on the remote server?

Local-injection program - define, please? I've got it all working now
(with the exception of a warning message from fetchmail that I'm too
busy to chase down ATM), but I'm still curious about other ways to
handle it.

Pipe your mail message to
</blockQuote>

<blockquote><pre>ssh remotehost /usr/bin/sendmail
</pre></blockquote>
<blockQuote>
and let sshd remotely run it with the piped stdin as the message
source.  <TT>/usr/bin/sendmail</TT> is still almost always a link to something
that can deal with that, even these days, no?

You could try using Msmtp: <A HREF="http://msmtp.sourceforge.net"

probably has issues of its own.

It does. I read about a guy who was using esmtp and msmtp, and he got
them working with this kind of thing, but I don't really want to drop
Exim, either; it's proven itself over time.

I've only just started using Mutt myself. What I think you're going to
have to do is get an MSA on your box -- something like
<A HREF="http://msmtp.sourceforge.net"
	>http://msmtp.sourceforge.net</A>
"msmtp is an SMTP client that can be used as an "SMTP plugin" for Mutt and
probably other MUAs (mail user agents).
It forwards mails to an SMTP server (for example at a free mail provider)
which does the delivery.
To use this program, create a configuration file with your mail account(s)
and tell your MUA to call msmtp instead of <TT>/usr/sbin/sendmail.</TT>"

Actually, that's one of the things I wanted to avoid doing - much as I
like null-mailers. Picture this scenario: I'm at a Net cafe that's got
SSH blocked but 25 open (it's happened). Whups! No outgoing mail for me,
then, unless I resort to webmail (Nextel does not provide SMTP or POP -
connectivity only.)
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
In essence, I want to retain full SMTP capability but be able to switch
between doing that and forwarding 25 (and/or 995, if necessary.) This
week's been sorta amusing in that regard: Earthlink blocks 25 but leaves
995 open; Sun's firewall is the opposite. Setting up Exim as I'd
mentioned, plus adding another "poll" section to my ~/.fetchmailrc, and
running
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>su -c 'sh ben@linuxgrrzette.net -L 2525:linuxgazette.net:25 -L 995:linuxgazette.net:995'
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
takes care of both - and should work fine with my cell setup when I get
back home. The only thing I get to pay for is the additional SSH
overhead for all my mail transactions, but it's not a big deal. The only
thing I don't get is why I have to do the "su" bit; the first forward
doesn't require it, but adding 995 - which is obviously <EM>not</EM> a low port
- makes the connection fail.
</STRONG></P>

Then you'll want to use a hook in mutt to conditionally set $sendmail
to 'msmtp' instead of the default pointing to your sendmail so that
the right program gets invoked at the right time. You'll point
mstmp to deliver to your end of the tunnel, of course.

So to cut the ramble down, it's YANM (Yet <EM>Another</EM> Null Mailer)

One of <EM>my</EM> favourite places to shop is the Linuxmafia Knowledgebase.
