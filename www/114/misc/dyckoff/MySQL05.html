<h2>MySQL User Conference, Santa Clara Convention Center</h2>
<b>by Howard Dyckoff</b>

<p> This was the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of MySQL AB,
the commercial and Open Source hybrid that is also a Eurotech star with a
million users worldwide. MySQL has matured, and now supports several
discrete engines as well as database clustering. At the conference, the
company announced major partnerships with Red Hat and Business Objects, as
well as launching "<a href="http://www.mysql.com/network/">MySQL
Network</a>" - its pay-for-full-service, certified offering with 24x7
support.</p>

<p> This year, the company paired with O'Reilly Media to produce a combined
conference and celebration. This was a focused and well-organized event
that was attended by some 1300 full conference participants and several
hundred more expo attendees and exhibitors. Attendees were also encouraged
to come to O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.web2con.com/">Web 2.0
conference</a> in SF during the fall. Full conference participants who
registered and paid early got a discounted $895 rate and were able to
choose a free book - either the new &quot;MySQL Cookbook&quot; or
&quot;High-Performance MySQL.&quot;; full-time students could get 65% off
with proof of status, a copy of ID &amp; a class schedule. A full-cost
registration at the door was $1095.</p>

<p>The $25 expo pass [no comps] did grant admission to 2 product-oriented
seminar tracks during the 2 day expo - and whatever snacks were hosted in
the small expo hall. If you weren't sure about the conference's $1100 full
fee, this was definitely the way to go. The expo-OK seminars included <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/mysqluc2005/view/e_sess/6217">Developing
MySQL applications in PHP</a>, <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/mysqluc2005/view/e_sess/7040">Leveraging
Open Source Tools for MySQL Development</a>, <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/mysqluc2005/view/e_sess/7055">Ensuring
Effective MySQL Backups</a>, <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/mysqluc2005/view/e_sess/7069">Linux
Server Configurations for MySQL Database &amp; Clustering</a>, and <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/mysqluc2005/view/e_sess/7081">OpenSolaris:
Innovation Happens</a> among others.</p>

<p>For an extra $300, attendees got to
take 2 tutorials on the first day. Some specific topics were MySQL
5.0, Performance Optimization, PHP, and, Data Warehousing. Two back
to back tutorials prepared attendees for the certification exams held
on site.</p>

<h3>Keynotes</h3>

<p>The best keynote was given mid-conference by MySQL CEO Marten Mickos.
He spoke about the value of software and platform standardization, and cited
the examples of automobiles, fax-machines, and VCRs [can you say "BetaMax"?].
Everything gets inexpensive, Mickos said, after the standardization is
accepted. "Now, everyone has a free software browser."</p>

<p>This is good and bad news: while IT $s are shrinking at most companies,
the costs of procuring and using software has declined wherever
standardization has occurred. There is a kind of "Moore's Law of Software,"
Mickos said, where OSSw was bringing down the TCO.</p>

<p>How does this relate to the MySQL AB model? "We are the JetBlue of
databases," Mickos said. He continued the airline analogy by comparing
business travellers to his paying clients and the free users to the economy
travellers. The developer community was the crew on this MySQL
aircraft.</p>

<p>But MySQL is no longer a light weight DB; version 5.0 will sport views,
triggers, and stored procedures. The current 4.1 version is already
working well in websites and data-marts. Mickos cited performance examples:
Cox Communications supports its DSL - 10 million users with 9000 inserts/sec
 - on 35 DB instances; Sabre/Travelocity supports 300,000 transactions/hr on
45 DB servers. C/Net and Wikipedia also run on MySQL DB instances.</p>

<p>Some of those ideas were expanded at the final keynote, "The Future
Belongs to Data", by Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly Books and Media fame. This
was less about data than about the value of websites that engage surfers
and accumulate trusted personal data for use in new and imaginative SOA and
innovative services. O'Reilly spoke of these sites as data aggregators
whose intrinsic value came more from the service aspect and less from the
software, which was becoming commoditized. According to O'Reilly, these are
"meta apps"; the platform is the Internet itself, and not the PC or any
specific media device. "This is what we mean by Web 2.0," he explained.
</p>

<p>The key to popularity and loyalty, to "website stickiness", is unique
and hard to duplicate content made relevant (mostly due to user data.) He
pointed to new services being tested by Yahoo and Google as examples of
innovative data services. "The new model", he added, "is the perpetual
beta." </p>

<p>The new web will be "designed for participation" with "small, loosely
joined software components" - somewhat like the model of Linux. This is the
approach of MySQL, he noted. He also cited the example of Mozilla, which
started out with a heavyweight code base but had recast itself to this
model - just before achieving its recent success with FireFox.</p>

<p>He pulled up an interesting demo link that used Google's mapping API and
fed in data from the data-rich Craig's List for rental units in San
Francisco. The result was a Google map with multiple pointers showing <a
href="http://paulrademacher.com/housing/">available rentals</a> in a
section of SF.</p>

<p><a href="http://people.redhat.com/tiemann/">Michael Tiemann</a>, CTO of
Red Hat, also delivered a keynote - this one aimed at the relationship
between the OSSw community, commercial activities, and the evolution of
Open Software licenses. Tiemann gave a nod to Richard Stallman in
discussing the history of OSSw, the GNU Manifesto, and the GPL. He recalled
the irony of working on C++ at Cygnus in 1995 and considering buying Red
Hat at the time (Red Hat wound up buying Cygnus after Tiemann moved there.)
He also noted that about 70% of projects on SourceForge used either the GPL
or BSD licenses.</p>

<p>Tiemann said that thousands of OSSw projects could now be "viewed as
mature." He speculated that over 1 million developers work on these
projects, many of whom also work for proprietary, commercial SW houses.
This drives the value proposition of OSSw, Tiemann said, by both cutting
acquisition costs and also reducing bugfix time. There is also value in
getting wide user input and using this for design; more input means fewer
bugs and lower costs for end-users. Tiemann contrasted the costs and
quality of Linux and MySQL code with that of Microsoft by showing a slide
of Redmond's announced security investments which have risen to $2B in
recent years. "Writting [bad] code in 1985... is no excuse for spending $2
billion today!"</p>

<h3>User Conference Links</h3>

<p>This is the best link to a presentations page, still incomplete but
public. It also has a left-hand navigation column to the rest of the
conference site. </p>

<p> This link is to the list of conference sessions, which have links when
the session is available, as in the above link, for download.</p>

<a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/35/sessions.html">http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/35/sessions.html</a>

<p>There was a Best Practices series, including sessions on using MySQL
with C##, Java, Perl, and PHP. These are not currently on the web site but
may be posted soon [we can send requests to O'Reilly Media]. I would
recommend the available presentation on "MySQL Network - Overview" to get a
better idea of the newest commercial offerings from MySQL.</p>

<p>Product sessions and demos showed off the new features and tools in the
5.0 beta; a new family of GUI-base tools for admins and DBAs was also in
alpha test. This effort will include a slick, wizard-based migration tool
that 'does the right thing' for reverse engineering schemas and stored
procedures [not converted yet, but written to scripts]. Demos showed
conversions of Oracle, MS-SQL and Access databases.</p>

<p> If you are interested in hearing how MySQL can fit into commercial IT
shops, check out the May 12 webinar [10:00 am PDT; 1:00 pm EDT]. To
register, go to <a
href="http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/forrester-mysql.php">http://www.mysql.com/news-and-events/web-seminars/forrester-mysql.php</a></p>

<p>Among notable expo vendors:</p>

<p>BlueGlue and SpikeSource, both purveyors of tested and certified OSSw
application stacks.</p>

<p>Rackspace and Thout, for new services.</p>

<p>Several informal conversations showed a very high level of satisfaction
with the MySQL User Conference.  This may be partly due to the tighter
subject focus and the clear technical levels of the sessions. It may also
have been due to the friendly user community that has emerged around MySQL.
If you are using MySQL and its tools, you would do well to attend a future
conference.</p>
