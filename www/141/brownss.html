<h1>An NSLU2 (Slug) Reminder Server</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>


<p>
LG #138 contained an <a href="../138/kapil.html">article</a>, "Debian on a Slug", in which Kapil
Hari Paranjape described how to install Debian on an NSLU2
device, so that it can be made into a general-purpose server (a
firewall, backup server, Web server, etc.) He also added a
sound device so that it can be used to play music.
</p>

<p>
Another application for such a device is as an alarms and
reminders system.  This is more than a simple alarm clock or
PDA, because the Slug is much more programmable: once you have
installed a lightweight speech synthesizer, the Slug can be made
not only to generate verbal reminders (which few PDAs can do), but
also to check for information on the Internet and adjust its
announcements, accordingly. It is a useful alternative to
leaving a PC switched on for long periods just to do that job
(or possibly forgetting something because the computer was
switched off).  If you are attempting to learn a foreign
language, the Slug reminders system can help with that,
also.
</p>

<h3>Speech Synthesis</h3>

<p>
The <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">eSpeak</a>
speech synthesizer is lightweight enough to run on the Slug, and
is also available as a Debian package, although if you are
running Debian stable then you will likely find that installing
from source will get you a significantly improved version.  (Be
sure to completely remove the Debian package and its libraries,
before compiling from source.) eSpeak produces very clear
English speech in several accents, and also supports quite a few
other languages (some better than others). Installation is
straightforward, except you might find that the audio output
doesn't work; if this is the case, then simply write audio to a
file or pipe and play using <tt>aplay</tt> in the
<tt>alsa-utils</tt> package. (Note, however, that some old versions
of eSpeak won't write to a pipe when asked. If it's just a short
reminder, you can write to a file in <tt>/dev/shm</tt> and
delete it after playing.)
</p>

<p>
Personally I use eSpeak with my language-practice program <A
HREF="http://people.pwf.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/gradint/">Gradint</a>,
which I have adapted to run on the Slug.  Besides generating
vocabulary-practice sessions using "graduated-interval recall",
Gradint can also be made to produce other speech-reminder
"patterns" such as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Graduated wrap-up alarms ("10 minutes", "5 minutes", "3
minutes", etc.).</li>
<li>"Nags" to get you out of bed in the morning or to do other things
when you are tired.</li>
<li>Timed second-language or multilingual instructions for performing various
aspects of personal-care activities, etc., in order to practice
the language and also allowing you to optimise the
schedule for maximum energy-efficiency or whatever.
(This could also be of <em>some</em> use for people with disabilities
that create a need for prompting.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
For languages that eSpeak cannot yet produce well, if all the
possible utterances are known in advance, then Gradint allows you
to generate them on another system and transfer them across (or
simply use recorded sounds instead).
</p>

<h3>Dealing with Unreliable Sound</h3>

<p>
It appears that some USB sound adapters will fail, from time to
time, especially if they are plugged into an unpowered hub.
This is probably due to their highly variable power consumption.
The symptoms are that the sound stops, and the system behaves as
though the sound adapter has disappeared from the USB bus. To
restore sound functionality, the adapter may need to be
unplugged and re-inserted, or perhaps even the hub it has been
connected to may need to be unplugged and re-inserted.  For this
reason, never put the sound adapter on the same hub as the
storage device(s).  (Some kernel versions won't be able
to use certain sound adapters, if they are attached to USB 2
hubs, anyway; they need to be attached to USB 1.1 hubs or directly to
the NSLU2, unless you update your kernel.) It is also advisable
to minimise the number of devices the sound adapter shares
an unpowered hub with, or even connect it directly to the NSLU2,
if you don't have many other USB devices to connect. (You
<em>could</em> connect it to a powered hub, but I am trying to avoid the
use of powered hubs in an attempt to minimise extra power
consumption and reduce the amount of wiring.)
</p>

<p>
In order to avoid missing your reminders due to the sound
adapter having failed, it is advisable to periodically run a
script that ensures the sound device is still present, and alerts
you if it is not. The alert can be by means of a console beep.
(Unfortunately, there does not yet appear to be an NSLU2
equivalent of the PC-speaker kernel patches that allow the
speaker to generate more than a simple beep.) The following
script will do this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
if ! amixer scontents &gt;/dev/null; then
  # sound adapter has somehow gone down
  cd
  if test -e .soundcheck-beeping; then exit; fi
  touch .soundcheck-beeping
  while true; do
    for N in 1 2 3 4 5; do echo $'\a' &gt; /dev/tty1; sleep 1; done
    if amixer scontents &gt;/dev/null; then break; fi # came back
  done
  rm .soundcheck-beeping
fi
</pre>

<p>
The script should be run as root, so that it can access
<tt>/dev/tty1</tt> to make the NSLU2 beep.  It should be run at
various times (perhaps from <tt>crontab</tt>), but take care not
to run it in the middle of the night, unless you want to be
awoken whenever the sound happens to fail. (It may be better to
wait until just before the time the morning alarm would have
happened.)
</p>

<p>
It will likely help to use <tt>amixer</tt> to set the sound
level low, so as to reduce peaks in USB-bus current.  If using
unpowered speakers (which is a good idea because powered
speakers can be more susceptible to picking up annoying noise
from mobile phones, etc., and anyway they take more power),
consider attaching only one speaker, if stereo sound is not
necessary, since this should further reduce the current, and it
also means you can salvage an unpowered speaker from an unused
pair of powered speakers (one of which is usually unpowered),
rather than having to obtain new ones.  Then experiment with
different levels, to find how low you can go whilst still being
able to hear it clearly.  This will vary with the sound adapter
and the speakers.
</p>

<p>
Wireless headphones may need the level set lower still; cheap
FM cordless headphones can easily be overloaded and lose the
signal, if the input sound peaks too loudly. You may find that
the lowest setting of <tt>amixer</tt> (the resolution of which
is limited to that of the sound adapter) is still too high, in
which case you need to ensure that the sound data itself is not
too loud.  This is one of the functions I had to add to
Gradint.
</p>

<h3>Using the Power Button</h3>

<p>
The NSLU2 has only one built-in input device: the power
button.  Thankfully, this can be re-programmed, so, for example,
you can use it to acknowledge an alarm without having to connect
some other input device or connect across the network.  On
Debian at least, the NSLU2 power button sends a "Ctrl-Alt-Delete"
event to <tt>init</tt>, so you can edit <tt>/etc/inittab</tt>
and change the <tt>ctrlaltdel</tt> line to run whatever script
you want.  Since it's rather long-winded to script an automatic
edit of <tt>/etc/inittab</tt> followed by a signal to
<tt>init</tt>, every time one of your scripts wants to change the
function of the power button, it makes sense to point
<tt>inittab</tt> to a shell script somewhere, which you can then
modify at will.  Personally, I use something like the following:
</p>

<pre class="code">
#!/bin/bash
cd ~user   # note: we are root
if test -e .powerbutton.pid; then
  kill $(cat .powerbutton.pid)
elif test -e .powerbutton2.pid; then
  kill $(cat .powerbutton2.pid)
else
  if test -e .about-to-shutdown; then
    reminders.sh "en Shutting down."
    rm -f .powerbutton.pid .about-to-shutdown
    /sbin/halt
  fi
  echo $'\a' &gt; /dev/tty1
  touch .about-to-shutdown
  reminders.sh "en Press again to shut down." &amp;
  (sleep 10 ; rm .about-to-shutdown) &amp;   # the &amp; is important
fi
</pre>

<p>
This looks for a file called <tt>.powerbutton.pid</tt>, which
should, if it exists, contain the process ID of some process
that needs to be terminated when the power button is pressed
(for example, the alarm process).  If <tt>.powerbutton.pid</tt>
does not exist (and there is a check for
<tt>.powerbutton2.pid</tt> also, in case you need to run some
lower-priority reminder sequence at the same time as the
immediate one), then the power button will halt the machine, but,
before it does so, it will prompt the user to press again (within
10 seconds), in order to protect against accidents: if you
pressed the button half a second after the process happened to
terminate by itself, then you probably <em>don't</em> want to
shut down the machine.  The console beep is there so that, if
the sound or speech somehow fails, there is at least some
indication of response.  The line in the script marked "the
&amp; is important" is marked thus because the script needs to
return control to <tt>init</tt>, so that <tt>init</tt> can catch
the repeat press of the power button within the 10-second period;
otherwise, <tt>init</tt> may queue that event until after the
script finishes, when the 10 seconds are up, which will mean it
will not be possible to use the power button to halt the machine.
</p>

<h3>Other Remarks</h3>

<p>
If you want to reduce the amount of light given off by the
Slug (for example because you want to run it in a bedroom which
needs to be dark), you can turn off all the LEDs except the
Ethernet LED and the power button LED, by using the
<tt>leds</tt> command.  For example, you can put this in root's
crontab:
</p>

<pre>
@reboot sleep 5; for N in ready status disk-1 disk-2; do leds $N off; done
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>sleep 5</tt> is to avert a race condition with the
system init scripts, which will otherwise switch the LEDs back
on. You may still have too much light coming from the LEDs on
USB devices (most flash storage devices have bright LEDs that
may flicker during use), so you may have to position these
carefully, and/or point their LEDs downward onto a dark surface.
</p>

<p>
The NSLU2 seems to keep good clock time (better than many
PCs), but you might want to install <tt>ntp</tt> to keep the
clock synchronised.  To save RAM, you can prevent <tt>ntp</tt>
from running as a daemon by adding an <tt>exit</tt> command near
the start of <tt>/etc/init.d/ntp.conf</tt>, and instead run it
from root's crontab using something like<p>


<pre>
37 2 * * * /usr/sbin/ntpd -n -q -g &gt;/dev/null
</pre>

<p>
since updating once a day should easily be accurate enough.
(Note that it should run after 2am, if you want it to pick up
daylight-saving changes.)
</p>

<p>
If you do not have a PDA to connect as an NSLU2 terminal, you
may also like to try using a screenreader with eSpeak in place
of a display.  An NSLU2 with a screenreader and a USB keyboard
could be enough to make a simple workstation for a blind user,
although it does require some setting up.
