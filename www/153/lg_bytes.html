Xandros Buys Rival Linspire
</h3>
<p>At the end of June, Xandros acquired Linspire as a wholly-owned
subsidiary that it intends to manage as a separate division. Financial
information was not disclosed, even to Linspire's shareholders.  (The
Board of Directors was fired last year by former CEO and current Board
chairperson Michael Robertson.) Other details on the acquisition are
available as an FAQ on the Linspire Web site:
<a href="http://www.linspire.com/lindows_news_pressreleases.php">http://www.linspire.com/lindows_news_pressreleases.php</a></p>

<p>
Xandros expressed a commitment to maintain the open source "Freespire"
project, which is a free and redistributable version of Linspire. Also,
Linspire CEO Larry Kettler and other Linspire managers will be joining
the Xandros management team.
</p>

<p>
Major motives for the deal were providing Xandros with Linspire's
advanced CNR technologies and Linux expertise. It also enlarges the
Xandros customer base and support network. CNR is an automated update
technology and software delivery service that has helped popularize
Linspire (formerly called "Lindows") with former Windows users. Xandros
expects to incorporate CNR by the end of July.
</p>

<blockquote>
"Products like the ASUS Eee PC have demonstrated the huge potential
market for Linux-based OEM netbook solutions, and CNR will help Xandros
make these platforms easy to enhance and maintain, while providing
on-demand delivery of a growing number of Linux applications, utilities,
games, and content", said Andreas Typaldos, Xandros CEO. "Linspire's CNR
technologies will speed up Xandros's expansion into the applications
space."
</blockquote>

<p>Former Linspire CEO Kevin Carmony has used his blog to discuss
potentially sordid aspects of the transaction, including charges that
Board Chairperson Michael Robertson may be trying to convert Linspire
assets to cash for personal use and also may be involved in rumored
Microsoft negotiations with AOL and Xandros. See:
<a href="http://kevincarmony.blogspot.com/2008/06/xandros-acquires-linspire-assets-in.html">http://kevincarmony.blogspot.com/2008/06/xandros-acquires-linspire-assets-in.html</a></p>

Red Hat Voted "Greenest" Operating System
</h3>
<p>
A recent Network World comparison examined power consumption to determine
who had the "greener" operating system: Windows, Red Hat, and openSUSE.
Network World ran multiple power consumption tests using Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5.1, SUSE Enterprise Linux 10 SP1, and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise
Edition on servers from Dell, IBM, and HP. Red Hat Enterprise Linux ranked
at the top in keeping power draw in check, pulling about 12 percent less
power than did Windows 2008 on identical hardware. This reduced power draw
was evident across testing in both performance and power saving modes, and
included all server models used in the testing.
</p>

<p>From the summary at
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/research/2008/060908-green-windows-linux.html">http://www.linuxworld.com/research/2008/060908-green-windows-linux.html</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
"We ran multiple power consumption tests... on four popular 1U server
machines, one each from Dell and IBM and two from HP. The results showed
that while Windows Server 2008 drew slightly less power in a few test
cases when it had its maximum power saving settings turned on, it was
RHEL that did the best job of keeping the power draw in check across the
board." The tests also showed that firmware updates and new drivers were
needed to take full advantage of newer chip-based power optimizations
such as CPU throttling.
</blockquote>

<p>
Red Hat noted its involvement in projects focused on saving power.
Example of these efforts include <a
href="http://www.LessWatts.org">http://www.LessWatts.org</a>, an
Intel-sponsored project bringing together developers, users, and sysadmins
all in the effort to create a community around saving power on Linux. One
part of the LessWatts program is PowerTOP, a Linux tool that helps identify
programs that are power-hungry while a system is idle. PowerTOP technology
is also being applied to the kernel itself, where there is ongoing auditing
work to find pollers. The end result is a more efficient kernel.
</p>

<p>
Another area of development concerns support for CPU clock frequency
scaling. Clock scaling allows us to change the clock speed of a running CPU
on the fly. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 has support for Intel's Dynamic
Acceleration Technology, which provides power saving by quiescing idle CPU
cores, and also offers performance gains by potentially overclocking busy
cores within safe thermal levels.  Red Hat worked close with AMD to prove
support for <em>PowerNow!</em> - a technology for power management. The new
tickless kernel provided in Fedora 9 is likely to move to Red Hat
Enterprise Linux in the future.  This allows the kernel to properly idle
itself. Today, the kernel tick-rate is 1000/second, so it is hard to
quiesce it. The tickless kernel sets the system into a low-power state
based on knowledge of future timer-based events. Long, multi-second idle
periods are possible.
</p>

Kernel 2.6.26 Released with New Virtualization Support, KDB
</h3>

<p>
The new kernel, version 2.6.26, was released in mid-July, and adds
support for read-only bind mounts, x86 Page Attribute Tables, PCI
Express ASPM (Active State Power Management), ports of KVM to IA64, S390
and PPC, other KVM improvements including basic paravirtualization
support, preliminary support of the future 802.11s wireless mesh
standard, a new built-in memory tester, and a kernel debugger.
</p>

<p>
Although Linux has supported bind mounts, a sort of directory symlink that
allows sharing the contents of a directory in two different paths, since
kernel 2.4, a bind mount could not be made read-only. That changes with
2.6.25, with a more selective application of r/o properties for improved
security.
</p>

<p>
Also included are several file system updates, including IPv6 support
for NFS server export caches. IPv6 support also extends to TCP SYN
cookies.
</p>

<p>
Kernel 2.6.25 has improved USB and Infiniband support. This release adds
support for the OLPC XO hardware. This includes the ability to emulate the
PCI BARs in the kernel. This also adds functionality for running EC
commands and a CONFIG_OLPC. A number of OLPC drivers depend upon
CONFIG_OLPC. A forward-looking addition is the increase of maximum physical
memory size in 64-bit kernels from 40 to 44 bits, in preparation for future
chips that support larger physical memory sizes.

<h2>Distro News</h2>
<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">openSUSE 11.0 goes GA
</h3>
<p>The openSUSE Project announced the release of openSUSE 11.0 in June. The
11.0 release of openSUSE includes more than 200 new features specific to
openSUSE, a redesigned installer that makes openSUSE easier to install,
faster package management thanks to major updates in the ZYpp stack, and
KDE 4, GNOME 2.22, Compiz Fusion for 3D effects, and much more. Users have
the choice of GNOME 2.22, KDE 4, KDE 3.5, and Xfce.  GNOME users will find
a lot to like in openSUSE 11.0. openSUSE's GNOME is very close to upstream
GNOME.</p>

<p>GNOME 2.22 in openSUSE 11.0 includes the GNOME Virtual File System
(GVFS), with support for networked file systems, PulseAudio,
improvements in Evolution, and Tomboy. openSUSE 11.0 includes a stable
release of KDE 4.0. This release includes represents the next generation
of KDE and includes a new desktop shell, called Plasma, a new look and
feel (called Oxygen), and many interface and usability improvements.</p>

<p>KControl has been replaced with Systemsettings, which makes system
configuration much easier. KDE's window manager, KWin, now supports 3-D
desktop effects. KDE 4.0 doesn't include KDEPIM applications, so the
openSUSE team has included beta versions of the KDEPIM suite (KMail,
KOrganizer, Akregator, etc.) from the KDE 4.1 branch that's in
development and scheduled to be released in July and for online update.
(KDE 3.5 is still available on the openSUSE DVD for KDE users who aren't
quite ready to make the leap to KDE 4.)</p>

<p>Applications also include Firefox 3 and OpenOffice.org 2.4. Get openSUSE
here: <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/">http://software.opensuse.org/</a> </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Gentoo 2008.0 Released
</h3>
<p>The Gentoo 2008.0 final release, code-named "It's got what plants
crave," contains numerous new features including an updated installer,
improved hardware support, a complete rework of profiles, and a move to
Xfce instead of GNOME. LiveDVDs are not available for x86 or AMD64,
although they may become available in the future.</p>

<p>Additional details include:</p>

<p>Improved hardware support: includes moving to the 2.6.24 kernel and many
new drivers for hardware released since the 2007.0 release.</p>

<p>Xfce instead of GNOME on the LiveCD: To save space, the LiveCDs switched
to the smaller Xfce environment. This means that a binary installation
using the LiveCD will install Xfce, but GNOME or KDE can be built from
source.</p>

<p>Updated packages: Highlights of the 2008.0 release include Portage
2.1.4.4, a 2.6.24 kernel, Xfce 4.4.2, gcc 4.1.2, and glibc 2.6.1.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Elyssa Mint, Xfce Community Edition RC1 BETA 025 Released 
</h3>
<p>This is the first BETA release of the Xfce Community Edition for Linux
Mint 5, codename Elyssa, based on Daryna and compatible with Ubuntu Hardy
and its repositories.</p>

<p>MintUpdate was refactored and its memory usage was drastically reduced.
On some systems, the amount of RAM used by mintUpdate after a few days
went from 100MB to 6MB. Mozilla also greatly improved the memory usage
in Firefox between version 2 and 3.</p>

<p>Elyssa comes with kernel version 2.6.24, which features a brand new
scheduler called CFS (Completely Fair Scheduler). The kernel scheduler
is responsible for the CPU time allocated to each process. With CFS, the
rules have changed. Without proper benchmarks, it's hard to actually tell
the consequences of this change, but the difference in behavior is quite
noticeable from a user's point of view.  Some tasks seem slower, but
overall the system feels much snappier.</p>

<p>Linux Mint 5 Elyssa is supported by <a
href="http://CNR.com">CNR.com</a>, which features commercial services and
applications that are not available via the traditional channels. The
Software Portal feature introduced in Linux Mint 4.0 Daryna is receiving
more focus, as it represents the easiest way to install applications. About
10 times more applications will be made available for Linux Mint 5
Elyssa.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">MindTouch Deki Wiki releases OSSw Enterprise Collaboration Platform</h3>

<p>
MindTouch announced in July the newest version of its open source
collaboration and collective intelligence platform. MindTouch Deki
(formerly Deki Wiki) "Kilen Woods" now delivers new workflow
capabilities and new enterprise adapters to help information workers, IT
professionals, developers, and others connect disparate enterprise
systems and data sources.</p>

<p>At the Web 2.0 conference in April, MindTouch showcased the social
networking version of Deki Wiki - a free, open source wiki that offers
complete APIs for developers. MindTouch enabled users to hook in legacy
applications and social Web 2.0 applications for mashups, while enabling
IT governance across it all. Deki Wiki is built entirely on a RESTful
architecture, and engineered for concurrent processing.</p>

<p>Although there have been recent point releases updating the platform
unveiled at OSCon 2007, according to Aaron Fulkerson, co-founder and CEO
of MindTouch, this is an enterprise class release and a new platform for
Deki Wiki. "MindTouch Deki has evolved into a powerful platform that is
the connective tissue for integrating disparate enterprise systems, Web
services, and Web 2.0 applications, and enables real-time
collaboration... and application integration."</p>

<blockquote>Fulkerson also told <em>Linux Gazette</em>, "MindTouch Deki
Enterprise offers adapters to widely-used IT and developer systems
behind the firewall and in the cloud, which allows for IT governance no
matter where your data lives. MindTouch Deki Enterprise is the only
wiki-based platform that offers this level of sophistication and
flexibility."</blockquote>

<p>MindTouch Deki "Kilen Woods" addresses the needs of enterprise customers
by providing a wiki collaboration interface with a dozen enterprise
adapters to corporate systems and new Web services like SugarCRM,
Salesforce, LinkedIn, and WordPress, or apps like MySQL, VisiFire,
PrinceXML, ThinkFree Office, and more.</p>

<p>Besides these adapters, users have extensions to over 100 Web services
to create workflows, mashups, dynamic reports, and dashboards. This
allows for a collaborative macro-view of multiple systems in a common
wiki-like interface. "Previously we didn't have these workflow
capabilities," Fulkerson told <em>Linux Gazette</em>, "that has been
under development for most of this year..."</p>

<p>MindTouch Deki enables businesses to connect and mashup application and
data silos that exist across an enterprise and effectively fills the
collaboration gap across systems. For example, MT Deki can take content
from a database server and mash it up with other services, such as Google
Earth or Google maps, LinkedIn, or CRM systems.</p>

<p>Site administrators simply need to register selected external
applications, and business users can immediately create mashups, dynamic
reports, and dashboards that can be shared. For example, with the desktop
connector, users can simply drag and drop an entire directory to
MindTouch Deki, and the hierarchy will be automatically created as wiki
pages. Users can also publish an entire e-mail thread, complete with all
attachments, to MT Deki in a single click.</p>

<p>MindTouch Deki "Kilen Woods" was showcased at OSCON in July and is
available for download. Desktop videos of MT Deki in operation can be
seen at <a href="http://wiki.mindtouch.com/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2008-07-23">http://wiki.mindtouch.com/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2008-07-23</a> </p>

Canoo announced in June the new release of its UltraLightClient (ULC), a

- generates an end-to-end application skeleton from a predefined data
structure - high-level component to simplify the development of forms
- improved data types - sortable ULC tables by default - data binding</p>

<p>A new developer guide describes how to be productive from day one. The

tabbed window panes, sortable tables, or drag and drop interactions and
keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>The final version of UltraLightClient 08 is available for download at
the Canoo product Web site. A license costs 1299 Euro per developer, and
