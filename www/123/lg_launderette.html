<p><strong>From Predrag Ivanovic</strong></p>
<p align="right"><strong>Answered By: Rick Moen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rick, does <a href=
"http://www.holtmann.org/linux/bluetooth/devices.html">this</a>
qualify?</strong></p>
<p><strong>He had to remove list of Linux compatible Bluetooth
devices from the site, because "[undisclosed] registered member of
the Bluetooth SIG complained about the non-qualified use of
Bluetooth products on this page and the features document." Altough
the BlueZ protocol stack is <a href=
"http://www.bluez.org/qualification.html">now qualified as a
Bluetooth subsystem,</a> the list is still not there.</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> [Rick] Pedja, thank you for the
suggestion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I did follow that at the time that it was a current
news item, The sum and substance seems to be that the (unnamed)
Bluetooth Qualification Administrator asserted (repeating the
allegations of a third party) that Holtzmann had been distributing
information about not-yet-certified software or hardware products
("non-qualified products") that had been entrusted to him under
nondisclosure (the "Bluetooth License Agreement") as a member of
the private Bluetooth SIG. Or alternatively that Holzmann was
violating his agreement by asserting that his BlueZ protocol stack
was "Bluetooth" compatible, when it had not passed the required
certification steps at that time. Or both. Or something
similar.</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> Well,according to <a href=
"http://web.archive.org/web/20050309091636/www.holtmann.org/linux/bluetooth/devices.html">
this</a> all he did is list drivers which are needed for some BT
device to work with Linux. I couldn't find anywhere "Device $foo is
certified by Bluetooth authority as working."</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> [Rick] I don't want to make it seem as if
I'm making excuses for the unnamed Bluetooth Qualification
Administrator, but Holzmann may have agreed in his "Bluetooth
License Agreement" to use the term "Bluetooth" only in relation to
certified products. It's not entirely clear, what their objection
was.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> [Rick] The problem is that the complaint may
have been justified. We don't have enough information to decide one
way or the other.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But it's very common to tie trademark-licensing rights
to compliance with an industry-controlled certification suite. I
can easily imagine Holzmann getting caught in one of those pitfalls
-- and no actual malfeasance being visited upon him by the industry
consortium.</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> So, device is BT-compliant ONLY if it passed
official certification, and since BlueZ was not certified at the
time, listing products that work with it is considered a violation
of some sort, right? And Holzmann received a slap on the wrist for
doing that, so it seems. If that's the situation, based on info I
have and your analysis, this is just another case of $institution
enforcing strict regulations. I thought that only
federal/government agencies (FAA,FCC etc.) are that
strict.</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> [Rick] Well, this is claimed to be based in
some contractual agreement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Contract violation isn't punishable in the way
<em>crimes</em> are -- the former being merely civil disputes
between parties. In retrospect, I really do think this entire case
was about trademark rights, enforced with the aid of a rather
aggressively worded contract. Which Holzmann signed. We have no way
of knowing if he <em>actually</em> acted in violation of that
contract (neither side having published the terms in question), but
that's what's alleged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>An additional lesson is possible from noting that,
stipulating that Holzmann was caught violating some contract he had
agreed to, nonetheless the sky didn't fall. The parties just worked
out the complaint, and moved on.</blockquote>
<blockquote>As I've observed many times, many computerists have a
comical and self-destructive tendency to run shrieking in terror,
seeking permission to capitulate, the moment they see a paper (or
even e-mail!) demanding something, that looks as if it's been
breathed on by a lawyer. I can imagine that the idea of an actual
<em>tort</em> (such as violation of contract) would inspire them to
fainting spells.</blockquote>
<blockquote>A "tort" in the USA and other British-derived legal
systems is a civil wrong, i.e., a non-criminal action or failure to
act, that had the effect of making the person involved (the
"tort-feasor") fail an obligation towards someone else. The state
has no part in civil litigation, except to supply the courts and
judges: Each party pays his/her own legal expenses, and must
convince a judge that a wrong has been committed through a
"preponderance of the evidence". (Criminal cases, by contrast, must
be proved by the state per the much higher standard of evidence
being convincing "beyond any reasonable doubt".)</blockquote>
<blockquote>Generally speaking, all you can get if you win a civil
suit is either correction of the wrongful situation (a "remedy in
equity") or a money payment from the other side in compensation of
your loss (a "remedy in law"). <em>Sometimes ,</em> you can get an
order that the other side pay your legal expenses. For a minority
of torts in which the plaintiff is able to show particular
recklessness, plaintiff can get "special" or "exemplary" damages to
deter other people from being screw-ups in that way, in the
future.</blockquote>
<blockquote>But that's really about it.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Now, people justly fear being sued (hauled into civil
litigation) simply because of expense of legal representation, but
that is a sword that cuts both ways (not to mention that "Discovery
should prove interesting" threat I cited earlier). Therefore, most
civil conflicts never go to court, even in the much-too-litigious
USA, and even in cases where sundry <em>threats</em> of litigation
have flown back and forth.</blockquote>
<blockquote>People go to court because either they're crazy, or
because the other side refuses to compromise and plaintiff thinks
he/she can win big enough to merit the time and expense.
Fortunately for our sanity, that happens rarely.</blockquote>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> [Rick] One lesson is: Be careful what
contracts you agree to. If the "Bluetooth License Agreement"
stipulates that you may not use a certain trademark-encumbered term
without passing the associated certification suite, then either
decline the agreement or be prepared to live with its
restrictions.</blockquote>

is obvious: They're scared.</blockquote>
<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> "Benefits that the company expects to
realize by choosing Windows include a lower total cost of
ownership, simplified system management and deployment of software
updates, reduced staffing and training requirements, improved
system reliability and security, and... reduced exposure to the
risk of intellectual property infringement claims."</strong></p>
<p><strong>[...]</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Highly skilled resources for the Windows platform cost
significantly less than similarly skilled resources for Linux,"
says Cook. "Had we selected Linux, I'm sure that we would have
incurred significant additional staffing costs."</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"

advocate of Wind0ws XP Embedded" (note that he's the <em>only</em>
one they quote throughout the entire "case study".) Everyone here
is shocked - shocked, I tell you - what an unusual tactic for
Micr0s0ft!</blockquote>
<blockquote>I stopped being outraged, or even bothered by this a
long, long time ago. If you're going to read this kind of stuff, I

article that's the most entertaining read I've had in a long
time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Short version: Zamos was a 21-year-old impoverished
student who couldn't use the XP educational copy he bought, tried
to return it under Microsoft's return policy and was rather
unscrupulously denied, tried to sell it on eBay, had his auction
questionably cancelled by a Microsoft flack, recertified his
auction as lawful and then sold the copy, was sued by Microsoft on
ridiculous copyright and trademark charges, countersued on several
charges while proving in court (represented only by himself) that
the lawsuit was bogus and the company's actions repeatedly in bad
faith, got international publicity for the lopsided court fight
that he seemed poised to win, insisted on a jury trial, and
eventually accepted a settlement that included a gag
agreement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>All his countersuit had requested was an apology and
reimbursement for his $60 product cost. Microsoft refused, and thus
ended up being taken to the cleaners -- in front of the entire
world -- by a 21-year-old pro-se litigant with a $3,500 annual
gross income.</blockquote>

upgrade to Vista. For models for the home and home office, the
recommended desktop is priced at $1,749. The laptop costs $2,699.

<p><small>Wed, 25 Jan 2006</small></p>
<p><strong>From Rick Moen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Several spams got through over the last few days, in
fairly quick succession: I think I've now closed that hole. As a
reminder, this mailing list is a bit difficult to keep spam out of,
because of the open postings setting. (Posters aren't required to
subscribe.)</strong></p>
<blockquote><img src="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)" height="28"

holiday suggestions ("Winter in Egypt" <img src=

<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" alt="(?)" height="28"
width="50" border="0"> Essentially, although my mail server's most
effective antispam measure is the RFC-compliance tests carried out
during each attempted delivery (because most malware and other spam
doesn't even try to observe proper SMTP requirements), my MTA's
knack, a bit later, of vetting each posting through SpamAssassin is
pretty useful, too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyhow, as it turns out, some particularly clever spams
insert SMTP headers intended to <em>disable SMTP-time SpamAssassin
checking</em> on the receiving host. Today, I've changed the SA
settings slightly, to make its semaphores a bit more difficult for
spammers to forge. (The two most recent spams got through because
I'd left that reconfiguration unfinished, with the effect,
ironically, of disabling SA checking entirely until I realised my
error.)</strong></p>
