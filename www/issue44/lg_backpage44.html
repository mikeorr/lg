Larry lives on a small farm
in northern Missouri, where he is currently engaged in building a
timber-frame house for his family. He operates a portable band-saw mill,
does general woodworking, plays the fiddle and searches for rare

struggling with configuring a Usenet news server for his local ISP.

departments of software companies like 
Quarterdeck, Symantec/Peter Norton Group and 
McAfee Associates -- as well as

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Dr. Warren MacEvoy</H4>
Dr. Warren MacEvoy (wmacevoy@mesastate.edu) has been a happy
Linux user since 1993. He enjoys reading with his son, Bryce, eating
really hot food and listening to disturbingly loud music. He also hates
putting commas inside of ``quotes,'' especially when the comma
is not part of what he is quoting!

Bill is the Technical Support Services manager for a multi-billion dollar
publishing company and is responsible for providing 1st and 2nd level
support services to their 500+ roadwarrior sales force as well as their
3,500 workstation and laptop users.  He was introduced to Linux by a good
friend in 1996 and thought Slackware was the end-all-be-all of the OS world
... until he found Mandrake in early 1999.  Since then he's used his
documentation skills to help those new to Linux find their way.

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Steve O'Neill</H4>
Steve is  an electronics engineer and been designing hardware for 30 years,
more or less. He got interested in Linux several years ago when he worked for a
local ISP: he put Linux on his machine and haven't looked back since. He like
to say he's semi-retired.  That means when the money runs out, he'll go back to
work.  :-)

<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">JC Pollman</H4>
I have been playing with linux since kernel 1.0.59. I spend way too much
time at the keyboard and even let my day job - the military - interfere once in
a while. My biggest concern about linux is the lack of documentation for the
intermediate user. There is already too much beginner's stuff, and the
professional material is often beyond the new enthusiast.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Erik Severinghaus</H4>
Erik is going to be a senior at North Raleigh Christian Academy next year. He's
been using Linux for a couple years now, and currently runs Debian. When he's
not staring at a monitor, he loves to ski, camp, backpack, and play basketball.

<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Anderson Silva</H4>

<P>
There's not much to say this month.  I was excited by the news about
Amiga adopting the Linux kernel (and about the rumors about Transmeta),
and by the report about TurboLinux outselling at least one version of
Windows 98 in Japan.  I learned from JC Pollman's article about DNS.

<P> JC, by the way, has agreed to do a new monthly series called
"The Linux Home System Administrator".  These articles will be a little
more advanced than our articles for beginners.

<P> Now, if only I hadn't been sick the past week and a half...
<P> 
<P>
Have fun!
