<p><strong>From Benjamin Peikes on 18 May 1998

<br><br>
Jim,

<br><br>
  I have a quick <tt>sendmail</tt> question for you. I have set up virtual 
hosting where I add an account for each user and then map the incoming and 
outgoing address for each account. The problem is that I add an account, i.e. 
<tt>bendtg</tt> and then map outgoing mail to be ben@dtgroup.com
and mail incoming mail for ben@dtgroup.com to go to the <tt>bendtg</tt> 
account. The problem is that I will also get mail going to
bendtg@<em>anyotherhostI.receive.mail.for</em>. I was wondering if you 
knew what I need to set so that it only accepts mail for a particular list 
of addresses that I specify. Thanks alot.

<br><br>
Ben

	I thought I answered this for you earlier this month.  
	Is this a resend --- or a refinement to an earlier 
	question?

<br><br>
	<em>[Nope, he's only got the one, but we <strong>do</strong> have a 
	lot of <tt>sendmail</tt> questions this month. -- Heather]</em>

<br><br>
	In any event the <tt>FEATURE</tt>'s that you might want to enable 
	and use in your '<tt>sendmail</tt>' 
	&quot;<tt>mc</tt>&quot; (M4 configuration file) are
	the "<tt>virtusertable</tt>", and the "<tt>genericstable</tt>"

<br><br>
	These can allow you to support the re-writing of addresses 
	in outgoing mail, and to support things like matching a 
	whole domain to a single mbox (mailbox folder) file.  You can
	also creating entries in the virtusertable that look just
	like aliases --- except that they include host/domain portions
	of addresses (parts to the right of the "<tt>@</tt>" (at) sign).

<br><br>
	Unfortunately I don't have working samples of these files
	but the M4/mc file would look something like:

</blockquote>
<pre>
OSTYPE(`linux')
VERSIONID(`@(#)YOURDOMAINHERE.mc	.1 (BP) 8/11/95')
FEATURE(`genericstable')dnl
FEATURE(`mailertable')dnl
FEATURE(`virtusertable')dnl
FEATURE(`domaintable')dnl
</pre>

<blockquote>
	And you'll have to create these tables (usually as dbm files)
	You can read more about these advanced sendmail features in the
	famous "<a href=http://www.ora.com/catalog/sendmail2/">Bat Book</a>" 
	(<em>Sendmail</em> 2nd edition by Bryan Costales, from 
	<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</a>).

<br><br>
	After you've merged some of these features into your <tt>mc</tt> file
	you'll build a <tt>sendmail.cf</tt> file by running <tt>m4</tt> on 
	it (I'd usually do an RCS check ('<tt>ci -l</tt>') of my old 
	<tt>/etc/sendmail.cf</tt> file before overwriting it with the new 
	one -- and I keep my <tt>mc</tt> files under version control as well).

<br><br>
	Once you've created the <tt>sendmail.cf</tt> file (and tested that
	it hasn't broken any of the feature you were already using)
	you need to create one or more tables (depending on which
	combination of '<tt>genericstable</tt>', '<tt>virtusertable</tt>', 
	and '<tt>domaintable</tt>'
	(and other features/tables you choose to use).  These are 
	created with a text editor and must be "compiled" or "made"
	into a suitable format (usually some dbm variant) using the
	'<tt>makemap</tt>' command.  

<br><br>
	The Costales book goes into that in some detail -- but the 
	thing is 800 pages long and it's easy to get lost in that 
	tome.  So you might want to just read the '<tt>makemap</tt>' man 
	page.

<br><br>
	Basically all this '<tt>makemap</tt>' stuff is just like running
	'<tt>newaliases</tt>' after you change the <tt>/etc/aliases</tt> 
	file.  It's even possible to force <tt>sendmail</tt> to use a 
	straight text file for a table if you want to (but that's hackish 
	and definitely more trouble than its worth.

<br><br>
	I have another problem with this whole approach.  If you
	are mapping all of the mail to a given domain or for a given
	host into a single "drop file" (mbox folder) which some
	user is getting (say, via POP or IMAP --- perhaps using 
	Eric Raymond's '<tt><a href="http://earthspace.net/~esr/fetchmail/fetchmail-FAQ.html">fetchmail</a></tt>' package) your customers still
	have a problem if they then need to split the mail into
	multiple addresses at their site.

<br><br>
	I've been told by one of <a href="http://www.netcom.com">Netcom</a>'s 
	senior techs that they resolve this with a custom re-writing rule 
	that take the envelope addressee(s) (the address or list of addresses
	as it was passed to the receiving sendmail daemon) and add those as 
	Bcc: header lines before putting the message in the drop file.

<br><br>
	(The effect of this is that if a piece of mail was addressed
	to you, and copied to some partner at your site --- the 
	receiving 'fetchmail' process should process those Bcc: lines
	--- as appropriate to your domain).

<br><br>
	I haven't confirmed this, nor have a concocted a custom
	<tt>FEATURE</tt> macro (m4) or rewriting ruleset to do this --- 
	though I'd like to see one and play with it.

<br><br>
	My personal opinion is that all this virtual mail domain to
	"drop file" stuff is ugly and hackish --- so I still use
	a <tt>uucp</tt> feed to get mail from my ISP to my domain and back
	(and I use it to get my netnews, too).

<br><br>
	As always the best sources of <tt>sendmail</tt> support on the 
	'net are:

<br><dl>
	<dt>NetNews:
		<a href="news:comp.mail.sendmail">comp.mail.sendmail</a>
