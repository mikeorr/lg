<P> 
<H4><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="../gx/note.gif">Michael Stutz</H4>
Michael lives the Linux life. After downloading and patching together his
first system in '93, he fast became a Linux junkie. Long a proponent of the
GNU philosophy (publishing books and music albums under the GPL), he sees in
Linux a Vision. Enough so that he spends his time developing a custom
distribution (based on Debian) and related documentation for writers and
other "creative" types and have formed a consulting firm based on
GNU/Linux.
His company, Design Science Labs,
does Linux consulting for small-scale business and art ventures.
He has written for <I>Rolling Stone</I>, <I>2600</I>: <I>The Hacker
Quarterly</I> and <I>Alternative Press</I>. He's a staff writer for <I>US Rocker</I>,
where he writes about underground rock bands.

sucking up to his wife and maintaining his cats.

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT ALT="" SRC="../gx/rose.gif">My assistant, Amy Kukuk, did
<B>ALL</B> the work this month other than this page. If this keeps up,
I may have to make her the Editor. Thanks
very much for all the good work, Amy. 
<P>
These days my mind seems to be fully occupied with <I>Linux Journal</I>. As
a result, I've been thinking I need a vacation. And, in fact, I do. I had
been planning to take off a week in June to visit my grandchildren in San
Diego, California, but just learned that their current school district is
year round -- no summers off. Somehow this seems anti-kid, anti-freedom
and just plain hideous. I remember the summers off from school as a time
for having fun, being free of assignments and tests -- a time to
sit in the top of a tree in our backyard reading fiction, while the tree gently
swayed in the breeze (I was fairly high up). It was great. I wouldn't want
to ever give up those summers of freedom. I wish I still had them. Ah well,
no use pining for "the good ol' days". The grandkids will get some time off
from school in August, and I will just have to put off the vacation until
then.

Be watching the Hot Linux News (link on The Front Page) on June 7 for an 
important announcement concerning the trademark issue.

Have fun!
