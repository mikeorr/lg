My wonderful wife... :-)

<P>
Yup, I'm afraid that it's time to permanently close up shop here at the 'ol
Weekend Mechanic.  Time constrains and just the day to day necessities are
starting to catch up and I just simply need to spend more time taking care of
family matters.  I sat down and figured out the time the other day:  I've been
in some form of training -- undergraduate, graduate, or residency -- for the
past <I>13 1/2 years!</I>  I'm about to take a sabbatical :-)

<P>
But before I go, I need to take a minute and say thanks to an awful lot of
folks:  to Tim, at Tennessee Commerce Net, who graciously offered to host the
Linux Gazette way back in the summer of 1995; to Matt Welsh for his kind offer
to bring the LG under the wing of the LDP; to Marc Ewing, Donnie Barnes, &amp;
Erik Troan, the &quot;Boys at RedHat&quot; who sent their encouragement (as
well as CD's, a t-shirt, books, and the familiar Red Hat... thanks!) way back
when; to Phil Hughes for his interest in and willingness to take over the LG
when it simply became too much; to Marjorie Richardson, for actually <I>taking
over</I> the day to day care and feeding of this thing (as well as shouldering
the hassles and burdens that come with this job -- such as truant columnists
such as your's truly...); to the myriad of authors and contributors who have
much more faithfully than me contributed to the success of the LG by giving of
their time and talents...

<P>
And mostly, to my lovely wife, without whose unflagging love, support, and
encouragement (and willingness to be an all-too-frequent &quot;computer
widow&quot;) none of this could have happened.  To all of you I want to humbly
say,

<P>
Thanks folks, it's been great.

<P>
So what are we now up to?

<P>
Well, as most of you know, I finished up at <A HREF="http://www.mtsu.edu/">
Middle Tennessee State University</A> this past December and immediately
started working for Dr. Ed Shultz in the Information Management Department
here at Vanderbilt.  We've licensed a clinical database system from a Dr.
Prakash Nadkarni at the Yale University Medical Center.  Dr. Nadkarni's
Advanced Clinical Trials Database System (ACT/DB) is a rather sophisticated
clinical trials data management system currently hosted in the Oncology arena.
My job has simply been to get the system working and integrated into the
larger clinical information system here at Vandy, which has so far proven to
be an interesting and often challenging endeavor.  For those who might be
interested in such things, Dr. Nadkarni has an article in this month's (March,
1998) Journal of the American Medical Informatics (JAMIA) describing the
ACT/DB system.  We've also submitted an abstract for a theater presentation of
the system at the upcoming AMIA meeting (again, for you medical informatics
type folks out there... :-)

<P>
I'm also working now on trying to set up a formal Medical Informatics
Fellowship through the National Library of Medicine here at Vanderbilt.  A
good deal of my time is now spent trying to get ready for this, especially as
the August 1 submission deadline approaches.

<P>
Anyway, if you've made it this far, thanks for hanging in there.  I really do
owe one last HUGE bit of thanks...
