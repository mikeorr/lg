<p><strong>From Grey on 07 May 1998

<br><br>
Answer Guy,

<br><br>
I am trying to understand why there is so much interest in Linux. What does
it offer, in this world of Macs and Win95 PCs, that makes it ....attractive
and useful?

	My first stunned impression on reading this question was:

<br><dl><dd>Is this a shill?  How did this guy manage to 
		find my column in LG without knowing a variety
		of answers to this question?

</dl><br>
	But that was a quick uncharitable moment.

<p><strong><img src="../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" width="50" height="28" alt="(?)"

Are there any good 'What is Linux?' type articles I can look at. I am always
tempted to purchase the Linux packages to try and determine what it is but I
would not mind knowing before.

<br><br>
Thanks,

	The fact that you are "tempted" (curious) is why you should play 
	with Linux.  It's your computer, and you should be able to "play" 
	with it --- and you should have choices about how it operates.   
	You computer should work in a way that suits your preferences and 
	style --- you shouldn't <strong>have</strong> to adopt the style 
	that's dictated by the trade press, the mass media, 
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/BillGates/">Bill Gates</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jobs.html">Steve Jobs</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/parc-go.html">Xerox PARC</a>, 
	or anyone else.

<br><br>
	(I'm presuming you are a home user in this case --- but my
	argument applies equally to whole institutions --- they should
	have the choice to use and run software that suits their
	needs and preferences --- even such preferences as they dictate
	to their employees or userbase).

<br><br>
	So, what is great about Linux? Choice.

<br><br>
	You asked for some URL's to read testimonials about this: here's
	one that I'm reading right now:

<br><dl>
	<dt>John Kirch's "NT 4.0 vs. Unix"
		<dd><a href="http://www.kirch.net/unix-nt.html"
		    >http://www.kirch.net/unix-nt.html</a>

</dl><br>
	(This isn't Linux specific --- but it does go into great detail
	and mentions Linux frequently in its analysis).

<br><br>
	I found the link to that site from one of the LDP (Linux 
	Documentation Project) mirrors.  These LDP mirrors are the
	definitive place to get info about Linux.  The "master" site
	is at:

<br><dl>
	<dt>Sunsite (U. of North Carolina):
		<dd><a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/"
		    >http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/</a>

</dl><br>
	... which is also the master repository for Linux software
	(just as <a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/</a>
	is the master repository for FSF GNUware).  The LDP mirror I 
	usually visit is at:

<br><dl>
	<dt>SSC's Linux Resources Pages:
		<dd><a href="http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/"
		    >http://www.linuxresources.com/LDP/</a>

</dl><br>
	A couple of other great sources of Linux information are:

<br><dl>
	<dt>Linux Weekly News:
		<dd><a href="http://www.lwn.net/">http://www.lwn.net/</a>

	<dt>Slashdot (Daily) News for Nerds:
		<dd><a href="http://www.slashdot.org/"
		    >http://www.slashdot.org/</a>

</dl><br>
	... and, of course Linux Gazette 
(<a href="http://www.linuxgazette.net/">http://www.linuxgazette.net/</a>)
	which was the first "webazine" to cover the topic and is still
	100% volunteer.

<br><br>
	Now, before I babble a bit about some of the other advantages
	to Linux let me digress to make two observations:

    <blockquote>
		I can talk about <strong>features</strong> of 
		<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/fam_win.htm">Win</a>
		'95, NT, 
		<a href="http://www.apple.com/macos/">MacOS</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.be.com/">BeOS</a> and 
<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Software/Operating_Systems/">many other</a> operating systems 
		and packages until my fingers are worn to nubs and you 
		justifiably have no reason to care what I've said.

	<br><br>
		In order to discuss the possible <strong>benefits</strong> 
		of Linux <strong>to you</strong> I'd have to know more 
		about you --- your requirements, preferences, and 
		constraints.  I'd have to engage in a process of 
		requirements analysis --- and the first step of that is 
		to identify the involved parties (particularly 
		<strong<you</strong> the customer).

	<br><br>
		Modern mass marketing and advertising does not meet this
		need.  It focuses on <strong>features</strong> rather than 
		<strong>benefits</strong> because features can be touted 
		with no understanding of a specific user's needs.  For any 
		given <strong>feature</strong> it may be of 
		<strong>benefit</strong> to a given user, or it may be 
		irrelevant or even detrimental to them.

    </blockquote>
	That said, the other observation is that Linux is not quite
	yet appropriate for just anyone.  To paraphrase a popular 
	signature from USENET:  "Linux is 'user-friendly'; it's just 
	particular about <strong>who</strong> its friends are"

<br><br>
	At the moment Linux is not the system I would provide to my
	mother for her first computer.  She was interested in two things
	--- playing Mah Jongg and surfing the 'net.  I got her a Mac
	Performa.

<br><br>
	By the end of this year I might have a different view --- 
	the 
	<a href="ttp://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>, and 
	<a href="http://www.gnustep.org/">GNUStep</a> projects, among 
	others, along with incremental improvements to the package 
	management and management of products like 
	<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a>, and 
	<a href="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</a> (among 
	<strong><a href="http://www.linuxlinks.com/Distributions/"
	>many</a></strong> others) may get us (the Linux community) to 
	the point where shipping Linux systems to complete novices will 
	make good business sense.

    <blockquote>
		(Note:  a number one priority advance that would help
		with this would be a multi-media "Welcome to Linux" 
		interactive video system --- that would be run off 
		a CD or (if they're supported by then) DVD disc).

    </blockquote>
	I think it is already to the point that "normal" users can 
	productively use Linux.   Customers can go to 
	<a href="http://www.varesearch.com/">VAResearch</a>,
	<a href="http://www.tesys.com/">Telenet</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.apache.com/">Apache Digital</a>, 
	<a href="http://www.promox.com/">PromoX</a>,
	<a href="http://www.swt.com/">SWT</a>, and other hardware 
	vendors to get a system with Linux pre-installed.  They can 
	use these systems as easily as they could a similarly 
	configured Win '95 box (and somewhat more easily than using 
	an NT system).  

<br><br>
	We are now past due for Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq, Zeos, 
	IBM or some other upper tier hardware vendor to offer Linux
	pre-installed on their "BTO" (Build to Order) price lists.
	Soon I also hope to see Apple and UMAX offer mkLinux and 
	LinuxPPC options on their PowerMac clones.  I think this will
	happen before the end of this year (for at least one of them).

<br><br>
	I hope that either this will happen, <strong>or</strong> one of 
	the Linux hardware vendors will move into the same volume of sales 
	and production currently enjoyed by one of these.  Every reader of 
	<a href="http://www.linuxgazette.net/">Linux Gazette</a>, 
	<a http://www.lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a>, 
	<a http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, 
	<a http://linuxgazette.net/">Linux Journal</a>,
	and all of the <a href="news:comp.os.linux">comp.os.linux.*</a> 
	and linux-* newsgroups and 
	<a href="http://oslab.snu.ac.kr/~djshin/linux/mail-list/">mailing 
	lists</a> can help make that happen by calling their
	vendor and just saying: "<strong>NO!</strong>  I will not pay for 
	a copy of Win '95 or NT that I plan to immediately and permanently 
	replace with Linux!" (and taking their business elsewhere).

<br><br>
	Now, "Grey", back to your question.

<br><br>
	What is "great" about Linux?

<br><br>
	The first thing I like about Linux is that I don't have to 
	use any GUI.  I don't like graphical screens.  I often spend
	twelve hours at a stretch in front of my monitor and my eyes
	just can take any GUI for that long.  My supporting a full 
	range of applications from it's multiple text consoles Linux
	allows me to focus on one task at a time, giving it my full
	screen.  At the same time I can be logged into a dozen or
	more session, as one or more users, to have all the benefits
	of multi-tasking.  In addition I have options to use keyboard
	or mouse driven "cut and paste" between my applications.

<br><br>
	I can use this same suite of applications on my old 386 and
	my Pentium 166 and on my Pentium II.  I can use any 
	application on any system on my network regardless of which
	machine is sitting in front of me (using <tt>telnet</tt>, 
	<tt>ssh</tt>, or <tt>rlogin</tt> for text mode apps, and the 
	communications protocols that are native to the X Windows System 
	when I need a GUI).  

<br><br>
	I can sit in a coffee house a few miles away, dial into one of my 
	machines (the 386 is the one with the modem) and use everything
	from my Ricochet equipped laptop that I could use if I was
	sitting at home in front of the machine myself.

<br><br>
	That same modem (the one on the 386) is used to get all my
	mail and netnews (<tt>uucp</tt>) and was used as the dial-on-demand 
	PPP link for my entire LAN for months (before I got the 
	ISDN router that I currently use).  When the ISDN goes out,
	I can switch back to using the 386 gateway in a couple of minutes.

<br><br>
	That same modem is also used for dial out BBS and shell mode
	access by any system on my LAN (given that the user has the
	appropriate level of access).

<br><br>
	That same modem is also use as the outgoing and incoming fax
	gateway.

<br><br>
	So, I can use one modem for dial and out shell, networking, and 
	fax <strong>for an entire network of systems</strong> --- and 
	<strong>none</strong> of these functions "trip" over the others 
	or conflict with any of the others.

<br><br>
	Meanwhile one of my house guests might be using that same
	386 to read mail or news, from a serial terminal line I
	keep in the living room, and my wife might be at the console
	(as she is now).

<br><br>
	That 386, Antares, is over ten years old now.  It has 32Mb 
	of RAM, a 2Mb video card (yes, it can run X --- though it is 
	a bit slow --- almost as slow as MS Windows used to be on it) 
	about 6 Gig of disk space, a tape drive, a magneto optical drive
	and a few other toys.   It ran Linux just fine with 16Mb of 
	RAM and a 200Mb IDE disk drive (and still would, though I'd
	never fit my personal mail archives on that tiny drive).

<br><br>
	(Incidentally, the the Caviar 200Mb drive in question is sitting
	in Canopus --- where it's not even in use.  I have some 
	purely archival files on it).

<br><br>
	While MS Windows users were essentially forced to upgrade their 
	systems to 486's and Pentiums in order to keep upgraded one their 
	OS and major, critical software, I've been able to continue using 
	my old system.

<br><br>
	It wasn't until mid last year that I finally moved my home
	directory over to one of the Pentiums (<tt>Gnus</tt>, a newsreader for 
	Emacs, just got to be <strong>too</strong> slow when I wanted to 
	read a few thousand messages in a mailing list archive --- it would
	take two hours threading through them in the background before
	I could read them --- that same process take about 2 minutes
	on Canopus, the P166).

<br><br>
	So, one advantage of Linux is its support for older equipment
	and unfashionable modes of use.  Text mode is still widely used
	--- but every time I hear an "old-timer" say so it's amazing
	the looks it generates among "hip, savvy, modern users."

<br><br>
	A byproduct of this support is that Linux is very friendly to
	blind and other physically 
	<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Access-HOWTO.html"
	>challenged users</a>.   A friend of mine
	was hit with a stroke a couple of years ago.  He has yet to 
	regain significant use of one of his arms.  Linux and MacOS are
	the easiest environments for him to use.  It is trivial to
	enable "sticky" shift (Ctrl, Alt, and Shift) keys --- so that 
	the user never has to co-ordinate the operation of two keys
	simultaneously (an action which the vast majority of us
	take completely for granted).

<br><br>
	Once you reconfigure you keyboard under Linux <strong>all</strong> 
	of the console applications use the new bindings.  I've never seen
	a conflict.  You can also configure similar features in X Windows 
	(XFree86).   Thus you can, with changes to the configuration of two 
	subsystems, make every application on the system behave in a way 
	that's compatible with a user's needs.

<br><br>
	(It is also simple to associate these changes with a particular
	user -- so that other users of that system will not normally 
	be affected by them).

<br><br>
	I could go on and on.  However, it would make sense for you
	to look at some of the other sites on the web that talk
	about Linux.  Obviously you'll be completely overwhelmed if 
	you do a Yahoo! search on just "Linux" (they are up to
	13 categories and almost 600 sites --- compared to 17/1900
	for "Unix" and about 19/660 for "Microsoft Windows" and
	2/16 for MacOS) 

<br><ul>
	<li>(Granted that this is an incredibly simplistic
		 metric.  It is nonetheless amusing.  Incidentally
		 Alta Vista gives about 2 million hits with "Linux" 
		 and about 21 million with "Microsoft Windows" and
		HotBot only gives 1.3 million to Linux and 1.2 million
		to "Microsoft Windows")
	</ul>

	My point is that there are too many of these to explore in
	a reasonable amount of time (I supposed you could surf the
	Yahoo! listed Linux sites in about 10 hours if you averaged 
	only one minute per page --- and didn't follow any of them
	to anywhere else).

<br><br>
	Obviously the Linux Gazette is one place to find out more,
	and the Linux Weekly News (<a href="http://www.lwn.net/"
		>http://www.lwn.net/</a>) (formerly at <tt>
		http://www.eklektix.com/lwn/</tt> is pretty good too 
		(and comes out four times as often).  If you 
	start at SSC's Linux Resources Page 
	(<a href="http://www.linux.resources.com/"
		>http://www.linux.resources.com/</a>) and follow all 
	links there you should get your fill of unabashed Linux advocacy.
