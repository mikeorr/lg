Hello Mike,
 
How are you? I hope everything has been well for you and Linux
Gazettein 2007. With the end of the year approaching I would like
Linux Gazette to consider spending a portion of your remaining budget
on stock photography from [SITE].
 
As you may already know [SITE] offers high quality royalty free images
for as little as $1.  It is the perfect solution for art directors,
graphic artists, and marketing professionals looking for creative
royalty free imagery to illustrate such things as magazine ads,
websites, billboards, flyers, and presentations.
 
Our images are collected from some of the top photographers and
artists around the world, actually over 60,000 of them. With this huge
collection of talent we have built an amazing database of 2.7 million
royalty free images covering all types of categories, subjects, and
themes.
 
Selling "High Quality" images at $1 might sound unbelievable, and
possibly illegal. But I assure you [SITE] does offer beautiful and
legal images at prices starting from $1. So check us out today! [SITE]
 
If you no longer wish to receive these emails, or you wish to update
your profile, please click here.
</pre>
 --- End forward ---
</p>

<p>
How did I get a profile when I've never been to [SITE]?  But more
importantly, this is a great idea!  Let's spend LG's entire graphics
budget and come up with a spiffy new look!!!  Beautiful artwork from
world-renowned artists would really increase our circulation.  The LG
accountant tells me our graphics budget is $0, which should just be
enough.

<p>
If we are going to go ahead with this, then we are going to do it the Right Way. I propose the following allocation of the budget (*hands out pie charts*):
</p>

<p>
Staff: 20%
Marketing of new look: 40%
New look (their prices are so good!): 30%
Emergency/X-factor: 10%
</p>

<p>
It must be made clear that this cannot take away from the time of the editorial staff. Publishing quality content is of the most importance.
</p>

<p>
Scripts will need to be rewritten. Sorry coders, but there just isn't enough room in the budget; look at the pie!

Stuff and nonsense! Due to our forward-looking initiatives, our
transitively-metabasic financial operational procedures [1], and our
sophisticated implementations of hand-waving protocols, we have managed
to allocate 100% - no, 117.368% [2] of the total budget - to <em>each</em> of
our departments. All department heads, please note that your bank
accounts have been increased by that precise amount already.
</p>

<p>
Also, I've written a sophisticated financial calculator for all LG related
transactions. It looks kinda like this:
</p>

|  | | | |  |     |     |
|  | |_| |  |  *  |  =  |

It's very reassuring, since its answers <em>always</em> correspond to my
estimates...
</p>



<p>
[1] As the Russian saying goes, "pouring from the empty into the
hollow."
</p>

<p>
[2] Nobody trusts round numbers, especially in statistics. This one is
<em>clearly</em> a product of strenuous research [3].
</p>

<p>
[3] Or a diseased mind, but that's a vanishingly small probability -
somewhere around 0.0000056287%.
