<h1>Secure Communication with Stunnel</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/odonovan.html">Barry O'Donovan</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<a href="http://stunnel.mirt.net/">Stunnel</a> is an SSL encryption
wrapper that allows what are normally plain text and insecure
communications to be encrypted during transmission. Stunnel recently
went through some major changes and the current version (4.x) has a
completely different architecture than previous versions. In this
article I will be dealing exclusively with the new version.

<p>
One of Stunnel's most common uses is encrypting communications between POP or
IMAP mail servers and e-mail clients. Both of these protocols require users
to authenticate themselves with a username and a password. In the majority of
cases, these usernames and passwords are the same ones as they would use for
logging into the machine locally or remotely via SSH. Without using Stunnel
to encrypt this data, anyone intercepting the transmission could now log into
your server and gain elevated privileges much easier than a local exploit
would require. 

<h3>2. Getting and Installing Stunnel</h3>

Stunnel is generally included as a precompiled package with most common
distributions and is possibly already installed on your system. If not,
locate the package on your distribution's installation CDs or download
it from the distribution's website.

<p>
The source code is released under the GNU General Public License and, as
such, is freely available for download and installation. The current
version (which at time of going to press was 4.05) can be downloaded
from <a
href="ftp://stunnel.mirt.net/stunnel/">ftp://stunnel.mirt.net/stunnel/</a>.
To compile and install Stunnel, download the source code tarball from here and
then execute the following commands:
<pre>
$ tar zxf stunnel-4.XX.tar.gz
$ cd stunnel-4.XX
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install   (as root)
</pre>


<h3>3. Generating a Self-Signed Certificate</h3>

In order to use Stunnel we must first have a certificate-key pair. If you
compiled from sources then such a pair will have been created for you
automatically (<code>stunnel.pem</code>). Some pre-built binary packages may
include a certificate-key pair, some may generate one as part of the
installation procedure and others may leave it up to the user to generate one.

<p>
The easiest way of generating a certificate-key pair is by using a script
provided with Stunnel's source code. If you're compiling from the tarball,
just issue the following additional commands in the source directory:

<pre>
$ cd tools
$ make stunnel.pem
</pre>

I have decided to put the specific details outside the scope of this article,
but if you are interested in the actual details then have a look at the
<code>Makefile</code> in the "tools" directory.

<h3>4. Using Stunnel to Encrypt POP3/IMAP</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>This method can be used to encrypt any similar service where
SSL-enabled clients exist and are readily available. Most e-mail clients
are SSL-enabled for POP3, IMAP and SMTP, most internet clients (web
browsers) are enabled for HTTPS, etc.</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
Once Stunnel is installed and you have generated a certificate-key pair,
you are only a simple configuration file away from using Stunnel to encrypt
your communications. A simple one that would encrypt POP3 and IMAP
communications would be:

<pre class="code">
# Sample stunnel configuration file for POP3/IMAP

# Provide the full path to your certificate-key pair file
cert = /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem

# lock the process into a chroot jail
chroot = /usr/local/var/run/stunnel/
# and create the PID file in this jail
pid = /stunnel.pid

# change the UID and GID of the process for security reasons
setuid = nobody
setgid = nobody

# Configure our secured POP3 and IMAP services

[pop3s]
accept  = 995
connect = 110

[imaps]
accept  = 993
connect = 143
</pre>

<p>
Using this configuration, any encrypted connection coming in on port 995
(POP3s) will be decrypted and forwarded to the local service (POP3) on port
110. When the local POP3 service responds, it will be encrypted by Stunnel
and transmitted back through port 995. Similarly for IMAPs on port 993.

<p>
Stunnel operates as a daemon service by default, so to start it off with this
configuration we can simply execute:

<pre>
stunnel stunnel-secure-email.conf
</pre>

where <code>stunnel-secure-email.conf</code> is the text file containing the
above configuration; ensure you change the paths so that they are correct 
for your system.

<p>
We can set up Stunnel to start during boot-up by placing the appropriate
command in the <code>rc.local</code> file that is usually contained in
<code>/etc/rc.d/</code>. This file is the last file executed during a system
boot and it is generally used by system administrators for their own
initialisation stuff. When placing commands in this script, use fully 
qualified paths such as:

<pre>
/path/to/stunnel /path/to/the/configuration-file
</pre>

<p class="editorial">[ For Debian and similar distros without an 'rc.local',
the procedure varies slightly: modify a copy of "/etc/init.d/skeleton"
(named, e.g., "/etc/init.d/stunnel") to run the above and create a link to
it from the appropriate runlevel (usually /etc/rc2.d/). -- Ben ]

<p>
Stunnel can also be used with (<code>x</code>)<code>inetd</code> if 
preferred. You can find further details in Stunnel's man page.

<h3>5. Using Stunnel to Encrypt MySQL Transactions</h3>

<blockquote>
<em>This method can be used to encrypt any service where neither
the server nor the client are SSL-enabled. Common examples include CVS, MySQL,
etc.</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the example with POP3 and IMAP above, we were only concerned with
providing the server with SSL encryption as the clients generally have this
built in. However, neither the standard MySQL server nor client have SSL
capabilities - but we can still use Stunnel to provide this.

<p>
It involves using a Stunnel daemon on both the server's machine and the
client's machine. The configuration for the server side is similar to the one
we used above for POP3/IMAP. The default MySQL port is 3306, and since no
port is reserved for secure MySQL connections, I will use 3307:

<pre class="code">
# Sample stunnel configuration file for securing MySQL (server side)

# Provide the full path to your certificate-key pair file
cert = /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem

# lock the process into a chroot jail
chroot = /usr/local/var/run/stunnel/
# and create the PID file in this jail
pid = /stunnel.pid

# change the UID and GID of the process for security reasons
setuid = nobody
setgid = nobody

# Configure our secured MySQL server

[mysqls]
accept  = 3307
connect = 3306
</pre>

I can now start the Stunnel daemon on the server machine with:

<pre>
$ stunnel stunnel-mysql-server.conf
</pre>

where <code>stunnel-mysql-server.conf</code> is a text file containing the
above configuration. We also need to set up an Stunnel daemon on the client
machine with the following configuration:

<pre class="code">
# Sample stunnel configuration file for securing MySQL (client side)

# Provide the full path to your certificate-key pair file
cert = /usr/local/etc/stunnel/stunnel.pem

# lock the process into a chroot jail
chroot = /usr/local/var/run/stunnel/
# and create the PID file in this jail
pid = /stunnel.pid

# change the UID and GID of the process for security reasons
setuid = nobody
setgid = nobody

# enable client mode
client = yes

# Configure our secured MySQL client

[mysqls]
accept  = 3306
connect = 1.2.3.4:3307
</pre>

You'll notice that I have used a new option: <code>client = yes</code> - this
enables "client mode" which lets Stunnel know that the remote service uses
SSL. Our local Stunnel daemon will now listen for connections on the local
MySQL port (3306), encrypt them and forward them to our MySQL server machine (say
1.2.3.4) where another Stunnel is listening on port 3307. The remote Stunnel
will decrypt the transmission and forward it to the MySQL server listening on
port 3306 of the same machine. All responses will be sent back through the 
same encrypted channel.

<p>
Save the client configuration as <code>stunnel-mysql-client.conf</code> and
start off Stunnel with:

<pre>
$ stunnel stunnel-mysql-client.conf
</pre>

and then you can connect to the remote MySQL server through the encrypted
channel by connecting to the local Stunnel daemon (which is listening on 
MySQL's 3306 port):

<pre>
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u username -p
</pre>


<h3>6. Trouble Shooting</h3>

Stunnel can be a bit tricky about permissions - especially when using a
chroot jail and reducing your user and group ID to <code>nobody</code> (some
systems might need <code>nogroup</code> for <code>setgid</code>). Ensure your
chrooted directory is writable by the <code>nobody</code> user and/or the
<code>nobody</code> (or <code>nogroup</code>) group.

<p>
Stunnel runs in the background by default and doesn't show any error
messages. This means you won't know if it worked or not from the command
line! You can check that the process is running by searching the output of
the <code>ps</code> command:

<pre>
$ ps -ef | grep stunnel
nobody   21769     1  0 09:12 ?        00:00:00 /usr/local/sbin/stunnel ./stunnel-mysql-server.conf
</pre>

<p>
Stunnel can also be instructed to run in the foreground by adding the 
following command to the configuration file (above the service configuration):

<pre class="code">
foreground = yes
</pre>

<p>
As with all services, the best method of diagnosing problems is through
the service's log messages. You can enable Stunnel's logging facilities
by adding the following commands to the configuration file (above the 
service configuration):

<pre class="code">
debug = 7
output = /tmp/stunnel.log
</pre>

<p>
If you are running in the foreground for testing/debugging, then you 
might prefer to send the log messages to standard out:

<pre class="code">
debug = 7
output = /dev/stdout
</pre>

<h3>7. Further Reading/References</h3>

There are many other commands that can be used in the configuration
files and these are all listed in Stunnel's man page 
(<code>STUNNEL(8)</code>).
