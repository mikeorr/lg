Hi!
     I have 3 distro`s installed in my system , Debian Etch , Xubuntu Feisty
and PCQLinux 2007(Based on Fedora Core 6). My TimeZone is Asia/Calcutta. Is
there anyway I can make all the distro`s show the right time.I don`t want to
use NTP since the system is not connected to the Internet all the
time.. Since Each time I boot into a distro it adds 5:30 to the system clock
and shows it as the time. By afternoon it shows 10 pm the next day ! Is there
anyway to make them show the right time ?
</p>

<p>
Cheers!
Vignesh

You clearly have mis-informed(!) your O/Ses about the computer clock.
In the solution outlined below I assume that you want to keep your
system clock at IST(=Asia/Calcutta). There is also a solution which
keeps the system time at UTC which is left as an exercise.
</p>

<p>
Do the following in all your O/Ses:
1. Configure your systems to not assume the system clock is UTC.
   (In Debian/Ubuntu this is in /etc/default/rcS "UTC=no").
2. Configure your systems use IST as local time (using tzconfig).
3. Configure your login environment to use system time.
   (Remove any configurations of TZ you may have in your .bashrc).
</p>

<p>
Do the following *once*:
4. Set your computer clock to the "correct" IST time as per the
   radio station.
</p>

<p>
On a separate note. It is no longer necessary to keep re-booting your
system to "enjoy" multiple distributions. Many different
virtualisation solutions are currently available. You can run all
three of your O/Ses at the same time (providing you have a
sufficiently quick system).
</p>

<p>
On yet another note. NTP would not work for you anyway since it only
"adjusts" the clock. It would normally not attempt to fix a drastic
deviation like 5:30 hours.
</p>

<p>
