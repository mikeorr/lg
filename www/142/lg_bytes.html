<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Citrix to Acquire XenSource for
$.5b</h3>

<p>
Citrix Systems agreed to acquire XenSource, an open source leader in virtual
infrastructure solutions.  Originally created at the University of Cambridge,
the Xen virtualization "engine" is now developed collaboratively by an active
open source community of senior engineers at many of the industry's most
innovative infrastructure companies, including leading hardware vendors like
Intel, IBM, HP and AMD. This open collaborative approach significantly
accelerates the innovation of the Xen engine, leading to continual
state-of-the-art improvements in performance, scalability and cross-platform
support. The next-generation Xen architecture is widely acknowledged for its
industry-leading performance, efficiency, security and native support for the
latest hardware-assisted virtualization features.  The acquisition announcement
follows a substantial new release of XenEnterprise, the company's flagship
commercial product line powered by the Xen engine.  
</p> 

<p>
With this deal, it appears that the Xen hypervisor and virtualization
technology will tilt even more toward Windows use and more inter-play
with Microsoft's Veridian technology. It may also allow Citrix to offer more
than just plain Windows sessions with its terminal servers. Other
virtualization technologies, like OpenVZ, may get more attention in the wake of
this acquisition.  
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">LinuxWorld Awards Go to
Ubuntu 7.08, EnterpriseDB, and Unicon.</h3>

<p>
LinuxWorld.com and IDG World Expo, producers of major trade shows and events,
announced the winners of the LinuxWorld.com "Product Excellence Awards" at the
recent San Francisco LinuxWorld Conference.
</p> 

<p>
The awards distinguish product and service innovations by LinuxWorld exhibitors
in different areas, including an overall "Best of Show" award. "Best of Show" 
went to Unicon Systems for their System On Display product, the world's
smallest Linux computer with a touch screen. The winners were recognized during
a ceremony at the annual LinuxWorld and Next Generation Data Center Conference
& Expo in San Francisco.  System-on-Display (SoD) is an ultra-slim Chip-on-Film
(CoF) platform based on ARM9 CPU, running full Linux 2.6.19 and attached to the
back of a desirably-sized touch screen. The reference design based on SoD is a
platform with multiple connectivity options including WiFi, high speed USB,
GSM, BlueTooth and security.
</p> 

<p>
Ubuntu 7 was awarded as the best desktop solution. Other notable winners
included EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 8.2  for Best Database Solution. A
complete list of winners is available here: <a
href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/live/12/media//news/CC915442">

</p>

<p>
IDG World Expo, the hosts of LinuxWorld and the Next Generation Data Center
Conference (NGDC), announced that the two conferences attracted more than
11,000 participants and 200 exhibitors. The events showcased open source and
data center technologies with more than 100 educational sessions featuring
desktop Linux, mobile Linux, and virtualization in the data center.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu also won Enterprise Open Source Magazine's Readers' Choice Award for
the "Best Linux Distribution,"  winning a vote by members of the open source
community. The award was announced at the 2007 Enterprise Open Source
Conference in New York.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">IBM Consolidates ~4000 Servers
with Linux</h3>

<p>
In a major transformation of its worldwide data centers, IBM launched an
effort to consolidate almost 4,000 computer servers onto about 30
refrigerator-sized "System z" mainframes running Linux, a ratio of 133:1. This
mainframe and virtual server environment will consume about 80 percent less
energy and save more than $250 million over five years in energy, software and
system support costs.  The initiative is part of "Project Big Green", a broad
commitment that IBM announced in May to sharply reduce data center energy
consumption and make infrastructure more flexible to evolving business needs.
IBM has over 8,000,000 square feet of data center space (equivalent to 139
football fields) and operates the world's largest data center operations, with
major locations in New York, Connecticut, Colorado, the United Kingdom, Japan,
and Australia. IBM's new global infrastructure will run on Linux and support
over 350,000 users.  
</p>

<p>
"As one of the world's largest technology providers, IBM consistently assesses
how our systems can be maximized to support our employees and clients," said
Mark Hennessy, Vice President and Chief Information Officer of Enterprise On
Demand Transformation. "A global account consolidation truly demonstrates that
IBM is committed to driving stronger energy and technology optimization, and
cost savings." 
</p>

<p>
The 3,900 servers - almost 25% of 16,000 servers at IBM worldwide - will be
recycled by IBM Global Asset Recovery Services, which will process and properly
dispose of the 3,900 reclaimed systems. Newer units will be refurbished and
resold through IBM's sales force and partner network, while older systems will
be harvested for parts or sold for scrap. Prior to disposition the machines
will be scrubbed of all sensitive data. Any unusable e-waste will be properly
disposed following environmentally compliant processes.  The IBM mainframe's
ability to run the Linux operating system is key to the consolidation project
and leverages the ability of a single mainframe to behave as hundreds of
individual servers.  Each of these virtual servers acts like a  physical
machine. The links between virtual servers, provided by HiperSockets technology
on System z servers, provides faster communication when compared to Ethernet
links. The plan calls for v-server migration only using a portion of each 
mainframe, leaving room for future growth.
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">IBM Expands Support for the
Solaris OS on x86 Systems</h3>

<p>
Turning the data center world upside-down, IBM will now distribute the Solaris's
Operating System (OS) and Solaris Subscriptions for select x86-based IBM
clients. The agreement is an extension of IBM's existing support for the
Solaris OS on select IBM BladeCenter servers.  
</p>  

<p>
One reason that IBM is now supporting Solaris is that the OS is supported on
more than 820 x86 platforms and runs more than 3,000 unique x86 applications
including IBM Websphere, Lotus, DB2, Rational and Tivoli. IBM and Sun's support
of interoperability via open standards also helps customers by connecting new
platforms easily while preserving their initial investments.
</p>

<p>
As part of the deal, Sun and IBM will invest in testing and system
qualification so joint customers will realize Solaris' leading performance and
reliability on BladeCenter and System x servers. IBM servers that will support
the Solaris OS include: IBM BladeCenter HS21 and LS41, and IBM System
x3650, System x3755, and System x3850 servers.
</p> 

<p>
In the teleconference announcing the deal, Sun CEO Jonathan Schwartz called it
"...a tectonic shift in the market landscape."
</p>  

<p>
"IBM is the first major x86 vendor to have such an agreement with Sun, and the
first big vendor apart from Sun to offer Solaris on blade servers. Today we
expand that agreement to help clients migrate to Solaris on IBM x86-based
System x servers," said Bill Zeitler, Senior Vice President and Group Executive
for the IBM Systems and Technology Group.
</p> 

<p>
The Solaris OS was recently open-sourced and offers Solaris ZFS, Predictive
Self-Healing, and Solaris Dynamic Tracing (DTrace) to improve uptime and cut
operational costs.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">IBM and Novell Join Forces on
Open Source Collaboration</h3>

<p>
At the opening of LinuxWorld in San Francisco, IBM and Novell announced that
they will join forces in the growing open source application server market.
Under the agreement Novell will deliver and support WebSphere Application
Server Community Edition (WAS CE) as part of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. The
two companies will also work on an open collaboration client for Linux desktop
users. 
</p>

<p>
The agreement comes on the heels of the one millionth distribution of WAS CE,
which is based on Apache Geronimo and free to download and use. IBM and Novell
will offer support and migration tools to help customers using JBoss to quickly
and easily move to WAS CE. Combining WAS CE with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
from Novell provides an unbeatable combination for the small and medium-size
business market, where Novell excels, and a compelling offering for enterprise
customers with distributed computing environments.  IBM and Novell will team up
on joint marketing and sales campaigns targeting customers around the world.  
</p>

<p>
The partnership will provide customers with an enterprise-ready open source
alternative to JBoss, while developers will have the opportunity to build on a
tested platform in WAS CE, with the full support of IBM, Novell, and the open
source community.
</p> 

<p>
"Customers today are looking for an integrated solution to solve their
application development needs," said Roger Levy, Senior Vice President and
General Manager of Open Platform Solutions for Novell. "Novell and IBM have
partnered to bring customers a best-in-class experience by delivering two
powerful software platforms through one channel. Now, when customers need
support for their open source operating system or their open source application
server, they can get it with one phone call to Novell."
</p> 

<p>
In addition to the agreement with Novell, IBM is introducing WAS CE 2.0.  WAS
CE 2.0 will have full Java EE 5 standard support.  A research report from Evans
Data found that WAS CE is growing quickly and has gained market share nearly
three times as fast as JBoss in 2006.  
</p> 

<p>
WAS CE 2.0 will be available later this year.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">OpenSUSE Beta and New Build
Service</h3>

<p>
On the second anniversary of the openSUSE project in August, the community
program marked two new milestones: the availability of the first Beta of
openSUSE 10.3 and an expansion of the openSUSE Build Service.
</p>  

<p>
OpenSUSE 10.3 offers a state of the art operating system based on Linux kernel
2.6.22 with a large variety of the latest open source applications for
desktops, servers, and application development. The first Beta of openSUSE 10.3
is now available at <a href="http://www.opensuse.org/download">
http://www.opensuse.org/download</a>.
</p>

<p>
The new openSUSE Build Service provides an infrastructure for software
developers to easily create and compile packages for multiple Linux distros. In
the first version of the build service, users of many distros - openSUSE, SUSE
Linux Enterprise, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, or Mandriva - can search and browse
for new software for their distribution. Users of the upcoming openSUSE 10.3
can install their software with one click, directly from the Web interface. In
the past four months more than 13 million packages have been downloaded from
the openSUSE Build Service as developers build packages for various
distributions using the tool.
</p>

<p>
The openSUSE Build Service is an open source build system that helps
developers provide high quality packages for multiple distributions from
the same source code. With the system imaging tool, KIWI, open source
developers can quickly build a Linux distribution that meets their needs,
rigorously test it to ensure product quality, and easily package it for quick
installation.
</p>

<p>
The openSUSE Build Service is completely open source, giving developers and
users free and full access to build their choice of Linux packages. Those
packages may be based on openSUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Fedora, Debian,
Ubuntu, or other projects.
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">First Debian 4.0 "Etch" Update Released</h3>

<p>
The Debian project has announced the availability of the first point revision
of Debian GNU/Linux 4.0, code name "Etch". This update adds security updates to
the stable release, together with a few corrections to serious problems and
miscellaneous bug fixes.
</p>

<p>
This release for Etch includes an updated installer, which includes the
following changes: kernels used in the installer have been updated to ABI
2.6.18-5, updated mirror list, support added for certain USB CD drives that
were not being detected, incorrect setup of GKSu fixed when user chooses to
install with the root account disabled, and the removal of the vdrift package.
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">MEPIS Begins a Return to Debian
With Version 7 pre-Beta</h3>

<p>
SimplyMEPIS 6.9.51 pre-Beta is a preview of upcoming SimplyMEPIS 7. It is
available from the MEPIS subscriber site and the MEPIS public mirrors.
</p>

<p>
MEPIS has discontinued using Ubuntu binary packages in favor of a combination
of MEPIS packaged binaries based on Debian and Ubuntu source code, which is
combined with a Debian Stable OS core, and extra packages from the Debian 
package pools.
</p>

<p>
Warren Woodford of MEPIS explains the change, "By using the latest Debian and
Ubuntu source code for building user applications, we can provide the best
latest versions of the applications users want the most. And by building on top
of a Debian Stable core, we can provide a release that has the the stability
and long life that users want."
</p>

<p>
Warren continues, "Most Linux users are tired of having to reinstall every 6
months in order to have up-to-date applications. We expect that with this
approach MEPIS can offer a superior user experience that will be incrementally
upgradeable for 2 years without reinstallation of the OS."
</p>

<p>
The pre-Beta includes a 2.6.22 kernel, Debian Etch core, KDE 3.5.7, Firefox
2.0.0.5, Thunderbird 2.0.0.4, and OpenOffice 2.2.1. This is an early release
with many rough edges. In particular, the 'splashy' boot splash does not run
reliably, some extra kernel drivers are not yet compiled, some GUI components
are not themed for MEPIS, and the pre-Beta has had very limited testing.  
</p>

<p>
32 and 64 bit ISO images are available in the "testing" subdirectory at the
MEPIS Subscriber's Site and at the MEPIS public mirrors.
</p>

<h3>Damn Small Linux 4.0 RC1 Announced</h3>

At SF LinuxWorld, Black Duck Software announced protexIP 4.4, which includes
features specific to recent GPL license changes. The newest version of Black
Duck increases insurance that software is in compliance with licensing
requirements via a significantly enhanced KnowledgeBase of open source and
vendor-added code software components. This includes detailed licensing
information for more than 140,000 components, a doubling from the previous
version.  
</p>   
  
<p>Last month, the Free Software Foundation released GPL version 3. By
mid-August, <a href="http://gpl3.palamida.com:8080/">more than 382* open source
projects</a> have published code under the new license. The protexIP
application assists developers and legal counsel in managing the use of code
from open source projects that have both decided to explicitly switch to GPLv3
and those that have decided not to switch. 
</p>
  
<p>
The solution identifies components within open source projects that have
decided not to switch to GPLv3, such as the Linux kernel, or have simply not
made a decision.  protexIP users set policies through the product to dictate
whether developers can use code governed by the various licenses, and the
solution ensures throughout the development process that licenses governing
code are not in conflict with each other or with company policy.  
</p> 
  
<p>The first release of protexIP 4.4 will be available in September 2007.
Pricing is based on the size of the code base managed by protexIP and the
number of users accessing the solution. The new version and KnowledgeBase are
delivered to existing protexIP customers automatically via a Web update when
available.

</p>

<p>
Lenovo will provide direct support for both the hardware and operating system.
Novell will provide maintenance updates for the operating system directly to
ThinkPad notebook customers. For several years, Lenovo has Linux-certified its
ThinkPad notebook PC line. Lenovo  offers Help Center support for SUSE Linux
Enterprise Desktop 10 on the ThinkPad T60p.
</p>

<p>
Lenovo Linux notebooks will be available beginning in the fourth quarter of
2007
</p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Oracle Offers More Linux
Enhancements</h3>

<p>
Touting its commitment to enhance Linux for all users and emphasizing its goal
to not become another distro, Oracle announced at LinuxWorld new projects and code
contributions to augment the enterprise-class capabilities of Linux. 
Oracle positioned itself as a support provider with a history of contributions
helping to ensure enterprises' success with Linux.  Oracle offered enhancements
including: development of a new file system designed for superior scaling at
the petabyte level; porting the popular Yet another Setup Tool (YaST) to Oracle
Enterprise Linux and the fully compatible Red Hat Enterprise Linux;
open-sourcing tools to streamline testing, collaborating on an interface for
comprehensive data integrity and developing a new asynchronous I/O interface to
reduce complexity. These contributions will be available under appropriate open
source licenses.
</p>

<p>
Oracle's Chris Mason has developed the Btrfs file system to address the
expanding scalability requirements of large storage subsystems. Btrfs will
allow enhanced scalability and simplified management for large storage
configurations, while also adding flexible snapshotting, fast incremental
backups and other features missing from Linux today.
</p> 

<p>
Mason told the Linux Gazette that the work on Btrfs aimed "...to better handle
failures of all kinds and to have enough check-summing to find and repair data
and meta-data.  The goal is to replace ext3 as the main de-facto Linux file
system in the future." An alpha release of the Btrfs file system is available
under the GPL license at: http://oss.oracle.com/projects/btrfs/.
</p> 

<p>
Oracle is working to replace the existing asynchronous I/O interface in the
kernel with a more generic subsystem. The new kernel based implementation
should provide a single access point, allowing most system calls to become
asynchronous, thereby reducing complexity at both the kernel and application
level. The new subsystem is expected to be faster for Oracle, is intended
to make it easier for other applications to benefit from asynchronous
programming under any workload.  
</p>

<p>
Oracle has ported the popular system management tool YaST to Oracle Enterprise
Linux and the compatible Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Now available under
GPL, this code can be freely accessed by anyone. Originally developed and made
available under GPL by Novell, YaST has been used with openSUSE and Novell's
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) to enable easy install and configuration of
system software, hardware and networks.
</p> 

<p>
Now available under the GPL and Artistic licenses, the Oracle Linux Test Kit
(derived from the Oracle Validated Configurations program) verifies Linux
kernel functionality and stability essential for the Oracle Database. The test
kit automates steps to define, execute and analyze tests and has DBT2 and DBT3
workloads as well as specialized workload simulators. The Oracle Linux Test Kit
can be used for running tests on Oracle Enterprise Linux, RHEL and SLES
distributions in a variety of topologies. Server and storage vendors can
use the Oracle Linux Test Kit to test and verify that specific hardware and
software combinations for Oracle deployments on Linux.
</p>

<p>
Monica Kumar, senior director of Linux and open source at Oracle, told the Linux
Gazette that an increasing share of of its customers are choosing to run Oracle
on Linux.  She mentioned a GGrp study in June, by Grahm that showed Oracle
holding 42% of the overall DB market , but on Linux 67%. These numbers
were for revenue from commercial DB products, so the share for MySQL and other
non-commercial database products is minimized.  
</p>

<p>
Oracle DB on Linux grew at an 87% annual rate by revenue dollars.  This is based
on sales of $1.9b from Oracle on Linux in 2006.
</p>

<p>
Kumar told the Linux Gazette, "...We have two buckets of customers... the
Fortune 500 and prior Oracle customers and we also have a large number of
customers who are using open source and Oracle Cluster FS and are getting
support from us for both Linux and OCFS. They get support for both at lower
price and its better support." </p> 

<p>
On the issue of forking Linux, Kumar said, "Never... It's not in Oracle's
interest to fork... there is no value proposition for us [or] for our
customers. Linux is [a] commodity so our team focuses all of our energies on
support. We are clear where we can add value and we are clear about not
fragmenting Linux."

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">AMD to release Barcelona in
September</h3>

<p>
AMD is inviting partners, key customers and, analysts to a special event
mid-September in San Francisco Presidio. Part of the event takes place at
George Lucas's Digital Art Center.
</p>   

<p>
The long awaited quad-core Opteron is supposed to pack a processor wallop and
be socket compatible with the current dual core Opterons.   In August, AMD
announced Novell certification for the new chip with SUSE Linux and is
expecting to have other OS vendors ready to support it.   AMD has given samples
to OS vendors so they can optimize to new features on the chip, including
nested page tables for enhanced virtualization.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Intel is showing its partners early samples of their new 45
nanometer chips, which are faster and consume 30% less power than the current
65 nanometer family of chips.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">White Paper on Cost and Data
Retention Aware Backup Solutions</h3>

<p>
On August 13th Asigra announced the availability of a white paper entitled
"Managing the Life Cycles of Backups" that it commissioned from Data Mobility
Group, relating to backup life cycle management. An example of the application
would be a business's tax information, which is very important in the year it
must be filed, but losses importance each subsequent year. However, for
accounting sake and to remain compliant with data retention laws that many
countries have introduced, that data must be kept in a secure location.
According to the white paper, in order to remain cost efficient the data should
be kept in a central location, allowing a business's multiple locations to
manage all of its data.
</p>

<p>
It is of note that the white paper does not appear to be made available to the
public, forcing Asigra's consumers to rely on its press release for digestion
of Data Mobility Group's findings. This is especially questionable when Asigra
makes often claim that its own product was given favorable review. No response
was made in time to the Linux Gazette's inquiries for this month's issue.

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Centric CRM and LoopFuse
Integrate Software Products</h3>

<p>
On August 21st Centric CRM, a developer of customer relationship management
(CRM) software, and LoopFuse, a developer of user and web site usage tracking
software, have integrated their respective products. The two companies each
provide a different aspect of marketing, a sector of business that has enjoyed
the Internet's tracking abilities. Software in this category often provides the
ability to track sales leads, current clients (prevents overlapping in the
sales department), and calculates return on investment (ROI) for marketing
campaigns, all of which LoopFuse and Centric CRM will make available. Their
integration will allow client history and usage data processing to interact
within one application.
</p>

<p>
For example, a company can track what products a potential client views, links
they click on, how often they visit, what they purchased, and their exact
browsing history on their web site. This allows the company to calculate how
likely it is that the user will buy a new product, become a client, etc. This
requires a closer relationship between marketing and sales departments, as the
data from one passes to the other: the marketing department issues a new
advertisement campaign and they track who clicks on those advertisements. The
sales department then tracks how many of those leads turn into sales, producing
a click-to-purchase ratio. These, and other, numbers allow marketing to
evaluate the success of their investment in the advertisement campaign.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Centric CRM correctly claims that they provide an open source solution when
referencing their product Centric Team Elements. However, this is a very minor
product in their catalog. Their primary product is Centric CRM, which is
licensed with a proprietary license that is far from open source. Their usage
of the "OSI Certified" logo appears to be legitimate, as it is only used in
text referencing Centric Team Elements. --S. Bisbee ]

Sam was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA area. His interest in all
things electronic was established early by his electrician father and database
designer mother. Teaching himself HTML and basic web design at the age of 10,
Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science and the
FOSS community. His first Linux install was Red Hat, which he installed on a
Pentium 233GHz i686 when he was about 13. He found his way into the computer
club in high school at Northfield Mount Hermon, a New England boarding school,
which was lovingly named GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and
Science. This venue allowed him to share in and teach the Linux experience to
fellow students and teachers alike. Late in high school Sam was abducted into
the Open and Free Technology Community, had his first article published, and
became more involved in the FOSS community as a whole. After a year at 
Boston University he decided the experience was not for him, striking out on
his own as a software developer and contractor.
