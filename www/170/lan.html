<h1>The Village of Lan: A Networking Fairy Tale</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/moen.html">Rick Moen</a></b></p>

<p>
There was a time, about a year ago, when I was trying to tell people
on a LUG mailing list why they should consider using a genuine,
full-service recursive nameserver on their local networks, rather 
than just the usual forwarders and such.  One of the leading lights of
that LUG countered with his own suggestion:  "Run a caching-only or
caching-mostly nameserver".  Argh!  People get so mislead by such 
really bad terminology.
</p>

<p>
The concept of a "caching" DNS nameserver really doesn't tell you
anything about what the nameserver really does.  <em>All</em>
nameservers cache; that's not a name that conveys useful
information.
</p>

<p>
What I needed, to clarify the matter, was a compelling and vivid 
metaphor, so I conjured one up.  Here's what I posted back to the LUG
mailing list, reproduced for the possible entertainment of <em>Linux
Gazette</em> readers:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Although it's true that some recursive-nameserver configurations are
(sloppily) referred to as "caching", e.g., by RHEL/Fedora/CentOS, that's
a really bad name for that function -- because caching is orthogonal to 
recursion.
</p>

<p>
Theoretically, you could write a nameserver that does recursive service
but doesn't cache its results.  (That would be a bit perverse, and I
don't know of any.)  Conversely, nameserver packages that cache but know
nothing about how to recurse and instead do less-helpful alternative
iterative service
<a href="http://www.inetdaemon.com/tutorials/internet/dns/iterative.shtml">iterative service</a>
are common: dnsmasq, pdnsd, etc.  
</p>

<p>
Last, it's also not unheard-of to create a really modest caching
nameserver package that doesn't do even <em>iterative</em> service of its own,
but is purely a forwarder that knows the IP of a <em>real</em> nameserver -- 
or leaves that job up to the machine's resolver library (DNS client). 
I believe dproxy and nscd would be good examples.
</p>

<p>
And, whether they cache or not (and pretty much <em>everything</em> caches
except OS client resolver libraries), nameservers that aren't
<em>just</em> forwarders offer either recursive or merely iterative
service, which makes a big difference.
</p>

<p>
I know it's not your fault, but terms like "caching-only" and
"caching-mostly" obscure the actual important bits.  Fortunately, I
think I've just figured out how to fully de-obfuscate the topic.  Here:
</p>


<p>
The mythical village of Lan has some talkative people (programs) in it.
Oddly, they spend most of their time talking about DNS data ;-&gt; , but
all have quirks about their respective conversational styles.
</p>


<ul>

<li>
<p>
   Larry, the local DNS library (the crummy BIND8-derived code bundled
   into GNU libc), is the guy with all the questions.  He's the guy 
   who goes around asking other people about DNS records.  Larry has 
   a really awful memory (no cache), so he ends up asking the same
   questions over and over.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Nick (nscd, the nameservice caching daemon) is a kid whom Larry
   has ride on his shoulders occasionally.  Although he doesn't 
   accept queries himself, exactly, he listens to answers Larry 
   gets from others, remembers them, and whispers them in Larry's
   ear when the forgetful old guy is about to go bother others about
   them yet again.  Larry's glad to carry Nick around, to help
   compensate for his memory problem.  On the downside, Nick's a
   bit sloppy and doesn't bother to commit to memory the data's
   spoiled-by dates.  (He doesn't cache TTLs.)
</p>

<p>
   (I hear that the Linux nscd implementation's rather severe fault of
   not caching TTLs is slated to soon be fixed.  Meanwhile, smart people
   don't use its host caching functions.)
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Frank is a forwarder (a copy of dproxy).  He's not really bright,
   but has a pretty good memory.  If you ask him a DNS question, he
   either says "Dunno, so I'll ask Ralph", or he says "Hey, someone
   asked me that just yesterday, and I got the answer via Ralph.
   Let's see if I still have the paper... yes.  Here's your IP (or
   other requested datum -- and you're in luck, as it still has 6
   days remaining in its TTL)."  Thus, he forwards all queries he 
   receives -- always to Ralph only, never anyone more suited to the 
   query -- and caches whatever Ralph tells him.  
</p>

<p>
   When Larry gets such answers, he might also seek some context
   information from Frank.  (Remember, Larry has sucky short-term
   memory.)  "Hey, Frank, thanks.  Is that answer something you know
   from your own knowledge?"  "No, man, it's just what I hear."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Nils is an authoritative nameserver (running the "nsd" software), 
   charged ONLY with answering questions of the form "What is
   [foo].lanvillage.com?"  When Larry asks him such a question, he
   answers and adds that it <em>is</em> from his own knowledge (authoritative).
   If you ask him about anything outside lanvillage.com, he
   frowns and say "Dunno, man."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Ralph is a recursive nameserver (an instance of PowerDNS 
   Recursor).  Ralph is a born researcher:  He doesn't have any
   DNS knowledge of his own (offers no authoritative service), but 
   absolutely lives for finding out what DNS data can be unearthed
   from guys in other villages.  If you ask him a DNS question, 
   he'll figure out whom to ask, go there regardless of where it
   takes him, if necessary chase around the state following leads,
   and only bother you when he has the final answer.  (This is 
   the "recursive" part.  Compare with the iterative approach,
   below.)  Like everyone else in this village except Larry, he
   has a good memory (caching).
</p>
   
<p>
   Let's say, Larry asks Ralph, "What's uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com?"
   In the worst case, if Ralph is just back from vacation (has a
   depleted cache), Ralph goes off for a while, and says:  "I
   looked on my desk to see if the answer were there (in cache),
   but it wasn't.  So, I checked to see if answers to the question
   'Where are nameservers for the linuxmafia.com domain?' were there,
   but they weren't either.  So, I check to see if answers to the 
   question 'Where are nameservers for the .com top-level domain?'
   were there, but they weren't either.  So, I finally fell back
   on my Rolodex's list of 13 IP addresses of root nameservers, 
   picked one, and visited it.  I asked it where I can get answers
   to .com questions.  It gave me a list of .com nameserver IPs.
   I picked one, visited it, and asked who knows about linuxmafia.com
   DNS matters.  It gave me a list of linuxmafia.com IPs, I picked
   one, visited it, asked it where uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com is,
   brought the answer back, and here y'are.  Oh, and I've made a 
   note who knows where .com information is, where specifically
   linuxmafia.com information is, and also where
   uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com is, just in case I'm asked again."
</p>

<p>
   Larry's fond of Ralph, because Ralph does all the work and
   doesn't come back until he can give either the answer or
   "Sorry, this took too long", or "There's no such host", or 
   something similarly dispositive.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
   Dwayne is a nameserver offering iterative service only 
   (running dproxy).  You can get any DNS answer out of him
   <em>eventually</em>, but he's not willing to bounce around the state
   following leads.  A conversation with Dwayne is sort of 
   punctuated:<br>
   "Do you know where uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com is?"  "No."<br>
   "Well, do you know who knows?"  "No."<br>
   "Well, do you know who knows where to find .com nameservers?" "No."<br>
   "Well, can you ask the root nameserver where to find .com
      nameservers?"  "OK."  [Gives list of 13.]<br>
   "Can you ask .com nameserver #1 who answers for linuxmafia.com?"
      "OK."  [Gets list of five nameserver IPs.]<br>
   "Can you ask linuxmafia.com nameserver #1 where
       uncle-enzo.linuxmafia.com is?"  "OK."  [Queries and gets answer.]
</p>

<p>
   Next time Dwayne is asked any of the first three questions, his
   answer is no longer "No", because he is able to answer from memory
   (cache).
</p>
   
<p>
   Notice that Dwayne, although not as helpful and resourceful as
   Ralph, is at least going about things a bit more intelligently
   than Frank does:  Dwayne is able to look up the chain of people
   outside to query (iteratively) to find the right person, whereas
   Frank's idea of research is always "Ask Ralph."
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
At the outskirts of the Village of Lan is a rickety rope-bridge to the
rest of the state.  (Think "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom", or 
"Samurai Jack and the Scotsman".)  All of Lan's commerce has to go over
that bridge (an analogy to, say, a SOHO network's overburdened DSL
line).  Frank or Dwayne's bouncing back and forth across that bridge 
continually gets to be a bit of a problem, because of bridge congestion.
Ralph's better for the village, because he tends to go out, wander
around the state, and then come back -- minimising traffic.  And all of
these guys with functional short-term recall (everyone but Larry)
is helping by avoiding unnecessary bridge crossings.
</p>

<ul>

<li>
<p>
    On the far side of the (slow, rickety, congested) ropebridge is
    Ollie (the OpenDNS server).  Ollie is willing to do recursive
    service the way Ralph does, but instead of saying "I checked,
    and there is no such DNS datum" where that is the correct answer,
    it says "guide.opendns.com" (IP 208.67.219.132), which is the
    IP of a OpenDNS Web server, advertising-driven, that tries to 
    give you helpful Web results (plus ads) -- something that's 
    less than useful, and in fact downright harmful, if what's 
    attempting to use DNS isn't a Web browser.  (Gee, ever heard
    of e-mail, for example?)
</p>

<p>
    I don't know about you, but I think "That place doesn't exist"
    is a better answer than "guide.opendns.com, IP 208.67.219.132",
    when "That place doesn't exist" <em>is</em> in fact the objectively 
    correct answer.  Ollie says:
</p>

<code>
$ dig i-dont-exist.linuxmafia.com @resolver2.opendns.com +short<br>
208.67.219.132
</code>
 
<p>
    By contrast, my own nameserver gives the actually correct answer:
</p>

<code>
$ dig i-dont-exist.linuxmafia.com @ns1.linuxmafia.com +short<br>
$
</code>

<p>
    (Specifically, it says "NXDOMAIN", which means "That place doesn't 
    exist.")
</p>
</li>

</ul>


<p>
Getting back to Larry:  Larry can outsource all of his queries across
the rickety, thin, congested ropebridge to Ollie -- and spend time 
waiting for Ollie and watching him barge continually across it every
time there's a query -- and know that Ollie gives bullshit answers every
time the correct answer <em>should</em> be "That place doesn't exist."
</p>

<p>
Larry can use Dwayne's services -- something of an exercise in
frustration but better than nothing.  He can tap Frank, which is
<em>barely</em> better than nothing.  Or, he can use Ralph.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of whom he asks, he <em>can</em> let Nick ride on his shoulders and
serve as his aide-memoire -- with the drawback that Nick carelessly 
disregards something really, really important (TTLs).
</p>

<p>
Personally, if I were Larry, I'd give Frank, Dwayne, and Ollie a pass, 
dump Nick, and give Ralph a call.

Rick has run freely-redistributable Unixen since 1992, having been roped
in by first 386BSD, then Linux.  Having found that either one 
<a href="http://linuxmafia.com/cabal/os-suck.html">sucked less</a>, he blew
away his last non-Unix box (OS/2 Warp) in 1996.  He specialises in clue
acquisition and delivery (documentation &amp; training), system
administration, security, WAN/LAN design and administration, and
support.  He helped plan the LINC Expo (which evolved into the first
LinuxWorld Conference and Expo, in San Jose), Windows Refund Day, and
several other rabble-rousing Linux community events in the San Francisco
Bay Area.  He's written and edited for IDG/LinuxWorld, SSC, and the
USENIX Association; and spoken at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo and
numerous user groups.

<P> His first computer was his dad's slide rule, followed by visitor access
to a card-walloping IBM mainframe at Stanford (1969).  A glutton for
punishment, he then moved on (during high school, 1970s) to early HP
timeshared systems, People's Computer Company's PDP8s, and various
of those they'll-never-fly-Orville microcomputers at the storied
Homebrew Computer Club -- then more Big Blue computing horrors at
college alleviated by bits of primeval BSD during UC Berkeley summer
sessions, and so on.  He's thus better qualified than most, to know just
how much better off we are now.

<P> When not playing Silicon Valley dot-com roulette, he enjoys
long-distance bicycling, helping run science fiction conventions, and
concentrating on becoming an uncarved block.
