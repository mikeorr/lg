Quoting Michael Makuch (linuxgazette at makuch dot org):
</p>

<p>
[You wrote to tag-owner@lists.linuxgazette.net.  I've decided to CC this
response to TAG.]
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Curious. I am subscribed to TAG with the address
&gt; linuxgazette at makuch dot org.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I accidentally sent a message to TAG just now from
&gt; mike8 at makuch dot org, yet the message went through to the list.
&gt; 
&gt; There seems to be a problem with the list if email from any ole
&gt; unregistered email address can send to it...
</pre>

<p>
{sigh}  No, it's a deliberate list configuration.  You're absolutely
right that that particular list configuration is archaic and essentially
never seen (otherwise) on a usable mailing list in this decade, because
of the continually rising spam problem.  TAG has always been set up to
permit non-subscriber posting because of its unique intended role:  It's
supposed to permit any <em>reader</em> of _Linux Gazette_ to address the
mailing list to converse with The Answer Gang.  Doing so of course makes
it <em>very</em> vulnerable to spam.  
</p>

<p>
You will probably have noticed that some spam <em>does</em> get through my MTA
and mailing list software defences.  I (as listadmin and MTA owner)
then manually analyse ASAP any spam that does so, and take immediate
action to ensure that no further mail from that (pick one; whatever
seems most effective and least disruptive of legitimate mail) SMTP HELO
string, or sending address, or sending domain, or IP will be accepted in
the future.  That is of course a no-win strategy with unavoidable
collateral damage, but it's the best I can contrive under the
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
TAG is the only mailing list with that configuration I know that's not
utterly overwhelmed with spam and thereby made useless, so I must be
doing something right.  But the possibility of it, too, getting
overwhelmed is always present.

Rick may I say that you are doing a very very good job of keeping
the spam out of the list.
</p>

<p>
Keep up the good work on this mate!
