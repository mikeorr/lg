Hello TAG!
</p>

<p>
Im doing some research in here, and was wondering if any of you ever
worked with external sensors.
</p>

<p>
What i had in mind was having temp/humidity sensors plugged into my
computer and reading theyr values on linux to use on some program ill
write.
</p>

<p>
If anyone ever did this, what kind of hardware did you use?
</p>

Hi,
</p>

<p>
there are several ways to access your sensors.
</p>


<p>
- attach the sensors to the buses on your mainboard and then use 
lm_sensors/i2c_tools to read them out.
</p>

<p>
This works quite well if you have access to these busses like i2c/spi - but 
unfortunately it isn't that easy (unless you're good with the soldering iron) 
to attach your components to the busses - if you're unexperienced with this, 
it is quite dangerous.
On embedded platforms (like the atmel ngw100) you have accessible io pins that 
you can use - there it is really easy.
</p>

<p>
However since your monitor uses I2C to annouce its EDID/DDC capabilities you 
can use you vga cable to hook up components -- however this might damage your 
hardware too;)

</p>


<p>
- use an arduino / bus-pirate
</p>

<p>
The other, perhaps more sensible method would be to use a arduino or bus-
pirate. There you can access the busses and sensors quite easily, you only 
have to write the software for it.
Arduinos are quite useful and easy to use, so they are quite popular among 
design and multimedia students.
There a plenty of arduino clones, ranging from 20 bucks to over 100.

</p>

<p>
Bus pirate is quite useful if you just want to try a sensor out and see how it 
works.

</p>

<p>
- build your own board using a microcontroller
same as arduino, just the hard way ;) on the other hand it might be more 
comfortable/cheaper.
</p>

<p>
- buy some expensive hardware ;)
Maybe there are even SPI/I2C/IWire expander cards.
</p>


<p>
If you have any further questions, don't be afraid to ask.
</p>

Peter

Hi, Deividson
</p>

<p>
I did a bit of reading on this a while ago.  There are several
approaches.  The USB protocol is quite involved, but one can find kits
that provide a generic USB interface to an AD converter.  Of course, the
AD (analogue/digital) converter is the crux of it all.  Sensors such as
these normally present a varying voltage which the ADC measures and
provides as a digital output.
</p>

<p>
There is a direct relationship between voltage and resistance (V=IR)
which simply states current=voltage/resistence.  In a circuit,
increasing resistance increases voltage for the same current, and
increasing current also increases voltage for the same resistance.
</p>

<p>
The simplest (and cheapest) approach is to convert the reading into a
resistance, and use a joystick port for input, which effectively
provides four AD pins and four switches.  The nice part about using the
joystick port is that the granularity of the measurement depends on your
processing speed-  You trigger and count how long it takes for the port
to reset.  The bad part is that it is non-linear, but one may calibrate
and adjust.
</p>

<p>
Another approach is to front-end your devices with a microprocessor,
such as a PIC, and use the built in PIC/RS232 interface.  This might
take a bit of work, as the RS232 voltages on the PIC are not enough to
drive a TTL load.  Standard line driver chips are available to convert
CMOS to TTL.  Of course there are versions of the PIC that do USB or I2C
as a standard too.  One may also use other microprocessors to do the
job.
</p>

<p>
Here's some reading material:

&gt; Arduino seems to be a great solution - a bit bloated for what im
&gt; trying to to actually, but it would work. My best solution would be
&gt; something where i could plug the  X wires coming from each of the
&gt; sensors and read em directly from the computer (a :=
&gt; read_sensor_value(1); is too much to ask? :P )
</pre>

<p>
Although I'm quite sure this is possible with arduino, maybe you should have a 
look at octopus
</p>

<p>
It has a library/wrappers for C, python etc... I used to work on the 
predecessor (vport) ;)

<p>
YES this is quite common in process control. In fact I did a fairly
huge project once (nickname SMART_LAB) where we had almost 200 sensors
read by SMARTLAB running on a Unix machine.
The best way would be to wire your sensors to a front-end (called a
remote terminal unit). The Unix box interrogates the frontend every so
often and gets the values over a RS 232 serial line. The RTU does all
the analog/digital conversion, linearisation etc., and sends data to
the main machine. There are many configurations and architectres and
protocols possible. RTUs should be available off-the-shelf from
instrumnetation vendors in your city/country.
</p>

<p>
Of course there is the alternative of an instrumentation bus,
connected by DMA to you main system.
</p>

<p>
And of course, you can also tinker with your CPU like it has been
suggested in this list.
</p>

<p>
Good luck,
</p>
