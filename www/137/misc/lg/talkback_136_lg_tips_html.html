&gt; The first item refers to a way to check time handling related tot he time
&gt; change due on 11 March in the USA.  The example command is "date -d '27 
&gt; March'"
&gt; Here is a subsequent partial quote:  "That's the desired output, a week 
&gt; after
&gt; the time change."
&gt; 
&gt; Since I am sure you review contributions, please explain in what calendar
&gt; system 27 March occurs 1 week after 11 March (new date) or 1 April 
&gt; (incorrect
&gt; old rule date).  I am not aware of it.

At times, we all do things that may not have an obvious reason: for
example, send an email (one that smacks of asperity and entitlement) to
an address used only for publication issues in LG rather than using the
'Talkback' link on the bottom of that page that is specifically and
clearly intended for the purpose of discussing that page. A bit hard to
explain, that - particularly the slightly grating tone, eh?
</p>

<p>
In any case, I am CCing this reply to The Answer Gang, where the author
(Rick Moen) can answer you himself. I suspect it was a mistake, but I
will note that it was not one of any substance: as it stands, the
proposed test does exactly what Rick has said it will do - check for
compliance with the time shift. It would be interesting to hear your
explanation of how this has given you grounds for outrage.

<p>
I just erased a two page reply.  Too wordy and waay too serious.
</p>

<p>
I mistakenly omitted the smileys that might have given my original a chiding
rather serious tone! Sorry to strike a nerve <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

<p>
I withdraw my comment - I guess errors that show lack of process
(proofreading) or care are acceptable.  No further taking of your time necessary.
</p>

<p>
BTW - this is not Rick's problem - writers and contributors must have the
freedom to make mistakes.  Especially silly ones. That is why we have editors.
</p>

<p>
If I wanted to complain about the tip, I would have pointed out that it does
not confirm that the change will take place as required.  Merely that it would
be in place at some arbitrary point after it should be effective and before
the old rule would have it be effective.

<p>
It was my "mistake", one of nugatory importance, as exactly how <em>many</em>
days March 27 follows March 11 doesn't actually matter a whit in this
context, and is entirely beside the point.

There was another tack you could have taken, Brandon - 
</p>

<p>
"Hey, I noticed an error on the tips this month. Looks like you guys
could use some help getting those worked on before publication! I'm
sending you my information so that I can join the proofreading team."
</p>

<p>
If you <strong>don't</strong> have time to do this, please also have some compassion
for those of us who are eking time out of our schedules to do our best
to get LG out every month.

FWIW, I <em>did</em> notice, as I rewrote someone's mailing list suggestion
into a "2 cent tip" in the middle of the night, making deadline for the
March issue so it would do some good, that the guy's post-change example
date of March 27 was not <em>exactly</em> a week after the DST change date -- but
that it didn't matter, in that context.
</p>

<p>
For about a femtosecond I considered "fortnight", but some Yanks
wouldn't know that word -- and then inevitably some asshat would write
in saying "16 days isn't a fortnight", and so I thought "Screw it.  Just
doesn't matter." and submitted the tip as-is.

You didn't; rather, your email provided an occasion for amusement.

Brandon, you already struck out in a failed attempt to be an annoyance;
are you now trying for "jerk" with your passive-aggressive games? You're
still failing, but I note that you're still trying - I'm not sure why,
other than as some sort of attempted revenge for being called on your
games. Do the sheep at Webster Ridge not provide you with quite enough
entertainment in the "patchwork of your life"? Or do you need to review
your own Statement on Drug Use?
</p>

<p>
I suggest you stop digging any deeper; you're reaching for "killfiled
idiot" status, and achieving nothing. Contribute something useful, or go
away.
