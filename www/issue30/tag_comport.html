<BR><BR>
 can you  tell me how to readdress COM port2 to port 3 or 4?
 I need to use COM port 2 for other device.

	>No.  I can't.  You'll want to refer to the documentation
	that should have come with your hardware (this is almost
	certainly a hardware issue that is completely unrelated to
	the OS or software that you're running).  The details vary
	among manufacturer, devices and models.

<br><br>
	If you have a couple of COM ports built into your
	motherboard it is possible that you can disable or reset
	the I/O addresses, IRQ's and other details for your COM
	ports via the CMOS setup program (the interface through which
	you set the date and time, the hard drive type and geometry and
	various other firmware settings that are stored in extra registers
	of your PC's clock chip --- a chip which uses CMOS technology
	so that it dissipates very low power consumption and is thus
	suitable for operation off of a battery while the system is
	powered down).

<br><br>
	This "setup" program is usually (almost always) stored in
	the system firmware (the BIOS ROM's on your motherboard) and
	is typically accessible at boot/power-up via some system dependent
	keystroke.  Usually there is a message that is briefly displayed
	to note what the magic keystroke would be --- something like:

<blockquote><code>	"Press &lt;Del&gt; not to enter Setup"
</code></blockquote>
	If that doesn't work (either because your COM ports are not
	on your motherboard or for other reasons) you can open up the
	case and look at the various DIP and/or "berg" (jumper pins)
	settings that you'll find.  Some of them may be labelled.
	There might also be a manufacturer's mark that might lead you
	to a website or phone number where you can get support and
	documentation for the device.

<br><br>
	If you can't find any documentation for some cheap multi-function
	(IDE, floppy, COM, and parallel port) card --- your best bet is to
	buy a new one (typically $10 to $35 US) and toss the old one into
	a drawer as an emergency spare.

<br><br>
	As a final note: please consider what it's like to answer such a
	question.  You give no details about what sort of system you have,
	what you've tried (do you have any docs, have you looked at them),
	what device you're trying to add (odd that it <EM>must</EM> be on COM2
	--- how do you know that), what OS distribution and software
	you're running, etc.

<br><br>
	You send a two line question which cannot be reasonably answered
	in less than fifty.  In IRC and on most newsgroups and mailing
	lists you'd either be ignored or flamed.  We're all volunteers
	here and the one thing we ask is that you do your homework before
	you post.

<br><br>
	I'm not saying this just to sound crabby (if I was going to be
	irate, I'd've just deleted this).  If you don't do your homework
	--- and put considerably more thought and energy into your
	questions than you won't get any satisfaction out of the Linux
	community.
