Dear TAG,
</p>

<p>
I was playing around the command line (learning), and I came across
df(1) reporting block size in "1k-blocks".  But my dumpe2fs(8) says the
block size is 4096 (4K). Shouldn't it be doing thus by default?
</p>

<p>
It seems this is filed as a Bug under Ubuntu (Bug #180415).
</p>

<p>
One suggestion is for the install program to calculate the blocksize at
install time, and put it somewhere safe (immutable). Like 'export
BLOCKSIZE=&lt;whatever&gt;' in /etc/profile.
</p>

<p>
I also saw that adding ' (apostrophe) before the block size will yield
you a digit separator -- cool, eh?
</p>

<p>
I did:
<pre>
BLOCKSIZE="'4096" ls -l
           ^ &lt;- see this?
</pre>

<p>
and it gave me size figures separated by commas! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
My $LANG is en_IN.UTF-8
</p>

<p>
YMMV
</p>

<p>
Regards,
</p>

The magic word is 'Ubuntu', I suppose. Although that seems odd, for
something this basic.

<p>
That would depend very much on your locale...
</p>

<p>
I think mine's set at LANG=en_IN.UTF-8
</p>

<p>
It's the locale that determines how the digits are to be separated.  If your is "C", then no donuts for you. :D
</p>

<p>
Try something like.. LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 BLOCKSIZE="'4096" ls -l...
</p>

<p>
Hey, I also notice that the ".UTF-8" part DOES indeed makes the difference. Any idea why?
</p>

<p>
LANG=en_GB is NOT the same as LANG=en_GB.UTF-8
</p>

<p>
Wonderingly,
</p>

<p>
No.. it's coreutils..
</p>

<p>
The way they handle locale, blocksize etc are different...
</p>

<p>
Trying manipulating the LANG/LC_ALL vars..

It's a different charmap for that locale, thus the different result.
Different $LC_COLLATE, etc. One is configured to separate numbers that
way, the other one isn't. Frankly, I'm a bit puzzled at your puzzlement.

Oh.. I didn't know that ".UTF-8" had such a profound change. But then,
why isn't Thomas Adam not getting the commas?
</p>

<p>
But the purpose of this thread was to know WHY is BLOCKSIZE not set by
distros.  Different partioning software format the filesystem using
different block sizes.
</p>

<p>
df(1), du(1) etc. automatically assumes that the disk is using 1K
blocksize.  Why isn't somebody doing something about it?

Perhaps because his locale isn't set to one that uses commas to separate
numbers that way?

I'd guess it's because it's an optional feature - not everybody wants
to see their data that way, but it's available if you do.

<p>
Again, why should they? If I'm used to seeing the output of 'df' in 1k
blocks, and somebody arbitrarily and suddenly changed it, I'd be pretty
annoyed. Doing it the other way - i.e., sticking with what already
exists and providing options to do it differently - is a) infinitely
expandable and b) not likely to annoy anyone/generate help requests. It
makes a lot of sense to me.
