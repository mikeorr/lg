<h1>Every GLUE User Group To Receive Free Copy of BRU 2000 Backup And Restore
Utility</h1>

<P>
<i>Linux Expo, Research Triangle Park, NC (April 4, 1997)</i> - 
Enhanced Software Technologies, Inc. announced today that Groups of Linux 
Users Everywhere (GLUE) will provide a free copy of the new BRU 2000 backup 
and restore utility to GLUE user groups.

<P>
BRU 2000 offers year 2000 compliant network backup capabilities for UNIX
systems along with support for backups of Windows, Windows NT, and
Macintosh systems.  The new BRU for X11 graphical interface offers the
simplicity of point-and-click operation that makes it easy for UNIX system
administrators to reliably and conveniently backup and restore data across
departmental and enterprise networks.

<P>
"We are enabling GLUE to distribute a not-for-resale copy of BRU to every
GLUE user group to acknowledge the excellent response we've received from
the Linux community," said Ted Cook, President and CEO of Enhanced Software
Technologies, Inc.   "As the Linux community becomes increasingly familiar
with BRU's 'Backup You Can Trust' capabilities, we're certain that BRU will
remain the leading backup utility for Linux systems."

<P>
Enhanced Software Technologies, Inc. has joined Linux International as a
corporate member and is also offering members of GLUE user groups a
10-percent discount on purchases of BRU 2000.

<P>
"We are happy to extend Enhanced Software's generous offer of a BRU 
2000 not-for-resale sample to our member groups. This offer reflects 
Enhanced Software's commitment to the health and growth of the Linux 
community, and is representative of the philosophies and tenets of the 
Linux operating system," said Lydia Kinata of GLUE.
