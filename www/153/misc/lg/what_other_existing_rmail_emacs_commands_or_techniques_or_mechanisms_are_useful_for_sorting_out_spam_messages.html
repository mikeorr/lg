<p>
For nonprogrammer type users what other existing RMAIL Emacs commands
or techniques or mechanisms are useful for sorting out spam messages
more efficiently and effectively?... for example in RMAIL Emacs
laboriously sorting out spam messages can be tried with
Esc C-s Regexp to summarize by: ...
</p>

<p>
For nonprogrammer type users it appears that using existing commands
for each session is an alternative to attempts at composing programs
or tweaking others' programs or the difficulties of dotfiles.

This posting was held by Mailman, and I rejected it with the note "I'm
sorry, Don, but you really cannot dump a 83 kilobyte pile of
documentation onto a discussion mailing list.  Either send only the
relevant (small) extract or put it up somewhere on the Web and provide
the URL instead of the full text.  The mailing list software will always
block posts with large attachments, and you'll end up receiving a
rejection note like this one."  However, here's the message with Don's
huge inclusion severely truncated:

<p class="editorial">
[[[  I clipped this out, as Don had already sent in his own truncated
version (as Rick notes below). -- Kat  ]]]

Which modification and re-send I now see that Don had <em>also</em> done.
</p>

<p>
Don, FYI, you sent the 83 kilobyte variant of that message <em>three</em> times
to the list, and presumably were notified each time that it was too
large and therefore held for moderation.  
</p>

<p>
That notification would have included a URL where you could have
cancelled the held message.  In the future, please consider using that
facility, especially (e.g.) at the time when you sent the fourth, much
shorter copy.  Be kind to your listadmins, and it'll improve their
dispositions.
