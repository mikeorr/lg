viable business model that will avoid fragmenting Linux.  Real-time support is
an important option for embedded developers who are choosing Linux as their
operating system."</I></P>

</H3> 

<P> Hauppague, New York, NY - February 8, 2000 - BASCOM Global Internet
Services, Inc. (BASCOM), pioneering developers of Linux-based thin server
productivity solutions for small business, today announces an initiative in
keeping with the collaborative spirit of the Open Source movement.
BASCOM's Open Source Equipment Exchange 
<A HREF="http://osee.bascom.org">(osee.bascom.org)</A> is designed to
match those donating computer equipment with those in the Open Source
community needing to add infrastructure to further their development
efforts and spur innovation toward the continued evolution of the Linux
operating system.    

<P> The OSEE web site will link those donating equipment with those in the Open
Source community in need of hardware resources.  Since the Linux OS requires
relatively modest "horsepower" to drive it, older class computers that have
outlived their use in corporate environments will be given renewed life in the
hands of Open Source developers.

</FONT>
</H3> 

This note is going out to all customers of GetTux.com, and their 'SubX
Series' subscribers.

<P> Unfortunately, due to a lack of funding, GetTux.com is ceasing business.
This is a most unpleasant situation, and we are not thrilled to have to send
out this notice, but, without major funding, we are unable to advertise,
unable to increase staff, and are thus unable to advance as a company. We
had meetings with several large investors, but, unfortunately, no one was
able to invest in us, while at the same time leaving us control of the
company and its direction. What a sad thing the business world can be.

<P> As several of you know, the company was run, on a day to day basis, by me,
Scott McDaniel. Website, promotions, product, research and all. We really
needed a few other people, and, without that funding, we couldn't continue.

<P> We certainly felt that we offered a unique and useful product, but, again,
without the funding we hoped to receive, we were forced to discontinue
service. Hopefully, the Linux community will strive (of course it will!),
and someone may indeed resurrect the idea of a monthly subscription service.
I know that several of you are in Linux related businesses, some of you in
the print media, and others are part of Linux related websites.

<P> GetTux.com was formed in the hope that we could advance the use of Linux ,
and that the ease of use would be promoted by allowing users updates to
documentation and applications. We are fans of Linux. We are users of Linux.
We are part of the commmunity. And we are sorry we are unable to continue to
serve you in this capacity.

<P> In the event that anyone in the community would like to use the GetTux.com
domain, or would like the product we were selling, business plan and all,
please contact me personally, 
<A HREF="mailto:scott@mcdev.com">scott@mcdev.com</A>.

<P> Anyway, back to the sad business: Current subscribers will be given a FULL
refund. Consider the first month of your subscription a gift from other
Linux aficionados.  If you have a refund related question, please email
<A HREF="mailto:refunds@gettux.com">refunds@gettux.com</A>.

<P> Again, my apologies for any inconvenience, and, again, I wish to thank each
and every customer that allowed us to serve them.

For instance, your refrigerator may notice that milk is running low and,
being a termenal, asks the server to put "Milk" on the shopping list.  Now
you get the shopping list off of your PDA, which is also a termenal, and see
that you should get milk.  It could even be extended so that the server will
watch how much milk, or any other product, your family drinks and will
adjust the ammount you should get based on that.

firewall appliances.  The partnership with Cobalt allows Progressive to
deliver security solutions designed to meet a range of customer needs
and opens Cobalt's customer base to Progressive.  The Phoenix firewall
on the Qube 2 joins the existing Phoenix firewall on the Cobalt RaQ 2, a
Linux-based firewall appliance that allows service providers and
resellers to deliver security products and managed services to
small-to-medium-sized businesses, branch offices, schools, and
government institutions. The addition of the Phoenix on the Qube gives
customers an easy-to-use, high functionality premise-based solution that
satisfies the needs of individual businesses and institutions. 
Progressive and Cobalt enjoy synergies in their product and sales
organizations, allowing the companies to leverage their respective
channel and product strategies. 

<P> The Phoenix Qube will retail for $2,495 with unlimited users.

</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> Silicon Automation Systems Limited today extended its Synapse range of
xDSL products by introducing a G.lite solution for Linux.  This is the
world's first Linux based internal G.lite modem offering the end-user
enhanced data rates over the existing copper lines.

<P> Mr. Deepak Gupta, Vice President.,
SAS, says,  "External ADSL modem solutions available in the market today are
expensive and bulky.  They are not suitable for the Internet appliance
market where cost and size are critical.  Synapse  G.lite for Linux is an
extremely attractive solution for OEMs looking for providing ADSL access
to their Linux based appliances. Providing G.lite under Linux is a
pioneering step towards mass deployment of ADSL and in firmly establishing
it as the technology of choice in the Internet access market," he added.

<P> The Synpase G.lite for Linux modem provides data transfer rates of 1.5 Mb
/ s downstream and 512 Kb / s  upstream  while allowing simultaneous
access for analog voice telephony. It is fully compliant with the ITU-T
G.992.2 standard and has been interoperated with most major DSLAM vendors.
Moreover, the performance of the system exceeds those mandated by
standards.

</FONT>
</H3> 


<P> Denver - XI Graphics Inc. 
has announced a new web-based product line of graphics hardware drivers for
Linux.  In making the announcement, Xi Graphics' National Sales Manager, Lee
Roder, said the company would continue to offer its existing Accelerated-X
Display Server line of products for Linux and Unix operating systems.

<P> "Desktop Linux is coming fast, and we're going to be there," said 
Roder. "We produce higher quality drivers more efficiently than anyone 
else in the business. Linux gamers and developers alike can easily 
download, demo and purchase our drivers from the Web site at 
affordable pricess -- it's good for us and it's good for Linux."

<P> The 3D Linux drivers are OpenGL 1.1.1-compliant, support libGLU 
and libGL, and are available for download from Xi Graphics' web site 
(<A HREF="http://www.xig.com">www.xig.com</A>) starting at $29 each. A limited
number of drivers are currently available, but more are being added weekly. 

<P> Roder said each driver is priced according to a numbe of factors 
such as hardware capabilities of the card, the degree of difficulty 
developing and testing the driver and the likely volume of sales 
of the driver. 

<P> "Our new line of graphics support for Linux in desktop installations 
is a result of requests from our customers," said Roder. "It gives them 
the ability to very quickly get superb graphics support for their 
specific hardware at a price that is quite economical."

<P> The new 3D Linux driver products are sold only over the Web and are 
available as freely downloadable, limited-run-time demos. The demos 
can be run on the customers' hardware to confirm compatibility and 
performance before purchasing. Customers use a registration system 
to purchase a key through Xi Graphics' web site. The key is e-mailed 
back to the customer, unlocks the demo product and converts it into 
standard product.
