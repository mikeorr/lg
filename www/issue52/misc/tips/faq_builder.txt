§ What is FAQ Builder?
§§Intro
FAQ Builder is a simple Perl script <b>faq_builder.pl</b> which transforms ASCII input into nicely formatted FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) layout. 
§§Layout
You'll first get a collection of title lines which usually are the questions. 
These title lines are numbered automagically and are linked to the main section of the FAQ. The main section holds the title lines (questions) and below each
title line the content (answer). 

§§ Features
<ul>
<li> Simply input, high quality output.
<li> Faq_builder can create as many indentation levels as needed.
<li> You can include HTML code into the ASCII text, like lists, line breaks, fonts.
<li> When regrouping questions, blocks are renumbered automagically.
<li> Changing indendatation levels is as easy as adding/removing a line of text. 
<li> You can add comments into your text which will not shine up later. Comments are lines beginning with '#'.
</ul>
