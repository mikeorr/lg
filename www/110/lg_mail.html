<P><STRONG>
ASUS P5A-B motherboard with AMD-K6-2 300MHz cpu.  Other people report
assorted linux boot problems with this board and other ASUS boards.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I can boot my version of linux (Basixlinux 2, based on <A HREF="http://www.slackware.org/">Slackware</A> 7.1, or
Basiclinux 3 with the SW71 kernel but libc5) from a 2-floppy lilo-boot
version that uses RAMdisk, a loadlin-boot RAMdisk version, a loop version,
or SW4.0 zipslack (UMSDOS).  But if I try to boot BL2 or BL3 with loadlin
from a hard drive installation, with the kernels compiled for them or with
bare.i Slackware kernel, the boot process stops at the lines:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>Linux NET4.0 for Linux 2.2
Based upon Swansea...
Net4:  Unix domain sockets 1.0 for Linux NET4.0
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
(The Basiclinux kernel gets me two lines further along to something about
TCP).
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tried starting with FreeDOS, DR-DOS, and Win98 DOS (since I have three
other computers that will boot linux with loadlin from Win9X DOS but not
always from the others, and one that will boot loop linux from any DOS
except Win9X).  I do not have a hard drive version set up to boot with
lilo.  Is that likelier to work?  I don't want to use lilo as I work in
DOS more of the time.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I tried telling CMOS that there was no second drive because someone
suggested that method to get linux to recognize a larger drive, but my
drive is 3GB.  I have DOS on a master drive and two linux partitions on
the slave drive, with one linux in each, and RAMdisk and loop versions in
DOS partitions.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am able to mount the linux partitions when running from the RAMdisk or
loop versions and then switch to run linux on them:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>mount /dev/hdb1 /mnt
chroot /mnt
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
This puts hdb1 on <TT>/</TT> and I can then use linux on the ext2 partition.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
But this is essentially what most initrd-based start up procedures do
anyway! So, though I haven't used BasixLinux, I would guess that the
problem is with the start scripts on your ext2 partition in <TT>/etc/rcS.d</TT>
or some such.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
This is a minor nuisance and I suppose I could put it in an rc file, or
just use the smaller version unless I needed the larger one.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am writing out of curiosity - why are so many computers difficult to
boot with linux?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
The glass could also be half full! Given the variety of hardware that
Linux runs on it is surprising that so many computers boot with it at
all. 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Is there a better fix for this one?  Is there a better
fix for the other three besides installing Win98 DOS on them (and having
to use a boot floppy to defragment the DOS partitions after that) or
rebooting with a Win98 boot disk to go from DOS to linux?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I also have one Northgate 386 SX 20MHz 4.7MB RAM laptop which has no
cursor in linux. Cirrus video, 256K video RAM, mono VGA.  The cursor is
plain white when used in color VGA.  The computer in theory can output to
a color monitor in 800x600 resolution.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
Is this with or without X? The question is not clear enough. Are you in
graphics mode or text mode?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Does laptop video treat software cursors oddly?  A cursor appears when I
use a text editor.  There is a cursor while booting to DOS and in DOS.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Another 386 with identical speed, RAM and video won't boot linux at all -
the screen goes black and I need to reboot.  What might cause this
problem?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
Try booting with the additional option "vesafb=off". Some of the older
hardware may not respond well to being switched to graphic mode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Thanks for your help a couple of years ago getting my first linux set up
<BR>to work with both TTL and VGA monitors.

<P>
I got an interesting call from a friend of mine, a PyCon regular who, as
it turns out, lives in Sweden.  There's been a discussion on the PyCon
list about whether the $175 conference fee is too high, too low, or
just right.  That got her asking me what would it take to get more
Americans to present a talk at EuroPython (in Sweden next July --
<A HREF="http://www.europython.org"
	>http://www.europython.org</A>) and Python UK
(in England next April -- <A HREF="http://www.accu.org/conference"
	>http://www.accu.org/conference</A>), and more
Europeans to PyCon (in Washington DC next April -- <A HREF="http://pycon.org"
	>http://pycon.org</A>).
I thought I'd throw the question out to y'all for ideas.  Not everyone
here is interested in Python, but the same thing applies to Linux and
other free software projects.
</P>
<P>
She said that she could guess why why not many American presenters would
go to Europe, but she wanted to ask somebody on this side of the pond in
case there were factors she wasn't aware of.  I said the main problem
for Americans (besides the expense) is that most people only get two
weeks' vacation per year, so they have to use the time selectively.  She
asked why that was, since in Sweden the minimum is six weeks and most
people get nine.  I said I don't know, it's just a longstanding
tradition.  She asked why people don't demand more.  I said people are
much more concerned about health care, and more vacation time is lower
in their priorities.
</P>
<P>
She said that for her, the main problem with coming to American
conferences is the expense.  That seems to be outside our control since
the conference fee is minimal already, and we can't do anything about
airfares or accommodation fees.  'Course the falling dollar will help.

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
As far as I can tell, the most important thing is just to keep these
conferences going, so that even if people can't attend next year, maybe
they can do the year after, or maybe some overseas people will go to one
and others to the next.
</P>
<P>
Another thing that's happening in the Python world is different kinds of
events are emerging.  These three are traditional conferences with
speakers.  In Seattle we've had a couple sprints (=weekend hacking
sessions) without speakers, and I gather those are happening in Europe
too.  So maybe the answer is not just more opportunities for speakers,
but more types of events.
</P>
<P>
Any other ideas?
</P>

As you noticed, the use of a wildcard in a command like mount
really blew me away.  The remark you added to my article compounded
it.  find, great.  less, OK...  mount?!
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
[grin] Yeah, pretty amazing. It gets much <EM>more</EM> amazing when you
install and enable "bash_completion"; all the... well, <EM>stuff</EM> that has
multiple options becomes available at the prompt. E.g., typing "ssh "
(note the space) and hitting 'Tab' twice shows me a list of all the
hosts in my ~/.ssh/known_hosts; typing "mount " and hitting 'Tab' three
times (since all the entries start with '<TT>/</TT>', which is displayed
immediately) gives me a list of all the directories listed in
"<TT>/etc/fstab</TT>"... obviously, completion happens when you have a unique
string: I've been doing "ssh li&lt;Tab&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;" for a session at
linuxgazette.net for so long that I'd be lost without it.

If you count the couple of years I had used Coherent prior to
graduating to <A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A> Linux, I've probably been at *nix for 10 years
or so.  In other words off the steep part of the learning curve,
but, boy, is there ever enough curve left!
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
That's the lovely thing about Unix, to me. You keep gaining these chunks
of power every time you learn something - and the chunks don't get any
smaller with time. It can be a little tough on the ego for the folks who
think that way... but to me, it's a fantastic opportunity to squeeze any
amount of juice that I may need out of a system. It's not a question of
"is it possible" any longer, but "where do I find the HOWTO?" instead.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Anyhoo, I would like to encourage you to do an article on obscure
uses of wildcards on the command line.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Um. Well... the problem is in defining "obscure". To me, they're not;
they're just how shells operate. To someone else, they may well be
obscure. Say... maybe looking at it in broader terms would be useful -
an article, or even a series on CLI usage in general might be pretty
good!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm sorta swamped for the moment - and actually "owe" about three
articles to myself 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> - but that one sounds like a really good idea.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Like ignoring the consequences of SuSE's apparent elimination of
the need for mount -- there are still questions in my mind but, then,
I bounce back and forth between root and any of several users a
lot and may have messed things up -- what would "mount *" do?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
It would give you an error.

Try
to mount every <TT>/dev?</TT>  Cycle through <TT>/etc/fstab?</TT>  root can mount
stuff not in <TT>/etc/fstab.</TT>  Permissions.  Users.  Mind-boggling.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Essentially, you've answered your own question: "mount *" would just be
too ambiguous. E.g., "ssh " or "ssh ben@" is not at all ambiguous: the
host name is what has to come after either one of them, and it makes
sense that hitting the completion key (Tab) would "complete" them or
show the possible options. I assume you know that 'Tab' works to
complete program names at the CLI, right? Filenames, too -
"vi ~/.bash_p&lt;Tab&gt;" pulls up my "~/.bash_profile" every time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Keep up the good work
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ben] 
Thanks, Edgar! Heck, you might want to write the article yourself: read
the Bash man page, and take a look at the "<TT>/etc/bash_completion</TT>" script.
That should give you a <EM>good</EM> start.

<BR>Question by Mark W. Tomlinson 

<P><STRONG>
I had just settled in of a Saturday evening with a wee dram of Irish
whiskey, a good Henry Clay cigar and Linux Gazette #109.  I had worked
my way to "Return of the Linux Laundrette" and reached the section "Re:
[LG 87] help wanted #4".  This piece caused me to drop my cigar (due to
uncontrollable grinning, giggling and guffawing), setting my sweatpants
on fire.

I'm fine, thanks - I extinguished the blaze by spilling my libation in

I don't know how you people manage to produce such an outstanding

<BR>Question by Rich Price (PRICER from us.panasonic.com)

<P>
Hi Rich, all,
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Advanced Features of netfilter/iptables by Barry O'Donovan [November
2004 (#10
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT="8)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">] was a very informative article.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks! It's always good to hear positive feedback.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
But my "math flag" flew
from my pocket when I saw his example for using the random module.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
So did mine on reading the published article. I had actually planned to
point it out with an Octave example demonstrating the difference
between the right and wrong answer in this months article, but when it
came to writing it I discarded the example as it didn't fit with my
layout and completely forgot to add it as erratum.
</P>
<P>
If there is one thing I have learnt about statistics (and I've learnt
quite a lot between my degree which was top heavy on stats and my
research where I use the damn stuff every day) is that if the answer is
simple, then it's just plain wrong!
</P>
<P><STRONG>
If you wish to divide the packets evenly among the four servers then
the example should look like this:
</STRONG></P>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>

<pre><strong>-A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m random --average 25 \ -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.5:80
-A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m random --average 33 \ -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.6:80
-A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -m random --average 50 \ -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.7:80
-A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -m state --state NEW -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.0.8:80
</strong></pre>
<p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE><P><STRONG>
The reason is that, after 25% of the packets are NATed by the first
rule, only 75% of them will be seen by the second rule.  A third of
them would equal 25% of the total.  Likewise, the third rule will see
only half of the total and half of that is 25% of the total.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Correct. A subtle and simple mistake that might cause many a sys-admin a
prolonged headache!
</P>
<P>
When speaking of mistakes and statistics, I'm always reminded of a few
quotes:
<p>
<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<P>
"There are two kinds of statistics: the kind you look up and the kind
you make up."
</P>

<P>
"I gather, young man, that you wish to be a Member of Parliament. The
first lesson that you must learn is, when I call for statistics about
the rate of infant mortality, what I want is proof that fewer babies
died when I was Prime Minister than when anyone else was Prime
Minister. That is a political statistic."
</P>

<P>
"You know how dumb the average guy is? Well, by definition, half of them
are even dumber than that."
</P>
<P>
"Statistics in the hands of an engineer are like a lamppost to a
drunk-they're used more for support than illumination."
</P>
<P>
"Numbers are like people; torture them enough and they'll tell you
anything."
</P>
<P>
"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics."
</P>
<P>
"A statistician is a man who comes to the rescue of figures that cannot
lie for themselves."
</P>
<P>
"First get your facts; then you can distort them at your leisure."
</P><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Ahhhh.... statistics. So easy to love and hate all at once!
</P>
<P>
Cheers,
Barry
</P>
<P>
P.S. Thanks also to John Macdonald and one of our French translators,
Emmanuel Araman, who also pointed this out to me.

I sent the message out last night; so far, the first five people have
responded. My best hopes and wishes go out to the rest, and to all.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Breen] 
Thanks for that, Ben. Please let us know as you hear from more of
our Indian friends.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I surely will, Breen. So far, we've got Vinayak's name to the five who
had responded previously; Sayamindu Dasgupta's address bounced, but I
found a phone number for him at <A HREF="http://peacefulaction.org"
	>http://peacefulaction.org</A> which he
listed in his author profile. He's OK; seems he's in Kolkata (West
Bengal), and everything is all right there.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Folks, please keep them on your good wishes list or in your prayers, as
appropriate. It may be a small thing in the face of something this huge,
but... it's something. As Pramode said, "there are still human beings
alive who can feel the sorrow in another person's eyes - that's the only
consolation."
</STRONG></P>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;"></p>
<P><STRONG>
[Ben] Are you all OK? I'd appreciate a response if you get a chance. I'd
imagine that many others here are just as concerned; I think that a lot
of people may just be... too stunned by the magnitude of this to come up
with a coherent response, and unsure of their own degree of connection
to you all. Me, I figure that we're all human beings - and that no man
is an island.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My heart goes out to you and all your countrymen in this difficult,
terrible time.

Thanks for checking. Yes. It is truly a devastating event here. Relief
agencies are doing what they can but every bit counts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
I'm going to be letting people around here (northern Florida) know that
they can contribute to the Red Cross/Crescent India, and am going to
send a contribution myself. [sigh] Sunil mentioned that there's now
<EM>another</EM> warning out.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
The strange aspect of the tragedy is that people in Chennai who were more
than about 500 metres from the coast were almost unaware that anything
had happened. Since we live somewhat inland we were quite unaffected.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
[Nod] Tsunamis are like that. They're slow and quiet, definitely so at
first; the traditional way to commit suicide during one is to follow the
ocean as it recedes from the shore.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Folks - everyone - imprint this in your brain forever: if you ever see
the ocean receding, <EM>RUN</EM> like hell for the high ground. You at least
stand a chance of surviving, then.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
P.S. There is no word for "tsunami" in any of the local languages which
perhaps gives an idea of how unexpected the event was.

With great pleasure! I just went through our list of authors, and

I live far away from the coast (in Bangalore). We did mobilise help and
have donated a lot of clothes/medicines for relief work. Though we
are safe in center of the Indian peninsula, we were shocked by the images
that were shown on television and splashed on the front pages of the
newspapers. I also read that 5 endangered tribes living in the
Andaman and Nicobar islands were wiped out forever and a few islands
were washed away (literally).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
[sigh] Damn. The only thing I'd ever heard about Andaman islanders was
the fanciful stuff from Conan Doyle... and now, they're gone. Forever.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Contention from various quarters notwithstanding, this world is <EM>not</EM>
particularly friendly to man. I realize that it does no good to rail
against the weather, but... blood and hell, man! This is just appalling.
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Vinayak Hegde] 
Yeah. It's good to know that I am not the only Sherlock Holmes Fan on this List
The Andamani Pymgy had a major role to play in "The Sign of Four".
Who could forget the thrilling story??

Oh, indeed. And what a picture he draws! Reminded me quite a lot of Jack

of the Salomon islanders.

Any news about the latest warning that Sunil mentioned?

[Raj Shekar] 
Thanks a lot for writing.  I am in Delhi, which was quite far from
where the tsunami stuck.  I will be making a donation to the Prime
minister's fund and also write in to the local LUG to see if we can
do more than just sitting.  One of the members of the mailing list is
working with the people who have been hit and has written down the
things they need:

<li> Children's clothes in decent form
<li> Medicines - Paracetamol, ORS packets, Doxycycline, Dettol, bandages
<li> Blankets - a few thousands
<li> Gloves &amp; masks to help volunteers clear the debris &amp; dead bodies.
<li> Money - to buy essentials, water pots (which will be bought closer
to the areas)

I hope I will be able to find some (honest) agency who will be
willing to take donations of medicine and blankets.

I am absolutely fine. By god's grace I am not near the vicinity of the
Tsunami. But hearing about the disaster itself gives enough sight of
what would have happened.

I am fine. I had come home (Kerala in southern India) for a 10-day
holiday. But as my native place is far from coastal area,
I was not affected.

I can also vouch for Pramode. C . E , that he is safe,
as I had met him in person day-before-yesterday.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ben, I really appreciate the concern and the kindness you extend to
all of us. Thank you very much.

It is during the dark times like this that we understand how
precious our lives are; which we usually take for granted. Lets
all extend our help in whatever way we can, to the victims of
this tragedy.

Rajith is OK; by extension, Maxin B. John (whom I missed due to the
