<h1>Secure Knoppix on CD-ROM for Disaster Recovery</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/howell.html">Edgar Howell</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<!-- 20050505 dsrich - Added hyperlinks to relevants sites and
section headers as necessary - no hrefs in text originally. -->

<p>A friend recently sent me a CD with a version of <a href=
"http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html">Knoppix</a> designed
to enable surfing the Internet without risk. For its intended
purpose alone worth looking at, to me the real mind-blower is its
use to recover from disaster.</p>

<p>As chance would have it, I had barely started to play around
with it a bit when our nephew called: Blue Screen of Death. No
back-up. Cool. Yeah, OK, come on over tomorrow afternoon and I'll
see what I can do. Windows?! Well...</p>

<p>This thing was put together by people who really know what they
are doing. Their use of symbolic links was sheer genius. Well, OK,
if you insist, pretty straight-forward &mdash; that's what they're
there for.</p>

<h2>What is Knoppix?</h2>

<p>Knoppix is a self-contained mini-version of Linux on CD-ROM. I
had heard of it, of course, but never had the time to investigate
it. Big mistake. It is well worth being familiar with.</p>

<p>This particular version is intended basically to turn your PC
into something like a diskless workstation. You boot from the
CD-ROM and it sets up an environment analogous to a chroot-jail
without access to any hard drive. In this environment you can surf
with Firefox. Even save settings &mdash; to diskette or USB. And
when you are all done, whatever you haven't yourself explicitly
saved somewhere is history.</p>

<p>No virus. No trojan. No spyware. No cookies. Nada. Niente. Rien.
Nichevo.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that this was introduced to me by a friend
who had no prior experience with GNU/Linux because the software he
requires professionally is only available under Windows. But he is
using it now for Internet access. Pretty easy to understand. I like
Firefox, too.</p>

<h2>Putting it to work</h2>

<p>OK, so I admit, I haven't gone surfing with it just yet. But is
it ever a powerful recovery tool! I like <a href=
"http://www.toms.net/rb/">Tom's Boot Disk</a>, which is on the
<a href="http://www.ultimatebootcd.com">Ultimate Boot CD</a> along
with quite a few other useful tools. But you have to experience
what this thing can do.</p>

<p>Perhaps it should be pointed out that this is based on Debian
and the kernel is a bit old, 2.4.29.
<!-- 20050505 dsrich - What version of Knoppix is he talking about - According
to the changelog, they were running 2.4.27 through the 3.6 and 3.7 releases,
then dropped 2.4.x completely in 3.8.1, which is the latest - his version must
have been heavily hacked. Other points made in text indicate this also. -->
But so what? There aren't too many exploits possible if there is
nowhere to store anything. And nothing unusual to look at.</p>

<p>Once you boot, you are given a gui &mdash; user, not root &mdash;
under X11 and options to do things needed to surf. That's it. No
hard drive. Everything you need to access the Internet and not a
single thing more.</p>

<p>However &mdash; this is Linux after all &mdash; there are the
other virtual terminals. All already logged in as root.</p>

<p>Very quickly I was able to put together a simple script with
which to establish a network connection. And mounting a drive or
partition is no biggey &mdash; Knoppix has /etc/fstab all set up
for us, mount-points for every single formatted partition.</p>

<p>During the time I needed to use it, the only things I really
missed were Midnight Commander and netcat. Apparently netcat is
entirely self-contained because there was no no trouble running it
copied from a floppy, copied there from SuSE 8.0. On the fly (and
without SSH) over the network "cp -R" along with netcat had to
substitute for "mc".</p>

<p>Knoppix seems to deal fairly well with "mature" hardware. While
X11 baled out on the Pentium 166 with 32 MB, I didn't want to surf
on it anyway. And several command-line interfaces as root anywhere
is nirvana!</p>

<p>I ought to mention that I was unable to boot the 5-year-old
Toshiba notebook (AMD K-5) from the CD. There are numerous options
one can enter at boot but none of them helped. My guess is that
there is something wrong with a file needed only for the notebook
&mdash; repeated read errors on one specific block. Proprietary
that they are, notebooks are notoriously difficult to configure and
deal with anyhow, so no real surprise and not particularly
important to me.</p>

<h2>Tinkering Under the Hood</h2>

<p>Ignoring its original intent, this is a wonderful tool for
disaster recovery with both network and mountable devices on which
to rescue data. You likely will still want whatever tools you have
collected over time to diagnose things like hardware problems. And
we're root, so we still do need to be extremely careful about what
we do. I had no trouble using fdisk to re-format our nephew's
second hard drive and allocate partitions.</p>

<p>The way the people who put this together went about it was very
impressive. Instead of hard-wiring everything in, they made
skillful use of soft-links. Once I noticed that /etc/hosts etc.
were soft-links, it didn't take long to do a script on a floppy to
copy what I really wanted from it to /tmp, remove the links and
replace them with references to the files in /tmp.</p>

<p>All that was necessary to set up networking was to copy
/etc/hosts, /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny from one machine
to diskette and then shut it down while our nephew was here and his
machine was attached to the network. No long-term approach, but
effective in haste.</p>

<!-- 20050505 dsrich - Added the hrefs below, then found both were out of
date, so commented out the entire two paragraphs. -->
<!-- <p>If you have an appropriate Internet connection, you can download
this from
<a href="http://www.com-magazin.de/addendum/COM_KNOPPIX_042005-RC6.iso">
http://www.com-magazin.de/addendum/COM_KNOPPIX_042005-RC6.iso</a></p>

<p>You might want to go to <a href="http://www.com-magazin.de">
http://www.com-magazin.de</a>, there click on
"weiter zu www.com-magazin.de" and then under SERVICE on the left
click on the last item, "Erg&auml;nzungen". This should take you to
a page that shows this address and below it provides some other
information as well &mdash; all in German, but I think the
important stuff should be understandable even if you don't deal
well with German (last checked out on 2005-04-16). Like the MD5
checksum could be of interest. The image is 300 MB and there is an
estimate of 12 hours for my 56K modem. No, I didn't even consider
it.</p>
-->

<p>I looked at the contents of /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, and /usr/sbin
and it would seem that this is a fairly complete Linux
distribution: a couple of shells, lilo, miscellaneous mkfs*, awk,
sed, ipchains, iptables and so forth. Almost nothing in the way of
daemons, window managers or bells-and-whistles, as if anyone should
care in the intended environment. Since this CD isn't even half
full, you might want to check for your favorite programs before
producing your own.</p>

<p>The version I was given was in German but included texts for
English prompts at boot. It looks like it ought to be pretty
straight-forward to rename two files in order to change to English
before burning a CD. And they might serve as patterns for other
languages. Pure speculation.</p>

<p class="editorial">[The ISO image for Knoppix version
3.8.1-2005-04-08 (the latest as of 05 May 2005) is almost 690 MB -
not much space for additions! See the <a href=
"http://www.knopper.net/knoppix-mirrors/index-en.html">mirrors
page</a> to download the latest version in several languages.
&mdash; dsrich]</p>

<p>So our nephew brought his PC over and we connected it to the
LAN. Between that and a USB-stick we were able to recover about 90
percent of the stuff he hadn't backed up properly from a drive that
seems to have developed a heat-allergy leading to read errors
&mdash; this drive also had operating system. When all was said and
done, he was pretty impressed with what I was able to do.</p>

<p>But was I ever impressed with Knoppix!</p>

<h2>Postscript</h2>
<!-- 20050505 dsrich - Deleted descriptions, so no need for this disclaimer -->
<!--
<p>The software described above is available at an Internet site
maintained by a commercial publication in Germany that I am not
personally familiar with. I assume that, having made it available
on the Internet, they have no objections to downloads. But there is
no way of knowing just how long it will remain accessible. First
come, first served, as it were.</p>
-->

<p>If you decide to use this software for Internet access, do be
aware of the significance of those root sessions &mdash; without
password! The only services available are printer and monitor.
/etc/hosts and friends are tightly locked down. But it was
extremely easy for me to open up network access.</p>

<p>So if some SOB somehow can get some sort of attachment past you
and executed... Certainly an unlikely eventuality given the target
&mdash; not the universe of PCs, not even GNU/Linux, just a variety
of a specialized version of Linux. But maybe root should have a
password before you burn your own copy.</p>

uses is
