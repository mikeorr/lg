<hr>

<p>"Is there so much to administer on CUPS that it requires a 225-page
book?" That was the very first question that crossed my mind when I
decided to review this book. After reading it, and in reading this
review, you may notice, as I did, that there's more than enough
material.</p>

<p>The book starts with a quick overview of CUPS features, and some 
of the history of Linux printing.  Then, chapter 2 shows you how to do 
simple CUPS installation and basic printer configuration. </p>

<p>Chapter 3 guides you through all basic steps of managing your 
printers, including adding and removing printers and managing print jobs 
via the command line. Then, it shows you how to use the Web interface to
do the same management tasks - in other words, basic CUPS administration.</p>

<p>Starting with Chapter 4, this book starts to shine: it details several
advanced CUPS features - and I really mean "details"!  In
Chapter 4, "Managing Multiple Printers at a Time": the book explains how
such management gets done, what the printer classes are, the advantages and
disadvantages of using them, how to create configurations, how to configure
using both the command-line and Web interfaces, when to use and when not to
use various features, and so on.</p>

<p> Other topics covered include management of the CUPS server, details of
the CUPS configuration files, client setup including Windows clients over
Samba, quotas, server monitoring, per-user print filtering, security, and
much more.</p>

<p>The book explains those extra features with a level of detail that
really impressed me: yes, there really is enough good material on CUPS
administration to fill a 225-page book, with no room left over for
padding.</p>

<p>Concluding the review, the book offers a lot of information. More than
just information, it gives you the knowledge of someone who seems to have
been administrating CUPS for quite some time. Really valuable.</p>
