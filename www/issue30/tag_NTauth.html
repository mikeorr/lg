 Hi James!

<br><br>
 Again a problem to me, and a exercise to you.

<br><br>
 Is it possible to make the Linux Box do login authentication
 requests from a NT Domain Server?

	>Not yet.  The <a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/">Samba team</a>
	is working on this and hopes to have something ready within a couple of
	months.  Lest you think this is all wasted effort
	(on the thought that Microsoft will ship NT 5.x
	in a year or so) --- the indications seem to be that
	the MS NT implementation of Kerberos will still rely
	heavily on the data structures that they currently use
	in their PDC/BDC protocol.  So, the work being done
	now is an investment to the future as well as a hope
	for the near-present.

	>I have a Linux box in a TCP/IP network, part of a large NT Domain,
 and want to allow NT domain-users to log in the Linux Box and access
 Internet in it.  The idea is provide access to the Linux Box without
 having to register every user. The users don´t need a regular
 account, with home directory, because Internet access is not
 frequent (thanks to a low connection) and they only use it to
 surfing (not email, not FTP).

	>Hmm.  It looks like I read too much into your first
	paragraph.  This sounds like you want Linux to be a
	client to an NT domain controller.  I think there is
	a PAM (pluggable authentication module) for doing this.

<br><br>
	Since the whole PAM project is still in beta (and not
	moving nearly fast enough for my tastes --- not that I've
	contributed to it nor that the programmers would want me
	to) I can't make any promises on how well it will work.

<br><br>
	However the state of PAM can speak for itself at:

<blockquote><code><A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/"
		>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/</A>
</code></blockquote>

	(Andrew Morgan's pages on the Transmeta sponsored Linux site).

<br><br>
	The module you might want to play with is by David Airlie
	and is at:

<blockquote><code><A HREF="http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied/pam_smb/"
		>http://www.csn.ul.ie/~airlied/pam_smb/</A>
</code></blockquote>

	Other modules (for things like one-time passwords, authentication
	on a Netware server, a couple of different "SecureCard" and
	"DESGold" cards, RADIUS, and support Kerberos realms, etc) can
	be found by browsing around at:

<blockquote><code><A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/modules.html"
		>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/modules.html</A>
</code></blockquote>

	>No, I don't want to make the Linux Box act as a firewall (I don't
 have authorization to do that). And, again, sorry my bad english...

	>Given the muddy murky nature of the term "firewall" the
	difference between what you're doing and "acting as a firewall"
	may be purely a matter of semantics.  However, if it'll keep
	your management happy I'll go into a Brazilian court of law
	as an "expert witness" to state my opinion that this is <EM>not</EM>
	a "firewall."

<br><br>
	If by "surfing" you mean that your users will only be
	using the Linux system as a web proxy --- why are you
	fussing with authenticating them at all?  Why not just
	install Apache and configure it purely for caching/proxy
	use --- or use Squid (there are RPM's avaiable --- they
	were included with my copies of
	<A HREF="http://www.suse.de/">S.u.S.E.</A>

<br><br>
	<a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, CERN, and Squid can
	all be configured as caching
	web proxy/servers and can all be configured with a variety
	of limitations on which systems are allowed through in which
	directions.  Do you really care <EM>which</EM> user is logged into
	the workstation that is using these proxies?  That seems like
	an odd requirement unless you're also trying to enforce
	some other policies (like certain classes of employees are
	only allowed to "surf" during their lunch hour, etc).

<br><br>
	I suggest you actually review your requirements a bit further.
	It sounds like you are complicating matters more than the
	situation requires.
