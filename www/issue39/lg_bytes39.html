Linux Without Borders
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Thu, 4 Mar 1999 08:48:20 -0500 (EST)<BR> 
Linux Without Borders is an
E-list dedicated to discussion and implementation of the
vision that in countries whose citizens are not yet rich enough
to own Personal Computers(PCs), computers must be *shared*; and
that the way to enable sharing while preserving individual
privacy is to install Linux, a multi-user, multi-tasking
operating system, on PCs owned cooperatively, or by businesses.
<P>
This will enable citizens to establish their own accounts on a
commonly owned, or rented, computer, where they can do all the
things that citizens of wealthier countries can do: write, do
accounts, and -- perhaps most important -- use "their" computer
to communicate with other people, in their own country and
throughout the world.

NetBeans Ships One of the First Cross-Platform IDEs to Support Java 2
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Prague, Czech Republic, March 2, 1999 - NetBeans today launched DeveloperX2
2.1, one of the first full-featured Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs) to support and run on Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s Java 2(tm) platform.
DeveloperX2 2.1 enables software developers to build sophisticated Java
Foundation Classes (JFC) GUIs, compile, and debug applications on the
platform of their choice.  NetBeans also simultaneously launched a concurrent
version, Developer 2.1, which supports Swing 1.1 and Java Development Kit(tm)
(JDK) 1.1.
<P>
NetBeans Developer combines support for all stages of application development
including visual design, coding, compiling, and debugging in a comprehensive
visual programming package.  It is available in two versions which run on all
platforms that support JDK 1.1 and 1.2, respectively, including Windows
95/98/NT, Linux, Solaris(tm), HP-UX, OS/2, AIX, SGI Irix, and others.  The IDE
is based on JFC and JavaBeans Components, and all parts of the IDE are
actually themselves JavaBeans.  The result is an IDE where the user can fully
customize the interface, modify component behavior and easily add new
components.
<P>
NetBeans Enterprise will allow teams of developers to build full-scale
distributed Java technology-based applications.  In addition to the features
of Developer, Enterprise will feature several additional modules: Version
control systems support (integration with multiple vendors); database
connectivity - JDBC; Enterprise JavaBeans support - EJB; distributed computing
support - RMI and CORBA; and directory services - JNDI.

Programming Web Graphics With Open Source Software
</font>
</H3> 
<P>
Date: Fri, 5 Mar 1999 10:13:39 -0800 (PST)
Sebastopol, CA--Many people assume that creating web graphics requires
graphics editors like Adobe Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro. But with Open
Source software like Perl and GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) you
have the power to dynamically generate graphics based on user input and
activity, easily manipulate graphics content, and optimize graphics for
compression and quality.
<P>
Programming Web Graphics with Perl & GNU  Software<BR> 
By Shawn P. Wallace<BR> 
1-56592-478-9, 470 pages, $29.95 (US$)<BR> 
<P> 
It's a little-documented field, and the valuable free libraries and
tools available on the Internet are little publicized.  From access
counters and log-report graphs to scientific plots and on-the-fly
animated GIFS, graphics scripting is within the grasp of most web
scripters. "Programming Web Graphics with Perl & GNU Software" was
written to provide a practical resource for intermediate and advanced
web programmers who want to use CGI Scripts to generate dynamic graphic
content.

Kudos to Trident
</font>
</H3> 
<P> 
Date: Fri, 26 Feb 1999 16:20:15 -0500<BR> 
I'm writing you to let you know of a recent hardware company's
exceptional support to the GNU/Linux community and the GPL.
<P>
The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture project (<A HREF="http://alsa.jcu.cz/">
http://alsa.jcu.cz/</A>) is
a project designed to build an architecture for pro-quality sound and
MIDI applications, from low-level drivers for sound and MIDI hardware
to high level libraries and sequencers.  The project is committed to
releasing all work under the GPL.
<P>
As you may know, many sound card manufacturers are reluctant to give
any technical help, and even some of those that offer help require
NDA's, which of course excludes the possibility of release source. We
have blacklisted some companies (http://alsa.jcu.cz/black.html) who
have either refused to release information or have decided to release
binary-only drivers, which ALSA will not use.
<P>
Trident (<A HREF="http://www.tridentmicro.com/">http://www.tridentmicro.com/</A>)
recently contacted the ALSA
developer mailing list, having written their own drivers for their 4D
Wave chipset for ALSA, and offering the source for the drivers. They
graciously allowed all of it to be put under the GPL, including
technical documents.
<P>
I am hoping to drum up support for their hardware in order for the
community to demonstrate how cooperation of this sort can aid
sales. Maybe this will convince more companies to follow.
<P>
Their chipset is used in the following products. If GNU/Linux users
are looking towards purchasing a sound card, perhaps they would
consider some of the following, since these cards are well-supported
under ALSA.
<pre>

esh -- A New UNIX Shell

<P>
esh is a new shell for Unix, written completely from scratch. It is very
small, both in
number of lines of source code and in memory consumption.
The whole shell is about 5000
lines of C source code, and occupies
about twice as little memory as bash in some cases. 
<P> 
However, esh is also extremely flexible, with a real programming
language at the core. The syntax is a simplified form of Scheme.
