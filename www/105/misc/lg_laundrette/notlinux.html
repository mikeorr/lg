<h2>Not Linux</h2>

<blockquote><em>
I think this is probably the longest off-topic thread we've had around here, 
and I've included it just for that reason, but I'd like to take this 
opportunity to thoroughly distance myself from that strange American 
political movement that's mentioned so many times here - it's a foreign
notion to those of us who live in countries that never had a Tea Party
and spend tax revenue on silly things like public health care instead of
the military ;-)

[Radio episode in RealAudio, MP3, and written transcript]</a>

<p> Iceland (pop. 250 000) is the first country in the world to convert to
hydrogen energy on a national scale.  Currently there are test buses
rolling.  Test cars will be next, but one of their major goals is 
fishing trawlers, which bring in 70% of Iceland's GNP but are powered
by expensive imported diesel.  An industry/government/academic coalition
has formed to make all of Iceland's electricity come from hydrogen, in
spite of the country's vast resources for hydroelectric and geothermal
power.  It's a sense of national pride to be on the cutting edge of 
science and to produce technologies that will later be useful in other
countries.  

<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Actually, while this is the "official" story, we _all_ know that someone
in America has been using this form of energy for ages.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
What?  I was talking about fuel cells, which have only existed for a few years.
Not about nuclear plants or dirigibles.

<blockquote>
<strong>[Alan Petrillo]</strong>
Hydrogen makes sense in Iceland, because they have so much geothermal 
energy with which to make it.

<p> Hydrogen does not, however, make sense for most of the rest of us.  At 
least not at the moment, and not for the forseeable future.  The reason 
for this is simple.  90+% of all commercial hydrogen is refined from 
fossil fuel.  This very effectively turns all of those "zero emissions" 
fuel cells into "emissions elsewhere" fuel cells.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Some emissions, but not as much.  Burning fuel for energy is pretty
inefficient, especially in a car.  What about the incompletely burned gas
in the exhaust?  What about the excess heat in the engine?  That's wasted
energy.  From what I've read, hydrogenization requires significantly less
fossil fuel for the same amount of net energy.  The result is less
emissions overall.  And if a few buildings direct the fuel-cell steam
"waste" into their heating systems or saunas, that's another ton of
fossil-fuel emissions eliminated.

<p> Also, 97% of electricity leaks away in the transmission lines.  If a
smaller refinery is placed closer to the consumer, that cuts down
emissions further.  Hydrogen converters can probably be placed closer
to the consumer less obtrusively than conventional power plants can.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Whoa! 97%? That seems highly doubtful to me.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I read it somewhere but I don't remember where.  But a large amount of
electricity does leak off the transmission lines.  People have ignored
it coz there doesn't seem to be any way around it.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Quick look around on the Web says ~10%. E.g., Vietnam's power gen people
are working (described in the typical slogan-laden communist manner) to
reduce their losses from 13.4% to 10% - of which they say only 8.2%
comes from "technical difficulties".

<p>
&lt;<a href="http://www.nhandan.org.vn/english/20030728/bai-social1.html#Global%20Environment%20Faciltiy">http://www.nhandan.org.vn/english/20030728/bai-social1.html#Global%20Environment%20Faciltiy</a>&gt;


<p>
<strong>[Alan]</strong>
The energy to make all of that hydrogen has to come from somewhere. 
Where, you ask?  For the forseeable future the ultimate energy source 
for the vast overwhelming majority of hydrogen production will be fossil 
fuel.  Which leaves us right back where we started.

<p> Repeat after me: "Hydrogen is a transmission medium, not an energy source."

<p> Say it again.  Say it again.  Say it again.

<p>
<strong>[Ramon van Alteren]</strong>
Not exactly.. You're absolutely right about the fact that most of the hydrogen 
will be produced with fossil fuel for the short term future. This does 
however NOT leave us right back where we started.

<p> The important change of switching to hydrogen based energy is that we no 
longer depend on fossil fuel. I can create/fill hydrogen based fuel cells by 
burning fossil fuels, but I can just as easily create/fill fuel cells using 
solar energy, wind energy, (tidal, gravity, etc.) water energy or whatever 
other sustainable energy source I can think of. 

<p> I cannot use any of those sustainable energy sources to run a petrol based 
car / motorcycle / powerplant. 

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I spent a few minutes yesterday explaining that very point to a friend
whom I'd referred to the original article. It's a way to shift the
distribution method around, not some particularly amazing "source".
However, in some scenarios - such as powering cars - it may well be a
winning strategy.

<p>~20 years back, UCLA had a car that they _wound up_ every night...
fairly large flywheel spun up to ${GODAWFUL_HIGH} RPM. It was actually
clever enough to recapture braking energy, too. However, I wouldn't want
to be around that thing if a bearing ever let go; flywheels are _not_
noted for exploding harmlessly upward with a blue flame.


<p> 
<strong>[Alan]</strong>
Keep in mind, I LIKE the idea of fuel cells, but running them on 
hydrogen is not the right answer.  For fuel cells to be truly practical 
they need to be able to run on a fuel that is _liquid_ at room 
temperature, and the temperatures at which people usually operate 
vehicles.  They also need to be less fussy about what they eat.  And 
they need to be able to eat it without running it through a reformer 
first.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
We need something that's somewhat better now, and we can worry about
perfect later.  Perl wasn't perfect, but it was better than the
shell/sed/awk monstrosities it replaced, which is why it took the world
by storm.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
"isn't perfect" <img alt=":-)" src="../../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" 
width="20" height="24">

<p> But good point, we're not going to get the "best" until we get the
"better". I like the idea of hybrid cars: Higher MPG, the cool
regenerative braking, and it's something that actually works with what
we have.

<p> 
<strong>[Alan]</strong>
Design a fuel cell that will run on a truly renewable fuel, like ethanol 
or vegetable oil, and if the oil industry doesn't assasinate you then 
the world will beat a path to your door.

<p> 
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
The "oil" industry is already hedging its bets, Bush/Cheney
obstructionism notwithstanding.  They know oil is a dying industry that
can be propped up by government favors for only so long.  Either the oil
will run out, air pollution will become intolerable, or al-Qaida will
talibanize the entire Middle East, but one way or another, eventually
the public will demand alternative energy, and the incumbent companies
don't want to be left behind when that happens.  The car manufacturers
are already pushing the envelope, designing hydrogen cars so they can
pass the environmental responsibility buck to the oil companies.  "We've
done our part.  Now do your part, or you'll look like the bad guy."

<p> So it will happen eventually, but we can't wait that long.  The problem
is acute now.  All the limitations are just limitations *now*, but with
creativity they can be solved or worked around.  What if we threw $30 
billion at the problem, how much faster would zero-emission, renewable
sources become cost-effective, not to mention efficiencies and uses
we haven't even thought of yet?  If we'd gone on a serious
alternative-energy policy in the 70s, it would have been done by now.  

<p> The reason I'm harping on this is coz it first takes a critical mass of
people to think out of the box and decide it's possible, then they have
to pressure the politicians and companies to make it happen, and only
then will it happen.

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Or it will happen when it's cheaper than oil, whichever comes first. My
first thought is kind of "just let it go, eventually the problem will
take care of itself". Because when oil runs out, people will have to
turn to other things.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Advertising people make millions of dollars by working that particular
belief for all it's worth. If the world really ran that way, every PC
(except for an imperceptible minority, for various reasons) would be
running Linux.

<p>Electric cars already _are_ cheaper,  to build, run, and maintain (and
imagine just how much cheaper they'd be if they were being built on the
scale that the regular oil-burners are!)  Solar and wind power make
sense in _most_ temperate climate housing. Broad-spectrum fluorescent
lighting can cut power cost by 80 or even 90% im most cases where
incandescent lighting is being used - as well as providing a better
quality light. Somehow, these things have not become universal - in
fact, these are all just barely out of that "imperceptible minority"
status. 

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
I find that hard to believe, but then again, I've never heard otherwise,
so I'll do some research next time I'm online. (If you have any links
you could throw my way, I'd appreciate that.)

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I seem to recall Ayn Rand in "Atlas Shrugged" describing the mindset of
people (ab)using a precious resource:

<p>[interpolated rather than quoted; I don't recall the exact words]

"Hell, it's unlimited - it'll never run out!"<br>
"Hey, there's enough for us, our kids, and their kids - why worry?"<br>
"It'll last out our generation, and they'll have to find their own way."<br>
"We've got years of it left, it'll be fine."<br>
"We've got enough to last out the year, and we'll have a solution by then!"

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Reminds me of a short story entitled "The Last Question" I read once. It
went something like this. At some point in the future, the earth is
running on nuclear power. In this scenario, we'll run out of fissionable
(sp? And is that even a word?) materials in 100 years or so. So the
resident supercomputer is asked if there's a better way to get energy.
And it designs a way to have a giant orbiting collector of solor energy
that powers everything on earth. And it works great. Cheap, clean power.
Two characters are talking about it later. [ This is not exact quoting,
I just kind of remember it went like this. ]

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
That is the correct spelling, and it is indeed a word, and not an
uncommon one - it's used to refer to any materials capable of undergoing
fission.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Oh, good. I was almost positive I had heard the word before, but
spelling it "fissionable" just seemed too simple.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
"All the energy that we could ever want! Free! Forever!"<br>
"Not forever. Only until the sun burns out."<br>
"We'll be dead by then."<br>
"We'd have been dead by the time nuclear power runs out, too. But you
said 'forever'. What will we do when the sun burns out? And don't say
'find another star', because they'll all be burning out at the same
time."<br>
"Then must be some way to keep the sun going."<br>
"You'd have to reverse entropy. And that's impossible."<br>
"Why not?"<br>
"You just can't!"<br>
"Wanna bet?"

<p>So these two guys ask the supercomputer if there's a way to reverse
entropy. And the computer says "not enough data at this time to answer".
And the story goes on in an interesting direction to a very interesting
ending, which I won't spoil here.

<p>I'm not sure if the fact that, in long (very long) run there's no such
thing as a renewable resource has any bearing on the discussion. But I
liked the story.



<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
 ...lather, rinse, repeat - to the point of complete resource exhaustion
and a crisis where the bastards float, unhurt, to the top (as they
always do) and Joe Public pays with his life in the worst case and his
money (representing a chunk of life that he'd spent to earn it) in the
best. Wanna bet? Ask any stockbroker. Shortsightedness is *never* in
short supply.
<blockquote>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
What would be an example of a resource this has happened to in the past?
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
But until then, using oil for everything probably won't do great things
for the environment. So we should probably have some level of the
government involvment. Maybe slowly raise emissions standards until oil
is priced out of the market. Or some such thing; I don't know.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I recall California passing a law - way back in the '80s - where some
percentage of all cars sold by any auto company in California by year X
(2000, I think it was) had to be electric. No idea what became of it;
maybe the Californians among us can enlighten me.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
An arbitrary tax on oil works great in Europe.  Better yet would be a
tax that accurately reflects the cost of compensating for the
environmental damage (including the lost farmland under freeways).  Then
the invisble hand of the marketplace would work properly. 

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
The issue of the environment is hard for me to figure out in terms of my
conservative, free-market, small-government ideas. The amount of
regulation makes me nervous. Because it's YOUR problem if your neighbor
decides to do something stupid to the groundwater, the government MUST
have standards regarding what you can put in the air, what you can put
in the water, what's okay, what's not, etc.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
As much of a libertarian as I may be - and it's relatively mild but
firmly fixed in my case - there are actions that must be taken by the
community to protect itself. Defining the limits of that "must" is the
biggest challenge and the greatest danger of the libertarian position -
there are slippery slopes in every direction, with very sweet bait hung
over the first step into each one.

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
#BEGIN Political Rant<br>
As Ben told me once, Bush can make *anyone* a liberal.  I was a
libertarian for years until Enron/Worldcom, misrepresented intelligence,
the DMCA and friends, and the current application of free trade finally
wore me down.  I'd still like to see small government (or better yet,
anarchy), but when the "deregulation" laws keep coming down that are
essentially one-sided freedom (for the corporations but not for the
public, for incumbent companies but not for new ones), while important
issues are ignored (e.g., healthcare), it makes me suspicious of any
"conservative" proposals.  The DMCA is a good bellwether.  It's
anti-competitive regulations disguised as common-sense property rights,
all designed to entrench the power of the current oligarchy.  I also see
all sorts of scams coming from ultra-free Tuvalu and think "there otta
be a law..."  Conservatives might want to think about how the current
Bush situation is turning off a lot of non-liberals who might otherwise
agree with them, and it may take a hundred years before we can trust
conservative leaders again.<br>
#END Political Rant

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
One thing that has helped me determine what the limits are is
remembering that there is no such thing as good government. Strong libel
laws? Free speech suffers. Weak/no libel laws? People will abuse free
speech to hurt other people.

<p>There's no good choices in governement; only endless tradeoffs.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
There _is_ a good choice in government, actually, and it's absolutely
implicit in what you've written above: a minimum necessary number of
those who will make the best compromises. However, the reality is that
politicians are *always* power-hungry - and we're all out of statesmen.
Cincinnatus, where the hell are the children of your spirit? We need
them desperately.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
What I meant by "there's no good choices in governement" (I could have
made this much clearer, BTW; sorry.) is that no choices made by a
governement will result in a utopia. No possible choices will result in
a society full of happy, hard-working people with a crime rate of zero.
Not gonna happen.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[gently] No amount of Open Source implementation is going to bring about
world peace, either. Sorry, my friend; that's not a reasonable
expectation from a government. Utopia - at least the closest definition
I can manage - would be an _internal_ and _individual_ state, not
subject to management by external agencies, and particularly not a
government.

What good government can do is govern. Protect, run some infrastructure
- between Mike and my sweetie in Baltimore (she's a flaming liberal, but
a stunningly brilliant lady who writes on medical issues in our society:
&lt;<a href="http://respectfulofotters.blogspot.com/">
http://respectfulofotters.blogspot.com/</a>&gt;), I've come to agree that some
programs are definitely better run by the government - facilitate a
society in which individual achievement is not hindered... and otherwise
stay the hell out of the way. As to _creating_ things, utopias or
otherwise, any government that purports to do this or even attempts it
fills me with horror, loathing, and an overwhelming desire to RUN AWAY
at top speed. The bastards are selling something, and what they're
selling, I'm not buying. I've *lived* there.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
It's not the direct job of a government to bring about utopia. If
anything it would be a useful by-product from them trying to "manage"
their own country; ideally, anyway.

<p>We as a nation of people must try and do this, preferrably en masse.
Isolated "utopia" is never going to work. There will be conflicts
always, since that is just a fact of life. It is an ironic fact that
usually, post-conflict usually does bring about some sort of rest.


<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
And before I realized this, I had believed that a utopian society was
possible. If you had asked me point-blank "Do you believe that a utopian
society is possible?" I would have said no. At one level, I knew that
was impossible. But in my heart of hearts, I thought "If only this
country was put under proper management...".

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Oddly enough, I'd disagree with that. You _can_ legislate morality;
history provides as many examples as you'd care to look for. No, you
can't stop the psychos - but most people, when their basic needs are
satisfied and their general comfort is assured, don't need to go rob or
murder someone for gain (which is not true in a society which has a huge
disparity between the haves and the have-nots.) However, the only way
that government can bring that about is by getting the hell out of the
way in most of the relevant cases - and *that* isn't what governments
do, by their nature. Politicians want more power, and anything goes when
that's on the line.

<p> I don't want to idealize the past, but the more I study Roma Antiqua,
the more I despise the current state of the world governments in
general. When the reputation (Dignitas and Auctoritas) of your family
(well, /gens/) is the most important thing that they have, and what you
do in public life reflects directly upon that, you get the Julii (i.e.,
Gaius cognominated Caesar), the Gracchi, the Aemilii Scauri, etc. OTOH,
when how much you can steal is what benefits you and your cronies and
has no repercussions beyond your term in office, you get - well, Bush.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Sorry, Jason -- it is not going to happen. I watch America from the
outside, and all I see is a front-spokesman, and a "leader" who is
ridiculed at every turn. 

<p>
<strong>[Jay]</strong>
'Well, just so you know, we're pretty embarassed about Bush over here'.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Some of the idioms in speech as well as his
actions (such as falling off a bike) really do amuse me. But it is worth
remembering that at the end of the day, the real power does not lie with
Bush per se, but rather his advisors, since it is they that really run
the country. Let's face it, Bush has enough trouble [1] trying to wipe
his own arse.

<p>But your linkage of utopia with governments is going to be a tenuous one
always; since even _if_ such a utopia were possible with nations it
would only ever be at a political level. You cannot expect people to
just turn the other cheek within a reasonable amount of time and say
"there, there, I forgive you". There is prejudice within our blood --
it is what we are.

<p>[1] To any FBI/MI6 people who are reading this, yes we _are_
opinionated, aren't we? :)

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
But even under the best of management, there would still be injustice.
People would still exploit others for personal gain. People would still
kill each other, still steal. No amount of government programs can
change that. No amount of money thrown at the problem can change the
basic nature of people.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Precisely which is why our actions will change us -- but it is society
as a whole that will change who we are, and the values we believe in.
You have to remember that religion plays a _very_ important part for a
lot of people.. [skip massive text here about that, but it is worthy of
a mention], and consequently people use this both as a comforter and as
an excuse.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Some things can only be justified by the fact that anything else would
be worse. War is probably the most notable example. It's not good; It
is, in fact, a great evil. It's just that sometimes (very rarely)
everything else is worse.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Agreed, in spades - at which point I must note that I do not consider
the current horror being perpetrated by our government to be a "war"
under that definition but "murder most foul". If nothing else (and there
is a HELL of a lot "else"), I want an accounting of what it is in Iraq
and Afghanistan that is worth one single American life. These kids are
dying over there for a...

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
... indeed. Let's see now. First of all, Bush decides that he has to
retaliate for September 11th. OK, fair enough, *charge* into
Afghanistan. What's that? No, surely not -- no Bin Larden. Woops. What
next? Hmm, I know, I'll choke on a pretzel and while I'm at it, I'll go
around the middle east waging war since I was unable to find Bin Larden
-- but I need someone to exact revenge against.

<p>Ouch! I cannot sit down, why's that? Hmm, seems Blair is up my arse,
better try and remove him. There, I'll put him in my lap instead. Good
doggy.....

<p>... Iraq. Oil? Prices of petrol. Hmm, I wonder if there is a link there
somewhere?


<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
I have to stop now. It's too much. The frustration of not being able to
DO anything directly, to change this, to bring them all home, will kill
me if I think about it too much.

<p>...

<p>So, how about that Local Baseball Team? Do you think they'll trade Young
But Promising Rookie, or what?

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Evil is just...evil. There is no point trying to turn it into a
hierarchy. But you are right, war is by no means the correct way to go
about solving issues.

<p>I could have said lots more, but I have skipped a lot of it..... It's
not really on-topic, any of this....

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
And so, some choices in government are like that. No, it's not good that
allowing people to set the prices of goods they are selling will allow
some of them to exploit others with unfair prices. It's just that price
caps are worse. And so and so forth for almost anything done by the
government.

We need something that's somewhat better now, and we can worry about
perfect later.

To elaborate on these two points, the goal is not hydrogen.  The goal is
a radical rethinking of efficiency.  If you think of waste as
nonperforming assets, it all falls into place.  Wasted 
energy/emissions/garbage represent assets you've paid for but can't use,
a drag on the bottom line.  If you design efficient use of energy and
materials into products in the first place, people can help the 
environment without cramping their lifestyle one bit, and end up with
significantly more money too.  It's the "kill two birds with one stone"
theory.  Hydrogen is not the end-all, it's just the most significant
step in that direction available at the moment.  Maybe we'll find
something better later.  But moving in that direction now means we'll
get at least somewhere, whereas not doing anything leaves us in the
present situation or worse.  If we'd invested in alternative energy
thirty years ago, it would be done now.  The result would have been more
primitive, but it would have eliminated, oh, the war in Iraq, runoffs in
streams, global warming, asthma attacks, etc.  All this combined
represents a much bigger cost than just doing it and getting it over
with.  Even if we did nothing with fuel-cell technology but donate it to
China and India, we'd still be out ahead.  They could get on with their 
development without harming the rest of the world.  

<p> There's more about this in my favorite book, _Natural Capitalism_ by
Paul Hawken/Amory Lovins (http://www.natcap.org/, entire text online).
Our industrial and economic processes were formed during the Industrial
Revolution when resources were plentiful and labor was scarce.  Now 
we're in the opposite situation: labor is plentiful but natural
resources are becoming scarce.  But we're still doing things the old
way, which is leading to frightening unemployment and ecological
situations.  Waste -- meaning products nobody wants; e.g., used
styrofoam cups, exhaust, PCBs -- can cut by 50% without too much
inconvenience just by thinking creatively.  It's even possible to reduce
waste by 90% and still come out ahead, as a few companies have done.  

<p> But it's much easier to build these features in during construction than
to retrofrit them later.  For instance, putting windows on the south
side in northern climates cuts down on energy requirements.  But most
developers don't take that into account; they just put windows wherever
they feel like it.  In my last apartment I didn't need to use the
bathroom light half the time coz the window was sufficient.  My current
bathroom doesn't have a window (even though it's an exterior wall), I
can't use a nightlight coz the outlet is tied to the wall switch, and I
can't use a flourescent bulb coz the builtin fixture is vanity lights
near eye level.

<p>He says hybrid cars are better than hydrogen cars because they can be
refitted for a variety of fuels pretty easily: petrol, natural gas,
methanol, hydrogenized whatever, etc.  And you can't compare estimated
future hydrogen efficiencies with the current generation of hybrids, you
have to compare them with the estimated future generation of hybrids.  
He even makes a case for hybridizing hydrogen cars.

<p> So which is better, hydrogen or hybrid?  I don't know.  All I know is,
either would be better than petrol cars, so even people with the
"losing" technology will be ahead.

<p> Crea goes on to talk about power exchanges between the consumer and
electric company, and an ice-cube air conditioner.

Even then the majority of fuelcells will still be "filled" by using fossil 
fuel, simply because it's cheaper. Currently sustainable energy is not widely 
used because of the enormous costs of using these sources in a world with an 
energy infrastructure which is exclusively geared towards fossil fuel. 

<p> Switching to hydrogen as a transmission medium will go a long way in reducing 
those costs and creating a level economical playfield for all kinds of energy 
sources. It is very likely that this will increase the use of sustainnable 
energy, especially because the pressure on fossil fuel companies, to pay the 
costs of the "side effects" associated with the mining, refining, 
transportation and use of fossile fuel, is increasing. 

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Our cost/benefit calculations are all out of alignment because people
and companies are able to externalize the cost of waste onto society, so
it doesn't appear on their balance sheet.  If they had to pay that cost
themselves, alternative energy would look incredibly cheap by
comparision.

<p> Prob'ly the biggest example of doublethink this past century was nuclear
energy.  Proponents said it would be nonpolluting and "too cheap to meter".  
Too bad the "nonpolluting" waste has to be stored gingerly for 10,000
years, and the price of cleanup wasn't factored into the cost per KwH.
It's incredible there are still people in 2004 pushing for a revival of
"nonpolluting" nuclear power as a cure for global warming.  Can't they
see the big purple elephant in the room?

<p> In Washington, five nuclear plants were terminated in various stages of
building/production due to public opposition.  The project was called
WPPSS, which the public pronounced "whoops" as in, "Whoops, the
utilities shouldn't have started these expensive projects without
ratepayer consent."  The utilities thought conservation was a cuckoo
idea until the environmentalists convinced them to try it.  So they've
been offering rebates and cheap loans the past several years for
weatherization, efficient appliances, and even light bulbs.  And
discovered, ahem, that the nuclear plants weren't needed after all.
Whoops.

<p> (OK, the *biggest* example of doublethink was nuclear weapons.  Was it
really MAD that prevented WWIII?  More likely it was NATO.  "An attack
on one is an attack on all."  The classic gang principle.)


<p> 
<strong>[Ramon]</strong>
As an added bonus the R&D budgets of energy related companies such as car 
manufactors, oil companies, electricity producers etc. will go to improving 
the efficiency of fuel cells and the associated infrastructure, instead of 
improving the efficiency of the petrol based infrastructure. There will be a 
gradual switch from petrol stations to fuelcell stations etc. etc.

<p> This basically offers all the people and companies in the world a way to 
gradually "write off" the enormous amount of money invested in the current 
energy infrastructure.

Well, someone certainly has. There was an article in Omni magazine in
the early 1980s that I remember quite vividly: the writer approached it
from a position of "here is what we need to do *as a system* - fueling
stations, etc." and had solid academic _and_ business credentials. He
was talking about converting cars, which would be a huge undertaking but
well worthwhile. It was actually one of my first exposures to the
concept of environmentalism.

Wired have an article that echoes those sentiments:

<p> My Dad told me that my uncle Tim came up with an idea for using hydrogen 
(the engine based on electrolysis) in the late 70s. He went to the 
patent office, and not only was he told that it was already a known idea 
(it was used in American space programme), he was also told that they 
had people coming in with it every couple of months.

The biggest problem with hydrogen fuel is storage.  Gas and liquid forms
look impractical, so current research is looking for a metal that
hydrogen could be stored in and recovered from at reasonable
temperatures.  This could potentially lead to a car without a fuel tank:
the fuel would be stored in the car's walls and shafts.  

<p> Iceland's top hydrogen researcher, Bragi Amason, shows off a
solar-powered hydrogen fan he invented as a demonstration.  
<ol>
<li> A light bulb (representing the sun) shines on a small solar panel.
<li> The energy electrolyzes water, separating the hydrogen and oxygen.
<li> The hydrogen is pushed through a membrane that holds the electrons
   back.  The protons mix with oxygen to form water again.
<li> The electrons are attracted to the water, which creates an electrical
   current...
<li> ... which powers a fan.
</ol>

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
"energy" here being what? Electricity? If not, what else can
"electrolyzes" water? And if so, why not just power the fan directly?

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Of course, but the purpose is to demonstrate hydrogen power, not to
make the fan work.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
WHAT?

<p> I have a major attitude problem with the idea of "demonstrating"
hydrogen power if solar energy would actually work better. I was
thinking that the reason was probably that using hydrogen power actually
got you more power than you started with. And now I realize that I was
kind of asking a loaded question: If the answer wasn't what I thought it
would be, I wouldn't believe it.

<p> So please, tell me there's actually a reason. It'd make me feel better.
(But only if there actually IS a reason)

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Science centers and high schools are full of useless experiments whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate how something works.  My science center has
a bicycle attached to a row of lights so you can see how many watts you're
producing.  Nobody is suggesting that's the best way to ride a bike, power
your lights, or run a fan.  (Although I did see an intriguing proposal to
reclaim the energy from aerobics-runners at gyms, which could count toward a
rebate off their membership fee.  Run for the environment!)  The point is
just to see whether the lights (or fan) go on and off.

I think there's one in London at the Millenium Dome.  They're usually

And our local Science Center of Pinellas County, with the only
publically accessible 12&quot; reflector telescope in town, and the Museum
of Science and Industry in Tampa, and of course Boston's Museum of
Science, which I grew up with.

<p>
BMOS had a replica Apollo capsule.  The switches didn't *do* anything,
but they did move.

Our local one was built in the 60s, which explains some of the choice of
exhibits.  (Pacific Science Center: <a href="http://www.pacsci.org/">

When I was little in the 70s, I just liked to flip the controls and watch the
blinkenlights.  When I was in high school in the 80s, the only thing
that was cool was the laser shows (Laser Rush, Laser Floyd, Laser
Beatles.  There might have been a Lazer Zeppelin too.  The 90s
generation went to Laser Nirvana. :)  I can only remember a few of the
exhibits:

<dl>
<dt>ROOM #1 - AERPSPACE: 
<dl>
  <dt>Space cockpit you can go in and flip the switches.  
  <dt>Gyroscope.
<!--
<br><br>
<strong>[Jay]</strong>
BMOS had a replica Apollo capsule.  The switches didn't *do* anything,

-->
</dl>
<dt>PLANETARIUM:
<dl>
  <dt>Lectures about the solar system.  
  <dt>IMAX films.  
  <dt>Laser shows.
</dl>

<dt>COURTYARD:
<dl>
  <dt>Bell Curve machine.  It drops little balls from the top that ricochet
  against staggered rows of pegs.  Most balls land near the center.  If
  you count the possible paths a ball can take to reach each bottom
  slot, you can see why they end up in the middle slots.
</dl>

<dt>ROOM #2 - MATHEMATICS:
<dl>
  <dt>The lamppost, representing a traveller taking random steps from a
  center lamppost.  Eventually he either reaches an edge or ends up at
  the lamppost again.  It looks kind of like a pool table with a grid of
  lights representing the positions.  Each step, a pair of giant dice
  are rolled (each in a tumbler cage) to select the direction.
  <dt>A funnel you can roll a ball in.  It swirls around for a couple
  minutes before reaching the bottom.
  <dt>Optical illusions (e.g., Escher).
  <dt>Perspective chambers (rooms with one wall taller than the other).
  <dt>A drawing pad with a pen on a pendulum thing.
  <dt>Lectures about the metric system.
  <dt>An interactive lecture to write a program controlling a robot using a
  few simple instructions.
</dl>

<dt>ROOM #3:
<dl>
  <dt>Indian longhouse.  Sometimes storytellers tell stories about Raven and
  Fox and the Great Spirit.
  <dt>Model of Puget Sound with tide currents.  There are little buttons you
  can press that release ink so you can follow the currents.  'Course
  when I was eight I had no concept of the sound or the islands; I just
  liked to watch the ink.
  <dt>Dinosaur skeleton.  (This was added in the 80s or 90s.)
  <dt>Quiet phone with no feedback.  Normal phones reflect your voice back
  through the speaker.
  <dt>Time-delay phone.  The feedback is delayed by a quarter second.  This
  freaks you out even more than the quiet phone.
</dl>

<dt>ROOM #4 - LIFE SCIENCES:
<dl>
  <dt>I don't remember what life sciences meant.
</dl>

<dt>ROOM #5 - PHYSICAL SCIENCES:
<dl>
  <dt>Bicycle generator with a row of lights showing how many watts you were
  generating.
  <dt>A TV with a U-magnet.  You hold the magnet in front of the screen and
  see a black spot at that point, with the picture distorted around it.
  <dt>A sign says, "Do not try this at home".
  <dt>Water drop demonstrations that look like pinball machines.  You press
  a button and a drop of water falls in a pool that's shaped like a
  parabola, etc.
  <dt>Black box demonstration.  You shoot rays into a black box and guess
  the shape inside based on the refractions.  This was something like a
  shuffleboard.
  <dt>Air pressure demonstration.  I don't remember the point, but one side
  had a vacuum pump without a light, and the other had a vacuum pump
  with a light.
</dl>
</dl>
<p> It's funny thinking back, how many of these demonstrations would be
computerized nowadays.

<p>
<strong>[Jay]</strong>
Indeed.

<p> But at the other end, BMOS also have what I think is the largest
Focault pendulum in the world.  Something like a 50' suspension wire,
built in an atrium.

I've been in one other science center, but darned if I can remember
where it was.  

<p> It was one room focusing mainly on space exhibits.  The exhibits were
more or less like ours but with a few I hadn't seen.  It might have
been the Fleet Space Theater and Science Center in San Diego<br>
<a href="http://www.globalinfo.com/noncomm/space/Space.HTML">
http://www.globalinfo.com/noncomm/space/Space.HTML</a><br>
I was in SD in 93 visiting a friend from college, and I think we might
have gone to this.

<p>There's Science World in Vancouver BC

Discovery Centre in Halifax NS (<a href="http://www.discoverycentre.ns.ca/">
http://www.discoverycentre.ns.ca/</a>), and prob'ly lots of others.


<p> San Jose has a technology center which focuses specifically on
the history of computers.  I don't remember the name but it's right in
downtown SJ and well worth visiting.  I went there when LinuxWorld 
was in SJ, I think 1999.  I found this link on google although I'm
not 100% sure it's the same place: <a href="http://www.thetech.org/">

For the ships, they are considering putting a hydrogen refiner (reactor) and
natural gas tank on board.  The closer they can get the refiner to the
usage point, the more efficient it is and the smaller the refiner can be.
Plus, ships need to be able to operate in the ocean for several weeks 
without going to a filling station.  


<blockquote>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Look at the issues that the old air-ships had. Hydrogen is *extremely*
combustable -- "volatile" doesn't even describe it enough. One false error
with hydrogen fuel and there won't be anything left...

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
And this happened... when?  The Hindenburg was destroyed not by a hydrogen
explosion but because the flammable paint on the surface caught fire.

As the latter link points out, the doomed Hindenburg's hydrogen, as it
burned from causes unrelated to its gas cells, went harmlessly upwards,
away from the passengers.  That's what hydrogen _does_ at the bottom of
a nitrogen/oxygen-filled gravity well.

<p> People were killed by either the fall or the burning of _other_ parts of
the craft.  The smart ones didn't jump, and (if not caught in the
burning gondola and skin) survived.

<p> (If memory serves, one of the US Navy's huge helium dirigibles, the
"Shenandoah", was torn apart in a freak windstorm in Ohio, and a number
of the crew rode the pieces safely to the ground -- from several
kilometers up.)

Cars, planes and houses blow up every day because of the flammability of
gasoline, jet fuel and natural gas, and houses burn down when the electrical
insulation fails.  Yet people still seem to drive and have electricity in
their house.  So it's not a question of making something safe unsafe, but 
of replacing one unsafe thing with another.  Once people get used to
hydrogen they'll know how to handle it.  No smoking at gas stations (same
as now).  Expect an almost invisible bluish flame radiating upward.  The
heat will only be very close to the flame.  Being underneath the flame
will be safer than with conventional fires.  Etc.

<p>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
And as they noted on Slashdot yesterday 
(<a href="http://www.pei.org/static/fire_reports.htm">
http://www.pei.org/static/fire_reports.htm</a>) the static generated by 
simply getting out of a car seat can be enough to ignite petrol vapours.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
There's a _large_ difference between storing hydrogen in metal and
feeding the power source from a buffer tank and keeping a huge gas
bladder full of the stuff. Incidentally, "storing in metal" doesn't mean
a metal container: I don't recall the specifics, but the method actually
deals with the permeability of metals and the gas is stored in the metal
itself. Makes it a little, shall we say, less reactive.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Uh-huh. But the fact still remains that it is still more reactive than
any other inflammable substance we have....

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[blink] Really? I guess you've never heard of sodium. Or hydroxyl
radicals. Or fluorine ([shudder]). That shit sets _sand_ on fire.
*Rocket designers* (who have, in the most literal sense, an insane lust
for power) won't touch it.

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Yeah - fluorine is a harsh substance - It's used a lot in the glass
industry. Can't think why.... :) Just make sure next time you piss off

Hydrogen is very stable. It can be dangerous to gather large quantities
of it in a single storage vessel, but that's not what's being proposed.
Oxygen, believe it or not, is a _lot_ worse (highly flammable, unstable,
and _very_ corrosive.)

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Heh heh, life exists on earth only coz the oxygen level is kept in a
certain range.  Too much oxygen and everything would burn up.

<p>
<strong>[Rick]</strong>
Well, hydrogen might be a reasonable risk for automobiles if it were the
case that we go around storing tanks of explosive substances in the latter.

<p>
{blink}  Oh, right, then.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
[grin] Yeah. I definitely see a hunk of, say, solid aluminum filled with
hydrogen in the atomic interstices as orders of magnitude safer than a
dozen gallons of sloshing gasoline just a foot away from a smokin' hot
exhaust pipe. Say, is that a rusted-through spot in that pipe?...

In movies, a car will explode if you look at it wrong. So I wonder, if
hydrogen cars become popular, and it is safer, what will the movie
industry do? Could they stand to script a car to fall several hundred
feet and *not* explode on contact? Would the American public be
satisfied to only see something smashed to bits, not smashed to bits and
blown up? Only time will tell, but my guess is no.

<p>
<strong>[Jay]</strong>
As Spider is fond of saying, the only things that will generally make a
car explode from a crash are a stunt coordinator or a dissatisfied
business rival.

<p>So...

<p>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Simple.  The cars that will be in car chases will mysteriously all be
gasoline cars.  The cars the squares drive will all be hydrogen for some
strange reason.  Since car chases are a redneck activity anyway, the
audience won't even notice at first.  Eventually the web bulletin boards
will start predicting from the first five minutes of the movie which cars
will be smashed (and thus which characters will be the victims), and *then*
the movie industry will have to think up something to make it unpredictable.

<p> One problem will be the police cars.  It's inconceivable that they wouldn't
switch to hydrogen early to be an example.  But cop cars have to blow
up spectacularly.  Maybe the director will just arrange for the car to
always be carrying something volatile when it's about to be smashed.

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Think about what you're talking about here: realism in movies. I've said
my piece.
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>[Jay]</strong>
See my reply to Jason; cars which blow up now, only do it in movies,
rather than in real life -- pity the poor spinal cases dragged out of
cars to avoid the 'inevitable' explosion -- so this won't really affect
movies.

But to side-track completely, Iceland has another interesting sideline for
fuel -- geothermal energy. Granted, this can only be used in-situ, but the
potential that this has had for both Iceland, and other countries has been
better than predicted.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Interestingly enough, I was just talking to a friend of mine about this
last night. His father works at the Scripps Oceanographic Institute and
is the world's top expert on sand transport by waves, who has also been
known to hold forth on power generation from the ocean. According to
him, the only practical method that has stood the test is hydrothermal:
pump up cold water from way down deep and let the stuff sink back down
through a pipe, which pulls more cold stuff up from the depths, etc. All
others, the ocean has either eaten or gunked up over time. I don't know
that Iceland is in position to take advantage of this, but Hawaii is
running a couple of islands off the stuff... *and* growing cold-water
lobsters to boot. Maine is _pissed,_ particularly since some evil people
have whispered "the Hawaiian ones taste better". <img alt=":)"

Re-circulating brine solutions work like this -- in the formation of
oolithic limestone for instance. The effect caused by the variations in
temperature of the water causes it to move in a circulation motion. It's
almost self-perpetuating.

<p>
<strong>[Ben]</strong>
Yep. Now imagine this happening in a large pipe, with turbines. Mmmm,
*juice*. <img alt=":)" src="../../../gx/dennis/smily.gif" width="20" height="24">

<p>
<strong>[Thomas]</strong>
I can see how this technique with the cold water has a direct influence
on power generation. Unfortunately, given the Mid-ocean ridge that is
near to Iceland, the only thing viable for them is geothermal energy --
they have more active hydrothermal vents than anywhere else in the
world.

The second half of the show discusses the prospects of hydrogen fuel in
the US.  There's a fleet of test cars running in California and DC.  
Bush has set up a research center, although some environmentalists are 
skeptical of its commitment given his refusal to increase the efficiency
of SUVs.  Nevertheless it's there.  Some investors are putting money
into hydrogen research, and eventually a lot of investors will find it
makes business sense.  Eventually, hydrocarbons will be more valuable
without the carbon than with.  And carbohydrates can also substitute,
giving something for the corn industry after people stop eating corn
syrup.  The coal industry will also be happy coz there's an 
emmissionless way to extract hydrogen from coal.

<blockquote>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
Note that Bush couldn't increase the efficency of SUVs if he wanted to.
He could ask someone in Congress to submit a bill to increase the
requiered efficiency of SUVs, but *he* couldn't do anything, short of
something sneaky and underhanded like an executive order.

<blockquote>
<strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
True, but his attitude influences Congress even if he doesn't have direct
power over them.  It discourages them from submitting the bill in the
first place, knowing he won't sign it.  It takes a lot of work to gather
enough votes to override a veto.

<p>
<strong>[Jason]</strong>
*nods*

<p>Wasn't thinking about the power of the veto mechanism when I wrote that.
It's near impossible to get enough of a majority (what is it--two
thirds?) to override a veto.

It always annoys when people pretend that a President can directly
control things like that. For instance, there was a little Q&A thing in
our newspaper that asked the (at that time) numerous Democratic
presidential canidates "What increases, if any, do you favor in the
$5.15 an hour federal minimum wage?". And lots of them said something
like "I would raise it X". And they can't do that! Congress and the
Senate have to vote on stuff like that.

<p> But it turns out that there's no limits placed on an executive order.
It's not mentioned in the US Constitution, but Presidents have been
issuing for quite some time.

Amory Lovins describes how the lightness and efficiency of hydrogen
makes other changes in materials and design possible, creating a
multiplicative benefit.  E.g., hydrogen cars can be lighter and more
aerodynamic than regular cars, thus requiring a smaller engine.  This
can reduce the net cost of driving by 2/5, and save hundreds of dollars
per car in terms of the gasoline that doesn't need to be
produced and transported to the gas station.  Plus the natural gas that
doesn't need to be used to produce the gasoline.  Even if hydrogen is made
from natural gas (the most likely short-term choice in the US, given its
abundance domestically and the existing pipelines) and the carbon
emissions are not recovered, the emissions are still several times less
than gasoline cars.  Plus hydrogen has this nice byproduct of
water/steam/heat that can be used for drinking, heating, or running a
refrigerator.  (Or for the dashboard coffee maker.)  An office building
with a fuel cell could do without a heating system, thus saving money
even if the cost per KwH is higher.

<p> At the end of the program is a short concert given by ducks, geese and
pigeons at a pond in Iceland.
