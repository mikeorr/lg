<EM>The long-awaited and much-needed "third choice" in Desktop
Environments for X ...</EM>

<p>One of the biggest debates in the Free/Open Source Software community
over the past year has been over KDE and GNOME.  Perhaps the major  
bone of contention between the two camps was the issue of licensing,
specifically the proprietary nature of the Qt library used by KDE.

<p>During these debates and outright flame wars, an alternative was 
lurking in the background.  Called XFce, it was a lighter-weight
desktop environment.  One could reasonably consider it a middle-ground
solution:  more configurable than running a window manager such as  
FVWM, but not the behemoth of KDE or the then-nascent GNOME. 
Unfortunately, XFce suffered from the same flaw -- a fatal flaw in the
eyes of many -- as KDE:  XFce was based on the Xforms library, a
proprietary widget set for the X Window System.

<p>Well, there is now some very good news for Free Software enthusiasts! 
Olivier Fourdan, author of XFce, has taken the dramatic step of
rewriting the whole project, using the GIMP toolkit.  Finally, we have 
what many consider the "holy grail" of desktop environments for X: 
a lightweight, highly configurable, reliable, attractive and
<b>100% free</b> alternative to KDE and GNOME.

<p>Recently, Olivier was kind enough to agree to an e-mail interview
and discuss these important developments.


<h3>Q: When and why did you first decide to write XFce?</h3>

<p>A: In late 1996, I started to work as a help desk analyst. As part of
this job, I was working with HP X terms running CDE. I really loved that
environment, and tried to find something similar on Linux.
Unfortunately, the only thing I found was the commercial port of the
real CDE to Linux, and it was really much too expensive for me.

<p>Then in early 1997, I started to play with XForms and fdesign, the
GUI designer.  One real cool thing about fdesign is its ability to
generate compilable C code from scratch. The XFce project had started,
but as usual, I really didn't think it could go that far!  I just started
coding a very basic toolbar with Xforms, and when I released the first
version on SunSITE (now called Metalab), people started asking for more
and more features.

<p>Initially, XFce was just the toolbar, without the window manager and
all the goodies. In 1998, I released XFce 2.x with xfwm, the window
manager. The rest of the goodies came from release to release ...

<h3>Q: What compelled you to rewrite XFce using the GIMP toolkit? Was
it for technical reasons, licensing reasons, or some mix of both?</h3>

<p>A: I was thinking of porting XFce to GTK+ (the GIMP toolkit) for a long
time. When the GNOME project started, somebody from the team sent me a
mail from Mexico telling me they were starting a new desktop project
with the GIMP toolkit and were looking for such a toolbar.
Unfortunately, I did not know anything about GTK+ at that time and my
skills in X programming were not as good as they are today.

<p>Last year, when I released XFce 2.x, I talked with the people from
Red Hat to see if they could use XFce in their distribution, but they
did not want Xforms-based applications because of the license the
library uses (it's free for private use and free applications, but the
source code is not available).

<p>As time passed, more and more projects were being based on the GIMP
toolkit. I had to make something really new with XFce, include drag and
drop, native language support, improve configurability, etc. So, at the
end of March 1999, I decided to start XFce 3.0 and rewrite it entirely 
from scratch with GTK+.

<p>Now I'm really glad I did that, XFce 3.0 is still fast and stable,
and it features all I wanted for XFce, under the GNU General Public 
License, based exclusively on GNU tools (NLS, autoconf, automake, etc.)

<h3>Q: Do you know which Linux distributions ship with XFce?  And do 
you know of any that will now ship with XFce3?</h3>

<p>A: I think Red Hat and SuSE both ship XFce 2.x on their additional
software packages, and Kevin Donnely has made a package for Debian. But
still, as XFce 2.x was based on Xforms, none of these distributions
include XFce in their base system. I know FreeBSD also provides XFce 2.x
as an additional package.

<p>XFce 3.0 is now all GPL, but I guess it is still much too recent 
to be included in any distribution -- although I really hope some
distribution will include XFce 3.0 in their base packages, among other
choices for the user.

<h3>Q: What do you think of GNOME and KDE, in general?  Can you briefly
summarize the relative merits of each versus XFce3?</h3>

<p>A: KDE is the first attempt to provide Linux with a fully integrated
desktop environment. I've been impressed by KDE 1.1! Unfortunately, KDE
is too close to Microsoft Windows; I really don't like the "Start
menu" style.  Sometimes you have to go through several submenus to
launch what you want (but this is a matter of taste). Moreover, KDE uses a
lot of system resources. For example, I was not able to use KDE on an X
terminal through a 10MB local network, whereas XFce works like a charm in
such a configuration.

<p>I don't know much about GNOME, as I could not make it work on my
computer.  But what I saw from it was very close to KDE, so the same
remarks apply to GNOME.  It seems to be so close to KDE that I don't
understand what the need was for two similar environments on Linux.

<p>I believe the desktop environment should be made to increase
user productivity. Therefore, the goal is to keep most system resources for
the applications, and not to consume all memory and CPU usage with the
desktop environment. For example, does KDE or GNOME fit on a 1.44 MB
floppy?

<p>GNOME and KDE both provide a lot more integrated tools than XFce
(although most of the time, separate tools are more powerful than the
integrated ones; for example, I believe NEdit is better than any
other Kedit or whatever).  The exception is KFM, the KDE File Manager,
which is far ahead the best program of all in KDE, in my opinion.

<p>Some people say XFce is for the little systems, while GNOME and KDE
are for bigger ones. I don't agree; the more memory and CPU you save for
your applications, the better it is. And if you still want to use KDE
and GNOME tools, because they are convenient for you, you can use them
under XFce, as its window manager is supposed to be compatible with
these applications, too.

<h3>Q: XFce3 -- could it be your new desktop environment?</h3>

<p>A: If you are looking for an alternative to KDE or GNOME, I strongly
recommend investigating XFce3.  It's small and efficient.  It's
functional and attractive.  And now, it's 100% GPL software.  Olivier
has just completed an upgrade to the XFce main page.  It includes links
for downloading mirrors and the HTML on-line manual for XFce3.

<p>Hopefully, all of the distributions will start shipping XFce as an
optional desktop environment.  It would be even better if at least one
of the distributions would ship XFce3 as the default option.  The Free
Software community is famous for giving users a choice.  XFce3 is now a
fantastic choice for people who want a free option other than KDE or
GNOME.  By shipping XFce3 as a default desktop, perhaps one of the
smaller, more up-and-coming distributions could make itself stand out
from the KDE/GNOME crowd.  XFce is a natural fit for any distribution
trying to make itself known as a faster, lighter-weight Linux option.

<p>In any case, XFce3 is worth a look.
