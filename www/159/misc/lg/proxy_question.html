Hey...I want to access restricted sites from behind my schools firewall.
Both the computers there and my home computer use linux. I might not be able
to install software on the school computer. What can I do?

1.  Volunteer to administer the school's network.
</p>

<p>
2.  Look up the phrase "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"
</p>

<p>
If nothing else, all of this will help towards mastering the art of
satire, which I've found gives great satisfaction in life.

Surely 2., is only applicable if 1. becomes true for him?  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

The #2 item was in part incentive for item #1.

1) Give up on accessing restricted sites from behind my schools firewall.
This would probably be the smartest approach, given that being caught is
clearly against your school's policy.
</p>

<p>
2) Assuming that you have 'ssh' installed, you can SSH out to an
"outside" machine and surf all you want from there, or you can run
Firefox (or whatever) on that remote machine and export the display to
your "inside" host. Conversely, you can set up a reverse firewall
piercer (a.k.a. an SSH tunnel) - the technique has been described in LG
and elsewhere.
</p>

</p>

<p>
3) If you don't have 'ssh' installed, you can try running MindTerm via
your browser (search the Web.) You can do most of the above via
MindTerm, although it's a bit more clunky.

Erm, that's "behind <strong>your</strong> school's firewall." If you were behind <em>my</em>
school's firewall, I'd institute measures <strong>so</strong> draconian and fearsome
that you wouldn't even have dared to ask. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
