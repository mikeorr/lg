</p>

<p>
I was searching for an Assembler to COBOL converter and found &amp; enjoyed
your article at <a href="../126/TWDT.html">http://linuxgazette.net/126/TWDT.html</a>
</p>


<p>
Could you tell me the conversion tool used to convert assembler to COBOL ?
</p>


<p>
Do you also know of a PL/1 to COBOL converter ?
</p>


<p>
I, Owen Townsend, owen@uvsoftware.ca, website www.uvsoftware.ca
have tools to convert mainframe JCL to Korn shell scripts
</p>

<p>
&amp; mainframe COBOL to Micro Focus COBOL
</p>

<p>
&amp; EBCDIC DATA to ASCII preserving any packed/binary data.
</p>


<p>
I have had questions from prospects asking about assembler &amp; PL/1 conversion
so would be interested in finding tools for these conversions.
</p>


<p>
Please look at my web site. You might be interested in downloading
my free 'uvhd' utility from www.uvsoftware.ca/libuvhd.htm
</p>

<p>
- file investigation utility
</p>

<p>
- displays data in vertical hexadecimal
</p>

<p>
- great for files with packed/binary data
</p>

<p>
- browse, search, select, update
</p>

<p>
I am listing it in the GNU FSF directory.
</p>

<p>
Thanks, Owen

[Hmm ...  I appear to have, yet again, subtly broken your lovely
pinehelper.pl script.  I mean, should Subject: be that plain?
Production version at end.  When I mouse-over the link, I see
mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=Talkback:152/okopnik.html,
so I must have broken some quoting stuff in the script.  Or maybe you
already fixed this, and I should check old mail for the fix?  Good
idea.  :-]
</p>

<p>
But I digress.

  Re: Review of the Plat'Home OpenBlockS
</p>

<p>
You editors make tough reviewers.  I imagine the poor guys at
Plat'Home are shaking their heads and muttering "never again" over
and over.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of Linux, <strong>all</strong> the documentation read like it had
been written by one of Ted T'so's worshippers, shipped to Germany for
reformatting, filtered through Chef, then translated by Vietnamese
into English (out of this was born the LDP).  Others aren't so lucky
as us in this modern age of ours.
</p>

<p>
I thought it courageous (though perhaps obviously doomed to failure)
to ship you their latest for review.  Were you trying to buy and use
this thing, or did they think you were only reviewing it for
publication?
</p>

<p>
I envy you that secret weapon of yours.  It's fascinating reading to
hear you two go at translating their dox into meaningfulness.  I hope
you passed on your notes to Plat'Home?
</p>

<p>
And, yeah, frankly, telnet/ftp <strong>ought</strong> to be locked down to the serial
interface *until you* open them up!  That is good security.  Both of
them transmit pwords en clair, dammit.  Cut 'em some slack (I humbly
suggest).
</p>

<p>
Have you any experience with Soekris boxes or Mini-ITX form factor?
That's likely what you're really looking for (if you weren't just
offering to review the thing), though they aren't really "palm sized"
either.  OpenBSD uses Soekris in demos showing their pf firewall
running in parallel on two boxes, cleanly failing over when power's
cut on one of them, no transmission loss.  Slick.
</p>

<p>
Interesting review.  I think I would have taken the thing with a bit
more of a grain of salt than you, but I wasn't there.  At least I know
this is not the next box to try to move Mom to.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">  However, I've
been intrigued by it since I heard of it too.

Hi Jimmy
</p>

<p>
I like your topic about del.icio.us script in linuxgazette.net:
<a href="../110/oregan1.html">http://linuxgazette.net/110/oregan1.html</a>
</p>

<p>
But the script is hard for me to understand how to collect it,
I hope you send me a compressed file contains all files I need to
apply this script
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much.
</p>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't like to invoke Yet Another Interpreter (Perl, Python, etc.) for
&gt; &gt; &gt; simple problems, when I've already got a perfectly good one (the bash
&gt; &gt; &gt; shell) running, and all those wonderful GNU programs.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; You know, I'm often puzzled when people say that. Whether you have Bash
&gt; &gt; running or not, your script launches another instance of it - *as an
&gt; &gt; interpreter.* The memory footprint of bash plus grep is not going to be
&gt; &gt; much smaller than that of Perl, either. You also lose the capability of
&gt; &gt; (easily) writing the result back to the original file. In what way is
&gt; &gt; this better?
&gt; &gt;
&gt; The bit about launching another interpreter is forehead-slappingly correct, of 
&gt; course. I have systems where bash is the only interpreter present. Sendmail's 
&gt; restricted shell is disabled, etc. I wonder if I'm not subconciously making 
&gt; peace with that situation, rather than growling about it.
</pre>

<p>
That would be understandable, certainly. I'm a big fan of the functional
overlap that is afforded by the various programming tools plus the
standard Unix toolkit - it means that you can usually get the job done
even when you're missing your favorite gadget. Believe me, I have
nothing at all against 'grep' - especially when it's wearing that
Superman cape with a '-E' option stenciled on the back. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; My 'dense' actually does other things via switches, such as reporting on local 
&gt; modifications to config files via a mandated '# LOCALMOD date name reason' 
&gt; standard, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; But it just growed, and most of it is far too nasty (non-standard switches, 
&gt; etc.) to ever be seen by the public. I just grabbed the two most relevant 
&gt; lines, and pasted. You'll have seen my shebang typo, for instance. 
&gt; The 'dense' that's really in use does have the advantage of actually being 
&gt; runable...
</pre>

<p>
Heh. I've done a number of those in my time... although after a certain
point, I got into a habit of going back and rewriting them if I found
that they kept on being useful. I actually have two projects of that
sort on the slow burner right now: my lightweight MTA ('bssmtp'), and
the LG mailbag processor. The latter actually has a comment in it that
says
