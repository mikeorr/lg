<h1>Software for Kids</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Here in Ireland we have a talk show, the <a href=
"http://www.rte.ie/tv/latelate/">Late Late Show</a>, which has the
distinction of being the world's longest running talk show. Every
year, a couple of weeks before Christmas, they have the Late Late
Toy Show, to give parents and children an idea of what's
available.</p>

<p>Since Christmas is approaching, I thought I'd try to bring this
tradition over to the Linux Gazette. There is a lot of very good
children's software available for Linux, but unfortunately not a
high level of awareness of it.</p>

<p>I'll be focusing on the seven-year old age group, simply because
my son, Mark, is seven (and an all-important half) and the software
he likes is the software that has stayed on the machine.</p>

<h3>KTuberling</h3>

<p>KTuberling, or Potato Guy, is part of KDE. The idea is simple;
it's a virtual Mr. Potato Head. Mark has had hours of fun with it
over the last two years.</p>

<p>KTuberling has an option to save an image of the Potato Guy.
This is a great idea - Mark had a couple of his creations as his
wallpaper until I installed Tuxpaint.</p>

<h3>Stickers</h3>

<p><a href=
"http://users.powernet.co.uk/kienzle/stickers/index.html">Stickers</a>
is a sticker board program; you pick up a sticker from the palette,
and place it where ever you like. The stickers can be resized, used
as brushes, flipped around, have their saturation and brightness
changed, etc.</p>

<p>The program has a great function which allows you to keep the
mouse pointer confined to stickers' window. This is great for
younger children, who haven't learned how to keep control over the
mouse. Mark has been using this for over three years, and shows no
sign of growing tired of it.</p>

<h3>Tuxpaint</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/">Tuxpaint</a>
is a paint program from <a href=
"http://www.tux4kids.com/tux4kids/">Tux4Kids</a> and <a href=
"http://www.newbreedsoftware.com">New Breed Software</a>, and the
first in a series which will include a word processor and a DTP
program. Tuxpaint at first glance is a normal paint program, albeit
one with an interface suitable for the very young; but there are
two options on the menu which make it special, "Magic" and
"Stamp".</p>
<img src="misc/oregan/tuxpaint.jpg" alt="TuxPaint">
<p>The stamps are a range of images which can be placed anywhere on
the canvas, much like Stickers. The magic menu has thirteen effects
which can be applied to the image, from the unique, such as the
"drip" effect, which makes the selected portion of the image look
like the paint ran; to standard effects, such as pixelization
("blocks"), with a childish touch.</p>

<p>Help is provided at the bottom of the screen, where Tux gives a
brief instruction on how to use each tool.</p>

<h3>GCompris</h3>

<p><a href=
"http://gcompris.free.fr/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=2">GCompris</a>
is the daddy of kids programs for Linux. It's a framework for board
based children's games, and includes many games for many ages. The
package covers all age groups, with activities that range from
teaching the alphabet to teaching chess. It also includes several
games which have less educational value.</p>

<p>The activities come in 5 categories: reading, amusements,
computers, board based, and algebra. The amusement category seems
to be the miscellaneous section; there is a subsection for learning
colors, the difference between left and right hands, and how to
read an analog clock. There is also a continents jigsaw, where
the country must be placed in the correct place, and I have to
admit that I learned from this.</p>

<p>The computer section has activities to build keyboard and mouse
skills, and the algebra section has several activities. Taken as a
whole, these are better for younger children than tuxmath, as
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can be taken
individually.</p>

<p>One difficulty I faced with GCompris is that at first I couldn't
get the sound to work. GCompris uses audio in Ogg Vorbis files, so adding a
.libao file in my home directory with the entry
<tt>default_driver=arts</tt> sorted it out. 

</p>

<h3>Finding more software</h3>

<p>The first place any parent should start looking for software for
their children is <a href="http://www.linuxforkids.org/">Linux for
Kids</a>. The site doesn't look to be frequently updated, but I
haven't found any broken links.</p>

<p>Debian users are spoiled for choice because of the <a href=
"http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Jr.</a> subproject.
Debian Jr. is aimed at "children from 1 to 99", and makes sure that
the best software for children is just an <tt>apt-get</tt>
away.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.seul.org/edu/">SEUL/edu</a> is a project
aimed at promoting educational software. Though not all of the
software listed in their <a href=
"http://richtech.ca/seul/">application index</a> is aimed at kids,
quite a lot is. You may even find something you'll find useful for
yourself: I found <a href=
"http://www.lingoteach.org/">LingoTeach</a> there.</p>

<p>If you're interested in seeing Linux in schools, have a look at
the <a href="http://www.schoolforge.net/">Schoolforge</a> project,
which exists to make sure that Linux has all the tools needed by
schools.</p>

Jimmy is a single father of one, who enjoys long walks... Oh, right.

<p> Jimmy has been using computers from the tender age of seven, when his father 
inherited an Amstrad PCW8256. After a few brief flirtations with an Atari ST
and numerous versions of DOS and Windows, Jimmy was introduced to Linux in 1998
and hasn't looked back.

<p> In his spare time, Jimmy likes to play guitar and read: not at the same time, 
but the picks make handy bookmarks.
