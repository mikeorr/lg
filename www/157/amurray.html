<h1>Init Call Mechanism in the Linux Kernel</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/amurray.html">Andrew Murray</a></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The Linux kernel has for a long time (at least since v2.1.23) contained a
clever and well-optimised mechanism for calling initialisation code in
drivers. It's clever because its functionality is largely abstracted from
the driver developer, and it's well-optimised because after initialisation,
memory containing the initialisation code is released. This article
explores how this mechanism works. </p>

<h3>Typical Usage</h3>

<p>
We'll start by seeing how driver developers make use of this functionality;
the following code comes from linux-2.6.27.6/drivers/net/smc911x.c and is the
driver for a common Ethernet chipset (smc911x).
</p>

<pre class="code">2206: static int __init smc911xinit(void)
2207: {
2208:     return platform_driver_register(&amp;smc911x_driver);
2209: }
...
2216: module_init(smc911x_init);</pre>

<p>
The smc911xinit function can be considered as the entry point into the
driver; of particular interest is the __init macro and the static
declaration. The __init macro is used to describe the function as only
being required during initialisation time: once initialisation is
performed, the kernel will remove this function and release its memory. The
module_init macro is used to tell the kernel where the initialisation entry
point to the module lives, i.e. what function to call at 'start of day'. In
a typical driver, you will often see many functions marked with the __init
macro - these are used for initialisation - and a single module_init
declaration.</p>

<p>
Even though we are expecting the kernel to call smc911x_init at 'start of
day', we have marked it as static - but that's OK (later, we will see how
the function is called). This is a particular strength of the init call
mechanism: it reduces the amount of public symbols and reduces the
coupling between driver modules and other parts of the kernel.</p>

<p>
The optimisation provided by the init call mechanism also provides a means
for recovering memory used by the initialisation data. Such data can be
'tagged' with the __initdata macro.</p>

<p>
With the above code in place, at an appropriate time during start-up, the
kernel will call the smc911xinit function, and once it has been executed its
memory will be released. You can see this in the output from kernel
(e.g. dmesg); for example, an x86 machine may print the following:</p>

<pre>Freeing unused kernel memory: 386k freed</pre>

<p>
This line is telling us that 386k of memory that previously contained
initialisation code and data has now been freed.</p>

<h3>Under the Hood</h3>

<p>
OK - So we've seen how the mechanism is used. Now, let's take a closer
look and see how it works under the hood. A quick 'grep' reveals that the
__init macro is defined in include/linux/init.h:</p>

<pre class="code">43: #define __init      __section(.init.text) __cold</pre>

<p>
The __section and __cold macros are defined in the various
include/linux/compiler*.h files:</p>

<pre class="code">compiler.h: 182: #define __section(S)  __attribue__ ((__section__(#S)))
compiler-gcc4.h: #define __cold        __attribue__ ((cold))</pre>

<p>
And when we expand it out we get:</p>

<pre class="code">#define __init __attribute__((__section__(".init.text"))) __attribute__ ((cold))</pre>

<p>
Thus, when the __init macro is used, a number of GCC attributes are added
to the function declaration - in the case of a different compiler, the
compiler.h file will ensure the macros expand out to whatever is necessary
for the relevant compiler. The <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html">cold
attribute</a> is a relatively new GCC attribute and has existed since
GCC4.3 - its purpose is to mark the function as one that is rarely used,
which results in the compiler optimising the function for size instead of
speed. What we are really interested here is the 'section' attribute. The
__init macro uses this attribute to inform the compiler to put the text for
this function in a special section named ".init.text". The purpose here is
to put all initialisation functions in a single ELF section such that the
entire section can be removed after initialisation has been performed.</p>

<p>
So what does module_init do? Its exact functionality depends on whether the
module in question is built-in or compiled as a loadable module. For the
purposes of this article, we'll be looking at the built-in modules.  Back
to include/linux/init.h:</p>

<pre class="code">259: #define module_init(x) __initcall(x);
204: #define __initcall(fn) device_initcall(fn)
199: #define device_initcall __define_initcall("6", fn, 6)
169: #define __define_initcall(level, fn, id) \
170:            static initcall_t __initcall_##fn##id __used \
171:            __attribute__ ((__section__(".initcall" level ".init"))) = fn</pre>

<p>
Yet another load of macros that result in even more GCC attributes being
defined!</p>

<pre class="code">#define module_init(x) static initcall_t __initcall_x6 __used \
                       __attribute__ ((__section(".initcall6.init"))) = x;</pre>

<p>
And for clarity, let's expand our module_init macro as used in our
ethernet driver:</p>

<pre class="code">static initcall_t __initcall_smc911x_init6 __used \
                  __attribute__ ((__section(".initcall6.init"))) = smc911x_init;</pre>

<p>
As you can see, module_init in the context of a built-in driver results in
declaring a function pointer with a unique name to our point of entry. In
addition, the macro ensures the function pointer is located in a special
section of the ELF - we'll see why shortly.</p>

<p>
So at present, we have ensured that all our initialisation code and data is
stored in the .init.text section, and that each module has a function
pointer for its point of entry - which has a unique name and is also
stored in a special section of the resulting ELF. In addition, during link
time the include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h and arch/*/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S
scripts ensure that some labels/symbols surround the start and end of these
sections. I.e. __early_initcall_end and __initcall_end mark the start and
end of the function pointers and __init_begin and __init_end mark the start
and end of the .init.text section.</p>

<p>
Finally we are in a position to see how these functions get called and how
they are eventually freed. The function do_initcalls in init/main.c is
called during kernel startup. This is shown below:
</p>

<pre class="code">749: static void __init do_initcalls(void)
750: {
751:      initcall_t *call;
752:
753:      for (call = __early_initcall_end; call &lt; __initcall_end; call++)
754:           do_one_initcall(*call);
755:</pre>

<p>
The purpose of this loop is to execute each of the init functions as set
up by the module_init macros. This is achieved with a simple 'for' loop and a
function pointer. Initially, the function pointer is pointed to the label at
the start of our function pointer's ELF section, and is incremented (by the
size of a function pointer (sizeof(initcall_t *)) until the end of the ELF
section is reached. For each step, the pointer is invoked and the init
function is thus executed.</p>

<p>
Once initialisation is complete, a function found in the architecture-
specific code named free_initmem is used to release the memory pages taken
up by the initialisation functions and data. The exact nature of the
function varies between architectures.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
In a nutshell, the kernel makes clever use of macros and <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html">GCC
attributes</a> to ensure that initialisation functions and pointers to them
are stored in unique sections of the ELF. Initialisation code at kernel
startup then iterates through these function pointers and executes them in
turn. Finally, once all init code has been executed, the entire ELF section
(.init.text) is freed for re-use! The best part of this mechanism is that
the provided macros completely hide its underlying complexity, thus leaving
more time for driver developers to focus on the job at hand.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>

<p>
 The best way to fully understand parts of the Linux kernel is to browse
the source code - and that's exactly how I wrote this article. I did,
however, make extensive use of <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/">the Linux Cross Reference</a>
- this site and many like it allow you to explore the source code and
easily find out where functions are called and defined.</p>

<p>
For more information on GCC attributes, read the GCC online documentation
- in particular see section <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html">5.2.7
Declaring Attributes of Functions</a>.
