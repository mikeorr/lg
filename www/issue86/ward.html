<p align=center><i>The pros and cons of vmWare for the Linux enthusiast.</i></p>


<p>vmWare is a virtual machine. That is to say, it emulates an Intel-based PC in 
much the same way there are emulators for Motorola-based machines out there. Though 
the fact that it is emulating an Intel-based platform while running on ... an Intel-
based platform (!) means that vmWare can in fact pass many instructions straight to 
the CPU for execution with no intermediate translation, thus speeding up the process 
somewhat. This is a bit different from a Java virtual machine, for instance, where 
the emulator gets to translate Java byte-codes to Intel instructions before getting 
them executed.</p>

<p>Yes, it is a commercial program; i.e. you <EM>should</EM> pay for it, though you do get to 
evaluate for free. Now, before going into the details, allow me to state my position 
on commercial programs: I am not against commercial programs. I have used several 
commercial programs that were in fact pretty good, and well worth the money invested.
However, I do prefer open-source software, not for the ecomical aspect but because that 
if - or rather when - something goes wrong or is not quite what I need, I 
can fix it myself instead of depending on a corporation to do it at their leasure. 
I have nothing against vmWare, on the contrary ... but for the above reason I would 
much prefer to be reviewing an open source version of the same type of program.</p>

<p><b>Why use vmWare?</b></p>

<p>1/. One good reason to use it is when you really must. For example, I use a laptop 
at work that is shared between several people (not yet Linux users), and that 
for mainly administrative reasons:</p>

<ul><li>must run Windows 2000</li>
<li>cannot be repartitioned as a dual-boot</li></ul>

<p>On the other hand, I teach a course on web site creation and administration with 
Apache and PHP, for which it is expedient to use a laptop running Linux and 
X Windows.</p>

<p>2/. vmWare sets up a virtual machine that you can configure according to your needs - 
not according to the real hardware on your computer. For example, it sets up by 
default a 4 GByte file on the hard drive to emulate the drive on the virtual machine. 
To the virtual machine, this file looks like a SCSI drive, when it is in fact just 
a file on the IDE drive. Also by default, it uses an IDE CD drive just like ... an IDE 
CD drive. Though you can tell it to use it as a SCSI drive, or set up an ISO CD-ROM 
image as a drive with the CD inside it (e.g. for installation). You get to use hardware 
you don't actually have, such as tape drives. Good for experimentation.</p>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/screen0.jpg"></p>

<p>3/. You can also have several virtual machines running at the same time, and set up a 
local network on your computer with different operating systems. This is good either to </p>

<ul><li>try out a new OS without repartitionning (wiping it back out is just a click away :-)</li>
<li>see how the new OS integrates your existing network before having to format a 
(sometimes unavaiblable) computer</li>
<li>show people how multiple OS integrate with a single LCD projector</li></ul>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/screen3.jpg"></p>

<p>4/. If you really need a program that does not run on the main operating system, 
you get it in a window.</p>

<p>Rather interestingly, this used to be a problem for Linux users that needed 
programs available only under Windows (usually commercial). Word processors and 
spreadsheets were a bit of a problem before StarOffice and OpenOffice became 
commonplace. Right now, I find I often have this problem in reverse: I get interesting 
programs for Linux that are available only with difficulties for Windows, or not any 
recent versions. Some examples are mathematical plotting tools such as gnuplot and scilab, 
or just user programs I prefer like Evolution.</p>

<p><b>Why not use vmWare?</b></p>

<p>1/. Speed. After all, we are sharing a single CPU between two or more operating 
systems. Though this problem is mitigated if we run user-land programs on just one 
system at a time. By the way, it would be nice on a SMP system to have vmWare dedicate 
one CPU to each virtual machine ... though probably impossible to have without 
redesigning the host operating system's kernel completely.</p>

<p>2/. Speed once again. You do need plenty of physical RAM to run at a reasonable 
speed. Try to have at least 128 MByte per operating system, or be prepared for intensive 
swapping. This may be a problem on a laptop, either way (remember that a laptop's hard disk 
is not built for intensive use). Try not to use the virtual machines' swap systems.</p>

<p>3/. Speed, third time 'round. All peripherics (drives, network cards) are shared 
between virtual machines. For example, on a machine with two virtual machines running 
and with much luck, each system gets a fair share (one third - remember the host 
system!) of the bandwidth. Actual results can be much lower, depending mainly on the 
host operating system's design and efficiency.</p>

<p><b>Installing vmWare</b></p>

<p>Using vmWare is rather easy. I got to install only the Windows version (because of 
bandwith problems for downloading), and as noted above it is the version I needed the most. 
However, it may make more sense to use the more stable OS as host; i.e. run Windows 
in a virtual machine on a Linux host computer instead of the opposite as I was forced 
to do.</p>

<p>Installing Linux in a virtual machine is as easy as:</p>

<ul><li>creating a new virtual machine with the desired characteristics</li>
<li>inserting the Linux bootable CD in the drive (or you could set up it's ISO 
image as a virtual CD drive)</li>
<li>powering up the virtual machine</li></ul>

<p>I installed both SuSE 8.1 and Mandrake 8.2 with no problems in this way, 
though the virtual machine insisted on an IDE CD drive for booting. I was able 
to switch to a SCSI drive once the system was installed, though.</p>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/screen2.jpg"></p>

<p>The virtual machine has access to the network through a proprietary vmWare 
bridging protocol - but only if your network card has been enabled on the host system. 
It can either use a static IP address or get a dynamic address from your 
network DHCP server.</p>

<p>You can then connect to a server running on the virtual machine from the 
virtual machine itself, from other computers on your network, or even from 
the host computer through the virtual machine's external network address.</p>

<p>Note that vmWare assigns to both the host system and virtual machines addresses 
on subnetworks 192.168.19.0/24 and 192.168.199.0/24 for its bridging protocol - 
you cannot use these for your connections.</p>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/screen4.jpg"></p>

<p>There may be more straightforward ways of passing files from one system to 
another, but the easiest I found was to set up a Samba server on the virtual 
Linux machine. It works well enough, and is logically faster than a 100 Mbaud 
link, but may not be a good idea in a production environment.</p>

<p align=center><img src="misc/ward/screen5.jpg"></p>

<p>The end result of all this is that I find vmWare a fascinating concept -  with 
its drawbacks, true enough. It can be useful in a development environment, either 
for programming or for systems administration. But it should be avoided for 
production: if you really need two operating systems, you may be better off buying 
two computers!</p>




<p>PS. Should anybody want to translate this article: I wrote it in
the spirit of  the GPL software licence. i.e. you are free (and 
indeed encouraged) to copy, post and translate it -- but please, 
PLEASE, send me notice by email!  I like to keep track of translations --
it's good for the curriculum :-)</p>
