Subject: Help Wanted -- Article Ideas
<p>
I'm at that point in my Linux development where I'm comfortable with 
the basics, and am venturing out to learn and discover the myriad of 
alternatives which exist.  While I appreciate the many alternatives, it 
can be difficult for someone with little experience to decide which 
MUA, MTA, proxy..is most suitable.  When each individual must 
personally begin anew to evaluate the field, unnecessary repetion of 
efforts results and often a selection is made based on incomplete 
information.  When the user later discovers a more suitable 
alternative, and possibly later another, a glutton of inefficiency 
results.
<p>
On that note, I'd like to suggest "head-to-head" comparision articles 
of similar programs.  A chart with columns and rows which represent the 
programs and the features would be invaluable for Linux users ranging 
from completely new to advanced, thus I would consider that a 
necessity.  Optionally, different recognitions may be given for 
exceptional achievement. Notes on individual programs or categories, 
and a brief summary would probably be required.
<p>
If thorough analytical evaluations were performed, this may exceed the 
resources and other imposed limitations of Linux Gazzette, but I'm not 
asking for that much depth.  I'm just looking for a cursory examination 
of programs with a comparison of features in a "side-by-side" format.
<p>
While I appreciate the reviews of individual programs, and enjoy the 
deeper attention which can be given, there is an ever-increasing number 
of alternatives available to the Linux user, and summary comparisons of 
programs is now a very real need, and the importance will only increase 
with time.
<p>
Please consider adding a side by side summary comparison of programs 
feature article.  I think this would not only make Linux Gazzette 
better than it already is, but also expand the readership.  Thanks and 
sincerely,
<p>

Subject: passwd shadow convert problem
<p>
I am running RedHat 4.2 with normal passwords since a couple
of month's. Now i read the shadow-password howto and i
wanted this also to work on my system. After reading the manual
i went to a 'blank' redhat system with a couple of users and i 
ran /usr/sbin/pwconv5 and the shadow was up and running fine.
BUT on another system (same as the first) but with a lot more
users the pwconv5 runs but won't stop. It makes an empty shadow
file and i have to kill pwconv5 because it isn't doing anything.
<p>
I then copied the passwd file from the second to the first system
and tried on the first system... and the same problem.. no shadow.
<p>
Can anybody tell me what i do wrong !?
<p>
Thanks everybody.

Subject: Help Wanted!
<p>
I'm running RH 4.2 with kernel 2.0.30 on an Intel P90, I've only been at
this for a couple weeks so go easy on me if this is a stupid question.  :)
<p>
I'm trying to get ppp to working for dialing into my ISP, but no matter
what I do it disconnects.
<p>
Here's a small description of what is going on:
I set up /dev/modem --> /dev/cua1 and enabled full permissions on both.
Set the jumpers on my modem for com2, irq3.
Ran setserial to setup the proper device settings.
Re-compiled the kernel for ppp.
checked my modem init strings.
<p>
Now, no matter what I use (minicom, shell scripts, netcfg), the chat script
goes through the proper procedure and starts up ppp on the server side,
passes control to pppd, which connects ppp0 <--> /dev/modem, and after
that, the modem hangs up (within about 2 seconds).
<p>
I've tried all kinds of command line args to pppd, with no luck.  Can
anyone help me out here?
<p>
Later,
Nolan

Subject: Linux and routing
<p>
I have heard that you can connect a LAN to the internet via just 1
assigned IP address.  This is what I am planning on doing, however, I do
not know how one would go about doing it, and I would like to ask you if
you could do an article about it. <i>(Any takers among our readers?
--Editor)</i>
<p>
I plan on getting a cable modem soon, so the bandwidth would be pretty
high, so that is why I have decided to try to make this connection 
provide for my whole house via a LAN connection in my home. What I have
read is that you could use the private IPs, meaning the 10.x.x.x or so, 
192.168.x.x and some others for the IP of the LAN and have these connect
to some box (the LINUX box?) that would provide its connection to the
internet to the inside LAN connected to the box. Is the problem that 
you would have to route the assigned address to the private IPs for the
LAN use. I have also read that this would slow down the connection a
bit or something, but that is a price I am willing to pay. So, the 
summary of the question is how would I be able to connect many computers
to the internet via just 1 assigned IP address? I would like to be able
to do it using my LINUX box connected to the internet via cable modem,
and to my LAN via an Ethernet link. Any help is much appreciated,
thanks.

I am new in the Linux world. How new? I am so new that I have just ordered
a Redhat release 5.0. Though this is a new world I am very glad I am one of
you, the Linux lovers.
<p>
I used to have a 386 25 MHz computer. Not long time ago I bought a Pentium
200 MHz computer. Since then I have not played with 386. Is there any easy
and economical way to connect the 386 to the Pentinum computer where I will
install the Release 5.0. If so, what I can do with it or at lease what I
can learn from it.
<p>
Thank you very much. Waiting for talking to you.

I was wondering if it is possble to get windows 95/NT to authenticate
to LINUX (using nis or nis+). I'm really getting tired of adding
accounts on the nt boxes for the linux boxes (for smb)...Is there any
commercial software availible? 
<p>
I know of d-sync [http://www.m-tech.ab.ca/psynch/index.html]
and NSGINA
[http://www.dcs.qmw.ac.uk/~williams/]
which seems a bit of work to setup...
<p>
I'm not really looking for passwd syncronisation, i'd like to
consolidate it to the linux box, because the users use both linux/95/nt.

Subject: Help for trival problems
<p>
I notice that a lot of people write the Gazette with fairly trivial
problems that are difficult to solve via non-interactive media
(email).  I'd like to remind some and inform others of the Linux
Internet Support Cooperative.  An excerpt from the LISC home page
(http://www.linpeople.org) says: 
<p>
"Since 1994, a small and somewhat foolish group of Linux system users
and administrators have been giving free technical support for Linux
under the name LinPeople, on Internet Relay Chat (IRC). With Linux
being a free operating system, it only seemed appropriate to provide a
free means of supporting it.Since 1994, a small and somewhat foolish
group of Linux system users and administrators have been giving free
technical support for Linux under the name LinPeople, on Internet
Relay Chat (IRC). With Linux being a free operating system, it only

<p>
It sometimes seems to linux users with problems that no one is
interested in helping them.  They post to news and don't get a reply,
they send email to the Gazette and feel ignored.  When you have a
problem, especially if you suspect that others might have the same,
try LISC.  With most internet-connected Linux boxen, it's just a
matter of typing:
<p>
ircii irc.linpeople.org
/join #linpeople
<p>
and then asking the question.
<p>
The people at LISC will do what they can to solve your problem,
teaching you about Linux at the same time.

<p>
Using WinNT at work, I discovered this fabulous browser called Opera.
It's the fastest web browser I've ever used, including Lynx, but has most
of the features I want from Netscape.  Also, it's fairly small -- right
now, my Opera process is under 5000K, even though it has six fairly heavy
web-pages open, and the download size just grew over one megabyte.
<p>
They're doing this funky pledge-drive thing where they ask people to
promise to buy copies of Opera for $35 for other platforms -- Mac, Be,
OS/2, and Linux -- before they've started developing Opera for those
platforms.  They say they haven't gotten much support from the Linux
community -- perhaps it's because not many people have heard of them?

Subject: Troff/Tex debate
<p>
I read Andrew Young's (aty@mintaka.sdsu.edu) letter in December,
then read Larry Ayers Issue 22 column...
<p>
I take issue with two of Larry's statements:
"Groff is the epitome of the non-user-friendly and cryptic unix
command-line tool."
Larry also says:
"Learning to use Groff on a Linux system might be an uphill battle, though Linux software developers must have
learned enough of it at one time or other, as most programs come with Groff-tagged man-page files. Groff's
apparent opacity and difficulty make LaTeX look easy in contrast!"
<p>
I'm not sure LaTeX is an improvement in these areas.  I've used troff 
for over 10 years and recently started to use LaTeX
(in fact, many
times LaTeX is far more obscure then troff).  And there are a
few features in LaTeX I miss (like:
<pre>
.sy stat \n(.F | fgrep Change >change.time
.so change.time
.sy rm change.time
</pre>
to get the document time into the document (as opposed to the "TeX"
time, or having to manually change the date, which is invariably wrong.
I have a makefile which puts this in a file, then includes the file)
<p>
The biggest problem is the lack of reference materials for troff.
I've used Unix Text Processing (Dougherty/O'Reilly) which
Andrew mentions...I've never seen or heard of the other book...
<p>
There are some references for troff/pic/indexing tools on:
http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr.html (including the one mentioned later)
There are also good papers on troff in:
4.4BSD User's Supplementary Documents (I'm not sure
which ones can be redistributed and which ones are only in the 
book).
<p>
FYI, from Eric Raymond's online jargon file:
:troff:: /T'rof/ or /trof/ /n./   [Unix] The gray
eminence of Unix text processing; a formatting and phototypesetting
program, written originally in PDP-11 assembler and then in
barely-structured early C by the late Joseph Ossanna, modeled after
the earlier ROFF which was in turn modeled after Multics' RUNOFF by
Jerome Saltzer (*that* name came from the expression "to run
off a copy").  A companion program, {nroff}, formats output for
terminals and line printers.
<p>
In 1979, Brian Kernighan modified troff so that it could drive
phototypesetters other than the Graphic Systems CAT.  His paper
describing that work ("A Typesetter-independent troff," AT&T CSTR
#97) explains troff's durability.  After discussing the program's
"obvious deficiencies -- a rebarbative input syntax, mysterious
and undocumented properties in some areas, and a voracious appetite
for computer resources" and noting the ugliness and extreme
hairiness of the code and internals, Kernighan concludes:
<p>
<blockquote>
None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating Ossanna's
accomplishment with TROFF.  It has proven a remarkably robust
tool, taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of preprocessors
and being forced into uses that were never conceived of in the
original design, all with considerable grace under fire.
</blockquote>
The success of {{TeX}} and desktop publishing systems have
reduced `troff''s relative importance, but this tribute
perfectly captures the strengths that secured `troff' a place
in hacker folklore; indeed, it could be taken more generally as an
indication of those qualities of good programs that, in the long
run, hackers most admire.

Subject: Linux Gazette/GNU/Linux Benchmarking
<p>
A recent <i>LG</i> article by Andr&eacute Balsa on benchmarking provided interesting material to me.
<p>
Having a little experience with benchmarks myself (some of it while
checking optimizing efforts myself on a compiler) I have found
that caching on Intel CPUs can significantly distort results.
In the first part you mention that caching can be disabled via
the BIOS setup. If you write your own benchmarks (or have the source),
you could also consider using the pertaining CPU instructions, easily
inserted using gcc's _asm_. This could be used to keep caching up while
running the code you want to measure and to flush between cycles, in
order
not to "carry over" a cache bonus from the previous iteration.
