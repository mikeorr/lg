Suzie is totally white (don't let shadows in the pictures fool you)
with long hair except along the back where it is growing out after being
shaved a while back, and she wears a collar with a 
rabies tag from a vet in Shelton. Suzie is a very friendly Samoyed, and
became lost while visiting in Seattle.
