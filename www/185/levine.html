<h1>Ubuntu, the cloud OS</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/levine.html">Neil Levine</a></b></p>


<p> We made a small flurry of announcements recently, all of which were
related to cloud computing. I think it is worthwhile to put some context
around Ubuntu and the cloud and explain a little more about where we are
with this critical strategic strand for our beloved OS.  </p>

<p>
First of all, the announcements. We announced the release of Ubuntu
Enterprise Cloud on Dell servers.  This is a hugely significant advance in
the realm of internal cloud provision. It's essentially formalising a lot of
the bespoke work that Dell has done in huge data centres (based on a variety
of OSes) and making similar technology available for smaller deployments. We
attended the Dell sales summit  in Las Vegas and we were very encouraged to
meet with many of the Dell salespeople whose job it will be to deliver this
to their customers. This is a big company, backing a leading technology and
encouraging businesses to start their investigations of cloud computing in a
very real way.
</p>

<p>
More or less simultaneously, we announced our formal support for the
OpenStack project and the inclusion of their Bexar release in our next
version of Ubuntu, 11.04. This will be in addition to Eucalyptus, it is
worth stating. Eucalyptus is the technology at the core of UEC - and will be
in Ubuntu 11.04 - as it has been since 9.04. Including two stacks has caused
some raised eyebrows but it is not an unusual position for Ubuntu. While we
look to pick one technology for integration into the platform in order to
deliver the best user experience possible, we also want to make sure that
users have access to the best and most up to date free and open-source
software. The increasing speed of innovation that cloud computing is driving
has meant that Ubuntu, with its 6 month release cadence, is able to deliver
the tools and programs that developers and admins want before any other
operating system.
</p>

<p>
Users will ultimately decide what deployment scenarios each stack best
suits. Eucalyptus certainly has the advantage of maturity right now,
especially for internal cloud deployments. OpenStack, meanwhile, continue to
focus on rapid feature development and, given its heritage, has appeal to
service providers looking to stand up their own public clouds. Wherever the
technology is deployed, be it in the enterprise or for public clouds, we
want Ubuntu to be the underlying infrastructure for all the scenarios and
will continue to direct our platform team to deliver the most tightly
integrated solution possible.
</p>

<p>
Finally we saw our partner, Autonomic Resources announce UEC is now
available for purchase by Federal US government buyers. This is the first
step on a long road the federal deployment, as anyone familiar with the
governmental buying cycles will realise. But it is a good example of the
built-to-purpose cloud environments that we will see more of - with the
common denominator of Ubuntu at the core of it.
</p>

<p>
Which actually raises an interesting question - why is it that Ubuntu is at
the heart of cloud computing? Perhaps we ought to look at more evidence
before the theory. In addition to being the OS at the heart of new cloud
infrastructures, we are seeing enormous usage of Ubuntu as the guest OS on
the big public clouds, such as AWS and Rackspace, for instance. It is
probably the most popular OS on those environments and others - contact your
vendor to confirm :-)
</p>

<p>
So why is this OS that most incumbent vendors would dismiss as fringe,
seeing such popularity in this new(ish) wave of computing? Well there are a
host of technical reasons to do with modularity, footprint, image
maintenance etc. But they are better expressed by others.
</p>

<p>
I think the reason for Ubuntu's prominence is because it is innovation made
easy. Getting on and doing things on Ubuntu is a friction-free experience.
We meet more and more tech entrepreneurs who tell us how they have built
more than one business on Ubuntu on the cloud. Removing licence costs and
restrictions allows people to get to the market quickly.
</p>

<p>
But beyond speed, it is also about reducing risk. With open-source now
firmly established in the IT industry, and with the term open used so
promiscuously, it is easy to forget that the economic benefits of truly
free, open-source software. The combination of cloud computing, where scale
matters, and open source is a natural one and this is why Ubuntu is the
answer for those who need the reassurance that they can both scale quickly
but also avoid vendor lock-in in the long-term.
</p> 

<p>
More specifically, and this brings us back to the announcements, there are
now clear scenarios where users can reach a point where even the economics
of a licence-free software on a public cloud start to break down. At a
certain stage it is simply cheaper to make the hardware investment to run
your own cloud infrastructure. Or there might be regulatory, cultural or a
host of other reasons for wanting cloud-like efficiencies built on internal
servers.
</p> 

<p>
The work we have done with OpenStack and with Eucalyptus means Ubuntu is an
ideal infrastructure on which to build a cloud. This will typically be for
the internal provision of a cloud environment but equally could be the basis
or a new public cloud. It is entirely open as to the type of guest OS and in
all cases continues to support the dominant API of Amazon EC2, ensuring
portability for those writing applications.
</p>

<p>
And as we have seen, Ubuntu is the ultimate OS to deploy in a cloud and with
which to build a cloud. No-one provides more up-to-date images on the most
popular public cloud platforms. Our work to ensure compatibility to the most
popular standards means that those guests will run just as well on a UEC
cloud however that is deployed  - either internally or for cloud provision
externally.
</p>

<p>
So technology moves markets. Economics does too, only more so. Ubuntu has
come at the right point in our short IT history to ride both waves. The
scale is there, the standards are emerging and the ability to provide an
answer to the choice between running a cloud or running on a cloud is more
fully realised on Ubuntu than on any other OS - open source or not.
