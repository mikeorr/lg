<p>
Anyone with an email address can expect to receive attachments in a
multitude of formats.  Unfortunately, some formats cannot be read
using free software.  This is especially true if our email buddies are
still involved in the arguably risky practice of using proprietary
programs in conjunction with their email readers.

<p>
Many free software advocates adopt a policy of ignoring all email with
attachments dependent on closed source software, opting instead to
lecture the sender on the importance of open standards.  Others may
not like missing out on the fun to be had from attachments being
forwarded amongst their peers.  If you find yourself in this
situation, the techniques outlined in this article may serve as a
partial solution.

<p>
There is not much a Linux user can do if the entire contents of an
attachment are encoded using a jealously guarded secret algorithm.
Very often however, the problematic file is merely a thin proprietary
envelope enclosing a loose collection of data objects that use
well-known encoding standards.  For instance, some MS Word documents
being forwarded around the Net contain ordinary JPG and PNG images
embedded within the file.  If we can find a way to remove the
envelope, reading these enclosed files would be a straight forward
matter.  The following sections describe how this can be accomplished
using a little <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> scripting
together with a few image viewing and manipulation tools available on
most Linux distributions.

<h3>Extracting the text</h3>

<p>Before tackling the problem of the embedded images we can easily
view any readable text using the <tt>strings</tt> utility:

<br><br><pre>
strings proprietary.file | less
</pre><br>

This will output any strings of at least 4 bytes in length that
consist of readable ASCII characters.  Naturally, a lot more than just
intelligible sentences will be returned.  Most will be junk, but the
readable text is easily spotted.  The <tt>strings</tt> tools will also
pick up the readable header information within the embedded images
themselves.  JPEG files contain the string &quot;JFIF&quot; in the
header.  This gives us a quick way to check what types of images a
file may contain, and gives an indication of how many there are.

<br><br><pre>
strings proprietary.file | grep JFIF
strings -n 3 proprietary.file | grep PNG
strings proprietary.file | grep GIF8
</pre><br>

The <tt>-n 3</tt> allows us to detect readable strings as short as 3
characters.  Not every occurrence of &quot;JFIF&quot; is necessarily a
JPEG image since the document itself may have mentioned JFIF in a
paragraph of text -- though this is rare among the email attachments
most commonly forwarded.

<h3>Locating the images</h3>

<p>We need to find where exactly each image is located within the
file.  A little Python will help to find possible embedded images and
report their positions as a byte offset:

<br><br><pre>
from string import find

#read in proprietary data
fh = open( "proprietary.file" )
dat = fh.read()
fh.close()

#search for JFIF
x = -1
while 1:
    x = find(dat,"JFIF",x+1)
    if x&lt;0: break
    #file actually started 6 bytes earlier
    print x - 6
</pre><br>

This will find the byte offsets of every embedded JPEG file though not
every offset is guaranteed to be for a valid file.  This can easily be
extended to handle GIF and PNG images: 

<br><br>
<a href="misc/chung/find-embedded-images.txt">Listing 1</a>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
from string import find
from sys import argv

headers = [("GIF8",0), ("PNG",1), ("JFIF",6)]
filepath = "proprietary.file"
if len(argv)&gt;1: filepath = argv[1]

fh = open(filepath )
dat = fh.read()
fh.close()

for kw,off in headers:
    x = 0
    while 1:
        x = find(dat,kw,x+1)
        if x&lt;0: break
        print kw,"file begins at byte",x - off
</pre><br>

Note that the image file begins a few bytes before the
&quot;PNG&quot; or &quot;JFIF&quot; string.

<h3>Displaying the images</h3>

<p>
Now that we know where each image is likely to start how do we display
them?  ImageMagick's <tt>display</tt> utility can help here.  Suppose
our proprietary file contains a JPEG image beginning at byte 1000.
Using <tt>tail</tt> to remove all the bytes that preceed it and pipe
the rest to <tt>display</tt>.

<br><br><pre>
tail -c +1001 proprietary.file | display -
</pre><br>

Note that <tt>tail -c</tt> begins counting bytes at 1.  In case we
have many dozens of embedded image files we can adapt our previous
Python script to automate the
process.

<br><br><a href="misc/chung/show-embedded-images.txt">Listing 2</a>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
from string import find
from sys import argv
from os import system

headers = [("GIF8",0), ("PNG",1), ("JFIF",6)]
filepath = "proprietary.file"
if len(argv)&gt;1: filepath = argv[1]

fh = open(filepath )
dat = fh.read()
fh.close()

for kw,off in headers:
    x = 0
    while 1:
        x = find(dat,kw,x+1)
        if x&lt;0: break
        system("tail -c +%d %s | display -" % (x - off + 1, filepath))
</pre>

<h3>Extracting each image file</h3>

<p>ImageMagick throws away any excess data fed to it after reading to
the end of the image segment.  If we want to separate the image data
completely for storage as individual files, we also need to find the
end of each image.  One way to do this is to use a modified binary chop
algorithm.

<br><br><a href="misc/chung/get-embedded-image-files.txt">Listing 3</a>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/python
from string import find
from sys import argv
from commands import getstatusoutput

headers = [("GIF8",0,"giftopnm","gif"), ("PNG",1,"pngtopnm","png"),
           ("JFIF",6,"djpeg","jpg")]
filepath = "proprietary.file"
if len(argv)&gt;1: filepath = argv[1]

fh = open(filepath )
dat = fh.read()
fh.close()

inum = 0
for kw,off,conv,ext in headers:
    x = -1
    while 1:
        x = find(dat,kw,x+1)
        if x&lt;0: break
        beg = x - off
        #possible image located -- find end by binary chop
	s1 = len(dat) - x
	s0 = 1
        sz = s1
	while s0&lt;s1:
	    (stat,output) = getstatusoutput("tail -c +%d %s | head -c %d | %s &gt;/dev/null" % (beg + 1, filepath, sz, conv))
	    if stat:
                #failed -- possibly too small
                if sz == s1:
                    #failed -- probably invalid data
                    print "failed... no image here"
                    break
                elif sz == s0:
                    #we've found the length -- write out image
                    imgname = "image%03d.%s" % (inum, ext)
                    print "writing",imgname
                    fh = open( imgname, "w")
                    fh.write(dat[beg :beg+s1])
                    fh.close()
                    inum = inum + 1
                    break
                s0 = sz
            else:
                #might be too big -- try smaller
                s1 = sz
            sz = int((s0+s1)/2)


</pre><br>

One can make use of image decoding utilities
<tt>giftopnm</tt>, <tt>djpeg</tt>, and <tt>pngtopnm</tt> to locate the
end of the file.  Like <tt>display</tt> these tools discard excess
input data after the end of the image file and with terminate without
error.  If however they are given truncated image data they will
report an error and terminate unsuccessfully.  The Python script feeds
image data of varying lengths to the decoding tool and its completion
status is used to home into the correct length of the required file.


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This article has shown how to write scripts that extract data
objects, encoded using platform-independent open standards, from
within proprietary files.  It should be a simple task to extend these
scripts for handling other image formats and even other types of data
objects, such as sound and music files.  Note that there are many file
formats that frustrate the techniques described here via a layer of
simple encryption and/or obfuscation.

<p>
Even if one has access to the appropriate proprietary application for
reading a particular email attachment, the scripts outlined above can
be useful for avoiding any possible macro viruses or security exploits
specific to that application.

<p>
And finally a word of warning.  The legislature of some countries have
vaguely worded laws that can be interpreted in such a way that these
scripts may be considered as illegal copyright circumvention devices.
This may or may not be relevant to you depending on the country where
you reside.  As is always the case when mixing open and closed source
systems, your mileage may vary.
