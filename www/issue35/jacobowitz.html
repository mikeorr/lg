<P> <HR> <P>  
Once again the mega-computer show known as Comdex
(<A HREF="http://www.comdex.com/">http://www.comdex.com/</A>) took over Las Vegas, Nevada, this past November
15 through 20th.  On hand to represent the Linux community were 12
vendors who made up this year's Linux Pavilion: Linux Journal, Red Hat,
S.u.S.E., Caldera, VA Research, Linux Hardware Solutions, Linux
International, InfoMagic, Enhanced Software Technologies, Turbo Linux,
Interix and ApplixWare.  Special Linux-related events included the
presentation of the first annual Linux Journal Editor's Choice Awards by
our esteemed editor, Marjorie Richardson.
<P>
As usual, there were throngs of corporate buyers, sellers and interested
onlookers from nearly every nation on hand for the event.  Hundreds of
exhibits, from small, quiet displays of software to a real high-wire
balancing act performed above the crowd, entertained and informed
visitors.
<P>
But there are several factors that set the recent Comdex apart from
years past.  Number one, there was a noticeable drop-off in business
attendance.  Several major corporations, including Netscape and Intel,
either did not show up at all or rented small meeting spaces rather than
building booths.  Mirroring the corporate no-shows was the precipitous
decline in individual attendance.  The missing visitors were readily
noticed -- taxi lines were shorter, hotel rooms were easily secured,
etc.
<P>
What makes Comdex 1998 stand out even more is the dramatic increase in
the amount of attention that was received by Linux.  Not only was the
Linux Pavilion packed from the opening on Monday until the close on
Friday, but other exhibitors had more to say about Linux during the
course of the show.
<P>
Evidence was everywhere that Linux is reaching past the IT departments
at major corporations and getting the attention of management and other
non-technical decision makers.  This in turn meant that press attention
was focused on Linux as never before.  Several vendors in the Linux
Pavilion were interviewed for a local TV news segment, while most major
computer oriented print outlets made at least some mention of the Linux
presence at Comdex.
<P>
Even more impressive were the numbers of average computer users who
approached vendors at the Linux Pavilion with an open mind and lots of
questions ... and then walked away with a distribution CD! Linux
International was distributing several different CD-ROMs and asking for
a $1 donation.  They "sold out" of CDs quite quickly, and were
eventually rescued by the generosity of S.u.S.E.  As a result of the
efforts of LI and the rest of the Linux Pavilion, there are now perhaps
as many as several thousand new Linux users.
<P>
So, what does Comdex 1998 mean for the future of Linux?  Well, based on
my experience there and the people I spoke to, I believe we can expect
several of the following events, if not all, to occur between now and
the turn of the century:
<ul>
<li>Far more major companies will be porting their software to Linux.  At
Comdex, I was approached by many programmers and marketing types alike
who were sent to the Pavilion to assess the potential for porting their
wares to Linux.  Look for a few surprises to come up in the next year;
rumors were flying about various vendors currently alpha testing their
products for Linux.

<li>Even more hardware will be sold with native Linux drivers available,
especially in the field of RAID controllers, now that Oracle is ported
to Linux.  Again, I spoke to many programmers sent by hardware vendors
to seek out counsel and advice on writing drivers for Linux.

<li>Linux will continue to grow in appeal to "end-user" types who are fed
up with the inadequacies of proprietary, closed-source Operating
Systems.  Many a newcomer was exposed to Linux at Comdex; many of them
will wind up long-term users.  Look for this to emerge as a trend.

<li>Major vendors will consider their Linux ventures to be a major
strategic business move, not merely a sideline venture.  At Comdex, many
of Oracle's major announcements centered around their support for Linux
and role of Linux in it's future.  Look for more companies to expand
into Linux in some capacity and proudly advertise and publicize those
moves, rather than burying the Linux news under other announcements.

<li>Linux-specific skills will become a hot resume item for programmers,
system administraters, and other techie types in the job market.  Many
professionals from several different organizations asked me for personal
assistance in helping them locate Linux-savvy professionals for their
personnel pools; one of my friends now has a lucrative job with someone
I met briefly at Comdex.

<li>Linux will continue to improve, while certain major Operating Systems
will see no such improvement, even as major new releases are published. 
Yes, this is an opinionated prognostication, but there is evidence to
support such an assertion: few vendors at Comdex 1998 had anything "new"
or dramatically improved to show.  Their plight is not going to change
overnight, no matter what kind of marketing hype surrounds their
upcoming releases.
</ul>
In all fairness, there are some negative interpretations of the
attention Linux received at Comdex.  For one, the strong press attention
could be somewhat explained by the very point made in the previous
paragraph: because the big vendors like Microsoft didn't have any new
mind-boggling toys to show off, the press had to look for news where it
could find it.  Linux was the biggest new thing to talk about.  Plus,
with attendance off and fewer vendors on hand, visitors had to look
harder to find anything interesting to see at the show; it's possible
they may not have come down to see us had their been more going on at
the other Comdex venues.
<P>
Yet the reception received by Linux vendors and enthusiasts at Comdex
1998 can only be described as overwhelmingly positive.  As a final bit
of evidence to support that claim, let me relate the following personal
anecdote ...
<P>
On the flight down to Las Vegas from Seattle, it was my pleasure to sit
next to a Vice President from Microsoft.  This gentleman was a pleasure
to speak with about Microsoft, Open Source software and Linux.  He was
filled not with judgment and disdain, but genuine interest and
thoughtful questions about what free software and Linux mean for the
future of computing.  Not only that, but he did assert that while
companies like Microsoft are in business to make money, he himself is
very interested in learning more about Linux and other free software. 
He said that many of his colleagues and contemporaries all over the
business spectrum are equally intrigued.  Something tells me his
attitude is not unique ... Linux and Free/Open Source Software are
poised to take a remarkable position in the future of computing and
technology.
<P>
With all of these facts taken into consideration, there is one logical
conclusion: Comdex 1998 was one more step on Linux's way to complete
world domination.
