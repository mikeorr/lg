Whenever there's new content at LinuxFocus or GnomeJournal, we link to
their articles by creating an "insert" on that issue's front page (see
SVN_ROOT/data/toc/130-index.html for an example.) However, there are months
when neither one publishes anything new. We need someone to research other
monthly Linux publications and perhaps create some scripting (currently,
the content is added manually) to build the insert.

Time commitment:
    A couple hours per month at least
