<h1>Speed Compiling with Distcc</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/simpson.html">V. L. Simpson</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When was the last time you compiled a linux kernel?

<p> Yesterday?  Last week? Five minutes ago?

<p>On a 486?

<p>I don't remember either.  

<p>Remember how long it took?

<p>I remember that.  Too long.  Too damn long.

<p>Now why would I want to compile the latest kernel on a 486?

<p>Ordinarily, I wouldn't. But with the tragic death of my main
computer I was forced to move my computing needs to an old 486 someone
had given me.  I had been using this one as a NTP time server for my
home network.  Suffice it to say, what was on the NTP server wasn't the
latest and the greatest.  The other computer on the network wasn't
much of an improvement over the 486. (A foundling laptop with a
miniscule hard drive.)

<p>Well I was screwed because I needed my 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a>.  So I
pulled the drive from the dead computer and hooked it up to the 486.

<p>It worked flawlessly, which is a testament to the Linux kernel
and GNU Software quality and efficiency.  I didn't really know what to
expect regarding response and the general feel of the environment, but in
console mode I noticed no real difference.  The X window system even
worked fine, albeit slow on the start-up.  Now, there was no way the
GIMP or Mozilla was going to run with any kind of usability, but I
could use Emacs and <a href="http://lynx.isc.org/">lynx</a> or <a
href="http://www.dillo.org/">dillo</a> without too many problems.

<p>But did I really want to sit through something that was going to
take a few hours at least?  Not really. I guess I could have washed
dishes, mowed the lawn or watched TV but, hey, TV sucks. I'd rather
watch a kernel compile.

<p>Enter the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/osa/awards.php">
award-winning</a> distcc, a distributed compiler front end for gcc,
written by Martin Poole.

<h2>Distcc</h2>

<p><a href="http://distcc.samba.org/">Distcc</a> consists of two binary
programs:  <code>distccd</code> and <code>distcc</code>.

<p><code>distccd</code> runs as a daemon and handles network traffic.  By
passing pre-processed source code files across a network to other computers
with an installed compiler, you effectively have two or more
compilations going at once.

<p><code>distcc</code> is a front end to <code>gcc</code> and
<code>g++</code>.  You specify <code>distcc</code> as the compiler in place
of <code>gcc</code> and it transparently handles all the magic that is
going on.  <code>distcc</code> can be used for all compile jobs whether you
need the networking capabilities or not, i.e., you can compile one file or
thousands, it's up to you.

<p>The easiest way to demonstrate <code>distcc</code>'s abilities is to use
it to compile itself as an example of distributed compilation.

<p>I'll show how to compile <code>distcc</code> and give my time for the
initial compilation, then recompile using <code>distcc</code> in place of
<code>gcc</code>.

<p>Minimum Requirements:

<p>Two compatible networked computers designated as a server and a client.

<p>The server:<br>
This machine should have a complete C/C++ development
environment installed.  You'll also need any other ancillary
development packages (readline, ncurses, gtk+, whatever) that your
particular bit of software needs for compiling.

<p><code>distcc</code> itself requires nothing special.

<p>Note: There are a couple of other programs produced by
<code>distcc</code>:
<code>distccmon-text</code> and <code>distccmon-gnome</code>.

<p>These are monitor programs to show you what's happening during a
<code>distcc</code> compile session.  The *-gnome version needs GTK at a
minimum but if you don't have it installed, don't worry.

<p>The client:<br>
This machine only needs the compilers installed.  You do
not need libc, ncurses, kernel headers or the infinite array of
libraries things seem to need nowadays to compile.

<p><code>distcc</code> source code available here:<br>
<a href="http://distcc.samba.org/download.html">distcc source code.</a>

<p>Building <code>distcc</code>, the first run:

<p>Standard Operating Procedure: 

<pre>$ tar -jxvf distcc*</pre> (use j flag not z with tar, distcc is bzip2ed).

<pre>
$ cd distcc*
$ ./configure
$ time make 
</pre>
(don't forget the time command).

<p><code>distcc</code> is small and doesn't require much time to build.
Here's the time from that aforementioned 486DX:

<p>
<pre>
     Without <code>distcc</code> 
     real    13m45.185s
     user    12m4.320s
     sys     1m7.120s
</pre>

<p>It took longer to run the configure script than it did to compile.

<p>Install the binaries:
<pre>
make install
</pre>
<code>distcc</code> and <code>distccd</code> should be in /usr/local/bin

<p>For the client machine:
Transfer a copy of <code>distccd</code> to /usr/local/bin or your binary repository
of choice.

<p>Now to use <code>distcc</code> to recompile <code>distcc</code>.  

<p>Make sure you are in the <code>distcc</code> source directory
<pre>
$ make clean
</pre>

<p>This will clean out all the crud leftover from the first compile.
You won't need to run configure again.

<p>We need to spend a couple of minutes setting up for <code>distcc</code>.

<p>
1.  Run the <code>distccd</code> daemon on both computers.
<pre>
$ distccd --daemon
</pre>

<p>It'll bitch about no <code>distcc</code> user. Ignore the warning.<br>
You can check to see that it's actually running via "<tt>$ ps -ax | grep
distccd</tt>" to assuage your concerns.

<p>2.  Set the <code>DISTCC_HOSTS</code> environment variable:

<p>You can use IP addresses or if your /etc/hosts file is set-up properly
the hostnames of the computers.

<p>I have two computers at the moment:<br>
mothra on 192.168.1.2<br>
ghidra on 192.168.1.3  (This one's a rescued 120MHz laptop. It would
be my main computer but it doesn't have the drive space I need.)

<p>Set the variable (sh syntax, adjust for your shell):

<pre>
$ export DISTCC_HOSTS="mothra ghidra"

or

$ export DISTCC_HOSTS="192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3"
</pre>

<p>Either way it doesn't matter.<br>
NOTE: Names or addresses are space delimited.

<p>Recompile the code:<br>

<pre>
$ time make -j4 CC=distcc
</pre>

<p>Explaining the command line:

<p>time:  should be obvious.<br>

<p>make -j4:<br>
the -j flag is <code>make</code>'s "multiple command" flag.  Read the
info manual for more specific information.  Trust me, just use -j4
for now.

<p>CC=distcc:<br>
Override configured compiler directive.  This way you can
do a regular configure with <code>gcc</code> defined in the makefile.
<code>distcc</code> is nice about not forcing complicated procedures to use
it.

<p>

<pre>distcc compiled with distcc
     real    6m38.089s
     user    2m42.200s
     sys     0m29.520s
</pre>

<p>Cut the time in half!  You can't complain about that.

<p>The following shows times for some of my favorite programs compiled with
and without <code>distcc</code>, utilizing the two node setup describe above.

<p>Remember, I'm compiling with a 486 without <code>distcc</code>.

<p>
<pre>                     		  
     <a href="http://www.dillo.org/">Dillo Web Browser</a><br>
     Without Distcc         With Distcc
     real    52m14.120s     real    22m31.975s	  
     user    47m24.820s     user    5m12.630s 	              
     sys     3m29.220s      sys     1m23.930s 
</pre>

<p>
<pre>
     <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">The BASH Shell</a><br>
     Without Distcc       With Distcc	   
     real    75m25.306s   real    18m22.613s 
     user    69m2.110s    user    3m27.950s  
     sys     5m8.030s     sys     0m58.980s  
</pre>

<p>This was the most amazing for me. This is 1/4 of the
non-<code>distcc</code> compilation time!

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p><code>distcc</code> is flexible.  You can use it as a one-shot compiler
or set-up your build environment to use it for all compiles.

<p>You can define the available compiler hosts in a
<tt>$HOME/.distcc/hosts</tt> file.

<p>You can force <code>distcc</code> to prefer one machine over another by listing the
order in the <tt>.distcc/hosts</tt> or <code>DISTCC_HOSTS</code> environment variable.

<p>For example, rather than having my poor little 486 desktop grind down
to an almost unusable state as <code>gcc</code> takes over the system, I set 
<tt>DISTCC_HOSTS='ghidra'</tt> and all the compilation is shipped to the faster 
laptop.

<p>More documentation is at the 
<a href="http://distcc.samba.org/doc.html">distcc web site</a>.

<p>Oh, yeah - that kernel compile.  How long did it take?  I don't
know.  I said screw it, I'll just stick with the stock kernel from my
Slackware install.  Even with <code>distcc</code> it would take forever.
Maybe I'll bite the bullet at some point - but I think I'll just save up
for that dual processor Athlon system I've been coveting.
