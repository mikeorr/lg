I need to find a way to print to specific forms, such as checks,
invoices, etc.  Whenever my accounting people get ready to print out checks,
it never fails that someone will send a print-job to the printer.  It will
then be printed on the checks instead of normal paper.  Is there a way to
accomplish this through LP... from what I've tried, read, and heard... I've
had NO LUCK!

In the Bad Old Days of twenty different pre-printed forms on the
shelf, everybody's mini-mainframe had forms management built in
to the OS.  It didn't seem so awful to us then.  It certainly
beat spending umpteen thousands of dollars a month to lease
twenty different printers, most of them seldom used, from IBM.
Not to mention the impact of the 3' by 4' by 4' form factor!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you were printing more than one pre-printed form, say, checks
drawn against five different accounts, each once a month, having
five dedicated printers sitting idle most of the time, and a sixth
for everyday use, would seem maybe just a little wastful of
the equipment budget.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>1. Construct a scripted front end to help you handle it:

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

This one begs for a forms management interface program.
With a long-running interface program on the system console that
would display, for example,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ul>
<li>On printer laz insert form "company 1 checks" and hit ENTER
<li>[ prints check job after ENTER ]
<li>
On printer laz insert form "plain letter-size paper" and hit ENTER
<li>
[ prints the plain paper job ]
</ol></BLOCKQUOTE>

If the console's next to the printer, there's no additional work

control user, who would normally be logged into some terminal
near the printer.  It would assume some default form at its
startup time, and merrily release print jobs so long as they
call for the available form, holding the print queue when
the next job up calls for a form that is not currently
inserted.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm unaware of anything quite so friendly for Linux
forms handling.  Instead, as you've observed, we have lpd.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Have you investigated using the lpc command for this?  By
doing
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><blockquote><code>
lpc
<br>holdall laz
</code></blockquote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
[ run the check job ]
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
lpq
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><blockquote>
[ lists print jobs held.  Figure out which one
is your check-printing batch. ]
</blockquote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><blockquote><code>
release jobid
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE> <BLOCKQUOTE>
[ releases the job with id "jobid" for printing ]
</BLOCKQUOTE> </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
release laz
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE>
[ releases all remaining jobs, after special forms
jobs are finished ]
</BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You'd have to set up sudo to allow selected users to
run lpc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>2. Try to use the queues feature built into lpr:
</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [JimD]
The classic approach to this problem is to create additional
queues on that printer.  When you mount a form on a given printer,
you use your printer system's control utility (lpc under Linux)
you stop printing of all queues, and enable printing of just the
one that relates to the currently mounted form.  After, you
dismount the special paper (checks, pre-printed forms, etc) you
stop the form queue and start the general queue(s).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
        HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Dan]
ff printcap entry "check"
has the autohold flag ":ah:" in it, so
jobs sent to it are normally held.  After running checks
using
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
lpr -Pcheck
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
you'd use lpc:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
lpc
<BR>holdall laz
<BR>[ wait until printing on "laz" stops, then change forms ]
<BR>release check
<BR>[ or 'lpq' then 'release jobid' ]
<BR>[ wait until check printing stops ]
<BR>holdall check
<BR>release laz
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This saves having to guess which jobs are checks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [JimD]
Note that you can stop printing of a queue without disabling
submissions to it.  Thus your other printing traffic will continue
to queue up while the special forms are loaded.  When you reload
the normal paper, the other jobs will all get printed as normal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Dan]
With the ":ah:" flag, you might not need to "holdall check"
at the end; I'm not sure whether "release check" applies
only to jobs currently in the spool, or to future jobs also.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [JimD]
This is the whole reason why the BSD lpd supports multiple queues
connected to any printer.  It gives you some administrative
flexibility.  You can use it to support forms and special papers
(colors, sizes, etc).  You can also use it to (very roughly)
manage priorities (so you time critical monthly, quarterly, or
annual accounting jobs can be give abolute priority over other
printing traffic for a few days, for example).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of course you can use lpc in shell scripts to automate the
work of stopping and starting specific queues.

None of this is as easy as we'd like.  There are commercial packages
which purport to offer "friendlier" and "easier" interfaces to
printer management under Linux.  I've never used any of them, nor
have I played with CUPS or recent versions of LPRng.  I've just managed
to get by using the plain old BSD lpd, so far.

Have you been able to do this without getting "cannot open <TT>/dev/lp0</TT>"
errors?  (I don't remember the exact error message.)  I have two printers,
HP LJ 4L and Epson Stylus Color 600, which I switch back and forth on
the parallel port.  Sometimes I have to bring down the LPD daemon
entirely (or sometimes even reboot) in order to switch from one to the other.

>[Dan] The topic was multiple virtual printers on the same physical device.
It sounds like you're asking about multiple physical printers on the
same hardware port.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
        HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>[Mike]
He and I both have two "drivers"
(LPD stanzas) going to the same device.  The difference is that he has
one printer on the other side of the device, while I switch printers.
But it's not switching printers that causes the "device in use" error;
it also happens if I forget to switch the printers.  Thus, why it could
happen to Mr McClure too.  Apparently LPD (from LPRng) doesn't close
the device in a timely manner after finishing a print job, so that
another driver can use the same device.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"

I can probably concoct at least three other ways to do it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The disadvantage of "start check" is you must remember to
"stop check" when you're done.  By using the ":ah:" flag
you _might_ not have to remember one more step at the end.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Darned if I can see from the documentation what the functional
difference between "stop printer" and "holdall printer" is.
Both appear to allow queuing, while holding print.  "holdall"
doesn't appear to apply to current jobs, so the default
non-check printer might finish printing more stuff after
"holdall lp" (or whatever name is used for that printer)
than "stop lp".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So maybe the perfect sub-optimal solution is:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>lpc
stop lp
[ wait for current job to finish ]
[ insert check forms ]
start check
[ wait for checks to print ]
stop check
start lp
quit
</pre></blockquote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
or a setuid CGI that issues equivalent commands.

Hey, check it out, you can specify job classes, so you could actually
tell the single printer that it only has plain paper in it right now,
so hold all jobs that are of the check class.  I'm sure this can easily
be extended to letterhead or other special forms.  The tricky part is
to have your check runs properly register that they are of the "check"
class so this would work.
