<h1>Knoppix with 2.6.7 kernel from non-bootable CD-ROM</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</A></b></p>

<p>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>You want to start Knoppix and your CD-ROM cannot boot either for
technical or administrative reasons. You can try to start the
Knoppix CD from a floppy drive. For that you need a Knoppix boot
diskette.</p>

<p>The recent Knoppix 3.4 of May 2004 relies on kernel 2.4.x but has
kernel 2.6.6 as an option. Likewise, Knoppix 3.7 of August 20 has the
2.6.7 kernel as an option. This last release is - for the time being -
only available in Germany as a CD from a computer magazine.  However,
a general release, possibly with kernel 2.6.8, is coming and so it is
sensible to refer to the new kernel because its size is growing and
growing and causing diskette distress.</p>

<p>We will refer to the new Knoppix kernel as knoppix26 using the same
name as in the CD boot configuration. Unfortunately, knoppix26 does
not boot from one diskette, it needs two.</p>

<p>When running, knoppix26 has a script in</p>

<pre>
    /KNOPPPIX/usr/sbin/mkbootfloppy
</pre>

<p>that does make these two floppies - despite the singular 
name. However, the diskettes so generated depend on the kernel in
use. If you want them in order to be able to boot 2.6.x, you have
to write them while running 2.6.x - which is a bit of a catch-22.
Modifying the script is catch-22 again since the script is not
directly accessible on the Knoppix distribution CD and becomes only
readable when Knoppix is running. It can be found on the web in
editable form but making sensible use of it will be more laborious
than the advice found in this article, especially in respect to
kernel 2.6.7 which does not fit on a 1.4M diskette at all.</p>

<p>So if your CD-ROM will not boot, how are you going to boot
knoppix26 from the floppy drive?</p>

<h4>Pre-requisite</h4>

<p>You must have some familiarity with syslinux. Fortunately, it
can be acquired on the fly, check <a href=
"http://syslinux.zytor.com">http://syslinux.zytor.com</a>.</p>

<h4>Option 1</h4>

<p>Consider the following (chain) boot loaders:</p>

<pre>
    <a href=
"http://bootcd.narod.ru/bcdw150z_en.zip">http://bootcd.narod.ru/bcdw150z_en.zip</a>
    <a href=
"http://btmgr.sourceforge.net/download.html">http://btmgr.sourceforge.net/download.html</a>
</pre>

<p>Both of them can create a boot diskette that starts a (bootable)
CD even if the CD-ROM is unable to boot. In the particular case of
the Knoppix CD, the good news is that they both will boot it from a
non-bootable CD-ROM.</p>

<p>This is your friend if you want to minimize preliminary work.
Unfortunately, if you are not installing Knoppix to hard disk, you
may end up doing quite a lot of typing at the command line every
time you boot.</p>

<p>[Please do not misunderstand the remark above as a criticism of
the two boot loaders. They come in very handy in other situations
as well.]</p>

<h4>Option 2</h4>

<p>The biggest hurdle is the kernel size starting with release
2.6.7. In the 2.6.6 release, the Knoppix kernel would fit on a 1.4M
diskette. Now you need to format the diskette to 1.68M - the same
size Microsoft uses occasionally for its diskettes. For that purpose,
you can use <tt>winimage</tt> under Windows, <tt>fdformat</tt> under
DOS or <tt>superformat</tt>/<tt>fdformat</tt> under Linux. Good luck
to you because diskettes sold for the 1.4M capacity do not necessarily
agree to a flawless format at higher capacity. My experience is that you
need a box of ten to get one such tolerant diskette. If you want strict
verification, use <tt>winimage</tt> and you will see the massacre.</p>

<p>When you have formatted the diskette, make it a syslinux boot
diskette. This can be done from DOS, Windows, Linux - it's up to
you. No further help is offered here for it. This boot diskette
will contain only one small file, <tt>ldlinux.sys</tt>.</p>

<p>In the Knoppix CD 3.7, there is a directory <tt>/boot/isolinux</tt>
where you will find the following files among others:</p>

<pre>
    boot.msg              141
    f2                  1,561
    f3                  1,688
    isolinux.cfg        2,642
    linux26         1,458,194
    minirt26.gz       791,321
</pre>

<p>Copy everything but the last file to the syslinux diskette
above. Rename <tt>isolinux.cfg</tt> to <tt>syslinux.cfg</tt> and edit
it as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
DEFAULT knoppix26
TIMEOUT 300
PROMPT 1
DISPLAY boot.msg
F2 f2
F3 f3
LABEL knoppix26
KERNEL linux26
APPEND load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1 root=/dev/fd0 rw init=/etc/init lang=us apm=power-off nomce BOOT_IMAGE=knoppix
LABEL expert26
KERNEL linux26
APPEND load_ramdisk=1 prompt_ramdisk=1 root=/dev/fd0 rw init=/etc/init lang=us apm=power-off nomce BOOT_IMAGE=expert
</pre>

<p>This is now a boot diskette for the 2.6.x kernel, the initial
ramdisk being read from a second diskette. Type <tt>knoppix26</tt> at the
boot prompt. It will quickly ask you to insert the second diskette
so you must have it ready.</p>

<p>The second diskette must be a raw copy of <tt>minirt26.gz</tt>. Which
is to say, you cannot format it with a file system and put
<tt>minirt26.gz</tt> into the file system. When syslinux reads the
diskette it expects the binary content of <tt>minirt26.gz</tt> and
nothing else. It won't assume a file system and look for a file in it.</p>

<p>The question is: how do you copy the file raw to the floppy?
Here is the command (run under Linux from the Knoppix CD,
<tt>/boot/isolinux</tt> directory):</p>

<pre>
    dd if=minirt26.gz of=/dev/fd0 bs=18k
</pre>

<p>The bs value is not essential, it just determines the size of
portions read and written. (A high-density 3.5" diskette has a
track of 18k.) The floppy may or may not be mounted. If not
mounted, it does not even need to be formatted since the formatting
will be destroyed anyway.</p>

<p>By the way, the raw copy can also be done under DOS/Windows with
a utility that can write to a physical sector disregarding the file
system. One such utility is the Norton Disk Editor.</p>

<p>After inserting the second boot diskette, knoppix26 will
boot.</p>

<h4>The shape of things to come</h4>

Evidently, option 2 cannot be recommended to anybody, too much of a
hassle. The chain boot loaders listed above are the way to go. Note
that Microsoft has just turned to a chain boot for their XP CDs' to
handle non-bootable CDROMs. 

<p>Still, we have here some developments to watch. With the Linux
kernel too big for a normal 1.4M diskette, syslinux is going to be
relegated to rescue diskettes, it won't help any longer for the
current Linux releases.</p>

<p>And even lilo gets an encouraging kick to the exit. With kernel 2.4.x, a
lilo diskette could still quickly boot a Knoppix installed to a
non-bootable partition: you had Windows as normal straight boot from hard
disk, Knoppix also on hard disk but booted from diskette, no clashes. This
may still be doable for kernel 2.6.x if the hardware does not require any
special drivers at boot time and the initial ram disk can be dispensed
with. If you need an initial ram disk, expect its size to be in the region
of 4M: you will have to customize it so as to fit it on a diskette, in
which case you have again an approach like Option 2. If not possible then
the initial ram disk would have to be on the hard disk and lilo is simply
not able to find it.</p>

<p>Exit syslinux, exit lilo, everything points to grub. And maybe
they will throw in a CD boot from diskette as a bonus?</p>
