The time has come for me to again pass on the reins of <I>Linux Gazette</I>.
I need my weekends back for sanity. I have enjoyed doing <I>LG</I> and will
miss it. You can bet that I will still be keeping an eye on things as
overseer.
<P> 
SSC hired Mike Orr as webmaster in April and he will be taking over <I>LG</I> 
with the next issue.
<P> 
Have fun!
