Muthukumar Kalimani wanted to install three
operating systems on his box. I had helped
my friend do the same and here are some hard
found lessons.
</STRONG></P>

<Strong><ul>
<LI>Use "fdisk" from your Linux
  distro CD to create partitions. Use the
  expert mode to partition the hard disk and
  use cylinder numbers for specifying partition
  sizes.

<LI>Using fdisk create a 25Mb - 30 Mb partition
  which is below cylinder number 1024. This will
  be the partition in which you will install the
  /boot of Linux OS.
</ul></Strong>

The Large Disk HOWTO
<A HREF="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Large-Disk-HOWTO.html"

claims this is mostly not a problem any more.

(Paranoid people like myself continue to place
<TT>/boot</TT> partitions and C: partitions below 1024.)

In theory, it went away in 1994.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
That was the year that motherboard manufacturers rolled out Yet Another
BIOS Extension, providing a new method by which boot-time software could
get extended BIOS routine 13h information to directly address logical
cylinders numbered 1024 and above.  A new version of LILO immediately
came out, that requested and could process that BIOS information.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, in theory, the only people who need put <TT>/boot</TT> below the 1024th
logical cylinder are
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>using really antique booting software (a very bad idea) or

<LI>contending with very old motherboard BIOSes, usually on 486es.  I'm
   unclear on whether any early Pentium motherboards used the older-version
   int 13h call, or whether it's a 486-only issue.
</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
A lot of us old-timers retain the <TT>/boot-filesystem-first</TT> habit just from
long usage, but also because people sometimes come in the door with
antique BIOSes and fail to mention that fact.  Better to put <TT>/boot</TT> near
the outer tracks than risk spending considerable effort building a
system and then find it unbootable.

Rick and I both do installfests;  I especially help people with laptops,
which have all sorts of oddball things in their BIOS.  It's far easier
to obey this rule of thumb than have to do things over on the limited
time available at such install parties (usually only about 4 or 5 hours,
but people arrive late, and would rather spend time learning the diffs
between K and Gnome, set up their mailer, etc).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I think it's important to note that <TT>/boot</TT> doesn't care about being
first, only about early on the disk (if it cares at all).  I usually
give it partition 2;  that satisfies some MSwin setups that want the
first entry, and avoids the 4th entry, which some hibernation setups
like to take.  Make the third an extend partition, put a D: in there
if you were planning a more even split on a large disk, a swap, and
at least one more volume for <TT>/</TT> (though I refer you to past articles
for The Gang's recommendations about partition layout beyond that).
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If you are really trying for maximum space "under the bar" assigned
elsewhere instead ... it can be as small as 7 or 8 MB.
I wouldn't go smaller for fear that monolithic kernels might
get pretty big at some point.  You always want room for three things:
the bootloader parts themselves, a known good kernel, and whichever
one you are recently trying out.   If you're triple-or-more booting
and more than one are Linux, you might want to lean the other
direction and make room for lots of modules to go with them (symlink
<TT>/lib/modules</TT> to <TT>/boot/modules</TT> in all distros and share the goodies).

using "fdisk" refer to:

<Strong><ul>
<LI>install Win98 first and give it the first
  partition i.e. allow it to place itself in c:.
  If you do not do this Win98 usually corrupts
  whatever OS (even if it is from Win family)
  is placed on C:.

If you create the FAT filesystem for it ahead of time,
MSwin's <TT>SETUP.EXE</TT> usually won't gratuitously fill the entire
disk for you, which saves digging up a resizer later.

<LI>When you install Linux remember to place the
  /boot on the partition you created for it.

<LI>If you have trouble booting into your Linux
  after you have installed all three OSs, you need
  a Operating System loader.
  Use Google Search to find any of the following
  loaders

<LI>XOSL -&gt; Nice GUI

<LI>Boot Part -&gt; Light weight and CLI (non-GUI)

Are you specifically excluding LILO and GRUB?  Why?

I had written that the querent needs to
install a loader <em> _if</em> he has <em>trouble_</em>
booting into GNU/Linux (using either GRUB/LILO).
I had installed RH 7.1 with Win2k and I had
trouble booting into GNU/Linux.
RH 7.1 came with LILO version 21.4-4
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thankfully this problem was well documented
in Linux+NT-Loader mini-HOWTO
It had adviced to use
Boot Part for solving this problem.
I am still using Boot Part to boot into
my GNU/Linux(RH 7.1) OS.
I think newer versions of RH do not show this
problem but I am not sure as I have
only RH 7.1. (thinking of shifting to
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A>).LILO does not need any special
hacking to detect and boot up Win98.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
One of my friends had discovered XOSL
and even though he was a newbie, he had
three OSs up and running in no time.
(Win 98,WinXP,Linux and maybe Win2k too!)

GRUB is more user-friendly than LILO.  I wish I could use it
on my computer but the "linear" option doesn't work.  I had
to switch back to LILO because my computer won't work with
the "lba32" setting.

Talking about loaders, three years back
I experimented with Be OS.It was really
cool and really sparing of machine resources.
I had Win98 installed on my box. It installed
quite easily on FAT filesystem and it placed an
icon on my Win98 desktop. On clicking it, Be
would boot up. And I think it did not take much
time to startup. I removed it beacuse it did
not come bundled with much apps. What I wanted to
know do we have this sort of funky loader in
GNU/Linux?

Yes.  The canonical way to launch Linux froma running DOS
or MSwin system is a program called <TT>LOADLIN.EXE.</TT>  I understand
there is a mildly different version of it for NT, and you should
prepare a PIF for it that tells MSwin it's okay to give it all
the resources it needs - go ahead and take over the CPU - then
you'll have a happy one way trip to whatever kernel you told it
to load.   Oh yeah, and the linux kernel you use has to be
visible in your DOS filesystem.  I usually suggest to keep
such parts in C:\LINUX so it's obvious.

I have not experimented with GRUB but LILO
can be tough for a newbie (IMVVHO). Again
I am talking about the older versions and
I have no experience with newer versions.

A lot of people never learned the Zen of LILO:
</blockQuote>

<blockQuote><ol>
<LI>/sbin/lilo (the "map installer") is best thought of as a compiler,
    and /etc/lilo.conf as its source code.

<LI>Therefore, if you change /etc/lilo.conf or any of the files it
    points to, you must run /sbin/lilo before rebooting, to "recompile".

<LI>You should always have a "safeboot" stanza in /etc/lilo, pointing
    to a known-good kernel image that you never fool with, as a
    fallback.  This ensures that if, e.g., you compile a new kernel but
    accidentally omit console support, you can easily recover.
</ol></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
GRUB is a capable and flexible bootloader, but practically all of the
reasons commonly cited for it being preferable to LILO boil down to
"I once messed with my boot files before reading LILO documentation,
shot myself in the foot, and therefore blame LILO."
