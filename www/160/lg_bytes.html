<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat and Redmond to Extend Virtualization Interoperability</h3>

<p>Red Hat announced in February that in response to strong customer 
demand, it has signed reciprocal agreements with Microsoft Corporation 
to enable increased interoperability for the companies' virtualization 
platforms. Each company will join the other's virtualization 
validation/certification program and will provide coordinated 
technical support for their mutual server virtualization customers. 
Other than for testing and certification, no funds will be exchanged.</p>

<p>With the efforts being undertaken today through this announcement, Red 
Hat and Microsoft customers will have the ability to run Microsoft 
Windows Server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual servers on either 
host environment with configurations that will be tested and supported 
by both virtualization and operating system leaders.</p>

<p>The key components of the reciprocal agreements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Hat will validate Windows Server guests to be supported on 
Red Hat Enterprise virtualization technologies.</li>
<li>Microsoft will validate Red Hat Enterprise Linux server guests 
to be supported on Windows Server Hyper-V and Microsoft Hyper-V Server.</li>
<li>Once each company completes testing, customers with valid 
support agreements will receive coordinated technical support for 
running Windows Server operating system virtualized on Red Hat 
Enterprise, and for running Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtualized on Windows
Server Hyper-V and Microsoft Hyper-V Server. </ul>

<p>The agreements establish coordinated technical support for Microsoft 
and Red Hat's mutual customers using server virtualization, and the 
activities included in these agreements do not require the sharing of 
IP. Therefore, the agreements do not include any patent or open source 
licensing rights, and additionally contain no financial clauses, other 
than industry-standard certification/validation testing fees.</p>

<p>The original Red Hat webcast should be available for replay at 
<a href="http://www.redhat.com/promo/webcast/216">http://www.redhat.com/promo/webcast/216</a>.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Moonlight Now on the Linux Desktop</h3>

<p>Novell released in February the first open source implementation of 
Microsoft's Silverlight media framework: Moonlight 1.0.</p>

<p>The first and only open source project that provides Linux users 
access to Microsoft Silverlight content, Moonlight demonstrates 
Novell's commitment to making Linux a first-class platform for 
multimedia and Rich Internet Applications. Moonlight provides the 
platform Linux users need to use Silverlight and Windows Media 
content. In combination with Banshee, a Novell-sponsored project to 
produce an open source media player, Moonlight is part of a complete 
multimedia solution on Linux.</p>

<p>Available for all major Linux distributions, including openSUSE, SUSE 
Linux Enterprise, Fedora, Red Hat, and Ubuntu, Moonlight is in part a 
result of the existing technical collaboration between Microsoft and 
Novell that extends interoperability between Windows and Linux. 
Windows Media Video (.wmv), Windows Media Audio (.wma), and MP3 files 
are supported through the Microsoft Media Pack, a Microsoft-delivered 
set of media codecs that brings optimized and licensed decoders to 
every Linux user using Moonlight. Additionally, it allows developers 
to write Rich Internet Applications for multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Moonlight has already proven useful to tens of thousands of Linux 
users. A pre-release of Moonlight was delivered on January 19, 2009 to 
allow Linux users to stream Barack Obama's Inauguration. More than 
20,000 Linux users downloaded Moonlight to watch the Silverlight 
broadcast.</p>

<p>"Moonlight brings the benefits of Silverlight's popular multimedia 
content to Linux viewers,"said Miguel de Icaza, Mono project founder 
and Developer Platform vice president at Novell. "This first release 
delivers on the goal of breaking down barriers to multimedia content 
and creating parity in the user's viewing experience regardless of 
whether the user is on Windows or Linux."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Establishes Open Source Storage Encryption Standard</h3>

<p>This past February, Sun Microsystems released the first generic communication 
protocol between a key manager and an encrypting device into the open 
source community. This allows better management of encrypted keys and 
can avoid licensing fees for proprietary encryption schemes. The 
protocol is implemented as a complete toolkit and is downloadable from 
the OpenSolaris website: 
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/project/kmsagenttoolkit/">http://opensolaris.org/os/project/kmsagenttoolkit/</a>.</p>

<p>By releasing the Sun protocol as Open Source, Sun is taking steps 
towards unifying the technology. Sun continues to work with partners 
and with appropriate standards bodies such as IEEE 1619.3 Working 
Group and OASIS to further develop and formalize the interface as an 
industry standard. RSA is currently developing a solution using this 
protocol to work with their RKM key manager. IBM's drive division is 
working on supporting this protocol for their IBM LTO4 drive shipped 
in Sun Libraries. Additionally, Sun has shared this protocol with 
numerous other industry partners including computer OEMs, back up 
application providers, disk array and switch manufacturers.</p>

<p>Governments, finance, healthcare, retail, and other vertical markets 
need to comply with current regulatory laws that create mandates to 
protect sensitive stored data. To support these requirements, this 
protocol is available to customers using the Sun StorageTek KMS 2.0 
Key Manager and Sun StorageTek Enterprise Drives and Sun StorageTek 
LTO4 drives shipped in Sun libraries. A number of additional partners 
are developing products based on this protocol, including EMC, whose 
RSA security division has talked about releasing it as an option on 
their RKM Key Manager.</p>

<p>"Open Storage solutions allows customers to break free from the chains 
of proprietary hardware and software and this new protocol extends 
this lifeline into the expensive and highly fragmented encryption 
market," said Jason Schaffer, senior director, storage product 
management, Sun Microsystems, Inc. "Open source equals customer value 
for encryption solutions and Sun now offers the only solution on the 
market that works across multiple vendors and suppliers."</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">IBM Petaflop Supercomputer Europe's Most Powerful</h3>

<p>The German research center Forschungszentrum Juelich has selected IBM 
(NYSE: IBM) to develop the first supercomputer in Europe capable of 
one Petaflop, or one thousand trillion operations per second. IBM will 
partner with Juelich-based Gauss Centre for Supercomputing to install 
the new IBM Blue Gene/P System in the first half of this year.</p>

<p>This new system - financed by the German Government - will help assure 
Forschungszentrum Juelich remains one of Europe's most renowned 
research centers and continues to play an important role in the global 
high performance computing research community.</p>

<p>This new Blue Gene System is the first to include new water cooling 
technology, created by IBM Research, that uses room temperature water 
to cool the servers. As air moves through the server racks, heat is 
removed as it passes through the water-based cooling system before it 
enters the next rack of servers. This result is a 91 percent reduction 
in air conditioning units that would have been required to cool 
Forschungszentrum Juelich's data center with an air-cooled Blue Gene.</p>

<p>"With speeds over a Petaflop, this new Juelich-based supercomputer 
offers the processing ability of more than 200,000 laptop computers," 
explains Professor Thomas Lippert, lead scientist of the Juelich 
supercomputing center. "In addition to raw power, this new system will 
be among the most energy efficient in the world."</p>

<p>The new Blue Gene/P System will include nearly 295,000 POWER 
processors in 72 racks and also include over 144 terabytes of memory. 
It will significantly add to Forschungszentrum Juelich's existing 
supercomputing capability at the Center, which includes an additional 
six petabytes of hard disk drive space, the amount equivalent of more 
than one million DVDs.</p>

<p>Inauguration and naming of the new systems will take place at an 
opening ceremony in mid-2009. The new supercomputer will be the first 
for the German Gauss Center for Supercomputing (GCS).</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Cuba Shows Linux-based National OS at I.T. Convention</h3>

<p>[based on on materials from Reuters and <a href="http://www.escambray.cu">http://www.escambray.cu</a>, the 
digital newspaper of Sancti Spiritus province, Cuba.]</p>

<p>A local Linux variant developed by Havana computer science students, 
will become the national distro of Cuba.</p>

<p>NOVA, a Linux-based operating system apparently based on Gentoo, 
supports standard office work applications, playing music and video 
archives and surfing the Web. The initiative is aimed at saving 
dollars in terms of paying for software program licenses and achieving 
technological independence from US companies. </p>

<p class="editorial">[ Wait, wait... this is like a repeat nightmare. Isn't
there a standard story about how the Chevrolet Nova didn't sell well in
Mexico because 'no va' in Spanish means 'no go'??? Only this time, it's not
clueless American GM executives deciding on the name... -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>The Cuban News Agency reported that the NOVA operating system and 
other free technologies are aimed at inexpert users or at those who 
are currently migrating to this Linux-based software programs from 
Windows. According to reports from Reuters, Cuban ministries are also 
concerned about security for the Windows-based computers they already 
have and believe US intelligence agencies have backdoor access to many 
of the Windows applications.</p>

<p>The NOVA OS, developed by the University of Information Technologies 
(UCI) in Havana, was one of the 23 Cuban products on display at the 
13th I.T. Convention and Fair. The NOVA team is based at the 
University and offers technical support, security patches and software 
updates.</p>

<p>There are over 1 million computer users in Cuba and currently about 
20% use Linux.  With the adoption of NOVA, the government there hopes 
exceed 50% Linux usage in 5 years.</p>

<p>This year's I.T. Convention was divided into two parts. The first 
consisted of a scientific event with 80 lectures, mainly by delegates 
and representatives from international organizations and institutions. 
The second was an exhibition with the participation of more than 140 
Cuban and foreign entities.</p>

<p>A YouTube posting shows the OS in operation:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Intrahealth Open Initiative to Fund Open Source Training for Health 
Workers in Africa</h3>
<p>IntraHealth OPEN is a global initiative that engages African 
technology, health leaders and students to develop and sustain 
software applications tailored to meet urgent health care needs. The 
project will strengthen African health professionals' ability to 
identify and implement appropriate technology solutions that make 
health services more cost-effective and accessible.</p>

<p>IntraHealth International has a global leadership role in developing 
and implementing open systems to support accessible, high-quality 
health care in Africa and on introducing systems to better plan and 
manage the healthcare workforce in Africa. IntraHealth currently has 
open source initiatives under way in nine countries in Africa.</p>

<p>IntraHealth International is partnering with Grammy Award-winning 
artist Youssou N'Dour on a charity album titled "OPEN Remix" 
benefiting a new initiative created to address critical health issues 
in Africa by putting the latest open source software technologies 
directly in the hands of health workers.</p>

<p>Nas, Duncan Sheik and Peter Buck of R.E.M. are among the headliners 
donating remixes of N'Dour's song "Wake Up" to raise funds and 
visibility for the IntraHealth OPEN Initiative.</p>

<p>Starting February 11th and rolling through Spring, free downloads of 
the songs will be available with a suggested donation through 
distribution partners including Rhapsody, iLike, Amazon MP3, and 
through IntraHealth's website at <a href="http://www.intrahealth.org/open">http://www.intrahealth.org/open</a>.</p>

<p>With growing connectivity and mobile phone use increasing at twice the 
global rate, Africa can take advantage of cutting edge eHealth 
technologies. Open source technology is ideally suited for application 
in low-resource environments since it is inexpensive, flexible, and 
collaborative.</p>

<p>IntraHealth has been collaborating with African governments and 
private institutions to design and apply open source solutions to 
strengthen their ability to use health information for strategic 
health policy and planning. Using web-based interfaces, mobile phones 
and PDAs, open source software systems can provide far-reaching and 
innovative tools to support increased efficiency, productivity, and 
performance of health services and information to meet the needs of 
families and communities across the continent.</p>

<p>To help shepherd its growing initiative, IntraHealth has assembled an 
OPEN Council made up of supporters and leaders in the fields of 
entertainment, technology, and public health. The OPEN Council members 
include recording artists and representatives from VH1, MTV Europe 
Foundation, ONE, Wikia, AEG Live, Rhapsody. iLike, Bowery Presents, 
Indaba Music, Tech Soup Global, Red Hat, inSTEDD, The Linux 
Foundation, GNOME Foundation, Creative Commons, Open Source Software 
Institute, OSU Open Source Lab, O'Reilly Media, Motorola, Novell, 
Brightkite, The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, D-Tree 
International, Ushahidi, the Center for Children and Technology and 
Reseau Africain de L'Education Pour La Sante. The group is seeking 
funding and partners to help expand the program.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 Released</h3>

<p>The Debian Project has released Debian GNU/Linux version 5.0 
(codenamed "Lenny") after 22 months of development work. Debian 
GNU/Linux is based on the 2.6.26 Linux kernel and supports a total of 
twelve processor architectures including Intel and AMD (both 32bit and 
64bit), PowerPC, HP PA-RISC, MIPS, ARM and IBM S/390 platforms.</p>

<p>Live CD, USB images, CD, DVD and newly added Blu-ray disc images are 
available to download, via FTP, HTTP or BitTorrent.</p>

<p>Debian 5.0 includes the KDE, GNOME, Xfce, and LXDE desktop 
environments. It also features compatibility with the FHS v2.3 and 
software developed for version 3.2 of the LSB.</p>

<p>Debian 5.0 "Lenny" adds support for Marvell's Orion platform which is 
used in many storage devices. Additionally, "Lenny" now supports 
several Netbooks, in particular the Eee PC by Asus. "Lenny" also 
contains the build tools for Emdebian which allow Debian source 
packages to be cross-built and shrunk to suit embedded ARM systems. 
Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 "Lenny" includes the new ARM EABI port, "armel".</p>

<p>This release includes numerous updated software packages, such as the 
K Desktop Environment 3.5.10 (KDE), an updated version of the GNOME 
desktop environment 2.22.2, the Xfce 4.4.2 desktop environment, LXDE 
0.3.2.1, the GNUstep desktop 7.3, X.Org 7.3, OpenOffice.org 2.4.1, 
GIMP 2.4.7, Iceweasel 3.0.6 (an unbranded version of Mozilla Firefox), 
Icedove 2.0.0.19 (an unbranded version of Mozilla Thunderbird), 
PostgreSQL 8.3.6, MySQL 5.0.51a, GNU Compiler Collection 4.3.2, Linux 
kernel version 2.6.26, Apache 2.2.9, Samba 3.2.5, Python 2.5.2 and 
2.4.6, Perl 5.10.0, PHP 5.2.6, Asterisk 1.4.21.2, Emacs 22, Inkscape 
0.46, Nagios 3.06, Xen Hypervisor 3.2.1 (dom0 as well as domU 
support), OpenJDK 6b11, and more than 23,000 other ready-to-use 
software packages (built from over 12,000 source packages).</p>

<p>With the integration of X.Org 7.3, the X server autoconfigures itself 
with most hardware. Newly introduced packages allow the full support 
of NTFS filesystems and the use of most multimedia keys out of the 
box. Support for Adobe Flash format files is available via the swfdec 
or Gnash plugins. Overall improvements for notebooks have been 
introduced such as out of the box support of CPU frequency scaling.</p>

<p>Further improvements in system security include the installation of 
available security updates before the first reboot by the Debian 
Installer, the reduction of setuid root binaries and open ports in the 
standard installation, and the use of GCC hardening features in the 
builds of several security-critical packages.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Gives GlassFish Portfolio Integrated LAMP Stack</h3>
<p>Sun announced in February its Sun GlassFish Portfolio, an open source, 
high-performance Web platform, based on its GlassFish application 
server.</p>

<p>Built on leading open source projects - including Apache Tomcat, Ruby, 
PHP, Liferay Portal and GlassFish - the Sun GlassFish Portfolio 
packages these components into a complete, pre-integrated and 
fully-tested open source platform. This includes a packaged version of 
what was the WebSynergy project - Sun's portal software combined with 
LifeRay's portal.  It is now
available as Web Space portal, a partnered product. Web Space portal 
allows uses to create their own spaces for collaboration and social 
networking and is viewed as a FOSSw alternative to products like 
Sharepoint. The FOSSw version of Web Space is available at 
<a href="https://portal.dev.java.net/">https://portal.dev.java.net</a>.</p>

<p>"Companies are under huge pressure to do more with less, and more and 
more frequently they are turning to scalable, supported open source 
technologies," said Mark Herring, vice president, Software 
Infrastructure, Sun Microsystems. "With GlassFish Portfolio, Sun is 
providing customers with the highest-scaling, highest performance and 
lowest cost, open source platform. Companies developing Web 
applications with the Sun GlassFish Portfolio can expect to deploy 
quickly, see a seven-fold improvement in application 
price/performance at only 10 percent of the cost - over 
proprietary offerings."</p>

<p>The Sun GlassFish Portfolio offers a range of support and services 
options for customers, from basic patch services to 24x7 mission 
critical support. The Sun GlassFish Portfolio is available immediately 
via a flexible subscription-based pricing model starting at $999 per 
server (USD), making it a cost-effective solution. Also included is 
unlimited server pricing which can save 80-90% of costs compared to 
competitiors with fixed, per-server licensing. </p>

<p>To purchase the Sun GlassFish Portfolio, visit: 
<a href="http://www.sun.com/glassfish">http://www.sun.com/glassfish</a>.</p>

<p>According to Sun, this combines the most downloaded open source 
application server, GlassFish, with the world's most popular open 
source database, MySQL,  and allows customers to develop a unified 
open source strategy with simplicity-of-use for developers and 
administrators. GlassFish Portfolio and MySQL Enterprise are both 
available from Sun with consistent pricing and subscription support 
model that mirrors support at silver/gold/platnum levels.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss RESTEasy 1.0 Framework Goes GA</h3>

<p>The GA (General Availability) release of JBoss RESTEasy occurred in late
January. JBoss RESTEasy is a framework that allows writing RESTFul Web
Services in Java. It offers a fully portable implementation of the JAX-RS
specification for RESTful Web Services over HTTP.</p>

<p>RESTEasy can run in any servlet container, but tight integration with 
the JBoss Application Server is also available. While JAX-RS is only a 
server-side specification, RESTEasy brings JAX-RS to the client 
through the RESTEasy JAX-RS Client Framework. This client-side 
framework maps outgoing HTTP requests to remote servers using JAX-RS 
annotations and interface proxies.</p>

<p>Features include:</p>

<li> Fully certified JAX-RS implementation;</li>
<li> Portable to any app-server/Tomcat that runs on JDK 5 or higher;</li>
<li> Embeddedable server implementation for junit testing;</li>
<li> Rich set of providers for: XML, JSON, YAML, Fastinfoset, Atom, 
etc;</li>
<li> JAXB marshalling into XML, JSON, Fastinfoset, and Atom as well 
as wrappers for arrays, lists, and sets of JAXB Objects;</li>
<li> Asynchronous HTTP (Comet) abstractions for JBoss Web, Tomcat 6, 
and Servlet 3.0;</li>
<li> EJB, Spring, and Spring MVC integration;</li>
<li> Client framework that leverages JAX-RS annotations so that you 
can write HTTP clients easily (JAX-RS only defines server 
bindings).</ul>

<p>All documentation and download links are available at RESTEasy's 
<a href="http://jboss.org/">JBoss.org</a> project page.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LeftHand Networks Delivers Entry-level SAN for Virtualized Environments</h3>

network (SAN) solution that improves performance and reduces storage 
costs within virtualized server environments for midsize businesses.</p>

<p>The LeftHand SAS Starter SAN helps customers efficiently deploy their 
first virtualization projects by simplifying the process of creating, 
accessing and managing shared storage resources.</p>

<p>The SAS Starter SAN includes management tools that provide 
replication, thin provisioning and snapshot capabilities. These 
capabilities help ensure data availability even as the environment 
becomes more complex. In addition, customers can purchase only the 
capacity they need, easily increasing both the capacity and 
performance of their system without experiencing any disruption. The 
SAS Starter SAN can scale to more than 80 network ports and 320 disk 
drives to accommodate business growth.</p>

<p>LeftHand also introduced a higher capacity SATA Starter SAN that 
offers a 25 percent reduction in the cost per gigabyte (GB) of disk 
drive capacity than the previous generation. The solution's storage 
capacity has increased 33 percent to 12 terabytes (TB) while 
maintaining its current list price. The SATA Starter SAN is ideal for 
customers who want to consolidate storage for Microsoft Windows or 
Linux servers.</p>

<p>Pricing starts at $35,000 for the 4.8 TB SAS Starter SAN and $30,000 
for the 12 TB SATA Starter SAN. More information on LeftHand Networks 
SAN solutions is available at: <a href="http://www.lefthandnetworks.com/home.aspx">http://www.lefthandnetworks.com</a>.</p>
