<BR>Question by Brian

<P><STRONG>
Well, i installed the SuSe 8.2 pro, and it's really nice.  Found Kino
and got my firewire DV video camera to download some AVI files. wow! To
get a final product SVCD of my little princess riding horses, i decided
to use Cinelerra.it won't install, because  libstdc++so.3 isn't found.
I have all the C++ from SuSe, but, not this.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My Questions:
1	i have the files from a Linux Format DVD "essentials" section.    It
looks "involved" to install. Do i need the one file  libstdc++so.3, or
the whole group?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
2 Could you recommend a course of action.  I would like to do some video
editing again.  I'm 1/2 way there and real excited.  Dang! i'm getting
all shaky again!
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This looks like a classic case of "I cannot find the symlink". I usually
get annoyed at programs that do this, but the solution is simple:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
1. Find "libstdc++" (possibly in <TT>/usr/lib/</TT>)
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
2. ln -s /usr/lib/libstdc++ /usr/lib/libstdc++so.3
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(What you may find is that a file called "libstdc++so.so" exists, and
should that point of a library file, symlink it as appropriate).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
3. run "ldconfig -X" (as root)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(Step 3 is there to keep the cache happy, although it is usually not
needed).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
HTH,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you very much.  Cinelerra is working, the frame rate is up w/ my
NVIDIA driver, and i have 2 week's vacation starting today!. whoo hoo!
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I am requesting your permission to post your suggestion to the web -
chat sites where a few are experiencing similar difficulties.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
thanks a 1 EE6.

<br>Question by Anil KP

<P><STRONG>
Hi,
We have leaseline from our isp and they have given us
8 ethernet ipz(public ip) for our internal servers.
The problem is that our ispz dns doesnt work properly.
so i thought of setting up my own dns.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was able to setup the dns on the private
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
network(192.168.1.1-first ethernet card) successfully
but was not able to setup the dns properly on the
public ip(another ethernet card).  What wud be reverse
lookup zone file  in the case of public ip?(I was
given by my isp only 8 pulic ipz ).
Anticipating ur reply
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Kapil] 
This can only be done by subnet assignment. The ISP needs to
create entries for your in their reverse zone file which point
to your server. Look for CIDR or Classless Internet Domain Routing
on google.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I think this is only applicable if bot hyou and the ISP use "bind".
If you use DJBernstein's domain name server programs then things are
different.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
To repeat, this is only possible through co-operation with the entity
(presumably your ISP) who has been authorised to provide reverse lookup
to the entire Class C net to which your eight addresses belong.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As an example you can get for our domain:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockquote><pre>$ host -t PTR 81.209.199.203.in-addr.arpa.
81.209.199.203.in-addr.arpa     CNAME   81.imsc.209.199.203.in-addr.arpa

Hi there dude,
</P>
<P>
i have a general question regarding Home LAN setup on Linux
</P>
<P>
I have 2 PCs to be networked and sharing a connection. Do i need 2 network
cards, 1 leading out to the outside world, another leading to my internal
LAN? Is this setup common? Will it help in LAN security?

Generally speaking, if you're using one of the Linux boxes as a
router/firewall.  If you're using, say a LInksys router/firewall, then
no, you don't need two NICS in one Linux box.

<p><em>That "rumor" is per a Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) post by Sam Flory.  It's probably mirrored lots of places, but here's a pointer:

<br>In the rest of the thread, Hugo notes that he's only looking for
basic drive-access features, but above, he notes that he hasn't managed to code them
up himself, and is giving up (his main contribution having been patching
the PCI ID recognition).  For fairness sake they have binary modules for a few other stock boxed-linux kernels but as soon as you stray off the beaten path - and possibly as soon as you upgrade even if staying within the distro's offered kernels - someone else will have to figure out why the SiI3112 chip hates Seagate SATA drives.<em></p>

Actually i am not using red hat, although it is insalled on my pc.
Rather
i am using cygwin (<A HREF="http://cygwin.com"
	>http://cygwin.com</A> which is linus-like environment for
windows platform - my OS is Windows 2000) for these rpms. It is working
fine with .tar and .gz files..but giving problems with all the files of
rpm format.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ashwin] 
That is the problem! I have used Cygwin before, but I didn't know that
they
had even ported over RPM! In any case, if your need is just for a Java
SDK,
you can download the one available for Windows from the Sun website.
Install
it and the java, javac and other commandline tools will be available to
you
under Cygwin. Just remember to update the PATH variable with the directory
where the Java binaries are located.

Thanks for the help.........it is working this way.......

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Ashwin] 
For other Linux utilities that are not available from the Cygwin mirrors,
you will have the best chance with the .tar.gz or .tar.bz2 files of those
applications.

<P><STRONG>
Hello,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I have a NVIDA GForce 2 Go 100 card that supports
multiheaded display easily in Windows. Now i want to
do the same in Linux. I have RedHat 8.0. What do you
suggest that I do?
</STRONG></P>

I suggest using Google

<blockquote><font color="#000066">I suppose you could try the Gentoo Unreal Tournament demo CD, which
won't replace anything on your computer.  At the very least it's tuned
up for NVidia.  Find it by typing "unreal" into the search gadget at
Freshmeat.Net.
