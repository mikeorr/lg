Some comments -
</p>

<p>
Section 8 - Configure your LAN machines
</p>

<p>
Use dhcp instead of trying to configure each machine individually.
</p>

<p>
Section 11 BIND DNS Server
</p>

<p>
another option is to use pdnsd as a caching nameserver.
</p>

<p>
Section 13 Samba file sharing
</p>

<p>
If you are only using linux boxes, you can also share using nfs.
Caveats:  it takes long time to mount large directories.
</p>

<p>
Section 14 TorrentFlux
</p>

<p>
Nice tip!
</p>

<p>
Thanks

That would be the primary one I was trying to suggest in my editorial
footnote, BTW.

Thank you for the clear instructions, Dr Lazar. I used these step by 
step, and after a few tries, my DNS server works. How about printing. I 
just bought a new HP2600n printer, which does allow TCP/IP using DHCP 
and BOOTSTRAP protocols. Can this work with Ubuntu Feisty Fawn?
</p>

<p>
Thanks
</p>

Hello Dr. Chhabra,
</p>

<p>
Thank you for reading my article and I am glad it has been of use to
you. First off, printing is not my forte as I do not have a printer.
</p>

<p>
However, what I can tell you is that it can be done using Webmin and
you will need CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) to be installed on
your server. I am not sure if it comes preinstalled. You can check if
it is installed and running by going to System&gt;Bootup and Shutdown (in
Webmin) and looking for 'cupsys'. Make sure this is running and set to
start at bootup.
</p>

<p>
If you do not find CUPS on this page you can easily install it by
searching for and installing 'cupsys' and 'cupsys-client' using
System&gt;Software Packages as you did for 'shorewall' in the article...
or running 'sudo apt-get install cupsys*' in Other&gt;Command Shell.
</p>

<p>
You will then share your printer over the network using Samba, the
same service we used for file sharing.
</p>

<p>
After a bit of google-ing I have come up with a few things that will
hopefully help you configure your printer.
</p>

Here is a guide to setup your HP 2600n for colour printing. Follow the
instructions posted by JerMe as they seemed to have worked well. It
would be ideal if you have SSH installed and working so you can log
into your server in CLI as the instructions are bash commands.
However, you can also use the Others&gt;Command Shell tool in Webmin.
Alternatively, you could also temporarily plug a monitor and keyboard
to your server and work directly on the machine.
</p>

<p>
As for the part where JerMe uses gnome-cups-manager, please use the
Hardware&gt;Printer Administration tool in Webmin as your server does not
have the GNOME GUI.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://doxfer.com/Webmin/PrinterAdministration">http://doxfer.com/Webmin/PrinterAdministration</a>
</p>

<p>
Here is the Webmin page documenting printer adminstration using
Webmin. I hope it is clear and concise enough for your needs.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Here is the ubuntuguide.org documentation that explains setting up of
CUPS. As in my article, you can execute commands in the Command Shell
tool and edit files using the Java file manager.
</p>

This should help you setup up your printer for sharing with Windows
machines. It was written for SuSE Linux but it should work fine for
Ubuntu as well. Be careful when editing the smb.conf not to break the
file share you already have setup <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
I hope this has been helpful. I recommend you read all the articles
first and plan your course of action before you dive in trying to
configure your printer... as you will have to do a bit of mix n
match... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
If anyone else on Talkback has a better solution or more experience,
please help out the good doctor <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">
</p>

<p>
Shane.
