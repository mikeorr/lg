<h3>Making Snow Angels</h3>
<p>There's nothing like a foot of snow on the ground (as I write this) to
make you think of winter, so this month we'll again work on the website for
our winter sports equipment company:

<p><img src="misc/seymour/AlpineGearColor.png" alt="Alpine Gear logo"
	border="0">
			
<p>Last issue we created a colorway, a color logotype, and a logotype
variant for use on a color background (go <a
href="misc/seymour/LastMonth.html">here</a> to refresh your memory), along
with the <a href="misc/seymour/Landing.html">home page</a> for the company.
We also created a first-level internal directory page.

<p><br></p>

<iframe src="misc/seymour/Page1.html" width="640" height="480" scrolling="no" frameborder="1">
<em>Your browser does not support frames; in order to see the linked page,
you'll need to click <a href="misc/seymour/Page1.html">here</a></em>.
</iframe>

<p><br></p>

<p> This month we'll extend the line to include a raw product line page.

<p><br></p>
<iframe src="misc/seymour/Axes.html" width="640" height="480" scrolling="no" frameborder="1">
<em>Your browser does not support frames; in order to see the linked page,
you'll need to click <a href="misc/seymour/Axes.html">here</a></em>.
</iframe>
<p><br></p>

It doesn't look like much, and isn't very useful, without images of the
products. In addition, it will be problematic to put a lot of informative
text (product specs, etc.) on top of that pretty gradient.<p>To put some
flesh on the bones of the line, here's the revised version (I'd like to thank
the Grivel equipment company for the ice axes loosely described in these
pages; see <a href="http://www.grivel.com/">their site</a> for accurate
information.)

<p><br></p>
<iframe src="misc/seymour/AxeLine.html" width="640" height="480" scrolling="no" frameborder="1">
<em>Your browser does not support frames; in order to see the linked page,
you'll need to click <a href="misc/seymour/AxeLine.html">here</a></em>.
</iframe>
<p><br></p>

Note that, in order for the images to 'read' against the gradient, we've
limited them to small, high contrast, black-and-white photographs. Adding
the space for the photos also allowed us to include some additional
information for each of the axes, allowing the viewer to chose more readily
which one fits their needs.

<p>That leads us to a specific product page:

<p><br></p>
<iframe src="misc/seymour/AxeProduct.html" width="640" height="480" scrolling="no" frameborder="1">
<em>Your browser does not support frames; in order to see the linked page,
you'll need to click <a href="misc/seymour/AxeProduct.html">here</a></em>.
</iframe>
<p><br></p>

Note that we've gone to an all-white background, rather than the gradient,
in order to free up our use of color images and text. The layout is heavily
gridded (which we talked about in the <a
href="../106/seymour.html">September 2004 column</a>) to visually match the
previous, more general, pages.

<p>These pages have also been sized to be non-scrolling and the photos have
been kept small for quick opening. The specification link on each product
page, if active, would take the viewer to a different page grid, allowing
for much more text or detailed photos. There are also links to industry
certification of the product, along with one to a <a
href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/products/qt/">QuickTime</a> video of
the product being made in the notional AlpineGear factory. Note that we've
also allowed for non-US customers by providing a currency conversion page
that, using pop-ups (like those <a
href="http://www.xe.com/ucc/full.shtml">here</a>, or you could avoid all
the programming and just let the customer use that site in a new window),
would automatically convert the price of the product into any of the 180 or
so major currencies (assuming your credit card company allows you to accept
payments in colons, leks, pulas, or takas). There are also direct links to
the shopping cart, allowing the customer to add or remove the product
without having to view the cart.

<p>While this has been a look at a very simply styled website, and presents
only a few pages of what could be a several-hundred page site, I hope it
has helped you visualize how choices of color and style will shape the
presentation of information.

<p>Next month we'll return to the basics and talk about building a logo or
a logotype. As ever, if there's something specific you're interested in,
let me know.

<em>
<p> I started doing graphic design in junior high school, when it was still
the Dark Ages of technology. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were both eleven
years old, and the state of the art was typing copy on Gestetner masters.
I've worked on every new technology since, but I still own an X-acto knife
and know how to use it.

<p> I've been a freelancer, and worked in advertising agencies, printing
companies, publishing houses, and marketing organizations in major
corporations. I also did a dozen years [1985-1997] at Apple Computer; my
first Macintosh was a Lisa with an astounding 1MB of memory, and my current
one is a Cube with a flat screen.

<p> I've had a website up since 1997, and created my latest one in 2004. I'm
still, painfully, learning how web design is different from, but not
necessarily better than, print.
