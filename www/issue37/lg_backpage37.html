<P>
Thanks to all our authors, not just the ones above, but also those who wrote
giving us their tips and tricks and making suggestions. Thanks also to our
new mirror sites.
<P> 
I'm sick of the impeachment trial and wish a way could be found for the Senate
to get on with "business as usual" without the Republicans feeling like 
they have lost face. Of course, in my opinion they already have. 
All the polls show the American people don't want Clinton impeached and 
want the Congress to get on with their "real work". For the Republicans to 
completely ignore this and go forward with the trial, all the time saying
the American people are apathetic, shows an incredible arrogance on their
part. They obviously think their
constituents have no intelligence and no opinions worth listening too.
<P> 
I voted for Clinton but I wouldn't vote for him again. His complete lack of
judgement in his personal life is appalling. However, I don't think he has
done anything that can be called a "high crime".
<P>
Enough of the soap box.
<P> 
Have fun!
