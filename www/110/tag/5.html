Is there a FAQ somewhere of hardware manufacturers' track records
regarding open specs and cooperating with free software?
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I.e., the Tux-friendly seal of approval.  Not for things that are
just passively compatible with Linux, but for manufacturers who take
steps to cooperate.

If not, it
would be good to have one in LG, as a way to reward good manufacturers
and punish bad ones.  I'll write it up if people can send me facts and
links.  Off the top of my head...

winmodems bad.  Is there a software-only modem for Linux?  My friends with Macs like to gloat about their software modems, although the counterargument was why distract your main CPU when you can have a dedicated chip doing the work.

There is support for an IBM softmodem in the kernel, and there was a
project to get some Lucent modems working, though that pretty much fell
by the wayside. There is a software modem available, though it only goes
as far as 28.8 (the author shifted focus to other nifty things like tcc,
qemu, and ffmpeg).

The lucent modem <TT>/</TT> Linux situation seems to parallel that of the nVidia
graphics cards, in that proprietary binary modules link to the kernel
using the same or similar methods.  Although hardware UART modems will
undoubtedly remain preferrable for Linux users, I've always had pretty
good luck with the Lucent modems.  As winmodems go, they're probably one
of the easier varieties to deal with.  Not to say that they won't be a
pain when you find yourself dealing with a combination of kernel and
libgcc for which they haven't issued an update, but for me, that's
happened only once in the 8 yrs or so that I've been dealing with them.

No, there actually is some open source software that accesses Lucent
modems from user-space. It doesn't work as a modem, but the author just
wanted to be able to use it as a phone. Someone else tried to couple
that work with the software modem I mentioned, but I don't know if it
works at all.

There hasn't really been any work done in this area for years though.

The current functionality (0.9.9) is:

<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Finds a Lucent PCI winmodem and reports information on this.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Goes offhook and detects the dial tone.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Dials using pulses or dtmf. Here in the UK the dtmf dialling works, you
can hear the call being answered.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Try "ltmodem -d 011223344" (replace 011223344 with the number of your
favourite ISP) and listen to the modem at the other end answering the call!
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Detects the answer tone of the phone at the other end, or busy tone if
it is engaged.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Picks up incomming calls.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Command line mode allows control of modem interactively or via a script
file.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Includes fixes for Pavel's voice stuff, just need some more detailed
instructions on how to use it! This includes turning you computer into
an expensive telephone and full duplex voice transmission.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Reads ROM check sum and does basic I/O for DSP RAM.
