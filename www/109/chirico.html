<p>Under Linux, you can create a regular file, format it as an ext2, ext3,
or reiser filesystem, and then mount it just like a physical drive. It's
then possible to read and write files to this newly-mounted device. You
can also copy the complete filesystem, since it is just a file, to another
computer. If security is an issue, read on. This article will show you how
to encrypt the filesystem and mount it with ACL (Access Control Lists),
which gives you control of rights beyond the traditional read (r), write
(w), and execute (x) permissions for the three user groups "file", "owner",
and "other".</p>

<p>This is an excellent way to investigate different filesystems
without having to reformat a physical drive, which means you avoid
the hassle of moving all your data. This method is quick -- very
quick compared to preparing a physical device. What is truly great
about this technique is that you can explore different filesystems
such as reiserfs, ext3, or ext2 without having to purchase an
additional physical drive. Since the same file can be mounted on
more than one mount point, you can also investigate sync rates.</p>

<p>Creating a filesystem in this manner allows you to set a hard
limit on the amount of space used, which, of course, will be equal
to the file size. This can be an advantage if you need to move this
information to other servers. Since the contents cannot grow beyond
the file, you can easily keep track of how much space is being
used.</p>

<p>First, you want to create a 20MB file by executing the following
command:</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ dd if=/dev/zero of=disk-image count=40960
      40960+0 records in
      40960+0 records out
</pre>

<p>A count of 40960 created a 20 MB file because, by default, dd uses a
block size of 512 bytes. That makes the size: 40960*512=20971520.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ ls -l disk-image
      -rw-rw-r--    1 chirico  chirico  20971520 Sep  3 14:24 disk-image
</pre>

<p>Next, to format this as an ext3 filesystem, you just execute the
following command:</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ /sbin/mkfs -t ext3 -q disk-image
      mke2fs 1.32 (09-Nov-2002)
      disk-image is not a block special device.
      Proceed anyway? (y,n) y
</pre>

<p>You are asked whether to proceed because this is a file, and not
a block device. That is OK. We will mount this as a loopback device
so that this file will simulate a block device.</p>

<p>Next, you need to create a directory that will serve as a mount
point for the loopback device.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ mkdir fs
</pre>

<p>You are now one step away from the last step. You just want to
find out what the next available loopback device number is.
Normally, loopback devices start at zero (/dev/loop0) and work
their way up (/dev/loop1, /dev/loop2, ... /dev/loopn). An easy way
for you to find out what loopback devices are being used is to look
into /proc/mounts, since the mount command may not give you what
you need.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ cat /proc/mounts

      rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
      /dev/root / ext3 rw 0 0
      /proc /proc proc rw,nodiratime 0 0
      none /sys sysfs rw 0 0
      /dev/sda1 /boot ext3 rw 0 0
      none /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
      /proc/bus/usb /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs rw 0 0
      none /dev/shm tmpfs rw 0 0
</pre>

<p>On my computer, I have no loopback devices mounted, so I'm OK to
start with zero. You must do the next command as root, or with an
account that has superuser privileges.</p>

<pre class="code">
      # mount -o loop=/dev/loop0 disk-image fs
</pre>

<p>That's it. You just mounted the file as a device. Now take a
look at /proc/mounts, you will see this is using /dev/loop0.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ cat /proc/mounts

      rootfs / rootfs rw 0 0
      /dev/root / ext3 rw 0 0
      /proc /proc proc rw,nodiratime 0 0
      none /sys sysfs rw 0 0
      /dev/sda1 /boot ext3 rw 0 0
      none /dev/pts devpts rw 0 0
      /proc/bus/usb /proc/bus/usb usbdevfs rw 0 0
      none /dev/shm tmpfs rw 0 0
      /dev/loop0 /home/chirico/junk/fs ext3 rw 0 0
</pre>

<p>You can now create new files, write to them, read them, and do
everything you normally would do on a disk drive. First, I'll give
access to the chirico account.</p>

<pre class="code">
      # chown -R chirico.chirico /home/chirico/junk/fs
</pre>

<p>Now, under the chirico account, it is possible to create
files.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ cd /home/chirico/fs
      $ mkdir one two three
      $ ls -l

      total 15
      drwx------    2 chirico  chirico     12288 Sep  3 14:28 lost+found
      drwxrwxr-x    2 chirico  chirico      1024 Sep  3 14:34 one
      drwxrwxr-x    2 chirico  chirico      1024 Sep  3 14:34 three
      drwxrwxr-x    2 chirico  chirico      1024 Sep  3 14:34 two

      $ df -h

      Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
      /dev/sda2              17G   11G  4.6G  71% /
      /dev/sda1              99M   83M   11M  89% /boot
      none                   62M     0   62M   0% /dev/shm
      /home/chirico/junk/disk-image
                             20M  1.1M   18M   6% /home/chirico/junk/fs
</pre>

<p>If you need to unmount the filesystem, as root, just issue the
umount command. If you need to free the loopback device, execute
the losetup command with the -d option. You can execute both
commands as follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
      # umount /home/chirico/junk/fs
      # losetup -d /dev/loop0
</pre>

<h2>Using RWX -- The Old Way To Collaborate</h2>

<p>Before we get started with ACL, how would you set up rights on
the filesystem so that users could create and save documents that
others could modify? For instance, let's say that users chirico and
sporkey are collaborating on a project together.</p>

<p>Well, you have to add everyone to the same group. You would
execute commands like these:.</p>

<pre class="code">
      # groupadd sharefs
      # chown -R root.sharefs /home/chirico/junk/fs
      # chmod 2775 /home/chirico/junk/fs
      # usermod -G sharefs sporkey
      # usermod -G sharefs chirico
</pre>

<p>Note that if these changes do not take effect for your users
(for example, if they were logged in when you executed the
commands), they'll have to log out and log in again or execute the
"<code>$ newgrp sharefs</code>" command. No big deal, right? Well,
keep reading, and see how ACL avoids this step.</p>

<p>More importantly, even though the <b>old way</b> worked for you,
at some point, new users may need to be added to the project. What
if some of these users only need a subset of the rights? For
instance, you have developers, testers, managers, and a few special
people. There are limits to what the 'rwx'-type rights can do. ACL
solves a lot of these problems.</p>

<h2>ACL, Reiserfs, and AES Encryption: The 2.6 Kernel</h2>

<p>For the next steps, I will assume that you are running Red Hat
Fedora Core 2. If not, reference the 2.6 kernel upgrade section
below. Four things will be covered in this section:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create A File With Random Data</li>

<li>Set Up An AES Encrypted Loopback Device With Password</li>

<li>Build A Reiser Filesystem On The Loopback Device</li>

<li>Mount With ACL Capabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>Your installation of Fedora Core 2, by default, will be
configured for loop, cryptoloop, and aes, but it is highly unlikely
that you will have all of these modules loaded. So, execute the
following commands to load these modules (you will need to do this
as root):</p>

<pre class="code">
      # modprobe loop
      # modprobe cryptoloop
      # modprobe aes
</pre>

<p>Next, create a directory to store the files. The Reiser
filesystem will require more space than the ext3 filesystem.</p>

<pre class="code">
      # mkdir /home/diskimg
      # cd /home/diskimg
</pre>

<p>Instead of creating the file zeroed out, like you did with the
ext3 filesystem, this one is going to contain random bits, which
may add a little extra security.</p>

<pre class="code">
      # dd if=/dev/urandom of=disk-aes count=102400
</pre>

<p>We need to encrypt the loop device, so you need to use losetup.
You will be prompted for a password, which you will need to
remember when you mount the device.</p>

<pre class="code">
      # losetup -e aes /dev/loop1 ./disk-aes
        Password:
</pre>

<p>This step is new also. Instead of formatting the file directly,
you will format the loop device. The file stays encrypted. Again,
you will be prompted to continue, so just enter "y".</p>

<pre class="code">
      # mkfs -t reiserfs /dev/loop1

      mkfs.reiserfs 3.6.13 (2003 www.namesys.com)

      Tell your friends to use a kernel based on 2.4.18 or later, and especially not a     
      kernel based on 2.4.9, when you use reiserFS. Have fun.                              
                                                                                           
      ReiserFS is successfully created on /dev/loop1.                                      
</pre>

<p>Create the mount point /fs, and mount this device. Note that you
will be entering the acl option as well. Plus, you will prompted
for a password.</p>

<pre class="code">
      # mkdir /fs
      # mount -o loop,encryption=aes,acl ./disk-aes /fs
        Password:
</pre>

<p>Ok, now take a look at the mount command. It should show up as
the Reiser filesystem, encrypted, using ACL. Note that it says
loop2; it mounted it on /dev/loop2, which is one above what losetup
specified, /dev/loop1.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ mount
      /home/diskimg/disk-aes on /fs type reiserfs (rw,loop=/dev/loop2,encryption=aes,acl)
</pre>

<h2>Exploring ACL</h2>

<p>With ACL (Access Control Lists), you have finer control over
access permissions. With the rwx permission scheme, you cannot
easily change rights without creating new groups to handle the
users. With ACL, you can set user permissions without creating a
group, and individual users can add or remove access.</p>

<p>These rights are set with the <code>setfacl</code> command. The
command below will give the users donkey, chirico, and bozo2 access
to this new filesystem that we mounted. Again, I'm assuming that
you are using Fedora Core 2, or some distribution that is set up
for ACL.</p>

<pre class="code">
# setfacl -R -m d:u:donkey:rwx,d:u:chirico:rwx,d:u:bozo2:rwx /fs
</pre>

<p>Next, create a few directories as one of the users. The example
below was done as the user chirico.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ mkdir /fs/one
      $ touch /fs/one/stuff
      $ ls -l /fs/one/stuff
      -rw-rw----+ 1 chirico chirico 0 Sep  3 17:48 /fs/one/stuff
</pre>

<p>Notice the plus sign in the last line. It tells us a little
about who has access. So, as user chirico, the getfacl command can
be executed:</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ getfacl /fs/one/stuff                                    

      getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names     
      # file: fs/one/stuff                                       
      # owner: chirico                                           
      # group: chirico                                           
      user::rw-                                                  
      user:chirico:rwx                #effective:rw-             
      user:donkey:rwx                 #effective:rw-             
      user:bozo2:rwx                  #effective:rw-             
      group::r-x                      #effective:r--             
      mask::rw-                                                  
      other::---                                                 
</pre>

<p>We now see that donkey, chirico, and bozo2 have effective rights
on this file. Chirico has enough rights to remove bozo2.</p>

<pre class="code">
      $ setfacl -x u:bozo2 /fs/one/stuff
      $ getfacl /fs/one/stuff
      getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
      # file: fs/one/stuff
      # owner: chirico
      # group: chirico
      user::rw-
      user:chirico:rwx
      user:donkey:rwx
      group::r-x
      mask::rwx
      other::---
</pre>

<p>This is just scratching the surface of what can be done with
ACL. For more information, see some of the references below.</p>

<h2>2.6 Kernel Upgrade</h2>

<p><a href=
"http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/README_26.txt?download">
This article</a> will get you started with the 2.6 kernel if you
are currently running Red Hat 8 or 9. You may want to take a look
at it to see what is involved. If you decide to upgrade, you will
need to configure your kernel for the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
      CONFIG_BLK_DEV_LOOP
      CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CRYPTOLOOP
      CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_586
</pre>

<p>This is done in the .config file, and you can download my config
file <a href=
"http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/souptonuts/configs-0.4.tar.gz?download">
here</a>. Just look for
kernel-2.6.8.1-i686-chirico-reiserfsacl.config in the tar.gz.</p>

<p>In addition to upgrading the kernel, you will need the latest
version of <a href=
"ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/">the Linux
utilities</a>. Currently, there is no need to patch this version.
In the past, there was a patch, but this version worked fine for
me.</p>

<p>You will also need <a href=
"ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs/reiserfsprogs-3.6.18.tar.gz">
the Reiser tools</a>.</p>

<dd>Check out tips 12, 22, and 91, on how to use ssh with rsync.
