<h3>2-cent tip: HTML conversion</h3>

<p>
If you need to convert a plain-text file to HTML - particularly code
with nice highlighting thrown in for free - try the 'TOhtml' feature in
Vim.
</p>

<p>
All you have to do is open the file that you'd like to 'HTMLize' - if
it's code, make sure that 'syntax' is set to the correct language and is
turned on (e.g., ':set syntax=perl' and ':syntax on') - and enter ':TO'
in command mode. That's it. Vim will add the correct headers, footers,
and color tags to make it all look just the way you see it when editing
it in Vim.
</p>

<p>
There's much more to it - you can do this as XML, or with CSS instead of
physical formatting, etc. The documentation for this plugin can be seen
by entering ':help TO' from command mode.
</p>

<h3>2-cent tip: More HTML fun</h3>
 
 <p>Benjamin A. Okopnik (ben at linuxgazette.net) 
 <br /> 
 Tue Jul 11 08:35:53 PDT 2006</p> 
 <em>Followed up by:  Ben, Thomas</em> 
 
<p>
One of the annoyances of converting plain text to HTML is in having to
wrap every paragraph in a pair of '&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;' tags. This task can
be
mostly eliminated by using the substitution operator in Vim; just enter
</p>

<pre class="code">
:%s#\(\s*\n\)\{2,\}#\r&lt;/p&gt;&amp;&lt;p&gt;\r#g
:%s#\(.*\n\)*#&lt;p&gt;\r&amp;\r&lt;/p&gt;#g
</pre>
<p>
in command mode.
</p>

<p>
The first expression looks for more than two newlines (possibly followed
by white space) in a row - which is how paragraphs are usually defined -
and replaces them with a newline, a paragraph closure (&lt;/p&gt;, since
it's
the end of the previous paragraph), the content that was matched in the
expression (i.e., the newlines themselves), and a start-of-paragraph
marker (&lt;p&gt;) followed by another newline. The second expression just
takes care of the first and the last paragraph markers, since they're
not included in the first algorithm.
</p>

<p>
This can also be scripted as a Vim macro in your '~/.vimrc' file, e.g.
</p>

<pre class="code">
" Mark the file with HTML paragraphs
map \H :%s#\(\s*\n\)\{2,\}#\r&lt;/p&gt;&amp;&lt;p&gt;\r#g&lt;CR&gt;:%s#\(.*\n\)*#&lt;p&gt;\r&amp;\r&lt;/p&gt;#g&lt;CR&gt;
</pre>
<p>
After adding the above, simply typing '\H' in command mode will do all
the paragraphing for you. Note that the second expression can be easily 
modified to add an HTML header and footer to provide a browser-ready
HTML file - all in one pass!
</p>

<p>
[Thomas] - In Vim7, and with using omni-completion, it gets easier than
that.  Just press:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
^XO
</pre>
<p>
For a tag, and it will complete it.   There's lots of cool tricks like
that in Vim, but it for Vim7, which is certainly not de facto.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
[[Ben]] - The last time I tried to figure out ^X mode, I got a headache. Too
many 'if's. If I want tag completion, I'll just source my little 'html.vim'
file, which includes, in part:
</p>


<blockquote>
<pre class="code">
" Make HTML tag:
"	Insert mode		Command mode
"	tag^K			&lt;tag&gt;\n&lt;/tag&gt;
"	tag^L			&lt;tag&gt;
"	&lt;tag&gt;...^E		&lt;tag&gt;line&lt;/tag&gt; &lt;tag&gt;...&lt;/tag&gt;
"
imap &lt;C-k&gt; &lt;Esc&gt;yiwi&lt;&lt;Esc&gt;ea&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;/&lt;C-r&gt;"&gt;&lt;Up&gt;&lt;End&gt;
imap &lt;C-l&gt;	&lt;Esc&gt;yiwi&lt;&lt;Esc&gt;ea&gt;
imap &lt;C-e&gt;	&lt;Esc&gt;T&lt;yiwA&lt;/&lt;C-r&gt;"&gt;
map &lt;C-e&gt;	m`T&lt;yiw``i&lt;/&lt;C-r&gt;"&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h3>2cent-tip: Disabling Javascript in Firefox with a blacklist</h3>
 
 <p>Jason Creighton (jcreigh at gmail.com) 
 <br /> 
 Wed Jul 12 19:22:28 PDT 2006</p> 
  
 
<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
I wanted to disable Javascript for one particular site, but the de facto
Javascript blocking extension, NoScript, works by whitelisting instead
of blacklisting. Undoubtedly better security practice, but I'm too lazy
to do that. It took me a bit of time to find the answer, so I thought
I'd post it here for posterity.
</p>

<p>
All you need to do is place the following incantation in your user.js:
</p>

<pre class="code">
user_pref("capability.policy.policynames", "nojs");
user_pref("capability.policy.nojs.sites", "http://site1.com http://site2.com");
user_pref("capability.policy.nojs.javascript.enabled", "noAccess");
</pre>
<p> ...with "http://site1.com" and "http://site2.com" replaced with the
actual sites for which you want to disable Javascript, of course. This
example was taken from
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/ConfigPolicy.html">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/ConfigPolicy.html</a>,
which has many other examples and information regarding setting security
policies in Firefox.  </p>

<h3>2-cent Tip: Randomizing a playlist</h3>
 
 <p>Benjamin A. Okopnik (ben at linuxgazette.net) 
 <br /> 
 Fri Jul 14 05:32:29 PDT 2006</p> 
  
 
<p>
Well, this isn't just for playlists - but that's what I'm playing around
with this morning, and I can't think of too many other reasons to
randomize a file (unless it's to scramble a political campaign speech;
it's very amusing to see them make just as much sense as they did
originally...)
</p>

<p>
In any case, this is one of those places where Perl comes in very useful
indeed:
</p>

<pre class="code">
perl -we 'print sort { int( rand 2 ) * 2 - 1 } &lt;&gt;' list.m3u &gt; random.m3u
</pre>
<p>
Conversely, for more features in your randomness, you could install Adam
Rosi-Kessel's 'randomplay':
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://adam.rosi-kessel.org/weblog/free_software/code/randomplay.html">http://adam.rosi-kessel.org/weblog/free_software/code/randomplay.html</a>
</p>

<p>
(If you use Debian, it's already available as a package.)

<h3>2 Cent Tip: vnc2swf - a cross-platform screen recording tool developed by Yusuke Shinyama</h3>
 
 <p>Peter Knaggs (peter.knaggs at gmail.com) 
 <br /> 
 Thu Jul 20 20:20:16 PDT 2006</p> 
  
 
<p>
<a href="http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TightVNC#Welcome_to_Hollywood_Recording_y">http://www.penlug.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/TightVNC#Welcome_to_Hollywood_Recording_y</a>
</p>

<p>
vnc2swf is a cross-platform screen recording tool developed by Yusuke
Shinyama. It's a way to record your VNC session as an Adobe/Macromedia
Shockwave Flash animation format file (swf), so that you can later
play it back in Firefox, or using a standalone flash player e.g. gnash
or swfdec or gplflash. For Debian stable, to build vnc2swf proceed
something like this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev
  sudo apt-get install libxaw7-dev
  wget http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/vnc2swf-0.5.0.tar.gz
  tar zxvf vnc2swf-0.5.0.tar.gz
  cd vnc2swf-0.5.0
  ./configure
  make
  ./vnc2swf -startrecording outfile.swf your_vnc_server:1 &gt; outfile.html
</pre>
<p>
This will bring up a VNC client which is recording everything from
your VNC server into the outfile.swf and once you quit by pressing F8
Q it will also build outfile.html which you can open in Firefox to
review your captured animation, or should I say your next blockbuster.
</p>

<p>
Update: The Python version of vnc2swf includes a nifty sliding search
bar at the bottom of your masterpiece, so that you can seek (and your
audience can skip over any less-than stellar segments of your
creation). For Debian stable, we can get it installed something like
this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
  sudo apt-get install python2.3-tk
  sudo apt-get install python-pygame
  wget http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/pyvnc2swf-0.8.2.tar.gz
  tar zxvf pyvnc2swf-0.8.2.tar.gz
  cd pyvnc2swf-0.8.2
  ./vnc2swf.py
</pre>
<p>
This brings up a nice friendly dialog box, with a "Start" button,
which initiates the recording of the VNC server session, so you just
control the VNC session you're recording using your regular VNC
viewer.

<h3>2 Cent Tip: Excel files</h3>
 
 <p>Kapil Hari Paranjape (kapil at imsc.res.in) 
 <br /> 
 Thu Jul 27 04:25:46 PDT 2006</p> 
  
 
<p>
Hello,
</p>

<p>
If (like me) you have people who send you worthwhile information
as ".xls" (MS Excel) files <strong>and</strong> you want to handle everything in
"text mode", then read on.
</p>

<p>
1. Debian package "catdoc" contains the utility "xls2csv". <strong>xls2csv
file.xls &gt; file.csv</strong>	converts the file into "comma separated
values" format.  This is still not much use since people who use Excel
assume that you understand "spread sheets". <br>
2. Debian package "sc" contains the utilities "psc" and "sc". <strong>psc -L
-k -d',' &lt; file.csv &gt; file.sc</strong> converts this file into the
"sc" input format.  The "sc" text-mode spreadsheet can be used to edit it
("man sc" is your friend here). You can even save it to a LaTeX table.
</p>

<p>
Seems like too much work? I really have to get used to OpenOffice one
of these days!
</p>
