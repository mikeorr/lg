<h1>Tips on Using Unicode with C/C++</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/pfeiffer.html">Ren&eacute; Pfeiffer</a></b></p>

<p>
Recently I did some programming and had to deal with text documents stored
into C++ strings and C memory regions. Since I had no need for elaborate
string functions I thought I'd get away with a few pointers to string
objects and be done with it. It took me some days to turn my code from an
anagram generator into something useful (even though I like anagrams). Let
me tell you what to keep in mind when dealing with Unicode in C/C++ code.
</p>

<h3>
Encodings and Character Sets
</h3>

<p>

Character sets are sets of characters. This sounds rather tautological, but
you have to keep in mind that computers usually use a certain set of
characters that can be displayed. Usually this restriction is due to the
fonts used or to the representation of characters as offsets of specific
length. If someone gives you a string and tells you the character set that
has been used, you will most certainly need to know which encoding was used
to write the string into memory. Why is that so important? Well, a single
character can be represented by more than one byte. The character encoding
determines how many bytes will be used to represent one character. The
standard choices are as follows:

</p>

<ul>
<li> one byte</li>
<li> two byte</li>
<li> four byte</li>
<li> multiple bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>
The one byte per character notation is well known and works for most text
and character sets (such as US ASCII or the ISO-8859 family). Two bytes per
character is used by the UTF-16 encoding, also known as 16-bit Unicode
Transformation Format. Four bytes per character is used with the UTF-32
encoding (32-bit Unicode Transformation Format). Multiple bytes, meaning
characters encoded by a variable number of bytes, is the encoding used with
UTF-7 and UTF-8 (again the 7 and the 8 denote the number of bits used).
UTF-8 uses escape sequences to indicate whether the encoded character uses
1, 2, 3 or 4 bytes; UTF-7 uses different escape sequences and ensures that
every single character in the entire string always uses 7 bits per byte. If
you want to explore UTF-8, there's a command line tool called
<tt>unicode</tt> that lets you display the byte sequences of certain
characters. Make sure your terminal can handle UTF-8 and has a font with
the characters you want to display.
</p>

<p>
I deliberately didn't mention Unicode since it is a standard (ISO/IEC 10646
to be exact) and not simply an encoding; Unicode describes a lot more than
just the encoding.
</p>

<h3>
Strings in C/C++
</h3>

<p>
C doesn't care about the encoding as long as the string consists of a
sequence of bytes with a null byte at the end. You only need to deal with
encoding if you want to determine the length of the string in terms of
characters or if you wish to do string manipulations. As long as you are
happy with copying bytes around, there's no difference between a UTF-8 and
ISO-8859-15 string in C.
</p>

<p>
In C++ things look a bit different. Strings are now objects. There is no
such things as a null byte at the end since the string object "knows" how
many bytes it contains. Apart from this fact, dealing with strings is
similar to C: you may copy strings in (almost) any encoding and never
notice it. However, there is one exception which I will describe shortly.
</p>

<h3>Wide Characters and Wide Strings</h3>

<p>
C and C++ have special types and objects to deal with so-called "wide
characters". When I talked about strings, I implicitly meant UTF-8 or
ISO-8859 class encodings. What about UTF-16 or UTF-32? UTF-16 and UTF-32
are different from the usual string notation because they use,
respectively, two and four bytes per character. These encodings must be
handled properly because the characters depend on the endianness given by
the CPU. UTF-8 is somewhat endianness-agnostic because despite the
multibyte sequences an UTF-8 string is still handled as a
one-byte-per-character string, meaning it is copied byte-wise.
</p>

<p>
Wide characters use the type <tt>wchar_t</tt> according to the ISO C90
standard.  In C++, there are wide string classes for representing string
objects and performing wide character I/O such as reading or writing
from/to a file. String literals must be marked with a prefixed
<strong>L</strong>.
</p>

<pre>
if ( file_has_content ) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "DEBUG: Document " &lt;&lt; file_document-&gt;toString() &lt;&lt; endl;
    wprintf( L"DEBUG: printf -&gt; %s\n", file_document-&gt;toString() );
}
</pre>

<p>
So what's the size of a <tt>wchar_t</tt> then? 2 or 4 byte? The answer is
<em>yes</em> - that is, the standards don't specify an exact length. The
Unicode 4.0 standard says that <i>"ANSI/ISO C leaves the semantics of the
wide character set to the specific implementation but requires that the
characters from the portable C execution set correspond to their wide
character equivalents by zero extension."</i> Furthermore, the standard
specifies: <i>"The width of wchar_t is compiler-specific and can be as
small as 8 bits. Consequently, programs that need to be portable across any
C or C++ compiler should not use wchar_t for storing Unicode text. The
wchar_t type is intended for storing compiler-defined wide characters,
which may be Unicode characters in some compilers."</i>
</p>

<p>
This means that a UNIX-like operating system will usually use 4 bytes (it's
best to verify this by using <tt>sizeof()</tt>). If you use the
Microsoft&reg; Wind0ws API, you end up with 2 bytes per <tt>wchar_t</tt>.
That's great, isn't it?  So whatever you do, make sure you deal with
strings in a consistent way and don't cast your data to death. Casting a
pointer doesn't translate the string into another encoding. There are
conversion functions that can do these transformations (<tt>iconv()</tt> or
the UTF-8 Codecvt Facet from the Boost library for example). Choose a
correct data type and make sure that this data type matches the encoding
you wish/have to use.
</p>

<p>
One side note about converting data from one encoding to another: avoid it
if at all possible. Use the correct data type for your variables and try to
"get the data right" from the beginning. If you need to read text files
encoded in UTF-8 from disk into a string buffer, use the wide stream I/O
classes from the C++ library and copy the data into a wide string. This
saves you the hassle of converting UTF-8 to UTF-16/UTF-32. Here is a little
code snippet that reads a file into a dynamically allocated C++ wide
string:
</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
wchar_t *file_content;
ifstream::pos_type file_size;
wifstream file_stream;
string file_temporary;
 
file_stream.open( file_temporary.c_str(), ios_base::in | ios_base::binary | ios_base::ate );
if ( file_stream.is_open() ) {
    file_size = file_stream.tellg();
    file_content = new wchar_t[file_size];
    file_stream.seekg( 0, ios_base::beg );
    file_stream.read( file_content, (streamsize)file_size );
    file_stream.close();
}
</pre>

<p>
Make sure you treat files with Unicode content as binary in order to avoid
"premature conversion".  The example above still has one weakness - the
file name is a "normal" string. If you have file names with special
characters you have to check your locale settings and determine how to
encode these special characters.
</p>

<h3>Portable Libraries and TCHAR</h3>

<p>
If you use portable C/C++ libraries in your code, you may have noticed the
<tt>TCHAR</tt> data type in the header files. Any code that is intended to
run on Microsoft&reg; Wind0ws and has to deal with Unicode will most
certainly use the <tt>TCHAR</tt> data type. <tt>TCHAR</tt> will be
translated into a wide character data type when compiling this code with
the GNU C Compiler (most portable libraries define <tt>TCHAR</tt> in their
headers and refer to <tt>wchar_t</tt>). This, in fact, was how I turned my
C++ program into an anagram generator: I used standard C++ strings filled
with UTF-8 and fed the data with pointers casted to <tt>wchar_t</tt> to
library functions. UTF-8 data interpreted as UTF-32 equals garbage (but it
is tremendously useful for obfuscation of data and bugs).
</p>

<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>

<p>
This article was meant to give a short overview; that's the reason for the
many links to other resources.  I deliberately left out conversion
functions and locale settings (mainly because of a lack of example code).
You also have to remember the extra storage required for wide strings -
i.e. up to four times more than a standard string. This may be important if
you have a lot of strings or big string buffers. So I hope you avoid some
of the errors I ran into, or at least come up with more creative ones.

<p>
Ren&eacute; was born in the year of Atari's founding and the release of the game Pong.
Since his early youth he started taking things apart to see how they work. He
couldn't even pass construction sites without looking for electrical wires that
might seem interesting. The interest in computing began when his grandfather
bought him a 4-bit microcontroller with 256 byte RAM and a 4096 byte operating
system, forcing him to learn assembler before any other language.
</p>

<p>
After finishing school he went to university in order to study physics. He then
collected experiences with a C64, a C128, two Amigas, DEC's Ultrix, OpenVMS and
finally GNU/Linux on a PC in 1997. He is using Linux since this day and still
likes to take things apart und put them together again. Freedom of tinkering
brought him close to the Free Software movement, where he puts some effort into
the right to understand how things work. He is also involved with civil liberty
groups focusing on digital rights.
</p>

<p>
Since 1999 he is offering his skills as a freelancer. His main activities
include system/network administration, scripting and consulting. In 2001 he
started to give lectures on computer security at the Technikum Wien. Apart from
staring into computer monitors, inspecting hardware and talking to network
equipment he is fond of scuba diving, writing, or photographing with his digital
camera. He would like to have a go at storytelling and roleplaying again as soon
as he finds some more spare time on his backup devices.
