&gt; Hello Ben Okopnik,
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday I bumped into a su (substitute user) permission error similar
&gt; to your Apr. 2000 article, "Cannot execute /bin/bash: Permission denied".
&gt; I was attempting to run an expect script in non-root user mode on Fedora 8:
&gt; 
&gt;   su netter -c "expect try.exp"
&gt; 
&gt; and it failed:
&gt; 
&gt;   couldn't read file "try.exp": permission denied
&gt; 
&gt; No problem if I run:
&gt;   su root -c "expect try.exp"
&gt;   expect try.exp
&gt; 
&gt; I pored over permission related avenues for the whole day and failed.
&gt; It was around midnight when I googled upon your article that my hope was
&gt; rekindled.
&gt; 
&gt; So the first thing coming into work today...
&gt; Using your approach (especially strace), I found the execution bit for others
&gt; for /root
&gt; was not set.  After setting it, my non-root mode command string started to
&gt; work!
</pre>

<p>
That's actually not a good solution; the correct permissions for 
/root are 0700. Setting it to 0701, as you have, allows other users to
enter that directory - a really bad idea!
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Jotunheim:~$ ls -ld /root
drwx------ 11 root root 4096 2011-03-10 21:14 /root
ben@Jotunheim:~$ head -n 1 /root/.bashrc
head: cannot open `/root/.bashrc' for reading: Permission denied
</pre>

<p>
OK, this is what's supposed to happen. But here's what happens when I
change the permissions as you specified:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
ben@Jotunheim:~$ sudo chmod 0701 /root
[sudo] password for ben: 
ben@Jotunheim:~$ head -n 1 /root/.bashrc
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
</pre>

<p>
Whoops...
</p>

<p>
I suspect that the right solution for you would be to put 'try.exp'
somewhere other than /root; then you won't have to do anything with
those permissions (other than hopefully set them back as quickly as
possible.)

I assume that you wanted to send this question to The Answer Gang rather
than asking me for a private consult (those tend to be expensive <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">, so
I've forwarded it there. Please direct any further emails about it there

&gt; Dear Ben Okopnik,
&gt;  
&gt; I've read your article "Installing Perl Modules as a Non-Root User", and
&gt; regarding including the "myperl" in @INC" it worked. But now I have a problem,
&gt; that maybe you can help.
&gt; I▓m trying to install a local module in a webserver that isn▓t mine. I get no
&gt; error with the following Makefile.PL
</pre>

<p>
Do you mean when you run 'make', 'make test', 'make install', or all of
them?
</p>


<pre>
&gt; CODE:
&gt;  #!/usr/local/bin/perl
&gt; use 5.008007;
&gt; use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
&gt; # See lib/ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm for details of how to influence
&gt; # the contents of the Makefile that is written.
&gt; WriteMakefile(
&gt;     NAME              =&gt; 'Kepler',
&gt;     VERSION_FROM      =&gt; 'lib/Kepler.pm', # finds $VERSION
&gt;     PREREQ_PM         =&gt; {}, # e.g., Module::Name =&gt; 1.1
&gt;     ($] &gt;= 5.005 ?     ## Add these new keywords supported since 5.005
&gt;       (ABSTRACT_FROM  =&gt; 'lib/Kepler.pm', # retrieve abstract from module
&gt;        AUTHOR         =&gt; 'Rui Fernandes &lt;rui.kepler@gmail.com&gt;') : ()),
&gt;     LIBS              =&gt; ['-L/home/username/usr/local/lib -lswe'], # e.g.,
&gt; '-lm'
&gt; #    LIBS              =&gt; ['-lswe'], # e.g., '-lm'
&gt;     DEFINE            =&gt; '', # e.g., '-DHAVE_SOMETHING'
&gt;     INC               =&gt; '-I/home/username/usr/local/include', # e.g., '-I. -I/
&gt; usr/include/other'
&gt;     INSTALL_BASE      =&gt; '/home/username/myperl',
&gt; #    DISTVNAME         =&gt; 'perl_kepler', #
&gt;  # Un-comment this if you add C files to link with later:
&gt;     # OBJECT            =&gt; '$(O_FILES)', # link all the C files too
&gt; );
&gt;  
&gt; END CODE
&gt;  
&gt; But when I run the test script, the module isn't found, not even in the "myperl
&gt; /lib" directory.
</pre>

<p>
I'm having trouble parsing that last sentence. Do you mean the module is
actually not in myperl/lib, or does your test script not find it?
</p>

<p>
I suspect that it's the latter. If that's the case, then what's
happening is that your web server isn't seeing the correct path. This
often happens because the actual path to your home directory is not
necessarily the same thing as you see when you log in via, say, SSH. For
example, in one of my former webservers, the path reported by 'pwd' when
I was in my home directory was '/home/ben' - but the <strong>real</strong> path was
something like '/homepages/41/d322536930/'. As a result, using
'/home/ben/myperl' as part of my 'use lib' statement was worthless: the
web server didn't know anything about a path like that.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the easiest way to find out what the server is seeing as your
real path is to look at the server environment. Here's an easy way to do
that with Perl:

<p>
I've always wondered why "ls" doesn't just have this as an option. Got
tired of wondering, so I went ahead and wrote it.
</p>

<p>
This script is intended to be a drop-in replacement for "ls" - in other
words, just put it somewhere accessible and alias it to 'ls'. It takes
all the same options that 'ls' does (no wonder; it simply passes the
entire argument string to 'ls'), and works in the same way, unless the
first option that you specify - and it must be specified by itself - is
"-O" (capital "o", not a zero.) In that case, it does all the same stuff
but reformats the output a little - just the filetype/permissions
section. I haven't done a huge amount of testing on it, so it might be
fragile in some unexpected places (reports would be appreciated).  Seems
OK, though, so I'm releasing it to the unsuspecting world. Enjoy.

&gt; My 2-cents:  USB is being polled.

<p>
You're probably right - and very likely, it's getting polled very
rapidly, given the task. I'm not sure what could be done about that -
some kernel setting, perhaps?

<pre>
&gt; strace -p ....  might give you some clues too.

<p>
The question is, what would I attach it to? 'rsync' wouldn't make a
whole lot of sense, since it's not involved in USB polling.

Hi,
     I had a horror story similar to Ben's one, about two years ago. I 
backed up a PC and reinstalled the OS with the backup usb disk still 
attached. The OS I was reinstalling was a version of Windows (2000 or 
XP, I don't remember right now). When the partition creation screen 
appeared, the list items looked a bit different from what I was 
expecting, but as soon as I realized why, my fingers had already pressed 
the keys, deleting the existing partitions and creating a new ntfs one. 
Luckily, I stopped just before the "quick format" command...
Searching the 'net for data recovery software, I came across TestDisk, 
which is target at partition table recovery. I was lucky enough to have 
wiped out only that portion of the usb disk, so in less than an hour I 
was able to regain access to the all of my data.
Since then I always "safely remove" usb disks from the machine before 
doing anything potentially dangerous, and check "fdisk -l" at least 
three times before deciding that the arguments to "dd" are written 
correctly...

Hi Francis,
</p>


<p>
--&gt;I see one possible typo in a not-yet-much-used one:
--&gt;
--&gt;"""
--&gt;I have just changed this alias to
--&gt;
--&gt;   alias w '(pwd; /bin/pwd ) | uniq; df -h | tail -1'
--&gt;
--&gt;I often also want to know whether I'm on a local disk or not.
--&gt;"""
--&gt;
--&gt;That probably wants to be "df -h ." (at least on recent-ish Debian and
--&gt;RedHat systems).
</p>

<p>
Absolutely correct. Thanks for that.
</p>


<p>
--&gt;And if you are likely to be on a system where the "Filesystem"
--&gt;name is quite long (such as "/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-LogVol00"), then
--&gt;using "tail -n +2" might be handy too -- but I can't comment on the
--&gt;portability/compatibility of that option across systems.
</p>

<p>
Perfect!
</p>

<p>
Another example of "write in haste, repent at leisure." I should stick
to presenting the tried and true - and forget about improvising.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your fixes. I will adjust my files immediately.
</p>


<p>
Cheers,
Henry

<h3>LG - what's next?</h3>

<p>
Hello, all -
</p>

<p>
After a number of years of running LG, I've reached a stopping point: I
can't continue producing it, for a variety of interconnected reasons. In
short, the group of people currently involved in making LG happen has
become so small that almost the entire thing has fallen on me - and the
technical side of producing it is so complicated that my current level
of business and other life involvement does not leave me with enough
spare time to do it. As a result, there was no LG issue for this month -
and despite giving it my best shot over the past two weeks, I have still
not managed to release one.
</p>

<p>
That seems to me to be an extraordinarily clear signal that the time has
come for me to step down. Whether that means that someone else gets to
take over, or whether LG simply ends at this point, I don't know. I've
tried to prevent the latter... but it appears that I have reached the
end of what I can do in that regard. Whether it continues or not has to
become someone else's concern. I am no longer able to carry the load.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure that someone with better management skills than mine could
organize and structure a working team that would distribute the load;
someone with more time could replace the totally outdated and rather
arcane production system, which currently takes many hours of work to
release an issue (by contrast, a CMS such as WordPress could easily be
configured to replicate the LG site structure, and production - as well
as adding proofreaders and editors - would become a trivial matter
rather than the complicated and fragile SVN-based system currently in
place.) I would be happy to advise whoever takes over, assuming that
someone does.
</p>

<p>
The current state, however, is that LG is no longer being actively
produced by me. My most sincere apologies to anyone that I have let
down.

<p>
Hi, all -
</p>

<p>
I'm hoping that someone here has experience in setting up SVN. I'm
running into several issues in setting it up for LG... frankly, it's
mostly my own mental state more than anything else; 'buffer full' at the
moment. Unsurprising, after a couple of weeks of full-time training
course development, setting up LG in its new home, and learning a new
language during all that. My brain is pretty cooked, and I desperately
need a break. I'm just hoping that someone here has a shortcut; it
shouldn't be that difficult, really.
</p>

<p>
What I'd like to do is set it up so that I don't have to create a system
account for everyone who needs SVN access. We don't even need web access
to the repo; we just need our editors and proofreaders to authenticate
via whatever mechanism SVN uses, pull a copy of the repo, and check
their work back in whenever they're done with it.
</p>

<p>
Any help - and the best of all possible world would be an offer like
"I'd be happy to do it for you!" - would be <strong>very</strong> welcome.
</p>

You probably shouldn't do that. Unless you know <em>exactly</em> why you're
doing it (hint: "I want this sub to only take a single scalar argument"
is not a good reason) and what the side effects and the pitfalls are.
For the full treatment, see "perldoc perlsub". The takehome rule of
thumb is "don't". <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Yep. Thomas' advice is right on the dot; in this kind of situations,
'pack' (and often 'vec') are your very good friends.

Presuming that it did have one, and had a reasonable identifier, it
looks like your card's not readable. Assuming that there's no "protect"
switch on it - you did look for one, right? - I suspect that it has
failed. That is, it can be read enough to determine its physical
characteristics - I don't know how the two processes differ, I only know
that they do - but you can't access its storage. In other words, it's
junk.

This is, or closely related to, the thing that attracted me to Linux in
the first place. In the Windows world, you're either a user - which is
defined by a very narrow, small set of pointy-clicky skills and not much
if any understanding of the mechanisms you use - or you're some sort of
a "wizard", which gets defined in all sorts of arcane ways, mostly
meaning "knows some stuff beyond what users know." All that "stuff",
however, doesn't form any kind of a coherent whole: it was all chunks
and bits and pieces, no relation of anything to anything else. The only
choices, if you wanted more than the minimum, were 1) specialize -
meaning something like learning a certain language or a given
application, or 2) gather enough critical mass of random <strong>stuff</strong> until
you formed a gravity well of your own and could pull out some sort of a
related useful fact when a problem came along.  All very haphazard, and
somewhat akin to stumbling around in a dark dungeon until you found some
treasure or (far more likely) ran into some kind of a monster.
</p>

<p>
YOU'RE TRAPPED IN A MAZE OF TWISTY PASSAGES, ALL ALIKE, AND YOU'RE
LIKELY TO BE EATEN BY A GRUE.
</p>

<p>
(It is worth noting that I functioned in that world, professionally, for
a number of years, all the way from a wet-behind-the-ears teenage
computer repairman to working as CIO for an insurance company. This
perspective is not formed by my desire to promote Linux; quite the
opposite, if anything - I advocate Linux usage <em>because</em> I have this
perspective, which was formed by long experience.)

I generally try to avoid importing modules if there's a built-in method
that works just as well. In this case, you're importing "os" anyway, but
this also works in scripts where you don't.

<p>
The main problem with this type of script is that you have to be a
Python programmer to add a filetype/program pair. I'd suggest breaking
out the dictionary as an easily-parseable text file, or adding a simple
interface ("Unsupported filetype. What program would you like to use?")
that updates the list.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Is there any Linux command line tool which can easily do this?
</pre>

<p>
Midnight Commander is quite good at this; in fact, I've used that
functionality of 'mc' in some of my shell scripts for just this purpose.
They use a mix of regex matching, MIME-type matching, and literal
extension recognition to work with various files. E.g., the ".gz"
extension in "foo.1.gz" doesn't tell you anything about the type of file
that it is (a man page).
