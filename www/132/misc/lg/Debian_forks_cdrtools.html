&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; Some news.
&gt; 
&gt; I suppose this was bound to happen sooner or later. Debian
&gt; maintainer's J. Jaspert and E. Bloch lost patience with J. Schilling
&gt; and have forked "cdrtools" to create cdrkit. Some details at
&gt; 
&gt; 	<a href="http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/FORK">http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/FORK</a> 
&gt; 
&gt; (The forked tar.gz can be found in <a href="http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/">http://debburn.alioth.debian.org/</a>).
&gt; Other reasons for the fork can be found on
&gt; <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cdrecord">http://bugs.debian.org/cdrecord</a> and on the Linux Kernel mailing lists.
</pre>
</p>

Good for them <strong>and</strong> everyone else, I say. I've been struggling with (and
quietly cursing at) Joerg Schilling's DVD-writing software for a long
time. On the one hand, it's the only DVD-writer that I could get to work
on this strange DVD drive I have (Matshita DVD-RAM UJ-820S) - but it
would only let me write at 1x due to nothing more than some strange
conceit of the author's. As I recall from his explanation on a web page,
he had decided that the Linux /dev implementation sucks, and until it
was rewritten to be more like that of BSD, he wouldn't do anything to
make 'cdrecord' work reasonably. Elsewhere, in every instance that I've
seen him involved in a discussion about any technical issue, I was
struck by his inflexibility ("bull-headedness" would be too strong of a
term, since he is highly technically competent, but the stubborn refusal
to even consider any viewpoint other than his own was... less than
admirable.)
</p>

<p>
Now, according to the Debian bunch, he's exhibiting that same kind of
intransigence and blind adherence in an area which is clearly not his
strong point - licensing issues. [shrug] His right as the author, of
course... but this is exactly the reason that forking is such a useful
method. This is, in my opinion, as good as Open Source gets.
</p>


<p>
(BTW: has anyone else noticed that the largest, toughest, most dangerous
monster in QuakeII is called 'Jorg'? I'm just sayin'. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">))

That's our J&ouml;rg.  Or perhaps I should say "Sun Microsystems's J&ouml;rg".  
(He seems to spend pretty much all his time <em>these</em> days working on
OpenSolaris.)
</p>

<p>
Danny O'Brien blames Post-Traumatic SCSI Syndrome:
</p>

<p>
  J&ouml;rg "Just trying to make an honest" Schilling took offence at SuSE's
  changes to his GPL cdrecord application, on the grounds that they'd
  patched it so much that it wasn't really J&ouml;rg Schilling's cdrecord at
  all, but more like some sort of awful Hollywood remake, like Francis
  Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula. To fix that, he stuck in a line
  which announced to SuSE users that their vendor was "known to ship
  bastardized and defective versions of cdrecord", then put in a comment
  above that SuSE wasn't allowed to change that line. You know, just in
  case they managed to bastardized the bastardization.
</p>

<p>
  [...]
</p>

<p>
  Now, we know that the furthermost pits of hell are reserved for those
  who break licensing agreements (unless its clickthrough, where you get
  put in purgatory until the law can be clarified). But we should also
  give pause before we place the epaullettes of satan on someone who,
  let's be fair, learnt the intricacies of the SCSI bus so that we do
  not.
</p>

<p>
  Anyone who has played with SCSI knows that the interface is, frankly,
  Lovecraftian. A few terminators and DIP switches in, and you're
  constantly running saving throws for your sanity. J&ouml;rg's moment of
  alleged evil was fleeting, and he removed the restriction in the
  subsequent increment of cdrecord. Let's say that he was possessed by
  some old ide-scsi bug, and speaking in tongues at the time.
