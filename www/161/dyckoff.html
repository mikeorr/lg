<h1>Away Mission: 2008 in Review - part 3</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>


<p>
April is another Mad Month with competing tech events. Besides the
events reviewed here, there are Black Hat Europe 2009, April 14-17, in
Amsterdam, and the USENIX LEET (Large-Scale Exploits and Emergent
Threats) conference in Boston, April 21-24.
</p>

<p>
This year will feature a new major event - the Linux Collaboration Summit,
organized by the Linux Foundation. The 3rd Annual Collaboration Summit will
be co-located with the CELF Embedded Linux Conference and the Linux Storage
and Filesystem Workshop.  It occurs April 8-10 in San Francisco.  More
information is here: <a
href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit/">http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/collaboration-summit/</a>
</p>


<h3>Web 2.0 Expo and Velocity</h3>
<p>
Over the years, the Web 2.0 event has split into the Expo, for Web
production people; and the Web 2.0 Summit, for the leaders (which
operates by invitation only).  More recently, the Web 2.0 Expo has
become a forum for social networking and Web designers.
</p>

<p>
The better bet for sysadmins and Linux hackers is the O'Reilly Velocity
Conference in June, which was spun off from the Web 2.0 Expo last year by
presenters from the tech tracks who wanted a dedicated event. It was very
successful, even though the tech community was given barely 3 months
notice. If you have to choose only one or two conferences this year, and
you build or maintain data centers, Velocity should definitely be on your
short list.
</p>

<p>
For starters, all the good tech presentations were repeated at
Velocity. Many of those were expanded, and the networking
opportunities are different. Web 2.0 Expo is about the nexus of art,
Web tech, and - to some extent - marketing. Velocity is about getting
things to work at Web scale and Web velocity. It's fundamentally
nerdier.
</p>

<p>
Since social networking was a big piece of the show, there was a
social networking site for Web 2.0 Expo San Francisco, used to find and
connect with people at the conference and for general opinion mongering.
See what people said: <a href="http://webexsf2008.crowdvine.com/">http://webexsf2008.crowdvine.com/</a>
</p>

<p>
Another social networking site connected to the Web 2.0 Expo is
<a href="http://socialtext.net/web20sf">http://socialtext.net/web20sf</a>.
</p>

<p>
Praise: there is breakfast every AM - fruit, bagels, cream cheese,
juice... which stayed out through the mid-morning break.
</p>

<p>
No praise: the coffee and tea disappeared after the AM break, and 
returned only for the short mid-afternoon break. Moral? Get caffeine
early.
</p>

<p>
Conference attendees get a box lunch, each day. There were special
requests, but a lot of those got lost the first day. They also tried to
limit the number of vegetarian lunches, saying they were out temporarily.
A long line waited against the wall on Wednesday, and seemed rather
unhappy. (That seems to have been fixed on Thursday with a full table, one
of four. That's only fair, as carnivores can eat vegetarian lunches, but
vegetarians can't eat carnivore lunches.)
</p>

<p>
The sense I got from the panoply of 50-minute breakout sessions is
that more people are using open source, and using it in more
sophisticated ways for cutting-edge Web sites. There was some buzz
around OpenID and OAuth, and also around open platforms such as the
Google APIs and Google App Engine, the new Yahoo Social APIs, and lots
of wiki and community hosting sites like Vox and Movable Type.
</p>

<p>
Although mashups and social networking are "so 2007", there are also
lots of new platforms and frameworks to make it easier to roll your
own site and (attempt to) bring these technologies into the
business enterprise. Another emerging trend is the increasing interest
corporate IT is showing in these technologies.
</p>

<p>
Some session presenters, mostly from platform companies or custom
software houses, reported several large IT organizations experimenting
with Web 2.0 and letting the business execs bring in (with some
control and reservations) SaaS versions of the tools they want to
use. The demand is getting to be too big to wait another year. However,
those IT shops are trying to identify the data that needs serious
protection, and trying to quarantine just that, as enterprises become
porous and more vulnerable to penetration.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is talking about making the huge amount of data from social
networks both easier to leverage and more protected for user privacy. That
means increased use of Open Social and similar APIs and identity federation
management frameworks. The work never seems to end.
</p>

<p>
There aren't really tracks for presentations at Web 2.0, but three rooms
are set aside for "sponsored presentations". That often means a bit of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchitecture">marchitecture</a> in those
presentations, but most were hardly any different from the main
presentations, except that the presenters were from bigger companies.
</p>

<p>
The sponsor session with Adobe's Duane Nuetall was actually a very
technical discussion on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy">folksonomies</a> and
ontologies, and did not mention any Adobe products because they aren't in
the ontology business. Rather, much like the rest of us, they are
interested in using semantic technology as it matures. The
Microsoft-sponsored presentation, however, was on their new Mesh product,
and it was heavy on the marketing side.
</p>

<p>
Other praise-worthy details: The keynotes and breakout sessions
have no power taps or extension cords for users, except those built
into the fixed walls (and in very, very few rooms). I have been
bringing a 15-foot extension cord of my own to allow sitting at some
distance from the outlet if necessary, and sharing one plug with up to
3 users.  I don't know if I've inspired folks or if it's just the
zeitgeist, but I am seeing others now emulating my actions, sometimes
with only a 3-way tap. On Thursday, I saw some one with a full 
6-tap power-strip!  Bless that person.
</p>

<p>
On the last day, there was a block of sysadmin-oriented sessions, two of
them in the same room. (There it is, again, another room scheduling
issue.) As it turns out, all were to be technical presenters at the new and
upcoming O'Reilly Velocity conference in June. That conference and these
sessions took a bead on performance and capacity issues for the operations
crowd.  Seems that the O'Reilly folks understand that the interactive Web
requires more than design artists and AJAX.
</p>

<p>
Steve Souders' presentation at Web 2.0 Expo 2007 was rated #2, which isn't
that surprising since he also worked on YSlow extension for Firefox.
Formerly the head performance guy at Yahoo, and now doing a similar job at
Google, he is focused on the the client side or front end of Web
transactions.  He already has a recent O'Reilly book out on "Web Site
Performance" that provided part of his talk at the 2007 Web 2.0 conference,
and is now preparing a second book, which covers the user side of the
equation.
</p>

<p>
His "Even Faster Web Sites" presentation was a gem, as was its follow-up at
Velocity, a few months later. I'll distill a little of it here. Souders'
research shows that most major sites spend 80-95% of their net time on
front-end processing and browser issues. It's gotten to this state due to
the ubiquity of JavaScript and the proliferation of scattered, individual
scripts.
</p>

<p>
Even a 50% improvement on back-end performance yields only 5-10% gain for
the user. However, simple changes in a few lines of source code can work
wonders. According to Souders, you can easily get a 25% advantage in page
load times by applying 14 performance rules.  Just pick a few appropriate
ones to get a fair gain. Here are a few:
</p>

<ol>
<li> Make fewer HTTP requests, or bundle them up for less network delay.
<li> Use a CDN (content distribution network - use edge delivery as Akamai 
     does).
<li> Add an Expires header, especially with a CDN.
<li> gzip components.
<li> Use YSlow and Firebug to test the load times and performance of 
     individual items.
<li> Since scripts block other content downloading - move 'em to the end 
     of the page code.
<li> Use multiple content domains for even faster downloads.
</ol>

<p>
The last three points were subjects for the second half of the
presentation. There are multiple JavaScript-Fu techniques to break up
the monolithic script payloads. One of these calls for making scripts
individual elements in the DOM (used at MSN.com.) Others use separate
script payloads in different Iframes, or XHR injection (which may be
best for the same domain) and no ordering of the scripts. Another
option is to move some scripts to an external script, which can allow
parallel downloads. Souders also suggests ordering the scripts so they
can be executed in the order they're received.
</p>

<p>
See slide 31 from his presentation, showing the effect of script
loading and execution on a Wikipedia page here:
<a href="misc/dyckoff/Script-Load-Wikipedia.otp">misc/dyckoff/Script-Load-Wikipedia.otp</a>
</p>

<p>
For the full description of these techniques with code samples and a
decision tree for selection of the most suitable in your environment,

</p>

<p>
Jesse Robbins and Artur Bergman of O'Reilly Radar presented an entertaining
and informative review of major failures, disasters, and painful lessons
learned in the past year. Check it out here: <a
href="http://www.web2expo.com/webexsf2008/public/schedule/detail/1769">Failure
Happens: What Broke Since Last Year (and What We Learned from It)</a>
</p>


<p>
The conference party was an outside event... literally. It was a pub crawl
through the restaurants and bars of the artsy, techy San Francisco South
Park area - a brilliant stroke for pleasing the 30-something and
20-something crowd. The crawl had some sprawl and also was over 5 blocks
from the Convention Center on a cold, foggy night.  With a bag on each
shoulder - a laptop bag and a tote with mags and swag - I opted for an
early night and the faster subway ride home. That may have been the better
choice, since many pub crawlers missed the earlier Friday AM sessions.
</p>

<p>
If Web design or social networking sites are your bag, then this is a
must-attend event.  However, if you are working the infrastructure and
biting the scaling bullet, you might take a shine to the Velocity
conference. Some people attend both.
</p>


<h3>RSA for Security Trends</h3>

<p>
Still one of the first-tier security events, RSA 2009 returns to San
Francisco the same week as the MySQL conference in Santa Clara. Both
are excellent, and have different audiences.
</p>

<p>
Alert: Last year (and 2009 as well), both TCG (Trusted Computing
Group) and several identity communities under the auspices of the
Liberty Alliance and Concordia Project held separate semi-public
sessions on the first day of the RSA conference. The identity event
includes representatives from major initiatives in the global identity
sector, and is focused on how the identity industry can deliver new
benefits to users of enterprise and Web 2.0 identity-enabled
applications and services.
</p>

<p>
These sessions are open to all registrants, which should include expo
pass holders.  Since that day was (and continues to be) committed to
tutorials, this is effectively a free extension to the conference.
However, pre-registration is a requirement.
</p>

<p>
For 2008, the identity management workshop was titled, "Identity
Federation &amp; Web Services: Happening Today - Enabling Tomorrow".
Materials from that event are here:
<a href="http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/Concordia_workshop_RSA_2008_notes">http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/Concordia_workshop_RSA_2008_notes</a>
and the actual slide deck is here:
<a href="http://projectconcordia.org/images/7/76/Concordia-Apr2008-wiki.pdf">http://projectconcordia.org/images/7/76/Concordia-Apr2008-wiki.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>
For 2009, the event is longer - 8 am to 5 pm - and is titled,
"Harnessing the Power of Digital Identity: 2009 and the Promising Road
Ahead". It is supposed to be open to the public. A detailed workshop
agenda and registration information is available at
<a href="http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/April_20_pre-conference_workshop">http://projectconcordia.org/index.php/April_20_pre-conference_workshop</a>
</p>

<p>
At the separate TCG session, the room was broken up into a main area
and four mini-classrooms where network and data security presentations
could be given hourly. I believe they also provided box lunches and a
USB drive with some of the presentation materials. The slide deck for
the TCG 2008 presentation is here:
<a href="https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/news/events/rsa_2008/">https://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/news/events/rsa_2008/</a>.
</p>

<p>
I heard that the attendance was up for RSA 2008, after 2 or 3 years of
modest decline. Pre-conference, the number was projected to be 17,000
 - quite respectable. I hope they don't suffer a significant decline
in this extreme recession.
</p>

<p>
I found the conference very well organized, with things to do for both
full attendees and expo-only types. There was a hacker smack-down
contest setup in the main corridor, and adjacent to it was a
Jeopardy-like contest during day hours.
</p>

<p>
There was also the "crypto commons" lounge with plenty of space to sit down
and charge up that laptop between conference sessions. Rows of tables
allowed more focused work, and there were Ethernet drops too.
</p>

<p>
Most of the tracks were exclusively in single rooms, which minimized travel
for attendees focused on a single area. Besides the two concurrent Hacker
Tracks, there was an ID Management track, a very popular developer security
track, a business track, a sponsor track for items that didn't rate a
keynote, and also a new legal track. Of course, similar content might
appear in different tracks, like presentations on XACML by Oasis Members.
</p>

<p>
One highlight of RSA 2008 was the Cyber Security Town Hall meeting,
open to expo attendees as well. For 2008, this featured a
presentation by Greg Garcia, the Department of Homeland Security
Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Telecommunications (who also
spoke in 2007). Garcia spoke on the then recent Cyberstorm II exercise
results. Unlike Cyberstorm I, which was more like a board game, this
was a real-time cyber-attack scenario. The exercise planning began in
2007 and culminated in March of 2008, involving 40 companies, 9
states, and 5 countries (Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, and
the UK). One thing DHS learned from the effort, Garcia said, was just
how important critical vendors and support staff are in an
international emergency. This sentiment was echoed by reps from EMC
and Microsoft at a participant panel after Garcia's talk.  Collect
business cards from your peers at events like RSA, and be prepared for
cyber-disruption, they advised.
</p>

<p>
Presentations and other conference materials for RSA 2008 are locked
up, but many presenters post their own presentations on-line. So,
looking up the presenter and the presentation title may turn up a
presentation you want. This link offers several presentations from RSA
conferences here and in Europe, including "Darwin and Security: What
Evolution Tells Us About the Past and Future of Security:
<a href="http://www.cryptography.com/research/presentations.html">http://www.cryptography.com/research/presentations.html</a>
</p>

<p>
The RSA conference archives have articles and podcasts that are
public.  See it here:
<a href="https://365.rsaconference.com/community/rsaconference_archives">https://365.rsaconference.com/community/rsaconference_archives</a>
</p>

<p>
Also see this link:  Podcast Series: RSA Conference 2008
<a href="https://365.rsaconference.com/blogs/podcast_series_rsa_conference_2008">https://365.rsaconference.com/blogs/podcast_series_rsa_conference_2008</a>
</p>

<p>
I'd also recommend Bryan Sullivan's highly rated presentation from RSA
Conference 2008 on "AJAX Security".  This is an update of the RSA 2008 talk
which was called: "AJAX applications: A blueprint for Disaster" due to the
greatly expanded attack surface.
</p>

<p>
I do have some quibbles about the once spectacular "Cryptographers
Bash", the night before the last day.  I don't know if the ballrooms at
the Marriott Hotel were collectively smaller than the Treasure Island
venue, but the crowd seemed much smaller and the food stations had only
a few variations repeated in all the ballrooms.  It seemed like a step
or two down from previous bashes.
</p>

<p>
While the variety of food and entertainment was already much more
limited, some crazy person thought it best to hold back the desserts
until after 9 pm, long after a sizable chunk of party-goers had
departed to sleep off alcoholic and carnivorous excesses. Perhaps this
reflected some new-felt economy measures, but for the folks who had
eaten something before, it was an excessive wait.  Many of us just
left before they rolled out the sweets.
</p>

<p>
End day end-game: 3 track sessions without a break in the AM, and 2
keynotes in the afternoon. The first keynote featured Hugh Thompson in his
techno-celebrity incarnation. He had also closed out RSA 2007.
</p>

<p>
The real closing honor went to Al Gore and his Green Energy message.
Unfortunately, Gore's keynote was contractually a non-Press event. That
meant all bloggers, tech writers, and local news hacks were escorted out
before he spoke - by security staff. And that included this lowly <em>Linux
Gazette</em> reporter. Of course, some press people had obtained separate
expo passes, and snuck in anyway.
</p>

<p>
That event was not recorded or posted publicly, but Gore also spoke
at the Web 2.0 Summit last November, and that video is in the
conference archive.  Check it out here:
<a href="http://www.web2summit.com/web2008/public/schedule/detail/5068">http://www.web2summit.com/web2008/public/schedule/detail/5068</a>
</p>


<h3>MySQL - No Disappointments</h3>

<p>
The MySQL user conference never disappoints, and is usually tightly
scheduled and well-organized. It features keynotes by technologists and
researchers, and presentations by the MySQL development team and key
partners.  With nearly 2,000 attendees, this is the probably the world's
largest community event for open source database developers and users.
</p>

<p>
Last year's event followed soon after Sun's purchase of MySQL, but the
conference was substantially unchanged.  Former CEO Marten Mickos
addressed concerns and anxieties during and after his keynote, noting
that Sun provided the resources that MySQL needed at that stage of its
growth.
</p>

<p>
Mickos had tripped off concern in the blogosphere and on Slashdot that
MySQL was moving in a proprietary direction by mentioning that "commercial
extensions" planned for 6.0 would only be available to subscribers to
the enterprise edition of MySQL 6.  However, these management additions are
really an outgrowth of the MySQL Network subscription for enterprise
users, and have little impact on the user community.
</p>

<p>
Rick Falkvinge, of Swedish Pirate Party, gave a challenging keynote on
"Copyright Regime vs. Civil Liberties" on the second day. He and his
party consider modern copyrights and their legal regime a threat to
civil liberties, taken from a very long historical viewpoint.
</p>

<p>
Recounting the battles between the medieval church and printing press, and
later the exclusive charter to London printing guild by Henry VIII,
Falkvinge described our rules of intellectual property as protections
almost entirely for the publishers, not the creators. So, it seems not that
much has changed in over 300 years.
</p>

<p>
Originally, copyrights were about public use and public performances of
copyrighted materials.  Now, IP owners like record companies are arguing
against messenger immunity, an idea going back to the Roman Empire. They
are also arguing for the right to inspect private e-mail and to pierce
postal secrets and common carrier privacy. He argued that this undermines
whistle-blowers and freedom of press, which need privacy to protect these
"private" communications. 
</p>

<p>
Some presentations at the user conference dealt with performance
improvements and tuning in the then-new 5.1 release of MySQL, and
other sessions discussed planning for a future 6.0 release, probably
after 2010. That will probably be a major discussion point at the
2009 MySQL user conference.  Here is the schedule for the upcoming
2009 conference:
<a href="http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/grid">http://en.oreilly.com/mysql2009/public/schedule/grid</a>
</p>

<p>
One potentially interesting session for 2009 talks is on "Drizzle", a fork
of the MySQL server targeted at Web development and cloud computing.  Monty
Taylor, a very senior MySQL/Sun engineer, is working on it full time.
Drizzle is also discussed at a panel session discussing the MySQL roadmap.
Check out the keynotes and presentations at the O'Reilly archives. (See
below.)

quickly, and these are publicly accessible.
