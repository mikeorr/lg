Hi All,
</p>

<p>
I thought I would sure this little perl script that will remove the 
comments out of a configuration file. 
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
# Thomas Bonham
# 06/06/08
 
if($#ARGV !=0) {
    print "usage: path to the configuration\n";
    exit;
}
$fileName=$ARGV[0];
open(O,"&lt;$fileName") || die($!);
open(N,"&gt;$fileName.free") || die($!);
while(&lt;O&gt;) {
    next if($_  =~/^#.*/) ;
    print N $_
}
</pre>

Why not just the following?

	grep -v '^#.*' &lt; input &gt; output

For the same reason I did the last one in perl and not using find. I do 
not like doing anything in bash and I don't remember all of those switch 
that goes with stuff.

<p>
I would write a 1000 line C program before I write anything in bash or 
just sh.

I take it a step farther and make it executable and put it in the path
of system commands like /bin/ and this way it can be called from anywhere.

I put my perl scripts in /usr/local/bin and then add that to my path on

In my opinion, it would be a mistake to add things to '/bin' - that's
why we have '/usr/local/bin'.

I second this part here. I don't think you should put anything you write 
in /bin. I think everything should go into /usr/local/bin or create 
something with in your home directory and then add it to your path.

Thats what I really like about this list. Is with the other input you
get you can apply to your ways to improve and enhance ones ways of doing
things. One must just remember to not get offended and accept the
correction in the constructive way it is intended. I know I do.

Pretty smart of you to spot that, Joey - it's one of my favorite bits of
TAG as well. I've learned a lot here over the years, and keep learning
new things all the time. I think that continuing to learn over the long
term requires courage and humility - the ability to say "I don't know."
A lot of people miss that part and stay stuck right where they are.

Or "~/bin" -- neither that nor /usr/local/bin are generally in the

<p>
There's a different purpose to each of those, of course. For any
programs that I'm only going to use for myself, there's '~/bin'; for
anything that I want to share with the other users on the system,
'/usr/local/bin' is the way to go. I tend to presume the latter in most
situations - and write my scripts with that in mind.

<p>
Or perhaps 'egrep -v '^[ 	]*(#|$)' &lt; input &gt; output' (the stuff
between the brackets is a space and a tab) - but that still doesn't fix
the original file.

This, unfortunately, has several problems.

<p>
1) What about indented comments? This script would miss them.

<p>
2) While you're at it, you might as well remove blank lines.

<p>
3) It creates a file ('original_name.free') instead of just fixing the
original file.

<p>
Here's a one-liner that addresses all of the above, as well as keeping
a backup of the original (it'll have a '~' as an extension):
</p>

<pre>
perl -i~ -wne'print unless /^\s*(?:#|$)/' filename
</pre>

<p>
You could also do something similar with 'sed', which also supports a
'-i' (in-place edit) option.

This is one designed for configuration files like httpd.conf, snmpd.conf.

This is how I want it to be because of the fact that a lot of the times 
I just want to see what is active in the config file or if I just would 
like to work with something that doesn't have all of that trash in the 
file. If you want to use it after clean it off you will just have to 
move it over your self.

Why not make it as generally applicable as possible rather than
restricting it? If you're going to build a tool, make is as robust as
possible. You'll find that this is usually a matter of a tiny
incremental change - which is exactly what it is in this case.

&gt; This is how I want it to be because of the fact that a lot of the times 
&gt; I just want to see what is active in the config file or if I just would 
&gt; like to work with something that doesn't have all of that trash in the 
&gt; file. If you want to use it after clean it off you will just have to 
&gt; move it over your self.

In that case, you can always use the one-liner I cited without the '-i'
option. This will allow you to redirect the output to a file, or pipe it
to, say, 'less' so you can examine it.
