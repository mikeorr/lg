<h1>Using The QEMU Emulator, My Thoughts And Experiences</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/huff.html">Michael Huff</A></b></p>

<p>

<p>
<em>[ Disclaimer:  QEMU comes with support for emulating a full x86,
PowerPC, or SPARC system; because of my own focus and my lack of having
software that needs other architectures, I have stuck to using the
emulator's x86 aspect. It should be remembered that, while I am going
into as much detail as I can about my experience with QEMU, I am leaving
a good portion of the software unaddressed. Simply put, other than
trying to boot a Darwin ISO, I have not used it to run no-x86 OSes. ]</em>

<h3>
Using QEMU: Introductory thoughts
</h3>

<p>
I have been using Linux, along with Windows, since 1997 &mdash; sometimes
alternating; using one for a while and then replacing it with the
other; sometimes dual-booting, with both installed on the same
computer. I'm never quite happy with either arrangement. Regarding
using one at a time, there are applications on one I miss when I use the
other, and Win32 ports and WINE always seem to fall short of using the
application natively. When it comes to dual booting, dividing up hard
drive space is always a problem; especially considering that while
Linux can read NTFS (and read and write to FAT32), any hard drive space
dedicated to Linux is mostly inaccessible to Windows.

<p>
I remember using a copy of OS/2 Warp I got in mid-1997, and thinking
the idea of integrating what is essentially a virtual DOS (or
DOS/Windows) computer was neat. This indirectly led me to explore
other virtualisation setups, including running AppleDOS in ApplePC
under DOSEMU on Linux. When VMWare released their software, I tried an
evaluation copy of it, but was unable at that time to get it to work
with the Slackware system I had set up. By that point, emulation, it's
capabilities, and hardware requirements surpassed the underpowered 486
that was the computer I would have to work with for the next couple
of years.

<p>
Nowadays, I have a decently modern computer, and I've gone to town
rediscovering emulation and the different modern programs such as
Basilisk II, Bochs, and QEMU; and I can see the potential that is so
close to being able to seamlessly switch from one operating environment to
the next. So far, the program I like best for x86 emulation is
QEMU, and I'd like to write a bit about my experience with it and
thoughts on it.

<h3>
How I set up and built QEMU under Linux 
</h3>

<p>
For those of you who do not know, QEMU is the (fast!) emulation suite
written by Fabrice Bellard (available at
<a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/</a>). QEMU includes programs to
emulate a number of platforms, including the x86, SPARC, and PowerPC. It
also is capable of running stand-alone programs for various platforms
(much the same way WINE runs Microsoft Windows programs under X).

<p>
As you would expect with a sufficiently complex program such as QEMU,
compiling from source requires that a number of other libraries and add-ons
be installed, in order to be successful. Out of the three operating
systems I have used QEMU on, two (NetBSD and Windows) do not gain any
benefit from compiling from source; there, I stick to using pkg_add
or the binary installer, respectively.

<p>
However, shortly before the release of QEMU 0.7.0, Fabrice Bellard
wrote and released the closed-source kqemu module for the Linux
kernel, which requires compiling both the module and the QEMU program
from source, in order to install. It's estimated that, without the
module, QEMU performs at roughly 5:1 or 10:1 (that is to say, taking
five or ten native instructions to perform one emulated instruction),
whereas, with the module, the ratio approaches 2:1. Suffice to say, this
performance increase is well worth some minimal fussing about with
compiling sources. (Experimental versions of the kqemu module are
available for FreeBSD and Windows, but, in this article, I will address
using it with Linux.)

<p>
Compiling the source, while slightly more complex then the usual
"./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install" routine, is still
very do-able for most people. This explanation is based on my experience
with Debian; if you're using another distribution, the specifics will be
different, but the basic idea should be the same. Also, compiling kqemu
is different if you are using the 2.6 kernel, as opposed to the 2.4
kernel I use. (The difference is outlined on the instruction page
for kqemu, which is at
<a
href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/kqemu-doc.html">http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/kqemu-doc.html</a>).

<p>
First, I execute "sudo apt-get install qemu" to get most of the
infrastructure in place (mainly the bochsbios package and whatever SDL
libraries are not already installed). After that, I grab the
libsdl-dev package with apt-get, and then I install the kernel source
tree. The kqemu instruction page gives great step-by-step instructions
on how to configure your Linux kernel source tree for kqemu. The only
thing I will add here is that, on my current system, I have never had a
"home-made" Linux kernel successfully boot, undoubtedly due to something
I'm doing wrong. (I have never been good with rolling my own Linux
kernel.) Fortunately, installing the new kernel is not necessary;
simply building it works. These days, I just extract the source from
the tar archive I made of the compiled source tree, and then create the
appropriate /usr/src/linux symbolic link.

<p>
The rest is easy. Obtain the QEMU and kqemu source files, extract the
QEMU source, then change into the newly-created QEMU source directory
and extract the kqemu source there. Then, do the familiar "./configure
&amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install" ritual, to build and
install it.

<p>
A more knowledgeable person than me will know how to set up the
proper links and scripts in /etc/init.d/. Not wanting to jump into that,
myself, I simply run "sudo insmod kqemu", before running QEMU.

<h3>
Setting up and using my QEMU environment
</h3>

<p>
After QEMU is successfully installed, it's time to use it. On my
computer, I have my primary HD on one IDE controller, and my DVD and
second hard disk on another; this minimises the amount of seeking the
hard drive heads have to carry out, and increases performance. After
writing them to CD, I copy any interesting ISO images to a directory on
my second hard disk, and use create hard disk images on my primary hard
drive. This gives QEMU a performance boost when it uses these ISO files
as a virtual CD (in addition to the performance boost already gained by
reading from the hard drive instead of the slower CD-ROM drive). From my
home directory, I create a QEMU directory, and then separate directories
for each virtual machine, though there is no practical reason you could
not dump each uniquely named hard disk image into one single directory.

<p>
As with Bochs, QEMU includes a separate hard disk creation program;
however, using hard disk images under QEMU is considerably easier than
with Bochs. With Bochs, you have to take note of the sectors, heads,
and sectors per track of each hard disk image (and then save this
information in your ~/.bochsrc); with QEMU, the complexity is in the
number of image formats supported (which currently are vvfat, vpc,
bochs, dmg, cloop, vmdk, qcow, cow, and raw). Myself, I mostly ignore
them, and use the default raw format.

<p>
There are front ends for QEMU available, but, personally speaking, I
find it easiest to simply type the command parameters in by hand.
While that may sound weird, there are only a few that are likely to
change:

<ol>
<li>the virtual device you boot from. (When you install your OS, you
will want to choose to boot from the CD, and then quit QEMU after it
is installed, and then choose to boot from the hard disk.)

<li>the name and location of the virtual CD (or whether or not you use
one at all).

<li>the amount of RAM you assign to the virtual machine.  (Often, the
default of 128 megs is fine, but you may need to adjust it, or you may
find that you can free some up.)
</ol>

<p>
Once your OS is installed to the hard disk image, and your settings
are finished, you may want to create a simple shell script that
invokes QEMU with the proper command.

<p>
I have installed Windows XP, FreeDOS, FreeBSD, and NetBSD at different
times on QEMU. I have tried to install Windows 2000, but gave up after
it got stuck during the install. My largest gripe about QEMU may well
be a personal failure (to RTFM?) on my part: my network does not work.
If I use the default /dev/net/tun device, DHCP hangs (until I control-c
it); if I use the unprivileged -user-net option, dhcp "works", but the
machine is inaccessible. The work-around I have for this is to use
mkisofs to create ISO images of any files I want to import into the
virtual machine, and attach them as virtual CD-ROMs. I also have odd
focus weirdness (QEMU grabbing the focus in window mode, after I press
Ctrl-Alt to release the cursor).

<p>
My experience backing up and sharing virtual hard disks has been hit
and miss. I have had XP complain about data corruption after unzipping
a hard disk image, but had no problems running a NetBSD image after
extracting it. Not having tried many of the image formats, I do not
know if switching from the raw format to another one would improve
matters or not.

<p>
One thing to note is that when using floppy images (e.g., the boot
floppies for a Linux distribution), it's better to dd the images to
another file from inside the virtual machine. For instance, if you
want to boot from the file big.fs, you would copy it to your virtual
hard drive, boot the virtual drive with another file attached as the
floppy drive (e.g., specifying "-fda 2.fs" on the command line), and then
running a command such as dd if=big.fs of=/dev/fd0 bs=512 inside the
emulator; then rebooting &mdash; but now with 2.fs having the contents
of big.fs arranged in a way that makes QEMU happy. Just trying to boot
from the raw image, in my experience, tends to produce mixed results
(varying from making no difference to not working at all).

<h3>
Closing thoughts
</h3>

<p>
In closing, I think QEMU is a great program, and a real asset for those
who want to use virtual environments for whatever purposes. It works
great with CLIs and lightweight window mangers, but I would not
recommend it for people who want to use intensive GUI environments such
as XP or GNOME/KDE on a regular basis (e.g., as a second desktop).
Compared to Bochs, it's much faster (in fact, on the QEMU Web page, it
justifiably boasts of being a "fast!" emulator), but it's also worth
noting that its interface is simpler, both on the command line and in
the way that you swap out devices while the program is running. (With
QEMU, you simply type Ctrl-Alt-2, and then use the eject and change
commands).

<p>
Compared to VMware, I think that QEMU (when using the kqemu module)
performs nearly as well, but QEMU lacks VMware's flexibility
in managing memory assigned to your virtual machine. This is because
VMware is able to swap out part (or most, depending on your
configuration) of your virtual machine's RAM to disk, but QEMU is stuck
using whatever the size you have allocated to /dev/shm. In QEMU's favor,
QEMU currently does not ship with a GUI front end, but between the
ability to use a key combination (Ctrl-Alt-f) to switch between
full-screen and window modes, and the simplicity of QEMU's internal
console commands, you really do not miss it. I prefer QEMU's interface,
because I feel it strikes the right balance between capabilities and
leanness. (After all, memory and CPU cycles used by a Win32 or
GTK front end are not available to be used by the virtual machine!)
