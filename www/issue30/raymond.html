Thursday night's epic paintball tournament was easily one of Linux
Expo's most eagerly anticipated and talked-about events. The theme
was ``Emacs versus vi and may the best editor win!'' At the appointed
time, the would-be warriors trooped off to a patch of woods south
of Durham and donned team T-shirts donated by O'Reilly & Associates. By
happy coincidence, the 61 fighters split as exactly as possible
down the middle, 30 on the Emacs team and 31 on vi's.
Ominously, however, all three of the experienced paintballers in the
crowd elected to fight for vi.
<p>
As we waited for mysterious rituals to complete in the paintball shed,
there was much humorous analogizing--vi fans claiming that Emacs's
guns ought to take forever to load, countered by Emacs partisans opining
that vi fighters should be unable to move and fire at the same time.
``You shall feel the power of the Lisp side of the Force!'' declaimed
one black-masked Emacs fan a la Darth Vader, met by hoots of derision
and yells of ``vi rules!''
<p>
Additional humor was provided by the boss paintball referee, who
understood neither our theological disputes nor the lemur and gnu
emblems on our team shirts. He gave up early and started referring to
the teams as ``monkeys'' and ``cows'', much to the amusement of both sides.
<p>
Eventually, not too long after the official start time, we listened to
a safety lecture, picked up our guns, face masks and
glycerin-capsule ammunition and marched into the woods. Each team
got a fortified fire base; the game was elimination, with the last man
standing winning for his team.
<p>
Telling friend from foe turned out to be a bit of a problem, as both
teams were wearing white T-shirts with black emblems and the colored
arm bands we'd been issued were not really conspicuous--some truly
valiant hackers were hit by friendly fire. There were heroic
charges and stealthy ambushes, sniping duels and stand-up fights. The
paintballs flew thick and fast, and the woods resounded with cries of
``Out! Out!'' as pigment-splotched casualties exited the field, guns
held over their heads.
<p>
The teams' combat styles were allegorically perfect. The vi guys were
fast, aggressive and sloppy; the Emacs team was slow, tried to think
things out and play tactically. Result? The vi guys waxed the Emacs
team, winning three out of four games. Evidently (as many on both
sides later agreed, amid much laughter) paintball rewards different
virtues than programming.
<p>
The event was a success, and general kudos went to Mike Maher of Red Hat
from whose brilliant and obviously twisted mind the concept originally
sprang. Next year perhaps we'll tackle Perl vs. Python or Red Hat
vs. Every Other Distribution or some other chronic flame war--and,
hopefully, get different-colored shirts so we can tell each other
apart!
