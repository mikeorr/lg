<strong>Prologue: Composite Conversations with Fictional
Detractors</strong>
<hr>
</center>

Rain fell on the concrete sidewalk, bringing out that
indescribable smell of the city. Mr Fiction and I were
enjoying the weather, sitting at a table under the newly
installed awning just outside of the AS220 cafe. We
<strong>should</strong> have been inside, perhaps building
more Linux boxen for the AS220 computer lab, or maybe
writing the two-way replication script between our in-house
Linux server and the machine that hosts our web pages
(<a href="http://www.ids.net/~as220">http://www.ids.net/~as220</a>). 
No, instead, we were breathing
in the Providence air, enjoying the smell and feeling of the
city before it got too hot, too muggy, before
<strong>we</strong> got too
lazy.<p>

Mr. Fiction isn't completely convinced about Linux; perhaps
he never will be. Nevertheless, he dutifully helps me when
I'm trying to bring up Linux on an old Compaq 386 with the 
weirdest memory chips, or when we need to build the kernel
yet again, because I've decided that I'm ready to trust
ext2fs file system compression or some such whim.<p>

This time, Mr. Fiction was baiting me. "Alright, Brian. How
can Linux help me here? I've got a client who is using
SQL Server on Windows NT for her company-wide databases. She'd
really like to publish this data on her Intranet using HTML
and CGI. While she's really happy with Microsoft for a database
server platform, she's not convinced that it's good as a
web server. We're looking into Unix-based solutions, and we
really need a platform that allows us to write CGI script
that can connect to the database server. But since Linux
doesn't have connectivity to..."<p>

That's when I had to stop him; Linux <strong>can</strong>
connect to Sybase SQL Server. What's more, it
<strong>can</strong> also connect to Microsoft SQL Server. Some
time ago, Sybase released an a.out version of their 
Client-Library (CT-Lib) for Linux. Greg Thain (<a
href="mailto:thain@ntdev1.sunquest.com">thain@ntdev1.sunquest.com</a>)
has converted the
libraries to ELF. As a result, anyone using an elf-based
Linux later than 2.0 should be able to link applications against these
libraries. There's a nice section on this issue that's available
in the Sybase FAQ, at <a
href="http://reality.sgi.com/pablo/Sybase_FAQ/Q9.17.html">http://reality.sgi.com/pablo/Sybase_FAQ/Q9.17.html</a>,
and the libraries themselves can be downloaded from:
<pre>
   <a href="ftp://mudshark.sunquest.com/pub/ctlib-linux-elf/ctlib-linux-elf.tgz">ftp://mudshark.sunquest.com/pub/ctlib-linux-elf/ctlib-linux-elf.tgz</a>.
</pre>

If you are using an a.out system, you can take your chances
with the libraries that Sybase originally released. These
are available at:

<strong>A Neon Joyride with CT-Lib</strong>
<hr>
</center>

If you've read this far, I'm going to assume that you have
access to an SQL Server. I've used these libraries
with the Sybase System 11 we have running at work on a
Solaris 2.4 system, and the examples for this article were
developed using Microsoft SQL Server 6.0 running on Windows
NT 4.0. If you don't have
SQL Server, but would like to experiment, you can download
an evaluation version of SQL Server Professional for Windows
NT at:
<pre>
   <a
href="http://www.sybase.com/products/system11/workplace/ntpromofrm.html">http://www.sybase.com/products/system11/workplace/ntpromofrm.html</a>
</pre>

If you do this, it goes without saying that you'll need another
computer (running Windows NT) that's connected to your Linux
box via TCP/IP. Sadly, there is no version of Sybase or Microsoft
SQL Server that runs on Linux. However, if you have
access to a machine that is running SQL Server, then you
will likely find this article interesting.<p>

In order to make use of these examples, you need to have
been assigned a user id and password on the SQL Server to
which you will connect.
You should also know the hostname of the server,
and most importantly, the port on which the server listens.
If you installed the server yourself, you will know all of
this. Otherwise, you will need to get this information from
your sysadmin or dba.<p>

The first thing to tackle is the installation and
configuration of the Client-Library distribution. The
<code>ctlib-linux-elf.tar.gz</code> file includes a top-level
<code>sybase</code> directory. Before you extract it, you
should probably pick a permanent home for it; common places
are <code>/opt</code> or <code>/usr/local</code>. When you
extract it, you should be sure that you are root, and make
sure your working directory is the directory that you've chosen. The process
might look something like this:

<pre>
   bash-2.00$ su
   Password: 
   bash-2.00# cd /usr/local
   bash-2.00# tar xvfz ctlib-linux-elf.tar.gz
</pre>

While you will be statically linking these libraries in with
application programs, any program that uses the Sybase
libraries will need to find the directory. There are two
ways to deal with this, and I usually do both. The first is
to create a user named <code>sybase</code>. This user's home
directory should be the Client-Library directory into which you
extracted <code>ctlib-linux-elf.tar.gz</code>. The user
won't need to log in, and I'm not aware of any
programs that need to <code>su</code> to that user id. I believe the user needs
to be there so that <code>~sybase</code> can be resolved to the
directory you chose. Here's the relevant line
from <code>/etc/passwd</code> for the sybase user:

<pre>
   sybase:*:510:100:SYBASE:/usr/local/sybase:/bin/true
</pre>

Of course, your UID and GID may differ, and you can
certainly use the <code>adduser</code> utility to add the
sybase user. The critical thing is to ensure that you've set
the home directory correctly.<p>

The second thing you can do to help applications find the
Sybase directory is to create an environment variable called
$SYBASE. This should simply include the name of the
Client-Library home directory:

<pre>
   bash-2.00$ export SYBASE=/usr/local/sybase
</pre>

The <code>interfaces</code> file included in the
top of the Client-Library home directory
(<code>/usr/local/sybase/interfaces</code> in this example) must be set up
correctly in order for anything to work. The interfaces file
allows your clients to associate a symbolic name with a
given server. So, any server you wish to query must be
configured in the interfaces file. If you've already got an
interfaces file in non-TLI format (this is the name of the
network API used by Sybase on Solaris, and the interfaces file differs
as well), you should be able to use it or adapt it. Even if
you don't, you can write your own entries. Here's a sample
entry (that's a tab on the second line, and it
<strong>is</strong> very important):
<pre>
   ARTEMIS
           query tcp ether artemis 1433
</pre>
The parts of this entry that you are concerned about are:<p>

<center>
<table border  bgcolor="#DDDDDD" width="80%">
<tr valign="TOP"><td>ARTEMIS</td>
<td>This is the name by which client programs will refer to the server. 
It doesn't have to be the same as the host name.</td></tr>
<tr valign="TOP"><td>artemis</td>
<td>This is the host name of the server.</td></tr>
<tr valign="TOP"><td>1433</td>
<td>This is the TCP/IP socket that the server listens on.</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Here's an interfaces file that includes entries for both a
Sybase SQL Server (running on Solaris) and a Microsoft SQL
Server, running on Windows NT (comments begin with #). Note
that the entries ARTEMIS and
NTSRV refer to the same server:<p>

<center>
<table border  bgcolor="#DDDDDD" width="80%">
<tr><td>
<pre>
## DEV_SRVR on Sol2-5 (192.168.254.24)

        query tcp ether Sol2-5 5000

## NTSRV on artemis (192.168.254.26)

<strong>SQSH - an Excellent Alternative to isql</strong><br>
(or is isql a poor alternative to SQSH?)
<hr>
</center>

SQSH is a freely redistributable alternative to the isql
program that is supplied with Sybase SQL Server. It's
basically a shell that makes it easy to send SQL statements
to the server. It's written by Scott Gray (<a
href="mailto:gray@voicenet.com">gray@voicenet.com</a>), a
member of the Sybase FAQ Hall of Fame. The SQSH home page is
at <a
href="http://www.voicenet.com/~gray/">http://www.voicenet.com/~gray/</a>
and includes the latest release of SQSH as well as the SQSH
FAQ and a lot of other information.<p>

SQSH can be compiled on Linux; this should be simple for anyone 
who is familiar with compiling C programs, such as the Linux kernel, 
Perl, or other tools you may have installed from source. The
first thing to do is to extract the SQSH archive, preferable
in some place like <code>/usr/src</code>. I usually do installations as
root; some people wait until just before the 'make install'
portion to become root. You can extract the distribution
with the following command:
<pre>
   bash-2.00# tar xvfz sqsh-1.5.2.tar.gz 
</pre>
And then you can enter the source directory with:
<pre>
   bash-2.00# cd sqsh-1.5.2
</pre>
(of course, if you are building a newer version, you will
need to use a different file name and directory)<p>

There are two files in the source directory that you must
read; README and INSTALL. If you'd like to compile SQSH with
bash-style command history editing, you'll need to get your
hands on the GNU Readline library, unless it's already
installed on your system. I believe that it's no longer
packaged as a separate library, and is now part of the bash
distribution, available at:
<pre>
   <a
href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/">ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/</a>
</pre>

Before you do anything, you'll need to make sure you set the
$SYBASE environment variable, which I discussed earlier in
this article. Then, you should run the configure script.
This process might look like:
<pre>
   bash-2.00# export SYBASE=/usr/local/sybase/
   bash-2.00# ./configure 
   creating cache ./config.cache
   checking for gcc... gcc
   [etc., etc.]
</pre>

If you've installed the GNU Readline library, and you want
to use it with SQSH (who wouldn't?) you should add the
following option to ./configure:
<pre>
   bash-2.00# ./configure -with-readline
</pre>

After you've run configure, you should examine the Makefile,
and follow the instructions at the top. Generally,
./configure does everything right, but you should
double-check. If everything looks okay, you can type:
<pre>
   bash-2.00# make
</pre>

And sit back and wait. If everything went fine, you should
have a new <code>sqsh</code> executable that you can install with:
<pre>
   bash-2.00# make install
</pre>

In order to run it, you must supply a server name (-S),
username (-U),
and password (-P). The server name corresponds to the name that
was set up in your <code>interfaces</code> file. Once you've
started sqsh, you can issue SQL commands. To send whatever
you've typed to the server, you can type <code>go</code> by
itself on a line. To clear the current query, you can type
<code>reset</code>. If you'd like to edit the current query,
you can type <code>vi</code>. Among many other features,
sqsh features the ability to use shell-style redirection after the
'go' keyword. Here's a sample session:<p>

<strong>CGI, Sybperl and Linux: All the Colours in my Paintbox</strong>
<hr>
</center>

Getting back to Mr. Fiction's problem, we need to answer a big 
question; <i>How can we connect a Linux web server to
Sybase?</i> If you've done a lot of CGI programming, you've
probably, but not necessarily, used a little bit of Perl.
Perl is an excellent tool for CGI development; its modular
design makes it easy to extend. In the examples which
follow, we'll see how to use the CGI module in conjunction
with Sybperl. Combining these tools, we'll be able to easily
build CGI applications that can connect to an SQL Server
database.<p>

It's probably best to use a Perl that has been installed
from source. In the past, I have had trouble with binary
distributions, and so, I always install the Perl source code
and build it myself. You should obtain and extract the
following modules from CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive
Network):

<pre>
   <strong>CGI.pm:</strong>  <a
href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/CGI/CGI.pm-2.36.tar.gz">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/CGI/CGI.pm-2.36.tar.gz</a>
   <strong>Sybperl:</strong> <a
href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Sybase/sybperl-2.07.tar.gz">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Sybase/sybperl-2.07.tar.gz</a>
</pre>

Installing the CGI module is quite simple. You need to
extract it, enter the directory that's created, and follow
the instructions in the README file. For most Perl modules,
this will follow the form:

<pre>
   bash-2.00# tar xvfz MODULE_NAME.tar.gz
   bash-2.00# cd MODULE_NAME
   bash-2.00# less README
   [ ... you read the file ...]
   bash-2.00# perl Makefile.PL
   [ ... some stuff happens here...]
   bash-2.00# make
   [ ... lots of stuff happens here...]
   bash-2.00# make test
   [ ... lots of stuff happens here...]
   bash-2.00# make install
</pre>

You should double check to make sure that CGI.pm is not
already installed; if you install it, you should do it as
root, since it needs to install the module into your
site-specific module directories. Here's the commands I 
typed to make this happen for the CGI
extension (note that there are no tests defined for CGI.pm,
so I didn't need to do 'make test'):
<pre>
    bash-2.00# tar xvfz CGI.pm-2.36.tar.gz 
    bash-2.00# cd CGI.pm-2.36
    bash-2.00# perl Makefile.PL 
    bash-2.00# make
    bash-2.00# make install
</pre>

Once you've installed it, you can use it in your Perl
programs; do a 'perldoc CGI' for complete instructions.<p>

Installing Sybperl is a little more involved. 
If you don't want to build Sybperl yourself, you can
download a binary version from:
<pre>
   <a
href="ftp://mudshark.sunquest.com/pub/ctlib-linux-elf/sybperl.tar.gz">ftp://mudshark.sunquest.com/pub/ctlib-linux-elf/sybperl.tar.gz</a>
</pre>

If you do want to go ahead and build it yourself,
first extract it and enter the source directory:
<pre>
   bash-2.00# tar xvfz sybperl-2.07.tar.gz 
   bash-2.00# cd sybperl-2.07/
</pre>


Again, it's really important that you read the README file.
Before you run 'perl Makefile.PL,' you will need to set up a
couple of configuration files. The first is CONFIG. This
file lets you set the following parameters:<p>
<table border  bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
<tr valign="top"><td>DBLIBVS</td>
<td>The version of DBlib that you have installed. Under
Linux, only CTlib is available, so this should be set to
0.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>CTLIBVS</td>
<td>This should be set to 100, as indicated in the
file.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>SYBASE</td>
<td>This is the directory where you installed the
Client-Library distribution. It should be the same as
$SYBASE or ~sybase.</td>
<tr valign="top"><td>EXTRA_LIBS</td>
<td>These are the names of additional libraries that you
need to link against. The Sybase Client-Library distribution
typically includes a library called libtcl.a, but this
conflicts with the Tcl library installed under many versions
of Linux. So, this has been renamed libsybtcl.a in the Linux
version of CTlib. This option should also include libinsck.a. The
value for this configuration option should be set to
'-lsybtcl -linsck'.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>EXTRA_DEFS</td>
<td>It does not appear that this needs to be changed, unless
you are using Perl 5.001m, in which case you need to add
-DUNDEF_BUG.</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td>LINKTYPE</td>
<td>Under Linux, I am not aware of anyone who has managed to
get a dynamically loadable version of Sybperl to build.
I have not been able to get it to compile as a dynamic
module, so I always set this to 'static', which results in a
new perl executable being built.</td></tr>
</table><p>

Here's my CONFIG file:<p>
<center>
<table border  bgcolor="#DDDDDD" width="80%">
<tr><td>
<pre>
#
# Configuration file for Sybperl
#
# DBlibrary version. Set to 1000 (or higher) if you have System 10
# Set to 0 if you do not want to build DBlib or if DBlib is not available
# (Linux, for example)
DBLIBVS=0


# CTlib version. Set to 0 if Client Library is not available on your
# system, or if you don't want to build the CTlib module. The Client
# Library started shipping with System 10.
# Note that the CTlib module is still under construction, though the
# core API should be stable now.
# Set to 100 if you have System 10.
CTLIBVS=100

# Where is the Sybase directory on your system (include files &
# libraries are expected to be found at SYBASE/include & SYBASE/lib
SYBASE=/usr/local/sybase

# Additional libraries.
# Some systems require -lnsl or -lBSD.
# Solaris 2.x needs -ltli
# DEC OSF/1 needs -ldnet_stub
# See the Sybase OpenClient Supplement for your OS/Hardware
# combination.
EXTRA_LIBS=-lsybtcl -linsck

# Additional #defines.
# With Perl 5.001m, you will need -DUNDEF_BUG.
# With Perl 5.002, none are normally needed, but you may wish to
# use -DDO_TIE to get the benefit of stricter checking on the
# Sybase::DBlib and Sybase::CTlib attributes.
#EXTRA_DEFS=-DUNDEF_BUG
EXTRA_DEFS=-DDO_TIE


# LINKTYPE
# If you wish to link Sybase::DBlib and/or Sybase::CTlib statically
# into perl uncomment the line below and run the make normally. Then,
# when you run 'make test' a new perl binary will be built.
LINKTYPE=static
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center><p>

The next file that you need to enter is the PWD file. This
contains three configuration options; UID (user id), PWD
(password), and SRV (server name). It is used to run the
test, after the new perl binary is built. Here's my PWD
file:<p>
<center>
<table border  bgcolor="#DDDDDD" width="80%">
<tr><td>
<pre>
# This file contains optional login id, passwd and server info for the test
# programs:
# You probably don't want to have it lying around after you've made
# sure that everything works OK.

UID=sa
PWD=secretpassword
SRV=ARTEMIS
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center><p>

Now that you've set up the configuration files, you should
type 'perl Makefile.PL' followed by 'make'. Disregard any
warning about -ltcl not being found.
After this is done, you should type 'make test', which will build the new
Perl binary and test it. All of the tests may not succeed,
especially if you are testing against Microsoft SQL Server
(the cursor test will fail).<p>

When you are ready to install Sybperl libraries, you can
type 'make install'. 
You should be aware that the new binary will be
statically linked to the Client-Library, and will be
slightly bigger. If this offends you, you can rename the new
perl to something like sybperl and install it in the
location of your choice. The new perl binary is
<strong>not</strong> installed by default, so you can
install it wherever you want. You will not be able to use
the Sybperl libraries from your other version of Perl; you
will have to use the new binary you created.<p>

For simplicity's sake, let's assume that you are going to
rename the new binary to sybperl, and move to
<code>/usr/local/bin/sybperl</code>. The README file includes alternate
instructions for installing the new binary. The manual is
included in the <code>pod/</code> directory under the Sybperl source
code. You can also read the documentation with 'perldoc
Sybperl'.<p>

Here's a sample Perl program that uses CGI and Sybase::CTlib to 
give the users the ability to interactively query the authors
table that is included with the pubs sample database:<p>
<center>
<table border  bgcolor="#DDDDDD" width="80%">
<tr><td>
<xmp>
#!/usr/local/bin/sybperl

use CGI;
use Sybase::CTlib;

# This is a CGI script, and it will not have the $SYBASE
# environment variable, so let's help it out...
#
$ENV{SYBASE} = '/usr/local/sybase';

# Get a "database handle", which is a connection to the
# database server.
#
my $dbh = new Sybase::CTlib('bjepson', 'secretpassword', 'ARTEMIS');

# Instantiate a new CGI object.
#
my $query = new CGI;

# Print the header and start the html.
#
print $query->header;
print $query->start_html(-title   => "Sybperl Example",
                         -bgcolor => '#FFFFFF');

# Put up a form, a prompt, an input field, and a submit button.
#
print qq[<h1>Sybperl Example</h1><hr>];
print $query->startform;

print qq[Enter part of an author's name: ];
print $query->textfield( -name => 'query_name' );
print $query->submit;

# End the form.
#
print $query->endform;

# If the user entered an author name, find all authors
# whose first and/or last names match the value.
#
if ($query->param('query_name')) {

    # Use the pubs database.
    #
    $dbh->ct_sql("use pubs");

    # Get the value the user typed

    $query_name = $query->param('query_name');

    # Find all of the matching authors. This search

    #
    my $sql = qq[SELECT au_fname, au_lname ] .
              qq[FROM authors ] .
              qq[WHERE au_fname LIKE '%$query_name%' ] .
              qq[OR    au_lname LIKE '%$query_name%' ] .
              qq[ORDER BY au_lname, au_fname];
    my @rows = $dbh->ct_sql($sql);

    # Iterate over each row and display the first

I've found the Sybase libraries for Linux to be quite
useful. I find myself in a lot of places where either Sybase
or Microsoft SQL Server sees heavy use. It's nice to be able
to connect, especially when dialing in over a modem. I've
found that sqsh performs much better making the connection
over dialup than isql running on a remote machine, even when
I'm connected with rlogin.<p>

I hope these ramblings have been enjoyable for you; I
think Mr. Fiction's head is spinning, but it's all for the
best. We've had some of the best doctors in the world look
at it, and while no one can agree on exactly
<B>when</B> it will stop spinning, they all agree
that it looks much better that way.<p>
