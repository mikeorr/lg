<h1>Video editing from the command line</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/brownss.html">Silas Brown</a></b></p>

<p>This is an article about basic video production in
MPlayer.  MPlayer has its own "edit decision list" facility,
but that is limited to deleting scenes from an already-made
movie; it cannot be used to take scenes from more than one
source file and to sequence them in a different order, as is
often needed in production.  However, by running several
MPlayer commands in succession you <em>can</em> do this on
the command line, and you don't need particularly high-spec
equipment or dexterous mouse skills or even eyesight to do it
(some eyesight is a plus but you don't need much).</p>

<H2>Previewing in MPlayer</H2>

<p>Firstly, make sure you can play each of your
source-material videos with the <tt>mplayer</tt> command
(use <tt>mplayer -framedrop</tt> if you have a slow
computer).  Installing <tt>mplayer</tt> from your package
manager may be enough, but in some cases a newer version of
<tt>mplayer</tt> and/or support for additional types of
video codecs is needed; in this case the exact setup
procedure can vary, depending on your distribution and its
version, so you may have to do some web searching to find out.</p>

<p>Once <tt>mplayer</tt> is set up correctly to play the
video format you have, in the video window you should be
able to press Space to pause and use the left and right
arrow keys to seek, and in the console window you should get
a continuously-updated one-line status report which includes
the field <tt>V:</tt> followed by the video's time counter
in seconds.  When the video is paused, you will be able to
read off the exact <tt>V:</tt> value, and you can use these
values to decide where you want to start and end your clips.
(You can fine-tune the values later by trial and error.)</p>

<H2>Taking the clips</H2>

<p>After you've decided on the order of your clips and have
made a note of their start and stop timestamp values (for
example in a text editor), you can extract each clip to a
separate file by running <tt>mencoder</tt> once for each
clip, like this:</p>

<pre>
mencoder video3.avi -ofps 25 -o clip1.avi -oac lavc -ovc lavc -vf scale=320:240 -ss 59 -endpos 15
mencoder video1.avi -ofps 25 -o clip2.avi -oac lavc -ovc lavc -vf scale=320:240 -ss 14 -endpos 3
</pre>

<p>In the above example, <tt>clip1.avi</tt> is taken from
<tt>video3.avi</tt>, starting at 59 seconds in (the <tt>-ss
59</tt>) and lasting 15 seconds (the <tt>-endpos 15</tt>).
<tt>clip2.avi</tt> is taken from <tt>video1.avi</tt>,
starting at 14 seconds and lasting 3 seconds.  We specified
a value for the output frames per second (<tt>-ofps 25</tt>)
and the pixel size of the output video (<tt>-vf
scale=320:240</tt>) to make sure that all our clips will
have the same pixel size and frame rate, which is necessary
to make sure they can be put together properly.</p>

<p>After running <tt>mencoder</tt> for each clip, it is
advisable to use <tt>mplayer</tt> to view the resulting clip
and check that its start and stop points were just right.
If not, you may have to re-run the <tt>mencoder</tt> command
with adjusted values (add a half-second here, subtract a
half-second there) until you're happy with the result.</p>

<H2>Check the framerates</H2>

<p>In some cases, in addition to <tt>-ofps</tt>, you may
also have to specify an <tt>-fps</tt> value (best put near
the beginning of the <tt>mencoder</tt> command) to make sure
that the <em>input</em> frames per second is read correctly;
for example some FLV videos need <tt>-fps 24</tt>.  If the
input frames per second is not read correctly, after a while
the picture will run ahead of the sound if the FPS is too
high, or will lag behind the sound if the FPS is too low.
Even if the clip is very short, a wrong FPS could result in
the <em>next</em> clip starting the picture before the sound
or vice versa.  So when playing each clip, check that the
sound finishes at exactly the same time as the picture
finishes.  Thankfully mplayer usually gets the input FPS
value right by itself, but it's worth knowing about this for
when it doesn't.</p>

<p>You may also want to check that the output frames per
second (<tt>-ofps</tt>) value you provide is actually being
obeyed by <tt>mencoder</tt>.  Sometimes <tt>mencoder</tt>
has to adjust it to cope with the constraints of whatever
output format you're using.  If you look at
<tt>mencoder</tt>'s textual output, toward the end there
will be a line beginning <tt>Video:</tt> which will include
the number of seconds and the number of frames in the output
video; divide the frames by the seconds to get the frame
rate.  Synchronization might work slightly better if you
then choose an approximation of this new value as your
preferred <tt>-ofps</tt> value.  (Don't pay any attention to
the "fps" values that are incrementally printed by
<tt>mencoder</tt>; these are merely telling you how fast
<tt>mencoder</tt> is doing the conversion, not the actual
running speed of the film.)</p>

<H2>Putting the clips together</H2>

<p>When you are happy with all the component clips, you need
to combine them into the final video in order.  This is done
with a final <tt>mencoder</tt> command, for example:</p>

<pre>
./mencoder clip1.avi clip2.avi clip3.avi -o result.avi -oac lavc -ovc lavc
</pre>

<p>Then check that the <tt>result.avi</tt> file plays using
<tt>mplayer</tt> and that you are happy with it.  Sometimes
(perhaps due to floating point rounding errors in
<tt>mencoder</tt>) the video will run ahead of the sound in
the final result even if all the individual clips are in
step; if the final <tt>mencoder</tt> frequently reports
<tt>Skipping frame!</tt> then this may happen.  If it does,
you can experiment with the <tt>-fps</tt> option on
<tt>mplayer</tt> to find the framerate that synchronizes
sound and video, and then run an additional <tt>ffmpeg</tt>
command to adjust the framerate to that speed, for
example:</p>

<pre>
ffmpeg -r 23 -i result.avi -sameq -ab 224k corrected-result.avi
</pre>

<p>where 23 is the framerate you found that best
synchronizes to the audio, and 224k is the audio bitrate in
use (you can change this at this stage if you
like). <tt>ffmpeg</tt> seems to be better at making this
adjustment than <tt>mencoder</tt>.  Don't be tempted just to
add the new <tt>-fps</tt> to the above final
<tt>mencoder</tt> command instead, because in some cases
doing that can result in the inclusion of extra audio from
outside your original clipping points.  Re-check the
adjusted result with <tt>mplayer</tt>, and if necessary try
repeating the <tt>ffmpeg</tt> command with a slightly
different framerate.</p>
