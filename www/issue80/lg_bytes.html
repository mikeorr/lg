<P>
Back in January, 
<a href="../issue74/lg_bytes.html">
we mentioned</a> that Microsoft had been granted a patent claim
for a `Digital rights management operating system'.  It appears their plans
are developing further.  A recent
<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/770511.asp?cp1=1">
article</a> at MSNBC/Newsweek provides an "exclusive first look" at the new
technology.  It begins:
<blockquote>
"An exclusive first look at
Microsoft's ambitious-and risky-plan to remake the personal computer to
ensure security, privacy and intellectual property rights. Will you buy it?"
</blockquote>
Frankly, I don't buy it!
The article is almost entirely uncritical and does not raise any of the
many legitimate concerns surrounding such a technology.
<P>
The Register has published a some excellent articles on Palladium, by
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25852.html">
John Lettice</a>,
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25843.html">
Richard Forno</a> and
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25891.html">
Thomas C Greene</a>.  The 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25891.html">
third of these</a> focuses specifically on what effect Palladium could have
on the Linux community, and the indications are not good (unsurprisingly,
given that it would mean a large part of the hardware industry could end up
dancing almost exclusively to Microsoft's tune). Indeed, as Robert Cringely
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20020627.html">
has written</a>, Palladium could be bad news for the entire infrastructure
of the internet.
<P>
If you want more information on Palladium, and DRM (digital rights
management) technology in general, 
<a href="http://www.cryptome.org">cryptome</a> has 
<a href="http://cryptome.org/ms-drm-os.htm">
some useful links</a> along with the text of the original MS DRM OS patent.
Of particular interest is Ross Anderson's 
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/rja14/tcpa-faq.html">
TCPA / Palladium Frequently Asked Questions</a>
(TCPA=Trusted Computing Platform Alliance).

The 
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> has 
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/business/newsid_2023000/2023127.stm">
reported</a> that Germany has signed a contract with IBM and SuSE for a large
public sector Linux-based computer contract.  Among the reasons for the
decision given by German representatives were cost and security.  The BBC
article gives quite a nice background to the story also, which is worth
reading. Also of interest is 
<a href="http://www.suse.de/en/press/press_releases/archive02/schily_ibm.html">
SuSE's press release</a>, and other reports of this news
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25565.html">
at The Register</a> and
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/06/03/1414239.shtml?tid%106">
at Slashdot</a>.
<P>
In other good news, it has 
<a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS9061559934.html">
been reported by DesktopLinux.com</a> and
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-06-17-011-26-NW-DP-PB">
by LinuxToday</a>
that Finnish MP's have signed a bill requesting national and local agencies
to migrate their IT systems to the Linux operating system.  This could be
part of a trend.  Slashdot has 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/06/04/0259234.shtml?tid%117">
reported</a> 
a similar development in Taiwan, which "...will start a national plan to
jump-start the development and use of Free (libre) Software".
IDG.net has published 
<a href="http://www.idg.net/ic_874686_1794_9-10000.html">
a survey</a>
of countries which making moves toward open-source software and attempting
to reduce dependence on Microsoft.

The Linux Buyer's Guide</a>
is a service provided by Linux Journal; it lists
software (both commercial and free), hardware, distributions, books, etc.
There are ten major categories and dozens of subcategories, and a search
page for searching names, descriptions and price ranges.  The service is
always free to users, and vendors likewise can list their products for free.  
(Vendors can also sign up for paid premium services; e.g., banner ads.)
Entries are added by the vendor through the web, so they reflect which vendors
have visited the site and chosen to list their products.
Free software developers are invited to register as "vendors" and list their
software, so that the public can comparison shop between free and commercial
items.  Just designate one person to be the Buyer's Guide contact, who will
update the product listing as the product changes.  (All listings must be
updated or verified at least once a year or they will be dropped; this prevents
stale listings from remaining.)

<a href="http://www.unitedlinux.com/">UnitedLinux</a>.  
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/7/25503.html">
Speculation</a> about
what exactly this 
<a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/05/29/138258">
development</a>
will mean for Linux began even before the
announcement was formally made.
<a href="http://www.redhat.com">
RedHat</a>,
which would be an obvious target of the newly formed UnitedLinux, has made
little comment on the development and is reported to be 
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-05-30-019-26-NW-BZ-RH">
cautiously optimistic</a>.
However Dennis Powell, writing at Linux and Main, sees this as the 
<a href="http://www.linuxandmain.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=91">
beginning of a larger battle</a>
between UnitedLinux on one side and Dell Red Hat and Oracle on the other.
<P>
Among the features of UnitedLinux which have attracted 
attention are 
<a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/05/31/228254">
the refusal to distribute free binaries</a>, and talk of
<a href="http://www.linuxandmain.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=83">
per seat licensing</a>. It would appear that not all details in these areas have
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25587.html">
yet been worked out</a>.

</H3> 
<P>
One of the most contentious happenings of the past month was 
<a href="http://www.adti.net/html_files/defense/opensource_pressrelease_05_30_2002.html">
the release</a>
by the 
<a href="http://www.adti.net/">Alexis de Tocqueville Institution</a>
of a whitepaper entitled Opening the Open Source Debate.  Among the points
made in this document was that
<blockquote>
Terrorists trying to hack or disrupt U.S. computer networks might find it
easier if the federal government attempts to switch to "open source" as
some groups propose.'
</blockquote>
Unsurprisingly, this led to an outcry among many associated with open
source software.
<P>
Happily, for those of us who believe free and open software is a good
thing, it appears that these contentions are not being blindly accepted.
Indeed there have been some very well considered rebuttals of the
whitepaper's theories.  David F. Skoll at the Sydney Morning Herald has
made 
<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/06/11/1022982836568.html">
detailed arguments</a>
(also
<a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/adti2.php3">at Roaring
Penguin</a>)
against  the specific points raised as has 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/25656.html">
Thomas C. Greene at The Register</a> and
<a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/06/14/1948201&mode=thread&tid=11">
Karl O. Pinc at NewsForge</a>,
<P>
Some commentators such as Michelle Delio at Wired have 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/linux/0,1411,52973,00.html">
suggested</a>
that Microsoft may have paid to have the paper written.  Whoever were the
original funders of the paper, if <em>you</em> want to read it, you will
have to stump up $5.29, 
<a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/06/20/1755215&mode=thread&tid=11">
as reported by NewsForge</a>.
It is possible to download the original version
<a href="http://x.emdx.org/Slashdot/old_opensource_whitepaper.pdf">
from a non-ADTI server</a>, which was linked from the
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/06/10/1737258&tid=99">
Slashdot report</a> on this story.
Apparently, the main 
differences
between the different versions of the document are in spelling and grammar
(Anthony Awtrey at Linux and Main
<a href="http://linuxandmain.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=97">
goes through them in detail</a>).
<P>
For a more positive analysis of the role of open/free software in
government and military applications, you could look at
<a href="http://www.mitre.org/support/papers/tech_papers_01/kenwood_software/index.shtml">
the MITRE paper</a> on the subject.  Finally, for the ultimate irony,
NewsForge had the
<a href="http://newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/06/05/1721223">
pleasure of reporting</a> that the ADTI's own website runs 
<a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache</a>.

In a recent court hearing in Germany, the owners of the name

defeated a challenge
brought against them by 
<a href="http://www.editions-albert-rene.com">
Les &#201ditions Albert Ren&#233</a>, owners of the popular Asterix comic
book series.  The Asterix comic features a character named Obelix, and it
was the contention of lawyers representing

Les &#201ditions Albert Ren&#233</a> that the name Mobilix was a violation
of their trademarks.  Mobilix is a website devoted to

The court eventually ruled that there was little chance of the names being
mixed up, especially given the very different markets they are aimed at.
