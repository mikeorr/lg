<h1>An Introduction to JSPWiki</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/youngman.html">Neil Youngman</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>The good, the bad, and the wiki?</h2>
<h3>Wikis</h3>
<p>In this article I explain what a Wiki is and how it is used, for
those readers who haven't come across Wikis before. I discuss why I
chose JSPWiki from the hundreds of Wikis out there, and I explain
how I set it up.</p>
<p>Wiki is a short form of WikiWikiWeb. Wikis are collaboratively
authored Web sites that are created and edited by their users.
Wikis provide a quick and simple way of generating a set of linked
Web pages. The emphasis is on collaboration and simplicity. Anyone
can contribute and it doesn't take long to get started.</p>
<p>According to <a href=
"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=OneMinuteWiki">"One-Minute
Wiki"</a> WikiWiki is Hawaiian and means "quick".</p>
<p>Wikis can be used almost like a bulletin board to share
information and ask questions, but there is no concept of boards or
thread, just a set of interlinked pages.</p>
<p>Collaborative authoring means that pages aren't owned by any one
author. If you spot a mistake on a page, you can correct it there
and then and of course other people can correct your pages.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of uses for Wikis. They can be used anywhere
you need to share information among a large group of people. I have
seen them used for informal documentation within a development
project, question and answer sessions and even <a href=
"http://wikipedia.org">a collaboratively written encyclopedia</a>.
I also sometimes keep a set of notes on my Wiki, allowing me to
access them easily from multiple locations and share them with
anyone else that needs the same information.</p>
<p>Typically there is an edit option on each page, which allows a
user to alter the page and a simple convention for creating links
to another page. To create a new page, you just create a link and
that link allows you to edit the page.</p>
<p>You don't have to learn HTML to create and edit Wiki pages.
Instead, there are a set of simple conventions, e.g., in JSPWiki,
you create a new link simply by enclosing a phrase in square
brackets.</p>
<pre>
    [New Link]
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, these conventions are not standardised, so, if
you use more than one Wiki, you may have to learn more than one set
of formatting conventions.</p>
<p>To try out a Wiki why not go to the <a href=
"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=SandBox">JSPWiki Sandbox</a>
or take a look at <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, a
collaboratively authored encyclopedia.</p>
<h3>Why JSPWiki?</h3>
<p>When I wanted to set up a Wiki for myself, I looked around and I
found that there are hundreds of <a href=
"http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiClones">WikiClones</a> to choose from.
Many of them are still pre-release and I wanted something that
would be stable, reliable, easy to install, setup and use. JSPWiki
provides all of this plus authentication, version control,
attachments, and plugins.</p>
<h3>Ease Of Use</h3>
<p>Wikis are designed for ease of use, so this should not be a
major issue with any Wiki. The main differences in ease of use come
from choosing a mature and stable Wiki with simple formating
rules.</p>
<p>JSPWiki's mark up language seems relatively clear and simple to
me. Links are created simply by putting square brackets around the
link name. Headers can be created by putting an exclamation mark at
the start of the line and tables by dividing up the text with with
pipe characters. So, for example:</p>
<pre>
!!! This is an example

which links to [The Linux Gazette|http://linuxgazette.net]

and shows 

! a table

|plate|knife|fork
|mat|glass|cup

</pre>
<p>comes out looking like</p>
<h2><a name="section-SandBox-ThisIsAnExample" id=
"section-SandBox-ThisIsAnExample">This is an example</a></h2>
<p>which links to <a class="external" href=
"http://linuxgazette.net">The Linux Gazette</a><img src=
"http://www.jspwiki.org/images/out.png" class="outlink" alt=""></p>
<p>and shows</p>
<h4><a name="section-SandBox-ATable" id="section-SandBox-ATable">a
table</a></h4>
<table class="wikitable" border="1">
<tr>
<td>plate</td>
<td>knife</td>
<td>fork</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>mat</td>
<td>glass</td>
<td>cup</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>JSPWiki can also be configured to allow people to enter HTML,
but this is strongly discouraged as insecure.</p>
<h3>Installation and Configuration</h3>
<p>Ease of installation was a big plus for JSPWiki. If you have a
suitable Java servlet container already installed, installation on
Red Hat is very simple. Jakarta Tomcat was set up on the machine I
wanted to use. Installation was a simple matter of creating a
directory called mywiki in the Tomcat webapps directory, unpacking
JSPWiki.war and JSPWiki-samplepages.zip in that directory, editing
the configuration file, and restarting Tomcat.</p>
<pre>
    mkdir /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.19/webapps/mywiki
    pushd /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.19/webapps/mywiki
    /usr/local/j2sdk1.4.2_04/bin/jar xvf JSPWiki.war
    unzip ~neily/JSPWiki/JSPWiki-samplepages.zip
    emacs -nw /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.19/webapps/mywiki/WEB-INF/jspwiki.properties
    mkdir /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.19/webapps/mywiki/attached
    /usr/local/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.19/bin/catalina.sh start
</pre>
<p>The configuration file is
webapps/mywiki/WEB-INF/jspwiki.properties; this is well commented,
so configuration is simple.</p>
The configuration was a simple matter of changing 3 or 4 settings
in jspwiki.properties. The comments in this file are generally
pretty clear and most of the settings can be left unchanged.
Properties you should set are jspwiki.applicationName,
jspwiki.pageProvider, jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir,
jspwiki.attachmentProvider,
jspwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.storageDir,
<p>Installation on other Linux versions may not be as simple. I
later installed JSPWiki on a Debian machine, and found that,
although installation with apt-get was very simple, it wouldn't run
outside the default directory without more configuration.</p>
<p>To get it to work on Debian in a directory called mywiki, I had
to create the file /var/lib/tomcat4/webapps/mywiki.xml, which was
an edited copy of /var/lib/tomcat4/webapps/jspwiki.xml.</p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>JSPWiki provides a simple authentication mechanism. This can be
supplemented by authentication methods available from the servlet
container under which it runs.</p>
<p>As I was setting up a Wiki on a small private network,
authentication was unlikely to be an issue, but choosing a Wiki
with support for authentication allows it to be added later if the
Wiki is abused or we wish to set up an external Wiki.</p>
<p>Setting up basic authentication in JSPWiki should be simple. Add
the lines</p>
<pre>
  jspwiki.authenticator = FileAuthenticator
  jspwiki.fileAuthenticator.fileName = /path/to/passwords.txt
</pre>
<p>and create the passwords.txt file, which will look something
like</p>
<pre>
  # The format is simply username = password
  # No encryption is used currently.
  # Comments are allowed; prepend with hash.
  user1 = pass1
  user2 = pass2
</pre>
<p>If you need more sophisticated authorisation look at the
<a href="http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=AuthorizationAndAuthenticationHOWTO">
Authorization And Authentication HOWTO</a> and the <a href=
"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=AuthPlugin">Auth Plugin</a>.
If you still haven't found anything that meets your requirements,
you could consider writing your own <a href=
"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=Authenticator">Authenticator</a>
or using the authentication provided by your servlet container,
e.g., Tomcat.</p>
<h3>Version Control</h3>
<p>Version control is a useful feature, which stores each version
of a page as it is updated. This allows you to restore pages which
are lost or damaged. JSPWiki supports RCS-based version control and
also implements its own mechanism as an alternative for platforms
without RCS.</p>
<p>This does not appear to be a well documented feature, but is
fairly easy to use. Every time you save a change to a page, a new
version is stored. There is "more info" link at the bottom of each
page, which provides a link to previous versions of the page. You
can select any previous version, which is then displayed, with a
message explaining that it is not the current version of the page
and a "restore this page" link.</p>
Version control is particularly important on a publicly accessible
Wiki. These can be defaced with advertising and worse. Version
control allows you to easily revert to an undamaged page.
<p>To use RCS-based version control set jspwiki.pageProvider =
RCSFileProvider and jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir =
/path/to/dir/for/RCS/files</p>
<h3>Attachments</h3>
<p>JSPWiki allows you to attach files to a page. This can be a good
mechanism for sharing documents. If you refer to a large document,
or a document in a non-text format, attaching it to the page
ensures that it is accessible to your readers.</p>
<p>To use attachments set jspwiki.attachmentProvider =
BasicAttachmentProvider and
jspwiki.basicAttachmentProvider.storageDir =
/path/to/dir/for/attached/files.</p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>JSPWiki can be extended with the use of plugins. JSPWiki plugins
are written in Java, like JSPWiki itself. If you don't want to
<a href="http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=WritingPlugins">write
your own</a>, take a look at <a href=
"http://www.jspwiki.org/Wiki.jsp?page=ContributedPlugins">the
plugins that have already been contributed</a>.</p>
<h3>Using JSPWiki</h3>
<p>Using JSPWiki is dead simple. Once you've got it installed and
setup with all the features you want to use, just go to the main
page, set up some links to new pages, and edit them. Voila, you
have a Wiki. Start off with a page describing who the Wiki is for
and what you want to achieve with it, then let your imagination run
riot.</p>
