<h1>Away Mission - Recommended for March</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/dyckoff.html">Howard Dyckoff</a></b></p>

<p>
The Great Recession's impact continues to grow and there are fewer IT and
Open Source conferences on the horizon. However, three upcoming events are
worth mentioning - the annual RSA security confab at the beginning of
March, the Open Source Business Conference (OSBC), and EclipseCon.  All
three are in the SF Bay Area and you could spend a great month dropping in on
all three venues.  Of course, you will have to risk getting swabbed down by
TSA agents to get there. Security first.
</p>

<p>
This year, much of the discussion at RSA will focus on the Advanced
Pervasive Threat, or APT.  These are the increasingly sophisticated,
multi-pronged attacks and compromises from criminal syndicates and,
reportedly, from foreign state cyberwarfare agencies.  Perhaps WW-IV has
already started - but you'll have to come to this year's RSA to find out.
</p>

<p>
As always, or at least in recent years, a prominent security Fed will be
highlighted in a keynote.  This year, the high-profile industry experts
include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Robert Mueller, Director of the FBI
    <li> Richard Clarke, former U.S. Cyber Security Czar
    <li> Michael Chertoff, former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security
    <li> P.W. Singer, Director of the Brookings Institution's 21st Century Defense Initiative 
</ul>

<p>
If you would like to attend, visit this link: <a
href="http://www.rsaconference.com/2010/usa/last-chance/prospects.htm">http://www.rsaconference.com/2010/usa/last-chance/prospects.htm</a>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, some vendors like Tipping Point and Qualsys are offering
free expo passes that that will allow you to attend the Monday sessions
organized by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). I definitely recommend
going to the Monday TCG sessions. It may be a little late for this deal,
but try code SC10TPP.
</p>

<p>
OSBC is in its 7th year and is the leading business-oriented venue for
discussing open source companies and business models.  However, some of the
sessions do seem to be updates from the previous years.
</p>

<p>
It will be held again at the attractive and compact Palace Hotel in
downtown San Francisco which is a bit of a tourist magnet by itself.  The
West exit of the Montgomery St. BART station brings you up right by the
entrance.
</p>

<p>
 For this year the keynote addresses look at the developing open source
market:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> Jim Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat, will speak on evolving open source market. 
    <li>  Facebook insider David Recordon discusses how the popular social media site has scaled up using open source as a major part of its infrastructure.
    <li>  Tim O'Reilly will discuss the varied opportunities that open source presents. 
    <li> and Bob Sutor, IBM VP for Open Source and Linux, asks the hard questions about open source software and the communities that produce it.
</ul>
 
<p>
Here's the agenda for this year's Open Source Business Conference: <a
href="http://www.osbc.com/ehome/index.php?eventid=7578&amp;tabid=3659">http://www.osbc.com/ehome/index.php?eventid=7578&amp;tabid=3659</a>
</p>

<p>
And this link shows the sessions held in 2009: <a
href="http://www.infoworld.com/event/osbc/09/osbc_sessions.html">http://www.infoworld.com/event/osbc/09/osbc_sessions.html</a>
</p>

<p>
The EclipseCon schedule gets morphed for 2010.  It will offer EclipseCon
2010 talks on dozens of topics, going from 12-minute lightning talks,
which introduce new topics, to three-hour tutorials. For four days, there will be
morning hands-on tutorials, then technical sessions in the afternoon,
followed later by panel discussions.  This format might led to less
conference burnout.
</p>

<p>
EclipseCon this year will offer a new Unconference in addition to its usual
evening BOFs. The first three nights (Monday-Wednesday) will offer three
rooms with AV and a chance to present any Eclipse-relevant topic on a
first-come, first-served basis.  These presentations must be short (a
maximum of 25 minutes) and focused.
</p>

<p>
If you are quick, you can save a bit on the EclipseCon price - the advance
registration price is $1795 until March 19, 2010.  Here's the link to
register: <a href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2010/registration/">http://www.eclipsecon.org/2010/registration/</a>
</p>

<p>
Last year's EclipseCon was enjoyable but compressed and filled with session
conflicts.  To view many, many recorded videos from last year's eclipse,
just go to <a
href="http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009">http://www.eclipsecon.org/2009</a>
and select a session to play.  I would recommend the sessions on Android
and the Eclipse Ecosystem, e4 - flexible resources for next generation
applications and tools, and Sleeping Around: Writing tools that work in
Eclipse, Visual Studio, Ruby, and the Web.
