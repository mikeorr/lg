<h1>SVN Hackery: Versioning Your Linux Configuration</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/shirley.html">Stephen Shirley</A></b></p>

<h3>Basic Premise</h3>

<p class="editorial">
"So, let's assume that you're already familiar with <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">SVN</a>..." This might have made a
good start for an article that deals with refining and sharpening your
SVN-Fu and making you into an SVN Guru. Stephen's article, however, started
life as a tip posted to <a href="http://www.linux.ie/">ILUG</a> - and
gained a new lease on life when Rick Moen, a member of LG's staff and an
ILUG regular, forwarded it to me for possible inclusion in LG. At first, I
didn't see this idea as being all that revolutionary - but after an email
exchange with Stephen where he explained the finer points to me <a
name="shirley.html_1_back"></a><a href="#shirley.html_1">[1]</a>, I came to
appreciate it for what it is.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
SVN (Subversion, also known as "a compelling replacement for CVS") is a
central part of the LG publication process; after using it for a couple of
years and exploring its various features, I'm definitely a fan.  However,
SVN is not an end in itself but an important building block, a flexible
tool. In the case described here, it's used to provide a series of
<strong>versioned snapshots</strong> of your system - something that would
allow you to "roll it back" to a known-good version (creating a cron job
that would take those snapshots on a regular basis would, of course, be an
obvious complement to this.) In my opinion, that makes a very nice addition
to a system administrator's toolkit - one that's likely to save you untold
grief in a number of situations. That's the kind of ideas and systems I
like to expose to our readers; that, to me, is what makes Linux "just a
little more fun".<br>

<p>
So you have all of /etc stored in your SVN repository (say, at
file:///root/svn/etc).  That works nicely: it's trivially easy to see if
any files have changed, you can revert to any previous version, sleep well
at night - just great. Then you decide that you should also store /boot in
SVN (say, at file:///root/svn/boot). Also great. However, now in order to
check if anything has changed, you have to do:
</p>

<pre>
   cd /etc; svn status
   cd /boot; svn status
</pre>

<p>
If you add any more top-level directories to SVN, it quickly becomes a
pain to do this. So, you want to store / in SVN also (with the
appropriate "svn:ignore" properties set so that all the non-SVN'd
top-level dirs don't show up in 'svn status'). If, however, you now try
</p>

<pre>
   svn co file:///root/svn/ /
</pre>

<p>
it wont work as SVN will try to also check out /etc and /boot, and
will complain that those directories already exist. Hurm. If you try
the non-recursive checking
</p>

<pre>
   svn co -N file:///root/svn/ /
</pre>

<p>
it will check out file:///root/svn/ into / alright, but /etc and /boot 
will show up as unknown in "svn status":
</p>

<pre>
   fluff# svn status /
   ?    /boot
   ?    /etc
</pre>

<p>
Fixing this requires some minor hackery of the .svn/ special
directory. If you open /.svn/entries in a text editor, youll see
something like:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;wc-entries
  xmlns="svn:"&gt;
&lt;entry
  committed-rev="226"
  name=""
  committed-date="2006-08-17T22:34:00.835159Z"
  url="file:///root/svn"
  last-author="root"
  kind="dir"
  uuid="18f6e95b-a6ff-0310-910f-8823210a8ec4"
  revision="226"/&gt;
&lt;/wc-entries&gt;
</pre>

<p>
It contains a single &lt;entry ... /&gt; tag, with the name attribute set to
"". This is the SVN entry for '/' itself. If you open '/etc/.svn/entries'
in a text editor, you'll find a very similar &lt;entry... name=""... /&gt;
tag:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;entry
  committed-rev="25"
  name=""
  committed-date="2005-09-22T20:33:37.949298Z"
  url="file:///root/svn/etc"
  last-author="root"
  kind="dir"
  uuid="18f6e95b-a6ff-0310-910f-8823210a8ec4"
  revision="25"/&gt;
</pre>

<p>
So, to make SVN consider /etc to be part of the / working directory,
what you need to do is this: copy the above &lt;entry.../&gt; tag from
/etc/.svn/entries into /.svn/entries, placing it just before the
closing &lt;/wc-entries&gt; tag. Then, change the 'name' attribute from ""
to "etc". The complete finished /.svn/entries file should look like
this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;wc-entries
  xmlns="svn:"&gt;
&lt;entry
  committed-rev="226"
  name=""
  committed-date="2006-08-17T22:34:00.835159Z"
  url="file:///root/svn"
  last-author="root"
  kind="dir"
  uuid="18f6e95b-a6ff-0310-910f-8823210a8ec4"
  revision="226"/&gt;
&lt;entry
  committed-rev="25"
  name="etc"
  committed-date="2005-09-22T20:33:37.949298Z"
  url="file:///root/svn/etc"
  last-author="root"
  kind="dir"
  uuid="18f6e95b-a6ff-0310-910f-8823210a8ec4"
  revision="25"/&gt;
&lt;/wc-entries&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Now when you check the SVN status of /, it no longer considers /etc to
be a foreign object:
</p>

<pre>
   fluff# svn status /
   ?    /boot
</pre>

<p>
Bingo. If you repeat the process again for /boot (i.e. copy the
&lt;entry... name=""... /&gt; tag from /boot/.svn/entries into /.svn/entries
before the closing &lt;/wc-entries&gt; tag, and set the name attribute to be
"boot") and any other applicable dirs; SVN will then start treating
them as proper checked-out subdirs of the working dir.
</p>

<p>
As your reward, a single 'svn status /' will now check all of the
top-level dirs that are stored in Subversion, making it much easier to
keep track of things.
</p>

<p>
<a name="shirley.html_1"></a><a href="#shirley.html_1_back">[1]</a>
Our exchange went something like this:
</p>

<pre>
Ben &gt; &gt; Why not just do 'svn status /etc /boot', or even a little script that
Ben &gt; &gt; would read the list of directories in SVN and report on them? E.g.,
Ben &gt; &gt; 
Ben &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------
Ben &gt; &gt; #!/bin/bash
Ben &gt; &gt; 
Ben &gt; &gt; cd /root/svn
Ben &gt; &gt; svn status `echo *|sed 's|\&lt;|/|g'`
Ben &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------
&gt;
Steve &gt; For what i explicitly stated, yes, that's a neat enough solution.
Steve &gt; Other solutions that were posted in response on the ILUG list involved
Steve &gt; using the "svn:externals" property on / to achieve roughly the same
Steve &gt; thing. The downside to doing this is that you lose the benefit of a
Steve &gt; cohesive working directory. You can't do atomic commits (you have to
Steve &gt; do one per /, /etc and /boot instead). It also doesn't work with
Steve &gt; branching etc. And of course you have to remember to run a script
Steve &gt; rather than just 'svn status' when you're working on stuff.
Steve &gt; 
Steve &gt; All in all, my solution is probably overkill for most people, i just
Steve &gt; thought i'd document it seeing as i discovered it was possible with a
Steve &gt; moderate amount of effort, and it makes things nice and elegant for
Steve &gt; me, even when i set up svn for /etc before realising that i want it
Steve &gt; for other top-level dirs too.
Steve &gt;
Steve &gt; By all means publish it if you think it's genuinely useful to others,
Steve &gt; but i'd perfectly understand if you don't -)
