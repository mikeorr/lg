&gt; &gt;&gt; I just read your fascinating essay 'Kudzu and the California Marriage
&gt; &gt;&gt; Amendment'; one niggle, however: 'Stanlislawa Walasiewiczowna' should
&gt; &gt;&gt; be spelled 'Stanislawa Walasiewiczowna' (or, with full Polish
&gt; &gt;&gt; diacritics, 'Stanis?awa Walasiewiczówna')
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Thank you, sir.  I was copying a third-party source, and it didn't look
&gt; &gt; quite right, but I forgot I had a Polish-speaker I could check with.  ;-&gt;
&gt; &gt;
&gt; 
&gt; I actually found your essay while trying to take a break from Polish -
&gt; I'm currently wading my way through 'Pan Tadeusz', first in English,
&gt; then in Polish, proofreading the scans as I go to possibly send to
&gt; Project Gutenberg. It thus came as something of a minor shock to find
&gt; yet more Polish in your essay - and I was already in 'error checking
&gt; mode', so... <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</pre>

<p>
It's good to hear that the tragic historical trainwreck caused first by
the "liberum veto", and then by Poland being in harm's way and attempting
to be a liberal parliamentary democracy midway between three of the most
powerful of Europe's autocratic dynasties (Catherine the Great,
Frederick II and Frederick William II of the Hohenzollerns, and several
Austrian emperors) produced <em>something</em> good.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, one of the reasons I hastened to finish that essay is that my
family is going on holiday, starting tomorrow, on a cruise ship.  We're
going to be visiting London, Copenhagen, Berlin, Talinn, St. Petersburg,
Helsinki, Stockholm, Oslo, and London again, and arriving back on Sept.
19th.
</p>

<p>
My apologies for not having had time to help copyedit the September
_Linux Gazette_:  I've been busy getting ready to leave.

The Lithuanians like to claim Mickiewicz as their own, citing the
opening line of that book - 'Lithuania, my fatherland' - conveniently
ignoring that the /rest/ of the book is a paean to the ways of life of
the Polish nobility. Interesting topic in itself, but I mention in to
introduce this:
</p>

<pre>
The Polish Prime Minister was summoned to Moscow, to meet Brezhnev:
'And what of this Mickiewicz, this Polish writer, who writes that
Lithuania is his fatherland?'
'But he's dead now!'
'Ah. I like how you work'
</pre>

<p>
Anyway, I've put a small excerpt from book one online here:

He was also clearly thinking of the historical identity of his country
as the "Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth" under which the Grand Duchy of
Lithuania and Polish kingdom (including parts of present-day Belarus, Latvia, 
Ukraine, Estonia, and wester Russia) were united for over 200 years, and
was arguably Poland's golden age.  It was common to refer to the united

I've heard quite a lot of the history, from both Poles and Lithuanians
<img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> The area where the story takes place was traditionally part of
Lithuania (and is again), though at the time, populated almost
entirely by Poles. My friend's father hails from somewhere close by,
from where he was repatriated after the borders changed.

Rick, I hope you and yours enjoy the trip - it sounds like it's going to
be an amazing experience!
</p>

<p>
While we're (peripherally) on the subject of not having time, though:
since the Okopnik family is 1) in Florida, 2) on a boat, and 3) in the
midst of the hurricane season - and it's a king hell bastard of one,
with tropical depressions spinning up into storms and becoming
hurricanes at record speeds - please excuse the long delays in mail
response, etc. Crew and ship safety take precedence over everything
else.
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, Michael's 1st birthday was on August 20th - and he had a
rather boisterous (and unwelcome) guest come to visit.

</p>

<p>
We weathered Fay just fine, and Gustav passed us by - but at this point,
the predictions are for Hurricane Hanna to visit us, and Tropical Storm
Ike is already spinning up out there in the Atlantic. It feels a bit
like being at the wrong end of a shooting gallery... I'm <strong>more</strong> than
ready for this hurricane season to be over.

I expect so!  I haven't ever been the St. Petersburg, but I <em>have</em> been
to Leningrad.  I even stayed at the Hotel Astoria, the place Herr Hitler
had earmarked to host his reception ball.  (It seems they lost his
reservation, though.)

There was a classic Soviet-era joke, about a city-dwelller's answers to a
set of survey questions:
</p>


<pre>
Q: Where were you born?
A: St. Petersburg.
 
Q: Where did you go to school?
A: Petrograd.
 
Q: Where do you live now?
A: Leningrad.
 
Q: And where would you like to live?
A: St. Petersburg.

Heh. During the Soviet era, that kind of an answer would definitely get
the respondent a different place of residence... somewhere with a
northern view. In every direction.
</p>

<p>
In a similar story, Aleksandra Yablochkina (one of the great Russian
actresses whose career included the pre- and post-Revolutionary periods)
was asked how she visualized life under communism. "Oh, it'll be
marvelous! There will be plenty of food, everyone will have their own
house, people will be respectful and polite, the streets will be clean
and neat... In general, just like it was in the Tzar's time..."
</p>

<p>
Oddly enough - whether due to her immense popularity or because of her
reputation for naivete and plain speaking - she was not, erm, "sent
away".

I try to not tell Russian jokes - especially not those I hear from
Russians! - since the last time I retold one of your jokes (also about
Brezhnev, IIRC) in a pub, and, upon finishing, received a tap on the
shoulder from a tall, stern looking gentleman who stared me down for a
few minuts, before declaring "I'm Russian"; waiting, staring me down
(as I mentally ran the gamut of English swear words in my head,
finding it lacking) - before finally bursting into laughter. Mere
jokes shouldn't provide that 'uh oh' feeling, dammt!

The story told (somewhat nervously) about Yuri Andropov that, from his
days in Hungary and then running the KGB, he'd grown to absolutely love
political humour -- to the point that he not only collected those jokes,
but also those who told them.

They used to tell that one about Khruschev, as well. In fact, Nikita was
responsible for a large percentage of all political jokes - even after
his "retirement"...
</p>

<p>
In 1965, the city of Odessa (a city with a large Jewish population, and
thus a city justly known for its sense of humor) petitioned the Soviet
government to reinstate Comrade Khruschev. When asked why, they
responded "better ten more years without food than even one more year
without laughter!"
