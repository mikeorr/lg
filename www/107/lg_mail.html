<P>
This last issue we had an article about diving into Gentoo, and the
response was great.  What I'd like to see is some of you send us in some
<em>more</em> great <A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net/107/tips.html">2c Tips</A>!
about things that are specific to <EM>your</EM>
favorite distribution, with a neat little description that describes
why they're so handy.
</P>
<P>
People can spend hours surfing the man pages
or reading the "get started guide" in their boxed product - but we
all know that a lot of linuxers get started with a disc from friends
and some simple enthusiasm.  So... let's <EM>Make Linux A Little More Fun</EM>
for them

<P>
I'd love to see an article describing how a company really got interested
in open source, a bit of the thought processes and internal changes that
went with looking at it, considering if it worked for them.  I believe
such an article would be equally useful if it described why one didn't,
or did, take it on in various departments, and how much of it the company
was able to let in.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, how completely it worked out <EM>after</EM> implementation would be
great to hear about.  We see occasional tidbits of this sort of thing
offered as "case studies" and so on, but rather few of them have more
than a sound byte here and there from anyone who really lived through the
changes, drove the meetings, pondered the legal entanglements and so on.
</P>
<P>
Contact <A HREF="mailto:articles@lists.linuxgazette.net"
	>articles@lists.linuxgazette.net</A> if you've got something for us. Get whatever
internal approvals you need, and if you decide to make $company anonymous,
don't forget to sanitize tidbits like any IP addresses or partner companies
you mention, too.

<P>
I just stumbled across something interesting (to me, anyway), while
reading Groklaw.  I had mentioned in a msg to TAG a while back that I was
getting an boot time error msg on this Inspiron:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
"Dell Inspiron with broken BIOS detected. Refusing to enable the local
APIC."
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
That's with a 2.4 kernel.  I had resigned myself to the fact that there
was a flaw in the BIOS, while wondering why they had never bothered to fix
such a problem in all of the BIOS revisions that Dell has issued for the
machine.
</P>
<P>
I've noticed that the error is absent when I boot from a recent 2.6
kernel, so figured that there was something relevant and long standing in
Linux ACPI support that had been fixed in 2.6 kernels.  But now it seems
that the kernel developers may have just discovered how to deal with
Dell's (intentionally quirky) implementation of the standard.  Actually,
the whole Groklaw post was interesting, so I'll include it here, but the
last paragraph is what my post is about.  Note: the general theme of the
thread is about trying to buy a Dell with Linux pre-loaded.  For more more
info see:

<P>
I was on a plane recently, sitting next to a guy who claimed to be a Dell
senior sales VP. I mentioned I had bypassed Dell for a purchase a week or
so before, because they don't support Linux. He acted surprised, and said
I should visit their web site. I told him I had visited the site (and saw
what PJ reported here); despite a claim to support Linux, it is almost
impossible to buy a Dell machine with Linux.
</P>
<P>
He continued to act surprised. I told him to visit his own website from a
customer POV and he'd see what I meant.
</P>
<P>
Don't trust Dell: they make nice machines, but they are on their knees for
Gates. I put Dell in the same category as HP (broken ACPI (nonstandard),
that they only tell Microsoft how to get around). 2+ years after Presario
release, they have still not fixed it.

<P>
Mike,
</P>
<P>
I just read your article in Linux Gazette online on Installing Gentoo,
and thought I could help with a few of the problems you have experienced.
</P>
<P>
If OpenOffice did not compile, you could try openoffice-bin.
</P>
<P>
I'm not sure if I can help with package documentation. There is good
general documentation on how Gentoo-specific nuances work by following
the "Docs" link from the top of the home page.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">We moved a handful of his - and other Gentoo using readers' tips - into
our 2c Tips section, so they're easier to search for.  Thanks to everybody
who wrote in, especially those of you who don't see your name in lights;
many Tips were repeats, and we tried to take the best explanations.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
I hope these suggestions help. I have found the Gentoo documentation and
the Forums to be infinitely helpful. Now this former Windows advocate
compiles his own kernel on a regular basis including software RAID and
bootsplash tweaks. It's addicting!
</P>
<P>
Enjoy,
</P>
<P>
Kevin

Hi Mike,
</P>
<P>
Nice to hear you tried out Gentoo 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
I wanted to ad a few comments to your article:
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Some tips, too, but go see the 2c tips section for that.
 -- Heather</font></blockquote>
<P>
Whenever there's a problem, I've almost always found the answer by
searching forums.gentoo.org - even though the search feature in phpBB does
not work very well, when there's so many posts as in this case. I've
written  a small and easy howto, about how they could make it indexable by
google (see <A HREF="http://klavsen.info/simpleurls"
	>http://klavsen.info/simpleurls</A> ) but they haven't picked it
up, even though I've written it to gentoo-dev. This unfortunatley means
the forums, which are a true treasure of knowledge, goes unknown to many

<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
If the problem isn't solved by searching/posting to forums, a post to
bugs.gentoo.org usually quickly resolves it (if it's a bug ofcourse, but
it you don't get an answer in the forums, it most usually is 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P>
All in all, a very important part of Gentoo, is the fact that besides, the
great documentation, there's so many competent users in the forums and on
the mailinglists, so getting help finding a solution (and learning a lot
in the process) seems almost inevitable (if ones open for learning -
Gentoo is IMHO not minded for people who does not want to learn how things
really work - but just want something that "just works").
</P>
<P>
By using Gentoo I've learned a lot, that I can make good use of, with
other distributions as well, so it is a good learning experience, not only
in Gentoo - but also with Linux. This same thing is why the
forums.gentoo.org should be google indexed, as the knowledge does not only
apply to Gentoo.
</P>

<P>
Just saw your article on Gentoo Installation, by coincidence, just as I was in the process of giving up on my own install of Gentoo. Been working on it off and on all day, finally got the kernel compiled. Yeah, I did it manually. Think I got it right, although the manual does not look the kernel config I was running. Wonder why? (the latest .4 kernel, r9, just downloaded today.)
</P>
<P>
Then I noted that loading some of the kernel packages like the Nvidia packages may well drag in stuff I wanted excluded in the USE variable, so I should use the pretend option to see what might possibly go wrong. This made me feel dizzy, even dizzier as I looked at what still lies ahead. In my present ill-tempered state, I feel like making the snide remark that so far I have not done anything far as I can tell that a good installation script could not do.
</P>
<P>
Guess I'll go get something to eat, replenish my blood sugar, and then think about it. I am learning quite a lot ... probably good for me ... but ... what keeps occurring to me is, since I am doing all this the long way around, why am I not installing <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A> instead? Keeping in mind that I am starving and the question may not be rational:
</P>
<P><BLOCKQuote>
Eh ... not putting you on the spot ... but in a sentence or two, why would I want to run Gentoo instead of FreeBSD, nevermind that one is Linux and one is Berkeley UNIX. And both Gentoo and FreeBSD seem to have outstandingly brilliant groups of people supporting them. Just curious.
</BLOCKQuote></P>
<P>
And don't ask if I'm a man or a mouse! "Got any cheese, sir? Squeak! Squeak!"
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">Thanks for the counterpoint view, William.  There's lots of people, and no need to do things just one way.  For that matter ... this may be <EM>Linux</EM> Gazette, but those BSDers are fellow open source'rers too.  (If this makes you wonder where their magazine is, dear readers, it's called DaemonNews - <A HREF="http://ezine.daemonnews.org"
