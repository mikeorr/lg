<P>
Here are some links and news related to the DMCA which you might find of
interest.
<P>
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947729.html">
News.com has reported</a> that
some of the supporters who helped the DMCA pass are having second thoughts.
This has emerged through a RIAA vs Silicon Valley debate sponsored by the
Cato Institute.
Wired 
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,54270,00.html">
also reported</a>
on the same debate, focusing on how the computing revolution of 1950-2000
wouldn't have happened under today's copyright regime (DMCA).  This recalls
George Monbiot's
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/globalisation/story/0,7369,665969,00.html">
article</a> describing historically how the <em>absence</em> of patents has
produced strong economic growth.
<P>
<hr noshade width="20%"> 
<P>
Declan McCullagh of News.com has 
written that 
<a href="http://news.com.com/2010-12-950229.html?tag=fd_lede">
the DMCA is not so bad</a>
and the EFF is overreacting. 
<blockquote>
    "The DMCA is both an egregious law and a brazen power grab by Hollywood,
    the music industry and software companies. It is probably
    unconstitutional. It creates unnecessary federal crimes, cedes too much
    authority to copyright holders, and should be unceremoniously tossed
    out by the courts...  [However,] a careful look at the DMCA shows that, far from
    prohibiting all security research, the law does not regulate as many
    activities as people seem to believe. And if activists hope to assail a
    law like the DMCA, they'll be taken more seriously if they know what
    they're talking about."
</blockquote>
Slashdot readers 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/08/19/1623242.shtml?tid">
generally reacted with scepticism</a>, though there were some dissenting
voices.
LWN's 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/6998/">
coverage of these issues</a> is interesting reading too.
Also worth a look are
<a href="http://www.mccullagh.org/theme/dmca-celebration-may02.html">
Declan's photos</a>

<P>
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/26468.html">
The Register reported</a> recently that
HP made moves to use the DMCA to quash a Tru64 bug report.
Later on, they appeared to see the public relations nightmare the tactic
could turn into
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/26508.html">
and abandoned the DMCA-fuelled madness</a>.  Maybe Alan Cox wasn't so far
off the mark before when he began censoring his changelogs.

The Register
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/26717.html">
recently reported</a>
on the proposed United Kingdom implementation of the European
Union Copyright Directive (sometimes called "Europe's DMCA").
Comments are 
<a href="http://www.patent.gov.uk/about/consultations/eccopyright/index.htm">
currently being taken</a>
by the UK Patent Office, and these could influence the final shape of the
law.  It could 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26788.html">
turn out badly</a>, but if the UK government is encouraged to take
advantage of all available opt-outs, it would be a help.
Obviously this is primarily of interest to UK readers, but it has
relevance to all EU readers.

Another
<a href="http://www.janisian.com/article-internet_debacle">
interesting article</a>, on the subject of online music/media distribution

Microsoft and other players on the proprietary software scene
have been sufficiently rattled by advances of open source software
into government infrastructure to 
<a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-949527.html">
set up a lobby group</a> [News.com]
called
<em>The Initiative for Software Choice</em>
to convince governments in Europe and South America that legislation
favoring open-source software is not in their best interest.  
<P>
This is a reaction to developments such as
California's proposed
<em>Digital Software Security Act</em>, which would forbid the state
from purchasing closed-source software.  However,
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/7697/">
as LWN reports</a>, the law is quite extreme and has little chance of
actually being passed.  None the less, it is good to see these ideas
floating into the mainstream.  In a similar vein, it has been reported that
the Spanish Administration
<a href="http://newsvac.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/08/02/1321207&mode=thread&tid=51">
has been pleased</a>
with its initial experiences of Linux.

</FONT>

<P>
The project to get Linux running on an XBox is proceeding quickly.
In August
<a href="http://newsvac.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=02/08/17/1558213&mode=thread&tid=23">
the news emerged</a>
that the 
<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2120784,00.html">
first functional version</a>
of
<a href="http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/">
XBox Linux</a>
had been released.  At time of writing, the current release is 0.2, and
features framebuffer support 
(<a href="http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/screenshots.php">screenshots here</a>).
ISO images are available for download from the
<a href="http://xbox-linux.sourceforge.net/">
project's Sourceforge site</a>.
The project has not run entirely smoothly, however, and it
<a href="http://newsforge.com/newsforge/02/08/28/180256.shtml?tid=23">
was recently reported</a>
that project founder Enrico Kern has left the development group due to
differences with the current team leader.

<P>
<a href="http://www.openssh.org/">
OpenSSH</a> was trojaned in early August.  The 
<a href="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/advisories/other_advisory-2232.html">
LinuxSecurity.com advisory</a> has details on how to tell if you are
affected (basically, you should be worried if you downloaded the OpenSSH
source between 30th July 2002 and 1st August 2002).
<P>
You can read news coverage of the vulnerability
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/26492.html">
at The Register</a>, and

<FONT COLOR="green">We Want Linux Survey
</FONT>
</H3> 
<P>
<a href="http://www.wewantlinux.org">
We Want Linux</a>, a self-funded non-commercial group of IT professionals,
would like to see the computing consumer have as many options in the
marketplace as possible, and in particular would like to see those who have an
interest in GNU/Linux be able to try out a demo machine in stores like
CompUSA and Best Buy, the same way they can right now with Windows.
The group
also feels that the potential Linux desktop user ought to have the same
opportunity as those who use Windows, that is, to buy a computer with
Linux pre-loaded and thereby avoid the hassle of installing an
operating system.
To these ends the group have created a web site
<a href="http://www.wewantlinux.org">
www.wewantlinux.org</a>,
for the purpose of surveying the computer-buying public and
determining how much demand there is for off-the-shelf computers with
GNU/Linux pre-loaded. You are invited to visit the site and participate
in the survey.  Once a significant amount of survey data has been gathered,
the findings  will be presented to the retailers in the hope of persuading
them to demo Linux in their stores.

Telia Connect,
a Danish subsidiary of Telia, a Scandinavian

long-term agreement with the Nuremberg-based 
<a href="http://www.suse.de/en">
SuSE Linux AG</a>
for the maintenance of its IBM zSeries G7 mainframe systems.
Telia Connect's positive experience with SuSE Linux Enterprise 
Server started in 2001, when the ISP consolidated a heterogeneous 
farm of 70 Unix servers on one IBM mainframe. Since then, the 
Internet pages and e-mail accounts of more than 400,000 customers 
continue to be processed on one single IBM S/390 mainframe.

MTU Aero Engines</a>
has decided to 
<a href="http://www.suse.com/us/company/press/press_releases/archive02/mtu_aero_engines.html">
use a Linux cluster for its engine development</a>.
The Linux cluster 
consists of 64 Dell PowerEdge 1550 standard rack servers with two 
1.13 GHz Intel Pentium III processors each, and a total main 
memory of 144 GB SDRAM for the implementation of additional 
computing capacities.
SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 7
is used as 
the operating system. The computers are networked using Fast 
Ethernet and 2 GBit/s Myrinet.
