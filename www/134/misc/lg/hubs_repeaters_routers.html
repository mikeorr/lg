 I've taken the liberty of giving this thread a proper subject,
rather than "(no subject)". Anyone reading this who doesn't know
already, it really <strong>is</strong> better to have an informative subject line! -

I'm doing an article on 'Hubs vs repeaters' and 'Hubs vs Routers'. Could you send me some articles or where I can get this information? I will greatly appreciate it.

You're doing your <em>homework</em>, is what you meant to say.  A repeater is
something which propagates electrical signals from A -&gt; B, amplifying
the signal as it does so.  A Hub is a device which connects many
computers together, typically broadcasting the same information to each
node (c.f. with switches, for instance.)  A router is something else,
but I've given you too much information already.

<p>
Can I have your teacher's email address?  I'd like to make him aware
that his students are imbeciles when it comes to doing something called
_proper research_.

Thomas, that was entirely too harsh and completely unnecessary. I would
appreciate it if you'd stop flaming people here. A bit of irony isn't
out of place when you see less than reasonable behavior, but out-and-out
insults are way over the top.

Who ever said I was doing this for a teacher??? And I would watch out who you call imbeciles!!!!!! It could get you into a lot of trouble. I don't think asking a supposedly a 
  person that is to know their stuff something is stupid!!! When I was in school I was told no question was stupid and anyone who didn't ask was!!! So this is all I have to say to whose imbeciles who think they know everything!!!!! Thanks but no thanks!!!

First of all please don't shout---it hurts my eyes.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, while I do agree that Thomas' reply was a bit on the rude
side, he <strong>did</strong> give you some information. You could start by thanking
him for that if it was not irrelevant. Perhaps what you meant to write
was:
<pre>
	"Thanks for the information you provided. [It was not particularly
	useful however.] What I meant to ask was whether LG has published any
	articles on this kind of stuff. I realise now that dashing off such a
	query without consulting the standard web search engines was a
	mistake. I will clarify my question in a later mail."
 
	"By the way, I found your insinuation that I was getting you to help
	with my homework very annoying and your use of the term 'imbecile'
	was downright rude. Perhaps you will not be hearing from me again after
	all!"
</pre>
Regards,
</p>

Kapil.
