<P>Welcome as a future fellow of feddi and bt :-)</P>
<P>Congratulations for your decision to install this package. It's not too
complicated, the only troubles you may run in are some permissions. The
sources included in this package have already been patched to grant a
smoother working.</P>
<P>As well <CODE>fmbedit</CODE> as <CODE>bt</CODE> show some minor problems, so don't flame
as much and think that you didn't pay anything for it. You may contribute
correcting bugs. Don't hold them for yourself, share them. Send me patches
and will make this software improve. A hint: don't run it under <CODE>X</CODE>,
the terminal data base doesn't work smoothly, I'm up to fix this. Surely,
some day I'll be able to path this :-) (I used to say this would be the
next :-DDDDDDDDDDD)</P>
