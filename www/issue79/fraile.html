<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>

<P>The
firm I work for had a fax system integrated in the corporate e-mail
platform, Microsoft Exchange, for sending and
receiving. One day after a software upgrade, the system
broke. We needed to find something with the equivalent
functionality but with the following conditions:
<UL>
	<LI>
	Minimum cost, or better still, no cost at all, especially regarding
	software licenses.
	<LI>
	Transparent integration with the end user's software tools
	(basically Microsoft Office).
	<LI>
	No need to install any software on the client side, even free
	software, in order to minimize the work load of the network
	administrators.
</UL>
<P>This
article describes how the integration of several open source
applications on a Linux platform has fulfilled all of
these conditions.

<h2><b>Acknowledgments</b></h2>

<P>I
want to express my gratitude to various persons or organizations
without whose assistant I would have  never written this article.
First, to the members
of the IT department in the Solvay Qu&iacute;mica S. L. plant at
Torrelavega, Spain.
Second, to my firm's
hierarchy for their approval and support of this article's writing.
Last and most
especially, to all the contributors to the Open Source projects
mentioned throughout this text, to the participants in the HylaFAX
mailing list (which have given me essential information) and to Craig
Kelly, developer of the smbfax client tool.

<h2><b>System overview</b></h2>

<P>To clarify which computer I'm talking about where,
I'll refer to the PC where the fax software is
installed as TOSERFAX.
<P>
The applied solution
involves the HylaFAX software. This application controls the
installed modems, distributes the incoming faxes and sends the
outgoing ones.
<P>
The incoming faxes are converted to PDF format and forwarded via SMTP e-mail to
their respective destinations. PDF was chosen because Acrobat
Reader is part of the standard software platform at the site. The destination
is ascertained via certain rules as will be later explained.
<P>
If someone wants to send
a fax, he prints the document in a printer queue
on TOSERFAX, which Samba makes visible to all the other computers. The print
job will cause an e-mail to be sent to the user that has spooled the job. This
e-mail includes the URL of a web form created on-the-fly in the Apache web
server.  The web form allows the user to fill in the fax details, particularly
the destination phone number. Once the user has completed the form, upon
clicking on the &quot;Send&quot; button, the fax is finally put on the outgoing
queue.

<h2><b>Hardware and Software</b></h2>

<P>TOSERFAX's
hardware is the following:
<UL>
	<LI>
	PC Dell Optiplex GX150, running a 1 Ghz Pentium III processor, with
	256 MB of RAM and a hard disk of 20 GB. The modems are 3Com US
	Robotics 56K Faxmodem.</P>
</UL>
<P>As
far as software is concerned:
<UL>
	<LI>The
	base system is the SuSE Linux 7.2 distribution. It includes 
	<A HREF="http://www.hylafax.org/">HylaFAX</A> version 4.1beta2, the Apache web server version 1.3.19 and the SMTP
	server sendmail version 8.11.3.
	
	<LI><A HREF="http://www.samba.org/">Samba</A>
	version 2.2.3a.
	
	<LI>Fax sending from
	the clients is implemented using the package <A HREF="http://inconnu.isu.edu/~ink/new/projects/smbfax/">smbfax</A>,
	version 1.4.
</UL>

<h2><b>HylaFAX installation
and configuration</b></h2>

The
installation of HylaFAX was carried out following the standard
procedures, clearly explained in the documentation. The most delicate
part is the modem configuration. HylaFAX does not
include a template for the US Robotics 56K Faxmodem. However, a
search in its mailing list provided the needed information, which
resulted in the file /var/spool/fax/etc/config.ttyS0 (and
config.ttyS1 for the second modem). The first of these files can be
found <A HREF="misc/fraile/config.ttyS0">here</A>.

<h2><b>Receiving faxes</b></h2>

<P>Our
plant has several telephone numbers that are connected to fax
machines. The telephone exchange can divert phone calls
originally made to one extension to a different one. This feature
makes it possible to centralize the reception of all faxes in
TOSERFAX without any change in the phone numbers that are accessible
to the public.

<P>For example, suppose the Purchasing Department has 5550001 as
fax number, while Logistics has 5550002. One of TOSERFAX's modems is
connected to the internal extension 1700. The PBX diverts all
incoming calls to 5550001 and 5550002 to the extension 1700, where
TOSERFAX receives the fax.

<P>
But
or course, the person that should receive the faxes to Purchasing is
not the same one that should get the ones to Logistics. HylaFAX
manages incoming faxes by way of the scripts faxrcvd and FaxDispatch,
placed in /var/spool/fax/bin. The discrimination we want requires
knowledge of the fax number the fax was originally sent to, which is
not known in the standard version of faxrcvd. A workaround is to
recover that number from the session log,
assigning it to a variable, for instance TOPHONE.

<PRE>
	TOPHONE=$($AWK '/SESSION BEGIN/ {print $NF; exit}' log/c${COMMID})
</PRE>

<P>The
new versions of faxrcvd and FaxDispatch can be found <A HREF="misc/fraile/faxrcvd">here</A>
and <A HREF="misc/fraile/FaxDispatch">here</A>.

<P>The
standard version of faxrcvd sends the fax to the addressee as a
postscript attachment in an e-mail. This is not the best option at my
plant, as the standard PC does not include a postscript
viewer. But it does include a PDF viewer, and postscript files can
be converted to PDF.

<P>However,
here we run into a small problem, related to the sending of the
e-mail message with the attached file. TOSERFAX uses as SMTP relay a
Windows NT server running IIS version 4. For some reason that I have
not been able to discover, this server could not distribute the
e-mails with attachments created with faxrcvd.

<P>The
solution was to use the tool &quot;metasend&quot;, included in the
packages metamail 2.7.19. The scripts <A HREF="misc/fraile/metasend.sh.txt">metasend.sh</A>
and <A HREF="misc/fraile/tiff2pdf.sh.txt">tiff2pdf.sh</A>
succeed in sending the fax, previously transformed into PDF format,
in a way that is acceptable for the SMTP relay. It is worth
mentioning that these scripts invoke the tools tiff2ps and gs.

<h2><b>Sending faxes</b></h2>

<P>There are several fax
clients written to be used with HylaFAX, for multiple platforms.
However, IT administrators at Torrelavega would rather avoid any
software installation on the clients. The only operation at the
site's PCs should be, at the most, the configuration of a network
printer, and it should be made automatically by the end user himself,
if possible.
<P>
Using a printer queue
has the added advantage that any application that is able to print a
document (that is, practically all applications) will be able to fax.
In this respect, the fax solution described in this article is
clearly superior to other proprietary systems installed in Microsoft
Exchange, which only allow to send faxes generated by some
applications, for instance those in the Microsoft Office suite.
<P>
The package smbfax,
developed by Craig Kelly, fulfills the above mentioned requirement.
The underlying idea is very clever: the client prints the document he
wants to fax in a printer queue, configured in TOSERFAX with Samba,
and which features a postscript printer. The printing provokes in
fact the execution of a perl script, which puts the printed document
into a file and sends the client an e-mail with an URL in it. This URL
is a link to a web form created on the fly in the web server at
TOSERFAX (Apache). The client clicks on the URL, fires the browser
and, using the web form, fills in the number or numbers the fax
should be sent to, chooses whether a cover page should be added, and
other details. Finally, upon clicking on the &quot;Send&quot; button,
the fax is put in the outbound queue. In case there is any error
processing the job, the client will equally be notified by e-mail.
Obviously, this system requires knowing the identity of the user who
is faxing (it must be possible to get the authentication credentials
he have acquired upon logging in the Windows PC) as well as his
e-mail address.
<P>
The installation of
smbfax is straightforward. The package documentation clearly explains
the different steps, and repeating them here would just be redundant.
<P>
Configuring Samba, on
the other hand, does show some interesting tricks. The pertinent file
can be seen <A HREF="misc/fraile/smb.conf">here</A>. The
following lines must be emphasized:
<PRE>
[global]
	workgroup = DOM
	netbios name = TOSERFAX
	security = DOMAIN
	winbind uid = 10000-20000
	winbind gid = 10000-20000
	template homedir = /home/win/%D/%U
	winbind separator = +
	printer admin = @DOM+PRINTADMIN
	...

[print$]
	path = /etc/samba/printers/
	browseable = yes
	read only = yes
	write list = @DOM+PRINTADMIN,root

# The fax queue is configured in this section 
[fax]
	comment = Fax queue
	path = /tmp
	printable = Yes
	writable = no
	create mode = 0700
	guest ok = no
	postscript = Yes
	printing = lprng
	print command = /usr/local/smbfax/smbfax -r queue %u %s
	lpq command = /usr/local/smbfax/smbfax show
	lprm command = /usr/local/smbfax/smbfax dequeue %j
</PRE>
<P>As a Samba server,
TOSERFAX is included in a Windows 2000 domain (Active Directory).
Samba version 2.2.3 features support for &quot;winbindd&quot;, which
provides client authentication based on the credentials obtained upon
starting a session in the domain. As a consequence, to create the
Windows users in the Linux box is no longer needed. Each client that
connects for the first time to the Samba server will be identified by
the combination &lt;Domain name&gt;+&lt;User name&gt;, and will earn
an &quot;uid&quot; in the range 10000 - 20000. Inside the [fax]
section, the line
<PRE>
	print command = /usr/local/smbfax/smbfax -r queue %u %s
</PRE>
<P>invokes the program
smbfax passing in the parameter %u the name of the user, identified
as previously explained.
<P>
Inside the [global]
section, the line
<PRE>
	printer admin = @DOM+PRINTADMIN
</PRE>
<P>gives administrative
rights on the printer queues to all members of the PRINTADMIN group
in the NT domain DOM. These users will be able to configure printers,
install drivers (for different Windows versions) and grant printing
rights to the domain users by means of the standard remote
administrative tools which are present in an NT or Windows 2000 box,
and that use Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). And all this in a
transparent way, without being aware that the printer server is not
really a Windows box, but a Linux one.
<P>
The members of the
DOM+PRINTADMIN group must of course have been granted write access to
the path /etc/samba/printers. This is achieved by establishing the
necessary permissions in the Linux filesystem:
<PRE>
       $ chown -R DOM+PROWNER:DOM+PRINTADMIN /etc/samba/printers
       $ chmod 0775 /etc/samba/printers

</PRE>
<P>Driver installation is an
especially interesting feature. It is possible to install at TOSERFAX
the drivers of a postscript printer for all Windows versions that are
used at the site: 95, NT and 2000. Once this work is done, any client
that connects to the printer queue for the first time will be able to
auto-install the needed drivers. We achieve therefore one of the
goals of the network administrators: no configuration work needed on
the client side.
<P>
Additionally, any member
of the PRINTADMIN group may restrict access to the printer queue, using
the NT access control lists (ACL).
<P>
The only question still
unanswered is how to reach by e-mail the users that want to send a
fax. Thanks to winbindd the user has been authenticated, but, which
is the e-mail account? Lacking a way to read this information from
the Active Directory, maybe using OpenLDAP, the solution is to
manually add to the &quot;aliases&quot; file the list of possible fax
users, with their e-mail addresses
<PRE>
	DOM+User1:	email-1@domain.com
	DOM+User2:	email-2@other-domain.com
</PRE>
<P>and so on. Execute
&quot;newaliases&quot; and the system is ready.

<h2><b>System maintenance</b></h2>

<P>Once
each and every component is configured, the last thing to do is to
automate some basic housekeeping tasks. This is easily fulfilled
adding to /etc/crontab the following lines:
<PRE>
<P>	0 21 * * *     root  test -x /usr/sbin/faxqclean &amp;&amp; /usr/sbin/faxqclean
<P>	25 23 * * *    root  test -e /usr/sbin/faxcron &amp;&amp; sh /usr/sbin/faxcron | mail faxmaster
</PRE>
<P>Beware
though that the HylaFAX package included in SuSE 7.2 leaves faxcron
in /etc/cron.daily. Therefore, you will have to move it to apply the
proposed scheme.

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>

<P>The
combination of HylaFAX, Samba, smbfax and other open-source packages
on a Linux system has allowed to integrate an efficient centralized
fax service in a Windows environment, realizing the expectations of
the IT managers, especially the lack of additional software
installation on the client side.
