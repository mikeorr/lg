I'm trying to install <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A> Netware for Linux on Redhat 5.1.
Following the instructions from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.caldea.com/pub/netware/INSTALL.redhat">ftp://ftp.caldea.com/pub/netware/INSTALL.redhat</A>,
I get to Step 5 under "Downloading the Files."
</STRONG></P>

Well, I haven't played with this yet, since I don't
have any Netware client systems around here.  (Maybe
one of these days I'll fire up one of my old XT's to
use for clients).

<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

When I type in rpm -i kernel-2_0_35-1nw_i386.rpm, I get the
following error:
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
ln: boot/vmlinuz-2.0.35-1nw-streams: No such file or directory
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Can you tell me why? More importantly, can you tell me how to fix it?

Well, the Netware for Linux requires a kernel with
STREAMS and IPX patches built into it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
STREAMS is an alternative to BSD sockets.  It's a
programming model for communications within a Unix or
other kernel --- between the applications interfaces
and the devices.  The Linux kernel core team has soundly
reject suggestions that Linux adopt a STREAMS networking
model for its native internal interfaces and we won't
go into their reasoning here.  (I'm inclined to agree with
them on this issue in any event.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, this error suggests that the 'ln' command (creates
hard and symbolic links) can't find the '<TT>/boot/vmlinuz...</TT>'
files to which it refers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
One trick to try is to view the contents of the rpm
file using 'mc' (Midnight Commander).  Just bring up
'mc', select the RPM file with your cursor keys and
highlight bar, and hit [Enter].  That will treat the
RPM file as a "virtual directory" and allow you to
view and manually extract the contents.  Look in
RPM:/boot for the kernel file --- also look for the
README files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've occasionally manually extracted the files from
an RPM and just put them in place myself.  Then I read
through any scripts that and docs contained therein
to see what <EM>should have been done</EM> by the rpm system.
(Usually this sort of dodge is only necessary when
doing piecemeal upgrades to the rpm package itself).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are other times when I have to resort to
'rpm -i --force --nodeps ...' to get things to work.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that this kernel may not support you hardware
configuration (that's one reason why many Linux users
build custom kernels).  So you may have to find and
install the kernel source patches and build your own
--- or at least build a set of modules that match
that version.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Probably your best bet would be to subscribe to the
caldera-netware mailing list.  Look to Liszt to
help find specific mailing lists and newsgroups:

Shouldn't it be included in <A HREF="http://www.caldera.com/">Caldera</A>'s RPMs then. It seems that the first they
their install does is try to build a new kernel.Also, does the fact that
ncpfs is built in indicate that the STREAMS and IPX patches already exist -
the IPX patches, anyway?&lt;clipped&gt;
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" alt="(!)"

It is.  That's what that kernel is saying.
However it seems that the <TT>/boot</TT> directory isn't there
(my to 'mkdir' that) and, for some reason, your 'rpm'
command isn't or can't make it.  (If you do have a
<TT>/boot</TT> directory --- maybe you've used 'chattr +i' to
make it immutable.  Maybe you have a file named <TT>/boot</TT>
so that a directory can't be made by that name.  Who
knows?).

Midnight Commander won't open the RPMs on my system, but I
executed rpm -qpl kernel-2_0_35-1nw_i386.rpm &gt; dump.txt

/boot/WHATSIN-2.0.35-1nw
/boot/vmlinuz-2.0.35-1nw

The only files with the word stream in the title is

... that would be the STREAMS loadable kernel module.
The other support and IPX patches are compiled into that
kernel, and the FAQ tells you how to build a kernel to match
the shipping one (close enough to load the requisite modules
and route/utilize the IPX protocols anyway).

That tries to "erase" (uninstall) that package --- except
that you have to use the package's name not the package
*file's* name.  kernel-2.0.35-1nw is probably the package
name.  The filename is independent of that, though it
is conventionally similar.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can use the 'rpm -qpi' command to extract information
about the RPM file including the package name.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In general the -i and -p options to 'rpm' refer to
<EM>file</EM> while others refer to "packages."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you issued the command 'rpm -ql foo-1.2.3-bang'
RPM would list all of the files that are "owned by" the
foo-1.2.3-bang package.  If you issue the command
'rpm -qpl foo-1.2.3-bang.i386.rpm' then the command would
list all of the file in that package <EM>file</EM>.  If (by some
chance) you had a different implementation of the same
package these two lists might differ.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(That's a minor problem with the RPM system --- there's no
central naming authority on package naming and versioning so
you can have differences between, for example, the
<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">S.u.S.E.</A> and <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> packages, with some differences in
dependencies --- etc.  Actually it's a rather major pain in
the patootie when you're a S.u.S.E. user and you keep
getting packages that are contributed to the Red Hat site.
However, it's still usually easier than building them from
tarballs and the "right" answer for me is probably for me to
learn enough about <EM>building</EM> my own RPM's that I can grap
the source RPM packages and modify them to fit.  The "right"
answer for Red Hat and S.u.S.E. and Caldera is to make their
packages as compatable with one another as possible ---
particularly with regards to dependences and provision
identification).

That sounds wrong.  Are you sure you typed exactly that?

I don't know rpm (or Linux) well enough to trust not hosing my
kernel. I guess it's not that big of deal. I can just re-install
RH5.1 from scratch.

After awhile building and installing new kernels will seem
as routine and editing an old DOS CONFIG.SYS file (though
you probably won't do anywhere near as often.

I'd manually extract the kernel file from that RPM
file, put it in the <TT>/boot/</TT> directory, edit your
<TT>/etc/lilo.conf</TT> file, run the <TT>/sbin/lilo</TT> command and
try to reboot.  Search through the old back issues
of LG to read many messages about how LILO works --
or just read the HOWTO at:

(... and other LDP mirrors all over).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Naturally you'll want to leave an entry for your existing
(working) kernel so that you can reboot into that if this
Caldera supplied kernel is inappropriate for your system.
You'll also want to prepare a boot/root (rescue) diskette.
Although one (image) comes with each Red Hat distribution
I personally prefer Tom Oehser's "rtbt" (a full mini
distribution on a single floppy --- with a suite of Unix
tools sufficient to do most networking and rescue
operations).  You can find that at:
