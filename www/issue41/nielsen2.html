Hello! This is a brief article about how to setup Diald on a RedHat 5.2 
system. Yes, I know RedHat 6.0 is out, but this will be for a RedHat 5.2
system anyways. I wasn't able to test it on a RedHat 6.0 system in time.  
<p>
What is Diald? It is program that runs in the background of your Linux 
system which will connect you to the internet through a modem anytime you try
to get something from the internet. Thus, instead of manually dialing to get
connected to the internet, all you have to do is type a url into your
web browser, and if you are not already connected, it will attempt to connect 
for you. It also has the capability of disconnecting you after a period
of inactivity with the internet. 
<p>
Here are some more resources to help you.

Diald homepage</a>
<li><a href="http://www.tcu-inc.com/support/QuickNet.html"> Mark's setup</a> for QuickNet customers. 
<a href="http://www.qn.net">QuickNet</a> is a local ISP in Columbus, Ohio which
supports Linux.  
<li><a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/">FTP
site where diald is located</a>
<li><a href="http://www.tcu-inc.com/mark/articles/diald/">
My copy of the diald rpms.</a> I don't remember where I got
them from. 
</ol>

<hr>
This article is going to briefly tell you how to setup diald easily with RedHat 5.2.  

<ol>
<li> First, download the 
<a href="http://www.tcu-inc.com/mark/articles/diald/">
RPMS</a> or from 
<a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/network/serial/">
sunsite the tar files</a>.
I usually use the rpms. 
<li> Install the two rpms
<br> rpm -Uhv diald*.rpm
<li> Next, use my configuration of <a href="#diald.conf">/etc/diald/diald.conf</a>
</ol>
After you have downloaded the rpms, installed them, and replaced the
diald.conf file, you need to do three things, edit diald.conf, activate
the diald service, and make sure you have added ppp0 to the RedHat control 
panel. 

<ol><li>
Replace MY_USERNAME_FOR_MODEM with the username you are connecting to your
ISP. I am not sure if you actually need to do this, but it works for me. 
</li>
<li>Okay, now add a "ppp0" interface (modem interface) to your computer. 
This can get lengthy. Here is 
<a href="http://www.tcu-inc.com/support/QuickNet.html">
TCU's article about setting up 
ppp0</a> for <a href="http://www.qn.net">QuickNet</a> users. If you are
unable to get to that article, look at 
<a href="#brief">my brief notes about how to setup</a> a
ppp0 connection using RedHat's Control Panel.  
<li> Next, you need to activate diald. The easiest way to do this is
<br> /etc/rc.d/init.d/diald start
<p>Or if you want to have it activated when your computer starts, 
<br>chkconfig --add diald
</ol>

DONE!

To setup your modem to com1 or com2
<OL>
<LI>
# For com1</LI>

<LI>
rm /dev/modem</LI>

<LI>
ln -s /dev/cua0 /dev/modem</LI>

<LI>
# For com2</LI>

<LI>
rm /dev/modem</LI>

<LI>
ln -s /dev/cua1 /dev/modem</LI>
</OL>
<p>

<P><BR>Here are the steps I did to get ppp setup. I did this as root.
 First, log in as root
and start xwindows. The command to start Xwindows is "startx".
<OL>
<LI>
The control panel should be there, choose network configuration.
If it is not there, type this command in the xterm prompt to start
the control-panel "control-panel". 
</LI>

<LI>
In this program, choose "Interfaces".</LI>

<LI>
Click on "Add".</LI>

<LI>
Choose "ppp".</LI>

<LI>
Enter in the phone number, username, and password.</LI>

<LI>
Click on "Use pap authentication".</LI>

<LI>
Click on "done".</LI>

<LI>
Click on "save".</LI>

<li> Now we need to set your DNS up correctly. Click on "Names" in the top
menu of the Network Configurator. You should see "Nameservers" there.
<li> Enter "127.0.0.1" as one of the entries unless you have the number
which should have been given to you by your ISP. 127.0.0.1 is a bad choice
and should only be used as a last resource. Also, if you enter 127.0.0.1,
you must have your DNS server installed locally and running in order for
it to work. It is highly recommended to put in a nameserver number which
your isp should have. 
<li> Click on "Save". 
<li> Click on "Interfaces" in the top menu. 

<LI>
Now click on "Activate" for the ppp option you just made.</LI>
</OL>
To activate and deactivate the modem as root, again, in the control-panel,
choose "Network Configurations", then choose "Interfaces", select "ppp0",
then click on "Activate" or "Deactivate" or turn the modem off and on.
