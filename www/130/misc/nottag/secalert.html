&gt; &gt;  Dear Customer,
&gt; &gt;  Our Technical Service department has recently updated our online banking
&gt; &gt;  software,
</pre>
<p><strong>[clarjon1]</strong> 
by outsourcing all site to a cheap webhosting so hackers can't find
it, at least, that's what they told us,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Well done.  You sent that reply back to whomever sent that phishing email
initially.</p>
<p><strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Um... no. 'halifax.co.uk' is a geniune site, the link 'hidden' in the
'Click here' part goes to
<a class="reference" href="http://jefferson.noc11.net/~tennyson/mail/FormsLogin.aspsource=halifax.co.uk/">http://jefferson.noc11.net/~tennyson/mail/FormsLogin.aspsource=halifax.co.uk/</a></p>
<p><strong>[Thomas]</strong>
Not the <em>best</em> thing to do, really.</p>
<p><strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
No, it's not.</p>
<p><strong>[clarjon1]</strong>
Agreed.  I forgot to check who Gmail was sending it to...</p>
<p>Ah, well.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; &gt; and due to this upgrade we kindly ask you to follow the

<p>so we can make sure that you won't abuse your money by taking it for ourselves.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt; &gt; Failure to
&gt; &gt;  confirm the online banking details will

<p>make us sad, so we will hack the real server and</p>

&gt; &gt; suspend you from accessing your
&gt; &gt;  account online.
</pre>
<p>Well, not really, we're just hoping that it will scare you into doing
so.  By the way, PLEASE don't look at the status bar when you put your
mouse over it!</p>

They didn't do quite a good job of passing the &quot;Reading The Address In

another scam.  heh.  Well, rest assured, I'm sending a message to the
