<p>
Hello all. I'm running Redhat Enterprise Linux version 3.0 with an
active RHN subscription.
</p>

<p>
Linux 2.4.21-47.EL #1 SMP Wed Jul 5 20:30:36 EDT 2006 x86_64 x86_64
x86_64 GNU/Linux
</p>

<p>
I want to upgrade to version 5.0. I?m a bit anxious though. I only have
a few users, but have spent a lot of time getting everything running
well on my box. My question: If I install Red Hat Enterprise V5 using
the upgrade option via the anaconda installer, will I loose any of my
data or applications? I know that doing a clean wipe and reinstall is
the BEST solution, but if possible I would like to upgrade.
</p>

<p>
Here is what I'm specifically concerned about loosing:
Apache, MySql, PHP, Qmail, Vpopmail, and various other small
applications (Webalizer, etc?). All of the above have been compiled from
source. I'm also concerned about stuff in /usr /usr/home /etc and /var
being overwritten.
</p>

<p>
I hope my questions aren't too silly. I'm a novice with basic
administration experience. My server is not a mission critical
commercial machine. Small variances caused by the upgrade would be
easily tolerated.
</p>

<p>
Thanks in advance for any info you may have.
</p>

<p>
Kind regards,
</p>

Actually, it's not the best solution at all.  In doing that you will
invariably wipe out all manner of settings -- some of which you might
not have realised to backup at all (hint:  some application use /var as
a dumping ground which tends to trick a number of people when they
backup their configurations in an attempt to do a window-esque style of
""upgrading""; wholly wrong, IMO).
</p>

<p>
Upgrading will replace binaries in /usr, yes.  That's a premise you
except when you upgrade, of course.  If you have custom binaries you
yourself have compiled from source which install to /usr then you might
be able to tell your package manager (rpm in this case) not to touch
certain files -- you certainly can with apt under Debian for instance,
but it's been some time since I last an RPM system with any great
vigour.

<p>
Well, as I mentioned above, stuff in /usr and /var will get overwritten.
Full-stop.  This is why you upgrade, after all.  The best solution I can
offer you is to backup the configuration files for all of the programs
you've listed above, reinstall the compiled applications from source,
and just have done with it.
</p>

<p>
This ought not to be much of an option though, assuming the compiled
applications you yourself have installed haven't overwritten files which
you might have previously installed via rpm.  I.e., if you have apache
installed then it will overwrite your custom package, and likewise, if
any of the dependencies in the upgrade cause apache to be installed
that too will overwrite your files.
</p>

<p>
This is where the advantage of installing to /usr/local (typically the
default with PREFIX= or --prefix= depending on whether you use make
or./configure respectively) comes in handy.  It's policy for packages
not to install files there.  You may of course already meant /usr/local
for your compiled applications; it's non-obvious from your
descriptions, so I am taking you verbatim.
</p>

<p>
Oh, and as a parting comment, one of the reasons why people split /usr
and /home onto separate partitions is also to make things like
upgrading work easier -- i.e., not mounting /home is often beneficial
so that nothing really can be deleted or overwritten, etc.  (A poor
example in this case, but the essence of it applies.)

<p>
Thomas,
</p>

<p>
Thanks for  the advice. I figured as much. I think I'm gonna just stick
with v3 for now since Red Hat is gonna support it for a few more years,
although I cant seem to it's end-of-life date.
</p>

<p>
Thanks again,
</p>

<p>
I agree with Thomas concerning the reinstall of the whole system. It's
not automatically the best solution. Another way is to move the system
to a different place where you can safely try the upgrade. You could
backup everything and recover it onto different hardware (a spare PC or
something like that) or into a virtualisation environment (be it VMware,
Xen, whatever you like best). By doing this you gain
</p>

<pre>
 - an additional backup of your installation with all the data
 - experience in recovering a system from backups
 - and a testing environment where you can safely check what the
   Anaconda installer will do when upgrading.
</pre>
 From my experience I'd say that you have to check all important services
after the upgrade and possibly recompile some applications due to the
upgraded system libraries. The distributions usually leave things in
/usr/local alone, so they should be safe. However the word "should"
isn't something you should rely on.
