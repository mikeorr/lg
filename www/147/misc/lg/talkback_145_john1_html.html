The US Distributor of this product appears to be Hightech Global (
<a href="http://www.hitechglobal.com/Boards/Armadillo9.htm">http://www.hitechglobal.com/Boards/Armadillo9.htm</a>), who is selling it for
$645.  In my humble opinion, that price is substantially too high.  For
comparison, the apparently much more powerful, physically much smaller
Gumstix Verdex XL6P (
<a href="http://gumstix.com/store/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=27&amp;products_id=178">http://gumstix.com/store/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=27&amp;products_id=178</a>)
costs $169, plus perhaps another $100 for various expansion boards--you'd
want at least the $24 VX Breakout board, which has the host USB port on it.
(I'm not affiliated in any way with Gumstix, nor have I ever purchased any
of their products.  I'm thinking seriously about it, though.)

Just thought folks should know.

<p>
The picture of the standard setup is missing.

<p>
That's right; it's the <em>standard</em> setup, so everybody can just look at
their own and see it. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Darn it, I'd already fixed that one... or I thought I did, at the same
time as I'd fixed the misspelling in Russell King's name (he was
extremely huffy in pointing it out, insisting that it was an insult and
a sign of "not caring about the person in question" [laugh]). In any
case, it's fixed now - thanks!
