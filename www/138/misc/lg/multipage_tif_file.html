Hi gang - 
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to figure out how to view a multipage tif. It's something
that Wind0ws handles just fine, but I don't have the right tools to do
it here on my Debian system.
</p>

<p>
When I try to view it in Gimp, it comes out <strong>very</strong> distorted, and pretty
much illegible. (It's Japanese, so every pixel counts.)
</p>

<p>
Thanks,
<pre>--

<p>
Try "tiff2pdf". It is part of the "libtiff-tools" package on Debian.
</p>

<p>
According to the manpage:
<pre>
	The  program converts one TIFF file to one PDF file,
	including multiple page TIFF files, tiled TIFF files, black
	and white. grayscale, and color TIFF files that contain
	data of TIFF photometric interpretations of bilevel,
	grayscale, RGB, YCbCr, CMYK separation, and ICC L*a*b* as
	supported by libtiff and PDF.
</pre>
Of course, if you need to edit the TIFF file then this is not very
useful. 
</p>

<p>
Note that one reason for the distortion in gimp may be due to zooming
out. Try to go to zoom level 1 (the key "1" should do it) and see if
gimp views it better.
</p>

<p>
Hope this helps,
</p>

<p>
Kapil.
P.S. Since you helped me out with Japanese, I feel good helping you
out with Japanese!

Tried it, results copied below:

<p>
<strong>nod</strong> Read the man page, it looked hopeful, but...
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Of course, if you need to edit the TIFF file then this is not very

<p>
Thankfully I just need to read the file.

&gt; out. Try to go to zoom level 1 (the key "1" should do it) and see if

<p>
The original is a fax, and the quality is bad, but I do have to zoom in
to read it, anyway. changing zoom levels doesn't appear to change the
distortion. For now, I can read the file by going through the layers
dialog in Gimp, but it's frustrating knowing that Wind0ws handles this
beautifully, and this machine doesn't.
</p>


<pre>
&gt; Hope this helps,

<p>
Alas, what I'm getting is: 
<pre>
kat@Fenrir:~$ tiff2pdf -p letter -j -f -o output.pdf 1953.tif
TIFFOpen: 1953.tif: Cannot open.
tiff2pdf: Can't open input file 1953.tif for reading.
</pre>
Feh. I have the impression that it's a stupid quirk from whatever
software was used to originally generate the image.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think Gimp generally says this about tiff
files:

KDE has KFax.  I stopped looking for other solutions after
I found this little app.

I tend to use display (part of the ImageMagick package IIRC).

<p>
Another viewer I occasionally use is gqview, but I don't think that handles 
multipage TIFF well.

<p>
Well, a combination of everyone's advice did the trick.
</p>

<p>
That, and maybe installing Ubuntu Edgy Eft, as well.
</p>


<p>
I installed efax, and then imagemagick.
</p>

<p>
After that, running 'convert' (a part of imagemagick) on the .tif
''
convert 1897.tif 1897.jpg
''
took three minutes (!) but resulted in success - 20+ jpg images pulled
out of the file, neatly named for me. The images are still distorted,
but they looked that way when I looked at it in gimp (as a multi-layer
document).
</p>


<p>
Thanks, everyone.
