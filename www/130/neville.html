<h1>DNS techniques</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/neville.html">Ed Neville</A></b></p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This guide shall show how to setup djbdns for a SOHO
environment.</p>

<p>Named/BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon) is a popular DNS
(Domain Name System) server, but perhaps it has had a few general
problems.</p>

<p>With a default installation of 'named', you leave yourself open
to proxy for anyone on the Internet to make DNS queries through
your open system, which is a caching nameserver on all
interfaces.<a name="1_back"></a><a href="#1">[1]</a> I have found of late that DJB's DNS suite of tools to
be of great efficiency and use.</p>

<p>Despite its merits, there is one major drawback: you cannot
run a DNS server and a DNS cache in the same instance on the same
interface. Some might see this to be both confusing and
irritating; I see this as security. I run a typical SOHO setup: I
have a handful of domain names and a handful of computers on the
LAN. This is how I run things here, and that is the basis for
this article.</p>

<p>To illustrate the network layout:</p>

<p><img src="misc/neville/dns.png" name="Graphic1" alt="Net diagram"
width="501" height="182" border="1"></p>

<p>
In this example, you need to decide whether to put the DNS server in your
LAN or if you have it at the firewall. DNS lookups (should) create little load
on your network, so it's not necessary to set up a dedicated box. If you do
choose to set up a dedicated box, then it will probably sit idle for most
of the time, in which case you might want to make it double up as a backup
server; therefore, you should not be short of disk space, here.</p>

<p>In my example, the Internet cloud is attached to a 35.45.55.65
IP address, and the LAN clients are on a 192.168.0.0-255 network
(otherwise known as a 192.168.0.0/24 RFC 1918 private
network).</p>

<p>The plan here is to set up 'tinydns' to serve our UDP DNS
lookups, 'dnscache' to serve the LAN with a DNS cache's lookups, and a
private 'tinydns' server to respond with NXDOMAIN <a name="2_back"></a><a href="#2">[2]</a> on lookups from 
which potentially bad Internet traffic might result.</p>

<h3>Getting Required Parts</h3>

<p>One of the instant hurdles for anyone who has not done source
installations is that the entire suite of programs DJB
provides is in source code. The code is very well written, and
compiles just fine on most systems, but his licence does not
permit his software to be redistributed if altered. Because of
this, most distributions cannot provide binary packages.</p>

<p>There are three main parts to getting up and running with
DJB's DNS packages:</p>

<h3>daemontools</h3>

<p><a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.76.tar.gz">http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.76.tar.gz</a>
provides a suite of programs for managing system services. The
bulk of the suite is supervisory programs, which consist of a super
service and monitoring utilities. This is what will keep the DNS
services running: even in the event of a program crash, the super
service will restart things for us.</p>

<h3>ucspi-tcp</h3>

<p>'ucspi' provides TCP server and client programs that allow
callers to talk TCP through stdin/stdout-like read/writes. This
cuts out a large security risk that the callers would otherwise
have to code against (such as some basic buffer overflows).</p>

<h3>djbdns</h3>

<p><a href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/djbdns-1.05.tar.gz">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/djbdns-1.05.tar.gz</a>
is the suite of DNS programs and libraries that provide the DNS information
to queries.</p>

<p><a name="g" id="g"></a>We'll put daemontools
in the /package directory, the super service directory will be /service, 
ucspi tools will go into /usr/local, and the DNS programs will have their
configuration in /etc.</p>

<p class="editorial">[ The locations of the two directories suggested
above, '/service' and '/package', are not compliant with either FSSTND or
FHS standards, as far as I'm aware; placing these subdirectories somewhere
other than the root directory (e.g., "/opt" is reserved for this purpose
under the FHS) may be advisable. -- Ben ]</p>

<h3>Installing Daemontools</h3>

<p>Following the basic setup directions from DJB's pages:</p>

<pre class="code">
mkdir -p /package
chmod 1755 /package
cd /package
wget http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.76.tar.gz
tar zxpf daemontools-0.76.tar.gz
cd admin/daemontools-0.76
</pre>

<p>The compilation and installation is taken care of via a single
command, <code>package/install</code>.</p>

<p>We should now have supervise running from /etc/inittab, if
not, run 'svscan &amp;' manually.</p>

<h3>Installing ucspi-tcp</h3>

<p>As with daemon-tools, we shall follow the DJB notes for
installation.</p>

<pre class="code">
cd ~
wget http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz
tar zxpf ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz
cd ucspi-tcp-0.88
</pre>

<p>Compile the ucspi-tcp programs by typing 'make';
As root, install the ucspi-tcp programs under '/usr/local'
with 'make setup check'.


<h3>djbdns</h3>

<pre class="code">
cd ~
wget http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/djbdns-1.05.tar.gz
tar zxpf djbdns-1.05.tar.gz
cd djbdns-1.05
echo gcc -O2 -include /usr/include/errno.h &gt; conf-cc
make
</pre>

<p>There is a slight bug with compiling, after some recent changes
with <code>glibc</code>; hence, the fifth line in the above code block
replaces the original compilation options. Once this is complete, we can
get on with configuring the system.
</p>

<h3>Configuring the DNS Cache</h3>

<p>We need to create a new user account for 'dnscache', so it can run as
that user, since running services as root invites a host of security
problems. The same reasoning applies for setting up the groups.</p>

<pre class="code">
groupadd dnscache
groupadd dnslog
useradd -g dnscache dnscache
useradd -g dnslog dnslog
</pre>

<p>Now, let's set up the cache directory:</p>

<pre>
dnscache-conf dnscache dnslog /etc/dnscache
</pre>

<p>Choose an IP for the DNS cache to listen on, and write it into
"/etc/dnscache/env/IP". In my case, I have the private IP address
192.168.0.1 on my firewall's LAN interface, so I place this IP address
here:</p>

<pre>
echo 192.168.0.1 &gt; /etc/dnscache/env/IP
</pre>

<p>Next, we'll add a setting to tell 'dnscache' which source IP
addresses to service; we do this by 'touch'ing the IP
ranges in /etc/dnscache/root/ip/:</p>
<pre>
touch /etc/dnscache/root/ip/192.168.0
</pre>

<p>The next step would be to link this directory into the
super-service directory, but we shall get to that in a
moment.</p>


<h3>Configuring the DNS Server</h3>

<p>The DNS server and DNS cache cannot operate on the same interface using
the same protocol. BIND <em>can</em> do this; however, this is not desirable
default behavior. BIND suffered for a long time from being exploited
by people who shifted the lookup work onto third-party daemons.</p>

<p>'tinydns', in my example above, is set to operate on 35.45.55.65,
serving the contents of my DNS datafile only. If the answer that
the client wants is not in the datafile, then the lookup fails.</p>

<pre>
groupadd tinydns
useradd -g tinydns tinydns
tinydns-conf tinydns dnslog /etc/tinydns 35.45.55.65
</pre>

<p>We should now have a tinydns directory in /etc/tinydns. Let's
make sure it's set to listen on the correct IP address by
inspecting the contents of "/etc/tinydns/env/IP", which should hold
your desired DNS-serving IP address. In my case, this is
35.45.55.65.</p>


<h3>data.cdb</h3>

<p> 'tinydns' uses a hash database lookup file. This makes query
lookups extremely fast and efficient. The hash file is stored in
CDB format. This file can be transported to any architecture and
it will remain compatible; this makes DNS clusters very easy to
maintain.</p>

<p>In /etc/tinydns/root/, there is a data file and a Makefile. When the
Makefile is run, the file 'data.cdb' is created.  DNS zones contain (among
other items) A(+), MX(@), NS(&amp;), Zones(Z), and Cnames(C).</p>

<h4>A Records</h4>

<p>Let's take a look at the simplest, the A record:</p>

<pre class="code">
+example.com:35.45.55.65:86400
</pre>

<p>Above, we set the A record of the host example.com to the IP
address 35.45.55.65 with a TTL (Time To Live) of one day in
seconds.</p>

<h4>CNAME Records</h4>

<p>CNAME records are similar; they are pointers to an address
record. The problem with address records is that, when the IP
address changes, often the DNS administrator has to re-jig many
address records, often at the same time as the IP address is
altered. CNAMEs are a way to reference A records. The only
problem with a CNAME is that it causes two lookups rather than
just the one lookup; this obviously affects you if bandwidth and
time is short. <a name="3_back"></a><a href="#3">[3]</a></p>

<pre class="code">
Cwww.example.com:example.com.:60
</pre>

<p>The above shows the hostname www.example.com points to
example.com with a TTL of 1 minute. Please note the trailing '.' at
the end of the host target.</p>

<h4>Mailer Records</h4>

<p>MX records differ slightly from CNAME ones because they must
also contain the mailer preference.</p>

<pre class="code">
@example.com::mail.example.com.:10:86400
</pre>

<p>Here we see that the MX, for example, points to the A record of
example.com with a preference of 10. Please note the trailing '.'
after the address target. Also note that it is often a bad idea
to specify a CNAME as the mailer target. Putting a CNAME here
does not gain you anything, other than having three lookups rather
than two each time an MX lookup is performed. <a name="4_back"></a><a href="#4">[4]</a></p>

<h4>Nameserver Records</h4>

<p>When organising DNS for your domain, it is important that the
Name Server (NS) records at your domain's DNS server match the
root's NS list.</p>

<pre class="code">
&amp;example.com::ns0.example.com.:86400
</pre>

<p>Above, we specify that the NS for example.com is the address
record ns0.example.com. Please note the trailing '.'!</p>

<h4>Zone Records</h4>

<p>The zone record also contains information other than records; mainly, this
provides zone update details. Here, one must specify the SOA (start of
authority), which in most cases is your primary nameserver, so secondary
name servers know where to find updated information.</p>

<pre class="code">
Zexample.com:ns0.example.com.:hostmaster.example.com.:2005090312:7200:7200:2419200:604800
</pre>

<p>The above states that the zone name is example.com, with the
primary name server of ns0.example.com. The hostmaster email
address is hostmaster@example.com. The first '.' is assumed as an
@.</p>

<p>We use the date in 'YYYYMMDDHH' format as the serial number for the zone
<a name="5_back"></a><a href="#5">[5]</a>. These values are
specified in seconds and are (in order from left to right):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>refresh</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>retry</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>expire</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>minimum refresh</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We now have a basic setup. The full zone layout is as
follows:</p>

<pre class="code">
Zexample.com:ns0.example.com.:hostmaster.example.com.:2005090312:7200:7200:2419200:604800
&amp;example.com::ns0.example.com.:86400
@example.com::mail.example.com.:10:86400
Cwww.example.com:example.com.:60
+example.com:35.45.55.65:86400
+mail.example.com:35.45.55.65:86400
+ns0.example.com:35.45.55.65:86400
</pre>

<p>Once you have written your zonefile, you should run the make
program to build this into the 'data.cdb', as mentioned above.</p>

<p>For full documentation on the format of the datafile, you might want to
visit <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns-data.html">http://cr.yp.to/djbdns/tinydns-data.html</a>.</p>


<h3>Starting the Services</h3>

<p>Once happy with the configuration, we can start the services by
linking them both to the /service directory. To do this, just
issue the following two commands:</p>

<pre>
ln -s /etc/tinydns /service
ln -s /etc/dnscache /service
</pre>

<p>Wait for a few seconds, then issue 'ps -aux'; you should see
output similar to the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
root      2241  0.0  0.0  1276   256 ?        S    Jul27   0:00 supervise dnscache
root      2250  0.0  0.0  1276   256 ?        S    Jul27   0:00 supervise tinydns
dnscache  2252  0.0  0.1  2860  1588 ?        S    Jul27   7:02 /usr/local/bin/dnscache
dnslog    2254  0.0  0.1  1416   328 ?        S    Jul27   0:42 multilog t ./main
tinydns   2265  0.0  0.0  1532   320 ?        S    Jul27   0:31 /usr/local/bin/tinydns
dnslog    2272  0.0  0.0  1416   328 ?        S    Jul27   0:10 multilog t ./main
</pre>

<p>If you do not see the above, then it might be that your
'supervise' program is not running. You should ensure that your
'/etc/inittab' file contains this line:</p>

<pre>
SV:123456:respawn:/services/svscanboot
</pre>

<p>Then, send init a HUP signal:</p>
<pre>
kill -HUP 1
</pre>

<p>Then, check that 'supervise' actually starts. If not, there will
be a message about the failure against the 'readproctile' process
in your 'ps' output.</p>

<h3>Logging</h3>

<p>It is now important to check the status of the processes
that are running; we can do this through the multilog output, which is
located in '/etc/tinydns/log/main/current' and
'/etc/dnscache/log/main/current'. </p>

<p>The best way to watch these files is with the following
command (from the log directory):</p>
<pre>
tail -F current
</pre>

<p>As these files can be rotated frequently, using the '-F' parameter will
cause the 'tail' program to watch for file changes and reposition the file
pointer at the beginning of the file at log rotation time.</p>

<p>We should see the following output (for tinydns):</p>

<pre>
@4000000044e38ce704a37e0c starting tinydns
</pre>

<p>and the following for dnscache:</p>
<pre>
@4000000044e38d0f165dc2ec starting
</pre>

<p>If you see errors, then you might have to go through the above
installation instructions, checking that everything has been followed
correctly. If you see output, then this is even better, since it means your
programs are working (one hopes) as expected.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>To test that the DNS cache is operating correctly, you can type
the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
nslookup &ndash; 192.168.0.1
set q=mx
yahoo.com
</pre>

<p>The line 'set q=mx' tells nslookup to make MX queries, which
will return Yahoo's mail servers:</p>

<pre>
yahoo.com mail exchanger = 1 mx2.mail.yahoo.com.
yahoo.com mail exchanger = 1 mx3.mail.yahoo.com.
yahoo.com mail exchanger = 5 mx4.mail.yahoo.com.
yahoo.com mail exchanger = 1 mx1.mail.yahoo.com.
</pre>

<p>To test that the the DNS server is running correctly, we can do
the following:</p>

<pre class="code">
nslookup &ndash; 35.45.55.65
set q=mx
example.com
</pre>

<p>There are other tools you might like to use for DNS
debugging, named 'host' and 'dig': these are very powerful and are
great fun for scripting.<a name="5_back"></a><a href="#5">[5]</a> If you happen to know how to program in
Perl, you might like to get the Perl module Net::DNS, which
provides a wealth of DNS lookup functions.</p>

<h3>DNS Poisoning</h3>

<p>DNS poisoning is the method in which we taint results to suit
the query. For example, if you were to discover an Internet shock
site, you could prevent lookups of this site by telling the DNS
cache to use a given DNS server for all these queries. The DNS
server in this case would be set to respond with NXDOMAIN for
every lookup; thus we can send any query we like there and we
know it is always going to give the same result, NXDOMAIN. This
is the ideal result, as the lookup does not wait around for a
timeout.</p>

<p>In the /etc/dnscache/root/servers/ directory, you can place the
IP address of the poisoned server in the file matching the domain
name you want poisoned. For example, inside /etc/dnscache/root/servers/doubleclick.net,
I have 127.0.0.7.</p>

<h3>Setting up the Forge Server</h3>

<p>We're going to repeat the setup above for the 'tinydns' server,
but with the small exception of the datafile and its installation
location.</p>

<pre class="code">
tinydns-conf tinydns dnslog /etc/tinyforge
cd /etc/tinyforge/root
echo '.:' &gt; data
</pre>

<p>This line in the data file affects all lookups.</p>

<pre class="code">
make
echo '127.0.0.7' &gt; /etc/tinyforge/env/IP
</pre>

<p>The above line tells 'tinyforge' which IP address to listen
on.</p>

<p>We must setup a local interface for tinyforge to bind to:</p>

<pre>
ifconfig lo:1 127.0.0.7
</pre>

<p>(You will need to add this to your system configuration.)</p>

<pre>
ln -s /etc/tinyforge /service
</pre>

<p>And now, we start the service by linking it in the /service
directory; you might want to repeat the testing above, to verify
that lookups are correctly returning NXDOMAIN.</p>

<p>When you execute 'svc -h /service/dnscache', the servers
directory will be reloaded, and specified domains will be
forwarded to the DNS forge server.</p>

<h3>Further Setup</h3>

<p>There is a project at
<a href="http://www.bleedingsnort.com/blackhole-dns/files/">http://www.bleedingsnort.com/blackhole-dns/files/</a> where a list of
inappropriate sites is maintained. This can be easily scripted
into a directory of DNS servers. The script is not included here,
as the file layout is subject to change.</p>

<p>If you're like me, you will want statistics of which domains
are looked up on your tinydns server most frequently: You can get
this information quite easily from '/etc/tinydns/log/main/'. I
suggest reading this periodically via a Perl script and feeding
the information into a normalised MySQL database.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>There are many advantages to having all the DNS settings in a
single file. In my case, this single file is generated from a
database, which I shall not go into here, but this allows friends
or customers to make changes via a Web interface.</p>

<p>With BIND, the zones are stored in single files. If you were to have a
huge number of files in a single directory, the OS would have to open the
directory at reload time for processing. This could take some time if you
had a large number of zone files.<a name="7_back"></a><a href="#7">[7]</a> This might seem trivial, perhaps, but,
if your business is to provide DNS, you might want to schedule your reloads
rather than allow customers to queue up reloads.</p>

<p>The single data hash file is very effective. During the make
process, the datafile is named 'data.cdb.tmp' until the build is
complete, then renamed to 'data.cdb'. This allows datafile
creation without interruption to the running tinydns server.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="1"></a><a href="#1_back">[1]</a> Rick Moen adds:  The point is valuable and well taken.  If using
BIND9, Rob Thomas's <a
href="http://www.cymru.com/Documents/secure-bind-template.html">"Secure
BIND Template"</a> is a far better starting point than the normal BIND9
configuration, and among many other improvements use the "view"
partitioning scheme to limit recursive-DNS accees to specified
more-trusted-network IPs, only.</p>

<p><a name="2"></a><a href="#2_back">[2]</a> RM: This DNS return-value string is short for "no such
domain".</p>

<p><a name="3"></a><a href="#3_back">[3]</a> RM:  There's one other very serious problem with CNAMEs:  They may not 
be used to define a hostname that is also used for an NS, MX, or any other
DNS record (see:  RFC1912 2.4 and RFC2181 10.3).</p>

<p>New DNS admins almost always vastly overuse CNAMEs:  The reason
appears to be lack of awareness of the performance hit from that second
lookup and of the RFC restrictions, combined with uncertainty about
whether multiple "A" records pointing to a single IP are OK.  The latter
is almost always, in fact, the right solution, except where pointing to
an out-of-domain FQDN (fully-qualified domain name). Yes, CNAMEs are
faster to re-point when/if IPs change, but that's what search and replace
is for.</p>

<p><a name="4"></a><a href="#4_back">[4]</a> RM: Because of the RFC's prohibition of same, they may also get
your domain's outbound mail refused.</p>

<p><a name="5"></a><a href="#5_back">[5]</a> RM: If working on zonefiles with other system administrators, you
will find that S/Ns of the form YYYYMMDDnn (where nn starts at "00") 
predominate, and are nearly an industry standard -- permitting as they do
99 zonefile changes per day.  In any event, never put yourself in a
situation where you'll wish to edit to a numerically lower S/N, as 
troublesome footwork is required if it's ever necessary to propagate 
such a change to secondaries that normally act only on S/N
increases.</p>

<p><a name="6"></a><a href="#6_back">[6]</a> RM: In fact, use of the venerable if somewhat dotty 'nslookup' tool
is now deprecated is favour of 'dig' and 'host'. There are a number of
reasons for this, and they are comprehensively (if with a certain savage
joy) catalogued by knowledgeable djbdns fancier Jonathan deBoyne Pollard, here:
<a href="http://homepages.tesco.net/J.deBoynePollard/FGA/nslookup-flaws.html">http://homepages.tesco.net/J.deBoynePollard/FGA/nslookup-flaws.html</a>
Fortunately, 'dig' and 'host' are really good tools, and you'll be glad
(eventually) to have rid yourself of the nslookup habit.</p>  

<p><a name="7"></a><a href="#7_back">[7]</a> RM: Someone using BIND9 for primary nameservice on 5,000 zones would 
actually probably use the BIND DLZ (BIND Dynamically Loadable Zones,
<a href="http://bind-dlz.sourceforge.net/">http://bind-dlz.sourceforge.net/</a> variant, or the "LDAP sdb" patch
(<a href="http://www.venaas.no/ldap/bind-sdb/">http://www.venaas.no/ldap/bind-sdb/</a>) against BIND9, both of which back-end BIND9 into
a SQL database instead of its default flatfile storage.  However, large sites might 
prefer specialised and higher-performance
primary-nameserver packages such as NSD (<a href="http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/nsd/">http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/nsd/</a>), 
MyDNS (<a href="http://mydns.bboy.net/">http://mydns.bboy.net/</a>), or PowerDNS
(<a href="http://www.powerdns.com/products/powerdns/">http://www.powerdns.com/products/powerdns/</a>) -- all likewise open source.</p>
