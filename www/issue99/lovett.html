<h1>XMLTV</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/lovett.html">Bill Lovett</A></b></p>

<p>
<p>Where do you go to find out what's on TV? The usual suspects might include
a newspaper, a recent issue of <i>TV Guide</i> magazine, a favorite Web site, or your nearest
TiVo, ReplayTV, or other PVR. But don't forget to add Linux to the top of that
list. You can let the machine do the dirty work and bring the listings to you. XMLTV, a
short bash script, and a cron job are all you need to get started.</p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>First things first: getting the program installed. XMLTV is a suite of Perl
scripts and can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/">membled.com/work/apps/xmltv</a>.
There are releases for Unix-like and Windows environments, but, for obvious reasons,
we'll focus on the former. If you're installing from source, it's the usual
routine:</p>

<pre>
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make test
% make install 
</pre>

<p>If you're on Debian, it's all just an apt-get away
(<code>apt-cache search xmltv</code>). Links to packages for OS X, Red Hat 8, and Red Hat 9 are 
available from the project's homepage.</p>  

<h2>Configuration</h2> <p>Before XMLTV can be useful, it needs to know where in
the world you are. XMLTV is international&#151; it can fetch TV listings for
Canada and the United States, the United Kingdom, Austria and Germany, New
Zealand, Finland, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Hungary.  (Belgium
and France are in the works.) The scripts that collect listings for a
particular country are referred to as grabbers, and you'll find them on the
command line under <code>tv_grab_*</code>. We'll use the U.S. grabber,
<code>tv_grab_na</code>. 

<p>When you first run the grabber, do so with the <code>--configure</code> option. This
starts a question-and-answer session in which you and the grabber get a little
bit better acquainted, as far as your Zip code, TV service provider, and 
channels you want to ignore are concerned. The results of the script are written to
<code>~/.xmltv/tv_grab_na.conf</code>, and can be easily edited by hand.

<p>At this point, XMLTV is ready to do your bidding. Do a <code>man tv_grab_na</code> to learn
about all the available options. For now, just two will suffice:

<pre>
% tv_grab_na --days 1 --output /tmp/tv.xml
</pre>

This  tells the grabber to get one day's worth of listings, and save them out to <code>/tmp/tv.xml</code>.</p>

<p>XMLTV's file format doesn't quite make for friendly reading, unless you
enjoy reading raw markup.  A few more scripts from the suite can fix that. <code>tv_sort</code>
sorts the contents of an xmltv file date.
<code>tv_grep</code> lets you weed out some of the obvious cruft in the
listings.  Here's how I run it:

<pre>
% tv_sort --output /tmp/tv_sorted.xml /tmp/tv.xml
% tv_grep --output /tmp/tv_grepped.xml --ignore-case --not --category Children \
          --not --category Sports --not --title "Paid Programming" \
          --not --title "Local Origination" \
          --on-after now /tmp/tv_sorted.xml
</pre>

The commands above sort the original file and then discard anything
categorized as "Children" or "Sports", and anything with "Paid Programming"
(infomercials) or "Local Origination" (public access) in the title. Also,
we're discarding everything that aired before the script ran.</p>

<p>At this point, we've still got an XML file. Converters to the rescue!
<code>tv_to_text</code> is one of the tools that can help us go from XML to something else.
(Other possibilities include LaTeX, HTML and PDF. Check the readme to see what's
currently available.) After running something like this:

<pre>
% tv_to_text --output /tmp/tv.txt /tmp/tv_grepped.xml
</pre>

We get output like this:

<pre>
21:00--21:30    Spy School      38
21:00--21:30    Designing for the Sexes // European Kitchen     64
21:00--21:30    Chappelle's Show        67
21:00--21:30    The Real World // Las Vegas     71
21:00--22:00    Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit // Guilt      44
21:00--22:00    Wild Card // Auntie Venom       45
21:00--22:00    Cold Case Files // The Accidental Killer; Little Sister Lost    57
21:00--22:00    America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back // Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives     5
21:00--22:00    The FBI Files // The Price of Greed     60
21:00--22:00    Trading Spaces // Nashville: Murphywood Crossing        61
21:00--22:00    Great Chowder Cook-Off  63
21:00--22:00    Ends of the Earth // Secrets of the Holy Land   65
21:00--22:00    The E! True Hollywood Story // The Hilton Sisters       68
...
</pre>

Simple and no frills. Just what we need for the final step: e-mail delivery.</p>

<h2>Delivery</h2>

<p>If we stopped at this point we'd have used several of XMLTV's abilities but
hardly anything else.  We'd also be running low on convenience and automation.
Fortunately, we can wrap all the commands we've seen so far into a shell
script, and have it e-mail us the final results. <code>mail</code> can take care
of, well, the mailing:

<pre>
% mail -s "Today's TV listings from XMLTV" user@localhost < /tmp/tv.txt
</pre>

Here's what the full script looks like (<A HREF="misc/lovett/xmltv_daily.sh.txt">text version of this listing</a>):

<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# Grab today's listings:
tv_grab_na --days 1 --output /tmp/tv.xml

# Sort
tv_sort --output /tmp/tv_sorted.xml /tmp/tv.xml

# Grep
tv_grep --output /tmp/tv_grepped.xml --ignore-case --not --category Children \
--not --category Sports --not --title "Paid Programming" \
--not --title "Local Origination" \
--on-after now /tmp/tv_sorted.xml

# Convert To Text
tv_to_text --output /tmp/tv.txt /tmp/tv_grepped.xml

# Email
mail -s "Today's TV listings from XMLTV" user@localhost < /tmp/tv.txt

</pre>

Put that in a cron job that runs once per day, and you've got TV listings with no outside advertising,
and no channels or shows you know you aren't interested in.</p>

<p>More importantly, you've got a foundation to build on. What we've
covered is just the beginning&#151; beyond the command-line scripts, a
GUI client is also available. Of course, there are plenty more things you could do from the
command line, such as:

<ol>
  <li>Pull in data from imdb.com via <code>tv_imdb</code></li>
  <li>Split the listings into separate files for each day and channel via <code>tv_split</code></li>
  <li>Transform the XML with your own XSLT stylesheet.</li>
  <li>Only send e-mail if certain keywords are found</li>
</ol>

It all depends on how you want to consume the information, and how cleverly you can chain all the scripts
together.</p>
