    CONCEPT:
   Develop an application that automatically informs company personnel of
   actions taken, actions to be taken, items ordered, incoming items,
   etc.  Tasks, notifications and distribution lists can be quickly and
   easily created and used.  User lists can be automatically created from
   NT user lists.  Should have a universal import/export utility.  Should
   be a small application that is easily portable and downloadable.
   
    EXAMPLE OF CONCEPT:
   1. An employee wants to order a new chair to replace their broken
   chair.  He gets on the system and selects "Supply Request" from the
   list of drop down items that are available to all users, and requests
   the chair.
   2. The request is routed to the person's Supervisor for approval prior
   to being allowed to go to the Ordering Department.  The Supervisor
   enters an "Approval Code" that releases the task to continue on it's
   way.
   3. That request shows up on the "Ordering Department" person's task
   list.  They order the chair and place the information in the
   system.  That information is then used to notify:
   a. Accounting that an order has been place and how we will be billed
       b. Receiving that a package will be coming in that should go to
       the employee
       c. The employee, saying the chair has been ordered and the
       expected arrival date.
       d. Etc.
       
    4. When the chair arrives, Receiving acknowledges it in the system
   5. The Ordering department and Accounting department, and employee are
   notified that the chair arrived in good condition.
   6. When the invoice arrives and is paid by Accounting, they
   acknowledge it in the system and the Ordering Dept is notified that
   the chair was paid for.
   7. END
   
    EXAMPLE #2 OF CONCEPT:
   1. We receive a request to do some work.  Let's say set up a trade
   show.
   2. The account manager selects "Set Up a Tradeshow" from her custom
   dropdown list. ("Set Up a Tradeshow" is actually a compilation of
   smaller tasks that are grouped together.)
   3. She plugs the requested information into the system.
   4. The appropriate information is then distributed (with due dates
   that were also entered) to the employees who set up different aspects
   of the tradeshow.
   5. Each employee may receive 3 - 5 different tasks based on what
   normally is required to set up a trade show.
   6. As they complete the tasks information is sent back to the account
   manager, to accounting, shipping and receiving, etc. as is required by
   those tasks.
   7. Notifications are returned to the appropriate people as the tasks
   are completed, paid for, etc.
   8. END
   
    CENTRAL POINTS TO THE CONCEPT:
   1. The application ENABLES users to set up their own task and
   distribution lists, as opposed to having predefined tasks.
   2. The application is easy to use, so that with minimal training
   anyone can create, modify, delete and group tasks.
   3. The application asks for the information appropriate to each task.
   4. The application has to be very easy to work with.
   5. The application has a feedback function to notify people when tasks
   have not been completed.
   6. It should have a way to do a "one way notification" of people who
   are not on the system - using e-mail - such as clients or vendors.
   7. It should be able to import/export information for use with other
   systems as necessary.
   
    NEEDS/REQUIREMENTS:
   1. A database system that allows users to set up fields using a
   friendly interface.
   2. A distribution and notification element that routes task
   information, tracks due dates and notifies users of
   complete/incomplete tasks.
   3. Reporting capabilities.
   4. A user setup and management feature that allows certain tasks to be
   available to certain users or user groups.
   5. In import or interface utility that takes user information from an
   NT server's user list.
   6. A module that interfaces with the user's e-mail software for
   off-site notification of people who are not part of the system.
   7. Calendar and other task views.
   8. Task Cancellation abilities - where it sends notification of
   cancelled task and removes the tasks from other's task lists.
   9. Supervisor Level Approval.

    VIEWS, SCREENS AND WORKFLOW:
   
    LOGON SCREEN:
   1. Asks for username and password.
   2. This information identifies them to the system, determines what
   tasks and rights they have, etc.  Says who their approval supervisor
   is.
   
    MAIN VIEW SCREEN:
   1. "Tab View" interface where all screens are available at all times
   by clicking the appropriate tabs across the top (or bottom) of the
   screen.
   2. The default TAB is VIEW YOUR TASKS.
   3. Other available TABS include:  START A TASK, CREATE A TASK OR TASK
   GROUP, COMPLETED TASKS, CALENDAR VIEW, ADMINISTRATION/MAINT.
   
    VIEW YOUR TASKS SCREEN:
   1. Shows all current tasks as a single line list with the following
   fields:
   a. Task Name
       b. Due Date
       c. Notes/Procedures
       d. Assigned By
       e. Will Go To
       
    2. Double clicking on a task will bring up a task window that shows
   all the information in the task and has the following buttons:
   a. Complete Task
       b. Declined/Cancelled
       c. Request More Information/Problem Notification
       
    3. Clicking Complete Task will bring up another window for them to
   enter the appropriate information to complete the task.  This would
   include whatever information is assigned to the task such as "Ordered
   From", "Due Date", "Amount", "Invoiced".
