Are you a technical whiz with good general Linux knowledge? Can you
critique a book - even one in your specialty - and give its pros and cons
from a neutral point of view? Can you write a short but clear synopsis of
that book? If so, this is a great opportunity to get previews of the latest
books in this field and have lots of fun. Requires a strong sense of
responsibility and internal motivation - writing reviews can be hard work!

To quote Rob M. Slade (an excellent technical reviewer), from his FAQ at 
'http://victoria.tc.ca/int-grps/books/techrev/revfaq.htm':

  There are some benefits. As well as building the world's best technical
  library, I do find it a great way to keep up with the field: ongoing
  professional education. If you're going to review the books you have to
  read them. If you're going to publish the reviews you have to give the
  books serious thought. And if you're going to publish the reviews on the
  net, you've got to know what you are talking about, or you are going to
  hear about it right away :-)


Time commitment:
	Dependent on reading/writing speed, comprehension, etc.; variable
