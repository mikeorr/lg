<P>
<EM>This document is intended to be a tutorial, showing how to write
a simple assembly program in
several UNIX operating systems on IA32 (i386) platform.
Included material may or may not be applicable
to other hardware and/or software platforms.
Document explains program layout, system call convention,
and build process.
It accompanies Linux Assembly HOWTO, which may be of your interest as well,
though is more Linux specific.</EM>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Tools you need</A>
</H2>

<P>You will need several tools to play with programs included in this tutorial.
<P>First of all you need assembler (compiler).
As a rule modern UNIX distribution includes <CODE>gas</CODE> (GNU Assembler),
but all examples specified here use another assembler -- <CODE>nasm</CODE> (Netwide Assembler).
You can download it from the 
<A HREF="http://www.cryogen.com/Nasm/">nasm page</A>,
it comes with full source code.
Compile it, or try to find precompiled binary for your OS;
note that several distributions (at least Linux ones)
already have <CODE>nasm</CODE>, check first.
<P>Second, you need linker -- <CODE>ld</CODE>, since <CODE>nasm</CODE> produces only object code.
Any distribution should embrace <CODE>ld</CODE>.
<P>If you're going to dig in, you should also install include files for your OS,
and if possible, kernel source.
<P>Now you should be ready to start, welcome.. 
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Hello, world!</A></H2>

<P>
<P>Now we will write our program, classical &quot;Hello, world&quot; (hello.asm). 
You can download its sources and binaries 
<A HREF="http://linuxassembly.org/intro/hello.tgz">here</A>.
But before let me explain several basics.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 System call</A>
</H2>

<P>Unless program is just implementing some math algorithms in assembly,
it will deal with such things as getting input, producing output,
and exiting. Here comes a need to call some OS service.
In fact, programming in assembly language is quite the same in different OSes,
unless OS services are touched.
<P>There are two common ways of performing a system call in UNIX OS:
trough the C library (libc) wrapper, or directly.
<P>Using or not using libc in assembly programming is more a question
of taste/belief than something practical.
Libc wrappers are made to protect program from possible system call convention change,
and to provide POSIX compatible interface, if kernel lacks it for some call.
However usually UNIX kernel is more or less POSIX compliant,
this means that syntax of most libc &quot;system calls&quot; exactly
matches syntax of real kernel system calls (and vice versa).
But main drawback of throwing libc away is that are loosing several functions
that are not just syscall wrappers, like printf(), malloc() and similar.
<P>This tutorial will show how to use <B>direct</B> kernel calls,
since this is the fastest way to call kernel service;
our code is not linked to any library,
it communicates with kernel directly.
<P>Things that differ in different UNIX kernels
are set of system calls and system call convention
(however as they strive for POSIX compliance, there's a lot of common between them).
<P><EM>Note for (former) DOS programmers: so, what is that system call?
Better to explain it in such a way:
if you ever wrote a DOS assembly program (and most IA32 assembly programmers did),
you remember DOS services <CODE>int 0x21, int 0x25, int 0x26</CODE> etc..
This is what can be designated as system call.
However the actual implementation is absolutely different,
and this doesn't mean that system calls necessary are done via some interrupt.
Also, quite often DOS programmers mix OS services with BIOS services
like <CODE>int 0x10</CODE> or <CODE>int 0x16</CODE>, and are very surprised when they fail
to perform them in UNIX, since these are not OS services).</EM>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Program layout</A>
</H2>

<P>As a rule, modern IA32 UNIXes are 32bit (*grin*), run in protected mode,
have flat memory model, and use ELF format for binaries.
<P>Program can be divided into sections (or segments):
<CODE>.text</CODE> for your code (read-only),
<CODE>.data</CODE> for your data (read-write),
<CODE>.bss</CODE> for uninitialized data (read-write);
actually there can be few other, as well as user-defined sections,
but there's rare need to use them and they are out of our interest here.
Program must have at least <CODE>.text</CODE> section.
<P>Ok, now we'll dive into OS specific details.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Linux</A>
</H2>

<P>System calls in Linux are done through int 0x80.
(actually there's a kernel patch allowing system calls to be done
via <EM>syscall (sysenter)</EM> instruction on newer CPUs, but this
thing is still experimental).
<P>Linux differs from usual UNIX calling convention,
and features &quot;fastcall&quot; convention
for system calls (it resembles DOS).
System function number is passed in <CODE>eax</CODE>,
and arguments are passed through registers, not the stack.
There can be up to five arguments in <CODE>ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi</CODE> consequently.
If there's more than five arguments, they are simply passed though the
structure as first argument.
Result is returned in <CODE>eax</CODE>, stack is not touched at all.
<P>System call function numbers are in sys/syscall.h,
but actually in asm/unistd.h,
some documentation is in the 2nd section of manual
(f.e. to find info on <CODE>write</CODE> system call, issue <CODE>man 2 write</CODE>).
<P>There are several attempts to made up-to-date documentation of Linux system calls,
examine URLs in the 
<A HREF="boldyshev.html#references">references</A>.
<P>So, our Linux program will look like:

<P>As you will see futther, Linux syscall convention is the most compact one.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 FreeBSD</A>
</H2>

<P>FreeBSD has &quot;usual&quot; calling convention,
when syscall number is in eax, and parameters are on the stack
(the first argument is pushed the last).
System call is to be performed through the <B>function call</B> to a
function containing <CODE>int 0x80</CODE> and <CODE>ret</CODE>, not just <CODE>int 0x80</CODE> itself
(return address MUST be on the stack before <CODE>int 0x80</CODE> is issued!).
Caller must clean up the stack after call.
Result is returned as usual in <CODE>eax</CODE>.
<P>Also there's an alternate way of using <CODE>call 7:0</CODE> gate instead of <CODE>int 0x80</CODE>.
End-result is the same, not counting increase of program size,
since you will also need to <CODE>push eax</CODE> before,
and these two instructions occupy more bytes.
<P>System call function numbers are in sys/syscall.h,
documentation is in the 2nd section of man.
<P>Ok, I think the source will explain this better:

<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Building binary</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Building binary is usual two-step process of compiling and linking.
To make binary from our hello.asm we must do the following:
<P>
<HR>
<PRE>
$ nasm -f elf hello.asm         # this will produce hello.o object file
$ ld -s -o hello hello.o        # this will produce hello executable
</PRE>
<HR>
<P>That's it. Simple.
Now you can launch hello program by entering <CODE>./hello</CODE>, it should work.
Look at the binary size -- surprised?
<P>

<P>I hope you enjoyed the journey. If you get interested in assembly
programming for UNIX, I strongly encourage you to visit
<A HREF="http://linuxassembly.org">Linux Assembly</A>
for more information, and download
<A HREF="http://linuxassembly.org/asmutils.html">asmutils</A> package,
it contains a lot of sample code.
For comprehensive overview of Linux/UNIX assembly programming refer to the
