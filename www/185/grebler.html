<h1>HAL: Part 3 Functions</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/grebler.html">Henry Grebler</a></b></p>

<p>
I began this series with <A
HREF="../183/grebler1.html"> HAL: Part 1
Preliminaries</A>. I followed this with <A
HREF="../183/grebler1.html"> HAL: Part 2 My
Favourite Aliases</A>. This article deals with functions and another
will talk about scripts.
</p>

<p>
In the  first article there was a link which would allow the reader to
download my HAL. There you will find 63 functions. My use of aliases
predates my use of functions, so I would expect fewer functions
to be obsolete.
</p>

<p>
And yet, as I went through my functions while writing this article, I
found several that I no longer use; didn't realise I had.
</p>

<p>
Note that sometimes you will notice a function (for example, 'help'),
and another with the same name with 'o' at the end ('helpo'). This is
my convention for the older version of a function. It allows me to be
experimental in modifying a function, confident that I can easily
invoke the previous version which worked well.
</p>

<p>
In writing this article, I learned a trick. To list all aliases, one
simply issues the command <tt>alias</tt> without arguments. How do I
list <tt>bash</tt> functions? In the past I have used <tt>set</tt>,
but that lists all variables as well as functions. Eventually I
discovered the less-than-obvious <tt>declare -f</tt>.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_su">BSD_su HP_su Linux_su</A>
</pre>

<p>
The <tt>su</tt> command must be about the most idiosyncratic command
found on Unix-like platforms. In <b>~/.bashrc</b>, I define functions
for each platform. Near the bottom of that file, I <A
HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_set">set</A> the alias
<tt>su</tt> according to the current platform.
</p>

<p>
On a FreeBSD machine, I see this:
</p>

<pre class="code">
	type -a su
	su is aliased to `BSD_su'
	su is /usr/bin/su
</pre>

<p>
whereas on a Linux machine I see this:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
	type -a su
	su is aliased to `Linux_su'
	su is /bin/su
</pre>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_alias">alias</A>
</pre>

<p>
The alias function was discussed in part 2. It's probably worth
repeating.
</p>

<p>
Normally, you have to write
</p>

<pre>        alias name=value</pre>

<p>
My function allows me to write
</p>

<pre>        alias name value</pre>

<p>
This is why in $HOME/.ENV./.cshrc_bash you will see all the aliases
defined without the use of an equal sign (=).
</p>

<p>
I started using c-shell before I discovered bash (which originated
about 1989). In c-shell, the syntax for aliases does not use an equal
sign:
</p>

<pre>        alias name wordlist</pre>

<p>
My function facilitated the transition from c-shell to bash.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_cutf">cutf</A>
</pre>

<p>
For many requirements, <tt>cut</tt> is much more flexible than
<tt>awk</tt>. Syntax like <tt>-f 3-7</tt>, imbues <tt>cut</tt> with a
convenience which is vastly greater than that of <tt>awk</tt>.
However, <tt>cut</tt> is much more restrictive in its notion of a
field; whereas <tt>awk</tt> understands fields in a more human way. If
a delimiter is not specified to <tt>awk</tt>, it treats white space as
a delimiter. The default delimiter for <tt>cut</tt> is the tab
character.
</p>

<p>
I think I intended to build up my function <tt>cutf</tt> over time. In
the event, it has served me well in its initial incarnation.
</p>

<p>
I can (and often do) write something like
</p>

<pre class="code">
	scan | grep -i article | cutf 1
</pre>

<p>
in preference to
</p>

<pre class="code">
	scan | grep -i article | awk '{print $1}'
</pre>

<p>
It's just so much more convenient.
</p>

<p>
Here's why I might do it. This example is from the way I handle my
mail with <tt>nmh</tt>. I've edited a little for readability.
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
$ scan | grep -i article
  30 -14Feb2011 Ben Okopnik        Re: Article (perhaps): Life Can be Tough
  33  14Feb2011 Ben Okopnik        Re: Article update: Everything You Always
  52  19Feb2011 Ben Okopnik        Re: Rounding articles 
$ aaa=`scan | grep -i article | cutf 1`
$ refile $aaa +lg
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The first command displays a summary of current emails (in my inbox),
1 line per email, for those lines in which the string "article"
appears. In the second command, I gather together just the first field
of each line (the message numbers). The third command moves the
selected messages to a different mailbox.
</p>

<p>
I could do the above in fewer lines, but that's not my objective here.
</p>


<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_dc">dc</A>
</pre>

<p>
This function panders to my apparent dyslexic typing. I often get the
order of my characters wrong. I may type <b>dc $HOME</b> when I meant
to type <b>cd $HOME</b>. There is a command <tt>dc</tt> (an arbitrary
precision calculator), but the way I use it, it normally takes no
arguments. The <tt>dc</tt> function checks if there is a single
argument, and whether that single argument is a directory, and if so
does what I meant rather than what I said. If I type <tt>dc</tt>
without args, it invokes the command <tt>dc</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, I never use the first form deliberately.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_dirs">dirs dsd dsdc dth files links</A>
</pre>

<p>
These are all variations on the <tt>ls</tt> command. <tt>dirs</tt>
shows just directories; <tt>files</tt> shows just regular files;
<tt>links</tt> shows just symbolic links. <tt>dsd</tt> shows all
entries except for emacs backup files with the result piped through
<tt>more</tt>.
</p>

<p> 
<tt>dsdc</tt> is like <tt>dsd</tt> but only shows entries with
today's (the current) date. It turned out to be a stepping stone. I
think something like <tt>dsdc</tt> existed on VMS. Nothing similar was
available on Linux. However, these days <tt>dth</tt> has almost completely
supplanted <tt>dsdc</tt>. 
</p>

<p>
The function <tt>dth</tt> was discussed exhaustively in <A
HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/181/grebler.html">What Really Matters or
The Counting Article</A>.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_gt">gt_doit gttv gttvu gtx</A>
</pre>

<p>
In essence, <tt>gttv</tt> is a function which lists the table of
contents of a tar-zipped file. It performs gunzip or bunzip2
(depending on file type) piped into "<tt>tar -tvf -</tt>" piped into
my pager. <tt>gttvu</tt> does all of the above preceded by a
<tt>uudecode</tt> (not all that common these days). <tt>gtx</tt> is
like <tt>gttv</tt> except it unpacks a tar-zipped file.
</p>

<p>
<tt>gt_doit</tt> is simply the helper function invoked by the other
functions.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_help">help</A>
</pre>

<p>
This function is discussed in detail in <A
HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/174/grebler.html">Henry's
Techno-Musings: My Help System</A>.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_lesh">lesh</A>
</pre>

<p>
One of my most frequently used functions. Think of it as a cross
between <tt>less</tt> and <tt>dth</tt>. With no arguments, it works
like <tt>less</tt> on the most recent file in the current directory.
If the first argument is of the form <tt>+n</tt>, it displays the
first <i>n</i> files in the current directory, or, if there are args after
the <tt>+n</tt>, the first <i>n</i> files which match the remaining args. If args are
files, they are the candidates for most recent; if they are
directories, the files within those directories are the candidates.
</p>

<p>
For example, <b>lesh +3 /var/log</b> will display the 3 most recent
files in the system log directory.
</p>

<p>
The section "My 'less' command" in <A
HREF="../174/grebler.html">Henry's
Techno-Musings: My Help System</A> explains why this allows me to scan
through several files conveniently.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_lest">lest</A>
</pre>

<p>
I really should use the concept of this function more extensively.
Let's say I have script. It could be mine, or one somewhere on the
system; I know its name; it's in my path; but I can't remember where
it is. Or I can remember where it is, but I don't really care. I just
want to look at it with less. <b>lest scriptname</b> will find it and
open it. For example, <tt>irb</tt> is a ruby script in
<tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>. <b>lest irb</b> opens it in <tt>less</tt>.
</p>

<p>
It's a consolidation of my typical behaviour. Often, I found myself
going <b>type -a command</b>, then wanting to look in the file in the
answer.
</p>

<p>
Here's a better example. It shows that <tt>lest</tt> also works on aliases. 
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
type -a tcu
tcu is aliased to `/home/henryg/scripts/tarcompressuuencode.sh'
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<b>less tcu</b> makes no sense ("<tt>tcu: No such file or
directory</tt>"). But <b>lest tcu</b> works just fine.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_loc">loc</A>
</pre>

<p>
This is my variation on <tt>find</tt>. With a single arg, it looks in the
current directory tree for an entry with the supplied string somewhere
in its name. With 2 args, it takes the first as the directory to
search.
</p>

<p>
These days I think it would be more useful if it were rewritten to do
"<b>find | grep</b>" rather than "<b>find -name</b>". 
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_mangl">mangl</A>
</pre>

<p>
Sometimes I get the impression there are man pages everywhere. It's
hard to keep up. On most of the systems I manage, I have a pretty good
handle on where man pages are. But even on these systems, some man
pages pop up in unexpected places. On systems that I visit but don't
control, man pages could be anywhere. If I've tried <tt>apropos</tt>
and <tt>man</tt> and still haven't found what I'm looking for, I might
try <tt>locate</tt>. If this exposes a man page of interest, I can use
<b>mangl pathname</b> to get the man page formatted with
<tt>nroff</tt>.
</p>

<p>
And, yes, the name is a weak pun.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_mcd">mcd</A>
</pre>

<p>
Another simple function that often gets a work-out. Basically,
<tt>mkdir</tt> plus <tt>cd</tt>: make a directory and cd to it.
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_ping">ping</A>
</pre>

<p>
I have never seen the point of having ping relentlessly bang on the
door of the remote machine. It reminds me of Sheldon in The Big Bang
Theory: [knock, knock, knock] "Penny!" [knock, knock, knock] "Penny!"
[knock, knock, knock] "Penny!"
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
/sbin/ping fw
PING fw (192.168.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.340 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.278 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.207 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.240 ms
...
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Surely once is enough:
</p>

<p>
<pre class="code">
ping fw
PING fw (192.168.0.1): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.0.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.277 ms
</p>

<p>
--- fw ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 packets received, 0.0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 0.277/0.277/0.277/0.000 ms
</pre>
</p>

<p>
On Solaris, by default, all you get is a single line: "<tt>fw is alive</tt>".
</p>

<pre>
		* * * * * * * * * * * * *

	<A HREF="misc/grebler/HAL.Functions.html#HF_truss">truss</A>
</pre>

<p>
A very important function. I guess I encountered <tt>truss</tt> on
Solaris. I learned to use and love it. So, of course, when I moved to
other platforms, I soon felt the need. Linux flavours have
<tt>strace</tt>; FreeBSD has <tt>truss</tt>, but the parameters are
different.
</p>

<p>
Once again, I have a function that hides these idiosyncrasies from me
and lets me get on with the job.
</p>

<p>

<h3>And That's About It</h3>
</p>

<p>
I don't think there's much more to say about functions. Only 14
descriptions of about 25 functions. The others aren't worth the
trouble.

Henry has spent his days working with computers, mostly for computer
 manufacturers or software developers. His early computer experience
 includes relics such as punch cards, paper tape and mag tape. It is
 his darkest secret that he has been paid to do the sorts of things he
 would have paid money to be allowed to do. Just don't tell any of his
 employers. 
</p>

<p>
He has used Linux as his personal home desktop since the family got its
 first PC in 1996. Back then, when the family shared the one PC, it was a
 dual-boot Windows/Slackware setup. Now that each member has his/her own
 computer, Henry somehow survives in a purely Linux world.
