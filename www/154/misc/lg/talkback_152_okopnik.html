[Hmm ...  I appear to have, yet again, subtly broken your lovely
pinehelper.pl script.  I mean, should Subject: be that plain?
Production version at end.  When I mouse-over the link, I see
mailto:tag@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=Talkback:152/okopnik.html,
so I must have broken some quoting stuff in the script.  Or maybe you
already fixed this, and I should check old mail for the fix?  Good
idea.  :-]

  Re: Review of the Plat'Home OpenBlockS
</p>

<p>
You editors make tough reviewers.  I imagine the poor guys at
Plat'Home are shaking their heads and muttering "never again" over
and over.
</p>

<p>
In the early days of Linux, <strong>all</strong> the documentation read like it had
been written by one of Ted T'so's worshippers, shipped to Germany for
reformatting, filtered through Chef, then translated by Vietnamese
into English (out of this was born the LDP).  Others aren't so lucky
as us in this modern age of ours.
</p>

<p>
I thought it courageous (though perhaps obviously doomed to failure)
to ship you their latest for review.  Were you trying to buy and use
this thing, or did they think you were only reviewing it for
publication?
</p>

<p>
I envy you that secret weapon of yours.  It's fascinating reading to
hear you two go at translating their dox into meaningfulness.  I hope
you passed on your notes to Plat'Home?
</p>

<p>
And, yeah, frankly, telnet/ftp <strong>ought</strong> to be locked down to the serial
interface *until you* open them up!  That is good security.  Both of
them transmit pwords en clair, dammit.  Cut 'em some slack (I humbly
suggest).
</p>

<p>
Have you any experience with Soekris boxes or Mini-ITX form factor?
That's likely what you're really looking for (if you weren't just
offering to review the thing), though they aren't really "palm sized"
either.  OpenBSD uses Soekris in demos showing their pf firewall
running in parallel on two boxes, cleanly failing over when power's
cut on one of them, no transmission loss.  Slick.
</p>

<p>
Interesting review.  I think I would have taken the thing with a bit
more of a grain of salt than you, but I wasn't there.  At least I know
this is not the next box to try to move Mom to.  <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)">  However, I've
been intrigued by it since I heard of it too.

I'm not sure what you think it is that's broken, but that's exactly what
'mailto' links display when moused over in a number of browsers. Why is
'Subject:' supposed to be such a big secret?

&gt; 
&gt; You editors make tough reviewers.  I imagine the poor guys at
&gt; Plat'Home are shaking their heads and muttering "never again" over
&gt; and over.
</pre>

<p>
If they vow to never again ship, or send for review, a product that is
not ready to be used by the average human who is likely to buy it, I
have achieved my purpose in that review.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; In the early days of Linux, <strong>all</strong> the documentation read like it had
&gt; been written by one of Ted T'so's worshippers, shipped to Germany for
&gt; reformatting, filtered through Chef, then translated by Vietnamese
&gt; into English (out of this was born the LDP).  Others aren't so lucky
&gt; as us in this modern age of ours.
&gt; 
&gt; I thought it courageous (though perhaps obviously doomed to failure)
&gt; to ship you their latest for review. Were you trying to buy and use
&gt; this thing, or did they think you were only reviewing it for
&gt; publication?
</pre>

<p>
Can you tell me why you'd expect to see any difference in the review
based on that distinction? It seems to me that anyone who <strong>would</strong> give
more leniency to a product they're reviewing just because they didn't
pay for it is guilty of a) pandering to the vendor and b) doing a
disservice to any future purchasers of the product, thus undercutting
their own reputation as a reviewer. Not to mention prostituting their
integrity (if any.)
</p>

<p>
There's too many of those out there already, thank you - the greatest
majority, in my opinion. The current Editor-in-Chief of LG - that's me,
until things change - prefers his reviews honest to a fault, with
products tested to destruction if necessary, and with any warts clearly
labelled. Any company that wants to piss in the tall grass had better be
able to lift its leg at least that high, or it's going to get laughed
at. By the same token, when we hand out a positive review, it should be
a gold standard of its own. That's my take on it, period. (If you
visualize me sitting in an office - which I don't - and with a picture
of Edward R. Murrow behind and above me, overseeing everything I do -
which it's not - you'll have my perception of my job at critical moments
just about right.)
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; I envy you that secret weapon of yours.  It's fascinating reading to
&gt; hear you two go at translating their dox into meaningfulness.  I hope
&gt; you passed on your notes to Plat'Home?
</pre>

<p>
Of course. I sent a very detailed email to their tech guy - who was, by
the way, quite professional and pleasant, as was everyone I've
communicated with at Plat'Home. This does not, however, affect what is
true about their product.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; And, yeah, frankly, telnet/ftp <strong>ought</strong> to be locked down to the serial
&gt; interface *until you* open them up!  That is good security.  Both of
&gt; them transmit pwords en clair, dammit.  Cut 'em some slack (I humbly
&gt; suggest).
</pre>

<p>
This would be true <strong>IF</strong> - and only if - the rest of the product showed
anything like good security. Didn't you read the actual review? Default
login via http (which sends passwords in the clear), using the root
account - ONLY - and no ability to change passwords? A serial console
(hell-loooo, 1998!), which requires fiddling with XON/XOFF, bits, port
numbers, etc., instead of a simple USB connection? You've got to be
kidding me.
 
</p>

<pre>
&gt; Have you any experience with Soekris boxes or Mini-ITX form factor?
&gt; That's likely what you're really looking for (if you weren't just
&gt; offering to review the thing)
</pre>

<p>
That's exactly what I offered - a review. Again, as stated in the
article.
</p>


<pre>
&gt;, though they aren't really "palm sized"
&gt; either.  OpenBSD uses Soekris in demos showing their pf firewall
&gt; running in parallel on two boxes, cleanly failing over when power's
&gt; cut on one of them, no transmission loss.  Slick.

</pre>

<p>
Kinda my point. It's 2008; there's no reason in the world that an
appliance like this shouldn't be a simple plug + tweak + play, with a
good default config. Not what they shipped me; not even close.
