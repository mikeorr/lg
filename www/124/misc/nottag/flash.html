<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I looked at February's LG and saw the HelpDex cartoons are Flash
movies.  Is this the way of the future?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Why, I don't know, Mike. It could be the <em>wave</em> of the future, perhaps.
If you look far, far back in history - like back in January - the
&quot;collinge&quot; cartoons were done as an SWF there as well.</p>
<p>Just for the record, exactly <em>one</em> person complained last month. He's
currently researching to see if his complaint is actually a reasonable
one - since I've pointed out some Open Source alternatives to
Macromedia's products, and we spent some time discussing the Macromedia
license - and has promised to write an article on the subject as soon as
he has gathered more data.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I'm not especially thrilled
with content that requires users to install a proprietary plugin.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
[shrug] I wasn't especially thrilled with the version that you had,
which required the viewers to download a huge file and showed it to them
as a tiny thumbnail (which &quot;linked&quot; to the full-sized file.) To each his
own, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I
never install Flash till I absolutely need it, so I'll have to go home
before I can see what these cartoons are (and whether they really need
to be animated).</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
It's not a question of animation. Flash is what Shane sends me; that's
the format he creates it in. Converting it to some other format seems to
be a very low-priority task for him - unsurprisingly so - and since Jon
Harsem seems to have stopped creating cartoons, and Javier Malonda's
output has gone down to very little (and much of that, according to a
note on his site, will be translated into English on an intermittent
basis), we don't have much to pick and choose from.</p>
<p>As I see it, my choices come down to a) not having any cartoons at all,
b) using that proprietary software you mentioned, and dinking around
with screen shots, etc., or c) letting everyone else make the choice of
what they want to do with it. Choice b), incidentally, produces fairly
lousy JPGs - but they're the only format which results in a reasonable
file size for these cartoons, although it <em>still</em> had the detriment of
loading those large files and &quot;cheat-thumbnailing&quot; them. Fixing the
above would require me to rewrite that Python template <em>and</em> your
script, which (of course) chokes on actual thumbnails placed in the
cartoon author's directory.</p>
<p>And, lest we forget, option b) just shifts the &quot;burden&quot; of using that
proprietary software to me instead of having everybody decide what to do
about it on their own. Um... not interested in that job, thanks.</p>
<p>Oh, and - Flash produces excellent image quality in a file size that's
about half the size of a very poor JPG image, as well as auto-sizing
itself to whatever the viewer's screen size is. Just a minor side note.</p>
<p>In short, using Flash requires me to do a lot less work, requires our
readers to download fewer kilobytes for the same amount of content and
much higher quality, does not require the author <em>or</em> anyone else to
spend time to dink with a format that works well to begin with. On the
other hand, it does require the use of a free-but-proprietary viewer -
at least for now.</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://osflash.org/">http://osflash.org/</a></p>
<p>If you've got a suggestion that doesn't require me to waste a bunch of
time every month and results in an open-source-supported format, I'd be
glad to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
This is just a comment; it's Ben's decision whether
to have Flash in LG.  I'm just disappointed I can't see the cartoons.
:(  I'm still behind on my list mail so maybe there was a discussion
about Flash.  If not, can we have one now?  Is everyone happy with
Flash in LG?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
I'm not all that excited by it, but see the choices above.</p>
<p><strong>[Shane Collinge]</strong>
I've had this discussion with multiple people already (including Ben) and have a few comments:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>I can understand the whole &quot;proprietary&quot; thing. But the file's a free download, people have been using Real Player for years, nobody's complained too loudly about that. And the download doesn't install malware or anything.</li>
<li>SWF are insanely small file sizes with comparably, insanely high file quality that fit ANY screen res - something JPGs don't do.</li>
<li>SWF files can't be ripped off and manipulated as easily as JPGs can</li>
<li>I'm not being paid for any of the drawing, so I guess I can therefore choose my medium!</li>
<li>There are other tools to create SWFs - you don't need to buy Flash, I've even seen ways to create it via PHP.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ummm... SWF seems to be the latest evolutionary step in my technique, because of the high quality
finish with low file size, plus the nice colours and ability to animate. Whether it's embracing
the devil or not, I don't know. But that's where I am right now, I guess. Sorry to the people that
don't agree with this technique.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
No problem, man.  I just didn't know what direction you were going or
why.  Whether the .SWF were just occasional or permanent, whether you
felt they were a better long-term media for you or what.  That's
separate from the discussion of LG, and as I've said I've given up
control over that.  I was just surprised the change had happened
without a discussion or even announcement in LG, but I've been sick
for the past month so maybe I've missed it.  But none of it is your
fault.  I'm glad you're still making cartoons.</p>
<p><strong>[Shane]</strong>
Nah, I've been using Flash for over two years now! For producing my style of artwork, I think it
ruuuuules. Sure, the Flash creation software's proprietary but the SWF format's not - to the best
of my knowledge, anyway. I actually downloaded the specs from the Macromedia site a while ago
because I was toying with the idea of making my own SWF creation program using OpenGL as it's
engine. I use Flash for animation sure, but for HelpDex still images I just use the vector part of
the software, to get nice solid clean lines and strong, fast colouring. Flash has some glitches in
its interface that bug the bejeesus out of me, but also has some good &amp; great parts and the net
result is I like it much more than I hate it. As for discussions on LG and their introduction of
it... well I guess that's outside my control (other than me giving them the new format). This also
means that next year when I have time and start ANIMATING HelpDex - fingers crossed! - the
infrastructure's already there. Not sure if you've seen them, but I've already animated about 7 or
10 HelpDexes anyway. So allowance for animation needs to be made in the LG code at some stage if
they want to run these.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Shane, what would need to be done differently in order to play Flash
animations? As far as I know, the HTML wrapper that we're using around
it right now works just fine for Flash movies; I've tried it out with
animated content, and it seems to work fine.</p>
<p><strong>[Shane]</strong>
If your code's currently showing the static SWF images, then there's NO change that needs to be
done - it'll all just work. The static image you curently see is actually just an animation with a
single frame rather than many, and to the user an aniamtion would simply show the &quot;loading...
xxx%&quot; messages you normally see before kicking off into its show.</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
I'm a bit puzzled. Why would people want to put cartoons in a JPEG
format? As I understand it JPEG is for photographs, not for drawings.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Javier Malonda's Ecol cartoons are in PNG.  PNG is more efficient for
images with few colors (like cartoons); JPG is more efficient for
images with thousands of colors (like photographs).  But LG has long
accepted JPGs in either case without converting them because it's not
that big a deal.  The current browsers handle PNG fine.  Netscape 4.77
couldn't display PNG with transparency; it showed up as a solid box. 
I don't know why Shane chose JPG but it may have been for
compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
I've actually spent some time reading up on image formats in the past,
and have seen the 'this format is best for $FOOBAR, while that one is
best for $BLAH' arguments. As far as I'm concerned, in practice, they're
not real distinctions. That is, it is possible to make a 16 million
color PNG in a ~60kB-size file (and a 256x256 color in 678 (!) bytes),
but that appears to bear <em>no</em> relation to processing actual, real-life
images, where I want the image to convey maximum information in a
minimum file size. In that latter case, except for a small number of
exceptions - and I'm sad to say that I have not determined the common
factor for those - JPGs come out smaller than PNGs, by an overwhelming
majority.</p>
<p>In the case of one of Shane's cartoons, it looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
502thumbs.swf    20269
502thumbs.jpg    53862
502thumbs.png   138759
</pre>
<p>Note that both the JPG and the PNG have been compressed as much as
possible without losing image quality (via &quot;jpegoptim&quot; and &quot;pngcrush&quot;,
respectively) and are each 800x335px in size; both show up rather jaggy
on my 1280x800 screen. The SWF, despite its much smaller filesize, shows
no visible artifacts when viewed at that resolution; bringing the two
images up to an equivalent display size nearly doubles the filesize.</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
PNG is a reasonable format for drawings that need to be exported in
bitmap format. For drawings that were made in vector format and will
be subjected to arbitrary scaling there is SVG and Java...and also
Flash.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I don't know about vector formats; I've never seen them on the web. 
I've only seen Flash used for its animation ability, not to make a
scalable still.  So Flash is really a vector drawing program?</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
As far as I know the latter is an open format,</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Is the format actually published?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Given that GNU is developing a viewer based on the SWF specification, I
have a sneaking suspicion that it is, yes.</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gnash/</a></p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
I admit that both these were assumptions based on what I had seen
(that flash scales really well) and &quot;heard&quot; (from the osflash site).</p>
<p><strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
The format was published around the time of Flash 3; I don't know if the more recent versions were published, but people have gotten pretty used to reverse engineering it.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Do the free players work with all
Flash content?</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
I don't know about <strong>all</strong> content but the swfdec-mozilla-player that
comes in the Debian package swf-player can show the HelpDex cartoons
just fine. So also those animated &quot;greeting cards&quot; that some people
occasionally send me. The only unfortunate aspect of this viewer
is that it drags in gazillion other packages since it is based on
&quot;gstreamer&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Do we know that Macromedia won't add proprietary
extensions to discourage the use of other players and composers?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
And what if they did? Mike, that's a red herring and you know it -
that's a &quot;what-if&quot; that you can play with many projects. The answer is
that we'd use the currently-available versions - or switch to another
format whenever it suits us. Where's the problem?</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
<em>We</em> can put files with only compatible features in LG and switch
formats whenever we want.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
So can anyone else. That's exactly the point.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I'm talking about Flash in general.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Why? What makes it so important? It's useful for <em>today;</em> if it doesn't
suit tomorrow, it'll be discarded in favor of something that does.
That's how technology <strong>works</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
If
Macromedia does add stuff to it, we (free software types) will be
playing catch-up all the time like we do with Samba and Word and used
to do with PDF and Postscript.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Anyone that feels like playing catch-up is welcome to do that. Those of
us who don't, won't. I've never felt like I was playing catch-up with
either PDF or PostScript; I got exactly what I wanted out of them, in
the case of both creating and displaying them.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Better to just boycott the format.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
You're welcome to do that. I'd say that you're going to lose out on the
content that the rest of us are going to have access to, but it's your
choice.</p>
<p>Look, Mike. You're making all kinds of unsubstantiated claims about
Flash, and at this point are calling for a boycott against it - <strong>still</strong>
based on nothing more than those vague claims that you yourself have
generated. I don't see that there's anything useful to be had out of
further discussion about it - at least pending additional facts. Let's
just let it go until then, 'K?</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
One comment and then I'll shut up.  How is accepting Flash documents
different from accepting Word documents?</p>

<p>I recall that one could buy the RGB books of postscript that described
the language in great detail; and there was no clause in those
books that said &quot;thou shalt not write something called ghostscript
that implements this language&quot;. What <strong>did</strong> happen is that there
was a section of postscript that allowed each printer to have its
own proprietary PS dictionary. A &quot;driver&quot; for that printer then used
operators from that dictionary to enhance printing and the resulting
postscript files did not work well with ghostscript of course.
Postscript files that were generated using tools like &quot;dvips&quot; which
were based on the RGB books alone, worked fine with ghostscript <strong>and</strong>
with most PS printers. As people started exchanging PS files over the
net these proprietary extensions became a hindrance and were mostly
dropped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pdf">
<h4><a name="pdf">PDF</a></h4>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong but PDF was Adobe's &quot;network&quot;-if-ied version of
Postscript. They tried to build in the proprietary extensions in a
way that they would be network transparent but again were largely
unsuccessful. There is of course, the &quot;default 16 fonts&quot; issue (that
was in some sense an issue with PS as well) but as long as you had
reasonable substitutes for those fonts everything worked just fine.
Again documents that were generated using tools like &quot;pdflatex&quot; that
included all the fonts/glyphs used worked fine with all readers.
What &quot;xpdf&quot; cannot currently do are the fancy &quot;transitions&quot; like
&quot;Dissolve&quot;---I don't know why this is so, but it has not bothered
me since I don't care for it. To me encrypted PDF is like encrypted

won't.</p>

<p>Andrew Tridgell and folks (a big salute to them) patiently gathered
network traffic in order to decode the way in which SMB was spoken

course, the MicroSoft will continue to improve/modify(:)) their
protocol but existing deployment prevents them from introducing
incompatibilities that would break Samba as it would probably break
Windows 95/98 as well. Note that Samba has (always had?) some security
features over and above that offered by the proprietary version so
in principle a number of people <strong>did</strong> switch over to Samba servers
instead of proprietary servers. When enough people do that the
proprietary protocol is under pressure to be more compatible with the

<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
It's exactly the same, Mike; no difference at all. Both have the .doc
extension, both are common Web formats, both are Open Source, both have
a project at GNU.org creating a viewer for them, both have an entire
Open Source community creating authoring tools and discussing the
exciting possibilities of the format, sharing code, tips, and even
programming tutorials...</p>
<p>No difference whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Of course I <strong>have</strong> to read
Word documents sometimes.  But otherwise it's a tradeoff between how
much I need the content vs how much I don't want to support vendor
lock-in.  Just like with other less-than-free formats like DRM music
or CSS DVDs.  The only way to blow these formats away is to put
pressure on the content creators to release stuff in totally open
formats.  If they won't make content in the formats we want, we'll
just make our own content instead.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Feel free. So far, I haven't seen anything from you - or anyone else -
that can make a claim of being even partially equivalent to Flash.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Maybe SWF will look free-er in a couple years than it does now, and
become the widespread medium of choice among free-software
enthusiasts.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
It has; it just hasn't gained <em>your</em> favor. At this point, it looks like
you're arguing to defend the position that you took up initially even
though that position has completely crumbled away... but, hey, losers
get killed and eaten here, so you've <strong>got</strong> to defend it to the death. I
understand, and even sympathize (although I don't think in terms of
winners and losers here, or even in terms of any kind of competition
that results in such a thing) - but I'm glad that this is your &quot;one
[last] comment&quot; on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
It's been done before with Postscript,</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Really? As far as I'm aware, Adobe just kept quietly releasing
Ghostscript as Free software one version behind from the very start,</p>
<p><strong>[Jimmy]</strong>
Ghostscript has nothing to do with Adobe, other than implementing a
language they designed.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
This is what I recalled from reading their docs, a number of years
ago... but I seem to recall that they had a commercial and a free
version, one level apart. Is that right, or am I thinking of someone
else?</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Aladdin had a commercial and a free version, one generation apart.
AFAIK they weren't related to Adobe.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
That must have been it, thanks; I obviously mis-remembered the company
name, given the close connection with the format, etc.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Adobe published the format for
PDF only when market forces forced them to.  I remember an article
about an executive &quot;with tears in his eyes&quot; as he made the
announcement.  Because it was the end of their cash cow.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Well, not exactly. If it <em>was</em> the end, then they wouldn't have had to
do anything - much less release the format into the wild. Their business
model was changing, and that often results in managers (who tend to be
highly conservative as a breed) cry lakes of salty tears. [shrug] Note
that Adobe is still in business, and going strong; old Bessy is still
producing lots of milk. Only the milking method has changed.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
much like ATI with their video drivers (although with a lot fewer
problems.) Nobody has &quot;forced&quot; Adobe to do anything by not using PS; in
fact, anyone doing serious layout work in the Unix world would never
have considered using anything else. I guess that continuous usage
somehow constituted &quot;pressure&quot; on Adobe... but I must say that the logic
eludes me. In my simple-minded worldview, it looks more like complete
<em>absence</em> of any pressure on them, coupled with the company's desire to
have a market-dominant format - and to sell the high-end tools to the
people who do the big-time professional stuff with it. Every person that
uses the format is a small but positive influence for authoring in that
format - and Adobe appears to have a firm grasp of that principle.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
and PDF is
getting more widespread too now in free software projects.  But that
still doesn't erase their &quot;tainted&quot; origins as proprietary formats
originally used to lock in a captive market.  Maybe we should be glad
they were later given as gifts to the world.  But the way that
happened still bothers me.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Perhaps they should do penance - CEOs should be flogged in the town
square, chained in full view of the public they've abused with their
evil former behavior and fed dry crusts of bread for a couple of years
just so we all <strong>know</strong> they've truly atoned. This would be such a
tremendous motivational technique for all the other closed-source
companies that they would <strong>immediately</strong> and inevitably jump on the Open
Source bandwagon...</p>
<p>When companies realize that it's in their <strong>interest</strong> to support Open
Source, then they do so. Until they see that, they don't - AND RIGHTLY
SO, as far as I'm concerned. Companies are not run in order to please
Mike Orr - at least, I've never seen it at the top of anyone's
requirements chart - but to make a profit; those that make the right
moves to continue making profits are the ones that survive.</p>
<p>I know what side of that fence I'm on, and time will tell whose vision
is right (as far as I'm concerned, it already has - although it's not
quite as clearly evident as absence/presence of oxygen.) The world of
business is agnostic - in fact, rather Zen Buddhist in its operation;
there's no penance, atonement, required suffering, etc. Do the right
thing, and you gain merit (money); do the wrong thing, and you lose it.
Trying to see it as some sort of a Brueghel Hell, with sinners flogged
eternally for their errors, isn't going to get you any sort of a true
picture of what's happening. Nor is anyone going to buy into it,
particularly when you demand that the skin come off <em>their</em> backs.</p>

PDF is &quot;open&quot;, for instance, but people can still make encrypted PDFs
or not include the fonts in the file, and then the non-Acrobat readers
are screwed.  I haven't seen those for a while so I don't know if
people are making more standards-oriented PDFs now or the problems
have been resolved in xpdf.</p>

RealPlayer is annoyingly proprietary but I've long reconciled myself
to it.  At least the company is OS neutral.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
I find it fascinating that you're willing to make excuses for a
proprietary product while bringing up all sorts of objections about an
open format. Is that the sound of an ox being gored in the neighborhood
of Seattle?</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I don't understand the last sentence.  I did find myself shut out from
some sites that required RealMedia 10 or so because there wasn't a
Linux version of it.  That was a while ago and I don't remember the
sites.  I didn't know SWF was ever open.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
I feel better listening
to radio programs in RealAudio format than Windows Media, and it's
easier to configure than getting the browser to send an MP3 file to
MPlayer or XMMS.  (Hi, MPlayer, why are you just sitting there
silently?)</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Firefox with the MPlayer plugin works fine for me.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
Or worse, sites that have their own built-in player.) 
We've never had sound files in LG so it's never been an issue here.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Well, we've had a few within the past year or so.</p>

Fortunately, if we do want sound files someday, there's an open format
(OGG).</p>
<p>Ben, I didn't make thumbnails because I was lazy, OK?  Nobody ever
complained about the size of the downscaled image files or the
distortion of the images.  If they had, I would've done something more
elaborate.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Most people take that kind of irritants in stride, since investing time
and effort in dealing with them is likely to end up being unproductive
anyway. Hell, I certainly had grounds for complaint: downloading a page
for 10 minutes over a 1kB/S cell modem only to see tiny little
thumbnails resulted in me ignoring the funnies in LG during much of the
time that I'd been reading it. However, I just figured that it was how
it had to be - LG being a volunteer effort - and I'd just live with it.
I damn sure would have preferred not to.</p>
<p>(Note: I'm currently in the process of writing a CGI app that sucks up
an image filename as a parameter and spits out an image <strong>stream</strong> -
meaning that you can use it as a thumbnail link for a given image
without having to generate an actual thumbnail file. When it's done,
I'll be happy to send it on request.)</p>

though the
software most commonly used to produce and view the content is not
free.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Thank you for bringing that up: that's precisely the point that I made
to Saul (the one person who complained about Flash last month.) The
<em>creator</em> software from Macromedia has a restrictive license; the viewer
software does not appear to have anything nearly as restrictive, and the
format itself is, AFAIK, open.</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
As I pointed out earlier, there <strong>is</strong> software that can be used
to view flash that is free as in libre---in fact I viewed the HelpDex
stuff using swfplayer.</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
There's also FOSS software that can be used to create it - which, as far
as I'm concerned, ties down both ends of this equation.</p>
<p><strong>[Kapil]</strong>
The only reason for leaving out PNG in the past would have been that
there were still some browser/OS combinations out there that did not
support it. Does that problem still persist?</p>
<p><strong>[Ben]</strong>
Not as far as I'm aware. That problem is way in the past, AFAIK.</p>
<p><strong>[Sluggo]</strong>
OK, I just saw the cartoons, and the January ones.  I guess I totally
missed the January issue.  It came out right when I got sick and I
couldn't do much for a few days except sleep and try to get over my
headache, plus I had a persistent cough which is still going on.  And
I got three weeks behind on my list mail and still haven't caught up. 
So I forgot about the January issue completely.  Otherwise I would
have remembered the cartoons coz I always look forward to them.</p>
