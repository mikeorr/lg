<h1>Document Processing with groff and mom</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/schaffter.html">Peter Schaffter</A></b></p>

<p>
<h2>Document Processing with groff and mom</h2>

<p>I see a schoolmarm at a blackboard scrawling out the title of
this article with squeaky chalk. A murmur rises from the desks
behind her.</p>

<p>Billy, the Linux ultra-newbie:<br>
<em>Document processing? Is that anything like word processing?</em></p>

<p>Suzie, the relative newbie:<br>
<em>"groff"? Isn't that the program that lets me read
manpages?</em></p>

<p>Todd, the old hand:<br>
<em><strong>mom</strong>? Never heard of it.</em></p>

<p>Okay, class--quiet down. One question at a time.</p>

<h3>Document Processing</h3>

<p><em>No, Billy, word processing and document processing aren't
the same.</em></p>

<p>When you use a modern word processor, the computer monitor shows
you a persistent representation of what you're writing in its final
printed form. Whenever you want to change a font, or increase the
size of type, or tighten a line, you typically highlight a portion
of text, point your mouse at a menu item, select the kind of
operation to perform, then specify the change from yet another
menu. The alteration is immediately visible.</p>

<p>Text processing differs from word processing in that when you
write, you fire up a text editor, a program that provides powerful
tools for editing text itself--tools well beyond the scope of word
processors--but does not show you a representation of the printed
document. Formatting and typesetting are achieved not by point-and-click,
but by embedding written commands in the text. When you finish writing, you
preview the document with a small program (like gv, or ghostview) whose
sole function is to show you what the printed version looks like.</p>

<h3>groff</h3>

<p><em>Very good, Suzie, groff is the program that lets you read
manpages. But it does much more than that.</em></p>

<p>For many Linuxers--programmers and end-users--groff begins and
ends with manpages. It comes as a surprise, then, to discover that
groff is actually a powerful formatting and typesetting engine
capable of producing PostScript, TeX DVI and html output in
addition to formatted terminal copy (i.e., manpages).</p>

<p>Groff has a very long history, dating back to the earliest days
of Unix. By comparison, TeX--the other big player in Linux document
processing--is a relative newcomer. TeX and groff are both
monumental achievements, with considerable overlap in what they do,
but they have a major difference: size. Even a minimal installation
of TeX is huge in comparison to groff.</p>

<p>Many people put up with TeX's size because they mistakenly
believe that TeX produces typesetting of a quality superior to
groff. While that may have been true once, it is simply not the
case now, and hasn't been for some time. As a typesetting engine,
groff is superb.</p>

<p>Groff does have a liability, though: it's incredibly geeky.
Owing to its long history, it--and its power users--seem stuck in a
time warp. Groff's classical macro sets (macro sets are the
end-user's primary interface to groff) still look as they did in
those decades when memory was exorbitantly expensive, and every
byte mattered. Their terse, two-letter commands tend to scare
people off, as does the amount of knowledge about groff itself
required to use them effectively.</p>

<p>That's where <em><strong>mom</strong></em> comes in.</p>

<h3>mom</h3>

<p><em>Gee, Todd, what version of groff are you running? Have you
actually checked</em> <kbd>man groff_tmac</kbd>
<em>recently?</em></p>

<p>To be fair to Todd, <em><strong>mom</strong></em> is the new kid on the block. She's only
been around for about two years--the first major new macro set to
come down the pike in quite some time.</p>

<p><em><strong>mom</strong></em>'s mandate is simple: to put typesetting and document
processing with groff within easy reach of everyone, old hands and
newbies alike. "Easy" has been accomplished -<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>by creating macros with sane, legible and informative names;
<kbd>.PP</kbd> starts a paragraph, <kbd>.FOOTNOTE</kbd> starts a
footnote, <kbd>.LIST</kbd> starts an enumerated list</li>

<li>by moving many of groff's flexible and powerful typesetting
commands into macro space; gone the need to read groff's
documentation in order to manage page dimensions, margins, indents,
tabs, line kerning, word spacing, hyphenation, artificial fonts,
and so on</li>

<li>by providing superb, text-only HTML documentation that's loaded
with examples and cross-referenced with hundreds of links; with an
HTML browser open in one window and a text editor in another, you
should be up and running with <em><strong>mom</strong></em> in no time</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tutorial--creating a document with <em><strong>mom</strong></em></h3>

<p><em><strong>mom</strong></em> is actually two groff macro sets in one. For the
typographer, she provides a suite of tools modeled on the commands
used by "dedicated" phototypesetting machines. For the writer, she
provides document processing "tags" that automatically generate
beautifully formatted heads, subheads, paragraphs, cited matter,
footnotes, endnotes, tables of contents, and much more. In this
tutorial, we'll be setting up a university essay, so the emphasis
is on document processing, not typesetting.</p>

<p>First of all, the "rules":<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li>all macros must appear on a line by themselves</li>

<li>all macros begin with a period, with no spaces before the
period</li>

<li>all macros must be typed in upper case</li>

<li>all macros that take text as an argument should have their
argument(s) surrounded by double-quotes</li>
</ul>

<p>You begin a <em><strong>mom</strong></em> document by entering some reference information:
title, subtitle, author(s) and so on. <em><strong>mom</strong></em> uses this information to
create cover pages (if you want them), set document titles and
generate page headers or footers.</p>

<pre>
.TITLE    "Stretched to the Breaking Point"
.SUBTITLE "Cadential Ambiguity in Wagner, Mahler and Strauss"
.AUTHOR   "Jane Dearborne"
</pre>

<p>Next, you tell <em><strong>mom</strong></em> what type of document you're creating,
whether this is a draft or a final copy, and whether you want the
document typeset or "typewritten."</p>

<pre>
.DOCTYPE    DEFAULT
.COPYSTYLE  FINAL
.PRINTSTYLE TYPESET
</pre>

<p><kbd>.DOCTYPE DEFAULT</kbd> and <kbd>.COPYSTYLE FINAL</kbd> are
optional (because they're <em><strong>mom</strong></em>'s defaults). However,
<kbd>.PRINTSTYLE TYPESET</kbd> is not. All <em><strong>mom</strong></em> documents that are
to be formatted with the document processing tags must contain a
<kbd>.PRINTSTYLE</kbd> directive.</p>

<p>Next, you initiate document processing with the single, required
macro</p>

<pre>
.START
</pre>

<p>Now you're on your way. Begin each paragraph with
<kbd>.PP</kbd>, on a line by itself, followed by the text of the
paragraph, like this:</p>

<pre>
.PP
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</pre>

<p>When you need a main head, type <kbd>.HEAD</kbd>, followed by
the text of the head, on the same line and surrounded by
double-quotes.</p>

<pre>
.HEAD "Wagner: Lohengrin to The Ring"
</pre>

<p>Subheads are accomplished similarly:</p>

<pre>
.SUBHEAD "The Pull Toward Flat Six"
</pre>

<p>If you need to insert a passage cited from another author's
work, simply surround the passage with the <kbd>.BLOCKQUOTE</kbd>
macro.</p>

<pre>
.BLOCKQUOTE
At vero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores...
.BLOCKQUOTE OFF
</pre>

<p>If you require footnotes, embed them in the body of the
document, like this:</p>

<pre>
In 1890, Alma\c
.FOOTNOTE
Mahler's wife; later married to Walter Gropius of Bauhaus fame,
then again to writer, Franz Werfel.
.FOOTNOTE OFF
is reported to have...
</pre>

<p>Note the use of <kbd>\c</kbd> in the first line, above.
Footnotes (and endnotes) require <kbd>\c</kbd> in order to attach
markers (asterisks, daggers, superscript numbers, etc.) to the ends
of words.</p>

<p>Carry on in this way until the end of the document, which, if
you use endnotes, is terminated by the single macro</p>

<pre>
.ENDNOTES
</pre>

<p><em><strong>mom</strong></em> is designed to produce PostScript output (for sending
directly to a printer or saving as a .ps file), and groff's default
"device" is PostScript, so you'd process the file, at the command
line, with</p>

<pre>
groff -mom -l &lt;filename&gt;

or

groff -mom &lt;filename&gt; | lpr
</pre>

to send the file to a printer, or 

<pre>
groff -mom &lt;filename&gt; &gt; &lt;filename&gt;.ps
</pre>

to save it to a file. Either way, you end up with a
professional-looking 8.5x11 inch document, typeset justified in
Times Roman at 12.5 on 16 (<em><strong>mom</strong></em>'s default). 

<p>What this little tutorial doesn't demonstrate is the degree of
control <em><strong>mom</strong></em> permits over the design of documents. All the document
processing tags have global "control" macros that allow you, at a
minimum, to change the family, font, point size and color of any
tag. Where appropriate, <em><strong>mom</strong></em> provides additional control macros for
things like quad direction, line spacing, underlining,
capitalization, indent, numbering style, and so on. Used in
conjunction with <em><strong>mom</strong></em>'s typesetting macros, the control macros let
you design virtually every part of a document to precise
specifications and taste.</p>

<h3>OK, I'm intrigued: How do I get my hands on <em>mom</em>?</h3>

<p><em><strong>mom</strong></em> has been part of <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/groff.html">groff</a> for the
past two years, so if you have a recent version of groff (1.18 or
later), you already have a <em><strong>mom</strong></em>. :-)</p>

<p>However, <em><strong>mom</strong></em> is being developed independently of groff, so
you'll probably want a more mature version than the one you got the
last time you updated groff.</p>

<p>There are two ways to get an up-to-date <em><strong>mom</strong></em>: either go directly
to 
<!-- <a href="http://www.ncf.ca/~df191/mom.html">mom's homepage</a> -->
<a href="http://home.golden.net/~ptpi/mom.html"><em><strong>mom</strong></em>'s homepage</a>
and download the latest release, or checkout the latest groff from
the groff CVS repository (instructions <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/groff.html">here</a>) and build
groff from source. Patches and improvements to <em><strong>mom</strong></em> are always
applied to the groff repository <em>before</em> a new release, so
either method gets you the latest version. At this time of writing,
that's 1.2. To check the version number of your current <em><strong>mom</strong></em>, do a
<kbd>locate</kbd> to find the macro file, om.tmac, then page
through it to line 26.</p>

<p>Please note that <em><strong>mom</strong></em> currently requires you be running, at the
very lowest, groff version 1.18, and for optimal use, groff version
1.19.2 or higher.</p>

<p> Peter Schaffter is a classical pianist, country songwriter and
professional typographer turned writer whose novel, The Schumann
Proof (pub. RendezVous Press, Canada), will be on the shelves in the
fall of 2004.

<p> An ardent champion of Free Software, he is also the creator of the
"mom" macro set for groff.  Mom is Peter's way of saying "thank you"
to the community of open source developers who made it possible,
despite his perpetually impoverished state, to get his hands on
some of the most powerful computing tools on the planet.  Mom also
reflects his interest in software documentation, a subject he
considers of primary importance in open source development.  In
a reversal of normal devlopment procedure, he wrote much of the
documentation for mom before implementing the code.  "A user's first
exposure to a program is usually the documentation," he says, "so
why not get it right first?  Besides, making a program conform to
pre-written docs is a great way to ensure it behaves as advertised."
