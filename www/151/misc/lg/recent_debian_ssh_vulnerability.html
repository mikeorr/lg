As those of you on staff are aware, we use SSH keyauth for our staff
accounts. I've been running some checks for weak keys (for any of you
that want to check your own,
<a href="http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz">http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz</a> is a

Especially if during all this mess the office OpenVPN server disappears
and a hurried check at the console reveils that only the core switch
failed and thus effectively prevented all brute force attacks. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
Failing switches can be a big benefit provided they fail at the correct

Indeed. I already met a director of a local company who has coffee for
the employees in the yearly budget plan. Some even include that in the

I'm sure being absolutely wide-awake at the time helped.
</p>

<p>
There's been a great deal of traffic about various weak-key detection
scripts, which I haven't followed fully, but I know that at least one of
them is due to be backfilled with weak-key sets from 64-bit OpenSSL and
big-endian versions.  So, checking for revisions might be worthwhile.

...and also versions for longer-than-usual key lengths.  (Imagine the
irony of an easily brute-forced key escaping detection because its key
length was greater than the checking script's author anticipated.)

Yes, that's quite a blame-game parade, isn't it?  One of the background
facts that tends to get lost in even the best coverage of this matter is
that OpenSSL itself remains hopeless spaghetti code.  This isn't the
fault of current OpenSSL maintainers like Ben Laurie (whose blog you
linked to):  It was mostly original coder Eric A. Young[1] and the fact
that it was done in early days, when we still had many important,
security-sensitive codebases from academic computing that -- well --
were inspiring and useful first efforts from talented people, but were
badly designed for long-term use and really needed to be thrown out and
rewritten properly:  BIND8, sendmail, lpr.
</p>

<p>
The job of maintaining OpenSSL, like that of maintaining the other named
codebases, has been a heroic but thankless task of plugging endless
holes, and was an accident waiting to happen.  So, it happened.  Mr.
Laurie's opinion notwithstanding, given decent communication, vendor
maintenance <em>should</em> be a major asset to his team, especially needed as
disasterously buggy OpenSSL releases have been emerging from <em>upstream</em>
for many years.  (Note that not only did many of the historical worms
aimed at Linux systems include attacks against vulnerable OpenSSL
version; I think -most- of them did.)
</p>

<p>
As pointed out in the blog comments, deliberately using initialised
memory is clever but misleading; a proper comment code clarifying that
the practice is intentional would have done a world of good.  This point
was also raised by Jon Corbet in LWN.net:
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/282038/">http://lwn.net/Articles/282038/</a> (subscriber-only until this Thursday)
</p>


<p>
[1] OpenSSL's original name was "SSLeay", incorporating Young's initials.
My guess is that he was then a talented and energetic young cryptographer.
The codebase was a major feather in his cap and worthy of respect.  At
the same time, it really has always begged to be junked and done over.
Maybe the current fiasco will inspire closer consideration of GNUTLS as
an alternative -- or hasten the day OpenSSL's developers make the hard
choice of doing a ground-up rewrite, as Paul Vixie did with BIND9.

Yeah, it's a big {b,f,}lamefest. Damn silly - I wince every time I see
this happen in the FOSS community - but (I'm coming to believe)
inevitable, or nearly so. Perhaps it's because a lot of what happens in
the community is based on an intangible - reputation - and because many
people have a skewed view of what 'reputation' really means. For me, "I
write flawless software" is a groundless boast that's just ripe for a
knockdown - whereas "I'm highly responsive to reported bugs, and fix
them ASAP" is a hell of a reputation enhancer. But that's just me.

</pre>

<p>
There seems to be an interesting dynamic in this arena, somewhat
parallel to Larry Wall's take on programmer laziness: a sufficient
amount of anger and frustration to just throw out the old piece of crap
and write the Perfect New Thing (which will eventually become an old
piece of crap; lather, rinse, repeat...) But to get there, you need to
have people wrestling with the old piece of crap for a sufficient amount
of time to gain a perfect understanding of just exactly how wretched it
is - or, more precisely, to learn the lessons that will let them learn
how to write the Perfect New Thing.
</p>

<p>
A lot of people tend to see this process as some sort of a gigantic
struggle for reputation and fame and fortune, with /sturm und drang/ at
every turn and enemies at every gate. I just call it "learning". <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

I noticed when first encountering its build system and trying to
understand where to put the compiler flags. I also took a look at the
patched piece of code and the lack of comments. I think a lot of other
libraries might have their time bombs set, too. Code review is a nice
thing, but someone has to do it instead of just mentioning it.
</p>

<p>
At the Linuxwochen in Vienna I talked with someone from cacert.org.
Apart from the code base there is another problem. Few, if any, CAs have
a proper quality management for key and certificate creation. cacert.org
has some ideas and I hope to read about them soon.
<a href="http://hashserver.cacert.org/">http://hashserver.cacert.org/</a> is a start, but we need checks like this
also when there's no bug around.

</pre>

<p>
Bruce Schneier in <em>Beyond Fear</em> has an entire chapter devoted to
debunking the commercial CAs' implication that they properly vet
identities.  It's the only chapter written in a noticeably irate,
outraged spirit; one gets the impression that he's essentially accusing
them of massive fraud, charging outrageous sums for services they do not
in fact provide, and creating a false sense of protection.
</p>

<p>
Especially in that light, I respect CAcert's attempt at doing a better
job without commercial backing, though I'm lastingly doubtful about
putting much trust in at least some of the things they issue.  E.g., I
haven't bothered to get my Web site https/SSL certificate signed by
CAcert's robot certificate authority
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_certificate_authority">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_certificate_authority</a>), because the
certification thus achieved is weak and not very meaningful
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAcert">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAcert</a>).
</p>

<p>
But, regardless of my misgivings, I do strongly respect them for making
the effort.

&gt; <a href="http://hashserver.cacert.org/">http://hashserver.cacert.org/</a> is a start, but we need checks like this
&gt; also when there's no bug around.

Bravo to CAcert, for that service!

&gt; memory is clever but misleading; a proper comment code clarifying that
&gt; the practice is intentional would have done a world of good.  This point
