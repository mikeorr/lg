Hi,
   Good article.
   I have a problem which I hope you can help me with.
</p>

<pre>
   Env:
   Nomachine Nxclient for Windows 3.3.0-6
   CENTOS 4.7 i686 on standard
   nx-3.2.0-8.el4.centos.i386.rpm
   freenx-0.7.3-1.el4.centos.i386.rpm
</pre>

<p>
   If I login remotely as root the gnome desktop is displayed OK
   but login as another user the !M splash screen is displayed
   and then closes with no gnome desktop.
</p>

<p>
   How can I verify that gnome is 'enabled' for the user?
</p>

<p>
   Thanks
</p>

<p>

I'm not all that familiar with Nomachine/NXclient, but I recall a
similar problem with X that commonly came up. It used to happen because
the user would have their ~/.xinitrc or ~/.xsession file set up in such
a way that all the processes started from there terminated. I.e.:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
xterm -bg yellow -fg red &amp;		# Launch an xterm and background it
Xcal &amp;							# Launch a calendar and background it
twm &amp;							# Launch the window manager - and OOOPS!
</pre>

<p>
Since the execution of this file stops at this point - all the processes
are backgrounded, so this child process can terminate - X now has
nothing to "hold it open", and exits immediately.
</p>

<p>
The point here is that the last invocation, the WM, should not have been
backgrounded; in fact, it should have been executed as 'exec twm', which
would replace the child shell in which the session file was being
executed. Then, when the user quit the WM, you'd exit the only thing
that was holding the X session open.
</p>

<p>
No guarantees, but this may be what's happening for you. Check both of
the files I've mentioned above carefully.
