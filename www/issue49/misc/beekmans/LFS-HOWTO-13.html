<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1 Installing Netkit-base</A>
 </H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unpack the Netkit-base archive</LI>
<LI>Configure the package by running <CODE>configure</CODE></LI>
<LI>Compile the package by running <CODE>make</CODE></LI>
<LI>Install the package by running <CODE>make install</CODE></LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss13.2">13.2 Installing Net-tools</A>
 </H2>

<P>

<LI>Install the package by running <CODE>make install</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H3>Creating the /etc/init.d/localnet bootscript </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Create a new file <CODE>/etc/init.d/localnet</CODE> containing the following:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
# Begin /etc/init.d/localnet
 
check_status()
{
  if [ $? = 0 ]
  then
    echo "OK"
  else
    echo "FAILED"
  fi
}
 
echo -n "Setting up loopback device..."
/sbin/ifconfig lo 127.0.0.1
check_status
 
echo -n "Setting up hostname..."
/bin/hostname --file /etc/hostname
check_status
 
# End /etc/init.d/localnet
 
</PRE>
<H3>Setting up permissions and symlink </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Set the proper permissions by running <CODE>chmod 755 /etc/init.d/localnet</CODE></LI>
<LI>Create the proper symlinks by running <CODE>cd /etc/rcS.d; ln -s ../init.d/network
S03localnet</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H3>Creating the /etc/hostname file </H3>

<P>Create a new file <CODE>/etc/hostname</CODE> and put the hostname in it. This is not
the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). This is the name you wish to call your
computer in a network.
<H3>Creating the /etc/hosts file </H3>

<P>If you want to configure a network card, you have to decide on the IP-address,
FQDN and possible aliases for use in the /etc/hosts file. An example is:
<P>
<PRE>
&lt;myip&gt; myhost.mydomain.org somealiases
 
</PRE>
<P>Make sure the IP-address is in the private network IP-address range. Below
a quoted paragraph from O'Reilly's book "Linux Network Administrator's Guide"
<P>--- Begin quote ---
<P>If your network is not connected to the Internet and won't be in the near
future, you are free to choose any legal network address. Just make sure no
packets from your internal network escape to the real Internet. To make sure
no harm is done, even when packets did escape, you should use one of the network
numbers reserved for private use. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)
has set aside several network numbers from classes A, B and C that you can
use without registering. These addresses are only valid within your private
network and are not routed between Internet sites.
<P>The numbers are:
<P>
<PRE>
Class Networks
A     10.0.0.0
B     172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0
C     192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.0
 
</PRE>
<P>--- End quote ---
<P>A valid IP address could be 192.168.1.1. A valid FQDN for this IP could
be me.lfs.org
<P>If you're not going to use a network card, you still need to come up with
a FQDN. This is necessary for programs like Sendmail to operate correctly (in
fact; Sendmail won't run when it can't determine the FQDN). 
<P>Here's the <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE> file if you don't configure a network card:
<P>
<PRE>
# Begin /etc/hosts (no network card version)
127.0.0.1 me.lfs.org &lt;contents of /etc/hostname&gt; localhost
# End /etc/hosts (no network card version)
 
</PRE>
<P>Here's the <CODE>/etc/hosts</CODE> file if you do configure a network card:
<P>
<PRE>
# Begin /etc/hosts (network card version)
127.0.0.1 localhost
192.168.1.1 me.lfs.org &lt;contents of /etc/hostname&gt;
# End /etc/hosts (network card version)
 
</PRE>
<P>Of course, change the 192.168.1.1 and me.lfs.org to your own liking (or
requirements if you are assigned an IP-address by a network/system administrator
and you plan on connecting this machine to that network).
<H3>Creating the /etc/init.d/ethnet file </H3>

<P>This sub section only applies if you are going to configure a network card.
If not, skip this sub section and read on.
<P>Create a new file <CODE>/etc/init.d/ethnet</CODE> containing the following:
<P>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
# Begin /etc/init.d/ethnet
 
check_status()
{
  if [ $? = 0 ]
  then
    echo "OK"
  else
    echo "FAILED"
  fi
}
 
/sbin/ifconfig eth0 &lt;ipaddress&gt;
check_status
 
# End /etc/init.d/ethnet
 
</PRE>
<H3>Setting up permissions and symlink for /etc/init.d/ethnet </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Set the proper permissions by running <CODE>chmod 755 ethnet</CODE></LI>
<LI>Create the proper symlinks by running <CODE>cd ../rc2.d; ln -s ../init.d/ethnet
S10ethnet</CODE></LI>
</UL>
<H3>Testing the network setup </H3>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Start the just created localnet script by running <CODE>/etc/init.d/localnet</CODE></LI>
<LI>Start the just created ethnet script if you have one by running <CODE>/etc/init.d/ethnet</CODE></LI>
<LI>Test if /etc/hosts is properly setup by running:</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<PRE>
ping &lt;your FQDN&gt;
ping &lt;what you choose for hostname&gt;
ping localhost
ping 127.0.0.1
ping 192.168.1.1 (only when you configured your network card)
 
</PRE>
<P>All these five ping command's should work without failures. If so, the
basic network is working.
