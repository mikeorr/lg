Quoting Dinesh Sikhwal (disikh at yahoo.com):
</p>


<pre>
&gt;    Dinesh S, 21
&gt;    Dinesh has added you as a friend on Tagged.
&gt;    Is Dinesh your friend?
</pre>

<p>
Functionally speaking, Dinesh is a spammer.

<p>
No, I really don't think so:  I'd rather just globally block all mail
at all of my MTAs from the entirety of "taggedmail.com".  
</p>

<p>
I'll also throw in "tagged.com" while I'm at it, as this "social networking" 
business appears to be more than usually pestilential.

</p>

<p>
   Tagged.com describe themselves as a "teen social networking
   destination on the web" but it is currently the largest source of email
   spam in our inbox.
</p>

<p>
   Every other minute, there's a new email message from Tagged.com with a
   subject "[Your Friend Name] has tagged you! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">".
</p>

<p>
   There's a link at the bottom of the email message that says "Click to
   unsubscribe" but even when you unsubscribe, "TaggedMail Invites" will
   continue to flood your inbox.
</p>

<p>
Goodbye, Dinesh.  Goodbye, Tagged.com.

Address-harvesting for use in subsequent commercial solicitation appears
to feature very heavily in this business (Tagged, Inc.).  Quoting the
Wikipedia article:
</p>

<p>
  When a user signs up for Tagged, they're practically forced to put
  in their webmail credentials. It then logs into your webmail account 
  as you, accesses your address book, and prompts you to email your 
  contacts using your webmail address as the reply-to.
</p>

<p>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged.com">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged.com</a>)
</p>

<p>
There are two supporting references from that article.  One is to 
<a href="http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/security_response/weblog/2007/04/spam_meets_web_20.html">http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/security_response/weblog/2007/04/spam_meets_web_20.html</a>
.  Representative quotation:
</p>

<p>
   It's difficult to recall all of the mass-mailing worms we've
   seen that have used similar strategies for propagation. Melissa and
   Lovebug would be good examples.
</p>

<p>
   Fortunately, Tagged isn't actually sending the emails as the user
   whose login credentials they've borrowed, the email is just coming
   from Tagged's server so it's not difficult to blacklist. But
   Tagged's signup process is sparse on the details about why they ask
   for the information they want, and what they're going to do with it.
   Clearly they've snagged all the email addresses in your address
   book, which would be useful for sending future advertising-based spam,
   but they've also taken your webmail login credentials and not really
   told you what they intend to do with it.
</p>

<p>
   It's interesting in that they've circumvented the need to
   mock-up your webmail site, but still had the effect of a phishing
   attack. With the search capabilities of most modern webmail services,
   and the amount of people doing online banking, it doesn't take a lot
   of imagination to see where this kind of site could head. Though
   we've all heard it before, the best way to avoid these situations is
   to avoid giving your credentials to third-party sites. Just like you
   wouldn't give your banking info to your mailman, you shouldn't
   give your banker a copy of your mailbox key. 
</p>

<p>
The other is to <a href="http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2112675,00.asp">http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2112675,00.asp</a> .
Excerpt:
</p>

<p>
   First, it's worth noting about the invitation e-mail that it's sent
   with a From: and Reply-To: header of the member's e-mail address, but
   it's actually sent through the tagged.com mail server. They use an
   envelope-from address of bounce at tagged.com so that they pass SPF
   (sender policy framework) tests (a good example of the useful limits
   of SPF). In most mail clients, the message ends up looking like it
   came from your friend, so you don't want to block the address.
</p>

<p>
   I set up two Gmail accounts specifically for the testing and a number
   of e-mail aliases on domains I own to be my "friends." I put these
   aliases in the address books of the Gmail accounts. Signing up for
   Tagged (which, I admit, I did under an assumed name), was easy enough,
   although I did quickly run into what Symantec describes. I was
   prompted for my Gmail credentials. They already knew my Gmail user
   name since I had provided it as an e-mail address. There is no option
   here but to provide a password:
 
   [Snip screenshot of the "Find your friends on Tagged!  Check your 
   Gmail address book" screen.]
</p>

<p>
   Before too long the addresses in my Gmail address book received
   invites like the one I received. I later figured out that you can
   provide an incorrect password here, and it lets you proceed.
   Incidentally, they have similar functionality for AOL Mail, Hotmail,
   Yahoo mail and MSN mail.
</p>

<p>
Article goes on to detail the misleading, labyrinthine, and extremely 
cheeky Terms of Service -- which, author Larry Seltzer points out, signs
over to Tagged, Inc. the right to harvest e-mail addresses from the 
victim^Wcustomer's address book and use it for any purpose.
</p>

<p>
Seltzer attempted to contact Tagged, Inc. to hear their side of the
story.  All of the means of contacting them he found were dead links.
He concludes:  "Why am I not surprised?"
</p>
