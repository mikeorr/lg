<P> I started using UNIX years ago at school, so when Linux came along I eagerly
installed it on my home computer so that I could have the same wonderful
operating system in both places.  Linux has worked amazingly well for me, but
after a while I noticed that it wasn't completely adapted for home use.
"locate"'s database wasn't getting updated, the log files kept growing and
growing, and the startups and shutdowns were taking a fair chunk out of my day.
This was because UNIX computers traditionally stay on all the time, while home
computers tend to be frequently turned off.

<P> None of my cron jobs, like updating locate's database and trimming the log
files, were being done since the computer was hardly ever on in the wee hours
of the morning, the time chosen by the distributions (Slackware, then Red Hat
3.0.3, then 5.1) for housecleaning.  Very early in the morning is perfect for
computers that stay on all the time, since that's when there are the fewest
users to be upset by the somewhat disruptive janitorial jobs, but I was
unwilling to leave my computer on all them time just to make cron happy.  I
ruled out changing the job running time to something during the day, since I
tend to run my home computer at unpredictable times for a few hours.  The only
way I could be sure the jobs would be done would be to run them hourly instead
of daily or weekly.  That would soon get annoying.  My solution, the following
script, was to combine an hourly cron with batch, and to check whether the job
had already been done satisfactorily recently.  The hourly cron is frequent
enough that it will probably get a chance while I have the computer on, but
batch minimizes my annoyance by only running the jobs when the computer isn't
too busy, like when I've gone for a snack.  The timestamp check cancels the job
if it's already been done in the last week/month/etc.

<P> As you probably know, speeding up the startups and shutdowns is a matter of
not starting daemons you'll never need.  I've taken it a bit further by often
not starting services that I often *do* need.  Craziness?  No.  We all use SysV
runlevels, now, right?  (When I started using Linux, with Slackware, this
wasn't the case, but I hope that even the most ardent BSDers have seen the
desirability of runlevels.)  I was using runlevel 3 as my normal operating
mode, had a never used runlevel 4, and noticed that about half the time in
booting 3 was spent on network things.  About half the time when I turn on my
computer, I'm not going to use my modem at all, so I set up runlevel 4 as "3
without network stuff".  Now when I want to use my modem I boot normally, but
if I know I won't be using it I type "linux 4" at the LILO prompt and save a
lot of time.  No reconfiguration of LILO was necessary.  I haven't needed to
yet, but I could use my modem in 4 by becoming root and running the network
starter scripts by hand, and stopping them when I'm done.  One of these days I
should write a script to automate that, but I'm lazy.  Red Hat provides a
runlevel editor in their control-panel, but it is also easy to do from the
command line by playing around in the /etc/rc.d/* directories.

<P> If you're not sure which services you can safely eliminate, here's a
listing of my /etc/rc.d/rc[34].d directories as a sample.  Your requirements
will probably be different, however.

<P> Another, very optional, thing you can do is run 'tune2fs' on your ext2
filesystems to increase the number of mounts before they get fscked.  Read the
man page first, and I have no idea what the ideal number is.
