<h2>News in General</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat Introduces DeltaCloud Project </h3>

<p>Redhat engineers have initiated the DeltaCloud project "To enable an
ecosystem of developers, tools, and applications which can interoperate
across the public and private clouds".</p>

<p>Currently, each Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud has a unique 
API that developers and ISVs write to in order to consume the cloud 
service. The DeltaCloud effort hopes to create a common, REST-based 
API which developers can write to once and manage anywhere and 
everywhere. This requires a middleware layer with drivers that map APIs 
to all public clouds like EC2, and private virtualized clouds based on 
VMWare and Red Hat Enterprise Linux with integrated KVM.
The long term goal is for the middleware API to be test driven 
with a self-service web console, which will be another part of the 
DeltaCloud effort. </p>

<p>Among its goals, DeltaCloud aims to give developers:</p>
<ul>
<li> a REST API (with any-platform access);<br />
<li> Support for EC2, RHEV-M; VMWare ESX, RackSpace coming soon;<br />
<li> Backward compatibility across versions, for long-term use of 
scripts, tools and applications. </ul>

<p>One level up, DeltaCloud Portal will provide a web UI in front of the 
DeltaCloud API to: </p>
<ul>
<li> View image status and stats across clouds, all in one place;<br />
<li> Migrate instances from one cloud to another;<br />
<li> Manage images locally and provision them on any cloud.</ul>

<p>DeltaCloud API and Portal are free and open source (LGPL, GPL). For 
more info, see:<a href=" http://deltacloud.org"> http://deltacloud.org</a>.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Re-affirms Sun and Solaris Commitment </h3>
<p>Oracle tried to reassure its new-found Sun customers by taking out an 
ad on the front page of the Wall Street Journal in mid-September.</p>

<p>The ad had 4 simple bullet-points addressed to Sun Customers, many of 
whom are in the financial sector of the economy, and a short quote 
from Larry Ellison saying he looked forward to competing with IBM. The 
bullets said the Oracle intends to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Spend more money developing SPARC than Sun does now;<br />
<li>Spend more money developing Solaris than Sun does now;<br />
<li>Save more than twice as many hardware specialists selling and 
servicing Sparc/Solaris systems than Sun does now;<br />
<li>Dramatically improve Sun's hardware performance by tightly 
integrating Oracle software with Sun hardware</ol>

<p>Oracle made good on the last point when it announced its improved 
Exadata V2 DB machine. (See article below.) The ad did not mention 
Java or the MySQL database, both of which Oracle now owns.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Unveils Hefty Exadata Version 2 - on Sun Hardware</h3>
<p>The OLTP Database Machine was unveiled in September by Oracle 
Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison and Sun Executive Vice 
President John Fowler. The Exadata Database Machine Version 2, made by 
Sun and Oracle, is said to be the world's fastest machine for both data 
warehousing and online transaction processing (OLTP).</p>

<p>Built using industry standard hardware components plus FlashFire 
technology from Sun, Oracle Database 11g Release 2 and Oracle Exadata 
Storage Server Software Release 11.2, the Sun Oracle Database Machine 
V2 is twice as fast as Version 1 for data warehousing. The Sun Oracle 
Database Machine goes beyond data warehousing applications with the 
addition of the huge Exadata Smart Flash Cache based on Sun FlashFire 
technology to deliver extreme performance and scalability for OLTP.</p>

<p>Bottom line: with the Sun Oracle Database Machine, customers can store 
more than 10x the amount of data and search data more than 10x faster 
without any changes to applications.</p>

<p>"Exadata Version 1 was the world's fastest machine for data warehousing
applications," said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, with characteristically
limited modesty. "Exadata Version 2 is twice as fast as Exadata V1 for data
warehousing, and it's the only database machine that runs OLTP
applications. Exadata V2 runs virtually all database applications much
faster and less expensively than any other computer in the world." Ellison
compared ExaData 2 to Teradata systems and high-end IBM 595 Power RISC
machines. "IBM has nothing like this," Ellison said after noting that only
IBM mirrors disks while Exadata 2 is fully fault tolerant with redundant
hardware.</p>

<p>Ellison also noted the modular ExaData 2 can be installed and 
ready in a single day. "It will be working by evening ... just load 
and run," Ellison said.</p>

<p>Better Hardware Specs from Sun: </p>
<ul>
<li> Sun' FlashFire memory cards enable high performance OLTP;<br />
<li> 80% Faster CPUs -Intel Xeon 5500 Nehalem processors;<br />
<li> 50% Faster Disks -600 GB SAS Disks at 6 Gigabits/second;<br />
<li> 200% Faster Memory -DDR3 memory;<br />
<li> 25% More Memory -72 Gigabytes per database server;<br />
<li> 100% Faster Networking -40 Gigabits/second on InfiniBand;<br />
<li> Raw disk capacity of 100 TB (SAS) or 336 TB (SATA) per rack;</ul>
<p>Software Optimization from Oracle:</p>
<ul>
<li> Hybrid columnar compression for 10-50 times data compression;<br />
<li> Scans on compressed data for even faster query execution;<br />
<li> Storage Indexes to further reduce disk I/Os;<br />
<li> Offloading of query processing to storage controllers using Smart 
Scans;<br />
<li> Applications running on the Sun Oracle Database Machine achieve up 
to 1 Million I/O operations per second with Flash Storage. </ul>

<p>Exadata Version 2 is available in four models: full rack (8 database 
servers and 14 storage servers), half-rack (4 database servers and 7 
storage servers), quarter-rack (2 database servers and 3 storage 
servers) and a basic system (1 database server and 1 storage server). 
All four Exadata configurations are available immediately.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">ARM Announces 2GHz Cortex-A9 Dual Core Processor Designs </h3>
<p>Gunning to displace Intel's netbook-dominant "Atom" processor, ARM 
announced development of dual Cortex-A9 MPCore hard macro 
implementations for the 40nm-G process developed with its partner, 
TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.). Silicon manufacturers 
now have a rapid route to silicon for high-performance, low-power 
Cortex-A9 processor-based devices. The speed-optimized hard macro 
implementation will enable devices to operate at frequencies greater 
than 2GHz with a power efficiency up to 8x greater than Intel's 
current Atom offerings. </p>

<p>The dual core hard macro implementations use advanced techniques to 
increase performance while lowering overall power consumption. Running 
at 2-GHz, the Cortex-A9 delivers about 10,000 MIPS with a power demand 
of about 2 watts. The low power design runs at 800 Mhz, consumes a 
half watt of power and delivers 4000 MIPS. 
In many thermally-constrained applications such as set-top boxes, 
DTVs, printers and netbooks, energy efficiency is of paramount 
importance. The Cortex-A9 can deliver a peak performance of 4000 DMIPS 
while consuming less than 250mW per CPU core.
ARM announced it was developing quad-core and eight-core Cortex-A9 
processor designs. In separate news, ARM also joined the Linux 
Foundation in September. 
The Cortex-A9 speed-optimized and power-optimized implementations are 
available for license now with delivery in the fourth quarter of 2009. 
ARM' 40G physical IP platform is also available at

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Linpus' Launches Linpus Linux Lite 1.2 at OSIM World </h3>
<p>At OSIM World in mid-September, Linpus Technologies, Inc. released its 
new version of Linpus Linux Lite, its flagship netbook and nettop 
product aimed to improve a user' online experience.</p>
<p>This new version of Linpus Linux Lite, through its LiveDesktop 
application, improves the user experience by gathering important 
information in one place. LiveDesktop has six modules with thumbnail 
and text summaries, and an option for large previews. The social 
networking module allows access into Twitter, Flickr, Myspace and 
LastFM accounts. There are two modules for email - one for desktop 
mail and one that delivers mail from Web mail accounts. Additionally, 
there are modules for most recent websites and opened files -and a 
module for favorite programs or shortcuts.</p>
<p>LiveDesktop has also been designed so that each module has an extra 3 
or 4 objects, found by tapping the arrow at the side, meaning you can 
for example, actually quickly see six recent Web sites rather than just 
three.</p>
<p>Linpus Linux Lite also has a number of key improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li> Clutter graphic technology is used throughout to improve look and 
feel;<br />
<li> A network manager with support for 3G, WLAN, and LAN connectivity;<br />
<li> A power manager with auto-suspend support;<br />
<li> Dual booting enhancements and decreased boot-time to 3 seconds.</ul>

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Oracle Enhances VM Template Builder, Oracle Enterprise Linux JeOS </h3>
<p>In August, Oracle announced Oracle VM Template Builder, an open 
source graphical utility that makes it easy to use Oracle Enterprise 
Linux "Just enough OS" (JeOS) and scripts for developing pre-packaged 
virtual machines for Oracle VM.</p>

<p>Oracle VM Template Builder uses "JeOS" to facilitate building an 
operating system instance with only the absolute minimum packages 
needed for an Oracle VM Template, helping to reduce the disk footprint 
by up to 2GB per guest virtual machine and to improve security and 
reliability. </p>

<p>Oracle Enterprise Linux JeOS is backed by 24x7, enterprise-class 
support and has been tailored specifically to facilitate the creation 
of Oracle VM Templates for production enterprise use.</p>

<p>Oracle VM Templates are virtual machines with pre-installed and 
pre-configured enterprise software that can be used by ISVs or 
end-users to package and distribute their applications. Oracle VM 
Templates simplify application deployments, reduce end-user costs and 
can make ISV software distribution more profitable.</p>

<p>This also allows end-users and ISVs the option to develop their Oracle 
VM Templates by using JeOS-based scripts directly or via the 
graphical Oracle VM Template Builder.</p>

<p>The graphical Oracle VM Template Builder utility is based on the core 
technology of Oracle's small footprint Oracle Enterprise Linux JeOS 
operating system image that is designed specifically for Oracle VM 
Template creation and build-process integration. Oracle offers this 
combination of enterprise class operating system and virtualization 
software for free download and free distribution. (O-VM is based on 
Xen virtualization technology.)</p>

<p>Oracle VM supports both Oracle and non-Oracle applications. Oracle 
VM Templates are available today for Oracle' Siebel CRM, Oracle 
Database, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Fusion Middleware, and 
more. See a complete list of templates at: 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/vm/templates/index.html"></a>. </p>
<p>Oracle VM Template Builder is distributed as software packages via the 
Oracle Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN) and Oracle Technology Network. </p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Toshiba Links vPRO Technology With TCG Self-Encrypting Drives </h3>

<p>Toshiba's Storage Device Division (SDD), a division of Toshiba America 
Information Systems, Inc., showcased its Trusted Computing Group 
(TCG) Opal-compliant Self Encrypting Drives (SEDs) in a demonstration 
of secure access using the Intel's vPro technology during the Intel 
Developer Forum (IDF) in San Francisco during September. 
As corporate governance requirements, government regulations and other 
industry mandates for stronger data protection increase, TCG 
Opal-compliant SEDs will become an increasingly important component in 
the data protection equation. Unlike earlier SED offerings, TCG 
Opal-compliant SEDs provide standards-based protocols to facilitate 
widespread adoption by disk drive vendors, security management 
software providers, system integrators and security-conscious end 
users.</p>

<p>The IDF demonstration was the first time SEDs were paired with Intel 
vPro technology to securely deliver down-the-wire access 
authentication. Management console applications can use Intel vPro 
technology to securely authenticate and access TCG Opal-compliant SEDs 
on remote PCs, even if the computer is powered off. This capability 
allows remote perform software updates, security audits and 
maintenance tasks in an enterprise domain.</p>

<p>SEDs greatly enhance the data security on any PC, especially laptops,
which are at greater risk of being lost or stolen. The TCG
Opal-specification provides a framework for delivering centrally managed
encryption solutions. TCG Opal-compliant SEDS offer the benefits of
stronger security through industry standardization of security protocols on
the hard drive, providing easier use and lower cost of ownership with
decreased management complexity.  Should a PC be lost or stolen, an IT
administrator can take action to remotely disable the PC and instantly
erase the encrypted data and applications on the SED, through Intel
Anti-Theft Technology, which is available on some Intel vPro
technology-enabled notebooks. Intel vPro technology enhances the
manageability of PCs equipped with Opal-compliant SEDs by providing the
mechanism through which IT administrators can authenticate and remotely
access the unattended PC.</p>

<p>Software updates and other administrative tasks can then be performed 
from virtually anywhere in the world, using a secure out-of-band 
communications channel to access and manage PCs that incorporate TCG 
Opal-compliant SEDs.</p>

<p>Toshiba plans to commercially introduce TCG Opal-compliant SEDs in 
2010. For more information on Toshiba' line of mobile HDDs, please

multiple related development groups."</p>

<p>New to ScrumWorks Pro 4:</p>

<ul><li> Program Management. Coordinate multiple related development groups 
with cross-cutting releases and feature goals. Track through to 
completion with high-level roll-ups of progress in a single cohesive 
interface.<br />

<li> High-level Feature Decomposition with Epics.<br />
 Epics are the stated 
high-level features or goals associated with any milestone. Define 
Epics and track progress at the project or program level.<br />

<li> Release Planning View.<br />
The release planner view provides a focused, 
high-level perspective of a release milestone. User stories are 
grouped by Epics and progress is front-and-center with embedded 
roll-up reports.<br />

<li> Flexible Modeling of Development Organizations.<br />
 New Program 
capabilities in release 4 are flexible enough to accommodate and model 
complex structures such as shared component projects, where a single 
project group supplies core components to multiple end-products.<br />

<li> Enterprise Reporting.<br />
 Track feature and release milestone progress 
across multiple products. Forecast completion and compare progress of 
contributing products in a Program release. Monitor the scope of 
features at the program level along with progress breakdown.</ul>

<p>"ScrumWorks Pro has always been driven by customer feedback," said 
Szalvay. "For large-scale Scrum deployments, release 4 will help 
coordinate multiple related product backlogs, all of which can work 
toward common release dates and feature goals."</p>

<p>ScrumWorks Pro 4 is currently available and can be purchased directly 
from Danube. Pricing is offered through an on-site, per-seat 
subscription license that starts at $289 per-user, per-year, or less 
than $25 per-user, per-month, as well as an on-site, per-seat fully 
paid license for $500. For more information on ScrumWorks Pro, visit
