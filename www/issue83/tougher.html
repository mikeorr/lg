<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>
I use the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">
Apache HTTP Server</a> to run my
<a href="http://www.robtougher.com">web site</a>. 
When a visitor requests a page from the site, Apache
records the following information in a file named "access_log":
</p>

<ul>
<li>The IP address of the computer requesting the page
<li>The name of the page being requested
<li>The date and time of the request
<li>The page that referred the visitor to the requested page
</ul>


<p>
Until recently I used a combination of command line utilities 
(grep, tail, sort, wc, less, awk) to extract
this information from the access log. 
But some complex calculations were difficult and time-consuming
to perform using these tools. 
I needed a more powerful solution - 
a programming language to crunch the data.
</p>

<p>
Enter <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>. Python is
fast becoming my favorite language, and was the perfect tool
for solving this problem. I created a framework in Python for 
performing generic text file analysis, and then utilized
this framework to glean information from my Apache access log.
</p>

<p>
This article first explains the framework, and 
then describes two examples that use it. My hope
is that by the end of this article you will be able
to use this framework for analyzing your own text files.
</p>

<a name=2></a>
<h3>2. The Framework</h3>

<a name=2.1></a>
<h4>2.1 First pass - Awk attempt</h4>

<p>
When trying to solve this problem I initially turned to 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html">Gawk</a>, 
an implementation of the Awk language. Awk is primarily used
to search text files for certain pieces of data. The following is 
a basic Awk script:
</p>



<p>Listing 1: 
<a href="misc/tougher/count_lines.awk.txt">count_lines.awk</a></p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/awk -f

BEGIN {
	count = 0
}

{ count++ }

END {
	print count
}
</pre>


<p>
This script prints the number of lines in a file. You can
run it by typing the following at a command prompt:
</p>

<pre>
prompt$ ./count_lines.awk access_log
</pre>

<p>
Awk reads in the script, and does the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Runs the code in the BEGIN block.
<li>Runs the middle block of code for each line in "access_log".
<li>Runs the code in the END block.
</ul>

<p>
I liked this processing model. It made sense to me - 
first run some initialization code, 
next process the file line by line, 
and finally run some cleanup code. It seemed perfectly
suited to the task of analyzing text files.
</p>

<p>
Awk gave me trouble, though. It was very difficult to create
complex data structures - I was jumping through hoops for
tasks that should have been much more straightforward. 
So after some time I started looking for an alternative.
</p>

<a name=2.2></a>
<h4>2.2 Next pass - Python to the rescue</h4>

<p>
My situation was this: I liked the Awk processing model, 
but I didn't like the language itself. And I liked Python, but 
it didn't have Awk's processing model. So I decided
to combine the two, and came up with the current framework.
</p>

<p>
The framework resides in 
<a href="misc/tougher/awk.py.txt">awk.py</a>.
This module contains one class, <code>controller</code>, which
implements the following methods:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>__init__(file)</code> - the constructor, which takes a 
file object to process.
<li><code>subscribe(handler)</code> - subscribes a handler to the controller.
<li><code>run()</code> - processes the file.
<li><code>print_results()</code> - prints the results of the process.
</ul>


<p>
A <i>handler</i> is a class that implements a defined set 
of methods. Multiple handlers 
can be subscribed to the controller at any given time. Every
handler must implement the following methods:
</p>


<ul>
<li><code>begin()</code> - gets called once before the file is processed.
<li><code>process_line(line)</code> - gets called for each line of the file.
<li><code>end()</code> - gets called after the file is processed.
<li><code>description()</code> - gets called from 
<code>controller.print_results()</code>. It should
return a description of the handler.
<li><code>result()</code> - also called from 
<code>controller.print_results()</code>. 
It should return the results of the class' calculations.
</ul>


<p>
You create handlers, subscribe them to the controller, and then
run the controller. The following is a simple example with one handler:
</p>



<p>Listing 2: <a href="misc/tougher/count_lines.py.txt">count_lines.py</a></p>
<pre>
# Standard sys module
import sys

# Custom awk.py module
import awk

class count_lines:

	def begin(self):
		self.m_count = 0

	def process_line(self, s):
		self.m_count += 1

	def end(self):
		pass

	def description(self):
		return "# of lines in the file"

	def result(self):
		return self.m_count


#
# Step 1: Create the Awk controller
#
ac = awk.controller(sys.stdin)

#
# Step 2: Subscribe the handler
#
ac.subscribe(count_lines())

#
# Step 3: Run
#
ac.run()

#
# Step 4: Print the results
#
ac.print_results()
</pre>



<p>
You can run this script using the following command:
</p>

<pre>
prompt$ cat access_log | python count_lines.py
</pre>

<p>
The results of the script should be printed to the console.
</p>

<h3>3. Example Handlers</h3>

<p>
Now that the framework was in place, I had to figure
out how I was going to use it. I came up with many ideas, but
the following two were the top priorities.
</p>

<a name=3.1></a>
<h4>3.1 Return visitors</h4>

<p>
The first question that I wanted to answer using my new framework
was the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>How many people have returned to the site more than N times?</i>
</ul>


<p>
My thinking was this: if people return often, they must enjoy
the site, right? The following script answers the
above question:
</p>


<p>
Listing 3: return_visitors (can be found in 
<a href="misc/tougher/handlers.py.txt">handlers.py</a>)
</p>

<pre>
class return_visitors:

	def __init__(self, n):
		self.m_n = n
		self.m_ip_days = {}

	def begin(self):
	    pass

	def process_line(self, s):

		try:
			array = s.split()
			ip = array[0]
			day = array[3][1:7]

			if self.m_ip_days.has_key(ip):

				if day not in self.m_ip_days[ip]:
					self.m_ip_days[ip].append(day)

			else:
				self.m_ip_days[ip] = []
				self.m_ip_days[ip].append(day)

		except IndexError:
			pass



	def end(self):

		ips = self.m_ip_days.keys()
		count = 0

		for ip in ips:

			if len(self.m_ip_days[ip]) > self.m_n:
				count += 1

		self.m_count = count


	def description(self):
		return "# of IP addresses that visited more than %s days" % self.m_n

	def result(self):
		return self.m_count
</pre>


<p>
The script stores the number of days that each IP address has visited
the site. When the file is finished processing, it returns how
many IP addresses have visited more than N times.
</p>


<a name=3.2></a>
<h4>3.2 Referring domains</h4>

<p>
Another thing I wanted to know was how people found out about the
site. I was getting a decent amount of traffic, and I wasn't sure
why. I kept asking myself:
</p>


<ul>
<li><i>Where are all these people coming from?</i>
</ul>

<p>
I guess you shouldn't argue with a site that's popular. But
I was curious to know how people were learning about my site.
So I wrote the following script:
</p>


<p>Listing 4: referring_domains (can be found in 
<a href="misc/tougher/handlers.py.txt">handlers.py</a>)
</p>

<pre>
class referring_domains:

	def __init__(self):
		self.m_domains = {}

	def begin(self):
		pass

	def process_line(self, line):

		try:
			array = line.split()
			referrer = array[10]

			m = re.search('//[a-zA-Z0-9\-\.]*\.[a-zA-z]{2,3}/',
				      referrer)

			length = len(m.group(0))
			domain = m.group(0)[2:length-1]

			if self.m_domains.has_key(domain):
				self.m_domains[domain] += 1
			else:
				self.m_domains[domain] = 1

		except AttributeError:
			pass
		except IndexError:
			pass


	def end(self):
		pass


	def description(self):
		return "Referring domains"


	def sort(self, key1, key2):
		if self.m_domains[key1] > self.m_domains[key2]:
			return -1
		elif self.m_domains[key1] == self.m_domains[key2]:
			return 0
		else:
			return 1


	def result(self):

		s = ""
		keys = self.m_domains.keys()
		keys.sort(self.sort)

		for domain in keys:
			s += domain
			s += " "
			s += str(self.m_domains[domain])
			s += "\n"

		s += "\n\n"

		return s
</pre>


<p>
This script stores the referral information
for each request, and generates a list of
referring domains, sorted by frequency.
</p>

<p>
I ran the script and found that most of the referrals came from my own site.
This makes sense - when a visitor moves from one page to another on
the site, the referring domain for the page is my web site's
domain. But I did find some interesting entries in the referral
list, and my question about site traffic was answered.
</p>

<p>
In this article I described how I use Python to process my
Apache HTTP Server access log. Hopefully I explained my techniques
clearly enough so that you can use them for your text files.
