<P>
Hi.
</P>
<P>
Ben came up with the right fix to the "unresolved symbols in
<TT>/lib/modules/`uname</TT> -r`/foo.o" error; however, his reason is flawed.
</P>
<P>
If the distro kernel uses a module to enable foo and the rebuilt kernel
omits foo, or puts it inside the kernel, there is no place for depmod to
insert the kernel module and it'll complain about the unresolved
symbols.  (If the required module is not available, the error will be
something like "Device not found".  It's been several years since I
puzzled this one out, and I don't remember the specific error.)  The fix,
as Ben said, is to either rename or delete <TT>/lib/modules/`uname</TT> -r`/ before
running "make modules_install".  Or build a kernel of a different version,
but I don't think that's within the scope of the OP's question.
</P>
<P>

<BR>Question by James A. Hess (jah from ipsg.com)

<P><STRONG>
Ben, et al,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Thank you for continuing and resurrecting the Linux Gazette.  I clicked on
my old link to LG this morning and was depressed by what I saw.  The format
is terrible, the "articles" were of dubious quality and my favorite
features were missing.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Fortunately, it wasn't too hard to find you again.  Keep up the good work.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Thanks, James! We certainly plan on it; being able to create without
censorship and interference was one of our main motivations in making
this move. Good to see that you and many other folks recognize this move
as a positive one; we certainly think it is, and look forward to
bringing the best content we can produce to our readers.
</P>
<P>
Best wishes,
Ben Okopnik

<P>
A small suggestion from someone who has enjoyed your magazine for some
time.  In the page describing why you have moved to a new domain, not
everyone (including  me) will know what "CMS" means.
</P>
<P>
Take the editorial suggestion, or not.  Do accept my thanks for your
<BR>work in creating the magazine.
</P>
<P>
PS. I've been using Unix since '79 or so, including scanning most of the
source code to V6, installing Berkely 2.1 on a PDP 11/34, and thinking that
our new VAX 11/750 was a powerhouse.  To me CMS means "Cambridge Monitor
System", a terminal based front end to the IBM mainframes, and the only OS
I've used on a screen that was worse than using punch cards.

<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Good point.  Sometimes we underestimate the variety of backgrounds our
readers come from.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">CMS means "content management system".  Generically it means any
systematized workflow for producing and maintaining documents.  Every
system needs some way for the author to write the document and submit it,
and for the editorial staff to approve/deny it, make corrections, set
meta-information like the title and bio, publish it, and maintain it
after publication.  In that sense, Linux Gazette has always had a content
management system of some sort or another.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">However, in the context of web services, CMS means a certain kind of
software for handling the workflow, one that is web based.  That's what we
mean by "linuxgazette.com has a CMS".  Most CMS' in this sense handle at
least the editorial steps through the web via HTML forms.  Some also expose
this interface to the authors for the initial submission.  A few also allow
editing the article text through the web, although others handle this in the
traditional way (the staff puts the file directly in a certain directory
without using the web interface).  Since many <EM>LG</EM> articles have images and
supplemental files, the interface has to either handle these too, or else
get out of the way so the staff can install these manually.  Various CMS'
include Plone (a Zope system), PHP Nuke (Linux Journal uses a heavily
customized version of this), Drupal (used by Linux Ghoulzette, as we 
affectionately call that other zine -- well, it <EM>was</EM> Halloween when
they unveiled it) 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
, Slashcode (used by Slashdot), wikis,
blogging tools, etc.
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">Many people think <EM>Linux Gazette</EM> left linuxgazette.com because of the
CMS, but that's only partially true.  For me personally, the CMS was
only a minor problem - one that I feared the worst of, but that I was
willing to allow a good try.  The main reason I left was the lack of editorial
oversight, which was significantly affecting the quality of LG content.  Nobody
at SSC is giving the authors feedback to help them improve their content or to
generate article ideas.  Many authors had stopped contributing to LG because of
this, but indicated they would return to LG if it reverted to its traditional
self.  
</font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color="#001F3F">The arguments against a web CMS are that HTML forms are cumbersome and
inconvenient, you can't use your existing favorite software tools, it
would take a lot of work to graft in the features <EM>LG</EM> already enjoys, and
why fix something that ain't broke.  The "lot of work" part can be seen
at linuxgazette.com, where they are trying to integrate a text-friendly
format (for blind readers), an all-in-one-page format ("TWDT"), better author
attribution, a system for managing images, etc -- features we already
have had for years.  Most off-the-shelf CMS software does not have these
features, and grafting them in often requires kludging around the program's
design.

demonstrates some rather poor techniques for compilation. Firstly, LeeAnne
suggest that one compiles their programs as 'root' -- ERRM, bad idea.
Secondly the use of "-" as a prefix for tar's options is not needed and
can even lead to some ambiguity.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Any chance the author can be made aware of this?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
It was published by Jeff, and he didn't put her e-mail address on her
author page.  I don't know whether she asked him not to, or that was his
policy, or what.  But we don't have her address.  Maybe she'll see your

<P> As you can see, LG has a new look.  Rob Tougher responded to our
longstanding request for somebody to make a stylesheet for LG, and it looks
great!  He also helped me extensively to update the templates and Python
scripts that generate LG, to implement the new look.  

<P> We've tried hard to make it reasonable for both graphical and text
browsers.  Let us know if anything blows up or you have any suggestions.
The biggest problem we've seen is the menu being vertical instead of 
horizontal in Netscape 4.  If anybody is still using Netscaoe 4.

Also, if you know sites running Linux Gazette mirrors, please let their

<blockquote><font color="#000066">At the time this was drafted, Phil Hughes was still swearing off the

<BR>Question by Tom Brown (tfbrown from ceinetworks.com)

<P><STRONG>
Sorry for jumping the gun with my previous email. I realist now that
sending you an email wasn't the right procedure.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Oh, that's quite alright!  The small handful of us who edit LG are used
to people sometimes responding directly to articles;  I presume my name
was made fairly easy to pick up 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</P>
<P><STRONG>
After checking out the guidelines for answering questions, however, I'm
still at a loss. Mailing lists? (Don't hit. I told you I was a Linux
n00b.).
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Ok.  Here's how it works.  And TIA for the chance to clarify any points
in our "FAQ" documents that really do need clearing up;  after a while
it gets a little more fuzzy, and that make it hard for us to truly look
at them from a n00b's perspective.  A fresh set of eyes does help.
</P>
<P>
If you've got a question in the realm of Linux, maybe "The Answer Gang"
can answer it.  Even if one of them can't alone, they might be able to,
ahem, gang up on it.
</P>
<P>
Even rather new people might have tricks up their sleeve; anyone
interested in watching the ebb and flow of questions, and possibly
answering a few here and there, is invited to join the "tag" list -
effectively becoming a member of The Answer Gang, too.  It's all
volunteer, so if you can't answer anything, you're welcome not to
say much, and just lurk.  You might surprise yourself and answer a few
anyway.  If this happens a lot you'll be offered a chance to raid the
TAG fridge for some muchies and your beverage of choice.
</P>
<P>
We pride ourselves on possibly curmudgeonly and very human replies,
because we're real people, not worrying so much about the clean white
polish of a paper-white magazine.  I have, however, occasionally warned
people not to be too mean in their answers as things stray off topic.
As I said then, the mantra of the overall magazine is "Maiking Linux
Just A Little More Fun!" not "making the Borg kids cry."  Various topics
are considered bad, like people sending in their homework assignments
without even poking around in some URLs and researching in search engines
a little.  We've tried to provide some help for folks who are about to ask
- querents can read our "ask-the-gang" document - but generally we try to
have some fun with Linux and get people going so they can have fun here too.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Anyway, my apologies.
Tom Brown.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Please, take a look throughout the site, and let us know what you think
about any of it that you like.  Or especially any parts that confuse and
annoy... so we can improve ourselves.

<BR>Sluggo (<a href="mailto:gazette@lists.linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%2097%5D%20gazette%20matters%20%232"><em>Linux Gazette</em> Editor</a>)

</P>
<P>
Phil Hughes (the publisher of linuxgazette.com) claims that a main reason for
eliminating the Editor was that readers were complaining we were too
selective about what we publish, so they either felt they could not be authors
or were too intimidated to ask.  I was surprised to hear that because I never
felt we were heavy-handed, but that's what he says.
</P>
<P>
For the record, I receive some three hundred articles every year, and
publish all but three or four of them.  The only ones I've rejected were
advertisements disguised as articles, mindless Microsoft bashing (which
belongs in comp.os.linux.advocacy), material we've covered extensively
before, advocacy pieces that said nothing more than "Linux is good, try
it" (you're preaching to the choir), and articles whose English was so
bad that readers wouldn't understand significant points.
</P>
<P>
In every case I try to work with the author.  Advertisements I send to
News Bytes, or have the marketer get some employee to write a "balanced"
article from a user's perspective.  If it's an overpublished topic, I
ask the author to elaborate on certain portions -- what we're looking for
is new information -- or I notice areas in the author's expertise and
ask them if they're willing to write an article about that.  That's
actually one of the fun parts of being an editor: giving article ideas
to people based on things they've said.  Articles with bad English I
either proofread myself, find a translator or proofreader, or ask the
author to find a proofreader.  In most cases, the article either
becomes acceptable or the author writes a different article for us.
And sometimes the author goes on to write better articles later and
becomes a regular contributor.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some articles had incorrect technical advice that, if
followed, would make newbies shoot themselves in the foot.  You don't
mess around when talking about boot sectors, backups, security or
corrupting data: you make sure that at least those parts are right.
In every case I was able to tell the author myself how to fix the
article, or sent it to The Answer Gang for technical review, and the
article was published.
</P>
<P>
This all is what goes into the process of "editing", and it seems to
be what linuxgazette.com is objecting to in their attempt to have
an editorless zine.  As of November 2, they added one paragraph to
the author FAQ I wrote, saying in part, "There is no editor as such and
we're relying on authors to be self-editing....  Additionaly, assume
that your article is publishable, at most we'll take a cursory glance at
it, spell-checking and grammar are the author's responsibility."
(<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/faq/author.html</A>, question 1, paragraph 2) My
position is the everybody needs a little help sometimes, and it's the
editor's job to be that help.
</P>
<P>
As for reader complaints that we're too strict, I have not heard that
even once from readers during my four years editing LG.  Instead, in
<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A> comments and in other places, I
see the opposite: readers wish we were <EM>more</EM> selective.  Only a very
few readers express an opinion either way, but that's the direction of all the
opinions I've heard.
</P>
<P>
If you think LG is too strict -- or not strict enough -- in its article
selection, please let us know.
</P>

I can pretty much guarantee that you're seeing, there, just the
operating of an automated mirroring script, pulling down files from the
former LG.com site without supervision.  It'll get straightened out
eventually, with time.  Maybe they'll decide to mirror both.  ;-&gt;
</P>
<P>
Pity about the name confusion, but with luck the two periodicals
will diverge over time (if both persist).
</P>
<P>
(We at LG.net's staff had no idea the former site would produce more
issues:  They'd lead us to believe they were moving entirely away
from monthly issues, and adopting entirely dynamic CMS-based content.
The staff considered that format incompatible with publishing a
magazine, and failed to reach agreement on that with Phil Hughes over
many months.  That was one of the reasons we took Linux Gazette
elsewhere -- so it wouldn't cease to exist.  Therefore, LG.com's
subsequent "issue #96" came as a complete surprise.)

[Heather] 
I'd like to note for the record that the actual inquiry I first made
that led to the hosting we now have, was prompted by wondering whether
SSC would continue to host us when none of our staff worked there
anymore, NOT anything about stylesheets, layout, or automation.  We
didn't even know all those months ago who'd press enter on the Python
command that sets the ball rolling for release.  I just asked and T.R. was
kind enough to say whatever we needed to do, he'd support.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When, a couple months later, SSC claimed that changing the site was
being looked into so they could reduce personnel involvement - the
word "costs" was used several time - I noted that we could reduce their
cost to zero by moving away.  We asked why fix what isn't broken.  The
claim was made - and I still haven't seen any real RFC822 messages to
support - that readers claimed it was hard to submit.  This potential
about moving was shushed with "no, of course we'll support LG" and our
"technical advice" was solicited for the new plans.  Then the evil CMS
buzzword was brought up, we debated about it ... um, vigorously.   In
the spirit of actually having our opinions sought.  "Evil" I say because
it had come up and either failed even basic marketing or been hoist by
its own petard a couple of times before. (See the timeline if you care.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As it is I regret now (in 20/20 hindsight) taking as long to support
a move away as I did.  I regret taking the flack that I did when I
simply commented - in verbose answergang fashion - on the technical
failings that cause "content managed" sites to fail to be magazines by
nature.  But I don't own a TARDiS.  All I can do is move forward.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Mike Orr, aka Sluggo] 
Yes, although these aren't the only reasons we switched.  Ppl keep on
dwelling on monthly issues and CMS, but the latter played only a minor
role in my choice to participate, and the former played even less.  I
came back because:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<blockQuote><ul>
<LI>The quality of articles was going downhill drastically.

<LI>Many contributors were abandoning LG for that reason.

<LI>Who knows what worse changes might be coming after this.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[Heather] 
As of release time, the staff of The Linux Documentation Project are
discussing what to do about the split project, and which to carry or
point to.  This really got into discussion mid November, and they
probably want consensus; Jimmy O'Regan said they're pretty confused.
I can't blame them, since my efforts to support even a college-try at
CMS by announcing the preparation and the imbalanced opinions of it
among the <EM>LG</EM> staff far enough ahead to get readership response in
either direction were squished too.

[Sluggo]  The most ironic thing is, Heather had had the linuxgazette.org
domain registered for years.  But when Phil promised her early this year that
he wouldn't change LG, she let it expire.  Then when he did change it and we
wanted linuxgazette.org back, it was too late, a cybersquatter had snapped it
up.  That's why we're linuxgazette.net instead of linuxgazette.org.

<P><STRONG>
I was wondering why my tag accout got so few posts lately, so I looked again
and found the new ml.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
I hope you noticed mention of the new mailing list <EM>on</EM> the old one, and
my posted suggestion to LQO subscribers that they join us over here.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Wasn't it somehow possible to transfer the old subscribers to the new
list?
</STRONG></P>
<P>
SSC has all the mailing lists' rosters set to be accessible to the
listadmin, only.  We've asked Phil Hughes for help in transitioning;
he emphatically refused.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
And maybe the list subscription page should be
a little more prominent, I only found it by chance...
</STRONG></P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/tag/ask-the-gang.html</A> definitely needs something
near the top.  Anywhere else?
