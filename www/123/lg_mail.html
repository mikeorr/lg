Running <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> and AOLServer Together
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I want to do the following
<br>Run two web sites off one server using two different http daemons
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
1 Apache listening on port 80
<br>2 AOLServer listening on port 8080
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The apache server will be accessed by using url <A HREF="http://s1.com"
	>http://s1.com</A>
<br>The AOLServer will be accessed by using url <A HREF="http://s2.com"
	>http://s2.com</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The Names s1.com and s2.com are pointing at the same IP Address.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
If apache gets a request for www.s1.com it deals with it.
<br>If apache gets a request for www.s2.com it says not for me and
Reads its proxy entry, which tells it go to AOLServer on port 8080
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The Proxy stuff is working on apache.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Problem apache won't do this for me (I not sure if this scenario is even
possible)
<br>My entry in the apache conf file is as follows.
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>ProxyRequests Off
&lt;Proxy *&gt;
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all

Hi Everyone,
</P>
<P>
Found the following during my one of my aimless wandering sessions on
the web and thought that it was interesting enough to share with you all.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.pool.ntp.org"
	>http://www.pool.ntp.org</A>: Public ntp time server for everyone

The pool.ntp.org project is a big virtual cluster of timeservers
striving to provide reliable easy to use NTP service for millions of
clients without putting a strain on the big popular timeservers.
</BLOCKQuote><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
I would have shared my ntp server if I was running one and since one of
the requirements is that your IP has to be a static IP I can't use my
home system to run one and share it (Its IP hasn't changed in a while
but its not static 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" ALT=":(" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> ). But if any of you nice people feel like sharing
then please feel free to join the cluster. I think its a worthwhile project.
</P>
<P>
Well this is all for now. Hope you found this useful.
</P>
<P>
Thanks,

<P>
Hi, I have been trying to figure out exactly what the 'cwin' option to the tput
command really means.
</P>
<P>
What I'm hoping that it will let me do is to create another window in the
current terminal using a section of the screen to output listings from
different commands that will be executed from numbered menu options. And if the
output is several screens then it can be presented a few lines at a time to the
user with the option to page down through the many screens of output while not
disturbing the menu options at the top of the screen nor the status bars at the
bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
If you could provide an example of how to use the 'cwin' option and 'wingo'
option to the tput command I would be so happy. And I would appreciate it very
much. I've read all of the documentation that I have been able to find and
either the documentation for these two options doesn't exist or nobody uses
these two options.
</P>
<P>
Any help that you can provide with this will be greatly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
Here is an example of how the screen would look if I could do what I wanted to
do.
</P>

<blockquote><pre>

1. List all VxVM Volumes

<BR>Edgar_Howell (<a href="mailto:gazette@linuxgazette.net?subject=%20Re%3A%20%5BLG%20123%5D%20mailbag%20%231">Edgar_Howell from web.de</a>)

<P>
Greetings,
</P>
<P>
Once again a couple of readers have responded with very useful
comments, well worth making available to other readers.
</P>
<P>
1. CUPS Password
</P>
<P>
A reader who didn't want public mention let me know that the
following command takes care of my problem with the CUPS password:
</P>

<blockquote><pre>   lppasswd -a root -g sys
</pre></blockquote>
<P>
He suggests entering root's password, when asked.
</P>
<P>
2. Installation Software on External Media
</P>
<P>
And Dennis Kibbe of the Phoenix Linux Users Group pointed out
that for an additional $10 Dell will in fact provide the WinXP
Installation CD.
</P>
<P>
To be honest I don't know whether that isn't an option on this
side of the pond or I just didn't know about it.  Windows
awareness is not one of my strengths.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring philosophical and ethical considerations, that certainly
is a far more pragmatic approach and I almost certainly would
have coughed up the $10.
</P>
<P>
3. Installation Software, part 2
</P>
<P>
Recently a colleague gave me an article dealing with the problem
of installation media and the suggestion in it might be of interest
to anyone in a similar situation, although how long this might
remain valid is anyone's guess.  Note that this addresses the
operating system only, not any other software the manufacturer
of the hardware might have included.
</P>
<P>
Basically the premise is that all that is needed is the branch "i386"
from either some partition on the hard drive or a "recovery CD".
Inside this directory is a DOS executable, <TT>"WINNT.EXE</TT>", that installs
the operating system from the other contents of that directory.
</P>
<P>
Aparently there are complications in the boot process such that
one needs a particular boot program, available on the CDs with earlier
versions, which I of course don't have, so no way to make a
bootable installation medium.
</P>
<P>
It was also mentioned that this directory should be over 420 MB in
size and contain close to 6000 files.  What I found was almost
800 MB and that clearly wouldn't fit on a CD.  So I tar'd it
together and pushed it over the network onto another machine.
</P>
<P>
There I blew away everything under '98 that didn't look like DOS,
changed into the directory "i386" and then started the installer,
<TT>WINNT.EXE.</TT>  This produced a DOS-style screen with the heading
"Windows XP Setup" and a question about the installation directory,
which I left as it was.  Another screen or two later it complained
about not finding 593 MB of free disk space and broke off the
installation.  But that was really all I wanted to see -- I have
no use for this software anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
I don't wish on anyone the headache of trying to teach Windows some
manners.  But should co-existence become necessary for you, I hope
this information might be of help for however long that situation
may last.  And best wishes for a quick recovery.
</P>
<P>
*** DISCLAIMER ***
</P>
<P>
This procedure may be illegal where you live!
</P>
<P>
Here, in Germany, many years ago the courts decided that there is
no inherent relation between software and hardware and that one
can sell a used software license as legitimately as used hardware.
This requires, of course, retaining <EM>no</EM> copies of the software.
</P>
<P>
From this it seems reasonably to follow that one may move any
software from any hardware to any other, as long as at no time
the number of valid licenses is exceeded.  But prudent data
processing practice dictates at least one back-up copy of all
data and software.  However, since over-riding copy-protection and
encryption is a violation of the law here, it almost certainly is
illegal to do this with software so protected.
</P>
<P>
I'm not a lawyer.  You need to know the rules on your own turf.

The wiring diagrams and timing diagrams for a stepper motor are indeed

why, when I tried to compile the code and it failed (I'm at 2.6.13.3,
myself), I let it go.

We're driving a 8255, that's not rocket science. There's
absolutely no need to write just another driver for a normal PC
parport: there is one already. To be exact, there's a complete
framework to drive anything that has a DB-25 parport connector
outside at the box, irrelevant by what kind of chip this is driven
(thing SGI machines, Amigas, PowerPC, ...). This module would only
work on a PeeCee, nothing else.

If this had been published some 6 years ago, it would probably fall
under the "this is a quick'n'dirty hack" rule, but today, I guess
something like that shouldn't be published at all, because it aims
towards quite a wrong direction. Not to imagine that anybody might
think this is good programming style...

Well... if you can show a better way to do this, I'm sure that our

we can do to improve the situation.

I've got some code around to access the ppdev API. With this, the
module isn't needed at all and thus the resulting application only
consists of simple and portable userland code.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
[Ben] I think that, even though the implementation is broken, the underlying
premise of Sreejith's article is valid; our readers would, in my
opinion, find it interesting to see a simple introduction on accessing
hardware by writing a module. Do you think that the article is
salvageable as it is (i.e., is it possible to make the code work -
regardless of whether another tool for it exists or not), or is it just
broken from the start?
</P>
<P><STRONG>
@Sreejith: <A HREF="http://lug-owl.de/~jbglaw/software/steckdose/steckdose.c"
	>http://lug-owl.de/~jbglaw/software/steckdose/steckdose.c</A> is
some code using the ppdev API to access the parport lines. Maybe you
want to have a look at that? I'd try to write some code driving a
stepper motor in full-step mode, but since I don't have one handy
right now, you'd need to test that.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The code mentioned above drives a shift register connected to a
parport (It is driving some home-made hardware; at the parallel
outputs of the shift register, there are relays switching my computers
on and off. That way I don't need to go down into the cellar to switch
a machine on or off 
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=":-)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
It is quite simple:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>for (each bit to be pushed serially into the shift register) {
	put_one_bit_on_the_serial-in_data_line();
	rise_clock_line();
	lower_clock_line();
}
move_shift-state_into_output_latches();
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
Because shift registers output their falling-out bit at the end, this
can be fed into the next shift register. That way, I can cascade a
dozens of these chips to control 100 lines.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Maybe something like that could even be presented as an article, but
to date I haven't production-level PCBs, but only hand-made ones.

[Ben] I would have appreciated it if you had said something about them when

Actually i did
this experiment as my Mini project in the 4th semester of my B Tech course(June
2003). At that time i was using 2.2 kernel and i learned the basics in the
same. But now i am working with Fedora core 1 (2.4.22 -1.2115.nptl). So what
happened is, i just modified the code for the new kernel and rectified the
compilation errors. And now i see....its a mixture of 2.2 and 2.4 things.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
But it is a working code. I can control my toy stepper motor
with this code.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
[Ben] Unfortunately, it doesn't compile for me - even after I've taken out the
hard-coded kernel location in the INCLUDE line:

<P><STRONG>
For testing, i was just printing the hex value to the console instead of
writing to
parallel port. For controlling stepper motor, the -printf("%d\n",pattern[i][j]
[k]); -
statement should be replaced with - outb(pattern[i][j][k],LPT_BASE); . Anyway
this is
a serious mistake and I deeply regret and apologize for that.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
[Ben] Well, we'll let our readers know not to expect this code to work, then;
publishing this exchange should do it. Fortunately, every cloud has a
silver lining: Jan-Benedict Glaw, who noticed the problem initially, has
agreed to review future C code for us so that this kind of thing doesn't
happen again.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
Nowadays, because of my workload, i am not able to explore
"The Linux World" that MUCH!... My intention was not to develop a professional
stepper motor driver as i know that there already exists a parallel port driver
in Linux. I just wanted to share the basics of device driver coding through an
example.
</STRONG></P>
<P>
[Ben] Sreejith, may I ask why you wrote this article in the first place?
</P>
<P>
Actually, never mind: the above question is best treated as rhetorical.
Instead, I'll just pretend that I'm having this exchange with
$AVERAGE_AUTHOR - a fellow who just wrote an article that failed in the
same way as yours did, and from whom I got the same above excuse when I
asked him about it (and to whom, unbeknownst to him, I've slipped a
bunch of truth serum in his morning tea.)

<LI>AA: (full-blown panic, RUN AWAY!!!)
</ul></blockQuote>
<P>
Does this scenario look familiar?
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there's a "best effort" clause hidden in doing any
kind of work for the Open Source community. The coin of Open Source is
<em> respect  </em> - and when you put out less than your best effort, then that
coin might not only be a bit slow in coming, but might not appear at all
- and will disappear instantly when that respect is discovered to be
unearned. Note that I didn't say "will disappear when a mistake is
discovered" - everyone makes mistakes. The deciding factor is in how you
<EM>handle</EM> having made the mistake: making excuses such as "my intention
was not to develop a professional [application]" destroys the last
possibility of getting paid in that coin, whereas - for example -
admitting the error honestly and taking a few minutes to produce working
code that could be published as a corrective note the following month
would have salvaged some of the credit.
</P>
<P>
The staff here at LG put out their best effort to edit, format, and
publish the material that is submitted to us; I can guarantee you that
all of it is hard work, but despite that, excuses like "well, it's not a
professional publication" don't have much currency here.
</P>

<blockquote><font color="#000066">

a homey, at a real person's desk kind of feeling - and we do it for love

</font></blockquote>
<P>
[Ben] By that same
exact token, we expect that our authors - especially those submitting
code - have made <em>  their  </em> best effort to make sure that their code works
in the current Linux environment, and have done at least some minimal
testing.  Perhaps that assumption was unwarranted in this case, for
which I personally apologize to our readers (since I was the one who
accepted the article for publication); however, that <EM>is</EM> our default
expectation. I don't see how ANY interaction based on respect can imply
anything else.
</P>
<P>
Just as a relevant technical note, by the way: the 2.6 kernel has been
available for download since 17-Dec-2003 (according to the timestamp of
<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.0.tar.bz2"
	>http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.0.tar.bz2</A>) - I see
no reason why an article directed at kernel-related coding would cover
the 2.4 kernel as its primary target.

I'm very pleased to announce that our Editor In Chief, Ben Okopnik, has
married his dear Kat.

<P>
The wedding was delightful (give or take getting lost on the way there),
the music was fun, the food was fine, and the nearby outdoor gardens were
pretty, too.  Those of us present who did not immediately have to leave
again joined the happy pair afterwards at a nearby restaurant whose chef
is, in my not so humble opinion, rightly famous.
</P>
<P>
It was great.  Go see the <a href="lg_backpage.html">Back Page</a> for
a picture of the happy pair.

Rumors that his biggest client paid for the honeymoon turn out to be
halfway well founded in that they invited him to go for pay to the kind
of place that he and his bride would have been <EM>delighted</EM> to go to
anyway.  Smiles from the universe are always appreciated

I saw that one can get LG either as a single html or group of

off-line more easily. I did try to get this answer from the various

<DD><A HREF="http://directory.fsf.org/print/misc/html2pdf.html"
	>http://directory.fsf.org/print/misc/html2pdf.html</A>
</DL>

<P>[K.-H.]
<br>There is a little commandline tool named "html2ps" which will fetch e.g.
the TWDT page and convert it into a ps file.
for the current linuxgazette this would be:
<br><tt>html2ps -o test.ps -U <A HREF="http://linuxgazette.net/121/TWDT.html"
	>http://linuxgazette.net/121/TWDT.html</A></tt>
</P>
<P>
-U is supposed to generate the colored background (e.g. code) but
doesn't do it for me, and -D would generate DSC info so you can go back
and forward.
</P>
<P>
Using ps2pdf you can convert it again into a pdf file.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise there is always the print-to-file in your browser which
generates postscript as well (at least in Linux).
</P>
<P>
Hope that helps you along....
