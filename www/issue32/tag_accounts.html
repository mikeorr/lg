<strong><p>Answerguy,
</p></strong>
<strong><p>I'm doing a course on unix administration, unfortunatly i don't
recall being taught to disable a user, I was hoping you would be
able to tell me how to do this?
</p></strong>
<strong><p>Thanks
<br>Glenn
</p></strong>

>I suppose you could disable a user by taking a sledgehammer
or other LART to his or her kneecaps (least gruesome among 
many means that come to mind).  However, I presume the intended 
question at hand was:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>"How does a Unix/Linux sysadmin disable a user's
<EM>account</EM>?"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Now, I should preface this answer with a bit of a flame
(more of a spark, really):  This is not the "do-your-homework"
line.  When you get an assigment as part of your coursework
you've either been presented with the information needed to 
answer the question --- or you're expected to know where to
find that information (how to do the research).  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, before I answer this question let me answer the meta-question:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>"How does a sysadmin find out how to perform routine
user and group management operations on his systems?"
</blockquote>
<blockquote>One way is to look for commands that relate the operation, 
to find out what might be '<tt>apropos</tt>' --- so we issue the
'<tt>apropos</tt>' command (or '<tt>man -k</tt>' --- keyword search command).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Since this relates to a user's account let's try:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code>man -k account
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>On my system that gives me two commands:
</blockquote>
<pre>userdel (8)          - Delete a user account and related files
usermod (8)          - Modify a user account
</pre>

<blockquote>These and many others will show up when we issue:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code>man -k users
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>... and '<tt>man -k login</tt>' will give us just about the right
number of other alternatives.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>However, '<tt>usermod</tt>' sounds promising.  Looking at the man
page for usermod and searching on the word "disable" leads be to 
the following paragraph:
</blockquote>

<pre>-f inactive_days
The  number  of days after a password expires until
the account is permanently disabled.  A value of  0
disables  the  account  as soon as the password has
expired, and a value of -1  disables  the  feature.
The default value is -1.
</pre>
<blockquote>... so that's one way to do it.  If we near the end of the
man pages we'll often find a "SEE ALSO" section which will
point us to related man pages.  So we look at <tt>passwd(1)</tt>
(the section/chapter 1 command '<tt>passwd</tt>') and search on disable
and find:
</blockquote>

<pre>Account maintenance
User  accounts  may be locked and unlocked with the -l and
-u flags.  The -l option disables an account  by  changing
the   password  to  a  value  which  matches  no  possible
encrypted value.  The -u option re-enables an  account  by
changing the password back to its previous value.
</pre>

<blockquote>... so that's method number two.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>This note about "changing the password to a value which 
matches no...." sounds in intriquing.  Technically it is
using the wrong terminology since passwords in the <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>
file are technically not "encrypted" --- they are "hashed"
using a cryptographically strong algorithm (DES by default, MD5 
or others on some systems).  The distinction is lost on most
writers and it is a bit longer to explain --- but the  way that
DES hashing of a password under Unix works is that the password
and a "salt" (a random 12 bit value) are used as a "key" to 
"encrypt" a string of ASCII NUL's using the DES (data encryption 
standard --- a 20 year old U.S. mandated encryption system derived 
from IBM's "Lucifer" research).  The result value is expressed as 
a subset of the printable characters with the "salt" prepended to it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>(The "salt" exists simply to make "dictionary attacks" more
expensive --- computationally and in terms of storage.  It
means that the "crack-er" has to have about 4000 different
hashes for every word in his or her 'crack' dictionary).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>One of the properties of DES that made it attractive for 
commercial deployment is that that it is highly resistant
to "known plaintext attacks."  That means that it was
computationally infeasible to recover the key even if one
had arbitrary samples of the plain text (our string of NUL
characters in this case) and the crypt text (the hashed form of 
the password from the <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There are two reasons why this, technically, is not being 
used for "encryption."  First, is a matter of semantics;  if 
I know the plain text (the string of NUL's) then I'm not
"encrypting" anything becuase I'm not "hiding information."
I am "using cryptographic protocols and algorithms" for 
other purposes (such as authentication, digital signatures,
etc). The other reason is more technical and pedantic. Conceivably 
there might be multiple keys (passwords) that encrypt a string
of NUL's into the same hash.  This is a defining property of 
hashes (checksums, CRC's, etc).  You can verify that there is
a given "message" has a given likelihood of being valid
(you can measure its probability of integrity) --- but you can
not definitively say that a given specific message was <EM>the</EM>
same one that generated a given hash.  (Given other constraints
on the use of DES for Unix passwords it's possible to try all
1 to 8 character combinations to detect collisions --- but that
is a different matter).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In any event, given an alleged password the '<tt>login</tt>' program
(or the <tt>xdm</tt>, <tt>xlockmore</tt>, POP/IMAP daemon, or PAM module, etc)
will attempt to encrypt a string of NUL's with it (and the
"salt") and compare the resulting hash to the one stored in the
<tt>/etc/passwd</tt> or the <tt>/etc/shadow</tt> file.  (Generally this is done
via the '<tt>crypt(3)</tt>' library call).  There are minor differences
in the details (particularly on '<tt>shadow</tt>' vs. non-shadowed systems)
but that's the gist of it.  If the hashes match than the user
is presumed to have entered the correct password.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>If we follow another cross-reference from the <tt>passwd(1)</tt>
man page we might find a list of characters that cannot be
generated by the <tt>crypt(3) function</tt>.  Actually we'll find a 
list of characters that <EM>can</EM> result from the operation and
a bit of thought about that (taking the complement) will
show us some characters that will never work.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Now, the Linux man pages don't just come out and say this
but logically we can see that we could use the following 
procedure to "manually" disable an account:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<ul><li>Edit the <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> ('<tt>vipw</tt>' command)
		(or the <tt>/etc/shadow</tt>, as appropriate)

	<li>Find the user.

	<cwliblockquote>Insert an '*' into the the password field 
		(i.e.prepend the password has with an asterisk)
</ul></blockquote>

<blockquote>... and it makes sense that <EM>no</EM> password will <em>ever</em>
result in a matching hash.  Thus the user will be locked out
of direct logins.  To re-enable the account *with the same
password it used to have* just remove the asterisk.  That's
why we don't overwrite the passwd --- then we'd have to 
go through extra work to securely re-enable the password and
get the user's new password set.  (Most organizations are 
quite sloppy about this procedure --- sending initial passwords
over e-mail, setting them to well-known and easily guessed
values, etc.  I recommend much better protocols).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Now, I have a confession to make:  I didn't figure this all
out on my own.  I didn't read all of these man pages.  I 
learned about the "prepend with an asterisk" trick from other
sysadmins.  It was so long ago, I really don't remember where
I saw it first.  It might have been netnews.  It might have been
over someone's shoulder.  Who knows.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The point here is that you should find some of those sysadmins
to "hang out" with.  To be an effective sysadmin you need to
become part of a sysadmin community.  You and your classmates
should probably form such a community and work together ---
there's too much in this field for anyone to "know it all"
(as a perusal of my back issues will sure prove with regards
to me).  The most organized and widespread community of 
sysadmins would be SAGE (the "System Adminsitrator's Guild"
--- the 'e' is silent).  Look at 
<A HREF="http://www.usenix.org/sage">http://www.usenix.org/sage</A>
for details.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Of course none of this is to suggest that you should neglect
your textbooks.  There are two standard textbooks on systems
administration today:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<dl><dt>Unix System Administration Handbook, 2nd Edition
	<dd>by Evi Nemeth, Trent R. Hein, Scott Seebass and
		Garth Snyder 
	<br>(Prentice Hall, 1995, ISBN 0-13-151051-7)
	<br>Known as the "cranberry book."

<dt>Essential System Administration, 2nd Edition
	<dd>by Aeleen Frisch 
	<br>(O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 1995, ISBN 1-56592-127-5)
	<br>... the "armadillo book"
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>... I'm working on one that I hope will go well beyond these
--- although it will appear as a &quot;Linux&quot; title.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Of the two Frisch's work tends to give a more "step-by-step"
HOWTO approach to these things --- so I'd look in there
(indeed I tried to review it so I could remind myself of 
what she says --- but my copy must be out on loan somewhere).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Glancing in the cranberry book's index I find no entry
under "accounts" and "users" refers me to "logins" where
I find "disabling" on pp. 95 &amp; 95:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Occasionally, a user's login must be temporarily 
disabled.  Before networking invaded the UNIX world
we would just put a star in front of the encrypted
password, making it impossible for the user to log in.
However the user could still log in across the network.
These days we replace the user's shell with a program
that prints a message explaining why the login as been
disabled and provides instructions for rectifying the 
situation.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There is no further explanation of this at that point ---
and they don't cover a number of other issues related to 
the situation.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>They are, of course, referring to the fact that this 
user might have a <tt>.rhosts</tt> file that permits them access
to their account without a password.  Their approach is 
<EM>part</EM> of a solution --- but it is incomplete.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the <em>Linux System Administration Handbook</em> 
by Mark F. Komarinski and Cary Collett they go into a bit more detail
(p. 24) but show a bit less experience:
</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>If you want to disable a user account (that is,
	prevent the user from logging in again), replace the
	password in the <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file with an * or some
	other character.  Since the * isn't a valid encrypted
	password, there is no password that will allow you to
	log into that account (2).
</blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>... no notion of re-enabling the account with its old 
password here.  We've replaced it.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Komarinski and Collett also mention that the account can
receive mail --- but doesn't mention that there may be 
other forms of access that are possible by this "disabled"
user.   They miss the same things that Nemeth et al 
gloss over --- and a bit more.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>A few of the problems with just knocking out the password
--- and changing the shell:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You might have various other services, like <tt>ssh</tt>,
that don't require a password.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Their <tt>.forward</tt> file might route their mail through
a script or customer filtering program (like <tt>procmail</tt>).  
That script could do anything that they could do
under their UID --- including opening up some sort of 
connection to some system to which they still have 
access and allowing them to have interactive access
to a shell.  (I don't know of a tool that does this
--- but I know it's possible and I could probably 
cook one up in a few hours using '<tt>netcat</tt>' and/or
'<tt>expect</tt>' --- there's probably a set of "warez" that
does this for you.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>They might have started a daemon.  This might wake
up periodically and change their password and shell
back to some setting  (we didn't prevent their UID
from running the <tt>chsh</tt> and <tt>passwd</tt> commands, perhaps
via an '<tt>expect</tt>' or a <tt>Perl/comm.pl</tt> script).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>They might leave in '<tt>cron</tt>' or '<tt>at</tt>' jobs 
to periodically renable their access or as a logic bomb.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>If their directory was on a writable NFS volume and they
can get at any of the hosts that are trusted by that
NFS server ---- they can put in new <tt>.forward</tt> and
other "magic" files to do these sorts of things.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>There might be other mechanisms that I don't even know 
about.  In fact there almost certainly are.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Many of these won't apply to many hosts.  However they should
all be considered.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>One potential method would be to remove their line from the
<tt>/etc/passwd file completely</tt>.  Perhaps you'd save it in a
special file so you could restore it later.  I don't
like that approach since it leaves their files as 'orphans'
(an <tt>ls -l</tt> command will show numeric ID's for the ownership
and they will be found by a '<tt>find -nouser</tt>' command).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>So, the minimum I recommend to disable an account is:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><ul>
	<li><EM>star</EM> out the password.
	<cwliblockquote>Change the shell to a <EM>binary</EM> such as 
		<tt>/usr/sbin/nologin</tt>
		--- DO NOT USE A SHELL SCRIPT FOR THIS!  I'd also 
		recommend not linking it against any standard libraries
		--- it should use a few direct <tt>write()</tt>'s and 
		one <tt>exit()</tt> system calls and that's it!  
		(Various magic environment
		variables are used by most any shell and by the 
		standard I/O libraries --- these can sometimes be
		overflowed or subverted).
	<li>Change the user's home directory to /home/.graveyard
	<li>Remove any 'cron' or 'at' jobs for that user (or 
		review them thoroughly, if there's some reason to 
		retain them).
	<li>Kill all processes owned by that user.  (Manually 
		go through a ps listing or use a  command like:

		<blockquote><code>ps -u | while read user pid rest; do 
			<br>kill $pid; done
		</code></blockquote>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Using PAM you can do other things, in addition to this. 
For example you can use the <tt>listfile.so</tt> (module) to check
a magic file in <tt>/etc/</tt> (one that you create for yourself)
with the "sense=deny" parameters.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Another thing I personally recommend (at least optionally)
is to scour your filesystems for files owned by this user
--- move them all into a "graveyard" <tt>.tar</tt> file.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>You can use a command like:
</blockquote>

<blockquote><blockquote><code
>{ cd / &amp;&amp; find . -user $GOING \
<br>| tee /root/tmp/scourge.$$ \
<br>| tar cTzf - /home/.graveyard/$GOING.tar.gz } \
<br>&amp;&amp;  cat /root/tmp/scourge.$$ | xargs rm -f \
<br>cat /root/tmp/scourge.$$ | xargs rmdir  2&gt; /dev/null
</code></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>... this is intentionally simplified (I usually do this by
hand since I have reason to go through a disabled users files
to re-assign them to other users.  That's appropriate for 
former or suspended employees while it wouldn't be in most 
educational or ISP environments).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>The  point of this process is to create a "graveyard" file
that contains <EM>every</EM> file that this user owned.  I remove them
(dangerous if they used degenerate filenames --- this part
I'm glossing over since I usually manually look over the list to 
catch them and I suggest running a 'skulker' to warn you about
'weird' filenames anyway).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>In most cases I don't recommend re-using user names (for 
several months at least) or UID's (until you've "wrapped around" 
on the UID's).  This is a complex issue, but it really amounts
to avoiding the confusion when you restore from backups, or
encounter other files (perhaps members from .tar files) 
etc.  This is another case where the standard practice for
ISP's and educational institutions is necessary quite different
from business and government sites (typically the turn over
in ISP's and at colleges, etc, is far to quick to worry about
UID re-use after about one fiscal quarter).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Note: there may be other things you'll have to do in sites
that use NIS/NIS+  (make sure you update the account entry in
the master yp maps), and in Kerberos realms (remove their 
credentials on the KDC).  I don't know all the details of 
these.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Hopefully I've made some important points here:
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Read the man pages.  (I have never left it at
RTFM --- I prefer to tell you which M to F'ing
R).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Look beyond the first answer.  If you'd stopped
at the <tt>usermod -f 0</tt>, you'd be stumped at the 
first box you came to that didn't have the shadow
suite installed, or that had a different 
implementation.  Likewise with the <tt>passwd -l</tt> (which 
I think is not supported in the PAM suite that came
with <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A> 5.1).  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Knowing about "star-ring out" the password is pretty 
portable --- it works with DES, MD5, and "Big-DES", 
at least.  HOWEVER, you have to check on each new 
version of UNIX that you encounter!  Try it on a test 
account and make sure you method works.  Tomorrow
someone may implement a Unix passwd scheme that uses
SHA-1 (the NIST secure hashing algorithm) in some
way --- possibly with a bug --- that ignores the 
"*'s."  A minute's test on each new system is probably
worth a professional sysadmin's time.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Look beyond the initial question.  It sounds like
you were told to just stop the user from "logging in"
--- which might lead to an incomplete solution (prevent
<EM>password authenticated</EM> logins).  If the requirement
is <EM>disable the account</EM> then perhaps you need to do 
more than merely prevent password authentication.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>This last point is crucial.  Just knowing how Unix and Linux
work is not enough.  Knowing that many sites have the r*
(<tt>rsh</tt>, <tt>rlogin</tt>, et al) utilities enabled, and knowing that 
a <tt>.forward</tt> file can be used to run arbitrary shell scripts
with arbitrary side effects; these go beyond just knowing 
how Unix works.  More importantly you have to think about
the implications of these things, and know people who've 
experienced some of them.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Reading the threads on <a href="news:comp.unix.admin"
	>comp.unix.admin</a> for a few months will
help quite a bit with that.  Netnews for all the bad rap
that it takes and all of the spam it endures, is still the
largest set of open, ongoing technical discussions in the
world.  The regulars in comp.unix.admin are particularly helpful
<EM>UNLESS YOU EXPECT THEM TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK</EM>.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Finally: it's more important that you know *how to find 
answers* than how to perform a specific operation.  It is even
more important that you learn how to ask the right questions.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>This goes beyond the nitpick (disabling the user vs. his or her
account) --- and asking "disable access to <EM>which services</EM>"
(which requires some understanding of all of the services and
forms of access that are available on the system at hand.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>Anyway, good luck on your studies.
