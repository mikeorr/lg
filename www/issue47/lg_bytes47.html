<FONT COLOR="green">Storm Linux Beta Released
</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> Vancouver, Canada  -- October 25, 1999 -- <A HREF=http://www.stormix.com>
Stormix Technologies</A> announces the official beta version of Storm Linux.
The final release is scheduled for November 1999.

<P> "What we learned from the alpha," says Bruce Byfield, Product
Manager for Stormix Technologies, "is that users want a Linux
install that's easy but not dumbed down.

<P> "For example, in the alpha, users were forced to install the
Linux Loader and could only do so on the master boot record.
However, alpha testers told us very clearly that they wanted more
flexibility. So, in the beta, we've given it to them. At the same
time, new users can simply accept the defaults and quickly get a
workable system. We've tried to balance flexibility and ease of
use all down the line."

<P> Another major feature of the Storm Linux is the Storm Hardware
System. SHS automatically detects PCI devices, including video
and network cards, SCSI devices, and USB bridges.

<P> "The information collected during alpha testing," Lindsay says,
"has greatly extended our hardware compatibility. As a result,
we'll be putting our database on the web, so that users worldwide
can request and receive support for their cards. Our goal is to
make Storm Linux the most complete Linux hardware solution
available."

<P> Other features of the beta include GUI modules for networking,
dialup, and adding users. "These modules," Byfield explains, "are
simply the first glimpse of what Stormix is planning. The final
release will include other modules that weren't ready for the
beta."

<P> Copies of the beta are being mailed to registered testers. Copies
can also be downloaded from the Stormix web site.

<P> Founded in February 1999, Stormix Technologies is a Linux
development Canada based in Vancouver, Canada. Its flagship
product is Storm Linux, an enhancement of the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution.

announced that it has made a $10,000 donation to the Wildlife Conservation
Society for the preservation of penguins.  In addition, the Company stated it
will no longer use live penguins to promote its Linux products.  Magic created
quite a "flap" recently when it usedtwo live penguins at the LinuxWorld Expo in
San Jose to introduce its new business-to-business e-commerce solution, Magic
eMerchant for Linux, for this rapidly growing operating system whose symbol is
a penguin.

<P> The controversy started last August when Magic brought two live trained
penguins, named Jeffrey and Lucinda, to the San Jose Convention Center to
open the trade show floor, as well as introduce each of the Companys hourly
demonstrations of its new eMerchant  product.  For five minutes at the start of
every hour, the birds trainers would allow people around the booth to take
pictures of one of the birds (the birds alternated times in the booth), as well
as pet the bird.  This "ruffled the feathers" of some trade show attendees
who later called PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) to voice
their concerns.

being a very affordable alternative for both business (SOHO) and personal
usage. It is also estimated that there will be over 100,000 Web hosting
operations in Korea by year-end.

<P> "We are very pleased to be able to handle sales and marketing for the
NetWinder in regions like China and Japan," said Jay Park, director of
marketing and development for KASAN Electronics. "The thin-server market is
one of the most rapidly growing in the network market, we are confident that
by adding our expertise and services to the NetWinder we will achieve World

</FONT>
</H3> 

<P> Atlanta, GA.  --  October 15, 1999 Winners of the first annual Loki Hack
were announced in an afternoon press conference at the Atlanta Linux Showcase.
During the Hack, enthusiastic and talented hackers from across the country and
around the world had 48 hours in a secure setting to make alterations to the
Linux source code for Activision's popular strategy game Civilization: Call to
Power.  The hackers had full reign to add features, alter logic,  and implement
additional library support. 

<P> "This is the closest we could get to Open Source with our commercial
products," said Scott Draeker, Loki president and founder. "The world
can't see the source, but the contestants did. And all the hacks, mods,
and changes will be posted in binary form for free download from our
website next week. This was our chance to show the gaming world what the
Open Source community can accomplish, and the results have been
incredible."

<P> At the press conference Draeker awarded first prize to Christopher Yeoh,
a developer from Denver, Colorado. Yeoh completed several modifications
to Civilization: Call to Power, including the addition of extra units
such as land carriers and stealth carriers. Yeoh also enhanced the Spy
unit by allowing it to infiltrate an enemy city. If successful, the Spy
is destroyed, but the player can view the infiltrated city's statistics
until payment is received from the enemy.

<P> First prize is a StartX MP Workstation from VA Linux Systems. Runners-up
will receive their choice of Gamer-X sound cards from Creative Labs,
