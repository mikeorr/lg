<P> Is there a way to have my Linux box access the internet via a Win98 box that
has the Win98SE internet connection sharing (ICS) installed?  I have my LAN
setup fine (can ping, telnet, ftp, etc.), but I tried setting my Win98 box
as my "default gateway" in RedHat 6.0, and it hits the Win98 box, but the
connection is refused.  Do any how-tos exist to get this to work?

<P> Hi everybody,

<P> I am in need of some program that let me browse
and quickly edit HTML files.
The reason is a grat lot of HTML local files that need VERY frequent
updating.
To launch the editor of Netscape - apart from the not-so-occasional
crash,
is way too slow.

<P> It would be so fine to have a browser that, at the touch of some magic
key,
would allow to WRITE upon the html doc, and save it locally.

<P> Are you aware of something like this?

<P> Thank you

However, i did already install linux before, and in removing it, i
removed my MBR(master boot record) under dos with command FDISK /MBR.
 So my MBR is blank now, and then i repartitioned my drive with
partitionmagic 4.0 . Now, linux can't mount the drive because in the
MBR there is nothing telling linux there is a drive.

<P> This i the reason for not retrieving my root.

<P> Does anyone have a solution, for rewriting the MBR or telling linux
where to mount the drive ???

<BR>Subject: Help on database and stats for doctors

<P> Dear Linux gurus and experts
I am a surgeon who is planning to use Linux for the computer in the
hospital I work in. I need a simple database program and a statistical
program which can anlyse the data in the patient database.
We are not programmers and so cannot use complex programs. The only useful
feature is to auto fill certain records. Example if the operation is TURP,
the category is major, region is prostate and code is J789EX, once I put it
in the next time I choose TURP from a drop down list of operation names the
other criteria should automatically be recorded. OK?
Then I must be able to get the statistics say for the year, of the data I
want analysed in graphical as well as numerical form. Number of a type of
operation, a pie graph of the category of surgery etc.
It must be easy to use in a GUI and must be freeware as well.
I have looked at the Software Map but there are too many listed and it
confused me more!
Please advice so we can get going as soon as possible.

<P> Thanks<BR>

<BR>Subject: Article idea: Linux and MS SMS

<P> Is there a way to "fool" MS Systems Management Server into thinking that a
Linux (or Sun/intel) machine is just another Win95 machine?
I'm not sure of everything that MS SMS does, but aside from asking me
for a network pasword they also check for the Explorezip worm... I've looked
at the Linux HOWTOs and did not see anything on this subject.

<P> MS SMS runs on Windows NT and comes in 2 pieces: server component and client
component. Among other things SMS does: Hardware Inventory, Network
Discovery, Software Inventory, and Compliance Checking.
(see http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/exec/sms20datasheet.asp )
I looked at the SAMBA doc. at http://wwww.samba.org and see the following:
"Samba runs on Unix platforms, but speaks to Windows clients like a native.
It allows a Unix system to move into a Windows "Network Neighborhood"
without causing a stir." This does not mention SMS. Can SAMBA "fool" MS SMS
into thinking that my linux box is a Windows machine and permit me to logon
on the network without raising alarms bells? SMS logon also seems to
authenticate me to the MS Exchange Server from which I must retrieve
email...  I need this capability as well.

<P> Given the "underground" nature of many Linux deployments, I'd be surprised
if others have not had similar qestions. It would make for a good article and
maybe a good HOWTO...

<P> Hi.

<P> Wanted to say thanks about the tidbit of increasing the MAX_LOOP past 8
for the loop back device to get more than 8 devices.  I've got mine set
to 32, and it is working great.

<P> Question is:

<P> I know the loopback device has options for encryption, I wanted to know
if anyone can think of a way to get it to do compression.  IE. Gzip the
loopfile, and have the system automagically parse the read/write through
a decompressor/compressor..  It would be the same type of process like
the encryption, except be compressed.

<P> I really have a need in something like this, if you can think of any
resources I could try, I would greatly appreciate it.

Recently (after reseting the system clock and

opening a terminal:

<P> limit: coredumpsize: Can't set limit

<P> This message is coming from /etc/csh.cshrc.
Thinking perhaps that csh (who I suppose is
exectuing csh.cshrc) thought that there wasn't
enough disk space, I reset the value to 100000
from 1000000.  That fixed the problem...sort
of.  However, now when I log in from outside via
telnet I get the same message. Even this statement

<P> limit coredumpsize 10

<P> does not work from a telneted session.

<P> I am worried that this behavior is due to some
kind of hack attack.  I am running tcp wrappers
on most everything from anywhere, but I do use
the web and thought perhaps something bad came
in on a cgi script.

<P> Hello and goodmorning...

AND I AM NEW TO LINUX... - I just have one problem, or, actually,
difficulty...
I have managed to figure out some things to get my soundcard working, i
am getting close to getting my zip drive to work - but one thing I
cannot solve...
I have a DSystems Wizar3d display adapter with 4096 Kb RAM and Linux
says it is based on the Cirrus Logic GD5464? chipset.
In windows, I could easily use it at 16.7 Million colors at 1024x768,
but the graphical thing of RedHat (startx??) can't get more out of it
than 8 bit color, 640x480, and I hate that tiny screen...
I found a program called Xconfigurator or something and it tells me it
can't display 1024x768, or even 800x600...  it won't even give me more
than 8 bit (256?) colors...
I think it MUST be possible to get a screen I like - say 1024x768x16.7M
colors? :-)

<P> Who can help me???????????????????????

<BR>Subject: SNA Server

<P> Is SNA Server available for Linux, yet?

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	<P>[Not knowing what SNA Server is, I asked one of our sysadmins, Rory
	Krause.  He did a web search and discovered that according to the 
	<A HREF=http://www.microsoft.com/sna/> Microsoft web site</A>, SNA
	Server is a "comprehensive gateway and application integration
	platform", a "LAN-to-Host gateway" (especially to AS/400 and mainframe
	systems), and a part of Microsoft BackOffice.
	Given that information, and the unwillingness of Microsoft to port
	its other products  (e.g., MS-Office, Internet Explorer) to Linux, I
	would say not to expect SNA Server in the near future.

	<P> Don, what is it you need SNA Server to do?  Possibly there are some
	existing Linux programs which could be combined to do the same thing.

<BR>Subject: How do I disable network services on one network card ?

<P> I have two linux boxes in a home network (connected via ethernet). One
of my computers (the faster machine) has a second network card connected
to the internet via a cable modem.
I've read all about basic security and how I should not run too many
unnecessary network daemons like ftp, finger, etc on a host that's
connected to the internet. However I often use these services for
testing purposes at home.
Is there an easy way I can disable these services from running on the
network card that's connected to the internet, sort of like the network
bindings tab in NT where you can unbind NetBIOS from one NIC.
I'd hate to have to run one computer as a dedicated firewall...

	[There are two issues here.  We receive occasional complaints about
	both.
	<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Not being able to connect to the FTP site at all:</STRONG>
<DD> Our FTP server allows connections only from clients whose forward and
reverse domain names match.  Is it possible your ISP doesn't have this set
correctly?  Our sysadmin insists this step is necessary for security.  It was
tightened down around issue 47, which may explain why some people used to be
able to collect but not now.<P>

<DT><STRONG>Downloads aborting in the middle of a large file:</STRONG>
<DD> We have not been able to pinpoint the cause of this.  It appears to be
some peculiarity of how certain ISPs are set up in relation to our server.<P>

	<P> In either case, please try a mirror site.  Their servers will be
	configured differently, and possibly in a way that is more compatible
	with your computer.  -Ed.]

	</EM></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Joachim responded: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
maybe one solution could be an aditianal note apended to one of the
files - or a new file with that. The result should be a
different filesize of the newly created tar.gz. 

<P> Perhaps publishing the size of the old - and the size of the new file
may help. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> I agree. I personally don't look at timestamps when it concerns two
versions of files. For all we know, the date on the computer it was
created on or uploaded to was wrong. In cases like this I check out the
filesize and see if there's a change in the size of the file on my
harddisk and one of the other files.

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[I always use the timestamps for this and get irritated when a
	computer changes them.  However, I have made a listing of 
	the latest filenames, modification times and file sizes of
	the FTP files, which can be found in
	<A HREF="http://www.linuxgazette.net/ftpfiles.txt">
	<STRONG>ftpfiles.txt</STRONG> on the main site</A> or
	<A HREF=../ftpfiles.txt>on your mirror</A>.  At the top of the
	file is a timestamp.  
	
	<P> I will experiment with providing a history of changes.  If this is
	feasable, it will debut in the February issue.  If not, I'll just leave
	it as a listing of the latest files.
	
	<P> Further suggestions regarding how to make this file more

<BR>Subject: Translation of message posted to pl.comp.os.linux

<P> I think it may be interested for all linux users.

<P> This is a translation of letter posted to news group pl.comp.os.linux from
06.12.99  Message-ID: &lt;944515958.158951857@129.0.0.231&gt;

<P> I would like to announce that as of 6 December 1999, the standard operating
system of Jan III Sobieski Hotel (as per Manager's orders) is Linux and office
software is StarOffice. As of now, all files will be delivered in the OS format
using ISO8859-2 encoding. And now more seriously. As of today, the official
operating system in Jan III Sobieski Hotel is Linux and SO. The system
comprises 120 computers (servers, work stations, etc.) of which 9 in the
BC and HR have Windows (payroll, HR - temporarily), Business Centre
for guest convenience but Linux can also be used if requested. The installed
software includes various releases from Linux, RedHat, SuSE, Mandrake, LX
router, StarOffice, HS Partner and others.  In order not to be accused of
boasting, I would like to stress that a number of people made an enormous
contribution to the project with me acting solely as the initial spark and the
driving force behind their efforts.  Apart from my closest colleagues, Piotr
and Marek, the Linux project team in the hotel involved PKFL - Cezar with his
"enlightened advice", HS PartnerProtest employees with Waldek and Piotr who
acted as the fly-wheel behind the project, the invaluable Romek (I will always
remember the 7 drivers of the apocalypse), Boczi who can work miracles with
just one cable and two ports, Marcin, Maciek, Jacek Kijewski of Softomat, the
CHIEF (spelled only in capitals) who is a walking encyclopedia of Linux
knowledge and a master of black humour (such as we had sex today, but whatever
we touched went f...ing wrong), Dooszek (the man of six dimensions - I have no
idea how he does it, but he sees to the needs of ten users at a time) and
Andrzej - the power of peace.  I would like to apologise to all those I have
not mentioned but who helped me tremendously - I had to keep the list short for
lack of space.  Last but not least, big thanks to all managers who trusted me
and the penguin and to hotel employees who showed angelic patience when I
experimented on them.  Please forgive me for getting soppy, but I wanted to
show you that our success had many fathers. Teamwork can work wonders if you
have a clear goal, even a seemingly impossible one.

<P> PS
Special thanks to Dariusz Knocinski and Andrzej Pluta, they show me the way :).

<P> Best regards from Poland. :)

<BR>Subject: New design

<P> Hi there I was looking at the gazzete site and I find it verry good,
except the design. It looks like #^*@"%&amp;*"
And I am a free lance webdesigner and I thought why not do a freebee.
Why not offer you to design you a new site for free. 

<P> Well hope to hear from you soon

<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>
	[Hi.  Thanks for your offer.  We have also been thinking of ideas
	for improving the site, but have not finalized anything yet.  Major
	changes will have to be agreed to not just by me, but by the entire
	company that produces the Gazette, with an eye toward consistency with
	our other web sites.  So, it would be best if you could tell me your
	suggestions first, and then we can put them on our brainstorm list.

	<P> A few criteria we're keeping in mind:
	<UL>
	<LI> The Gazette is unique because of its distributed nature: it has
	to be readable on a wide variety of mirrors and CD-ROMs whose hardware
	and OSes we do not control.

	<LI> Many of our readers pay by the minute for their online time, so
	even adding a megabyte to the size of the Gazette (e.g., lots of
	additional graphics) is a major expense for them.

	<LI> Readers use a wide variety of browsers, including older versions.
	Browsers include Netscape, IE, Opera, lynx, emacs, kfm, Mozilla, all
	the experimental free browsers, etc, etc.

	<LI> Thus, we want to stick really close to standard HTML as the
	least common denominator.  One day we will switch to style sheets, but
	not in the near future, because we don't want to fight with the
	browsers and how they mis-apply styles.  (We have seen some spectacular
	examples of unusable pages due to styles.)  We are also resistant to
	Javascript for the same reason.

	<LI> We also stay away from depending on CGI, because it would
	require special setup on the mirrors' part, and couldn't run at all on
	CD-ROMs.  We have allowed a few CGI scripts to sneak in (the search
	engine, the mirror mail-in form), but these work only on the main site,
	and we want to keep CGI scripts to a minimum.  We have considered going
	to an all-dynamic site (e.g., Zope-powered), but again that does not
	seem feasable at present without destroying the <I>Gazette</I>'s
	distribution infrastructure, which is what makes the <I>Gazette</I>
	unique as well as so widely read, and which allows the <I>Gazette</I>
	to be included in the <I>Linux Documentation Project</I> mirrors.


	<LI> The Gazette is quite popular as it is, and we don't want to lose
	that readership by making changes they might not like.  Thus, we prefer
	to make changes incrementally rather than all at once.  One recent
	change I did was to put the navigation bar both at the top and bottom
	of the article, rather than just at the bottom.  Besides that, most of
	my work recently has been behind the scenes, making the Gazette easier
	to generate, using, e.g., configuration files and Python scripts to
	generate the article headers and the table of contents rather than
	doing it all by editing HTML.  Which makes building the Gazette more
	fun and also minimizes dead links when typos appear.
	</UL>

	<P> Given this, if you have any particular suggestions, I'd be happy to
	hear them.  -Ed.]
