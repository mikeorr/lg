Some Meditations Upon The Evils of Unconsidered Questions

The good querent's checklist

<BLOCKQUOTE> [Ben]
And Now, Cometh The Rant. Not to worry - it's not directed at anybody;
this is just a personal peeve that addresses a common problem, here, in
various places on Usenet, in tech support, etc. It also seems to be
prevalent in the Linux community at large, and that's a trend I'd like to
reverse, or at least contribute to slowing down.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Note that I speak only for myself - neither LG nor the rest of the Answer
Gang have contributed their opinions to this (though they'd be more than
welcome.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Being part of the Answer Gang, as well as the Alpha Geek and Supreme Guru
in other venues, I get questions about Linux, Life, and the Universe
almost daily. Usually, the questions fall into one of two categories:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
"Hi, I want to know about [Linux, brain surgery, love, astrophysics]."
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Hi. I have a Pentium 266/64MB/6.4GB running <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> Linux 2.2. I've just
installed Mutt (version 1.0.1i) with PGP support built in - I
double-checked by running "mutt -v", and it does. I'm getting a message -
here, I wrote it down - it says "pgp: ^GRequires a later version", and I
can't read the PGP-encoded e-mail that was sent to me. I've checked the
PGP site at MIT and I do indeed have the latest version, 2.6.3a-7. Could
you help me?"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My response to the first type, if indeed I do make one, is "Go away." My
response to the second one is "Marry me!!!" (this has required building a
much larger house, but never mind. There are very few of the second kind,
anyway.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The presumption in the first type is extremely annoying. It has driven a
number of people, some of them True Gurus of their respective crafts, off
Usenet and into virtual e-mail seclusion. There are many, many people out
there who think nothing of asking a person they don't know to put in hours
of work - it's one of the unfortunate side effects of easy communication
provided by Net access. I would suggest that these folks walk into a
lawyer's office and demand free help. (I would actually enjoy being a fly
on the wall at <EM>that</EM> conference, short and loud as it may be.) There are
indeed a number of us willing to provide free help - but in general,
leeches and time moochers aren't welcome. Making sure you aren't one isn't
that difficult - it simply takes consideration and common sense.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, rather than ranting on about the manifold evils of this, let me
contribute something substantial here: to wit, a checklist. This applies
to TAG questions - and hopefully, to other issues. May it lead to greater
consideration for others, a more harmonious life on the Net, and eternal
World Peace. Or at least fewer wives and a smaller house.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] I have tried my best to resolve this problem with the knowledge and
tools that I have at hand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] I have tried my best to extend my understanding of the problem by
studying the list of of Linux HOWTOs, searching the Net for relevant
keywords, and scanning past issues of LG.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] I have performed the above two steps at least twice, in that order.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] Now that I can proceed no further, despite all my study and effort, I
have done my utmost to put my question into a clear, understandable
form. This also means that I have given all applicable information,
have been specific about version/type/machine specifics, etc.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] I have also considered ways in which other people may misunderstand my
question, and have rephrased it to avoid those misunderstandings. I have
also used a spellchecker, lest my meaning be unclear in that manner.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] I have used the sacred 40 characters of "Subject" wisely, not wasting
them on garbage like "NEWBIE NEEDS HELP!!!!" but thoughtfully choosing
a good introduction, like "gcc dies with sig11 on kernel compilation".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] Only <EM>now</EM> have I hit the 'send' key. If someone expends their valuable
time and effort to help me, I shall show my gratitude, if and when I

	height="50" width="60" alt="(!) " border="0"
> [Heather] My own rant comes courtesy of a querent who sent his mail in 
every single month until we answered him.  Being the second month in a row 
that happened I figure, it's time to say something about it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A fair percentage of the Linux world reads our stuff.  Every month.  You
really <strong>don't</strong> want to know how many questions we get.  Our 
Senior Editor has mentioned that about 28% of the stuff we get is spam.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is after you consider our procmail defenses; some of the lint trap
contents *aren't* spam, it's questions for the Gang, and our sysadmin
eventually forwards those to us.  (Poor guy.  Dan not only reads TAG and
answers stuff, he keeps our lists running, our web servers humming, and has
to read through all our spam in case it might be a real question.  Sigh.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Of the stuff that isn't "real" spam, I'd say well over 10% is questions which
are not about Linux at all.  Sometimes not even about computers!  (I've
stopped publishing any offtopic stuff unless more than one of us thinks it
ought to go in.)  The remainder is still huge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, we can't promise to answer every single question -- and we <em>can't</em>
anyway.  So while I have to hand it to this guy for his perseverence in the
face of silence... we still can't promise to answer every single question!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
But I will add for the benefit of those who send us the tricky ones and hope
that we'll help them out, that the following features in his mail seriously
delayed this fellow's answer:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
	<img src="../../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" alt=":(" 
	align="bottom" border="0">
  He used almost no paragraph structure.  Even if he'd gotten the paragraphs
a little wrong, it would have made the question easier to read.
</BLOCKQuote>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<img src="../../gx/dennis/unsmily.gif" alt=":(" 
	align="bottom" border="0">
  He sent it as inline HTML... not even plaintext plus an attachment.
Most mailers under Linux do NOT deal with inline HTML automatically, and the
combination meant his mail remained unanswered.  Sadly, a lot of spam does
this - you might get deleted out of hand by the Answer Gang when it arrives
in our mailboxes, if we're just too overloaded to deal with that sort of mail.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
During formatting of this month's mail I have noticed a nasty trend, some
webmail accounts but almost every Outlook Express mail has come in as "quoted
printable".  Now this is a mail encoding that is supposed to exist to protect
special text ... say, something written in spanish ... from being mangled
by the mail routers or cheap mail clients while being bounced around.
(Hi Felipe!)  However, when neither the original mail nor the HTML version
has such weird characters, it only serves to annoy the heck out of my scripts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have to give credit to a lot of our querents this month who didn't get
answers - for many it's not because you've failed at Ben's suggestions,
but we of the Gang either didn't feel adept at tackling your question this
time around, or we were all busy helping others.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So add to your checklist...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] If my message is long and rambly I will insert blank lines when I am
changing thoughts.  If it's hard for you, you can try a blank line between
each of these:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><ul>
<li> what type of system and linux I have
<li> what I'm trying to do
<li> how it's screwed me up so far
<li> things I tried to look up so I could fix it
<li> guesses at what next, and thanks for any clues.
</ul></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] I have turned off the HTML attachment since it sends 3 or 4 times as
many bits, and doesn't help when it gets there.  I am sending plain
ASCII text.  (I'm not, however, afraid of using smileys and unhappy
faces to express cheer and frustration.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
[x] If I am writing in a foreign language I will use quoted printable to
defend my homeland's letterset from being mangled, and if I know any
English at all I will tranlate it myself rather than wait a month or
so extra for the translators to get to my mail.

I'm hoping that someone here can make me a doctor in a USENET
posting.  I'm not going to give you any clues as to my background,
so you won't know if I've taken high school biology, undergraduate
pre-med, or even a Red Cross first aid course.  I won't go out to
a book store and read a few books on medicine, biology, nursing,
or anything like that --- or if I have read any of them I won't
mention it so YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT ALL TO ME FROM SCRATCH!

May, are you starting to get the idea of how absurd your questions
are?  Broad expertise is not something that can be imparted in a
few hundred lines of Internet posting.  Your questions are not
specific enough for a real expert to answer in a reasonable space
(whole books are written on each of these topics).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, let's try this:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
Go <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/things/36e6.html">get</a>
	<a href="http://www.admin.com/"
	>Unix System Administrator's Handbook</a> by Evi Nemeth et al.
(3rd Edition, Prentice Hall) --- that's commonly called the
"Grape Book" because the cover is purple.  The first two editions
were widely referred as "the cranberry book" because the first
had a cartoon with a reference to a cranberry patch on it and the
second had a modified version of that cartoon (no patch) but was a
dark red color that is reminiscent of cranberry juice.
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Read it!  USAH is not Solaris specific, but it should give you a
good overview of UNIX systems administration.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
While you're at the book store, get a copy of 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/esa2/">Essential System
Administration</a> (Aeleen Frisch, O'Reilly &amp; Associates, 2nd Ed).
This is often called "The Armadillo Book" because, in the O'Reilly
tradition, it has a woodcut styled picture of an armadillo on the cover.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Read it!  It is also not Solaris specific.  See the penultimate
(next to last) paragraph.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If I haven't irritated you enough, pick up a copy of my
book, <a href="http://www.newriders.com/books/title.cfm?isbn=1562059343"
	>Linux System Administration</a> (M Carling, Stephen Degler,
and Jim Dennis (me)).  It's also not about Solaris, but most of
what it says is applicable to all UNIX platforms.  My book doesn't
duplicate much of what you'd find in Nemeth or Frisch.  I wrote
it in a context of having read those (and many others) and specifically
avoided covering the topics that were adequately covered in the
more basic books.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After you have a thorough grounding in systems administration, then
you can learn a bit more specifically about UNIX security and then
you can focus on Solaris security.  If you find a shortcut that's
really effective, let us know.  However, you should expect to read
about a half dozen fairly large books from cover to cover.  There
will be a test (every day on the job is a bit of a test in our
field).

There are chapters that relate to each of your questions, and there

Lynx bookmarks file).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the topic of security I'd recommend three titles to start
with:  <a href="http://www.accu.org/bookreviews/public/reviews/p/p001022.htm"
	>Practical UNIX and Internet Security</a> by Simson Garfinkel,
and Gene Spafford (O'Reilly, 2nd Ed.), 
<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/fire2/"
	>Building Internet Firewalls</a>
by Brent Chapman, Elizabeth Zwicky, and Simon Cooper (O'Reilly, 2nd Ed.)
and <a href="http://www.weyrich.com/book_reviews/firewalls_security.html"
	>Firewalls and Internet Security: Foiling The Wily Hacker</a> by
Steven Bellovin and William Cheswick (Addison Wesley?).  I've heard a
rumor that a second edition of the latter title is going to be released
soon.  (I've been holding out on buying a new copy; mine walked off a
few years ago).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(BTW: you might have noticed that most of the books on my list
are in second editions or later.  I expect that my own book would
also benefit from further revision --- but only time will tell
if the publishers have the interest).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Read all of those.  Then get a few books that are more specific to
Solaris.  I've read through both of Janic Windsor's books (<EM>Solaris
 System Administrator's Guide</EM> and <EM>Solaris Advanced 
 System Administrator's Guide</em>) but I mostly don't use Solaris
any more.  The few Solaris and SunOS boxes I ever professionally
administered are fading memories.

All of them.  Actually Solaris installs a whole bunch
of crap that you don't care about and will never use.
However, you haven't given <EM>any</EM> details about what
machines you have, or what they're doing.  Thus no one
in this newsgroup could know what paths you could
probably ignore. (Unless this is the secret hobby of
the "psychic friends network").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since you are asking this in the context of comp.unix.security
I can guess that you're really intended to ask something
more like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
How would I know if an attacker has compromised my
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
system?  What files are likely to be modified by a
cracker?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This suggests that you'd like to install file integrity test
system or an intrusion detection system (IDS).  You could
get a copy of Tripwire (by Gene Kim and Gene Spafford) which
started as a free tool and is now maintained as a commercial
product by Gene Kim's company at: <A HREF="http://www.tripwiresecurity.com"
	>http://www.tripwiresecurity.com</A>)
You could also look at AIDE (which is basically a freeware
clone of Tripwire).  AIDE (<A HREF="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html"
	>http://www.cs.tut.fi/~rammer/aide.html</A>).
is more popular among Linux, and *BSD users, but it will run on
Solaris and should run on any other modern UNIX.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	>
What are the logs or system logs do I require to checked or backup?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [JimD]
I don't know.  Does Solaris still use <TT>/var/adm/messages</TT> (like
SunOS did)?  I do know that your <TT>/etc/syslog.conf</TT> should have
information that tells the system logging daemon where to store
different messages from various facilities.  You should be able
to read that file, and its man pages to figure it out for yourself.
That should work on most UNIX systems.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On most forms of UNIX you could even modify your <TT>/etc/syslog.conf</TT>
to force it to copy certain types of messages to another system
on your network or to a printer, through a serial line to a terminal
or to another system.  These sorts of customizations can provide
you with a tamper resistant copy of your messages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Setting up remote loghosts is considered to be a useful security
measure.  If the loghost is sufficiently hardened and dedicated
it can consolidate copies of your logs and prevent the (otherwise
successful) attacker from "covering his or her tracks" by editing
the evidence out of the logs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
You can also create cron jobs that periodically scan your
logs looking for anomalous entries, filtering out all the
innocuous messages and mailing, printing or otherwise delivering
the summaries to you.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In my book I give a very simple (10 line) awk script that loads
a file full of patterns (regular expressions) and filters a
file of all of them.  It is an extremely simple anomaly detection
engine.  The hard part of using it is creating a list of patterns
to meet your needs.  Maintaining the pattern files for each of
your logs is made more challenging by the fact that upgrades to your
OS and other software can affect the messages that they generate.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
On many UNIX systems you can look for a "logger" command
(<TT>/usr/bin/logger</TT>, or <TT>/bin/logger</TT>) so that your shell scripts
can easily post their own syslog messages.  There are also
modules and extensions to PERL, and Python (and probably others)
that let you natively post messages to the system logs from
scripts in those languages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are also replacements to the stock UNIX syslog system.
So you could rip out the Solaris syslog daemon and install
syslog-NG or some other package.  That might offer better
reliability (using TCP rather than UDP) security that
conforms more closely to your needs (using encrypted tunnels
for example) or more flexibility (letting you dispatch and
filter based on regular expression rather than simple
facility/level codes).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously none of that last paragraph will make any sense
until you understand how the conventional UNIX syslog system
works.  Go read those books and a few of the man pages on your
system!

This amounts to a question like:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQuote>
What parts of Solaris really suck?
</BLOCKQuote></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My answer is: "I don't know. Read the FAQ."  I'm an expert on
Linux, and I can tell you the parts of it that can be problematic
for UNIX and Solaris users as they adopt it.  (For example, if
you were among the few people who actually use ACLs --- access
control lists --- under Solaris or some other OS than you might
find that Linux' lack of them in their standard kernels and
distributions "really sucks."  You might also hold that having
to fetch and apply an unofficial kernel patch, rebuild your
kernel, and install an extra set of utilities also "really sucks").
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Again, the FAQ (and some strategic lurking in this newsgroup and
on some of the mailing lists that are recommended in the FAQs)
will answer that question.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><STRONG><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/qbub.gif" ALT="(?)"

What are the things to backup for system recovery, if there's any?
</STRONG></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="../../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"

Everything.  Here's another case where the psychic friends might
be able to help you; but where you haven't give us enough
information to do so.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Recovery planning is one of the most important jobs of a system
administrator.  Doing backups is a part of a recovery plan, but
it's ONLY A PART.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
As I've mentioned in this post, I'm not a Solaris expert.
I could write a 30 page HOWTO on doing Linux backups
(in fact, I did, sort of; it's the latter half of chapter
3 in my book).  Most of it would be the same under Solaris
--- you have your choice of tar, cpio and dump (ufsdump under
Solaris, I guess).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, it is often as effective to know how to look for
answers than to know the answers themselves.  In this case
I searched the FAQ (see above) and found that Casper had
failed me.  Apparently it's not frequently asked enough
on the Solaris/SunOS newsgroups.  There is a passing
reference to the Solstice Backup documentation on the
"AnswerBook" CDs that ship with Solaris.  Perhaps that
would be handy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Next I went to Google.  Google (<A HREF="http://www.google.com"
	>http://www.google.com</A>) is
currently the best search engine on the 'net.  I used the
terms: solaris backup.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here's the best couple of links I found:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Obviously, I'm not a Solaris expert.  Luckily Solaris is UNIX and
I am pretty good at that.  Most generic UNIX knowlege will serve you
as well on Solaris, Linux, <A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</A>, etc as it would on a SCO or other
system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whether the answers I've given to your specific questions make any
sense depends on your background.  If my references to tripwire,
ufsdump, syslog facilities and levels, FAQs, man pages were confusing
then you don't yet have the background to be a professional sysadmin.
Go through USAIL, read the books I've suggested.  If those are too
advanced and confusing then try more basic ones like Mark G. Sobell's
<EM>Practical Guide to Solaris</em> (<A HREF="http://www.sobell.com"
	>http://www.sobell.com</A>) or
<EM>Unix for the Impatient</em> by Paul Abrahams and Bruce Larson.
(Actually if USAIL is too advanced, then give up and start flipping
burgers somewhere!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Meanwhile, for your immediate needs you may want to hire a consultant
to audit your current production systems, do <EM>AND TEST</EM> a full set of
backups and to disable any unnecessary networking services and generally
configure you system until you've learned enough to manage it yourself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfortunately finding a good consultant is difficult.  There are
alot of snake oil salesmen and any decent huckster can wow you with
technobabble that's indistinguishable from good advice. To the untrained
ear; they sound the same.  I can't help you much there.  (I'm not
available as a consultant these days, and I wouldn't be the right person
for your Solaris boxes anyway.  My wife is a UNIX/Linux consultant and
she does offer a "phone technical interview" service --- where she can
interview your prospective consultant or sysadmin over the phone and
give you an evaluation of their UNIX proficiency).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lastly:  If you're going to become a professional Solaris sysadmin
you'll want to have a copy on at least one NON-PRODUCTION system.
You want to be able to experiment and to break things without
disrupting your real business processes.  If you're sure that you
want to stick with Solaris then it would make sense to participate
in Sun's  "Free Solaris[tm] Binary License Program"
<A HREF="http://www.sun.com/developers/tools/solaris"
	>http://www.sun.com/developers/tools/solaris</A> (although their
meaning of "free" is a bit loose since their CD will cost you $75
--- and they don't let you modify/sell copies of that!).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Personally I prefer Linux, FreeBSD (and <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</A> and <A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</A>) where
"free" means you can download the ISO image and burn it to your
own CD, you can buy the CD sets for prices ranging from $2 to about
$100, and most of those you could copy and resell if you wanted to,
and you get the source code and the right to make changes and
redistribute your own custom versions of the software.  That's a
version of "free" that seems more liberated n'est ce pas?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For hardware you have two choices: get Solaris x86 and install it
on a PC; or get a SPARC system.  You can get used SPARC systems on
eBay or other online auction sites for anywhere from $50 to $200
for old 32-bit SPARC classics, IPXs etc, to $500-2,000 for
64-bit UltraSPARC I and II systems.  Caveat emptor!

So, that's the Linux Gazette "Answer Guy's" guide to becoming
a Solaris security and system adminstration professional.
