<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Ian Murdock, Sun, Unveil Project Indiana</h3>

<p>
In effort to grow its open source Solaris community, Sun launched an
effort to make the Solaris OS more like Linux distros. Ian Murdock,
founder of the Debian distro and Linux company Progeny, explained the
details to Sun partners and the press in July, and in the process
revealed more about his role at Sun since being hired there.</p>

<p>
Murdock had spoken to a packed session at JavaOne, last May, and talked
in general terms of improving the packaging and content of Solaris to
make it friendlier to the Open Source community. Project Indiana is that
effort, and adds a road map for Solaris developers.</p>

<p>
Murdock spoke about the similarities and differences of Linux and Solaris,
noting the "distro" model as a Linux "innovation" for users and
developers.   Both Solaris and Linux support GNOME and the X Window
System, office and Web apps, he noted.  "Right now, it's confusing.  If
you want to compile Open Solaris, you need to use Solaris Express
Community Edition first," according to Murdock.  "Originally, Linux
didn't have a binary deliverable, so I and others stepped up."</p>

<p>
Project Indiana aims to combine the best of both the Solaris and
Linux worlds. With Murdock on-board, Sun has been looking at the distro
and package model that is now intrinsic to Linux.  Open Solaris will
have a developer community, while still having enterprise-grade support
from Sun and its partners. Sun hopes users of Open Solaris will
eventually convert to full enterprise support licenses.</p>

<p>
"We will provide Open Solaris as a binary distro, with a strong focus on
unique Solaris features and the famous Solaris compatibility." The main
features of Indiana will include an easier install, ZFS as default file
system, and Net-based package management.</p>

<p>
"We are competing in the same sense that RH competes with Debian, or
Ubuntu competes with Debian. We are growing the Open Source
environment," Murdock explained. "We can bridge the gap for developers,
but we have to give them some compelling reasons to cross over. We have
an opportunity here to provide the same level of choice that Linux has
provided, but without the fracture..." Murdock added.  </p>

<p>
Project Indiana will be for developers and early adopters, with short
6-month release cycles, while Enterprise Solaris will have long release
cycles. It will be a 2-tier model, with a dev tier more like the Linux
model.  The first Indiana release is planned for the Spring of 2008,
with an earlier test release to selected users in the Fall of 2007.</p>

<p>
Murdock was more closed when discussing the issue of open source
licenses.  First, he said, that was under consideration, and would 
be decided by others at Sun.  He did note that the criteria would
include what was best for Sun, its partners, and the Solaris community.
</p>

<p>
"We are very focused on the technology parts of this. I don't tend to
find licensing discussions very interesting. To me, licenses are a
necessary evil. The real question is... is the fact that Solaris is not
under GPL going to matter? My view on the license changes is that if it
benefits Sun and the OS community, we should do it.  Another way of
looking at this is...  we could take the device driver code in Linux,
and help make the driver support in Solaris much better than it is
today.  So, that to me is a reason to GPL Solaris. The ability to borrow
code could be an advantage, but then our code can also be used."
Murdock added that the decision process would have to include the
growing developer community for Open Solaris.  In May and June, Sun CEO
Jonathon Schwartz expressed a strong interest in the new GPL v3, but
seems to be backing away from that position more recently.  </p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">$100 Laptop for 3rd World Kids Delayed, but Intel Joins the Party</h3>

<p>
At the Usenix '07 Technical Conference in June, Mary Lou Jepson, CIO of
One Laptop Per Child (OLPC), detailed progress on the hardware and
software development of this new portable computing platform, and
explained that the first mass shipments to Third World countries was
planned for the end of summer.  That has now been pushed back to October,
to accommodate fixes and new features and to wait for the required 3
million-order threshold.  (The first generation units will cost
$150-175, but will approach the $100 goal over the next year.)</p>

<p>
Intel, whose executives had strongly criticized the non-standard
technology and novel approach of OLPC, buried the conflict with OLPC in
July and joined its board in July. Intel has what it sees as a competing
effort with its "Classmate" mini-laptop design, based on Windows and
Intel chipsets.  (There is also an option to use Mandriva.)  The target
price for the "Classmate" is about $300, but includes newly developed
educational software. A fuller description of this PC is here:  <a
href="http://www.classmatepc.com/">http://www.classmatepc.com</a>
</p>

<p>
In contrast, OLPC uses the open source development model, and is trying
to develop a system that Third World kids and their teachers can support
and fix themselves.  The OS is a reduced version of Red Hat Linux, and
many design changes have been incorporated from Third World pilot testers,
to support tropical environments, erratic power, the likelihood of
laptops falling on stone or concrete floors, etc. The keyboard is sealed
to allow use in rainy environments. New designs in the LCD design and
graphics controller allow the laptop screen to be scrolled without CPU
involvement, and used in direct sunlight with only .1 watt per hour power
consumption. That allows an OLPC unit with a charged battery to run all
day and all night. There are also hand-powered generators and solar
charging stations for classroom use.  (Who wouldn't want one of these
for camping or car trips?)  The XO is also the greenest PC, in terms of
manufacturing and recycling.  </p>

<p>
The OLPC "XO" units employs an efficient dual antenna, and automatically
creates an inter-meshed peer-peer network across a village, with line of
sight distances of up to half a kilometer between units. There is also
learning software for kids called "Sugar" that is still in development.
Linux kernel developers and software engineers are encouraged to join in
different parts of this community project.  Here is the link to sign up:
<a href="http://wiki.laptop.org">http://wiki.laptop.org</a>.  </p>

<p>
The OLPC keynote is now available on the Usenix conference archive (<a
href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix07/tech/slides/jepsen.pdf">http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix07/tech/slides/jepsen.pdf</a>).
Photos from the presentation are available here:  <a
href="http://picasaweb.google.com/howarddy/Usenix07OLPC">picasaweb.google.com/howarddy/Usenix07OLPC</a>.
OLPC is based on learning theories pioneered by Seymour Papert and Alan
Kay.  </p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Intel Hosts Moblin.org
Site for Linux Mobility Developers</h3>

<p>
Moblin.org is the site that hosts the Mobile &amp; Internet Linux
Project open source community. The site allows developers to prototype
new ideas, and build community around them.  Intel has also garnered
support from vendors Canonical and Red Flag Linux.  </p>

<p>
Currently, <a href="http://www.moblin.org"
title="moblin.org">moblin.org</a> hosts a number of projects, including
an Image Creator, Browser, UI framework, power policy manager, and
various non-PC-oriented applications and software components.  </p>

<p>
"Linux on mobile devices has gotten a lot of traction in the last few
years," says Dirk Hohndel, Intel's chief Linux and open source
technologist. "Moblin.org will help to improve the integration of many
of the existing components targeted at such devices, and should help
foster development of new use models and new features. In particular,
both power management and UI need to be fine-tuned for these new form
factors, and that is an area where development at moblin.org has already
shown good results." </p>


<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Python Database Tool
First Open Source Component of Launchpad</h3>

<p>
Canonical has released Storm, a generic open source object relational
mapper (ORM) for Python. Storm is designed to support communication with
multiple databases simultaneously. Canonical is known for the popular
Ubuntu operating system and Launchpad, a Web-based collaboration
platform for open source developers.  </p>

<p>
"Storm is an ORM that simplifies the development of database-backed
applications in Python, especially for projects that use very large
databases or multiple databases with a seamless Web front-end", said
Gustavo Niemeyer, lead developer of Storm at Canonical. "Storm is
particularly designed to feel very natural to Python programmers, and
exposes multiple databases as /stores/ in a clean and easy-to-use
fashion." </p>

<p> The project has been in development for more than a year, and is now
publicly available under the LGPL license. This is the first complete
Launchpad component to be released as open source software. Launchpad
currently includes developer data for several thousand projects, and is
used by tens of thousands of developers and other free software
contributors.  </p>

<p> The Storm project welcomes participation, and has a new Web site at
<a href="http://storm.canonical.com/">http://storm.canonical.com</a>.
That site includes a tutorial, and links to allow developers to
download, report bugs, and join the mailing list.  </p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Personal Package Archive
Service, Free Space for Ubuntu Developers</h3>

<p>
Canonical also announced the beta release of the Launchpad Personal
Package Archive (PPA) service, a new way for developers to build and
publish packages of their code, documentation, and other contributions
to free software.  </p>

<p>
Individuals and teams can each have a PPA, allowing groups to
collaborate on sets of packages, and solo developers to publish their
own versions of popular free software. Developers upload packages to a
PPA, and have it built for multiple architectures against the current
version of Ubuntu. Each user gets up to one gigabyte of Personal Package
Archive space, which works as a standard Ubuntu software package
repository. Free PPAs are available only for free ("libre") software
packages.  </p>

<p>
Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Ubuntu, explained the significance of
Launchpad Personal Package Archives for the Ubuntu community: "Many
developers want to modify existing packages, or create new packages of
their software. The PPA service allows anyone to publish a package,
without having to ask permission or join the Ubuntu project as a
developer. This is a tremendous innovation in the free software
community." </p>

<p>
The Launchpad PPA service is currently in beta. To participate in the
beta program, send an e-mail to ppa-beta@launchpad.net.  </p>

<p>
Launchpad PPA Service will be released for general use on August 22,
2007, and will be available at <a
href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas">https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas</a>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">The Commonwealth of
Massachusetts Adds Open XML Document Format</h3>

<p>
The great state of Massachusetts had come out of the wilderness like a
latter-day Solomon, and decided to support both Microsoft's Office Open
XML format and the OASIS Open Document Format that it has previously
supported.  The decision to adopt the ECMA version of Open XML was made
in early July, and is part of the Massachusetts Enterprise Technical
Reference Model (ETRM) 4.0, a specification for the state's IT
operations. The draft listed ECMA-376 as one of its major revisions.
Earlier, the ETRM specified only ODF as a standard, open format.  </p>

<p>
Since its original adoption of ODF, two of the state's CIOs have been
forced to resign.  </p>

<p>
Microsoft has been lining up Linux distros to be part of the Open XML
Translator project, which is hosted on SourceForge. Currently, these
include Linspire, Novell, and Xandros.  <a
href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/financial/sun.html">Sun</a> has
also released its own Plugin ODF translator for Office. The state IT
group took these efforts into account during its deliberations.  </p>

<p>
The Linux Foundation has challenged the decision, saying  "... it is
wrong for the ITD to conclude that a specification that helps to
perpetuate the dominance of a single product can be properly called a
true open standard", and it encouraged concerned members of the open
source community to send their comments to the Massachusetts ITD at <a
href="mailto:standards@state.ma.us">standards@state.ma.us</a>.  </p>

<p>
Linux Foundation board member Andrew Updegrove wrote to the
Massachusetts IT Department, asking them to consider the public and
historical impacts, "It is also important to the future of open document
formats in the wider world, as well. The impact of Massachusetts in
rectifying the historical situation has already been profound. But it
has not been sufficient.  Earlier this decade, Microsoft properly looked
out for its stockholders' best interests by declining to participate in
the OASIS working group that created ODF, thereby increasing the
likelihood that ODF would die, and increasing the likelihood that its
dominance would continue. That decision was not, of course, the best
decision for end-users, including government purchasers, because it
perpetuated a situation where long-term access to important documents
was in the control of a single vendor. </p>

<p>
"But ODF did not die. Instead, it was completed, although it received
little attention, either publicly or among potential implementers. Only
with the announcement of the ITD's decision and the realization that a
market for ODF-compliant products might develop did interest broaden and
deepen. Microsoft is hardly to be blamed for lending no support to the
success of ODF. But neither should it be rewarded for launching a
competing, self-serving standard as a next-best defense against erosion
of its dominant position." </p>

<p>
This issue is important in itself for the future of open standards, but
the main battle is the September ballot in ISO on supporting OOXML. That
could derail ODF and a wider range of open standards.  </p>

created by OpenOffice.org can be saved in Open XML format. As a result, end
users of Microsoft Office and <a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> will now be able to
more easily share files, as documents will better maintain consistent
formats, formulas, and style templates across the two office
productivity suites.  </p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Sun Donates High Availability Cluster Code</h3>

<p>
Sun Microsystems has announced it will release the <a
href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/cluster/">Solaris Cluster</a>
source code through the <a
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/community/ha-clusters/">HA (High
Availability) Clusters community</a> on the <a
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/">OpenSolaris</a> site.  Sun's first
contributions are application modules, or agents, which enable open
source or commercially available applications to become highly available
in a cluster environment.  </p>
  
<p> The Open HA Cluster code will be made available in three phases,
beginning at the end of June and continuing over the next 18 months. In
the first phase of Open HA Cluster, Sun will deliver code for most of
the high-availability agents offered with the Solaris Cluster product.
Solaris Cluster's high-availability agents allow developers to
cluster-enable applications to run as either scalable or failover
services. Sun is also making available the source code for the Solaris
Cluster Automated Test Environment (SCATE), along with agent-related
documentation, to assist in testing new agents. The test framework and
first test suite will be contributed at the end of June 2007.  Among
these agents are the Solaris Containers agent, the BEA Weblogic agent,
and PostgreSQL.  </p>
  
<p> Agents written using Open HA Cluster will also run on Solaris
Cluster version 3.2 on the Solaris 10 OS. Subsequent phases of Open HA
Cluster will include delivery of the code for the recently released
Solaris Cluster Geographic Edition - software that enables multi-site
disaster recovery by managing the availability of application services
and data across geographically dispersed clusters. Later, Sun will
release the code for the core Solaris Cluster infrastructure, again with
SCATE infrastructure tests and documentation.  Sun is using the Common
Distribution and Development Licence (CDDL) for the code, as it
currently does for Solaris.  </p>

Clusters community on OpenSolaris, and to review a complete list of the
high-availability agents offered with the Solaris Cluster product,

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Samba Switches to GPL v3</h3>

<p>
Samba.org has announced that future distros will be released under the
new GPL v3.  Prior versions of Samba will remain under the GPL v2.  </p>

<p>
In the July announcement, Samba.org specified that all versions of Samba
numbered 3.2 and later will be under the GPLv3, whereas all versions of
Samba numbered 3.0.x and before will remain under the GPLv2.  But there
is a caveat, as noted in the FAQ about the licensing change: </p>

<p>
<em>"The Samba Team releases libraries under two licenses: the GPLv3 and
the LGPLv3. If your code is released under a "GPLv2 or later" license,
it is compatible with both the GPLv3 and the LGPLv3 licensed Samba
code.</em> </p>

<p>
<em>"If your code is released under a 'GPLv2 only' license, it is not
compatible with the Samba libraries released under the GPLv3 or LGPLv3,
as the wording of the 'GPLv2 only' license prevents mixing with other
licenses. If you wish to use libraries released under the LGPLv3 with
your 'GPLv2 only' code, then you will need to modify the license on your
code."</em> </p>

<p>
Zenoss, known for its existing free IT monitoring product Zenos Core 2
(released in June under GPL2, with all sub-projects under GPL or
compatible licenses), has released Zenoss Enterprise Edition 2.0 on top
of its Core 2 platform. Enterprise Edition 2.0 will provide all the same
features as its free, open source relative, but will provide "end-user
experience monitoring" for Web, e-mail, and database applications. This
allows IT managers to receive integrated user reports along with the
standard network and equipment statuses, while providing more depth to
the IT person's understanding of users' habits.  Zenoss is also
releasing custom ZenPacks - a plug-in framework that allows community
members to write their own features, skins, etc. - that will be
published only under their Enterprise Subscription. For more information on
Zenoss's products, subscriptions, and how they all relate to one another,

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">The Everex IMPACT GC3502 Features OpenOffice.org on Windows Vista</h3>

<p>
On July 28th, Everex announced that its IMPACT GC3502 PC will feature
the open-source office suite OpenOffice.org. Aimed at back-to-school
students, Everex is hoping to offer potentially low-budget consumers a
powerful, fully featured package. Most PC producers offer either 
proprietary, high-cost office suites, which sharply increases the cost
of the PC, or pre-installed trial software, which dissatisfies customers
and does not look good for the producer. Everex believes that by keeping
its prices low and its offers large it will get a jump start on its
competitors, this quickly approaching school year.  </p>

<p>
Everex IMPACT GC3502 specifications: <a

<p class="editorial">
[Editor's note: While I think it is wonderful that OpenOffice.org is
receiving more attention and more companies are seeing open source as
more than a server side solution, I am not entirely sure that
generations of Windows Office-trained users are ready for the switch.
Having used OpenOffice.org on Windows and Linux platforms in two
separate educational environments, now - both times as a student - I
remember experiencing some formatting issues when exporting .doc files,
which all my professors wanted, and printing. While I was easily able to
overcome them, this just added another level of frustration that may
prove too much for the average computer user. Also, most school's IT
departments that I have experienced will not support non-standard Mac
and Windows software. While OpenOffice.org has come leaps and bounds in
solving these transitional issues, I would not want to deploy a solution
in an office - or my grandparent's house - unless the basic
functionality translated seamlessly. -- S. Bisbee] </p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Network Engines Integrates Appliance-Optimized Linux Distribution</h3>

<p>
Network Engines, Inc., a provider of storage and security appliance
products and services, announced two software initiatives to help
software developers deliver applications as appliances. First, Network
Engines announced Appliance Certified Edition Linux (ACE Linux), the
first Linux distribution to deliver integrated lifecycle management for
server appliances.  Second, the company also announced that Network
Engines Web-based Services  -  NEWS - its hardware and image management
system for Windows-based application appliances, is now available for
ACE Linux.  </p>

<p>
Hardware and image management integration with an appliance-proven Linux
release should lower costs and speed time to market for Linux-based
appliances.  "As the appliance market grows, ISVs recognize that they
need to focus on adding value to their application, not the underlying
components like the OS and management plane," said Hugh Kelly, 
Vice-President of Marketing for Network Engines.  "We developed our Network
Engines Web-based Services to provide these functions for Windows
applications, and now we are making them available for Linux." </p>

<p>
ACE Linux is a Conary-based Linux distribution that will be customized
for each customer's platform.  Network Engines will provide full
platform support including drivers, which are commonly a drain on
development resources if ISVs attempt to implement these tools
themselves.  In addition, NEI will provide performance qualification for
all of its hardware platforms.  This combination of reduced footprint
and technical support will enable ISVs to deliver more secure appliances
with much lower development cost.  </p>

<p>
Kelly said that integrating NEWS with the company's own distribution of
Linux enables ISVs to save time, money, and engineering resources,
because Network Engines eliminates the burden of qualifying new OS
releases and the associated expense of update and patch distribution.
The NEWS infrastructure will enable all of the software on an appliance,
including the OS, applications, and management plane, to be managed by a
robust update management system.  </p>

<p>
Network Engines is the only company with a full suite of
appliance-related services for both Linux and Windows environments,
Kelly said.  "While ISVs focus on their core competencies, we provide
all the services they need to deliver their solutions as true appliances
in much less time," Kelly said.  </p>

product, version 4.0, in late August 2007.  </p>

<h3><img src="../gx/bolt.gif" alt="thunderbolt">Borland, VMware Advance Testing of Virtual Lab Environments</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.borland.com/">Borland Software Corporation</a>
announced an integration with VMware software, to enable enterprise
software development organizations to more cost-effectively perform
multi-configuration and cross-platform software application testing, by
maximizing the use of virtualization for test environments.  </p>

<p>
Borland will deliver native support for virtual lab environments, by
integrating its SilkCentral Test Manager, a core component of Borland's
Lifecycle Quality Management (LQM) solution, with VMware Lab Manager
version 2.5.  SilkCentral Test Manager 2007 will extend test management
with seamless access to virtualized test environments in VMware Lab
Manager, addressing a critical challenge to fully test applications
across multiple configurations and platforms.  </p>

<p>
With the ability to call VMware Lab Manager environments directly from
SilkCentral Test Manager, users can create and assign individual tests
to run on many different configurations or platforms, without the high
costs of hardware or time needed to administer physical systems.
</p>

<p> Expected availability for Borland SilkCentral Test Manager 2007 is
the third calendar quarter of 2007.  </p>

<p>

<p>
Sam was born ('87) and raised in the Boston, MA area. His interest in all
things electronic was established early by his electrician father and database
designer mother. Teaching himself HTML and basic web design at the age of 10,
Sam has spiraled deeper into the confusion that is computer science and the
FOSS community. His first Linux install was Red Hat, which he installed on a
Pentium 233GHz i686 when he was about 13. He found his way into the computer
club in high school at Northfield Mount Hermon, a New England boarding school,
which was lovingly named GEECS for Electronics, Engineering, Computers, and
Science. This venue allowed him to share in and teach the Linux experience to
fellow students and teachers alike. Late in high school Sam was abducted into
the Open and Free Technology Community, had his first article published, and
became more involved in the FOSS community as a whole. After a year at 
Boston University he decided the experience was not for him, striking out on
his own as a software developer and contractor.
