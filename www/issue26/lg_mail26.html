<P>
I like most people am the only person to use my linux system at home.
What I'd like to do is when my system is done booting to have me
automatically login as my main user account(not as root though) on one
virtual console(the first) and leave all other consoles and virtual
consoles alone, so that someone telnetting in will get a login prompt
like normal, just that I won't.  I'd still like the other vc's have
login's for others to login and other reasons.  I've tried just putting
/bin/sh in /etc/inittab and that didn't work, and I'm stumped.  Does
anyone have any ideas on this?

Subject: <B>Problems with Linux through Wingate Socks</B> 
<P>
I'm having a few problems accessing the internet through Wingate
v2.0 on my Windows95 machine using my Linux Redhat 4.2 installation.
I've had this SOCKS server set-up for quite some time on my internet
dial-out machine and have previously had no problems accessing the
internet through this server via my second machine's installation of
Windows95 or even WindowsNT.  The problem is directly related to DNS
lookups.  If I access a domain-name from my Linux machine that seems to
get redirected, I will receive an error that the DNS address does not
exist.  For instance, if I attempt to open the web page
http://www.kernel.org (which gets redirected to http://linux.kernel.org)
my browser (Netscape v4.04 for Linux 2.0* i386 rpm) reports a DNS
error.  However if I instead attempt to open the redirected web page
http://linux.kernel.org my browser will open it ok, without error.  I'm
baffled by this behavior and have tried a number of different things!  I
can provide more detailed information if needed.  Thanks in advance to
any who try to help!  ;)
<P>
I love Linux Gazette and have a great time browsing all the cool
suggestions and tips!  Keep up the ideas and info!

Subject: <B>Wanting HELP!</B> 
<P> 
First off:  I can *not* believe I am the only one bitten by this.
<P> 
In the process of getting a System installed I upgraded from the 
original CD-ROM install of (Intel) RedHat 4.2 to the new RedHat 5.0 
CD-ROM.  One of the significant items on this system is the mars-nwe 
Netware emulator.
<P> 
Under the RedHat 4.2 with mars-nwe 0.98pl8-1 the mars package ran fine, 
but logged copious errors about there being "too many connections -- 
increase the number in config.h".  But it ran, and I *liked* the way it 
happily did Netware duties!  (Especially the printer part.)
<P> 
The *new* RedHat 5.0 with mars-nwe 0.99pl2-1 offered some very desirable 
abilities, not the least of which is the move of some items (such as 
number of connections) to the run-time config file (/etc/nwserv.conf 
under RedHat, probably nw.ini on other distributions.)  Now the bad 
news...
<P> 
Of lesser, but still irritating, importance is the fact that the mars 
package won't shutdown without some hard kills.  This may be related to 
the really important problem which is:
<P> 
This new package spawns out nwconn processes with an empty parenthesis 
as the last token instead of the USERID ('nwconn ... ()') until all 
connection slots are eaten, and then, of course, will not recognize any 
new attempts.  Any users already logged into the nwserv(ice) are Ok.  
<P> 
Since I am neither a Netware guru nor a mars guru I can only hazard a 
guess, but since the nwconn(s) are children of the ncpserv daemon I 
suspect that ncpserv is the source of the troubles.
<P> 
I have tried every combination of parameter twiddling in the run-time 
config file that can think of, but to no avail.
<P> 
One thing I have noticed, the 2.0.32 linux kernel /usr/src/linux/.config 
no longer has the 'CONFIG_IPX_INTERN' setting (should be unset according 
to mars-nwe docs)  which existed in 2.0.27.  This may or may not have 
anything to do with the problem.  Checking the kernel sources, it 
appears that the RedHat rpm of the 2.0.32 kernel has the mars patches 
incorporated into the source.
<P> 
Anyone who has solved this problem, please share the secret.
<P> 
BTW:  I attempted resolution through the RedHat Support system as a 
registered RedHat customer, and if anybody wants a good laugh I'll be 
happy to share the "circle of correspondence" from RedHat support.  I 
did learn from the attempt that no *human* at RedHat actually ever sees 
the E-Mail to the support team or 'Bugs' team.  (The "auto answer" 
mechanism will get right back to you, though, and tell you not to expect 
an answer.)
<P> 
As I said, I can *not* believe I am the only one bitten by this, because 
I've looked on the news groups and seen several posts with "Mars and 
RedHat 5.0" in the Subject fields.  These were all on the French 
os.linux.... lists, and unfortunately I do not read French!
<P> 
Sorry for the rambling on...<BR>

Subject: <B>Retraction Re: Linux and routing</B> 
<p>
It was just called to my attention that this came across a little to
strongly and I'd like to clarify what I had previously written.
<p>
On Tue, 6 Jan 1998, I wrote:
<blockquote> <I> 
Some words of caution.  DO NOT HAVE YOUR LAN CONNECTED AT THE TIME OF
THE CABLE MODEM INSTALLATION!!!!  [Comapany names removed],
and most of the other cable companies (we deal with them all here)
will refuse to connect a LAN to their broadband network.  Simply
remove your hub or coax cable from view, and let them do what they
need to do, then connect everything else up after they leave.  
</I> </blockquote> 
<p>
This was probably a little of an overstatement.  I know only of 1 company
that has this as a policy, but have heard of people having problems with
some of the others.  I have even recently been informed of one company
that is *quite* Linux friendly and will "encourage the use of Linux as
firewall/routers" as well as "allow and assist individuals & companies to
setup there own Web servers, either at their permises or ours.  We offer
web hosting and will assist in registering a domain name".  So, I
obviously made an improper, blanket statement which does not represent the
attitudes or policies of all companies.
 <blockquote> <I> 
Some other interesting tidbits of information about cable modems and
cable companies:<BR> 
1. Do not expect support for running a LAN over the cable modem
from the cable company.  They don't want you to do it, they
won't help you do it.<BR> 
2. Do not expect to put up a web server to be accessed by from
the internet.  You are a client, not a server.  This
technology,though fully capable of performing in this
manner, is not being deployed for use this way.
</I> </blockquote> <P> 
Again, this is a blanket statement that *does not* apply to all cable
companies.  There is a good reason for those companies who do hold this
policy, and perhaps I should have gone into more detail.  When you get a
cable modem from a cable company, *typically* you are agreeing to lease
the equipment from them under similar agreement as you rent the TV set top
box for cable television reception.  The agreement typically states that
you are not allowed to run the cable to any other TV for which you do not
rent a box.  The same goes for the cable modems.  They are agreeing to
lease you 1 modem for 1 computer.  Setting up a firewall/proxy server to
enable other systems access is exactly like placing a diplexor on you TV
set, and running the cable to another television.  That is a violation of
the agreement, and is illegal, immoral, and unethical; it's stealing.  And
again, I re-iterate, this is not true for *all* companies.  Check with
your cable company, they should be happy to explain their policies to you.
<p>
I don't really think you *should* expect to be able to do either of these
though, unless the cable company has provisions in place.  You are
agreeing to connect one computer to their network as a client.  Anything
more, you should expect to pay more, as they are providing you with
increased capabilities.  Just like the phone company charges more per
added service (*69, caller ID, etc) so should the cable companies.
Personally, I think that average rate of US$40-$50 a month for the
equivalent of a T1 to my house is an awesome deal.  If I want more 
capability, I should expect and be willing to pay more.
<blockquote> <I> 
Cable companies WILL shut you down for running a server of
anykind on your end of the network, and it can be *forever* :(
</I> </blockquote> <P> 
Again, I spoke without clarification.  Obviously it depends upon the
policies of your local cable company.  I know of 2 or 3 instances where
this has been the case.  By stating the above, I was trying to warn of the
possible consequences of violating the contract with the cable company.
If the cable company specifies in the contract what you are allowed to do
and what you are not allowed to do, you should expect to deal
with the consequences of violating the agreement.
<blockquote> <I> 
Spammers love cable/broadband networks.  There have been
several cases where a broadband network customer has been
used by spammers and were subsequently shutdown for life by
the cable company.  What happens is the person decides to
connect their private LAN to the cable modem but sets the
firewall up incorrectly.  Spammers search cable/broadband
networks for proxy servers/firewalls (Usually Win95/NT) that
allow incoming connections and then use that system to spam
the entire cable/broadband network making the spam appear as
if you sent it.
</I> </blockquote> <P> 
Spammers love any insecure system or network.  Broadband Technology
though, for the first time has allowed people more extensive and
closer contact with other people on the internet.  When you dial into an
ISP with a normal modem, it's a little more difficult for devious minded
people to take advantage of other users.  But with cable modems, you now
have hundreds and/or thousands of people all on the same private network,
all with similars IP addresses, many of whom, now leave their systems
connected for much longer periods of time.   This makes it much easier for
crackers, and other mischievous people, to take advantage of anyone who
isn't running a properly secured system.
<blockquote> <I> 
Usually you will be given 1 warning by the
cable company, but there have been cases where none was
given and the customer was completely shut down.
</I> </blockquote> 
I have heard of this happening on several occasions, where usually the
person was running an improperly configured firewall, and spammers used
their system to launch e-mail to thousands of people connected to cable
companies' private broadband networks.  If I'm paying $40 or $50 a month
for this service, I, as a paying customer do not want to receive
solicitous e-mail (spam) from some one else, especially if they are on the
same broadband network as I.  I would complain to my cable company about
it and expect them to do something.  It was these exact circumstances that
has led to several people having their cable modems permanently removed.
<blockquote><I>  
Current modems are capable of transmitting at 10Mbs in both
directions, but are usually deployed throttled back to a
trasmit speed of 300Kbs and a recieve speed of 1.5Mbs.  You
want more bandwidth, they'll be happy to charge you more
money :)
</I> </blockquote> <P> 
Personally, I think this is very fair.  The cable companies are providing
us with a service.  We, as consumers, have to pay for this service.  Just
like my electric bill, if I use a lot of electric service, I pay a lot of
money; or like the telephone company, if I have more features or want a
T1, I pay more money than if I only had a normal telephone line.  It's
the same with cable modem technology, the capability is there for 10Mbps
bandwidth in both directions.  The technology is also there to regulate
that flow.  I expect the cable companies to use that technology.  If I
want LAN speeds to my house, I should expect to have to pay for it.
<p>
Again, I want to apologize for not clarifying my previous statements a
little more.  Please check with your local cable company before you do
anything like connecting your private LAN to theirs.  There are as many
different policies as there are cable companies, so make sure to
explicitly ask if what you want to do is permitted.  This is a great
technology and has tremendous benefits.  Playing by the rules that the
cable company has put in place will only help the technology spread.  By
violating the rules, you run the risk of losing access to it, as well as
making it more difficult for the cable comapanies to contiue selling this
service.  Like any other market driven product, if there's no money in it,
or it costs too much to implement, it will fall by the wayside, and no one
benefits.  By not folling the rules, we as customers can make it cost
prohibitive for implementation, and conversely, by following the rules, we
create more market demand, which in turn, continues pushing the technology
forward, and everyone benefits.
<PRE> 
#include &lt;std_disclaimer.h&gt;

I don't pretend to know all the policies of all the cable companies.  I
don't assume to speak for any of the,, nor do I tell them how to operate.
My opinions are my own, and no one else's.  Dammit Jim, I am a Unix

Subject: <B>New Direction</B> 
<p>
I heard on the radio last night, an announcement that IBM has just
successfully masked, produced and tested their newest piece of
silicon.  The processor is based on the PowerPC design and is reported
to run at 1000MHz.  Knowing what I know about the PowerPC and its
various flavours, I think it would do to examine the idea of porting
Linux in a native coded version to this processor platform.  The
pricing of this chip with a heavy duty operating environment could give
the Alpha a real run for its money.
<p>
The PowerPC (for those who don't know) is a RISC based processor with
three major operation blocks, each capable of independent operation.
This enables the instruction flow to become parallelized so as many as
three instructions can be done simultaneously, and because it is a RISC
processor the instructions have been optimised so most occur in only
one or two cycles.  The other element of the design is to have an
extremely large cache memory on-board the processor to reduce fetch
time for instructions.  To give an idea of the improvement in speed
realised by this method, a PowerPC emulates the Intel part by keeping
an interpreter block in the cache memory of the chip and interprets the
Intel object code at comparable speeds of the Intel parts.  The lure of
creating a native Linux for this processor has crossed my mind on a
number of occasions prior to the IBM announcement, and now I hope with
encouragement this can move from fantasy to fact.

Subject: <B>Picking a nit</B>
<p>
Maybe I should have called the subject of this "pet peeve" or something
like that.  What I am writing about is a simple grammatical error that I
have seen many people make, but one that shouldn't appear in the Gazette
or any published effort and that is the incorrect use of "it's" when the
author should have used "its."  An example is in the following sentence
from a recent issue:
<p>
"This was necessary in order for a *nix version to behave to
applications like it's counterparts so applications could run
everywhere."
<p>
If you take the "it's" and expand it, the sentence would read:
<p>
"This was necessary in order for a *nix version to behave to
applications like it is counterparts so applications could run
everywhere."
<p>
The sentence no longer makes sense.  Authors should remember that "it's"
is a contraction of "it is."  If they want a possessive of "it," they
should use "its."  I have also seen instances of authors using the
apostrophe-s when they intended to form a plural but made a possesive
instead (for example, using menu's, a possesive, instead of menus, the
proper plural form).  Like I said before, these are very simple and
common errors, but ones which I feel can hurt the author's credibility.
<p>
Before anybody gets too defensive, let me say that as an employee of a
major defense contractor, I have made the above error and have had it
pointed out to me.  Maybe that's why it stands out so much when I see it
now.
<p>
Now I'll put down my pen and let others point out my errors.

i very much enjoy the information found on LG!! even though i am posting
from a windows machine, i use linux(redhat 5.0) the majority of the
time. i just happen to be at work, at this time.
<p>
anyway, being a newbie to this whole linux scheme, i have used your
site, dejanews, oreilly books, and many howto's to get my system up to
my specs.  linux is very exciting, and has alot of promise. please keep
up the good work.

In Linux Gazette 25, the review of "A Practical Guide to Linux" , by Mark
Sobell, fails to supply the publishers name, publication date, and price. I
enjoyed the review, but surely this information should be  included as a
matter of course. Given your reviewers  laudatory comments, how or where can
the rest of us hope to acquire this book?

Subject: <B>Getting Linux to the public...</B> 
<P> 
Has anyone noticed that when your friends see your neat-o Linux system
with the nice 17 inch monitor, high quality video card, and fast
computer that when they say, "Wow! that is nice, and you can do almost
anything on that!" you cringe with the fact that they are going to want
you to put it on their system?  now mind you, I dont cringe on sharing
the best O/S on the planet, In fact I want everyone to use Linux. It's
just that almost all X windows software is written for 1024 X 768 or
higher resolution video screens and that 99% of those wanting to use
Linux and X windows only have a 14" monitor that can barely get past
640X480 at 256 colors.  I tried several times to get friends into Linux
and X but to no avail because the software developed for X is for those
that have Gobs of money for good video boards and humoungous monitors.
It's not a limitation of Linux or X, it that the software that is
developed for these platforms are by professionals or professional users
that can afford that new 21 inch monitor at the computer store. We as a
group might want to see software scaled back to the 640X480 crowd.. then
Linux would take the world by storm.. Until then It's going to be
limited to us pioneers and Scientists...

Subject: <B>uptime record</B> 
<P> 
In Issue 25 (February 98) Sean Horan wrote about a Linux
system that ran continously for 274 days. Here is a quote
from Bruce Perens (president of Debian, works at Pixar) that
I took from http://www.debian.org
<blockquote> 
  "I thought three months without a reboot was a big deal.
   When I mentioned it to our developers, one of them showed
   me details about his system. It was up for 458 days, and was
   halted to move it to another floor. The network and disk
   device drivers had handled tens of millions of interrupts in
   that time."
</blockquote> 
It would be interesting to know what the record is for other
operating systems older than Linux.
