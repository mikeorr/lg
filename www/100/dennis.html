<h1>Retrospectives</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <A HREF="../authors/dennis.html">Jim Dennis</A></b></p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3> <ul><p>
I've been thinking about doing a new column for <a 
href="http://www.linuxgazette.net/">Linux Gazette</a> for a few 
months now.  Of looking back to our first issues, reading them with
an Epimethean perspective. (Epimetheus, of Greek Mythology, was brother
to Prometheus --- his counterpart; while Prometheus could see into the
future, Epimetheus had perfect "hindsight"). </p><p>

So that's what this will be.  It seems fitting
somehow that we should start the new regular column at issue 100,
reminiscent of the long running column in <a class="external"
href="http://www.sciam.com/">Scientific American</a> for "50 and 100
Years Ago."  Of course such number are completely arbitrary. </p><p>

In future issues I might cover multiple back issues; or look for threads
that wove their way through a history of discussion. </p><p>

In most cases I will be looking for things that have changed; 
updates that need to be voiced.  However, I expect that most of each 
issue is still relevant; that only minor retrospective commentary would
be needed. </p><p>

In this issue we'll be looking back at the very <a 
href="../issue01to08/linux_gazette.html">first
issue</a> of <a href="http://www.linuxgazette.net/">Linux Gazette</a>.
</ul></p>

<h3>Long Live Slackware</h3><p>

John Fisk was trying Slackware 2.0.0, had been using a 2400
baud dial up to get to the 'net via a VAX/VMS account.  The first
version of Slackware I used was version 1.0 --- I'd been using the now
forgotten SLS (Soft Landing Systems) and Yggdrasil's "Plug &amp; Play
Linux" before then and had ignored Slackware's pre-releases. </p><p>

<a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> is still maintained and
is now up to version 9.1 --- and the project is still headed by
<b>Patrick Volkerding</b>.</p><p>

John's install was only 120Mb.</p><p>

For comparison, modern <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> and
<a href="http://fedora.redhat.com">Fedora</a> installations require a
minimum of 250Mb just for the root filesystem!  However, a reasonably
minimal <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> can reasonably fit in
well under 120Mb; so we can't complain that Linux as a whole has become
bloated. </p>

<h3>Long Live our PPP Connections</h3><p>

He presents a simple PPP "keepalive" shell script.  (Could use
the <b>persist</b> directive with a modern <tt class="wiki">pppd</tt>
but some still might need something like the shell script) </p><p>

<pre class="code">
while [ -e /var/run/ppp0.pid ]; do
        ping -c 1 $REMOTE_ROUTER &gt; /dev/null 
	sleep $DELAY 
done
</pre> </p><p>

Another approach would be: </p><p>

<pre class="code">
ping -i $DELAY $REMOTE_ROUTER 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; /dev/null &amp;

PINGPID="$!"  while [ -e /var/run/ppp0.pid ]; do
        sleep $DELAY 
done

kill $PINGPID </pre>

</p><p>
... which starts one ping process that sends a ping every $DELAY
seconds; then polls slowly on the pid file and, when that's gone it
kills the background task.  This is no great technical improvement.

There's minor improvement by not spawning so many ping processes --- 
we only load ping once and let it run like a daemon; then kill it when
we're done with it.  So this alternative approach is only valuable for
edification --- and example of how to manage a backgrounded task under
the shell. </p>
<h3>Long Live Our Changes to /etc/motd and /etc/issue</h3><p>
<ul>(And also: <em>Know thy system as thou would know thine own spouse!</em>)
</ul></p><p>

The next item amounts to a 2-cent tip: that Slackware
(among some other distributions) have <tt class="wiki">rcS</tt>
scripts (<tt class="wiki">rc.sysinit</tt> on Red Hat, Fedora, and
related distributions) that overwrite our <em>/etc/motd</em> and/or
<em>/etc/issue</em> files.  So you have to comment out that code if you
want your changes to these files to persist.</p><p>

My 5-penny tip over the top of that is that every Linux system
administrator should read their <em><b>/etc/inittab</b></em> file from
top to bottom and recursively follow through them by applying the following
procedure: 
<ul><li> For every filename you encounter: </li>
   <ul><li> Run the file command on it </li>
      <li> If it's binary:  </li>
      <ul><li> Read the man or info pages </li>
         <li> Use any package manager to find out which package "owns" this program (<tt class="wiki">dpkg&#160;-S</tt>
or <tt class="wiki">rpm&#160;-qf</tt>)  </li>
         <li> Peruse any other docs associated with that package </li>
      </ul>
      <li> If it's a script of any sort: </li>
      <ul><li> Open it up in a text editor/viewer </li>
      </ul><li> Recurse </li>
    </ul>
</ul></p><p>

Following this procedure, you will wend your way through your entire
system start-up sequence.  You will know almost EVERYTHING about how your
system boots up.  (This ignores the possibility that you might have an
initrd --- and initial RAMdisk, with a <tt class="wiki">/linuxrc</tt>
script or binary embedded in it). </p><p>

As part of my LPI classes I teach this procedure and recommend that all
students do this for each new distribution that they ever try to manage.
</p>

<h3>Twiddle Dee Dum: Home at Last</h3>

<p>In the next article we see our first 2-cent tip.  <b>~</b> (the
"tilde" or "twiddle" character) is expanded by the shell to the current
user's home directory.  I'd add that <b>~foo</b> will look up the home
directory for the user "foo" and expand into that path.  This notion
of "look up" can actually be quite involved on a Linux system ---
though it usually just means a search through the /etc/passwd file.
On other systems it would entail NIS, LDAP, Hesiod, or even MS
Windows "Domain" or "Active Directory" operations.  It all depends
on the contents of the <em>/etc/nsswitch.conf</em> and the various
<em>/lib/libnss*</em> libraries that might be installed. </p>

<h3>Shell Tips, Tricks, Aliases and Custom Functions</h3><p>

The aliases he lists are all still valid.  I might add another
tip to point to Ian MacDonald's <a 
href="http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml#completion">bash
programmable completion</a> project which is now shipped as examples with
the GNU bash sources; and is thus installed on many Linux distributions
by default.  To use them, simply "source" the appropriate file, as
described in Ian's article under "Getting Started."  Ian's article has
many other tips and tricks for bash and for the readline libraries against
which it's linked.  (On my Debian systems Ian's bash completions are in
<em><b>/etc/bash_completion</b></em>). </p><p>

In his next article John also
talks about bash custom functions.  A nitpick and CAVEAT is appropriate
here.  The version of bash that was in common use back then would accept
all those shell functions as he typed them.  However, newer versions of
bash 2.x and later, require that we render them slightly differently:
</p><p>

<pre class="code">
 # Now, some handy functions...

 tarc () { tar -cvzf $1.tar.gz $1 ; } 
 tart () { tar -tvzf $1 | less ; }
 tarx () { tar -xvzf $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 ; } 
 popmail () { popclient -3 -v -u myname -p mypassword -o /root/mail/mail-in any.where.edu ; } 
 zless () { zcat $* | less ; } 
 z () { zcat $* | less ; }
</pre>

</p><p>
... all we've done is insert semicolons before those closing
braces.  This is required in newer versions of bash because it was
technically a parsing bug in older versions to treat the closing
brace as a separator/token.  We could also have simply inserted
linebreaks before the closing braces.  (To understand this consider
the ambiguity caused by: 'echo }' --- historically the } did not need
to be quoted like a ')' would be.  if that doesn't enlighten you just
accept it as a quirk and realize that these old examples from 1995
must be updated slightly to run on newer versions of bash). </p>

<h3>Zounds!!! Zany Sounds</h3><p>

In the next article the old links to sunsite.unc.edu are ancient and 
obsolete.  The sounds to which he was referring can still be found at:

<ul><li> <a
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/multimedia/sun-sounds/">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/multimedia/sun-sounds/</a>
</li></ul><p>

... which is has all the old sunsite.unc.edu
contents after two name changes (it was metalab.unc.edu
for awhile, too). <p>

Alas I couldn't find the "Three
Stooges" sounds at the <b>ibiblio</b> site; but a quick Google
search suggests that we can get some audible zaniness at: <ul><li> <a
href="http://funwavs.com/movie/sounds/the-three-stooges/">http://funwavs.com/movie/sounds/the-three-stooges/</a>
</li></ul><p>

<h3>/etc/fstab for Filesystem Aliases</h3>

<p>His article on <em>/etc/fstab</em> entries, particularly for
"noauto" devices like CD-ROMs and floppies is still relevant.
Essentially nothing as changed about that.  Some new distributions
have programs like <tt class="wiki">magicdev</tt> which run while
you're logged into the GNOME or other GUI, polling the CD-ROM drive
to automatically mount any disc you insert (and to detect the type
and optionally dispatch music players for audio CDs or launch file
browsers for file CDs, etc).  Personally I detest these automount
features and disable them as soon as I can find the relevant GUI control
panel. </p><p>

I'd still consider this to be a 2-cent tip of sorts. </p>

<h3>Long Live Backups and Version Control!</h3><p>

For the next article (about making serialized backups of files before
editing them) I'd simply suggest using RCS or CVS.  RCS is installed
with most Linux distributions.  To use it, simply create an RCS directory
under any directory in which you wish to maintain some files in version
control.  Then every time you're about to edit a config file therein,
use the command: <tt class="wiki">ci&#160;-l&#160;$FILENAME</tt>;
the file will be "checked in" to the RCS directory.  This will
automatically track each set of changes.  You can always use the
rcsdiff command to view the differences between the current version
and the most recent --- or between any arbitrary version by using
the appropriate -r switches.  CVS is basically similar, but allows
you to maintain a centralized repository across the network ---
optionally using securely authenticated and encrypted ssh tunnels.
The advantage of tracking your files under CVS is that you can restore
your settings and customizations even after you've completely wiped
the local system (so long as you've maintained your CVS repository
host and its backups). <p>

Tutorials for CVS and RCS: 

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/blandy.html"
   >http://www.cvshome.org/docs/blandy.html</a>
</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dbutler/tutorials/winter96/rcs/"
   >http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~dbutler/tutorials/winter96/rcs/</a>
</li></ul>

<p>

... there are several others on the web; <a href="http://www.google.com/"
>Google</a> for "RCS tutorial" or "CVS tutorial".</p><p>

I'd also suggest that some of us look at the newly maturing <b><a
href="http://www.subversion.tigris.org/"> Subversion</a></b> at:

<ul><li><a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"
  >http://subversion.tigris.org/</a> </li></ul>
  
</p><p>... which just attained the vaunted release version 1.0
this month. </p><p>

In the next article: "Accessing Linux from DOS" I notice
that the old link for the LDP <em>still works</em> (graciously redirecting
us from the old sunsite.unc.edu/mdw/ URL to the current ibiblio
LDP mirror).  Historical note: <b>MDW</b> are Matt Welsh's initials! Of
course the current canonical location for the <a 
href="http://www.tldp.org/">LDP</a> (Linux Documentation Project) is now:
<ul><li> <a href="http://www.tldp.org/">http://www.tldp.org/</a> </li></ul>

</p><p>
As for the EXT2TOOL.ZIP link, it's dead.  However, a quick perusal
of Freshmeat suggests that anyone who needs to access ext2/ext3
filesystems from an MS-DOS prompt might want to use Werner Zimmermann's
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/ltools/">LTOOOLS</a> package (
also at: <a href="http://www.it.fht-esslingen.de/~zimmerma/software/ltools.html">http://www.it.fht-esslingen.de/~zimmerma/software/ltools.html</a>
Professor Zimmermann's home page).  LTOOLS is the MS-DOS counterpart
to the mtools package for Linux.   </p><p>

Apparently the LTOOLS package includes a "web interface" (one
utility in the package and serve as a miniature web server for
the MS Windows "localhost") and it include a Java GUI as well.
LTOOLS allegedly still supports MS-DOS, but also have features
for later Microsoft operating systems like '95/'98, NT, ME, XP,
and Win 2000.  It's also apparently portable to Solaris and other
versions of UNIX (So you can access your ext2 filesystems from
those as well). </p><p>

<b>mtools</b> allows Linux users to access MS-DOS
filesystems, mostly floppies, but also hard drive partitions, using
commands like: <b><tt class="wiki">mcopy&#160;a:foo.zip&#160;.</tt></b>
or <b><tt class="wiki">mtype&#160;b:foo.txt</tt></b> or just <b><tt
class="wiki">mdir</tt></b> (defaults to the A: drive, <em>/dev/fd0</em>
on most installations).  mtools has been included with mainstream Linux
distributions for most of the last decade, and has been available and
widely used on other versions of UNIX for most of that time as well.
However, when I'm teaching my LPI courses I still find that its new to
more than half of the sysadmins I teach.  The principle advantages of
mtools are: you don't have to mount and unmount the floppies; you can
mark it SGID group "floppy" and set the <b>privileged=1</b> flag in
<em>/etc/mtools.conf</em> to allow users to access MS-DOS filesystems
on floppies from their own accounts (without <em>sudo</em> etc). </p><p>

The last article in this premier issue was one on building a Linux kernel.
The basic steps outline there have remained true for the last eight
years.  Today we use bzImage instead of the old zImage make target.
Also, I usually use: </p><p>

<pre class="code">
   make menuconfig; make dep
   make clean bzImage modules modules_install install
</pre>
</p><p>
... and now, with the recent release of the 2.6 kernels we'll be
dispensing with the "make dep" step (which was used to make or modify
sub-Makefiles among other things).  Also the new 2.6 kernel builds
are, by default, very quiet and clean.	     Try one to see what I
mean! </p><p>

Another minor change: newer kernels can no longer be booted raw
from floppies.	 As of 2.6 Linux always requires some sort of boot loader
(SYSLINUX, GRUB, LILO, LOADLIN.EXE, etc).  The <tt class="wiki">rdev</tt>
command is basically useless on modern kernels (though one might still
use its other features to patch in a default video mode, for example).
This isn't a major issue as almost everyone has almost always used
a bootloader through the history of Linux; the ability to pass kernel
command line parameters is just too bloody indispensable!  Of course Linux
kernels on other architectures such as SPARC or PowerPC
have their own formats and bootloaders. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3><p>

Overall most of the content of this old issue, almost nine years ago,
is still usable today.	  In less than 3 pages I've summarized it and
pointed out the few things that have to be considered when using this
information on modern systems, updated a few obsolete URLs, and just
pointed to some newer stuff in general. </p><p>

That doesn't surprise me.
Linux follows the UNIX heritage.  Things that people learned about UNIX 30
years ago are still relevant and useful today.	Things we learned about
Linux 10 years ago are now relevant on new Mac OS X systems.  The legacy
of UNIX has spanned over half of the history of electronic computing.</p>

Jim has been using Linux since kernel version 0.97 or so.  His first
distribution was 
SLS (Soft Landing Systems).  Jim taught
himself Linux while working on the technical support queues at
Symantec's Peter Norton Group.
He started by lurking alt.os.minix and alt.os.linux on USENET
netnews (before the creation of the comp.os.linux.* newsgroups), reading them
just about all day while supporting Norton Utilities, and
for a few hours every night while waiting for the rush-hour traffic to subside.

<P> Jim has also worked in other computer roles, and also as an electrician and
a crane truck operator.  Jim has also worked in many other roles.  He's been a
graveyard dishwasher, a janitor, and a driver of school buses, taxis, pizza
delivery cars, and even did some cross-country, long-haul work.

<P> He grew up in Chicago and has lived in the inner city, the suburbs,
and on farms in the midwest.  In his early teens he lived in Oregon--
Portland, Clackamas, and the forests along
the coast (Brighton).  In his early twenties, he moved to 
the Los Angeles area "for a summer job" (working for his father, and learning
the contruction trades).  

<P> By then, Jim met his true love, Heather, at a 
science-fiction convention.  About a year later they started 
spending time together, and they've now been living together for
over a decade.  First they lived in Eugene, Oregon, for a year, but now they 
live in the Silicon Valley.

<P> Jim and Heather still go to SF cons together.

<P> Jim has continued to be hooked on USENET and technical mailing 
lists.  In 1995 he registered the <A
HREF="http://starshine.org">starshine.org</A> domain as a birthday gift to
Heather (after her nickname and favorite Runequest persona).  He's participated
in an ever changing array of lists and newsgroups.

<P> In 1999 Jim started a book-authoring project (which he completed
after attracting a couple of co-authors).  That book <I>Linux System
Administration</I> (published 2000, New Riders Associates) is not
a rehash of HOWTOs and man pages.  It's intended to give a high-level
view of systems administration, covering topics like 
Requirements Analysis, Recovery Planning, and Capacity Planning.
His book intended to build upon the works of Aeleen Frisch 
(<I>Essential Systems Administration</I>, O-Reilly & Associates) and 
Nemeth, et al (<I>Unix System Administrator's Handbook</I>, Prentice
Hall).

<P> Jim is an active member of a number of Linux and UNIX users' groups 
and has done Linux consulting and training for a number of companies
(Linuxcare) and customers (US Postal Service).  He's also presented
technical sessions at conferences (Linux World Expo, San Jose and 
New York).  

<P> A few years ago, he volunteered to help with misguided technical 
question that were e-mailed to the editorial staff at the Linux
Gazette.  He answered 13 questions the first month.  A couple 
months later, he realized that these questions and his responses had
become a regular column in the Gazette.  

<P> "Darn, that made me pay more attention to what I was saying!  But I
did decide to affect a deliberately curmudgeonly attitude; I didn't
want to sound like the corporate tech support 'weenie' that I was
so experienced at playing.  That's not what Linux was about!"
(<A HREF="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=curmudgeon">
curmudgeon</A> means a crusty, ill-tempered, and usually old man,
according to the 
<A HREF="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster OnLine dictionary</A>.
The word hails back to 1577, origin unknown, and originally meant miser.)

<P> Eventually, Heather got involved and took over formatting the column,
and maintaining a script that translates "Jim's e-mail markup hints"
into HTML.  Since then, Jim and Heather have (finally) invited other
generous souls to join them as The Answer Gang.
