<p>
...and it's quite the story. Not because of us specifically, but because
theplanet is such a huge data center - i.e., it's causing a huge outage
all over the place.
</p>

<p>
To quote Doug Erwin of theplanet (issued at 10:46 PM, May 31 2008):
</p>

<pre>
   This evening at 4:55pm CDT in our H1 data center, electrical gear
   shorted, creating an explosion and fire that knocked down three walls
   surrounding our electrical equipment room. Thankfully, no one was
   injured. In addition, no customer servers were damaged or lost.
   
   We have just been allowed into the building to physically inspect the
   damage. Early indications are that the short was in a high-volume wire
   conduit. We were not allowed to activate our backup generator plan based
   on instructions from the fire department.
   
   This is a significant outage, impacting approximately 9,000 servers and
   7,500 customers. All members of our support team are in, and all vendors
   who supply us with data center equipment are on site. Our initial
   assessment, although early, points to being able to have some service
   restored by mid-afternoon on Sunday. Rest assured we are working around
   the clock.
</pre>

<p>
Our publication process is rolling on regardless of this, of course. In
principle, we should be back up pretty much as soon as theplanet is. For
the moment, if anyone needs to contact me, I'll be monitoring this
linuxmafia.com address.

<p>
Recently received Chez Moen, and I replied back saying it's indeed an
astute and elegant idea, which I might very well adopt for my own
domains.  (In the absence of an MX = mail exchanger record in the DNS
for a mail-receiving machine on the Internet, RFC 2821 specifies that
the sending host should fallback on the "A" = forward lookup record,
instead.  This was also true with the original SMTP-defining RFC, RFC
821.)
</p>

<p>
And, in case anyone is wondering, Gokhan Gucukoglu's name is Turkish.
He seems to be based in the UK, and is one of those protean characters
active broadly across free / open source software, just to make the
rest of us look bad by comparison.  ;-&gt;

Hi,
</p>

<p>
I notice that linuxmafia.com has just one MX, linuxmafia.com.  See RFC 2821 
section 5: remove your MX record; there is an implicit MX rule.  Good MTAs 
know it, most spammers, their spamware, their agents, etc, etc, still 
don't.  It's a great little trick and is doing me bloody wonders.  (It may 
on very, very rare occasions break mailers which <strong>insist</strong> that there be an 
MX record when you issue MAIL FROM linuxmafia.com; such mailers are broken 
and you really don't want to talk to them anyway <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":-)"> .)
</p>

<p>
(If you wonder why I noticed at all, it's your multiline greeting.)

Cheers,
Sabahattin

Google brought me to you. You might be interested in this new resource for
experimenting with crontab commands.
</p>

<p>
For most of us, setting up a new cron job is not something we do every day.
So we can easily forget the details.
</p>

<p>
Cron Sandbox at HxPI offers an opportunity to play with the crontab
scheduling commands in safety.
</p>

<p>
Type in the 'm h D M Dw' parameters and see a calendar of job execution
times/dates.

Hi Guys,
</p>

<p>
I was finally able to do the compilation process. Thanks for the help. 
</p>

<p>
Another question:
</p>

<p>
1. I am using a tcpdump network sniffer to capture packets of the tcp
header. I wanted to analyze  a specific variable like smoothed rtt
(srtt). I already changed the header file to include this new srtt
variable into  the option side of the tcp.h header file and also change
the tcp_input.c source code to incorporate the said variable into the
options side. I am confused whether tcp_input.c is the  correct code to
change since tcp_output.c and tcp.c is also in the linux kernel code. I
am also confused how to output this new srtt variable into the tcp
header so as to be captured by the tcpdump and be seen in the
tracefiles.
</p>

<p>
Is there a specific function in the code to be manipulated to do the
task? Any help would be appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Thank you very much in advance.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
</p>

<p>
Hello, Gang!
</p>

<p>
I am trying to compute a SHA1 hash inside a C++ program without linking
to additional libraries. There are some SHA1 code snippets around and
they seem to work. So far so good. In order to compare SHA1 sums it's
nice to have them in hexadecimal representation. The SHA1 code I used
holds the sum in a byte array which is basically an array of unsigned
chars. Creating hexadecimal output can be done as follows:
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
// Filename:  hex_output.cc - cout test firing range
 
#include &lt;iomanip&gt;
#include &lt;ios&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
 
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
 
using namespace std;
 
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    unsigned char array[10];
    unsigned short i;
 
    // An array with a French accent (sorry, SCNR)
    array[0] =3D 'A';
    array[1] =3D 'L';
    array[2] =3D 'L';
    array[3] =3D 'o';
    array[4] =3D ' ';
    array[5] =3D 'O';
    array[6] =3D 'r';
    array[7] =3D 'l';
    array[8] =3D 'd';
    array[9] =3D '!';
    for( i=3D0; i&lt;10; i++) {
        cout &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; setfill('0') &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; nouppercase &lt;&lt; array[i];
    }
    cout &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; endl;
    return(0);
}
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately this outputs: 0A0L0L0o0 0O0r0l0d0!
</p>

<p>
As soon as I change the cout line to
</p>

<pre>
cout &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; setfill('0') &lt;&lt; setw(2) &lt;&lt; nouppercase &lt;&lt; (unsigned short)array[i];
</pre>

<p>
it works and produces: 414c4c6f204f726c6421
</p>

<p>
It's late and I still lack my good night coffee, but why is that? I
didn't expect this behaviour.
</p>

<p>
Best,
Ren&eacute;.

Dear TAG,
</p>

<p>
I was playing around the command line (learning), and I came across
df(1) reporting block size in "1k-blocks".  But my dumpe2fs(8) says the
block size is 4096 (4K). Shouldn't it be doing thus by default?
</p>

<p>
It seems this is filed as a Bug under Ubuntu (Bug #180415).
</p>

<p>
One suggestion is for the install program to calculate the blocksize at
install time, and put it somewhere safe (immutable). Like 'export
BLOCKSIZE=&lt;whatever&gt;' in /etc/profile.
</p>

<p>
I also saw that adding ' (apostrophe) before the block size will yield
you a digit separator -- cool, eh?
</p>

<p>
I did:
<pre>
BLOCKSIZE="'4096" ls -l
           ^ &lt;- see this?
</pre>

<p>
and it gave me size figures separated by commas! <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">
</p>

<p>
My $LANG is en_IN.UTF-8

<p>
YMMV

<p>
Hi guys,
</p>

<p>
Good day!
</p>

<p>
I am currently doing my phd in telecommunications  working on tcp. I
found the document tcp_input.c  and tc.c source code document at a
website  but browsing through my kernel, I cannot find the source codes
mentioned.  Thus, this inquiry.
</p>

<p>
It would be appreciated if you can kindly help me on my questions since
I am new to tcp.
</p>

<p>
1.      I am using fedora core6 linux and I cannot find the file
tcp_input.c  and tcp.c in the kernel. Where can I find this code in the
kernel  since I need to do some modification on the tcp header as part
of my thesis?
</p>

<p>
2.      What are the steps  in inserting an estimated value into a
kernel variable?
</p>

<p>
I have already visited the linux kernel faq and I cannot find the answer
to my questions ( or maybe I need to browse more<img src="../gx/frown.png" alt=":-(">). I hope you can
shed light on the above queries. Thank you very much in advance.
</p>

<p>
Cheers,
</p>

Hello TAG,
</p>

<p>
I have a text file from which I want to list only those lines which
contain either pattern1 or patern2 or both.
</p>

<p>
How to do this with 'gre'p?
</p>

<p>
Assume, file is 'patch', and 'string1' and 'string2' are the two patterns.
</p>

<p>
The strings for me are: 'ha_example' and 'handler'- so I cannot
possibly write a regex for that.
</p>

<p>
Thanks,

I was trying to remember how to use XMLHttpRequest, and just wanted to
pop a note to say thanks for a useful article!
</p>

<p>
One thing: if you're trying to test something offline, Firefox will
disallow any open() requests (to try to prevent XSS).
<a href="http://www.captain.at/howto-ajax-permission-denied-xmlhttprequest.php">http://www.captain.at/howto-ajax-permission-denied-xmlhttprequest.php</a>
has some details about it.
</p>

<p>
Or, better yet, here's the test page I was using (the rest of 'base'
is 'webservice/ws.php' - I don't think Apertium's server is quite up
to widespread use of the webservice yet):
</p>

&gt;&gt; Hi All,
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Here is a 2 cent tip which is a  little Perl script for looping through 
&gt;&gt; directory's.
&gt;&gt;     
&gt;
&gt; Why not just use 'File::Find'? It's included in the default Perl
&gt; install, and is both powerful and flexible.
&gt;
&gt; ```
&gt; use File::Find;
&gt;
&gt; find(sub { do_whatever_you_want_here }, @directories_to_search);
&gt; '''
&gt;
&gt; For more info, see 'perldoc File::Find'.
</pre>

<p>
Perl File::Find didn't have everything that I want to be able to do this 
function. I was not just trying to find files with this but also  was 
try to find items that was in different directory's.
</p>

<p>
When looking around on the internet for that I want to do everything 
thing that I was able to find said not to use file::find because it 
wasn't powerful enough for that I was doing so I just create that 
function to do some different things along the way.

<p>
This was just too cool not to try it.  It works great.  I now have a 7
Gb RAID 5 on three 4 Gb pendrives.
</p>

<p>
Caveats:
<pre>
   -  make sure the hub you buy leaves enough room between slots to
      insert your keys.  Some can be pretty tight.  Keys are all
      shapes and sizes, and some are pretty fat.  That tiny, elegant
      little hub may be cute, but is it usable?  I got the skinny Sony
      4 Gb MicroVaults, but still their button controlling the
      retractable connector gets in the way.  Staples generic Relay
      keys are too wide to use with this hub.
 
   -  The price range on this stuff is all over the map too, so best
      to shop around.  I bought a Targus hub for ca. $40, then found
      an Illum for $17.  Nowhere on the Targus does it mention USB
      2.0.  Is it?  Dunno.  It's going back.
 
   -  Just to be different (yet again), Debian Etch/Stable barfed on
      your mdadm syntax.  It insists on "-l 5" instead of "-l=5",
      ditto "-n 3" instead of "-n=3".
 
   -  I notice my copy of Sidux LiveCD does not contain mdadm, drat.
      Haven't looked at Knoppix yet.
 
   -  echo "(3 * 39.94) + 17" | bc -l == 136.82.  I just bought an
      Acomdata USB external 320 Gb 7200 rpm hard drive for 139.85.
      320 for $140, vs. 7 for $137, doesn't really make much sense,
      but it's still fun.
</pre>
Thanks for helping me make a fun toy, and for a nicely written and
enjoyable article.

As Kapil Hari Paranjape said, my main point was that "utf-8" is not

The base language of the Linux Gazette looks to be English.  So 
use "en".  If you want to be perfect, mark any snippets in other

Hi All,
</p>

<p>
I will share the socket code that I wrote for checking to see if your 
http server is running. This will need to be run from a remote computer.
</p>

<p>
There will be something that you may need to change some things around 
for your needs and at this time it will not work with https it is only 
for http.
</p>

<p>
Here is the code I have put a few notes in where you may need to change 
for your needs.
</p>

<p>
<pre class='code'>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use Socket;
$host = $ARGV[0];
$port = $ARGV[1];
$iaddr = inet_aton($host) || die "Unable to determine address for $host";
$paddr = sockaddr_in($port, $iaddr);
$proto = getprotobyname('tcp');
socket(SOCKET, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, $proto) ||
    return "Unable to create a new socket: $!";
connect(SOCKET, $paddr) || die "Connection refused by $host: $!";
select(SOCKET);
$| = 1;
select(stdout);
print SOCKET "GET / HTTP/1.1\n";
print SOCKET "Host: $host\n";

----- Forwarded message from Oscar Laycock &lt;oscar_laycock@yahoo.co.uk&gt; -----
 
   I run a Knoppix CD on an old PC with only 128 meg of RAM. To speed things
   up, to reduce the swapping, I cut down on the memory set aside for my
   work:
 
   mount -t tmpfs /ramdisk /ramdisk -o remount,rw,size=15m,mode=755
 
   Maybe you can do something similar on other live CD's?

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Nokia on Open Cell Phone Systems</h3>

<p>After acquiring full ownership of Symbian, an operating system for cell
phones, Nokia changed the product to a royalty-free model, following the
market trend away from closed systems, contributing the operating system to
Symbian Foundation, a newly-created open source Community.</p>

<p>Several cell phone providers, including AT&amp;T, Sony Erickson, LG
Electronics, Motorola and Samsung Electronics have already shown interest
in the single platform, signing up to form the Symbian Foundation.</p>

<p>More information about Symbian OS can be found here: <a
href='http://www.symbian.com/'>http://www.symbian.com/</a><br /> and on the
Symbian Foundation Web page: <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">HP Open-sources AdvFS</h3>

<p>HP announced on June 23 that it is releasing the Tru64 Unix Advanced
File System source code free to the Linux community, providing a reference
implementation for an enterprise Linux file system.</p>

<p> More information about the AdvFS can be found at HP's page, at <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Kernel Developers Sign up a Letter Against Closed-Source Drivers</h3>

<p>Several of the Linux Kernel Developers signed a letter directed to
hardware vendors, showing several disadvantages of closed-source drivers to
the Linux Community. The letter says, among other things, "We have
repeatedly found them [closed source drivers] to be detrimental to Linux
users, businesses, and the greater Linux ecosystem. Such modules negate the
openness, stability, flexibility, and maintainability of the Linux
development model and shut their users off from the expertise of the Linux
community." It was signed by 170 kernel developers.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Openmoko's Linux-based
cell phone started shipping</h3>

<p>Openmoko's Neo Freerunner is an open hardware design cell phone that
runs a Linux-based operating system, which users are free to modify (and
encouraged to do so!). This is the first official release of OpenMoko to
the market, as the phone was mostly sold to mobile phone software
developers before. The hardware consists of a 500MHz Samsung processor,
128MB of RAM, 256MB of flash memory, and a 4.3-inch 640x480 VGA touch
screen LCD. It runs on the open source mobile phone software stack,
maintained by the OpenMoko project, along with the open source Jalimo Java
Virtual Machine.</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LinuxWorld Partners on Global Installfest for Schools</h3>

<p>
IDG World Expo announced it will partner with Untangle, a pioneer in open
source network gateway platforms, to host an Installfest for Schools at
this year's LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo. Installfest is an event that
drives the refurbishment of older, discarded computers, with Free and Open
Source Software (FOSS) and then donates the restored computers to schools
in need. LinuxWorld is scheduled to take place August 4-7, 2008, at San
Francisco's Moscone Center.
</p>

<p>
Building on the success of the first Installfest for Schools, which
refurbished 350 computers with Ubuntu 7.10 for schools in March of 2008,
the LinuxWorld event will have local and global components. LinuxWorld
attendees will be able to participate by hacking older hardware and
installing the operating systems at work stations set up on the show floor.
In addition, LinuxWorld will host a collection site by the Alameda County
Computer Resource Center (ACCRC) to collect old computers donated by
LinuxWorld attendees. The Installfest will go global by posting the
scripts, ISO images, tips, and collateral online for Linux users groups
(LUGs) to host Installfest for Schools in their own neighborhoods.
Volunteers in Bellingham WA, and Portland OR, have already signed up to
organize Installfests for Schools in their neighborhoods.
</p>

<p>
"Installfest is a tremendous effort that brings the Linux community
together for a great cause, by providing computers to underprivileged
schools, and promoting the use of open source software to new users," said
Melinda Kendall, Vice President and General Manager of LinuxWorld
Conference &amp; Expo.  "Installfest also keeps tons of toxic electronic
waste from entering our landfills so it's a win-win situation for the
event, the community, the schools, and the environment. We are really
excited to have the opportunity to play a role in this endeavor." 
</p>

<p>
Volunteers can help the effort by donating an old computer, helping to
refurbish computers on site at LinuxWorld, or by helping to organize an
event in their neighborhood. For more information or to learn how you can
help, please visit:<br> <a

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">LinuxWorld to host Free Community Days at SF Expo</h3>

<p>
IDG has announced several open Community Days slated for the upcoming
LinuxWorld conference and expo. Registrants for a Community Day can attend
community sessions, keynotes and community BOFs for free.
</p>

<p>
Currently there are four community conferences scheduled on separate days
at
LinuxWorld:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Ubucon, for the Ubuntu community
<li> openSUSE
<li> Moblin World Tour focusing on Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs)
<li> PostgreSQL
</ul>

</p>

<p>
In another new item for LinuxWorld, The Open Voting Consortium (OVC) has
teamed-up with LinuxWorld to host a demonstration of open source voting at
this summer's LinuxWorld event. Attendees will have a unique opportunity to
use an open source voting system to cast a mock ballot for the 2008
Presidential election, as well as witness how the votes are tallied and
available for recount using this system.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">oCERT keeps Open Source Secure</h3>

<p>
A volunteer-based open source security clearinghouse for security
vulnerabilities helps large and small FOSS efforts. The Open Source
Computer Emergency Response Team, or oCERT, provides security support to
Open Source projects affected by security incidents or vulnerabilities, in
the same way that national CERTs offer security services for their
respective countries.
</p>

<p>
While open source code is assumed to be more secure because more eyeballs
get to look at it, not all projects have the requisite security experience
to understand infrastructure level security concerns. oCERT can help
smaller FOSS projects with security vulnerability research and assessment.
The oCERT effort has attracted organizations such as Google and the Open
Source Lab as sponsors.
</p>

<p>
From their website:
</p>

<blockquote>
"The service aims to help both large infrastructures, like major
distributions, and smaller projects that can't afford a full-blown security
team and/or security resources. This means aiding coordination between
distributions and small project contacts. The goal is to reduce the impact
of compromises on small projects with little or no infrastructure security,
avoiding the ripple effect of badly communicated or handled compromises,
which can currently result in distributions shipping code which has been
tampered with."
<br>
"oCERT also provides security vulnerability mediation for the security
community, having reliable security contacts between registered projects
and reporters that need to get in touch with a specific project regarding
infrastructure security issues. "
</blockquote>

<p>
Since their March launch,  oCERT has issued 5 security advisories, the most
recent in June.<br>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Breaks Into Top 5 on Supercomputer List</h3>

<p>
The Top 500 Supercomputers list was released at the International
Supercomputing Conference (ISC) in Dresden, Germany in June. Sun took the
#4 position with its deployment of the Sun Constellation System at the
Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in Austin.
</p>

<p>
New additions to the Sun Constellation System family announced at ISC are
the Sun Blade X6450 server module which features 2 or 4 quad core Intel
Xeon processors, providing up to 7.37 TFlops in a single Constellation
System Rack and the Sun Datacenter Switch 3x24 (a smaller version of the
Sun Datacenter Switch 3456), which features 72 DDR 4X Infiniband ports.
Together, these new additions to the Sun Constellation System allow
customers to build mid-size clusters using the same architecture as that
deployed at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).
</p>

<p>
The Lustre File System is an open source solution for easy aggregation of
tens of thousands of cluster nodes and petabytes of storage into one file
system. Lustre can achieve &gt;90% of raw bandwidth I/O.
</p>

<p>
Other key Sun note-worthies:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Based on the Sun Constellation System, TACC's Ranger supercomputer is
the highest ranking system built on an open architecture.
<li> Sun's Lustre File System manages 6 of the top 10 systems and nearly
half of the top 50 systems.
<li> Nearly half of the top 50 systems are archiving data on Sun storage.
</ul>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Canonical Showcases 'Ubuntu Netbook Remix'</h3>

<p>
At the Computex conference in Taiwan, Canonical announced a reworked
desktop image of Ubuntu built specifically for a new category of
ultra-portable Internet devices netbooks. These are affordable,
power-efficient, small screen devices, based on low-power architectures
like the Intel Atom processor. This version of Ubuntu allows consumers to
send e-mail and instant messages, and to surf the Internet with small and
lightweight devices.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu Netbook Remix is built to provide a great user experience leveraging
Ubuntu's reputation for delivering operating systems that "just work" in
the desktop environment. The Remix is based on the standard Ubuntu Desktop
Edition with a faster access launcher allowing users to get online more
quickly. It will also enable device manufacturers to get to market rapidly
with netbooks. Canonical is also working with ISVs to ensure that popular
desktop applications are certified on Ubuntu, and will run on the Ubuntu
Netbook Remix. Canonical is already working with a number OEMs to deliver
the software on devices later in 2008.
</p>

<p>
Ubuntu Netbook Remix leverages Moblin technologies optimized for the Intel
Atom processor. Intel and Canonical are working to create a next generation
computing experience across a new category of affordable Internet-centric,
portable devices including Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs), netbooks,
nettops and embedded devices.

<h2>Software and Product News</h2>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Firefox 3</h3>

<p>Firefox 3 is officially out with great fanfare and an attempt to enter
the Guinness Book for most downloads on a single day, with the amazing mark
of over eight million downloads in 24 hours. The Guinness World Records has
been asked to certify this result; this may take until sometime in July.
Log files are being audited at Open Source Labs at Oregon State University
to remove duplicates and failed downloads.</p>

<p>
The peak rate claimed was 17,000 downloads a minute. The download servers
were overwhelmed in the first few hours, but they were able to meet the
demand after some reconfiguration.
</p>

<p>
A web research firm, Xiti, reported in March that Firefox had about a 30%
share of the European browser market.  With the latest version out, and
many local languages supported, that percentage should climb.
</p>

<p>New features of this release includes better overall performance,
integrated phishing protection, a smart location bar with better auto
complete functions, anti-virus software integration, a re-designed download
manager that supports resuming downloads, and much, much more.</p>

<p>
One long-sought feature now in FireFox 3 is the ability directly send an
e-mail from on-line services such as Yahoo Mail by clicking on a "mailto"
link.  Previously, "mailto" links would open desktop programs.
</p>

<p>
In his ZDnet blog, Adrian Kingsley-Hughes ran the SunSpider JavaScript
benchmark against FireFox 3 RC1 and RC3 and compared this to his results
with Opera 9.5, Safari 1.5, IE 7 and the IE 8 beta. All tests were done on
the same hardware.  FireFox 3 swept the Javascript benchmark.  Here's the
test result chart:

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Red Hat's new oVirt Virtualization Platform</h3>

<p>
In mid-June announcements at the Red Hat Summit, the company reported on a
new stand-alone hypervisor offering and a virtualization management
platform. The core technology was developed by the Red Hat's sponsored
oVirt open source project.
</p>

<p>
Red Hat's oVirt management platform delivers a cross-platform management
solution allowing customers to centrally manage their entire virtual
infrastructure, crossing hypervisor and vendor boundaries to provide a
solution that eliminates the complexity of managing virtualization across
the enterprise.
</p>

<p>
oVirt uses Red Hat's open source libvirt management framework that provides
hypervisor-agnostic management interfacing, allowing the same tools to
manage multiple different hypervisors. Libvirt already supports six
hypervisors: Xen, KVM, QEMU, OpenVZ, Linux Containers (LVX) and Solaris
LDoms and the list is growing. The libvirt standard has been embraced by
leading OEMs, ISVs and operating system vendors.
</p>

<p>
The beta can be downloaded from <a
href="http://ovirt.org/">http://ovirt.org/</a>.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">JBoss in the Cloud</h3>

<p>
Red Hat also announced that the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform has
become the first supported Java application server available on Amazon EC2,
joining Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Developers, enterprises and startups can
now use JBoss Enterprise Application Platform on Amazon EC2 for on-demand
compute processing.  This is currently in Beta.
</p>

<p>
JBoss Enterprise is the second Red Hat solution to be offered through
Amazon EC2. Red Hat Enterprise Linux was made available on-demand on EC2 in
November 2007.
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun VirtualBox Breaks Five Million Downloads; Supports All Major
OSes</h3>

<p>
Sun's xVM VirtualBox open source desktop virtualization software has
surpassed five million downloads in 18 months. xVM VirtualBox 1.6 is the
first free hypervisor to support all major host operating systems,
including Mac OS X, Linux, Wind0ws, Solaris and OpenSolaris. The software
can be downloaded free of charge at www.virtualbox.com and www.openxvm.org
.
</p>

<p>
xVM VirtualBox software lets users create virtual machines for whichever
operating system they choose. The software supports everything from the
latest Micr0s0ft Vista and OpenSolaris applications to old Wind0ws 98, OS2
or DOS alongside Apple applications on a new Mac laptop, for example. A 20
megabyte download, xVM VirtualBox software installs in
less than five minutes. It is licensed under GPLv2 as well as in its binary
form under a Personal Use License.

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">New Red Hat Middleware Architecture</h3>

<p>
Red Hat has created a new middleware architecture for their
internally-developed applications that further casts a unique Red Hat
development strategy.
</p>

<p>
The new middleware architecture is broadly based on JBoss technology. It
includes an Enterprise Service Bus implementing a Services Oriented
Architecture (SOA); Seam, of course, the JBoss integration framework; the
JBoss Business Process Modeling suite (JBPM); and Drools, the JBoss rules
processing environment. The entire stack runs on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
taking advantage of the operating system tools for virtualization,
provisioning, configuration, and other functionality. The full technical
architecture incorporates Cobbler/Koan for network booting,JBoss SOA, Xen,
LVM, Git for distributed, offline source code management, Maven, and more.
</p>

<p>
According to Lee Congdon, Chief Information Officer at Red Hat : "Cobbler
is a provisioning and update server that supports deployments via network
booting, virtualization, and reinstalls of existing systems. A significant
advantage of Cobbler is that it integrates multiple technologies and
reduces the need for the user to understand the details of each. The update
features of Cobbler integrate yum mirroring and kickstart."
</p>

<p>
"Koan, which is an acronym for 'Kickstart over a Network', is an emerging
technology that configures machines from remote Cobbler servers. Koan also
enables the use of virtualization and re-installs from a Cobbler server.
When launched, it requests install information from the server and creates
a virtual guest or replaces the machine it is running on. "
</p>

<h3><img alt="lightning bolt" src="../gx/bolt.gif">Sun Announces Carrier Grade MySQL Cluster 6.3 at NXTcomm</h3>

<p> At NXTcomm, Sun announced the latest version of its open source
database platform for carrier grade telecommunications environments: MySQL
Cluster Carrier Grade Edition 6.3. MySQL Cluster is a high availability
"shared nothing" database and is at the heart of subscriber data management
systems for leading network equipment providers including Alcatel-Lucent,
Nokia, Siemens Networks, and Nortel.  </p>

<p> Sun Chairman Scott McNealy took the stage at NXTcomm to deliver a
keynote address which touched upon the arrival of convergence in the
telecom space and the importance of sharing in this new environment.  His
main charge for network operators was that they should strive harder to
package and offer services and content directly to customers, rather than
offering them network access and connectivity alone.  "Become a destination
site, or the destination site will become you," McNealy told the audience.
</p>

<p> During a private lunch with press and industry analysts later that
afternoon, McNealy expounded upon the potential for open source software to
be a "game-changer" in the communications market as it has in other
markets. As the industry becomes more software-driven, he said, more
players in the space need to take advantage of the technical and cost
advantages of free, open source software. McNealy repeated the point many
times during his NXTcomm keynote saying, "Did we mention it's free?" </p>

<p> MySQL Cluster 6.3 includes geographical replication, 'five nines'
(99.999%) availability, online schema management, and disk-based data
capability that allows for storage of both highly transactional and
persistent data.  </p>

<p> MySQL Cluster is available under the open source GPL license for a
range of popular operating systems, including Solaris, RHEL and SUSE Linux,
and Mac OS X. Sun also offers commercial licensing, expert consulting, and
technical support for MySQL Cluster. More information is available at <a
href="http://www.mysql.com/cluster/">http://www.mysql.com/cluster/</a>.

<h1>Review of the Plat'Home OpenBlockS</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/okopnik.html">Ben Okopnik</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>
Some months ago, Plat'Home sent us a press release detailing their new
product, the Plat'Home Open Micro Server <a id="okopnik.html_1_back"></a><a
href="#okopnik.html_1">[1]</a>. The writeup seemed promising - lots of
keywords designed to ping a geek's heart, warm his kidneys, and titillate
his imagination:
</p>

<pre class="code">
&gt;    Hi Ben,
&gt;    Wanted to introduce you to Plat'Home [www.plathome.com], the company
&gt;    that introduced the fledgling Linux operating system to Japan in 1993 and
&gt;    is now offering its flagship product, the OpenMicroServer, in the U.S.
&gt;     Their current customer list is quite impressive * NTT, Japan's largest
&gt;    company, KDDI, Sony, Fujitsu, and Toshiba, among others.
&gt;    Plat'Home designed the customizable SSD/Linux operating system for the
&gt;    OpenMicroServer. OpenMicroServers can be fully administered over the
&gt;    network, and do not require a connection to display or I/O devices such as
&gt;    a monitor, keyboard or mouse.
&gt;    The neat thing about the OpenMicroServer is that it fits in the palm of
&gt;    your hand, so it's quite portable. And thanks to integrated Power over
&gt;    Ethernet (PoE) functionality, it can even work without a separate power
&gt;    supply cable. This means no mangy cables and no need to be next to a
&gt;    power outlet. Additionally, it does not contain a cooling fan, so it's
&gt;    quiet, and has the ability to operate in super hot* 104+
&gt;    degree* conditions.
</pre>

<p>
Since it sounded like a flexible and interesting gadget, I volunteered to
review it (despite already having way too much to do, on the principle that
one more task in the huge flood wouldn't be noticeable. :)
</p>

<h3>The Synopsis</h3>
<p>
When I received it, my first reaction was "Whoa, that's a lot bigger than I
expected!" Then I realized that I'd been misled by the hype. I quote,
again:
</p>

<blockquote>
The neat thing about the OpenMicroServer is that it fits in the palm of
your hand, so it's quite portable.
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps I'd misinterpreted the above statement, and "fits in the palm of
your hand" actually means "in the palm of King Kong's hand" - although it's
arguable whether this unit is smaller than <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942039/">Fay Wray</a>'s waist. I'd bet on
Fay, myself. In reality, it's about half the size of an average laptop,
although a bit lighter. Add in the cables and the power adapter (which,
despite the claims about Power Over Ethernet (PoE), was indeed required -
I, at least, could not get PoE to work), and the weight/size of the unit is
something they should have buried in the documentation instead of boasting
about it. On the other hand, I may be looking for restraint where only
over-enthusiasm abounds...
</p>

<p>(Doing a bit more digging on the Net turned up a reference in which they
had indeed buried the size data, coyly mentioning a "1U rack mount size".
This turns out to be <strong>17.3" x 7.3" x 1.8" inches</strong>, a.k.a.
<strong>440x184x44mm</strong> overall! That same reference uses the term
"tiny" in addition to "palm of your hand".) </p>

<p>
Next, like a good lad, I attempted to read the documentation. Frankly, I
felt like just plugging it in and having a go - this would be a certain
sort of test of its own, since a stand-alone computer should work
intuitively in many ways - but I was already getting a certain feeling
about this, and decided to treat it with maximum latitude and
circumspection.
</p>

<p>
A large number of the initial pages of the printed (actually, photocopied)
manual were consumed in warnings. In fact, in a long life of reading
equipment manuals for a variety of things - power tools, welding equipment,
sailing gear, scuba gear, large power systems, computers, etc. - I've
<strong>never</strong> seen anything like it; there were warnings about
leaking capacitors as well as warnings about placing the unit on top of
things (I was fascinated and read the details - it seems that it could
actually <strong>fall</strong> and hurt someone. Who would have thought
it???) Most people, after reading this part, would be too terrified to ever
come near it again... but after many repetitions of a calming mantra, I was
able to go on with the process - only to scratch myself on a badly-finished
corner of the case. It seems that it's easier to write warnings than to
make a metal case that won't attack the user.
</p>

<p>
Once past that initial hurdle, I started delving into the meat of the docs
- which were written in Japanese. Actually, the words used were English,
and so was the grammar - but the structure and the phrasing were pure
日本語 (Nihongo). The spelling was excellent, too - and yet, it was nearly
incomprehensible; many of the paragraphs were repeated, and the structure
was indefinite and vague (there was no hierarchy of any sort.)
</p>

<p>
However, I had a secret weapon: my wife happens to be of Japanese
extraction, and so I had a ready-made translator and partner in exploration
of this deep, dark cave. Take <em>that</em>, you manual-manglers! :) She
read the Japanese version of the manual, translated it into English, and we
went merrily rolling along - except in the many cases where the Japanese
didn't make any sense either. Some of which could then be resolved by
reading the English version. Woo-hoo, linguistic adventures Indiana Jones
style!
</p>

<p>
To be completely fair about this, it really wasn't about the language -
although that by itself would be a "do not pass 'GO', do not collect $200"
factor. The problem was that the organization of the manual was so poor
that no amount of translation would have made it work. E.g., if you wanted
the password for logging in via the serial interface, you had to figure out
that you should go forward a few chapters into the Ethernet section and use
their web password to do so. On the other hand, if you had the facility for
remembering every single fact in a manual, I suppose you could read the
entire thing and somehow cross-reference everything in your mind. I will
admit that I am explicitly <em>not</em> a paragon of such virtues; if I
can't find it in the relevant section pointed to by the index, I tend to
take 'strace' (or perhaps 'ldd', or sometimes an axe) to the thing. In this
case, Plat'Home had supplied me with a 4" or so Ethernet cable, so I
decided to try that route first.
</p>

<p>
Armed with the minimal amount of information that the two of us were able
to glean, I went poking and prodding at the 'soft' end of this box.  'nmap'
showed that the appropriate listeners (plus a few others - none of which
were documented) were indeed running on it; however, plain old port 80 was
not available - theoretically because you'd want to leave it available for
standard HTTP service to the world from this box - and 880 was handling web
administration logins. A technically odd choice, that, since 880 is still a
low (i.e., privileged) port and requires root permissions to access; this
is the common reason for using port 8080, or other ports above 1024, for
similar situations. By the same token, the pre-allocated IP addresses for
this box were a little unusual: "192.168.252.254" constrains you to either
have your own address in the xxx.xxx.252.xxx IP range or to use an odd
netmask - neither of which is normally necessary or desirable, and is
certainly not common practice.
</p>

<pre class="code">

<p>
Surfing over to http://192.168.252.254:880, I found a very crude,
early-days-of-the-Web page - &lt;FONT SIZE="-1"&gt; tags and all, with no
styling or anything resembling an attempt to make it pleasant or
professional-looking - redirecting me to the Web interface. Which was just
as crude looking, and - crowning touch - with all the link text written in
Japanese. The effect was somewhat spoiled by the fact that I could roll
over the links and see the names of the links ('password.html', etc.), but
except for that, it was a complete and perfect mystery. Doubly so, since I
thought I was reviewing a computer. Perhaps I was mistaken, and it was a
new puzzle game?
</p>

<p>
Since the web username was 'root' (at least somewhat startling, in the
context of a box the services of which you're supposed to expose to the
world), I decided to immediately change the password, and went to the
'パスワード' ('password') link... which contained nothing beyond the page
title and a copyright bar. Looking at 'View source' revealed the reason -
the page consisted of only the following HTML:

&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>
In other words, the page did exactly nothing useful - there wasn't even any
form input HTML that would accept a new password.
</p>

<p>
Somewhat discouraged by now, I checked out the remaining links, guessing -
and sometimes being wrong about - their functions. The configuration
options for the servers, the DNS config, etc. were mostly either crude,
incomplete, ineffective, or all three. Just for comparison, a typical
Linksys router interface is slick, intuitive, and rather complete in its
functionality; if Plat'Home had simply <strike>ripped it off</strike> used
it as an inspiration, they would have been much, much better off - even
before they made any changes or improvements. Given the many excellent
examples of router UI out there today, there's literally no reason for
anything this poor.
</p>

<p>
Just for kicks, I decided to see if the console interface was any better...
and couldn't get in, even armed with the root password, and despite the
fact that I'd just exchanged some email with their technical contact person. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
ben@Tyr:~$ telnet 192.168.252.254

</pre>

<p>
Contacting Plat'Home's technical experts didn't produce any good results -
except, perhaps, a confirmation that I <em>wasn't</em> crazy and the
interface <em>was</em> this bad (their attitude seemed to be "That's not a
problem, sir - that's a <em>feature!</em>") They were quite nice, and very
polite, but an excuse like "you can't log into FTP or telnet via Ethernet,
only via the serial interface - that's a security feature!" indicates
either a completely wrong-headed idea about what is necessary for a web
server, or a stuck excuse mechanism. Again, there's no justifiable reason
for either of these in a company in the computer field today.
</p>

<p>
As a last, vain hope, I tried connecting to the box via a serial interface.
Due to my fairly extensive experience with serial/cellphone connections in
my early days of mobile Linux connections, I consider myself quite
knowledgeable about it... but this box defeated me; I could never get it to
talk to me either via 'minicom', 'kermit', or any of my other serial
configuration tools. (For the doubting Thomases among us - yes, the port
was configured and enabled. Yes, I have serial support compiled in the
kernel. Yes, "serial.o" was loaded.) I gave up, and shipped it back to
Plat'Home.
</p>

<h3>The Denouement</h3>
<p>
In conclusion, I have to say that the Plat'Home OpenBlockS appears
to be a prototype that's about 3/4 of the way through development rather
than a market-ready product. I'd have enjoyed playing with it if it had
been the nifty toy represented by their PR department... but I saw nothing
that justified the hype. For the moment, my impression of this product is
anything but positive.
</p>

<hr>
<a id="okopnik.html_1"></a><a href="#okopnik.html_1_back">[1]</a> While I
was waiting for the unit, Plat'Home contacted me to say that the Open Micro
Server that they were originally going to ship had been superceded by the
OpenBlockS and that they were sending me the newer unit; hence, the change
from the original PR to the actual unit. The claims, however, didn't change
much - except, perhaps, to become even more hyperbolic than the original.

<h1>Apertium: Open source machine translation</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/oregan.html">Jimmy O'Regan</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>About Apertium</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://www.apertium.org">Apertium</a> is an open source
shallow-transfer machine translation (MT) system. In addition to the translation
engine, it also provides tools for manipulating linguistic data, and
translators designed to run using the engine. At the time of writing, there
are stable bilingual translators available for English-Catalan,
English-Spanish, Catalan-Spanish, Catalan-French, Spanish-Portuguese,
Spanish-Galician, and French-Spanish; as well as monolingual translators
that translate from Esperanto to Catalan and to Spanish, and from Romanian
to Spanish. There are also a number of unstable translators in various
stages of development. (A <a
href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/List_of_language_pairs">list of
language pairs</a>, updated daily, is available on the <a
href="http://wiki.apertium.org/wiki/Main_Page">Apertium wiki</a>).
</p>

<p>
In other words, Apertium is the open-source Systran (the engine that
powers <a href="http://babelfish.yahoo.com">Babelfish</a>).
</p>

<p>
Apertium version 1 was based on existing translators that had been designed 
by the <a href="http://transducens.dlsi.ua.es/">Transducens group</a> at the 
<a href="http://www.ua.es/">Universitat d'Alacant</a>, and funded by the 
<a href="http://www.opentrad.com/">OpenTrad consortium</a>. Subsequent 
development has been funded by the university, as well as by
<a href="http://www.prompsit.com/">Prompsit Language Engineering</a>. 
While Apertium 1 was designed with the Romance languages of Spain in mind,
Apertium 2 added support for less-related languages (Catalan-English); 
Apertium 3 added Unicode support.
</p>

<p>
Apertium is designed according to the Unix philosophy: translation is 
performed in stages by a set of tools that operate on a simple text stream. 
Other tools can be added to the pipeline as required, and the text stream can 
be modified using standard tools. There is also a wrapper script (called
simply <tt>apertium</tt>) that takes care of most of the details.
</p>

<pre>
$ echo 'Esta es Gloria, mi amiga argentina'|apertium es-en
This is Gloria, my Argentinian friend
</pre>

<p>
(That example was picked at random from 'Teach Yourself Spanish Grammar' - 
translation quality is not always that high, though).
</p>

<p>
Apertium packages are available for Debian and Ubuntu 
(<tt>apt-get install apertium</tt>); packages are not yet available for 
other distributions, though it has been used successfully on several
distributions. The mildly curious may prefer to try the
<a href="http://www.apertium.org/?id=surfandtranslate">Surf and Translate</a>
demo on the Apertium Web site.

</p>

<p>
I intend to follow this article with articles of a more tutorial nature;
the rest of this article is intended to give an explanation of the most 
common terms in machine translation. 
</p>

<h3>Types of Machine Translation</h3>

<p>
Machine translation systems differ in sophistication, and there are several 
basic approaches to translation. At the basic level, any translation 
system has to include dictionary lookup; however, this can also use a <em>stemmer</em>
to find the basic form of a word (instead of looking up 'beers' in the
dictionary, it looks up 'beer'), or a <em>morphological analyser</em> (which operates
much like a stemmer, but also includes grammatical information - Apertium's
analyser would return <tt>beer&lt;n&gt;&lt;pl&gt;</tt> from the word 'beers',
to tell the rest of the system that the word is a noun, and plural).
</p>

<p>
<em>Rule-based</em> systems were the first 'real' kind of machine
translation system. Rather than simply translating word to word, rules
are developed that allow for words to be placed in different places, to
have different meaning depending on context, etc. The <a
href="http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/701/701_translator.html">Georgetown-IBM
experiment</a> in 1954 was one of the first rule-based machine
translation systems; Systran and Apertium are RBMT systems.
</p>

<p>
<em>Example Based Machine Translation (EBMT)</em> systems translate
using the results of previous translations.  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_memory">Translation
Memory</a> systems are the most basic example of EBMT; more complicated
TM systems (such as <a href="http://www.omegat.org/">OmegaT</a>), which
use techniques such as fuzzy matching to suggest similar translations,
are closer to the original idea behind EBMT.
</p>

<p>
<em>Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)</em> is, at its most basic, a
more complicated form of word translation, where statistical weights are
used to decide the most likely translation of a word. Modern SMT systems
are phrase-based rather than word-based, and assemble translations using
the overlap in phrases.  <a
href="http://www.google.com/translate_t">Google Translate</a> is based
on SMT; there is also an open-source system for SMT called <a
href="http://www.statmt.org/moses/">Moses</a>.  
</p>

<p>
Interlingua systems are an extension of rule-based systems that use an
intermediate language instead of direct translation. Systems based on
Interlingua can then more readily translate between various combinations
of languages.  <a href="http://logos-os.dfki.de/">OpenLogos</a> is an
open-source Interlingua-based machine translator, based on the Logos
system; a competitor of Systran.  
</p>

<p>
Transfer-based systems are another approach to rule-based machine
transfer, influenced by the Interlingua idea. Instead of using a whole
language, an intermediate representation of equivalent pieces is used.
This still uses language-pair-specific translation, but the amount of
language-specific rules are reduced to a minimum. There are two kinds of
transfer-based translation: shallow transfer (syntactic), where words
are translated based on combinations of word types; and deep transfer
(semantic), which uses a representation of the meaning of each word as a
basis for how it should be translated.  
</p>

<p>
Most current machine translation systems are hybrid systems: Moses is
primarily SMT, but can use morphological analysers to add extra
confidence in translation options; Apertium uses statistical methods for
word sense disambiguation.  
</p>

<p>
SMT is the current focus of most serious research in MT, but rule-based
systems still have a number of advantages. First and foremost, SMT
systems require the availability of a large amount of text in both
languages<sup><a href="#note1" name="note-1">1</a></sup>, which for most
language pairs is not available. Secondly, the generated dictionaries
contain all likely word combinations for both languages, which both
consume a lot of memory and take much more processing time than do the
kind of dictionaries used in rule-based systems (which also have the
advantage of being useful as human-readable dictionaries - <a
href="http://www.tinylex.com">TinyLex</a> is a Java ME program for
bilingual dictionaries that uses Apertium data).
</p>

<p>
Another aspect of SMT that may or may not be a drawback, depending on your
perspective, is that they use monolingual models as a way of determining how
to combine the phrases they translate. The upside is that, unless they
encounter words that don't exist in their dictionaries, the output will 
be of better quality than with rule-based translation. The downside is that
this translation may bear very little relation to the source sentence.
With a rule-based system, a bad translation will look like garbage.
</p>

<h3>Why Open Source Translation?</h3>

<p>
The best translations depend on the closeness of the languages involved: all 
other things being equal, a Spanish - Portuguese translator will give a better 
translation than a Spanish - English translator. Another factor is the domain:
words that could be ambiguous in general use may only have one meaning in a
specific context. This is well known, and for this reason, most commercial
translation systems provide the ability to choose specific domains, and to
specify meanings in a user-defined dictionary that can override the system 
dictionary.
</p>

<p>
What they don't provide, however, is a way to specify custom rules. 
</p>

<p>
In the majority of machine translation uses, documents are translated in
bulk, and later edited. Human translators are expensive, and machine
translation is used to reduce this cost, or even to remove it entirely. 
In the majority of cases, the human editor will be expected to follow an 
in-house style guide; even if the translation is accurate and clear, it
would most likely still require editing to conform to this style guide.
Even if the translator can't give better accuracy, it can still reduce 
expense by reducing the amount of editing a document requires.
</p>

<p>
The usual solution to this is to combine translation memory with automatic
translation. A better solution would be to combine translation memory
with a fully customisable machine translator - an open source machine
translator.
</p>

<p>
SMT is starting to be used by companies who seek to provide 'bespoke'
machine translators with example-based features, which can adapt as
corrections are made to the translation. However, as the selection
of a phrase is based on the amount of occurrences, the same correction
has to be made a number of times - potentially hundreds or even
thousands of times.
</p>

<p>
Consider this example:
</p>

<blockquote>
Wol&#281; piek&#322;o chaosu od piek&#322;a porz&#261;dku.<sup><a href="#note2" name="note-2">2</a></sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Polish, the preposition 'od' means 'from', with a few exceptions. The
above sentence is one example of such an exception:
</p>

<blockquote>
I prefer the hell of chaos <strong>to</strong> the hell of order.
</blockquote>

<p>
Writing a rule in Apertium to say that the preposition 'od' is 'to' 
following the verb 'wole&#263;' is quite simple, and takes a <em>lot</em>
less time than does writing enough examples for an SMT-based translator to
infer the same, and doesn't carry the risk of harming cases that were
previously handled correctly. 
</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Future</h3>

<p>
I hope I've made some of you more interested in Apertium: my next article
will be a tutorial covering the creation of morphological analysers in 
Apertium. Anyone too impatient for that can find more information on the
<a href="http://wiki.apertium.org">Apertium wiki</a>, and there are usually
a number of people available on <tt>#apertium</tt> on irc.freenode.org
available to answer questions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="note1" href="#note-1">1</a>

In a <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology-new/D/D07/D07-1005.pdf">paper</a>
from Google Research, they describe a method of overcoming this problem by
using the statistical translation probabilities of multiple languages (which
they have used recently, in their newest language additions); essentially,
cross-referencing multiple bilingual dictionaries to create new ones. The
tool that does this in Apertium is called <tt>apertium-crossdics</tt>.
(The paper also suggests that "One solution is to create such parallel data 
by automatic translation and then retaining reliable translations by using 
confidence metrics", which is a bit like saying that infinite monkeys can at 
least <em>translate</em> the works of Shakespeare).

<h1>Joey's Notes: Access Control Lists</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/prestia.html">Joey Prestia</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<img src="../gx/minilogos/joeys_notes.png" alt="Joey's Notes image" align="left" />

<p>
Linux has the ability to use <em>access control lists</em> at the file
level. This allows file owners and system administrators to define who has
access and what level of access they have beyond the level of fliesystem
permissions.
</p>

<p>
Assume that a company has a team of employees working on a project. Each
employee, depending on their role and level of responsibility, needs
a different set of permissions; this can be implemented via access 
control lists (another, and perhaps better term is <em>discretionary access control 
lists</em>.) In the event that the material is classified to some but not
to all, these ACLs make things easy for the company in that security can be
handled without the need to involve more people other than those directly
concerned.
</p>

<p>
ACLs are available with the ext3 file system. By default, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 sets the capability for ACLs on all the ext3
partitions at install time. What this means is that if you create a 
new partition that was not in existence at install time and try to use access 
control lists on it, you can't: you will have to add the mount option ACL in the 
/etc/fstab file to make that feature available.
</p>

<p>
Most relevant commands support ACL lists, but some don't; if you're in
doubt, you should check the man pages to make sure. "tar", for example,
does not support access control lists. 
</p>

<h3>Setting up a partition for ACLs</h3>

<p>
Let's walk through setting up and using ACLs to get the feel of the fine
grained-level of control that is available by using access control lists. 
Since I have unpartitioned space on this drive, I will run through the
process of setting up ACLs on the new partition: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# fdisk /dev/hda
[root@localhost ~]# partprobe
[root@localhost ~]# mkfs.ext3 -L /srv/data /dev/hda10
</pre>

<p>
Next, I need to edit the /etc/fstab file and add the new partition and the
mount options for access control lists.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# vi /etc/fstab


LABEL=/            /                       ext3    defaults        1 1
LABEL=/boot    	   /boot                   ext2    defaults        1 2
devpts             /dev/pts                devpts  gid=5,mode=620  0 0
tmpfs              /dev/shm                tmpfs   defaults        0 0
LABEL=/home        /home              	   ext3  usrquota,grpquota 1 2
proc               /proc                   proc    defaults        0 0
sysfs              /sys                    sysfs   defaults        0 0
LABEL=/tmp         /tmp                    ext3    defaults        1 2
LABEL=/usr         /usr                    ext3    defaults        1 2
LABEL=/var         /var                    ext3    defaults        1 2
LABEL=SWAP-hda3    swap                    swap    defaults        0 0
<strong>LABEL=/srv/data    /srv/data               ext3    defaults,acl    1 1</strong>
</pre>

<p>
After that, I'll make a directory and mount our new partition. 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# mkdir /srv/data
[root@localhost ~]# mount -a
</pre>

<p>
Now, I'll add a group called "programming", and create several users
belonging to that group: "teamleader", "prog1", "prog2", and "tech".
I'll also need to change the ownership and permissions on this directory
to those appropriate for our new group. As a result, files created in this
directory will belong to group "programming".
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@localhost ~]# groupadd programming
[root@localhost ~]# chown .programming /srv/data
[root@localhost ~]# chmod 2770 /srv/data
[root@localhost ~]# useradd teamleader -G programming 
[root@localhost ~]# passwd teamleader
[root@localhost ~]# useradd prog1 -G programming
[root@localhost ~]# passwd prog1
[root@localhost ~]# useradd prog2 -G programming
[root@localhost ~]# passwd prog2
[root@localhost ~]# useradd tech -G programming
[root@localhost ~]# passwd tech
[root@localhost ~]# cd /srv/data
[root@localhost data]# ls
lost+found
[root@localhost data]# su teamleader
[teamleader@localhost data]$ 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ touch project
[teamleader@localhost data]$ chmod 700 project 
</pre>

<p>
At this point the teamleader has created a project and restricted access to 
it via the filesystem.
</p>

<h3>Using getfacl</h3>

<p>
The command "getfacl" shows the ACL/permission information for a specified
file or directory:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
group::---
other::---
</pre>

<h3>Using setfacl</h3>

<p>
This command sets access controls. There are three fields on the command
line that you need to be aware of:</p>

<p>
<em><strong>identifier:user/group:permissions</strong></em></p>

<p>
The <em><strong>identifier</strong></em> can be expressed as:</p>

<pre>
 <strong>u</strong> - will affect the access rights of the specified user 	
 <strong>g</strong> - will affect the access rights of the specified group
 <strong>o</strong> - will affect the access rights of all others
 <strong>m</strong> - will affect the effective rights mask 
</pre>

<p>
<em><strong>user/group</strong></em> is the intended username or groupname,
which can also be expressed as a UID or GID.</p>
  
<p>
<em><strong>permissions</strong></em> are:</p>

<pre>
 <strong>r</strong> or <strong>4</strong> - read access
 <strong>w</strong> or <strong>2</strong> - write access
 <strong>x</strong> or <strong>1</strong> - execute permission 
 <strong>-</strong> or <strong>0</strong> - no permissions
</pre>			

<p>
Of course permissions may be combined such as <strong>r-x</strong> or 
<strong>5</strong> depending on what you want. Using the command in its 
simplest form looks like this:</p>

<p>
<strong>setfacl</strong> [options] <em>identifier</em>:<em>user/group</em>:<em> permissions</em> filename
</p>


<h3>Creating ACLs</h3>

<pre class="code">	
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -m u:prog1:rwx project 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -m u:prog2:rw- project 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
user:prog1:rwx
user:prog2:rw-
group::---
mask::rwx
other::---
</pre>

<p>
At this point we promoted our programmers permissions: "prog1" can now
read, write, and execute; and "prog2" has read and write access. Notice
also that the output from "getfacl" now has a "mask" field at the bottom:
the mask is a maximum rights level and can be used to immediately restrict
the permissions on this file. In addition, if you do an "ls -l", the
listing will show a "+" at the end of the permissions for each filename
that has ACLs enabled:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ ls -l
total 13
drwx------  2 root       programming 12288 Mar 19 21:59 lost+found
-rwxrw----+ 1 teamleader programming     0 Mar 22 20:30 project
[teamleader@localhost data]$ 
</pre>

<p>
The "programming" group needs at least <tt>read</tt> permissions on this file, since
other programmers will need to see what is in the document. If we do not
specify the group explicitly when we execute the "setfacl" command, it is
assumed as you can see below: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -m g::r project 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project 
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
user:prog1:rwx
user:prog2:rw-
group::r--
mask::rwx
other::---
</pre>

<h3>Restricting effective rights</h3> 

<p>
By changing the mask, I can change the current effective permissions to the
most restrictive level as defined by the mask and have those become the
effective permissions. Even if a user or group has permissions in excess of
what the effective mask is set to, the mask will restrict their effective
rights.
</p>

<!-- I think what he is trying to convey is that the mask supercedes
individual or group permissions, but I don't feel that's clear in the
preceding paragraph - Kat --!>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -m mask::r project 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project 
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
user:prog1:rwx                  #effective:r--
user:prog2:rw-                  #effective:r--
group::r--
mask::r--
other::---
</pre>

<h3>Removing a user from an ACL</h3>

<p>
If we want to remove one of our programmers - e.g., "prog1" - from the ACL 
for this project and revert his permissions back to what the group has, this 
would be done as follows: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -x u:prog1: project
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl project
# file: project
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
user:prog2:rw-
group::r--
mask::rw-
other::---
</pre>

<p>
The "-x" switch removes the associated user, group, or other, from the
associated access control list - so "prog1" now only has group level access
(and probably a pay cut to go with it).
</p>

<h3>Transfer of ACL attributes from a specification file</h3>  

<p>
What if we were to store our ACL attributes in a file containing the line 
"u:prog1:rwx"? We could use the "-M" switch to pass the attributes on to a new 
file.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ touch file
[teamleader@localhost data]$ echo "u:prog1:rwx" &gt; acl 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -M acl file
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl file
# file: file
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rw-
user:prog1:rwx
group::rw-
mask::rwx
other::r--
</pre>

<p>
We have successfully transferred the ACL attributes in the file "acl" to the 
empty file "file". Did you notice how the effective rights mask jumped up 
from "rw-" to "rwx"? If you did not want the effective rights mask to change 
when you modify permissions you could use the "-n" option alongside your 
other options to prevent it.
</p>

<h3>Copying the ACLs from one file to another</h3>

<p>
To copy a file's ACL to another file you would execute "<code>getfacl
filewith.acl | setfacl -b -n -M - fileneeding.acl</code>" as I will show
below. The last "-" is important; it tells "setfacl" to read the data from
standard input, which is being supplied by the preceding pipe.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl filewith.acl 
# file: filewith.acl
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rw-
user:prog1:rwx
group::rw-
mask::rwx
other::r--

[teamleader@localhost data]$ touch fileneeding.acl
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl filewith.acl | setfacl -b -n -M - fileneeding.acl 
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl fileneeding.acl
# file: fileneeding.acl
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rw-
user:prog1:rwx
group::rw-
mask::rwx
other::r--
</pre>


<h3>Inheriting a directory's ACL from the parent</h3> 

<p>
Directories can have a default ACL, which defines the access permissions
that files under the directory inherit when they are created. A default ACL
affects subdirectories as well as files. First, let's set up a directory
with a set of default permissions. Access defaults are created by using the
"-d" switch when modifying a directory.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ mkdir work
[teamleader@localhost data]$ setfacl -d -m g::r-x work/
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl work/
# file: work
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:group::r-x
default:other::r-x
</pre>

<p>
Observe as I create a child directory below, "work/week1". Notice that 
"week1" will inherit the default ACL permissions of the parent directory 
"work":
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ mkdir work/week1
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl work/week1/
# file: work/week1
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:group::r-x
default:other::r-x
</pre>

<h3>Inheriting a file's default ACLs from the parent</h3>

<p>
Last of all, let's see how these defaults propagate to a simple file
created in the "work/week1" directory. I'll show the parent's ACL first,
then create the file:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl work/week1/
# file: work/week1
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rwx
group::r-x
other::r-x
default:user::rwx
default:group::r-x
default:other::r-x

[teamleader@localhost data]$ touch work/week1/day1
[teamleader@localhost data]$ getfacl work/week1/day1 
# file: work/week1/day1
# owner: teamleader
# group: programming
user::rw-
group::r--
other::r--

[teamleader@localhost data]$ umask 
0002
</pre>

<p>
Note that the file was created with an active umask of 0002. This means
that the file should have had permissions of 664; instead it was created
with default permissions of 644 because of the default ACL on the
directory and the inheriting of the ACL from the parent directory.
</p>

<p>
This is not an exhaustive list of all the possibilities; however, just
these basics should be enough to get you started using access control lists. ACLs can be used 
to regulate permissions for special situations where regular Linux 
permissions will not quite handle the job; they can also lighten the
administrative overhead when project-level managers learn to use them 
correctly and effectively. In addition, ACLs can be a valuable tool in any 
administrator's toolbox to help regulate security.

<h3> Introduction </h3>

<p>
Let me start with pointers to the two most valuable (in my personal view)
resources that I constantly referred to prior to deciding which PCI
wireless card would be the best fit for my home system running Fedora Core
5.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://madwifi.org/wiki/Compatibility/Netgear">URL A: Madwifi Compatible Cards from Netgear</a><br>
<a href="http://linux-wless.passys.nl/query_alles.php?">URL B: Comprehensive List of cards from all vendors</a>
</p>

<p>
Buying a USB-based wireless card, however, was not on my list; after much
deliberation, I decided to buy NETGEAR's WG311 card. In hindsight, I do
agree that I should have been careful to check (at the above URLs) whether
this model/product from NETGEAR had the necessary drivers for the GNU/Linux
space. Since it didn't, I ended up having to make it work by using
"ndiswrapper". 
</p>

<h3>What is ndiswrapper?</h3>

<p>
From the project page, <a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/">http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net</a>:

<blockquote>
"Many vendors do not release specifications of the hardware or provide a
Linux driver for their wireless network cards. This project implements
Windows kernel API and NDIS API within Linux. A Windows driver for wireless
network card is then linked to this implementation so that the driver runs
natively, as though it is in Windows, without binary emulation." 
</blockquote>

<h4>Why did I buy PCI wireless card? Why not USB? </h4>

<p>
Nothing against USB wireless cards... but I needed to hook my
<em>desktop</em> system to the broadband. Given the physical distance
separating the desktop and the broadband tap provided by the local ISP, I
did not want to spoil the beauty of our home with internal wiring exposed
all over the place. Who would want to do that? 
</p>

<h3>Mad about wifi</h3>

<h4>What is madwifi? And why madwifi?</h4>

<p>
From the project page of madwifi, <a href="http://www.madwifi.org/">http://www.madwifi.org</a>:

<blockquote>
madwifi.org is [...] a team of volunteer developers working on Linux Kernel
drivers for Wireless LAN devices with Atheros chipsets. We currently
provide two drivers, MadWifi and ath5k. 
</blockquote>

<p>
Well, that's direct - and I should have realized that madwifi drivers
support Atheros chipsets but not the chipsets (from Marvell) that come with
NETGEAR's WG311 PCI wireless card. It did occur to me - as soon as I
started having trouble while configuring the wireless card.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I got the PCI wireless card, I started with configuration tasks
after ensuring it was physically installed in the PCI slot.  

<p>
Starting from <a href="http://madwifi.org">http://madwifi.org</a>, I
downloaded the sources of 0.9.4 (latest version as of this article) and
followed the steps available at the <a
href="http://madwifi.org/wiki/UserDocs/FirstTimeHowTo">Madwifi Newbie
Doc</a>. The first part was typical of installing software from sources:

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai /tmp/madwifi]# ./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install  
[root@thinnai /tmp/madwifi]# modprobe ath_pci 
</pre>

<p>
Then, I proceeded to create the interface - and this is where things
started turning ugly (to be correct, where there was careless blunder on my
part). 

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai ~]# wlanconfig ath0 create wlandev wifi0 wlanmode sta
wlanconfig: ioctl: No such device
</pre>

<p>
At this point, I referred back to the URLs mentioned at the beginning of
this article.  Both had clearly indicated that the PCI wireless card, WG311
from NETGEAR, is supported by "ndiswrapper" - <em>but not "madwifi"</em>.
</p>

<p>
I knew of only one remaining way of configuring my PCI wireless card -
i.e., by using ndiswrapper. After reading through the basic documentation
available at the <a
href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/">ndiswrapper
wiki</a>, I understood that this is done as a two-step process: 
</p>

<p>
First, install <code>ndiswrapper</code> from its sources. Then, download
and install the appropriate Windows driver. 
</p>

<p>
How did I decide which Windows driver to download? Simple - I identified
the revision of the chipset available on the PCI wireless card, then just
followed these steps listed below:
</p>

<ul type="roman">
<li> Using the "lspci" command, I figured out the card identifier; 
in this case, it was "01:07.0" as shown below (first column).

<li> Using "lspci -n" and this card identifier as a reference, I
figured out the PCI ID of the card (the third column in the command output).

<li> As the WG311 card was from NETGEAR, I chose section 'M-N' from this
URL:<br>

<a href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,list/">List M-N</a>

<li> Once I was at that list page, I found that the matching PCI ID was
listed in item 4; from there, I verified the matching PCI IDs, chipset
revision, and could now choose the right <a
href="http://www.encore-usa.com/download/driver/ENLWI-G_Driver_Utility_98SE-ME-2000-XP.zip">Windows
driver</a> for my card.

</ul>

<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Prior to configuring and installing the PCI wireless
card in GNU/Linux, I had installed the drivers in Win2k and found them to
be working perfectly.

<p>
Here is the <a
href="http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/index.php?/component/option,com_openwiki/Itemid,33/id,installation/">Wiki
page</a> detailing the steps for installing <code>ndiswrapper</code> from
sources, including the Windows driver amongst other things. 
</p>

<p>
In these installation steps, it is mentioned that one should try the WinXP
driver in preference to the Win2k drivers; under another section ("Install
Windows driver"), it is also mentioned that if the Windows driver provided
by the vendor worked, that specific driver files can be re-used. These
statements had driven me to download the Windows driver from the URL given
earlier rather than re-use the driver files from the existing Windows
installation.
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai:~]#/sbin/lspci|grep -i wireless
01:07.0 Ethernet controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88w8335 [Libertas] 802.11b/g Wireless (rev 03)
[root@thinnai ~]# lspci -n|grep 01:07
01:07.0 0200: 11ab:1faa (rev 03)
</pre>

<h3>On the right path</h3>

<h4>Installing ndiswrapper</h4>

<p>
From the ndiswrapper project Wiki, I downloaded the tarball of the latest
release. As it had been my regular practice, prior to installation, I read
through the documentation carefully (at least the initial sections of the
INSTALL file.) In this case, the initial steps to compile the sources and
install the binaries were quite straightforward. 
</p>

<p>
With current working dir as /root/ndiswrapper-1.20, I executed the following commands:
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# make &amp;&amp; make install 
[...]
*** WARNING:  Kernel is compiled with 4K stack size option (CONFIG_4KSTACKS); many Windows drivers will not 
work with this option enabled. Disable CONFIG_4KSTACKS option, recompile and install kernel 
[...]
</pre>

<p>
If you happen to see warnings at the end of "make" similar to the above,
you can safely ignore them.  This warning has not affected the
functionality of the wireless card, at least for the PCI wireless card with
the chipset revision shown above. 
</p>

<p>
As discussed previously, I downloaded the Windows driver and religiously followed the 
instructions in the "Install Windows driver" section of the INSTALL file. After extracting the 
Windows driver to another directory, I went through the following steps: 
</p>

<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# ls ../ENLWI-G_Driver_Utility_98SE-ME-2000-XP/V1.10/DRIVER/Windows\ XP/
Mrv8000c.cat  Mrv8000c.inf  Mrv8000c.sys

[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# cp ../ENLWI*/*{inf.sys} .		<strong># Copy the drivers into the current dir</strong>

[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# ndiswrapper -i Mrv8000c.inf	<strong># Install them</strong>
Installing mrv8000c
Forcing parameter AdhocGMode|1 to AdhocGMode|0
Forcing parameter AdhocGMode|1 to AdhocGMode|0

[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# ls /etc/ndiswrapper/			<strong># Confirmed the installation</strong>
mrv8000c
[root@thinnai ndiswrapper-1.20]# ls /etc/ndiswrapper/mrv8000c/
11AB:1FAA.5.conf  11AB:1FAB.5.conf  mrv8000c.inf  mrv8000c.sys
[root@thinnai lnx_data]# ndiswrapper -l
Installed drivers:
mrv8000c                driver installed, hardware present
</pre>

<p>
The next step is to configure the wireless interface, scan for access points,
and attach to one. Prior to these steps, though, I checked the version of
wireless tools: 
</p>
 
<pre class="code">
[root@thinnai ~]# rpm -qa | grep -i wireless
wireless-tools-28-0.pre13.5.1

[root@thinnai ~]# iwconfig --version
iwconfig  Wireless-Tools version 28
          Compatible with Wireless Extension v11 to v19.

Kernel    Currently compiled with Wireless Extension v19.

wlan0     Recommend Wireless Extension v18 or later,
          Currently compiled with Wireless Extension v19.
</pre>


<h3>Final Lap</h3>

<p>
After the confirmation, I wrapped the following commands up in a shell
script to ease the wireless card driver installation and activation after
every system boot (as a step forward, I could have re-written the script so
that the wireless interface is activated from /etc/init.d):
</p>
 
<pre class="code">
echo "Activating wireless interface on your computer ..."
modprobe ndiswrapper
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Status of your ethernet interfaces ... "
/sbin/ifconfig
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Activating the wireless interface ... "
/sbin/ifconfig wlan0 up
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Status of your wireless interfaces ... "
/sbin/iwconfig
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Scanning your wireless networks, joining available n/w also ..."
iwlist wlan0 scan
/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 essid default
/sbin/iwconfig wlan0
echo "===================================================================="
echo "Acquiring IP address for the wireless interface ... "
dhclient wlan0
</pre>

<p>
Below, I have listed the commands that I used to verify the status of the
PCI wireless interface with ndiswrapper installed and activated. I did this
via the "dhclient" command:
<p>

<pre class="code">
Acquiring IP address for the wireless interface ...

</pre>

<p>
Results of simple check to validate the connectivity:
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Patiently and carefully read through the wireless support URLs (listed in
the Intro section of this article) prior to deciding which card to buy. If
you have to set up and configure a PCI/USB wireless card in a GNU/Linux
environment that isn't supported by madwifi, don't feel let down;
ndiswrapper is there to help you out of the quagmire.
</p>

<p>
I would be happy to hear from the community if there are better and proven
ways to set up and configure PCI wireless cards under GNU/Linux!

<h1>A Slightly Advanced Introduction to Vim</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/srinivasan.html">Pranesh Srinivasan</a></b></p>

</b>
</p>

<p>
<h3>What is it?</h3>

<pre>
        "It is the little things that make up great men." 
</pre>

<p>
This introduction is about the little things. Things that help ease everyday tasks but go a 
long way into making you a better user, editor, programmer - a better computer user.
</p>

<p>
This piece started out as a 'write-while-you-learn' exercise while reading a vim tutorial.
As I kept writing, I felt that with a little more work, and some polishing, this could
be turned into vim introduction of sorts.
</p>


<h3>Who is it for?</h3>
<p>
This is not a five minute introduction to vim for a complete newbie. I presume you have used vim before 
and are comfortable with moving around, and making changes. Although <em>:vimtutor</em> is not a 
prerequisite to this tutorial, I highly recommend it.
</p>

<p>
This document contains some mnemonics, and some slightly advanced features of vim that can 
help the average vim user/programmer increase his/her productivity by leaps and bounds.
</p>


<h3>Why does it exist?</h3>
<p>
I find a large number of people around me who have used vim a few times while writing 
programs. Very few of them have grown into becoming effective vim users. The majority drop out
because of its initially daunting interface. A good number of the interested users switch
to emacs, because they think the 'power' just isn't there with vim. I am not saying emacs
is bad, but I just cannot stand decisions made on lack of information.
</p>

<p>
This document is written with an aim to convert the odd
"I-just-use-vim-over-ssh" user to a full-fledged user, and to illustrate
the kind of power that vim provides.
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, vim is not just for programmers; it can be used by anybody and everybody
who deals with text in any form. Vim runs on many platforms including Mac, Windows, and Solaris, and 
is a standard on every Linux machine. Someday you might find yourself sitting on a terminal
with only vim installed.
</p>

<h3>Some Notation</h3>

<p>
Any command mentioned here is to be typed in the <tt>normal</tt> mode. The normal
mode is the mode one gets when he/she presses <em>&lt;Esc&gt;</em> in vim.
There are three main modes in vim: <tt>insert</tt>, <tt>normal</tt> and <tt>visual</tt>
(vim documentation says there are six BASIC and five Additional modes...)
</p>

<p>
Commands are generally indented with respect to the rest of the text. Any command prefixed by a ":" is 
also to be typed in the normal mode, with the colon. Of course they have to be suffixed by
an 'Enter' or carriage return.
</p>

<p>
In cases where a command has to be typed in the <tt>visual</tt> mode, it will be mentioned explicitly.
</p>

<p>
The commands described here should work with any recent version of vim, or gvim.
I used vim 7.0 for this, and some features like omni-completion and spell checking
are available only on it. If several commands in this document do not work, you might
wish to try <em>:set nocompatible</em> followed by a carriage return or 'Enter' in your vim.
</p>

<h3>Just in case</h3>
<p>
Just in case you are new to vim, or have completely forgotten the vim commands, and are still
brave and enthusiastic to try reading this, I won't leave you behind. Here is a five minute 
tutorial to vim.
</p>

<p>
Type 'vim' followed by a filename in your prompt to bring up vim.
</p>
 
<pre>
	$ vim filename
	# Or, for a GUI interface:
	$ gvim filename
</pre>

<p>
This will launch vim with the default directory in vim set to the directory the terminal was in.
</p>

<p>
You can quit vim by typing 
</p>

<pre>
	:q
	# Or, for the 'quit without saving' mode:
	:q!
</pre>

<p>
Once, in vim, you can move around using <em>h</em>, <em>j</em>, <em>k</em>, and <em>l</em>.
</p>

<pre>
        h - left
        j - down
        k - up 
        l - right
</pre>
        
<p>
Try to refrain from using the arrow keys. These keys were chosen, because
they lie on the home row and save the user a lot of time, and unnecessary
fumbling with the arrow keys. After you get used to them, you'll hate
having to use arrow keys in other text editors.
</p>

<p>
To insert text at a location, hit <em>i</em>. This will put you into insert
mode. The bottom left of your screen should read something similar to 
</p>

<pre>
        -- INSERT --
</pre>

<p class="editorial">[ This presumes that 'showmode' has been set. If you
don't see the above, and would like to, add 'set showmode' to your ~/.vimrc
file. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
Type in text till you are done. Use backspace if necessary. Avoid using
delete and the arrow keys.  If you are done, or you think you need to
navigate elsewhere, hit <em>&lt;ESC&gt;</em>. <em>Control+[</em> should
also do.  I do not recommend the second however, since it is present only
as backward compatibility on several old machines that did not have the
<em>Esc</em> Key.
</p>

<p>
You are now back into the normal mode. You can move around with <em>h</em>,
<em>j</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>l</em> again. That should be just enough. Spend
some time trying to get comfortable with it.
</p>

<p>
Save and exit with
</p>

<pre>
        :w followed by :q
        or simply :wq
</pre>

<p>
<em>Let's begin!</em>
</p>

<h3>The art of insertion</h3>
<p>
Several people around me often tell me that their greatest difficulty with
a major-mode editor like vim, is that they never know which mode they are
in.
</p>

<p>
If you are one like them, the answer is pretty simple. Vim was not designed
to be used the way you are using it. Vim was designed for short bursts of
insertion. Vim was designed around the idea that people tend to type text
for a much shorter time than they spend reading, editing, and revising it.
Therefore if you need to get up for coffee, or pick up the phone, or are
done with that sentence of yours, hit the <em>Esc</em> button.
</p>

<p>
Vim provides several keys to help you get to the right cursor position to
insert characters.  We list some of the more useful ones here.
</p>

<pre>
        i               insert BEFORE Cursor
        a               insert AFTER Cursor (append)

        shift+i (or I)  insert at BEGINNING of line
        shift+a (or A)  append at the END of line
</pre>

<p>
Noticing similarities? Good, because that is what vim is about. A lot of vim is actually very
intuitive. 
</p>

<p>
<em>Great! So how do you go about creating new lines?</em>
</p>
<pre>
        o               create a new line BELOW the current line, and put the cursor at the start of
                        the new line.

        shift+o (or O)  create a new line ABOVE the current line, and put the cursor at the start of
                        the new line
</pre>
        
<p>
<em>Wonderful! I do not have to &lt;End&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Home&gt;&lt;Shift+Enter&gt;. How do I edit text?</em>
</p>

<pre>
        r               replace the char at the cursor position and come back into escape mode.
                        In other words, replace a char
        shift+r (or R)  go into what people would generally call the replace mode. Vim is pretty 
                        intelligent. Have a look at how the backspace works in this mode.
</pre>
        
<p>
<em>Ok! How do I remove characters?</em>
</p>

<pre>
        x               remove char under the cursor. Similar to delete.
        shift+x (or X)  remove char before cursor. Works like backspace.
</pre>

<h3>Visual Mode</h3>

<p>
Selecting in vim, can be done with the mouse, if mousemodel is set
properly. See <em>:help mousemodel</em> on this.  But the recommended way
of selecting is to use the visual mode.
</p>

<p>
In normal mode, hit <em>v</em> . You will notice at the bottom left of your screen
</p>

<pre>
                -- VISUAL --
</pre>

<p>
or something similar.
</p>

<p>
Moving around with <em>h</em>, <em>j</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>l</em> will now
select text. You can delete (cut) the selection with <em>x</em>, or copy,
paste, them with keys <em>y</em> and <em>p</em>. As soon as you have done
any of these, you should be out of visual mode.  To otherwise exit visual
mode, you can hit the magic key, <em>Esc</em>.
</p>

<p>
<em>y</em> stands for Yank and <em>p</em> for Paste. Try them out. More on this will follow.
</p>

<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
<p>
With all that copying and pasting, you are bound to make mistakes. So how do you undo? Control+Z? No. In normal
mode simply hit <em>u</em> . Are you beginning to see the power of major modes here? Keys are often very 
short and intuitive.
</p>

<p>
How do you redo? <em>r</em>? No, both <em>r</em> and <em>R</em> were taken
by replace modes. You do <em>Control+R</em> to redo.
</p>

<p>
How much can you undo? Quite a lot actually. In the more recent versions,
you can undo to any point since the current session of vim was started.
</p>

<p>
The latest version of vim at the time of writing, vim 7.0 even has support
for undo branches.
</p>

<p>
You can say something like
</p>

<pre>
	:earlier 10m
	
	 # or
	
	:earlier 2h
</pre>

<p>
and it would take you to 10 minutes or 2 hours ago. (If vim was open two
hours ago.)
</p>

<p>
Similarly <em>:later</em>.
</p>

<p>
What we have covered so far, are just the mere basics. This is stuff that
most people know. If you didn't, you do now! What comes from here on is the
important part. Learning to use vim as a Swiss Army knife for text and
programming.
</p>

<h3>Copying, Deleting, Pasting</h3>

<p>
In vim, a selection can be copied by yanking, or <em>y</em>. This is
different from emacs' yank, which pastes. In vim, the paste command is
<em>p</em>. Pasting and yanking can be done into registers too.  There are
no deletes in vim. Everything goes into the paste buffer - or, optionally,
into a register named with a single character from the {a-zA-Z0-9} list.
</p>

<pre>
        y       : copy selection. (Use visual or implicitly copy like yas to yank a sentence - see 
                  Mnemonics below)
        yy      : copy current line.
        Y       : copy current line.
        d       : delete (cut) selection. Same usage as y.
        dd      : delete (cut) current line.
        D       : delete from here till end of line.
        p       : paste selection (Pasting is intelligent. If you copy a whole line, it will put 
                  it below the current line.) see 'ddp' below in keyboard combos

</pre>
<p>
Note that the scope of the action of <em>Y</em> is different from that of
<em>D</em>; indeed, <em>Y</em> = <em>yy</em>. If you want to set it to what
would you have expected normally read the section on mapping below.
</p>

<pre>
        "fy     : copy selection and paste in register f
        "fd     : delete selection and paste in register f
        (This works with "xyy "xY and all other similar things too.)

        "fp     : paste what is present in registers f.
</pre>

<p>
You can look at the registers by using the ':reg[isters]' command.  In your
version of vim, uppercase registers may be restricted by default, so I
suggest not using them.
</p>

<p class="editorial">
[ Using an uppercase register name appends a 'y'ank or a 'd'elete to the
existing register content; the lowercase version replaces it. -- Ben ]
</p>

<p>
The other registers are special, often storing text, or marks (see below)
for other commands. Therefore these should not be touched. An exception is
the '+' register.
</p>

<p>
Vim's clipboard is independent of the external OS clipboard. Vim imports the text in the OS 
Clipboard into the '+' register. In order to paste something copied into another application 
use the '+' register. Command : <em>"+p</em>
</p>

<p>
As expected, copying or cutting into that register '+' will write to the OS clipboard. 
So if you want to copy something into another program, use <em>"+y</em>
</p>


<h3>Mnemonics</h3>

<p>
Mnemonics are commands to perform common tasks. What separates them from
being normal commands is the underlying ability to remember them from the
task they do. To understand and use mnemonics well, one must first
understand text objects. See <em>:help text-objects</em>, or read the
subsection under "text objects" below. As an example of a mnemonic, take
'<em>ctx</em>':
</p>

<pre>
	ctx - <strong>c</strong>hange <strong>t</strong>ill <strong>x</strong> (deletes from here until first character 'x', and puts you insert mode)
	dtx - <strong>d</strong>elete <strong>t</strong>ill <strong>x</strong> 
</pre>
        

<h4><a name="section_1_10_1_1">Mnemonics that fall under text objects</a></h4>
<p>
There are several objects in vim that act as text-objects: words,
sentences, blocks, etc.. Vim gives you the power to use them in selections
and edits.
</p>

<pre>
        daw - delete a word
        dw - delete from here till end of word
        daW - delete a Word(includes special chars, except space)
        dW - delete from here till end of Word

        das - delete the sentence we are in
        daB - delete an inner Block of code {}
</pre>
<p>
Rules like the above can be applied in general to text objects:
</p>

<pre>
        s - sentence
        w - word
        W - WORD
        t - tag ( 'dat' removes from &lt;xml-style-tag&gt; till &lt;/xml-style-tag&gt;
        p - paragraph
        B - block of code ( '{' or '}' works only for C-style blocks)

        Bracket forms:
                ( or ) - parenthesis ( ... )
                [ or ] - [ .. ]
                &lt; or &gt; - refers to &lt;....&gt;
                { or } - a { block also referred to by the above b

        Quote forms:
                Just like the bracket forms
                ", ', ` - can be used for referring to text-objects delimited by them.
</pre>

<p>
These things can therefore be used in a manner similar to
</p>

<pre>
        da&lt;text-object&gt; : delete a text object
        di&lt;text-object&gt; : delete the inner part of the text object.
        (This leaves the () or the spaces in words or the {} in blocks)
</pre>
<p>
Their use does not end here; remember, vim is intelligent. They can be used
during visual selections as well. In visual mode hit <em>as</em> to select
a sentence. Similarly a word can be selected with <em>aw</em> or a block in
with a '}'.
</p>

<p>
Read <em>:help text-objects</em> for more info.
</p>

<h3>Prefixing Numbers</h3>

<p>
Almost every command can be prefixed with a number to repeat it in a
sensible way. E.g.,
</p>

<pre>
	# Go down 6 lines
	6j
	# Delete the next 10 lines
	10 dd
</pre>

<p>
This is a very underused function that can greatly improve text editing
ease. 
</p>

<h3>Slightly Advanced Navigation</h3>

<h4>Simple Navigation on a line</h4>

<p>
Vim provides you with several one touch commands to get to a particular
character on the line. This coupled with a good use of vim's insertion
techniques should put you where you want with almost no effort.
</p>

<p>
We first learn how to move by words, since moving by characters can often
be slow and demanding.
</p>

<pre>
        <em>(ptca = puts the cursor at)</em>

        w - Takes you a word ahead. ptca the start of the
            next word. ('W' does nearly the same thing, but for "words"
			that may include special characters (excluding 'space'))
        e - ptca the end of this word. If the cursor is already
            under the end of this word, takes you to the end of the next word.
        b - move back a word; ptca the start of the previous
            word
</pre>

<p>
Next, it is important to know how to get to particular positions on a line.
Important places are the start of the line, and the end of the line.
</p>

<pre>
        0 - ptca the start of line
</pre>

<p>
Remember regular expressions? Vim tries to make the learning curve easier.
The following two commands should come naturally if you keep regular 
expressions in mind.
</p>

<pre>
        ^ - ptca the first non-blank character of line
        $ - ptca the end of the line 
</pre>

<p>
The following commands are really useful as well. They let you get to the
nearest instance of a character on a particular line.   
</p>

<pre>
        fx - ptca at the next instance (in the forward direction)
             of character 'x' in the same line.
        Fx - ptca the previous instance of the character
</pre>

<p>
These also form the building blocks whenever generic movement is 
required - like in macros.
</p>

<h4>The g commands</h4>

<p>
The 'g' commands, as I call them, refer to a useful set of 'goto' commands
that ease moving around. Merely stating them should suffice.
</p>

<pre>
        1G - takes you the start of the file
        0G - to the end of file
</pre>
<p>
A good way to remember this is that '1' often appears before (to the left) of '0'
on the number row (above the qwerty row) on a qwerty keyboard.
</p>
<pre> 
        gD - takes you to the first (intelligent) instance of the word under
             the cursor in the same file. It is intelligent, since in a programming
             language, it takes you to the definition or the declaration of the function
             or variable.
        gj - goto next line. (Huh?). This is the same as j when the lines do not wrap.
             When the lines do wrap around the editor, hitting j would take you over to the next
             new line. gj will take you the same character in the next row. (Try it).
        gk - Similar.
        (To avoid wrapping do :set nowrap)
</pre>
<p>
Note indeed that the small 'g' is called the extended operator in vim. It 
performs a lot more than merely goto. Indeed the user can see <em> :help g </em>
 for more information. I'll mention a few useful ones:
</p>

<pre>
		gf - Open the filename under the cursor
		ga - Print ascii value of character under the cursor.
		gs - put vim to sleep for 1 second. Of course, like most
			 vim commands, you can prefix this with a number to get
			 a general sleep command.
</pre>

<h4>Mark Mnemonics</h4>

<p>
Marks are a very useful feature in vim. They enable you to mark your
current position, and move away for a while. You can then go back to the
old cursor position by hitting a couple of keys.
</p>

<pre>
        ma      - mark current position with letter 'a'.
        `a      - go back to mark a
        'a      - put the cursor at the start of line a
        :marks    to see a list of marks made.
</pre>

<p>
Marks are intelligent. Even if you make edits to the text before the mark, thereby
changing its line number or make edits on the line itself (affecting character number),
vim will manage the marks aptly. You will still be able to return to your old mark with
the same key combination. Note that mark movements are often called jumps.
</p>

<p>
There are a few registers that are set by default. I list a few helpful ones below:
</p>

<pre>
        ``      - go back to the last cursor position before a jump.
        `.      - go back to where the cursor the last time an edit was made.
                  This puts your cursor at the start of the edit.
        '(      - go to the start of the current sentence
        ')      - go to the end of the current sentence
        '{      - go to the start of the current paragraph
        '}      - go to the end of the current paragraph
</pre>

<h4>Moving to a line</h4>

<p>
To navigate to line foobar, simply type <em>:foobar</em> or
<em>foobarG</em> . E.g., to navigate line 234:
</p>

<pre>
	:234 
	234G
</pre>

<p>
I strongly recommend using the <em>:number</em>, because you will be able to see the line
number you are typing.
</p>

<p>
As always, remember in vim, if you make a mistake in the middle of a command hit
<em>&lt;Esc&gt;</em>
</p>

<p>
Of course, if you have been there before, and go there frequently enough, I
would suggest marking it. Even though it does not seem that great a
feature, it comes in handy when you have to debug programs.
</p>

<h4>Navigating Screenfulls</h4>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, a design aspect in vim was to allow your hands to stay 
on the home row. So how do you do it without moving your hands to PageUp and
PageDown? 
        
</p>

<pre>
	Control+(f/F)   move forward a screen  (PageDown)
	Control+(b/B)   move backward a screen (PageUp)
	Control+u       moving up half a screen
	Control+d       moving down half a screen
</pre>

<p>
There is one last thing you should know about navigation. In case the line number does not 
show to the bottom left (ruler is set to off), just hit <em>Control+G</em>. This should show you 
the line number and some other statistics in the bottom status bar.
</p>

<h3>Power Keystrokes</h3>

<p>
Think of Power Keystrokes as combos in an arcade-style fighter game. It helps you do several
mundane oft-repeated tasks with a couple of key strokes. The meaning of each of the key
strokes is already known, just like light punches and hard kicks. Putting them together
in specific ways produces several desirable results. We illustrate a few of them to follow.
</p>

<pre>
        xp  - switch the current char and the next
        ddp - switch the current line and the next
        A;  - append a semicolon to the end of the line.
        &gt;&gt;  - increase indent of current line.
        &lt;&lt;  - decrease indent of current line.
</pre>

<h3>Finding and Substituting</h3>

<p>
Finding is a relatively simple job in vim. Just hit '/' in normal mode, and
start typing.  Hit <em>Enter</em> to search.  The key <em>n</em> will take
you to the next search, and <em>Shift+n</em> or <em>N</em> to the previous.
</p>

<p>
A very useful tip when it comes to searching is the '#' key and the '*'
key. These search for the word under the cursor, backwards and forwards
respectively. To sum it up,
</p>

<pre>
        /foobar&lt;Enter&gt;  search for foobar
        n               go to the next result
        N               go to the prev result
        #               search for the word under the cursor (back)
        *               search for the word under the cursor (fwd)
</pre>

<p>
The substitute command is slightly more complicated. However, when in the right hands 
it can prove to be wizardly. The syntax of the substitute command is as follows:
</p>

<pre>
        :[range]s[ubstitute]/pattern/string/[options]
</pre>

<p>
The range is a very interesting argument to play around with. Here we take a look at vim's 
:help range to see what we can do.
</p>

<pre>
        Range           What it means
        ------          --------------
        {number}        an absolute line number
        .               the current line                          
        $               the last line in the file                 
        %               equal to 1,$ (the entire file)            
        *               equal to '&lt;,'&gt; (the Visual area)          
        't              position of mark t (lower case)           
        /{pattern}[/]   the next line where {pattern} matches     
        ?{pattern}[?]   the previous line where {pattern} matches 
        \/              the next line where the previously used search
                        pattern matches
        \?              the previous line where the previously used search
                        pattern matches
        \&amp;              the next line where the previously used substitute
                        pattern matches
</pre>

<p>
Most substitution commands in vim are often written as
<em>:%s/old_string/new_string</em>, for obvious reasons.
</p>

<p>
Again looking into vim's help for the options we get (in brief):
</p>

<pre>
        Option          What it means
        ------          --------------
        c               Ask before substitution. (Check)
        e               Don't cough Error messages if no such pattern is not found.
        g               Global (replace all occurrences in the line).
        i               Ignore case.
        I               Do not ignore case.
        n               Do not substitute. Only return the number of successful matches.
</pre>

<p>
For, e.g., a substitution of the form
</p>

<pre>
        :1,'bs/dog/cat/ceg
</pre>

<p>
would replace dog with cat after checking with you, for all instances in that line, from
line 1 to the line where mark was set as b. It will not throw any errors if 'dog' was not found.
</p>

<p>
See the section on "Dealing with Multiple files" for substituting and searching across 
multiple files.
</p>

<h3>Useful Navigating Techniques for Programmers</h3>

<p>
Even though this could have been fit into the section on navigation above, I decided to make it 
another section to emphasise it further.
</p>

<p>
Vim provides various techniques to the programmer. The most useful one is the jump parenthesis
shortcut.
        
</p>

<pre>
        %       jumps between matching pairs of parenthesis () {} [] &lt;&gt;. With the match-it addon,
                it will jump between matching tags in html files - between the &lt;div ... &gt; and the 
                corresponding &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
One might also find the 'goto' command very useful.
</p>

<pre>
	gD      takes you to the global declaration of the variable or function under the cursor.
			However, this will only do so in the same file.

	gF		takes you to the filename under the cursor. Very useful for
			jumping to header files.
</pre>
        
<p>
Vim also integrates with ctags, in a nice and natural way. However, I suggest that you read the help
manual for this.
</p>

<h3>Folds</h3>

<p>
Folds are a wonderful way to organise and group code. Of course, it can be used for editing text,
LaTeX documents, and several other things, but the clarity it gives to code is fascinating.
</p>

<p>
There are several folding methods available in vim. I shall describe only
the manual ones, and briefly mention the rest. More information can be
gotten from <em>:help fold</em> .
</p>

<p>
As with a few other things of this kind, I feel that folds are best
illustrated by an example. Pick a text file, preferably a large one, that
does not fit on one screen. Open it in vim, and place your cursor anywhere
you like. In normal mode, type 
</p>

<pre>
        zf3j 
</pre>

<p>
After you press <em>j</em>, vim will create a fold covering the next 3 lines. How did it happen? Well, <em>zf</em> means
to close a fold, and knowing vim's movements <em>3j</em> is to come down 3 lines. So from the current position to 
3 lines down, vim folds.
</p>

<p>
Vim also supports folding using visual mode. Simply select a piece of text,
and type <em>zf</em>. It should fold as well. Another option is to specify
a range in command mode. For instance, if you wanted to create a fold from
3 lines above to 101th line, you would do 
</p>

<pre>
        :-3, 101 fold 
</pre>

<p>
and hit enter. From 3 lines above to line 101, vim should have folded. Vim
will suitably reverse the range for you if 3 lines above was greater than
101 after prompting. You could have also used markers if necessary.
</p>

<p>
Vim can also make some smart text selections. Suppose you are writing C
code. You can position your cursor on a '{' and hit 
</p>

<pre>
        zfa} 
</pre>

<p>
This will fold till the matching '}'. Of course, as we learnt above you
could also use the more natural 
</p>

<pre>
        zf% 
</pre>

<p>
to perform the same operation. Finally, you can also use a search-fold
technique. You can hit z/ and start typing for the string required. It will
fold from the current line to the first instance it finds the search
string. Therefore, typing in
</p>

<pre>
        z/SearchString
</pre>

<p>
would fold appropriately.
</p>

<p>
Like someone once said, folding is only half the fun. At some point, you'll
no doubt want to unfold the text. To do this, simply place your cursor on
the same line as the fold and type
</p>

<pre>
        zo
</pre>

<p>
This will reopen the fold. This will not delete the fold. Type
</p>

<pre>
        zc
</pre>

<p>
to close it back up when you are finished. To move between various folds quickly, use 
</p>

<pre>
        zj for next fold
        zk for previous fold
</pre>

<h4>Nested folds</h4>

<p>
As said before, vim allows nested folds. If you use <em>zo</em>, it will
open only the first fold; the other folds will stay closed.  The following
commands will prove helpful in dealing with nested folds  
</p>

<pre>
        zO (shift+o)    open all nested folds on that line (<em>zc</em> will close them too)

        zr              open the highest level of folds in the file. For eg, all the first 
                        level folds.
        zR              open all folds of all levels in the file

        zm              close all highest level of open folds in the file.
        zM              close all folds of all levels in the file.

        zE              delete a fold
</pre>

<p>
Delete a fold with caution. vim's undo and redo features don't apply to folds; if you delete a fold, 
you can't press u and bring it back, and the <em>.</em> command won't run the last fold command.
</p>

<p>
How does vim deal with folds when searching for text? It acts as if the fold is not present. If the word
is found while searching within a fold, it will open the fold. Vim is untidy with this. It does not close 
the fold when you move your cursor out. However a quick zm will restore the folds.
</p>

<p>
Once you close the document you created all the folds in, all the folds will be lost. Therefore, you must
ensure to save your folds before you exit. You must also load the saved folds after you open it again. This
can be done with the following commands.
</p>

<pre>
        :mkview         make a foldview
        :loadview 
</pre>
<p>
You can of course automate this by adding the following to your .vimrc:
        
</p><pre>
        au BufWinLeave * mkview
        au BufWinEnter * silent loadview
</pre>
<p>
There exist other folding methods like those mentioned before. Notable ones
are <tt>diff</tt> (via 'vim -d file1 file2'), which set only the edited lines
unfolded, and <tt>indent</tt> which folds depending on indent.
</p>

<h3>Visual mode Selections</h3>

<p>
Visual mode provides what can be called 3 minor modes.
</p>

<pre>
        v       - enters visual mode.
        Shift+v - enters visual mode, where only lines (in full or none) can be selected. 
        Ctrl+v  - enters rectangular visual (block mode).
</pre>

<p>
Play around with these for a while. This should let you become more adept at using Visual. The rectangular
visual mode is very useful in temporarily commenting code, or in removing comments.
</p>

<p>
Suppose we had a code block like
        
</p>

<pre>
        int main()
        {
                register int k;
                ...
                ...
        }
</pre>

<p>
Put your cursor at the start of the main declaration. Hit <em>Ctrl+v</em>
followed by <em>6j</em>. Then hit <em>Shift+i</em> and type
//. Finally hit <em>Esc</em> to come out of the visual mode.
</p>

<p>
This should comment the entire block with C++ style comments.
</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>
Vim lets you run shell commands from itself by typing 
</p>

<pre>
        :! shell-command
</pre>

<p>
With the concept of a GNU-like "one utility per action" system, the
concept of filters is inevitable. By using a filter, we can send 
text in our buffer (screen) to an external command -
say 'indent' or 'sort' - whose output is then sent back into vim. 
</p>

<p>
Using the range concept given above, one could write things like
</p>

<pre>
        :%!gpg
</pre>

<p>
to encrypt one's message with their personal key. 
</p>

<p>
Here are a couple of other examples
</p>

<pre>
        :%!tr a-z n-za-m (This will ROT13 our data :))

        :.,+5!sort
</pre>

<p>
As mentioned above in the range section, <em>.</em> represents the current line. 
A positive number means below, and a negative number means above.
</p>

<h3>Making Projects</h3>

<p>
With tools like filters learnt above, we could 'make' our projects with commands like
</p>

<pre>
        :!gcc -Wall -g foo.c -o bar
</pre>

<p>
or syntax check them with               
</p>

<pre>
        :!gcc -fsyntax-only % 
</pre>

<p>
Vim however provides its user with a make command. You can set a make program with the
command
</p>

<pre>
        :set makeprg=gcc\ -g\ %
</pre>

<p>
and subsequently make by doing
        
</p>

<pre>
        :make
</pre>

<p>
It accepts command line arguments, enabling you to do things like       
        
</p>

<pre>
        :make all
        :make install
</pre>

<p>
The default <em>makeprg</em> is set to 'make' in the directory vim currently is in. This by default
was the directory our terminal was in, when vim or gvim was called. See the section on 
"Browsing files with Vim" below to find out the current directory and to change it.
</p>

<p>
If there were any errors, vim will display them to you. If you are using a fairly common 
language, vim can even parse the error file and tell you a whole lot more. Pressing 'Enter' 
in the error window should by default take you to the first error.
        
</p>

<p>
In the case the errors can be parsed, the following should be the
holy-grail combinations:
</p>

<pre>
        :cc     -       will show you the current error
        :cn     -       will take you to the next error
        :cN     -       will take you to the prev error
        :copen  -       opens the error window in a small buffer
                        where you can browse errors. Hit &lt;Enter&gt; to be
                        taken to that error.
</pre>

<p>
This should make your compile -&gt;  edit -&gt; compile cycle a lot easier on you.
</p>

<h3>Dealing with Multiple Files</h3>

<p>
Often, programmers or developers have multiple files in their buffers.
I assume you know how to split windows, and all that jazzy stuff. If not,
you could read the Vim tutorial <em>:help vsplit</em> 
</p>

<p>
From vim7.0 onwards, tabs are supported. Tabs can be opened by
        
</p><pre>
        :tabnew file.txt
</pre>

<p>
To cycle through tabs one would use <em>:tabnext</em> (<em>:tabn</em>) and
<em>:tabprevious</em> (<em>:tabp</em>).  One can by default, also go to the
previous/next tab by using <em>Control+PgUp</em> and <em>Control+PgDwn</em>
provided of course there are no other open programs mapped to that
application. (A common program is gnome-terminal with multiple tabs.)
</p>

<p>
Another way to open and edit multiple files is the buffer. Any file you open
is in your buffer till you close it. To open a file in a buffer simply use
the normal edit command 
</p>

<pre>
        :e foo.txt 
</pre>

<p>
For dealing with buffers, one should find the following commands useful:
</p>

<pre>
        :bfirst         switch to the first buffer
        :bn             switch to next buffer
        :bp             switch to prev buffer
        :blast          switch to the last buffer
        :ls             list all currently open buffers
        :buf foo.txt    switch to foo.txt in the buffer
</pre>

<p>
The main power of buffers comes in dealing with them in a batch. Vim has the 
command <tt>bufdo</tt>, which allows you to run a command over all the files in your
buffer.
</p>

<pre>
        :bufdo {cmd}
</pre>

<p>
Quoting the vim Manual,
</p>

<p>
What this basically does is 
</p>

<pre>
        :bfirst
        :{cmd}
        :bnext
        :{cmd}
         etc ...
</pre>

<p>
When the current file can't be abandoned and the [!] is not present, the
command fails.  When an error is detected on one buffer, further buffers
will not be visited.  Unlisted buffers are skipped.  The last buffer (or
where an error occurred) becomes the current buffer.  {cmd} can contain '|'
to concatenate several commands. {cmd} must not delete buffers or add
buffers to the buffer list.
</p>

<p>
To search in multiple files one would simply do
        
</p><pre>
        :bufdo /searchstring/
</pre>

<p>
To search and replace for example, one might do
</p>

<pre>
        :bufdo %s/oldtext/newtext/ge
</pre>

<p>
There are other cool things you could do with buffers. You could backup
your entire project into a tarball by doing something like 
</p>

<pre>
        :silent bufdo !tar -rvf backup.tar %
</pre>

<p>
Of course, the files do not have to be open in vim, you could set the args variable
in vim, and use a similar argdo.
</p>

<p>
For eg. to indent all files in foobar/ one would do
        
</p>

<pre>
        :args foobar/*
        :argdo !indent % | update
</pre>

<p>
update writes the file only if changes were made.
</p>

<h3>Browsing files with Vim</h3>

<p>
Open a directory with 'vim path/to/dir' or from within vim, <em>:e path/to/dir</em>.
A file browser opens up that one can use to browse, and make modifications.
Use <em>&lt;Enter&gt;</em> to enter a directory, and <em>j</em>, <em>k</em> to move up and down.
</p>

<p>
The following should be helpful:
</p>

<pre>
        d - to make a directory
        D - to delete one
        R - to rename
</pre>

<p>
You can set the directory vim is in by using the cd command as
</p>

<pre>
        :cd path/to/dir
</pre>

<p>
As expected you can use <em>:pwd</em> to find out the present directory vim is in.
</p>

<p>
Having the <em>netrw</em> plugin installed, allows one to access and edit files on a remote
machine as well, through protocols like ssh and ftp.
</p>

<h3>Mapping Commands and abbreviations</h3>

<p>
Mapping commands and abbreviations are an essential part of the
programmer's lifeline in vim.
</p>

<p>
Commands can be mapped as follows:
</p>

<pre>
        :map &lt;keystrokes&gt; command-to-be-executed
</pre>

<p>
This will map it in both modes. Use nmap if you want to map it only in the normal mode
and imap for the insert mode.
</p>

<p>
As an example, one might consider
</p>

<pre>
        :nmap \cc !gcc\ -g\ %
</pre>

<p>
This would mean typing <em>\cc</em> (quickly) in the normal mode would execute the gcc compilation
on the current program with debugging enabled.
</p>

<p>
Abbreviations are really useful things to have in one's armory. They let
you substitute a larger word for a smaller one, or fix your common
mistypes. An example should state this clearly enough:
</p>

<pre>
	:iab cs Computer Science.
	:iab mroe more
</pre>

<p>
This would replace 'cs ' (followed by the space) with Computer Science
every time I type it, and replace 'mroe' with 'more'.  The i stands for
insert mode, and the ab for abbreviate. One could do <em>:ab</em> as well,
though it is not recommended. (It might substitute one of your \cs commands
with '\Computer Science'.)
</p>

<p>
To unset the above mapping or abbreviation simply type 
</p>

<pre>
        :unmap \cc  or 
        :unab cs 
</pre>

<p>
respectively.
</p>

<p>
If you want these abbreviations or mappings to remain over various uses of
vim, simply put them in your '~/.vimrc'.
</p>

<p>
As a final example, let us take the remapping of <em>Y</em> to the more
intuitive way of using it.  You would do
</p>
<pre>
        :map Y y$
</pre>
<p>
for this session, and to store it permanently, append
</p>
<pre>
        map Y y$
</pre>
<p>
to your '~/.vimrc'.
</p>

<h2>Macros</h2>
<p>
These are amazingly powerful tools to help you automate your work. It is
like a writing a program to help you do some word processing, without
having to learn another programming language.
</p>

<p>
Imagine the power you'd have if you could write programs with vim
keystrokes to process text. This is precisely what Macros allow you to do.
Macros take a set of keys as input from you and store them in a register of
your choice. (Yes, this is the same set of registers you copy into and
paste from, so don't accidentally overwrite them). You can then run the
command specified by the keys in that register.
</p>

<p>
The syntax for declaring macros is:
</p>

<pre>
        qx&lt;set of commands&gt;q
        (The second q has to be hit in the normal mode only.)
</pre>

<p>
This stores the set of commands in register <em>x</em>. To run it simply type <em>@x</em>. <em>@@</em> runs the last
run macro.
</p>

<p>
Macros are best illustrated with an example. Suppose you have a table, the
field delimiter being ':'. An example is shown below:
</p>

<pre>
        Name    Age     Fav. Animal
        Bob   : 24   :  Duck
        Harry : 18   :  Tiger
        John  : 36   :  Dog
        ...   : ..   :  ....
</pre>

<p>
Suppose the list is very long consisting of 50 or so names. Your job is to extract everybody's
favourite animal and put them in a list. 
</p>

<p>
Of course you could use sed, but you could do it using macros with ease as well. 
To do so you would do the following:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put your cursor on Bob, and hit <em>q</em> followed by a register letter say <em>a</em> (for animal)
  </li>
  <li>Type <em>2f:w</em> which should take you to the second cursor, and then to the start of the 
   next word, "Duck".
  </li>
  <li>Yank the word with a <em>yaw</em>. 
  </li>
  <li>We want to move to the end of file, and paste this. However, we should mark our
   position before we leave. Mark it in some register, say <em>f</em>, with <em>mf</em>.
  </li>
  <li>Goto end of file with <em>0G</em>. 
  </li>
  <li>Put in a new line with <em>o</em> and come back to normal mode with <em>&lt;Esc&gt;</em>
  </li>
  <li>paste with <em>p</em>
  </li>
  <li>Go back to the original cursor position with <em>`f</em>
  </li>
  <li>Finally to make the macro repeatable put the cursor at the start of
   the next line, with <em>j0</em> . Exit the macro mode by hitting <em>q</em>.
   </li>
</ol>

<p>
If you now type <em>:regs</em> you will see the following in register <em>a</em>:
</p>

<pre>
        2f:wyawmf0G0^[`fj0
</pre>

<p>(<em>&lt;Esc&gt;</em> has been replaced by <em>^[</em>.)
</p>

<p>
Now to run this macro simply put your cursor on Bob, and do <em>@a</em>. It should perform the
macro and leave you at the beginning of Harry. You can repeat it once again with <em>@@</em> or
simply with a full stop, <em>.</em> (repeat last command). To repeat it several times you could
say 50@@, which would repeat it 50 times.
</p>

<p>
If you found this macro very useful, you could copy it into your .vimrc, replace <em>^[</em> with
<em>&lt;Esc&gt;</em> and map it to a keystroke. As an example, the above macro would transform to 
</p>

<pre>
	" Collect all the animals at the end of the file
	nmap \fa 2f:wyawmf0G0&lt;Esc&gt;`fj0
</pre>

<p>
Macros are terribly underused. Learn to use them effectively.
</p>

<h3>Completion</h3>

<p>
Vim now supports omni-completion as well as intelligent buffer completion.
The following commands should sum this up:
</p>

<pre>
        Ctrl-n - complete (a small popup should appear. You can browse this with
              Ctrl-n and Ctrl-p. Simply continue typing when done.

        Ctrl-x f - complete this filename.

        Ctrl-x i - complete from included files.
</pre>

<h3>SpellCheck</h3>

<p>
With Vim 7.0, Vim now supports built-in spellchecking. To enable it simply
type
</p>

<pre>
        :set spell 
</pre>

<p>
and to disable 
</p>

<pre>
        :set nospell
</pre>

<p>
You can navigate spelling errors by using <em>]s</em> and <em>[s</em> . You can correct them by 
hitting <em>z=</em> . This will pop up a list of possibilities that you can choose from.
</p>

<h3>Common Settings</h3>

<p>
This section simply describes a list of common settings that people might find useful. You can
see <a href="misc/srinivasan/vimrc.txt">my .vimrc</a> to look at what I use.
</p>

<p>
Options are set to true using <em>:set option</em> , unset (set option to
false) using <em>:set nooption</em> and set to other values using <em>:set
option=value</em>. You can invert an true/false option by using <em>:set
invoption</em>. 
</p>

<p>
Options often have shorter names that enable you to type them faster. An
example would be 'ft' for filetype, enabling you to do <em>:set
ft=value</em> instead of the longer <em>:set filteype=value</em>
</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<pre>
        autoindent  -   automatically indents your cursor on the new line, depending on where 
                        this line started.
        smartindent -   is smarter than autoindent. Knows to go back a tab, if you have closed
                        a block using '{' or goes front a tab if you have opened one with '{'.
                        This is also language specific, and knows the block delimiters for several 
                        languages.
        hlsearch    -   sets highlight of search on or off.
        incsearch   -   sets incremental search on or off. Incremental search is the name 
                        programmers give to "find as you type" search. This is VERY useful.
        expandtab   -   fill tabs with spaces when a tab is hit. The number of spaces depends on 
                        the tabstop option.
        showmatch   -   show matching (), {}, [] when typing. Very useful for programmers.
        ft=VALUE    -   set filetype = VALUE
</pre>

<p>
As an example you could do
</p>

<pre>
        :set hlsearch           switches hlsearch on
        :set nohlsearch         switches hlsearch to off
        :set invhlsearch        inverts hlsearch (which was previously off due to the last
                                command) to on.
</pre>

<p>
To change file types from 'txt' to 'html' you would do
</p>

<pre>
        :set ft=html
</pre>
        
<p>
and if you still find no syntax highlighting,
</p>

<pre>
        :enable syntax
        # or
        :syntax on
</pre>
        
<p>
For help on an option, do <em>:help option</em>
</p>

<p>
There is a very useful option that I often use. I am one of those compulsive <em>&lt;Esc&gt;</em> hitters.
If I am decide to change my command, or abort my command, or simply feel itchy I hit the &lt;Esc&gt;
button (often more than once). Vim deals with it graciously, and simply beeps, which does not
bother me at all. However, in a work situation like the office or the lab, people sitting near
you may get irritated with the beep(s). You can tell vim to switch off the sound alert, and
switch on a visual one with
</p>

<pre>
        :set visualbell
</pre>

<p>
Try hitting two <em>&lt;Esc&gt;</em>'s in a row now. The screen should just flash.
</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Commands</h3>
<p>
This section lists a few miscellaneous commands that would not fit anywhere else in this document.
        
</p>

<pre>
        Shift+j (or J) - This will bring up the next line and join it to the end of the current one.
		                 Learn to use this well. It is what people in other editors would perform as 
                         &lt;End&gt;&lt;Del&gt; . A mnemonic for Join the previous line with current line.

        Shift+k (or K) - Displays the man page for word under cursor

        ~              - Swap Case of character under cursor, and move to the next character.

        .              - repeat the last command, whatever it is. (The command could be the insertion of a
                         sentence or even a macro). What most editors would call 'repeat'.
</pre>

<p>
Vim can also increment and decrement numbers for you. This is extremely
useful in writing larger more generic macros. As usual, numbers prefixed
with a '0' are considered octal; numbers prefixed with a '0x' are
considered hexadecimal. Numbers not beginning with a zero, are decimal.
</p>

<pre>
        Control+A      - Increments the number under the cursor
        Control+X      - Decrements the number under the cursor
</pre>

<h3>Useful Plugins</h3>
<p>
Vim, much like Emacs is an extensible editor. There are thousands of plugins for vim, that make one's
life a lot easier. Purely for completeness, I list some of the more popular plugins here
</p>

<pre>
        taglist explorer        opens a wonderful little function list by your side,
                                just like an IDE

        matchit                 enables matching of regular expressions using %

        gpg                     encrypts your data with with your private key. Performs
                                decryption as well. 

        calendar                displays a calendar in your vim window, to which you can
                                add notes, et al, ala org-mode

        minibufexplorer         displays all open buffers and tabs on a horizontal list at
                                the top/bottom of your screen.

        tetris                  yes, with rotating game play and high scores!
</pre>
  
<p>
Besides all this, there are a lot of programming suites available for the more popular languages
like C/C++, LaTeX, Java, Python, Ruby, etc...
</p>

<p>
There are currently more than 2200 plugins available at <a
href="http://vim.org">http://vim.org</a>, some of which are bound to make
your life easier or a little more fun. Taking advantage of such a wealth of
hard work and talent is more than just good fun; it makes a lot of sense.
</p>

<h2><a>Final Tips</a></h2>
<p>
When all said and done, it is up to you to become proficient in using vim.
There is no harm in thinking out what is the best way to do something when
you do it for the first time. It will save a lot of time in the future. At
one point of time, all efficient vim users thought about the commands they
were typing. Reflect on it, before it becomes a habit. It might be slow
initially, but the effects you reap later on will be very high.
</p>

<p>
If you are the kind who keeps forgetting which mode insert/normal/visual
mode you are in, remember, as mentioned before that vim is meant to be kept
in the normal mode. Words are to be inserted in short bursts. As soon as
you finish typing/selecting, come back to normal mode, by hitting
<em>&lt;Esc&gt;</em>.
</p>

<p>
Also, remember that vim commands can be repeated by prefixing numbers to
the commands. Like <em>7j</em> or <em>3w</em>, etc.. This is probably the
most underused vim powertool. Write macros that can be repeated too.
</p>

<p>
Finally, remember to customise your .vimrc with useful functions, macros,
abbreviations, and settings.  Before hurriedly writing your own plugin,
search vim.org. There are lots of plugins that can help improve daily
productivity. And yes, do remember that vim's <em>:help</em> is a wonderful
piece of documentation.
</p>

<p>
Good Luck Vimming!
