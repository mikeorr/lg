Just read it - it <em>is</em> awesome. I wish it had some legal validity... I'd
adopt it for all my work in a minute. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Could we persuade OSI  to take a look at this?
Too frivolous for their taste, I fear...

Confused yet?

The problem is more in the nature of "will fall apart with even the
slightest scrutiny". Y'know how the first X pages of any contract are
all about rigid definitions, all "Blatzer, Scrug, Ffyfins, Glagger, and
Dodd Uniform Properties Incorporated, Diversified, and Agglutinatively
Homogenized, hereuntothereforeundercrotchwise known as 'Company'..."?
Right. "Poorly defined or undefined terms", etc. - any judge would
immediately throw it out. Approach the bench with anything resembling a
sense of humor? Heaven forfend. Thirty days in the clink at the very
least for impugning the dignity of the court with your frivolous ways - 
and we'll make sure that Big Bubba is your cellmate. <strong>He'll</strong> appreciate
his new girlfriend having a sense of humor...

You're an Eddie Izzard fan too? Right on. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)"> "Cake... or death?" is a
standard Okopnik household in-joke. Between Eddie and Margaret Cho,
we're well up on our dark and spiky comedy ration. <img src="../gx/smile.png" alt=":)">

Oh, yes.Few years back I watched "Definite Article" on BBC Prime, I'm hooked ever since.
Margaret Cho is a nice discovery, there is a lack of female stand-up comedy, I don't know why.
 "THIS IS NOT...
THE SALAD OF MY? PEOPLE!"
My favorites are also Jimmy Carr (the way he tortures his audience is incredible) and 
Michael McIntyre, who is just funny as hell.
