Ok tough guys,
I have written down more one-liners and cool tricks
from the Linux Gazette pages than from anywhere else.
<P>
And I finally have a good question:
In both Window$ and O$/2 I had apps that would treat
ftp sites as folders (directories).  It worked real
well with keeping data in sync off-site.  Is there a
tool that will allow an FTP site to be mounted under
Linux?  It seems fairly useful to me, but freshmeat
and other resources turned up nada.  
<P>
I am working on a cool 1 disk Linux distro that has
pilot backup features and other remote file access
ideas that could really benefit from this.

<P>
I've installed Linux Red Hat 5.2 on my friend's computer, and now for
some extremely odd reason the Red Hat machine and the NT Server 4.0
that's on his other machine can't see each other over the network. At
all. They don't even respond to each other's ARP requests.
<P>
The link is alive (judging from the lights on his switching hub), and
the machines can see each other fine when he runs Windows 95 on the
machine where I've installed Red Hat. TCP/IP is installed and configured
correctly on both machines. The Red Hat machine has a 10 Mbps 3COM card,
the NT machine a 100 Mbps 3COM, and the lights on the hub say that it's
using those speeds on the interfaces that the machines are on,
regardless of whether the one machine is running Linux or Windows 95.

<P>
I experienced a dirty shutdown when some software went bezerk and
repeatly copied files from a cdrom until a HD partition filled. Running
fsck seems to have cleaned up most things, but one permanent result was
that x client fonts (the title bar and menus of windows) are a large
Helvetica regular that causes difficulty.
<P>
I run Red Hat 5.2. I found no .fvwm2rc on that system. So I copied the
file /etc/X11/fvwm2/system.fvwm2rc as .fvwm2rc into my home directory
and edited the specification for WindowFont and MenuFont. I restarted
Fvwm2, but nothing changed (my system fonts are accessible).
<P>
Is a copy of .fvwm2rc mandatory or only optional if one wants the user
to define x client fonts, etc.?
Should a copy of system.fvwm2rc as .fvwm2rc into my home directory have
provided the user with the ability to customize X client fonts?

I've tried searching the Internet for this and got generally quite confused
about how to do it (and unable to get it to work!)
What I need to know is how to setup a PPP access to my Linux computer
where I give a subnet to the computer dialled in rather than just a
single IP address (i.e. networking two networks together - ISP side)
The target machine dialling in via PPP is actually WindowsNT - get no
problems when it is setup as a single IP address (and the WindowsNT
machine has it's own IP address not in my subnet) but can't seem to
get it right when the NT machine has part of my subnet.
Any help greatly appreciated

Subject: <font color="navy">Re: "Web pages design under Linux" (#39)</font>
<P>
I just browsed to the latest Linux Gazette, and for the life of me I can't
figure out how the article "Web pages design under Linux" got in there.
I'm not a fequent reader of the LG (but a subscriber to LJ almost from the
beginning :-), and I'm pleasantly surprised about the good quality and
high standards of the other contributions in this issue. Given that, how
did this article made it in there? :-)
<P>
If I were new to Linux, but knew something about web design, after reading
this article I would say even DOS must be a better choice of OS for web
design! If I knew Linux, but I'm new to web design, this article would
easily convince me that Linux has next to nothing to offer to get a gentle
start into web design. And if you know both, well, you wonder how many
people who count themselves to the previous two groups get scared off...
<P>
The title has not much at all to do with the article. Giving an overview
is fine, but not mentioning even a fraction of the many great tools that
Linux *does* have for web design, and not even giving *one* useful link to
follow up on and to find a page that *does* have some info that deserves
the name of the title, but instead sports silly things like "A true web
page is made by hand" should be enough reason to not publish such an
article until its reworked.
<P>
An article doesn't have to be long to be right for LG, nor does it have to
cover a subject completely. But an article with *this* title should give
the reader a little kickstart in the right direction, and I just don't see
that happening. 
<P>
Otherwise, keep up the great work, I enjoy the LG! I consider it a very
useful addition to LJ.

All the best,

I have a request. Find some programs equivalent to FrontPage by Microsoft
that can run under Linux and do a second article in the Linux Gazette. I
found your statement that "A true web page is made by hand" to be very
narrow minded and limiting.
<P> 
I learned how to code by hand a long time ago and was never so happy as when
WYSIWYG editors came out. Coding by hand is incredibly slow compared to a
decent program such as Aolpress, FrontPage, Hotdog, Dreamweaver, NetObjects
Fusion, or one of the other drag and drop editors. Today's websites with
Java scripts and dhtml and all the other extras that are taken for granted
would take forever to develop by hand. I agree that hand coding is leaner
and meaner but trade offs have to be made between that and speed, especially
when done commercially and charged by the hour. Also the site management
features offered in a decent websuite are something that a
webmaster/developer desperatly needs on large multi-page sites.

<P>
In Issue 40, there's an e-mail from Michael J. Hammel answering some
complaints someone had about the current state of GUI prepress software
for Linux.  In it, he said that "there aren't any such tools yet
announced for Linux".  That hasn't been true for a couple of months now:
like many other people, he's forgotten that Corel has a full-scale
publishing package: Corel Ventura.
<P>
As everyone's heard now, Corel has promised to port all their apps to
Linux by the beginning of next year.  So far as I recall, this includes
Ventura.
<P>
One other nit: Michael wrote that Windows has an 8-year lead on Linux. 
Actually, it has a 14-year lead: Windows 1.0 was released in 1985, and
their focus has always been on ease of use.  Recall that Windows was
started in late 1983 after some Microsoft folk visited Apple and saw
preproduction versions of the Mac.  
<P>
Although X was started around the same time, Michael is right that the X
world hasn't focused on newbie-user simplicity until very recently. 
Sure, X makes a Unix box easier to use just because it's a GUI, but
until GNOME and KDE came on the scene, X never really hid anything the
way that the Mac and Windows do.

Maybe a detail,
<P>
Many of us have and use Linux, but are still bound by the need to
standardize in the corporate world to the Windows environment.  As a Linux
newbie, I still do not have a high speed modem bought and installed on my
Linux box at home so have no way to get the tar, etc formats, and, of
course, many of us have a higher speed lines at work.  Is there a way to
download the file in a format that can be unzipped, etc. on a Windows
workstation then print out?  Also, a format easily read by Windows machines
would make publicizing the Linux system possible to others now using
Windows.  For example, our local PCC users club(Coastal Areas PC Users
Group, www.caug-pc.org http://www.caug-pc.org) has a web site.  I guess
what I'm saying, is if we only publish Linux documents in formats that Linux
users and/or Linux gurus can use, how do we grow the user base?

Replace the Explorer in the shell= statement of your system.ini file and

Hear, Hear.
<P>
I feel the same way.  One very obvious example is running StarOffice
5.0.  Under KDE, I thought it was really slow and would not have even
considered using it.  However, under just fvwm2 or another standard
window manager, it is quite responsive.  I was ready to throw StarOffice
away until I tried without KDE.

<P>
On Tuesday, April 27th, I stopped by the Ralph Nader/James Love "Appraising Microsoft" site, just to see what was up with their upcoming conference on April 30th. I found the pages outlining their agenda plus speakers.
<P>
At http://www.appraising-microsoft.org/ams2-panels.html, you'll find their Agenda, where the last panel supposedly covers...
<ul>
<li>   Panel Four 3:15 p.m. - 4:45 p.m.
<li>   Non antitrust remedies 
      <ul>
  <li>    Government and private procurement policies
	 <ul>
<li>     Consumer Boycotts
<li>     Linux, xBSD and other free software
<li>     Alternative commercial operating systems, such as
<li>     BeOS, Mac-X OS, Amiga, New Deal
</ul></ul></ul>
<P>
Notice that NewDeal Office, which isn't an operating system, is listed there, while OS/2, DOS, Netware, QNX, etc. are missing. Secondly, the workshops don't actually discuss the other OSs in an detail; so even if those platforms are listed, they still have no representatives at the conference.
<P>
The same applies to Linux. If you check their list of speakers [URL below], you'll see that while the list includes CEOs from Caldera and RedHat, it has no corporate official from other software vendors, nor any independent Linux programmers, resellers, or user groups who could offer their own insights to the public.
<P>
This conference is much like their first one in Nov 1997. After so many of us had protested the first conference's mistakes and had asked for corrections to the A.M. site-- e.g. their handling of operating systems and user groups-- it's hard to just sit back and attribute this 2nd conference as some sort of "mistake" or "oversight" based merely on ignorance.
<P>
James Love isn't merely forgetting about the software and groups we care about. He simply doesn't _respect_ us and doesn't want to include us in his conference.
<P>
As he told me in a telephone conversation, "[not verbatim] "What have these user groups and programmers done? What remedies have these people ever proposed that would convince us they deserve to be included? We need people who have ideas, who know what they're talking about, who can speak...."
<P>
It's time to send him your answers to his questions.
<P>
Steps you can take:
<ol>
<li> Go to the A.M. website, and check out the Speakers [http://www.appraising-microsoft.org/speakers2.html] and Agenda [http://www.appraising-microsoft.org/ams2-panels.html pages.

<li> E-mail a respectful complaint to James Love and Ralph Nader. Politely let them know that their conference should be open and inclusive to all OSs, user groups, developers, resellers etc..
<P>
NOTE! If you yourself belong to a group that should be included, then give Love all the contact info he needs to reach you, so that you may be invited to his next conference. Insist on it. :)

<li> If you can telephone them, consider calling the A.M. contact person, Donna Colvin, at 202-387-8030, where James Love also can be reached.
</ol>

Subject: <font color="navy">Re: Something for very new beginners</font>
<P>
I suggest a portion of your publication be devoted
to really simple answere to very basic questions.
<P> 
I have installed Red Hat Linux in an i486 computer, and
have just picked up bits and pieces of how to connect
to a modem, how to setup ppp configuration using the
command line prompts, and how to start XFree86.
<P>
For old-time experienced Linux users, these must sound like very simple
tasks, but from my ignorant state, they are like unclimbable mountains.

(Well, the way it works is you send your questions to me, I post them in the
Mail Bag and then you get answers by e-mail. Copies of answers sent to me are
posted in the 2 Cent tip section. We get a lot of basic questions so you could
just search issues for keywords. (When the search works again--hopefully next
week.)

Ron Jenkins series Linux Primer is really good for newcomers.
He's done 9 installments now so go back and read the first one.

I hope you'll find answers in our mag. If not
today, then send in your questions. I guarantee you'll get plenty of answers.
