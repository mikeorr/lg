<h1>Keymap and IOCTLs</h1>
<p id="by"><b>By <a href="../authors/anonymous.html">Anonymous</a></b></p>

<p>
In issue #86 of the <em>Linux Gazette</em> there's a nice example of how to
remap keys from a C application:
</p>

<p>
<a href="../issue86/misc/bint/kbe.c.txt">http://linuxgazette.net/issue86/misc/bint/kbe.c.txt</a>
</p>

<p>
The author, the late <a href="../authors/bint.html">Stephen Bint</a>,
was working on an editor for the text console and a library for such
an editor. He didn't like to have the screen "dirtied" when pressing
&lt;PgUp&gt; or &lt;PgDn&gt; while also pressing the &lt;Shift&gt; key.
Indeed, that combination is reserved by default to scroll backward or
forward through console output: the kernel will intervene and do things
before the editor comes to know what keys you have pressed.  </p>

<p>
There is a way around it: redefine the keys temporarily,
restoring them when exiting your application. Of course, if
you can understand the C source for loadkeys and dumpkeys,
you can skip both Stephen's examples and what follows. However,
since I had problems getting even a vague idea of what loadkeys
and dumpkeys do, I decided to write down a few details, to
complement the old <em>LG</em> article referenced above.
</p>

<p>
All of this is relevant only for the GNU/Linux text console.
You can forget about anything this "simple" if you work only under X11.
</p>


<h3>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>
A PC keyboard sends signals to the Linux kernel - more
precisely, to the kernel keyboard driver - telling it that a
certain key has been pressed or released. Normally,
applications let the kernel translate those signals into
strings using the current (screen) character set and the
traditional ASCII encoding, where one character equals one
byte. This used to be the normal approach, until recently.
Nowadays, Unicode is spreading, and you are now likely to
have Unicode for the screen, rather than a character set as in
the old days. The keyboard will then produce Unicode strings, using
the UTF-8 encoding, where one character may need more than
one byte. For the purpose of this article, however, there is no
difference between the two modes; we refer to them both as
translation mode.
</p>

<p>
Direct handling of keyboard signals (raw and semi-raw mode)
by the application is rare.
</p>

<p>
The <em>keymap</em> tells you about the translation the kernel is doing for
you. However, if you want to know what's going on, don't look into the
local keymap: It is not complete, since it includes other files; it is
formatted in an inconvenient way; and your distro may have modified it at
boot time anyway. If you want to know what is really in force, and be able
to read it, issue
</p>

<pre>
    dumpkeys -1 &gt; my_keymap.txt
</pre>

<p>
at the shell prompt and examine (the nicely formatted)
my_keymap.txt. Consider the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li> some keys insert characters: you press &lt;a&gt; and
    you see an 'a' inserted at the cursor.
<li> some keys insert nothing but have some effect:
    you press &lt;left&gt;, the cursor usually moves one space to the left.
<li>   some keys are defined as 'VoidSymbol', no action will be
    taken on them.
<li> some keys are listed but do not seem to exist. Indeed,
    they do not exist, since the Linux keymap also applies to
    keyboards different from the standard PC keyboard you are
    using.
</ul>

<p>
Whatever the keys do, they do it on the basis of an 'action
code' assigned to them. For keymap programming, you must
know these action codes. How do you get them? Issue
</p>

<pre>
    dumpkeys --long-info &gt; actioncodes.txt
</pre>

<p>
at the prompt. You get a list of action codes (left column)
and the key labels for them (right column). Some labels have
synonyms: for instance, the action code for &lt;PgUp&gt; is 0x0118,
but you will not read 'PgUp' next to it; you will see the
label 'Prior'. 
</p>

<p>
Keys like &lt;Left&gt; may not insert anything, but still they have
their effects:
</p>

<ul>
<li>(i)   caused directly by the kernel keyboard driver
<li>(ii)  caused by the application as soon it understands that
      a certain key was pressed.
</ul>

<p>
An example of the first kind is &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;PgUp&gt; where the
console output is scrolled bypassing the current
application.
</p>

<p>
However, more often than not we are concerned about (ii). We
press &lt;Left&gt;, the cursor moves one space to the left, the
application is in control. That implies the application has
been notified that &lt;Left&gt; was pressed. How was it notified?
The keyboard driver knows the action code for the key
&lt;Left&gt;. Although it does not arrange directly for the cursor
movement, the action code arranges for a string to be sent
to the application, so the application can do the right thing.
The string for &lt;Left&gt; is normally "\033[D", where the octal
\033 represents the escape character. It is the application
that decides to move the cursor left upon receiving
"\033[D".
</p>

<p>
In translation mode, the application receives strings of one
character, normally for insertion of that character, or
multi-character strings for functional keys triggering some
action. They are called functional keys because they
are not just the F1 to F12 keys across the upper row of the
keyboard; the &lt;Left&gt; key is also a functional key.
Unfortunately, the keymap utilities say 'function keys' - i.e.,
&lt;Left&gt; is a function key to them. To put it mildly, this is just a
bit confusing.
</p>

<p>
So, beside those few exceptions like &lt;Shift&gt;&lt;PgUp&gt;, the
application is running the show. It receives strings of one
or more characters. The one-character strings are very often
for insertion, but not always so. You surely have been
exposed to old-style user interaction: press 'a' for All or
'c' for Cancel.
</p>

<p>
OK, but where do those strings like "\033[D" for &lt;Left&gt; come
from?
</p>

<p>
For that, look into the local keymap - e.g., the US default
keymap. Almost at the top of the keymap, you will see a line that says
</p>

<pre>
    strings as usual
</pre>

<p>
and that's it. That line defines the strings for F1-F20 and
for Home, End,..., Left, Right, and so on. The strings
originate from DEC hardware, and are still around after DEC
passed away in the mid-90s.
</p>

<p>
Now, why is the keymap defining F1-F20, if the keyboard has
only F1-F12? Because Unix keyboards were not PC keyboards.
The default Linux keymaps (any language) set
</p>

<pre class="code">
    shift keycode 59 = F13      (physical F1 key)
    shift keycode 60 = F14      (physical F2 key)
    ...
    shift keycode 66 = F20      (physical F8 key)
</pre>

<p>
So F13-F20 are not useless; actually they are not enough.
Indeed, you will notice that
</p>

<pre class="code">
    control keycode 59 = F25    (physical F1 key)
    control keycode 60 = F26    (physical F2 key)
    ...
    control keycode 88 = F36    (physical F12 key)
</pre>

<p>
are defined in the US keymap, although no strings are
assigned to F21 and up. These entries mean, e.g., that
&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;F1&gt; will give F13 and &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F1&gt; will give F25. However,
since F25 has an empty string, an empty string is forwarded
to the application, and the application does exactly nothing.
</p>

<p>
Why is it so? Why are those keys set to send an empty
string? Well, Linux 1.0 had a default keymap where
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F1&gt; was same as F1 - and so on. Sometime down the
road, there was a change, for reasons which to me do not seem
worth an investigative effort. Just note that the Russian
Linux keymap has not changed on this point, and that FreeBSD
has low-level operations on &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F1&gt; to &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F10&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Summing up, the keys not used by the kernel for its own
purposes send a standard string to the application, possibly
an empty string. Other keys are just void - i.e., undefined.

<h3>2. Changing the keymap</h3>

<p>
Before we get into some C code, let's mention the obvious: You can modify
your keymap in an editor and then activate it.  You are supposed to be
already in the know, in this respect, otherwise you would not be able to
understand what this article is about.
</p>

<p>
For instance, take those shifted &lt;PgUp&gt; and &lt;PgDn&gt; for
scrolling the console. You edit the keymap to
</p>

<pre class="code">
    shift keycode 104       = Prior
    control alt keycode 104 = Scroll_Backward

    shift keycode 109       = Next
    control alt keycode 109 = Scroll_Forward
</pre>

<p>
save it, load it with loadkeys and the console scrolling
will be done with &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;PgUp&gt;, &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;PgDn&gt; , which
is not in anybody's way.
</p>

<p>
This is, of course, a lot easier to do and to understand
than Stephen's code; however, Stephen gave a nice example of how
to use ioctls, and here is where we resume his efforts. We'll
add a little example, and show how to use a couple of those
ioctls.
</p>

<p>
We want to assign a string to &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; so as to be able
to tell &lt;Enter&gt; from &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; - in the default
keymap, these are the same. Here are all the details required:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    physical key        &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;
    keycode             28
    action code label   F50
    action code         0x013b
    associated string   "\033[M~4"
</pre>

<ol>
<li>Where does the keycode come from? From the keymap.
<li>Where does F50 come from? It's arbitrary. The keymap
understands F1-F255, but only F1-F20 are fully defined with
strings. F25-F36 are there but not fully defined. F50 should
not encroach on anything. Needless to say, it can be
changed.
<li>Where does the action code come from? From the file
'actioncodes.txt' that we generated a couple of paragraphs
upstream.
<li>Where does the associated string come from? It's
arbitrary; you are welcome to replace it with whatever you like.
<li>In a first step, we insert a couple of headers and
definitions in our code (if not already there):

<pre class="code">
    #include &lt;linux/kd.h&gt;
    #include &lt;linux/keyboard.h&gt;
    struct kbentry ke;
    struct kbsentry ks;
</pre>

<p>
In a second step, we instruct the keyboard driver to
associate our string with F50:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    ks.kb_func   = 50;
    ks.kb_string = "\033[M~4";
    ioctl(fileno(stdin), KDSKBSENT, &amp;ks);
    //  if assignment fails, an error will be set
    //  in global variable ERR
</pre>

<p>
This and the kbentry/kbsentry structures are scantily
documented in the manpage console_ioctl, written in 1995 and
never updated. Same for KDSKBSENT, which can be memorized as
'Keyboard Driver Set KeyBoard String ENTry'.
</p>

<li>
Finally, we bind F50 to &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;:

<pre class="code">
    ke.kb_table = 4;
    ke.kb_index = 28;
    ke.kb_value = 0x013b;
</pre>

<p>
The kb_table is determined by the modifier used. We are
pressing two keys, &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Enter&gt;, so we are using
modifier &lt;Ctrl&gt; which has number 4 in the keymap.
</p>

<p>
The kb_index is the keycode, the kb_value is the action
code, both already explicitly stated above.
</p>

<p>
We use yet another ioctl call:
</p>

<pre class="code">
    ioctl(fd,KDSKBENT,&amp;ke);
    // if assignment fails, an error will be set
    // in global variable ERR
</pre>

<p>
and we are done - just pay attention when typing KDSKBSENT
vs. KDSKBENT. F50 is now associated with the string of our
choice. This string is sent to the application when
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt; is pressed.
</p>
</ol>

<h3>3. Moral</h3>

<p>
Essentially, what we have done is to allow for
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;Enter&gt;
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;m&gt;
    &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;
</pre>

<p>
to be all distinct. Think about it: The first two send
the same string, namely "^M", character 13. They can be told
apart by checking the modifier, since the first one is produced
with 1 key, while the second one needs 2 keys.
</p>

<p>
The third entry, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Enter&gt;, can not, by default, be
distinguished from &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;m&gt;, since both produce "^M", and
both signal that &lt;Ctrl&gt; was pressed. (You would have to move
to raw or semi-raw mode to find out - not recommended.) With
our little modification, we now have all our ducks in a row. Also,
the trick can be applied elsewhere, for instance, to &lt;Tab&gt;,
&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;.
</p>

<p>
Note that applications other than the one you are working
on may rely on the keymap defaults, and get confused by your
ioctls intervention. A well-behaved application should thus
reverse the changes made. However, if the application
crashes for whatever reasons, the reversing code will not
be executed, and the keyboard will not be reset.
</p>

<p>
In other words: when you exit this application, just reload
the default keymap. For that, the command will be
</p>

<pre>
    loadkeys us
</pre>

<p>
or 'uk' or 'fr' or 'ge', or whatever you are using.
