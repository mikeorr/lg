	>http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Biculturalism.html</A>
Review of <em>  The Art of Unix Programming  </em> by Eric Raymond (review by Joe
Spolsky)
Entire book online at <A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/index.html"
	>http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/index.html</A>
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
The article talks mostly about the cultural differences between Unix and
Windows; it says Raymond gets this wrong because he doesn't understand
Windows culture, but still recommends the book for its general insights.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
'I have heard economists claim that Silicon Valley could never be
recreated in, say, France, because the French culture puts such a high
penalty on failure that entrepreneurs are not willing to risk it. Maybe
the same thing is true of Linux: it may never be a desktop operating
system because the culture values things which prevent it. OS X is the
proof: Apple finally created Unix for Aunt Marge, but only because the
engineers and managers at Apple were firmly of the end-user culture (which
I've been imperialistically calling "the Windows Culture" even though
historically it originated at Apple). They rejected the Unix culture's
fundamental norm of programmer-centricity. They even renamed core
directories -- heretical! -- to use common English words like
"applications" and "library" instead of "bin" and "lib."'
</STRONG></P>
<blockQuote>

Yeah, they're not people who senselessly put up with endless churn and
mind-numbing complexity at the behest of a monopolist vendor; they're
just plain folks working to help Aunt Marge in contrast to those
luftmenschen Unix (especially Linux) people who aspire to actually be in
<em> charge  </em> of their computing.  Joel and Co. are so tragically
misunderstood I'm getting all misty-eyed, just thinking about it.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Yeah, Aunt Marge will never be able to figure out her TiVo or use
Google, right, Joel?
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
You'll have to wade through a large amount of tedious and irrelevant
argumentum ad hominem, probably included as filler because Spolsky has
otherwise so little to say -- and, of course, none of even that residuum
about (in contrast to Raymond's work) the key issue of where control
resides, as Spolsky's crowd gave that up long ago without much thought.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
I don't really mind the four minutes I wasted on that review, but in an
ideal world I'd really rather have them back.

Um... where? I see a lot of general arguments against the Unix
approach, but not against Raymond personally. The closest to an ad
hominem argument I saw was this:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
"Whenever he opens his mouth about Windows he tends to show that his
knowledge of Windows programming comes mostly from reading newspapers,
not from actual Windows programming. That's OK; he's not a Windows
programmer; we'll forgive that."
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
and, uh... that's true from what I remember of the text in question.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Jimmy] 
Aha. Looked at the section of the text:
<A HREF="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch03s02.html#nt_contrast"
	>http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch03s02.html#nt_contrast</A>
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"NT has file attributes in some of its file system types. They are
used in a restricted way, to implement access-control lists on some
file systems, and don't affect development style very much."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Umm.... that's kinda true, for given values of 'true'.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
NT doesn't use attributes in the POSIX sense, it uses separate file
streams. Each file on NTFS is more like its own directory, and
arbitrary streams can be added to each file without restriction
(xattrs on Linux are restricted to 64k, BTW). Heck, they could even
add automatic versioning and <EM>really</EM> show NT's VMS roots if they
wanted.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"Most programs cannot be scripted at all. Programs rely on complex,
fragile remote procedure call (RPC) methods to communicate with each
other, a rich source of bugs."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Again, true for a given value of true.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Most programs can't be scripted in the Unix way - by parsing the
output - but can be scripted using OLE Automation. This is where that
RPC confusion comes in: it's actually a C++ vtable on the local
machine, with an extra part that describes the type information for
each function (like Java's reflection API), which removes the need to
write a wrapper for each programming language as you have to do in
Unix land. Windows comes with a DCE RPC implementation, and will
automatically marshal OLE interfaces across RPC for free if you decide
to call a remote machine, but otherwise there is no overhead for
compiled languages, and a little for interpreted.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If the amount of times Unix has been cloned is a testament to how good
an idea it was, bear in mind that COM has been cloned several times
(OOo's UNO, Mozilla's XPCOM, <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</A>'s Bonobo, <A HREF="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</A>'s (now discarded)
original component system, etc.)

1.  Otherwise irrelevant swipe about "idiotarianism", a term
Raymond had briefly attempted to popularise in the context of
his politics blog.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
2.  Reference to "the frequently controversial Eric S. Raymond".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Note:  Passive-aggressives in the technical community have been
lately falling back on the term "controversial" to denote
someone whom you wish to suggest is somehow unsuitable and
doubtful without actually presenting any honest argument as
to why.  I caught a business-school professor from San Jose
State University recently trying to pull that bit of gutter
rhetoric on the OSI license-discuss mailing list against
outgoing OSI general counsel Lawrence Rosen.  It was
a disreputable bit of trickery there, and it is here, too.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
3.  The juvenile, thrown-in inclusion of a hyperlink to Raymond's 1999
"Surprised by Wealth" slightly inarticulate burblings about
(temporarily, as it turns out) having paper-only winnings in
the stock market from the VA Linux Systems IPO.  Even the
<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</A> trolls eventually got tired of cruelly waving the
"Gee, you thought you were going to get rich, huh?" line at
Raymond, but Spolsky hasn't.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
All of that gratuitous personal nastiness formed part of what Spolsky
<em> lead with  </em> in his initial paragraphs.  You might not have noticed it,
but I did -- and it both distracted from the distinctly limited merits
of his review's <em>  real  </em> content and sufficed to convince me that the
man's a raving jerk.

	> [Kapil] 
The analogy Japan&lt;-&gt;
America = Windows/Mac&lt;-&gt;
Unix is flawed.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
There <EM>are</EM> cultural differences between the users for whom the
Mac/Windows/Gnome/KDE folks design interfaces and the users for whom
the Unix interface is designed.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, it is possible and indeed imperative(*) for users of the first
kind (whom Spolsky calls non-programmers) to make the transition (at
their own pace) to the users of the second kind (programmers). (**)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The difference between Gnome/KDE and Windows is that in the latter
case the interface puts up barriers to this transition.(***)
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(*) But there is no such imperative for people from one part of the
world to adapt/adopt food habits from another part of the world.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(**) The logic of the world as it currently works is that those who do
not (slowly but) steadily improve their understanding/usage of the tools
they use will soon become incapable.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
(***) I cannot decide exactly where to put Mac OS X.

	> [Jimmy] 
I have to admit here that I didn't bother following the links from
that paragraph, and going by the text, I thought it was a favourable
review:
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
"The frequently controversial Eric S. Raymond has just written a long
book about Unix programming called The Art of UNIX Programming
exploring his own culture in great detail."
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
[snip cultural differences....]
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
"on the whole, the book is so full of incredibly interesting insight
into so many aspects of programming that I'm willing to hold my nose
during the rare smelly ideological rants because there's so much to
learn about universal ideals from the rest of the book. Indeed I would
recommend this book to developers of any culture in any platform with
any goals, because so many of the values which it trumpets are
universal."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Aside from your third point, though, I think you're reading a bit too
much into it: the guy is writing for an audience who have either not
heard of Raymond, or who would most likely have an unfavourable
impression that he's referring to -- "Don't be put off the book
because of its author".
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/bbub.gif" ALT="(!)"
	HEIGHT="28" WIDTH="50" BORDER="0"
	> [Rick] 
That's a generous interpretation, and it speaks well for you, but not
for Spolsky.  
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";-&gt;" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle">
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
<em> All  </em> of those three points, however, have been popular standbys of a
certain Slashdot-type ad hominem squad that's been showing up --
invariably relying on anonymous postings -- in pretty much any
discussion of Raymond, his writings, or his software or the last seven
or eight years:  Spolsky gives every appearance of having cribbed his
"amusing", take-the-subject-down-a-peg-or-two references directly from
the gossipers.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Those gossipers had a field day with Raymond for promoting the
"idiotarian" concept on his politics blog, and then more so when he made
the mistake of listing that in the Jargon File (which entry he later
removed, upon reflection).  And there's no conceivable reason to cite
that in a book review, other than to serve as a personal swipe.

While we're on the topic, I went by Wikipedia's article
(<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond"
	>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond</A>) after I sent that last
mail, my PC crashed, I went back, and... the section titled
'Criticism' had changed to 'Trivia' -- it seems there has been a very

Attacks of ESR aside, one slightly off-color aspect I noticed in the
review was a cited quote from an exec at <A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</A>, taken from Nov 2003,
which stated that Linux was not yet ready to be considered as being on
equal footing with that other OS in the regard of ease of install and
use by non-tech savvy types.
</blockQuote>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<blockQuote>
So here we are, 20 years after Unix developers started trying to
paint a good user interface on their systems, and we're still at
the point where the CEO of the biggest Linux vendor is telling
people that home users should just use Windows.
</blockQuote><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<blockQuote>
I followed his link to the source of the quote, and saw that it was
published in Nov 2003, and that the article went on to say:
</blockQuote>

<TABLE WIDTH="95%" BORDER="1" BGCOLOR="#FFFFCC"><TR><TD>
<p align="center">...............</p>
<blockQuote><BLOCKQuote>
Szulik gave an example of his 90-year-old father going to a
local retailer in order to purchase a computer with Linux: "We
know painfully well what happens. He will try to get it
installed and either doesn't have a positive experience or
puts a lot of pressure on your support systems," he said.
</BLOCKQuote></blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
However, Szulik expects Linux to be ready in a couple of years
after it has had time to mature.
</blockQuote><p align="center">...............</p>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<blockQuote>
I don't mean to assert that the more ubiquitous platform doesn't maintain
the advantage for wide OEM support, but depending on the apps that the
user is going to run, the gap has been narrowing steadily over time, and
for an ever increasing number of home users, Linux makes a very adequate
replacement for MSW.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
The citation of that quote also seems a bit misleading, in that it's quite
easy to assume that it was more contemporaneous, rather than nearly two
years old, and in the context of technological advances, nearly two years
is a long time.

<p><strong>From Jason Creighton 
</strong></p> 
<p></strong></p>
<P><STRONG>
Hey,
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
I was checking my mail, and noticed something interesting in fetchmail's
output. Here's the relevant bit:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>fetchmail: POP3&lt; +OK Gpop 72pf4507421rna ready.
fetchmail: POP3&gt; CAPA
fetchmail: POP3&lt; +OK Capability list follows
fetchmail: POP3&lt; USER
fetchmail: POP3&lt; RESP-CODES
fetchmail: POP3&lt; EXPIRE 0
fetchmail: POP3&lt; LOGIN-DELAY 300
fetchmail: POP3&lt; X-GOOGLE-VERHOEVEN
fetchmail: POP3&lt; .
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
I say X-GOOGLE-VERHOEVEN and thought "what the heck is that?". I googled
(Admittedly not a very good way to find something if this a huge
conspiracy. &lt;grin&gt
<IMG SRC="../gx/dennis/smily.gif" ALT=";)" 
		height="24" width="20" align="middle"> for it on the web and on Google groups, but that
only turned up mailing list archive posts where people were posting the
output of fetchmail -v in an effort to get their mail working.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
My next step was to see if the extension introducted any obviously named
commands:
</STRONG></P>

<pre><strong>[jason@jpc ~]$ socat - OPENSSL:pop.gmail.com:995,verify=false
+OK Gpop 71pf3749931rnc ready.
X-GOOGLE-VERHOEVEN
-ERR bad command
[jason@jpc ~]$
</strong></pre>
<P><STRONG>
I tried several other permutations: X-GOOGLE, GOOGLE, GOOGLE-VERHOEVEN.
Each one returned the same error code.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
So I wonder: What is this thing? Is it just some tag saying "Yes, this
is Google's mail service"?

FYI:

<pre><strong>Average speed for non-planing hulls = sqrt(waterline_length)

<P><STRONG>
HINT: Sailboats do not have afterburners, ramscoops, or braking jets.
Reentry speeds are whatever the crane operator feels is safe - i.e.,
somewhere around 1 ft./minute (no heat-resistant tiles required.) Andy
Green and Thrust SSC have nothing to fear from wind-driven machines, and
Chuck Yeager in his X-1 never got to experience being outrun and
outmaneuvered by a schooner or a yawl.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
We do, however, make trans-oceanic passages - something that 99% of
powerboaters will never be able to do aboard their boat - and burn zero
to minimal fuel in the process. We also don't have to rely on
bad-tempered machinery that could leave us stranded at any second.
There's also the fact that wind is free... and with the cost of gas
nowadays, that speaks to a lot of people.

That it requires goat sacrifice is one thing, that it requires "some

possibly necessary for certain 'net connections through BT (one
presumes). That you KNOW that there's more than one type of goat
sacrifice has me slightly concerned.

In the hypothetical edge case of having stone-hard evidence, ready to
post and likely to be understood, it is <em>  still  </em> usually much more
damning to cite the evidence <em>  without  </em> comment, and let listeners reach
obvious conclusions on their own.  Why?  Because of an odd rhetorical
effect.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If I tell you "X is an irredeemable jerk, and I'm going to prove it to you",
you will tend to unconsciously set your mind to resist the sales pitch
and dream up any possible reasons why you might remain unpersuaded.
It's human nature; if we're pushed, we lean the other way, out of habit.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
By contrast, if I just start talking in a matter-of-fact fashion without
apparent axe-grinding about various uncontested facts about X's doings,
and you're moved to comment "What a wanker!", you'll tend to hold that
conviction pretty firmly because (or so you think) you arrived at it on
your own.  In fact, you might dig in and start trying to convince me
*I'm* being too kind.
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
So, next time you see me being nice about someone, or even protesting
other people's too-hasty condemnation of him, please remember that
generosity of spirit might have nothing to do with it:  It might be a

Naive comparison is a real problem, and even things that seem to be
"apples to apples" -- say, a comparison between the vendor-announced
vulnerability counts of Microsoft Windows XP SP1 vs. Redhat Linux 9 --
fall apart the moment you compare what's in the box for both. XPSP1
ships with no databases, while Redhat ships with at least MySQL and
PostgreSQL. Should Redhat be penalized for warning customers of
potential problems that might be experienced on their platform,
despite the fact that they didn't even write the software to begin
with? When Oracle on XP has a vulnerability, Microsoft does not need
to put out an advisory, instead Oracle does. Should Microsoft be
referred to as a more secure platform because standard disclosure
policies do not extend to announcing problems in  software acquired
entirely from a third party? Would Redhat suddenly become more secure
if you had to download MySQL and PostgreSQL from their respective
authors, with the requisite advisories coming from those authors and
thus not counting from Redhat itself?
</P>
<p>
Bad metrics encourage bad decisions. Those that compare naively
encourage naive security. It's 2005; it's a little late for that.

Don't Buy Harry Potter Books

<P><STRONG>
Canadians have been ordered not to read books that were sold to them
"by mistake" . Read that article, then don't buy any Harry Potter
books. Everyone who participated in requesting, issuing, enforcing, or
trying to excuse this injunction is the enemy of human rights in
Canada, and they all deserve to pay for their part in it. Not buying
these books will at least make the publisher pay.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Unlike the publisher, who demands that people not read these books, I
simply call on people not to buy them. If you wish to read them, wait,
and you will meet someone who did get a copy. Borrow that copy--don't
buy one. Even better, read something else--there are plenty of other
books just as good, or (dare one suggest) even better.
</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>
Making Canada respect human rights will be hard, but a good first step
is to identify the officials and legislators who do not support them.
The article quotes a lawyer as saying, "There is no human right to
read." Any official, judge, or legislator who is not outraged by this
position does not deserve to be in office.

I would support the idea of a right to sufficient education to be able to
read. I would also support the idea that people have a right to enjoy a book
that they have purchased legally and in good faith, but a right to read any
book or document you want, regardless of whether it not it's published or
confidential is another matter. What would a "right to read" cover and in
what circumstances, I would like to know?

If the injunction really orders them not to read the books they have
purchased, that strikes me as wrong, but hey, we all know the law is an ass,
even in Canada. If I'd bought a book and got an injunction like this, I'd
still read it, I just wouldn't tell them

...and if we extend that line of reasoning just a bit further, it brings
us to (what I think is) RMS' original point. How much of a right do we
grant to our governments to declare arbitrary actions illegal, no matter
how trivial or harmless?

The cynic in me says that governments <EM>love</EM> having their citizens buy
into a belief that they (the citizens) are guilty of <em>  something;  </em> people
with something to hide are likely to keep their heads down and be good
little sheep lest they be noticed and shorn. As the saying in Russia
went, "nobody ever asks 'why' when the KGB takes them away." The KGB, of
course, had a matching expression: "if we have the man, we'll <EM>make</EM> the
case."
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
If the government is allowed to control trivial aspects of people's
lives, then they <em>  will  </em> do so. Not in all cases, but... oh, the
"opportunities" that arise. Perhaps this case is not as black-and-white
as it could be, but I surely do see it as a very steep and well-greased
slippery slope - with its entry point just under a hidden trap door.

... which comes back to my original point, that there is also a slippery
slope <TT>/</TT> trap door on the other side.  In order to get a diverse
coalition of people (the whole world) to agree to and enforce something,
it has to be narrowly focused and not arbitraily "reinterpreted".  It
has long been recognized internationally that people have a right to not
be imprisoned/tortured/killed for their ethnicity, religion, or
participating in political protests.  That's what's normally considered
"human rights", and it's why China is under so much scrutiny.  Canada
and the EU have more inclusive definitions of basic rights, but those
apply only in those countries and cannot be summarily exported to the
rest of the world as "human rights".  China's censorship of the Internet
is deplorable but is not (yet) a "human rights violation".

We make presidential candidates go through a lengthy and highly
embarrassing process that a person with even the tiniest shred of
dignity would never get involved in. It's analogous to the ice-breaking
party game "Twister," wherein somebody spins a pointer, and the players
have to put their hands and feet on whatever colored circles it points
to, thus winding up in humiliating positions. And the people who want
to be president have to play. If the spinning pointer of political
necessity points to SUCK UP TO UNIONS, they have to put their left hands
over on that circle; if the spinner points to SUCK UP TO RELIGIOUS NUTS,
they have to put their right feet in that circle; and so on, month
after month, with candidates dropping out one by one as the required
contortions become too difficult, until finally there's only one
candidate left--some sweaty, exhausted, dignity-free yutz in a
grotesquely unnatural pose, with his tie askew and his shirt untucked

I would too, if somebody had said what you're implying I've said. The UN
was very useful at the time of its creation - despite Russia managing to
wangle two seats instead of the one they should have had - but these
days, it's a debating society with damn near no force or effect. I've
known several people - Canadians who had been with their peacekeeping
force - and the strong impression that I got from them was that of
despondency, of rolling that same useless rock up that same useless
mountain, only to have it roll back down again.
</blockQuote>

At this point, the Big Guys - US and Russia, and to some lesser degree
everyone else - has found their own ways to circumvent or bypass (and in
case of serious disagreement, simply ignore) the UN.  My contention is
that it is no longer useful as a vehicle for maintaining peace or a
round table for mediation/negotiation - all of that now goes on at
high-level conferences, which were rarer and more difficult to arrange
in the days when the UN was created.

I think you're giving the UN <em>  far  </em> too much credit. For one thing, the
projections for WWIII are pretty horrific - at least the ones that we
had when I was in Military Intelligence - and they're not likely to have
improved (&lt;black_humor&gt;except in the kill ratios&lt;/black_humor&gt;.) Nuclear
deterrent would be the number one cause, in my mind - not in the number
of people that are likely to die (why would the politicians care? They
never did before), but in the fact that the high-level decision makers -
despite their bunkers, etc. - are much more likely to, or are far less
likely to survive the aftermath.

I think that the UN did what they could. The overriding issue is that
they could do nothing effective, except make their statement for the
world to hear - something that is done just as effectively by a protest
march in DC. That's not saying a lot for the UN.

Just to add a personal viewpoint here: I find it sad that this is the

US and China, for example, have many mutually incompatible goals,
long-term plans, and cultural imperatives. Expecting China to agree with
the US on human rights is a waste of time - particularly since China is
strong enough to not worry about the US in military terms. The human
rights issue between the two is, therefore, at a standstill - but
Walmart still buys 80%+ of what they sell in China.

The slippery slope is that the more things you pack into this
definition, the less willing a lot of people will be to accept the whole
thing.  For instance, the US administration is reinterpreting free trade
and property rights to include perpetual copyrights, anti-circumvention
provisions, and software patents.

Now, one could make a case that these
<EM>should</EM> be property rights and included, but instead the administration
is bypassing the debate and arguing these <EM>are</EM> self-evidently property
rights.  Not surprisingly, there is much resistance in other countries,
fears about whether free trade is a synonym for US corporate hegemony,
and wonderings about why countries should harm their own vitality to
benefit foreign patents.  Likewise, there is much resistance in the US
to the "right" to living quarters, health care, welfare etc -- this is
seen as the foot in the door for socialism, 90% taxation, and burnt work
ethic.   (Didn't you say something about the KGB?)   So, do you want to
support basic human rights, or do you want to throw other things in and
weaken support for the basic rights?

Stallman has made a good case over the years that the right to read
anything is fundamental.  Obviously, not being able to study holy texts
would significantly impact people's practice of religion.  So would not
having access to news or commentary.  And fiction books often express a
political view or framework, sometimes more valuable than the author
realizes.  So it's impossible to censor non-essential texts while
excepting essential, because inevitably you will misclassify an
essential text.

That's not the grounds on which I find the court's decision to be less
than intelligent. Trying to enforce something that is fundamentally
unenforceable - arrogating to themselves the right to decide that you
should voluntarily surrender the value of that for which you have paid -
those are the things which set off all sorts of alarms for me. With
regard to the adequate information issue, I agree with you - I don't

It does seem quite an overreaction.  Judges in (to my knowledge) almost

Unlike Richard, I decline to pass judgement on our esteemed Canadian

coverage of the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karla_Homolka">Karla

I happened to be in Alberta recently when Homolka was released from a

In my teens (and I'm 2 weeks away from my 26th birthday, BTW -- we're
only talking about one decade) Ireland had a very heavy-handed
Censor's office, which was heavily under the influence of the Church.
Anything vaguely pornographic or 'heretical' was illegal[1].
</blockQuote>
<blockQuote>
Part of the downfall of this was technology (satellite TV was becoming
cheaper[2] and put TV out of the censor's hands), another part was
that they went too far -- they banned a newspaper (one of the British
tabloids, "The Daily Sport". In fairness, it did have at least one
picture of a topless women on every other page, but it also had the
best sports coverage of any of the daily newspapers at the time, as
well as covering aspects of the news that none of the other papers
did).

[1] "Life of Brian" was found to be both, among other films. I can't
say for certain whether or not there was a direct link between the

film uncensored, the Irish government started blocking British TV
broadcasts, which most people in Ireland had been able to receive.

[2] Every Friday and Saturday night, two of the German channels had

And of course, what does that idiot judge think
he's doing forbidding people from reading the books they've purchased?
Telling them not to talk about it may be reasonable, perhaps,  --
there's no right (in the US) to talk about what you hear on police radio
bands -- but telling them they can't read a book that's in front of them
is... paranoia.  Hopefully other Canadian courts will view this as an
aberration.  Canada has been good about supporting people's rights in
general: crypto importing/exporting, recording CDs, and watching foreign
commercial satellite broadcasts.  And gay marriage and marijuana....
Hopefully they aren't about to turn this around.

advantage: the discussion stimulates curiosity, and curiosity
stimulates invention. Nothing but a partial and limited view

if there be harm, it will be much more than counterbalanced by good."

But let's be clear here.  The right to exploit commercially the effort
